Given the multitude of pathways through which the\ntreatment or risk factor may affect the outcome, there is also an interest in decomposing the effect of a\ntreatment of risk factor into \"direct\" and \"mediated\" effects. For example, child's socioeconomic status\n(risk factor) may have a direct effect on the risk of death (outcome) and an effect that may be mediated\nthrough the adulthood socioeconomic status (mediator). Building on the potential outcome framework\nfor causal inference, we develop a Bayesian approach for estimating direct and mediated effects in the\ncontext of a dichotomous mediator and dichotomous outcome, which is challenging as many parameters\ncannot be fully identified. We first define principal strata corresponding to the joint distribution of the\nobserved and counterfactual values of the mediator, and define associate, dissociative, and mediated ef-\nfects as functions of the differences in the mean outcome under differing treatment assignments within the\nprincipal strata. We then develop the likelihood properties and calculate nonparametric bounds of these\ncausal effects assuming randomized treatment assignment. Because likelihood theory is not well devel-\noped for nonidentifiable parameters, we consider a Bayesian approach that allows the direct and mediated\neffects to be expressed in terms of the posterior distribution of the population parameters of interest. This\nrange can be reduced by making further assumptions about the parameters that can be encoded in prior\ndistribution assumptions. We perform sensitivity analyses by using several prior distributions that make\nweaker assumptions than monotonicity or the exclusion restriction. We consider an application that ex-\nplores the mediating effects of adult poverty on the relationship between childhood poverty and risk of\ndeath.\nKeywords: Direct effect; Mediated effect; Monotonicity; Mortality; Poverty.\nTo whom correspondence should be addressed.\nc The Author 2010.

For example, children born into poverty may\nhave their life span shortened through a variety of mechanisms. One of them might be that childhood\npoverty causes adult poverty, which in turn leads to reduced life span via poor (adult) health care, in-\ncreased stress, and other factors (Backlund and others, 1996), so that adult poverty is a mediator between\nchildhood poverty and risk of death. Alternatively, there may be effects of childhood poverty, for example,\npoor childhood health care, health knowledge, attitudes and behaviors, and a variety of other impacts that\nlead directly to reduced life span irrespective of adult poverty status (Kauhanen and others, 2006). The\nconcept of direct and mediated effects is often used in the vaccine literature (Halloran and Struchiner,\n1995; Haber, 1999), where vaccines can reduce the risk of contracting a disease through stimulation of\nsubject's immune system or directly affect risk of infection through the \"herd effect,\" the slowing or stop-\nping of a disease's movement through a population with an increased overall immune response. Direct\nand mediated effects are also closely related to issue of inference with a surrogate marker (Prentice, 1989;\nTaylor and others, 2005), where a good surrogate outcome serves as a mediator of treatment effect, leaving\nlittle effect of the treatment to directly impact the true outcome of interest through other channels.\nRegression methods to investigate mediation were outlined by Baron and Kenny (1986). They suggest\nfitting linear models to the data of the form\nE(Y | Z = z) = 1 + 1z,\nE(D | Z = z) = 2 + 2z,\nE(Y | D = d, Z = z) = 3 + 3z +  d. (1.1)\nMediation is evaluated by considering whether or not there is a significant marginal association between\nthe exposure and outcome (1 = 0), whether or not there is a significant association between the exposure\nand the mediator and between the outcome and the mediator after adjusting for the exposure (2 = 0\nand  = 0), and whether or not the direct effect of the exposure on the outcome is smaller in magnitude\nthan the total effect (|3| < |1|). If all these conditions are met, then D is said to mediate the effect of\nZ on Y. Interpreting the coefficients in the linear model becomes more problematic when the outcome\nis binary, particularly if confounders are included in (1.1) (Mackinnon and Dwyer, 1993). In this setting,\nMackinnon and others (2007) treat the outcome as a coarsened version of a continuous latent variable\nthat can be modeled as in (1.1), with numerical integration or simulation procedures used to evaluate the\nmarginal distribution of Y|Z under an explicit assumption about the distribution of D|Z.\nA special case of mediation occurs when D is considered to be a \"surrogate outcome\" standing in\nfor the true outcome of interest Y: Prentice (1989) discusses a model similar to that of Baron and Kenny,\nwhere the definition of a perfect surrogate assumes that 3 = 0 after adjusting for D. Wang and Taylor\n(2002), among others, define measures of the degree to which these surrogate markers can replace the\ntrue outcomes, that is, the degree to which these surrogate markers mediate the relationship between the\ntreatment and outcome.\nA shortcoming of these approaches is that they condition on a postrandomization variable, the ob-\nserved mediator D = d, after the assignment of Z. Hence, the effect of Z on Y after adjusting for D\ncan no longer be interpreted causally, even if Z is randomly assigned (Rosenbaum, 1984). To get around\nthis, Robins and Greenland (1992) define direct and indirect effects in terms of potential outcomes. They\nconsider the set of potential outcomes to include the value of the outcome under each of the possible\nvalues of the exposure and mediator and allow the set of \"potential observables\" to include values of the\nmediator under each of the potential exposure assignments. They define a \"prescriptive\" direct effect as\nthe expected value of the difference in the potential outcomes under different treatment assignments when\nBayesian inference for causal mediation effects 355\nthe value of the mediator is held constant, and an associated prescriptive indirect effect as the expected\ndifference in the total effect (expected difference in potential outcomes under different treatment assign-\nments population averaged over all values of the mediator) as the prescriptive direct effect. In a setting of\ndichotomous exposures, mediators, and outcomes, assuming that the exposure is randomized and never\nimproves the value of the mediator and that the effect of the potential exposure and the potential mediator\non the outcome do not interact, the direct effect of the exposure on the outcome is the proportion of the\npopulation in which the exposure causes the outcome regardless of the potential distribution of the medi-\nator, and the indirect effect is the proportion of the population in which the exposure causes the mediator\nand the mediator causes the outcome. In this framework, Albert (2008) develops a measure to quantify\nthe fraction of the overall treatment effect that is due to a mediator.\nRubin (2004) argues that, instead of allowing for the mediator and the exposure to both be implicitly\nassignable and thus for the distribution of the full set of potential outcomes to be the product of the dis-\ntribution of the mediator under all assignments and the distribution of the outcome under all assignments\nof the mediator and the exposure, inference should focus on the distribution of the potential outcomes\n\"conditional\" on the distribution of the mediator under all assignments (the \"potential mediator\"). The\nvalues of the mediator under all assignments form prerandomization \"principal strata\" (Frangakis and\nRubin, 2002) within which causal estimators can be obtained. Contrasts in the potential outcomes within\nstrata where the values of the mediator are constant provide an estimate of the direct effect of treatment,\nwhile contrasts in the potential outcomes within strata where the values of the mediator change provide\nan estimate of the mediated effect of treatment. Gallop and others (2009) developed this suggestion in the\ncontext of a continuous outcome assumed to be normally distributed. Here, we assume both a dichoto-\nmous mediator and a dichotomous outcome, which provides a challenging problem of identifiability, as\nwe discuss below.\nJoffe and Greene (2009) provide a comparison and contrast of the direct/indirect effect approach with\nthe principal stratification approach. We focus on the latter in this article, defining direct and mediated\neffects in terms of intent-to-treat (ITT) effects within the principal strata of the mediators in Section 2.\nSection 3 considers the structure of the likelihood and develops Bayesian estimation methods that provide\nposterior distributions of causal estimates of interest under different a priori constraints on the potential\nmediator distribution. Section 4 considers a specific data application, namely estimating the mediating\neffect of adult poverty on the relationship between childhood poverty and risk of death. Section 5 summa-\nrizes our findings and suggests future extensions of these methods. Our work provides 2 new contributions\nto the causal modeling literature. First, traditional identifiability restrictions such as monotonicity or the\nexclusion restriction make strong assumptions about the nature of the population. Thus, under monotonic-\nity, we assume that the exposure either has no effect or a unidirectional effect on the mediator. While this\nmight make sense in some settings, a more reasonable assumption might be that some principal strata\nare more common than others. Here, we consider priors that restrict the orderings of the proportions of\nprincipal strata rather than assuming they are zero. We also consider priors that do not constrain either\nthe principal strata or the potential outcomes in any fashion whatsoever. Second, we define a \"mediated\neffect\" that ranges between 0 and 1 in the absence of directional interaction among the treatment effects\nin the principal strata as the treatment effect ranges from direct to fully mediated.\nIn this article, we focus on the special case of a dichotomous exposure Z, dichotomous outcome Y, and\ndichotomous mediator D. We denote the potential mediator values under each of the exposure assignments\nby D(Z), and potential outcome values by Y(Z, D(Z)). (Because we do not allow the mediator to be ma-\nnipulated independently of the treatment, Y(Z, D(Z))  Y(Z) for all Z; we use the notation Y(Z, D(Z))\nTable 1. Joint distribution of counterfactular mediator and outcome\nwhenever we are emphasizing the mediators role in the causal pathway between Y and Z.) For patients\nreceiving treatment Z = z, we only observe Y(Z = z, D(Z = z)) and D(Z = z); Y(Z = 1 - z, D(Z =\n1 - z)) and D(Z = 1 - z) are unobserved. The joint distribution of Y(Z, D(Z)), D(Z) is a 16-cell multi-\nfor j, y0, and y1. The 4 sets of values that support the distribution of D(Z) form the 4 principal strata\nwithin which we will make inference about the potential outcomes Y(Z, D(Z)) and Y(1- Z, D(1- Z)):\nthese principal strata as \"never mediators,\" \"concordant mediators,\" \"always mediators,\" and \"discordant\nmediators.\"\nThe overall causal effect (ce) of the exposure is given by the ITT effect: the contrast of the potential\noutcome under Z = 1 with the potential outcome under Z = 0: D(Z)\nE(Y(1) - Y(0)) = (+2 + +3) - (+3 + +4) = +2 - +4. Our goal is to make inference about the\nITT effect within each of the mediation strata. Expanding the terminology of Frangakis and Rubin (2002)\nwith respect to surrogate measures, we term the contrast between potential outcomes within strata where\nthe exposure changes the mediator \"associative effects\"\nand the contrast between potential outcomes within strata where the exposure has no effect on the mediator\n\"disassociative effects\"\nIf the effect of the exposure is entirely direct, that is, unmediated through D, then,\nthus,\nor ae = de = ce. If the effect of the exposure is entirely mediated through D, that is, there is no direct\neffect of Z on Y, then,\n=\nBayesian inference for causal mediation effects 357\nand de = 0. Thus, we construct a mediated effect measure\nme =\n=\n.\nThe intuition behind me is that it will vary from 0 when the effect of treatment Z is entirely direct\n(in which case ae = +2 - +4) to 1 when the effect of Z is entirely mediated through D (in which\n= 1). Although me is technically unbounded, we feel that this measure captures\nthe concept of mediation and direct effect in most settings since situations where me is less than 0 or\ngreater than 1 are somewhat pathological. Thus, me < 0 if the ITT effect in the associative strata is\nsmaller than the ITT effect in the disassociative strata--which implies in our poverty example that the ef-\nfect of childhood poverty on risk of death being stronger when childhood poverty has no impact on adult\npoverty than when it does--and me > 1 if disassociative effect is negative--which implies that childhood\npoverty is \"protective\" when it has no impact on adult poverty.\nThroughout the remainder of this article, we assume that the exposure Z is assigned at random, so\nthat P(Z, D(0), D(1), Y(0, D(0)), Y(1, D(1)) = P(Z). Hence, the joint distribution of the potential\noutcomes and potential mediators is independent of treatment assignment, and we avoid the need to di-\nrectly model the assignment of the treatment Z (Rubin 1978). We also make the stable unit treatment\nvalue assumption (SUTVA; Rubin, 1990) that the assignment of a given subject to treatment Zi = z is\nindependent of the joint potential outcomes of (Dj (0), Dj (1), Yj (0), Yj (1)) for j = i.\n2.1 Monotonicity assumption\nA common assumption, plausible in many settings, is \"monotonicity\": D(0) D(1); this implies no\ndiscordant mediators or 4+ = 0. In the context of the mediating effect of adult poverty on child-\nhood poverty, the no defier assumption implies that no one would experience adult poverty as a con-\nsequence of having avoided childhood poverty. If we make the monotonicity assumption for the outcome\nY(0, D(0)) Y(1, D(1)) as well, that is, there are no \"discordant\" outcomes (where a subject does worse\nunder a treatment that is designed to help or vice versa), we have +4 = 0 as well. Hirano and others\n(2000) considered a similar model under the further restriction that either 12 = 0 (exclusion restriction\nin the never mediators) and/or 32 = 0 (exclusion restriction in the always mediators).\nUnder the monotonicity assumption, the associative effect reduces to\nand the disassociative effect to\nThe mediated effect measure reduces to\nme =\n=\n.\nNote that ae, de, and me all have an upper bound of 1 under monotonicity since 22 2+\n, and the dissasociative effect is constrained to be nonnegative.\n3.1 Under the monotonicity assumption\nWe observe D(Z = z) and Y(Z = z) only for the actual treatment assignment Z = z. Hence, the\ncontingency table for observed data is given in Table 2 along with the complete data parameters for each\nobserved data cell. The observed data likelihood is given by\n\u00d7\nwhere nz\ni j\ncorrespond to the observed cell counts of subjects with Z = z, D(z) = i, and Y(z) = j.\nDefine the observed proportions within each cell as pz\ni j = nz\ni j /nz. Unique maximum likelihood es-\ntimates (MLEs) for all marginal row and column percentages are available: ^\n, ^\n,\nand ^\n+3; similarly, ^\n, ^\n, and ^\n. Unique\nMLEs for the upper-left and lower-right cell parameters (11 and 33) can also be identified as p1\nand\n, respectively. MLEs for the remaining parameters are not uniquely identified but exist over a range of\nvalues. By considering the constraints imposed by the unique MLEs for sums of the parameters, MLEs\nfor the remaining 6 parameters can be identified up to boundaries (Chiba and others, 2007). In particular,\n(see Appendix A for derivations). Consequently, the boundaries of the MLE for the associative effect are\ngiven by\n,\nfor the disassociative effect by\n,\nTable 2. Observed data table under monotonicity assumption for mediator and outcome\nY\nBayesian inference for causal mediation effects 359\nand for the mediated effect by\n)\n,\n)\n.\nBecause the quantities with unique MLEs converge in probability to their true values, the asymptotic\nboundaries of the remaining MLEs are given by replacing the point estimates with their true values.\nIn small samples, the boundaries will be highly variable; as sample size increases, the boundaries will\nconverge toward their asymptotic limit, with the likelihood decreasing more rapidly beyond the boundary\npoint. To illustrate this, we consider a scenario with equally likely never, concordant, and always mediators\nby fixing 22 at a given value, maximizing the remaining values using an expectation-maximization (EM)\nalgorithm, and computing the likelihood at the fixed 22 and the maximized values of the remaining i j ;\nsee Appendix B.)\nAlthough some recent work has taken on the challenge for developing frequentist theory for situations\nin which likelihoods are flat (e.g. Romano and Shaikh, 2008), standard asymptotic methods for point\nestimation and interval construction do not apply. Thus, we turn to Bayesian methods to describe the\ninformation available about the associative and disassociative effects of interest. We obtain simulations\nfrom the posterior distribution of \n\n via a data augmentation algorithm (Tanner and Wong, 1987). Details\nare provided in Appendix C.\n3.2 Relaxing the monotonicity assumption\nAllowing for \"discordant\" mediators and outcomes, the observed data likelihood becomes\nUnlike the monotonicity setting, there are no identifiable estimates of any of the parameters governing\neither the joint distribution or marginal distributions of D(0), D(1), and Y(0, D(0)), Y(1, D(1)).

In particular, the boundary conditions for ae are\n^\nI (( ^\n4+l) + I (( ^\n,\n^\nI (( ^\n4+l) + I (( ^\n,\nfor de are\n^\nI (( ^\n3+l) + I (( ^\n,\n^\nI (( ^\n3+l) + I (( ^\n,\nand for me are\nA - B\n1 - I (A B)( ^\n4+l) + I (A B)( ^\n,\nwhere\nA =\n^\nI (( ^\n+4l) + I (( ^\n,\nB = ( ^\nand the lower and upper MLE limits ^\nli j and ^\nui j for ^\ni j , and equivalently ^\nli+\nand ^\nui+\nfor ^\ni+\n, and\n^\nl+ j and ^\nu+ j for ^\n+ j are provided in Appendix A.\n3.3 Stochastic monotonicity assumption\nWe also consider a restricted prior that constrains 2+ 4+\nthat the fraction of \"concordant\" mediators be greater than the fraction of \"discordant\" mediators, and\nthat, within all the principal strata except for the discordant, that the fraction of \"concordant\" outcomes\nbe greater than the fraction of \"discordant\" outcomes. We term this prior \"stochastic monotonicity.\" The\nconstraint is imposed in the Gibbs sampling process by rejecting all draws from the conditional posterior\nBayesian inference for causal mediation effects 361\nof \n\n that do not meet the constraint. Implicit in this prior is that the directionality of the treatment,\nmediator, and outcome have been \"lined up,\" so that Z = 1, D = 1, and Y = 1 are consistent with a risk\nfactors and poor outcomes, or protective treatments and good outcomes. This prior implies an upper limit\nof 1 for the mediated effect me since negative disassociative effects are no longer possible.\nClosed-form solutions for the MLE boundaries for the ae, de, and me can no longer be obtained; linear\nprogramming methods may be used instead (Balke and Pearl, 1997).\nThe Alameda County Study is a stratified random sample survey of households living in Alameda County\nin California (Breslow and Kaplan, 1965). The purpose of the survey was to explore the influence of\nhealth practices and social relationships on the physical and mental health of a representative sample of\nthe Alameda County population. Information was obtained for 6928 respondents covering chronic health\nconditions, health behaviors, social involvement, and psychological characteristics. Questions were asked\non marital and life satisfaction, parenting, physical activities, employment, and childhood experiences.\nDemographic variables on age, race, height, weight, education, income, and religion are also included.\nIn particular, poverty during childhood and poverty at the time of the 1965 interview are ascertained.\nRespondents were followed and survival status noted for 3352 respondents in 2000. Survival status by\nchildhood poverty status and adult poverty status is shown in Table 3: 28% of children not in poverty were\nadults in poverty, and 44% of children in poverty were also adults in poverty.\nIt could be argued that childhood poverty is a largely randomized variable in that children do not\nchoose their poverty status but are in some sense \"randomly\" assigned at birth; alternatively, an analysis\ncould be conducted that controlled for confounders, such as size of family, parent's martial status, or\nother factors associated with childhood poverty that one might wish to separate from the pure effect of\npoverty by using a preliminary propensity score adjustment (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983). Here, we\nuse propensity scores to restore balance with respect to gender, age, and race between those in poverty\nand those not in poverty during childhood. We include a linear and quadratic term for age and a dummy\nvariable for race (white, African-American, and other) to account for the fact that older persons were more\nlikely to experience childhood poverty than younger persons, and African-Americans more likely and\nthose of other races less likely to experience childhood poverty. Because of the extraordinary imbalance\nwith respect to race among those in childhood poverty, African-Americans remain more likely to be in\nchildhood poverty than whites, although the difference is substantially reduced (see Table 4).\nTable 3.

The\npropensity score\u00adadjusted analysis was conducted by stratifying the data by propensity score quintile and\nrunning separate Markov chain Monte Carlo chains within each stratum. A draw from the posterior of \n\n is\nobtained as the weighted average of draws from each of the 5 propensity strata, weighted in proportion to\nthe fraction of the sample contained in each (approximate) quintile. MLE boundaries under the stochastic\nmonotonicity assumption are obtained using the linear programming package simplex in R (R Version\n2.8.0, The R Foundation for Statistical Computing).\nAllowing for nonmonotonicity suggests that about 40% of the population (95% CI 35\u00ad45%) is im-\nmune to adult poverty (never mediators), 30% (95% CI 26\u00ad36%) are protected against adult poverty by\nnot experiencing childhood poverty (concordant mediators), 15% (95% CI 11\u00ad19%) are doomed to adult\npoverty (always mediators), and 15% (95% CI 10\u00ad18%) experience adult poverty only if they do not ex-\nto wide credible intervals. Constraining the prior decreases the posterior median of the associative effect\nCI 0.021, 0.161), suggesting rather counterintuitively that the effect of childhood poverty on survival is ac-\ntually stronger when there is no impact on adult poverty than when there is. Balancing on age and race via\nthe propensity score analysis moves the posterior median of the associative effect toward zero--reflecting\nthat part of the childhood poverty effect is confounded with the age and race of the respondents--and\nreduces the width of the posterior intervals. For comparison purposes, the overall effect of death on child-\nhood poverty is 6.4 percentage points, and the age/race/sex\u00adadjusted effect is 2.6 percentage points.\nAssuming monotonicity suggests that the fraction of never mediators is 54% (95% CI 51\u00ad56%), of\nThe disassociative effect is centered near the point estimate for the overall effect of childhood poverty\nBayesian inference for causal mediation effects 363\nTable 5.

Assuming monotonicity--that there are no persons who experience adult poverty if and only if\nthey do not experience childhood poverty--provides very modest evidence that the increased risk of death\namong persons experiencing childhood poverty is partly mediated through adult poverty. Standard regres-\nsion methods applied to this data yield results consistent with the results obtained under monotonicity,\nalthough the data suggest that a modest fraction of the population may indeed by inoculated.\nFig. 2.

SM =\nstochastic monotonicity assumption; Mono = monotonicity assumption.\nStandard regression approaches to mediation such as Baron and Kenny (1986) lack causal interpreta-\ntion due to potential unobserved confounding even when treatment is randomized because mediator is\nobserved postrandomization. Use of principal strata defined using the counterfactual distribution of the\nmediators creates a conceptual prerandomization variable. In particular, a dissassociative effect of treat-\nment can be estimated as the ITT effect among subjects for whom the mediator does not change under\ndifferent treatment assignments, and similarly an associative effect can be estimated as the ITT effect\namong subjects for whom the mediator does change under different treatment assignments. A mediated\neffect can then be constructed by considering the value of the disassociative and associative effects when\nthe overall treatment effect is entirely direct versus completely mediated.\nIn the setting we consider here--dichotomous mediators and treatments--lack of identifiability sug-\ngests use of Bayesian inference. Posterior distributions of ITT effects within principal strata are informed\nby the data since boundary conditions are imposed on the counterfactual distribution. In general, principal\nstratum inference is consistent with standard regression analysis when counterfactual correlation between\nmediator and outcome is large (small) when mediation is present (absent). Principal stratum inference\nanalysis protects against inappropriate inference when counterfactual correlation is small (large) when me-\ndiation is present (absent) (see simulation studies available at http://www.sph.umich.edu/mrelliot/causal\n/med-bios2.pdf). The Bayesian approach also allow us to incorporate constraints such as monotonicity or\na relaxed stochastic monotonicity.\nThe methods developed here assume unconfounded treatment assignment Z. This assumption is very\nstrong in many observational studies, although occasionally treatments of interest might appear in the\nBayesian inference for causal mediation effects 365\nform of instrumental variables, such as changes in laws that might affect mediating behaviors but would\nbe independent of the joint distribution of the potential outcomes. In general, we propose using propensity\nscores to balance on observed covariates.\nA reviewer raised the issue of whether differences between the results of a standard regression anal-\nysis of mediation effects and the results of an analysis using principal stratification to account for pos-\ntrandomization selection bias have implications for study design, above and beyond the need to obtain\nunconfounded treatment assignment to start with. While Hudgens and Gilbert (2009) considered power\nand sample designs in the surrogacy setting, they did so under conditions sufficiently restrictive to obtain\nconsistent estimators. In our setting, with flat likelihoods, sensible sample size calculations could focus\non determination of interval widths under a variety of plausible assumptions about direct and mediating\nmechanisms. It is less clear to us now we might make use of observed discrepancies between the principal\nstratum and the standard regression approaches in designing further studies; however, we may be overly\npessimistic in this assessment, and look forward to others' consideration of this question.\nMany extensions of this work are possible. A variety of different prior constraints could be considered:\nfor example, we might retain monotonicity for the outcome but relax it in some fashion for the mediator\nor vice versa. Baseline covariates that allow prediction of principal stratification status can be useful in\nsharpening inference. In the noncompliance setting, where much of the mediation analysis using principal\nstrata has focused, few practical predictors of compliance have been found. In more general applications,\nsuch as the one considered here, searches for predictors of principal stratification status may prove more\nfruitful.\n"
