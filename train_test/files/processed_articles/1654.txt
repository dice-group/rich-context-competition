    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nBackground: Addressing missing data on body weight, height, or\nboth is a challenge many researchers face. In calculating the body\nmass index (BMI) of study participants, researchers need to impute\nthe missing data.\nObjective: A multiple imputation through a chained equations ap-\nproach was used to determine whether one should first impute the\nmissing anthropometric data and then calculate BMI or use an\nimputation model to obtain BMI.\nDesign: The present study used computer simulation to address the\nquestion of how to calculate BMI when there is missing data on\nweight and height. The simulated data reflected data gathered on\nnon-Hispanic white youths (n \u00bc 905) aged 2\u00ad18 y, who participated\nvey (NHANES).\nResults: The simulation indicated that it made little difference in\nthe accuracy with which the youths' mean BMIs were estimated\nwhen the data were missing completely at random. However, the\nuse of a model to impute BMI was favored slightly when the data\nwere missing at random and the imputation model included the\nvariable used to determine missingness.\nConclusion: The present findings extend the use of passive imputa-\ntion and the use of multiple imputation through a chained equations\napproach to an area of critical public health importance.

Of the measures used to assess an in-\ndividual's body fat, the most prominent is body mass index\n(BMI), which is calculated as weight (in kg)/height2 (in m) (1, 5,\n6). The latter cannot be calculated when either measurement is\nmissing, and failure to address the missing measurements may\nbias the estimation. To minimize bias, many researchers have\nused multiple imputation (7, 8).\nMultiple imputation has been widely used since Rubin pro-\nposed his framework (9\u00ad13). Many researchers have modified\nthese methods; therefore, frequent reviews have become nec-\nessary (14\u00ad19). Rubin's framework identifies 3 missing data\nmechanisms (13). When data are missing completely at random\n(MCAR), the probability of nonresponse cannot be predicted by\nany variable, observed or unobserved, and participants with in-\ncomplete data constitute a random sample of all participants.\nWhen data are missing at random (MAR), the probability of\nnonresponse depends on observed and missing variables. Finally,\nwhen data are missing not at random, the probability of non-\nresponse depends on observed variables.\nTo date, the literature on multiple imputation has not addressed\na number of basic questions (20). One such question is, ``Should\nresearchers impute the components needed to calculate an index\nor should they impute the index?'' Two exceptions include\nstudies conducted by Liu et al (21) and Gmel (22). Liu et al had\nmissing data on one or more 12-item Short Form Health Survey\n(SF-12) items and wanted to calculate the 2 SF-12 component\nscores. They used computer simulation to compare the perfor-\nmance of a ``simple'' imputation model that used the available\nSF-12 item scores with that of an ``enhanced'' model that sup-\nplemented the available scores with other participant data. The\nenhanced model performed better when !6 SF-12 items were\nmissing; the simple model was adequate when the number of\nmissing items was ,6. Because Gmel's respondents had missing\ndata on !1 of 8 components, Gmel could not calculate a sum-\nmary measure of alcohol consumption. Gmel imputed item\nscores because the distribution displayed by his items was most\nconsistent in his multivariate normal imputation model.\nIf data were missing on a few items, most researchers imputed\nthe missing component scores. This practice would be consistent\nwith that of Liu et al (21). When 2 variables (eg, weight and\nheight) are used to calculate an index such as BMI, will it matter\nwhether the researcher imputes the missing data or simply im-\nputes the index? The present study used computer simulation to\naddress this question using simulated data consistent with that\n1 From the Department of Human Development and Family Studies, Col-\nlege of Health and Human Development, The Pennsylvania State University,\nUniversity Park, PA (DAW); the Department of Statistics, University of\nConnecticut, Storrs, CT (OH); and the Department of Nutrition and Dietet-\nics, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC (SK).\n2 The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not\nnecessarily represent the official views of the National Institute of Child\nHealth and Human Development or the National Institutes of Health.\nChild Health and Human Development.\n4 Reprints not available.

It should be noted that these data were used for\nillustration purposes only.\nThe National Center of Health Statistics, a unit of the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, periodically collects na-\ntionally representative data on the health and nutrition status of\nthe US population by using the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES) (23). Trained personnel in-\nterview family members and collect data on the participants'\nsociodemographic characteristics, diet, and health. A proxy is\ninterviewed if the individual is aged 15 y or cannot provide\na report. Participating individuals are invited to visit a mobile\ncenter for standardized medical examinations that include an-\nthropometric measurements. The present study is based on data\nobtained from 905 non-Hispanic white youths between the\nMeasures\nAge (y) was assessed by asking the individual or the proxy for\nthe sampled person's exact date of birth. Standing height (cm)\nwas measured to the nearest tenth of a centimeter with a fixed\nstadiometer with a vertical backboard and a moveable headboard.\nAbdominal waist circumference (cm) was measured to the nearest\ntenth of a centimeter with a steel measuring tape according to\nstandard procedures. Weight (kg) was measured as the individual\nstood on a digital according to standard procedures. Two scales\nindividual's weight was set equal to missing if the individual had\nundergone a limb amputation.\nPoverty-income ratio (PIR) is the ratio of self-reported total\nhousehold income to the number of adults and children in the\nfamily. PIR values ,1.00 are below the official poverty threshold;\nPIR values .5 were set equal to 5. BMI (in kg/m2) is a relative\nmeasure of body fat that is calculated by dividing weight by\nheight squared. For children and adolescents, classification as\nnormal/healthy weight, overweight, or obese is based on sex-\nand age-specific BMI-for-age growth charts prepared by the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.\nProcedures\nThe present study mirrored the steps that Ezzati-Rice et al (24)\nused to compare different imputation techniques with NHANES\nrestricting attention to 6 variables: age, height, weight, PIR,\nwaist circumference, and BMI. Summary statistics for these\nvariables and the percentage of missing data on weight and\nheight are shown in Table 1. All computations were done using\nStata software (version 9), a general purpose statistical package\n(25).Toinitiatethe simulation, Stata's hotdeckprogramwasused to\nidentify plausible target values for the 6 means and the corre-\nsponding variance-covariance matrix. These summary statistics\nwere used by Stata's drawnorm program to generate multivariate\nnormal samples. The latter were generated because of the wide-\nspread availability of multivariate normal generators. Once target\nvalues were identified, the following 4 steps were executed:\nStep 1: Draw a multivariate normal sample of 1080 observations\nfrom the hypothetical population, delete all cases for which\ngenerated values are 0, randomly sort the remaining records\nand delete all records in excess of n \u00bc 905, and proceed to\nStep 2: Impose the missing height-weight data pattern that was\nobserved among the 905 NHANES participants by using an\nMCAR (MAR) missing data mechanism.\nStep 3: Use Stata's ICE program to obtain 10 multiply imputed\ndata sets (26\u00ad28). This imputation method, which is described\nlater in greater detail, uses a sequence of regression models to\nimpute missing values conditional on other predictors.\nStep 4: Use Stata's MIM program (29) to apply Rubin's rules (13)\nand obtain the mean, SE, and df for the combined estimates of\nheight, weight, and BMI, and then write the 9 values to an\noutput file for further analyses.\nmechanism and with an MAR missing data mechanism. To im-\nplement an MCAR missing data mechanism, 905 records were\ngenerated,randomlysorted,andmergedwithafilethatconsistedof\ntwo 0/1 variables. If the value was 1, the corresponding value\nof weight or height was set equal to missing; if either weight or\nheight was set equal to missing, the corresponding BMI value was\nset equal to missing.

Active imputation refers to the usual methods and\nmodels used to impute data with this approach.\nMICE combines the most attractive features of multivariate\nnormal imputation and the more flexible regression-based\napproaches to imputation. The Stata program that implements\nthis approach is called ICE (26\u00ad28). With this approach, the user\nspecifies a conditional distribution for the missing data on each\nvariable. For example, using Equations 1 and 2, linear regression\nmodels were specified for weight and for height. Stata's ICE\nprogram cycles through the system of equations until all varia-\nbles have complete data. (Cycles handle incomplete data on any\nspecified predictor, and users can use a dry run option to see the\nmodels that are fitted.) The critical assumption on which this\napproach is built is that a multivariate distribution exists from\nwhich the specified or implied conditional distributions can be\nderived and that one can use iterative Gibbs sampling to draw ran-\ndom values from these conditional distributions. Both Raghunathan\net al's (31) sequential regression approach and a multiple imputation\nthrough a chained equations approach cycle through a sequence of\nregression models to obtain imputed values. In comparative\nstudies of various imputation approaches, the MICE approach has\nRESULTS\nSummary statistics for the sample of non-Hispanic white\nare shown in Table 1.

Each run started with the same hotdeck-\ncompleted data set (n \u00bc 905), for which the mean BMI was\n19.4692. On each run, the records were randomly sorted, and the\nweight and/or height measurements were set equal to missing\nafter merging with a randomly sorted file with two 0/1 indicators\nfor the NHANES missing weight-height data pattern. Stata's\nICE program was used to return 10 multiply imputed data sets,\nand MIM was used to process these data sets and to obtain\na combined mean and SE for the BMI scores that had been\nimputed passively (actively). When BMI scores were imputed\npassively (Equations 1\u00ad3), the absolute error was 0.98% and the\nrelative error was 0.05%; when BMI scores were imputed ac-\ntively (Equation 4), the absolute error was 20.04% and the\nrelative error was 0.0%. These values were comparable with\nthose reported when the data were generated with a multivariate\nnormal model and records with negative values were excluded.\nOn completion of the test runs, the present study moved to the\nsimulation phase. With each of the 4 simulation runs, the total\nsample size (n \u00bc 905) on entry to step 2 and the missing weight-\nheight data patterns on exit from step 2 were identical. More-\nover, the missing weight-height data patterns were the same as\nthe patterns observed in the NHANES sample (Table 1). Finally,\n5000 samples were generated for each simulation run, a missing\ndata process was imposed on each sample, and 10 multiply\nimputed data sets were created and analyzed.\nWith simulation 1, an MCAR missing data mechanism was\nimposed after each sample was generated. Then, ICE used\nEquations 1 and 2 to actively impute plausible values for weight\nand height; ICE used Equation 3 to passively impute missing\nBMI scores. With each call to ICE, 10 multiply imputed data\nsets were created. After the imputed data sets were written to\ndisk, another Stata program, MIM (28), was used to process the\nmultiply imputed data sets and to obtain combined estimates and\nSEs for weight, height, and BMI.\nWith simulation 2, an MAR missing data mechanism was\nimposed. Stata's ICE program was used to actively impute\nplausible values for weight and height and to passively impute\nplausible values for BMI. Ten multiply imputed data sets were\ncreated with each call to ICE, and MIM was used to obtain\ncombined estimates and SEs for weight, height, and BMI.\nWith simulation 3, an MCAR missing data mechanism was\nimposed. Then, ICE used Equation 4 to actively impute BMI and\nreturn 10 multiply imputed data sets. After the data sets were\nwritten to disk, MIM was used to obtain combined estimates and\nSEs for BMI.\nWith simulation 4, an MAR missing data mechanism was\nimposed, and ICE was called to actively impute BMI and return\n10 multiply imputed data sets. After the data sets were written to\ndisk, MIM was used to obtain combined estimates and SEs for\nBMI. The absolute and relative errors observed for the 4 sim-\nulation runs are shown in the lower portion of Table 3.\nDISCUSSION\nMany data sets have missing or implausible data for weight\nand height because of nonresponse, measurement error, or data\nentry problems. The results of the present study indicate that\nresearchers can use passive or active imputation to address\nmissing data on height and/or weight and obtain individuals' BMI\nvalues when the data are MCAR or MAR. Precise estimates of the\nmean BMI were obtained with passive and with active imputation\nwhen the missing data mechanism was MCAR. Less, but still\nreasonably, precise estimates of BMI were obtained with passive\nand with active imputation when the missing data mechanism\nwas MAR. However, it must be stated that the imputation model\nincluded age--the variable used to impose the MAR missing data\nprocess. An obvious advantage of a missing data simulation is\nthat researchers know and control the factors that determine\nmissingness. Meeting this condition is far more challenging when\nresearchers collect data from study participants.\nLimitations\nAs with all simulation-based research on missing data, the\npresent findings are limited to the number and variable types and\nto the missing data percentages and patterns that were considered.\nBy no means did the present study attempt to be comprehensive\nor mimic any frequently occurring missing data situation. The\nauthors restricted their attention to anthropometric data reported\nwere working with the NHANES data and they needed BMI\nscores that were not observed for all youths. The authors only\nconsidered a limited number of variables in the present study\nbecause this limited number provided them with the means to\nassess their question, ``Should one impute the missing data on\nweight and/or height and then calculate BMI or should one use an\nimputation model to obtain BMI?''\nConclusions\nRubin (10\u00ad14) proposed a framework for estimating pop-\nulation parameters with incomplete data. More importantly, he\nand subsequent researchers developed software that can be used\nto create and analyze multiply imputed data sets (34). As these\ntools have matured, researchers have sought to address practical\nAbsolute and relative error estimating the target BMI value (20.53)\nUnit Combined mean Absolute error Relative error Remarks\n1MCAR, missing completely at random; MAR, missing at random; MDM, missing data mechanism.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\n``how-to'' questions. The present study used computer simula-\ntion to ask, Should one calculate BMI from imputed values of\nweight and/or height, or should one use an imputation model to\nimpute BMI? The answer to this particular question is important\nfor !3 reasons. First, BMI is associated with elevated morbidity\nand mortality. Additionally, BMI is used to mark a country's\nprogress toward ameliorating the current epidemic of over-\nweight and obesity. Second, despite the relative ease and accu-\nracy with which an individual's weight and height can be\nmeasured by a trained individual, missing BMI data are found in\nwell-executed studies. Third, variables such as waist circumfer-\nence can be collected by an individual who has been trained to use\na tape measure, are highly correlated with individuals' BMIs, and\ncan function effectively in an imputation model for BMI.\nDid it matter whether BMI was imputed passively or actively?\nThe results of the present study show that it made very little\ndifference whether BMI was imputed passively or actively when\nindividuals' weight and/or height measurements were MCAR.\nOn the other hand, active imputation of BMI was favored slightly\nwhen the data were MAR. This latter finding is undoubtedly due\nin part to the fact that the imputation model for BMI included\nage--the variable that had been used to impose the MAR missing\ndata mechanism.\nThe finding that multiple imputation's combined estimator was\nunbiased when the missing data mechanism was MCAR and\nwhen the missing BMI values were imputed passively or actively\nis consistent with missing data theory and with the findings\nreported by other researchers. Indeed, estimates obtained by ad\nhoc methods, such as mean substitution, are unbiased when the\ndata are MCAR. Our second major finding that the combined\nestimator of mean BMI was biased slightly when the missing data\nmechanism was MAR and BMI was imputed passively is also\nconsistent with missing data theory and the point that multiple\nimputation is only as good as the imputation models for weight\nand height: the dropoff in precision was due to the performance of\nthe imputation models for weight and height. From the literature,\nit was relatively easy to find an anthropometric measure--waist\ncircumference--that was strongly correlated with BMI and\nobtained when the youth received a physical examination. Such\nwas not the case for individuals' weights and heights.\nImplications\nThe present findings generalize to ratios similar to the BMI,\nsuch as weight/height, height/Oweight, weight/height3, the waist-\nhip ratio, and waist circumference-to-height. However, our\nfindings clearly suggest similar simple ratios (ie, ratios of the\nform ua/vb) for which the researcher has collected data that can\nbe used to obtain plausible values. The present findings also ex-\ntend the use of passive imputation to ratios. Previous examples\nhave included product interaction terms and linear composites.\nAs substantive researchers confront the challenges posed by\nmissing anthropometric data, additional data collection of\nmeasures that would afford imputation of missing data should be\nconsidered. The present study indicates that missing BMI values\ncan be imputed passively or actively when the missing data\nmechanism is ignorable (MCAR or MAR) and when data on\na related measure (eg, waist circumference) have been collected.\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--SK and DAW: conceived\nthe study; DAW: reviewed the literature, conducted the simulation, and con-\ntributed to the writing; OH: guided the data simulation methodology and con-\ntributed to the writing; and SK: led the project and contributed to the writing.\nAll authors approved this manuscript.
