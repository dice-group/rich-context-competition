    "abstract": "Abstract. The mirror reversal of an image is subtly different from the original. Often such change\ngoes unnoticed in pictures, although it can affect preference. For the first time we studied the effect of\nmirror reversal of feature films. People watched Yojimbo or Sanjuro in a cinema, both classic films by\nAkira Kurosawa. They knew that this was a study and filled out a questionnaire. On one day Yojimbo\nwas shown in its original orientation, and on another day the film was mirror reversed. Sanjuro was\nshown reversed on one day and non-reversed on another day. Viewers did not notice the reversal,\neven when they had seen the film before and considered themselves fans of Kurosawa. We compared\nthis with estimates from a survey. In addition, the question about the use of space (scenography)\nrevealed that although people who had seen the film before gave higher ratings compared with those\nwho had not, this was only true when the film was not reversed.\n",

The stick points to the right, and the samurai follows the road to a village.\nHere the story begins. We will never know where he would have arrived if the stick had sent\nhim to the left. But what we can test is how different the film would have been if keeping\neverything else the same, the stick had pointed to the left and the samurai had walked to\nthe left to a similar but mirror-reversed village. In other words, an entire film can be shown\nwith a left-right reversal of the images. This is what we did in our study, and afterwards asked\nviewers a series of questions on their experience. By doing this we tested (i) how often people\nreported that the film was reversed and also (ii) whether the judgments on the quality of the\nfilm, acting, and scenography were different for the participants that saw the original or the\nreversed versions.\n2 Composition and scenography\nIn the study of the visual arts, composition and balance are important themes (recent studies\nof balance include McManus et al 2011 and Gershoni and Hochstein 2011). For instance,\nOpp\u00e9 (1944) claimed that Raphael's cartoons changed in meaning as the drawings were\nturned into tapestries (and mirror reversed in the process). One possibility is that people\nhave a specific way of scanning a picture, and as a consequence, they prefer images in\nwhich movement proceeds from left to right (Gaffron 1950). Empirical research on aesthetic\njudgments of pictures has identified some asymmetrical biases: there is a preference for\nhaving more salient content on the right side (Levy 1976; Beaumont 1985), for directional\n\u00b6 Corresponding author.\ncues pointing from left to right (Mead and McLaughlin 1992), for light coming from the left\n(Mamassian 2008), for portraits (especially of females) to show the left cheek rather than the\nright cheek (McManus and Humphrey 1973; Schirillo 2000), and for more space present in\nfront (anterior) as opposed to behind when objects have a facing direction (Palmer et al 2008;\nBertamini et al 2011). All but the last of these aspects of an image are affected by a left-right\nreversal.\nThe aesthetic criteria for a film may differ from those used to assess a painting (Cutting\n2002; Cutting et al 2011). In Arnheim's words: \"Film almost never deals with non-moving\npictures as do painting and photography, and thus we cannot speak here strictly of the\ncomposition of a static image\" (1997, page 86). However, Arnheim goes on to argue that\ncomposition is part of a broader set of spatial aspects of a film. For dynamic images,\ncomposition in this broad sense is likely to be even more important than in paintings,\nand we will use the term scenography to refer to spatial composition as well as the set,\ncostume, and lighting. Although usage of this term differs amongst authors, our use is in\nline with the following definitions of scenography: \"the manipulation and orchestration of\nthe performance environment. The means by which this is pursued are typically through\narchitectonic structures, light, projected images, sound, costume and performance objects\nor props\" (McKinney and Butterworth 2009, page 4) and \"the creation of the stage space\"\nThe left-right reversal manipulation changes some aspects of spatial layout while leaving\nothers intact. Persons and objects relocate to the opposite side of the image, and any\nhorizontal motion is in the opposite direction. The way that clothes are folded and swords are\ncarried also changes. A kimono, for example, is always worn with the left side overlapping the\nright side (the reverse is used to dress a corpse for burial). Light that used to come from one\nside is now coming from the other. Any right-handed actor becomes left-handed and vice\nversa. Finally, many emotions are expressed by actors during a film, and facial expressions\nare also known to be asymmetrical (Sackheim and Gur 1978), and more so for deliberate\nfacial actions (Ekman et al 1981). Any of these factors could be noticed by an observer, but\neven when they are not noticed, they could also contribute to a change in the evaluation of a\nfilm overall, or more specifically in relation to an evaluation of scenography (defined in our\nquestion as the use of space, set, costume, and lighting).\n3 The films\nAkira Kurosawa (1910\u00ad98) is frequently cited as one of the greatest directors of all time. He is\nalso widely acknowledged as an influence on other directors, from Sergio Leone to George\nLucas (both of whom used themes from Kurosawa's films in their own productions [Galbraith\n2002; Richie 1999]). A perfectionist, he worked passionately on every aspect of the filmmaking\nprocess. He used multiple cameras and was particularly admired for his skills as an editor\n(Richie 1999). Images from Kurosawa's films are powerful and memorable.\nYojimbo (1961) is set in 1860's Japan. The main character is a ronin (a masterless samurai)\nplayed by the actor Toshir\u00af\no Mifune. Some themes, such as the taciturn samurai, inspired\nlater western films (eg, the nameless hero). Sanjuro (1962) is a sequel to Yojimbo in which we\nmeet again the same protagonist, although the film is lighter in tone (see Figure 1). Both were\nfilmed in black and white and have never been dubbed into English. In our study they were\nscreened in the original Japanese with English subtitles. A few seconds (less than a minute) at\nthe beginning of each film and at the end were omitted to avoid any words using the Roman\nalphabet (but titles and credits in Japanese were preserved). The running times for Yojimbo\nand Sanjuro are 110 minutes and 96 minutes, respectively.\n530 M Bertamini, C Bode, N Bruno\nWe chose Kurosawa not only because he is highly admired as a director but also because\nin these films there are no cars and no Roman alphabet writing. We wanted to avoid the\nspecial case of detection of inversion for text and focus instead on the change in handedness\nand in composition of the visual images.\nFigure 1. The original posters for the films Yojimbo (left) and Sanjuro (right). In the Sanjuro poster\nMifune is holding his sword with his left hand. Possibly the image was reversed to fit the composition\nof the poster, but we could find no information on this (and therefore it may be that this has gone\nunnoticed before).\n4 Familiarity\nIt is well known that having been exposed to a stimulus may affect responses to it at a\nlater time. There is a large literature on implicit learning or learning without awareness\n(eg, Seger 1994). Importantly for aesthetics, prior exposure also affects preference and\naffective responses, a phenomenon known as \"mere exposure\" (Zajonc 1968; 1980). Mere\nexposure has been studied in relation to actual works of art (eg, Berlyne 1970). Cutting\n(2003; 2007) discussed the application of the idea of mere exposure to the formation and\nmaintenance of artistic canons and provided evidence to support this view in the case of\nFrench Impressionism.\nIf exposure is critical for the evaluation of a film, then viewers that have seen the film\nbefore may behave differently from viewers that have not seen the film. Unlike a laboratory\nstudy, we cannot randomly assign people to the two groups. Moreover, what people may be\nunaware of is not which film they have seen in the past but the specific details of the film. If\nso, it is possible that people who remember having seen the film before may not notice that\nthe film is now different (mirror reversed) and yet evaluate the film differently than those\nwho see the film in the original orientation (because only the latter are being exposed to the\nsame film again).\n5 Expectations about how easy it is to notice a left-handed world\nIn addition to the study of the experience of watching a left-right reversed film, we wanted to\nknow what intuitive beliefs people have about how easy it is to detect a left-right reversal.\nTo do this, we used a simple questionnaire with three different scenarios. One group of\nparticipants (N = 35) was asked whether it would be easy or difficult to notice that the world\nhas been left-right reversed. Another scenario described a museum in which all paintings\nhave been mirror reversed (N = 35), and a third described a film (N = 35). The wordings of\nthe questions are presented inside the graphs of Figure 2. For instance the question about\nthe film was: \"Imagine that you went to see a new film, and in the film the entire world has\nbeen changed into its mirror-reversed version. Most things would be the same except that\nmost people in the film would now use their left-hand to eat, shake hands, point, and so on.\nHow long do you think it would take for you to notice?\"(1) Participants circled one of three\nanswers: \"Immediately\", \"Some time\", \"Never\". If they answered \"Some time,\" they were\nthen asked how long. This first question was followed by a second question: \"Now, please\nanswer the same question but this time the film is a film that you had seen before in the\nnon-reversed version. How long do you think it would take for you to notice?\" This follow-up\nquestion was included only for the film and the museum scenarios, as the world cannot be\nunfamiliar.\nThe 105 participants were students from several classes at the University of Liverpool,\nincluding some with mature students. The majority were females (86), and the mean age\nwas 24 years. Figure 2 shows the percentage of responses in each category. The \"some time\"\ncategory has been split into \"less than an hour\" and \"more than an hour\" on the basis of the\nspecific predictions made by the participants.\nIn all cases a majority of respondents predicted that they would notice the reversal\nimmediately or that it would take them less than an hour to notice it (world, 63%; museum,\n63%; film, 63%). This majority increased when they were asked to assume that the paintings\nin the museum or the film were familiar to them (museum, 100%; film, 74%). We are not\ngoing to speculate about the differences between the three scenarios, as they may require\nfurther research. Our purpose was simply to see whether people's intuition was that this task\nwas easy or hard. We can conclude from the data that the task is judged to be non-trivial\n(overall \"immediately\" responses were 27%) and that a few minutes may be necessary to\nnotice the change, but this task is not impossible (overall \"never\" responses were 16%).\n6 Left-right reversal\nThis study is the first investigation of the experience of watching a film after a manipulation\nthat reverses the left-right orientation of the image. The first empirical question to answer is\nwhether the spectators will notice the mainly left-handed world of the story, and whether\nhaving seen the film before, would increase the detection of the change. If the outcome were\nto match the expectations, based on the data presented above, a majority of people will\ndetect the reversal, and this majority will be larger in the case of people who had seen the\nfilm before.\nThe sample in our study was made up of people who came to a free screening in a cinema\nlocated in the centre of Liverpool, UK. This sample was completely different from the sample\nwho answered questions about how long it would take to notice a reversal (see section on\nexpectations). Participants knew that in exchange for free entrance they had to fill out a\n(1)The question mentioned the change of handedness for clarity, but we also replicated this pattern of\nexpectations from an additional sample of 35 people for whom the question was shorter and did not\nmention handedness.\n532 M Bertamini, C Bode, N Bruno\nFigure 2. Distribution of people's expectations about how long it would take to notice a left-right\nreversal. There are three scenarios: (a) world, (b) museum, and (c) film. The wording of the question\nis included in the panels. For the museum and the film a follow-up question asked to repeat the\nprediction assuming that the paintings or the film were familiar. Error bars are 95% confidence\nintervals for percentages.\nquestionnaire at the end, and they knew that this was part of a study. The questionnaire was\ndesigned to collect information about how much they liked the film overall and specifically\nabout the acting and the scenography. It also asked the level of engagement with the story,\nand space was provided for people to make comments on anything they had noticed about\nthe film. We collected information about sex, age, level of education, where they were sitting\nin the theatre, whether and when they had seen the film before, and whether they considered\nthemselves fans of Kurosawa. Given the importance of previous exposure for aesthetics (eg,\nCutting 2003), the difference between people who had seen the film before and those who\ndid not is particularly important.\nWe predicted that many people would not notice the reversal manipulation. This\nprediction was based on the fact that mirror images of objects have similar perceptual\neffects (eg, Biederman and Cooper 1991) and that people do not easily distinguish an original\npainting from its reversed image (Gordon and Gardner 1974; Bennett et al 2010), although\nthey do better when the paintings are highly familiar (Blount et al 1975). However, our study\nwas different from anything done before, and it is essential to measure the actual frequency\nof detection. In addition, judgments about the film's quality may depend on the reversal\ndespite the lack of awareness of the manipulation. In particular, we were interested in the\nquestion about scenography.\nThere were four screenings for four groups of observers. On Monday Yojimbo was shown in\nthe original orientation (N = 43) and Sanjuro was shown reversed (N = 36), and on Wednesday\nYojimbo was shown reversed (N = 50) and Sanjuro was shown in the original orientation (N =\n43). Yojimbo was always screened at 3:00 PM and Sanjuro at 6:30 PM. This choice meant that\ntime of day was confounded with film, but orientation and film as well as orientation and\ntime of day were balanced.\nNinety-three people watched Yojimbo, and seventy-nine watched Sanjuro. The majority were\nmales (66%), and age ranged from 16 to 74 with a mode of 20. Highest level of education was\nvaried, but a large proportion had a university degree (46%) or a doctorate (26%). A minority\n(19%) had seen the film before, but almost half of the participants (47%) answered yes to a\nquestion about whether they considered themselves a fan of Kurosawa.\n7.3 Stimuli and procedure\nThe cinema was located within the Foundation for Art and Creative Technology, a complex\nthat includes three cinema screens as well as art galleries. The theatre was small (10 m x 10\nm) and had a capacity of 50 people. The screen was 8 m wide. The image was of DVD quality,\nand the projector was a Christy Digital CP2000. Participants were permitted to choose a seat\nand were asked to complete the questionnaire after the film was shown.\nParticipants had to choose a value between 1 (terrible) and 9 (wonderful) on the following\nfour items: \"Overall the movie was\", \"The quality of the acting was\", \"The quality of the\nscenography (use of space, set, costume, lighting, etc) was\", and \"The performance of Toshiro\nMifune (main character) was\". The fifth question was about level of engagement, and the\nscale went from 1 (indifferent) to 9 (engaged). There was also an open question at the bottom\nof the page: \"A final open question: Is there anything else in particular you would like to tell\nus about the movie that you have just seen?\"\n534 M Bertamini, C Bode, N Bruno\n8.1 Detection of reversal\nApproximately half of the viewers (49%) wrote comments on the questionnaire in addition to\nanswering the questions, and many others talked with the experimenter after the screening.\nOnly two individuals wrote in their comments that they had noticed that the film was\nmirror reversed. One of them could speak Japanese and therefore reported that the Japanese\ncharacters were reversed. This puzzled her, but her comments were only relative to the text,\nnot the film itself. Only one person therefore genuinely detected the manipulation in the\nfilm. This person was a fan of Kurosawa who had not only seen the film but seen it repeatedly.\nShe was also in contact with the family of Toshir\u00af\no Mifune and carried with her a signed\nphotograph and a small container with some of his ashes. We excluded both individuals from\nthe subsequent analyses.\nThe almost total lack of detection of the reversal is remarkable. Except for the one\nindividual mentioned above, none of the people who had seen the film before or that\nclassified themselves as fans of Kurosawa detected that they were watching a film that\nwas different from what they had seen before; nor did they detect the fact that they were\nwatching a world populated mainly by left-handed people.\nNext we consider the four separate aspects of the film that viewers judged. Given that we\nhad only four screenings in total, reversal, film, and day of the week could not be completely\ncrossed in the design. In all the analyses reported we included reversal (original or reversed)\nand film (Yojimbo or Sanjuro) as factors, but analyses performed with reversal and day of\nthe week as factors produced exactly the same pattern of significant results. Mean scores are\nshown in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Mean rating values on the questionnaire items as a function of whether viewers had seen the\nfilm before. Errors bars are 1 SEM.\n8.2 Overall impression of the film\nThe first question was about the overall rating of the film. Perhaps unsurprisingly ratings\nwere, in general, high. The mean was 7.32 on a 9-point Likert scale.\nWe performed an ANOVA with the following factors: Film (Yojimbo or Sanjuro), Reversal\n(original or reversed), Exposure (the group who had seen the film before and the group who\nhad not), and Sex. The only significant effect was exposure: people who had seen the film\nThis effect is likely to be a selection phenomenon: all but one of those who had seen the\nfilm before claimed also to be fans of Kurosawa. It is also possible that in addition to the\nselection issue, there was an effect of previous exposure. To test that possibility, we selected\nthe subset of people who were fans (N = 80). Within this group only 30 (37%) had seen the\nfilm, and we compared the fans that had seen the film before with the fans that had not. We\nreasoned that for a fan of Kurosawa seeing a film that they had not yet seen should be a treat\nand therefore they should give higher scores (and nobody in either group was disappointed\ngiven the high scores). Conversely, if seeing a film that one has seen before is the important\nfactor, then the previously exposed group should have the higher score. The latter was the\nfactor.\nThere were two questions about acting, one about the whole film (\"The quality of the acting\")\nand one about Mifune (\"The performance of Toshiro Mifune\"); the means were 7.04 and\n8.02, respectively. The latter value is the highest mean for all questions and is close to ceiling\non the 9-point scale.\nWe performed a mixed ANOVA with the following factors: Question (overall or Mifune),\nFilm (Yojumbo or Sanjuro), Reversal (original or reversed), Exposure (the group who had seen\nthe film before and the group who had not), and Sex. There was a difference between the two\nexposure was in the same direction for both questions (higher values from people who had\nseen the film before). Therefore, the results relative to acting show something similar to the\nresults on overall impression of the film.\nAs discussed in the introduction, because of the existing literature on effects of spatial\ncomposition for paintings, this was the question we were most interested in. We performed an\nANOVA with the following factors: Film (Yojimbo or Sanjuro), Reversal (original or reversed),\nExposure (the group who had seen the film before and the group who had not), and Sex.\nThere were no significant main effects, but there was an interaction between Reversal and\nAs we have seen in the analysis of the overall quality of the film and the acting, viewers who\nhave seen the film before tend to rate the film higher. However, in the case of scenography\nthose who had seen the film before gave a higher rating only to the original version, the effect\nof previous exposure was absent for the reversed version (Figure 4).\nTo find further support for a role of previous exposure, we reasoned that any effect of\nexposure should weaken over a long period of time. We used the information about when the\nfilm had been seen and used the median to split the previously exposed group into two new\ngroups: those who had seen the film within the last 5 years and those who had seen the film\nmore than 5 years ago. Overall, the means for the two groups did not differ (t(20.94) = -1.83,\nns). Interestingly, the effect of exposure was present for the first group (t(13.87) = 2.45, p\nexposure is linked with higher ratings for the original version, even though none of these\nviewers detected the reversal.\n536 M Bertamini, C Bode, N Bruno\nFigure 4. Mean rating values for the question relative to the scenography as a function of whether\nviewers had seen the film before and separately for the original and the reversed versions. Error bars\nare 1 SEM.\nWe performed an ANOVA with the following factors: Film (Yojimbo or Sanjuro), Reversal\n(original or reversed), Exposure (the group who had seen the film before and the group who\ndid not), and Sex. There were no significant main effects or interactions.\nIt is interesting to analyse briefly the information about where in the cinema people were\nsitting. One may expect that higher ratings would be associated with sitting near the centre,\nand therefore more in line with the projector. We coded the five aisles from -2 on the right\n(near the entrance) to 2 on the left and plotted mean scores as a function of aisles. These plots\ndisplayed a symmetrical distribution with a peak near the centre. We performed an ANOVA\nfor each of the questions and looked for evidence of a quadratic trend. For the questions\ntheir seats in the theatre, there are two possible explanations for the higher scores near the\ncentre. The first is that people who are more interested in the film sit in the middle, and the\nsecond is that people who sit in the middle have a better experience. We cannot separate\nthese two in our study, but what is important is to check that location in the theatre was\nnot confounded with previous exposure. If it were the case that people who had seen the\nfilm before tend to sit in the centre of the theatre, then the fact that they give higher scores\nmay not necessarily depend on previous exposure but simply on where they were sitting.\nTherefore, we compared the location (as coded in terms of aisles) for the two groups (those\nwho had seen the film before and those who had not). There was no significant difference\nbetween the two groups in terms of location to the left or the right (t(166) =-0.34, ns) or in\nterms of eccentricity (aisles were recoded for eccentricity by removing the sign) (t(166) =\n-0.61, ns). Therefore, the higher ratings from people who had seen the film before, which\nwas discussed earlier, are unlikely to be an indirect consequence of where the viewers were\nsitting.\n10 Replication with short clips\nWe conducted a study in Italy to replicate and extend the basic finding. We selected two\n5 min clips from Yojimbo (A and B) that were similar in content (they both begun with an\ninterior scene, relatively rich in dialogue, and ended with a combat scene, rich in action). We\nrecruited four groups of 120 students each from four undergraduate courses at the University\nof Parma. One group saw clip A (original orientation), then clip B (reversed); one saw clip A\n(reversed), then clip B (original); one saw clip B (original), then clip A (reversed); and one saw\nclip B (reversed), then clip A (original). Afterwards, participants were required to compare\nthe two clips. Specifically, a questionnaire asked them to rate how much they preferred the\nscenography of the second clip over the first using a nine point scale. They were also given\nan open question as in the Liverpool study. One interesting aspect of this study was the\nabsence of subtitles. In the Liverpool study participants may have paid less attention to the\nimages if they concentrated on reading them. In this control study we used the Japanese\nsoundtrack with no subtitles. Consistent with the earlier study, none of the participants\nreported noticing that one clip was reversed. With respect to the role of familiarity, out of 480\nparticipants, only 2 reported having seen the film before. For this reason, a comparison with\nthe main study is impossible, although, interestingly, these two students reported preferring\nthe scenography of the original version over that of the reversed one. An ANOVA with factors\nClip (A or B), Version (original or reversed), and Sex revealed an overall preference for clip A\ntwo clips were compared directly against each other's, the reversal was not noticed.\nOur study revealed unequivocally that it is possible to watch a film mirror reversed without\nnoticing the reversal, and with similar levels of engagement. One person noticed the reversal\nof the Japanese characters, and one noticed the reversal in the images, but everybody else\nfailed to report the reversal. On the one hand, it is true that we did not ask explicitly whether\nthe images were reversed, and therefore cannot claim that people would have been at chance\nonce asked. On the other hand, participants knew that they were part of a study and knew that\nthe event was organised by researchers from the University of Liverpool, and they were on\naverage highly educated. Both Yojimbo and Sanjuro lasted more than 1.5 hours, and during\nthis time viewers watched a world of left-handed people without detecting that this was\nunusual. In addition to the change in handedness, a few other aspects of the modified images\nmight have looked wrong, specifically the asymmetry in facial expressions, the folding of the\nclothes, how swords were carried, and the direction of lighting and movement, as discussed\nin the introduction. These are all subtle changes but together they add to a considerable\namount of information. In a similar study in Italy two clips were directly compared (one of\nthem reversed), and even this direct comparison did not lead to detection of the reversal.\nThis lack of detection may be related to the fact that when viewing a film, the viewer is\nengaged with a story, and that such a story is unaffected by mirror reversal. A separate group\nof people judged how quickly they would notice a left-right reversal of the world, pictures in\na museum, or a film. A majority predicted that it would take less than an hour to notice the\nreversal in each of the three scenarios. In the case of a film this expectation was not matched\nby people's actual performance in our study.\n538 M Bertamini, C Bode, N Bruno\nAlmost one participant in five had seen the film before, and almost half (47%) declared\nthemselves fans of Kurosawa. Nevertheless, with the exception of one individual, having seen\nthe film before or being familiar with the work of Kurosawa did not make it easier for the\nviewer to notice that the film was different. For instance, even though Mifune is a famous\nactor and many viewers would have been familiar with his roles in many of Kurosawa's films,\nit did not matter whether he was right handed (original version) or left handed (reversed\nversion).\nThe choice of films by Kurosawa allowed us to test films from a famous and highly admired\ndirector, but it also had the advantage that the setting in 19th-century Japan meant that there\nwere no cars and no Roman alphabet writing in the images. Detection of inversion for words\nis a special case, and we consciously designed our study to avoid this aspect. Instead we were\ninterested in reversal of the image, and therefore the change in composition. This aspect was\ntargeted specifically by the question on scenography.\nThe ratings of the quality of the scenography (defined as the use of space, set, costume,\nand lighting) for the original version or reversed version differed as a function of previous\nexperience; only the viewers who had seen the film before rated the original more highly\nthan they did the reversed. The phenomenon of mere exposure (Zajonc 1968) can help to\ninterpret this finding. It is known that observers prefer stimuli that they have seen before even\nthough they do not remember them (eg, Seamon et al 1995; Johnson et al 1985). However, our\nsituation is different and unique. Participants did remember having seen the film; what they\ndid not remember was the orientation of the images. We found that people who had seen\nthe film before reported liking the scenography more than people who had not seen the film\nbefore, but only when the film was shown in the original orientation (even though they did\nnot consciously recognise that the reversed version was different). We interpret this finding\nas evidence of a composition-specific exposure effect. This interpretation is supported by\nthe fact that the preference for the original version in people who had seen the film before\nwas specific to people who had seen the film relatively recently (in the past 5 years). However,\ngiven the limited sample size of the subgroup of observers who had seen the film before, this\nissue does need further research.\nStudying the experience of watching a film in a cinema is challenging but rewarding.\nPeople who come to a cinema are a sample from a population of people with an interest in\nfilms (and specifically with an interest in the works of Kurosawa in our case) and therefore\nmore diverse than participants recruited within the university community. Finally, questions\nabout the role of asymmetric biases in visual art as well as questions about the role of previous\nexposure can be tackled, and our study is hopefully the first of many.\n"
