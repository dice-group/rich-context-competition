    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article focuses on religion and the embeddedness in civil society. We examine the relationship between religion and\nnational identity (ethnic and civic). Our findings show that individual religiosity continues to play an important role in\nsustaining both forms of national identity. In addition to other studies, we examine the relationship between religion as a\nsocietal phenomenon and individual national identity and find the following: The stronger the relationship between state\nand religion, the stronger the ethnic identity; the more the religious homogeneity, the stronger the ethnic identity; and\nthere is no relationship between aggregated degree of religious organizations and identity. We conclude that religion\ncontinues to play a major role in the making of civil society, but the specific circumstances vary according to the religious\nrepresentation. In other words, religion can both make and unmake national identity.\n",

It\ncan't be the case that living on this ground is good-in-itself;\nthere isn't any other place to live. What is true is that the\nquality of our political and economic activity and of our\nnational culture is intimately connected to the strength and\nvitality of our associations. Ideally, civil society is a setting of\nsettings: all are included, none is preferred.\nReligion as a Way of Understanding Civil\nSociety\nFor a long time, the sociology of religion has suggested, on\none hand, that religion supports social cohesion through\nshared symbols, rituals, norms, and networks (Fukuyama,\ntranscend boundaries constituted by factors such as ethnic\nother hand, it tends to be exclusive to those who are not part\nof the dominant congregation(s) (Bohn & Hahn, 2002;\nWe argue that religion--despite a longstanding\ndiscussion on the secularization of European societies--still\nis a constituent factor shaping affiliations as well as\ncleavages within European civil societies through creating\nand sustaining national identity. We examine religion as a\nmultilevel phenomenon that comprises individual\nreligiousness but is also embedded in the institutional and\ncultural setting of countries. While on the individual level,\nreligiosity still effects feelings of affiliation to larger\ncommunities, religion as longstanding shared belief systems\nis inscribed into political institutions, cultural frameworks\nand social inequalities on the country level (e.g., Mau,\nreligion influences individual perceptions, attitudes and\nactions.\nIn this article, we are interested in how religion on\ndifferent societal levels affects individual feelings of\nnational identity. More precisely, we want to know whether\nand how religion especially as a societal phenomenon\n(state\u00adreligion relationship, religious homogeneity, and\naggregate membership in religious organizations) affects\ncivic and ethnic national identity on the individual level.\nWe are interested in how religious institutions matter for\nindividual feelings of affiliation to a larger (national)\ncommunity.\nSocial Cohesion, Religion, and National\nIdentity--A Close but Not Too Close\nRelationship\nThe article's question gains its relevance mainly from the\nsociology of religion and from national identity research. So\nfar, both strands have generated a large body of literature\n1Bergische Universit\u00e4t Wuppertal, Germany\n2 Ume\u00e5 Universitet, Sweden\nCorresponding Author:\nAnnette Schnabel, Bergische Universit\u00e4t Wuppertal, Fachbereich G,\nEmail: aschnabe@uni-wuppertal.de\nsgo.sagepub.com\n2 SAGE Open\nand established a longstanding tradition in focusing on\nsocietal inclusion and exclusion as factors in the social\ncohesion of civil societies.\nWhen it comes to social cohesion, the theory of civil\nsocieties draws attention to two main aspects of modern\ndemocratic societies. First, civil societies are often seen as\nproviders of important conditions for civic engagement and\nthe social space to articulate, negotiate, and organize the\ninterests of citizens. In so doing, they help to maintain and\nlegitimize democracy and redistributive governmental\npolicies (e.g., Putnam, 1995). Civil societies inhere this\ncapacity by their ability to generate and distribute social\ncapital including trust, the willingness to contribute to the\ncommon good, and the morale of reciprocity on the\nSocial capital can be understood as the \"instantiated\ninformal norm that promotes cooperation between two or\nmore individuals\" (Fukuyama, 2001, p. 7). It assures social\ncommunity through shared basic cooperative orientations\non the individual level. The production of social capital\ndepends on volunteer organizations, associations, and\ngroups, which empower people to fight their causes--even\nagainst powerful governments. Keane (2006, p. vii) defines\ncivil society as \"the community of associations, initiatives,\nmovements and networks.\" Second, civil societies not only\ncreate and sustain cohesion but are also still shaped by\ncleavages, political inequalities, and differences in the\naccess to resources and social positions. Such cleavages are\nmarked by group-related boundaries between \"us\" and\n\"them\"; it facilitates economic and social inclusion and\nexclusion and, thereby, different chances of political\nparticipation and of becoming an active community\nmember. It seems that as individuals become involved in\nsmaller communities characterized by interests and\nlifestyle, they interact less with people who are different,\nwhich affects inclusion negatively (e.g., Welch, Sikkink, &\nIn the following, we understand civil society as\ngenerated from individual social capital--its cohesion\nresults from (aggregated) individual feelings of affiliation to\na larger community.1 We, thereby, follow Coleman's\npostulation of methodological-individualistic explanations\nin social science (Coleman, 1994) stating that systemic or\nsocietal phenomena have to be explained through\nexplanatory mechanisms on the micro level: While the\nexplanandum has to be on the macro level (in this case\nsocial cohesion of the country), the explanation itself should\nbe carried out on the level of its components (individuals\nand their attachments). We are interested in how religion\ninfluences such feelings and thereby creates, sustains, or\nchanges cleavages within European civil societies.\nReligion and Civil Society: Cohesion or Disjointedness?\nThe relationships between individuals, communities, and\ncivil society become especially complex when religion is\ninvolved. The integrative impact of religion has been\non this relationship. For Durkheim, religion provided the\nnecessary norms, meanings, rites and symbols and the\nopportunity structure that facilitate interpersonal attachment\nand, thereby, solidarity and social cohesion. More recent\nresearch argues that despite trends of secularisation,2 there\nstill is a positive correlation between religious membership,\nbeliefs, and practices on the one hand and social capital and\nintegration on the other. Religiousness seems to lead to a\ndecline in delinquency (e.g., Hirschi & Stark, 1969; Stark,\nBjarnason, 1998), and it increases social capital, as\nsources of social capital that may be more effective in\npromoting civil society. The first is religion\" (see also\nreligiousness seems to support the homogenizing and\nintegrating effect of civil societies.\nNevertheless, religion has also been proven to have\nexclusionary powers against those who are not part of the\ncongregations, churches, or communities in power: That is,\nthe religiously induced trust does not necessarily encompass\nall citizens and religion may add to \"bonding\" within\ninstead of \"bridging\" between societal groups (Welch,\nas it integrates, religion may operate as a marker of group\nboundaries between \"us\" and \"them\" and thereby facilitate\ncohesion within the religious at the expense of the exclusion\nof nonbelievers, people of other denominations or different\nvalue systems (e.g., Bohn & Hahn, 2002; Gross & Ziebertz,\nreligion is limited to only certain parts of society and\nengenders cleavages that can result in discrimination\ndetrimental to the exercising of civil rights. On the\nEuropean level, it has been argued that in particular Islam\nbecame the most prominent religious \"other\" over the last\ntwo decades while a-confessional people are barely\ndiscriminated against:\nThe first open, if not yet formal discussions of Turkey's\ncandidacy during the 2002 Copenhagen summit touches a raw\nnerve among all kinds of European \"publics.\" The widespread\ndebate revealed how much Islam with all its distorted\nrepresentations as \"the other\" of western civilisation was a real\nissue rather than the extent to which Turkey was ready to meet\nthe same stringent economic and political conditions as all\nother new members. (Casanova, 2006, p. 70; see also Gerhards,\nReligion as a Multilevel Phenomenon\nIt is not only the concurrent inclusive and exclusive effect\nof religion that constitutes the complexity of its relationship\nto social cohesion: Religion is a multilevel phenomenon\nthat comprises more than just the level of individual\nreligiosity. On the different societal levels, religion can be\nHjerm and Schnabel 3\nexpected to develop different kinds of influence on social\ncohesion.\n(a) Theories of civil society and social capital call our\nattention to religious organizations, community work, and\nstructures, similar to other forms of civic engagement, have\nthe power to create general social capital: \"The social\ncapital generated by religious structures supports not only\nformal religious volunteering but `secular' volunteering as\nhowever, an open question as to whether other civil society\norganizations create social capital in a similar way or if\nreligious organizations are organizations of a special kind.\nReligious organizations provide particular norm systems\nand opportunity structures, but unions, sports clubs, or\nsocial movement initiatives may serve as functional\nequivalents in providing opportunity structures for civic\nengagement and the production of social capital (e.g.,\nPutnam, 1995). (b) Religion also develops its influence\nthrough communal beliefs and shared systems of meanings,\nmorals, and values that have the power to engage members'\nallegiance through interpretations, norms and sanctions. In\nthis way, religion shapes the understanding of civicness\nwithin a society and what constitutes acceptable social\nbehavior. (c) Religion as an ideological system (as well as\nits absenteeism) is manifested within governmental\nstructures as constitutions5 and welfare policies (e.g.,\nSuch shared systems of understandings, customs,\nregulations, and laws manifest themselves potentially on the\nlevel of smaller regional communities, nation-states, or\nlarger cross-border collectives such as the EU (e.g.,\nFor the following analysis, we focus on societal aspects\nof religion on the country level as research evidence on this\nlevel is mainly qualitative and quantitative studies are still\nmissing. The theoretical reason lies in the close relationship\nbetween the nation-state and religion in Europe. On one\nhand, national constitutions and policy systems are said to\nmirror Christian social teaching and are understood as the\nmanifest result of conflicts between different religious and\npolitical groups over history (e.g., Knippenberg, 2006;\nnational educational systems are major transmitters (and\nhomogenizers) of ideological and cultural perspectives and\nunderstandings (e.g., classical: Gellner, 1983) and the state\u00ad\nreligion relationship is highly significant for religious\npractices (Fox & Flores, 2009). Distinguishing between\nsuch country-specific characteristics allows taking diverse\ngovernmental settings into account.\nReligion, as a contextual phenomenon, has the potential\nto influence people's attitudes and behavior. However, we\ncan expect the influence of religion as a contextual\nphenomenon to vary according to the type of religious\ncontext. Both the way and the degree to which religion is\nintertwined in civic societies vary across these societies. We\nfocus on the effects of three different aspects of religion as\na contextual phenomenon, namely, the institutional\ninterplay between the state and religion, the organizational\ndegree and the actual degree of religious heterogeneity on\nthe contextual level.\nNation, Religion, and Civil Societies\nWhy national identity--again? To Calhoun (1993), national\nidentity is \"one genre of answers to the question of what\nconstitutes an autonomous political community capable of\nself-determination\" (p. 387). Such communities always\nconsist of individuals who identify themselves with other\n(alleged) similar minded people. National identity is first\nand foremost a trait of individuals. Only aggregated, it can\nbecome a property of collectives (Hjerm, 1998; Hjerm &\nconstitutes a basis for the trust among those who are\nconsidered \"similar.\" Therefore, if we are interested in\ncountry-specific degrees of social cohesion of civil societies\n(and their changes), we have to consider individual\nperceptions, beliefs, attitudes, and actions.\nIn contrast to other concepts of social cohesion (e.g.,\n\"generalized trust\"), national identity provides an\nobjectivation for individual identification.6 Although the\nimagined community of the nation most often unites around\nunderspecified ideas of similarity that may change over\ntime, the nation constitutes an intentional object toward\nwhich people orient their imaginations, feelings,\nunderstandings, and actions. Nations form a \"community,\nbecause, regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation\nthat may prevail in each, the nation is always conceived as a\ndeep horizontal comradeship\" (Anderson, 1983, p. 7). This\ncomradeship constitutes a social fact, in the Durkheimian\nsense, that has the power to rebuke people to overcome\ntheir egoistic individual interests. National identity--as\nrealized by individuals--embraces the emotional dimension\nof loyalty, affiliation, and commitment that is far more\nspecific than general trust because it is rooted in\nassumptions of similarities (whatever these assumptions are\nbased on). With such central characteristics of identification\nand shared belonging, continuity, and stability, national\nidentity in its aggregated form can serve as a proxy for--a\nspecial aspect of--social cohesion (e.g., Easterly, Ritzen, &\nNational identity is part of individual identity formation\nindividuals to understand who they are in relation to others.\nNational identity gains power by providing a clear\ndistinction between \"us\" and \"them,\" or as Triandafyllidou\n(1998) states, \"The nation thus has to be understood as a\npart of a dual relationship rather than as an autonomous,\nself-contained unit\" (p. 594). This relationship exists\nirrespective of whether those \"others\" are situated within or\noutside the state borders. It establishes an inclusive but yet\nexclusive aspect of civil societies (some even argue that this\n4 SAGE Open\naspect especially is a necessary precondition for the\nlegitimacy and acceptance of governments; for example,\n1997). National identity contributes to becoming part of a\ngroup relating to a particular territory with clear-cut yet\nnegotiable borders.\nThere are two well-established dimensions of national\ndimension is characterized by ascribed/objective features\nsuch as country of birth or common ancestry. The\ncivic/voluntaristic dimension includes a community\nreferring to laws and institutions, a shared political will,\nequal rights for members of the nation, and a minimum of\ncommon values, traditions, or a sentiment. Empirically,\nthey refer to two different dimensions of attachment that are\nrealized at the same time rather than two mutually exclusive\ncategories. Consequently, the population of countries can\nexhibit different aggregated strengths of national identity\nand the two dimensions can be mixed in different ways\nexpected that different types of national identity are more\nprevalent in certain countries than in others.\nNational identity gives one possible and quite exclusive\nanswer to the question of \"who are the people?\" that differs\nfrom the answer of governmental citizenship rules. The\nimagined community of the nation concurs with the citizens\nof the state (only) when nation and state coincide\n(Barrington, 1997). Often, however, nation and state are not\nidentical, as in Belgium, the United Kingdom, or Spain.\nFor the following analysis, we understand national\nidentity as an individual attitude that in its aggregated form\nconstitutes the social cohesion of civil societies. By using\nthe two dimensions of national identity as measurements of\ntwo different facets of the social cohesion in civil societies,\nwe refer to a now-substantiated aspect of a community that\nrelates to a territory and that aims to realize political self-\ndetermination.\nWe expect religion to play an important role in creating\nand sustaining individual feelings of national identity.\nAccording to Durkheim's thesis of the integrative effect of\nreligion, we expect that individual religiosity supports\nnational identity (see also Jones & Smith, 2001). According\nto social capital theories, we expect a positive influence of\nactive membership and of a higher organizational degree of\nreligious organizations on the country level. The expected\neffects on religion as a societal phenomenon are unclear.\nCase study evidence suggests that a strong state\u00adreligion\nrelationship may support individual national identity, like in\nGreece or Ireland (e.g., Halikiopoulou, 2008), while the role\nthe state\u00adreligion relationship plays in forming (collective)\nidentities seems to depend on the stronghold of the religious\norganizations and on the discontinuities of political regimes\n(Jakelic, 2004). From normative political theory, we may\ngain the insight that (religious) heterogeneity might be\nperceived as threatening the community (e.g., Miller, 1993;\nWolfe & Klausen, 1997). However, systematic,\ncomparative evidence is missing; therefore, we treat our\nanalysis of the contextual aspects of religion as explorative.\nThe Model\nTo address the research question as to whether and, if so,\nhow religion influences individual national identities in\nEurope, comparative data on both religious affiliation and\nindividual national identity are needed. The European\nValues Study (EVS; Integrated Data Set ZA4800) is a\nlarge-scale, cross-national, survey research program that\nprovides insights into beliefs, preferences, attitudes, and\nvalues of citizens in Europe. It is the only comparative\nEuropean data set that includes questions concerning\npeople's religious beliefs, practices, and memberships as\nwell as a list of questions on national identity. For the\nfollowing analysis, we use the fourth wave of 2008, which\ncovers the total of the 27 European member states.\nWe used the questions Q80.A to Q80.E of the EVS to\nmeasure national identity:\nSome people say the following things are important for\nbeing truly [NATIONALITY]. Others say they are not\nimportant. How important do you think each of the\nfollowing is?\nQ80.A: To have been born in [COUNTRY]\nQ80.B: To respect [COUNTRY]'s political institutions\nand laws\nQ80.C: To have [COUNTRY]'s ancestry\nQ80.D: To be able to speak [THE NATIONAL\nQ80.E: To have lived for a long time in [COUNTRY]\nThe answers are coded between \"1\" and \"4\" where \"1\"\nindicates \"not important at all\" and \"4\" for \"very\nimportant.\" Although the list of questions comprises only\nfive of the original eight items previously used in analysis\nof ethnic and civic national identity (Hjerm, 1998; Jones &\nSmith, 2001), a factor analysis indicates that these five\nitems gather into two factors. The first factor comprises\nQ80.D. These factors are similar to previous studies and\ncorrespond to (a) \"ethnic national identity\" comprising\ncomprising Q80.B and Q80.D. For our analysis, we use the\nfactor scores for each dimension. The ethnic dimension of\nnational identity mirrored in these questions emphasize the\ntwo aspects of time and space and refer to the individual\nbeing part of the autochthonous population, while the civic\ndimension comprises of feeing bound to institutions.\nContextual Level Variables\nTo tap into religion at the country level, we use three\ndifferent measures. First, we include the institutional\ncooperation between the state and religion. We therefore\nHjerm and Schnabel 5\nuse the mode of the state\u00adreligion relationship from the\nState-and-Religion Data Set by Fox (2004). These data\ndescribe the intersection between state and religion\nmonitoring governmental policies in favor of or against\nchurches, religious groups, and congregations worldwide.\nWe include a measurement of the official state\u00adreligion\nrelationship indicating whether a government has hostile\n(0), inadvertent intense (1), separatist (2), accommodative\n(3), supportive (4), cooperative (5) relationships or a civil\nreligion (6), or a state religion (7). These variables refer to\nthe degree of governmental secularization--The closer the\nrelation, the less is the degree of secularization.7 Second, we\nmeasure the countries' religious homogeneity to capture the\nsocietal religious context (the Herfindahl-Index for\nreligious heterogeneity is calculated from aggregated EVS\ndata).8 Because social capital theories consider volunteer\norganizations, associations, and groups to be important for\nsocial capital and therefore for social integration, we, third,\nincluded the degree of religious and nonreligious\norganizations. For this country-specific organizational\ndegree, we use the percentage of people per country who\nare members of religious organizations and of nonreligious\norganizations. Nonreligious organizations include social\norganizations, political organizations, and leisure\norganizations.\nWe control for the national economic situation\noperationalized by gross domestic product (GDP), social\nspending, and unemployment rate (all Eurostat data from\n2007). These data are indicators of the distributive situation\nwithin the country and its comparative wealth. They refer to\nthe redistributive and thereby secular aspects of societal\nintegration. In addition, we controlled for percentage of\nimmigrants (Eurostat data) and for language fractionalization\n(Alesina, Devleeschauwer, Easterly, Kurlat, & Wacziarg,\n2003). They refer to \"cultural\" cleavages in societies and\nhave been shown to influence national identities in previous\nresearch (e.g., Hjerm & Schnabel, 2010). To avoid ending up\nwith a \"basket model\" of all possible influences on national\nidentity, we did not consider external, non\u00adreligion-related\nfactors to the nation-state such as globalization (Hall, 1997),\npost-industrialization (Inglehart, 1997), or the involvement in\nmilitary conflicts (Boehnke, Kindervater, Baier, & Rippl,\nIndividual-Level Variables\nIndividual religiousness is differentiated into belonging to a\ndenomination (Roman Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox,\nother, and none, coded as dummy variables) and intensity of\nindividual religiousness. To analyze whether the latter plays\na role in forming national identities, we created a multiplied\nindicator \"intensity\" from the frequency of church\nattendance (Q26) and the importance of God in everyday\nlife (Q36).9 The indicator is standardized between 0 and 1\nand captures individual religious behavior as well as the\nintensity of the belief.10\nIn accordance with social capital theory, we want to\nknow whether individual membership in civil society\norganizations influences feelings of national identity. We\ntherefore created indicators for the individual membership\nin religious, social, professional, and leisure organizations.11\nFor sociodemographic control variables we included the\nrespondents' sex, age, year of completed education, the\nannual household income, the political left\u00adright self-\nassessment and their general trust in others. Although we\nare not especially interested in the effects of these variables,\nwe control for them to ensure that variances in the\ndependent variables are not due to their influence and that\nthe country-specific differences in trust do not depend on\ntheir country-specific distributions.\nThe Multilevel Approach\nAlthough the article is about the social cohesion of civil\nsocieties, we are, strictly speaking, interested in whether\n(religious) institutions matter for individual attitudes and\naffiliations. This is because--following Coleman's research\nprogram--we consider the degree of the social cohesion of\na civil society as aggregated from individual affiliations and\nattitudes. In our interest in the feedback-effects of\ninstitutions,12 we consider individuals as nested within\nlarger institutional contexts--in this case: within countries.\nHox and Kreft (1994) stated that \"[i]t is important to note\nthat individuals and the social contexts in which they live\ncan be viewed as a hierarchical system of individuals and\ngroups, with individuals and groups defined at separate\nlevels of this hierarchical system\" (p. 284).\nStatistically, such multilevel problems cannot be solved\nsimply by generalizing results from one level to another\n(Robertson, 1950). While wrong translations from a higher\n(macro)level to a lower (micro)level bear the risk of\necological fallacy because unobserved, intervening\ninfluences of higher-level properties can interrupt the\nrelationship found on the individual micro level, atomistic\nfallacies are committed when correlations on the individual\n(average) level are wrongly generalized to the higher\n(country) level.13 Besides the theoretical focus on the\nfeedback-effects of institutions on individual-level national\nfeelings and affiliations, statistically, the analysis of\naggregated country-averages of national identity runs the\nrisk disregarding the individual-level covariances and may\nlead to wrong conclusions about the underlying\nmechanisms.\nBecause we take country-level properties into\nconsideration and because we assume that individual\nattitudes vary systematically according to these properties, a\nmultilevel analysis (MLA) is the method of choice (Hox,\n1995). This method is explicitly designed to avoid wrong-\nlevel fallacies and even if country characteristics are not\nexplicitly tested, MLA provides the means to control for\ndifferences in country-specific distributions of individual\ncharacteristics (Steenbergen & Jones, 2002). We use\n6 SAGE Open\nmultilevel regression that is, effectively, an ordinary least\nsquare regression (OLS-regression) which can handle\nnested sources of variability such as individuals in nation-\nstates. Multilevel regression performs better than OLS-\nregression if macro variables are included. The variation\nwithin the dependent variable is due to two sources of\nvariation: variation within groups and between groups. If a\nsingle-level model is performed, the assumption of\nindependency of the error terms is violated because\nobservations within a group can be expected to be more\nsimilar than between groups, and standard errors are\nminor problem is that the number (N) of included countries\nthat if N is equal to or greater than 10, a random intercept\nmodel is preferable to a fixed model of regression analysis.\nThe Religious and National Landscape of Europe\nFirst, descriptive analyses of the EVS data indicate that the\nreligious and national landscapes of Europe look quite\ndiverse (Figures 1 and 2).\nThere are very few countries with a single clearly\ndominant majority denomination: Only Denmark has a\nProtestant majority larger than 75%, indicating that the\nProtestant North is less homogeneous than suggested. The\nCatholic monoconfessional bloc with more than 75%\nCatholics consists of Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Malta,\nLithuania, Poland, and the Slovak Republic. Classical\nrepresentatives like Spain are not in this group. Greece,\nCyprus, and Romania are countries dominated by an\nOrthodox majority. Estonia and the Czech Republic have a-\nconfessional majorities that are close to 70%.\nIt is important to note that the European member states\nare characterized quite differently concerning their\npopulation's average values of the two dimensions of ethnic\nand civic national identity. In most of the countries, ethnic\nand civic national identities identified are in fact opposite\ndimensions. Only in Great Britain, Malta, Cyprus, and\nSlovenia both have a positive value. On average, ethnic\nnational identity shows a higher (positive and negative)\nintensity than its civic counterpart. Cyprus, Bulgaria, Malta,\nPoland, and Romania score quite highly with regard to\nethnic national identity, while Sweden, Spain, France, and\nDenmark show a high average score of civic national\nidentity. The data so far confirm earlier findings by Hjerm\nconstitute two different dimensions of national identity and\nthat their combination varies across countries.\nThe Multi-Level Analysis\nBecause these average data on the country level\ndisguises what is going on at the individual level, we\nperformed a MLA. This MLA showed that country-level\nproperties matter for variances in national identities: The\nempty model (not reported here) shows that 15.5% of the\ntotal variance in ethnic national identity can be attributed\nto differences on the country level, while country\ndifferences are responsible for 10.4% of the variance in\ncivic national identity. As the relatively small number of\ncases allow for only a restricted number of influencing\nvariables, we eliminated variables from the analysis if\nthey did not show significant influence and included the\nmacro-level variables stepwise.\nBecause we are not interested in general individual\ninfluences on national identity, we are not commentating\nextensively on the individual control variables. They do\nnot show any irregularities and are in line with former\nresearch on national identity (e.g., Jones & Smith, 2001):\nAfter controlling for country differences, women do not\ndiffer significantly from men regarding their ethnic and\ncivic national identity, while age, education, a right-wing\nself-assessment and a higher general trust increase both\ntypes.\nConcerning individual religiosity, the models show that,\ncompared with a-confessional persons, Catholics and\nProtestants feature a higher degree of both types of national\nidentity, while being a member of the Orthodox Church has\na strong negative impact. The group of \"other religious\nmemberships\" is too heterogeneous and too small to be\nmeaningfully interpreted. However, we can assume that\nmembership of a religious diaspora makes it harder to feel\nattached particularly to the ethnic dimension of national\nidentity. Although the impact of religious denomination is\nstraightforward in principle, there are some interesting\ndetails: Catholicism and Protestantism both have a stronger\nimpact on ethnic than on civic national identity and\nProtestants have a stronger affiliation to civic national\nidentity than Catholics. The negative impact of Orthodoxy\non both forms of national identity can be explained by the\nRussian minorities in the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and\nLithuania) who do not develop a national identity in their\nhost countries (cf. van Meur, 1999). They constitute a large\nenough minority in the sample of the EVS that is\nstatistically responsible for a strong negative effect. This\neffect is not compensated by a weak positive impact of the\northodox people living in countries with an orthodox\nIndependently of the denomination, intensity of\nindividual religiosity increases both ethnic and civic\nnational identity, with the increase for the latter being\nlarger. Being a member of a religious organization increases\nthe civic national identity (Model C5, Table 2), while it is\nnot important for the ethnic dimension (Model E6, Table 1).\nBeing a member of a social organization, however, affects\nthis dimension significantly. All in all, the results on the\nindividual level indicate that individual religiosity continues\nto play an important role in national identity formation in\nEurope and that--in accordance with social capital\ntheory--national identity is influenced by membership in\ncivil society organizations.\nHjerm and Schnabel 7\nFigure 1. Religious landscape of Europe (denominational distribution per EU-member-state in 2008).\nFigure 2. Aggregate national identity per country in Europe (ethnic and civic national identity per EU-member-state in 2008).14\nThe models E2 to E5 and C2 to C5 test for country\nspecifics. Concerning the social policy-related control\nvariables on this level, only the country's GDP shows a\nsignificant influence16 on ethnic and civic national identity;\nwhile the social policy-related indicators of secularity social\nspending and unemployment rate had no significant effect.17\nIn addition, neither the share of immigrants nor language\nfractionalization shows any significant impact.18 Insofar as\nthe GDP indicates the wealth of the nation-state, we might\nconclude that the state's wealth supports a strengthening\neffect on individual feelings of national identity.\nWhile, on the individual level, religiosity influences both\nethnic and civic national identities in quite similar ways, the\ncountry-specific religious contexts have a different impact\non each dimension. Looking at the state\u00adreligion\nrelationship, we find that the stronger the relationship is, the\nstronger the ethnic identity (if the tie between state and\nreligion improves by one unit, ethnic national identity\nincreases by almost 0.2 factor scores),19 whereas civic\nidentity is not affected by the general state\u00adreligion\nrelationship at all.\n8 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

At the same time, civic identity is not affected by the\ncountry's degree of religious pluralism. While religious\nhomogeneity can be related to societally shared systems of\nmeanings, beliefs, morals, and values, the organizational\ndegree of a country refers to networks and opportunity\nstructures. The organizational degree of religious\norganizations affects neither ethnic nor civic national\nidentity in a significant way. The organizational degree of\nother civic society organizations, however, influences\nethnic national identity negatively and strengthens civic\nnational identity.\nThe results of the MLA provided a systematic analysis\nof religion as a context for individual national identities.\nNot only individual religiosity but also religious\ninstitutions and religious heterogeneity on the country\nlevel continue to play a significant role in creating,\nsustaining, and shaping such identities. All over Europe,\nthe state\u00adreligion relationship, the religious context, and\nthe organizational degree are important for feelings of\nnational affiliation. These factors, however, affect the two\ndimensions of national identity, the ethnic and the civic,\nin quite different ways, indicating that the two\ndimensions in fact relate to different mechanisms of\nidentity formation.\nCivil Society, Government, and Religion--\nDiscussion of the Results\nThe results show that religion and national identities in\nEurope are still interlinked. The analysis indicates,\nhowever, that it is important to treat religion as a\nmultilevel phenomenon whose influences reaches beyond\nthe level of individual religiosity. Especially, when the\nfeeling of social inclusion into the civil society is in\nfocus, it is important to take individual beliefs and\npractices but also memberships and the institutional and\nsocietal contexts in which they flourish into account. Our\ncomparative perspective makes it possible to consider\nthese factors and it revealed that different dynamics\nbetween religion and national identification take place in\nEurope. The analyses help to understand that it is not the\nnation-state as such, but particular--in this case,\nreligion-related--contextual factors that shape individual\nnational identities.20\nIndependently of country-specific differences,\nindividual religious beliefs and actions are important for\nboth dimensions of national identity. Compared with a-\nconfessional people, Catholics and Protestants have\nstronger feelings of both kinds of national identity, with\nProtestants being even more strongly tied to the nation\nthan Catholics, while Orthodox believers and people of\nother denominations have weaker national feelings. It\nseems that secularization on the individual level--at\nleast with regards to Protestantism and Catholicism in\nEurope--weakens national identity with a stronger\nimpact on its ethnic component and thereby affects\nnegatively the aspect of social cohesion that concerns\nautochthony.\nOur models suggest that, in principle, national identity\nin Europe does not overwrite religious cleavages but\nseems to follow them. For the debates on civil society,\nthis means that religion still is an important maker of\nsocietal cleavages. It seems, however, that the\ndifferences between Protestantism and Catholicism are\nless important than the differences between\nProtestantism/Catholicism on one hand and a-\nconfessional people and Orthodoxy on the other. With\nregard to the discussions that took place in Europe\nconcerning the formation of European identity, one\nmight add that there is an additional cleavage forming\nbetween Christianity on one hand and Islam on the other.\nUnfortunately, our data do not allow for testing this\naspect.\nAlthough the analysis shows that the influence of\nindividual religiousness is effective all over Europe, the\nincreased percentage of the total variance due to the country\ndifferences indicates that there are country-level differences\namong the member states despite the homogenizing\ntendencies of the European Commission concerning\nOne factor that is responsible for these country\ndifferences is the state\u00adreligion relationship. Although it\ndoes not change the individual-level results, it is partly\nresponsible for the country differences. Here religion and\nnational identity overlap as well; a close relationship\nbetween state and religion constitutes more intense feelings\nof ethnic national identity. This can be seen as an indicator\nfor the built-in character of religion: That is, religion in\ncountries with a supportive relationship between state and\nreligion may serve as an integral component of the self-\nunderstanding of the ethnic nation. This result supports case\nstudies about the sometimes-close relationship between\nnation and religion indicating that this relationship is\nmediated by the governmental alignments (e.g.,\nThe social capital hypotheses suggest that civil\nsociety organizations create and maintain social capital\nand social cohesion. It is partly supported by the finding\nthat the organizational degree of nonreligious\norganizations strengthens civic national identity and\nweakens its ethnic aspect. However, our results offer an\neven more detailed picture: The different impact on\nethnic and civic national identity suggests that there are\ndifferent forms of social capital--some of which seem to\nwork more inclusively and others are more exclusive.\nCivil society organizations seem to \"bridge\" and to\ninclude only with regard to the civic aspects of political\ninstitutions and the national language while they\nemphasize differences and cleavages concerning the\nethnic aspects of autochthony. Here, they seem to\nsupport feelings of belonging at the expense of \"the\nother.\" It seems as Welch et al. (2007) are right in their\nobservations that not all kinds of civil society\norganizations support social cohesion to the same extend.\nThe results suggest that civil societies in Europe are\nneither homogeneous nor necessarily inclusive on the\nindividual level. There are different degrees of social\ncohesion concerning the civil and the ethnic aspects of\nnational identity, and both are differently supported by\nindividual religiousness, civil society organizations and\nthe state\u00adreligion relationship. Most importantly, the\ngovernmental sphere provides the institutional\nframework in which social capital can develop and social\ncohesion is created and maintained: A cooperative state\u00ad\nreligion relationship lessens religious cleavages, which,\nin turn, tie in with feelings of ethnic national identity.\nCivil societies are shaped by the history and design of\nthe governmental context (as, for example, Jakelic, 2004,\nhas shown for Bosnia, Herzegovina, Croatia, and\nSlovenia). Our data imply that it matters for the\nindividual feelings of national identity how the\norganizational specification of religion is interlinked\nwith the state. Civil societies might legitimize or control\ngovernments; their cleavages, however, are influenced\nby the state's institutions. In this regard, institutions\nmatter for individual attitudes and by this, for the way in\nwhich civil societies are structured. One might even say\nthat the governmental settings facilitate exclusive and\ninclusive tendencies in civil society and thereby the\npossibilities of participation.\nIt is, however, not only the institutional framework\nthat works as a country-level context for civil society\ncohesion or for the unfolding of its cleavages. Religious\nhomogeneity indicating socially shared value, belief,\nand, perhaps, even lifestyle systems, is strongly tied to\nethnic national identity. This suggests that when\nreligious cleavages are not salient in civil societies\nbecause of their religious homogeneity, religion seem to\nbe a silent (in the sense of a \"quasi-self-evident\")\ncomponent of the nation. While some researchers argue\nthat religion and nation coincide mainly in the Protestant\nsuggest that this is the case independently of the\ndenomination, including Catholic countries such as\nIreland as well as Orthodox countries such as Greece or\nBulgaria, where religion is an integral part of what is\nconsidered as the nation. When, however, religious\ncleavages become salient through heterogeneity, religion\nas part of the nation becomes subject to societal\nnegotiation and the relationship is no longer clear-cut.\nCivil society is then marked by these religious\ndifferences and distortions, and we may expect to find\nethnic conflicts developing under these circumstances.\nAppendix\nTable A1.

For the derivation of social cohesion from individual attitudes\nand feelings, see, for example, Friedkin (2004).\n2. There is a longstanding debate about the decline of religion in\nEurope. Without wading too deeply into this debate, three\ndimensions of secularization can be distinguished: First,\nof the world,\" secularization refers to the replacement of\nreligious explanations by scientific ones in modern societies.\nAn alternative notion claims that secularization refers to the\nprogressive functional differentiation reducing religion to one\namong other functional spheres in society (Luhmann, 1977).\nSecularization, secondly, is understood as individualization of\nreligion stating that people decide what they want to believe in\nincluding changes to esoteric beliefs and alternative religions\neconomic market model, secularization stems from the lack of\nsufficient religious answers to a stable and constant demand for\ntranscendence because of a lack of competition (Stark &\nBainbridge, 1987). Empirically, secularization seems to occur\nin Europe, but to different extents and with different dynamics\n3. While Hervieu-L\u00e9ger (2006) argues on a macrosociological\nlevel that religion has the power to stabilize the social cohesion\nof societies, Welch, Sikkink, and Loveland (2007) were able to\ndemonstrate that and also how individual religiousness\nsupports general trust.\n4. Hunsberger and Jackson (2005) identified ethnical or racial,\nhomosexual and communist groups, feminists, and religious\nout-groups as possible targets for religiously motivated\nexclusion or discrimination.\n5. For example, the constitutions of the Czech Republic, France,\nSlovenia, and Slovakia state explicitly that the state is a secular\none.\n6. Generalized trust became the key component of social capital.\nMost survey-related research refers to the question, \"Generally\nspeaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that\nyou need to be very careful in dealing with people?\" generated\nby Noelle-Neumann in 1948. This operationalization, however,\nmakes it problematic to compare trust between individuals and\nbetween countries (e.g., Delhey, Newton, & Welzel, 2011;\nWelch et al., 2007). Therefore, we decided to use the concept\nof national identity instead.\n7. Because the data indicate an institution that was implemented\nin time before the measurement of the individual national\naffiliation, we are safe to establish a causal direction from these\ninstitutions toward individual attitudes.\n8. We calculated the religious related Herfindahl-Index as the\nnormalized sum of the squared percentage of a country's\ndenominations (a-confessional, catholic, protestant, orthodox,\nothers).\n9. For the following analysis, we are not interested in the\nparticular content or dogma of the different denominations. We\nare interested in the individual attitudes.\n10.We tested both aspects of individual religiosity separately.\nThey pointed into the same direction in all models. Therefore,\nit seemed sensible to reduce variables by collapsing them.\n11.Social organizations comprise welfare organizations,\ncommunity activities, and social movements; professional\norganizations comprise trade unions, political parties, and\nprofessional associations; and leisure organizations comprise\ncultural activities, sports, and youth organizations.\n12.Institutional feedback effects are extensively discussed by\n13.Diez-Roux (1988) developed this argument on the basis of the\nfollowing example: Income and coronary heart disease\nmortality are correlated inversely on the individual level, per\ncapita income and coronary heart disease mortality is\ncorrelated positively on the country level when non-European\ncountries are considered.\n14.We are not particularly interested in country-specific\ndifferences in national identities beyond their interaction with\nreligion. Therefore, we keep the description of the European\nnational landscape brief and do not discuss further\nimplications. The country means and standard deviations are\nreported in Table A1.\n15.The strong negative impact of orthodoxy on the national\nidentities outside orthodox majority countries is shown in\nTable A2 of the appendix. The weak impact of Orthodoxy in\ncountries with an orthodox majority is statistically due to high\nlevels of individual religiousness and national identity without\nmuch variance in both variables.\n16.Coefficients are considered significant on a p < .05-level.\n17.Results are not reported here but can be displayed on request.\n18.Although these results partly counter previous research, they\nmight be explainable by the fact that both need to be made\nsalient by political or mass media articulation in order to\nbecome influential. This is argued, for example, in\nconnection with group threat theory: It is not the mere\nnumbers but their interpretation and significance that\ninfluence peoples' attitudes (e.g., Hjerm, 2007; similarly\n19.The gross domestic product (GDP) functions as a confounding\nvariable.\n20.For a critical view on the widespread methodological\nnationalism that treats the station-state as an undifferentiated\nindependent variable, see Glick Schiller, Basch, and Szanton-\n21.The EU's attempts to harmonize European societies show in\ntheir different initiatives concerning religion:\nantidiscrimination regulation concerning the freedom of\nreligion, the attempt to create a constitution including a\nreference to Christianity, and the increased dialogue between\nthe EU Commission and the churches to give \"a soul to\nReferences\nAlesina, A., Devleeschauwer, A., Easterly, W., Kurlat, S., &\nWacziarg, R.
