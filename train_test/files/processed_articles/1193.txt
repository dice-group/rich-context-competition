The progression (or\nfrequency) of marijuana use was influenced by genetic\nand unique environmental factors. Findings for con-\nduct problems indicated that while the presence or\nabsence of conduct problems was largely heritable, the\nrelative severity of conduct problems appeared to be\nmore strongly environmentally influenced.

Given the complex processes thought to under-\nlie the link between initiation and progression of drug\nuse however, it is argued that the question should not\nbe whether or not there is a genetic component to drug\nuse per se, but rather what role genetic influences play\nin the aetiology of drug use over time (Rutter et al.\nhighlighted that the initiation and progression of\nsubstances may not be characterised as a single liability\nKoopmans et al. 1999). Rather, the initiation and\nprogression phases of substance use may be more\nappropriately characterised as partially overlapping (or\neven, independent; Heath et al. 1991). Indeed, while\nevidence from adult twin studies indicates that there\nare additive genetic, common environmental and\nunique environmental factors that are shared between\nthe initiation and progression of marijuana use, there is\nalso evidence of genetic and unique environmental\ninfluences that are specific to heavier use of marijuana\n(Agrawal et al. 2005). The increased influence of\ngenetic factors for heavy substance use possibly reflects\nthe increased involvement of biological processes in\nFor many individuals, initiation and experimenta-\ntion with substances occurs during adolescence (Fuller\net al. 2005). Adolescents may however, have lower\ntolerance levels for substances, including marijuana,\nand become dependent at lower doses than adults (e.g.\nChen et al. 1997). Furthermore, adolescent-onset\nsubstance misuse is characterized by more rapid\ndevelopment of multiple drug dependencies and more\nsevere psychopathology (e.g. Clark et al. 1998). With\nthis in mind, it is important to consider the relative role\nof genetic and environmental influences on initiation\nand progression of substance use in this age group and\nwhether the relationship between these dimensions of\nuse identified with adult samples is also observed in\nadolescents.\nAntisocial behaviour during childhood and adoles-\ncence has been linked to substance use in adolescence\nand early adulthood (e.g. Moffitt et al. 2002; Silberg\net al. 2003). Moreover, in the context of other\ndisruptive behaviour disorders, conduct disorder has\nbeen shown to be the most predictive of substance use\nand illicit drug use (e.g. Lynskey and Fergusson 1995;\nMoss and Lynch 2001). A recent follow-back study of a\nprospective, longitudinal cohort found that adults with\na substance use disorder (alcoholism, marijuana and\nother drug dependence) were significantly more likely\nthan those without such disorder to have had a conduct\nand/or oppositional defiant disorder before 15-years\nold (Kim-Cohen et al. 2003). Strong associations have\nalso been found between conduct disorder symptoms\nand marijuana use in adolescence for both males and\nfemales (Miles et al. 2002). This association was\nmoderately influenced by genetic factors and to a\nlesser extent, by non-shared environmental factors (see\nalso Young et al. 2000). The findings of a recent\nlongitudinal twin study indicated that conduct prob-\nlems in adolescence temporally preceded substance use\nand that the covariation between conduct problems\nand later substance use was influenced by genetic and\ncommon environmental factors (Silberg et al. 2003).\nThese findings mark an important shift away from\ndocumenting cross-sectional associations between con-\nduct problems and substance use, from which it is\nimpossible to determine the direction of effects, toward\nthe use of genetically sensitive research designs that\nassess relationships as they unfold over time. Indeed, in\nthe absence of an experimental design, a primary way\nin which the nature of the relationship between\nconduct problems and the initiation and progression\nof marijuana use during adolescence can begin to be\ndisentangled is to use a prospective, longitudinal twin\ndesign.\nThe present study is among the first to investigate\nwhether the initiation and progression of marijuana use\nduring adolescence reflects a common underlying\nliability. Extending previous research on the relation-\nship between conduct problems and substance use, this\nstudy also examines whether genetic and environmen-\ntal influences on conduct problems are related to the\nlater initiation of marijuana use in adolescence and in\naddition, whether conduct problems are implicated in\nthe continued use of marijuana once initiation has\noccurred. Bivariate genetic analyses were conducted to\nestablish whether marijuana initiation and progression\nrepresented a single liability of risk or alternatively,\nwhether these behaviours were more accurately rep-\nresented as independent liabilities (see Fig. 1). It was\nhypothesised that genetic, common and unique envi-\nronmental influences would contribute to the initiation\nof marijuana use, consistent with the role of social\nfactors in the initial experimentation phase of drug use\n(Rutter et al. 1999). In accordance with previous\nden Bree et al. 1998) we hypothesized heavier use (i.e.\nthe progression of marijuana use, rather than initia-\ntion) to be more strongly influenced by genetic factors\nwith a reduced role for common environment. Multi-\nvariate analyses assessed the relationship between\nconduct problems and later marijuana use. It was\nhypothesised that earlier genetic and environmental\ninfluences on conduct problems would be related to the\ninitiation of marijuana use 8 years later. Initiation of\nmarijuana use was expected to remain the strongest\npredictor of progression of marijuana use after con-\ntrolling for the influence of conduct problems.\nMethod\nSample\nThe sample used in the present analyses was drawn\ncollection of the longitudinal Cardiff Study of All\nWales and North West of England Twins (CaStANET;\nRice et al. 2002; van den Bree et al. in press). The\nCaStANET register is a population-based twin regis-\nCardiff area of South Wales and between 1980 and\n1991 for the rest of Wales and the North West of\nEngland. This twin register includes families from a\nsystematically ascertained, population-based register\nGreater Manchester, UK. Zygosity was assigned using\na twin similarity questionnaire completed by parents\nthat is more than 90% accurate in distinguishing\nmonozygotic (MZ) from dizygotic (DZ) twins and, in\na subsample, validated by genotyping DNA markers\net al. 2001). The CaStANET study received ethical\napproval from the Multi Centre Research Ethics\nCommittee for Wales, UK.\nAt the second wave of data collection (1996),\nquestionnaires were mailed to parents of twins aged\nparents returned questionnaires, representing a re-\ndetailed description of the sample). Parental consent\nwas also obtained to contact the twins' teacher. Of\nrepresenting a response rate of 88%. At the fourth\nwave of data collection in 2004, questionnaires assess-\ning various aspects of family functioning, parent health\nand twin psychological adjustment were mailed to\nfamilies (parents and twins) on the CaStANET twin\nregister with twins aged 11\u00ad19 years. Families were\nsent a reminder postcard, reminder questionnaires and\nfinally, a reminder letter. Non-responding families who\nmight have moved address were traced through Gen-\neral Practitioners. Previous research has shown that\nadolescent smokers and marijuana users are less likely\nto respond at follow-up in longitudinal studies (Sidd-\niqui et al. 1996). Extra efforts were therefore made to\ncontact families via telephone where one twin had\nreported substance use. Of 1755 families with adoles-\ncent twins re-contacted in 2004, at least one family\nmember from 1214 families returned questionnaires\ntwins replied) representing a response rate of 69%.\nFamily members who returned questionnaires received\na high street store voucher as a token of appreciation\nfor their participation.

Of this\nsample, there was complete information for 895 twin\npairs. At Time 1 (1996), the sub-sample of twin pairs\nSD = 1.94). There were approximately equal numbers\npairs). The majority of twins lived with their biological\nmother and father (66.2%) with smaller proportions\nliving with one biological parent and a stepparent\nTwins classified as living with `other' included those\nwho were living with another relative (e.g. grandpar-\nents) and twins who lived apart or who were away at\nuniversity for part of the year. Analyses conducted in\nwhich this last group were excluded resulted in a\nsimilar pattern of findings to those reported below.\nThe majority of parent questionnaires (Time 1) were\ncompleted by mothers (93.6%) with smaller numbers\ncompleted by fathers (5.3%) and others (1.1% e.g.\nstepparent; grandparent). There was no significant\ndifference in mean levels of conduct problems as a\nfunction of the reporter of parent information. Tests\nindicated that twins who did not respond at the Time 2\nfollow-up had higher levels of Time 1 conduct prob-\nThis may indicate a possible bias, whereby adolescents\nwith higher conduct problems who were less likely to\nrespond at follow-up were also those adolescents more\nlikely to use substances, including marijuana.\nMeasures\nConduct problems\nParent and teacher-reported conduct problems were\nassessed using five items from the Strengths and\nDifficulties Questionnaire (Goodman 1997; Goodman\nand Scott 1999). Items included, `Often tells lies or\ncheats' `Steals things', `Fights or bullies other children',\n`Often has temper tantrums or hot tempers' and\n`Generally obedient, usually does what adults request'\n(recoded to reflect disobedient behaviour). Each item\nwas rated, 0 `Doesn't apply', 1 `Applies somewhat' or 2\n`Certainly applies'. These items are broadly equivalent\nto symptoms of conduct disorder as defined by the\nDSM-IV (American Psychological Association 1994).\nParents and teachers reported on behaviour over the\nlast six months. Recent evidence indicates that differ-\nent informants provide related and unique information\nabout children's antisocial behaviour (Arseneault et al.\n2003). Moreover, because children's behaviour can\nvary between settings, the most valid measurement is\nthat which includes data from more than one informant\nand from more than one setting or context (Scourfield\net al. 2004). Consistent with this argument, conduct\nproblem scores were combined for parent and teacher\nreports by counting symptoms reported by either\nparents or teachers as present, thereby capturing each\nof the five behaviours occurring in both the home and\nschool context. The item-level correlations between\nparent and teacher reports of conduct problems ranged\nP < 0.001. The highest rating given by either parent\nor teacher was taken as the score for that symptom, in\nother words the occurrence of the behaviour in one\ncontext (e.g. the home), was sufficient for it to be\ncounted as present. The internal consistency estimate\nfor the present sample was acceptable (a = 0.76) and\nthe five items were added to give a total conduct\nproblems score.\nUsing criteria outlined by Goodman (1997), conduct\nproblems ranging from 0 to 2 were classified as\n`normal', a score of 3\u00ad4 was classified as `borderline'\nand scores ranging from 5 to 10 were classified as\n`abnormal'. Of respondents with conduct information\n(13%) as abnormal. Conduct problems were classified\non two dimensions: (1) the presence of conduct\nproblems was indexed as either `0' for `normal range'\nor `1' for borderline or abnormal conduct problems (2)\nthe second dimension labelled `borderline/abnormal',\ndistinguished individuals in the borderline and abnor-\nmal range for conduct problems. Children in the\nnormal range were coded as missing for borderline/\nabnormal problems, borderline conduct problems was\ncoded as `0' and abnormal conduct problems were\ncoded `1'.\nMarijuana use\nThe frequency of lifetime marijuana use was assessed\nusing the following item from the Add Health ques-\ntionnaire (Resnick et al. 1997), `During your life, how\nmany times have you used marijuana?' The six\nresponse options ranged from `Never used marijuana\nin my life' to `More than 30 times'. Responses were\ncollapsed to create two binary variables assessing\ninitiation of use and frequency of use. Initiation was\nindexed as `0' for never having used marijuana and `1'\nfor use. Frequency was indexed as light and heavy use\nwith `0' representing use of marijuana 1\u00ad5 times and `1'\nrepresenting use of marijuana six or more times.\nIndividuals who had never used marijuana were coded\nas missing for frequency of use.\nStatistical analysis\nThe software package Mx (Neale 1997) was used for\ngenetic model fitting. Analyses were conducted using a\n`causal common contingent' model which facilitates the\nexpression of marijuana use as a two-stage process\nincorporating an initiation stage (`upstream', for exam-\nple whether the individual has ever tried marijuana)\nthat necessarily precedes a progression stage (`down-\nstream', for example, whether the individual uses the\nmarijuana frequently; see Fig. 1; Agrawal et al. 2005;\nNeale et al. 2006). The model estimates the magnitude\nof the relationship between initiation and progression\nby means of a beta pathway between these two stages\n(see Fig. 1). If the beta coefficient is estimated to be\nzero, this suggests that the initiation and progression\nstages for a substance are entirely unrelated processes,\ni.e. genetic and environmental risk factors for initiation\nare completely independent from those for progres-\nsion. Alternatively, if the beta coefficient is estimated\nto be 1, this indicates that initiation and progression\nare entirely overlapping dimensions with identical\ngenetic and environmental risk factors. The 95%\nconfidence intervals around the beta coefficient pro-\nvide further information on the degree of overlap\nbetween the two stages. Lower limits closer to zero (or\nbelow) support independent liabilities and upper limits\napproaching 1 provide support for identical liabilities.\nThe model also allows the estimation of: (1) additive\ngenetic effects (a2), (2) common environmental effects\n(c2), and (3) unique environmental effects (e2), on both\ninitiation and progression of substance use.\nAn important feature of this model is that it is\nuniquely suited to analysis of data from an adolescent\nage group, where individuals may have not yet engaged\nin marijuana use but will go on to become frequent\nusers. The model takes into account the fact that some\nindividuals may be above the liability threshold for\nprogression of marijuana use (i.e. will become frequent\nusers) but because they are not past the age of risk,\nhave not yet initiated marijuana use. As such, their\nposition on the liability distribution of progression is\nunknown. These individuals are treated as a special\ncase of missing data for progression using the maxi-\nmum likelihood approach for dealing with missing data\nlikelihood of an association between age and level of\nsubstance use, an age correction was also employed\nwhich adjusts the threshold for each twin according to\nhis or her age at the time of questionnaire completion\non the distribution of liability to conduct problems and\nmarijuana use. Specifically, the threshold is modeled as\na simple linear function:\nti\n\u00bc t \u00fe agei\nta\nwhere t is the population baseline threshold (for\nindividuals of age zero), ta\nmodels the regression of\nthe threshold on age, and agei\nis the age in years of the\nindividual i at assessment (Neale et al. 2006).\nModels were estimated using full information max-\nimum likelihood (FIML) estimation with raw ordinal\ndata, which included zygosity, twin age, and initiation\nand progression information relating to conduct prob-\nlems and/or marijuana use for each twin. The signif-\nicance of parameters was evaluated using 95%\nconfidence intervals (CIs), calculated using Mx (Neale\nResults\nThe rate of lifetime marijuana use for the total sample\nof adolescents was 21.6%.

On the other hand, the greater\nvariances for DZ twin marijuana use may indicate\nsibling interaction, for example where one twin is less\nlikely to engage in substance use in response to the\nother twins' substance using behaviour. However, this\nis somewhat counterintuitive because research indi-\ncates that sibling deviance, and drug and alcohol use\nspecifically, predicts increased substance use (e.g.\nTests of sex differences revealed no sex differences\nin levels of marijuana initiation or progression (initi-\nthe presence and severity of conduct problems (pres-\nfor pooled twin data were conducted using the survey\nate for use with twin data when there is non-indepen-\ndence of observations.

The magnitude of association between\nconduct problems and marijuana use for dizygotic\ntwins and monozygotic twins was similar, suggesting\ncommon environmental influence (MZ twins, r = 0.18;\nDZ twins, r = 0.19). Examining the tetrachoric corre-\nlations using PRELIS 2.50 (Joreskog and Sorbom\n1996) for each of the four constructs (initiation and\nprogression of conduct problems and marijuana use,\nrespectively) suggested genetic and shared environ-\nmental influence. The correlations for presence of\nconduct problems correlations were r = 0.77 for MZ\ntwins and 0.46 for DZ twins indicating genetic and\nenvironmental influence, while the correlations for the\nborderline/abnormal conduct problems construct were\nstronger environmental influence. The results for\ninitiation of marijuana use indicated genetic and\nshared environmental effects (MZ r = 0.80; DZ\nr = 0.70), while progression of marijuana use appeared\nto be more strongly genetically influenced (MZ\nThe relationship between the liability to initiation\nand progression of conduct problems and marijuana\nuse\nThe results of model tests for conduct problems and\nmarijuana use, respectively, are presented in Table 1.\nConduct problems\nTo facilitate later multivariate tests of the relationship\nbetween earlier conduct problems (Time 1) and later\nmarijuana use (Time 2), a CCC model was estimated\nfor conduct problems.

In contrast, the frequency\nof marijuana use was explained by a heritable compo-\nnent (64%) and a non-shared environment component\n(36%). The threshold estimates were 0.57 for initiation\nmental influences on initiation that are, in turn,\ntransmitted to the frequency of marijuana use. This\nvalue, which is less than unity, indicated that while the\nliabilities for the initiation and frequency of marijuana\nuse were not independent, neither could these dimen-\nsions be assumed to reflect a single liability of risk. In\nother words, the liability to initiate use of marijuana\naccounted for a substantial proportion (approximately\n77%), but not all, of the variance in the liability to\nmore frequent use of marijuana. The CI's around beta\nwere moderately to strongly related but not identical.\nGoodness-of-fit statistics indicated that a model in\nwhich age-corrected thresholds were estimated\nprovided a better fit to the data than a model that\ndf = 2, P < 0.001), corroborating our findings of a\nhigher prevalence of increased marijuana use in older\nadolescents.\nMultivariate analyses\nAnalyses were conducted to examine whether the\nliability to conduct problems during childhood and\nearly adolescence was a risk factor for the liability to\ninitiate and use marijuana 8 years later. The model\nwas again estimated using full information maximum\nlikelihood (FIML) estimation with raw ordinal data,\nwhich included zygosity, twin age, and `initiation' and\n`progression' information relating to conduct problems\nand marijuana use for each twin. In addition to paths\nestimated from each initiation variable to the progres-\nsion variable, paths were estimated from presence of\nand borderline/abnormal conduct problems at Time 1\nto marijuana initiation and progression at Time 2.\nFigure 2 presents the results for the full model, in\nwhich all six pathways between conduct problems\n(Time 1) and marijuana use (Time 2) were estimated.\nThis model provided similar estimates of the relation-\nship between each classification of conduct problems\nand the initiation and frequency of marijuana use,\nrespectively. Minor fluctuations were found between\nmodels (bivariate model to the full multivariate\nmodel) in the genetic and environmental estimates\nfor conduct problems, which can be expected to be a\nresult of the model estimation. Fixing estimates in the\nfull model to their bivariate values would not change\nthe substantive interpretation of the multivariate\nresults, nor would it yield a significant difference in\nfit. However, the multivariate results should generally\nbe regarded as superior, because they use more\ninformation.\nThe strongest beta-paths were observed within\ntraits, between initiation and progression variables\nfor both conduct problems and marijuana use. No\nsignificant effects were observed between conduct\nproblems and later marijuana use (b range = 0.04\u00ad\n0.17). In the context of strong effects from initiation to\nfrequency of marijuana use (b = 0.75), associations\nbetween conduct problems and the frequency of\nmarijuana use were relatively weak. As the bivariate\nanalysis described above suggested however, there\nwere also relatively high levels of covariation in the\nliabilities for presence and borderline/abnormal con-\nduct problems. This may have affected the power of\neither variable to predict initiation of marijuana use.\nTo investigate this possibility, nested models were\nanalysed to test the effect of dropping pathways\nbetween initiation and progression constructs and\nbetween conduct problems and marijuana use. Models\nwere fitted whereby the paths between liability to\nconduct problems, severity of conduct problems,\nliability to marijuana initiation and frequency of use\nwere dropped in turn and the deterioration in chi-\nsquare fit compared to a model in which all possible\npath coefficients from Time 1 conduct problems to\nTime 2 marijuana use were estimated (see Table 2 for\nmodel fitting results). These results showed that when\nthe path from liability to conduct problems and\nseverity of conduct problems was dropped there was\na significant reduction in model fit, compared to a full\nmodel. This was also the case when the path from\nliability to marijuana initiation and frequency of use\nwas dropped.

Specifically, the results indicate that in a\nUK sample, the longitudinal association between the\nliability to conduct problems during childhood and\nearly adolescence and the liability to initiate and\nprogress marijuana use in adolescence and early\nadulthood are not strongly related. Thus, other risk\nfactors and the mechanisms through which they exert\neffects on the initiation and progression of marijuana\nuse in adolescence should also be investigated.\nConsistent with previous research examining the\nrelationship between initiation and progression (or use\nand abuse) of substances in adult populations, additive\ngenetic, common and non-shared environmental influ-\nences were found for initiation of marijuana while\nfactors specific to progression were influenced by\ngenetic and non-shared environment with no role for\ncommon environment (e.g. Agrawal et al. 2005; Heath\n1999). These findings concur with the view that\ngenetically influenced biological mechanisms appear\nto play a more important role in the aetiology of\nproblem use and substance dependence (Kendler et al.\nproblems were introduced as predictors of marijuana\ninitiation and progression in the multivariate model,\nthere was a slight reduction in the genetic estimate and\nan increase in the environmental influence. This was\nparticularly the case for initiation of marijuana use. It\nis also interesting to note that while not independent,\nthe initiation and frequency of marijuana use, to some\ndegree, represent different liabilities of risk. Concep-\ntually, this indicates that the use of marijuana by\nadolescents does not always and inevitably lead to\nmore frequent use and that there may be different risk\nfactors underlying initiation and progression to more\nfrequent marijuana use. Studies into risk factors that\npredispose individuals to continued use of marijuana\nafter first experimentation with the drug will be helpful\nin increasing insight into which adolescents are at\ngreatest risk for problem use. For example, van den\nBree and Pickworth (2005) found that some risk factors\npredict both initiation of experimental marijuana use\nand progression to regular use, while others are specific\nto each stage.\nThe results for conduct problems indicated that\nwhile the presence or absence of conduct problems\nwere largely heritable, the relative severity of conduct\nproblems, categorised as `borderline' and `abnormal'\nappeared to be more strongly environmentally influ-\nenced. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of\ngreater measurement error at the upper end of the\ndistribution contributing to a large non-shared envi-\nronment estimate. The beta coefficient between the\ntwo dimensions suggested that they mostly, but not\nrecent evidence (e.g. Pickles et al. 2001; van den Oord\net al. 2003) indicates that conduct problems may be\nbest regarded as a single liability of risk where there is\nno demarcation between normality and psychopathol-\nogy (Rutter 2003). The categorization of conduct\nproblems into dichotomous variables may have af-\nfected the power to predict later marijuana use.\nPreliminary analyses indicated that conduct problems\nassessed as a continuous variable predicted later\nmarijuana use, although the strength of association\ntests in which presence and severity of conduct\nproblems were assessed separately indicated small\nbut significant effects from conduct problems to the\ninitiation of marijuana use. Although the trend toward\na significant drop in model fit when the path from\nseverity of conduct problems to initiation of marijuana\nuse was removed suggests that it is the presence rather\nthan severity of conduct problems that is important in\nthe prediction of marijuana use initiation, this is\nspeculative and should be replicated in independent\nsamples of larger number. Moreover, it will be inter-\nesting in the future (as these models become available)\nto repeat these analyses including conduct problems as\na dimensional measure with a single liability. The\nfindings of the present study also suggest that this\nmodelling technique could be applied to questions\nrelating to the transition from symptoms to diagnosis,\nparticularly when longitudinal data are available to\nexamine this relationship over time (see Neale et al.\nA limitation of the present study was that the results\nof both the bivariate and multivariate model tests had\nwide confidence intervals around the progression\nvariables (borderline/abnormal conduct problems and\nfrequency of marijuana use). These possibly reflect the\nlow frequencies of adolescents with high levels of\nconduct problems and who had initiated marijuana use.\nFor instance, preliminary analyses indicated that ado-\nhigher levels of conduct problems at Time 1 (1996).\nThus, the present analyses may represent a conserva-\ntive estimate of the influence of conduct problems on\nlater initiation and progression of marijuana use. In\naddition, heterogeneity in the relationship between\nconduct problems and marijuana use as a function of\nthe wide age range of the sample, together with a\nreliance on a single item to index marijuana use, may\nhave affected the power to detect an association. In\naddition, in light of the strong relations between the\ninitiation and progression variables, the cross-trait\npaths are relatively small and larger sample sizes than\nwe currently have available are needed to obtain more\nconclusive nested model fitting results for the cross-\ntrait paths. Finally, it should be noted that while the\npresent study provides insights regarding the pheno-\ntypic relationship between conduct problems and the\ninitiation and progression of marijuana use in adoles-\ncence together with sources of genetic and environ-\nmental influence on each index of conduct problems\nand marijuana use, it does not assess genetic and\nenvironmental sources of covariance between these\nbehaviours (see Neale et al. 2006). In addition to\naddressing the caveats outlined above therefore, an\nimportant direction for further research is to assess\nthese influences.\nPrevious research found sex differences in the\nprevalence of marijuana use (greater use among males;\nJohnston et al. 2005) and in the genetic and environ-\nmental influences on adolescent male and female\nmarijuana initiation (e.g. Rhee et al. 2003). Recent\nresearch has also identified sex differences in the\npattern of relations between the severity of conduct\nproblems and the later initiation of marijuana use\n(Pedersen et al. 2001). The binary nature of the study\nvariables together with the sample size did not permit\nmodel tests incorporating sex differences. Neverthe-\nless, an important direction for future research is to test\ncausal common contingent models for sex differences\nin the pattern of relations between conduct problems\nand marijuana use in an adolescent age group.\nNotwithstanding these limitations, the present study\nextends previous research by investigating longitudinal\nrelationships between conduct problems and marijuana\nuse during adolescence using a modelling approach that\nenabled age appropriate adjustments to estimates of the\nrelationship between the initiation and progression\ndimensions of substance use. The findings are also\nconsistent with previous research indicating stronger\nassociations between conduct problems and substance\nuse within than across-time (e.g. Miles et al. 2002;\nSilberg et al. 2003). As such, they suggest that interven-\ntions aimed at helping children with conduct problems\nin the years preceding the onset of substance use are\nunlikely to reduce the risk of marijuana use in adoles-\ncence and young adulthood. Other risk factors need to\nbe investigated. An important direction for future\nresearch will be to develop models that can test these\nprocesses with greater precision. For example, models\nare required that permit the testing of risk factors\nassessed using continuous measures as predictors of\ninitiation and progression of substance use and the\ninvestigation of moderators of the liability to initiate\nand progress in substance use when these reflect\nindependent liabilities of risk. The findings of this\nprospective, longitudinal study represent a first step in\nexamining the risk factors that influence the initiation of\nsubstance use and the progression to more frequent use\nduring adolescence and young adulthood.\n"
