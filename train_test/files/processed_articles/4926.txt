Mortality rates\nfrom CLABSI are 12% to 25% and significantly increase cost\nand hospital length of stay (Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention [CDC], 2011). Nurses are on the frontline of\nCLABSI prevention, contributing to the 58% decrease in\n(CDC, 2016). Despite their involvement in the process, they\nmay not understand the implications that mandatory public\nreporting or current pay-for-performance programs may have\non their hospital system. Statistics are readily available online\nfor consumers to review how local hospitals compare with\none another in terms of HAI rates and other critical factors\nthat determine hospital quality. Favorable performance in\nthese metrics attracts patients, influences accreditation\nboards, and may lead to salary bonuses. Mandatory public\nreporting of CLABSI and other HAI began in 2003 and has\nincreased incrementally over time in terms of participation\nand what is required to be reported--37 states currently\nrequire reporting, while the rest are incentivized to do so\n(Herzig, Reagan, Pogorzelska-Maziarz, Srinath, & Stone,\npressures to keep their CLABSI rates low; otherwise, they\nmay experience a 1% reduction in Medicare reimbursement.\nPressure on hospital systems may enhance CLABSI safety\nand prevention efforts. Attempts at improving healthcare out-\ncomes and cost are deeply interrelated, and this review of lit-\nerature aims to summarize current knowledge regarding how\nextrinsic factors have affected rates of CLABSI.\nCurrent State of CLABSI Prevention\nBest evidence-based practice is a driver to intrinsically\nchanging individual nurse behavior and individual hospital\nstandards extrinsically influence nursing practice to achieve\nlower CLABSI rates. One of the most researched aspects of\nCLABSIs is testing various prevention methods. Study of\nbest practices is important to review because the purpose\nof mandatory reporting, pay-for-performance, and the\nAffordable Care Act (ACA) are all designed at incentivizing\nhospitals toward implementing best practices and punishing\nthose who fail to do so. CLABSI-prevention research has\nbeen pivotal in the gradual decline of CLABSIs and develop-\nment of best practices implemented over the past decade,\n1The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nBenjamin Woodward, College of Nursing, The University of Tennessee,\nEmail: bwoodwa4@vols.utk.edu\nReview of Best Practices for CLABSI\nPrevention and the Impact of Recent\nLegislation on CLABSI Reporting\nBenjamin Woodward1 and Reba Umberger1\n Keywords\nCLABSI, ACA, pay-for-performance, prevention, legislation, reporting\n2 SAGE Open\nincluding studies focusing strictly on strict hand hygiene\n(Johnson et al., 2014), CLABSI-prevention bundles includ-\ning interventions to increase hand hygiene compliance\n(Berenholtz et al., 2014; Guerin, Wagner, Rains, & Bessesen,\n(Rutkoff, 2014), and chlorhexidine baths (Dixon & Carver,\nsic motivator that plays a large role in the effectiveness of\nadopting these best practices (Fan et al., 2016). Intrinsic\nmotivation, the degree to which individual healthcare pro-\nviders drive toward and implement best practices, is difficult\nto cultivate but can be aided by champions of a particular\nhealthcare improvement process who have stronger profes-\nsional relationships with bedside nurses and physicians\n(Damschroder et al., 2009). If healthcare providers are\nunwilling to alter their practice, little change is likely to\noccur, and those attempting to improve hospital CLABSI\nrates should consider these intrinsic and extrinsic factors as\nequally important to establishing hospital protocols in line\nwith best practice guidelines.\nAlthough the reduction in CLABSI rates is an excellent\ntrend, recent research indicates that rates can still be signifi-\ncantly reduced across the United States by applying a simple\nbundled approach. The bundle includes efforts to ensure best\npractices are being implemented, to improve safety culture\nand teamwork, and to provide feedback to leaders in quality\nThere has been a vast amount of research devoted to discov-\nering best practices related to CLABSI prevention, but this\nreview will focus on the less-studied extrinsic factors related\nto CLABSI prevention.\nRegulatory Bodies and Their Roles in\nMandatory Reporting\nThe following three sections will cover the current process of\nreporting CLABSIs. This information is important for nurses\nto understand because it will help them to understand why\nCLABSI has become such a large focus in hospitals. There\nare several regulatory bodies that determine whether a\nCLABSI is present, how they are coded for medical billing,\nand methods of reporting CLABSI to state and federal data-\nbases. The CDC and the National Healthcare Safety Network\n(NHSN) have guidelines for laboratory-confirmed blood-\nstream infection (LCBI), which determines whether or not a\nbloodstream infection is the result of a central line. Once a\nCLABSIhasbeenidentified,theCMSutilizetheInternational\nClassification of Diseases (ICD) selected by providers to\ncode the CLABSI for billing. The majority of states also\nrequire hospitals to report their CLABSIs to the NHSN\nthrough providers coding with ICD and/or infection preven-\ntionists following LCBI guidelines. In states where this is not\nmandated, healthcare providers are incentivized to provide\ntheir ICD codes to payers such as CMS and private insurance\ncompanies. Each of these links in the chain of mandatory\nreporting is vital to ensuring accurate CLABSI identification\nat the levels of the patient, hospital, state, and nation.\nIdentifying Patients With CLABSI\nAccording to further CDC guidelines, LCBIs are divided\ninto LCBI 1, LCBI 2, and LCBI 3 (LCBI 3 will not be defined\nor used due to its sole use in patients < 1 year of age, which\nis not the focus of this review). An LCBI 1 is defined as a\npatient with a recognized pathogen cultured from one or\nmore blood cultures, and this cultured bacteria is not related\nto an infection at any other site. This confirms that the blood-\nstream infection is not related to another source of infection\nand is therefore determined to be caused by the central line.\nLCBI 2 requires that the patient have either fever (>38\u00b0C),\nchills, or hypotension, alongside positive blood lab results\n(cultures) that are not related to infection at another site.\nFinally, bacteria must be cultured from two or more blood\ntests drawn within a 24-hr period. LCBI 2 allows for diagno-\nsis of a CLABSI when blood cultures reveal a microorgan-\nism that is not strictly pathogenic in nature (CDC, 2016).\nRecent changes occurred in 2015, with the CDC and NHSN\n(Patient Safety Manual, 2015) adding an extra table in their\nguidelines, which was \"added to highlight site specific crite-\nria that require blood cultures in order to meet a secondary\nBSI\" (p. 1).\nCulturing bacteria from blood samples taken from patients\nwho are suspected to have a CLABSI is a pivotal piece in\ndiagnosing the infection, as outlined in LCBIs 1 and 2. If\nthere are multiple central lines in place, they should be cul-\ntured at the same time, and oftentimes, the suspected catheter\nis removed to do so. Evidence-based practice calls for all\nshort-term catheters such as peripherally inserted catheters\n(not peripherally inserted central catheters [PICC]), midline\ncatheters, and non-tunneled central venous catheters (CVCs)\nto be removed, while long-term catheters such as PICCs and\ntunneled CVCs should be removed in the event of severe\nsepsis, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, and instances\nof bloodstream infection, which do not resolve within 72 hr\nfollowing appropriate antibiotic therapy (Han, Liang, &\nMarschall, 2010). If removal of the line for culturing is not\nrecommended, then the possibility of infection from any\nother sites must be ruled out (CDC, 2016). Culturing allows\nproviders to know exactly what type of microorganism that\nthey are trying to treat/eradicate, which allows for directed\nantibiotic therapy. In practice, it is illogical and dangerous to\nwait for culture results, and providers usually begin immedi-\nate treatment.\nCatheter tips should not be routinely cultured unless there\nis a clinical indication that a CLABSI may be present (CDC,\n2015c). Complexity can make this extremely difficult\nbecause patients may have several potential sources of infec-\ntion. Current recommendations are to rely on clinical judg-\nment when determining whether to remove a line and culture\nit; use of culturing methods that preserve the integrity of the\nWoodward and Umberger 3\ncentral line is recommended to prevent unnecessary expense\nand time by providers and the laboratory personnel (CDC,\nMedical Billing for CLABSI\nCurrently, the ICD Version 10 coding is the most used system\nof reporting medical diagnoses and procedures in the United\nStates (CMS, 2015b). This classification system replaced\n2015). In this system, a specific numerical code is assigned to\nan individual diagnosis or medical procedure to facilitate eas-\nier reporting to surveillance system and insurance agencies.\nAccording to CMS (2015), hospitals are now required under\nthe ACA to report their ICD findings and actions (including\nCLABSIs and HAIs) within this system to be eligible for full\nreimbursement. In short, if these codes are not reported, then\nMedicare or Medicaid will not pay for aspects of the bill.\nHospitals with higher rates of CLABSIs will have their federal\nreimbursement rates cut, with the hope being that hospitals\nwill take more measures and precautions to receive more of\nthis money. Now that hospitals and healthcare providers are\nbeginning to adapt and accept these measures as the norm,\nresearch is necessary to assess whether or not these goals have\nbeen met. Nursing research is beginning to fill this gap, con-\ncluding that increased communication between health depart-\nments and agencies such as CMS is occurring, but uniform\ndefinition of HAIs is still lacking between them (Stone et al.,\n2015). A great deal more study is needed to evaluate the suc-\ncess of these incentivizing or penalizing measures including\nperspectives on specific mandates.\nReporting CLABSI at the National and State\nLevels\nAs dictated by The Joint Commission on Accredidation of\nHealthcare Organizations (JCAHO), hereinafter referred to\nas The Joint Commission, CLABSIs are to be reported to the\nNHSN. Although not all states have legislated this mandate,\nthere are incentives to report CLABSI in all states (The Joint\nCommission, 2012). For states that do not mandate report-\ning, there are still systems in place to transfer ICD codes to\nthe CMS or private insurer to receive reimbursement. These\nsystems are specific to each state that does not have manda-\ntory reporting guidelines (Beck & Margolin, 2007). CLABSIs\nthat are present on admission (POA), such as from contami-\nnation from a long-term central line, do not need to be\nreported to the NHSN. A CLABSI is considered POA if it\noccurs within two calendar days of admission (CDC, 2016).\nThe hospital's infection prevention (IP) team is the primary\navenue of reporting as it collects data on infection rates\nthroughout its healthcare facility. In general, if a CLABSI is\nsuspected, an IP expert first examines the Electronic Medical\nRecord (EMR) for cultures and evidence to determine\nwhether the infection originated in a site other than a central\nline. IPs consult with the nurse managers, team leaders, bed-\nside nurses, and providers to glean pertinent information\nrelated to the patient's condition. For example, in patients\nwho have a history of known intravenous (IV) drug use,\nsome CLABSI cases have been linked to IV drug abuse in\nthe hospital (Sammons, 2015). Ultimately, IP must prove that\nanother site is responsible for the infection, or it must be con-\nsidered a CLABSI and reported (CDC, 2016). The NHSN\ntracks HAIs in the United States.\nProblems With Current Reporting\nGuidelines\nThe process of identifying and reporting CLABSI has been\ndescribed as complicated and complex due to the ever-\nchanging definition of what constitutes a CLABSI and ambi-\nguity about where infections come from, and complex\nmedical patients are at higher risk of contracting a CLABSI\n(Backman, Melchreit, & Rodriguez, 2010; Hazamy et al.,\n2013). Hospitals and infection preventionists use the LCBI\nsystem to report to the NHSN, while healthcare providers\ntreat patients with CLABSI, who are assigned codes based\non the World Health Organization's ICD and used by the\nCMS and the NHSN. The NHSN is primarily responsible for\nsurveillance of HAIs, whereas the CMS controls hospital\nreimbursement. These two systems should ideally reach the\nsame findings regarding identification of CLABSI, but stud-\nies have shown that this is not always the case (Backman\nIncongruent interpretation between IP and healthcare provid-\ners can distort reported CLABSI rates and hospital reim-\nbursement. With the advent of ICD-10 coding in October of\n2015, adequacy in training of healthcare providers in a com-\npletely revamped system is currently unclear (World Health\nOrganization, 2015). Also a problem is the fact that only two\nmethods of CLABSI exist (LCBI and ICD). There is move-\nment to combine these two systems (Stone et al., 2015), but\nhealthcare providers may not have time to constantly update\ntheir understanding of what currently constitutes a CLABSI.\nAlthough healthcare providers are not directly responsible\nfor coding each diagnosis (this is the responsibility of trained\ncoders), they must have adequate support through labs,\nassessments, and cultures to justify their medical interven-\ntions. New definitions of requirements for confirming diag-\nnoses are constantly changing, and healthcare providers must\nkeep up with these changes to ensure accurate documenta-\ntion and application of best practices.\nReal-World Examples of Problems in\nCLABSI Reporting\nIn a retrospective chart review study performed in Connecticut\nunits (ICUs) and 3 pediatric ICUs (30 acute care hospitals), 476\nseptic events were identified (Backman et al., 2010). Forty-eight\n4 SAGE Open\nof these events were diagnosed as CLABSIs according to guide-\nlines outlined by the NHSN and previously in this article.\nTwenty-three (48%) of these CLABSIs had been reported to the\nNHSN, leaving 25 (52%) CLABSIs, as defined by the reviewer\nwho utilized LCBIs 1 and 2 criteria, unreported. \"Thirteen (43%)\nhospitals were responsible for the 25 infections not reported\"\nperiod as determined by the researchers.\nGoing deeper into the data, 76% of the unreported\nCLABSIs were diagnosed using LCBI 1 (as outlined in the\n\"Introduction\" section of this article), leaving 24% of the\nunreported CLABSIs being diagnosed with LCBI 2. In gen-\neral, underreporting appeared to be the trend, but certain hos-\npitals also fell victim to over-reporting bloodstream infections\nthat could be traced to sources other than a central line. In\ndiscussion, the primary cause of this under- and over-\nreporting was believed to be confusion by providers and IP\nstaff about surveillance definitions of CLABSIs and could\nalso be related to complex cases where sources of infection\nare unclear. This confusion is compounded if central venous\ncatheters are simply removed without culturing once other\nsources of infection are ruled out. Physicians are rightfully\nmore concerned with treating what they see as a bloodstream\ninfection rather than spending valuable time determining\nwhether this infection fits the specific requirements for a\nCLABSI. It is IP's job to investigate and determine the\nsource of infection, but retrospective communication is\nlikely inadequate for analysis of all the factors in play at the\ntime of infection. Attributing positive blood cultures to\nCLABSI can be challenging. The researchers concluded that\nfurther education and training would be necessary to ensure\nthat all healthcare providers achieve a uniform definition of\nwhat requirements the NHSN has for reporting of CLABSIs\nIn the state of New York, as of 2007, hospitals are required\nto publically report instances of CLABSIs. To ensure that\nprotocols were followed, a large portion of the hospitals were\naudited by a group of researchers to examine their medical\nrecords of positive blood cultures obtained between 2007\nrecords were audited; 3,104 (54%) had a central line in place;\nand 650 (21%) of these patients with a central line were\ndetermined to have a CLABSI based on the reviewer's inter-\npretation. The amount of disparity between the reviewer's\nfindings and reports to the NHSN steadily decreased from\n14% to 6% during the period of the study, which was likely\nattributed to feedback from the reviewers. In the final year\ninterpretation of what defines a CLABSI being the most\nlikely cause of this error (57%), and missed by surveillance\n(provider did not include CLABSI in the differential) being\nthe second most likely (35%). In conclusion, this study found\nthat audits of hospitals and their patients was an effective\nmethod for reducing confusion of CLABSI definition\nbetween IP staff and the NHSN (Hazamy et al., 2013).\nResearchers looking at 44 hospitals in Oregon also found a\ndisparity between the CLABSIs found by hospitals when\ncompared with the researchers applying strict definitions, but\nthey were able to improve accuracy through feedback given\nto the hospitals (Oh et al., 2012). Feedback appears to be a\nsimple and effective way to help hospitals ensure they are\nproperly identifying infections.\nThese studies showed how the definition of a CLABSI is\noftentimes misinterpreted and misreported as a result. The\nCDC is aware of problems in surveillance, noting that deci-\nsions from IP to report to the NHSN can be overruled, and\nclinicians may alter their diagnostic process to avoid classi-\nfying an infection as hospital-acquired. They affirm that this\nis an uncommon practice, but the fact that it exists is worri-\nsome and puts patients in danger of overuse and underuse of\ndiagnostic tests (CDC, 2015b). Despite this, with proper sur-\nveillance and education, hospitals and the NHSN can reach a\nuniform approach of identifying CLABSIs, which would\npromote accurate reporting and knowledge of where we are\nin preventing these infections. Without uniform and accurate\nreporting guidelines, which are understood by all healthcare\nproviders, further study of prevention methods could be\ninaccurate as a result of faulty reporting. This is a pivotal\narea, which must be closely studied to fill in any gaps that\ncould impede the progress of current and future studies.\nDifferences of Reporting: ICD-9/10\nThe CDC (2015a) determines criteria for defining CLABSI.\nThe ICD captures CLABSI based on provider diagnoses and\ntreatment. The top 10 leading ICD discharge diagnoses are\noften used by health services researchers and other research-\ners; yet, there is some evidence that discrepancies exist\nbetween classification of CLABSI by clinicians coding using\nICD and by infection preventionists applying CDC guide-\nlines. These discrepancies indicate a need for standard defi-\nnitions to be applied (Backman et al., 2010; Hazamy et al.,\nvided by the CDC. The CDC requires that each case be\nreviewed and categorized as a LCBI-1 or LCBI-2. Providers\ncode their diagnoses through ICD.\nThis review will now shift focus toward pay-for-perfor-\nmance programs, which are powerful mandates allowing\nMedicare to adjust reimbursement based on certain criteria\nPay-for-Performance\nThe \"Hospital Value-Based Purchasing\" program as out-\nlined by Medicare adjusts the amount that the government\nagency pays out to hospitals based on a total performance\nWoodward and Umberger 5\nscore (CMS, 2013). The total performance score is calcu-\nlated using clinical process of care (20%), patient experi-\nence of care (30%), efficiency (20%), and the outcome\n(30%). The clinical process of care focuses on five critical\nareas of care including acute myocardial infarctions, heart\nfailure, pneumonia, surgical care, and HAIs. Value-based\npurchasing for CLABSI was not implemented until 2015\n(CMS, 2013). Medicare wants improvement in these areas\nand has established a plan to reward good care and punish\nunsatisfactory care. The HAI section is particularly inter-\nesting, outlining the specific performance measures of giv-\ning patients an antibiotic within 1 hr of surgery, surgical\npatients being given the right kind of antibiotic to help pre-\nvent infection, and subsequently stopping unnecessary anti-\nbiotics within 24 hr after surgery. The patient experience of\ncare encompasses a wide variety of care domains, including\ncommunication with healthcare providers, pain manage-\nment, and overall rating of the hospital. Medicare reim-\nbursements are designed to efficiently incentivize hospitals\nto provide services at a reasonable cost. The spending is\nstandardized for geographic location and overall patient\nhealth status. The final piece in the total performance score\nis the outcome, assessed by 30-day mortality rates, which\ncan be linked to the overall quality of care that a patient\nTreatment for CLABSI can last anywhere from 7 days to 6\nweeks depending on the cultured organism and the patient's\nresponse to therapy (Han et al., 2010). The average cost per\ninpatient day in the United States is US$2,212, although this\nfigure likely underestimates daily cost due to most patients\nwith CLABSI being treated in a more expensive ICU setting\n(Kaiser Family Foundation, 2014). On average, CLABSI\ndiagnosis increases the cost of a hospital stay by US$30,919\nof cases, the hospital is responsible for covering these addi-\ntional costs (Zimlichman et al., 2013). Vancomycin is the\ntreatment of choice when treating CLABSI, and in instances\nof severe sepsis, severe illness, or an immunocompromised\npatient, coverage for gram-negative bacterial infection should\nbe included. These agents may include a \"fourth generation\ncephalosporin, a carbapenem, or a -lactam/-lactamase\ninhibitor combination, with or without an aminoglycoside\"\nDue to the novelty of these pay-for-performance pro-\ngrams, there is only a small pool of empirical studies\nusing both an experimental and control group for direct\ncomparison. It is likely that studies are currently being\nperformed as hospitals adapt to these new policies under\nthe ACA, but it is important to know whether or not these\nprograms are effective at improving long-term patient\noutcomes. Early research has found moderately positive\nresults from pay-for-performance, but it is the job of the\nresearchers to continue working to close the new gap,\nwhich has opened up with the advent of these pay-for-\nperformance programs.\nPay-for-Performance Influence on HAI\nA study was conducted to evaluate the pay-for-performance\nprogram on improving quality of care (Werner, Kolstad,\nStuart, & Polsky, 2011). Two hundred sixty hospitals were\nincluded in this program, with 780 hospitals used as the con-\ntrol group. The researchers used several methods to try to\ncreate congruency between the experimental and control\ngroups, including current hospital costs and risk-standard-\nized mortality rates. The top 20% of hospitals eligible for\nincentives received bonus funding from Medicare and\nMedicaid proportional to their current level of compensation.\nHospitals with poor trends or consistently high rates of hos-\npital-associated infection were forced to pay penalties as a\nresult of unsatisfactory performance. During the first 3 years,\nmore than half of the pay-for-performance hospitals achieved\nhigh performance scores, whereas less than a third of the\ncontrol group did. After 5 years, though, both groups became\nnearly identical in their performance scores. The hospitals\nthat saw the greatest improvement were those with low com-\npetition and a chance for large monetary reimbursement.\nFrom this study, it is obvious that more research needs to\ndone to assess the effectiveness of pay-for-performance pro-\ngrams, and also that these programs will need to be tailored\nspecifically to hospitals depending on a wide variety of fac-\ntors (Werner et al., 2011). Another study on pay-for-perfor-\nmance programs noted general improvement in hospitals as a\nresult of their implementation, but they also called for stud-\nies evaluating pay-for-performance programs in conjunction\nwith mandatory reporting laws (Kahn Iii et al., 2015).\nAnother study measuring similar variables also found that\nhospital costs decreased and patient satisfaction increased\nwhere these programs were in place (Stanowski, Simpson, &\nWhite, 2015). In general, it appears that initial studies on\npay-for-performance programs are finding positive out-\ncomes, but aspects of mandatory reporting are widely left out\nof their research.\nIn a study focused on the impact of pay-for-performance\nprograms in relation to hospital-operating margins, research-\ners found that hospitals already experiencing financial pres-\nsure (lowest quartile of operating margins) saw decreased\nCLABSI rates after the CMS halted reimbursement for hos-\npital-acquired conditions (Lee, Calderwood, Vaz, Jin, &\nGrant, 2015). Hospitals in the highest quartile of operating\nmargins did not see this decrease (Lee et al., 2015). This\nseems to indicate that the effectiveness of pay-for-perfor-\nmance programs is specific to each hospital's financial\nsituation.\nLimitations\nThis review was limited in scope and did not review studies\nfocused on patient-specific risk factors such as increased sus-\nceptibility to infections due to immunosuppression. The\nstudies examined were generally longitudinal in nature, and\n6 SAGE Open\nthe effectiveness of interventions was compared with obser-\nvations from before their implementation.\nConclusion\nAlthough research on CLABSIs has been widespread and\nfairly comprehensive, new federal legislation such as the\nACAhas created gaps in our knowledge about how the use of\nincentives and penalties affects reporting and incidence of\nHAIs such as CLABSIs. Studies have been conducted in\nvarious states on how effective these measures are at achiev-\ning their goals, but to truly capture its ramifications on a\nwidespread scale, each hospital needs individual analysis.\nStates and specific hospitals include a unique environment\nthat may respond well or poorly to generalized legislative\nmeasures and should be individually analyzed. Laws and\nlegal guidelines are perhaps one of the most drastic instances\nof inciting this change to happen. Obviously, some regula-\ntions may be unhelpful or even harmful in furthering health-\ncare's progress, but it is impossible to know for sure what the\nramifications are without focused study and analysis.\nAlthough it seems unlikely that we will ever live in a\nworld without these deadly infections, there is still obvious\nroom for improvement, which can reasonably and economi-\ncally be attained. New programs such as pay-for-perfor-\nmance have recently been established, which focus\nparticularly on rewarding hospitals who are successful at\nreducing their rates of HAIs and withholding funds from\nthose that are unsuccessful at doing so. Research of CLABSIs\nincludes prevention, development, detection, and reporting\nof CLABSIs. All of these are interrelated and necessitate fur-\nther research, especially by nurses. Nurses are in key roles to\nsave lives and reduce hospital costs by implementing best\npractices to decrease the incidence of CLABSI.\n"
