In the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\ndevelopment was evaluated by interviewing the mother regarding the child's history of school suspension or\nexpulsion and difficulty in getting along with others. After adjustment for family socioeconomic status, maternal\nmarital status and education, children's nutrition, and academic performance, the odds ratios of children with\nvarious concentrations of total cholesterol showed the children to be equally comfortable in their own peer\nsubculture and not to be different in the proportion that had seen a mental health professional. However, non-\nAfrican-American children with a serum total cholesterol concentration below the 25th percentile (<145 mg/dl)\nwere almost threefold more likely to have been suspended or expelled from schools than their peers with total\nconcluded that, among non-African-American children, low total cholesterol is associated with school suspension\nor expulsion and that low total cholesterol may be a risk factor for aggression or a risk marker for other biologic\nvariables that predispose to aggression.\nadolescent psychology; child psychology; cholesterol; juvenile delinquency; United States\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; DISC, Dietary Intervention Study in Children; NHANES III, Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey; STRIP, Special Turku Coronary Risk Factor Intervention Project; WRAT-R, Wide Range\nAchievement Test, Revised.\nEvidence from several large epidemiology and postmor-\ntem studies (1) reveals that serum cholesterol predicts\ncoronary disease incidence and mortality. Therefore, a num-\nber of professional organizations endorsed recommendations\nrestricting dietary intake of fat and cholesterol for children\naged 2 years and up in order to keep cholesterol levels low\nfrom an early age and to prevent the development of\narteriosclerosis in adulthood (2). However, the role of serum\ncholesterol in the neurodevelopment of children is uncertain,\nand associations between low serum cholesterol levels and\nnegative mood, decrements in cognitive function, and\nvarious types of aggressive behavior have been noted in\nadults and nonhuman primates (3\u00ad8). Cholesterol is now\nthought to be required for synaptic growth (9), and genetic\ndisorders of cholesterol synthesis are associated with mental\nretardation and suicidality (10, 11). Such issues and concerns\nhave tended (12\u00ad15) to hamper implementation of the fat\nrecommendations to children in the general population.\nResults from the Dietary Intervention Study in Children\n(DISC) (16), the Special Turku Coronary Risk Factor\nAmerican Journal of Epidemiology\nCopyright \u00aa 2005 by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health\nAll rights reserved\nPrinted in U.S.A.\nhave suggested that a low-saturated-fat, low-cholesterol diet\ndecreases the concentration of serum low density lipopro-\ntein cholesterol in children without detrimental effects on\ngrowth and psychosocial health. However, certain limita-\ntions in these studies constrain the validity of these\nconclusions as well as their generalizability to a broader\npopulation. All study subjects in STRIP were younger than\n5 years of age; minor neurodevelopment deficits are difficult\nto recognize during the first few years of life. The subjects in\nDISC were children with hyperlipemia (low density lipo-\nprotein cholesterol levels greater than the 80th percentile of\nchildren in the general population). Both STRIP and DISC\nwere conducted in select volunteer samples under intensive\nsurveillance and lowered serum cholesterol by no more than\n5 percent compared with control subjects (21). Population-\nwide longitudinal studies about the effects of blood\ncholesterol on neurodevelopment in children would be\nhighly informative, but such data are unlikely to be available\nin the near future because of prohibitive logistics and cost\n(22). Therefore, we examined the associations between\nserum cholesterol concentrations and psychosocial devel-\nopment of noninstitutionalized school-age children and\nadolescents using data from the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).\nStudy population\nThe NHANES III is a cross-sectional survey of the US\ncivilian noninstitutionalized population living in house-\nwas a stratified, multistage probability design with over-\nsampling of African Americans and Mexican Americans to\nallow more precise estimates for these subpopulations.\nDetailed descriptions of the survey have been published\nelsewhere (23). The NHANES III included medical and\ncognitive examinations and interviews conducted with\nsurvey children and proxy respondents. The sample for\nHousehold Youth Questionnaires and Youth and Proxy\nOf these children, 1,540 were excluded since validated\nhematologic data were not available. Proxy reports from\nsomeone other than the child's mother may not be as valid\nas, or comparable with, a mother's report; therefore, an\nadditional 791 children were further excluded because the\nproxy respondents were not their mothers. Because the\nbehavioral problems and school experience of mentally or\nphysically handicapped children are likely different from\nthose of other children, we excluded 757 children who\nattended special schools or classes as a result of impairment\n(including learning disabilities) or health problems, such as\ncerebral palsy, epilepsy/fit/convulsion, mental retardation,\nor muscle weakness (n \u00bc 185), or who had trouble seeing\nwith one or both eyes even when wearing glasses or con-\ntact lenses or had trouble hearing with one or both ears\nchildren and adolescents.\nMeasurements and variable definitions\nSerum cholesterol. Total cholesterol was measured en-\nzymatically (measurement of triglycerides and the calcula-\ntion of low density lipoprotein cholesterol require use of\nfasting samples, whereas less than half of the children were\nfasting at the time of phlebotomy). Initial exploratory\nanalyses indicated that a linear or U- or J-shaped association\ndid not exist and that using a single cutoff to dichotomize\nthe total cholesterol concentration was able to present the\nassociation sufficiently. We examined various cutoffs of the\ntotal cholesterol concentration and observed that the 25th\npercentile (145 mg/dl) of the total cholesterol distribution\namong the weighted study population was the optimal one.\nPsychosocial development. During the Youth and Proxy\nQuestionnaires interview, mothers were asked a series of\nquestions about their children's behaviors and social skills.\nPsychosocial development was measured by four dichoto-\nmous variables constructed from the mothers' answers to\nthese questions: 1) whether the child had ever seen\na psychiatrist, psychologist, or psychoanalyst about any\nemotional, mental, or behavioral problems (affirmed\nanswer: n \u00bc 296); 2) whether the child had ever been\nsuspended, excluded, or expelled from school (n \u00bc 341); 3)\nwhether the child was somewhat shy and slow to make\na new friend (n \u00bc 949); and 4) whether the child had\ndifficulties in getting along with others (n \u00bc 907).\nMajor covariates. The covariates were selected from the\nliterature (24\u00ad30) and included the following: the child's\nethnicity as reported by the mother, maternal education\n(high school or below vs. above high school), number of\ntimes the family had moved (three or more vs. less than\nthree), crowded dwelling (more than one person per room),\nand rural/urban classification of residence area (central or\nfringe counties of metropolitan areas of 1 million population\nor more vs. other counties). Since there were only 171 non-\nWhite, non-African-American children and since the\nmajority of the characteristics examined were similar\nbetween these children and the White children, we collapsed\nthese 171 children with the White children into one group\n(non-African-American children). Maternal marital status\nwas collapsed into two categories: single-parent household\n(included mothers who were married but their spouses were\nnot living in the household, widowed, divorced, separated,\nor never married) and married mothers with their spouses\nliving in the household. Total family income for the previous\n12 months was reported for categories ranging from less\nand $79,999. A poverty index ratio was then calculated by\ncomparing the midpoint for the category and the child's\nfamily sizewith the federal poverty line (poverty index ratio \u00bc\n1). These analyses used a three-level variable of poverty\nstatus: low income (poverty index ratio < 1.30, the federal\ncutpoint for eligibility for the Food Stamp Program); middle\nincome (poverty index ratio  3.0) (25). A child was\nclassified as food insufficient if the mother reported that the\nfamily either sometimes or often did not get enough food\nto eat.\nMothers rated their children's health as excellent, very\ngood, good, fair, or poor. A dichotomous variable was used in\nthe analyses, comparing children in fair or poor health with\nchildren with excellent, very good, or good health. During\nHousehold Family and Household Youth Questionnaires\ninterviews, the children were asked a series of questions\nabout their own substance abuse behaviors. Children were\nclassified as substance abusers (n \u00bc 220) if they answered\naffirmatively to at least one of these questions: 1) Have you\never used marijuana? (n \u00bc 139); 2) have you ever used crack\nor cocaine in any form? (n \u00bc 11); 3) have you smoked at least\n100 cigarettes during your entire life? (n \u00bc 66); 4) in the past\n12 months did you have at least 12 drinks of any kind of\nalcoholic beverage? (n \u00bc 141). We used standing height (in\nmeters) measured at the time of the examination as an\nindicator of past nutrition status and z scores of age-adjusted\nbody mass index as a surrogate variable of body image. Daily\ndietary energy intake was obtained from a 24-hour dietary\nrecall performed by mothers. Other nutrition covariates were\nserum albumin and total proteins. Data on these two variables\nwere available for children older than 11 years only and were\nused in the secondary analysis.\nThe Arithmetic and Reading subtests of the Wide Range\nAchievement Test, Revised (WRAT-R), and the Block\nDesign and Digit Span subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence\nScale for Children, Revised, were administered to all\nsubjects (23). The WRAT-R Arithmetic Subtest consists of\noral and written problems ranging from simple addition to\ncalculus, while the Reading Subtest assesses letter recogni-\ntion and word reading skills. In the Block Design Subtest, the\nchild replicates two-dimensional geometric patterns using\na set of three-dimensional cubes; this subtest is a measure of\nnonverbal reasoning. The Digit Span Subtest assesses short-\nterm and working memory by asking the child to repeat\na series of increasingly long number sequences forward and\nthen backward. The WRAT-R Arithmetic and Reading test\nscores were age standardized to a mean of 100 (standard\ndeviation: 15), while the Block Design and Digit Span test\nscores of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children,\nRevised, were age standardized to a mean of 10 (standard\ndeviation: 3).\nStatistical methods\nAs recommended by the National Center for Health\nStatistics, we used SUDAAN software (31) (SAS version\n7.5; SAS Institute, Inc., Research Triangle Park, North\nCarolina) with appropriate weighting and nesting variables.\nWe used logistic regression to estimate multivariable-\nadjusted odds ratios of a negative psychosocial indicator\nand corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals. Before\nmultivariable modeling, we examined the age-adjusted as-\nsociation between each psychosocial indicator and each\ncovariate. For illustration purposes only, all continuous\nvariables were categorized using quartiles or clinically rec-\nommended cutoffs, if available. A multivariable model was\ngenerated in a stepwise fashion for each psychosocial\nindicator. In the first step, the main effect and covariates,\nfor which the overall p values of age-adjusted odds ratios\nwere less than 0.25, were entered into the model. In the\nsecond step, the covariates with a p value greater than 0.10\nwere dropped, and the interactions among main effect and\ngender, urbanization of residence area, and ethnicity were\ntested. We kept the covariates with p values of regression\ncoefficients less than 0.05 (two sided) in multivariable\nmodels. However, to avoid overadjusting and to increase\nthe precision of estimates, we removed any covariate whose\naddition to the multivariable model changed the odds ratio\nof interest by less than 10 percent. Because preliminary\nanalysis indicated that a strong interaction ( p < 0.01) existed\nbetween serum total cholesterol and race for the history of\nschool suspension, we present the results of multivariable-\nadjusted logistic regression for the entire sample as well as\nby race. At the final stage of the analysis, we conducted\nsecondary regression analyses including the following: 1)\ndaily energy intakes (with or without log transformation) in\nchildren 8\u00ad16 years of age and 2) serum albumin and total\nprotein measurements in children 12\u00ad16 years of age to\nexamine whether inclusion of these variables altered the\nfindings. Regressions on all subjects who had valid data on\nserum cholesterol were also performed to examine potential\nbiases caused by exclusion of a large portion of the subjects\ndue to learning disability or other health problems.\nRESULTS\nAmong the 4,852 children included in the analyses, the\nweighted average age was 10.0 (standard error: 0.1) years,\n15.5 (standard error: 1.3) percent were African Americans.\nOf these children, 22.7 (standard error: 1.3) percent were\nliving with single mothers, 5.7 (standard error: 0.6) percent\ndid not have enough food to eat sometimes, and 8.4\n(standard error: 0.9) percent had ever been suspended from\nschool. Children excluded from analyses differed from those\nincluded in several respects. Compared with the participants\nincluded, those excluded were less healthy and more likely\nto live below the federal poverty line. As expected, the\nchildren and adolescents excluded were more likely to have\nseen a mental health professional for emotional or behav-\nioral problems, and they were more likely to have been\nsuspended or expelled from school.\nOf the four psychosocial indicators, a history of school\nsuspension or expulsion was associated with most of the\ncovariates analyzed (table 2), including low socioeconomic\nstatus, being male, being African American, reporting\nsubstance abuse, having poor health, and living with a single\nmother. Having seen a psychiatrist or psychologist was\nassociated with male gender, food insufficiency, and mater-\nnal marital status (single). Feeling shy or being slow to\nmake friends was significantly associated with living with\na single mother, low maternal education, and being African\nAmerican. Substance abuse was associated with increased\nodds of a history of school suspension and having seen\na psychologist or psychiatrist but with reduced odds of\nfeeling shy or being slow to make new friends.\nAfter adjustment for age and gender (table 3), children\nhaving low serum cholesterol levels did not differ from other\nchildren in whether or not they had ever seen a psychologist\nSerum Cholesterol and Psychosocial Development 693\nor psychiatrist, in their mother-rated social skills with peers,\nand in their level of comfort in their own peer subculture.\nHowever, children with low serum total cholesterol levels\nwere more likely than other children to have been suspended\nor expelled from school. When subjects were separated by\nrace, this association held specifically for non-African-\nAmerican children. For the children with high total\ncholesterol levels, the suspension prevalence among non-\nAfrican Americans was much lower than that of African\nAmericans. Among children with low total cholesterol\nlevels, suspension prevalence did not differ by race (table 3).\nThese analyses were repeated with adjustment of addi-\ntional psychosocial covariates (table 4). No new findings\nemerged, and the association between a low serum choles-\nterol level and a history of school suspension or expulsion\ntended to strengthen. Among non-African Americans,\na history of school suspension or expulsion was approxi-\nmately threefold higher for children with total cholesterol\nbelow the 25th percentile than for children with total\ncholesterol at or above the 25th percentile. All the estimates\nfor children aged 6\u00ad16 years remained essentially the same\nwhen including daily energy intakes (with or without log\ntransformation) from children aged 8\u00ad16 years, serum total\nprotein, and albumin from children aged 12\u00ad16 years as\nadditional variables in supplementary analyses (data not\nshown).

Proportions were reported as weighted percentage (standard\nerror), and continuous variables were reported as weighted means (standard error).\nz Children were excluded because 1) data on serum total cholesterol were not available (n \u00bc 1,540); 2) the main\nproxy respondents were not mothers (n \u00bc 791); or 3) children had any impairments (i.e., visual, hearing, mobility) or\nspecific developmental disabilities (i.e., mental retardation, cerebral palsy) or needed special education services\n(n \u00bc 757; 76% were due to hearing and visual problems).\n\u00a7 Among the children included in the current study, data on psychosocial development were missing for 1,341\n(seen psychologists), 731 (felt shy), and 733 (had difficulties in getting along with others).

These\nresults are important because they are the first to demonstrate\na statistically significant, ethnicity-dependent association\nbetween serum total cholesterol and aggressive behaviors\nfrom a national sample of noninstitutionalized, school-age\nchildren. This association persists even after adjustment for\nmany other factors, including cognitive and academic perfor-\nmance and nutrition status, which are known to place child-\nren's emotional and behavioral development at risk.\nThe behaviors that lead to school suspension have been\nseen as ``red flags'' to identify students with serious\nbehavioral problems. Prior studies reveal that over two thirds\nof school suspensions and expulsions are ordered in response\nto acts of physical aggression (27, 30). Therefore, the results\nof the current study are consistent with the majority of\nprevious studies examining the associations between low\nserum cholesterol and various forms of aggression in adults.\nWith few exceptions (32), significant associations have been\nobserved from cross-sectional studies (7, 33), cohort samples\n(5), general population studies (5), psychiatric patients and\ncriminals (13\u00ad15), and controlled dietary studies conducted\nin nonhuman primates (34). In particular, low total choles-\nterol has been associated with the onset of conduct disorder\nduring childhood among male criminals (7). The current\nstudy extends prior literature by showing an ethnicity-\ndependent association among children and adolescents. Re-\nsearch across the age spectrum and including other ethnic-\nities might be helpful in disentangling the mystery of the\nassociation between serum cholesterol and violence. As of\ntoday, almost all studies examining the association between\nserum cholesterol levels and violencewere carriedout among\nCaucasian adults. Researchers have speculated that the\nobserved association of low cholesterol with violence may\nbe a product of confounding. However, it is unlikely that\nconfounding effects from occult factors would selectively\naffect non-African-American children only.\nFrom prior literature on adults, it is unclear whether there\nis a temporal association between serum cholesterol and\nviolent behavior. By showing a statistically significant\nassociation from children and adolescents, the current study\nprovides indirect evidence that a low serum cholesterol level\nprecedes aggressive behaviors. This study used school\nsuspension as a marker of early aggression. Early aggression\nhas been identified as one of the strongest predictors of later\naggression and criminal involvement (35, 36). Children who\nTABLE 2.

Almost half of those who initiated violent\nbehavior between 10 and 12 years of age eventually became\nchronic violent offenders (37). However, temporality is just\none of Hill's criteria for a causal connection as described by\nGolomb (4), and a putative cause-effect relation between low\nserum cholesterol and violence awaits further study. Low\ntotal cholesterol may represent a biologic marker rather than\na risk factor for childhood-onset conduct disorder and violent\nbehavior. Cholesterol and aggressive behavior may not be\ncausally related to one another.\nIt is possible that at least part of the association of low\ntotal cholesterol with school suspension is explainable by\na reverse causation. School suspension appears to have\nserious negative psychiatric consequences, including ele-\nvated depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disor-\nder (38). Post-traumatic stress disorder may result in a fall in\ncholesterol concentration, and depressed cholesterol may\npersist for years in chronic medical conditions (39). Low or\nlowered cholesterol has been linked to other biologic factors\nthat predispose to nonatherosclerotic diseases (40). Low\ntotal cholesterol or lipoprotein concentrations may result in\nimpaired delivery of lipids and fat-soluble nutrients to cells\nthat are activated during the immune response and involved\nin tissue repair, thus possibly impairing defense against\nendotoxins and viruses (41\u00ad43). In any case, both psycho-\nlogical and biologic consequences (38) of school suspension\nor expulsion on children and adolescents deserve further\nexamination.\nMany biologic mechanisms have been postulated to\nexplain the association between serum lipids and violence.\nCholesterol and fats have many physiologic roles and may\ninfluence brain function and behavior through modification\nof membranes and through effects on production, reuptake,\nor metabolism of neurotransmitters. Several studies in\nnonhuman primates and humans suggest a specific connec-\ntion between low or lowered fats or cholesterol levels and\nlow or lowered serotonin activity (44, 45). In humans, the\nassociation between decreased serotonin and impulsivity\nand aggression is well documented (45, 46). Researchers\nTABLE 3.

Most\nchildren and adolescents suspended from school indeed\nattributed their infractions to a lack of self-control, rather\nthan blaming others (30). This study, however, is unable to\nclarify whether the association of total cholesterol and\naggression is a reflection of genetic covariance or a direct\ncausal association. Though a difference in the association\nby race/ethnicity was found in the current study, we are\nnot able to rule out the possibility that this difference was\ndue to basal prevalence. The prevalence of school suspen-\nsion is already high among African-American children, so\nthe marginal impact from lower total cholesterol, if any,\nwould be relatively small compared with that on non-\nAfrican-American children, among whom the basal preva-\nlence of school suspension is low.\nThe results of the current study should be viewed with\ncaution. As in all research using self-report measures, the\npsychosocial indicators used in the current study represented\nthe perceptions of therespondents or proxies (30).The survey\nformat is subject to multiple biases, including social de-\nsirability. In addition, because the responses to the survey\nitems were collapsed or originally designed as dichotomized\nvariables, the range of possible responses was restricted,\npossibly resulting in misclassifications. For example, school\nsuspension or expulsion is a highly contextualized decision,\nand the severity of rule violations leading to a school\nsuspension varies case by case (29). The heterogeneity of\nmeasurement may lead to measurement errors, resulting\nin an attenuation of the true relations. Depressive symptoms\nand attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder are two major\nreasons for children and adolescents to see psychiatrists or\npsychologists (48, 49). Because depressive symptoms and\nattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder differ etiologically,\ngrouping children with depressive symptoms, attention-\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder, or other developmental-\nbehavioral problems together might account for the failure\nto identify an association between serum cholesterol and a\nhistory of seeing psychiatrists or psychologists.\nThis study has several other limitations. First, the findings\nwere based on a cross-sectional survey. The duration of\nexposure to abnormal levels of serum cholesterol is un-\nknown. Second, although the richness of NHANES III allows\nus to delineate the relation between serum cholesterol and\npsychosocial development after adjustment for many factors,\nwe were unable to adjust for other important potential\nconfounders, such as duration of poverty, maternal mental\nhealth, serum essential fatty acids, or long chain poly-\nunsaturated fatty acids, which have been demonstrated to\nbe associated with behavioral development (50). However, it\nwas unlikely that these unmeasured factors selectively\nconfounded the association for non-African-American chil-\ndren only. Finally, the samples of the current study may\nrepresent only minor offenders. Institutionalized children\nand children in special classes were excluded. Therefore, the\nability to identify a strong association between total choles-\nterol and aggression may have been constrained by not\nsampling those who may have been institutionalized in the\njuvenile justice system because of serious violent offending.\nThe current study has several unique strengths as well.\nExisting data suggest that social skills are associated with\nmicro- and macronutrients in animal or human adults (51).\nMany of these associations, however, are difficult to assess\nin infants or toddlers with the degree of reliability and\nprecision that is possible in older children (52). Thus, if any,\nthe relation of serum cholesterols and neurobehaviors in\nschool-age children may be more cogent. Children of the\nNHANES III were randomly selected from the noninstitu-\ntionalized US population; therefore, our results should be\nfairly generalizable to children in the United States.\nIn summary, this study reports a statistically significant\nassociation between school suspension or expulsion and low\ntotal cholesterol among non-African-American children and\nadolescents from a multiethnic national sample. The finding\ncorroborates and extends the existing literature linking low\ntotal cholesterol and aggressive behaviors in adults. Low\ncholesterol may be a risk factor for aggressive behavior,\na risk marker for other biologic substances or genotypes that\nTABLE 4.
