The consensus is\nthat cognitive performance can be optimized and main-\ntained by modifiable lifestyle factors and engagement in\nhealth-promoting or protective behaviors (Yaffe et al.,\n2009). Previous studies (e.g., Lachman, Agrigoroaei,\nthat engaging in frequent cognitive activities is associated\nwith superior cognitive performance. Three other modifi-\nable psychosocial and behavioral factors are consistently\nfound to show positive associations with cognition: control\nbeliefs, quality of social support, and physical exercise.\nAlthough their individual benefits have been shown in past\nwork, they have not been studied together, in an additive\napproach, or considered in the context of physical health or\nphysical risk factors such as being overweight, smoking,\nhaving alcohol, or drug problems, in a national sample of\nadults with a wide age range. Thus, the goal of the present\nstudy was to examine the combined contribution of psycho-\nlogical, social, and physical factors to cognitive functioning\nand change and to consider their possible protective effects\nbeyond the role of sociodemographic variables, the well-\nestablished risk factors, and cognitive activities.\nBetween-person Heterogeneity in Cognition\nThere is widespread evidence for age differences in cogni-\ntive abilities (Salthouse, 2009). Within age groups, interindi-\nvidual differences have traditionally been explained by\nsociodemographic inequalities such as level of educational\nattainment (Alley, Suthers, & Crimmins, 2007). Another\nexplanatory factor, that is becoming more and more visible in\nthe theoretical and empirical models of cognitive decline, is\nphysical health. The conjoint trajectories of health and cogni-\ntion are complex (Spiro & Brady, 2008). There is evidence\nthat physical health and cognitive functioning are interdepen-\ndent, in the sense that they share common variance and un-\nderlying etiologies. Beside the role of physical health level,\nthose adults with health risk factors such as being overweight\n(Nilsson & Nilsson, 2009), smoking (Anstey, von Sanden,\nSalim, & O'Kearney, 2007), and having alcohol problems\n(Lopes, Furtado, Ferrioli, Litvoc, & de Campos Bottino,\n2010) are more likely to have poor cognitive performance. In\naddition, there is increasing evidence that modifiable psycho-\nlogical, social, and physical behavioral factors including a\nsense of control, quality of social support, and physical exer-\ncise are associated with improved cognitive performance\nSeeman, Lusignolo, Albert, & Berkman, 2001).\nCognitive Functioning in Midlife and Old Age: Combined\nEffects of Psychosocial and Behavioral Factors\nStefan Agrigoroaei and Margie E. Lachman\nDepartment of Psychology, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts.\nObjectives. This study examined the joint protective contribution of psychosocial and behavioral factors to cognitive\nfunctioning and 10-year change, beyond the influence of sociodemographic factors, physical risk factors, health status,\nand engagement in cognitive activities.\nMethods. Participants were from the National Study of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS), ages 32\u00ad84 at Time 2,\nand a subsample, the Boston Longitudinal Study (BOLOS), ages 34\u00ad84 at Time 2. We computed a composite protective\nmeasure including control beliefs, quality of social support, and physical exercise variables at two occasions, 9\u00ad10 years\napart. Cognition was assessed at Time 2 in MIDUS and at both occasions in BOLOS. Multiple regressions were used for\nanalysis.\nResults. In MIDUS, the more of the protective factors, the better the cognitive performance, and the protective com-\nposite moderated education differences in memory. In BOLOS, the Time 1 composite predicted change in reasoning\nabilities, with a greater protective effect for those with lower education.\nDiscussion. A combination of modifiable psychosocial and behavioral factors has both concurrent and long-term\nprotective effects on cognition in adulthood. The results are promising in that educational disparities in memory and\nreasoning were reduced, suggesting possible interventions to protect against cognitive declines.\nKey Words: Aging--Cognition--Control beliefs--Health--Physical exercise--Social support.\nThe contribution of control beliefs\nAccording to a variety of studies, one central ingredient\nfor good cognitive performance is control beliefs (Bielak\nMiller & Lachman, 2000). Control beliefs involve the per-\nception that one can influence what happens in one's life\nand to what extent one's actions can bring about desired\noutcomes, such as good cognitive functioning. It includes\nbeliefs or expectations about one's abilities and perceptions\nabout external constraints (Lachman, 2006). A lowered\nsense of control may have affective, behavioral, motiva-\ntional, and physiological effects, including greater levels of\nstress and anxiety (Kirschbaum et al., 1995), lower levels of\neffort, persistence, and strategy use (Hertzog, McGuire, &\nas less frequent engagement in memory tasks (West &\nYassuda, 2004), which can impact cognitive performance.\nAlthough much of the work has been cross-sectional and\ncorrelational, there is longitudinal evidence that those who\nhave higher control beliefs improve more on cognitive tests\nwith practice and also are less likely to show aging-related\ndeclines in cognitive functioning over time (Caplan &\nThe contribution of social support\nSocial interactions involve a combination of supportive\nand stressful experiences. There is ample evidence that so-\ncial exchanges, broadly defined, are related to cognitive\nfunctioning (B\u00e9land, Zunzunegui, Alvarado, Otero, &\nfrom others, some have shown that emotional support, but\nnot instrumental support, is positively related to better over-\nall cognitive performance (Seeman et al., 2001). Among the\nexplanatory mechanisms that have been considered, physi-\nological factors such as stress hormones, immune function-\ning, and inflammatory processes affect the central nervous\nsystem and may be exacerbated for those with lower social\nsupport (Berkman, Glass, Brissette, & Seeman, 2000).\nThe contribution of physical exercise\nThe benefits of physical exercise for cognitive outcomes\nare widely documented (Colcombe & Kramer, 2003; Jedrz-\niewski, Lee, & Trojanowski, 2007). As shown by interven-\ntions and epidemiologic studies, those who engage in\nregular exercise are more likely to perform better on cogni-\ntive tasks such as memory (Lachman, Neupert, Bertrand, &\nand speed of processing (Dik, Deeg, Visser, & Jonker,\n2003). Studies have suggested that the effects of exercise\nare most pronounced for executive functioning (Colcombe\nto long-term effects of physical activities, some results\nshowed that engaging in exercise between the ages of\n15 and 25 can lead to better cognition in old age (Dik et al.,\n2003). Possible mechanisms linking exercise and cognitive\nhealth include increased levels of oxygenation (Hertzog\net al., 2008). Also, work on brain changes has revealed an\nincrease in neuromuscular activity and cerebral blood flow\n(Rogers, Meyer, & Mortel, 1990) and the release of neuro-\ntrophins and catecholamines (McMorris, Collard, Corbett,\nDicks, & Swain, 2008) as processes associated with physi-\ncal activity that are also beneficial for cognition.\nThe combined effects of psychosocial and behavioral\nfactors\nPrevious studies on predictors of cognitive functioning\nfocus on the independent contributions of key factors. More\nrecently, there has been an emphasis on the cumulative ef-\nfects of multiple sources. For example, Sabia et al. (2009)\nshowed that the total number of unhealthy risk behaviors in\nwhich one person engages, such as smoking, heavy drink-\ning, unhealthy nutrition, and lack of physical activity, was\nassociated with low cognitive performance in later life. The\nprocedure of aggregating different sources of influence is\nconsistent with studies from the medical literature suggest-\ning that health-related lifestyle factors are not randomly dis-\ntributed in the general population, but that they tend to\noccur in combination with each other within individuals\n(Poortiga, 2007). By analogy, one can think about the per-\nsonal cardiovascular risk index or about allostatic load\n(Seeman et al., 2004) that comprise several health indica-\ntors and predict disease better than individual markers. We\nbelieve that developing a meaningful summary score of\npsychosocial and behavioral domains on which respondents\nhad an adaptive level is theoretically and empirically inter-\nesting. Of interest is whether there is additive value for en-\ngaging in multiple adaptive behaviors by considering an\nindex of protective factors. Only a modest literature has ad-\ndressed the relationship between multiple protective psy-\nchosocial and behavioral factors and cognition (e.g., Albert\nand we know of no studies showing their combined effects.\nOne related study (Karp et al., 2006) considered the com-\nbined mental, physical, and social components embodied\nsimultaneously in leisure activities and linked them to the\nrisk for dementia. The most beneficial effects were obtained\nfor those with higher scores in all three or in two of the\ncomponents. Our study represents a similar approach with a\nfocus on individual differences in normal cognitive func-\ntioning for a middle-aged and older sample. Compared with\nthe previous work, largely focused on the positive associa-\ntion between engagement in mentally stimulating activities\nthe current study considered the role of \"noncognitive\"\nbehaviors and psychosocial factors. We analyzed frequent\nengagement in vigorous physical activities in combination\nwith high control beliefs and quality of social support as\nprotective factors for cognitive performance and change.\nThe current study\nThe present study used data from the Midlife in\nthe United States (MIDUS; Brim, Ryff, & Kessler, 2004)\nStudy (BOLOS). The BOLOS measurements were taken\napproximately one year after each of the MIDUS measure-\nments. MIDUS was designed to investigate the role of\nbehavioral, social, psychological, biological, and neurologi-\ncal factors in understanding physical and mental health as\npeople age. Thus, it has the benefit of data on a diverse pop-\nulation in terms of sociodemographic profiles and levels of\nphysical health and cognitive functioning. The general goal\nof the present study was to analyze whether a protective\ncomposite comprising a strong sense of control over life\noutcomes, high quality of social relationships with partners,\nfriends and family, and frequent vigorous physical exercise\nis associated with better cognitive performance in MIDUS\nand maintaining better cognitive functioning over a 10-year\nperiod in BOLOS. We expected a main effect of this\naggregate over and above the role of sociodemographic\nvariables, physical risk factors, health status, and frequency\nof engagement in cognitive activities.\nAt MIDUS Time 2, when our variables of interest were\nmeasured cross-sectionally, we hypothesized that the more\nof the psychosocial and behavioral factors present, the bet-\nter the cognitive performance. Also, we analyzed if the\nmagnitude of the combined effect of the factors on cogni-\ntive functioning would vary for the older adults and those\nwith lower education (i.e., those considered at higher risk\nfor poor cognitive performance). We then examined to what\nextent changes in the number of protective factors from\nTime 1 to Time 2 were associated with better cognition at\nThe BOLOS study allowed us to take a first look at indi-\nvidual differences in cognitive decline. We predicted that\nthe protective composite at Time 1 would account for varia-\ntions in change between the two waves of the BOLOS study.\nWe also tested if change in the number of factors over time\npredicted change in cognition and whether the protective\ncomposite led to better levels of cognitive maintenance in\nolder people and respondents with lower education, those\nconsidered most vulnerable to declines.\nMethods\nParticipants\nA national probability sample (N = 4,238) of noninstitu-\ntionalized adults from the 48 contiguous states was selected\nusing random-digit dialing (RDD) of telephone numbers\nwith age and gender information about the household com-\nposition, with an overall response rate of 70% for the tele-\nphone interview (Brim et al., 2004). The study also included\nsiblings (N = 949) of the main respondents, randomly\nselected from the RDD sample, as well as a subpopulation of\ntwins (N = 1,913) obtained after screening a representative\nnational sample of approximately 50,000 households. At\nretention rate, adjusted for mortality, was 75% (N = 4,955),\n12.44). As is typically found, those who participated at the\nsecond wave showed positive selection on most variables\n(Table 1), compared with those who dropped out of the study.\nMIDUS participants, ranging in age from 24 to 74 years\ndrawn in the Boston area, were successfully recruited to\nparticipate in BOLOS. Within one year of completion of\nthe MIDUS Time 2, 222 people from BOLOS were located;\n(68%) participated. Their ages at Time 2 ranged from 34 to\nwho did not participate in BOLOS Time 2, longitudinal\nparticipants from the Boston area were more educated--\nTable 1. Comparison Between the Longitudinal Participants and the Dropouts in Midlife in the United States Study\nNote: p values for means are derived from independent samples t-tests; p values for percentages are derived from c2 tests.\nMeasures\nCognition.--Cognitive measures were collected by tele-\nphone at Time 2 in MIDUS and at Time 1 and Time 2 in\nperson for BOLOS.\nMIDUS cognitive battery. In MIDUS, seven cognitive di-\nmensions were tested using the Brief Test of Adult Cogni-\ntion by Telephone (Lachman & Tun, 2008; Tun & Lachman,\n2008). This included two measures of episodic memory\n(immediate and delayed free recall of 15 words), working\nmemory span (backward digit span--the highest span\nachieved in repeating strings of digits in reverse order), ver-\nbal fluency (the number of words produced from the catego-\nry of animals in 60 s), inductive reasoning (completing a\npattern in a series of 5 numbers), processing speed (the\nnumber of digits produced by counting backward from 100\nin 30 s), and attention switching and inhibitory control (the\nStop and Go Switch Task; Tun & Lachman, 2008). For the\nlatter task, reaction times were calculated with the mean of\nswitch and nonswitch trial latencies on a task requiring al-\nternating between the \"normal\" condition (i.e., respond\n\"Go\" to the stimulus \"Green\" and \"Stop\" to the stimulus\n\"Red\") and the \"reverse\" condition (i.e., respond \"Stop\" to\nthe stimulus \"Green\" and \"Go\" to the stimulus \"Red\"). La-\ntencies were multiplied by (\u00ad1), so higher scores would cor-\nrespond to faster reaction times. Following exploratory and\nconfirmatory factor analysis (Lachman et al., 2010), two in-\ncomputed--episodic memory (immediate and delayed\nword recall) and executive functioning (all other measures).\nThe two cognitive factor scores were computed as standard-\nized means of the z-scored measures loading on the factors.\nBOLOS cognitive battery. As shown by the confirmatory\nfactor analysis in Miller & Lachman (2000), tasks at BO-\nLOS Time 1 formed a four-factor model: short-term memo-\nry, speed of processing, reasoning, and vocabulary. The\nmemory factor was comprised of forward and backward\ndigit span (participants were read a string of numbers and\nwere asked to recall them in a forward and backward order,\nrespectively) and Serial 7's (participants were asked to\ncount backwards by sevens from a given starting number;\nFolstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975). The speed factor con-\ntained letter comparison (participants judged two rows of\nletters to be the same or different; Salthouse, Kausler, &\nSaults, 1990) and digit symbol substitution (participants\nwere given a series of blank boxes with symbols above them\nand had to fill in numbers corresponding to the symbols as\nindicated by a provided legend; Wechsler, 1997). The rea-\nsoning factor, which captured visuospatial reasoning and\nfluid intelligence, combined letter series--inductive reason-\ning (participants detected patterns in series of letters by de-\ntermining the letter that would logically follow; Schaie,\n1985) and Ravens Advanced Progressive Matrices--figural\nrelations (Raven, Raven, & Court, 1991). Vocabulary was\nmeasured using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale vo-\ncabulary task (participants were given a word to define and\nreceived points based on the completeness and accuracy of\ntheir response; Wechsler, 1997). To compute each factor,\nfirst, a z-score of each measure was taken, and then the\nmean of these z-scores was standardized. The Time 2 cogni-\ntive factors and measures were standardized using the\nmeans and SDs from Time 1.\nFrequency of engaging in cognitive activities.--The cogni-\ntive activity variable (see Lachman et al., 2010) was created\nby averaging the self-reported frequencies on a 6-point scale\n(1 = never to 6 = daily) of engaging in four cognitive activities:\nreading books, magazines, or newspapers; doing word games\nsuch as crossword, puzzles, or scrabble; attending educational\nlectures or courses; and writing (e.g., letters, journal entries).\nPsychosocial and behavioral factors.--Control beliefs.\nPerceived control over outcomes in life was assessed with a\n.87), computed by averaging scores on two subscales from\nthe MIDUS sense of control scale (Lachman & Weaver,\n1998), namely personal mastery (e.g., I can do just about\nanything I really set my mind to) and perceived constraints\n(e.g., What happens in my life is often beyond my control).\nThe scores range from 1 (strongly agree) to 7 (strongly dis-\nagree) and were reverse coded for personal mastery.A high-\ner value indicates higher sense of control.\nQuality of social support. We included items reflecting\nsocial support and reverse coded items reflecting social\nstrain for close relationships. This measure (Cronbach's a\non 12 items assessing socioemotional aspects of social sup-\nport (e.g., How much do members of your family really care\nabout you?) and 12 items assessing social strain (e.g., How\noften do members of your family make too many demands\non you?) the participants experienced in their relationships\nwith family, friends, and spouse/partner (Lachman, R\u00f6cke,\nscores range from 1 (never) to 4 (often), with a higher value\nindicating greater quality of social support.\nPhysical exercise. At Time 1, participants reported the fre-\nquency of engaging in vigorous physical activities (e.g.,\nrunning or lifting heavy objects) to work up a sweat, during\nthe summer months and the winter months (Cotter &\nLachman, 2010). The physical exercise score was the mean\nof summer and winter ratings, which range from 1 (never)\nto 6 (several times a week or more).At Time 2, six questions\nassessing the participant's frequency of vigorous physical\nactivities were used. These six questions referred to fre-\nquency of physical activities during the summer and the\nwinter months, in three different settings (i.e., home, work,\nand leisure), with ratings from 1 (never) to 6 (several times\na week). We computed the mean of the summer and winter\nratings for all three settings and used the highest of these\nscores as the physical exercise score. At both occasions, a\nhigher score indicates more frequent physical exercise.\nPsychosocial and behavioral protective composite. We as-\nsigned the participants a score of 0 (below the median) or 1\n(equal to or above the median) for each psychosocial and\nbehavioral factor: control beliefs (MIDUS Median Time 1 =\nsupport, 4.5 (Time 1) and 4 (Time 2) for physical exercise.\nAt each occasion of measurement, one behavioral composite\nwas obtained by summing the assigned scores, for the par-\nticipants with available data on all protective factors. The\ndecision to create the composite using an unweighted sum is\nbased on previous work on accumulated risk (e.g., allostatic\nload, Gruenewald, Seeman, Karlamangla, & Sarkisian,\n2009). Also, it allows a parsimonious measure that is invari-\nant across all our dependent variables. The computed vari-\nables ranged from 0 to 3, with the higher values indicating a\ngreater number of factors at the higher level. The distributions\nfor each time point as well as for change over time are pre-\nsented in Supplementary Tables 5\u00ad7 (in MIDUS, 20.9% of the\nparticipants increased their protective composite by one factor,\n5.1% by two, and .5% by three; in BOLOS, the corresponding\nSociodemographic variables.--We examined age, sex\n(\u00ad1 = men, 1 = women), level of education in years (ranging\nfrom 6 to 20 years), and self-assessed race (\u00ad1 = non-\nHispanic White, 1 = all others).\nPhysical Risk Factors\nWaist circumference.--The circumference of the waist, a\nreliable indicator of obesity (Chen & Guo, 2008), was mea-\nsured in inches at the level of the navel and reported by the\nparticipant at both times in MIDUS. For the data analysis, this\nvariable was standardized separately for men (Time 1: M =\nSmoking. At both occasions in MIDUS, participants were\nasked if they currently smoke cigarettes regularly (\u00ad1 = no,\nAlcohol or drug problems. Participants reported if they have\nexperienced or have been treated for alcohol or drug prob-\nlems during the past 12 months, at MIDUS Time 1 and\nHealth status.--This measure taken at Time 1 assessed\nhow many of the following conditions the participants report-\ned ever having: diabetes; stroke; lupus; human immunodefi-\nciency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; multiple\nsclerosis, epilepsy or other neurological disorders; cancer; or\nheart trouble (e.g., heart attack). Participants were assigned a\nscore of 1 for any of the chronic conditions. The final score\ncould range from 0 to 7.\nStatistical Analysis\nFor the MIDUS analyses, we used all the available data.\nHowever, we removed the 151 BOLOS participants from\nthe MIDUS analyses, to avoid redundancy. We used hier-\narchical multiple regression models to examine the effects\nof the protective composite on episodic memory and ex-\necutive functioning over and above the role of sociodemo-\ngraphic variables, physical risk factors, health status, and\ncognitive activities (Step 2), and whether the age and edu-\ncation differences in cognition can be moderated by the\nnumber of behavioral factors (Step 3). In order to explore\nhow change in the number of protective factors over time\naffected cognitive performance, we used as concurrent\npredictors the Time 1 protective composite and the differ-\nence between the two occasions (Time 2 level \u00ad Time 1\nlevel). All regression models adjusted for the effects of\nsociodemographic variables, the physical risk factors,\nhealth status, and engagement in cognitive activities\nwhich were all measured at Time 2. As our sample also\nincluded siblings of the main respondents and a subpopu-\nlation of twins, we also ran models using the cluster op-\ntion in STATA (StataCorp, 2009). This model takes\ndependencies into account using robust standard errors by\nclustering at the family level (see Supplementary Tables 8\nFor the BOLOS analyses, we used all available data\nfrom the 151 longitudinal participants. The measures of\nthe protective factors and all the covariates came from\nMIDUS variables, and cognitive performance was as-\nsessed in BOLOS within 12 months after the MIDUS\nTime 1 and Time 2 interviews. In order to look at predic-\ntors of change in cognition, we regressed the cognitive\nfactor from Time 2 on the same factor measured at Time\n1 and entered sociodemographic variables, physical risk\nfactors, health status, and the protective composite from\nTime 1 (Cohen, Cohen, West, & Aiken, 2003). At the last\nstep, we entered the interaction terms with education and\nage, in order to explore if the association between the\nprotective composite and cognitive change varied by age\nor educational attainment. Moreover, a separate regression\nmodel tested whether change between Time 1 and Time 2\nin the protective composite accounted for cognitive change\nin BOLOS, following the same procedure as for MIDUS.\nFor correlations of all variables, see Supplementary Tables\nResults\nMIDUS\nThe results from the multiple regression models indicate\nsociodemographic differences in cognitive performance. In\nthe first step of the regression model, advanced age was neg-\natively associated with episodic memory--Table 2; b = \u00ad.33,\nassociation was obtained between the level of formal educa-\np < .001. Thus, our results are consistent with previous re-\nsearch defining older adults and those with low education as\ngroups most at risk for poor cognitive performance. Socio\ndemographic variables along with physical risk factors,\nhealth status, and engagement in cognitive activities ac-\ncounted for a significant percent of variance in memory, R2 =\nline with our predictions, over and above the role of these\ncovariates, the number of behavioral protective factors was\np < .001, and added a significant percent of explained vari-\nspectively. The more protective domains people are engaged\nin, the better their cognitive performance (Figure 1), and the\nprotective composite was equally beneficial across the board\nTable 3.

The outcome and all the predictors were measured at Time 2. Age, education, and the protective composite score were centered to the mean.\nfor people of all ages. The results revealed that the associa-\ntion between education and cognition was significantly\nreduced by the number of protective factors (Figure 2), but\n.015. The memory scores of people with fewer years of for-\nmal education who engaged in three protective behaviors\nwere more comparable to those of respondents with higher\neducation. Finally, cognitive performance was significantly\nassociated with increases in the number of protective factors\nbetween the two waves of MIDUS. While controlling for the\nTime 1 composite and all other covariates at Time 2, increas-\ning the number of protective factors was significantly related\n.036. Over and above the psychosocial and behavioral pro-\nfile at Time 1, engaging in more protective behaviors over\ntime was related to higher Time 2 executive functioning\n(in MIDUS, among all participants who increased by one,\ntwo, or three factors, 35.96% increased in social support,\nin physical exercise; in BOLOS, the corresponding per-\never, positive changes in the protective composite were\nnot significantly related to better episodic memory beyond\nBOLOS\nThis subsample of MIDUS allowed us to look at change\nin cognitive functioning and analyze cognitive decline in\nrelation to the number of protective factors. For the four\ncognitive factors, there were significant mean differences\nover time for short-term memory, speed of processing, and\nreasoning--stability coefficients and mean differences be-\nSD = .82); for each set of analysis, the maximum number of\nlongitudinal participants was used. There was considerable\ncross-occasion stability in all factors. Individual differences\nin change in short-term memory and reasoning were sig-\nnificantly associated with age. However, the Time 1 protec-\ntive composite was positively associated with change only\nfor reasoning (Table 4), beyond the role of sociodemo-\ngraphic variables, physical risk factors, and health status, b\ntion terms between the protective composite and age and\neducation were entered in the model, the number of factors\nreduced the association between level of education and rea-\ning the effects of change in the protective composite\nNumber of Psychosocial and Behavioral Factors\nEpisodic Memory (z-scores)\nNumber of Psychosocial and Behavioral Factors\nExecutive Functioning (z-scores)\nFigure 1.

Whereas\nprevious studies have examined these factors individually,\nthe present study demonstrates the cumulative association\nand protective value for cognitive functioning. Interest-\ningly, the effects of the protective factors were equally ben-\neficial across adulthood and into old age. Another key\npromising finding was that education differences in epi-\nsodic memory and declines in reasoning abilities were sig-\nnificantly attenuated as a function of the number of\nprotective factors. In previous work, we had a similar find-\ning in that engaging in frequent cognitive activity compen-\nsated for education differences in episodic memory\n(Lachman et al., 2010). In the current study, this mitigating\nrole was extended to noncognitive protective factors. This\nsuggests that the cognitive risks traditionally associated\nwith low educational attainment can be attenuated by mod-\nifying a large spectrum of lifestyle factors. However, for\nexecutive functioning, the effects of education were not re-\nduced by the protective factors as they were for episodic\nmemory. Perhaps, one clue comes from the BOLOS analy-\nses. In that case, changes in reasoning were attenuated by\nthe protective factor, especially for those with lower educa-\ntion. Thus, it may be that education effects for those aspects\nof cognitive performance that depend on strategic behav-\niors are more likely to be attenuated with psychosocial and\nbehavioral factors. In contrast, education differences in-\nvolving speed and attentional processes may be less ame-\nnable to behavioral factors.\nEngaging in a greater number of protective lifestyle fac-\ntors was associated with better cognition both in the cross-\nsectional and longitudinal analyses. The patterns obtained\nin MIDUS also showed that those who adopted additional\nprotective behaviors between the two occasions of measure-\nment showed improved executive functioning. However,\nincreases in protective behaviors did not improve episodic\nmemory or reasoning beyond the protective effects at Time\n1. Further work is needed to explore why only executive\nfunctioning was related to changes in protection.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first time that the combined\ncontribution of psychosocial and behavioral factors to cog-\nnitive performance has been analyzed, and these results\nhave valuable public health relevance. Importantly, the\nprotective factors we examined are modifiable. Several\nstudies have shown and reviewed the efficacy of interven-\ntions to change control beliefs (e.g., Lachman, Neupert, &\nAgrigoroaei, 2011), physical activity (e.g., Yan, Wilber,\nAguirre, & Trejo, 2009), and social support (e.g., Berkman\ncould be considered in the design of future multiple-behavior\ninterventions or lifestyle programs (Small et al., 2006).\nAlso, knowing someone's standing on the protective com-\nposite could allow the identification of the persons most at\nrisk for cognitive decline. For example, those at retirement\nage are a vulnerable group, given their potential for de-\ncreases in social exchanges, control beliefs, and frequency\nof physical exercise. Thus, this group could be targeted and\nencouraged to engage in diverse activities providing a high\nTable 4.

The\nmodel did not adjust for cognitive activities because this was measured at Time 2, only.\nsense of control, quality social support, and opportunities\nfor physical activity.\nWe acknowledge that the obtained patterns must be con-\nsidered in light of some inherent limitations. The generaliz-\nability of our findings is limited to some extent by the\npositive selection of the longitudinal participants in MIDUS\nand BOLOS and the relatively small sample size of BO-\nLOS. Also, even though the data are from a large national\nprobability-based sample, the median split approach used to\ncompute the protective composite is sample dependent and\ncannot provide universal guidelines. Although it is a reason-\nable method given the lack of clinically meaningful criteria\nfor dividing participants into high and low categories, future\nstudies should consider different approaches for computing\nprotective factors using different cutoffs, weighted scores,\nor continuous scales.\nAlthough the design from the larger MIDUS study was\ncross-sectional, it is encouraging that the findings were es-\nsentially replicated with the longitudinal sample in which\nwe found the protective factor related to change with one\nkey cognitive dimension: reasoning. Also, the validity of\nsome of our self-reported measures (e.g., waist circumfer-\nence, physical exercise) could be optimized using multiple\nindicators. Furthermore, the amount of variance accounted\nfor by the psychosocial and behavioral factors was in the\nsmall range. Along with the factors we considered in the\ncurrent study, other variables can play a role in cognitive\nfunctioning (Hertzog et al., 2008) and should be considered\nas protective factors or covariates in the statistical models.\nFor instance, level of stress (Neupert, Almeida, Mroczek, &\nBoron, 2008), and healthy nutrition (Del Parigi, Panza,\nCapurso, & Solfrizzi, 2006) also account for between-per-\nson heterogeneity in cognitive performance, directly or via\nphysical health.\nIn spite of these limitations and the fact that the current\ndesign does not provide a final answer concerning causal-\nity, the present study provides a plausible examination of\nthe role of the synergistic effects of high control beliefs,\nfrequent physical activity, and high-quality social sup-\nport, on cognitive functioning and long-term change.\nHowever, future work is needed to examine this set of\nprotective factors in relation to long-term changes in\nmultiple aspects of cognition, including the risk of\ndementia, and to explore the individual and shared mech-\nanisms (e.g., stress hormones, McEwen, 2008; inflamma-\ntion processes, Ferrucci et al., 1999; allostatic load,\nGruenewald et al., 2009) that may be involved in linking\nthe combined psychosocial and behavioral factors to\ncognitive functioning.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National Institute on Aging (RO1\nerine T.
