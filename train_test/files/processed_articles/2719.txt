Poisson regression was used to analyze overall and sub-\ngroup temporal trends and to estimate annual change per 100,000 persons (change). Total firearm injuries (n =\nNFIs increased (change = 0.35; Ptrend\nhomicide NFIs increased (change = 0.43; Ptrend\nwhile unintentional FFIs and NFIs declined (changes = -0.01 and -0.09, respectively; Ptrend\nAmong whites, FFIs (change = 0.15; Ptrend\nblacks, FFIs declined (change = -0.20; Ptrend\nPtrend\n= 0.014).

Despite aggressive resuscitation\nand treatment being available to these victims, many have\npoor quality of life and heavy morbidity throughout their\nremaining life. A substantial proportion of these wounded\nsubsequently die of health consequences directly related to\nfirearm-related trauma (4, 5). Despite this burden of NFI, our\nunderstanding of NFI is much more limited than is our under-\nstanding of FFI (6, 7). Most of the current evidence on NFI\nhas focused on an evaluation of injury severity and in-\nhospital outcomes that have used data from trauma centers\n(5) or nationally representative hospitalizations where firearm\ninjuries do not include minor injuries treated in the emer-\ngency department (ED) followed by discharge (3, 8, 9). Des-\npite its importance to understanding the total firearm injury\nburden, to our knowledge, no study has compared FFI and\nNFI. In this study, we aimed first to document and compare\nthe temporal trends of national FFI and NFI rates during\ntrends among subgroups according to race/ethnicity and in-\ntent, separately for FFI and NFI.\nMETHODS\nData sources\nWe used FFI and NFI data from national counts and esti-\nmates that were derived by querying the restricted, publicly\navailable injury data available through the Web-based Injury\nStatistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS). WIS-\nQARS is an interactive database launched by the National\nCenter for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) (6). Fatal injury data\nfor WISQARS are collected through the National Vital Sta-\ntistics System operated by the National Center for Health\nStatistics (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/), which uses Inter-\nnational Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes\nfor determining the underlying cause of death (10). The data\nsource for NFI reports was the National Electronic Injury\nSurveillance System\u00adAll Injury Program (NEISS-AIP), a\ncollaborative effort between the CDC's National Center\nfor Injury Prevention and Control and the Consumer Prod-\nuct Safety Commission. The NEISS-AIP collects data on\nnonfatal injuries of all types and external causes, using\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,\nhospital EDs. NEISS-AIP hospitals include large inner-city\nhospitals with trauma centers and large urban, suburban, ru-\nral, and children's hospitals. The 66 NEISS-AIP hospitals\nare a nationally representative, stratified probability sample\nof all US hospitals that have at least 6 beds and 24-hour\nemergency services (11). These 66 hospitals provide data on\nby inverse probability of selection to provide national esti-\nmates (6). Although the ED cases are monitored and reported\nfor deaths, posthospitalization deaths are not accurately re-\ncorded (12). Therefore, we used location-specific FFI data\nfrom the CDC's Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic\nResearch (WONDER) to identify posthospitalization firearm\ndeaths (2). The details are presented in Web Appendix 1, Web\nTables 1 and 2 (available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/). To\nprotect patient privacy and prevent inadvertent identification\nof cases, the National Center for Health Statistics and the\nNational Association of Public Health Statistics and Infor-\nmation Systems restrict country- and state-level reporting\nof deaths to cumulative frequencies of 10 or more (6).\nStudy population\nfacility, or nursing home/long-term care facility, and there\nmay be an overlap between FFIs and NFIs. The annual popu-\nlation and aggregate counts of FFIs and NFIs were obtained\nseparately for overall and according to age, sex, race/\nethnicity, and intent of injury. Each case in the fatal injury\nreport corresponds to 1 death and each case in the nonfatal\ninjury report corresponds to 1 ED case, which may have been\neither treated and released (NFI-ED) or further hospitalized/\ntransferred/left against medical advice (NFI-hospitalizations).\nVariables and definitions\nAll firearm injuries were broadly categorized as FFI or\nyears. Racial/ethnic information for FFI was available separ-\nately as race (white, black, or other) and ethnicity (Hispanic\nor non-Hispanic). These designations were recoded for\nconsistency into the same 4 categories as for NFI: 1) non-\nHispanic white, 2) black (both Hispanic and non-Hispanic\nblack), 3) Hispanic (except Hispanic-black), and 4) other.\nFor FFI, intent of injury was available in 4 categories: homi-\ncide (assault, including legal intervention), suicide (self-\ninflicted, intentional), unintentional, and undetermined. For\nNFIs, unintentional and undetermined were available only\nas a single category. For comparability between NFI and\nFFI intent, we collapsed the separate categories of uninten-\ntional and undetermined available for FFI injuries to create\nidentical categorizations for intent in NFI and FFI.\nStatistical analysis\nFirst we used annual injury counts as numerator and popu-\nlation as denominator to calculate crude rates per 100,000 per-\nsons overall and for each subgroup of age, sex, race/ethnicity,\nand intent of FFI and NFI. We used crude rates to be con-\nsistent with the Poisson regression analysis performed using\nactual counts. We present analyses using crude counts to ac-\ncurately represent the counts available for analyses in the\npublicly available data. Second, we assumed linear trends\nacross 13 years in order to assess the temporal trends in fire-\narm injuries, and we used Poisson regression (a log-linear\nmodel) to model annual firearm-event counts and predict the\nfirearm injury rates by injury type. We used Poisson regres-\nsion because there were no zero counts and the mean of the\ndistribution of counts was equivalent to the variance. Add-\nitionally, we compared the fit with negative binomial regres-\nsion models and zero-inflated negative binomial models by\nfirst plotting the predicted residuals from both models by the\ncount of FFI and NFI events, and second with goodness-of-\nfit comparisons using the Akaike information criterion,\nBayesian information criterion, and Vuong test (13). Third,\nusing a Poisson regression model, we predicted the annual\nconfidence intervals, and discrete annual change in injury\nsignificance of the temporal trend was assessed from the\nmodel using Ptrend\n. Fourth, we performed 2-way interaction\ntests to determine whether the temporal trends within each\ncategory of the subgroup varied across the categories of the\ninjury type of FFI and NFI. Three-way interaction tests were\nalso performed between temporal trends of each subgroup\ncategory across injury type and across all the categories of\nthe subgroups. We used Pinteraction\nto assess the significance\nof interactions and Pearson's goodness-of-fit to confirm\nmodel fit. Fifth, we also performed a sensitivity analysis by\nThe Hidden Epidemic of Firearm Injury in the US 547\nexcluding from NFI-hospitalization those FFI deaths that\noccurred in the hospital, hospice, or nursing homes.\nAll P values were 2-sided and significance level was\nStation, Texas; 2009), was used for data analyses.\nRESULTS\nFFIs.

We present 4 novel findings. First, we\nshowed that an increase in overall firearm injury rate across\n13 years was driven by an increase in NFI with no change\nin FFI. Second, overall firearm injury trends were charac-\nterized by opposing intent-specific trends of increasing\nhomicide and suicide injuries and declining unintentional/\nundetermined firearm injuries. The increase in homicide\nfirearm injuries was characterized by a moderate decline in\nsuicide injuries and decline in unintentional/undetermined\ninjuries was driven by FFI in their respective directions.\nThird, although blacks had overall firearm injury rates\n4-fold greater than whites, there was a decline in FFI\namong blacks, while FFI and NFI increased among whites.\nFourth, while the decline in homicide FFI occurred across\nall racial/ethnic groups, the increasing trend in suicide FFI\nwas characterized by a substantial increase among whites\nand an opposing but moderate decline among blacks and\nHispanics.\nOur demonstration of an increase in overall firearm injuries\nadds to the finding of a steadily increasing trend of all vio-\nlence involving firearms reported by the Department of Jus-\ntice, where the rates of firearm injury among all injuries\n2011 (14). This recent increase shown in our study suggests a\nreverse in the decline in firearm injury rates that occurred dur-\nwas similar and a continuation of the lack of an upward or\ndownward trend that we reported in our work using firearm\nedge, there have been no studies that assessed the temporal\ntrends of NFI that included both ED and hospitalizations. To\ndate, the evidence regarding NFI was an incomplete represen-\ntation of either ED or hospitalizations, amounting to 30% and\n40% of the overall firearm injuries (1, 3). We demonstrate in\nthis study that a large increasing temporal trend in NFI drove\nthe increasing overall firearm injury rates, which in turn was\nlargely due to mounting homicide NFI rates, despite a minor\nreduction in homicide FFI.\nThe rising rates of homicide and suicide and declining\nrate of unintentional/undetermined firearm injury in our\nstudy were consistent with similar findings from several\ning but large increase in homicide NFI that we report was\nsimilar to the increasing trend described in the National\nHospital Discharge Survey (3). When the intent was suicide,\nself-inflicted firearm-related injuries usually resulted in\nstudy mirror the overall suicide rates in the United States,\nwhich are currently at an all-time high and have increased\nintentional/undetermined FFI and NFI among all races/eth-\nnicities in our study is consistent with the steady decrease\nreported over the past 2 decades (20, 21). While the findings\nin our study are concordant with piecemeal evidence from\ndifferent studies, our results provide direct comparisons be-\ntween the temporal trends of homicide, suicide, and uninten-\ntional/undetermined overall firearm injuries, establishing\nthat the increase in homicide firearm injury is primarily due\nto homicide NFI increase, whereas the increasing suicide\nand decrease in unintentional/undetermined firearm injuries\nare driven by the respective intent of nonfatal injuries.\nAmong all racial/ethnic groups, we found the highest rates\namong blacks, and it was 4-fold higher than that among white\npopulation and was similar to previous studies (3, 15). How-\nand whites began narrowing from a ratio of 5.5 to 4.25 for to-\ntal firearm injuries and from 2.0 in 1.6 for FFI. This trend is\nconsistent with 2 CDC reports: Gotsch et al. (1), before 2000,\naddressed both FFIs and NFIs, and Athar et al. (22) included\nthat the reason behind this narrowing gap was a confluence of\nconsistently increasing firearm injury rates among whites dri-\nven by FFI and NFI and an overall decline in firearm injury\nrates among blacks, predominantly FFI.

The increasing\nNFI, indicative of greater severity of injury among whites in\nour study, is in opposition to the lower rates among whites in\namong whites after 2000. The increase in NFI among whites\nwas comparable to that seen in data from a more recent\ncohort study from a health maintenance organization in\nnorthern California that showed whites were more likely to\nbe hospitalized for suicide firearm injuries than were other\nWe found an overall decline in firearm homicide that oc-\ncurred among all racial/ethnic groups. While our results\nwere consistent with earlier studies using the same data over\na shorter period (15) and similar to those of another study of\nhomicide trends exclusive to young adults, our results span\na longer and more recent time period and are applicable to\nall age groups (18). Our results demonstrating the decline in\nhomicide FFI being driven mainly by blacks and Hispanics\nbuild on a similar study that showed a decline among these\nracial/ethnic groups using data from a shorter time period,\nindicating the sustained decline among these racial/ethnic\nFFI rates in our study that was predominantly among whites,\nwhile blacks and Hispanics showed a moderate decline, was\ncomparable to findings in a report by the Pennsylvania De-\npartment of Health using death certificates and hospital dis-\ncharges, in which whites showed higher rates of firearm\nsuicide than did other racial/ethnic groups (25). The decline\namong Hispanics was also similar to that in an analysis\nusing a shorter time period where the decline was moderate\n(15). The decline in unintentional/undetermined FFI and\nNFI in all racial/ethnic groups observed in this study was\nalso previously reported in 2 trend-analysis studies of fatal\nand hospitalized firearm injuries, without the inclusion of\nOur study has to be interpreted in the light of certain limita-\ntions. The absence of individual patient data and the weighted\nestimates of nonfatal injuries are the most obvious limitations.\nWhile the lack of individual data renders it impossible to val-\nidate categorization of firearm injury, the rigorous nature of\nthe data-collection procedures using multiple data sources\nmay reduce the possible misclassification bias. On the other\nhand, the weighted estimates of counts of nonfatal injury\ndata, especially the lack of follow-up after hospitalization,\nmay have overestimated the counts of NFI-hospitalizations,\nwhich we have attempted to correct by excluding the deaths\nknown to have occurred during hospitalization, hospice, or\nnursing home care. The results from the sensitivity analysis\nwere robust. However, in the event of such overestimation,\nour results for temporal trends in NFI may be slightly exag-\ngerated. We were also unable to assess the obvious state-\nspecific differences in injury type trends due to the lack of\nstate-specific aggregate data on nonfatal injuries. Not being\nable to account for state-specific associations may bias the re-\nsults in either direction, which is not estimable. In previous\nstudies, the profile of undetermined injuries did not compare\nto that of any other intent of injury (3, 7). However, the non-\nfatal injury data in WISQARS are reported in a cumulative\nundetermined/unintentional category that forced us to com-\nbine the 2 categories among fatal injuries to be comparable.\nThis might weaken or amplify the results depending on the\nactual difference between the 2 categories, which unfortu-\nnately cannot be quantified.\nThe epidemic of firearm violence, driven largely by non-\nfatal injuries, is an important public health problem that is\ncharacterized by an increased health-care burden, reduced\nquality of life, and increasing costs. Considering that the\nmajority of FFI are due to suicides, the continuous and\nsizeable increase in suicide FFI observed in our study indi-\ncates a systemic national problem, which has several\nunderlying social and individual factors that have been ne-\nglected for a long time and continue to be unaddressed. In\nconclusion, the public health consequences and the enor-\nmous costs associated with firearm injuries are of increas-\ning concern, considering the epidemic of NFI. Our data\nshow that this public health emergency is driven primarily\nby nonfatal injuries.\n"
