Racial differences\nin support to each generation in the family remain\nunclear, however. Different factors may account for\nracial differences in support of grown children versus\naging parents. Design and Methods: Middle-\nprovided each aging parent and grown child. Partici-\npants reported background characteristics represent-\ning their resources and measures of needs for each\nfamily member. Interviews also assessed beliefs about\nobligation to support parents and grown children and\nrewards from helping. Results: Multilevel models\nrevealed White middle-aged adults provided more\nsupport to grown children than Black middle-aged\nadults. Demands from offspring, beliefs about sup-\nport, and rewards from helping explained these\nracial differences. Black middle-aged adults provided\nmore support to parents than White middle-aged\nadults. Beliefs about support and feelings of\npersonal reward from providing support explained\nthis difference but resources and demands did\nnot. Implications: Racial differences varied by\ngeneration (parent or offspring). The prolonged tran-\nsitions common for White young adults explained\nracial differences in support of offspring. Middle-\naged adults may treat support of parents as more dis-\ncretionary, with cultural ideas about obligation and\npersonal rewards guiding behaviors.\nKey Words: Intergenerational transfers, Family,\nParents, Grown children, Social support, Family\ndiversity, African American, Black family\nIn Western countries, middle-aged adults typi-\ncally are often in a pivot position of providing sup-\nport to generations above and below (Attias-Donfut\nHenretta, 2006).

McAuley, PhD\nThe Gerontologist\n(Fingerman & Birditt, in press). This model builds\non contingency theory, which predicts that indi-\nviduals will respond to family members' urgent\nWe have extended the theory to consider a vari-\nety of perceived needs: (1) emerging crises, (2)\nongoing problems, (3) everyday needs, and (4)\nsupport for future success. Our prior research\nsuggests that middle-aged adults respond to this\nfull range of needs but provide different types of\nsupport (i.e., financial vs. advice) in reaction to\ndifferent needs (Fingerman, Miller, Birditt, &\nZarit, 2009). Each generation may experience\ndifferent types of needs, and these distinctions, in\nturn, may translate into different patterns of\nracial differences in support to grown children as\nopposed to aging parents.\nOur model also included a distinct facet of con-\ntingency theory, namely constraints on resources.\nThe amount of support an individual provides\nfamily members is limited by resources (e.g.,\nincome, time) and combined demands for those\nresources (family members' needs; Grundy &\nHenretta, 2006). By considering multiple family\nmembers, we examine how individuals of different\nraces make decisions about trade-offs in helping\neach family member.\nFinally, intrapsychic factors such as cultural\nideas about obligations and feelings about family\nalso motivate provision of support (Silverstein,\nGans, & Yang, 2006). Elsewhere, researchers have\ndebated whether structural factors versus cultural\nfactors explain racial differences in family support\n(Sarkisian & Gerstel, 2004). But cultural factors\n(e.g., beliefs about obligation, appraisals of rewards\nor stress) may lead to different reactions to struc-\ntural limits (i.e., whether people choose to expand\nresources or reduce support; Fingerman & Birditt,\nin press). Here, we apply this model to examine\nracial differences in support to each generation.\nSupport to Grown Children\nIn American families, the flow of intergenera-\ntional support is typically downstream; parents\nprovide more support to their grown children than\nthe reverse (Giarrusso, Feng, & Bengtson, 2005;\nShapiro, 2004). Yet, the majority of studies of sup-\nport to grown children have relied on White sam-\nples. As such, we do not have a full portrait of\nthe range of support that Black families provide\ngrown children or how that compares with White\nfamilies.\nThe limited research on racial differences in\nsupport of grown children has focused mainly on\neconomic exchanges and has found that parents in\nBlack families provide less help to children than in\nResources may partially explain these findings:\nBlack adults typically have less wealth and poorer\nhealth than White adults (Swartz, 2009), which\naccounts for lower parental financial transfers\nThe nature of demands from grown children\nmay also differ for Black and White middle-aged\nparents. Black young adults are more likely to suf-\nfer crises (e.g., crime, unemployment; Furstenberg,\n2010), but these crises may be transient and\nnot affect all offspring in the family (Birditt,\nFingerman, & Zarit, 2010). By contrast, well-off\nyoung adults experience prolonged transitions to\nadulthood, marked by statuses (e.g., student) that\nnecessitate persistent support (Arnett, 2000). In\ncomparison to Black young adults, if White young\nadults undergo prolonged transitions and occupy\nsuch statuses, they may receive greater financial\nand practical support.\nCultural beliefs also may contribute to racial\ndisparities in support of grown children. The\nnature and implications of these beliefs for\nsupport of grown children are not clear, however.\nResearchers have documented that Black Americans\nendorse strong filial obligation to support aging\nparents (Becker, Beyene, Newsom, & Mayen,\net al., 2005), but researchers have not assessed\nbeliefs about obligation to support grown chil-\ndren. White adults may experience a stronger sense\nof obligation to assist grown offspring due to their\nprolonged transitions to adulthood (Furstenberg,\nFurthermore, rewards from providing support\nmay favor material and practical support of grown\nchildren in White families. Research suggests peo-\nple sometimes help because it makes them feel good\n(Dovidio, Piliavin, Schroeder, & Penner, 2006).\nParents, in particular, may derive a sense of reward\nfrom supporting grown children to reach personal\ngoals (Fingerman et al., 2009; Ryff, Lee, Essex, &\nSchmutte, 1994). If White young adults have\ngreater opportunity to seek fulfillment of personal\ngoals, White parents may experience a greater\nsense of reward in supporting them to do so.\nIntrapsychic factors also may play a role in the\ntypes of support individuals of different races\noffer family members (Becker et al., 2003). Studies\nexamining practical and financial support by race\nhave tended to aggregate kin support across family\nmembers, and findings are inconsistent (Sarkisian &\nRubin, 2008). In this study, we speculated that due\nto their greater resources, White parents may offer\nmore money and time to their grown children\n(Sarkisian & Gerstel, 2004), whereas Black par-\nents may offer nontangible support reflecting both\ntheir resources and cultural beliefs. Due to wide-\nspread racism, Black parents may seek to provide\ntheir children with advice to overcome discrimina-\ntion. Researchers have noted strong norms of fam-\nily solidarity in Black families (Hill, 1999; Suitor\net al., 2007), which may foster exchanges of emo-\ntional support. Thus, Black parents may provide\nless overall support to grown children than White\nparents but may provide certain types of support\n(advice and emotional support) more often.\nSupport to Elderly Parents\nAlthough contradictory evidence exists, Black\nAmericans seem to provide more support to aging\nparents than White Americans do (Dilworth-\nport to grown children, resources and demands\nmight help explain this disparity. Black middle-\naged adults may have fewer resources than White\nmiddle-aged adults, yet their parents may have\ngreater needs than White parents. These needs may\nbe different than those of offspring, as Black par-\nents are more likely to suffer disability due to fac-\ntors such as lower socioeconomic status (SES) and\ndiscrimination in health care (Kelley-Moore &\nCultural beliefs also play a role in support of\nparents. Compared with White Americans, Black\nAmericans endorse more positive beliefs regarding\nassistance to aging parents (Burr & Mutchler,\n1999). Black women experience less burden when\ncaring for disabled parents compared with White\nwomen (Dilworth-Anderson et al., 2005). Black\nadults also derive self-fulfillment and find it more\nrewarding to help their parents than White adults\nAlthough Black Americans typically have stron-\nger norms regarding family than White Americans\n(Burr & Mutchler, 1999), these norms may differ\nby generation. Benjamin (2000) documented\ncohort differences in Black American's beliefs\nabout family and neighborhood cohesion, show-\ning older generations may feel stronger norms of\nreciprocity toward one another than the youngest\ngeneration alive today. Thus, we expected Black\nmiddle-aged adults to report greater support of\naging parents in response to such feelings of inter-\ngenerational cohesion, sense of obligation, and\nreward from helping parents.\nOther Factors Associated With Support\nWe included covariates that might explain racial\ndifferences in support. For example, Laditka and\nLaditka (2001) documented the role of gender (as\nwell as race) in support; Black women gave more\nsupport to aging parents than White women or\nmen of either race. Family structures may play a\nrole in support, with parents providing less to each\nchild in larger families (Davey, Janke, & Savla,\n2005). Black parents tend to have a greater num-\nber of children than White parents (Dye, 2008).\nLikewise, marital status may play a role in paren-\ntal support. Black women are likely to be single,\nand the matrilineal family structure may evoke fil-\nial support (Taylor, 2000). Conversely, step family\nties involve fewer support exchanges (Coleman,\nGanong, & Rothrauff, 2006) and Black adults are\nless likely to have step family ties.\nMethods\nSample\nthe study included having at least one child aged\nolder than 18 years and at least one living parent.\nNational data suggest 49.6% of White adults and\nliving parent and a grown child (Sweet & Bumpass,\nParticipants resided in the Philadelphia Primary\nMetropolitan Statistical Area (including urban,\nsuburban, and rural areas; Pennsylvania State\nData Center, 2001). Recruitment occurred via\ntelephone lists purchased from Genesys Corpora-\ntion and random digit dialing in regional area\ncodes. Genesys Corporation derived lists from the\nwhite pages, automobile registration, driver's\nlicenses, voter registrations, birth records, con-\nsumer surveys, coupon redemption information,\ndirect mail, books and merchandize, and other\nproprietary data sources. Participants who had\na listed address received a prenotification letter\ninforming them of the study, followed by a\nThe Gerontologist\nphone call. Participants who did not have a listed\naddress were recruited directly by telephone.\nScreening interviews identified eligible partici-\npants. Of 845 potential eligible participants who\nviewed. Of these participants, 20 individuals\nidentified as Asian American, Native American,\nor multiracial (not including African American)\nand were not included in the current study. One\nparticipant celebrated his 61st birthday between\nthe screening and the interview, and his data were\nexcluded.\nBy oversampling in high-density ethnic minority\nneighborhoods, we recruited a high proportion of\nAfrican American participants. Data were col-\nlected from January through August 2008. In com-\nparisontothegeneralpopulationinthePhiladelphia\narea, participants of both races were better edu-\ncated and somewhat more likely to be married or\nemployed. Black and White subsamples had com-\nparable income and rates of disability to the gen-\neral population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008; see\nWe examined racial differences in background\nvariables.

Partici-\npants reported their age, gender, and marital status\n(0 = not married, 1 = married). We assessed\nresources as health and SES. Subjective health was\nrated on a 5-point scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (excel-\nlent). We included two indicators of SES: educa-\ntion (i.e., years of education) and household income\nParent and offspring characteristics. Partici-\npants reported age, gender, and background in-\nformation for each grown child (664 daughters\nand 325 fathers; see Table 1). They also indicat-\ned marital status, whether the parent or grown\nchild resided with them and how they were re-\nlated (i.e., biological/adopted or step family\ntie).\nSupport Exchanges.--We used the multidi-\nmensional Intergenerational Support Scale (ISS;\nFingerman et al, 2009) to assess tangible and\nnontangible support to each parent and each\ngrown child. The scale assesses frequency of\nemotional, practical, companionship, advice,\nfinancial support, and lending an attentive ear to\nthe other, using a scale from 1 (less than once a\nyear or not at all) to 8 (daily). Consistent with\nprior studies, we computed the mean of the six\nitems for each child and each parent. Coefficient\nalphas were high (a = .87 White parents to\na = .90 Black offspring). Table 2 presents descriptive\ninformation for each type of support to parents\nand offspring.\nExplanatory Variables: Needs.--We included\nmeasures that serve as proxy variables for parental\nand offspring needs, which by extension represent\ndemands for support within the family.\nProblems. As one measure of need, participants\ncompleted the Life Problems Scale (Fingerman\net al., 2009). Participants reported whether each\nchild or parent had experienced the following\nproblems in the past two years: severe health prob-\nlem or injury, emotional or psychological problem,\nvictim of a crime, alcohol or drug problem, finan-\ncial issues or unemployment, problems with the\nlaw, divorce or serious relationship problem, and\nwidowed. We created a sum score of problems for\neach family member.\nStudent status. Student status is associated\nwith increased parental support (Lee & Aytac,\n1998). We measured this variable dichotomously\n(1 = student, 0 = not student).\nDisability. Participants completed five items\nfrom the Community Disability Scale for each par-\nent (Bassett & Folstein, 1991). Participants indi-\ncated 35% of Black and 30% of White parents\nhad at least one functional disability. Disability\namong children was minimal and thus not included\nin analyses.\nTable 2. Frequency of Support Participants Provide to Grown Children and Parents\nType of support\nOffspring Parents\nNote: Scale for support rating is 1 = less than once a year or not at all, 2 = once a year, 3 = a few times a year, 4 = monthly,\n5 = a few times a month, 6 = weekly, 7 = a few times a week, and 8 = daily.\nThe Gerontologist\nExplanatory Variables: Beliefs and Rewards.--\nWe included measures that assess intrapsychic fac-\ntors, such as participants' beliefs about support\nand appraisals of rewards from providing support.\nCultural beliefs about obligation to family. Par-\nticipants completed a measure of filial obligation\nto support parents, adapted from prior research\n(Silverstein et al., 2006). Participants indicated\nhow often adults should provide each of the six\ntypes of support in the ISS to their parents (e.g.,\nfinancial, emotional, practical) from 1 (never) to 5\n(always), a = .79 for Black participants and a = .80\nfor White participants.\nParticipants also completed a parallel measure\nregarding obligation to support grown children\ndeveloped for this study, a =.72 for Black partici-\npants and a =.74 for White participants.\nRewards from providing support. Participants\nindicated how rewarding they find it to help each\nchild and each parent, rated 1 (not at all) to 5\n(a great deal).\nAnalytic Strategy.--We tested models of racial\ndifferences in support to each generation. We\nhypothesized that the pattern of racial differences\nwould vary for each generation, and different\nneeds would evoke support for aging parents and\ngrown children. Thus, we estimated models sepa-\nrately for support of parents and offspring. The\ndependent variable was frequency of support to\neach parent or grown child.\nBecause participants reported on multiple chil-\ndren and one or two parents, we used the PROC\nMixed procedure in SAS (Littell, Milliken, Stroup, &\nWolfinger, 1996) to estimate multilevel models,\naccounting for the nested data (i.e., parents and\nchildren nested within participants). The indepen-\ndent variable was race (1 = Black, 0 = White). First,\nwe estimated models including race as a predictor\nwith covariates. We then included variables assess-\ning resources and demands, followed by a model\nincluding cultural beliefs and personal rewards\nfrom helping to ascertain whether these variables\naccounted for racial differences. To compare mod-\nels, we estimated a model fit statistic by calculating\nthe difference between the -2 log likelihood coef-\nficients from each model. We examined this differ-\nence on a chi-square distribution, with the change\nin the number of parameters as the degrees of free-\ndom (Singer & Willett, 2003). Post hoc tests\naddressed support of both generations. We also\nconsidered different groupings of variables to\nassure stability of findings.\nResults\nRacial Differences in Support to Offspring\nFirst, we tested racial differences in support of\noffspring and explanations for such differences. In\nthese multilevel models, support provided to the\naverage grown child was the outcome and race\nwas the predictor variable. We included partici-\npant and offspring gender and marital status, step\nrelationship versus biological relationship, and\noffspring coresidence with participant as control\nvariables. As can be seen in Table 3, with race as\nthe sole predictor, Black participants reported that\nthey gave less to the average grown child than\nWhite participants did.\nThe next model examined resources and\ndemands on support. Resources included middle-\naged participants' income, education, and health.\nDemands included offspring's student status, age\n(younger age as a proxy for needs), and offspring\nproblems or crises. When these variables were\nincluded, the effect of race was reduced and became\nnonsignificant (see Table 3). Offspring who were\nstudents, who suffered a greater number of prob-\nlems, or who were younger received more support.\nAs can be seen in Table 3, the model including\ndemands and resources was a better fit than that\nwith only race as a predictor.\nNext, we examined cultural beliefs about obli-\ngation and rewards from helping, also including\nresources and demands and covariates in the\nmodel. Participants' obligation to help and rewards\nfrom helping were associated with more support.\nAgain, we compared -2 log likelihood coefficients,\nand this model was a better fit.\nNote that across models, some covariates were\nsignificantly associated with support. Mothers\nreported giving more to grown children than did\nfathers. Daughters and children who coresided\nwith parents received more support; married chil-\ndren and stepchildren received less support.\nWe also asked whether racial differences in sup-\nport were limited to specific types of support using\nseparate multilevel models with each of type of\nsupport (e.g., emotional, advice) as the outcomes\nand p < .01 significance level to account for multi-\nple comparisons. These models each showed a\nconsistent significant racial difference with White\nparents giving more support in the initial model,\nexcept for advice. The analysis for advice showed\nno significant racial difference in the absence of\ncontrol variables, resources and demands, or\nbeliefs and personal rewards. Racial differences\nfor all other types of support became nonsignifi-\ncant when we entered resources and demands in\nthe models.\nRacial Differences in Support to Aging Parents\nThe analytic strategy regarding racial differ-\nences in support to aging parents was similar to\nthat for support to grown children. For control\nvariables, we included participant's and parents'\ngender, participant's and parents' marital status,\nstep relationship to parent, and whether the parent\ncoresides with the participant. Because number of\nliving parents (one or two) correlated highly with\nparental marital status (r = .66), we did not include\nnumber of living parents as a covariate.\nAs can be seen in Table 4, with race as the sole\npredictor, Black participants reported that they\ngave more to the average parent than White par-\nticipants did. We then estimated a model including\nresources and demands. For parents, we defined\ndemands as parental disability, problems in the\npast year, and age (with older age as a proxy for\nneeds). As can be seen in Table 4, the effect for\nrace remained significant, although a greater num-\nber of parental problems and older parental age\nalso were significantly associated with more sup-\nport. The model with demands and resources was\na better fit than that with race as the sole predictor.\nFinally, we included filial obligation to help par-\nents and rewards from helping the parent. As can\nbe seen in Table 4, the effect for race was no longer\nsignificant with these variables. Participants'\ngreater obligation to assist parents and finding it\nrewarding to help the parent were associated with\nmore support.\nAgain, covariates were associated with support.\nMiddle-aged women of both races provided more\nsupport to parents. Mothers as well as parents\nwho coresided with the participant received more\nsupport. Married parents received less support\nthan parents who were not married (i.e., widowed,\ndivorced, or single parents).\nTable 3. Multilevel Models Comparing Black and White Middle-Aged Adults' Support of Grown Offspring\nPredictor variables\nRacial\ndifferences\nModel with\ncontrol\nvariables\nModel with\nresources\nand demands\nModel with\ncultural beliefs\nand rewards\nResources and demands\nCultural beliefs\nControl variables\nModel fit\na1 = Black, 0 = White.\nb1 = male, 0 = female.\nc1 = married, 0 = not married.\nThe Gerontologist\nNext, we asked whether racial differences are\nlimited to specific types of support. We conducted\nseparate multilevel models for each of the type of\nsupport (e.g., emotional, advice), adjusting signifi-\ncance level to p < .01 to account for multiple com-\nparisons. There was no significant racial difference\nin frequency with which middle-aged adults listen\nto their parents talk about daily events, but all\nother types of support showed a significant differ-\nence, with Black adults giving more frequent sup-\nport to their parents.\nPost Hoc Tests\nWe conducted analyses to assess stability in\nfindings and to answer remaining questions. First,\nwe considered whether greater support of one gen-\neration undermines support available for the other\ngeneration. Specifically, we asked whether (1)\nracial disparities in support to offspring stemmed\nfrom greater support Black participants provide\ntheir parents and (2) racial disparities in support of\nparents stemmed from greater support White par-\nticipants provide offspring.\nWe estimated a multilevel model with support\nto the average offspring as the outcome, including\ntotal support to parents (i.e., sum of support to\neach parent) as a family level variable and control\nvariables. The model was identical to that pre-\nsented in Table 3 (model with control variables),\nwith total support to parents also included as a\nvariable. Racial differences remained, with White\nparticipants still reporting more support to\nWe also estimated a multilevel model with sup-\nport to the average parent as the outcome and\nincluding total support to offspring (i.e., sum of\nsupport to all offspring) and control variables.\nThis model was the same as that presented in Table\n4, with the addition of total support to offspring in\nthe model. Again, racial differences in support of\nparents remained, with Black parents reporting\ngreater support to the average parent, B = 0.55,\nFinally, some control variables could be consid-\nered demands rather than covariates (i.e., number\nof children in family, coresiding with participant).\nWe examined those variables in equations with\nresources and demands, excluding other control\nvariables, and the pattern of findings was the same.\nTable 4. Black and White Middle-Aged Adults' Support of Parents\nPredictor variables B SE B SE B SE B SE\nResources and demands\nCultural beliefs\nControl variables\nModel fit\na1 = Black, 0 = White.\nb1 = male, 0 = female.\nc1 = married, 0 = not married.\nDiscussion\nThis study extends research regarding intergen-\nerational family support in several respects: (1) by\ncomparing racial differences in middle-aged adults'\nsupport to parents and to grown children in the\nsame family, (2) by examining racial differences in\nsupport to multiple parents and offspring, and (3)\nby comparing explanatory factors (i.e., resources\nand demands and cultural beliefs) in observed\nracial differences for each generation. The findings\nsuggest racial patterns in support differ by genera-\ntion (i.e., whether the support is given to parents\nor children), which has implications for how inter-\nventions for providing support to families assisting\nelders are designed.\nThe results supported our model that family\nsupport is accounted for by resources and demands\n(family members' needs) and intrapsychic factors\n(cultural beliefs about support and rewards of pro-\nviding everyday support; Fingerman & Birditt, in\npress). These findings are consistent with literature\nshowing racial disparities are generated by multi-\nple factors and pathways (e.g., Schulz et al., 2000).\nThese principles operated in this study to explain\nracial differences in support, but the factors that\nevoke support differed for each generation. Indeed,\nfindings supporting different sides of the debate\nregarding explanations for racial differences in\nfamily support (e.g., Sarkisian & Gerstel, 2004)\nmay partially stem from a focus in the literature on\nonly two generations in any study. When we con-\nsidered support to parents and offspring in the\nsame family, however, explanations for racial dif-\nferences varied depending on the generation receiv-\ning support.\nRacial differences involving middle-aged adults'\ngreater support to grown offspring were explained\nby differences in everyday demands that offspring\nface. The prolonged transition to adulthood (rep-\nresented by student status, younger age, and lack\nof marital partner) was associated with greater\nsupport to offspring. These findings suggest soci-\netal structures that offer greater opportunity to\nWhite young adults may explain the observed\nracial differences in support. Under similar oppor-\ntunity structures, that is, when we controlled for\nstatuses such as being a student, Black, and White\nparents offered comparable support to offspring.\nBy contrast, health crises were more evident for\nparents but did not explain the racial difference of\ngreater support that Black middle-aged adults pro-\nvided their parents. Black middle-aged adults'\ngreater support of parents remained evident even\nwhen we accounted for resources and demands.\nOnly when we included obligation and rewards of\nhelping did the racial differences disappear. These\nfindings are consistent with a well-documented\nBlack American history of support of elderly par-\nents (Burr & Mutchler, 1999; Dilworth-Anderson\net al., 2005). Middle-aged Blacks, on average, gave\nmore support to parents and that difference was\nexplained by their stronger endorsement of cul-\ntural beliefs about support of parents, as well as\npersonal rewards in providing support.\nThe findings also provide insights into the pri-\nmacy of different aspects of our model of support.\nOur initial model presumed that resources and\ndemands place structural parameters on support.\nBut findings in this study suggest intrapsychic fac-\ntors (beliefs and rewards) may be of equal or\ngreater importance in support of older genera-\ntions. Our findings suggest middle-aged adults of\nboth races provide for their children if they have\nthe resources to do so and perceive their children\nto be in need. By contrast, support of parents may\nbe viewed as more discretionary by White middle-\naged adults and thus varied more as a function of\nbeliefs and feelings.\nIt is possible that unmeasured support to other\nfamily members played a role in exchange patterns\nas well. This study incorporated a greater number\nof family members than prior studies by assessing\nsupport to each living parent and to each grown\nchild, but we did not include support to siblings or\nto in-laws. White middle-aged adults were more\nlikely to be married than Black middle-aged adults.\nThus, support to in-laws may help explain the\nlower support White middle-aged adults provided\ntheir own parents.\nLikewise, it is notable that when we examined\neach type of support separately, we found no racial\ndifference with regard to parental advice to grown\nchildren. The nature of that advice might differ,\nhowever, and warrants follow-up. For example,\nwe did not assess support to deal with discrimina-\ntion or support to foster racial pride, but Black\nparents offer such support to their children grow-\ning up (Ceballo & McLoyd, 2002; Garcia Coll et\nal., 1996) and may continue to do so for their\nyoung adult offspring.\nImplications for Practice\nThese findings on intergenerational exchanges\nsuggest challenges and opportunities for intervention\nThe Gerontologist\nwhen families are confronted with extensive\ndemands in caring for an aging adult or in other\nfamily crises. For Black families, interventions\ncould build on the strong feelings of filial obliga-\ntion, though in doing so, it will be important to\nmonitor if individuals might be taking on more\nresponsibilities than they can manage. Finally,\nother studies suggest that Black families might\ndraw on other support partners in the church or\nbroader community (Uehara, 1994; Walls & Zarit,\nThe findings regarding Black families also have\npolicy implications. In Black families, middle-aged\nadults derive rewards from helping their parents\n(White et al., 2000), and policies that support the\nmiddle-aged adult's ability to support their own\nparents are likely to be most useful. In principle,\nU.S. public policy supports home care, but services\nand financial supports are inconsistently available\nand not well coordinated with medical care.\nExpansion of programs such as paid leave or finan-\ncial incentives to give family care may be of greater\nbenefit to Black families, facilitating their willing-\nness to serve as full-time or part-time caregivers.\nYet, efforts must be made to assure that Black\ncaregivers to do not suffer burn out or over burden\nfrom these tasks. A meta-analysis of studies of\ncaregivers revealed that Black caregivers suffered\nless depression than caregivers of other races or\nethnicity, but poorer health (Pinquart & Sorensen,\n2005). Thus, policy and practice should support\nrewarding aspects of caregiving in Black families\nwhile attending to the physical costs such care may\nentail.\nFor White families, resources that could be used\nfor care of parents may be limited if the middle-\naged parent is also providing assistance to grown\nchildren (Fingerman et al., 2010; Grundy &\nHenretta, 2006). Of course, grown children could\npotentially be a resource in caregiving, but findings\nin the current study suggest demands of a pro-\nlonged transition to adulthood may direct limited\nresources away from grandparents. It is also\nimportant for gerontologists to recognize that\nneeds of the younger generation are not secondary\nto those of the aged parents, but rather take a dif-\nferent form (i.e., everyday needs vs. emerging\nphysical crises). Clinicians who work with such\nfamilies may need to help these middle-aged adults\nbalance their limited resources rather than feeling\npressured to expand those resources to cover all\nfamily members' needs (Grundy & Henretta,\nLimitations and Future Directions\nThe study also has several limitations. Partici-\npants were all from one region, the Philadelphia\nMetropolitan Area. The National Survey of Black\nAmericans revealed regional and urban/rural dif-\nferences, with Black families in the South showing\ndifferent patterns than urban Black families in the\nNorth (Taylor, 2000). As such, findings may be\nlimited in generalizability to northern urban areas.\nIn addition, the study relied on cross-sectional\ndata. It is not clear whether racial disparities in\nprovision of support to parents may alter as par-\nents' health continues to decline. Indeed, racial dis-\nparities may be even greater when parents require\nintensive hands on care due to White middle-aged\nadults' greater willingness to place a parent in a\nnursing home (Dilworth-Anderson et al., 2005).\nThe study also failed to include forms of sup-\nport that may be evident in Black families but not\nin White families. For example, we did not mea-\nsure spiritual support or ways in which middle-\naged adults may help support parent's or offspring's\nreligious involvement. Religion plays a large role\nin Black family life (Dilworth-Anderson, Boswell,\nMoreover, we also note that the influence of\nsocial structural factors (e.g., material resources) is\nnot truly distinct from cultural beliefs (e.g., sense\nof obligation; see Sarkisian & Gerstel, 2004). For\nexample, Black adults endorse intergenerational\ncoresidence more than White adults do (Berry,\nalso face housing discrimination and difficulties\nobtaining mortgages that may contribute to these\nbeliefs.\nFurthermore, families in any given racial group\nare heterogeneous (Taylor, 2000). Consideration\nof racial differences here provided insight into how\nstructures (resources and demands) and intrapsy-\nchic factors (cultural beliefs and feelings of reward)\nmay contribute to exchanges, but these structures\nand intrapsychic factors also vary within races.\nIn sum, Black and White middle-aged adults pro-\nvided support to generations above and below. Fam-\nily support appears to vary by race, but this study\nsuggests racial differences differ depending on the\ngeneration receiving support (grown child or par-\nent). White middle-aged adults provided greater sup-\nport to their grown offspring, but Black middle-aged\nadults provided greater support to parents. Demands\nfrom offspring explained racial disparities in support\nof grown offspring. By contrast, racial differences in\nsupport to parents were not explained by resources\nand demands but rather by beliefs and rewards from\nhelping. As such, gerontologists should consider\ngeneration, resources and demands, and intrapsy-\nchic factors such as beliefs and feelings about sup-\nport to understand racial differences in support.\nFunding\nof Intergenerational Transfers\" from the National Institute of Aging and a\ngrant from the MacArthur Network on Transitions to Adulthood (Frank\nFurstenberg, Director).\n"
