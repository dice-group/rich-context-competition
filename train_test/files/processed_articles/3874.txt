Its importance to establish competitive advantages\non organizational performance (e.g., Gordon & DiTomaso,\nhas engaged scholars for many years. For example, Cameron\nand Quinn (2005) emphasize that the success of organiza-\ntions is not only determined by specific external conditions,\nfor example, barriers to market entry, rivalry in the industry,\nand supplier and buyer power (see also Porter, 1985). They\nconclude that the remarkable and sustained success of some\nU.S. companies (e.g., Southwest Airlines, Wal-Mart, etc.)\n\"has had less to do with market forces than with company\nThe increased interest in culture has led to the develop-\nment of different theories/models/frameworks aiming at\nexplaining organizational culture (e.g., Hall, 1976; Hofstede,\nSchein, 1985) and its impact on as well as relevance for orga-\nnizations. However, this plethora of cultural frameworks,\nsometimes tied to specific contexts or phenomena, \"perpetu-\nates the lack of a paradigm and is a hindrance to accumula-\nTsui et al. (2007) conclude from their extensive literature\nreview that the development of a configuration model (see\nalso Meyer, Tsui, & Hinings, 1993) would be necessary to\nfurther increase the construct validity of culture. Meyer et al.\n(1993) refer to organizational configuration as \"any multidi-\nmensional constellation of conceptually distinct characteris-\ntics that commonly occur together. Numerous dimensions of\nenvironments, industries, technologies, strategies, structures,\ncultures, ideologies, groups, members, processes, practices,\nbeliefs, and outcomes have been said to cluster into configu-\nrations, archetypes, or gestalts\" (p. 1175). Thus, a configura-\ntion model of organizational culture needs to account for the\nmultidimensionality and complexity of organizations, which\ncalls for a multidisciplinary approach.\nIn a recent special issue of the Academy of Management\nReview (AMR) on \"Where are the New Theories of\nOrganization?\" Smith and Lewis (2011) stress that prevailing\ntheories of management and organizations are not able to\nfully capture organizational dynamics or change and their\nadherent complexity. Similarly, Ployhart and Vandenberg\n(2010) emphasize the need to consider time and change in\ndeveloping models, to consider the inherent effect of change\nover time on causal relationships between two constructs. In\nline with Maxwell and Cole (2007), they conclude that\n1University of Warwick, UK\n2Vienna University of Economics and Business,Austria\n3Liverpool John Moores University, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nDaniel Dauber, The Centre for Applied Linguistics, S1.74 Social Sciences\nBuilding, University of Warwick, Coventry, CV4 7AL, UK\nEmail: d.dauber@warwick.ac.uk\nA Configuration Model of Organizational\nCulture\nDaniel Dauber1, Gerhard Fink2, and MauriceYolles3\n Keywords\norganizational culture, strategy, structure, organizational learning, organizational processes\n2 SAGE Open\n\"cross-sectional research will often provide little insight into\nhow a variable will change over time and may quite often\nlead to inaccurate conclusions\" (Ployhart & Vandenberg,\n2010, p. 96). Due to the fact that organizational culture is a\nrelatively young field of research, most models have not yet\nbeen able to map organizational culture change over time by\nconsidering other organizational constructs (e.g., strategy or\nstructure) as well as existing empirical findings from other\nrelated disciplines. Organizational culture is often treated as\na variable with a linear relationship to other variables (e.g.,\nHofstede et al., 1990) from a static and functionalistic point\nof view. Drawing on two exemplary reviews (Ilies, Scott, &\nPloyhart and Vandenberg (2010) stress that empirical studies\nproduce controversial results with the same data set, when\ntime/change is introduced and measured as a separate vari-\nable. Thus, theoretical models should also be able to explain\nor at least indicate how and when certain variables change\nover time to provide meaningful, comprehensive, and accu-\nrate conclusions for scholars who wish to investigate into\norganizational culture and its impact on other constructs\nreflecting organizational phenomena.\nA major contribution of this article is the introduction of\nwell-defined processes, that is, feedback loops that explain\nhow and why organizational culture and other domains of an\norganization (e.g., strategy, structure) might change. We will\nshow that existing models tend to provide rather static, linear\nand/or ambiguous relationships and therefore seem less reli-\nable in explaining organizational dynamics and complexity\nas described by Ployhart and Vandenberg (2010) or Smith\nand Lewis (2011). For the most part, this is due to the lack of\nexplanations for links between elements of models. If we\nconsider the relationship between strategy and structure, we\nmight not only be interested in how these \"fit\" each other to\nallow for a proper operational functioning of an organiza-\ntion but also investigate into those processes, which trigger\nchange toward or away from \"fit.\" Looking between the\n\"boxes\" of a model and focusing on the \"arrows,\" which\nconnect them, should, at least, be equally appreciated by\nBy discussing and synthesizing relevant research in the\nfield of cultural and organizational studies, we address the\naforementioned issues and conclude with a configuration\nmodel of organizational culture. The applicability of this\nmodel falls into the realm of organizational culture, strategy-\nstructure research, as well as organizational behavior, in\nwhich it is rooted.\nFirst, we will discuss the crucial difference between soci-\netal culture and organizational culture as well as their rela-\ntionship and relevance for the understanding of the proposed\nmodel. Next, we review recognized organizational culture\nmodels or models including organizational culture as an\nimportant component in light of (a) relative \"completeness\"\nWhetten, 1989), (b) relative ability to explain change over\ntime (see also Ployhard & Vandenberg, 2010), and (c) explan-\natory power with respect to cross-level relationships (e.g.,\ninternal\u00adexternal environment relationships; see also Tsui\net al., 2007). The review of literature closes by showing\nhow the presented theories and models meaningfully com-\nplement each other as well as how they contribute to the\ndevelopment of the presented model. This is followed by a\nstep-by-step development of the configuration model of\norganizational culture, which is based on theoretical con-\nIn line with findings of related research, the dynamic rela-\ntionships between four central and recurring organizational\ncharacteristics, that is, domains (organizational culture,\nstrategy, structure, and operations) will be explained. The\narticle closes with a discussion on how the model (a) contrib-\nutes to a better understanding of organizational culture and\n(b) can improve future research on organizational phenom-\nena. We will support our ideas by referring to a recent empir-\nical study on organizational culture change in acquisitions,\nwhich provides first insights into the reliability and useful-\nness of the suggested model. The presented configuration\nmodel of organizational culture is tailored to the needs of\ncross-cultural research scholars who wish to investigate into\ncross-level phenomena in organizations and change pro-\ncesses alike. As such, it emphasizes reciprocity and interde-\npendencies of organizational constructs.\nOrganizational CultureTheory\nand OrganizationTheory Revisited\nThe concept of organizational culture has its major roots in\nculture theory. Among the most popular publications in the\nfield of cultural studies are those of Alvesson (2002);\nChhokar, Brodbeck, and House (2007); Denison, Haaland,\net al. (1990); and House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman, and\nGupta (2004). Their seminal work deals with various dimen-\nsions of societal and organizational culture or concentrates\non leadership practices in organizations and uses a distinct\nset of team or group leadership dimensions that are of high\nrelevance for organizational cultures. Organizational culture,\nas a construct separable from societal culture, has been\nsubject to research for some decades, and various models\ncan be found across different disciplines. Generally,\napproaches to organizational culture can be classified into\nthree categories: (a) dimensions approach (e.g., Chatterjee,\nSagiv & Schwartz, 2007), (b) interrelated structure approach\nsions approach strongly focuses on measuring organiza-\ntional culture empirically along (in some cases bipolar)\nscales that can be related to other, mostly dependent, vari-\nables of interest (see also Tsui et al., 2007). Interrelated\nDauber et al. 3\nstructure approaches concentrate on linking the concept of\norganizational culture to other constructs or characteristics\nof organizations and less to single variables. Therefore, they\noften represent the theoretical underpinning for empirical\nresearch designs. This approach tends to be multidisci-\nplinary in nature, which commonly characterizes configura-\ntion models (Meyer et al, 1993). Typology approaches are\nbased on predefined key characteristics that divide and\ncluster organizations into certain categories, not necessarily\ndefining the relationship of these characteristics to each\nother. Meyer et al. (1993) note that \"the allocation of orga-\nnizations to types often is not clear-cut. Because of their a\npriori nature and frequent lack of specified empirical refer-\nents and cutoff points, typologies are difficult to use empiri-\ncally\" (p. 1182). As we explicitly look at relationships\nbetween constructs, so far typology approaches appear to\ncontribute little to our understanding of a configuration\nmodel of organizational culture. Therefore, we will primar-\nily draw on dimensions and interrelated structure approaches\nin the following sections. Nevertheless, the suggested model\nmight well serve for the development of specific organiza-\ntional types, if this is desired or maybe even required by a\nspecific inquiry.\nIn the following, we clarify how and why societal culture\ndiffers from organizational culture and review most common\norganizational culture models that are frequently applied or\nreferred to by many scholars. By doing so, we highlight the\nfundamental roots of our configuration model and outline the\nbasis of its theoretical foundation.\nSocietal CultureVersus Organizational\nCulture: Related but Different Constructs\nThe dimensions approach is one of the most prominent\napproaches to cultural constructs, in particular in quantitative\nresearch. Conventional anthropological research designs have\npartly lost ground due to the paradigm of culture dimensions\ncontexts that are based on the quantitative measurement of\ncultures. The popularity of Hofstede's five national culture\ndimensions (power distance, individualism, masculinity,\nuncertainty avoidance, long-term vs. short-term orientation)\ncan partly be \"attributed to a simplification of the approach to\nzational culture, Hofstede et al. (1990) highlight that there is\na significant difference between national culture and organi-\nzational culture. The latter is defined and conceptualized by\nsix dimensions of perceived practices and should not be con-\nfused with national culture values.\nWhile the dimensional model of organizational culture by\nHofstede et al. (1990) was initially derived from a large set\nof narrative interviews and a consequent test with a question-\nnaire, Sagiv and Schwartz (2007) define the organizational\nculture construct based on theoretical considerations. They\nargue that organizational culture is influenced by the \"sur-\nrounding society,\" \"personal value priorities of organizational\nmembers,\" and \"the nature of the organization's primary\ntasks.\" Organizations are embedded into societies, which can\nbe defined by certain national culture values. Sagiv and\nSchwartz (2007) argue that organizations operate under soci-\netal pressure. Therefore, organizations have to comply to\nnorms, values, and regulations of societies to be an accepted\nmember of this society and secure social and consequently\nfinancial survivability. Organizations consist of individuals\nwho introduce their own value preferences into the organiza-\ntion, which represents the \"way people select actions, evalu-\nate people and events, and explain their actions and\norganizational culture to a certain extent. Finally, Sagiv and\nSchwartz (2007) add that tasks, which need to be achieved by\nan organization, shape their cultural values as well. This\nseems to coincide with what Hofstede et al. (1990) defined\nas \"perceived practices.\" Different tasks require different\norganization and execution of activities, that is, different\nstrategies and structures. It seems obvious that a production\ncompany differs severely from a service provider, or a state\nagency from a private firm, not only with respect to final\nproducts but also with respect to their organizational culture.\nThis is mainly due to the different nature of businesses, cli-\nents, and operating processes.\nIn view of the above, two quite important aspects have to\nbe taken into consideration when developing a configuration\nmodel of organizational culture: (a) Organizational values sig-\nnificantly differ from national or societal values and (b) orga-\nnizationalvaluesareaffectedbysocietalvalues,organizational\nmembers (personality, value preferences), and their tasks,\nwhich require appropriate organizational actions to be\nachieved. This interaction has to be illustrated and explained\nby a configuration model of organizational culture, which\ndistinguishes between external environmental influences\n(e.g., societal culture) and internal cultural environmental\ninfluences (e.g., organizational culture). Although both pre-\nsented approaches (Hofstede et al., 1990; Sagiv & Schwartz,\n2007) allow for classifications of organizations, they have to\nbe considered as predominantly static. They provide limited\nconclusions about organizational processes related to organi-\nzational values and do not incorporate mechanisms that relate\nto change of organizational cultures. Therefore, the next sec-\ntion will discuss selected interrelated structure models that\nconsider culture in conjunction with other organizational con-\nstructs, for example, strategy, structure, and behavior, which\nconstitute another building block for the development of the\nconfiguration model and add to its comprehensiveness.\nLinking Organizational CultureTheory\nand OrganizationTheory: Commonly\nRelated Concepts in the Literature\nExisting research offers a great variety of models, which\nattempt to explain relationships between organizational cul-\nture and related organizational constructs, for example,\n4 SAGE Open\nstrategy and structure. However, not all of them seem to be\nof equal relevance in research practice. For the development\nof the configuration model, we concentrate on four exem-\nplary models that appear to have been frequently selected as\na valid source of reference by many scholars: Schein (1985)\nPerish, http://www.harzing.com/pop.htm).\nSchein's (1985) model of organizational culture is not\nonly one of the most cited culture models but also one that\nserves a high degree of abstraction and complexity reduction.\nIt mainly consists of three domains: (a) basic underlying\nassumptions, (b) espoused values, and (c) artifacts. Schein\n(1985) distinguishes between observable and unobservable\nelements of culture. From Figure 1, it becomes clear that\nthere is a certain hierarchy between these domains. Visible\nbehavior influences and is influenced by unobservable\nassumptions through rules, standards, and prohibitions.\nNot only does Hatch (1993) add a fourth domain, called\n\"symbols,\" she also defines the processes that link each ele-\nment of the organizational culture construct, which provides\na somewhat better understanding of interdependencies in\nthis model. Hatch (1993) assumes that there exist two pos-\nsible ways how observable behavior emerges through under-\nlying assumptions: (a) through \"manifestation\" into values\nand \"realization\" into artifacts or (b) through \"interpretation\"\ninto symbols and through \"symbolization\" into artifacts (see\nalso Figure 1). Nevertheless, it remains unclear under which\nconditions such processes take place and which factors deter-\nmine the path for transformation of assumptions into arti-\nfacts, that is, when will assumptions become \"manifested\"\nand \"realized\" and when are assumptions \"interpreted\" and\n\"symbolized.\"\nBoth models seem to explain cultural dynamics. Whereas\nSchein (1985) focuses strongly on domains of organizational\nculture, Hatch (1993) specifies four processes that link these\ndomains. For the development of a configuration model,\nboth approaches provide a simplified but limited perspective\non culture in organizations. This is due to the high level of\nabstraction, which confines the explanatory power regarding\ninterdependencies between organizational culture and other\ndomains of an organization (e.g., strategy, structure, opera-\ntions, etc.). The idea of external pressure on organizational\nculture, that is, effects of the external environment, as pro-\nposed by Sagiv and Schwartz (2007), is not replicable by\nare not explicitly considered in their models. Still, they pro-\nvide a meaningful basis for the development of an \"internal\nenvironment\" of an organization. A comprehensive configu-\nration model of organizational culture, however, should not\nonly map internal processes guided by organizational culture\nbut also illustrate consequences of, for example, manifesta-\ntion, realization, interpretation, and symbolization for the\nexternal environment and vice versa.\nNext, we present two models that address the role of the\nexternal environment. Homburg and Pflesser (2000) aim at\ndeveloping a model that can be used to explain relationships\nbetween organizational culture and performance outcomes.\nThey highlight that \"market dynamism\" (i.e., external envi-\nronment) moderates this relationship. Organizational culture\nis defined similarly to Schein (1985) with three layers.\nHowever, Homburg and Pflesser (2000) distinguish between\nartifacts and behavior, which belong in this model to the\nsame layer. Whereas artifacts refer to \"stories, arrangements,\nbehavior is defined as \"organizational behavioral patterns\nwith an instrumental function\" (Homburg & Pflesser, 2000,\np. 450). Consequently, behavior does not influence, but is\ninfluenced by, norms and artifacts. While this model and its\nrelationships had been empirically tested, the model does not\nconsider interaction, but only linear effects from culture to\nperformance. Organizational culture dynamics (i.e., cultural\nchange) as proposed by Ployhart and Vandenberg (2010) or\nSmith and Lewis (2011) are not considered. The model has\nlimited explanatory power for effects of the external envi-\nronment on an organization and assumes no feedback\nArfacts\n(visible behavior)\nEspoused values\n(rules, standards prohibions)\nBasic underlying assumpons\n(invisible, unconscious)\nAssumpons\nValues\nSymbols\nArfacts\nmanifestation realization\nsymbolization\ninterpretation\nDauber et al. 5\nprocesses. This stands in contrast to considerations of Sagiv\nand Schwartz (2007), who emphasize the close relationship\nof and interaction between societal culture (i.e., external\nenvironment, institutions) and organizational culture (i.e.,\ninternal environment, self-organization, self-reference,\nidentity).\nThe model developed by Allaire and Firsirotu (1984) rep-\nresents the most complex approach to organizational culture\namong those presented in this article. It covers several\naspects mentioned so far. First, it clearly distinguishes\nbetween external (society, history, contingency) and internal\nenvironment (cultural system, sociostructural system).\nSecond, it conveys that organizational values are influenced\nby the external environment, but, at the same time, can be\nidentified as a separate culture system (as did Hofstede et al.,\n1990). As can be seen from Figure 2, the sociostructural sys-\ntem, including structure, strategies, policies, and processes,\nstands in line with the culture system; that is, it should be\nlegitimized by myths, values, and ideologies. Allaire and\nFirsirotu (1984) recognize \"individual actors\" who are seen\nas the medium for organizational output and influence as\nwell as are influenced by the cultural and sociostructural sys-\ntem. Furthermore, it can be concluded from this model that\norganizational culture is influenced directly by the external\nenvironment and by employees, who bring in their own per-\nsonalities and perceptions of social values, rules, and norms\n(see Sagiv & Schwartz, 2007). Nevertheless, the model\npartly provides underspecified links between each element\nof the model, especially among those that build the cultural\nand sociostructural system. In contrast to Homburg and\norganizational output might have an impact on organiza-\ntional culture, but leave this relationship unspecified (see\nunconnected arrows in Figure 2). Thus, both presented\napproaches can provide answers to \"What are the factors that\nshould be considered in a configuration model?\" but provide\nonly limited insights in \"how\" these factors are linked to\neach other, what normally is described as \"using arrows to\nconnect the boxes\" in a visualized model (Whetten, 1989,\nproperly define processes linking each element of a model to\nmake it comprehensive, meaningful, and applicable for\nscholars conducting empirical research.\nIn light of this review, we identify recurrent domains of\norganizational culture that should be represented by a con-\nfiguration model: (a) value and belief system capturing the\nunderlying assumptions of organizational behavior; (b) strategy,\nrepresenting the overall orientation toward task achievement\nand impacts on structures and activities of an organization\n(According to classic strategic management, strategies\ndefine what should be done, whereas structures and opera-\ntional activities illustrate how things should be done); (c)\nstructural system, reflecting the manifestation of values and\nbeliefs as norms, rules, and regulations, which build the\nframe of reference for organizational processes and patterns\nof behavior, and stand in line with a predefined strategy; (d)\norganizational activities/operations/actions, that is, patterns\nof behavior, as the observable manifestation of values, strat-\negies, and structures; and (e) external environment as an\ninfluential factor through evaluation processes on organiza-\ntional culture and the internal environment of the whole\norganization at large.\nThese five domains are also represented by the model of\nHatch and Cunliffe (2006; see Figure 3). Here, all domains\nare linked with each other, and no specific processes are\nidentified. Considering Whetten (1989), this indicates a\nsomehow incomplete model as links between domains are\nambiguous and undefined. The following sections are less\nconcerned with the discussion and definition of constructs to\nbe included in a configuration model of organizational\nFigure 2. Organizational culture models by Homburg and Pflesser (2000) and Allaire and Firsirotu (1984)\n6 SAGE Open\nculture. This has been subject to investigation for many\nyears. Our major emphasis lies on how we can better under-\nstand the relationships between these constructs in a single\nand noncontradictory model.\nDeveloping a Configuration Model\nof Organizational Culture\nThe suggested configuration model distinguishes between\ndomains and processes. Whereas domains belong to certain\nconstructs, for example, organizational culture, strategy,\nstructure, and so on, processes link elements of a model to\neach other; that is, they explain relationships between con-\nstructs. Thus, elements of the configuration model of organi-\nzational culture need to refer to either a domain or a process.\nAccording to Hatch and Cunliffe (2006), we can distinguish\nbetween four elements or domains: (a) organizational culture\nand identity; (b) organizational strategy; (c) organizational\ndesign, structure, and processes; and (d) organizational\nbehavior and performance. Hatch and Cunliffe (2006) also\nrefer to \"strategic response to external environment.\"\nHowever, responding clearly refers to a certain form of\naction, namely, reaction to a specific event. Thus, \"strategic\nresponse to external environment\" denominates a process,\nwhich links the organization to its external environment.\nRelationships of the internal and external environment will\nbe discussed in a later section of this article.\nWhereas the model of Hatch and Cunliffe (2006) suggests\nmultiple but undefined interactions between specific domains,\nSchein (1985) suggests particular relationships between three\nrather broad domains. By conflating these two approaches,\nBasic\nunderlying\nassumpons\nEspoused\nvalues\nArfacts\nOrganizational\nCulture & Identity\nOrganizational\nStrategy\nOrganizational\nDesign, Structure &\nProcess\nOrganizational\nBehavior and\nPerformance\nFigure 4. Allocating Hatch and Cunliffe's (2006) domains to\nSchein's (1985) model of organizational culture\nFigure 3. Organizational culture model by Hatch and Cunliffe (2006)\nDauber et al. 7\nwe can achieve a more comprehensive model. As is shown in\nFigure 4, it is possible to allocate all four domains of Hatch\nand Cunliffe (2006) to the general domains of Schein's\n(1985) dynamic model of organizational culture.\nFollowing Schein (1985), \"organizational culture\" repre-\nsents underlying, unobservable assumptions, which constitute\nthe basis for every organization. \"Organizational strategy\" pro-\nvides rules, norms, and regulations, which are set into effect\nthrough organizational structures. Therefore, strategy belongs\nto an unobservable domain and can be allocated to \"espoused\nvalues.\" \"Organizational design, structure, and process\" as\nwell as \"organizational behavior and performance\" are those\nelements of an organization that are visible to its members as\nwell as the external environment; that is, they represent arti-\nfacts. However, we have to exclude \"processes\" because these\nare defined as relationships between domains.\nThe presented basic structure of relationships, which indi-\ncates a clear order of domains and processes, bears the oppor-\ntunity to connect to several existing fields of research to\nconcretize these domains and processes. Through synthesiz-\ning existing research in the field, we aim at a more compre-\nhensive, well-defined, and empirically testable configuration\nmodel of organizational culture.\nThe Relationship Between Organizational\nBehavior/Performance and Organizational\nStructure\nBehavior/performance unfolds as observable manifestations\n(phenomena) of predefined strategies as regulated by organi-\nzational structures. This domain puts into effect patterns of\nbehavior, derived from strategies and structures. It makes an\norganization's existence as a market player visible. Successful\noperations lead to profits, thus constitute economic surviv-\nability of an organization.\nStructures are the manifestation of strategic orientations\nand regulate information flows, decision making, and patterns\nof behavior, that is, the \"internal allocation of tasks, decisions,\nrules, and procedures for appraisal and reward, selected for\nthe best pursuit of . . . [a] strategy\" (Caves, 1980, p. 64). Level\nof hierarchy and control in an organization can, among other\nissues, be identified in this domain. Structures develop due to\nthe need to organize behavior in a meaningful way and pro-\nvide orientation for organizational members to set actions that\ncomply with organizational strategy, organizational culture,\nand, as a result, accepted patterns of behavior.\nIn line with Schein (1985), organizational structures and\nbehavior constitute the observable manifestation of organi-\nzational strategies (espoused values). From Figure 5, it can be\nconcluded that organizational structure and organizational\nbehavior are directly linked to each other as they both refer to\nartifacts. Thus, structures build the frame of reference for run-\nning organizational operations and guide or cushion behavior\nof members of an organization, which translate into certain\n\"patterns of behavior\" supported by organizational struc-\ntures. At the same time, behavior is also reversely linked to\nstructures. Here, we account for adjustment processes on the\nlevel of artifacts. Considering that organizations might need\nto change over time, for example, due to extensive interna-\ntionalization via mergers and acquisitions (M&As), it may\nbecome necessary to restructure certain or even all parts of\nan organization. Especially in M&As, this seems of particu-\nlar importance to align organizational behavior of new\nemployees in such a way that strategic goals can be accom-\nplished efficiently and economically via organizational\ntasks. Thus, structures need to change if organizational\nbehavior does not lead to the expected performance, for\nexample, on the market (Harris & Ruefli, 2000), identified\nthrough \"performance assessment.\" This might be coupled\nwith certain changes in strategy as well (see below). Missing\nto change structures or operations would threaten economic\nsurvivability of an organization if existing patterns of behav-\nior cannot sufficiently meet the requirements of organiza-\ntional tasks and, therefore, cannot deliver the desired\nperformance.\nDefining the Relationship Between\nStrategy, Structure, and Operations\nStrategies are commonly defined as the overall orientation\nof an organization for reaching preset goals and objectives\nplan for maximizing profits (Caves, 1980) or covering costs,\nin case of nonprofit organizations. Furthermore, organiza-\ntional strategy \"is an organization process, in many ways\ninseparable from the structure, behavior and culture of the\nFigure 5. Relationship between structure and behavior\n8 SAGE Open\nStrategies influence the interaction between structures and\nbehavior and vice versa. This conclusion derives naturally\nfrom Schein (1985) who argues that \"espoused values\" have\nan impact on \"artifacts,\" which in turn influence \"espoused\nvalues.\" As organizational structures as well as behavior\nwere identified as elements of organizational artifacts, both\nare affected by strategy. By considering this, we follow the\nseminal work on strategy-structure-fit. Chandler's (1962)\nfamous postulation that \"structure follows strategy\" (p. 314)\ncan be considered as a starting point for this debate. He\nempirically observed that organizations, after changes in\nstrategies, suffered from a phase of ineffectiveness. However,\nafter structural changes were achieved, organizations started\nto become more profitable again. Similar conclusions have\nbeen drawn by several other scholars or implicitly refer to\nWilliamson, 1975). Therefore, we can infer that different\nstrategies require different structures (Stopford & Wells,\nvide the frame of reference for future information processing\nand strategic decision making, commonly known as \"report-\ning.\" Thus, it is also true that structures have an impact on\nGalbraith & Nathanson, 1978). In view of the above, we can\nassume a feedback relationship between structure and strat-\negy as proposed by more recent research (Amburgey &\nProcesses that turn organizational strategies into action,\ncommonly known as \"operationalization,\" \"implementation\nof strategies,\" or \"strategy doing,\" unfold through organiza-\ntional structures and organizational activities. Strategies are\nput into effect through organizational structures and behav-\nior. With reference to \"operationalization,\" it seems worth-\nwhile to use the term \"operations\" instead of \"organizational\nbehavior and performance\" to emphasize that \"behavior,\" in\nthis context, represents the observable outcome of \"opera-\ntionalizing\" strategies. Operations might be oriented toward\nthe internal environment (inward-oriented operations) or\nexternal environment (outward-oriented operations).\nAs mentioned above, strategies might be subject to\nchange. However, to be aware of the fact that strategies need\nto change, it is necessary that organizations recognize defi-\ncits in performance through performance assessment. While\nthe pure assessment of, for example, decreasing revenues,\ndoes not necessarily lead to learning and changes in strate-\ngies, we have to account for organizational learning as \"pro-\ncesses of detecting and correcting error\" (Argyris, 1977,\np. 116). However, \"learning\" should not be confused with\n\"adaptation\" (for a more detailed discussion, see Fiol &\nLyles, 1985). According to the emerging configuration\nmodel of organizational culture, performance assessment\nmight lead to \"adaptation\" of structures. In contrast, only\nthrough \"learning,\" a change in strategy might take place.\nThus, assessing organizational performance might constitute\na trigger for learning but by no means should be understood\nas an automatic sequence of processes. Organizations might\nor might not learn from their mistakes. Dodgson (1993)\nargues that only organizations that \"purposefully construct\nstructures and strategies so as to enhance and maximize\norganizational learning\" (p. 377) can be considered as \"learn-\ning organizations.\" There might be barriers to learning such\nas \"poor vertical communication\" or \"poor coordination of\nfunctions, business or borders\" as described by Beer and\nEisenstat (2000). Therefore, we devise that through perfor-\nmance assessment (i.e., inward-oriented operations), changes\nin strategy and structure can be triggered, but learning pro-\ncesses rely on favorable organizational conditions such as\nopen communication structures, which would allow organiza-\ntions to learn. Learning processes, representing \"single-loop\nlearning\" (Argyris, 1977) in this case, are processes that may\narise from performance assessment. Assessing the efficiency\nof operations represents a binding condition for organiza-\ntional learning that leads to changes in strategy. Single-loop\nlearning, as distinguished from double-loop learning, refers\nto the processes of detecting errors and adjusting existing\nstrategies to meet new requirements. Double-loop learning,\nby contrast, refers to a more profound process of learning,\nwhere \"underlying organizational policies and objectives\"\n(Schein, 1985), are questioned and changed. This is compa-\nrable with what Fiol and Lyles (1985) describe as \"lower-level\nlearning\" and \"higher-level learning.\" Figure 6 summarizes\nthe relationships between strategy, structure, and operations.\nThe Impact of Organizational Culture on\nStrategy, Structure, and Operations\nSchein (1985) postulates that organizational culture (i.e.,\nbasic underlying assumptions) is directly linked to espoused\nEspoused\nvalues\nArfacts\nPatterns of\nbehavior\nPerformance\nassessment\nOperationalization\n(putting strategies into\neffect\nSingle-loop learning\n(adjustment of\nstrategy)\nFigure 6. Relationship between strategy, structure, and\noperations\nDauber et al. 9\nvalues, that is, strategy in the proposed model. As culture\nis often defined as a set of guiding principles, we can illus-\ntrate this by arguing that culture affects the process of\noperationalization. As a consequence, strategies are put into\neffect through structures and operations by considering\ncultural values, that is, underlying assumptions, held within\nan organization. This results in the following conclusions:\n(a) Operationalization has to stand in line with corporate val-\nues. (b) All domains--strategy, structure, and operations--\nare indirectly affected by culture. (c) Organizational values\nconstitute the shared \"ethics\" of doing business. Considering\nthe hierarchical order established by Schein (1985), it\nappears as if the impact of organizational culture on opera-\ntions unfolds through strategy (i.e., espoused values), which\nsupports the idea of a \"guiding\" or moderating influence on\norganizations during operationalization.\nSchein (1985) highlights that espoused values (strategies)\nhave an impact on underlying assumptions. Translated into\nthe configuration model, another learning process has to be\nconsidered: double-loop learning. As already mentioned\nabove, single-loop learning refers to the detection of errors\nand the adjustment of strategies to overcome mistakes.\nDouble-loop learning, however, questions existing underly-\ning assumptions, that is, organizational culture, and may lead\nto more fundamental changes in strategies and their opera-\ntionalization. Although single-loop learning is a precondi-\ntion for double-loop learning, it would be wrong to assume\nthat single-loop learning automatically effectuates double-\nloop learning (Argyris, 1977). By contrast, Argyris and\nSch\u00f6n (1978) shows that many organizations are quite capa-\nble of single-loop learning, but fail to learn on a higher level,\nthat is, double-loop learning.\nIn conclusion, we can define a configuration model of\norganizational culture that reflects internal processes of an\norganization, linking organizational culture, strategy, structure,\nand operations systematically to each other. In addition, we\nsketched dynamic processes of an organization, which allows\nto map change processes between all domains, determined by\nwell-defined processes (see Figure 7) derived from seminal\ncontributions to organization theory and organizational cul-\nture theory. These processes are interrelated in such a way\nthat conditions for change in domains can be systematically\ntraced and analyzed. For example, only through single-loop\nlearning changes in strategy formulation and operationaliza-\ntion can take place. It is necessary to mention that changes in\nstrategy might also be triggered without single-loop learning.\nHowever, it has to be assumed that successful and efficient\nstrategies have to reflect market opportunities (Porter, 1980,\n1985) or unique internal resources of an organization, which\nallowforcompetitiveadvantages(Barney,1991).Consequently,\nadjustments in strategy are more likely initiated by unfavorable\nchanges in organizational performance than pure desire for\nchange.\nNext, we have to consider that organizations are embedded\nin various contexts, which can generally be called the \"exter-\nnal environment.\" Recalling the models cited in the beginning\nof this article, in particular the model by Hatch and Cunliffe\n(2006), we recognize that a differentiation between internal\nand external environment is reasonable to determine processes\nrelated to the organization itself and those related to the out-\nside world, for example, society or market. Thus, we have to\nfurther extend the model and consider the external environ-\nment as part of a configuration model of organizational cul-\nture, as suggested by Tsui et al. (2007).\nBasic\nunderlying\nassumpons\nEspoused\nvalues\nArfacts\nORGANIZATIONAL\nCULTURE\nPatterns of\nbehavior\nPerformance\nassessment\nOperationalization\nSingle-loop\nlearning\nGuidance\n(values guide the\nprocess of\noperationalization)\nDouble-loop\nlearning\nFigure 7. Organizational culture model: Internal environment\nAdding the Aspect of Environmental\nRelationships to the Configuration\nModel of Organizational Culture\nWe define external environment as \"all elements outside the\nboundary of the organization\" (Daft, 2009) to which an orga-\nnizationneedstoadapt(Aldrich&Pfeffer,1976).Organizations,\nhowever, can also have an impact on their environment. While\nthe organizational environment can be viewed as \"relatively\ndynamic approach, which can account for rapid changes in\nthe environment as triggers for changes in organizations, at\nleast in the long run. As we aim at a configuration model of\norganizational culture, which is valid in different contexts,\nthe potential model should be able to consider various envi-\nronments, for example, different industries. Therefore,\nusing solely either \"the market\" or \"the society\" as domains\nfor external environments would limit the model to these\ncontexts. To avoid overgeneralization, we identify two dif-\nferent and distinguishable external environments to which\nan organization is fundamentally linked: legitimization\nenvironment and task environment (following Donnelly-\nLegitimization environment refers to all stakeholders of\nan organization, as defined by Freeman (1984). Thus, orga-\nnizations are legitimized by and need to justify their activi-\ntiestoseveralgroupsofstakeholders,forexample,customers,\nshareholders, employees, suppliers, and so on, which some-\ntimes may even pursue conflicting interests. This is what is\ncommonly understood as institutionalism (e.g., DiMaggio &\ngeneralized perception or assumptions that the actions of an\nentity are desirable, proper or appropriate within some\nsocially constructed system of norms, values beliefs and\nlights that organizations do not only reflect their \"members'\ngoals, motives or needs,\" but are to some extent dependent\non goals, motives, and needs of the external environment.\nWith reference to society, as a rather general group of stake-\nholders, we identify the notion of \"pressure\" originating\nfrom national culture. Sagiv and Schwartz (2007) argue that\norganizations are operating under social pressure and have to\noperate in line with societal values to be accepted as a mem-\nber of society. The idea of \"social pressure\" on an organiza-\ntion had already been mentioned by Parsons (1960) and\nMeyer and Rowan (1977). Thus, we can conclude that orga-\nnizational culture is affected by national culture in two ways:\n(a) through society and (b) through employees who bring in\ntheir own perception of national values (see also Sagiv &\nSchwartz, 2007). In view of the above, organizational cul-\nture legitimizes strategies, structures, and operations but\nneeds to stand in line with societal values. Consequently,\norganizational culture shares to some extent similar values\nwith those held by stakeholders. Whereas organizational val-\nues partly reflect societal values, organizational culture can\nsignificantly be distinguished from national culture (Hofstede\net al. 1990), as organizational culture is also determined by\nstrategy, structure, and operations. Based on these conclu-\nsions, there are two important aspects that need to be mapped\nby a configuration model of organizational culture: (a) a sepa-\nrate domain that represents the \"legitimization environment\"\nand (b) two processes that link this domain to the organiza-\ntion, namely, \"pressure of legitimization\" and \"legitimization\nmanagement\"--The latter assures stakeholders that the orga-\nnization operates in a way \"that is consistent with societal\ninfluence regulating institutions.\nTask environment is what mostly likely could be associ-\nated with \"the market.\" However, we abstain from using the\nterm \"market,\" as organizations may pursue different opera-\ntions related to several markets or even activities that are\nonly loosely linked to \"markets,\" for example, voluntary\nsupport of elderly or handicapped people. Generally, organi-\nzations develop strategies to achieve certain tasks that are\neither profitable or, at least, constitute financial survivability.\nThus, organizational structures need to account for certain\nlevels of performance (Child, 1972). For example, whereas\nnonprofit organizations aim at equaling expenditures with\nrevenues and donations, for-profit organizations intend to\ngenerate revenues that exceed their expenditures, resulting in\na profit/surplus. Consequently, operations (as determined in\nour model) are directed at the successful accomplishment of\ntasks, performed by a given organizational structure. From\nthis, we can conclude that operations are directly linked to\nthe task environment in two ways: (a) through \"actions,\"\ndetermined as a coupling of structures and operations and\n(b) through \"market feedback\" as a response to organiza-\ntional operations. As operations are strongly linked to struc-\ntures, these structures indirectly influence the link between\noperations and task environment. This is an essential point,\nas structures cannot meet tasks by themselves, but rather ful-\nfill a supportive and guiding (or controlling) function for\noperations. At the same time, the external environment can\nby no means directly change organizational structures. A\nchange in structures is always implemented by internal\nactivities, that is, inward-oriented operations. Consequently,\nthrough internal performance assessment, the external envi-\nronment can indicate a need for change of organizational\nstructures and by that trigger a change process. Structures are\ndefined and set up by organizations and are directed at task\nachievement in the task environment or legitimization man-\nagement as a response to cultural pressure of stakeholders.\nFigure 8 provides the final configuration model of organiza-\ntional culture, which considers the internal as well as the\nexternal environment.\nIn view of the above, we can argue that organizations are\npartly shaped by their external environment. This is not a\nnew finding. Thompson (2003) emphasizes that organizations\ndiffer among and within them. In particular, he describes that\ncharacteristics of environments, such as level of uncertainty\nand complexity, require different forms of organizations. With\nrespect to variation within organizations, he postulated that\n(1) all organizations are, by their nature, open to the\nenvironment, (2) all organizations must adapt to their\nenvironments by crafting appropriate structures, but\n(3) organizations are differentiated systems, and some\ncomponents or sub-units are designed to be more\nopen--and some are more closed--to environmental\ninfluences than others. (Thompson, 2003, xix-xxx)\nThese assumptions also hold for our configuration model\nof organizational culture. The model can illustrate different\ntypes of organizations and clearly defines structures and\noperations as being more open and affected by the environ-\nment than strategies, which change only through learning\nprocesses. In line with Open Systems Theory, we argue that\neach organization is an open system that needs to stand in a\ndynamic equilibrium with the environment (Richard, 1992;\nDonelly-Cox & O'Regan, 1999). This is mapped in our con-\nfiguration model of organizational culture, as changes in any\ndomain necessarily lead to a process of response to this\nchange, irrespective of the effectiveness and efficiency of the\nresponse or the respective processes.\nApplicability andValue of\nthe Configuration Model of\nOrganizational Culture\nThe presented configuration model should be understood\nas a first step toward a more holistic (see also Tsui et al.,\n2007) and dynamic approach to organizational culture,\nthat is, accounts for change over time (e.g., Mitchell &\nlowing, we discuss how the presented model meets these\ncriteria and adds value to our understanding of organiza-\ntional culture and processes of organizational culture\nchange.\nUnderstanding organizational processes =\nunderstanding organizational (culture) change =\nunderstanding organizational (culture) dynamics\nThe configuration model of organizational culture\nemphasizes the need to understand processes and domains\nalike to fully grasp the nature of organizational culture\ndynamics. We foregrounded in the model that change, a\nmajor theme of this model, is a process, which hardly can\nbe reflected by domains, except by collecting data at dif-\nferent points in time. However, the innate problem of col-\nlecting time series data about domains is its incapability to\ninvestigate in change as a separate variable, which can be\nfurther investigated or even classified. Thus, treating\nchange as a black box and comparing two states of a\ndomain at different times might not provide any insights\ninto how efficient such a change process has been, although\nthe final result might have yielded a better organizational\nperformance. The configuration model of organizational\nculture provides the basis for running such analysis,\nassuming that organizational learning processes can trig-\nger change, and \"guidedance\", \"operationalization\", and\n\"patterns of behavior\" shape change toward a new state of\ndomains, for example, a shift from an international divisional\nFigure 8. Configuration model of organizational culture: Internal and external environment\nstructure to a global matrix. This allows conducting research\nrelated to functions or dysfunctions of such processes\nconjointly.\nThe call for more dynamic models is largely attributed to\nthe accelerated dynamic changes in the external environ-\nment. Organizations may differently respond to such changes.\nWe highlighted that the capability to adjust or even learn\nfrom changes in the market can considerably shape the future\nof an organization. Lack of organizational learning and pri-\nmary emphasis on adjustment processes could threaten long-\ntermstrategicgoalsorevenfinancialsurvivability.Conducting\nresearch on whether strategies or structures meet require-\nments of the external environment are important to identify\nthe urgency for change. Still, managers as well as scholars\nwould remain rather shortsighted by (a) considering a poten-\ntial mis-\"fit\" between organizational domains and the external\nenvironment only and (b) neglecting the need to understand\nwhy or why not change processes are more or less success-\nful. The configuration model of organizational culture aims\nat making this explicit by providing meaningful explana-\ntions for relationships between organizational constructs.\nThe importance of organizational processes is not necessar-\nily new to the field of organization theory; however, respec-\ntivemodels,whichtendtoincludethenotionoforganizational\nculture, tend to undervalue the role of processes in shaping\norganizational life and performance. As was highlighted in\nthe introductory sections of this article, attempts to synthe-\nsize different research areas in organization studies or cul-\ntural studies have been rare and somewhat incomplete.\nDauber (2011), who applied the configuration model of\norganizational culture, investigated into the blending of differ-\nent organizational cultures, also known as \"hybridization\"\n(Dauber & Fink, 2009). With the help of the proposed model, it\nwas possible to show effects deriving from partial accultura-\ntion, that is, integration, assimilation, separation, and margin-\nalization of domains (see also Berry, 1980; Haspeslagh &\nJemison, 1991). Existing research on acculturation modes in\npost-M&A processes recognized only differences in social and\nstructural integration (e.g., Bj\u00f6rkman, Stahl, & Vaara, 2007;\nBurgelman & McKinney, 2006; Puranam, Singh, & Chaudhuri,\nDauber (2011) finds that assimilation or integration of struc-\ntures and strategies seemed to be a relatively easy task for the\nacquirer in the respective case studies. However, the harmoni-\nzation of conflicting values and beliefs caused considerable\nmisbehavior, that is, resistance by acquired employees.\nIneffective organizational culture change processes resulted\nin financial losses by the companies involved, although tar-\nget companies were successfully \"integrated\" with respect to\ntheir strategy, structure, and operations, that is, their domains\nbut not their processes. Considering the data in light of the\nconfiguration model of organizational culture, it became clear\nthat sensemaking processes (reflected by single- and double-\nloop learning) are strongly shaped by previous corporate\nvalues and determined the way change was perceived and\ntreated by the two parties involved. Different values became\na barrier to mutual learning from each other. Whereas adjust-\nment processes formally seemed to be successful, that is,\nimplemented rules reflected by structures were the same,\nlearning processes were not. Thus, sensemaking of new rules\nwithin the target companies was different, difficult, or even\nfailed, which caused considerable confusion and frustration\namong employees. This example conveys that differences in\norganizational processes appear to be at least as important as\ndifferences in domains. Nevertheless, more research is\nrequired to fully understand the value of these certainly prom-\nising preliminary findings.\nCopingWith Multidimensionality,\nHolism, and Complexity\nIn line with Tsui et al. (2007), models of culture and organi-\nzational culture, respectively, need to be further developed\nto be applicable in different contexts as well as consider\neffects from different levels of analysis. They emphasize that\ndeveloping a polycontextual model is a challenge, because\nwe need to draw on and understand different research disci-\nplines to gain more holistic insights into cultural effects on\ncertain constructs of interest. Following this advice, we\nelaborated the presented configuration model in such a way\nthat it confirms past empirical research and connects to dif-\nferent fields of organization research, for example, organiza-\ntional culture, strategy-structure fit research, organizational\nbehavior, organizational learning, and so on. By integrating\ncommonly known classes of (sometimes competing) theories\nor research findings, which enjoy widespread acceptance, the\npresented configuration model clearly reaches beyond exist-\ning organizational culture models (e.g., Hatch & Cunliffe,\nments or facets of organizational culture.\nThe proposed model suggests cross-level interdependen-\ncies, for example, relationships between internal and external\nenvironment. While some existing models vaguely indicate\nthis relationship (e.g., Allaire & Firsirotu, 1984; Hatch &\nonly limited insights in how such relationships are shaped or\ndetermined. Considering the \"how\" criterion of Whetten\n(1989), parts of those models presented at the beginning of\nthis article do not fully meet this requirement, that is, certain\nelements of the model are rather ambiguously related to each\nother. A strength of the configuration model of organizational\nculture is its ability to overcome this constraint to a large\nextent. In light of cybernetic systems approaches like those of\n2006), theoretical validation of the model is possible. The\ncybernetic nature of the model allows drawing conclusions\nfor cross-level analyses. The configuration model represents\na \"holon,\" that is, it meets the conditions of representing a\nwhole system, in this case an organization. Thus, the same\nmodel applies to the whole organization and to each of its\ndistinct subunits, for example, marketing department, finance\ndepartment, and so on. This model can be used to compare\ndifferent parts of an organization (departments, teams, groups)\nby using multiple configuration models of organizational cul-\nture, for example, exploring the level of \"culture-fit\" between\nan organization's overall culture and its subcultures. Cultural\ndifference within the organization, for example, different cul-\ntural perceptions of mangers (as a group) and staff (as a\ngroup), might have a considerable bearing for organizational\nperformance. However, it would also be possible to replace\nthe interaction with domains of the external environment by\nanother organization (i.e., another \"internal\" environment) to\nillustrate interorganizational relationships. An empirical\nexample of how two configuration models of organizational\nculture might interact with each other is provided by Dauber\n(2011) on post-M&A integration processes. In terms of the\nconfiguration model, an acquisition represents the \"integra-\ntion\" of a small part of the external environment (i.e., another\norganization) into the internal environment. Research in this\narea can be expected to produce new knowledge about orga-\nnizations and their functioning.\nCompared with previous models, the configuration model\nof organizational culture appears to be more complex, but\nstill systematic and logical. We believe that oversimplifica-\ntion of models rather harms our efforts to explore or explain\nsocial phenomena, such as organizational culture dynamics.\nWith the advent of new research methods, particularly driven\nby computer-aided tools of data collection and analysis, such\ncomplex models find their applicability in a meaningful and\nfeasible way. At the same time, it has to be accepted that for\nresearch on linear relationships, simpler models might\nequally serve as a theoretical base to illustrate unidirectional\neffects. However, scholars interested in change and recipro-\ncal relationships between constructs might more likely\nappreciate the configuration model of organizational culture\nas their preferred frame of reference.\nConcluding Remarks\nIn this article, we aimed at extending knowledge about orga-\nnizational cultures, strategies, structures, and operations by\nintroducing meaningful relationships, that is, defining pro-\ncesses between them. We are aware of the fact that these\nfirst results based on reviewing existing research as well as\nfirst empirical results can only be labeled as \"promising\nevidence\" for heading into the right direction. There is still\nmuch more fieldwork required to evaluate the proposed\nrelationships.\nOur intentions were less concerned with showing that\nother models are not applicable or meaningful. Most of them\nhave proven to be very valuable in the past within their\nrespective fields. However, the request for more dynamic,\nmultidimensional (e.g., Ployhart & Vandenberg, 2010; Smith\napproaches to organization studies calls for new models,\nwhich can fulfill these criteria. Our approach was strongly\ndriven by reviewing existing theories and empirical investi-\ngations to identify whether existing models already capture\nthe notions of change and processes related to organizational\nculture. We came to the conclusion that recognized models\nare most of the time limited in their applicability in complex\nand dynamic settings, simply because they were not neces-\nsarily designed for such contexts. The proposed configura-\ntion model of organizational culture appreciates existing\nresearch, but also provides new avenues for investigations\ninto current and possibly future phenomena which might be\npartly driven by factors that were of less importance in the\npast. The presented models show great potential for synthe-\nsis into a single and probably more contemporary model,\nwhich appreciates \"change\" as a common phenomenon\nwithin societies and economies.\nA major emphasis in developing the configuration model\nwas to spotlight processes that explain how widely accepted\nconstructs, such as strategy and structure, are related to orga-\nnizational culture as well as organizational culture change.\nWe identified six processes related to the internal environ-\nment of an organization, three of which are related to forward\nprocesses, that is, the manifestation of domains through guid-\nance, operationalization, and patterns of behavior.Another set\nof three processes is related to organizational change and\nlearning: adjustment processes, single-loop learning, and\ndouble-loop learning. Besides, we modeled relationships\nbetween the internal and external environment (task and legit-\nimization environment). Two fundamental processes of inter-\nacting with the external environment were identified (action\nand legitimization management). As a response to \"action\"\nand \"legitimization management,\" we elaborated the notion\nof \"market feedback\" and \"cultural pressure.\" Depending on\nthe degree of cultural pressure, an organization might have to\nengage in legitimization management. Likewise, in case of\nbad market feedback, an organization will have to consider\naltering its actions through change within the internal envi-\nronment. We encourage scholars to investigate not only into\nrelationships between organizational cultures, strategies, and\nstructures but also into the innate dynamics of these pro-\ncesses as suggested by the configuration model of organiza-\ntional culture.\nQuestions related to complex social phenomena often\nrequire rather complex answers. The configuration model of\norganizational culture serves a higher degree of complexity\ncompared with other models but remains within the bound-\naries of comprehensiveness due to its strong ties to existing\nresearch. Besides, the model does not favor a specific meth-\nodological paradigm; it can be applied in quantitative, quali-\ntative, and mixed-methods designs to test hypotheses or to\nexplain or explore organizational phenomena. Therefore the\napplicability of the model is manifold. We provided one\nexample by referring to the qualitative study of Dauber\n(2011) related to the context of M&As and organizational\nculture change. However, also quantitative studies based on\ntime series data might provide interesting and enlightening\ninsights (see, for example, Ployhart & Vandenberg, 2010).\nThe configuration model of organizational culture consti-\ntutes an important step forward to a more holistic, compre-\nhensive, and interdisciplinary approach to cultural dynamics\nin organizations and can serve as a meaningful reference to\nbuild new knowledge about culture effects in organizations.\nWe do not claim that different streams of existing research\nhave taken a too narrow view on organizations and cultural\neffects. However, just as much as we need to be aware of\nwhat we are looking at when conducting organization studies\nin a well-defined field, we should also be aware of what we\nare not looking at and how this may affect our analysis, find-\nings, and conclusions.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAldrich, H.
