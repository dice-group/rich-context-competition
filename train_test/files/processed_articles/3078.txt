One sample was drawn from\neach stratum.\nPreliminary sampling suggested that\napproximately half of all handgun pur-\nchaserswithanypriorcriminalhistoryhad\nbeen charged with an offense involving\nfirearms or violence. Sample sizes were\nplannedtomaximizestatisticalpowerfor\ncomparisonsinvolvingthissubgroup,with\nthe size of the cohort sufficient to detect\na relative risk (RR), depending on the in-\ncidence of a specific outcome event, of 1.5\nor higher with an  of .05 and a power of\nCriminal records were requested for\nall sampled purchasers, and final deter-\nmination of eligibility and study group\nassignment was made only after the rec-\nordshadbeenobtainedandreviewed.Of\neligible) whose registry entries did not\nindicatethatarecordwasonfileatCDOJ,\n41 were found to have had a criminal his-\ntoryatthetimeofhandgunpurchaseand\nwere assigned to that study group.

A random sample of 435\nof these were assigned to the no prior\ncriminal history study group, such that\nthesepurchaserswereappropriatelyrep-\nresentedinthatgroup,andtherestwere\nexcluded.\nThis initial review of criminal records\nfoundtohavehadacriminalhistoryprior\nto handgun purchase but whose records\nhadsubsequentlybeenpurgedandwere\nnot available. The CDOJ periodically re-\nviews a portion of its inactive criminal\nrecords and purges those that meet de-\nfined criteria. Records must be retained\nfor specified periods after an arrest or\nconviction; the retention period is con-\ntingent on the nature and the severity of\nthe offense.16 In practice, CDOJ's purg-\ning program focuses on records for the\noldest persons in its file. Among our po-\ntential study subjects, the proportion\nwhoserecordshadbeenpurgedwassub-\nstantially higher for those 50 years or\nolder than for younger handgun pur-\nchasers.Wethereforeexcludedfromthe\nstudy all persons who were 50 years or\nolder at the time of handgun purchase.\nthan 50 years whose criminal records\nhad been purged.\nwere excluded because, while they had\npreviously been arrested, they had not\nbeen convicted of any crime prior to pur-\nchasing their handguns. A total of 276\npersons were excluded because it could\nnot be determined whether they had a\ncriminal history at the time of handgun\npurchase, another 85 because their rec-\nords were missing for unknown reasons,\nand25becausetheyneverreceivedtheir\nguns or transferred them to other own-\ners shortly after purchase.\nData Acquisition and Management\nSenior CDOJ criminal records techni-\ncianstrainedourprojectstaffincriminal\nrecord review, and ambiguous criminal\nrecordswerediscussedwithCDOJstaff.\nWe used double data entry procedures\nfor all study data sets, with computer-\nized and manual comparisons.\nAll convictions and charges were re-\ncorded.Convictionswerenotcountedas\nevidenceofpriorcriminalactivityifthey\nhad also been dismissed before handgun\npurchase. A charge for a new offense\nduring the period of follow-up was con-\nsidered to be evidence of new criminal\nactivity.\nCrimes were grouped into the follow-\ning classes: those involving neither fire-\narms nor violence (eg, petty theft, driv-\ning under the influence of alcohol), those\ninvolving firearms but not violence (eg,\ncarrying a concealed firearm in a public\nplace),thoseinvolvingviolence(eg,simple\nassault, robbery) and, as a subset of vio-\nlent offenses, those classified by the Fed-\neral Bureau of Investigation as Violent\nCrime Index offenses: murder and non-\nnegligentmanslaughter,forciblerape,rob-\nbery, and aggravated assault.\nSimilarly, subjects with prior misde-\nmeanor convictions were grouped by\nwhether they had been convicted of fire-\narm-related or violent offenses as fol-\nlows: (1) prior conviction(s), but none for\noffensesinvolvingeitherfirearmsorvio-\nlence; (2) prior conviction(s) involving\nfirearms, but none involving violence;\nand (3) prior conviction(s) involving vio-\nlence.Nosubgroupofsubjectswithprior\nconvictions involving violence, but none\ninvolving firearms, could be established\nas it was not possible to distinguish be-\ntween violent offenses that involved\nfirearms and those that did not.

This\nwas done by linkage to the state's driv-\ner's license records, credit agency data,\nregistries of property owners, tele-\nphone directories, city directories, and\nstate and national mortality files.\nThis study was approved by the Uni-\nversityofCalifornia,Davis,HumanSub-\njects Review Committee.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe main outcome event was the first\noccurrence of a charge for a new offense.\nObservedincidencedensityratedatawere\nused to estimate RRs by Poisson regres-\nsion,15 with adjustment for sex, race, age\nat purchase, and time since purchase, and\nstratification by the type and number of\noffenses for which subjects had previ-\nously been convicted.
