    "abstract": "Abstract. Face aftereffects can help adjudicate between theories of how facial attributes are encoded.\nO'Neil and colleagues (2014) compared age estimates for faces before and after adapting to young,\nmiddle-aged or old faces. They concluded that age aftereffects are best described as a simple re-\nnormalisation--e.g. after adapting to old faces, all faces look younger than they did initially. Here\nI argue that this conclusion is not substantiated by the reported data. The authors fit only a linear\nregression model, which captures the predictions of re-normalisation, but not alternative hypotheses\nsuch as local repulsion away from the adapted age. A second concern is that the authors analysed\nabsolute age estimates after adaptation, as a function of baseline estimates, so goodness-of-fit\nmeasures primarily reflect the physical ages of test faces, rather than the impact of adaptation. When\ndata are re-expressed as aftereffects and fit with a nonlinear \"locally repulsive\" model, this model\nperforms equal to or better than a linear model in all adaptation conditions. Data in O'Neil et al. do\nnot provide strong evidence for either re-normalisation or local repulsion in facial age aftereffects, but\nare more consistent with local repulsion (and exemplar-based encoding of facial age), contrary to the\noriginal report.\n",

For\nexample, after looking at an old face, participants tend to rate middle-aged faces as being younger than\nthey had initially (Schweinberger et al., 2010). Face aftereffects may result from neural adaptation of\nchannels encoding facial attributes and, if so, studying the patterns of biases induced by adaptation\nmight help reveal the number and selectivity of such channels (Webster & MacLeod, 2011).\nThere are two prominent theories concerning how facial attributes are encoded. According to\nexemplar-based proposals, multiple channels encode each attribute, with each channel selective for a\nparticular value of that attribute, and no value playing a special role (Lewis, 2004; Valentine, 1991).\nAccording to norm-based proposals, channels are selective for the ways in which a face differs from a\nperceptual \"norm\" (e.g. the average face), which is constantly updated according to recent experience\n(Rhodes et al., 2005; Valentine, 1991). In simulations, these two encoding schemes predict mark-\nedly different patterns of adaptation-induced aftereffect (Storrs & Arnold, 2012; Webster & MacLeod,\n2011). Exemplar-based encoding can predict a locally repulsive pattern of biases after adaptation, like\nthat found after adapting to simple spatial properties such as orientation and spatial frequency (e.g.\nBlakemore, Nachmias & Sutton, 1970; Mitchell & Muir, 1976; Nemes, Whitaker, Heron, & McKee-\nfry, 2011; S\u00e8ries, Stocker, & Simoncelli, 2009. See Figure 1, left). Norm-based encoding can instead\npredict re-normalisation, involving a uniform bias at all points along the test continuum (see Figure\n1, right).\nDespite the qualitative differences between local repulsion and re-normalisation, it is not clear\nwhich best describes face aftereffects. The two proposals can only be clearly dissociated by measuring\nchanges in perception at the adapting face and for more \"extreme\" test faces, and this is difficult to do\nusing common methods such as binary classification tasks (Storrs & Arnold, 2012). In a recent paper,\nO'Neil, Mac, Rhodes, & Webster. (2014) attempted to overcome this problem by measuring aftereffect\npatterns along a natural facial dimension for which people can easily report the appearance of any test\nface, using a reasonably precise and reliable numerical value: age.\nIn O'Neil et al. (2014), age estimates for 80 test faces were collected before adaptation, and\nagain after adapting to a sequence of young, middle-aged or old faces. This provides a rich dataset,\nfrom which the perceptual change induced at any point along the age continuum, after each type of\nFacial age aftereffects provide some evidence for local\nrepulsion (but none for re-normalisation)\nadaptation, can in principle be measured. The authors argued that the changes in age ratings after\nadaptation were best described as a uniform shift in perceived age across all test faces, and therefore\nthat these data support norm-based theories of facial encoding.\nHowever, there are two issues related to this conclusion. First, and most importantly, the authors\npresented and analysed fits to their data from a regression model containing only a linear term. This\nstraight-line model well captures the predictions of a uniform re-normalisation (a shift in the intercept\nwith no change in slope), but it doesn't well capture the predictions of a local repulsion. The authors\nproposed that local repulsion should manifest as a change in both the intercept and the slope of the\nbest fitting line after adaptation, relative to baseline. This might reasonably describe shifts predicted\nby a very broadly tuned local repulsion, but since the tuning of any hypothetical local repulsion as a\nfunction of physical age is unknown, a linear model cannot comprehensively capture the local repul-\nsion hypothesis. The authors note that including higher order terms in the linear regression model\naccounted for negligible additional variance. However, models with such terms (e.g. quadratic or\ncubic functions) also fail to capture the local-repulsion hypothesis. Below I compare the linear fits\nin the original report to an alternative model--a first derivative of a Gaussian function--which well\ndescribes the locally repulsive aftereffect pattern found following adaptation to simpler spatial pat-\nterns, such as tilt and spatial frequency (e.g. Blakemore et al., 1970; Mitchell & Muir, 1976; Nemes\nSecond, it is unclear in the original report how well model fits capture aftereffect patterns, as the\nauthors performed regression on absolute age estimates for each test face after adaptation, as a func-\ntion of absolute age estimates for each test face before adaptation. Unsurprisingly, post-adaptation\nage ratings were highly correlated with pre-adaptation ratings. O'Neil et al. specify that physical\nage accounts for ~94% of the variance in all regressions involving post-adaptation age ratings, so\nonly minimal variance was left to be accounted for via the effects of adaptation. The linear model\nreported in O'Neil et al. explains ~98\u00ad99% of the variance in post-adaptation age ratings, but it is\nimportant also to know how well the model explains the relatively minor shifts in age ratings induced\nby adaptation.\nSince we are interested in the aftereffect pattern, it is more appropriate to analyse differences in\nestimated age for each test face before versus after adaptation. In Figure 1, I have re-expressed these\ndata (available in the Supplementary data file of O'Neil et al. (2014)) in terms of the shift in aver-\nage age estimate for each test face, as a function of the pre-adaptation average age estimate for that\nAdapt Adapt\nLocal repulsion Re-normalisation\nFigure 1. A schematic illustration of the predicted changes in perceived age after adapting to a moderately old\nface, if facial age aftereffects follow (left) a locally repulsive or (right) a re-normalising pattern. Before adaptation\n(blue curves), perceived age may match physical age. After adaptation (red curves), local repulsion predicts that\nthe apparent age of the adapting face will not change, but younger faces will look exaggeratedly young, and older\nfaces will look exaggeratedly old. Re-normalisation predicts that the adapting face and all other faces will appear\nyounger by approximately the same amount.\nface. I fit each dataset independently with a linear model (blue lines) and with a nonlinear Gaussian-\nderivative model (red curves), in Matlab.\nAcross all three datasets, neither model provided a good fit to aftereffect data (see Figure 2). For\naftereffects induced by adapting to Young faces, linear regression R2 = 0.008, explaining less than 1%\nof the variance in aftereffect data. Root mean squared error (RMSE) of both the linear and nonlinear\nmodels1 = 2.16 years. For Middle-Aged adaptation, model fits are again poor and similar: linear model\nels are not nested, it is not appropriate to compare them on the basis of an F-ratio.An alternative metric\nis the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) which provides unbiased estimates of goodness-of-fit for\nnonlinear models (Spiess & Neumayer, 2010) and contains a term to penalise more complex models.\nThe lowest BIC value indicates the model that fits the data best with the fewest parameters, and the\nmagnitude of the difference in BIC values between two models indicates the strength of evidence in\nfavour of one over the other. For the Young adaptation data, linear model BIC = 355 and nonlinear\nmodel BIC = 357. According to the conventions suggested by Raftery (1995), a difference in BIC of 2\nor less should not be considered evidence in favour of either model. For Middle-Aged adaptation, lin-\near model BIC = 403 and nonlinear model = 402 (again a negligible difference). For Old adaptation,\nlinear model BIC = 398, and nonlinear model BIC = 384. A BIC difference of >10 constitutes \"very\nstrong\" evidence (Raftery, 1995), here in favour of the nonlinear local-repulsion model.\nThis new analysis makes two points. First and foremost, the shifts in age ratings for each test face\nare highly variable, and neither model provides a good fit to the data. The best linear fit explains less\nthan 2% of the variance in aftereffect data for each test face. Second, if we were to attempt to compare\nthe two models, two of the three datasets provide no evidence in favour of either model, and in the\nthird, a Gaussian-derivative model (capturing a locally repulsive pattern of biases) provides a better fit\nto the aftereffect data than does a linear model (and is judged as superior using a metric which penal-\nises this model for having one more parameter than the linear model).\nThe source of the variability in the age aftereffect across test faces is unknown. One possibility\nis that different test faces interacted differently with the series of adapting faces; for example because\nsome test faces share many features with members of the adapting series while other test faces share\nfew features with the adaptors. Aftereffects along one facial dimension are known to be largest when\ntest and adapting stimuli are similar along other dimensions (Little, DeBruine, Jones, & Waitt, 2008).\nSuch exemplar-specific effects may arise either from interactions between local properties of the\nadapting and test images (Dickinson, Almeida, Bell, & Badcock, 2010), or from the overlap between\ntest and adapting faces in higher-level representations.\n1R2 does not have a clear interpretation for nonlinear models (see Spiess & Neumayer, 2010).\nFigure 2.

Aftereffect data were fitted with a linear model\n(blue lines) and a first derivative of a Gaussian function (red curves).

Where there is evidence for either hypothesis, they more strongly support the local-repul-\nsion hypothesis (and exemplar-based encoding), than re-normalisation (and norm-based encoding),\ncontrary to the title claim of O'Neil et al. (2014).\n"
