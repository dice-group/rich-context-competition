This potential can be realised through a wide\nset of processes--spanning policy formulation, regulation, and enforcement, at different\nspatial scales--but a constant thread is the opportunities that planning offers for bringing\nenvironmental knowledge to bear on decisions about development and land use. In the UK,\nfrom the early 1990s, the policy imperative of integrating sustainability into the planning\nsystem energised efforts to design methodologies for assessing and evaluating environmental\nresources and the impacts of decisions, which have provided important vehicles for integrating\nenvironmental knowledge into governance processes (Owens and Cowell, 2010; Rydin, 1995).\nThe international emergence of `an ecosystem assessment approach' or `ecosystem\nservices approach'(1) should thus be seen as the latest in a long line of attempts to ensure\nthat the `true value' of the environment is considered in decision making (Adelle et al, 2012;\nattempt to capture and make visible the processes through which natural ecosystems provide\nbenefits to human society (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005; UK NEA, 2011).\nProponents of ecosystem services approaches have considered how these methods connect\nwith policy making (ten Brink, 2011), and planning is considered to offer important venues\n(1)For simplicity, this paper refers to `an ecosystem services' approach from hereon.\nfor using such approaches, whether that be for `spatial planning of habitats' to help deliver\nThe question that drives this paper is to what extent might one expect ecosystems\nservices approaches to affect planning decisions? This is a tricky question. To date, there\nhas been relatively little explicit use of ecosystem services approaches in planning-related\nactivities and thus little direct evidence on which to draw (but see Campbell and Sheate,\n2012; McKenzie et al, 2014). It is also tricky because the distinctive features of `an ecosystem\nservices approach' are nebulous, residing in claims to offer a `comprehensive' or `holistic'\napproach to understanding the various ways that ecosystems support human well-being\n(see discussion in Braat and de Groot, 2012). More fundamentally, what makes for `better\nuse of environmental knowledge' is subject to multiple interpretations (Haines-Young and\nbroad conceptions of `better use' at work: one appeals to technocratic rationality, that good\ndecisions require the `best possible information'; the other rationale, more overtly normative,\nis that achieving sustainability requires greater weight to be placed on environmental factors.\nAdvocates of ecosystem services typically span these rationales--for example, in claiming\nthat \"Valuing (natural resources) properly will enable better decision making\" (UK NEA,\n2011, page 4) and that \"the natural world\" is \"consistently undervalued in conventional\neconomic analyses and decision making\" (page 5, emphasis added).\nOur first broad argument is that there are lessons that can be drawn from prior efforts to\nintroduce new assessment frameworks into planning, which may be helpful in understanding\nthe likely takeup and effects of ecosystem services approaches (see also Turnpenny et al,\n2014; Wilkinson et al, 2013). But to talk of lessons immediately raises questions about the\ncausal theories that are used to explain the relationship between (environmental) knowledge\nand decisions. Proponents of ecosystems services approaches have given much attention to\nimproving the mapping, modeling, and quantifying of ecosystem services (TEEB, 2010),\nthus echoing persistent linear\u00adrational models of knowledge utilisation, in which the\nsolution to inadequate influence on decisions is to generate `better knowledge', achieved\nvia methodological improvements. However, as numerous commentators have noted (Adelle\net al, 2012; Owens et al, 2004), linear\u00adrational models embody a poor explanation of how\nknowledge actually affects decisions, thus offering partial lessons for institutional design.\nThis leads to our second argument, which is that addressing the leverage question--\nunderstanding how, why, and in what circumstances environmental knowledge comes to exert\nleverage over business as usual (see also Owens, 2012)--requires a theoretical framework\nwith a more reflexive engagement between techniques for environmental assessment and the\nsocial and institutional contexts in which they are used (see Adelle et al, 2012; Carmona and\nSieh, 2008; Rydin, 2010). We make a case for using concepts from science and technology\nstudies to dissect how particular approaches to the production of environmental knowledge\nbecome bound into actions--a process in which the `internal' qualities of knowledge are but\none element of processes that also bring together an array of `external' factors. To a degree,\nthe designers of ecosystem services approaches have been alert to social dimensions of the\nproductionofenvironmentalknowledge,insofarasmethodologiesseektoincorporateaplurality\nof values and appeal to transparent, collaborative decision making (UK NEA, 2011, page 14; see\nalso Braat and de Groot, 2012). However, the desire for more open and/or deliberative modes\nof assessment raises a host of problems (Lo, 2011; Rauschmayer et al, 2009), and it is unclear\nhow far such modes help the resulting knowledge gain traction in actual decision-making\nUtilisation of environmental knowledge in land-use planning 265\nOur approach is to conduct a meta-analysis of three other assessment frameworks, each of\nwhich illuminates how environmental knowledge becomes (or fails to become) influential in\nlocal planning processes. The case studies are the use of `environmental capital' frameworks\nin minerals planning in South East England; ecological footprinting in Cardiff, Wales; and\nthe emergence of green infrastructure (GI) in the Republic of Ireland.(2) Each focuses mostly\non ex ante assessment,(3) and working definitions of each assessment approach are given\nin table 1. The case studies are useful analogues to the situation facing ecosystem services\napproaches in many policy systems. Firstly, as ecosystem services, each assessment approach\nwas relatively novel during the period each case study took place, enabling examination of\nhow a technique of previously uncertain status acquires significance. Secondly, the three\ncases can highlight the array of factors that affect the relationship between environmental\nknowledges and decision making, especially in the institutional contexts of planning. In\nparticular, each enables us to observe the effects of stakeholder engagement practices in\nthe initial stages of methodology adoption. Thirdly, ecosystem services approaches share\nwith the cases analysed a broadly instrumental, economistic language of environmental\nvalue (Rauschmayer et al, 2009; Stibbe, 2012).(4) Each treats the environment as `capital',\n`capacities', or `infrastructure' that provides services to humans. Examining the fate of these\nThe methodological basis of the analysis is as follows. For the Berkshire case study data were\nobtained primarily from documents produced for the draft replacement local mineral plan inquiry and\nobservation of the inquiry itself as policy matters were discussed. The case study is written up more\nfully in Cowell and Owens (1997), Cowell and Owens (1998), and chapter 7 of Owens and Cowell\n(2010). For the Cardiff case study data were derived from documents produced by Cardiff Council,\nfor the production of the ecological footprint (EF) but also wider strategic documents, as well as\nsemistructured interviews with fifteen council officers and elected members. The case study is written\nup most fully in Collins et al (2009). For the Republic of Ireland case study the analysis of GI comes\nfrom unpublished PhD research (Lennon, 2013) and is based on fifty-two interviews with an array of\nofficers in planning, environmental protection, and other sectors conducted between 2009 and 2011,\nThat is, assessment to inform decisions not yet formally taken, although each approach could be\nused in the ex post monitoring of outcomes.\nAlthough the language evokes economistic and human\u00adinstrumental values, operationalising these\nassessment frameworks can accommodate a wider array of values. Environmental capital frameworks\ndo not preclude that certain environmental features should be treated as `critical environmental capital'\nfor the aesthetic or intrinsic values of nature (see discussion in Owens and Cowell, 2010).
