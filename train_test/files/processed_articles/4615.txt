    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study aims to explore frail older adults' perceptions of what influences their exercise behaviors. A qualitative descriptive\ndesign was used. Semi-structured, open-ended interviews were conducted with 29 frail older adults. Thematic content\nanalysis established the findings. Frail older adults perceive exercise as a by-product of other purposeful activities such as\nmanual work or social activities. Progression into frailty appears to be associated with a decline in non-family support, changing\ntraditional roles within family support networks, and lower baseline activity levels. Frail older adults perceive exercise as\nincidental to more purposeful activities rather than an endpoint in itself. Therefore, exercise programs concentrating on\nfunctional outcomes may be more relevant for this population. Strategies that educate and promote social support networks\nmay also benefit frail older adults.\n",

However,\nthe implementation of these programs is difficult as regular\ninvolvement in exercise or physical activity decreases with\nage (Schoenborn, Adams, Barnes, Vickerie, & Schiller,\n2004), and long-term adherence to exercise interventions is\npoor in spite of the associated benefits (Bestall et al., 2003).\nSocial support, self-efficacy beliefs, and outcome expec-\ntations have been identified as influencing exercise in non-\nfrail, community-dwelling older adults (Baert, Gorus, Mets,\nMathews et al., 2010; Warner, Ziegelmann, Schuz, Wurm, &\nSchwarzer, 2011). Other factors include health status, beliefs\nexercise history (Hirvensalo, Lintunen, & Rantanen, 2008;\nKozakai, Ando, Kim, Rantanen, & Shimokata, 2012), and\ncultural beliefs (Leavy & Aberg, 2010; Mathews et al.,\n2010). Social support and self-efficacy are two of the princi-\npal determinants to exercise cited by community-dwelling\nolder adults (de Groot & Fagerstrom, 2011; Mathews et al.,\nadequate social support are less likely to exercise and as a\nconsequence have a higher risk of mortality (Bailey &\nSocial support may be derived from a number of sources\nincluding family, friends, peers, or health professionals\n(Resnick, Orwig, Magaziner, & Wynne, 2002). Family and\nfriend-based support increases the likelihood of regular par-\nticipation in exercise (Umstattd, Saunders, Wilcox, Valois, &\nDowda, 2006). However, in group exercise interventions,\npeer support may have a higher influence on continued par-\nticipation than family support alone (Stevens, Lemmink, van\nfound that high self-efficacy and the support of friends had a\nsignificant impact on the likelihood of changing exercise\nbehavior in older adults with multiple co-morbidities. Social\nsupport offered from friends may have a more substantial\ninfluence on exercise behavior than family support (Resnick\net al., 2002).

Hence, social support networks based on friends appear\nto be more important in promoting exercise in older adults\nthan family supports alone.\nSelf-efficacy and outcome expectations are both compo-\nnents of Social Cognitive Theory (Courtney et al., 2009;\nHall, W\u00f3jcicki, Phillips, & McAuley, 2012). Self-efficacy\nrefers to one's belief in one's ability to successfully carry out\na specific behavior (Bandura, 1997). It has been identified as\nan important factor in motivating older adults to exercise\n(Schutzer & Graves, 2004). Outcome expectations refer to\none's belief that a planned goal will be achieved from com-\npleting a personal action (Hall et al., 2012). The relationship\nbetween outcome expectations and self-efficacy has not been\noutcome expectations have been relatively unexplored in the\nliterature (Hall et al., 2012). However, it has been argued that\nself-efficacy and outcome expectations are closely linked as\nboth impact initiation and participation in exercise interven-\ntions (Resnick et al., 2007). Hence, outcome expectations\nmay also serve as an indication of exercise behavior and the\nlikelihood of changing that behavior toward positive\noutcomes.\nHowever, these studies have not specifically targeted frail\nolder adults, instead investigating a non-specific older\ncohort, or focusing on the \"oldest old.\" This article therefore\naims to explore what influences frail, community-dwelling\nolder adults to exercise.\nMethod\nA qualitative descriptive design was used for this study.\nQualitative research is informed by interpretivism, which\nseeks to explore how people understand and experience\nsocial phenomena (Carpenter & Suto, 2008). When employ-\ning this approach, the researcher must seek to explore the\nmeaning attributed to phenomena by the participants and\nthemselves (Ritchie & Lewis, 2003). This approach was cho-\nsen to allow the author to explore the participants' attitudes\nand beliefs regarding exercise to gain an understanding of\nwhat influenced their exercise behaviors.\nSample Recruitment\nThis study was nested in a larger control trial (CT) examin-\ning the effects of an exercise intervention on frail older adults\nin the acute setting conducted from July to September 2011\n(McCullagh et al., 2012). Consecutive sampling was\nemployed to recruit all participants admitted to the CT.\nInclusion criteria consisted of frail or pre-frail older adults\nunder terms described by McCullagh et al. (2014). Exclusion\ncriteria included early discharge, defined as within 3 days or\nless of admission, and transfer to palliative care services.\nEarly discharge was an exclusion criterion to ensure\nparticipants had been screened as frail or pre-frail before the\ninterviews were conducted. Cognitive impairment was not\nan exclusion criterion as those with cognitive impairment are\nstill able to provide us with their insights and perceptions of\nexercise. Thus, it can be argued that excluding those indi-\nviduals on the basis of impairment alone is unethical\n(Hellstr\u00f6m, Nolan, Nordenfelt, & Lundh, 2007). However,\none eligible participant was excluded as her level of impair-\nment rendered her unable to effectively communicate at the\ntime of recruitment. Ethical approval was granted by the\nregional clinical research ethics committee. Verbal consent\nwas requested. In addition, consent was viewed as a process\nwhereby attention was given to any verbal or non-verbal\nindications during data collection that a participant seemed\nunwilling to take part in the interview.\nOut of a potential 40 participants recruited to the CT, 29\nwere interviewed. Those not interviewed were discharged at\nweekends or at short notice such that the interview could not\ntake place prior to discharge home from hospital. None\nrefused to participate. Fifty-five percent of those interviewed\nwere women. The median age was 78 years with a range of\nData Collection\nAll participants were interviewed in private at the bedside.\nOne participant requested that his spouse be present for the\ninterview. The spouse observed but did not participate in the\nprocess. The average length of stay (LOS) prior to being\nAtotal of 29 semi-structured, open-ended interviews were\nconducted. A preliminary literature search and review was\ncompleted to inform the development of the interview sched-\nules (see Appendix). Each participant was asked how he or\nshe chose to exercise in a typical day at home and about any\nlimiting or motivating factors he or she experienced. Each\nparticipant was asked to describe outcome expectations he or\nshe may have had, and about the presence of social supports.\nThree interviews were concluded early, 2 due to illness or\ninability to continue and 1 due to the participant declining to\ncontinue.\nData Analysis\nThe interviews were transcribed verbatim and the transcripts\nwere studied carefully in the context of the recorded inter-\nviews. Data analysis was carried out using thematic content\nanalysis. This was based on a five-stage analytical method\ndescribed in the literature (Flick, Von Kardoff, & Steinke,\nstages were\n1. Familiarization and identification of key themes;\n2. Creating a \"thematic framework\" (Ritchie & Lewis,\nBroderick et al. 3\n3. Coding;\n4. Sorting data;\n5. Summarizing or synthesizing data.\nData analysis was facilitated by computer-assisted quali-\ntative data analysis software (CAQDAS) using QSR\nInternational's NVivo 9 qualitative data analysis software.\nFindings\nResearch analysis identified three key themes: perceptions of\nexercise, personal agency, and social support. One other\ntheme comprising of a number of historical influences,\nincluding the impact of emigration and technology on exer-\ncise behaviors in this cohort, was also identified.\nPerceptions of Exercise\nPerceptions of exercise were shaped by three key themes.\nHow they defined and described exercise in terms of their\nprevious and current exercise behaviors, and their percep-\ntions of their own exercise levels are all presented below to\ngive an overview of their beliefs regarding exercise.\nExercise history.When describing how they exercised as\nyoung adults, participants classified exercise as a relatively\nvigorous activity. Manual labor, playing sport, or dancing\nwere common examples of exercise. However, the majority\nof those interviewed did not recall being active solely for the\npurpose of exercise. Rather, they happened to be exercising\nwhile doing activities that were seen as either necessary or\nfun:\nOh my god girl we never stopped dancing . . . we never stopped\non our bikes. Out to [place name], down to [place name] every\nSunday. And we worked 6 days a week in the [company name]\nfrom 8 in the morning until 6 at night. (Participant 15)\nWhen participants began to discuss their exercise behavior in\nlater years, there was a move to describing less strenuous activi-\nties such as housework or gardening. Although the intensity of\nthe exercise had changed, the majority of participants continued\nto see it as incidental to other, necessary forms of activity.\nIn addition, participants described walking as a common\nform of exercise in later life. Walking was the exercise most\ncommonly cited by this group, which was undertaken for the\nspecific purpose of exercising, as opposed to playing sports,\nwhich had more of a social component:\nParticipant (P):I have a walker. I'd walk about 10 yards\nanyway.\nInterviewer (I): Would you?\n P:\nI do 10 yards anyway between the\nhouse and the garden at home.\nCurrent exercise behaviors.Accounts of exercise progressed\nto describing current exercise behavior in terms of everyday\nactivities such as activities of daily living (ADLs), light\nhousework, gardening, or socializing:\nWell I take it as exercise if I make the breakfast and I do a bit of\nironing and when the weather is good I'd do a bit of gardening.\n(Participant 1)\nNo participant described ADLs as a form of exercise\nwhen referring to their earlier years. These data indicate that\nparticipants changed their perceptions of what constituted\nexercise in line with their changed functional ability. The\ndata also indicate that this group of frail older adults largely\ndid not purposefully set out to exercise; they instead chose to\ndescribe exercise as a consequence of other, more purposeful\nactivities.\nWhile 27 participants described themselves as participat-\ning in some form of daily exercise, only 6 described them-\nselves as being active. Of the remaining group, 10 stated they\nwere not active enough. Although the data did not reveal any\nobvious association between beliefs regarding exercise and\nperceived participation, individuals who felt they were inac-\ntive were less likely to describe walking as part of their daily\nroutine. In contrast, those who described themselves as\nactive all reported regularly walking outdoors. The data\nimplied that an ability to participate in outdoor activities may\nbe associated with a greater confidence in one's own exercise\ncapability. It also indicated that walking is heavily associated\nwith perceiving oneself as active:\nI'd get up in the morning and I was very independent. I was able\nto have a shower . . . And I'd, I'd walk around, walk around. I\nhaven't dementia now or anything, only a bungalow. I'd walk\naround the house and I'd go up and I'd open the gates.\nThus, exercise was largely defined in terms of everyday\nactivities including ADLs, gardening, and housework, as\nwell as more vigorous activities for some, such as walking\nand cycling. Exercise appeared to be a by-product of other\nmore meaningful activities. This perception of exercise\nreflected participants' experiences as they reminisced about\ntheir earlier lives.\nStructured exercise programs. Previous participation within a\nplanned or structured exercise program appears to have\ninfluenced current perceptions of exercise. For example,\nthree participants who had previously partaken in some kind\nof rehabilitation or exercise-based therapy chose to define\nexercise within those terms:\nI do try to do my small lot of breathing exercises you know like\nthe puffs now and all that like. And I'd do the push-ups . . . I\ndone the rehabilitation course there across the road and I loved\nit. (Participant 12)\n4 SAGE Open\nThose who had participated in these programs also\ndefined outcome expectations in terms of recovery while\npersonal expectations were positive but qualified. Those who\nhad participated in rehabilitation used physiotherapy and\nexercise as interchangeable terms. One participant, on being\nasked about exercise outcomes, replied,\nWell if you do physiotherapy now or running or something like\nthat you know that you, you get some bit done. (Participant 8)\nThe data indicated strong positive perceptions regarding\nexercise when involved in a planned program.\nOther forms of participation in structured exercise activi-\nties included those who had previously been in the military\nservice or who had been involved in sports. However, three\nparticipants who had taken part in such activities when\nyounger, and who described themselves as having a high\nlevel of physical fitness at the time, had a negative percep-\ntion of their current level of activity. For example, two male\nparticipants, who were formerly in the army, described exer-\ncise primarily in terms of vigorous activities. Both found it\ndifficult to describe themselves as exercising currently when\ncompared with their previous activity levels. One partici-\npant, on being asked what exercise he did at home, replied,\nNothing only . . . all I was doing was smoking . . . Just lazy. Loss\nof thought. I used to do it like. I used to be fit. I was fit. I got very\nlazy though. (Participant 23)\nPersonal Agency\nPersonal agency refers to one's ability to make choices,\nestablish goals, and plan one's actions (McAdams & Olson,\n2010). Three subthemes identified in the findings that influ-\nenced personal agency included perceived motivators, out-\ncome expectations, and perceived barriers. Social support\nwas also a strong theme identified; this is presented in the\nfollowing section.\nPerceived motivators. The desire to be independent and not be\na \"burden\" on family members was a prominent motivating\nfactor for this group. Participants expressed fear and anxiety\nwhen describing potentially losing their independence. One\nparticipant when speaking of her sister who had been con-\nfined to a wheelchair for a number of years stated,\nMy god I'd never do that. I'd never, I'd crack up and you know\neveryone says to me \"you know if you had to do it you would\n'cause you wouldn't be able to.\" Oh but 'twould . . . so I have to\nkeep walking. I have to keep walking. (Participant 6)\nA sense of enjoyment was also identified as a strong moti-\nvating factor. Exercise, particularly in the contexts described\nabove, was associated with a sense of personal achievement\nand fulfillment. Outdoor activities such as walking or\ngardening were also described by participants as something\nthey enjoyed:\nI walk. People say would you not get a taxi and I laugh at them.\nWould you not get a lift and I say \"It's too organized to get a lift.\"\n. . .You walk and you see everything and you're in communication\nwith people. You're feeling better. (Participant 27)\nOutcome expectations. All but one participant believed exer-\ncise had some positive outcomes for the general population.\nNo participant associated exercise with negative outcomes\nalthough one believed that exercise had no outcomes at all.\nSeventeen participants believed that exercise had, or poten-\ntially could have, a positive impact on their own lives.\nBroadly, those outcomes were classified into three catego-\nries: physical, social, and mental.\nPhysical outcomes were described in terms of weight con-\ntrol, improved circulation, reduced pain, and as \"good for\njoints\" and general fitness. Maintenance was the most com-\nmon outcome described with participants using expressions\nlike \"keeps you going,\" \"stops you slowing down,\" and\n\"keeps you alive.\" Those who had previously taken part in\nrehabilitation strongly associated exercise with recovery.\nRegular participation in exercise was also associated with\npositive social outcomes. Exercise was seen to promote con-\nfidence and social skills, and to prevent negative social influ-\nences, particularly for younger adults:\nI vote for people taking up sports and staying away from them\nbloody pubs and drugs and everything like that like. (Participant 12)\nHowever, participants did not see themselves as benefit-\ning socially from exercise. This may be related to the avail-\nability of social support to this group, findings on which are\npresented in further detail below.\nFinally, exercise was seen as having a positive impact on\nmental health through mood and cognition although this was\nnot as widely identified as the two previous outcomes. The\nparticipants who described this outcome commonly associ-\nated increased physical activity with maintaining an \"active\nmind\"; two participants specifically related this to prevent-\ning dementia. Improved mood was also seen as an outcome,\nwhich they associated with improved mental health:\n'Twould lift your spirits in the first place to have to get up to\nhave something to do . . . [If] you're sitting down in the corner,\nas the one says twiddling your thumbs all day, sure wouldn't you\ngo crazy? (Participant 7)\nYet despite the majority of participants associating posi-\ntive outcomes with exercise, eight participants believed that\nit no longer had any effect on them personally due to their\nage, medical condition, or current level of ability. Social,\nmental, and physical outcomes were no longer seen as\nachievable due to these perceived barriers to exercise.\nBroderick et al. 5\nPerceived barriers. Medical condition, fear of falling, family,\nsocial isolation, self-consciousness, age, limited ability, and\nenvironment were the most common barriers to exercise\ncited by participants. Every participant interviewed cited at\nleast one barrier, yet only eight participants referred to these\nbarriers as having a negative impact on their outcome\nexpectations.\nIn total, seven participants described age as a barrier to\nexercise. Five participants, aged between 79 and 85 years,\ndescribed their age as limiting their outcome expectations.\nThese participants all associated exercise with positive out-\ncomes but believed those outcomes were limited to younger\npeople\nP:\nIt's (exercise) a good idea for younger people.\nI:What about people your own age?\nP:We're gone beyond it. (Participant 11)\nAge was also described as limiting one's ability to engage\nin exercise. The phrase, \"at my age,\" was used by five par-\nticipants to qualify their responses when describing how they\nexercised. As commented by one participant,\nAt my age now I can't rush, so I have my own pace.\nSixteen participants cited a medical condition as a barrier\nto exercise. Fifteen of those described it as a long-standing\nchronic condition. Only 5 described themselves as experi-\nencing an acute event or exacerbation of symptoms at the\ntime of being interviewed. Pain, fatigue, arthritis, and short-\nness of breath were the most commonly cited physical barri-\ners by this group.\nInterestingly, given the frail nature of this population, fear\nwas described as a barrier to exercise by only three partici-\npants. Fears of falling or of becoming acutely unwell as a\nresult of over-exercising were expressed. These fears had the\npotential to act as a strong barrier with one participant\nstating,\nI'm scared of my life. (Participant 24)\nFear was also closely linked to experiencing embarrass-\nment in social situations by two participants, creating an\nadditional barrier. Embarrassment and fear were both\ndescribed as a strong barrier to enjoyment of exercise and\nother activities. As a result, participants felt isolated and\nunable to participate in their normal activities:\nI went to a funeral there now . . . I could hear all the men. \"God\nisn't she after getting very stiff. I never knew she was that stiff\"\n. . . I felt like a specimen like you know . . . Well it stops me\ngoing out enjoying myself. (Participant 3)\nEnvironment was described as a barrier by four partici-\npants. External limitations such as steep hills, steps without\nrailings, and heavy traffic were all described as preventing\nparticipants from exercising. However, environmental limi-\ntations also existed within the home. In one case, the move to\nsheltered housing was associated with a reduction in exer-\ncise. Other participants described themselves as being lim-\nited to an area of the house, such as downstairs, giving them\ninsufficient room to exercise.\nSocial Support\nA prominent finding from the data was that social support\nseemed more influential on exercise behavior than any other\nexternal factor. Participants described two types of social\nsupport as predominant pre-admission: family support and\nnon-family peer support.\nFamily support. The data showed that family was the predom-\ninant source of social support for this group. Exercise and\nother activities were often described by participants as being\nconducted in conjunction with family members, rather than\nas an independent activity. Seventeen participants cited their\nfamily members as motivating them to exercise. This moti-\nvation could stem from a family member directly advising or\nasking them to exercise:\nMy wife never stops us going. She's always saying get yourself\nout. (Participant 9)\nOthers reported more indirect family support or involve-\nment in exercise. For example, one participant took up\nusing light weights after teaching his grandson how to use\nthem:\nEvery second day I'd do it [lift weights] . . . he was home I was\nwatching him and I told him he was wrong and I showed him\nwhat to do. (Participant 22)\nHowever, the influence of family was a complex factor.\nFive participants who had described their family as motivat-\ning them also reported them as a barrier to exercise. Primarily\nfamily members appeared to limit exercise behavior by\nactively discouraging participation in the household routine.\nThree women interviewed complained about family mem-\nbers usurping their role by taking over tasks that they saw as\ntheir own:\nHe [husband] took over when he retired . . . and I let him. I say I\nhave to get the kitchen back you know. (Participant 6)\nFor some participants, family members explicitly discour-\naged them from exercising, which they attributed to a wish to\nprotect or look after them. However, those who felt they\nwere being directly prevented, as opposed to being simply\ndiscouraged from exercising, were likely to express anger or\nfrustration:\n6 SAGE Open\nI went out to the shop and she [daughter] was coming in. And\nsays she . . . \"What do you want in the shop I'll get it\" and I was\nhalfway. Says I, \"will you get away from me.\" I wanted to do it\nmeself like. (Participant 15)\nNon-family support. Non-family supports consisted of friends\nor peer groups. Four participants reported feeling isolated or\nlonely when at home. Thirteen participants described them-\nselves as no longer having access to friends or other non-\nfamily peer groups and hence not being able to engage\nsocially with others. These participants expressed a lack of\nsocial engagement despite the presence of family support.\nFive participants identified the lack of available support\nfrom friends as a barrier to exercise. Inability to meet friends\ndue to lack of transport or medical issues was cited by some\nparticipants; however, the main cause identified was the\ndeath of friends. As one participant stated,\nI've sort of no friends like. I've buried most of them. (Participant 3)\nTwo participants described themselves as having limited\naccess to a social group, with one attending a senior citizens\ngroup and the other attending a local activity group regularly\npre-admission. However, in both cases attendance was\ndependant on a family member.\nThus, although family support was widely available, this\ngroup's limited access to friend or peer group\u00adbased social\nnetworks may have acted as an additional barrier to\nexercise.\nHistorical Influences\nThe participants' exercise behaviors were influenced by a\nnumber of factors throughout their lifetime. Their back-\nground, gender, emigration history and exposure to tech-\nnology all had an impact on their exercise history, and\ninfluenced changes in exercise behaviors throughout their\nlifetime.\nRural versus urban dwelling.Participant data suggested that\nthere were differences in early life exercise behaviors\nbetween urban and rural dwellers. Participants who were\nrural dwellers described exercise in their early lives mainly\nin terms of work and walking. In particular, rural dwelling\nwomen strongly associated exercise and physical activity\nwith workload:\nI did everything from working hard to . . . I'd do anything. I\nmean I could go out and I could turn sods and I could do the\ngarden and set potatoes and I could split blocks and I could cut\nthem with a saw. (Participant 14)\nAlthough urban dwellers also described exercise in these\nterms, they were more likely to include social activities such\nas dancing and participation in sports as exercise:\nWe played . . . oh loved tennis and camogie and you know when\nI was [a] youngster. (Participant 6)\nFamily life. The findings indicate that participants perceived\ntransitions in family life, in particular assuming the role of\ncarer, as having some impact on their exercise behaviors. For\nexample, the transition into parenthood was mentioned by\nboth sexes. The data showed that this change had a strong\ninfluence on women's perceived exercise behaviors. How-\never, it did not appear to affect the majority of the male\nparticipants.\nSome of the women interviewed, in particular those\nwho had worked outside the home, associated the birth of\ntheir children with a reduction in exercise. This appeared\nto be as a result of giving up work to stay at home and the\nsubsequent reduced social participation that some\ndescribed:\nAh 45 years ago I gave it [work] up after my daughter was born.\n(Participant 6)\nHowever, women who worked in the home were more\nlikely to perceive having children as increasing their work-\nload and hence their exercise levels:\nI was a farmer's wife 60 years, over 60 years and I'll tell you . .\n. That was my day and I had eight in family . . . I hadn't much\ntime for hanging about I tell you this much. (Participant 7)\nAs children grew older and moved away, both groups\nassociated this shift with a reduction in activity.\nWomen were also more likely to describe later life transi-\ntions, such as caring for a spouse, as affecting on their exer-\ncise levels. This also appeared to be associated with a\nperceived increase in workload and hence exercise.\nEmigration and technology.Urban and rural dwellers were\nboth likely to describe the impact of emigration as a negative\nfactor on their physical activity. Participants who emigrated\ndescribed a notable decline or end to their participation in\nsports or other activities:\n'Twas always dogs nearly but I was in England for 38 years . . .\nI went to England then and there's no hunting or fishing over\nthere then. (Participant 20)\nThe advent of more modern technologies such as farm\nmachinery or the introduction of the car was viewed as hav-\ning a negative impact on exercise levels. Although both\nurban and rural dwelling participants noted this impact, it\nwas rural dwellers in particular who associated the introduc-\ntion of machinery with a gradual decline in their own activity\nlevels. Considering that rural dwelling participants in par-\nticular associated exercise and manual labor so strongly, it is\nnot surprising that a reduction in workload related to a\ndecline in activity:\nBroderick et al. 7\nWell the hard work was . . . was eh . . . 'Twas gone like. There\nwas all machinery and everything came in then. So that was the\nend of the hard work. (Participant 26)\nDiscussion\nThe findings of this study indicate that frail, community-\ndwelling older adults perceive exercise as an important activ-\nity with potentially positive outcomes. Yet, their descriptions\nof their own exercise behaviors indicated that exercise was\ntraditionally perceived as an incidental outcome rather than\nprioritized as a health-related activity. All participants\nshowed a strong lifelong association between workload and\nexercise. Changes in workload led to perceived changes in\nexercise levels at multiple stages throughout life. This asso-\nciation was upheld through periods of change or major life\nevents, such as emigration, entering parenthood, caring for a\nspouse, or getting their first car. Other activities that would\nappear more exercise oriented, sports for example, had other\nmore purposeful outcomes such as socializing. This implies\nthat this cohort viewed exercise primarily as an outcome of a\npurposeful activity.\nThese perceptions influenced current exercise behaviors\nthat were still based strongly on workload. In line with\nBandura's (1997) hypothesis that people change their exer-\ncise behaviors as their functional abilities decline, changing\nlevels of ability led participants to change their descriptions\nof exercise. However, these descriptions remained heavily\nbased on function. When describing exercise in later life,\nparticipants also placed a greater emphasis on the importance\nof walking and being able to spend time outdoors. The data\nsuggest that these activities were associated with a greater\nconfidence in their own exercise capabilities.\nThese findings support other data that suggest that older\nadults place a high value on functional independence (Melillo\net al., 1996). However, this is the first study to examine frail\nolder adults' exercise history and how it relates to their cur-\nrent perceptions of exercise. The finding that this cohort\nview exercise as an outcome of other purposeful activities\nindicates that programs targeting this cohort may benefit\nfrom using functionally based exercises or exercises with a\nclear functional goal.\nThose who had previously participated in structured\nexercise or rehabilitation programs defined exercise and its\noutcomes within those terms. The data indicated strong\npositive perceptions of exercise undertaken in these pro-\ngrams. This is supported by other research, which indicates\nthat education and positive experiences of exercise in a\nrecovery setting has a positive impact on exercise beliefs\n(Hurley, Walsh, Bhavnani, Britten, & Stevenson, 2010).\nThese strong associations appear to have been associated\nwith the positive physical outcomes achieved during these\nprograms. However, they may have been perceived as such\ndue to the positive functional outcomes associated with\nrehabilitation programs. Research has also found that\nparticipants in rehabilitation-based programs place a value\non the educational component of rehabilitation (Hurley et\nal., 2010). Therefore, while structured exercise programs\nhave the potential to influence exercise beliefs and hence\nbehaviors in this population, there is a need to establish\nwhat components of structured rehabilitation programs spe-\ncifically affect these outcomes.\nPerceived motivators expressed by this group included\npositive outcome expectations, personal enjoyment, and a\nwish to remain independent. Positive outcome expectations\nincluded weight control, improved circulation, reduced pain,\nimproved mood, and increasing and maintaining physical fit-\nness. Perceived barriers expressed by those interviewed\nincluded lack of social support, presence of an underlying\nmedical condition, fear, self-consciousness, age, environ-\nment, and limited ability. These findings are largely in line\nwith studies of community-dwelling, non-frail, older adults\nHowever, the perception of family support as a potential bar-\nrier to exercise has not been raised in previous research. In\naddition, the lack of non-family social support networks\navailable to this population appear to be more accentuated in\nthis study than in previous studies of non-frail older adults.\nIn this study, family was the most available form of social\nsupport. This suggests onset of frailty is associated with an\nincreased dependence on family support. This is supported\nby Drennan et al.'s (2008) finding that older adults who have\nexperienced a decline in health are more likely to be depen-\ndent on their families for social support. However, family\nsupport may limit as well as motivate frail older adults. In\nthis study, some participants appeared to be excluded from\nactivities they would have traditionally done, such as house-\nwork, and sometimes actively discouraged from exercising\nin an effort to protect them. For this group, who perceive\nsuch a close association between work and exercise, this\nmarginalization appeared not only to reduce exercise levels\nbut also to have an emotional impact. Some participants felt\nthey no longer had a purpose within the home, leading them\nto feel unhappy or frustrated. This indicates that there may be\na need for family members, acting as carers to frail older\nadults, to be educated on the importance of exercise and\nmaintaining functional independence for this group.\nAlthough family support seemed an important positive\ninfluencing factor, previous research points to social support\nnetworks involving friends and peers as being the most effec-\ntive in promoting exercise and other health behaviors in\net al., 2011). In the present study, only three participants\nreported having access to support from friends or peers. This\ncontrast to previous research, which has not specifically\nfocused on frail older adults, suggests that older adult's non-\nfamily social networks decline because of frailty. Thus, any\nintervention to promote exercise behaviors in frail older\nadults should also examine the potential for creating social\nsupport networks in their communities.\n8 SAGE Open\nPotential Limitations and Strengths\nThis study had both limitations and strengths. As the author of\nthis study is a physiotherapist who specializes in working with\nolder adults, there is an assumption that the author's knowl-\nedge, beliefs, and experience will have had some impact on the\nfindings. However, the author endeavored to take a reflexive\napproach to the research by recognizing her own beliefs and\nbiases about frailty and exercise at an early stage, and reflecting\non them throughout the research process. By acknowledging\nbeliefs in this way, an author can be more receptive to the\nresearch and limit the influence of his or her own preconcep-\ntions (Jootun, McGhee, & Marland, 2009). This approach was\ntaken to promote the rigor of the research. Rigor in qualitative\nresearch helps to ensure the findings are reliable, credible, and\nvalid (Nicholls, 2009). In addition, the author did not work in\nthe hospital where the interviews took place and was not known\nto be a physiotherapist by the participants.\nAnother potential issue was that the participants were\ninterviewed about their exercise behaviors at home while in\nhospital. In addition, some had already participated in the\nintervention group, which may have had some impact on\ntheir pre-existing perceptions of exercise. However, the aver-\nage LOS prior to interviews was 9.45 days and recall was\nlikely to be relatively accurate. The potential for bias here\nwas also acknowledged during data collection and analysis,\nand the author was careful to delineate between pre- and\npost-intervention views during the interviews.\nNotwithstanding these aspects, the findings of this study\nare important as they provide insights into the exercise behav-\niors of frail older adults. To the author's knowledge, this is the\nonly study to examine perceptions of exercise specifically in\nthis cohort. The findings have revealed how the progression\nof frailty, the impact of changing social supports, and varying\nperceptions of exercise may affect exercise behavior. It has\nhighlighted previously unexplored areas including the poten-\ntial limitations imposed by family support.\nConclusion\nHealth professionals planning interventions to promote or\nmaintain exercise in frail older adults should be aware of the\ncomplex nature of factors that influence exercise in this pop-\nulation. Frail older adults strongly associate exercise with\nworkload and other functional activities. This perception has\nexisted throughout their lifetime. However, those who have\nparticipated in structured rehabilitation programs instead\nassociate exercise primarily with positive physical outcomes.\nMotivators and barriers to exercise in this study were found\nto be similar to those experienced by non-frail older adults\nfrom previous research. However, frailty is associated with a\ndecline in non-family support networks. Family-based sup-\nport is a positive influence, yet it may lead to a change in\ntraditional roles within the family and consequently act as a\nbarrier to exercise.\nThus, any program targeting frail older adults' exercise\nbehaviors should take a multifaceted approach. Programs\nthat concentrate on functional outcomes may be more rele-\nvant for this population. Family members in a caring role\nmay benefit from education regarding exercise behaviors.\nCommunity-based strategies that promote social support net-\nworks may also benefit this group.\nAppendix\nInterview Schedule\nI would like to ask you a few questions about how active you\nare in general.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Exercise can be lots of things including walking (and\nother appropriate example).
