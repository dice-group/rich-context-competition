The analy-\nses statistically controlled for measured characteristics\nof the mothers and families and exposure to other pre-\nnatal psychoactive substances. In the primary analyses,\nsiblings differentially exposed to prenatal alcohol were\ncompared.\nSetting and Participants: Women were recruited from\nthe community using a stratified and clustered probabil-\nity sample and were followed longitudinally. The sample\nMain Outcome Measures: Maternal report of con-\nduct problems (CPs) and attention/impulsivity prob-\nlems (AIPs) during childhood (ages 4-11 years) using stan-\ndardized assessments related to psychiatric diagnoses.\nResults: There was an association between PAE and off-\nspring CPs that was independent of confounded genetic\nand fixed environmental effects and the measured co-\nvariates. The CPs in children of mothers who drank daily\nduring pregnancy were 0.35 SD greater than those in chil-\ndren whose mothers never drank during pregnancy. Al-\nthough AIPs were associated with PAE when compar-\ning unrelated offspring, children whose mothers drank\nmore frequently during pregnancy did not have more AIPs\nthan siblings who were less exposed to alcohol in utero.\nAdditional subsample analyses suggested that maternal\npolysubstance use during pregnancy may account for the\nassociations between PAE and AIPs.\nConclusion: These results are consistent with PAE ex-\nerting an environmentally mediated causal effect on child-\nhood CPs, but the relation between PAE and AIPs is more\nlikely to be caused by other factors correlated with ma-\nternal drinking during pregnancy.\nsure (PAE) has been associ-\nated with offspring external-\nizing problems, such as\nconduct problems (CPs),1\ncriminality,2 attention/impulsivity prob-\nlems (AIPs),3,4 and alcohol disorders.5-8 A\nrecent review of the literature9 and a meta-\nanalysis,10 however, have raised ques-\ntions about the strength of some of the as-\nsociations. Given the current state of\nresearch on prenatal drug exposure, Hu-\nizink and Mulder11 recently highlighted\nimportant challenges for the research com-\nmunity. In particular, they noted the need\nto document deleterious outcomes asso-\nciated with moderate levels of alcohol ex-\nposure, explore the adjustment of off-\nspring across time, and delineate the effects\nof exposure to multiple drugs. Research\nalso needs to adequately control for co-\nvariates that may confound the effects of\nPAE, such as family processes (eg, prob-\nlematic parenting or family conflict) and\nparental characteristics, especially mater-\nnal substance use.1,12 Researchers also need\nto account for genetic liabilities that are\nwoman's genetic risk of substance use\ncould be passed down to her children and\nsubsequently affect their behavior.15 Re-\nsearch on the consequences of PAE, there-\nfore, needs studies with large samples, with\nsufficient statistical power to detect small\neffects, using analytical methods and de-\nsigns that can account for potential con-\nAuthor Affiliations:\nDepartment of Psychological\nand Brain Sciences, Indiana\nUniversity, Bloomington\n(Dr D'Onofrio); Department of\nHealth Studies, University of\nChicago, Chicago, Illinois\n(Drs Van Hulle, Rathouz, and\nLahey); Department of\nPsychology, Emory University,\nAtlanta, Georgia (Dr Waldman);\nand Department of Psychology,\nUniversity of Oklahoma,\nNorman (Dr Rodgers).\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association.

Such\nstudies could complement smaller, more intensive stud-\nies6,7,13 and provide the opportunity to find convergent\nevidence from multiple research approaches.16\nBecause of the myriad of variables associated with pre-\nnatal substance exposure, quasi-experimental designs are\nuseful because they can test alternative causal infer-\nences.16 Quasi-experimental designs rely on natural ex-\nperiments that can pull apart processes that are typi-\ncally confounded. Genetically informed approaches, one\nclass of quasi-experimental designs, are important be-\ncause they can separate the co-occurring genetic and en-\nvironmental processes. The use of quasi-experimental de-\nsigns, therefore, can help the study of putative\nenvironments, such as PAE, move from merely identi-\nfying risk factors to highlighting the underlying causal\nmechanisms of externalizing problems.17\nRecently, a variety of quasi-experimental and geneti-\ncally informed studies related to prenatal substance ex-\nposure have been reported. Two studies used the children-\nof-twins design18-20 to explore smoking during pregnancy\n(SDP), finding an independent association between SDP\nand birth weight21 and attention-deficit/hyperactivity dis-\norder (ADHD)14 when shared genetic and environmen-\ntal liability were taken into account. Sibling comparison\nstudies have also been used to study SDP. The approach\ncontrasts children exposed to more prenatal nicotine to\ntheir siblings exposed to less, a design that controls for\ncharacteristics of the mothers, including genetic risk\nassociated with SDP. The results suggest that indepen-\ndent associations between SDP and psychosocial adjust-\nment are either greatly reduced or absent.22,23 Only 1 quasi-\nexperimental study, however, has been conducted on the\nconsequences of PAE. Knopik et al14 found that PAE was\nnot independently associated with offspring ADHD in a\nchildren-of-twins study.\nGiven the somewhat contradictory findings of the as-\nsociation between PAE and offspring attention prob-\nlems9 and the results of the 1 genetically informed study,14\na quasi-experimental study of the consequences of PAE\non offspring externalizing problems is of critical impor-\ntance. Inferences about PAE affect public health cam-\npaigns and prevention efforts24 in addition to informing\ntheories about the etiology of CPs.17 The need for more\nrigorous studies of PAE is further supported by recent\nprevalence estimates that indicate that alcohol use dur-\ning pregnancy is still relatively common.25\nThe overall aim of the present article is to explore\nwhether PAE is related to offspring externalizing behav-\niors and, if so, whether the exposure is consistent with a\ncausal association. The present study has 6 goals. First,\nthese analyses explore the relation between PAE and char-\nacteristics of the mothers and families. Second, the study\ndocuments the statistical relation between PAE and child\nexternalizing problems. Third, the analyses explore\nwhether measured covariates account for associations with\nPAE. Fourth, the analyses compare siblings and cousins\ndifferentially exposed to prenatal alcohol to account for\nunmeasured confounds, including genetic and environ-\nmental factors. If PAE causes externalizing problems, the\nassociation will be found at all levels, especially within\nmothers (ie, siblings exposed to higher levels of prena-\ntal alcohol would have more problems than their sib-\nlings exposed to lower levels).26 The comparison of sib-\nlings explicitly controls for maternal genetic confounds\nbecause PAE is not correlated with genetic risk within\nmothers. Fifth, the analyses investigate whether the re-\nlation was robust to the quasi-experimental approach and\nstatistical controls. Finally, an analysis of a subsample\nof the children that includes measures of prenatal expo-\nsure to marijuana and cocaine further explores mater-\nnal polysubstance use. Ultimately, an environmentally\nmediated causal effect of PAE on childhood externaliz-\ning behaviors--a causal inference--would be sup-\nported if the relation remained robust to the measured\ncovariates and quasi-experimental methods because these\napproaches account for many of the alternative expla-\nnations for the association between PAE and externaliz-\ning problems. This research was approved by the insti-\ntutional review board at Indiana University.\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nMother Generation Sample\nThe National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) is a lon-\ngitudinal study of adolescents and young adults funded by the\nBureau of Labor Statistics. The initial NLSY79 sample included a\nnationally representative sample of 6111 youths and an overs-\nample of 3652 African American and Hispanic youth. The initial\nsampleofyouthusedastratifiedandclusteredprobabilitysample,\nwhich included all siblings in each household in the age range.\nThe present study was conducted using 4912 females from the\ncombined sample who had a child who was at least 4 years old\nsponse rate of 90%. Participants were assessed annually between\n90% or better during the first 16 waves of data collection.

Although 3 types of in-\nterviews are available on the offspring, the present project uses\nmaternal report of the children's characteristics assessed be-\nPAE). Studies using the offspring of the NLSY79 mothers have\nbeen plagued by selection bias because until all childbearing\nof the mothers is complete, offspring available for assessment\nwere necessarily born to the younger mothers. Given that the\noverwhelming majority of the childbearing was completed by\nthe 2004 survey and we use assessments of young children, the\nselection bias for the present analyses is relatively small (B.M.D.,\nJ.

Most of the assess-\nments of prenatal substance use reports were completed when\nthe children were young, mostly within 2 years of birth.22\nTable 2 includes the response categories for alcohol and con-\nversions to days per week for the sample of offspring with in-\nformation on externalizing problems. A previous article22 ana-\nlyzed the consequences of SDP. Owing to the small number of\npregnancies during which the mothers reported drinking ev-\nery day, the last 2 categories were collapsed. There are missing\ndata for the prenatal substance use section. Most of the miss-\ning PAE data (92%) were due to an incorrect skip in the as-\nsessment protocol. Sensitivity analyses (replacing the missing\nvalues with zeros, the mean PAE for the mothers, or estimates\nbased on multiple imputation) revealed that the missing val-\nues for PAE did not alter the results presented herein, which\nare based only on offspring with reports of PAE.\nThe maternal assessment started to measure marijuana and\ncocaine use during pregnancy in the 1986 assessment. There-\nfore, the variables were available only for 3977 offspring with\ndata on externalizing behaviors. Because of the low preva-\nlence, exposure was coded as exposed or not for each drug. In\nthe subsample, 1.6% of children were exposed to prenatal mari-\njuana and 0.6% to cocaine.\nMaternal and Familial Characteristics\nAvailable characteristics of the mothers and families that could\nconfound the effects of PAE were included in the analyses.\nTable 1 provides the distribution of the items. When the even-\ntual mothers of the CNLSY sample were aged 15 to 22 years\nthey were asked about their participation in 12 delinquent be-\nhaviors using the Self-Reported Delinquency Interview,29 a re-\nliable and valid measure used in contemporary delinquency re-\nsearch.30-32 Symptom counts were regressed on the mother's age\nat which she completed the survey and were converted to a z\nscore for ease of interpretability. Maternal age at the birth of\nher first child was also obtained, a variable that predicts off-\nspring delinquency in the CNLSY (B.M.D., J. A. Goodnight, MA,\nC.A.V.H., I.D.W., J.L.R., P.J.R., and B.B.L., unpublished data,\nat age 30 years in 1986 inflation-adjusted dollars, a measure\nthat includes income from all adults in the household at that\ntime. Total number of years of schooling was also assessed for\neach mother. A composite score of the Armed Services Voca-\ntional Aptitude Battery was used as a measure of the mother's\nintellectual ability, which was converted to a z score. The 1994\nassessment included an extensive assessment of the mother's\nalcohol use and alcohol problems (during her lifetime and not\nlimited to her pregnancies). These questions assessed alcohol\nfrequency (days per month), quantity (drinks per day), and the\nnumber of binge episodes in the past month, and 25 items as-\nsessed lifetime symptoms of alcohol abuse and dependence. A\ntotal of 32% of the women also reported having children by more\nthan 1 man.\nOffspring Childhood Externalizing Problems\nMothers rated their 4- to 11-year-old children on the Behavior\nProblem Index at each wave of assessment. The Behavior Prob-\nlem Index included 13 items from the Child Behavior Check-\nlist34 that had the strongest associations with Child Behavior\nChecklist factor scores.35 Mothers rated each child using a 3-point\nscale. Standard diagnostic approaches36 and previous factor\nanalyses22 revealed that the items load on 3 factors: CPs, op-\npositional problems, and AIPs. The association between PAE\nand CPs and AIPs is explored herein. Trajectory analyses on\nthe CNLSY sample36 indicated that the average number of CPs\nduring ages 4 to 11 years was stable and represents a good mea-\nsure of severity of externalizing problems reported by adoles-\ncents. Therefore, mean CP scores across ages 4 to 11 years were\ncalculated by taking the mean of z scores for CPs at each as-\nsessed year of age, standardized within each age. The CPs at\neach age were highly correlated with the mean across ages 4 to\nCNLSY also overlap substantially with those used in previous\npopulation-based longitudinal studies.32,37 The mean of z scores\nfor AIPs was also stable and exhibited good external validity.\nThe AIP scores at each age were highly correlated with the mean\nwere also strongly related to standardized assessments of aca-\nTable 1.

All of the analyses in the present article were\nweighted to produce estimates from a representative sample of\nwomen in the United States.\nHierarchical linear models (HLMs) were used to explore and\ncharacterize the associations between PAE and offspring ex-\nternalizing behaviors because of the nested nature of the data.39\nWhen the NLSY79 and CNLSY samples are combined, there\nare 3 levels of analysis: the offspring, maternal, and NLSY79\nhousehold levels.22 Five primary HLMs were fit to the associa-\ntions between PAE and each measure of offspring externaliz-\ning problems.\nModel 1 calculated the unadjusted relation between alco-\nhol exposure, measured in mean number of days exposed per\nweek, and each dimension of externalizing behavior, control-\nling for offspring sex. The analyses included 8621 offspring of\n4912 mothers. Although previous analyses suggested that off-\nmoderate the associations, the factors did not affect the mag-\nnitude of the relations between PAE and CPs or AIPs in the pres-\nent sample. The analyses also revealed that linear models pro-\nvided the best fit for CPs and AIPs because the parameters\nassociated with a quadratic effect were small and statistically\nnonsignificant.\nModel 2 was fit to the relation between PAE and offspring\nexternalizing behaviors controlling for measured covariates that\ncould confound the association (listed in the \"Measures\" sub-\nsection of the \"Methods\" section).\nModel 3 compared siblings differentially exposed to pre-\nnatal alcohol (ie, the mother drank alcohol during one preg-\nnancy and not another or drank more during one pregnancy\nthan another). The within-mother association (ie, compari-\nsons of the different offspring of each mother) provides a\nmore stringent test of causality because the comparison con-\ntrols for unmeasured genetic and environmental confounds\nthat vary between unrelated mothers. The analyses were\nbased on a subset of the families that included children with\nmothers). Siblings were compared using contrast codes.\nEach offspring was assigned a value equal to the deviation of\nthe individual measure of PAE from the mean PAE of all the\nchildren from the same mother. The contrast codes, there-\nfore, reflect the amount of PAE relative (more or less) to the\nmean PAE of all the children in the family. The model also\nincluded comparisons of cousins born to NLSY79 mothers\nwho are sisters. Although the comparison of cousins is not\nas strong as a within-mother approach, it can help provide\nconverging evidence concerning causal processes.43 Cousins\nwere also compared using contrast codes; cousins with more\nPAE, on average, were compared with their cousins with less\nPAE, on average. The model also compared unrelated indi-\nviduals (mean PAE in all cousins from one extended family\ncompared with mean PAE in cousins in a separate extended\nfamily). More details about how the contrast codes were cal-\nculated,22,43 and the statistical justification for their use,44 can\nbe found elsewhere.\nModel 4 combined the use of measured covariates and the\nsibling and cousin comparisons, thus using statistical and meth-\nodologic controls for potential confounds.\nModel 5 tested whether PAE was associated with external-\nizing problems in the subsample of children that included in-\nformation on prenatal exposure to marijuana and cocaine. The\nHLMs included prenatal exposure to alcohol, nicotine, mari-\njuana, and cocaine and the sex of the offspring. Because the as-\nsessment of all the substances was available only on a subset\nof the sample, sibling comparisons could not be completed.\nMultiple imputation was used for all of the HLMs that in-\ncluded maternal and familial covariates to account for missing\nvalues. The analyses, therefore, use all available data rather than\nrelying on families with complete maternal data. Given the as-\nsumption that the missing values are missing at random or com-\npletely at random, multiple imputation yields standard errors\nthat account for uncertainty due to missing values and avoids\nbias arising from complete-record analysis.45 Unstandardized\nregression parameters were used because of the difficulty com-\nparing standardized coefficients when exploring causal pro-\ncesses,46 and measurement of PAE is in meaningful units (days\nper week).\nRESULTS\nTable 3 provides the associations among mean alcohol\nuse during pregnancy and maternal and familial charac-\nteristics. Mean PAE across all pregnancies was slightly\ncorrelated with maternal delinquency and age at first child-\nbirth. Mean PAE was more strongly related to substance\nuse measures, including mean levels of SDP, alcohol fre-\nquency and quantity, and alcohol abuse and depen-\ndence items.

Including the mea-\nsured covariates slightly reduced the association between\nPAE and offspring CPs (b=0.06, where b represents un-\nstandardized regression weight; P.001) compared with\nmodel 1, but the model still revealed a positive and statis-\ntically significant relation. The Figure presents the unad-\njusted and adjusted means for CPs at each level of PAE.\nThe adjusted means are based on least squares estimates\nafter controlling for the measured covariates. The Figure\nillustrates a positive association between PAE and CPs for\nthe entire sample; children exposed to more prenatal al-\ncohol had more CPs than unrelated children with less PAE,\neven after controlling for the measured covariates.\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nModel 3 provided a statistical comparison of siblings\ndifferentially exposed to prenatal alcohol. The within-\nmother association with PAE was still significant (b=0.05;\nP=.03) and was commensurate with findings from the\ncomparison of cousins and unrelated individuals in the\nmodel. The last model included the measured covari-\nates, and the statistical relation with PAE remained within\nmothers (b=0.05; P=.04). The cousin comparisons in\nmodels 3 and 4 also suggests that PAE is independently\nassociated with offspring CPs. The Figure also provides\nan estimate of the association between PAE and CPs based\non the parameters from model 4. Children with more PAE\nhave more CPs than their siblings with less PAE while\ncontrolling for the measured factors. The results of all\nthe models are consequently consistent with a causal as-\nsociation between PAE and offspring CPs.\nThe results of the HLMs for AIPs are given in Table 5.\nModel 1 found an association between PAE and AIPs\n(b=0.09 SD per days exposed per week). Model 2 con-\ntrolled for measured covariates, and the statistical asso-\nsults of model 3, the comparison of siblings (b=0.03;\nP=.18), and model 4, the comparison of siblings con-\ntrolling for measured covariates (b=0.02; P=.24), re-\nvealed greatly reduced and statistically nonsignificant as-\nsociations. The comparison of cousins in model 4 also\nrevealed no association, further suggesting that the sta-\ntistical association between PAE and AIPs is not causal.\nThe association between PAE and AIPs, therefore, seems\nto be due primarily to characteristics related to PAE that\nwere not included in the previous analytical models.\nAdditional HLMs of the sample of children with data on\nexposure to prenatal alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, and mari-\njuana were conducted. The results suggested that PAE\nwas independently associated with CPs; the magnitude\nsurate with the results of the full sample, but the param-\neter could not be precisely estimated in the smaller sub-\nsample. Consistent with the sibling comparisons,\nstatistically controlling for all of the measures of prena-\ntal substance exposure resulted in no association be-\nCOMMENT\nThe structure of relationships within families in this\nsample provides a powerful natural laboratory for quasi-\nexperimental designs of environmental risk factors.16,26\nThe results of the present study indicate that there is an\nassociation between PAE and CPs that was not due to\ngenetic factors related to maternal alcohol consumption\nduring pregnancy, to environmental factors correlated\nwith PAE that vary between unrelated mothers, or to a\nvariety of measured covariates, including maternal and\nfamilial characteristics and exposure to multiple drugs\nin utero. The findings thus support a strong inference\nthat PAE causes an increased risk of offspring CPs through\nenvironmental processes.\nCompared with children who were not exposed to any\nalcohol in utero, the results suggest that offspring ex-\nTable 3.

This finding is consistent with the previous re-\nsearch that found robust associations between PAE and off-\nspring externalizing problems, including studies that con-\ntrolled for characteristics of both parents7,8,13 and included\nmore precise measures of PAE.6 In addition, the present\ncausal inference regarding PAE and child CPs is consis-\ntent with experimental animal studies,11 including re-\nsearch in monkeys47 and mice,48 that found teratogenic ef-\nfects of PAE. Therefore, prevention efforts should continue\nto target alcohol consumption during pregnancy.24\nAlthoughAIPswerestatisticallyassociatedwithPAEand\nthe association remained robust to the use of maternal co-\nvariates, PAE does not seem to be a causal risk factor for\nAIPs. The comparison of siblings and cousins differen-\ntiallyexposedtoprenatalalcoholwhilecontrollingformea-\nsured characteristics revealed no (or a very limited) asso-\nciation. If the present analyses relied only on the use of\nmaternal covariates, we would have wrongly inferred that\nPAE was a causal risk factor for AIPs. The analysis of the\nsubsample of children with information on prenatal expo-\nsure to multiple drugs further provides converging evi-\ndence in the study and suggests that maternal polysub-\nstanceuseduringpregnancymayaccountfortheunadjusted\nassociations between PAE and AIPs. The finding that PAE\ndoes not cause AIPs is also consistent with a recent re-\nview9 and 1 extant behavior genetic study on PAE.14\nThe contrasting findings for CPs and AIPs underscore\nthe findings from imaging studies that different brain re-\ngions may be more vulnerable to PAE. Structures such as\nthebasalganglia,corpuscallosum,andparietalcortexseem\nto be particularly susceptible to the effects of PAE.49,50 The\nbrain imaging results and studies comparing children with\nhigh levels of PAE with those with ADHD51 highlight the\nimportance of exploring the specific neuroanotomical pro-\ncessesthatmediateoraccountforassociationsbetweeneach\nneurobehavioral problem associated with PAE.\nThe present study has many advantages. Most impor-\ntant, the study used a quasi-experimental design that con-\ntrolled for genetic and environmental liability shared by\nmothers and their offspring. The results also accounted\nfor measured maternal and familial characteristics and\nmaternal polysubstance use during pregnancy, a major\nlimitation of many existing studies.11 The results of the\nTable 4.

The HLMs indicated that offspring sex, maternal smoking\nduring pregnancy, and family race/ethnicity did not moderate the association between prenatal alcohol exposure and each measure of externalizing behavior.

First, quasi-experimental designs cannot prove cau-\nsality.16 Theanalysesdonotaccountforeverypossiblevari-\nable that could confound the relation. The only plausible\nalternative explanation for the present findings is that an\nunmeasured factor that varied between siblings and was\nhighly correlated with variations in PAE is the actual en-\nvironmental causal factor. This might include variations\nin maternal depression at the time of each pregnancy. It\ncould also include characteristics of different fathers when\nthey differed across siblings (I.D.W., B.M.D., C.A.V.H.,\nJ.L.R., P.J.R., and B.B.L., unpublished data, August 2007),7\nbut the analyses at least partially ruled out that explana-\ntion by controlling for being in a blended family. A full ex-\nploration of the variation in alcohol use during pregnancy\nwithin mothers is beyond the scope of the present analy-\nses, although some of the variation is related to the his-\ntorical reduction that has occurred during the longitudi-\nnal NLSY79 study.52 Future studies will need to explore\nadditional risks that covary with PAE within mothers. Sec-\nond, the frequency measure of drinking during each preg-\nnancy may not precisely measure PAE. The assessment of\nmaternal alcohol use during pregnancy was based on re-\nported frequency of alcohol consumption, which did not\ninclude the amount of consumption per day or the tim-\ning.6 The assessment was also completed retrospectively.\nHowever, the magnitude of the unadjusted associations is\nconsistent with previous research,11 and there is evidence\nthat retrospective reports of prenatal substance use are re-\nliable53,54 and are perhaps even more valid than concur-\nThird, the present design is based on variations in al-\ncohol consumption across pregnancies.22 The present find-\nings are relevant to the general population only if women\nwho vary their consumption of alcohol across pregnan-\ncies are not different from mothers who consistently drank\nthe same amount during each pregnancy. This assump-\ntion may be warranted in the present analyses, as most\nwomen (88%) who (1) ever drank during 1 pregnancy\nand (2) had more than 1 child reported variation in their\nalcohol use among their pregnancies. The difficulties in\naccurately reporting alcohol consumption for different\nchildren in a family by a mother could have affected the\nsibling comparison analyses. The fact that the sibling and\ncousin comparisons were comparable, however, sug-\ngests that inaccurate measurement of PAE within moth-\ners cannot fully account for the findings.\nFourth, the present analyses explored moderators (off-\nspring sex, maternal SDP, and family race/ethnicity) that\nhave been found to influence the effects of prenatal sub-\nstance exposure,40-42 but other characteristics, including\ngenetic factors56 and stressful events,47 may also moder-\nate the effects of PAE.\nFifth, the present analyses could not determine whether\nthe confounding factors for AIPs were genetic or envi-\nronmental in origin. Use of the NLSY79 and the CNLSY\nprovides the opportunity to nest the sibling comparison\napproach within a children-of-twins/siblings design, but\nnot all kinship relations are unambiguous.22 The most\ntained more precise measures of genetic relatedness, so\nfuture analyses will explore the nature of the confound-\ning factors with the full adult and offspring sample.\nSixth, the results are limited to externalizing prob-\nlems during childhood reported by the mothers. Future\nanalyses will need to explore substance use outcomes or\nStandardized Score\nA\nB\nAlcohol Exposure, d/wk\nStandardized Score\nUnadjusted means\nAdjusted means\nSibling comparison and\nadjusted model\nUnadjusted means\nAdjusted means\nSibling comparison and\nadjusted model\nFigure.

The finding of a linear association\nbetween PAE and offspring externalizing problems is con-\nsistent with previous research,49 but the sample may not\nhave included enough children exposed to high levels of\nprenatal alcohol to explore whether there is a critical\nthreshold. Likewise, the results exploring the effects of\nmaternal polysubstance use during pregnancy must be\nviewed cautiously because of the low prevalence of ex-\nposure to cocaine and marijuana.\nFinally, smaller studies of PAE can conduct more ex-\ntensive assessments of PAE, offspring mental health prob-\nlems, and potential confounds. Thus, the present large-\nscale study complements but does not replace more\nfocused and intensive studies.\nThe present study, which was based on a representa-\ntive sample, a rigorous design, and a sophisticated analyti-\ncal approach to identify possible confounds, strengthens\nthe inference that PAE has a causal effect on the risk of CPs\nin offspring. In contrast, the finding that unmeasured con-\nfounds related to PAE may be responsible for greater AIPs\nin offspring suggests that the research community needs\nto focus on putative environmental risk factors that are cor-\nrelatedwithmaternalsubstanceuseduringpregnancy,par-\nticularly ones that vary across siblings. The results are con-\nsistent with research using different methods but further\nemphasizetheneedforadditionalquasi-experimentalstud-\nies of prenatal substance exposure.\nCorrespondence: Brian M.
