Fingerman1\n1Department of Human Development and Family Sciences, University of Texas at Austin.\n2Institute of Social Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\n3Department of Human Development and Family Studies, Pennsylvania State University, University Park.\nObjectives. Middle-aged adults often provide support to aging parents, but researchers know little about support that\nyoung adults provide middle-aged parents. This study examined support that young adults provide parents and explana-\ntions for that support from both offspring's and parents' perspectives.\nExchanges Study reported support that offspring provide parents. Participants also reported parental personal problems,\nparental disability status, relationship quality, and support that parents provide offspring.\nResults.Offspring provided parents with emotional support and listening more often than other forms of support.\nOffspring reported providing more frequent support than parents reported receiving. We examined factors associated\nwith support using multilevel models. Both offspring and parents reported more frequent support provided to parents\nwhen they had higher quality relationships and when parents gave more frequent support to offspring. Offspring (but not\nparents) reported providing more frequent support to parents when parents were disabled.\nDiscussion. Findings are consistent with solidarity theory, which suggests that high-quality relationships may explain\nsupport. The concept of self-enhancement and generativity in middle-aged parents may explain the intergenerational dif-\nferences in the association between parental disability and support.\nKey Words: Family--Intergenerational relationships--Social support.\nINTERGENERATIONAL support plays a key role in the\nmaterial and psychological well-being of family mem-\nDavey & Eggebeen, 1998). Researchers have documented\nhelp that middle-aged adults provide to their older parents\n(Katz, Gur-Yaish, & Lowenstein, 2010; Zarit & Eggebeen,\n2002). Middle-aged adults tend to support aging parents\nwhen parents are in need (Eggebeen & Davey, 1998), have\nclose intergenerational ties (Schwarz, Trommsdorff, Albert,\n& Mayer, 2005), and when in response to support that par-\nents provided (Silverstein, Conroy, Wang, Giarrusso, &\nBengtson, 2002). However, it is not clear whether these sup-\nport patterns found among middle-aged offspring are also\nevident among young adult offspring.\nYoung adults may provide support to parents, albeit with\ndifferent type of support (Silverstein & Giarrusso, 2010).\nIndeed, a study in Europe documented emotional and prac-\ntical support young adults provide to parents (Bucx, van\nWel, & Knijn, 2012). In Asian countries, young adults also\nmay provide financial support to parents (Kim, Cheng,\nFingerman, & Zarit, in press). However, it is not clear what\ntypes of support that young adults in the United States pro-\nvide their parents.\nThis study examined young adults' support to middle-\naged parents with a U.S. sample and contributes to the\nliterature in three ways: (a) by examining several different\ntypes of support (e.g., listening to parents talk about their\ndaily lives, practical, financial, and technological support),\n(b) by including both offspring and parent reports of sup-\nport provided to parents, and (c) by considering reasons that\nmay underlie young adults' support of parents.\nTypes of Support Young Adult Offspring Provide\nThe types of support that young adults provide parents\nmay be associated with the characteristics of emerging\nadulthood (Arnett, 2007). In the twenty-first century, youth\ntend to experience delayed marriage, difficulty obtaining\nfull-time jobs, and extended education (Furstenberg, 2010).\nDue to these prolonged transitions, adult offspring have few\nresponsibilities or ties that pull them away from their fam-\nily of origin. Moreover, current technologies allow them to\nengage in frequent contact via e-mail, text messaging, and\ncell phones (Lefkowitz, Vukman, & Loken, 2012). Thus,\nyoung adults may provide companionship and advice, lend\na listening ear, and offer emotional support to parents on a\nfrequent basis. However, longer transitions into adulthood\nmay also limit their monetary resources. Studies from the\nNetherlands examining financial support revealed that young\nadults gave little money to parents (Bucx et al., 2012). This\nsupport pattern may be similar in the United States.\nYoung adults may also provide practical support to par-\nents. In United States, norms of filial obligation require off-\nspring to provide practical support and care when parents\nincur health problems in late life and require support (Gans\n& Silverstein, 2006). Although young adults may not be\nexpected to provide care for their parents, they may help\nwith a variety of every day chores such as running errands,\noffering rides, or remodeling or moving.\nTechnological support may be another type of assis-\ntance that young adults provide their parents. Technological\nadvances, such as computers, the Internet, and cell phones,\nhave become an essential feature of family life (Kennedy,\nSmith, Wells, & Wellman, 2008). Although both middle-\naged adults and their adult offspring may be familiar with\ntechnological devices, young adults are more likely than\ntheir parents to use cutting edge technologies (Smith, 2010).\nTherefore, they may provide valuable information about\nnew computer programs or selecting electronic equipment.\nDiscrepancies in Reports of Support by Offspring and\nParents\nAssessing both parties' perspectives regarding exchanges\nmay contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of\nintergenerational support. Many studies of intergenerational\nexchanges have relied on the child's or the parent's report\n(See a review by Bianchi, Evans, Hotz, McGarry, & Seltzer,\n2007). The few studies that have examined dyads, including\nmiddle-aged offspring and older parents, have found that\nparents report receiving less support than offspring report\ngiving (Kim, Zarit, Eggebeen, Birditt, & Fingerman, 2011).\nParents' minimization of offspring support may reflect\nself-enhancement, that is, the tendency to describe one's\nactions more positively than others perceive those actions\ntheory, middle-aged parents seek generativity and desire to\ngive to future generations. Thus, parents may perceive them-\nselves as providers rather than receivers of support and report\nreceiving less support than young adults report providing.\nWhy Do Young Adults Provide Support to Parents?\nThis study applied three perspectives from literature\nregarding middle-aged offspring and aging parents to help\nunderstand why young adults may provide support to their\nparents. Factors that may explain offspring support include\nthe following: (a) parental needs (Katz et al., 2010), (b)\nclose intergenerational ties (Schwarz et al., 2005), and (c)\nreciprocation of support offspring receive from parents\nOffspring support and parental needs.--Children of any\nage may respond to parental needs (Eggebeen & Davey,\ntheory in sociology and altruism theory in economics (Kohli\nstep in to assist when parents incur problems, such as health\ndifficulties, functional limitations, or financial crises (Katz\nIn young adulthood, offspring may provide help to par-\nents when they have dire needs. Although older adults often\nencounter health problems (Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, 2010), middle-aged adults can also experience\nsignificant health challenges that require temporary or long-\nterm assistance. Indeed, prior studies suggest that young\nadult offspring assist as caregivers when parents suffer cri-\nses, such as depression, early onset dementia, and cancer\nparents may experience personal problems, such as finan-\ncial crises or relationship troubles, which may elicit various\ntypes of everyday support from young adult offspring.\nOffspring support and close intergenerational ties.--\nSolidarity theory suggests that support exchanges occur\nin relationships characterized by positive sentiments and\nhigh relationship quality (Bengtson, Giarrusso, Mabry, &\nSilverstein, 2002). These patterns have been documented in\nlate life; middle-aged adults provide more support to par-\nents when they have better quality relationships (Schwarz\nSimilarly, in young adulthood, high-quality relationships\nmay present opportunities for offspring to provide support\nto their parents. In the context of positive quality relation-\nships, young adults may offer emotional support, lend an\nattentive ear, help with chores and special projects, serve as\na companion for mutually enjoyable activities, share infor-\nmation about the latest technologies, and provide advice.\nOffspring support and reciprocity of support.--Offspring\nmay also respond to the parental support they receive by\nproviding help in return. Life-span reciprocity theory sug-\ngests that offspring repay parents for support in early life\nby providing them with support in old age (Antonucci &\nJackson, 1990). For example, emotional support that parents\nprovided to young adult children explained children's pro-\npensity to support aging parents 26 years later (Silverstein\net al., 2002). This reciprocity may begin earlier with young\nadults providing support in response to what they receive,\nbefore parents require help. In a European sample, Grundy\n(2005) found that both older and middle-aged parents who\nprovided more practical and financial support received\nmore practical and financial assistance from adult offspring.\nThus, young adult offspring may provide greater support\nwhen they receive more parental assistance.\nOther Factors Explaining Young Adults'Support of\nParents\nWe controlled for other variables that may be associated\nwith the amount of support that young adults provide their\nparents. Offspring's life course statuses contribute to patterns\nof support (Bucx et al., 2012). Specifically, students may pro-\nvide more support than nonstudents (Attias-Donfut & Wolff,\n2000). By contrast, married offspring may give less support\nto parents than unmarried offspring (Sarkisian & Gerstel,\n2008). Offspring who have children themselves were less\nlikely to provide financial support to their parents than off-\nspring without children, after controlling for offspring's age\nand coresidence with parents (Bucx et al., 2012).\nWe also controlled for offspring's race, gender, and\nage. Studies have documented different support pat-\nterns between Black and White middle-aged offspring\n(Fingerman, VanderDrift, Dotterer, Birditt, & Zarit, 2011).\nDaughters generally provide more support to parents than\nsons (Raley & Bianchi, 2006). Moreover, older offspring\ntypically provide more support to parents than younger off-\nspring (Litwin, Vogel, K\u00fcnemund, & Kohli, 2008).\nIn addition, we controlled for characteristics of middle-\naged parents, which may also be associated with the amount\nof offspring support including gender, marital status, fam-\nily size, education, and geographical proximity between\nparents and adult children. Studies have found that moth-\ners receive more support than fathers, and married parents\nreceive more support from offspring than divorced parents\nchildren who had more siblings (i.e., larger families) pro-\nvided less practical support to parents (Bonsang, 2007).\nParents with higher education also received less help from\noffspring (Bucx et al., 2012). Finally, geographical proxim-\nity allows parties to provide practical support (Lowenstein,\nKatz, & Gur-Yaish, 2007); however, other forms of support\nmay transcend geographical distances.\nIn sum, we assessed support that young adults provide\nto their middle-aged parents. We predicted that offspring\nprovide listening, companionship, advice, emotional,\nand technological support frequently but give less practi-\ncal and financial support. Additionally, we compared off-\nspring's and parents' perspectives and expected offspring\nto report giving more support than parents reported receiv-\ning. Drawing on contingency theory, we predicted offspring\nwould provide more support to parents when parents have\ngreater needs (i.e., disability, personal problems). Based\non solidarity and reciprocity theory, we also predicted off-\nspring would provide more support when they had better\nquality relationships with parents and when they received\nmore support from parents.\nMethod\nSample\nThe sample was from the Family Exchanges Study (FES;\nPhiladelphia Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area were ini-\ntially recruited using random digit dialing within regional area\ncodes as well as purchased lists from Genyses Corporation.\nParents.--The FES recruited 633 parents, aged\nThe response rate for eligible parents was 75%, which is\ncomparable to similar studies (Grundy, 2005; Silverstein\nFor the parent sample in this study, we utilized data from\n364 parents who had at least one young adult child who\nalso participated in this study. FES oversampled areas with\nhigh ethnic minority representation. In comparison to the\nU.S. population, the parents in this study included a higher\nproportion of African American adults and were slightly\nhigher in educational attainment and income (U.S. Census\nBureau, 2008). As shown in Table 1, parents had an aver-\nwomen, 26% African American, and 65% married.\nAdult offspring.--At the end of the interviews with\nparents, we requested contact information for up to three\ngrown children, aged 18 years or older. The majority of\nparents (88%) had three or fewer children; we asked for\ninformation regarding each of their children. For the 12% of\nparents who had more than three grown children, we asked\nabout the grown child who received the most support, the\nleast support, and a randomly selected other child.\nWe obtained contact information of offspring from 63%\nof the 633 parents in the sample. We interviewed 75% of the\nThe response rate for offspring was higher than studies\nrecruiting middle-aged children from aging parents (Suitor\nTo focus on young adults, we further limited the sam-\nmultiracial; 10% were married; 16% had children; and\nadult offspring in this study were recruited from 364 par-\nents/families where 18 (5%) families had 3 offspring who\n(63%) families had 1 offspring who participated. Based\non data from the parents' interviews, we conducted t tests\ncomparing offspring aged 18\u00ad30 who participated and off-\nspring aged 18\u00ad30 who did not participate in the interviews.\nGrown children in this study were younger, perceived as\nless healthy, and more likely to be White, women, and stu-\ndents compared with young adult offspring who did not\nparticipate. Parents also reported better relationship quality\nand more frequent support from their participating young\nadult offspring.\nProcedure\nMost parents and offspring completed the survey via\nComputer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI). Offspring\nalso had the option of a web-based survey. In this study,\n86% of the offspring completed the survey by phone and\n14% completed it via the web-based option. Compared with\noffspring who completed the phone interview, offspring\nwho completed the web-based survey were more likely\nwere evident in demographic characteristics or patterns of\nsupport. Each participant received $30 compensation for\ncompleting the survey. The phone interview lasted approxi-\nmin, and the web-survey took approximately\nOffspring answered questions regarding themselves and\neach living parent. Thus, offspring provided information\nabout the parent who did not participate in the study as\nwell as the parent who did. The majority of offspring (97%,\nn = 498) reported on two parents.\nMeasures\nIntergenerational support index.--Participants com-\npleted the Intergenerational Support Index (ISI; Fingerman,\nCheng, Cichy, Birditt, & Zarit, 2013). The ISI assessed six\ntypes of support including (a) listening to talk about daily\nlife, (b) emotional support, (c) companionship, (d) advice,\n(e) practical, and (f) financial support. We also included an\nadditional type of support, technological support (Boase,\nHorrigan, Wellman, & Rainie, 2006). Offspring reported\nthe frequency with which they provided each type of sup-\nport to their mother and father separately rated: 1 = less\nthan once a year or never, 2 = once a year, 3 = a few times\na year, 4 = monthly, 5 = a few times a month, 6 = weekly,\n7 = a few times a week, and 8 = daily. Parents completed\nthe same items regarding support received from each child.\nFor the research question regarding support, the mean of\nseven items served as a summary score; for the offspring\nreport,  = .83; for the parent report,  = .80. We also con-\nsidered the frequency of each type of support separately.\nParental needs.--Parental needs were assessed with\nitems measuring parental problems and disability. Offspring\ncompleted the Life Problems Scales (Birditt, Fingerman, &\nZarit, 2010), indicating whether parents experienced eight\ntypes of problems in the past 2 years: physical, emotional/\npsychological, drug/drinking or financial problems, death\nof people they felt close to, victim of a crime, divorce/\nrelationship problems, or other problems. Each problem\nwas coded 1 or 0 and summed into a total score. Offspring\nreported whether each parent was physically disabled,\ncoded as 0 = not disabled or 1 = disabled.\nClose intergenerational ties.--Participants responded\nto two widely used items regarding positive qualities of\nrelationship: (a) how much they felt loved and cared for\n(Umberson, 1992) and (b) how much they felt understood\nby the other (Fingerman, Cheng, Birditt, & Zarit, 2011);\nrated 1 = not at all to 5 = a great deal. For offspring reports,\nReciprocity of support.--Offspring and parents reported\nhow much support the parent provided to offspring using\nthe same ISI items.\nControl variables.--We controlled for variables poten-\ntially associated with support. Offspring gender was\nTable 1.

We also coded offspring\nstatuses dichotomously: (a) student status: 0 = not student\nor 1 = student; (b) parental status: 0 = no child or 1 = have\nchildren; and (c) marital status: 0 = other or 1 = married or\nremarried.\nFamily size was coded as the number of children parents\nhave. Parents reported the number of years of education\nthey completed. Consistent with other studies, we coded\noffspring geographical proximity to parent as 0 = 50 miles\nAnalysis Strategy\nAnalyses treated parents' and offspring's reports sepa-\nrately. The initial analyses focused on descriptive statistics\npertaining to support that offspring provide parents. The\nsupport measure relied on an ordinal scale that has been\nSilverstein, Gans, & Yang 2006). Some previous studies\nhave measured intergenerational support by asking about\nsupport over the last month (Bonsang, 2007; Eggebeen,\n2005). For descriptive purposes, we present the proportions\nof parents and offspring who reported each type of support\nat least once a month, with each type of support recoded\nas 1 (at least once a month) or 0 (less than once a month).\nFor hypothesis testing analyses, we treated the support\nmeasure as continuous, which is typical in research using\ntemporal scales for support (Silverstein et al., 2002; Lin &\nYi, 2011). We examined factors associated with offspring\nsupport. To do so, we used multilevel analysis with the\nPROC Mixed function in SAS (Littell, Milliken, Stroup, &\nconsider multiple offspring nested within families, shared\nvariance of offspring in the same family (i.e., reports about\noffspring in the same family), variance between families,\nand unbalanced data (i.e., unequal number of family mem-\nbers). We used pairwise deletion for missing data (rates of\nmissing data were minimal < 2%).\nTo assure that the treatment of support as a continuous\noutcome did not distort findings, we also estimated the\nmodels treating each type of support as a dichotomous out-\ncome with 1 (at least monthly support) or 0 (less than once\na month). We used the PROC Glimmix function in SAS,\nwhich estimates multilevel models with binary outcomes.\nThe patterns of findings were nearly identical. For ease\nin interpretation, we present findings from the continuous\noutcome.\nPredicting offspring reports.--For offspring reports,\nwere nested within 364 families. We used a three-level\nmodel structure throughout the analyses where the lower\nlevel was the offspring's reports of 1,013 parents, the mid-\nfamilies.\nPredicting parent reports.--For parents' reports, 364 par-\nents reported on 515 participating offspring. Because each\nfamily had only one parent's report, two-level multilevel\nmodels were used. The lower level was the parents' reports\nWe estimated three multilevel models to examine rea-\nsons for offspring support: (a) parental need (problems and\ndisability status), (b) offspring's relationship quality with\nparents, and (c) support parents provided to offspring. We\nconsidered two types of dependent variables: (a) a compos-\nite measure of the average of the seven types of support, and\n(b) each of the seven types of support examined separately.\nControl variables included offspring's race, gender, age,\nstudent status, marital status, and parental status as well as\nparents' gender, marital status, family size, education, and\ngeographical distance between parents and offspring.\nWe did not test the differences of coefficients predict-\ning offspring support between parents' and offspring's\nreports because offspring's reports involved 3-level models,\nwhereas parents' reports involved 2-level models. Similarly,\nwe did not test the differences of coefficients predicting\noffspring support across types of support because types\nof support were dependent variables in different statistical\nmodels. Moreover, for models testing reciprocity of support\nbetween offspring and parents, we did not include compan-\nionship because providing and receiving companionship\nusually indicates being together for the same activities.\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics and Discrepancies in Offspring's\nand Parents'Reports of Support\nWe first considered descriptive information regarding\ntypes of support. Figure 1 shows the percentages of off-\nspring providing support at least once a month. A large pro-\nportion of offspring and parents reported listening to parents\ntalk about daily life at least monthly (88% from offspring\nreports; 90% from parent reports), whereas only 18% of\noffspring and 11% of parents reported that offspring pro-\nvided financial support at least monthly. Contrary to expec-\ntations, only 53% of offspring and 38% of parents reported\ntechnological support from offspring at least monthly.\nWe also compared parents' and offspring's reports of\noffspring support. As expected, paired t-tests revealed that\noffspring reported providing emotional support (t = 3.81),\n(t = 7.08), and financial support (t = 5.12), more frequently\nthan parents reported receiving these types of support\n(ps < .001). Offspring's and parents' reports did not differ\nfor listening or companionship.\nWhy Do Children Provide Support to Parents?\nNext, we considered factors that may explain support\nyoung adults provide to parents. We tested parental needs,\nclose intergenerational ties, and reciprocity of support in\nseparate models.\nParental needs.--As can be seen in Table 2, consistent\nwith predictions, young adults reported providing more\noverall support (average support across all types) to par-\nents who had a disability. We estimated this model for each\ntype of support separately (See Supplementary Table 1).\nOffspring reported giving more money to parents who\nexperienced personal problems. They also provided more\npractical, technical, and financial support when parents\nwere disabled.\nOn the other hand, with parents' reports (Table 2), we did\nnot find an association between parents' personal problems/\ndisability and offspring support. This pattern was the same\nfor each type of support (See Supplementary Table 1).\nClose intergenerational ties.--We then examined\nwhether offspring provide more support when they have\nbetter quality relations with parents (See Table 2). For off-\nspring's reports, having a more positive relationship was\nassociated with offspring giving more overall support as\nwell as each type of support, except financial support (See\nSupplementary Table 2). For parents' reports, too, having a\nbetter relationship was also associated with greater overall\nsupport and more of each type of support from offspring.\nReciprocity of support.--Table 2 also includes findings\nfrom a model with parental support of offspring as the inde-\npendent variable. Offspring who reported receiving more\nsupport from parents provided more overall support to par-\nents and more of each type of support, except technologi-\ncal support. Parents reported receiving more overall support\nand more of each type of support when they provided off-\nspring with more support (See Supplementary Table 3).\nDiscussion\nThis study examined intergenerational support from\nyoung adults to their middle-aged parents. Overall, we\nfound that patterns of support evident in middle and older\nadulthood may originate in earlier adulthood. Consistent\nwith solidarity theory (Schwarz et al., 2005; Silverstein\net al., 2002), young adults provided more support to par-\nents when they had better quality relations and when they\nreceived more support from their parents. However, unlike\nsupport patterns in late life (Eggebeen & Davey, 1998; Katz\net al., 2010), parental needs were not as salient a predictor\nof offspring support during young adulthood, particularly\nfrom the parents' perspective.\nWe also found that middle-aged parents reported receiv-\ning less support than young adult offspring reported provid-\ning, which is consistent with studies of parents and offspring\nin later life (Kim et al., 2011). This finding may have impli-\ncations for each party's well-being. In the United States,\nyoung adults who report giving support are associated with\nhigher levels of positive mood (Gleason, Iida, Bolger, &\nShrout, 2003), whereas older adults receiving support from\noffspring report worse psychological outcomes (Thomas,\n2010). Thus, differences in parents' and offspring's reports\nmay be important for their well-being.\nTypes of Support Young Adult Offspring Provide Parents\nYoung adult offspring provided multiple types of support\nto parents. As expected, a high proportion of parents and\noffspring reported lending a listening ear and offering emo-\ntional support. Providing money to parents, however, was\nless frequent. These findings may reflect the characteristics\nof emerging adulthood. During encounters in which parents\nprovide support (Fingerman, Cheng, Tighe, Birditt, & Zarit,\n2012), young adults may have opportunities to reciprocate\nFigure 1. Percent of parents and offspring reporting offspring support at least once a month for each type of support.\nwith nontangible support, such as listening or companion-\nship. Meanwhile, the paucity of monetary support may\nreflect a dearth of material resources in emerging adulthood\nWe expected technological support to be frequent\nbecause young adults are likely to use the latest technolo-\ngies (Charness, Fox, & Mitchum, 2011), but only around\nhalf of the offspring provided such assistance at least once\na month. Parents may not need technological support, such\nas suggestions about computer programs, on a weekly or\ndaily basis. This is not to say that technology plays no role\nin support between parents and offspring. For example,\ncell phones or social networking programs may facilitate\nparents and offspring to provide other types of support.\nHowever, new technological devices that facilitate com-\nmunication may also increase distractions when parents\nsocialize with offspring. Given the complexity of today's\ntechnological developments, future studies should examine\nthe role of different aspects of technological use and sup-\nport in intergenerational ties.\nThis study also suggests that support patterns in later life\nmay have roots in young adulthood. Silverstein and col-\nleagues (2002) found that when parents and young adult off-\nspring spent more time together (e.g., having conversations,\ntalking about important matters, having dinner together),\noffspring provided up to five types of support to their par-\nents 26 years later. Our study further indicated that young\nadults also may reciprocate parental support concurrently.\nFurthermore, young adults who spend more time with their\nparents (e.g., listening, companionship, advice, and emo-\ntional support) may set up a future pattern of support to\nparents.\nThis pattern also may be evident with regard to caregiv-\ners in late life. Family systems theory emphasizes that\nthe family members' shared values about family tend to\nshape behaviors over time (Fingerman & Bermann, 2000).\nEmpirical research has found that older mothers prefer the\nsame offspring to be their caregivers across time, especially\nthose who provided expressive or instrumental support to\nthem (Suitor et al., 2013). Therefore, young adults who pro-\nvide more support to their middle-aged parents may provide\ncaregiving in the future.\nDiscrepancies in Offspring and Parents Reports of\nSupport\nAs expected, parents reported receiving less support\nthan offspring reported providing.

This tendency\nis consistent with Erikson's (1950) lifespan theory regard-\ning generativity in midlife.Young adults may also engage in\nself-enhancement by believing they provide more to parents\nto compensate for receiving a lot of support from parents.\nReasons Why Grown Children Provide Support\nReasons underlying young adults' support of parents\nwere consistent with theoretical perspectives explaining\nwhy offspring provide support later in middle adulthood.\nFurthermore, both offspring's and parents' reports showed\nthat factors regarding solidarity and reciprocity theory were\nassociated with young adult offspring's support to parents.\nParental needs.--Young adults reported providing finan-\ncial support rarely, but they did provide monetary support\nwhen parents experience personal problems. Offspring\nreported responding to personal problems, including\ndivorce and relationship crises. These findings contrast\nwith past findings that parental crises, such as divorce dur-\ning childhood, are not associated with support provided by\ngrown biological offspring (Aquilino, 1994). It is possible\nthat young adults in more recent cohorts are more likely to\nbe in contact with their parents (Furstenberg, 2010), so that\nparents who are undergoing a relationship problem may be\nmore accessible to them. In addition, the patterns observed\nregarding parental divorce in childhood may reflect a loss\nof relationship closeness between parent and child follow-\ning divorce; this may not be the case for young adults who\ncontinue to have strong bonds with their parents.\nWe failed to find an association between parents' reports of\npersonal problems or disability and support from their adult\noffspring. Parents who experience problems or disabilities\nmay receive support from other social partners so that ado-\nlescents and young adult children may serve supplementary\nroles, whereas other family members are primary supporters\n(Levine et al., 2005). It is also possible that the support from\noffspring to parents is invisible, which may promote parents'\nadjustments to stressors (Bolger, Zuckerman, Kessler, 2000).\nClose intergenerational ties.--The solidarity theory sug-\ngests that positive quality relationships go hand-in-hand\nwith intergenerational support (Bengtson et al., 2002). In\nthis study, good relationships may be associated with more\ntime spent with parents when opportunities for support\noccur, except for financial support.\nReciprocity of support.--Reciprocity of intergenera-\ntional support was evident in offspring's and parents'\nreports. In late life, middle-aged adults provide support to\naging parents who currently help or have helped them in\nyoung adulthood (Eggebeen & Davey, 1998; Leopold &\nRaab, 2011). Similarly, in young adulthood, intergenera-\ntional exchanges may be bidirectional, with offspring pro-\nviding support when they also receive support (Fingerman\nLimitations and Future Directions\nThere are several limitations to this study. Although we\nused a socioeconomically and ethnically diverse sample, the\noffspring who participated tend to be those who had better\nquality relationships and who exchanged more frequent sup-\nport with their parents than their siblings who did not partici-\npate. This selection bias may reflect parental favoritism in\nthis study may have overestimated the amount of support the\naverage young adult child provides to parents.\nThis study used cross-sectional data and did not have\nenough information to examine the differences between\nthe support from young adult and middle-aged offspring.\nTherefore, we cannot empirically investigate offspring's\npatterns of support over time. Additional studies are neces-\nsary to compare support patterns across three generations\nand to ascertain whether support patterns among young\nadults carry over into late life.\nIn summary, this study suggests the endurance of family\nrelationships into the adult years, which go beyond affec-\ntion or obligation to children and include ongoing mutual\nengagement and support. In young adulthood, offspring\nprovided support to parents in repayment for parental\ninvestment and within the context of high-quality relation-\nships, whereas parental needs may not be as a salient pre-\ndictor of offspring support.\nSupplementary Material\nSupplementary material can be found at: http://psychsocgerontology.\noxfordjournals.org/.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National Institute on Aging of the\nand AG029879 to K.
