    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Previous studies have shown that angiotensin II AT1 receptor gene (AT1R) polymorphisms are associated\nwith the risk for hypertension. However, the results remain controversial. In the present study, we performed a meta-\nanalysis to systematically summarize the association between AT1R genetic polymorphisms and the risk for hypertension.\nMethods: We searched the literature in PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, Wanfang, and Chinese National\nKnowledge Infrastructure databases (CNKI) to find case-control studies on the associations of AT1R genetic\npolymorphisms with the risk for hypertension. The meta-analysis was performed by using RevMan 5.0 software. The\nassociation of hypertension risk with AT1R genetic polymorphism was estimated by pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95%\nconfidence intervals (95% CIs).\nResults: Fifty-six studies involving 28,952 subjects were included in the present meta-analysis. Our results suggest that\nthe polymorphism (A1166C) of AT1R gene is associated with a statistically increased hypertension risk, not only in Asian\npopulations but also in Caucasian populations. We did not find any association in African populations.\nConclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that A1166C polymorphism in the AT1R gene is associated with the risk of\nhypertension in Asian and Caucasian populations.\n",

It is considered that hypertension is a com-\nplex disease resulting from the interaction between genetic\npolymorphisms and environmental factors.2 Recently, many\ngenes have been identified as candidates for contribution to\nhypertension.3 Of these, the angiotensin II AT1 receptor\n(AT1R) plays an important role in normal blood pressure\nregulation and in the pathophysiological progression of\nhypertension.4\u00ad6 The polymorphisms of the AT1R gene have\nbeen reported to be associated with the pathogenesis of\nhypertension.7\u00ad9 In particular, a single nucleotide polymor-\nphism (SNP), A1166C, is the most studied variant being\nlocated in the 3 untranslated region of the AT1R gene.10\nSeveral studies have indicated that A1166C polymor-\nphism is associated with hypertension.11,12 However, this\nassociation has not been confirmed in other reports.13,14 In\n2010, Wang et al. conducted a meta-analysis assessing the\nAssociation of AT1R polymorphism with\nhypertension risk: An update meta-analysis\nDong-Xing Liu1, Yu-Qing Zhang2, Bo Hu1, Jianfeng Zhang3 and\nQiang Zhao3\n Keywords\nGenetic polymorphism, hypertension, meta-analysis, angiotensin II AT1 receptor\nEmergency Department, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to\nShandong University, Jinan, China\n2Health Division, The People's Hospital of HuaiYin, Jinan, China\nDepartment of Cardiac Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, School of Medicine,\nShanghai Jiao Tong University, China\nDong-Xing Liu and Yu-Qing Zhang contributed equally to this work.\nCorresponding authors:\nQiang Zhao, Department of Cardiac Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, School of\nMedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200025, China.\nBo Hu, Emergency Department and Shandong Provincial Hospital\nAffiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, China.\nOriginal Article\nassociation of the AT1R gene A1166C polymorphism with\nhypertension in the Chinese population; this indicated that\nthe AT1R C allele carriers have a higher risk for hyperten-\nsion.15 Niu and Qi also performed a meta-analysis and\nfound that the AT1R C allele conferred an increased risk of\nhypertension.16 However, in these two meta-analyses, the\nnumber of the included studies was rather small. In recent\nyears, many new large-sample-size case-control studies\nhave been conducted.11\u00ad14 Therefore, to further assess the\nrelation between AT1R gene polymorphism and hyperten-\nsion, we performed a carefully designed meta-analysis\nMethods\nSelection of studies\nWe conducted a systematic computerized literature search for\nstudies published before 1 December 2014. We searched the\nliterature in PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science,\nWanfangdatabaseinChina,andChineseNationalKnowledge\nInfrastructure (CNKI) database with the following search\nterms: \"hypertension\" and \"angiotensin II type 1 receptor\" or\n\"AT1R\" and \"polymorphism\" or \"SNP\", or \"mutation\" or\n\"variant\", by two independent investigators. The publication\ndate and language were not restricted in the present study.All\nstudies which met to the inclusion criteria were retrieved for\nfurther examination and data extraction.\nSelection criteria\nStudies satisfying the following criteria were included: 1)\nreported the relation between the AT1R genetic polymor-\nphism and susceptibility to hypertension; 2) definition of\nhypertension as systolic (or diastolic) blood pressure 140\nmmHg (or 90 mmHg) or treatment with antihypertensive\nmedication; 3) in a case-control using either a hospital-\nbased or a population-based design; 4) detailed genotype\ndata were provided for the calculation of odds ratio (OR)\nand 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Studies that\nfocused on juvenile hypertension or secondary forms of\nhypertension such as pregnancy-induced hypertension\nwere excluded from this study.\nData extraction\nTwo researchers performed the data extraction indepen-\ndently. The following information from all eligible studies\nwere obtained: first author's last name, year of publica-\ntion, ethnicity of the population studied, study design,\nnumber of subjects in each category, baseline characteris-\ntics of the study population, and the number of persons\nwith different genotypes in cases and controls and the\ngenotyping methods.\nStatistical analysis\nThe RevMan 5.0 software was employed for the present\nmeta-analysis. The Hardy\u00adWeinberg equilibrium was\nestimated by the 2-test. We performed analyses under\nthe dominant model (CC+AC vs. AA), recessive model\n(CC vs. AC+AA), and additive model (C vs. A). We uti-\nlized Q-test and I2 test to examine the heterogeneity\nbetween each study. By heterogeneity test, if I2 < 50%,\nwe select the fixed effect model to merge OR. If I2 >\n50%, we selected the random effect model to merge OR.\nSensitivity analysis and publication bias analysis were\ntested using RevMan 5.0 statistical software. The statis-\ntical significance of the pooled OR was determined with\nthe Z test, and a p value of <0.05 was considered\nsignificant.\nResults\nBaseline characteristics\nmorphism and hypertension were retrieved after first\nsearch in PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science,\nWanfang in China, and CNKI databases. As shown in\nFigure 1, after excluding duplicated publications or those\nthat did not meet the inclusion criteria, we included 56\ncharacteristics of each study are summarized in Table 1.\ntensive patients and 14,290 healthy control subjects).\nThere were 39 studies carried out in Asian popula-\ntwo studies involved an African population.17,18\nMeta-analysis\nAs shown inTable 2. we found the polymorphism (A1166C)\nof AT1R gene was associated with a statistically increased\nhypertension risk ((AC+CC) vs. AA: OR = 1.44 (95% CI:\n(Figures 2 to 4). In the subgroup analyses, the association\nwas also significant among studies using Asian populations\nin all genetic models ((AC+CC) vs. AA: OR = 1.41 (95%\nfound an association in a dominant model ((AC+CC) vs.\nrecessive model ((AA+AC) vs. CC: OR = 0.81 (95% CI:\n900 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)\nCaucasian populations. We did not found any association in\nAfrican populations ((AC+CC) vs. AA: OR = 2.53 (95%\nPublication bias\nThe publication bias test of the literature was conducted\nusing a funnel plot and Egger's test. Symmetrical funnel\nplots were obtained in the SNP tested in all of the models,\nwhich displayed no publication bias (Figure 5). Egger's\ntest further confirmed the absence of publication bias in\nthis meta-analysis (all p > 0.05, data not shown).\nSensitivity analysis\nWe removed one single study from the overall pooled\nanalysis each time to check the influence of the removed\ndata set to the overall ORs. The pooled ORs and 95% CIs\nwere not significantly altered when any part of the study\nwas omitted, which indicated that any single study had lit-\ntle impact on the overall ORs and the results of this meta-\nanalysis were stable.\nDiscussion\nThe present study aimed to explore the association of the\namong a total of 28,952 subjects via a meta-analysis. We\ndemonstrated that the AT1R gene 1166C allele carriers\nhave higher risk for hypertension in Asian and Caucasian\npopulation, but not in African population.\nMeta-analysis is a powerful tool for summarizing\nresults from different studies by producing a single eval-\nuation of the major effect. Genetic association studies\nhave a tendency to lack the power to detect a statistically\nsignificant association with complex diseases, especially\nstudies with small sample sizes. To achieve a satisfactory\npower, meta-analysis of multiple studies clearly has a\nrole in offering an association study with such potentials.\nIn the present study, we collected 56 case-control studies\ninvolving 28,952 subjects in this meta-analysis to clarify\nthe relation between AT1R genetic polymorphism and\nhypertension. We found a significant association between\nC allele and the increased risk of essential hypertension.\nIn the stratified analysis, we divided these studies into\ndifferent subgroups by race of the participants. Significant\nassociation between hypertension and the A1166C poly-\nmorphism was observed in both Asian and Caucasian\npopulations, but not in African populations. Our results\nwere in line with a previous meta-analysis in a Chinese\npopulation. However, the mechanism responsible for the\nassociation of hypertension risk with A1166C polymor-\nphism remains unclear. A1166C polymorphism is in a\nnon-coding region of AT1R gene, and therefore the amino\nacid sequence of the AT1 receptor is not altered. The lack\nFigure 1.

The diamond represents the pooled results of OR and 95% CI.\nof a functional role of the A1166C polymorphism makes\nthis SNP somewhat unappealing as a \"true\" influence of\nhypertension susceptibility. However, the A1166C poly-\nmorphism might affect mRNA stability and transcription,\nor alternatively be in linkage disequilibrium with other\nfunctional polymorphisms. Therefore, the functional\nstudy of this variant was expected in the future.\nFurthermore, we did not find the publication bias.\nSensitivity analysis also showed that omission of any single\nstudy did not have significant impact on the combined ORs.\nThis made the results of this meta-study more reliable to some\nextent. However, we found significant heterogeneity among\nall the included studies. This heterogeneity may result from\nstudy design of included studies. Two kinds control sources-\nhospital-based controls and population-based controls were\nused in the studies. The hospital-based controls might have\nselection biases and might not be representative of the general\npopulation. In addition, three races including Asian,\nCaucasian, andAfrican populations were involved in the pre-\nsent study. This fact may be another source of heterogeneity.\nThere were also some limitations in this meta-analysis.\nFirstly, some clinical factors such as age, sex may affect\nthe hypertension risk. In the present study, we did not\nadjust these confounders. Determining whether or not\nthese factors influence the results of this meta-analysis\nwould need further investigation. Secondly, this meta-\nanalysis only focused on papers published in the English\nand Chinese language. Thirdly, the cross-sectional nature\nof our included studies precludes comments on causality.\nFinally, in this study, we only focused on the AT1R gene\nA1166 C polymorphism and did not evaluate other poly-\nmorphisms in the AT1R gene, leading to the possibility\nthat the potential role of the A1166 C polymorphism is\ndiluted or masked by other gene\u00adgene or gene\u00adenviron-\nment interactions.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, this meta-analysis clarified the association\nof A1166C polymorphism in AT1R gene of the risk of\nhypertension. The presence of AT1R gene 1166C allele is\nassociated with an increased risk of hypertension in Asian\nand Caucasian populations.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by Shandong Province medical and\nhealth science and technology development projects (grant num-\nReferences\n1.
