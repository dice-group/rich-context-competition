The largest proportion of\nfamily caregivers--36%--provide care for a parent.2\nProviding care to disabled elderly parents has been associ-\nated with considerable strain, burden, psychological distress,\nand poorer physical health.3\u00ad8 Research across multiple types\nof family caregiving has suggested that caregivers are at risk\nof poorer immune system functioning, increased rates of\ninfectious illness, and other biological vulnerabilities that\ncan increase the risk of health problems.9\nNonetheless, while growing evidence from caregiving\nresearch suggests that providing caregiving is linked to poten-\ntial adverse effects on caregivers' physical health, relatively\nlittle of this research has addressed associations between car-\negiving and underlying biological factors linked to health.7\nThe limited number of studies that have investigated biologi-\ncal factors among caregivers10\u00ad13 have been typically based on\nnonrandom samples, have typically assessed only one or a few\nindividual biological markers, and/or have not differentiated\ncaregivers by caregiving relationship type--a difference that\nhas been shown to be important in previous research.14\u00ad16\nAdditionally, gender differences in caregiving research related\nto biological risks have not been consistently examined.\nTo address some of the limitations of previous research,\nthe purpose of this exploratory study was to use data from a\nUS national survey to examine the associations between one\nspecific type of family caregiving--care for a biological or\nadoptive parent--and four clinically assessed biological risk\nfactor indices (a 15-item assessment of allostatic load (AL)\nFilial caregiving is associated with greater\nneuroendocrine dysfunction: Evidence\nfrom the 2005 National Survey of Midlife\nin the United States\nSunWoo Kang1 and Nadine F Marks2\n Keywords\nCaregiving, gender, allostatic load, metabolic, inflammatory, neuroendocrine, hypothalamic\u00adpituitary\u00adadrenal axis,\nbiological risk\nDepartment of Counseling and Human Development, South Dakota\nState University, Brookings, SD, USA\nHuman Development and Family Studies, University of Wisconsin\u00ad\nMadison, Madison, WI, USA\nCorresponding author:\nSunWoo Kang, Department of Counseling and Human Development,\nEmail: sunwoo.kang@sdstate.edu\nOriginal Article\n2 SAGE Open Medicine\nand its three composite subscales: inflammatory dysfunction,\nmetabolic dysfunction, and neuroendocrine dysfunction), as\nwell as moderation of these associations by gender.\nTheoretical and empirical foundation\nBiopsychosocial approach to health\nIn recent biomedical studies, models taking a biopsychoso-\ncial approach to health have become more prominent. These\nmodels help highlight how psychosocial factors such as\nextreme/chronic stress can potentially have adverse effects on\nbiological factors related to health.17 Also, the biopsychoso-\ncial approach posits that psychosocial factors have impact on\nbiological factors by predisposing the individual to additional\npsychosocial risk factors, which can have indirect influences\non health. For example, extreme stress can directly lead to\nbiological changes linked to heart disease but also can lead\nthe person to be more likely to be depressed and use alcohol,\nwhich, in turn, can also contribute to problematic physical\nhealth. Therefore, the effects of problematic psychosocial\nfactors (e.g. stressful events, chronic stresses) can cause an\nincreased probability of having physical health problems,\nbiopsychosocial diseases, and/or higher mortality.18\nDiverse empirical studies on caregiving and health have\nindicated that family caregiving is a stressful life challenge\nthat typically includes various psychosocial stressors that\ncan be hazardous to caregivers' health.7 Additionally, sub-\nstantial research has demonstrated the association between\ncaregiving and poorer mental health,4 which, in turn, is an\nexample of another psychosocial factor that might be\nexpected to problematically influence physical health.\nDrawing upon the biopsychosocial model's assumptions\nregarding the associations between stressful psychosocial\nfactors and their effects on biological health factors and\nphysical health, this study examined associations between\nfilial caregiving (vs noncaregiving) and health-related bio-\nlogical risk factors.\nA life course perspective on caregiving\nThis study was also guided by a life course theoretical per-\nspective on caregiving. The life course principle of \"linked\nlives\"19 draws attention to how family members' develop-\nmental trajectories (including mental and physical health tra-\njectories) are consequentially interdependent and \"linked\"\nacross time. Therefore, transitions and experiences of one\nmember of a family (e.g. an elder experiencing a transition to\ngreater disability or frailty) might be expected to have devel-\nopmental consequences for other members of the family\n(e.g. an adult child who observes undesirable change in a\nparent's health and transitions into taking a greater role in\nproviding care for his or her parent).\nThe life course perspective additionally guides us to con-\nsider important contextual factors when considering the\ndevelopmental effects of a role, such as a caregiving role.20\nThere is considerable evidence that in contemporary society,\nthe social script for a caregiver role is gendered; that is, nor-\nmative expectations for caregiving are typically different for\nwomen in contrast to men.21,22 Women more often assume\nthe role of primary caregiver (in contrast to secondary car-\negiver) than men; women typically engage in more hands-on\ntasks, especially intimate personal care than men;21,22 and\nwomen are socialized to view caregiving as a more salient\nrole in their role-identity repertoires than men and to be more\nempathetic to the suffering of a loved one than men, thereby\nmaking them even more vulnerable to compromised well-\nbeing when stresses in this role occur.23 Additionally, the\noverall structural disadvantages of women in gender rela-\ntions in contemporary societies (e.g. lower incomes in simi-\nlar work roles, more responsibilities for child care and other\nextended kinship care, greater overall economic vulnerabil-\nity) would lead us to expect that men might suffer less and\nwomen might suffer more in a caregiving role.24 Nonetheless,\nan alternative hypothesis might be that due to being less\nsocialized to anticipate a caregiving role, less socialized to\nfeel comfortable seeking help when stresses accumulate, and\nperhaps having less access to a larger social support network,\nmen might have their own unique health risks in a caregiving\nrole.25 Given these considerations, a life course perspective\nguided us to consider potential gender differences in health\nrisk for a filial caregiving role.\nAL\nWhile considerable research on caregiving and physical\nhealth relies on self-reported survey measures, it is also valu-\nable to consider clinically assessed health-related biological\nrisk factors to understand even more clearly the mechanisms\nwhereby caregiving may get \"under the skin\" and influence\nphysical health. AL has been developed as a concept to cap-\nture the idea of overall level of cumulative biological system\ndysfunction resulting from stress overload.26 This is relevant\nto caregiving in that evidence from previous studies suggests\nthat caregiving can be an acute stress for caregivers, and long-\nterm caregiving can often be a chronic stress for caregivers.5\nHuman body systems respond to both body states and\nexternal environments by adaptation activities. This adapta-\ntion process includes reactions by the neuroendocrine (hypo-\nthalamic\u00adpituitary\u00adadrenal (HPA) axis/sympathetic nervous\nsystem (SNS)), the inflammatory/immune system, and the\nmetabolic/cardiovascular system. The allostasis response of\nthese systems is activated rapidly when individuals are cop-\ning with a certain challenge and adaptation and turned off\nwhen they do not need to be activated. However, these sys-\ntems become dangerous and lead to health risks when they\nare overly stressed, and breakdowns occur such that they are\nnot turned off or turned down appropriately. Additionally,\nwhen these systems cannot be turned on when needed, this\ninappropriate response can also produce a load on the body\nKang and Marks 3\ncausing lack of normal protection and undesirable elevation\nof other systems' activity.26 Adversity and stressful circum-\nstances (e.g. caregiving) are likely to accelerate pathophysi-\nological processes and lead to higher chances of morbidity\nand mortality and more susceptibility to cardiovascular dis-\nAlthough some studies of caregiving and biological risk\nhave evaluated one biomarker measure or another (e.g. cor-\ntisol, interleukin-6 (IL-6)), a cumulative measure of bio-\nmarkers that constitutes a more complete assessment of AL\nhas shown promise as a measure of overall underlying health\nrisk in other areas of gerontological health research. Seeman\net al.27 helped formulate the theoretical rationale for AL\nmeasurement and further led in operationalizing AL utilizing\na risk factor \"count\" measure based on 10 biomarkers,\nincluding measures of systolic blood pressure, diastolic\nblood pressure, waist\u00adhip ratio (WHR), high-density lipo-\nproteins (HDLs), total cholesterol, blood plasma levels of\nglycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), serum dehydroepian-\ndrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S; a functional HPA axis antago-\nnist), C excretion (an integrated measure of 12-h HPA axis\nactivity), norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Utilizing data\nfrom a sample of over a thousand relatively healthy adults\naged 70\u00ad79 years participating in the MacArthur Study of\nSuccessful Aging, they demonstrated that cross-sectionally\nAL was linked to poorer baseline physical functioning and\ncognitive performance. Additionally, they began to establish\nthe predictive validity (over 2.5 years) of AL by providing\nevidence that it predicted greater declines in physical health\nstatus and cognitive status and a trend toward a greater inci-\ndence of problematic CVD events (controlling for sociode-\nmographic characteristics and baseline health status).\nImportantly, in this initial study, they also established that no\none biomarker predicted these same declines and CVD\nevents--providing evidence that a measure that includes\nmultisystemic biomarker components has added value over\nindividual measures in capturing the biological changes that\npredict health decline and mortality.\nSeeman et al.28 extended this program of work utilizing\n7-year longitudinal data from the MacArthur Study of\nSuccessful Aging to further investigate the predictive valid-\nity of AL and added more evidence of significant associa-\ntions between higher AL scores and increased risks of\nmortality, greater declines in cognitive functioning, and\ngreater declines in physical functioning over time.\nRecent theorizing on AL has highlighted the value of\nincluding biomarkers related to inflammatory dysfunction in\nAL measurement (the original measure only included bio-\nmarkers related to metabolic dysfunction and neuroendo-\ncrine dysfunction) and has also suggested the possibility that\nvarious systems' components of AL may be sequentially\naffected over time in the stress process. For example, it may\nbe that stress first results in neuroendocrine dysfunction,\nwhich later also leads to inflammatory dysfunction, which,\nin turn, may also provoke metabolic dysfunction.29,30 Such\ntemporal theorizing suggests the value of examining the\nunderlying systemic components of AL separately, as well as\nexamining a total AL score.\nA recent review of 58 studies using AL to explore how\nstress is linked to cognitive and physical health29 provides a\nconsiderable accumulation of evidence regarding the value of\nAL as a tool to help evaluate individuals at higher risk of\nadverse health outcomes. Establishing the predictive validity\nofAL for future health outcomes has also brought more atten-\ntion to the importance of understanding factors that help pre-\ndict higher levels of AL and that might help buffer the impact\nof stressors on AL--including psychosocial factors such as\nhistories of social relationships and social integration.31,32\nGiven the important demonstrated associations between\nmeasures of AL and health, and its relevance to the potential\nfor the stresses of caregiving to impact current and future\nhealth and mortality, this study explored the associations\nbetween caregiving and AL operationalized by a cumulative\nmeasure of 15 health-related biological indicators. We also\nseparately examined three subscales of this full AL scale,\nincluding measures indicating neuroendocrine dysfunction\n(four-item subscale: cortisol, norepinephrine, epinephrine,\nand DHEA), inflammatory dysfunction (five-item subscale:\nIL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), E-selectin, intercellular\nadhesion molecule (ICAM), and fibrinogen), and metabolic\ndysfunction (six-item subscale: systolic blood pressure, dias-\ntolic blood pressure, WHR, cholesterol, hemoglobin, and\nHDL-cholesterol).\nEmpirical research linking caregiving and\nbiological factors linked to health\nA number of studies have indicated health-related biological\nfactor risks linked to caregiving. For example, Clark et al.33\nexamined the association between caregiving and AL across\n80 spousal caregivers of dementia patients, 120 veteran car-\negivers, and 60 noncaregivers. Results suggested that the AL\nscore increased over 2 years among caregivers, whereas there\nwas no significant increase over time among noncaregivers.\nStudies have also indicated that compared to noncaregiv-\ners, caregivers demonstrate poorer immune function, slower\nwound healing, or dysregulation of natural killer cell activ-\nity;13,34\u00ad36 are at greater risk to have elevated levels of prob-\nlematic inflammatory markers in their blood and evidence of\nwhile researchers have demonstrated that caregivers have\nmore physiological problems across these multiple domains\nthan noncaregivers, few studies have used nationally repre-\nsentative data, focused specifically on filial caregivers,\nincluded sociodemographic controls also associated with\nhealth, and included a noncaregiver comparison group in\ntheir research designs.\nTherefore, guided by the biopsychosocial model of health,\nand the accumulating overall evidence suggesting a link\n4 SAGE Open Medicine\nbetween caregiving and negative effects on biological health\nrisk factors, in this exploratory population study, we hypoth-\nesized that filial caregiving would be linked to more prob-\nlematic levels of biological risk (as assessed by AL and\nsubscales of AL).\nGender differences in associations between filial\ncaregiving and biological health\nOverall, research to date suggests that women caregivers\nexperience poorer global health than men caregivers,9,44\nalthough there is also some evidence that men caregivers are\nat more risk of poorer immune function45 and metabolic dys-\nfunction.46,47 Very few studies of caregiving and biological\nhealth indicators have examined gender differences in\nresearch designs that include both caregivers and noncar-\negivers. And we have not found a previous study that has\nfocused specifically on potential gender differences in filial\ncaregiving influences on biological factors. Therefore,\nguided by the available empirical research on caregiving and\nphysical health, in this exploratory population study, we\nhypothesized that women filial caregivers would exhibit\nhigher levels of biological health factor risks (as measured\nby AL and its subscales) than men filial caregivers.\nMethods\nData and analytic sample\nData for our analyses came from the national random digit\ndialing (RDD) sample of the National Survey of Midlife in\nnoninstitutionalized, English-speaking adults living in the\ntelephone survey and a mail-back self-administered ques-\ntionnaire. Follow-up data collection took place about 9 years\nlater (Time 2 (T2): 2005). Siblings and a national twin sam-\nple were also included in the T2 study. The MIDUS website\nprovides details regarding the data set and data collection\nprocedures (http://midmac.med.harvard.edu/research.html).\nThe analytic sample for this study included 962 adults\nparticipated in the biomarker study (a randomly generated\nsubset of T2 survey respondents who came in for 2 days of\nclinical assessment to one of three regional medical centers\nafter completing the telephone survey and self-administered\nmail-back survey). Caregiving status was not explicitly\nassessed at MIDUS T1, but it was added and assessed via the\nMIDUS phone questionnaire at T2 (see more in section\n\"Independent variables\" below). Due to our research focus\non the relationship between filial caregiving, gender, and\nclinically assessed biological risk factors, we limited our\nanalytic sample to T2 national survey main respondents and\ntwin respondents who participated in the MIDUS biomarker\nstudy and who in the telephone survey reported either\n(1) they were not providing caregiving for anyone or (2) they\nwere a caregiver for a parent. (This excluded 6% of the T2\nsample who were \"other\" types of caregivers from the ana-\nlytic sample. See more details on the caregiving status meas-\nure later in this section.)\nOutcome variables\nAL.Following the precedent of Seeman et al.27,28 and the\nmajority of studies that have used an AL measure,29 this\nstudy used a risk factor \"count\" scale to assess respondents'\nAL. Our scale also included items assessing inflammatory\ndysfunction and therefore was a 15-item scale (in contrast to\nthe original 10-item scale developed by Seeman et al.27). Our\nAL total scale included indicators of systolic blood pressure,\ndiastolic blood pressure, WHR, cholesterol, hemoglobin,\nHDL, cholesterol, cortisol, norepinephrine, epinephrine,\nDHEA, IL-6, CRP, E-selectin, ICAM, and fibrinogen. Fol-\nlowing previous precedent in creating AL scales,27,28 quartile\nvalues for all 15 items were calculated to create dichotomous\nvariables for each item where 1 = high-risk quartile (i.e. high\nrisk = being in highest quarter of the distribution for systolic\nblood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, WHR, cholesterol,\nhemoglobin, cortisol, norepinephrine, epinephrine, IL-6,\nCRP, E-selectin, ICAM, and fibrinogen and high risk =\nbeing in lowest quarter of the distribution for HDL-choles-\nterol and DHEA) and 0 = otherwise. Note that overall, clini-\ncal cut points for risk for most of these variables have not\nbeen established, and typically there have not been different\ncut points for risk suggested for women in contrast to men--\nwith one exception. WHR functions differently for men and\nwomen. Therefore, in the case of this one variable in the\nindex, we used the top quarter cut point to signify high risk\nbased on gender-separate distributions. The total AL varia-\nble was created by summing across the 15 dichotomous vari-\nables for \"high risk\": systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood\npressure, WHR, cholesterol, hemoglobin, HDL-cholesterol,\ncortisol, norepinephrine, epinephrine, DHEA, IL-6, CRP,\nE-selectin, ICAM, and fibrinogen (range 0\u00ad15). (See descrip-\ntives for all analytic variables in Table 1. See correlations for\nall analytic variables in Table 2.)\nInflammatory dysfunction.This study also evaluated a five-\nitem subscale of the full AL measure described above to\nassess respondents' inflammatory dysfunction. The inflam-\nmatory dysfunction subscale variable was created by sum-\nming five of the dichotomous variables noted above for the\nAL scale: IL-6, CRP, E-selectin, ICAM, and fibrinogen\nMetabolic dysfunction.This study also examined a six-item\nsubscale of the full AL scale to separately assess respond-\nents'metabolic dysfunction. The metabolic dysfunction vari-\nable was created by summing six of the dichotomous\nhigh-risk variables noted above for the AL scale: systolic\nKang and Marks 5\nblood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, WHR, cholesterol,\nhemoglobin, and HDL-cholesterol (range 0\u00ad6).\nNeuroendocrine dysfunction. This study also used a four-item\nsubscale of the full AL scale to assess respondents' neuroen-\ndocrine dysfunction. The neuroendocrine dysfunction varia-\nble was created by summing four of the dichotomous\nhigh-risk variables noted for the AL scale: cortisol, norepi-\nnephrine, epinephrine, and DHEA (range 0\u00ad4).\nIndependent variables\nCaregiving status.In the phone questionnaire at T2, partici-\npants were asked whether during the last 12 months they had\ngiven personal care for a period of 1 month or more to a fam-\nily member or a friend because of a physical or mental condi-\ntion, illness, or disability. Respondents who answered \"yes\"\nwere asked to indicate to whom they gave the most personal\ncare (relationship type: husband, wife, son, daughter, father,\nmother, brother, sister, etc.). For this study, focused solely\non filial care, we created a dichotomous variable--parent\ncare--which was coded 1 if the respondent indicated they\nhad provided caregiving to a biological or adoptive mother\nrespondents had answered \"no\" they did not provide any per-\nsonal care to this extent to a family member or a friend dur-\n431). Respondents who indicated they provided any other\ntype of caregiving (e.g. spousal care, child care, parent-in-\nlaw care, other kin care, nonkin care) were excluded from\nthis analysis.\nDemographic control variables.Given findings from previous\nstudies indicating that a number of sociodemographic varia-\nbles are associated with physical health,49,50 we controlled for\nseveral of these factors to avoid confounding effects: gender\n(dichotomous, 1 = female), respondents' age (continuous),\nhousehold income (continuous, including respondents'reports\nof income from all sources, as well as their reports of all\nspousal income), educational attainment (continuous, using\ncategories: 1 = no school/some grade school (1\u00ad6) to 12 =\nPhD, EdD, MD, DDS, LLD, JD, or other professional degree),\nrace/ethnicity (dichotomous, 1 = non-Hispanic White), paren-\ntal status at T2 (dichotomous, 1 = parent of a child), employ-\nment status (dichotomous, 1 = currently employed), and\nmarital status (dichotomous, 1 = currently married) at T2.\nData analysis\nOrdinary least squares multiple regression models were esti-\nmated (using pairwise deletion to maximize retention of\ncases) to investigate the associations between filial caregiv-\ning andAL and its constituent subscales.All models included\nall demographic control variables. To test our hypothesis\nregarding the main effect of filial caregiving on biological\nhealth outcomes, we estimated models for each outcome in\nwhich each outcome was regressed on the dichotomous vari-\nable (parent care) indicating whether respondents were filial\ncaregivers or not (Model 1 (M1)). To examine our hypothe-\nsis regarding moderator effects of gender on associations\nbetween filial caregiving and clinically assessed health-\nrelated biological factor, Model 2 (M2) added the interaction\nterm Female \u00d7 Parent care.\nResults\nParent care and clinically assessed biological risk\nfactors\nAL. No evidence was found that providing caregiving for a\nparent was linked to an overall higher level of AL (Table 3,\nM1, b = .46, not significant (NS)).

No evidence was found for a difference by gender in the\nassociation between levels of metabolic dysfunction and car-\negiving among parent caregivers in contrast to noncaregivers\nNeuroendocrine dysfunction. Congruent with our hypothesis,\nrespondents who reported they were providing caregiving\nfor their parents demonstrated higher levels of neuroendo-\ncrine dysfunction compared to respondents who reported\nthey were not providing any type of caregiving (Table 3, M1,\nb = .28, p  .05). No subgroup difference by gender was\nfound in the association between parent caregiving and neu-\nroendocrine dysfunction (Table 3, M2, b = -.42, NS).\nIn sum, findings indicated that providing care for a parent\nwas linked to higher levels of neuroendocrine dysfunction;\nthis association was similar for caregiving daughters and\nsons.\nDiscussion\nGuided by a biopsychosocial model, this study aimed to uti-\nlize population evidence to investigate whether caregiving\nfor a biological or adoptive parent is linked to higher levels\nof clinically assessed biological health risks among caregiv-\ners in contrast to noncaregivers, as well as to evaluate\nwhether gender moderates these health risks.\nOur results provide the first population study\u00adbased evi-\ndence of which we are aware that filial caregivers, specifi-\ncally, are at greater risk of neuroendocrine dysfunction than\nnoncaregivers, adjusting also for numerous sociodemo-\ngraphic factors. While filial caregivers demonstrated higher\nrisk of neuroendocrine dysfunction--which is a primary sys-\ntem linked to stress and adaptation, controlling reactions to\nstress, and regulating many body processes--we did not find\nthat this risk extended to our additional measures of inflam-\nmatory dysfunction and metabolic dysfunction, nor to our\noverall evaluation of AL (that combined all three of these\nsubscales).\nFilial caregiving is the most prevalent form of caregiving,\nand it is the most common type of caregiving that adults are\nlikely to experience at some point or at multiple points across\ntheir lives.2 There are somewhat different normative expec-\ntations for filial caregiving than for spousal caregiving or\ncaregiving for a disabled child,51 which may have led to\nsome earlier findings that filial caregiving is sometimes less\nproblematic for health than other types of caregiving.52\nNonetheless, empathizing with the suffering of an important\nattachment figure,23 and participating in the \"role reversal\"\nand potential physical and emotional strain that can come for\nan adult child when a parent is no longer fully capable of\ntaking care of themselves, has the potential to put filial car-\negivers at biological risk of poorer health outcomes.\nCompared to other types of caregiving, filial caregivers also\nmay be even more likely to experience the additional stress\nthat comes from having role conflicts between their internal-\nized normative expectations for filial caregiving and the\nexpectations and demands in their employment, marital/part-\nner, and parenting roles. This stress, in turn, may become\nreflected in their impaired neuroendocrine profiles.\nGiven recent interest in determining within AL whether\nthere is evidence of a temporal sequencing of biological\nTable 2. Correlations for all analytic variables.\nCaregiving status\n 1. No caregiving \u00ad \n 2. Parent care \u00ad \nBiological health outcomes\nSociodemographic factors\nKang and Marks 7\nsystems impacted by stress--for example, first neuroendocrine\ndysfunction, then immune dysfunction, leading further to meta-\nbolic dysfunction30--our results are not conclusive, but they\nmay suggest that over time filial caregivers could progress to\nother biological risks. Future research carefully tracking any\npotential progression in elevation of other biological risks\namong filial caregivers would be helpful in better mapping this\npotential temporal sequence.\nWe note here that we undertook preliminary, supplemen-\ntary analyses (not shown) where we estimated similar models\nacross a combination of filial, spousal, child, and parent-in-\nlaw caregivers in the MIDUS study. These analyses did not\nprovide evidence of a significant association between com-\nbined family caregiving and AL; there was one significant\nassociation between combined family caregiving and meta-\nbolic dysfunction, but not other subscales. No gender differ-\nences were in evidence when we examined moderating\neffects utilizing the combined family caregiving variable.\nFurther supplementary analyses (not shown) indicated that\nspousal caregiving was associated with higher levels of meta-\nbolic dysfunction--making it likely that it was this group that\nwas driving the finding for the combined family caregiving\nvariable results. Because there was a limited number of male\nspousal caregivers, it was not optimal powerwise to examine\ngender differences in the effects of spousal caregiving. We\nbelieve that these supplementary analyses also strengthen our\ncase for arguing the importance of examining each caregiving\nrelationship type separately to provide a more nuanced under-\nstanding of potential differences in caregiving type associa-\ntions with biological factors linked to health outcomes.\nRegarding our second hypothesis about gender, we did\nnot find evidence that caregiving daughters suffered more\nbiological health risk when providing care to a parent than\ncaregiving sons. Although Pinquart and Sorensen5,6 have\ndone reviews of the research that have indicated gender dif-\nferences in health among caregivers, they have also found\nevidence that gender differences are smaller in physical\nhealth than mental health outcomes,5 and they have specu-\nlated that gender differences in health may be diminishing\namong younger cohorts of persons due to more similar gen-\nder roles in contemporary society.6 Controlling for a number\nof caregiver resources and supports, Pinquart and Sorensen6\nstill found small gender differences in health among caregiv-\ners in their formal meta-analysis of studies, but these became\nsimilar to gender differences in health in the noncaregiving\npopulation. They speculated that additional resource differ-\nences between men and women that they did not adjust for\nmay have also led to these remaining differences. In this\nstudy, we did adjust for a number of additional factors that\ncan differ between men and women and that are associated\nwith health--for example, household income, employment\nstatus, race/ethnicity, marital status, and marital quality--\nand this might have also influenced our finding of no gender\ndifferences among filial caregivers in biological risks.\nIt also may be that some of the factors that have been\nhypothesized to make men more vulnerable to health risks in\ncaregiving25 are balancing out the additional stressors of car-\negiving typically observed for women.6 Our relatively\nsmaller sample of men filial caregivers in this study may\nhave also reduced our power to find gender differences.

Due\nto the lack of measurement of caregiving due to illness or\ndisability at T1 in MIDUS, we needed to conduct a cross-\nsectional analysis here, even though the data set is longitudi-\nnal. Thus, we can only describe associations here, and any\ninferences regarding causality must be considered tenuous.\nEven though this study is from a relatively large national\nsample, our sample of filial caregivers is still not very large,\nparticularly when gender differences are examined. Therefore,\nsome of our lack of finding significant associations may be due\nto power considerations and must be viewed with caution.\nAnother limitation of our study is the fact that due to the\nlimitation in our caregiving measure, respondents were clas-\nsified as caregivers without taking into account how long\nthey had been providing caregiving, the intensity of\ncaregiving (e.g. hours per week), coresidence, reasons for\ncaregiving (e.g. dementia vs surgery), and whether they were\na primary or secondary caregiver. Where we did have some\nadditional information--for example, about average hours\nper week of caregiving--we did not have sufficient sample\nsize to further create subgroups. All these factors might be\nadditional moderators of caregivers' health risk5\u00ad7,53 and\nwould be beneficial to include in future research.\nAlthough due to cell sizes we were not able to control for\nadditional differences among our caregivers, it may be of\nsome value for readers to have a little more descriptive infor-\nmation about the filial caregivers in our sample when consid-\nering our results. For example, we found that about 37% of\nthe filial caregivers in our study reported that they coresided\nwith the care recipient while the care was being provided; an\nadditional 2% reported coresiding \"some of the time.\" About\ntwo-thirds (67%) of filial caregivers reported helping with\nsuch personal care as bathing, dressing, and going to the\nbathroom. About four-fifths (80%) reported that they helped\ntheir parent with getting around inside and outside the home.\nAbout three-quarters (74%) reported helping with things like\nshopping, cooking, and housework. Almost three-quarters\n(72%) reported helping with managing money and medica-\ntions. About one-quarter (24%) reported helping their parent\nevery week of the last 12 months. But another almost two-\nthirds (65%) reported helping their parent less than half the\nweeks (i.e. less than 26 weeks) of the last year. The average\nhours of helping across the weeks helped was 14 h. The\nmodal response on caregiving hours per week was 20. This\nsupplemental information suggests that the filial caregivers\nin our study were, indeed, a heterogeneous group--varying\nin reported intensity (and potential strain) of care. In some\nrespects, this variation makes it even more noteworthy that\nwe found a significant problematic difference in neuroendo-\ncrine dysfunction for this group.\nIn sum, findings from this study, which document the\nassociation between providing filial caregiving and\ngreater neuroendocrine dysfunction risk, provide addi-\ntional empirical support for the public health importance\nof enacting policies and practices supportive of filial car-\negivers. Filial caregivers comprise the largest proportion\nof informal caregivers in contemporary society. They are\nproviding caregiving to a large number of care recipients,\nand in doing so, they may also be putting their own health\nat risk and creating a new tier of public health concern and\ncost.1 Additional research is needed to better clarify these\nrisks and evaluate factors and policy supports that may\nmitigate them.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research was supported by the National Institute on Aging\nReferences\n1.
