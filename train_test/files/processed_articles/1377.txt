We reanalyzed raw\ndata obtained from this National Survey of Ambulatory\nSurgery to select cases with an anesthesia provider and\npatient age, anesthetic type). The goal of our study was\nto estimate what percentage of cases, of a specified sur-\ngical procedure or combination of procedures, may\nhave been performed less than once per year per facil-\nity. Previous studies suggest the most important source\nof scheduling inaccuracy can be the absence of recently\nperformed cases on which to base predictions of case\nduration. We found that 36%  1% (se) of all cases in the\nUnited States were a type of procedure or combination\nof procedures that occurred 6984 times per year (the\nnumber of surgery facilities performing ambulatory\nsurgery in the United States). Approximately one third\nof all ambulatory cases were of a procedure or combina-\ntion of procedures that may have been performed as\ninfrequently as once per year per facility. This could\nimpair the effectiveness of predicting the durations of\nambulatory cases by using historical case-duration\ndata.\nOperating room (OR) managers may aim to im-\nprove OR scheduling by increasing the accuracy\nof predictions of the durations of newly sched-\nuled cases. Historical case durations stored in com-\nputer databases can be used to predict case duration\nwhen a surgeon schedules a case of the same proce-\ndure or combination of procedures as cases that the\nsurgeon has previously scheduled (1\u00ad7).\nFor purposes of predicting case duration, a case can\nbe classified based on the procedure (e.g., local exci-\nsion of breast lesion) or a combination of two or more\nprocedures (e.g., local excision of right breast lesion\nand left modified radical breast mastectomy). Classi-\nfying cases by procedure or combination of proce-\ndures is useful to account for the complexity of cases\nand can increase the accuracy of predicted case dura-\ntions. However, as there are thousands of different\nsurgical procedures, and an even greater number of\ncombinations of procedures, there may be too few like\ncases on which to base predictions of the duration of a\nnewly scheduled case (1\u00ad3).\nOur previous studies showed, by using data from\nan academic medical center, that the most important\nsource of inaccuracy in predicting the length of time to\ncomplete a series of cases in an OR for a given day can\nbe the absence of recently performed cases of the same\nprocedure or a combination of procedures (1,2). This\nabsence of historical case-duration data can also be the\nprimary reason why individual cases take longer than\nscheduled (2). Such inaccuracy in predicting case du-\nrations may affect OR utilization, increase underuti-\nlized OR time (rooms finishing earlier than predicted),\nincrease overutilized OR time (rooms finishing later\nthan predicted), and increase the number of cases not\nIt is not clear whether the absence of recently per-\nformed cases of the same procedure or combination of\nprocedures, as found at the academic medical center,\nis likely to apply at many other surgical suites. The\ngoal of this study was to analyze raw data from the\nNational Survey of Ambulatory Surgery (NSAS) to\ndetermine the relative frequency of cases of a specified\nprocedure or combination of procedures possibly per-\nformed so infrequently (e.g., less than once per year\nper facility) as to impair OR scheduling based on\ncase-duration data.\nFD is employed by the University of Iowa, in part, as a consultant\nto anesthesia groups, companies, and hospitals.\nAddress correspondence to Franklin Dexter, Department of An-\nesthesia, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242.

The sur-\nvey used a probability sample, so that nationally rep-\nresentative results could be obtained without\nsurveying every ambulatory surgery case in the\nUnited States (11,12). In particular, the probability of\nan ambulatory patient visit being included in the sur-\nvey depended on characteristics of the facility, and the\nlocation within that facility, where the patient had\nsurgery (e.g., cystoscopy room).\nThe probability of a facility being included in the\nsurvey was based on its type (hospital versus free-\nstanding), specialty, geographic region, and annual\nnumber of ambulatory surgery cases. There were\ngery facilities meeting study inclusion criteria (12).\nHospitals with fewer than six staffed beds were ex-\ncluded. Federal, military, and Department of Veterans\nAffairs hospitals were excluded. Freestanding facili-\nties included in the survey were state licensed or\ncertified by the Health Care Financing Administration\nfor Medicare participation. Facilities specializing in\ndentistry, podiatry, abortion, or child birth were ex-\ncluded. Facilities owned by a hospital but located\nsome distance away from the hospital were consid-\nered freestanding.\nOnce a facility was chosen, a systematic random\nsample was taken of ambulatory surgery visits at the\nfacility (12). For the survey, ambulatory surgery was\ndefined as scheduled outpatient (admitted and dis-\ncharged from the facility on the same day) surgery\nperformed in any of the following locations: general or\nmain OR, satellite OR, cystoscopy room, endoscopy\nroom, cardiac catheterization lab, or laser procedure\nroom (12). If patients were subsequently admitted to a\nhospital as inpatients, they were included in the survey.\nPatients originally admitted as a hospital inpatient or\nadmitted through the emergency room were excluded.\nAfter selection of ambulatory surgery visits for in-\nclusion in the survey, data from each visit were ab-\nstracted from the medical record. Staff contracted by\nthe NCHS coded the abstracted data, and assigned to\neach case from one to a maximum of six ICD-9-CM\nprocedure codes.\nOur Analysis of the Raw Data from the NSAS\nWe reanalyzed the raw data, from the survey, re-\nleased for public use on CD-ROM by the NCHS. We\nan anesthesia provider present to have been a surgical\nthose effective on a common date (October 1, 1995).\nWe limited our consideration to cases with an anes-\nthesia provider; otherwise, many of the cases the sur-\nvey considered to be surgical were medical procedures,\nsuch as cardiac catheterization and colonoscopy, per-\nformed outside of surgical suites.\nThe NCHS assigned each case a weight calculated\nby using statistical methods that considered the prob-\nability of selection of the case's facility, the probability\nof case selection from among all cases at the facility,\nand the response rates of facilities and locations within\nfacilities. The use of weights allowed the cases in-\ncluded in the survey to be used to determine nation-\nally representative results.\nIdeally, we would have used the NSAS's raw data\nto determine what percentage of cases in the United\nStates were of a procedure or combination of proce-\ndures performed only once a year at the case's facility.\nBecause of the differential weighting, we could not\ncalculate results on a per-facility basis or as a percent-\nage of cases in the survey. Instead, we report the\npercentage of cases that were of a procedure or com-\nbination of procedures performed in the United States\nbecause this was the number of surgery facilities per-\nforming ambulatory surgery in the United States (12).\nIf procedures were distributed homogeneously among\nfacilities, then, if a case was performed 6984 times per\nyear, this would give an average of one case per\nfacility per year.\nTo assess sensitivity of our results to the homoge-\nneity assumption, we also determined the percentage\nof cases that were of a procedure or combination of\nprocedures performed 3,492 times per year or fewer,\nwhich is one-half the number of ambulatory surgery\nfacilities in the United States. Finally, we determined\nthe percentage of cases performed annually in the\nUnited States 1,000 times or fewer. All standard errors\nwere calculated by using the methods described by\nthe NCHS, which compensate for the differential\nweighting of the cases (12).\nResults\nCharacteristics of ambulatory surgery cases per-\nreported in Table 1. A total of 46% of cases had two or\nmore ICD-9 surgical procedures.\nThere were 24,084 different combinations of proce-\nNSAS. The 10 most common combinations of proce-\ndures with an anesthesia provider accounted for 23%\nof all ambulatory surgery cases (Table 2).\nFor 36% of ambulatory surgery cases, the annual\nnumber of cases of the specified procedure or combi-\nnation of procedures was 6984 or fewer (Table 3, left\ncolumn). If procedures were distributed homoge-\nneously among facilities, then this would give an aver-\nage of one case per facility per year (Table 3, middle\ncolumn). Part of the explanation for this finding could\nhave been that many cases had more than one proce-\ndure. However, even for cases that had only one proce-\ndure, we found that 20%  1% of these cases were of a\nprocedure performed alone 6984 times per year.\nFor 30% of ambulatory surgery cases, there were\n3492 cases or fewer per year of the specified procedure\nor combination of procedures, where 3492 equals one-\nhalf the number of ambulatory surgery facilities in the\nUnited States (Table 3). Overall, 20% of cases were of\na procedure or combination of procedures performed\nannually in the United States 1000 times or fewer\n(Table 3).\nDiscussion\nImplications of Our Results\nMany surgical suites rely on historical case-duration\ndata to predict the durations of newly scheduled\ncases. Nevertheless, we found that approximately one\nthird of ambulatory cases were of a procedure or\ncombination of procedures expected to have been per-\nformed once per year per facility (if the procedures\nwere distributed homogeneously among facilities).\nThis result has important implications for improving\nOR scheduling. Surgical cases of a procedure or com-\nbination of procedures performed together infre-\nquently probably account for a sufficiently large per-\ncentage of ambulatory surgery cases as to impairing\nthe accuracy of OR scheduling based on historical\ncase-duration data at many surgical suites. OR man-\nagers may expect the relative frequency of uncommon\ncases to be even greater at tertiary surgical suites than\nin the ambulatory surgery setting (2).\nOur findings support our previously reported re-\nsults (1,2) from the University of Iowa. Also, our find-\nings are consistent with the large number of surgeon\npreference cards found at surgery suites. For example,\na private hospital reported having more than 5600\nsurgeon preference cards (13). The University of Ala-\npreference cards (14).\nWhether a case was of a procedure or combination\nof procedures performed 1000 times per year in the\nUnited States, all 1000 occurrences could have been at\nonly a few specialized facilities. This is unlikely be-\ncause only 10% of facilities performing ambulatory\nsurgery specialize in one surgical specialty (e.g., eye\nDecreasing perioperative costs by analyzing histor-\nical case durations to improve scheduling accuracy,\nmay be limited because of the high frequency of un-\ncommon procedures or combinations of procedures.\nThe impact of uncommon procedures becomes mag-\nnified when predicting the time to complete a series of\nconsecutive elective cases, as is relevant to OR staffing\n(1). As an example, we assumed that an OR has two\ncases scheduled in it. From our study, the likelihood\nthat any particular case will have less than one similar\ncase in the previous year at the facility may equal 36%\n(Table 3, right column). Then, we would expect that a\nseries of two cases has a 59% chance that one or both\ncases has no recent historical data, where 59% \n(probability that both cases have no previous cases) \n(probability that either the first case or the second case\nMany operating rooms in ambulatory surgical suites\nwill have more than two cases (15). However, by only\nchoosing two cases per day per OR for this example,\nwe deliberately underestimated the impact of having\ncases of a procedure or combination of procedures not\nrecently performed at the facility.\nThere are other explanations for inaccuracy in pre-\ndicting case duration. For example, some practitioners\nmay explain scheduling inaccuracy by stating that\ncase durations are often not predicted with the goal of\naccuracy, but to get as many cases into the OR schedule\nTable 1.

At surgical suites for which case durations\nare often deliberately predicted inaccurately, the OR\nmanagers may try to overcome this problem by relying\nonly on historical case durations from the OR informa-\ntion systems to predict case durations. At these surgical\nsuites, the absence of recently performed cases of the\nsame procedure or combination of procedures can be\nparticularly disadvantageous (2). In addition, there is no\nway to reliably determine whether cases are being\nscheduled intentionally in an inaccurate manner.\nReasons Why Our Study Probably\nUnderestimated the True Frequency of\nCases of an Uncommon Procedure or\nCombination of Procedures\nAlthough we focused in our study on the number of\ncases of a specified procedure or combination of pro-\ncedures per year, the more relevant value is probably\nthe number of cases per surgeon per year. Including\nwho the surgeon is when making case predictions is\nimportant, because although scheduled procedure(s)\nis the most important predictor of case duration,\nwhich surgeon will perform the case is the second\nmost important predictor of case duration (1\u00ad3,5\u00ad\n6,16). Both the procedure or combination of proce-\ndures, and who the surgeon is, are required to predict\ncase duration accurately (5\u00ad6,16). Although there\nwere 6984 ambulatory surgery facilities in the United\n(17). Had we considered both procedure(s) and sur-\ngeon, we would expect there to be even fewer previ-\nous cases from which to predict case duration. For this\nreason, we underestimated the number of different\ncategories of cases important for predicting case\nduration.\nAnother important predictor of case duration is the\ntype of anesthesia, ie, surgeon-administered local an-\nesthesia, monitored anesthesia care, or major anesthe-\nsia (16). We limited our consideration to cases for\nwhich an anesthesia provider was present. By exclud-\ning cases without an anesthesia provider, we under-\nestimated the number of different categories of cases\nimportant for predicting case duration.\nCPT-4 codes are used more often in predicting case\nduration than are ICD-9-CM codes. Our use of ICD-\n9-CM codes, rather than CPT-4 codes, had the effect of\nunderestimating the percentage of cases of a proce-\ndure or combination of procedures that occurred to-\ngether infrequently. Although there were 5780 CPT\ncodes for surgical procedures with corresponding an-\nesthesia codes, there were 3626 inpatient and outpa-\ntient procedure ICD-9-CM codes, 2485 of which were\nused in the NSAS in cases with an anesthesia provider\nCPT-4 codes for tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy in\nTable 2.

We found that surgical\ncases of a procedure or combination of procedures\nperformed together infrequently, probably account for\na sufficiently large percentage of ambulatory surgery\ncases as to impair the accuracy of OR scheduling using\nhistorical case-duration data at many surgical suites.\nReferences\n1.
