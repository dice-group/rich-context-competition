    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: The objective of this article is to measure serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) concentration\nin both genders with primary aldosteronism (PA).\nMaterials and methods: The study enrolled 78 subjects with normal controls, 46 subjects with essential hypertension\nand 85 subjects with PA from October 2007 to June 2011. Subjects with PA were divided into three subtype groups:\naldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), bilateral idiopathic hyperplasia (IHA) and PA with negative imaging findings.\nResults: Women with PA (n = 49) had lower serum DHEA-S levels compared with normal controls and subjects with\nessential hypertension (p < 0.01). In subtype analysis, only female APAs had lower serum DHEA-S levels (p < 0.01 com-\npared with normal controls, p < 0.01 compared with subjects with essential hypertension). In APA, a significant correla-\ntion between tumor size and serum DHEA-S was found in women (p < 0.01).\nConclusion: Our data suggested that serum DHEA-S levels are lower in women with PA. In subtype groups, only\nwomen with APA had lower serum DHEA-S. There was no significant difference between subjects with bilateral essential\nhyperplasia, PA with negative imaging findings, normal controls and subjects with essential hypertension in both genders.\nThe serum DHEA-S level is negatively correlated with the size of APA.\n",

Recently, cytochrome P-450 carbon 17-hydroxy\nDHEA-S syntheses, has been shown to be down-regulated\nin subjects with PA.24 The mRNA and protein expression of\nCYP17 is even lower in subjects with APA than with nodu-\nlar hyperplasia. It is possible that subjects with PA may\nhave lower serum DHEA-S concentrations.\nIn the present study, we investigated the serum DHEA-S\nin subjects with PA including APA and bilateral idiopathic\nhyperplasia (IHA), as well as in subjects with essential\nhypertension and normal controls. We explored the deter-\nminant of serum DHEA-S concentrations in these subjects\nand studied whether there were any gender differences.\nMaterials and methods\nSubjects\npatientswereregisteredintheTaiwanPrimaryAldosteronism\nInvestigation (TAIPAI) database.25 All subjects with PA\nwere confirmed with evidence of autonomous excess of\naldosterone production (aldosterone renin ratio > 35) and\nsaline infusion suppression tests (post-saline loading plasma\nwere enrolled as control groups. Essential hypertension was\ndiagnosed by exclusion according to clinical and biochemi-\ncal investigations. The healthy people were recruited in our\nhealth examination center without any major diseases. The\nstudy was approved by the institutional review board of\nNational Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan (No.\ninformed consent.\nDiagnosis of APA, IHA and PA with negative\nimaging findings\nAmong the 85 patients with PA, 44 patients received uni-\nlateral adrenalectomy. APA was defined by evidence of\nadenoma at computed tomography (CT) scan and pathol-\nogy-proved adenoma. IHA was defined on the basis of:\n1) bilateral adrenal hyperplasia shown in CT scan or\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 2) bilateral adrenal\nbilateral adrenal venous sampling (lateralization was\ndefined by a greater than four-fold difference in the\naldosterone/cortisol ratio between bilateral adrenal\nveins) or 4) pathology reports if the patient received an\noperation. Nine of the PA patients who had no imaging\nabnormality and did not receive adrenal venous sam-\npling and operation were defined as PA with negative\nimaging findings.\nMeasurements of serum total cholesterol,\nhigh-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol,\npotassium, creatinine, PAC, PRA, DHEA-S\nconcentrations and tumor sizes of adenomas\nSerum total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, potassium, and\ncreatinine were measured by an immunochemistry analyzer\n(Beckman AU 2700, Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). PAC\nwas measured by commercial radioimmunoassay kits\n(Aldosterone Maia Kit; Adaltis Italia, Bologna, Italy). PRA\nwas measured as the generation of angiotensin-I in vitro by\ncommercial radioimmunoassay kits (Cisbio, Bedford,\nMA). Serum DHEA-S was measured by competitive\nchemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (Immulite/\nImmulite 1000, Siemens, Berlin, Germany). For DHEA-S,\nintra-assay coefficients of variation ranged from 6.8 to\n9.5%, and inter-assay coefficients of variation ranged from\n8.1% to 15%. For subjects with APA, we measured the\ntumor sizes in CT or MRI.\nStatistical analysis\nData were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) in\nmetric and S.I. units except aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR).\nARR was summarized as median and interquartile ranges.\nSerum DHEA-S, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, PRA,\nPAC, ARR, potassium, creatinine and tumor size were log-\narithmically transformed to approximate normal distribu-\ntion in the analyses. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests,\nStudent's t tests, and Pearson's chi square tests were used to\nidentify the differences in various demographic and meta-\nbolic characteristics among different groups. Bonferroni's\ncorrection was applied for post-hoc comparison. Age-\nadjusted DHEA-S concentrations were based on statistic\nmodels composed of age and group. Linear predictions in\neach group were calculated using mean value of age.\nPearson's correlation coefficients and linear regression\nmodels were applied to analyze the relationship between\nserum DHEA-S and adenoma size. A two-tailed p value\nWindows (StataCorp LP, Texas) was used for statistical\nanalyses.\nResults\nwere included with a mean age of 45.3 \u00b1 8.7 years (range\n21\u00ad75 years). As shown in Table 1, subjects were divided\ninto groups of normal controls, essential hypertension and\ntively. Subjects with PA were older than those with essen-\ntial hypertension, more obese than normal controls, had\nhigher blood pressure, higher PAC, lower PRA, higher\nARR, lower serum potassium and lower estimated glomer-\nular filtration rate (eGFR) than the other two groups.\nSubjects with PA showed a lower serum DHEA-S than the\nother two groups (p <0.001). If we adjusted for age, sub-\njects with PA had lower serum DHEA-S than subjects with\nessential hypertension (p = 0.013) and had borderline lower\nserum DHEA-S than normal controls (p = 0.076). For fur-\nther analysis, we divided the subjects by gender. As shown\nin Figure 1, after adjusting for age, women with PA (n = 49)\nhad lower serum DHEA-S compared with normal controls\nand subjects with essential hypertension (p = 0.04 com-\npared with normal control, p = 0.0296 compared with\nessential hypertension). However, serum DHEA-S levels in\nmen with PA (n = 36) were no different from subjects with\nnormal control or essential hypertension, after adjusting for\nAccording to pathology reports, imaging findings and\nbilateral adrenal venous sampling results, we further\ndivided the subjects with PA into three groups: APA, IHA\nand PA with negative imaging findings. Clinical records of\nthese three groups are shown in Table 2. Subjects with\nAPA had lower potassium than subjects with IHA.

We found that only women\nwith APA had significantly lower serum DHEA-S\nconcentrations than normal control subjects and those with\nessential hypertension (p = 0.006 compared with normal\ncontrols, p = 0.029 compared with those with essential\nhypertension). As shown in Figure 2, after adjusting for\nage, women with APA had lower serum DHEA-S concen-\ntrations than normal controls and those with essential\nhypertension (p = 0.01 compared with normal control sub-\njects, p = 0.007 compared with subjects with essential\nhypertension). In both genders, there were no significant\ndifferences of serum DHEA-S concentrations in normal\ncontrol subjects, those with essential hypertension, IHA,\nand PA with negative imaging findings.\nAs serum DHEA-S was lower in women with APA, we\nanalyzed the relationship among serum DHEA-S level and\ntumor size, serum potassium, serum ARR and PAC for both\ngenders. We found a significant inverse correlation between\ntumor size and serum DHEA-S level in women but not in\nfor age, tumor size and serum DHEA-S level still showed a\nborderline inverse relationship in women (p = 0.051) but\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that\nsubjects with PA had lower serum DHEA-S concentrations\nthan subjects with essential hypertension or normal control\nwomen.

In women with APA, serum\nDHEA-S concentration was negatively correlated with size\nof the adrenal tumor.\nIn 1996, Zsuzsa et al. reported low DHEA-S in two\npathology-confirmed adrenal adenomas with low plasma\nout of 59 subjects with APA had low DHEA-S, but lacked\ndata for adrenal hyperplasia and different genders.29\nFour enzymes are involved in the synthesis and regu-\nlation of DHEA-S. CYP17, cytochrome b5 (CYB5) and\nsteroid sulfotransferase (SULT2A1) are enzymes for\nsynthesis. Three--hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase\n(HSD3B2) is an enzyme that can convert DHEA to\nandrostenedion, and its activity is inversely related to\nDHEA-S concentration.30 In a previous study, CYP17\nhas been shown to be down-regulated in subjects with\nAPA and nodular hyperplasia.24 However, the expression\nunknown. The low CYP17 level in PA may explain our\nfindings.\nAnother interesting result of our study is that only\nwomen with APA have significantly lower serum\nDHEA-S concentrations compared with normal controls\nFigure 1.Age-adjusted ln serum DHEA-S in normal subjects, subjects with essential hypertension (EH), and subjects with primary\naldosteronism (PA) by gender.

We failed to detect\nany differences in the serum DHEA-S levels among\nIHA, PA with negative imaging findings, normal con-\ntrol, and essential hypertension subjects in both gen-\nders. The result is partially consistent with the finding\nthat CYP17 expression is lower in APA than in nodular\nhyperplasia reported by Cui et al.24 However, in that\nstudy, the CYP17 expression in nodular hyperplasia is\nstill lower than in normal adrenal glands. In our study,\nwe could not find differences between the subjects with\nIHA, normal controls, and those with essential hyper-\ntension. There are three possible reasons. First, the clin-\nical definition of IHA is different from pathology-proved\nnodular hyperplasia. Most of the patients with IHA did\nnot receive an operation.25 Second, the activities of\nare unknown in IHA, which may diminish the effect of\nsuppressed CYP17 expression in IHA.30 Third, the case\nnumbers of IHA by different genders are relative small.\nThe concentration of serum DHEA-S in different gen-\nders with IHA should be further explored with larger\nsample sizes.\nTumor size of the APA is the only factor associated with\nthe level of serum DHEA-S in the present study. There is no\nsignificant correlation between serum DHEA-S and PAC or\nARR. If we adjust for age, there still exists a borderline\nsignificant relationship between serum DHEA-S level and\ntumor size. The role of tumor size in APA is still\ncontroversial.31,32 Karashima et al. have reported that\nCYP17 is lower in the adjacent tissue of PA with adenomas\nCYB5, HSD3B2 and SULT2A1 are in proportion to tumor\nsize in APA should be further studied.\nOnly in women, we found a significant correlation\nbetween DHEA-S and tumor size of APA. The serum\nDHEA-S level is higher in men after adulthood. In women,\nadrenal glands are the only site for serum DHEA-S synthe-\nsis.17 In contrast, both testes and adrenal glands can secrete\nit in men.34,35 As a consequence, serum DHEA-S may not\nprecisely reflect the production of DHEA/DHEA-S in adre-\nnal glands in men, especially in adrenal diseases. Besides,\nwhether the CYP17 expression differs in genders is still\nunknown.\nIn subjects with PA, the treatments of APA and IHA are\ndifferent. However, differential diagnosis between APA and\nIHA are still controversial. In a recent study, CYP17, an\nenzyme involved in DHEA/DHEA-S, has been shown to be\ndown-regulated in subjects with PA. In our study, we found\nthat serum DHEA-S level is lower especially in females\nwith APA but not IHA. This finding may help in the differ-\nential diagnosis between APA and IHA in the female\npopulation.\nThe strength of this study is that we analyzed our data\nin both genders, which was not conducted in previous\nreports. Since DHEA-S is an androgen, this analytic\napproach is important. Indeed, we did find different\nTable 2.

However, this study is limited in its rela-\ntively small sample size. As a result, we cannot confirm\nthat serum DHEA-S concentrations do not decrease in sub-\ntypes of PA such as IHA.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated that women with PA had\nlower serum DHEA-S concentrations than subjects with\nessential hypertension or normal controls.
