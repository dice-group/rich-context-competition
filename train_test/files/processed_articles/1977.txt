Prior to smoking bans on airlines in the late 1980s, flight attendants were exposed to a\nsignificant amount of SHS. In the present study, we examine associations between flight attendant SHS exposure\nand development of respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular disease.\nMethods: Between December 2006 and October 2010, three hundred sixty-two flight attendants completed an\nonline questionnaire with information regarding experience as a flight attendant, medical history, smoking history,\nand SHS exposure. Rates of illnesses in flight attendants were compared with an age and smoking history matched\npopulation sample from NHANES 2005-2006. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association of\nreported medical conditions and pre-ban years of exposure.\nResults: Compared with the sample from NHANES 2005-2006, flight attendants had increased prevalence of\n(31.5% vs. 20.9%, p < 0.002), despite a lower prevalence of medical illnesses including high blood pressure,\ndiabetes, high cholesterol, heart failure, cancer, and thyroid disease. Amongst flight attendants who reported never\nsmoking over their lifetimes, there was not a significant association between years of service as a flight attendant\nin the pre-smoking ban era and illnesses. However, in this same group, there was a significantly increased risk of\ndaily symptoms (vs. no symptoms) of nasal congestion, throat, or eye irritation per 10-year increase of years of\nConclusions: Flight attendants experience increased rates of respiratory illnesses compared to a population\nsample. The frequency of symptoms of nasal congestion, throat or eye irritation is associated with occupational\nSHS exposure in the pre-smoking ban era.\nBackground\nSecondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) is associated with\nincreased risk of respiratory illness, cancer, and cardio-\nvascular disease [1]. Importantly, SHS exposure is asso-\nciated with increased risk of death due to cardiovascular\ndisease of approximately 30% [1-4] and increased risk of\nlung cancer of 20-30%[1]. Occupational exposure to\nSHS is common [5,6] and the level of exposure may\neven exceed exposure related to home-based SHS [5].\nNumerous public health measures have been instituted\nto limit occupational and public exposure to SHS. Evi-\ndence regarding adverse consequences of occupational\nexposure to SHS continues to be collected.\nOne population with a history of occupational SHS\nexposure is flight attendants. Beginning in 1988, smok-\ning bans on flights originating from the United States\n(US) were gradually introduced [7]. On October 31,\n1989, the US Congress voted to ban smoking on all\n* Correspondence: alexis.beatty@ucsf.edu\n1Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, University of California, San\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2011 Beatty et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Prior to the institu-\ntion of these smoking bans, it was estimated that flight\nattendants were exposed to approximately six times the\nSHS of ground-based workers and fourteen times the\nSHS of a typical person [8].\nFlight attendants reported increased physical symp-\ntoms (ocular and nasal irritation, respiratory symptoms)\nassociated with the cabin environment [9]. However, in\npre-smoking ban studies, it was not consistently clear\nwhether these symptoms were related to the overall\ncabin environment or due to the effects of SHS [10].\nSome individual studies suggested that symptoms of eye\nand nose irritation were associated with in-flight smoke\nexposure [11,12]. While these investigations focused on\nshort-term symptoms related to SHS exposure in the air\ncabin, there are suggestions that cabin SHS exposure\nalso has long-term effects. It has been reported that\nincreased number of hours in a smoky cabin was asso-\nciated with increased sinusitis, middle ear infections,\nand asthma over the lifetime of flight attendants [13].\nNever-smoking flight attendants working prior to the\nsmoking ban have been shown to have airway obstruc-\ntion and impaired diffusing capacity on pulmonary func-\ntion testing [14]. In addition, amongst flight attendants,\nthe highest levels of secondhand smoke exposure were\nassociated with increased rates of hypertension [15].\nWhile the existing evidence suggests a relationship\nbetween flight attendant SHS exposure and development\nof illness, debate persists, in part due to efforts by the\ntobacco industry to diminish the perception of negative\neffects of SHS [16,17]. In the present study, we seek to\nevaluate associations between flight attendant second-\nhand smoke exposure and lifetime development of\nrespiratory symptoms, respiratory illnesses, and cardio-\nvascular disease.\nMethods\nattendants were recruited via newsletters, brochures,\nnewspaper, and internet advertisements to complete a\nquestionnaire online (http://www.imenet.net/UCSF-\nQuest/) or at a visit to the Flight Attendant Medical\nResearch Institute (FAMRI) clinic at the University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco. Even if the flight attendants\nwere unable to visit the FAMRI clinic, flight atten-\ndants who flew while smoking was permitted in air\ncabins were invited to fill out the questionnaire to\nstudy risk for diseases related to occupational second-\nhand smoke exposure. Questionnaire items included\ndemographics, flight attendant occupational history,\nmedical history, symptoms of illness, smoking history,\nand SHS exposure. The study was approved by the\nUniversity of California, San Francisco Institutional\nReview Board.\nQuestionnaire\nFlight attendant occupational history included dates\nworked as a full-time and/or part-time flight attendant,\ncabin sections worked, and domestic/international\nroutes. Other occupational history was also queried.\nMedical history was assessed by asking the respondent\n\"Has a doctor ever diagnosed any of the following medi-\ncal problems?\" to a list of common cardiovascular con-\nditions, respiratory illnesses, and cancer with response\nfor year first diagnosed, and year of most recent worsen-\ning or event. Chest pain was assessed with the question\n\"Do you ever experience chest pain or discomfort with\nexertion?\" and shortness of breath was assessed with\n\"Do you ever experience shortness of breath?\" Symp-\ntoms of cough and upper respiratory symptoms were\nassessed by frequency of symptoms without reference to\ndate of onset of symptoms. Personal smoking history\nwas defined as at least 1 cigarette per day and a total of\n100 cigarettes in the respondent's lifetime and further\nevaluated with questions regarding current and prior\nsmoking including ages started and stopped smoking\nregularly, number of cigarettes smoked per day (if cur-\nrent smoker), and number of cigarettes smoked per day\nwhen smoking at heaviest. SHS exposure was ascer-\ntained by asking about childhood exposures, exposure in\nthe home, exposure outside of the home, and exposure\nin the workplace. Assessment of smoke exposure\nincluded years of exposure and average hours per day\nthat the participant had seen or smelled smoke in each\nenvironment.\nComparison of FAMRI participants with NHANES sample\nParticipants from the FAMRI questionnaire were com-\npared with data publicly available from participants\nfrom the US National Health and Nutrition Examination\nNHANES questionnaires were administered by\nNHANES staff. The majority of NHANES questions\nwere similar to FAMRI questionnaire questions (see\nAdditional File 1). For determination of medical history,\nrespondents were asked \"Have you ever been told by a\ndoctor or other health professional that you had\" fol-\nlowed by the specific medical condition. For sinus pro-\nblems, the NHANES question differed from FAMRI and\nasked \"During the past 12 months, did a doctor or other\nhealth professional tell you that you have a sinus infec-\ntion?\" Questions regarding symptoms of chest pain and\nshortness of breath differed slightly in NHANES with\nquestions of \"Have you ever had any pain or discomfort\nin your chest?\" and \"Have you had shortness of breath\neither when hurrying on the level or walking up a slight\nhill?\" Smoking history in NHANES was defined as at\nleast 100 cigarettes in the participant's lifetime. An\nNHANES sample was generated by restricting the popu-\nlation to those who were female, over the age of 18, and\nwith a high-school education or greater. The sample\nwas frequency-matched for age and personal smoking\nhistory (i.e., previous smoker or not and current smok-\ning status). Comparisons between FAMRI and NHANES\nparticipants were performed using the chi-square test,\nand the 2-sided Fisher-exact test for less prevalent con-\nditions (Congestive Heart Failure and Emphysema/\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).\nDefinition of pre- and post-ban service as a flight\nattendant\nNumber of years of flight attendant smoke exposure was\nquantified by defining pre- and post- ban service. Flight\nattendants recorded the starting and ending month and\nyear of service and reported whether the majority of\ntheir flight routes were domestic or international. For\nwas defined as the date before which flight attendants\nhad in-flight smoke exposure, since this was the date\nsmoking bans went into effect for the majority of US\ndomestic routes. For flight attendants who flew interna-\ntionally, January 1, 1995 was used as the date before\nwhich flight attendants had in-flight smoke exposure,\nsince this was the date of the first US airlines to ban\nsmoking on international flights. Consideration was not\nmade for cabin chamber worked (i.e., first class, coach),\nas this has not been demonstrated to have a significant\neffect on SHS exposure amongst flight attendants [12].\nAssociation of reported medical conditions with service\nas a flight attendant\nLogistic regression analysis was used to examine the asso-\nciation of reported medical conditions and pre-ban years of\nexposure. Analysis was restricted to flight attendants who\nreported having never smoked (n = 235). Odds ratios (OR)\nof reported medical conditions (yes/no) for each decade\n(10-year increase) in years of pre-ban service were esti-\nmated. This duration of service was selected since most\nrespondents were career flight attendants. OR were age-\nadjusted if particular medical conditions were associated\nwith age (e.g., hypertension). OR of reported medical con-\nditions for each per-decade increase in post-ban years and\ntotal years as a flight attendant were also estimated.\nAssociation of nasal congestion, throat or eye irritation\n(ENT) with service as a flight attendant\nquency of nasal congestion, throat or eye irritation (ENT\nsymptoms). Multinomial logistic regression was used to\nexamine the association of ENT symptoms and pre-ban\nyears of exposure. OR of the associations between differ-\ning levels of ENT symptom frequency (daily, weekly/\nmonthly, and less than monthly) vs. no symptoms, for\nevery decade of pre-ban exposure, were obtained. Analy-\nsis was restricted to participants who reported ENT\nsymptom frequency among those who reported having\ndata where participants reported their non-occupational\nSHS exposure, models were adjusted for age, living with\na smoker as an adult (n reporting any answer to this\nperformed to assess the associations of reported medical\nconditions and ENT symptom frequency with post-ban\nyears and total years as a flight attendant.\nAnalyses were carried out with SAS version 9.1.3 and\nStata version 7.

There was no statistically signifi-\ncant difference between NHANES and FAMRI partici-\npants for ischemic heart disease, asthma, sleep apnea,\nbreast cancer, and shortness of breath. However, FAMRI\nparticipants had significantly increased prevalence of\nchronic bronchitis, emphysema/chronic obstructive pul-\nmonary disease (COPD), and sinus problems.\nAssociation of reported medical conditions with service\nas a flight attendant\nAssociations of medical conditions and per-decade\nincrease in pre-smoking ban service as a flight\nattendant (Table 2) were determined in participants\nwithout a personal history of smoking (N = 235). Con-\nditions associated with age (high blood pressure, high\ncholesterol, chronic bronchitis, chest pain, and short-\nness of breath) were adjusted for age. There was no\nsignificant difference in the odds of high blood pres-\nsure, high cholesterol, asthma, chronic bronchitis,\nsinus problems, ear infections, shortness of breath or\nchest pain with respect to duration of pre-smoking ban\nservice.\nAnalyses did not show significant associations of\nreported medical conditions with per-decade increase in\npost-ban years or total years as a flight attendant. How-\never, there was a non-significant trend of increased\nsinus problems and ear infections, respectively, with\ntotal years of service (Table 3).\nAssociation of nasal congestion, throat or eye irritation\n(ENT) with service as a flight attendant\nThree hundred twenty-eight of three hundred sixty-two\nFAMRI participants described frequency of symptoms of\nnasal congestion, throat or eye irritation (ENT) not\nrelated to a cold or hay fever. Of these respondents, 71\nweekly or monthly symptoms, 93 (28.4%) reported less\nnever experiencing symptoms (Table 1). A similar distri-\nbution of ENT symptom frequency occurred for those\nparticipants who reported never having smoked. Analy-\nsis of symptom frequency amongst flight attendants\nreporting no personal history of smoking revealed a sig-\nnificantly higher risk of daily symptoms vs. no symp-\ntoms per decade of pre-ban service (OR 2.14, 95% CI\nTable 1 Prevalence of medical conditions in FAMRI questionnaire participants compared with NHANES 2005-2006\nparticipants\nMedical Condition N (%) N (%) P-value\nAbnormal Heart Rhythm 26 (7.6) data not available\nNasal congestion, throat or eye irritation \nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006 sample was restricted to women above the age of 18 with at least a high school\neducation and was age and smoking history matched with the Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute (FAMRI) participants. FAMRI participants completed\nquestionnaires between December 2006 and October 2010.

Adjustment\nfor maternal exposure to smoke during pregnancy\nslightly attenuated the association (OR 1.65, 95% CI\nDiscussion\nThis questionnaire-based study of flight attendant occu-\npational SHS exposure and medical illnesses provides\nseveral observations about the overall health of flight\nattendants and the relationship between illness and SHS\nexposure as a flight attendant. Compared with an age\nand smoking history matched population sample from\nhealthier than the US population with respect to most\ncommon illnesses. However, for many respiratory ill-\nnesses including chronic bronchitis, emphysema/COPD,\nand sinus problems, flight attendants exposed to SHS\nhave an increased prevalence of disease. This suggests\nthat exposures related to being a flight attendant may\npromote the development of respiratory illness. We did\nnot find that years of pre-smoking ban service as a flight\nattendant were associated with the presence of common\nmedical illnesses. However, frequency of symptoms of\nnasal congestion, throat or eye irritation was associated\nwith years of pre-smoking ban service as a flight atten-\ndant. This association was not present for post-smoking\nban years of service or total years of service, suggesting\nthat SHS exposure during the pre-smoking ban era may\nexplain the increased frequency of symptoms of nasal\ncongestion, throat or eye irritation.\nA previous questionnaire-based study of flight atten-\ndants by Ebbert et al [13] revealed high rates of COPD,\nsinusitis, allergies, bronchitis, ear infections, and asthma,\nbut did not offer a referent comparison to the general\npopulation. Additionally, they found that sinusitis, mid-\ndle ear infections, and asthma were related to hours in a\nsmoky cabin. Our results further confirm their finding\nthat flight attendants experience higher rates of respira-\ntory illnesses and experience greater upper respiratory\nsymptoms related to SHS exposure.\nCOPD has previously been associated with SHS expo-\nsmoking flight attendants with occupational exposure to\nSHS, pulmonary function testing has revealed evidence\nof airway obstruction and impaired diffusing capacity\n[14]. Similarly, our results confirm prior studies report-\ning increased rates of bronchitis related to SHS expo-\nsure [21,22]. While several other investigations have\nreported an association of asthma with SHS exposure\nTable 3 Association between years of service as a flight\nattendant with sinus problems and ear infections\nMedical Condition OR (95% CI)\nAmongst flight attendants without a personal history of smoking, odds ratios\nof reporting sinus problems and ear infections were calculated per a 10-year\nincrease in service as a flight attendant, without regard for pre- or post-\nsmoking ban history.\nFigure 1 Association of pre-ban service as a flight attendant\nwith nasal congestion, throat or eye irritation.

Our findings that flight attendants experi-\nence increased risk of COPD and chronic bronchitis are\nconsistent with these prior studies in populations with\nSHS exposure.\nIn our study, we observed fewer cancers compared to\nthe NHANES sample, but no statistically significant dif-\nference in rates of breast cancer between the two popu-\nlations. Other studies of flight attendants have yielded\nconflicting results regarding rates of breast cancer. Some\ndemonstrate increased rates of breast cancer after peri-\nods of 15 or more years after initiation of service as a\nflight attendant, despite consideration for some potential\nconfounders including age and reproductive status\n[25,26]. However, others have found that the risk of\nbreast cancer amongst flight attendants is more asso-\nciated with established risk factors for breast cancer\nthan exposure to in flight radiation or SHS exposure\nAmong the most common symptoms reported by\nflight attendants are those related to upper respiratory\nillness, including sinusitis, ear infections, nasal conges-\ntion, and throat or eye irritation [10]. We found a signif-\nicant increase in frequency of nasal congestion, throat or\neye irritation symptoms associated with duration of time\nas a flight attendant in the pre-smoking ban era. This\nfinding is consistent with previous findings of increased\nrisk of upper respiratory symptoms related to SHS expo-\nsure in general populations [28-32] and amongst flight\nchanges in the nasal mucosa by inducing biofilm forma-\ntion, which may alter the nasal flora and perpetuate ill-\nness [35]. However, after the airline smoking ban took\neffect, a significant decrease in respirable particles and\ndecrease in symptoms of ocular irritation amongst flight\nattendants was observed [11]. Given the consistent find-\ning that symptoms of upper respiratory illness are asso-\nciated with SHS exposure, further formal investigation is\nwarranted to determine the mechanisms, chronicity, and\nimpact of these symptoms.\nDue to the nature of this questionnaire-based study,\nseveral limitations exist. Participants were recruited via\nnewsletters, brochures, newspaper, and internet adver-\ntisements. While respondents to these advertisements\nwere likely flight attendants, it is not possible to for-\nmally assess who responded to the ads and participated\nin the web-survey. 70% of those who visited the website\ncompleted the survey. The results of the study may be\naffected by uncontrolled selection bias of those choosing\nto complete the questionnaire. Self-reporting bias may\noverestimate the true prevalence of certain medical con-\nditions amongst participants. Compared to the question-\nnaire conducted by Ebbert et al [13], the prevalence of\ndisease within the FAMRI population is generally less\nfrequent or similar to the prevalence of disease reported\nin their investigation, suggesting that bias may be\nslightly less than or equivalent to previous similar stu-\ndies. Other sources of bias may also be present.\nResponse rates were not 100% for each question, thus\nascertainment of exposures and conditions is not com-\nplete. Data with regard to personal smoking history (i.e.,\nage started smoking) and outside SHS exposure (e.g.,\nyears living with adult who smoked, years working in\noccupations where others smoked) were limited. More-\nover, apart from the reported years of service aboard\naircraft, the actual level of in-flight SHS exposure could\nnot be quantified. The lack of complete responses for\npersonal and SHS exposure limits the ability of this\nstudy to find and/or control for associations between\nSHS exposure and illnesses. SHS exposure determina-\ntion was dependent upon responses from the question-\nnaire and may also be confounded by other\noccupational and residential exposures. With regard to\ncomparison with other populations, the FAMRI popula-\ntion appears generally healthier than the NHANES\npopulation, which may be because the two populations\ndiffer with regard to numerous employment-related and\nsocioeconomic factors. While we tried to account for\nsome of these differences by restricting the NHANES\nsample to those with a high-school education or greater,\nwe were not able to adjust for employment status or\nother variables with the currently available NHANES\nAdditionally, the findings of increased rates of respira-\ntory illnesses amongst flight attendants, lack of associa-\ntion of most illnesses with pre-smoking ban service as a\nflight attendant, and the non-significant trend towards\nincreased sinus problems and ear infections related to\ntotal years of service as a flight attendant raises the pos-\nsibility that some degree of upper respiratory symptoms\namongst flight attendants may not necessarily be related\nto smoke exposure alone, but may relate to general\noccupational exposures related to the cabin environ-\nment. The air cabin environment includes a number of\npotential irritants other than tobacco smoke, including\nozone [36], cleaning agents [37], volatile by-products of\nfuel and fuel combustion, pesticides, infectious agents,\nand other airborne allergens [38]. Data supporting the\nrelationship between these agents and symptoms of\nrespiratory illnesses are limited [38].\nConclusions\nEven though smoking has been banned from airline\nflights originating in the US, the effects of SHS exposure\nare still of interest to those flight attendants who with-\nstood the SHS exposure and experience illness poten-\ntially related to their in-flight exposure. In addition,\ngreater knowledge of the late effects of SHS exposure\nbetter equips health professionals to care for these indi-\nviduals. Indeed, we have demonstrated that flight atten-\ndants experience increased rates of many respiratory\nillnesses compared to the general population, and some\nof the increased frequency of symptoms is related to\nSHS exposure. While flight attendants are no longer\nsubject to in-flight SHS exposure, SHS exposure con-\ntinues to affect individuals in other occupations and\nremains an area for research and advocacy.\nAdditional material\nAdditional file 1: Supplementary Table.
