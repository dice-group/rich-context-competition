It affects 1% to\n2% of the general population, and its\nprevalence increases with advancing age.\nThe underlying mechanism of AF is multi-\nfactorial; therefore, its management can be\ncomplex and difficult.1 Although the symp-\ntoms of AF, including exercise intolerance,\ndyspnea, and fatigue, range from nonexis-\ntent to severe and differ among patients, the\nquality of life (QoL) of affected patients is\nusually impaired.2\u00ad6\nAF also affects the ventilatory function of\nthe lungs.7,8 Some studies have shown that\nthe forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced\nexpiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1\n) are lower in\npatients with AF than in those without\nAF.9,10 Additionally, one study showed\nrespiratory muscle weakness in patients\nwith AF.8 However, the pulmonary function\nof these patients and its contribution to the\ndisease burden has not been extensively\ninvestigated.\nQoL in patients with AF is reportedly\nassociated with symptom severity scores,6\nthe physical activity level, the New York\nHeart Association (NYHA) functional\nclass,11 and depression and anxiety symp-\nimpairment has been reported, we believe\nthat to examine QoL, patients with AF\nshould be assessed in a comprehensive\nmanner that includes assessment of both\npulmonary function and respiratory muscle\nstrength. Therefore, this study was per-\nformed to analyze the relationship of QoL\nwith pulmonary function, respiratory\nmuscle strength, and functional capacity in\npatients with AF.\nPatients and methods\nStudy design and population\nA cross-sectional study was designed.\nThirty-six patients with chronic AF were\nrecruited from the rhythm management\npolyclinic in a university hospital according\nto the following criteria: continuous chronic\nAF of >6 months in duration, a left ven-\ntricular ejection fraction of >40%, and a\nNYHA functional class of I or II. The\nexclusion criteria were the presence of any\nchronic lung diseases, recent coronary\nbypass surgery, previous heart valve sur-\ngery, rheumatic valvular heart disease, acute\nmyocardial infarction, and the presence of a\npacemaker. This study was approved by the\nethics committee of a university hospital,\nand all participants included in the study\nprovided written informed consent before\ndata collection.\nQoL was measured with the generic Medical\nOutcomes Survey 36-item Short Form (SF-\n36) and disease-specific Minnesota Living\nwith Heart Failure Questionnaire\n(MLHFQ). The SF-36 is a valid and reliable\n36-item questionnaire that is widely used to\nmeasure QoL in the general population. It\nyields an 8-scale profile of functional health\nand well-being scores as well as two sum-\nmary scores of physical and mental health.\nA higher score indicates better QoL.14 The\nMLHFQ is a disease-specific questionnaire\ncomprising 21 items rated on 6-point Likert\nscales. It yields a total score as well as\nphysical (8 items) and emotional (5 items)\ndimension scores. A higher score indicates\npoorer QoL.15 The MLHFQ was developed\nfor patients with heart failure but is also\nwidely used in patients with other cardiac\ndiseases, including AF.2\nPulmonary function and respiratory\nmuscle strength\nPulmonary function was measured with a\nspirometer (SpiroUSB; CareFusion, San\nDiego, CA, USA) according to the criteria\nof the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and\nEuropean Respiratory Society (ERS).16 The\n, peak expiratory flow, and\nthe pulmonary volume were measured and\nare expressed as percentages of the predicted\nvalues. Respiratory muscle strength was\nmeasured by the maximum inspiratory pres-\nsure (MIP) and maximum expiratory pres-\nsure (MEP) using a hand-held respiratory\npressure meter (MicroRPM; CareFusion)\naccording to the ATS/ERS guideline.17 The\nmaximum value of three efforts that varied\nby <5% was recorded for the MIP\nand MEP.\nFunctional capacity and resting symptoms\nFunctional capacity was measured with the\n6-min walk test (6MWT) according to the\nguideline of the ATS.18 The test was\nrepeated twice with a 30-min recovery\nperiod between the tests, and the higher\n6-min walk distance (6MWD) was recorded.\nThe resting dyspnea and resting fatigue\nlevels were assessed with the Borg CR10\nScale. The anchors were 0 for no fatigue or\nshortness of breath and 10 for maximum\nfatigue or shortness of breath.19\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nthe SPSS 20.0 statistical program (IBM\nCorp., Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous\nvariables are expressed as mean \u00c6 standard\ndeviation, ordinal variables are expressed\nas median [minimum\u00admaximum], and cat-\negorical variables are expressed as percent-\nages. The data distribution was assessed\nwith the Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov test,\nLilliefors test, and Shapiro\u00adWilk test.\nPearson correlation analysis was used for\nnormally distributed continuous data, and\nSpearman correlation analysis was used for\nordinal or non-normally distributed data to\nassess the relationship of QoL scores with\nthe pulmonary function, functional cap-\nacity, and clinical features. A linear regres-\nsion model was used to assess which\npredictors contributed to the prediction of\nthe SF-36 physical component summary and\nMLHFQ total score. QoL, pulmonary func-\ntion, and functional capacity were compared\nbetween patients with a NYHA class of I\nand II using the independent-samples t-test\nor Mann\u00adWhitney U test depending on the\ndistribution properties of the data. A p value\nof <0.05 was considered statistically signifi-\ncant for all analyses.\nResults\nThe patients' demographics, clinical fea-\ntures, and test results are shown in Table 1.\nCorrelations of pulmonary function and\nfunctional capacity with the SF-36 summary\nscores and MLHFQ scores are shown in\nThe SF-36 physical component summary\nscore was strongly correlated with the rest-\ning Borg fatigue score; moderately corre-\nlated with the MIP, 6MWD, and resting\nBorg dyspnea score; and weakly correlated\nThe MLHFQ total and physical dimen-\nsion scores were strongly correlated with the\nresting Borg fatigue score; moderately cor-\nrelated with the MIP, 6MWD, and resting\nBorg dyspnea score; and weakly correlated\nwith the MEP (p < 0.05).

The resting Borg fatigue score\nwas the significant independent predictor for\nthe SF-36 physical component score and\nMLHFQ total score. Patients with higher\nresting Borg fatigue scores had poorer QoL\n(Table 3).\nThe comparison of QoL between the\npatients with a NYHA class of I and II is\nshown in Table 4. Compared with patients\nwith a NYHA class of I, those with a NYHA\nclass of II had significantly poorer phys-\nical and mental component QoL scores\nand all subgroup scores except ``Social\nFunctioning'' and ``Role Limitations-\nemotional'' of the SF-36 as well as signifi-\ncantly poorer total, physical, and emotional\ndimension scores of the MLHFQ (p < 0.05).\nNo significant differences in the spirometric\nTable 1.

Although the predictive factors\nfor QoL in patients with AF have been\npreviously investigated, this was the first\nstudy to investigate how QoL is influenced\nby pulmonary function, respiratory muscle\nstrength, and functional capacity as mea-\nsured with the 6MWT.\nAccording to the ATS/ERS guideline,17\nO are abnormal\nand indicate inspiratory muscle weakness. In\nthe present study, the mean MIP value of\nO,\nindicating inspiratory muscle weakness.\nInspiratory muscle weakness may negatively\ninfluence QoL in patients with AF, as\nindicated by the correlation between inspira-\ntory muscle strength and the QoL scores.\nThus, we hypothesize that exercise training\nfocusing on the inspiratory muscles may\nimprove the QoL of patients with AF. This\nhypothesis is consistent with the findings\nof Cahalin et al.,20 who reported that\ninspiratory muscle training improved QoL\nin patients with heart disease and heart\nfailure. Similar studies are needed for\npatients with AF.\nWe found no relationship between the\nspirometric values and QoL in the present\nstudy. Previous studies have reported an\ninfluence of FVC and FEV1\non QoL in\npatients with heart failure21 and chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease.22 The reason\nfor the lack of such a correlation between\nthe spirometric values and QoL in the\npresent study may be that our patients had\nnormal spirometric values.\nTsounis et al.11 and Arribas et al.23 both\nreported that patients with AF with a higher\nNYHA functional class had worse scores in\nseveral QoL measures. These findings are\nconsistent with our results: our patients with\nan NYHA class of II had worse scores than\nthose with an NYHA class of I in almost all\nSF-36 subgroups and for all MLHFQ scores\n(p < 0.05). Besides the NYHA functional\nclassification, we also found a significant\nTable 4.

This is\nan important finding because the 6MWT is\nfrequently used in cardiac rehabilitation\nprograms.24 The 6MWD of patients with\nAF can be improved with aerobic exercise\ntraining,25 Qi Gong training (Traditional\nChinese Medicine),26 and inspiratory muscle\ntraining.8 Considering the relationship\nbetween the 6MWT performance and QoL,\nit may be assumed that by improving the\n6MWD, the patients' QoL may also improve.\nThis assumption is supported by the findings\nof Osbak et al.25 They reported significant\nimprovements in the 6MWD and QoL scores\non both the SF-36 and MLHFQ question-\nnaires with aerobic exercise training.\nIn the present study, the resting Borg\ndyspnea and fatigue scores had the strongest\ncorrelation with QoL. This finding is not\nsurprising because the literature clearly\nshows that in patients with AF, QoL\ndecreases as symptom severity increases.6,27\nDrug trials have shown that patients' QoL\ncan increase with improvements in AF-\nrelated symptoms.28,29 Additionally, Smith\net al.30 reported that symptom control is a\nkey factor when determining QoL in\npatients with AF. However, the literature\ncontains no exercise training studies that\nfocus on improving symptoms to increase\nQoL in these patients. Therefore, future\nstudies are needed.\nPatients with AF have poorer QoL than\nindividuals without AF. The purpose of the\npresent study was to determine whether\nrespiratory function contributes to their\nQoL. Thus, we measured pulmonary func-\ntion within a group of patients with AF and\ncorrelated our measures with the QoL meas-\nures in this patient population. The QoL in a\ncontrol group of patients without AF may\nor may not be correlated with pulmonary\nfunction, but this would not pertain to the\ninteraction between pulmonary function\nand AF on QoL and could mask our results\nbecause they pertain to improvements in\nQoL of patients with AF. The main limita-\ntion of this study is that the sample size was\nrelatively small and the results may not be\nrepresentative for all patients with AF.\nNevertheless, the literature shows evidence\nof impairments in pulmonary function and\nrespiratory muscle strength of patients with\nAF; therefore, the impact of these impair-\nments on QoL should be investigated in\nfuture studies with larger sample sizes.\nConclusion\nSeveral factors that influence QoL in patients\nwith AF have been defined in the literature.\nIn the present study, we found that the\nrespiratory muscle strength, especially the\nstrength of the inspiratory muscles, and\nthe functional capacity of patients with AF\nmay also be related to QoL. Future studies\nshould consider the inclusion of respiratory\nmuscles and functional capacity in their\nassessments when examining the QoL in\nthese patients. The fatigue level of the\npatients was also an independent predictor\nfor the QoL measures in our study, which\nemphasizes the importance of symptom con-\ntrol in the management of QoL in patients\nwith AF.\n"
