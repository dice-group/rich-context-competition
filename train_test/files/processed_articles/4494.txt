The battery of\nbehavioral tests, i.e. plantar, pin prick, tail flick, tail pinch, rota rod tests, were performed to assess the degree of thermal\nand mechanical hyperalgesia in ipsilateral paw and tail, and motor in-coordination activity respectively. In addition, the\nbiochemical tests, i.e. total protein, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and reduced glutathione, were also performed\nin sciatic nerve tissue samples.\nResults: The administration of ramipril (2 and 4 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly attenuated chronic constriction injury-\ninduced rise in peripheral as well as central pain sensitivity (thermal and mechanical) along with impairment of motor\nin-coordination activity. Further, it also produces ameliorative effects on chronic constriction injury-induced rise in\nthiobarbituric acid reactive substances and decrease in glutathione levels when compared with a normal control group.\nConclusion: It may be concluded that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor may be a potential new target for the\nmanagement of neuropathic pain.\n",

Bradykinin\nhas pleiotrophic actions, and potent physiological effects,\ni.e. decreased blood pressure, increased vascular permea-\nbility and the promotion of classical symptoms of inflam-\nmation such as vasodilation, hyperthermia, edema and\npain (warning signal). In addition, it has beneficial effects,\ni.e. potent anti-thrombogenic, anti-proliferative and anti-\nfibrogenic effects.22 Bradykinin is an endogenous nona-\npeptide which is catabolised by ACE. ACE inhibitors\nincrease the level of bradykinin by reduction of catabolic\nproduces the pain sensation by\ndirect stimulation of nociceptors in the peripheral nervous\nsystem but this effect is of very short duration of action\nand its half-life is very short (15 seconds).23 In addition,\nis not only degraded by ACE but also by other\nenzymatic pathways, i.e. aminopeptidase P, carboxypepti-\ndase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, endothelin-converting\nenzyme, neprilysin, propyl oligopeptidase, and the neutral\nendopeptidase.23,24 Furthermore, bradykinin has also been\nreported to produce pro- and anti-nociceptive action in a\ndose dependent manner.25 The lipophilic ACE inhibitor\nrapidly crosses the central nervous system, and its half-life\nACE inhibitor, i.e. ramipril, has pleiotropic effects, which\nis not equally shared by other ACE inhibitors. Moreover,\nramipril also increases the endothelium-dependent relaxa-\ntion factor (i.e. nitric oxide) and vasodilatation via B2\nreceptors.28 Ramipril has a potential role in cardiovascular\noutcomes along with neuroprotective action.29\nHowever, the RAAS modulator is known to produce\npotential side effects, such as angioedema, hypotension\nand acute pancreatitis by angiotensin receptor blocker,\nrenin inhibitor and ACE inhibitors.30\u00ad32 ACE inhibitors and\nangiotensin receptor blockers both cause cough and angi-\noedema which produces cardiovascular risk in human.33,34\nAngiotensin II is more prone to causing vasoconstriction\nalong with ischemic neuropathy by activation of the angio-\ntensin receptor in the nervous system.35 Angiotensin II for-\nmation is due toACE activity. The reduction of angiotensin\nII may be beneficial in neurodegenerative disorders such\nas neuropathic pain, instead of angiotensin receptor block-\ners and renin inhibitors.17,35 However, the role of ACE\ninhibitors has not yet been explored in the chronic con-\nstriction injury of sciatic nerve induced neuropathic pain\nmodel in mice. Therefore, the present study is focused\nto evaluate ramipril (ARTERE\u00ae; ACE inhibitor) in the\nmanagement of chronic constriction injury-induced neuro-\npathic pain in mice.\nMaterials and method\nDrugs and chemicals\nFolin-Ciocalteu's phenol reagent (Merck Limited,\nMumbai), 5,5'-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB),\n1,1',3,3' tetramethoxy propane, reduced glutathione and\nbovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sisco Research Laboratories\nPvt. Ltd. Mumbai) were procured for the present study.\nDTNB was dissolved in 1% w/v of sodium citrate. All the\nreagents used in the present study were of analytical grade.\nAnimals\nSwiss mice weighing 25\u00ad30 g were employed in the present\nstudy. Animals were maintained with a standard laboratory\ndiet (Markfed cotton seed processing plant, Gidderbaha,\nMukatsar, Punjab, India) and water ad libtium. Further ani-\nmals were exposed to the natural light and dark cycle. The\nexperimental protocol was approved by the Institutional\nAnimal Ethics Committee (IAEC) and care of the animals\nwas taken as per the guidelines of the Committee for the\nPurpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on\nAnimals (CPCSEA), Ministry of Environmental and Forest,\nInduction of peripheral neuropathy by chronic\nconstriction injury\nNeuropathic pain was induced in mice by chronic constric-\ntion injury of the sciatic nerve as described by Ma and\nEisenach.36 Briefly, mice were deeply anesthetized with\nthiopental sodium (35 mg/kg, i.p.). The hair from the lower\nback in the thigh region was removed and the skin was\nsterilized with 0.5% w/v povidine solution. The skin and\nmuscle layer of the lateral surface of the right thigh was\nincised and the sciatic nerve was exposed. The four loose\nligatures (silk thread no. 4) were placed around the proxi-\nmal portion of the sciatic nerve from the trifurcation part\n(i.e. near knee joint), and a distance of 1 mm was main-\ntained between each ligature. The loose ligatures were\napplied until a short flick response of the ipsilateral hind\npaw. After completion of the chronic constriction injury\n(CCI) procedure, muscle and skin layer was immediately\nsutured with silk thread and topical antibiotic powder was\napplied at once. Nociceptive threshold was assessed at dif-\nBehavioral evaluation\nPlantar test. Thermal (radiant) hyperalgesia was assessed\nas described by the method of Hargreaves et al.37 Briefly,\nthe right hind paw of the mouse was placed on the radiant\nheat source. The thermal sensitivity of the hind paws was\nobserved as the degree of hind paw withdrawal latency\nfrom the radiant heat lamp source. Withdrawal of the hind\nlimb was considered as a positive response. The cut-off\ntime was maintained at 20 seconds.\nPin prick test.Mechanical hyperalgesia was assessed as\ndescribed by the method of Erichsen and Blackburn-\nMunro.38 A blunted needle was applied to the mid plantar\nsurface of the right hind paw at an intensity sufficient to\nproduce a reflex withdrawal response. The needle was\napplied six times per minute. Withdrawal of the hind limb\nwas considered as positive response. The cut off stimuli\nwas applied six times to avoid the tissue injury and wind-\nup phenomenon.\nTail flick test.Tail thermal (radiant) hyperalgesia was\nassessed as described by the method of D'Amour and\nSmith39 with the slight modification of Hargreaves et al.37\nBriefly, the tail of the mouse was placed on the radiant heat\nsource. The thermal sensitivity of the tail was observed as\nthe degree of tail withdrawal latency from the radiant heat\nlamp source. Withdrawal of the tail was considered as pos-\nitive response. The cut-off time was maintained at 15 sec-\nonds to avoid tail damage.\nTail pinch test. Mechanical stimulus induced pain sensitiv-\nity was assessed by the tail pinch test according to modi-\nfied Heffner's method as described by Takagi et al.40\nBriefly, mice were tested by pinching their tail base with a\nHoffmann clamp adjusted to elicit a nociceptive response.\nThe nociceptive response was indicated by the number of\nattempts at the dislodgment of the Heffner's clamp. The\npressure stimulus evoked nociceptive response was noted\nand a cut-off time of 1 minute was maintained to prevent\ntissue damage.\nRota rod test.The motor in-coordination was assessed as\ndescribed by the method of Jones and Roberts41 with the\nslight modification of Muthuraman et al.42 Briefly, mice\nwere placed on the rotating rod (25 rpm) after a training\nperiod (i.e. 5 min) before 30 minutes of motor in-coordina-\ntion test. The motor in-coordination of mice was assessed\nas the degree of fall in time from the rotating rod. The cut\noff time was maintained at 5 minutes to avoid potential\nmuscular damage.\nBiochemical analysis\nAll of the groups of animals were sacrificed after 14 days\nby cervical dislocation and complete sciatic nerves were\nisolated immediately. All parts of nerves were used for\nbiochemical estimations. The sciatic nerve was homoge-\nnated (10% w/v) with phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and\nused for the estimation of tissue total protein, thiobarbi-\nturic acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reduced glu-\ntathione (GSH) levels.\nEstimation of total protein content. The tissue total protein\ncontent was estimated as described by the method of\nLowry et al.43 Briefly, 300 \u00b5l of supernatant was diluted up\nto 1 ml with distilled water in a test tube. Then 5 ml of\nLowry et al.'s reagent was added and allowed to stand for\n15 min at room temperature. Then 0.5 ml of Folin\u00adCiocal-\nteu reagent was added and the contents were vortexed vig-\norously and incubated at room temperature for 30 min.\nThis reaction gave purple chromogen in the presence of\nprotein. The protein content was estimated spectrophoto-\nmetrically (UV-1800 UV-Vis spectrophotometer, SHI-\nMADZU Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) at 750 nm\nwavelength. The bovine serum albumin (1\u00ad10 mg) was\nused as standard. The results of total protein concentration\nwere expressed as mg/ml of supernatant.\nEstimation of TBARS. The tissue TBARS content was esti-\nmated as described by the method of Niehaus and Samu-\nelsson.44 Briefly, 0.5 ml tissue homogenate was mixed\nwith 2.5 ml of (10%, w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) solu-\ntion and placed in a boiling water bath for 15 min. The test\ntubes were cooled at room temperature and centrifuged at\ntransferred to a test tube containing 1 ml of TCA (5% w/v)\nwere again placed in a boiling water bath for 15 min and\ncooled at room temperature. This reaction gave pink chro-\nmogen in the presence of malondialdehyde. The absorb-\nance changes in the tissue samples were estimated\nspectrophotometrically at 535 nm wavelength. The\nstandard. The results of TBARS were expressed as nmol of\nmalondialdehyde/mg of protein.\nEstimation of reduced GSH content. The tissue GSH con-\ntent was estimated using the method described by of\nBeutler et al.45 Briefly, 0.5 ml tissue homogenate was\nmixed with 2 ml of (0.3 M) disodium hydrogen phos-\nDTNB solution. This reaction gave yellow chromogen in\nthe presence of GSH. The absorbance changes in the tis-\nsue samples were estimated spectrophotometrically at\nas standard. The results of GSH were expressed as g of\nGSH/mg of protein.\nExperimental protocol\nNine groups, each comprising six Swiss mice were\nemployed in the present study.\n106 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(1)\nGroup I (normal control).

At phasic pain (dark cycle), it exerted an\nanti-nociceptive effect, whereas in tonic pain (light\ncycle), it exerted weak circadian fluctuation of the num-\nber of pain responses in mice.53 Angiotensin II has pain\ncontrol effects;54 in contrast, angiotensin II causes the\nnociceptive pain which is ameliorated by angiotensin 1\u00ad7\n) peptide via inhibition of Mas receptors associated\np38 MAPK phosphorylation in mice.55 However, the clin-\nically available medicine for AT2\nR antagonists is not\navailable yet. AT2\nR antagonists may be available for\nchronic pain management in the future.56 In addition, the\nrationale of ACE inhibitors increases the pain sensitivity,\nbecause it not only produces inhibition of ACE activity,\nbut also inactivates the opioid peptide [Leu5]enkephalin in\nthe rat,57 whereas the treatment of ramipril reported to\nhave beneficial effects on glucose-fed induced sensory\npolyneuropathy in rats via down regulation of pro-nocic-\neptive kinin B1\nFurthermore, Ang III as well as Ang IV is biologically\nactive and formed from angiotensin II via ACE activity.\nBut the effect of these have not yet been fully elucidated for\nthe cardiovascular, renal system and neuropathic pain.59,60\nThe rise in the level of angiotensin II and their receptors,\ni.e. angiotensin I receptor and angiotensin II receptor, is\nresponsible in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain in\nis a metabolite of angiotensin II, which acts on specific\nangiotensin IV receptors, mainly responsible for improving\ncognitive dysfunction.62 The role of angiotensin IV remains\nto be explored in neuropathic pain disorders. ACE inhibi-\ntors are responsible for the reduction of blood pressure and\nneuroprotective action.52 The elevation of blood pressure\nhas been reported to produce a reduction in pain sensitivity.\nThe over activation of the RAAS is responsible for the rise\nin blood pressure, but the role in neuropathic pain has not\nbeen explored yet. In the present study, the peripheral nerve\ninjury leads to activate supra-spinal sympathetic tone which\nin turn causes over activation of the RAAS and releases\npro-nociceptive peptides (i.e. angiotensin II). In addition,\ntreatment of ACE inhibitor (Delapril) in spontaneously\nhypertensive rats (SHR), induces the pain sensitivity and\ndecreases sympathetic tone via two preliminary actions: (a)\nACE inhibition; and (b) decrease the endogenous opioid\npeptide,63 whereas the treatment of ramipril improves the\nautonomic control by reduction of sympathetic tone but is\nnot reported to have an effect on endogenous opioid pep-\ntide levels.64 Ramipril is one of the major drugs used as an\nACE inhibitor, which also produces neuroprotection by\nfree radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory actions.65,66\nThe present result also revealed neuroprotective action by\nthe attenuation of CCI-induced rise in TBARS and decrease\nin reduced glutathione content along with various periph-\neral and central pain parameters. Ramipril is a prodrug\n(active form is ramiprilat) for ACE inhibition. It is a lipo-\nphilic drug that crosses the blood\u00adbrain barrier. However, it\ndoes not act on somatic ACE (membrane bound) for degra-\ndation of central neuropeptides.67 Ramiprilat penetrates\nfrom the blood into the CSF which inhibits the activity of\nsoluble ACE at the spinal cord region.68,69 Therefore, neu-\nropathic pain parameters have assessed on the peripheral\nsite (paw pain sensitivity response) as well as in the central\nsite (tail pain sensitivity response).\nIt may be concluded that ramipril has the potential ame-\nliorating role in CCI induced thermal and mechanical\nhyperalgesia in mice. This action is due to the potential of\nanti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory actions via reduction\nof angiotensin II. Therefore, ACE inhibition may be a\nnewer potential target in the management of neuropathic\npain disorders.\n"
