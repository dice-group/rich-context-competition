With the\nnotable exception of several widely cited articles\n(e.g., Blazer & Palmore, 1976; Koenig, Moberg, &\nresearch published in this area is largely isolated\nfrom conceptual work on both religion and well-\nbeing and from theoretical and methodological de-\nvelopments in religion and aging. This has led some\nto ask, \"Is religion taboo in gerontology?\" (Sherrill,\nLarson, & Creenwold, 1993) and has created incen-\ntive for systematic efforts to identify limitations of\nprior studies in order to redirect research (Levin,\nneeds include more precise conceptualization and\nmeasurement of both religious involvement and psy-\nchological well-being, and a greater emphasis on\nstudies that are longitudinal, focus on ethnic minor-\nity populations, and are theory- or hypothesis-driven.\nFirst, researchers must meaningfully account for\nthe different ways of being religious and practicing\nreligion. Cerontologists have begun to differentiate\namong types of religious involvement and to validate\nmultidimensional measures (e.g., Ainlay & Smith,\nThis work was stimulated by Mindel and Vaughan\n(1978), who distinguished between formal, institu-\ntional, public (\"organizational\") forms of religious\ninvolvement (e.g., religious attendance, church or\nsynagogue membership) and more informal, nonin-\nstitutional, private (\"nonorganizational\") forms of\ninvolvement (e.g., bible study, private prayer, watch-\ning religious television). Subsequent research has\nconfirmed the importance of this distinction, as dif-\nferent religious dimensions exert different effects on\nvarious psychosocial and health-related outcomes\n(e.g., Koenig, Moberg, & Kvale, 1988; Levin, Chat-\nters, & Taylor, 1995). Research questions and study\nhypotheses thus ought to be based more closely on\nthe particular religious construct(s) under consider-\nation in order to avoid the common misperception\nthat all measures containing variations of the word\n\"religion\" are interchangeable and equally valid indi-\ncators of an imaginary \"singular something called\nSecond, religious gerontologists must recognize\nthat psychological well-being is also best character-\nized as multidimensional. Within gerontology and\ngeriatrics, numerous measurement instruments have\nbeen developed to assess the various dimensions or\ndomains of well-being, such as life satisfaction, de-\npressed affect, positive affect, congruence, and symp-\ntomatology (see Levin & Tobin, 1995). In religious\nresearch, however, single items or unidimensional\nindices are too often used, and results are general-\nized to \"well-being\" or \"mental health\" as a whole. It\nis important for research questions and hypotheses\nto be framed explicitly in terms of the particular\naspect(s) of well-being under study, certain of which\n(especially depression and affect or mood disorder)\nhave been the subject of considerable clinical re-\nsearch among geriatricians (Koenig & Blazer, 1992).\nThird, according to Koenig and associates (Koenig,\nSmiley, & Gonzales, 1988), there is \"a dire need for\nlongitudinal studies that follow middle-aged persons\n... over time into late old age\" (p. 162), especially in\nthe area of religion and well-being. Relatively few\nstudies in this area have explored religious effects on\nwell-being longitudinally (e.g., Anson, Antonovsky,\nliams, Larson, Buckler, Heckmann, & Pyle, 1991), but\nthe presence of at least some positive findings sug-\ngests the need to pursue this more carefully. Evi-\ndence of both cohort and aging effects in religious\nwell as the often-noted presence of confounding\nbetween behavioral measures of religious involve-\nment and functional or somatic measures of health\nand well-being in cross-sectional analyses of older-\nadult samples (see Levin, 1989), points to the value of\nlongitudinal research.\nFourth, unlike other areas within gerontology,\nconsiderable research has focused on patterns and\noutcomes of religious involvement within particular\nracial and ethnic minority groups -- notably the work\nof Taylor and associates on African Americans (sum-\nmarized in Chatters & Taylor, 1994) and of Markides\nand associates on Mexican Americans (e.g., Levin &\nAdditional work has drawn on samples of African-\nAmerican respondents (e.g., Brown & Gary, 1987,\n1995) and has examined black-white differences in\ndimensions of well-being (e.g., St. George & McNa-\nmara, 1984). Nonetheless, nearly all of these studies\nare cross-sectional, empirical research on U.S. His-\npanics has declined over the past decade, and partic-\nular analyses tend to focus on a respective single\ndimension of well-being.\nFinally, as in much of social gerontology, empirical\nresearch has been mostly atheoretical, the justifica-\ntion being that little is known and thus purely \"ex-\nploratory\" research is required. On the contrary,\ning the effects of religious variables have been pub-\nlished in the aging literature (Levin, 1995a), many\nfocusing on mental health and well-being outcomes.\nFurther, within this area over the past 25 years, half a\ndozen competing mid-range theoretical perspec-\ntives can be identified (Levin, 1989), although they\nare often more implicit than explicit. Several geron-\ntologists interested in religion and well-being re-\ncently have begun more explicitly to evaluate alter-\nnative theoretical perspectives (Krause & Tran, 1989),\ntest well-specified multifactorial structural models\n& Taylor, 1995), and develop comprehensive theoret-\nical frameworks for examining religious effects on\nwell-being outcomes such as depression (Ellison,\n1994). Research on religion, aging, and well-being is\nwell enough along that theory- or hypothesis-driven\ndesigns and analyses are a reasonable minimum ex-\npectation for current and future studies in this area.\nResearch Issues and Hypotheses\nThis particular study redresses each of these limita-\ntions, while also revisiting and updating a program of\nresearch on Mexican Americans conducted from the\nreports based on three samples from Texas -- a small\ninterview study of low-income and mostly Mexican-\nAmerican elderly respondents, a panel study of older\nMexican Americans and Anglos, and a three-genera-\ntions study of Mexican Americans -- Markides and\nassociates examined the impact of religious atten-\ndance on measures of health and well-being. Cross-\nsectional path analysis findings revealed a positive\neffect on life satisfaction of an index of activity,\nincluding a measure of religious attendance, net of\nthe effects of health (Markides & Martin, 1979). This\nfinding for religious attendance and life satisfaction\nwas replicated in two-wave panel data on both Mexi-\ncan Americans and Anglos (Markides, 1983;\nMarkides, Levin, & Ray, 1987). A third wave of data\nshowed a similar but nonsignificant trend, with inter-\npretation complicated by health-related sample attri-\ntion and the confounding of religious attendance\nand health status in older respondents (Markides,\nLevin, & Ray, 1987). Similar cross-sectional findings\nfor religious attendance were also obtained with\nrespect to subjective health in older Mexican Ameri-\ncans (Markides & Martin, 1983). Three-generations\ndata also revealed consistent cross-sectional effects\nfor religious attendance: positive effects on subjec-\ntive health in the oldest generation and protective\neffects against physical symptoms in the youngest\ngeneration (Levin & Markides, 1985); positive effects\non subjective health in older and younger women,\nnet of the effects of social support and social class\n(Levin & Markides, 1986); and positive effects on life\nsatisfaction in older men and older and middle-aged\nwomen, the latter two findings net of the effects of\nsubjective and functional health (Levin & Markides,\n1988). In sum, this body of work suggests that the\nfrequency of religious attendance is a cross-sectional\ncorrelate of life satisfaction in older Mexican Ameri-\ncans, and that this effect withstands controlling for\nthe effects of subjective health, long believed to be\nthe principal correlate of well-being in older adults\nThis study seeks to extend this earlier work on the\neffects of religious attendance on psychological well-\nbeing among Mexican Americans in several ways.\nFirst, a second wave of data is now available on the\nthree-generations study respondents, so this associa-\ntion can be examined in the context of both in-\ntergenerational differences and temporal change si-\nmultaneously. Second, additional dimensions of\nwell-being will be examined, in order to better specify\nhow and understand why religious attendance influ-\nences well-being in this population. These dimen-\nsions include life satisfaction, depressed affect, and\npositive affect. Third, path analysis will be used to\nexamine across two waves of data the associations\nbetween religious attendance and each well-being\noutcome in respective multifactorial models. Effects\nwill be estimated separately by generational cohort,\nand analyses will also be rerun controlling for the\neffects of subjective health, age, and other known\nsociodemographic correlates or predictors of reli-\ngious attendance and well-being. These two-wave\npanel models will enable the estimation of longitudi-\nnal effects of religious attendance (at Time 1) on psy-\nchological well-being (at Time 2), adjusting for Time 1\nwell-being and Time 2 attendance (see Figure 1).\nBased on earlier findings, several study hypothe-\nses can be posed. Each hypothesis pertains to a\nparticular dimension of psychological well-being.\nHypothesis 7. -- It is hypothesized that religious\nattendance will be cross-sectionally associated with\nlife satisfaction at Time 2, as it was at Time 1 (Levin &\nMarkides, 1988). This finding is expected primarily\namong older respondents, reflecting the role of for-\nmal, institutional religious involvement in establish-\ning continuity across life-course stages, emphasizing\nthe intrinsic and enduring meaning of life, fostering a\nsense of feeling blessed by God, and providing both\npersonal and community resources that enhance\ncoping with age-associated losses (Tobin, 1991). Pat-\nterns of religious attendance at a given time thus\nshould be related to feelings of life satisfaction,\nwhich, more than depressed or positive affect, ap-\npear to embody reflection about one's current life\nFigure 1. The proposed panel model of religious attendance and\npsychological well-being.\nHypothesis 2. -- It is hypothesized that religious\nattendance will exert an epidemiologically protective\neffect on depressed affect. This expectation is based\non longitudinal findings that suggest a salutary im-\npact of religious attendance on subsequent depres-\nsion (Idler & Kasl, 1992), perhaps due to buffering the\ndeleterious cumulative effects of life stress on men-\ntal health (Williams et al., 1991). Prior findings from a\nsample of respondents drawn from the full adult age\nrange indicate that this effect may not be limited just\nto older adults (see Williams et al., 1991).\nHypothesis 3. -- It is hypothesized that religious\nattendance will have a significant positive relation-\nship with positive affect, although whether this mani-\nfests cross-sectionally or longitudinally is uncertain.\nPrior gerontological studies of religion and well-be-\ning have emphasized measures of either life satisfac-\ntion or depressed affect and related \"negative\" men-\ntal health outcomes. Relatively little of this research\nsince 1980 has investigated the effects of religious at-\ntendance on \"positively\" defined mood-related con-\nstructs (see Levin, 1995a), and findings are mixed.\nReligious attendance has been found to be associ-\nated cross-sectionally with measures of happiness\n(Lee & Ishi-Kuntz, 1987), but nonsignificant findings\nhave been reported as well (Ellison, 1991). In addi-\ntion, this research has not been limited to the older-\nadult age range, so there is no pressing reason to\nexpect a salutary effect to appear solely among the\noldest cohort. Prior findings also do not indicate\nwhether a relationship, if it emerges, would with-\nstand controlling for the effects of known sociode-\nmographic correlates of religious attendance and\npositive affect.\nIn sum, religious attendance is hypothesized to\nhave (a) a positive cross-sectional association with\nlife satisfaction, especially among older respon-\ndents, (b) a salutary longitudinal effect on depressed\naffect, and (c) a significant positive relationship of\nsome type with positive affect. Whether religious\nattendance also exerts longitudinal effects on life\nsatisfaction or is cross-sectionally associated with\ndepressed affect is uncertain. Panel data from older\nIsraeli Jews suggest not (Anson et al., 1990).\nMethods\nThe Study\nA three-generations study of Mexican Americans\nwas originally conducted in the San Antonio area\nsampling procedures were employed to select older\nMexican Americans (aged 65 to 80) who had children\nand adult grandchildren (18 years old and over) living\nwithin 50 miles of San Antonio, Texas. An eligible\ngrandchild was then selected randomly, a process\nthat also identified the middle-aged parent who was\nthe son or daughter of the oldest-generation respon-\ndent. The total sample consisted of 375 such three-\ngeneration lineages, amounting to a total of 1,125\nrespondents.\nRespondents were followed up approximately 11\n(56%) were reinterviewed.

The findings reported in this study are\nbased on respondents interviewed at both times.\nThe sample used in this study has the following\nsociodemographic characteristics at Time 1, from\noldest to youngest generation: respondents have a\nApproximately 84% of respondents are Roman Cath-\nolic, with little variation by generation.\nMeasures\nThis study includes a single-item measure of reli-\ngious attendance, three summary scales measuring\ndimensions of psychological well-being (life satisfac-\ntion, depressed affect, and positive affect), and six\nexogenous constructs, including subjective health.\nThe well-being measures are derived from existing\ninstruments that have been used extensively in studies\nof Hispanic and ethnic-minority populations, includ-\ning research conducted by the present investigators.\nFrequency of attendance at religious services is\nmeasured by a single ordinal item, \"How often do\nyou attend religious services?\" (coded: 4 = once a\nweek or more often, 3 = two or three times a month,\n2 = once a month, 1 = less frequently). High scores\non this indicator therefore signify more frequent\nreligious attendance.\nLife satisfaction is measured by the 13-item version\nof the Life Satisfaction Index (LSI) originally pro-\nposed by Neugarten, Havighurst, and Tobin (1961).\nThe LSI assesses agreement with general statements\nabout life, and subsequent research has identified\ndimensions of mood tone, zest, and congruence\n(Liang, 1984). The present study uses the trichoto-\nmous scoring system proposed by Wood, Wylie, and\nSheafor (1969). This revision, known as the LSIA, is\ncoded such that a score of 2 = agree, 1 = uncertain,\nand 0 = disagree. Reliability analysis conducted in\nSAS software (using the CORR procedure with the\nALPHA option) led to the deletion of three LSI items,\nand the resulting 10-item scale had acceptable a-\nreliabilities across the three generations and two\nwaves of observation (from oldest to youngest gen-\n.74). In this study, the overall score (range: 0-2) was\ncalculated by averaging responses across the scale's\nDepressed affect and positive affect are measured\nby the respective seven-item depressed affect and\nfour-item positive affect subscales (Liang, Tran,\nEpidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale\n(Radloff, 1977).

Reliabilities for\ndepressed affect (range: 0-21) were very high at both\nwere stable across waves. Reliabilities for positive\naffect (range: 0-12) were somewhat lower but still\nquite acceptable at both waves of observation (Time\nExogenous constructs used in these analyses con-\nsist of five sociodemographic variables and a single-\nitem self-rating of health status. These include age (at\nTime 1), gender (1 = female, 0 = male), education\n(years of school completed), marital status (1 = mar-\nried, 0 = not married), employment status (1 = yes,\n0 = no), and subjective health (4 = excellent, 3 =\ngood, 2 = fair, 1 = poor). In this study, from oldest\nto youngest generation, respondents' mean ratings\nData Analysis\nThis study has two objectives: (a) to identify gener-\national differences and temporal changes in religious\nattendance and three dimensions of psychological\nwell-being, and (b) to examine multifactorial panel\nmodels of the effects of religious attendance on\nthese dimensions of psychological well-being and\ntest respective hypotheses. Each study objective has\na respective data analysis strategy.\nTo address the first objective, generational differ-\nences and temporal changes in each of the four study\nconstructs are examined through two-way analyses\nof variance (ANOVAs) using a factorial design that\ntests for main effects of generation and time and for\ntheir multiplicative interaction. In these analyses, the\n\"Type III\" solution is presented, whereby both main\neffects and the interaction term are estimated simul-\ntaneously (Freund & Littell, 1981). This type of analy-\nsis has been used successfully in prior gerontological\nresearch on religion (Levin & Taylor, 1993; Levin,\nTo address the second objective, two-wave path\nmodels are tested separately by generation and di-\nmension of psychological well-being. These models\nare fully recursive, with constructs \"causally\" or-\ndered, as in Figure 1, from Time 1 religious atten-\ndance to Time 1 psychological well-being to Time 2\nreligious attendance to Time 2 psychological well-\nbeing. The models are estimated twice: first, specify-\ning the endogenous constructs only (Model I); sec-\nond, controlling for the effects of the six exogenous\nconstructs -- age, gender, education, marital status,\nemployment status, and subjective health (Model II).\nSeparate path models are estimated for each genera-\ntion for each of the three identified dimensions of\npsychological well-being.\nAll analyses were conducted using the REG and\nResults\nDescriptive Results\nAs shown in Table 1, there are statistically signifi-\ncant generational differences and/or temporal\nchanges in all three of the psychological well-being\nmeasures and in religious attendance. First, life satis-\nfaction is lowest among the oldest generation and\nincreases from Time 1 to Time 2. Although these\ndifferences and changes are statistically significant,\nthey are not substantively large. Second, depressed\naffect is highest among the oldest generation at both\ntimes, and this generational difference is relatively\npronounced. In terms of the hypothetical range of\nthis subscale (0-21), however, this cohort, on aver-\nage, is largely unafflicted with depressed affect at\nboth Time 1 and Time 2. Third, positive affect in-\ncreases from Time 1 to Time 2, and there is a visible\nbut nonsignificant trend toward less positive affect in\nthe oldest generation at both times. In light of the\nhypothetical range of this subscale (0-12), these re-\nspondents, on average, show moderately high levels\nof positive affect at both Time 1 and Time 2.\nFor religious attendance, there are statistically\nsignificant generational differences and temporal\nchanges, as well as a significant interaction. At Time\n1, there is a gradient such that religious attendance is\nless frequent in successively younger generational\nTable 1.

From Time 1 to Time 2, there is only a slight\nincrease in attendance in the middle and youngest\ngenerations, but a considerable decline in atten-\ndance in the oldest generation. At Time 1, the oldest\ngeneration attends religious services, on average,\nbetween two or three times a month and weekly or\nmore (mean = 3.21), the highest level of any of the\nsix generation-time combinations. At Time 2, the\noldest generation attends religious services, on aver-\nage, about once a month (mean = 2.38), the lowest\nlevel of any of the generation-time combinations.\nThis decline in religious attendance over time among\nthe oldest generation is the most dramatic finding in\nPanel Analysis Results\nTables 2 through 4 present results of panel analysis\nfor each of the three respective well-being out-\ncomes: life satisfaction, depressed affect, and posi-\ntive affect. In each table, Model I findings represent\ngross effects estimated in analyses that specify struc-\ntural parameters among endogenous constructs\nonly, while Model II findings represent net effects\nderived from rerunning the same analyses control-\nling for exogenous effects.\nModel I findings reveal that (a) religious atten-\ndance exerts statistically significant effects on psy-\nchological well-being, (b) these effects are different\nfor different dimensions of well-being, and (c) these\neffects vary by generation. Most notable of these\nfindings are cross-sectional associations between re-\nligious attendance and life satisfaction, as hypothe-\nsized, and longitudinal effects of religious atten-\ndance on depressed and positive affect, also as\nhypothesized. Specifically, Time 1 religious atten-\ndance is associated with Time 1 life satisfaction in the\ntwo oldest generations, and respective Time 2 mea-\nsures are also associated in the two oldest genera-\ntions (see Table 2). This confirms Hypothesis 1,\nwhich anticipated cross-sectional effects. In addi-\ntion, there are no longitudinal effects of Time 1\nreligious attendance on Time 2 life satisfaction, but\nnone were necessarily expected. For measures of\naffect, findings are just the opposite. Time 1 religious\nattendance is associated with less depressed affect at\nTime 2 within the youngest generation (see Table 3).\nThis longitudinal effect confirms Hypothesis 2. Time\n1 religious attendance is also associated with greater\npositive affect at Time 2 in the youngest generation\n(see Table 4). This confirms the more uncertain ex-\npectations contained in Hypothesis 3. Finally, reli-\ngious attendance and both affect measures are unas-\nsociated cross-sectionally, at both waves, but\ncross-sectional associations, at least for depressed\naffect, were not specifically hypothesized. It should\nbe kept in mind that estimation of these longitudinal\neffects on Time 2 affect controls for the effects of\nTime 1 scores on these respective indices.\nModel II findings present net effects for religious\nattendance on each of the three well-being dimen-\nsions. These results represent the Model I analyses\nrerun controlling for the structural effects of the six\nexogenous constructs (age, gender, education, mari-\ntal status, employment status, and subjective health).\nIn these analyses, the principal findings from the\nModel I analyses remain: (a) a cross-sectional associ-\nation between religious attendance and life satisfac-\ntion in the two oldest generations, although only at\nTime 1, and (b) a longitudinal effect of Time 1 reli-\ngious attendance on Time 2 depressed and positive\naffect in the youngest generation. All of these effects\nare notable in that they are independent of both\nTime 1 affect scores and the effects of health, age,\nand other known sociodemographic correlates or\npredictors of both religious attendance and well-\nbeing.\nAlthough upholding Model I results for life satis-\nfaction and depressed affect, and thus reaffirming\nHypotheses 1 and 2, Model II findings add some\ncomplicated twists with respect to positive affect (see\nTable 4).

In other words, for the generation of grand-\nchildren, frequent religious attendance at Time 1 is\nassociated with less positive affect at Time 2 once the\neffects of health and sociodemographic characteris-\ntics are taken into account. Supplementary analyses\nreveal that two of these exogenous variables, being\nfemale and years of education, exert respective posi-\nnet effects on Time 2 positive affect in this genera-\ntion. Considerable prior research has shown positive\nbivariate effects of each of these variables on both\nreligious attendance and positive affect, so perhaps\nthe negative net effect of education on Time 2 posi-\ntive affect has contributed to this anomalous finding.\nAnother possibility is the presence of multicollinear-\nity related to the exogenous effects of education, not\nuncommon in gerontological research on well-being\nAnother complicated twist in the association be-\ntween religious attendance and positive affect\nemerges in the oldest generation. In Model I, Time 2\nreligious attendance and Time 2 positive affect in this\ngeneration are unrelated (p = -.13, n.s.), whereas in\n1 they are negatively associated (p = -.26, p <\n.05). Perhaps contributing to this association is a\npositive affect on Time 2 religious attendance in\nModel II, a counterintuitive association not present\nin Model 1 (p = .10, n.s.). In addition, positive affect\nis the only one of the three well-being dimensions\nwhose Time 1 score does not uniformly predict its\nTime 2 score. Further, although it is well-docu-\nmented that declining levels of well-being in older\nage cohorts are reflective of age-related declines in\nhealth that operate to restrict religious attendance\n(Levin, 1989), positive affect in this study increases\nover time, on average, and supplementary analyses\nshow that health is not a significant predictor of\nsubsequent positive affect ((3 = .10, n.s.). Additional\nanalyses in the oldest generation also confirm that\nage exerts a strong negative effect ((3 = -.33, p <\n.001) on Time 2 religious attendance net of the effects\nof Time 1 measures of both religious attendance and\npositive affect. It is suggested, then, that this rather\nconfusing situation for positive affect may be an\nartifact of the well-known confounding that exists\namong religious attendance, age, and well-being\noutcomes among elderly adults (Levin, 1989). Alter-\nnatively, it may signify that positive affect in general,\nor this particular measure, is simply not reflective of\nthe many more valid well-being measures typically\nused in prior gerontological studies, such as use of\nthe LSIA for life satisfaction or the CES-D for de-\npressed affect.\nDiscussion\nIn summary, this study of Mexican Americans\nhas found that (a) religious attendance is cross-sec-\ntionally associated with life satisfaction among mem-\nbers of the oldest and middle generations, and (b)\nreligious attendance has salutary longitudinal effects\non depressed affect among members of the young-\nest generation. These cross-sectional findings for life\nsatisfaction at Time 1 and these longitudinal findings\nfor depressed affect both withstand controlling for\nthe effects of health, age, and other known sociode-\nmographic correlates or predictors of both religious\nattendance and psychological well-being. The net\nfindings of a positive cross-sectional association be-\ntween religious attendance and life satisfaction in\nolder respondents and a salutary longitudinal effect\nof religious attendance on subsequent depressed\naffect each confirm hypothesized expectations. The\nresults of this study have important implications for\nresearch on (a) Hispanic families, (b) minority aging,\nand (c) religious factors in mental health and well-\nbeing.\nFirst, these findings confirm earlier work pointing\nto the importance of regular, formal religious in-\nvolvement, such as religious attendance, for the\nwell-being of Mexican-American families. Findings\ncans, who are overwhelmingly Roman Catholic in\naffiliation, attend religious services Jess frequently\nthan U.S. Catholics in general Further, the fre-\nquency of religious attendance has been found to\ndecline with successive generations of three-genera-\ntional Mexican-American families (Markides & Cole,\n1984), despite high levels of intergenerational con-\nsistency in religious affiliation (Aldous & Hill, 1965;\nMarkides & Cole, 1984). Nevertheless, religious at-\ntendance is a significant correlate or predictor of\nsubjective health (Markides & Martin, 1983) and life\nsatisfaction (Markides, Levin, & Ray, 1987) in older\nMexican Americans, and, according to the present\nstudy, a correlate of life satisfaction in middle-aged\nMexican Americans and a protective factor with re-\nspect to depressed affect in the youngest generation,\nas well. Religious attendance serves as a source of\nconnectedness to one's cultural traditions and, thus,\nfor older and middle-aged adults, represents a sali-\nent correlate of life satisfaction. For members of the\nyoungest generation, more acculturated than their\nelders and less regular in their religious participa-\ntion, religious attendance may not be as direct a\nsource of contemporaneous life satisfaction, but\nrather may serve a protective function for mood\ndisorders over time, perhaps reflecting the increas-\ning importance of religion for this cohort as it ages\ninto the child-rearing years.\nSecond, religious involvement is widely held to be\na crucial resource in the lives of older adults, a radix\nof meaning (Post, 1992) that is especially valuable as\nindividuals begin to disengage from other roles and\nformal institutional involvements due to retirement,\ndeclining health, or other reasons. Religious atten-\ndance benefits older adults both through providing\naccess to church- and synagogue-based social ser-\nvices of various types and through the \"personal\nsatisfactions\" enhanced by worship and religiosity\n(Moberg, 1990). Among these personal benefits of\nreligion are the provision of hope (Koenig, 1994b)\nand a means of \"preserving the self\" (Tobin, 1991), as\nwell as the offer of forgiveness and reconciliation\nwith God (Kaplan, Munroe-Blum, & Blazer, 1994). For\nminority elders, religion and churchgoing provide a\nsense of continuity and help to maintain ties to the\nchurch, a repository of culture and ethos and often\nthe principal autonomous social institution in re-\nspective ethnic-minority communities. According to\nEllison (1994), formal religious involvement also ben-\nefits the well-being of older adults through more\ntangible means, such as by reducing the risk of\nchronic and acute stressors, offering cognitive and\ninstitutional frameworks that buffer stress and facili-\ntate coping, and providing both internal psychologi-\ncal resources (such as self-efficacy) and concrete so-\ncial resources. The present study's findings linking\nreligious attendance to satisfaction with life reflect\nthe salutary impact of these themes -- meaning,\ncontinuity, and control -- in the lives of older Mexi-\ncan Americans.\nFinally, these results provide solid evidence of\nsalutary effects for religious involvement on at least\ntwo different domains of mental health and psycho-\nlogical well-being. As in recently published work on\nolder African Americans (Levin, Chatters, & Taylor,\n1995), religious attendance is positively associated\nwith life satisfaction even after controlling for the\neffects of health. The present study thus provides\nreplication of this result in a different ethnic popula-\ntion and represents further evidence that the benefi-\ncial impact of organizational religious activities on\nthe well-being of older adults is not solely the result\nof the confounding often found to exist between\nreligious attendance and health status (see Ainlay,\nSingleton, & Swigert, 1992). More importantly, this\nstudy provides strong evidence of a salutary longitu-\ndinal effect of religious attendance on depressed\naffect. This is especially noteworthy in that a protect-\nive effect on depressed affect persists across the 11\nyears between waves of data collection and with-\nstands controlling for the effects of both Time 1 affect\nand Time 2 religious attendance. These findings echo\nthe suggestion (Ellison, 1994; Koenig, Smiley, & Gon-\nreligious involvement deserves further scrutiny as a\npossible risk factor in psychiatric epidemiology.\nReferences\nAinlay, S.
