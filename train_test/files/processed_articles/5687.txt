    "abstract": "Abstract\nIf we accept that surveillance by the State and `sousveillance' by the media in Western democracies tend towards a\nrelative equilibrium, or `equiveillance' supported by the function of journalism as a watchdog and that the rule of law\nlargely protects fundamental freedoms, this paper argues that the act of `mutual watching' is undesired by the State and\ncomes at a very high cost to journalists. The combination of technological capacity, legislative change and antidemocratic\nsentiments of the State, in the context of its willingness and ability to collect and process Big Data on an unprecedented\nscale, disrupt the preconditions for a strong democracy based on free media and free citizens. This paper examines the\npolitics of investigative journalism under the conditions of dominance of the State by investigating the experiences of\njournalists with surveillance. Our interviews with 48 journalists show that journalists are acutely aware of surveillance\nand its noxious impact. Well beyond simple `watching' these experiences are remarkably similar in non-Western and\nWestern countries. Journalists are engaging increasingly with technological and other communities, as they aim to defend\njournalism and their lives. Their activism is operationalised in three areas: (a) in reluctant often-fraught cooperation with\nhacktivists, (b) in self-directed protection of communications and sources and (c) in not always willingly acting as\ndissenters vis-a-vis the State. This paper explores the extent to which journalists consider equilibrium to be distorted,\nand how they are countering any slide into subdued democracy.\n",

He notes that\nalthough the news media have reported on this asym-\nmetry, their doing so cannot be considered `reciprocal'\nsurveillance because for the most part it amounts to\nunderscoring `just how little we know about the gov-\nernment's use of new media technology to accumulate,\nstore, and sort information about citizens' (Andrejevic,\nCarlson (2002), subjects willingly participate in their\nown surveillance, possibly due to a commodification\nof privacy, in which its value as a human right is no\nlonger recognised but it is willingly compromised in\nreturn for consumer benefits. Furthermore, the possi-\nbility of opting out of such bartered-away privacy and\nself-facilitation of consumer surveillance may in most\ninstances be illusory (Elmer, 2003). There is nonetheless\na growing willingness to organise monitoring of, and\nresistance to, what Fernback (2013) calls networked\nsurveillance by actors such as Facebook. `These actions\nare an attempt at equality and responsibility in a demo-\ncratic society that disrupts the institutionalized power\n`Sousveillance' or `surveillance from below'\n2013) and its interplay with the media and politico-\nstrategic communication has evolved rapidly (Bakir,\n2010), tending \u00ad at least in Western democracies \u00ad\ntowards a form of equiveillance (Mann et al., 2006), an\nuneasy constantly threatened balance between the sur-\nveillors and the surveilled, who make use of easily access-\nible rapidly evolving citizen media surveillance\ntechnology.

An examination of the ways in which news\nmedia are reacting to counter the effects of such sur-\nveillance, legislation and efforts at manipulation or how\nthey might seek equiveillance, as described by Mann\net al. (2006), is also necessary. Even how journalists\nare using advances in technology, such as encryption\nand other secure forms of communication, and means\nof countering surveillance is rather under-researched.\nMann et al. (2003) describe, in more general terms,\nthe turning against, or `detournement' of surveillance\ntechniques, by the surveilled against the surveillors as\nreflectionism, but do not make the case specifically for\njournalists. Bakir (2015) highlights this paucity of\nresearch, noting that only a fraction of academic journal\narticles deal with the interplay between intelligence agen-\ncies' agenda-setting and journalism. Bakir explores\nthe ways in which mass surveillance impacts on the\ndemocratic process and the media, including the erosion\nof the watchdog role of the media, and the weakening of\ndemocracy as a whole, particularly in conjunction with\nother restrictive legislation linked to national security\nFollowing the outline of relevant, limited, scholar-\nship and after a description of methodological con-\ncerns, this paper reports on the findings deriving from\nin depth interviews with journalists with regard to these\nunder-studied questions.

We do so, by taking as our departing point\nthe well-documented fears of and criticisms against\nthe capacity and practice of mass surveillance over citi-\nzens and journalists.

Existing\nacademic and other writings and reports allowed us\nto identify an array of possibilities of interference as\nwell as counteraction. Second, we identified journalists\nwho fulfil the following characteristics: they are known\nfor their investigative work; have 10 years' experience\nin the field or more; engage in international topics;\nwork with major media companies. We aimed to\nensure and capture experience and knowledge in inves-\ntigative journalism of a `before' and `after' picture of\nsurveillance. Almost all of our subjects are also either\nstaff members of, or have close ties to, major media\ncompanies, and/or stable employment conditions\nto the degree that these are achievable under the finan-\ncial crisis, hence they can rely on the relative security\nnecessary to pursue investigative work. We interviewed\n51 individuals, 42 of whom are journalists (US: 7;\nGermany: 5; Austria: 5; Hungary: 3; UK: 3; Greece 4;\nTurkey: 3; France: 2; Morocco: 1; Netherlands: 1; Syria:\nZimbabwe: 1; Poland: 1), working in print, broadcast\nand online. We interviewed eight media experts, includ-\ning former journalists, active in media research/advocacy\nfor NGOs and a university (Poland: 3; Hungary: 2; UK:\n1; US: 1; Serbia: 1). Two of the journalists we inter-\nviewed also have experience of media advocacy for an\nNGO. Finally, we also interviewed one whistle-blower.\nThe selection of interviewees was a combination of\naccessibility and an effort to include journalists based\nin countries with varying degrees of freedom.

Our aim was to explore the\nviews and strategies of journalists in the current climate\nof mass surveillance, whether effective or not, and in\nrelation to the future of journalism. Interviews lasted\nbetween 15 minutes and two hours and took place not\nonly in private or public physical spaces, but also online\nand by phone. In some cases, interview appointments\nwere arranged without electronic means and/or on\nsome occasions mobile telephones were not present,\ni.e. carried by the researchers or the interviewee. We\nused online technology that is argued to provide some\nbasic protection of privacy. Our data analysis is based\non inductively identifying themes as they emerged from\nthe discussions with journalists. Interviews were semi-\nstructured with the aim to allow professionals them-\nselves to identify core issues with surveillance and\nto speak of coping and their tactics of resistance.\nWe aimed at addressing a comprehensive universe of\nfactors from technology to media organisation, and\nfrom personal views to professional judgements with\nregard to the profession and democracy. Hence we fol-\nlowed ground theory practices to allow the data to\nspeak for itself, but starting from the basic categories\nof enquiry. Further, we sought to identify patterns,\nconnections and divergence among the responses and\nconnect those back to the political, economic and insti-\ntutional dimensions of the journalistic environment(s).\nHere, we use only those names and quotes for which we\nwere given permission but also draw upon information\ngiven by the anonymised subjects.\nLegislative pressure\nIn recent years, the immediate aftermath of terror\nattacks in the USA in 2001 and later in Madrid,\nLondon, Paris and Brussels have brought about a\npublic discourse ready to compromise on fundamental\nrights in the name of security, enhanced through new\nlegislation that has enshrined in law the right of State\nactors to gather and analyse enormous amounts of\ncommunications data. The Patriot Act, passed just six\nweeks after 11 September, facilitated spying on ordin-\nary American citizens through surveillance of phone\nand email communication, of bank and credit card rec-\nords, and of Internet activity (American Civil Liberties\n9/11 are serving to speed up and spread out such\nsurveillance in ways that bode ill for democracy, per-\nsonal liberties, social trust and mutual care' (p. 6).\nThe Snowden revelations in 2013 subsequently\nshowed the degree to which secretive mass surveillance\nof huge numbers of innocent American citizens had\nbeen conducted by the NSA for years, including the\nsystematic gathering of phone records of tens of\nMills and Sarikakis 3\nmillions of people, and the routine, direct tapping into the\nservers of nine US Internet companies including Google,\nFacebook and Microsoft (BBC, 2014). Meanwhile, the\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance court, tasked with\napproving requests for surveillance of a foreign subject,\nin which the communications of US citizens may be\ncaught up, meets in secret (The Guardian, 2015c).\nMetadata surveillance coupled with unprecedented\ntechnological surveillance analysis capacities make it\nfar easier to identify journalists' sources.

The operational security meas-\nures now used range from `burner' throwaway mobile\nphones, which are more difficult to monitor, to the\ndeliberate destruction of email correspondence so that\nit cannot be used in possible future legal proceedings\nor to identify secret sources, to an emphasis on face-to-\nface meetings with confidential sources, to eschewing\nelectronic communication and its associated surveil-\nlance risks entirely, and to the setting up of\nboth online and physical dead drop boxes, like that of\nThe Guardian in New York.\nJournalists are also much more cautious now about\ncross-border travel with data and what their email trail\nindicates. `I'd definitely be careful about not carrying,\nespecially across a border, some material that contains\nthe names of sources who were confidential who\nI thought might get in trouble and I've become much\nmore careful about what I put in emails, that's for sure,'\nsays New York Times national security reporter Scott\nthat I exchanged with John Kiriakou that turned up in\nthat prosecution I thought of at the time, and I think of\ntoday, as completely innocent and not revealing any\nkind of criminal action on his part.

You have to take that first\nstep of ensuring that you don't store any data on phys-\nical storage devices that are kept in your home.'\nThere is also the challenge of securing data, not just\ncommunications. Polish investigative journalist\nMakarenko says: `Everything we collect needs to be\nsecured, and so far this is not the case. More and\nmore sensitive data will be moved to the cloud. The\nquestion is who is going to manage the cloud.'\nThere's a flip side to using digital security, though,\nespecially in undemocratic countries like Russia.\nRussian journalist Andrei Soldatov (interview 29\nFebruary 2016) warns that if journalists start using\nencryption, that really gets the Federal Security\nService interested in them because they feel that they\nmust have something suspicious to hide. But there's\nanother aspect for journalists where the danger of phys-\nical harm for journalists is high: `Imagine you have\nyour laptop locked, encrypted with all the latest cut-\nting-edge technologies . . . you cross the border and you\nmight be stopped by border troops at the airport or\nsome other border control point, and you might be\nasked to open your laptop. At that point you might\ncompromise in order to be let in or not to miss your\nflight.' Another possibility, says Soldatov, is that `you\nare stopped with your encrypted laptop in a conflict\nzone. This happened to a journalist for Novaya\nGazeta who was stopped by separatists and put in jail\nand he was ``kindly'' asked to provide the password or\nthey would ``break all his fingers. . .''. Sometimes the\nMills and Sarikakis 7\nbest encryption is to not bring your laptop with you at\nall or to have a blank laptop with no emails, no photo-\ngraphs, just a basic device, that's all.'\nVeteran UK investigative journalist Duncan\ninvestigative journalists should not fall into the trap of\nrelying entirely on the security offered by digital secur-\nity: `Forget all the magic crypto-stuff . . . Secure Drop\nand all of the other new-fangled stuff is of no use at\nall if the metadata that [the sources] may have left in\nnumerous places which identifies their exploratory jour-\nney or contemplation of ethical issues can be\nfound . . . You have a stack of burner phones and a\nplan . . . so that you do not go for the tecchie solu-\ntion . . . but as soon as possible, and as untraceably as\npossible you break the metadata trail and you have to\nget to human contact with that person.' And if you're\nmeeting a source, `don't take your phone.'\nIn some instances, surveillance may not have the\nintended effect of completely subduing journalists,\nprompting a degree of anger and stubborn determin-\nthe term `reactance' to describe a condition in which\n`people will be upset at their loss of freedom, will\nincrease efforts to exercise their free speech, and may\nattack the agents of the surveillance.' Such `reactance'\nlies at the heart of Lyon's assertion (2015) that there is\nhope for a fightback against the surveillance state.\nAn emerging nexus? Traditionally\nreluctant to embrace `activism',\njournalists join forces with hacktivists\nto fight back\nIn the age of social media, in which the ability to record\nand disseminate information lies at virtually every-\nbody's fingertips, the line between journalism and activ-\nism is in many instances becoming increasingly blurred\n(NiemanReports, 2014), unnerving many traditional\njournalists who consider activism to be entirely separate\nfrom journalism. Many journalists would agree with\nthe view of Guardian columnist and digital media pro-\nfessor Dan Gilmor who argues that professional jour-\nnalists should be: thorough; accurate; fair; independent\n(not in terms of being free of the inherent biases of\nemployers and one's self, but in the sense of being will-\ning to challenge assumptions) (onMedia, 2014). And\nthey would subscribe to the view of former New York\nTimes media columnist David Carr that `journalists are\nresponsible for following the truth wherever it may\nguide them' (New York Times, 2013). While journalists\nmay also be activists, Carr argues, `activism can also\nimpair vision'. He says: Activists can and often do\nreveal the truth, but the primary objective remains\n`winning the argument' with the `tendentiousness of\nideology' creating `its own argument' (New York\nThe aim of this paper, though, is not to explore\nactivism in its various forms and facets, but rather to\nshed light and provide focus on the impact of surveil-\nlance on democratic journalism through the contextual-\nisation of journalists' practices and experiences.\nDespite the reluctance with which many traditional\njournalists perceive any association with activism,\na pillar of hope for a democratic fightback against sur-\nveillance rests on the emerging nexus between so-called\nhacker activists, or `hacktivists', and journalists report-\ning on sensitive topics such as national security and\nmass surveillance, in which the hackers provide expert-\nise on everything from online security involving encryp-\ntion, to the actual provision to journalists of sensitive\npublic interest information, and the journalists provide\nfor the hackers a platform and reach that would\nbe otherwise unattainable. This notion can be closely\nlinked to a form of `outsider journalism' beyond the\nconfines and challenges of traditional journalism plat-\nforms. Such journalism may herald a form of `sousveil-\nlance' of the future in the age of surveillance,\nparticularly since there is a perception that traditional\nnews platforms, facing an extraordinary array of chal-\nlenges, including business model viability in the online\nage coupled with the explosion of public relations,\ninfluence exertion by corporate owners, the pressures\nof 24-hour live news environments, and now the sur-\nveillance-fuelled ability of governments to identify leaks\nand whistle-blowers \u00ad within or outside the confines of\nthe law \u00ad are increasingly unable or unwilling to tackle\nall or any of the really sensitive stories about which it is\ncrucial that citizenries in healthy democracies know.\nAlthough journalists and hackers or hacktivists are\nin many respects fundamentally different, they share\na similar platform in what Lyon (2015) calls the strug-\ngles over information freedom and control over infor-\nmation, and in some instances wear both hats at the\nsame time. Examples include Julian Assange, and Jacob\nAppelbaum, a hacktivist who as a journalist collabo-\nrated with Der Spiegel on a number of articles covering\nthe Snowden leaks. Appelbaum was also associated\nwith WikiLeaks. Asked if we are seeing a move towards\n`subversive' journalism bringing together outsider dis-\nsenting journalists and hacktivists, MacFadyen (inter-\nsays: `We've seen certain situations recently where jour-\nnalists and hacktivists have collaborated. And we don't\nknow where the recent Panama Papers come from but\nit looks at least possible that that came from a hack.\nWhenever we've worked with any of those kinds of\npeople they are quite bemused by the lack of technical\n8 Big Data & Society\nknowledge or awareness that many of these (news)\norganisations have . . . we can learn from these people\nand should learn.'\nIn another example of such collaboration civil soci-\nety NGOs are helping exiled Syrian journalists in\nTurkey use highly sophisticated security measures\nincluding encrypted software and protocols to minimise\nthe potentially lethal likelihood that the Syrian or\nTurkish regimes, or jihadist groups, can infiltrate elec-\ntronically. Amara worked with activists and IT special-\nists to travel to Syria undercover, to protect her online\npresence including social media accounts through VPN\nnetworks, installed in France. She gave a Syrian hack-\ntivist control of her computer for four or five hours so\nhe could install a VPN network that at that time was\nunbreakable by the Syrian authorities. She also men-\ntioned as an example of effective citizen journalism in\nSyria the group of citizen journalists `Raqqa is Being\nSlaughtered Silently', in reference to the IS-controlled\nnorthern Syrian city of Raqqa, who use the latest digi-\ntal technology to gather and distribute information\nfrom the ground while circumventing surveillance by\nIslamic State. `These guys are not professional journal-\nists but they are taking so much risk . . . doing the same\nthing . . . and creating such an impact.' Meanwhile, US\ninvestigative news platform ProPublica has launched a\nversion of its site on the dark web (through the ano-\nnymous Tor browser network), for readers who want to\nstay anonymous online (The Verge, 2016). Another\nexample of the convergence of hacktivism and journal-\nism is James Ball's transition from working for\nWikiLeaks to working on the Snowden leaks as a jour-\nnalist for The Guardian. There are even joint hackti-\nvism-investigative journalism conferences such as the\nCIJ Logan forum in Berlin, where a sense of common\nground and goals prevails.\nOne of the challenges to this dynamic, however, is\nthe fact that hacktivists do not enjoy the same protec-\ntions as more easily identifiable journalists working for\ntraditional media outlets. It recently emerged for, e.g.\nthat Google was forced to secretly turn over a year's\nworth of Appelbaum's Gmail metadata \u00ad i.e. whom he\nemailed, when, and the details of IP addresses he used\nto log on to his Gmail account \u00ad to US investigators\n(The Intercept, 2015) as part of their investigation into\nWikiLeaks. Appelbaum has chosen to live in Berlin\nwhere, he says, `the cost of physically harassing me or\npolitically harassing me is much higher than when I last\nlived on U.S. soil' (The Intercept, 2015).\nConclusions\nAn attempt of mutual watching, with the aim of bring-\ning about transparency, lay at the core of the acquisi-\ntion and dissemination of information in the WikiLeaks\nand Snowden affairs, and its transformation into jour-\nnalistic material, in a continuation of a journalistic\ntradition that has understood itself as a watchdog.\nIn this era of possible veillance, albeit it with an imbal-\nance of scale and capacity tilted in favour of the State,\njournalism's attempt to take part in a `normalised'\nveillance through the use of Big Data has severe impli-\ncations that do not contribute towards more transpar-\nency, due to the imminent danger of watchdog\njournalism becoming unfeasible. We are finding jour-\nnalists in a state of reacting to surveillance threats,\nwithin a climate of surveillance but not engaging\nunproblematically in surveillance themselves. If we\naccept that mutual watching is operationalised through\nwhistleblowing, then the impact on journalism is prob-\nlematic. Although journalism may have benefited from\naccess to Big Data, it is also paying a high price.\nAs journalists, citizen journalists, and hacktivists\nconverge in a form of new combined journalism seeking\nto challenge the Panoptic erosion of democracy, in defi-\nance of the reluctance the media has traditionally dis-\nplayed with regard to any affiliation with activism, or\nany notion of activist journalism, their task is facili-\ntated by the same online digital world that has allowed\nfor increased surveillance, but that also makes it easier\nfor whistle-blowers to gather and transfer information\nto journalists.\nHowever, throughout the world, the surveillance\npushback against investigative and critical journalists\npursuing sensitive stories, especially in the realm of\nnational security and defence, is intense. The strategy\nof promoting submission and conformity through\nincreasingly advanced and pervasive surveillance is a\nchilling thread that unites governments across the pol-\nitical spectrum, from superficially healthy democracies\nin danger of sliding into Panoptic homogenising self-\ncensorship, eroded illiberal democracies riding waves of\nauthoritarianism, populism and nationalism, and\nrepressive regimes intent on retaining absolute power\nand control. In democracies, surveillance is not directly\nlinked to the threat of assassination and torture, but its\nrelentless march towards ever greater powers and ever\nfewer privacy safeguards, amid the establishment of\nfavourable legislative and institutional governance par-\nameters, is enough to chill the reporting climate and tilt\nthe equiveillant balance of mutual veillance unmistake-\nably in favour of non-transparent state agencies.\nAs democracy erodes more broadly, the pace of the\nshrinkage of watchdog journalism space picks up rap-\nidly because the surveillance is increasingly unaccount-\nable, aligns with politico-financial pressure, conducive\nnew laws and a hollowed-out judiciary, and is linked to\na broader array of veiled and direct threats, including\nimprisonment. Western democracies face the threat of\nan insidious surveillance-fuelled slide towards societal\nMills and Sarikakis 9\nsubmission and conformance that is a hallmark of\nundemocratic regimes.\nAcross the political spectrum surveillance tactics\nemployed against journalists make demonstrative\nthe power of the state while at the same time starkly\nunderscoring the vulnerability of journalists' rights and\nprotections. Apparently arbitrary decision-making on\nthe surveillance of journalists may be designed to illus-\ntrate an intimidating power to disregard \u00ad in some\ninstances even make \u00ad the `rules' governing the flow\nof information in a society, and the fate of journalists.\nIn Western countries, erosive legal frameworks\noften underpin the process. In repressive regimes the\nlaws can be bent, interpreted and ignored at will.\nUltimately, in both democratic and undemocratic\ncountries the goal underlying the surveillance of jour-\nnalists is the same: to cultivate a chilling effect that\npromotes conformance and submission to the domin-\nant governing view. The only major difference lies is the\ndegree of willingness and ability to resort to violence\nfor those journalists who don't get the message. The\ncurrent counter-tactics of journalists offer no guarantee\nas to future strategies. The cost of failure to stem the\nsurveillance tide is incalculable in terms of personal\nresources, mental health and the future of democracy.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAlwood E (2007) Watching the watchdogs: FBI spying\non Journalists in the 1940s.
