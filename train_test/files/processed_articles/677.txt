Eggebeen2\n'Child and Family Development, University of Georgia.\n2Human Development and Family Studies and Population Research Institute, Pennsylvania State University.\nPast research on intergenerational exchanges suggests that parents and adult children remain vitally involved in\nsupportive exchanges in later life. What has not been examined is the long-term importance of patterns of intergen-\nerational exchange for individual mental health and well-being. Using data drawn from the two waves of the Na-\ntional Survey of Families and Households on adults aged SO and older (N = 2237, M^e\nderived from three theoretical explanations of the relationship between exchange patterns and psychological well-\nbeing. Wefound strong evidencefor the importance of contingent exchanges between parents and adult children in\npromoting older adults' psychological well-being. Whereas receiving contingent exchange has positive conse-\nquences, noncontingent giving can have negative consequences around specific transitions in the lives of parents\nand children.\nTHE importance of intergenerational family relation-\nships for the health and well-being of an individual\nhas been the concern of a growing body of research in the\npast decade. This heightened interest is, in part, driven by\nsocial changes in family structure, the changing economy,\nand loss of confidence in the ability of social institutions to\ncontinue to provide a safety net in times of need (Zarit &\nEggebeen, 1995). Despite this greater attention, we still\nknow relatively little about why individuals give. We do not\nknow the particular giving strategies individuals employ,\nunder what circumstances or with what conditions they\naccept support from others, or the effectiveness of their\nparticular exchange strategy. The purpose of this article is\nto address several of these unanswered questions. Specifi-\ncally, we examine the linkage between the mental health of\nolder adults and three distinct patterns of intergenerational\nexchanges.\nThere are three dominant theoretical perspectives on\nwhy individuals give: social exchange theory (Homans,\nBerscheid, & Walster, 1973), and exchange based on need\nSocial exchange theory is based upon economic princi-\nples of costs and rewards and the concept of reinforcement\nfrom behavioral psychology (Homans, 1958; Shornack,\ncial exchange and interaction will continue as long as that\ninteraction is seen as profitable; that is, where perceived re-\nwards are seen to outweigh the costs to an individual; the\nindividual is thus \"overbenefitted.\" These origins led to a\nrelatively mechanistic conception of exchange based heav-\nily upon an individual's perceptions of a particular relation-\nship and his or her ability (or inability) to acquire similar\nbenefits from other sources. It follows, then, that the most\nsatisfying relationships would be those from which an indi-\nvidual was most overbenefitted. Individuals believed to\npossess relatively fewer socially desirable resources, such\nas elderly adults or those from other disadvantaged groups,\nwould be seen as poor partners for social exchange and in-\nteraction and would be likely to have few \"profitable\" so-\ntive, the purpose of social relationships is self-serving--to\ngain the greatest relative benefit possible.\nEmpirical investigations of this theoretical explanation\nfor intergenerational transfers have been fairly limited.\nMost studies are focused on determining how common this\nstrategy is rather than whether it is associated with well-\nbeing. Cox and Rank (1992), using nationally representa-\ntive data on American families, found that routine assis-\ntance is more consistent with the exchange model than with\nalternative specifications. Hogan, Eggebeen, and Clogg\n(1993), using the same data, but employing quite different\nmeasurement models, also found evidence of exchange re-\nlationships in American families. Finally, Spitze and Logan\n(1989) found evidence in their sample, drawn from the Al-\nbany New York area, which is consistent with the idea that\nwomen's investment in caregiving and kin keeping activi-\nties in their early and middle life course creates obligations\nin men and children that lead to assistance in later life.\nThese patterns, of course, are what exchange theory would\npredict.\nAlthough there appears to be evidence that intergenera-\ntional relationships in American families are carried on in a\nfashion that is consistent with exchange theory, there have\nbeen virtually no attempts to assess its \"effectiveness\" for\nthe health and well-being of individuals. A major reason\nfor this is that a careful assessment of this strategy places\ngreat demands on data. With few exceptions, most data on\nintergenerational ties are cross-sectional, which greatly\nlimits the chances of finding evidence for the effectiveness\nof this strategy. This is especially true when one considers\nthat both exchanges and psychological outcomes often\nshare a similar set of predictors. For example, a decline in\nfunctional ability might be accompanied by both receipt of\nmore assistance and higher levels of depression, thus artifi-\ncially inducing a negative correlation between exchange\nand well-being. In one of the few explicit tests of this pat-\ntern of exchanges which controlled for the effects of health,\nfunctional ability, education, marital status, and proximity\nto child of closest contact, McCulloch (1990) found ex-\nchange-type relations between aging parents and adult chil-\ndren were not associated with a measure of morale among\nthe parents.\nEquity theory represents a distinct approach to under-\nstanding intergenerational relationships. This theoretical\nperspective suggests that relationships will be seen as most\nsatisfying when they are perceived as \"balanced.\" Balanced\nrelationships are those in which an individual feels that\ncontributions to, and receptions from, a particular relation-\nship are about equal (Lerner, 1975; Walster, Walster, &\nBerscheid, 1978). Similar to social exchange theory, this\nperspective suggests that individuals will be dissatisfied\nwith relationships in which an individual receives less than\nhe or she contributes. In direct contrast to social exchange\ntheory, however, relationships in which an individual would\nfeel he or she has \"overbenefitted\" would also be seen as\nunsatisfactory. Although it may not be clear why individu-\nals would feel dissatisfied in relationships where they were\noverbenefitted (Feeney, Peterson, & Noller, 1994), one pos-\nsibility is that having intergenerational relationships that are\n\"unbalanced\" this way may be seen as a threat to one's in-\ninability to reciprocate assistance may undermine mental\nhealth and/or well-being.\nThere is some evidence that exchange relationships func-\ntion along lines that are consistent with this theory. Roberto\nand Scott (1986) examined the relationship between equity\nin specific older adult friendships and perceived distress\nwithin the relationship. They found that inequitable rela-\ntionships were associated with greater distress across both\naffective and helping components of the friendship. Rook\n(1987) found in her sample of older widowed women that\nthose who reported balanced exchanges with their adult\nchildren and their friends felt less lonely. Similarly, Mutran\nand Reitzes (1984), in their study of patterns of exchange\nbetween elderly parents and their adult children, found that\ngreater assistance from adult children was related to nega-\ntive affect and poorer health for the married sample. How-\never, they found the opposite for the widowed group; they\nreceived less help when in poor health and had fewer posi-\ntive and more negative feelings. Finally, Stoller (1985) re-\nported that it was the inability to reciprocate, rather than\nsupport received, which predicted lower morale in her sam-\nple of older adults.\nA third theoretical explanation of patterns of intergenera-\ntional support suggests that they are largely motivated by\nneed (Deutsch, 1975). The idea is that parents monitor the\nwell-being of their children (and children monitor the well-\nbeing of their parents) and offer assistance when they per-\nceive that there is a need. We term support given in re-\nsponse to an identified need or transition \"contingent ex-\nchange,\" indicating that it is neither the exchange nor the\ntransition alone that matters, but rather the moderating ef-\nfect of support given or received. This perspective has been\nthe de facto theory behind a good number of the quantita-\ntive models of assistance rendered across generations (cf.\ntergenerational resource flows is largely (though not exclu-\nsively) built around variables measuring the resources and\nneeds of each generation. This is also a standard theoretical\napproach in economic theories of intergenerational trans-\nfers of time and money (Becker, 1974; Eggebeen & Wil-\nDespite the intuitive and theoretical appeal of this theory,\nthe empirical support is surprisingly mixed. Research using\ncross-sectional survey data often reports patterns that are\nmuch more complex than this theoretical approach would\nsuggest. For example, Hogan et al. (1993) found that\nwhereas individuals who had a preschool-aged child were\nmore likely to be receiving assistance than those without\nchildren, those living in poverty were less likely to be in-\nvolved in exchange relationships than the non-poor. Fur-\nthermore, there was no association between the health of\nthe respondent and the likelihood of receiving help. To be\nsure, a number of other studies show that, by and large,\nfamily members are responsive to the needs of other family\nmembers (cf. Zarit & Eggebeen, 1995). However, it is sur-\nprising that a large proportion of individuals in need fail to\nreceive help from their relatives (Hogan & Eggebeen, 1995;\nThis underscores the pressing need for research on the\nimpact of exchange to address two considerations. First,\nlongitudinal research is necessary to disentangle the effects\nof having a particular status from the effects of transitions\ninto and out of that status, because it is the latter which is of\nprimary interest developmentally. Second, and relatedly, it\nis necessary to include predictors both of exchanges and\noutcomes in order to avoid reaching an incorrect conclusion\nabout the importance of exchange for well-being, as Hogan\net al.'s (1993) example clearly illustrates.\nRecent social-cognitive work on expectations for ex-\nchange and norms of reciprocity suggests that social ex-\nchange and equity perspectives may be inadequate to capture\nsupportive exchanges in long-term relationships (Davey,\n1994; Davey & Norris, in press). Both older and younger\nadults appear to indicate that contingent exchange best\ncharacterizes their close relationships with specific others,\nwhereas social exchange is seen as most appropriate in\nmore distant relationships. It is interesting to note that older\nadults appear to make these distinctions more strongly in\nvery close relationships than do younger adults.\nIn summary, empirical investigations of why individuals\ngive have failed to provide consistent support for any of\nthese theories. More significantly, evidence for the linkage\nbetween a particular pattern of exchange and the well-being\nof the individuals involved is mostly lacking. The purpose\nof this article is to address these shortcomings by examin-\ning the relationship between each of these three approaches\nand the mental health and well-being of a representative na-\ntional sample of older adults, using longitudinal data.\nThis study, then, was designed to address two broad re-\nsearch questions. First, do routine intergenerational ex-\nchanges have psychological consequences for older adults?\nThe gerontological literature is equivocal on the question of\nwhether or not support given or received, per se, has psy-\nchological consequences for older adults. To address this\nquestion, we attempt to rectify several potential competing\nexplanations that plague the majority of previous research\nin this area. It is possible, for example, that variables such\nas health status may predict both exchange and mental\nhealth outcomes, making it appear as though those who re-\nceive the most assistance fare the poorest. Another issue\nthat we strive to address in this first question is whether\nsupport can be considered as cause or consequence of a\nparticular mental health outcome (cf. Johnson, 1991). In\nboth cases, only a longitudinal perspective which attempts\nto incorporate the range of variables associated with both\nexchange and mental health variables can hope to disentan-\ngle these complex relationships.\nSecond, is there a theoretically derived pattern of routine\nintergenerational assistance which is most strongly associ-\nated with mental health outcomes for older adults? In this\nsection, we frame hypotheses derived from each of social\nexchange theory, equity theory, and the contingent ex-\nchange perspective. Social exchange theory predicts that\nolder adults who receive more than they give to adult chil-\ndren will have more positive mental health outcomes, such\nas lower levels of depressive symptoms and greater life sat-\nisfaction. This is analogous to proposing that overbenefit-\nting has positive consequences, whereas underbenefitting is\ndeleterious. Equity theory predicts that older adults who\nreceive amounts of assistance roughly equivalent to the\nsupport they give to an adult child will fare better than\nthose who are in imbalanced exchanges, where they experi-\nence either overbenefit or underbenefit. The contingent ex-\nchange perspective predicts that older adults who experi-\nence a need will benefit from receiving assistance from\ntheir adult child, and will suffer from providing assistance\nto their adult child under the same circumstances. Similarly,\nproviding support to a child who has experienced a need\nwill be beneficial whereas receiving support from the same\nchild will be deleterious.\nThe focus of the current study differs in many respects\nfrom much other work in this area and, as a result, we hope\nwill provide a more rigorous test of the psychological con-\nsequences for older adults of intergenerational exchanges.\nSpecifically, we examine both levels and patterns of routine\nintergenerational assistance between older parents and a\nspecific, randomly selected adult child. Because most par-\nents have more than one child, this study is thus likely to\nunderestimate the total psychological consequences of in-\ntergenerational exchanges for older adults. To disentangle\nthe effects of prior levels of exchange and psychological\noutcomes, we rely on longitudinal data in our analyses. Fi-\nnally, our models include a large number of variables that\nhave been identified in the literature as correlates of inter-\ngenerational exchanges, mental health outcomes, or both\nAs such, they serve as potential competing explanations for\nan observed relationship between intergenerational ex-\nchanges and older adults' psychological well-being, and\ntheir effects should be controlled.\nMETHOD\nData\nand Households (NSFH), a national sample survey covering\na wide variety of issues on American family life. It involved\ninitial interviews with 13,008 respondents, oversampling\nsingle-parent families, stepfamilies, recently married cou-\nples, and cohabiting couples. The second wave of this survey,\nSample\nwho completed both study interviews and had at least one\nchild, aged 19 or older at the time of the initial interview.\nAfrican Americans comprised 8.5% of the current sample,\nand 5.3% were Hispanic. Mean reported total household in-\nyears (SD = 3.6). Children of the respondents were equally\ndivided between males and females (50% female) with a\naverage educational level of 13.7 years (SD = 3.0).\nAttrition Across Waves\nThose present at both waves of data collection differed in\nseveral ways from those who completed only the original in-\nterview. Specifically, they were more likely to be younger,\nby approximately 5.6 years and, as a result, more likely to\nhave a coresident child at the initial time of interview. They\nalso had an average of an extra year of formal education, re-\nported slightly better self-rated health, and had higher fam-\nily incomes.\nMeasures\nOutcomes.--Three primary outcome variables were con-\nsidered in the current study. Depressive symptoms were\nmeasured using a 12-item version of the CES-D scale (five\nitems from the Depressed Affect scale and seven from the\nSomatic scale; Radloff, 1977), with scaling modified such\nthat participants reported the number of days in the previ-\nous week during which they had experienced each of the\nsymptoms. For the current sample and scaling, internal con-\nsistency was very high (a = .92 at both waves). Another 3-\nitem scale measured the extent to which participants re-\nported experiencing long-term depressive symptomatology\n(i.e., lasting 2 weeks or more) in the previous 6 months.\nCronbach's alpha of .69 for this scale indicates acceptable\ninternal consistency, given the brevity of the scale, and its\ndichotomous indicators. The final outcome of interest was a\nsingle-item global life satisfaction variable from the Insti-\ntute for Social Research at the University of Michigan.\nBackground characteristics.--To control for competing\nexplanations of a relationship between exchange and well-\nbeing, a large number of background characteristics of par-\nents and offspring were included in the current analyses.\nParent characteristics controlled for included age in years,\nsex (0 = male, 1 = female), race (dummy coded as African\nAmerican, and as Hispanic, with non-Hispanic White as the\nreference category), geographic region (dummy coded as\nNorth Central, South, and as West, with North East as the\nreference category), urban/rural location (dummy coded as\nRural but adjacent to urban, and as Rural and not-adjacent\nto urban, with Urban as the reference category), educational\nattainment (measured in years of formal education), log of\ntotal household dollar income, and poverty status (coded 1\nif household income was below one-half of the median in-\ncome for the year of interview, and 0 otherwise). Relevant\nchild characteristics included gender (0 = male, 1 = fe-\nmale), educational attainment (measured in years of formal\neducation), and number of children (respondent's grand-\nchildren). Several relationship characteristics were also\ncontrolled, including log of distance in miles between par-\nent and child, perceived relationship quality (\"How would\nyou describe your relationship with X\"; from 1 = very poor\nto 7 = excellent), and number of respondent's adult chil-\ndren. We used the log of distance as a predictor in our mod-\nels to reduce skewness and kurtosis of this variable. Un-\ntions were effective.\nParent transitions.--Five potential transitions in the lives\nof older parents were examined. Each was coded as 1 if it\nhad occurred and 0 otherwise. These included loss of\nspouse, due to divorce or widowhood; change in health sta-\ntus; significant (defined as 20% or more) decline in income;\nand transition from working to not working, due to retire-\nment or unemployment. Inclusion of self-rated health status\n(\"Compared with other people your age, how would you\ndescribe your health\"; from 1 = very poor to 5 = excellent)\nand functional limitations on the Activities of Daily Living\n(ADLs; coded as the sum of limitations with caring for per-\nsonal needs such as bathing, dressing, eating or going to the\nbathroom; moving about inside the house; day-to-day\nhousehold tasks; climbing a flight of stairs; walking six\nblocks; doing heavy work like shoveling snow or heavy\nhousecleaning; and working for pay, such as the amount or\ntype of work done) at both times of measurement led to\nmulticollinearity problems with the regression models, and\nso composite (factor) scores were created through principal\ncomponents analysis, with higher scores indicating better\nhealth. In each case, a transition reflects a change in status\nwhich occurred between the first and second interviews.\nChild transitions.--Three child transitions were of inter-\nest. These included birth of a grandchild, loss of a spouse\ndue to divorce or widowhood, or becoming coresident with\nthe parent. Again, transitions reflected changes that had oc-\ncurred between the two interviews.\nIntergenerational exchanges.--Table 1 lists the exchange\nitems asked at each time of measurement in the NSFH.\nSupport given to adult children at each interview was mea-\nsured as the proportion of items which a parent had given to\nhis or her child in the preceding month. Support received\nfrom adult children at each interview was measured as the\nproportion of items which a parent had received from his or\nher child in the preceding month. From these four items,\nsocial exchange was calculated as overbenefit, or (support\nreceived - support given). This measure was high when\nparents were overbenefitted, and low when parents were\nunderbenefitted. Equity was measured as \"imbalance,\" or\n(support received - support given)2 (cf. McCulloch, 1990;\nWalster et al., 1973). This measure was high when parents\nwere either overbenefitted or underbenefitted, and low\nwhen parents were neither overbenefitted nor underbene-\nfitted. This measure is equivalent to the equation presented\nby Walster et al. (1973), in the absence of both partners'\nperceptions.\nAn important limitation of the present study is that differ-\nent and incompletely overlapping exchange items were\nasked at each time of measurement. Financial assistance is\nincluded in the initial interview, for example, but not at the\nsecond interview. Likewise, three exchange items at the ini-\ntial interview address issues of emotional support, whereas\nthis is captured by only a single item in the follow-up inter-\nview. Fortunately, however, the same content areas were\ncovered for giving and receiving assistance within each\nTable 1.

As a result, comparisons between mea-\nsures of giving and receiving are valid within each time\nof interview, but not across time. For this reason, we in-\nclude measures of support given and received at the time\nof initial interview in our models to control for past levels\nof support exchanged. As a result, we are modeling de-\nviations above and below the level of exchange predicted\nby prior levels, rather than the change in specific types\nof support exchanged. Clearly, this situation is far from\nideal for studying developmental phenomena, but still pro-\nvides an important perspective on intergenerational ex-\nchanges over time, specifically that of current status, con-\ntrolling for prior levels.\nRESULTS\nWe were primarily interested in examining the effects of\nintergenerational exchanges on individual outcomes net of\nwhat could be explained by respondent background charac-\nteristics, and factors which might be responsible for ex-\nchange itself. For this reason, we adopted a 3-step hierar-\nchical approach. In the first model, the outcome was\npredicted from its value at the initial interview to control\nfor the stability in the score. In the second model, all con-\ntrol variables, transitions, and main effects of exchange\ngiven and received were entered into the model to deter-\nmine whether they added significantly to prediction of the\nTime 2 outcomes. In the final step, variables representing\nthe pattern of exchange were entered into the equation to\ndetermine whether or not the pattern of exchange added to\nthe prediction net of the main effects in the model. To avoid\nproblems with multicollinearity in tests of the contingent\nexchange perspective, separate analyses were performed for\nparent transitions and child transitions.\nBaseline Model\nThe baseline models for each outcome, including respon-\ndent background characteristics, and variables to control for\nlevels of exchange, are shown in Table 2.\nDepressive symptoms.--Parent characteristics related to\ngreater depressive symptoms included being more de-\npressed at the initial interview, being younger, and having\nlower income. Being Hispanic was associated with lower\ndepression. Parental transition variables related to greater\ndepression were losing a spouse since the initial interview,\nand experiencing a decline in health status. Two relation-\nship characteristics predicted lower depression: having a\nbetter relationship with one's adult child, and receiving less\nsupport from the child at Time 2, net of Time 1 levels of\ngiving and receiving. No child characteristics or transitions\nwere associated with parental depression.\nLong-term depression.--Longer term depression was as-\nsociated with being younger, being female, losing a spouse,\nand having a decline in health status. No relationship or\nchild characteristics made unique contributions to long-\nterm depression. However, the birth of a grandchild was as-\nsociated with significantly less long-term depression.\nLife satisfaction.--Other than previous level of life satis-\nfaction, only a single parent characteristic was predictive of\nlife satisfaction. Specifically, those living in the western\nstates reported lower life satisfaction. Losing a spouse and\npoorer health status both predicted lower life satisfaction.\nQuality of relationship with the adult child was predictive\nof greater life satisfaction. As with depressive symptoms,\nno characteristics of the child or child transitions predicted\nparental life satisfaction.\nSocial Exchange\nSocial exchange theory predicts that the extent to which\nan individual receives in excess of what they give will be\nassociated with more positive outcomes. To test this, we\nadded extent of overbenefit to the baseline model. As seen\nin Table 3, extent of overbenefit did add significantly to the\nprediction of both depressive symptoms and long-term de-\npression. However, the results are in direct contrast to the\npredictions of social exchange theory. The extent to which\nparents receive in excess of what they give to their child is\nassociated with greater depressive symptoms and more\nlong-term depression. Thus, while overbenefitting does pre-\ndict levels of depression, it acts in the opposite direction to\nwhat theory would predict, once factors accounting for the\nexchange itself are controlled.\nEquity Theory\nEquity theory suggests that any imbalance in a relation-\nship, either over or underbenefit, will be associated with\ngreater distress in the form of greater depression and\nlower life satisfaction. We tested this theory in two ways.\nFirst, we added imbalance to the baseline equation to de-\ntermine whether the prediction of depression and life sat-\nisfaction was significantly improved. This is analogous to\nincluding an interaction term in the model without includ-\ning the main effects. Second, we added overbenefit and\nimbalance (overbenefit2) to the model together to deter-\nmine whether underbenefitting was also stressful, treating\noverbenefit and imbalance as linear and quadratic terms,\nrespectively (cf. McCulloch, 1990). The rationale behind\nthis approach is to localize the effect of imbalance. If it is\nonly underbenefitting (or overbenefitting) which predicts\nsubsequent mental health outcomes, then only the linear\ntrend will be significant. If both underbenefitting and\noverbenefitting are important, then the quadratic trend will\nbe significant.\nAlone, greater imbalance in the parent-child relationship\nwas associated with more depressive symptoms as equity\ntheory would predict but not long-term depression or life\nsatisfaction. When imbalance was added to overbenefit, it\nmade no unique contribution to the prediction. Thus, we\nfound support only for equity theory's prediction of negative\nconsequences of overbenefitting, not for underbenefitting.\nContingent Exchange\nAs noted above, separate hierarchical regression models\nwere tested to examine the effects of contingent exchanges\naround parent and adult child transitions. Results for the\nparent moderator variables appear in Table 4. Results from\nanalyses of child moderator variables are shown in Table 5.\nTable 2.

As can be seen in Table 4, there were two sig-\nnificant interaction terms. Individuals who experienced a\ndecline in health status and received greater amounts of\nsupport from an adult child than would be predicted from\nprior levels also experienced fewer depressive symptoms.\nLikewise, those who experienced a significant decline in in-\ncome and also received a greater amount of support than\npredicted from prior levels experienced fewer depressive\nsymptoms. Thus, contingent receipt of assistance appears to\nmoderate the negative effects of declining health/functional\nstatus, and a substantial decline in income.\nChild moderator variables were also important for older\nadults' depressive symptoms. Parents who experienced the\nbirth of a grandchild and received more support than would\nbe predicted based on previous levels also reported lower\nlevels of depression (see Table 5).\nTable 3.

CES-D = Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.\nLong-term depression.--The addition of parent contin-\ngent exchange moderator variables also added significantly\nto the prediction of long-term depression, yielding three\nsignificant interaction terms. Parents who experienced their\nown spousal loss or the transition out of employment, and\nwho gave more to their adult children than would be pre-\ndicted by prior levels of support reported higher levels of\nlong-term depression. Thus, this noncontingent giving may\nhave negative consequences for older parents. As with de-\npressive symptoms, those who received a greater than pre-\ndicted amount of support in the face of declining health had\nlower levels of long-term depression. Addition of child\nmoderator variables did not add significantly to the predic-\ntion of long-term depression.\nLife satisfaction.--Addition of moderator variables for\nparental transitions did not add significantly to the predic-\ntion of parental life satisfaction. However, two child moder-\nVariables CES-D\nLong-Term\nDepression\nLife\nSatisfaction\nMain Effects\nInteractions\nNote.

Older adults had greater life satisfaction around the\nbirth of a grandchild both when they reported giving less to\ntheir adult child than would be predicted on the basis of\nprevious support, and when they reported receiving more\nfrom the adult child than would be predicted on the basis of\nprevious support. Thus, we again have evidence that contin-\ngent exchange has positive consequences, whereas non-\ncontingent exchange (i.e., greater than average levels of\ngiving) has negative consequences.\nDISCUSSION\nThe goal of this study was to examine the relationship\nbetween specific patterns of intergenerational exchanges\nand older adults' psychological well-being. In several re-\nspects, this study is unique. First, we make use of longitudi-\nnal data. This is an important consideration because, if sup-\nport is given in response to an event in the lives of parents,\nthen those with the greatest need (and poorest outcome)\nmay be receiving the greatest amount of support. This will\nartificially induce a negative correlation between support\nreceived and mental health, making it appear as though re-\nceipt of support is associated with poorer mental health.\nSecond, we focus on a single parent-child dyad within\neach family, selected at random. This permits us to examine\naspects of a specific relationship over time. Again, this is an\nimportant consideration because each of the three theoreti-\ncal perspectives we test makes a statement about how indi-\nvidual relationships function over time. Aggregating across\na group of relationships, such as all parent-child dyads, can\nserve to mask the process that is going on in any single re-\nlationship, and downplay the variability which can be seen\nwithin any particular family.\nFinally, our study controls for many other variables\nwhich may affect both exchange and outcomes. The im-\nportance of controlling for competing explanations for\nobserved relationships between exchange and outcomes\ncannot be underestimated if we are to understand the con-\ntribution of exchange to older adults' mental health. Failing\nhealth, declining income, loss of spouse, gender, education,\nand a variety of other factors, have all been shown to pre-\ndict both exchange and mental health. To study the role of\nsupportive exchange for mental health, it is important that\nas many as possible of these extraneous influences be con-\ntrolled. Use of a large, nationally representative data source\npermitted us to do this to a greater extent than has generally\nbeen possible in the past.\nOur results provide negative support for social exchange\ntheory. Contrary to predictions, the extent of overbenefit,\ngiven prior patterns of support given and received, was as-\nsociated with higher levels of depression, both short- and\nlong-term. This is consistent with the finding in the baseline\nmodel that receipt of assistance at Time 2, net of expecta-\ntions based on Time 1 levels of receiving, is also associated\nwith greater depressive symptoms. It would appear from\nthese data that there is more to satisfactory social relation-\nships than whether one is \"getting\" more than \"giving.\"\nIt appears as though parents who are overbenefitted tend\nto suffer psychologically. Apparently, it is not simply the\nstate of dependency itself which is responsible for these\nfindings, because major causes of this are controlled in our\nmodels. That is, the higher levels of depression observed\ncannot be attributed to greater assistance received around\ndeclining health, as both assistance and health appear in the\nmodel. In addition, because we control for past levels of\nsupport given and received, these findings suggest that it is\npeople who are overbenefitted to a greater extent than\nwould be predicted from prior levels of exchange who ex-\nperience negative psychological consequences. Thus, these\nfindings cannot be attributed either to high or low levels of\nexchange alone, but rather the extent of overbenefitting.\nFrom a psychological vantage point, these findings are\nintriguing. Within the gerontological literature, it is often\nassumed that support given by parents to children earlier in\nlife will be reciprocated later in life, creating an equitable\nsituation when considered across the entire adult life span\n(e.g., Antonucci & Akiyama, 1987). Gerontological litera-\nture generally supports this idea, indicating that parents\ntend to provide more support to children than they receive\nuntil very late in life (Morgan, Schuster, & Butler, 1991).\nTo the extent that this is true, these findings suggest this\nmay have developmental implications for older adults'\nmental health. That is, even having this support bank to\ndraw from may not always be sufficient to protect older\nadults from potentially negative consequences of being\noverbenefitted. This issue is taken up in greater detail, how-\never, when the contingent exchange perspective is dis-\ncussed below.\nEquity theory suggests that individuals who are either\noverbenefitted or underbenefitted will experience poorer\nmental health outcomes than those whose relationships\nroughly balance support given with support received. Our\ntest of this model indicates that underbenefitting is not as-\nsociated with any deleterious mental health consequences,\nbut overbenefitting is.\nIn contrast to previous work on the equity perspective,\nwhich sought to explain why being overbenefitted would\nhave negative implications, this study suggests that the lack\nof importance for being underbenefitted may be what begs\nexplanation. This finding appears to reinforce the psycho-\nlogical importance of being able to reciprocate within a\nspecific parent-child relationship (Roberto & Scott, 1986;\nthe importance of considering both support given and sup-\nport received. Whereas Silverstein, Chen, and Heller (1996)\nfound that receiving support at levels that were very high or\nvery low was associated with negative mental health out-\ncomes, the current findings extend this idea to suggest that\nnegative consequences are possible whenever the levels of\nsupport received exceed levels of support given. Because\nwe know that the situation of being underbenefitted is more\nlikely to arise in later life, these findings also suggest im-\nportant developmental consequences for intergenerational\nexchanges. For example, although individuals are more\nlikely to be underbenefitted in relationships with their chil-\ndren across most of adulthood, the reverse is true in very\nlate life. This might lead us to conclude that, with age,\nolder adults can expect to experience negative outcome as a\nresult of both declining health and the assistance they re-\nceive from their children. Again, consideration of the con-\ntingent exchange perspective below may help to reconcile\nthese findings.\nOne reviewer suggested that these findings might be at-\ntributable to differential effects of overbenefit in emotional\nversus tangible domains. Specifically, it was suggested that\nit may be good to be overbenefitted with regard to emo-\ntional support, but harmful to be overbenefitted in instru-\nmental domains. To the extent that instrumental support\nitems dominate our measure of overbenefitting, this is in-\ndeed a plausible interpretation that should be examined in\ngreater detail in future research.\nExamination of contingent patterns of exchange begins\nto shed some light on the circumstances under which it is\nimportant to give and receive support in parent-child rela-\ntionships. First and foremost, our results suggest that ex-\nchange has important consequences when it occurs around\nspecific changes in the lives of both older parents and their\nadult children. In the current study, we found evidence for\nthe importance of exchanges around widowhood, decline in\nhealth, significant drop in income, transition out of employ-\nment, and the birth of a grandchild.\nThere are at least three reasons why addition of the con-\ntingent exchange moderators only modestly improved pre-\ndiction of parental outcomes. To begin with, interaction ef-\nfects are notoriously difficult to find in non-experimental\ncontexts. Interactions and main effects are usually corre-\nlated, which reduces the unique (i.e., uncorrelated) contri-\nbution of any single interaction term. Additionally, unrelia-\nbility of measurement is compounded with the construction\nof multiplicative composites, which sets an upper limit on\nthe extent to which interactions can add to a model. A sec-\nond important consideration is that, in terms of explained\nvariance, addition of the moderating effects accounts for\nbetween 1.5% and 5% of the reliable variance in the mod-\nels, suggesting that their unique relative contribution is ac-\ntually quite reasonable. The last consideration we wish to\nraise is that these effects necessarily under-represent the in-\nfluence of intergenerational exchanges, as they only incor-\nporate information from a single parent-child relationship.\nWe are currently developing models which will provide\nvalid estimates of these phenomena using information from\nrelationships with all adult children. We thus expect that the\nnet importance of contingent exchange is likely to be con-\nsiderably higher than we can observe with the design of the\ncurrent study.\nWe find evidence that support given and received around\neach of the parental transitions and birth of a grandchild\nhave important moderating influences on the effects of the\ntransitions themselves. The interpretation of these findings\nis consistent for each of the significant interactions. Specifi-\ncally, receiving a greater amount of support around a de-\ncline in health, substantial drop in income, or the birth of a\ngrandchild, than would be predicted on the basis of prior\nlevels of exchange, is associated with more positive and\nless negative mental health outcomes over a 5-year period.\nThat is, we find strong evidence for the importance of re-\nceiving contingent support from adult children..\nRelatedly, the noncontingent provision of support to an\nadult child (i.e., greater than expected amounts of support\nwith the loss of a spouse or birth of a grandchild) appears to\nhave deleterious consequences for older adults. Normative\namounts of support given and received are to be expected\naround any transition in the lives of parents and their chil-\ndren. Parents experiencing a transition who receive more\nthan these amounts fare better; those who receive less fare\nmore poorly. Parents who provide greater than average lev-\nels of support to adult children around specific transitions\nmay fare more poorly than those who provide less support\nunder the same circumstances.\nThese findings suggest that individuals who find them-\nselves in unusually supportive relationships fare well,\nwhereas those who have exceptional demands placed on\nthem by their social relationships in times of need may fare\npoorly; certainly more poorly than those who do not experi-\nence such demands.\nFindings from the contingent exchange perspective can\nhelp us to make sense of the results from the social ex-\nchange and equity perspectives. It is not giving or receiving\nin and of themselves that affect mental health, but rather the\ncontext in which they are given or received. If support oc-\ncurs in a fashion that is consistent with the circumstances, it\nis likely to exert a positive influence on older adults' mental\nhealth and well-being. If support, at least support provided\nby older parents, is inconsistent with circumstances, it can\nbe expected to have negative consequences. Thus, over-\nbenefitting is not detrimental when it occurs for a specific\nreason (such as the loss of a spouse, or around declining\nhealth), and underbenefitting can have negative conse-\nquences when it occurs at an inappropriate time.\nIt seems somewhat surprising that we did not find more\nevidence for the psychological importance of contingent\ngiving of support. In part, this may be the result of a rela-\ntively insensitive measure of well-being, where we would\nbe most likely to see such an effect. Additionally, we have a\nrelatively limited amount of information about transitions\nin the lives of adult children, and so may not be tapping the\nright circumstances under which giving support matters.\nWe have identified a set of circumstances under which\ncontingent receipt of support has beneficial consequences.\nTo what extent does this actually play out in parent child re-\nlationships? We find encouraging evidence on two fronts.\nFirst, individuals tend to report that they anticipate receiv-\ning support in a fashion consistent with the contingent ex-\nchange perspective (Davey & Norris, in press). This is true\nof very close relationships generally, and there is also evi-\ndence that older adults may hold these expectations to a\ngreater degree than do younger adults. Second, we find lon-\ngitudinal evidence that children do actually \"step to the\nfore\" when parents experience a need, and that this is likely\nto be true regardless of parents' anticipated support from\nadult children as opposed to other sources (Eggebeen &\nDavey, 1997). This is good news because it suggests that\nparents are highly likely to receive support in a fashion that\nmay actually help to protect them from the negative conse-\nquences of dependency.\nFuture research will need to explore ways of incorporat-\ning information about all parent-child relationships in a\nfashion that does not lose sight of the fact that exchange is a\nproperty of a relationship. In this way, it will be possible to\nestimate the total effects of intergenerational support for\nmental health and well-being. We will also need to explore a\nwider range of domains of intergenerational assistance and\nidentify the circumstances under which one type of support\ncan substitute for another. Ideally, future research will also\nincorporate information from multiple family members, as\nsuch data become more widely available to researchers.\nThere seems to be little doubt that the important connec-\ntions between older parents and their adult children serve\nimportant developmental functions for both generations.\nOne of the most consistent findings of the recent burst of\nscholarly attention being given to intergenerational rela-\ntions is that family members remain vitally involved with\neach other as they age. However, it is also evident from this\nresearch that the nature of this involvement is more compli-\ncated than many of our theories suggest. This is clearly evi-\ndent in this article. We find good evidence that patterns of\nexchange have important implications for the psychological\nhealth of aging parents. Nevertheless, many questions re-\nmain. Our data constrain us to a 5-year window, yet it is en-\ntirely plausible that parents and children conduct their ex-\nchanges with a much longer \"time horizon\" in mind, which\nmay have different consequences than are evident in the\nshort run. Future work should also investigate the implica-\ntions of gender differences. That is, do men and women\nuse, think about, and react to exchange patterns differently?\nIt is also entirely conceivable that individuals employ\n\"mixed\" exchange strategies, depending on what is being\ngiven or received. That is, parents and children may be\nmore likely to engage an \"exchange\" strategy when money\nis the commodity being passed between generations,\nwhereas contingent giving may be more likely employed\nwhen there are family emergencies. Finally, patterns of ex-\nchange, and their consequences, may be partially contin-\ngent on the life courses of both parents and children. Future\nwork investigating the consequences of social exchanges\nfor the well-being of individuals would do well to address\nthese questions.\n"
