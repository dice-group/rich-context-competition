During that meeting, the stu-\ndent remarked that he could not see how one could learn the\nlanguage of another group if she or he does not like that\ngroup. At this point, the advisor said, \"Hey man. There's\nyour thesis!\" The student was Robert Gardner with his super-\nvisor Wallace Lambert at McGill University in 1956. That\nmeeting gave birth to the field of second language (L2) moti-\nvation and was the primary instigator of decades of research\nThe purpose of this article is to offer a historical background\nof research into language motivation and then highlight a num-\nber of emerging themes that seem to hold potential for future\nresearch. This analysis builds on and expands previous efforts\nto understand the historical trajectory of the field (e.g., Boo,\nhave identified three phases that the field has gone through.\nThe first is the social-psychological period, in which a common\ntheme was the focus on the macroperspective language learn-\ning. That research was largely concerned with affective factors\nin intergroup relations. The field then progressed into a second\nphase, in which the scope of research was expanded to address\nlearners in the microcontext of the classroom and the cognitive\nprocesses underlying language learning. The current, third\nphase is witnessing the emergence of various themes, such as\nthe dynamic, affective, unconscious, and long-term aspects of\nmotivation to learn English and other languages.\nPrevious surveys of the field may be characterized as\nback pointing, in which they have primarily focused on\ntrends found in the past two phases without elaborating on\nthe emerging trends in the current period. The present analy-\nsis therefore offers a more forward-pointing survey of these\nemerging trends. As reviewed below, some of these themes\nhave been discussed separately in the literature, but they\nhave not been synthesized and presented in one place to date.\nIn addition, one of these themes, technology, has been largely\noverlooked in the motivation field despite the increasing\ntechnologization of learning and classroom instruction in\nmany parts of the world. Before surveying these themes, the\ndiscussion starts with a brief overview of the first two phases.\nThe Social-Psychological Period\nThe social-psychological period was spearheaded by Gardner\n2010). The fundamental basis of this research is the assump-\ntion that learning an L2 is different from other school subjects\nbecause L2 learning additionally requires openness to the L2\ngroup and willingness to adopt features from it. This concept\ncame to be known as integrative motivation. A number of\n1The University of Nottingham, UK\n2Jubail Industrial College, Saudi Arabia\nCorresponding Author:\nAli H.

Building on\nwork by these researchers, Gardner undertook a more focused\ninvestigation into the role of affective factors.\nGardner (2010) classifies the history of his own research\nprogram into three phases. He calls the first phase ancient\nabove early researchers as well as Gardner's MA and PhD\nwork and later research included in Gardner and Lambert\nand the early 1980s. During this period, Gardner and P. C.\nSmythe obtained funding to establish the Language Research\nGroup at the University of West Ontario and conducted stud-\nies across Canada. Gardner calls the last phase of his research\nmodern history, which describes work conducted in the\n1980s. This is when Gardner and his graduate students con-\ntinued research after the Language Research Group was dis-\nbanded. (As explained in more detail below, the 1990s\nmarked the beginning of the cognitive\u00adsituated period.)\nDuring these three phases, Gardner and associates\nengaged in a very productive research program, which led to\nthe development of the socioeducational model (for a review,\nsee Gardner, 2010). This model postulates four different\naspects of the learning process: social milieu (cultural and\neducational backgrounds), individual differences (IDs; intel-\nligence, aptitude, motivation, and anxiety), acquisition con-\ntexts (formal vs. informal), and outcomes (linguistic vs.\nnonlinguistic). Most empirical research focused on the inte-\ngrative motive, according to which language achievement is\ninfluenced positively by motivation and aptitude, and nega-\ntively by language anxiety. Motivation, in turn, is a function\nof integrativeness, attitudes toward the learning situation,\nand instrumentality. Gardner (2007) also identifies four\nstages of L2 development: elemental, consolidation, con-\nscious expression, and automaticity and thought. From this\nperspective, \"acquisition involves making the language part\nAlthough Gardner's framework was arguably the domi-\nnant paradigm in the social-psychological period, there were\nalso other frameworks active at the time. These include\nCl\u00e9ment's (1980) social context model, Giles and Byrne's\ntion model. However, as D\u00f6rnyei and Ryan (2015) observe,\nthe common theme shared by all these approaches is their\nmacro-level analysis of the interrelationship between social\ngroups and contextual variables. Interest in more classroom-\noriented research had to wait until the second period.\nThe Cognitive\u00adSituated Period\nFor decades, Gardner and associates have repeatedly insisted\nthat the socioeducational model is dynamic rather than static\nvariables together but describes a process\" (Gardner, 2010,\np. 59). Nevertheless, Gardner has also acknowledged that\nIt is not intended to provide explanations to individual teachers\nas to why or why not some of their students are more or less\nsuccessful than others, or to give teachers advice on how to\nmotivate their students, or to provide reasons to students to help\nthem understand their own success or lack thereof. It is a model\nto account for general relationships in a parsimonious and\ntestable structure that is subject to verification and replication.\nIn addition to not being classroom-friendly, Gardner's model\nwas criticized from other perspectives. For example, D\u00f6rnyei\n(i.e., effort) with the abstract mental phenomenon of motiva-\ntion will lead to conceptual ambiguity (see also MacIntyre,\n2002, p. 49). In addition, with the spread of World English as\na decentralized global language, the idea of integrating with\nnative speakers from Anglophone countries started to became\nless and less meaningful (e.g., Coetzee-Van Rooy, 2006;\nMcClelland, 2000). Some integrative and instrumental orien-\ntations have also become hardly distinguishable (Lamb, 2004).\nStarting from the 1990s, these accumulating issues led lan-\nguage motivation research to shift into a new phase, which\nwas described as the cognitive\u00adsituated period (D\u00f6rnyei &\nintegrativeness was conceived of as an affective factor,\nD\u00f6rnyei (2010) tries to uncover its cognitive underpinnings\nthrough reinterpreting it into the ideal L2 self. The attempt to\nreinterpret integrativeness in cognitive light gave birth to the\n2009a). The L2 MSS consists of the ideal L2 self, the ought-\nto L2 self, and the L2 learning experience, thus preserving the\noriginal tripartite conceptualization of the integrative motive.\nThe L2 MSS is based on two \"parent\" theories, self-discrep-\nancy theory (Higgins, 1987), and possible selves theory\n(Markus & Nurius, 1986). On one hand, learners experience\nuneasiness if their perceived level of proficiency is discrepant\nfrom the level they aspire to achieve (i.e., actual\u00adideal dis-\ncrepancy) or from the level they think they are expected to\nmeet (i.e., actual\u00adought discrepancy). This psychological\nuneasiness may serve as a motivator to reduce this discrep-\nancy by improving L2 proficiency. On the other hand, pos-\nsessing an elaborate vision of a desired possible self may\nintensify one's motivation because the imagined self becomes\nan experiential reality that the individual can see and hear.\nThe closest parallel to this ideal self-image is the L2 native\nspeaker. Learners, therefore, could draw from their past\nknowledge of L2 speakers to envision for themselves a\ndesired future that would have a motivational effect in the\npresent. According to a survey of language motivation\nresearch spanning about a decade, Boo et al. (2015) observe\nthat the L2 MSS is currently the dominant framework in the\nAl-Hoorie 3\nfield. In another survey spanning about two decades, Sugita\nMcEown, Noels, and Chaffee (2014) also observe that an\nincreasing number of researchers have used Self-\nDetermination Theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985) as their primary\ntheoretical framework or have drawn from some aspects of it.\nIn addition to these two theoretical frameworks, some\nresearchers have continued trying to realign language moti-\nvation with educational psychology and to make use of\nother non-L2-specific theories, such as social cognitive\ntheory (e.g., Mills, Pajares, & Herron, 2007) and attribution\ntheory (e.g., Williams, Burden, Poulet, & Maun, 2004).\nThis type of innovation necessitated also expanding the\nmethodological repertoire, which has led to an increasing\nnumber of qualitative investigations as well as practical\napplications of language motivation research into class-\nrooms (Boo et al., 2015). In fact, because this research has\nbeen so concerned with classroom processes and with mak-\ning motivation research more teacher-friendly--as opposed\nto the focus on larger picture in the social-psychological\nperiod--it might be appropriate to describe this phase as\nthe educational period.\nThe Current Period\nAccording to D\u00f6rnyei and Ryan's (2015) historical analysis,\nthe language motivation field is currently in its third phase.\nD\u00f6rnyei and Ryan characterize this period by the shift to\nsociodynamic perspectives. Indeed, perhaps the most salient\ncharacteristic of this phase is the growing emphasis on the\ndynamic nature of motivation and its temporal variation.\nHowever, a number of other themes are also emerging, and\nso \"we need to take care not to portray researchers . . . as part\nof a coordinated, focused movement, when it was more the\ncase of various diverse concerns emerging at a similar time\"\nthis period a single monolithic title. Such titles usually\nemerge in retrospect, especially when the field is ready to\nmove to a new phase.\nLooking at developments in the field from a broader per-\nspective, some commentators (e.g., Boo et al., 2015; Sugita\nMcEown et al., 2014) have also pointed out some limita-\ntions in previous research. For example, both of the previous\nperiods coincide in characterizing motivation as a conscious\nprocess in which learning English--rather than other lan-\nguages--is examined within a relatively short duration and\nusing rather \"simplistic\" research designs (Boo et al., 2015,\np. 156). The samples investigated also tend to be tertiary\nstudents, while different theoretical frameworks have tested\nparticipants from different age groups and from different\ncultural backgrounds, thus making cross-theoretical com-\nparisons problematic (Sugita McEown et al., 2014). In addi-\ntion, most of this research has overlooked the increasing\ntechnologization of everyday life and its impact on language\nlearning nowadays. These themes are discussed in more\ndetail next.\nDynamic Motivation\nThe observation that, unlike L1 learners, L2 learners vary\nsubstantially in how successful they are in their language\nproficiency prompted research into IDs. Researchers identi-\nfied several ID factors that could potentially account for this\nvariability, such as aptitude, motivation, learning styles,\nlearning strategies, and anxiety (e.g., D\u00f6rnyei, 2005; Skehan,\n1989). This approach can be intuitively summarized as find-\ning out \"why, how long, how hard, how well, how proac-\ntively, and in what way the learner engaged in the learning\nprocess\" (D\u00f6rnyei & Ryan, 2015, p. 6, emphasis in original).\nDespite the intuitive appeal of this approach, recent theoreti-\ncal analysis suggests that it may no longer tenable. In fact,\nbecause this approach rests on a number of problematic\nassumptions, D\u00f6rnyei (2009b) describes it as the \"individual\ndifferences myth.\"\nOne of these problematic assumptions is that these IDs\nare clearly identifiable (D\u00f6rnyei, 2009b). However, close\nexamination of some of the traditional IDs shows that the\nborders between them are fuzzier than first assumed. For\nexample, motivation is traditionally viewed as an affec-\ntive factor and has been contrasted with the cognitive\nnature of aptitude, but, in reality, most influential motiva-\ntional theories draw heavily from cognitive research and\nhave cognitive components. Another example is anxiety,\nwhich is sometimes treated as a motivational component,\nsometimes as a personality trait, and sometimes as an\nemotion (MacIntyre, 2002). Similarly, aptitude involves\nnot only cognitive aspects but also affective and conative\ndimensions (Robinson, 2007). The fuzzy distinction\nbetween the different IDs calls into question their modular\nview.\nAnother problematic assumption is that IDs are relatively\nstable (D\u00f6rnyei, 2009b). However, it is now increasingly rec-\nognized that, far from being stable, IDs are highly sensitive\nto contextual and temporal variation. From context to con-\ntext and from time to time, the different IDs fluctuate, and\nconsequently, their effect on language learning correspond-\ningly fluctuates. A \"motivated\" learner may be less moti-\nvated on the next day, or at the next task. Even fluid\nintelligence and language aptitude are increasingly viewed\nas malleable. Fluid intelligence, which used to be assumed\nfixed and genetically predetermined, interacts with the envi-\nronment, and therefore it is \"dynamic rather than static and\nmodifiable rather than fixed,\" which makes it \"trainable to a\nsignificant and meaningful degree\" (Sternberg, 2008, p.\n6791). Neither is language aptitude independent of context,\nand instead, it is sensitive to task and situation specificity\n(Robinson, 2007). Therefore, the observed association\nbetween a cause and its effect may be substantial at one occa-\nsion but negligible at another (Ellis & Larsen-Freeman,\n2006). \"People do what their immediate situations tell them\nto do rather than what their long-standing internal traits\n4 SAGE Open\nAn alternative to the modular view of IDs is that learner\ncharacteristics are dynamically changing both in response to\ncontext and time, and as a result of their interaction with each\ntems theory may be a viable approach that can do justice to\nthis complex conceptualization. The adoption of a complex-\nity theory perspective in language motivation may be seen as\nofficially inaugurated by the publication of a recent anthol-\nogy edited by D\u00f6rnyei, MacIntyre, and Henry (2015). The\ncontributors to this volume drew from a variety of data-ana-\nlytic techniques to examine the dynamics of motivation such\nas idiodynamics, latent growth modeling, and trajectory\nipate that this new perspective has the potential to keep lan-\nguage motivation researchers busy for the next decade.\nAffect and Emotions\nD\u00f6rnyei's attempt to reinterpret integrativeness in cognitive\nterms was part of a more general trend in the language moti-\nvation field. Starting in the early 1990s, researchers tried to\nadopt cognitive constructs following the then-trendy\napproach in educational psychological research (e.g.,\nD\u00f6rnyei, 1994a). This general shift from affective-based\nmodels to cognitive-based models seems to implicitly reflect\nthe view that affect is a \"post-cognition\" phenomenon, in\nwhich affect is a mere result of cognition (e.g., Muncy,\n1986): Once we understand the cognitive processes involved,\nwe can then deduce the affective outcomes. Although this\nview was dominant after the cognitive revolution, some\nrecent research has cast doubt on it. For example, Pessoa\n(2008) argues that, at the neural level, the view that cognition\nand emotion are separate entities does not hold; in many\ncases, the two contribute jointly to behavior (see also Okon-\nSinger, Hendler, Pessoa, & Shackman, 2015). The situation\nis no different when it comes to language learning. As\nSchumann (1997) explains, \"from a neural perspective, not\nonly are various affective processes interrelated, but affect\nand cognition are also intimately intertwined\" (p. 238).\nAn important class of this affective dimension is emo-\ntions, due to their close connection to identity and adjust-\nment in language learning (e.g., Noels, Pon, & Cl\u00e9ment,\n1996). In fact, it might be argued that emotions are \"true\"\naffects, while the affective-based models in the first period\nmay actually be cognitive to some extent. Despite this, emo-\ntions have not received adequate attention in the second lan-\nguage acquisition (SLA) field in general and in language\nmotivation in particular. D\u00f6rnyei and Ryan (2015) blame this\non the cognitivist roots of SLA, as well as the irregular, fluc-\ntuating nature of emotions. This is why D\u00f6rnyei and Ryan\n(2015) describe emotions as \"the greatest omission\" (p. 9)\namong individual difference variables, leading the field to\nsuffering from an \"emotional deficit\" (p. 10). Emotions were\nalso described as \"fundamentally important motivators\"\nbecause motivation without emotion remains cold cognition\nthat lacks potency. Swain (2013) also considers emotions the\nelephant in the room, maintaining that cognition and emotion\nare at least interdependent and at most integrated and\ninseparable.\nDespite the fact that emotions have long been kept \"in the\nshadows\" of language learning discussions in favor of other\nexperience indicates that ability and attitudes alone are not\nsufficient to support motivation (MacIntyre, 2002).\nClassrooms in general are a cause of emotional turmoil for\nmany people, and the language classroom in particular can\nbe an especially emotionally loaded experience (D\u00f6rnyei &\nthe example of embarrassment. It is hard to imagine a lan-\nguage learner who has not been in an embarrassing situation\nin the language classroom, and depending on the intensity of\nembarrassment, the learner might resort to withdrawal or\nreticence as a form of emotional defense (King, 2011). It\ndoes not help that curriculum designers find it easier to focus\non rigid activities that involve little emotional investment,\nwhich puts further burden on the teacher (Dewaele, 2015).\nTo deal with this situation, Kramsch (2009) recommends that\nteachers try to detect aspects in the syllabus that can be sub-\nject to emotional arousal, such as love or hate, to encourage\nmore learner investment in the lesson.\nAlthough early research into emotions in language learn-\ning was limited to the detrimental effects of negative emo-\ntions, most notably anxiety (e.g., Horwitz, Horwitz, & Cope,\n1986), the recent interest in different emotions has been\ndubbed as the affective turn in SLA (Pavlenko, 2013). For\nexample, Gregersen and MacIntyre (2014) argue that neither\nare negative emotions always bad nor should researchers\noverlook positive emotions. This position has materialized\nmost clearly in the publication of three anthologies in the\nsame year (Gabry-Barker & Galajda, 2016; Gkonou, Tatzl,\nmarking the inception of the positive psychology movement\nin SLA. The contributors to these anthologies discuss vari-\nous topics relating emotions to language learning, including\nempathy, hope and hardiness, enjoyment, flow, eudemonic\nhappiness, and love. Considering the controversial status of\npositive psychology (e.g., Coyne & Tennen, 2010), the next\nfew years would reveal the extent to which this movement is\naccepted in mainstream L2 motivation.\nUnconscious Motivation\nDespite the abundance of perspectives on identity, one idea\nhas stood the test of time: William James's (1890) distinction\nbetween the I-self and the Me-self. Whereas the I-self consti-\ntutes the willful and volitional aspects of motivation, the Me-\nself reflects automatic and unconscious motivators. As\nRoeser and Peck (2009) review, these two systems are\nAl-Hoorie 5\nseparate but functionally interdependent, and both systems\nhave to be accounted for in explanations of motivation. To\ndate, most research on language motivation has, at least\nimplicitly, assumed that the learner is a rational individual\nwho is able to recognize and articulate what motivates him or\nher (Al-Hoorie, 2016a). Recently, however, there has been a\nresurgence in the interest in unconscious motivation in main-\nstream motivational psychology, as an increasing number of\npsychologists are starting to realize the importance of uncon-\nscious motivators (see Al-Hoorie, 2015). For example, in\ntheir review of the emerging themes in mainstream motiva-\ntional psychology, Ryan and Legate (2012) document their\nsurprise that the interface between conscious and uncon-\nscious motivation was the most frequently cited area to hold\npotential for future research. The language motivation field\nhas also reached a level of maturity that allows it to start\nexploring issues related to unconscious motivation and to\ncatch up with other SLA subdisciplines where unconscious\nprocesses have become a stable topic of investigation. To be\nmore specific, \"our field is ready to expand into exploring\nthese areas because it seems evident that language globalisa-\ntion has created a linguistic landscape that is characterised by\nboth powerful positive trends and strong negative undercur-\nAdopting an unconscious angle of human motivation\ndoes not have to be at odds with the current frameworks in\nthe field. For example, neither possible selves theory nor\nself-discrepancy theory, the two parent theories of the L2\nMSS, would disapprove of unconscious processes. In terms\nof possible selves theory, Markus and Nurius (1986) discuss\nthe possibility of the unconscious activation of both positive\nand negative possible selves. In describing the effects of\nunconscious activation of possible selves, Oyserman (2013)\nsimilarly asserts that \"these effects are automatic and do not\nrequire that people make a conscious choice as to how to\n44). In a special issue marking the centennial of the publica-\ntion of James's (1890) The Principles of Psychology, Markus\n(1990) contributes with an article titled \"On Splitting the\nUniverse,\" in which she endorsed James's distinction\nbetween the I-self and the Me-self and stressed its relevance\ntoday.\nSelf-discrepancy theory also accommodates unconscious\nprocesses:\nself-discrepancy theory does not assume that people are aware\nof either the availability or the accessibility of their self-\ndiscrepancies. It is clear that the availability and accessibility of\nstored social constructs can influence social information\nprocessing automatically and without awareness. (Higgins,\nNeither do the behavioral consequences have to be conscious\n(Higgins, 1989, p. 98). In fact, self-discrepancy theory does not\nassume that a future self-guide is a stable individual difference\nvariable (Higgins, 1998), but that situational variability can\nunconsciously induce the motivational effect independently\nfrom the nature of the learner's self-guides. In one study, for\nexample, Higgins, Roney, Crowe, and Hymes (1994) use an\nostensibly unrelated task to activate either the ideal or ought\nselves of their participants. Although the participants were not\naware that their ideal or ought selves were activated, this acti-\nvation was still successful in unconsciously shaping their per-\nformance on a subsequent free recall task. Gardner's integrative\nmotivation also allows some room for such unconscious con-\nceptualizations. In Gardner's (2010) words, integrativeness\nis not a conscious decision on the part of the individual and . . .\nindividuals may not be aware of it . . . The rationale underlying\nintegrative motivation is that emotional factors can influence\nbehavior, sometimes in ways that are not even perceived by the\nAlthough current theoretical frameworks are not, in prin-\nciple, at odds with investigations into unconscious phenom-\nena, researchers in reality have relied predominantly on\nself-report questionnaires and interviews (Ushioda, 2013).\nExpanding language motivation research to include implicit\nprocesses may enrich the field and open up numerous poten-\ntial pathways. As an illustration, motivational psychologists\nhave examined the implicit dimension of many well-known\nconstructs. Examples include implicit attitudes (Petty, Fazio,\n& Bri\u00f1ol, 2009), implicit prejudice and stereotypes (Levinson\n& Smith, 2012), implicit motives (Schultheiss & Brunstein,\n2010), implicit self-concept (Bri\u00f1ol, Petty, & Wheeler,\n2006), implicit self-determination (Keatley, Clarke,\nFerguson, & Hagger, 2014), and implicit self-regulation\n(Koole, McCullough, Kuhl, & Roelofsma, 2010). It clear\nthat language motivation researchers would benefit from\nexploring \"the other side\" of their constructs as well (e.g.,\nLong-Term Motivation\nLanguage motivation does not emerge in a vacuum, but\ndevelops through interaction with various events over one's\nlife history. The life history of each learner plays a major role\nin whether she or he decides to take up learning the language\nand whether she or he sees a reason to persist in it. This\nrequires researchers to look at the bigger picture of the ecol-\nogy of motivation. As an illustration, educational psycholo-\ngist Avi Kaplan describes how a similar notion emerged in\nhis research:\nExploring various methodologies, [Kaplan] conducted a\nnarrative interview study with 10 undergraduate students,\naiming to understand the processes that led them to adopt\ndifferent achievement goal orientations toward their studies in\ncollege. To his surprise, when asked about their experiences,\nchoices, and engagement in college, the students spoke relatively\n6 SAGE Open\nlittle about the characteristics of the learning environment, their\nself-efficacy, or their attributions for success and failure. Instead,\nthey elaborated on growing up in their hometown, their high\nschool experiences, their dilemmas concerning careers and\nrelationships, their family, ethnicity, friends, and the peer groups\nthey belonged to or wanted to belong to. These students\nmentioned schoolwork specifically when the material seemed to\nbe relevant to who they thought they were and who they\nconsidered or wanted to be. [Kaplan] had the insight that, to a\nlarge extent, these students' achievement goals in college were\nbased in their identity and identity formation processes. (Kaplan\nAlthough long-term investigations require longitudinal\ndesigns, longitudinal studies are a minority in the language\nmotivation literature (Sugita McEown et al., 2014). This sta-\ntus quo creates gaps in our knowledge. For example, despite\ntheir popularity in the literature lately, L2 self-guides have\nbeen typically examined cross-sectionally, and so little is\nknown about how they initially develop or their evolutionary\ntrajectories over time. For example, D\u00f6rnyei (2009a) sug-\ngests that L2 self-guides might not be appropriate for presec-\nondary learners (see also Lamb, 2012), but there is \"virtual\ninto the motivation of younger learners.\nAn interesting exception to the lack of research on long-\nterm motivation is the recent development of the notion of\nDirected Motivational Currents (DMCs, D\u00f6rnyei, Henry, &\nMuir, 2016). DMCs may be described as flow-like experi-\nences (cf. Csikszentmihalyi, 1975) that extend over diverse\ntasks unified by an overall goal. In other words, DMCs are\nunique motivational surges that span over longer timescales\nand that are not necessarily enjoyable in themselves--as\npleasure is derived from the end goal that is external to the\nactivity. DMCs therefore occur when there is a clear vision\nof that goal as well as an identifiable factor triggering the\nlaunch of motivation. After their launch, DMCs are then\nmaintained by ongoing behavioral routines and progress\nchecks. Eventually, DMCs decline and motivation goes back\nto its normal levels. In explaining the rationale behind the\nterm Directed Motivational Currents, D\u00f6rnyei et al. (2016)\nexplain that \"Both motivational and ocean currents represent\na formidable flow of energy, carrying the life-forms caught\nup within them unimaginable distances\" (p. xi).\nIn a first empirical study of the concept of DMCs, Henry,\nDavydenko, and D\u00f6rnyei (2015) conduct interviews with lan-\nguage learners who had experienced DMCs. The results\nshowed that DMCs are characterized by a salient facilitative\nstructure, involvement of identity investment goals, and posi-\ntive emotionality. Further investigation into this positive\nemotionality has revealed that participants attribute it to the\nfeeling that their entire identity was being transformed in the\nprocess (Ibrahim, 2016a). Other empirical research showed\nthat DMCs can also be experienced by a group of individual\nworking on a project (Ibrahim, 2016b) and may be intention-\nally induced by teachers (Muir, 2016). These results also\nsuggest that the dynamics of such motivational surges may be\ndifferent from regular, and even high, motivation. To date,\nmost research in this area has been qualitative, and so only\nfuture research would tell how generalizable these findings\nare.\nLanguages Other Than English (LOTEs)\nThe SLA field is concerned with \"the processes by which\nschool-aged children, adolescents, and adults learn and use,\nat any point in life, an additional language, including second,\nforeign, indigenous, minority, or heritage languages\" (The\n(Woll & Adam, 2012). This is one factor why there has been\na growing interest in multilingualism in other SLA disci-\nplines, which has amounted to a multilingual turn (e.g.,\nsions, there have been calls to go beyond multilingualism.\nFor example, some authors have drawn from Mikhail\nBakhtin's notion of heteroglossia to refer to the simultaneous\nuse of multiple language forms and signs and the ensuing\nconflicts among them (e.g., Bailey, 2012), whereas critical\napplied linguists Makoni and Pennycook (2012) question the\ntraditional view of languages as discrete entities rather than\nfluid and dynamic acts of identity. Makoni and Pennycook\nuse the term lingua franca multilingualism to describe this\nview.\nThe L2 motivation field has not actively engaged with\nthese debates. Just as its name suggests, L2 motivation\nresearch has mostly looked at learning an L2, typically\nEnglish. For example, Boo et al.'s (2015) survey shows that\nresearch into the motivation to learn English was by far more\npredominant than research into all other languages com-\nbined. Similarly, in the context of heritage language learning,\nComanaru and Noels (2009) point out that little work has\nbeen done to examine the motivational and affective profiles\nof these learners. In the context of indigenous languages,\nBall (2009) also reports that she conducted a literature search\non the difficulties experienced by indigenous language learn-\ners, but she could not find a single study that satisfied her\nsearch criteria. To quote Leeman and King (2015), research\non minority languages \"remains marginalized, underfunded,\nand often an after-thought\" (p. 211).\nRecently, some researchers argued that the dynamics of\nthe motivation to learn (Global) English might be very dif-\nferent from those of learning LOTEs (D\u00f6rnyei & Al-Hoorie,\nin press). Because of the status of English, the motivation to\nlearning it might interfere with the motivation to learn other\nlanguages. As an illustration, D\u00f6rnyei, Csiz\u00e9r, and N\u00e9meth\n(2006) conduct a large-scale longitudinal investigation of\nlanguage learning motivation--involving more than 13,000\nlearners over a period of 12 years focusing on five target lan-\nguages (English, German, French, Italian, and Russian) in\nHungary. The results revealed a fundamental restructuring of\nthe different L2 learning dispositions. English maintained its\nAl-Hoorie 7\nhigh profile, but the other languages dropped steadily. Even\nthe former lingua franca of the region, German, gradually\nbecame limited to only a selected few. Furthermore, Global\nEnglish itself also displayed a marked shift over the decade:\nAlthough its popularity remained as strong as ever, the cor-\nrelational link between motivation and the choice of English\nfor language learning decreased, suggesting that the study of\nEnglish is increasingly becoming a self-evident part of edu-\ncation rather than an L2-specific motivated decision.\nSubsequent analysis also suggests that language learners\ndevelop distinct ideal L2 self-guides (see D\u00f6rnyei & Chan,\n2013). It is therefore likely that the self-guides of the influen-\ntial language would develop more strongly at the expense of\nself-guides related to other languages. Indeed, in a cluster\nanalysis study, Csiz\u00e9r and D\u00f6rnyei (2005) identify different\nlearner profiles and demonstrated that a positive disposition\ntoward one language can clash with that of another. Similarly,\ndifferent languages possess separate self-concepts and that\nthe motivation to learn English can deplete the working self-\nconcept, thus disadvantaging LOTEs.\nAll of this leads to the conclusion that the motivational\nbasis of learning English may be quite distinct from that of\nlearning LOTEs. Because most available research is English-\nbiased, the available theories most likely reflect learning\nEnglish rather than LOTEs. Paying more attention to LOTEs\nhas the potential to deepen our understanding of the complexi-\nties involved in language learning motivation. One interesting\noutcome of researching LOTEs is that the role in integrative\nmotivation seems to resurface. Integrative motivation might\nbe a relevant concept in the context of LOTEs as there is usu-\nally a specific community out there that speaks the language\nand that is considered the \"owner\" of that language. In addi-\ntion, many individuals who decide to take up learning a certain\nLOTE do so because they are already in the geographical area\nwhere the language is spoken or because they plan to move\nthere. A person trying to learn Danish, for example, would\nmost likely be thinking about a localized community rather\nthan imagining themselves as a global citizen. The motivation\nto learn LOTEs is the subject of an upcoming special issue\n(Ushioda & D\u00f6rnyei, in press), which is likely going to stimu-\nlate further theoretical and empirical research in the future.\nTechnology and Motivation\nthe bond between technology and language use in the modern\nworld should prompt all language professionals to reflect on the\nways in which technology is changing the profession of English\nlanguage teaching in particular, and applied linguistics as a\nwhole. (Chapelle, 2003, p. 1, emphasis in original)\nSubsequently, computer assisted language learning (CALL)\nbecame mainstream in applied linguistics with various\napplications, especially in language testing (e.g., Chapelle &\nDouglas, 2006). Language motivation researchers also rec-\nognized the potential technology has. In an early study,\nWarschauer (1996) finds that students--regardless of gen-\nder, experience with computers, or learning context (second\nvs. foreign)--have positive attitudes toward using computers\nfor writing and communication, and so the author recom-\nmended that teachers exploit this to enhance student motiva-\ntion. Appel and Mullen (2002) also examine the effect of\nengaging in email exchanges on language learning. The\nauthors devoted a section of their article to discuss the moti-\nvational implications of this strategy. Admittedly, however,\nalthough research into CALL has flourished over the years,\nthere has been little overlap between the CALL and language\nmotivation literatures, and these two disciplines have pro-\ngressed largely independently.\nTo further complicate the scene, there has been an explo-\nsive growth in the use of technology in everyday life recently.\nIn fact, due to the ease of access to online technology and its\ninteractive nature, the popularity of TV and DVDs is starting\nto wane among young people (Henry, 2013). Nowadays,\nyoung people have access to a variety of social networking\nwebsites that facilitate exposure to the L2 such as Facebook,\nTwitter, Instagram, and Snapchat, as well as interactive 3D\ngaming such as Counter-Strike, Call of Duty, World of\nWitchcraft, The Sims, Second Life, and Unity (e.g.,\nCollentine, 2011; Deutschmann, Panichi, & Molka-\nInternet users can also easily read and contribute to discus-\nsion forums, blogs, wikis, and other online communities, all\nbut certainly not least, there is the pervasive prevalence of\nsmart phones, tablet computers, and wireless laptops\n(Stockwell, 2013). These gadgets also come with a bewilder-\ning amount of educational apps (Hirsh-Pasek et al., 2015). In\nApple Store alone, there are currently more than 75,000 edu-\ncational apps ready to download (Apple, 2017). This comes\namid skepticism about the utility of these apps, and even\nconcerns that they might, ironically, lead to screen addiction,\nincreased aggression, depression, and anxiety (Kardaras,\n2016). The inevitable conclusion from the changing face of\ntoday's language learning (cf. J. C. Richards, 2015) is that \"a\nIt is clear that language motivation research is still lag-\nging behind these developments. At the same time, this rap-\nidly evolving popular culture now constitutes a competition\nfor classroom learning (Gee & Hayes, 2010a). As an illustra-\ntion, Henry (2013) reports an authenticity gap that an increas-\ning number of language learners are experiencing. That is,\nmany learners are exposed to the L2 both inside and outside\nthe classroom, but their experiences outside the classroom\nare much more stimulating. Contemporary digital gaming,\nfor example, requires intense interaction, communication,\nand cooperation with real people (usually in English) to pro-\nceed in the game. These interactions may include devising\n8 SAGE Open\nsophisticated strategies and plans to carry out military opera-\ntions to defeat opponents or monsters, which stimulates a lot\nof creativity and imagination and which can easily induce\nlong flow experiences. These interactions also take place\nwith players from all over the world, including native speak-\ners of English, thus increasingly blurring the line between\nsecond and foreign language contexts. Native speakers are\nnow virtually present, and so they no longer need to be pres-\nent physically in the neighborhood for learners to have regu-\nlar and meaningful interactions with them. These experiences\ndwarf the routine activities that learners do in the classroom,\nwhich now appear banal and trivial in comparison. A number\nof researchers have therefore called for building bridges\nbetween the classroom and these digital leisure activities to\nmake classroom learning more motivating to today's learners\nToday's technology has expanded what used to be imag-\ninable for learners and teachers, opening the gate for imag-\nined identities that are characteristic of the new world\norder (Darvin & Norton, 2015). Drawing from earlier work\nargues that technology can be used to harness the learners'\ntransportable identities. The notion of transportable iden-\ntities refers to latent dimensions of one's identity that can\nbe invoked in interaction, such as the teacher being a cat\nlover or the student being a fan of Manchester United.\nUshioda explains that drawing from the identities learners\ndevelop through technology would encourage them to\nengage more genuinely in target-language communica-\ntions in the classroom. Teachers are no longer limited to\nthe handout they bring to the classroom everyday, but can\nnow draw from topics they find interesting in discussion\nforums, live chats, blogs, wikis, podcasts, social network-\ning sites, and video-sharing sites. This makes lesson plan-\nning take a new meaning. As this approach treats them as\n\"people\" rather than as abstract \"language learners,\" stu-\ndents would develop a greater sense of autonomy and own-\nership of the activity, thus leading to more investment\n(Ushioda, 2011). This is certainly a promising area for\nfuture research.\nConclusion\nThis article has reviewed the three major phases that the lan-\nguage motivation field has passed through. The most recent\nphase is characterized by a number of diverse themes. In\nfact, D\u00f6rnyei and Ryan (2015) warn that the expanding scope\nof language motivation research may lead to fragmentation\nin which researchers in our field \"will no longer speak the\nsame language\" (p. 102). This seems to be the natural evolu-\ntion of academic fields as they mature (for an example in\npsychology, see Sternberg, 2005). The real danger is when\ndifferent research strands use different jargons to describe\nvery similar phenomena but with little overlap in their refer-\nence lists.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAl-Hoorie, A.
