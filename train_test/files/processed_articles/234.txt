Of these, 77% were\nmale (male vs female adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.1; 95%\nconfidence interval [CI], 2.3-4.1). Substance use, school\nproblems, perpetration of violence, and witnessing vio-\nlence were significantly associated with weapon carry-\ning for both males and females. However, for males, ex-\ntrinsic factors were more important in mediating the\neffects of substance use and perpetration of physical vio-\nlence on school weapon carrying, while intrinsic factors\nmediate these variables for females.\nConclusion: These findings suggest that interventions\nfor violence prevention for males and females need to be\ntargeted toward different areas.\nYouth Risk Behavior Sur-\nvey, 10% of high school\nstudents reported carry-\ning a weapon to school in\nthe previous 30 days.1 Although the rates\nof reported fighting and weapon carrying\nare decreasing, the prevalence of expo-\nsure to violence at school is high.2 Since\ncized school shootings, the majority of\nwhich have been in high schools and were\ncommitted by students who carried guns\nto school.\nWeapon carrying can result in vio-\nlence.3,4 Weapon carrying has most typi-\ncally been defined in surveys as carrying\na gun, knife, or club.2,5-7 Violence, in turn,\nhas been defined as a threatened or ac-\ntual use of physical force against a person\nor group that either results in or is likely\nto result in injury or death.8 Students who\ncarry a weapon at school may choose not\nto use it, but weapon carrying increases\nthe potential for physical injury or death.\nFor this reason, recent school shootings\nhave heightened the need to identify de-\nmographic, intrinsic, and extrinsic risk fac-\ntors associated with weapon carrying at\nschool. Although protective factors are im-\nportant to consider, risk factors are im-\nportant to assess for early identification of\nthose adolescents who are likely to carry\na weapon at school. The biopsychosocial\nmodel proposed by Irwin et al9 is used to\nexplain many problem behaviors in ado-\nlescents. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors,\nsuch as those listed previously, are hy-\npothesized to predict risk behaviors such\nas weapon carrying, through their effect\non cognition, self-perceptions, percep-\ntions of the social environment, and per-\nsonal values. By examining both sets of fac-\ntors, we can assess adolescents' weapon\ncarrying from a more contextual view. Ex-\ntrinsic factors can reduce the effects of in-\ntrinsic risk factors and vice versa. Extrin-\nsic and intrinsic factors can also interact\nARTICLE\nFrom the Division of Adolescent\nMedicine, Children's Hospital\nat Strong, University of\nRochester Medical Center\n(Dr Kodjo), and the\nDepartment of Pediatrics,\nRochester General Hospital\n(Dr Ryan and Ms Auinger),\nRochester, NY.\n\u00a92003 American Medical Association.

For\nexample, we hypothesize that an impulsive adolescent\nwho has good interpersonal relationships would be pro-\ntected from high-risk behaviors. Similarly, we hypoth-\nesize that an aggressive adolescent who has easy access\nto weapons and who is exposed to routine community\nviolence would be at high risk for carrying a weapon at\nschool.\nPrevious literature regarding school weapon carry-\ninghasfocusedontheassociationsbetweenadolescentrisk\nnot examine the combined effects of demographic, intrin-\nsic, and extrinsic factors on weapon-carrying behaviors.\nFor the purposes of this study, we defined intrinsic\nfactors as internal qualities that affect decision making,\nand extrinsic factors as experiences that adolescents have\nwith the people at home, in their schools, and in their\ncommunities.\nOur category of intrinsic factors included impulsiv-\nity, mental health, and sense of the future. Adolescents\nwho are depressed or who do not have a sense of the fu-\nture are more likely to engage in risk behaviors like\nweapon carrying.15 We include substance use and per-\npetration of physical violence as intrinsic factors be-\ncause of their strong correlation to weapon carrying as\negory of extrinsic factors included connectedness, expo-\nsures to violence in one's community, and safety and vic-\ntimization. These factors have all been found to have\nsignificant correlations with weapon carrying or high-\nThis cross-sectional study is one of the first5,6,11 to\nexamine these diverse variables and their association with\nweapon carrying at school using a large, nationally rep-\nresentative database. The National Longitudinal Study for\nAdolescent Health (Add Health) includes items that ad-\ndress extrinsic and intrinsic factors. The objectives of this\nstudy were to assess the prevalence of weapon carrying\nat school, and to determine those risk factors associated\nwith carrying a weapon at school for adolescent males\nand females.\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nAdd Health assesses the health of adolescents and explores the\ncauses of their health-related behaviors. It is a school-based,\nnationally representative survey of 7th to 12th graders aged 11\nto 21 years in the United States. A sample of 80 high schools\nwas selected and stratified by region of the country, urbanicity,\nschool type, ethnic mix, and size. Schools that sent their\n7th- and 8th-grade graduates on to that high school (feeder\nschools) were identified and recruited. Some high schools\nspanned 7th to 12th grade and therefore, served as their own\nfeeder school. A total of 134 schools were recruited. More than\n90000 adolescents were surveyed in targeted schools, and a\nsample of 12105 adolescents and their parents were then sur-\nveyed at home.\nThere were 3 survey instruments, 1 in-school and 2 in-\nhome, that gathered information from the adolescents and their\nparents. There were several other instruments regarding con-\ntextual variables, school information, and interviewer assess-\nments. Additional detail regarding the Add Health sampling\ndesign is available at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects\n/addhealth/. Variables from the adolescent in-home, parent\nin-home, and the neighborhood or community context instru-\nments were used for the adolescent, socioeconomic, and con-\ntextual data in this study.\nvided cross-sectional data on 6504 adolescents. The mean age\nof study participants was 15.5 years, and 49% were female. Sixty-\nseven percent of participants were white, 16% were African\nAmerican, 12% were Latino, and 5% were \"other,\" including\nAsians, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders.\nVARIABLES\nThe dependent outcome variable of interest was \"Have you ever\ncarried a weapon at school?\" The response categories were yes\nor no. A preceding question defined a weapon as \"a gun, knife,\nor club.\" Independent demographic factors included: age, gen-\nder, race, ethnicity, parental level of education, urbanicity (de-\nfined in the census data as a central place with an adjacent,\ndensely settled surrounding territory, together having a mini-\nmum of 50000 persons), and neighborhood poverty status.\nOther independent factors included perceived longevity, school\nsuspension, safety in the community, witnessing violence, in-\nvolvement in domestic, dating or sexual violence, substance use\nat school, and access to a gun at home.\nIn addition to the above independent variables, scales were\ncreated to address other risk factors. For example, the perpe-\ntration scale was composed of questions regarding frequency\nof physical fighting, gang fighting activity, and threatening\nsomeone with a weapon. Six scales were created, containing\n3 to 7 items. The scales were (1) interpersonal connectedness,\n(2) perpetration of physical violence, (3) mental health is-\nsues, (4) school connectedness, (5) violent victimization, and\n(6) impulsivity. Specific variables included in each scale are pre-\nsented in Table 1.\nMany of the items included in the scales were 3-point or\n5-point Likert responses.24 All items were assessed for consis-\ntency of low score meaning low-risk, and high score meaning\nhigh-risk. The responses of those items in each scale were then\nadded to create a score for each adolescent. Adolescents who\nmissed more than 1 question in the scale were not included in\nthe analyses. The frequency distribution for each scale was\ndetermined, and low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk clinical\ncategories were created for each scale based on the tercile dis-\ntribution of the scores.\nData were analyzed using principal component analyses to dis-\ntinguish individual variables for school and interpersonal con-\nnectedness. Cronbach  values used to measure the internal\nvalidity of each scale were as follows: interpersonal connect-\nedness, =.72 for 6 items; perpetration of physical violence,\n=.72 for 7 items; mental health, =.70 for 6 items; school con-\nnectedness, =.65 for 7 items; victimization, =.65 for 5 items;\nand impulsivity, =.62 for 5 items.\nWeighted frequencies and Pearson 2 testing were done\nusing SPSS 8.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill), to determine factors\nindependently associated with weapon carrying at school. Be-\ncause there were many significant factors, a Spearman corre-\nlational matrix was done to assess multicollinearity.

Significant factors (P.05) were then included for hier-\narchical modeling.\nHierarchical regressions using SUDAAN (Research Tri-\nangle Park, NC) assessed confounding and effect modification\nfor demographic variables by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Con-\nfounding is the mixing of effects or the distortion of the true\nrelationship between the outcome and independent vari-\nable.25 Effect modification is the interaction of variables such that\nthe association between one variable and the outcome is influ-\nenced by the other variables.25 We grouped independent vari-\nables into 3 subsets: demographic factors, intrinsic factors, and\nextrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors included chance of being killed\nby age 21 years, mental health, impulsivity, perpetration of physi-\ncal violence, being high or drunk at school, and school sus-\npension. Extrinsic factors included school connectedness, in-\nterpersonal connectedness, victimization, partner violence,\nsexual assault, witnessing violence, neighbors looking out for\neach other, neighborhood safety, and access to a gun.\nHierarchical models first included demographics; then,\ncombined demographics with intrinsic and extrinsic factors,\nseparately; and finally, combined all 3 subsets of factors. Hi-\nerarchical regressions examined the mediating and interactive\neffects of extrinsic and intrinsic factors before being com-\nbined into a composite logistic regression. These analyses were\nperformed for the overall sample, and separately for adoles-\ncent males and females. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-\nfit test for the model was P=.17 for males and P=.20 for fe-\nmales, demonstrating that the models should not be rejected.26\nTable 1.

Seventy-seven percent\nof weapon-carrying adolescents were male (adjusted odds\nratio[AOR]=3.2;malevsfemale,P.05).Adolescentswho\nhad carried a weapon to school in the last month (n=371)\nwere asked, \"During the past 30 days, what one kind of\nweapon did you carry most often to school?\" Sixty-seven\npercent of these adolescents reported carrying a knife or\nrazor; 13%, a handgun; 8%, some other kind of weapon;\n7%, a club; and 5%, a rifle or shotgun. Males were signifi-\ncantly more likely than females to carry a weapon. Eighty-\nthree percent of handgun carriers, 85% of rifle or shotgun\ncarriers, 82% of club carriers, 78% of knife or razor carri-\ners, and 66% of other weapon carriers were male.\nNeighborhood poverty and parental education less\nthan or equal to a high school level were significantly as-\nsociated with weapon carrying at school. Age was signifi-\ncant , with adolescents aged 15 to 17 years being most at\nrisk for weapon carrying. Urban environment was not sig-\nnificant. Table 2 presents cross-tabulation data on preva-\nlence of weapon carrying by demographic variables.\nThrough hierarchical regressions, we examined effect\nmodification and confounding effects for race and eth-\nnicity, neighborhood poverty, and parental education. Be-\ncause male gender was the most significant risk factor\nfor weapon carrying at school in the overall sample, we\nalso examined gender differences in separate analyses\n(Table 3).\nInitial analyses included only independently sig-\nnificant demographic factors (age, gender, race, ethnic-\nity, parental level of education, urbanicity, and neigh-\nborhood poverty status) in the regression model. Male\nadolescents with a high school\u00adeducated parent were 1.6\ntimes as likely to carry a weapon at school than males\nwhose parent had less than or more than a high school\neducation. African American and Latino female adoles-\ncents were 2.8 and 2.4 times, respectively, as likely as white\nfemales to carry a weapon.\nFor the second set of hierarchical analyses, high\nschool\u00adlevel parental education was no longer signifi-\ncant for males when intrinsic and extrinsic factors were\nseparately added into the model. For females, being Af-\nrican American or Latino remained significant despite add-\ning intrinsic and extrinsic factors into the model, al-\nthough the odds ratios associated with being African\nAmerican or Latino decreased with each step. African\nAmerican and Latino females were 2.6 and 2.4 times, re-\nspectively, as likely as white females to carry a weapon\nwhen intrinsic factors were accounted for, and they were\n1.9 and 2.2 times as likely when extrinsic factors were\naccounted for. These models demonstrated that intrin-\nsic and extrinsic factors act as confounders for parental\neducation for males, and as effect modifiers for race or\nethnicity for females.\nThe second set of hierarchical analyses--adding intrin-\nsic and extrinsic factors separately--demonstrated many\nfactors that were significantly associated with weapon car-\nrying (Table 3). When these factors were combined in\nthe final model, several factors were no longer signifi-\ncant. For example, intrinsic factors such as impulsivity\nand perceived longevity were no longer significant for\nmales once extrinsic factors were added. Likewise, sexual\nassault was no longer significant once intrinsic factors\nwere added. This portion of the model demonstrated that\nintrinsic and extrinsic factors can serve as confounders\nfor each other. There is also effect modification between\nthese 2 sets of factors as seen by the decreased adjusted\nodds ratios for each variable in the final model.\nTable 2.

The results for the fe-\nmale subgroups are presented in Table 5. Females who\nwere classified as \"other\" race were not included in these\nanalyses because of the small sample size (n=128). As\npresented in Table 5, there were differences between the\ngroups.

The results of the hierarchical regressions ex-\npand our understanding of the interaction of demo-\ngraphic, intrinsic, and extrinsic factors relative with school\nweapon carrying. For example, the hierarchical regres-\nsions demonstrate that the effects of parental education\nand neighborhood poverty were mediated by intrinsic and\nextrinsic factors. The fact that environment was not sig-\nnificant in our bivariate analyses speaks to the impor-\ntance of other factors such as the ones we propose here,\nto explain the problem of school weapon carrying.\nSignificant factors in the final model were consis-\ntent with the previous literature. This study demon-\nstrated that male gender was one of the most significant\nrisk factors associated with weapon carrying at school.3,16\nThese findings countered those of Simon et al,5 who found\nfemales to be more likely to carry a weapon than males.\nAfrican American and Latino females in our sample were\nat risk for weapon carrying. It is unclear why race or eth-\nnicity was significant for females, but not for males. Race\nor ethnicity and poverty are difficult to separate because\nmany African American and Latino families in the United\nStates live in concentrated poverty.29 Decreased neigh-\nborhood cohesion secondary to concentrated poverty may\nput African American and Latino females at risk for vic-\ntimization.30 Indeed, in the specific ethnicity/gender analy-\nses, other factors such as neighborhood safety became\nimportant for African American females. For protec-\ntion, these females may choose to carry a weapon to in-\nsure safety in their neighborhood, and by extension, at\nschool. As demonstrated by the other factors that proved\nsignificant in the analyses of factors among females (eg,\nbeing drunk at school), these African American and La-\ntino females who carried weapons were particularly high-\nrisk subgroups.\nThose males with a history of partner violence were\nat a greater risk factor for school weapon carrying than\nthose males who did not. Theoretical models often link\naggression and violent behavior and can be used here to\nexplain the association of partner violence to school\nweapon carrying. However, the survey item did not dis-\ntinguish between being a perpetrator or a victim with re-\nspect to partner violence. Partner violence, in compari-\nson to perpetration of physical violence, seems to indicate\na more severe form of interpersonal violence that strongly\ncorrelates with weapon carrying.\nAn association exists between substance use and\nweapon carrying.6,16 The use of substances at school might\nindicate that this was a subgroup of males and females\nwho were not feeling connected or engaged in school.\nTheir substance use at school may also have conse-\nquences for decision-making, as adolescents under the\ninfluence are less likely to consider the consequences of\nweapon carrying.\nSchool connectedness and interpersonal connect-\nedness were significantly protective against school weapon\ncarrying for all males and for African American females.\nConsistent with the resiliency model,17 the more assets\nadolescents have, the more likely that they will make posi-\ntive choices. Good relationships with parents, teachers,\nother adults, and peers are important assets that contrib-\nute positively to an adolescent's behavior. Adolescent fe-\nmales, on the other hand, were 2.5 times more likely to\ncarry a weapon at school if they had been suspended.\nSchool suspension may suggest behavioral issues and\nacademic failure rather than lack of connectedness.\nSchool suspension again emphasizes that these weapon-\ncarrying females were a high-risk subgroup.\nPerpetration of physical violence and witnessing vio-\nlence was significant in both gender analyses. Victimiza-\ntion, on the other hand, was significant for males and white\nfemales. Adolescents who have been victimized may feel\nTable 5.

Interestingly, victimization was significant only\nfor white females. Adolescent females are more at risk\nfor sexual assault than males,31 yet victimization does not\nseem to be a motivator to carry a weapon at school for\nsome females.\nSurprisingly, access to a gun at home was mini-\nmally significant for males. In this same adolescent sample,\nit was found that the majority of weapon-carrying ado-\nlescents carried a knife or razor at school, which would\nexplain why easy access to a gun was not more signifi-\ncant in our analyses. However, the fact that access to fire-\narms has increased the lethality of violence32 makes it a\nparticularly important issue to retain in discussions re-\ngarding potential school violence.\nThese findings suggest that interventions for vio-\nlence prevention for males and females need to be tar-\ngeted toward different areas. Males may benefit from ex-\ntrinsic supports such as interpersonal and school\nconnectedness, and lack of access to a gun, despite being\nimpulsive or having decreased perceived longevity. Fe-\nmales may benefit from interventions that improve prob-\nlem-solving skills.\nLIMITATIONS\nThere are, however, limitations. Our analysis uses one\nwave of data, and therefore, could not assess causality.\nOnly longitudinal data will allow us to understand if an-\ntecedent factors like school and interpersonal connect-\nedness predict protection against future school weapon\ncarrying. Longitudinal studies are also needed to assess\nadolescents' sense of security in light of recent national\nschool shootings and their subsequent decisions to carry\na weapon or not. Add Health is a school-based survey.\nWe do not have access to the those adolescents who have\nbeen expelled or who have dropped out of school, as\nschool failure is highly correlated with violence and other\nhigh-risk behaviors.33 This study relied on adolescent self-\nreport as the \"gold standard,\" with no means to corrobo-\nrate weapon carrying at school. This item about weapon\ncarrying posed a threat to validity because it is a sensi-\ntive question regarding illegal behavior. Thus, we may\nbe underestimating the prevalence of school weapon car-\nrying. Also, Add Health did not include specific items\nabout chronic (and potentially more desensitizing) do-\nmestic or community violence exposure. There were also\nno items regarding other contexts for weapon carrying,\nadolescent attitudes about weapon carrying, or the vio-\nlent content of television and video games to which the\nadolescents were exposed.\nIMPLICATIONS\nViolence prevention programming must be community\nbased to encompass adolescents who carry weapons at\nand outside of school. For school weapon carrying spe-\ncifically, intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as sub-\nstance use, coping skills, school behavioral problems, and\nconnectedness must be addressed. Additionally, vio-\nlence interventions need to be tailored to gender, racial,\nand ethnic differences in risk.\nThis study was funded in part by the Maternal and Child\nHealth Bureau, Gaithersburg, Md.\nWe thank Jonathan Klein, MD, MPH, Kerry Knox, PhD,\nand Richard Kreipe, MD for their valuable input and sup-\nport.\nReprints: Cheryl M.

Previous litera-\nture regarding school weapon carrying has focused on\nindividual correlates of violent behavior. This study ex-\namined the combined effects of demographic, intrinsic,\nand extrinsic factors by using a large, nationally repre-\nsentative database, the National Longitudinal Study for\nAdolescent Health. Substance use, perpetration of physi-\ncal violence, and witnessing violence were significant cor-\nrelates overall. However, for males, extrinsic factors were\nfound to be more important in mediating the effects of\nsubstance use and perpetration on school weapon car-\nrying, while intrinsic factors mediate these variables for\nfemales.
