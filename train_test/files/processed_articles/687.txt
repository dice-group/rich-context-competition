This article proposes a construct that profiles five generic types of retirement\nplans, including plans to retire completely, retire partially, change jobs, never retire, and uncertainty about\nretirement. The heuristic value of the construct lies in its recognition of the heterogeneity of retirement intentions. The\nfive plan types were operationalized among workers aged 51--61 in the 1992 Health and Retirement Study. Convergent\nvalidity was demonstrated by comparison to analogous survey questions. Construct validity was shown by predictable\nrelationships between intentions and elements of workers' opportunity structure. The retirement-plans construct can\nserve as the foundation for a taxonomy of specific retirement plans (e.g., about timing, employment), to organize\nresearch on stability and change in retirement intentions, and characterize the path dependence of eventual retirement\nbehavior.\nHOW people come to retire as they do is an enduring topic\nof interest. We outline an extended conception of\nretirement decision making that identifies workers' plans for\nretirement as provisional intentions creating paths toward\nlater behavior. In order to provide a conceptual tool for\nresearch about plans, we propose here a scheme to character-\nize workers' general stance toward retirement. We examine\nthe validity of our multinomial construct for measuring\nplans, and discuss its usefulness for research on the retire-\nment process.\nAlthough a great deal of research has been organized\naround the \"retirement decision,\" these investigations have\nusually studied the outcomes, rather than the actual making,\nof decisions. These outcomes -- retired or not, early or late,\npartially or completely -- surely do proceed from personal\ndecisions in the context of opportunity. Yet, outcome studies\nleave processes of decision making largely unobserved (ex-\nceptions being specific studies of temporary incentive pro-\ngrams, e.g., Hardy and Quadagno, 1995). Moreover, the\nidentification of outcomes with presumed decisions suggests\nthat decision making for retirement is an end-game election\nof practicable alternatives.\nConsider, rather, the idea that decision making for retire-\nment extends over a considerable period of time -- years --\nprior to the retirement event, and so the retirement behav-\niors (that are the focus of so much research) have anteced-\nents in earlier decisions made and remade that will have\nchannelled workers toward particular outcomes. At this\njuncture, two questions present themselves: How does re-\nsearch access the stream of decision making, and, How\nmight upstream decision making be consequential for even-\ntual retirement behavior?\nPlans as Provisional, Consequential Decisions\nWorkers' engagement with the prospect of retirement is\nnormative. With the institutionalization of retirement in the\nmodern life course (O'Rand, 1990), few adults can be\nunaware that they will encounter the question of retirement.\nExactly when this encounter begins to be personally salient\nis hard to say, yet there has been some study of how the\nencounter unfolds as a preretirement process of role exit\nsearch, it is reasonable to expect that workers' anticipatory\ninvolvement with retirement is underway during their 50s.\nWith advancing age, workers progressively engage (or are\nbrought by others to engage) in questions about their retire-\nment: Will it happen? When? Under what arrangement? To\nthe extent that workers entertain ideas about what they will\ndo, or may do, or will not do, we contend that workers are\nengaged in provisional decision making for retirement, and\nthat these ideas are their plans. Plans, more formally, are\nbehavioral intentions about retirement. Workers' decision-\nmaking occasions are not readily accessible to research, but\nbehavioral intentions are, and there is a considerable tradi-\ntion of research on intentions (as disclosed by survey tech-\nniques) as the precursors of behavior (Azjen and Fishbein,\n1980). Plans, then, are the practical window into decision\nmaking for retirement at any remove from the event. In the\narray of such intentions (or lack thereof), decision making\nfor retirement becomes quite available for study.\nGiven the norm of retirement in the modern life course,\nwhy do workers entertain plans for this or that sort of\nretirement, or no plans at all? We posit that workers antici-\npate their late career and retirement alternatives from within\nan \"opportunity structure\" composed of biographical and\nsituational factors that make action conceivable in the pur-\nMerton, 1968). Workers have choices, options, and alterna-\ntives, but only as opportunity allows. Workers who intend to\nact in ways for which they have small opportunity (e.g.,\nretire at 55) will have unstable plans.\nAn outline of the opportunity structure includes many of\nthe same factors that have been used to predict the retirement\nbehavior that is temporally downstream from plans (Feld-\nQuinn, Burkhauser, and Myers, 1990). The opportunity\nstructure of a 50- or 55-year-old worker facing retirement\nwould theoretically consist of such elements as: ascribed\nstatuses (age, gender, race), the occupational situation, cur-\nrent income and wealth, pension and other income prospects,\nmarital and family roles, health, community ties, and prior\nexperience with retirement. These are rarely independent\nelements; for example, issues of gender and work cannot be\ncompletely separated.\nWhile plans anticipate later transitions, these intentions\nare also of interest and of consequence for the interim\nbehaviors they may prompt along the way. Such preparation\nsteps are instrumental acts that workers undertake in pursuit\nof a goal-directed activity such as retirement (Bagozzi and\nWarshaw, 1992). The acts that flow from intentions may\ninclude steps such as a savings program, acquisition of\ninformation, the resolve to work toward pension eligibility\non the current job, positioning oneself for a post-retirement\njob, the purchase of retirement property, or announcing\nintentions to family and coworkers. Cumulatively, these\nsteps and signals would create a course toward particular\noutcomes and away from others. There may be, to borrow a\nphrase from elsewhere in social science (Arthur, 1989), a\n\"path dependence\" to retirement decision making wherein\nearly choices constrain later options.\nPlans, we allow, may change over time. Aside from\nstudies of the expected timing for retirement (Anderson,\nabout the dynamics of behavioral intentions toward retire-\nment. To what plans do workers hold fast over time? What\nfactors contribute to unwavering plans? Do plans change\ndependably from one type to another? If the opportunity\nstructure, composed of such biographical and situational\nfactors as sketched above, is the platform for timing at any\none point in time, then change in these elements should\nherald a change in plans. Such turns as job loss, position\nchanges, health events, divorce or widowhood, advancing\nage, additional tenure, a changing labor market, and other\nalterations of opportunity should prompt workers to reexam-\nine their plans in ways that are theoretically predictable.\nMoreover, plans not buttressed by instrumental preparation\nsteps should be especially vulnerable to revision when op-\nportunity shifts.\nUltimately, knowledge of the planning history should add\nconsiderable explanatory power to models of retirement\nbehavior. The deeper and longer the intention to retire in a\nparticular way, the stronger will be the link between inten-\ntion and behavior. When a worker retires completely, or\ntakes a postretirement job, or forgoes Social Security in\nfavor of continued employment, such a step is likely to be an\noutcome that has been constrained, facilitated, and funneled\ndown by years of living with the knowledge of retirement as\nan occupational eventuality (Ebaugh, 1988). Preparation\nsteps that flow from intentions are \"side bets\" (Becker,\n1960) made on the way to retirement that commit workers to\npaths they cannot readily reverse. The obverse of these\nactive goal-directed behaviors is preparatory passivity that\nlater bars workers from adopting paths that they had earlier\nforgone. We contend, therefore, that workers' progressive\nimplication into a course of action for retirement can be\nobserved through the series of plans that they entertain over\ntime, thus expanding the temporal scope and explanatory set\nfor analyses of retirement behavior.\nAn Economical Profile of Retirement Plans\nAn extended model of retirement decision making re-\nquires a strategy for measuring workers' plans for retire-\nment. Various types of indicators have been used to describe\nthe anticipation of the retirement event and retired life. The.\nfocus in this article is on plans, that is, personal designs or\nintentions toward the conclusion of the work career and the\ninitiation of retired life. Designs and intentions for retire-\nment can be characterized along several dimensions. We can\ndescribe plans according to the foreseen eventuality of retire-\nment: workers think they will retire, they won't retire, they\ndon't know. Plans can be made for the projected timing of\ntransitions at some age or date, which is also bound to one's\nplanned manner and mix of pension receipt. Plans can also\nbe made about sequences of employment, e.g., shifts from\nfull-time employment to partial retirement or complete re-\ntirement, or a shift from wage employment to self-\nemployment. Plans can be organized around a life style,\ne.g., retirement to a certain place, or for a long-awaited\nsecond career.\nSo intertwined are these dimensions that no single one\nadequately captures the complexity of retirement plans as\nuniquely personal futures sketched in with more or less\nprecision and certainty. Single dimensions also focus atten-\ntion on holders of specific plans (e.g., retire by age 62), with\nthose not holding the intentions relegated to a residual status.\nWe think, however, that it is possible to subsume multiple\ndimensions and characterize the heterogeneity of workers'\nretirement plans using a limited number of categories.\nWe propose a multinomial construct that economically\nprofiles generic types of retirement plans. This construct,\nmoreover, can serve as the foundation for a taxonomy, or\nconceptual arrangement of all sorts of specific plans. Ideally,\nthis construct should have enough categories to encompass\nadequately the variety of workers' outlooks, but not so many\nas to be analytically unwieldy. In our view, the categories\nshould also characterize workers' current ideas about next or\nproximate transitions, not their notions about patterns of\npossible moves or the final situation. Lastly, the categories\nshould faithfully reproduce what previous survey research\nhas disclosed to be workers' typical responses about antici-\npated retirement arrangements (e.g., Louis Harris, 1979;\nThe following five-category construct that we propose\nanticipates the major types of retirement behavior. Plans for\nbehavior are thus classified nearly as the behavior could\nitself be classified (e.g., Myers, 1991). The first and sim-\nplest category comprises workers who plan to retire com-\npletely -- the classic retirement. Full-stop retirement is the\neventual destination for most workers, but it is not necessar-\nily the present plan that they entertain. The second and third\ncategories describe more complex paths to implied, eventual\nretirement (Doeringer, 1990). One is the group who are\nplanning partial retirement or some reduced-effort arrange-\nment. The other group are those who think that they will\nobtain another job after the current job, not exactly retiring\nbut not remaining either.\nThe last two groups of older workers are usually not\nincluded in analyses of retirement planning, but they have an\nauthentic stance. One group would be those who explicitly\nrefuse to entertain the idea of retirement, people who,\nwhatever else they intend for future employment, reject the\nencounter with retirement. Persons who say they will\n\"never\" retire are excepting themselves from the idealized\nlife course, and they deserve focal status. The final group\nwould be those with no particular plans, a perfectly reason-\nable outlook that recognizes workers' uncertainty about the\nfuture. This group is quite important to recognize because\nthey may be risking disorderly, ill-considered transitions.\nIndeed, without this last type, our construct fails to encom-\npass the heterogeneity of retirement plans and merely de-\nscribes labor supply alternatives.\nThese five general plans for retirement -- complete retire-\nment, partial retirement, serial positions, never retire, and\nuncertainty -- should suffice to characterize the stances of\nall older workers. Other details of retirement planning, we\nwould argue, can be analyzed secondary to the general\nstance. Thus, timing, further occupational arrangements,\npension scheduling, and other life-style questions can be\nviewed as elaborations of the basic intention. This is not to\nsay that workers first form general plans and then decide\ndetails; rather, we think that plans can be placed first in a\ntaxonomic and analytic hierarchy.\nIf our multinomial construct is to serve as a conceptual tool\nfor research on retirement plans, we need to establish that\nsuch a tool is sound. For our proposed multinomial typology\nof retirement plans, this was done in two ways: first, by\nexamining the convergent validity of the categories, compar-\ning responses with analogous questions, and second, by\nexamining construct validity, checking the predicted associa-\ntion of plans categories with elements of the opportunity\nstructure. With confidence in the validity of the plans catego-\nries, we can proceed to discuss a more elaborate taxonomy of\nplans and further discuss ways by which this scheme might\norganize research on the preretirement process.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population\nThe analysis is based on data from the baseline 1992\nHealth and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally represent-\native sample of persons aged 51-61 and their spouses re-\ngardless of age (Juster and Suzman, 1995). Total sample size\nfor the first wave of this biennial longitudinal survey was\nlation for the present analysis included all persons aged 51-\n61 in the core sample; persons from Black and Hispanic\noversamples were not included. These 8,017 cases were\nfurther reduced by including only current workers who also\nclaimed they had not completely retired. This study popula-\nworking 35 or more hours per week.\nIt is important to remember that, in these cross-sectional\ndata, the older ranks of this age range will have already\nexperienced labor force departures due to early retirement.\nclaimed to be retired and also not currently working. When\ncompared to our study population of 5,072 workers, these\nalready retired persons are older by a mean 1.7 years, are\nsomewhat more likely to be females (53.4%) and non-\nWhites (14.7%), and they have a mean 0.8 fewer years of\neducation. To the extent that retirement plans are associated\nwith such characteristics as age or gender -- and they are --\nthe distribution of plans in a population will follow popula-\ntion characteristics. Yet it should be borne in mind that the\ndynamic of selective (early) retirement does not bias the\ndistribution of plans in cross-section because retirement\nplans are ideas only available as a practical matter from\nworkers not yet retired. However, within a workers' cohort\nobserved over time, the prevalence of plans will shift as\nmembers retire.\nMeasures\nThe five retirement-plan types were operationalized from\na survey question that followed a series on current employ-\nment. Workers were asked first about the \"usual retirement\nage\" on their main job, and then, \"Are you currently\nplanning to stop working altogether or work fewer hours at a\nparticular date or age, to change the kind of work you do\nwhen you reach a particular age, have you not given it much\nthought, or what?\" Although this question did not explicitly\nmention retirement, the preceding question would have set\nresponses in a retirement context.\nMultiple responses (as many as eight) could be recorded\nfor each respondent, though few gave more than one re-\nsponse. We categorized these responses in a hierarchical\nfashion, first grouping (1) all persons who said they planned\nto \"stop work altogether,\" (2) then all who would \"work\nfewer hours,\" (3) then all who would \"change the kind of\nwork\" or \"work for myself,\" (4) then all who would\n\"never stop work,\" and (5) then all who \"had not given lit]\nmuch thought\" or \"had no current plans.\" Workers with\n\"other\" responses (/? = 23) were dropped from the analy-\nsis. These five categories (Table 1) were labeled Stop Alto-\ngether, Reduce Effort, Change Job, Never Stop, and No\nPlans. Respondents in the first three categories had also been\nasked the age at which they planned to make the change.\nThese mutually exclusive categories nevertheless con-\ntained some individuals who offered more than one re-\nsponse. Based on planned ages for the change, workers were\nreassigned to the earliest occurring status if they expressed\nmultiple plans to Stop, Reduce, or Change Jobs. If workers\nexpressed plans to Stop and also to Reduce or Change Jobs at\nthe same age, they were re-assigned to the latter statuses. In\nall, 0.5 percent of cases were shifted among categories for\nexpressing serial retirement plans. The final distribution of\nthe plans categories for 5,049 workers is shown in Table 1.\nTo test the convergent validity of the plans scheme, three\nanalogous survey items about retirement expectations (lo-\ncated elsewhere in the interview) were involved in this\nanalysis. One pair of items asked respondents to state the\nchances on a 0-10 scale that they would be working (at any\njob) full-time past age 62 and past age 65. Another item\nasked workers, \"When do you think you will retire?\" or\nretire \"completely\" in the case of partial retirees; responses\nin calendar years were converted to expected ages. The final\nitem asked whether, when they retired, respondents would\nwant to stop paid work entirely or continue some paid work.\nTen other variables were included for the analysis of\nconstruct validity, testing the predicted consistency of retire-\nment plans with aspects of the opportunity structure in which\nolder workers are lodged. We can describe these elements\nand discuss their predicted association with retirement plans\nunder three headings: ascribed statuses, work situation, and\nindividual factors. Descriptive statistics for all measures are\nshown in Table 2.\nAmong ascribed statuses, gender is an important context\nfor opportunity. A large and growing body of literature\nprovides a sound basis for gender-based differences in work\nhistories (DeViney and O'Rand, 1988). Women are less\nlikely than men to have had long, uninterrupted work careers\nat the kinds of occupations that reward workers with greater\nTable 1.

Relative to men, women should be\nless likely to see themselves leveraging their occupational\nadvantages into complex paths to retirement. Mindful of\nmarital and family claims on their time, they should also\nhave greater uncertainty about retirement. Race mirrors\ngender in many ways. Past employment discrimination to-\nward non-Whites may, in particular, have steered them into\noccupations that are less likely to be covered by pensions\nthe range of choices, especially the option of early retirement\nwith continued employment. Age, as an index of time,\nshould funnel individuals toward greater certainty about\nretirement and a more realistic appraisal of choices\n(Henretta, 1994). In another sense, older age indexes survi-\nvorship at work and foreclosed chances to enact more com-\nplex plans.\nConsidering the work situation, pension eligibility, other\nthan Social Security, is an important predictor of retirement\nbehavior (Gustman, Mitchell, and Steinmeier, 1994; Quinn,\nBurkhauser, and Myers, 1990), and we expect it to be a\nmajor context for retirement planning, particularly the op-\ntion of complete retirement. First, the pension may promise\nenough income to excuse future employment. Second, pen-\nsion offerings may carry rules that require a complete with-\ndrawal from the labor force. Third, detailed pension rules\nmay also focus workers on the eventuality of retirement, thus\nreducing uncertainty (Ekerdt, Vinick, and Bosse, 1989). A\nbinary indicator of coverage by a private pension (other than\nSocial Security) was derived from HRS items about work-\ners' participation in employer's pension or tax-deferred\nretirement plan, as well as self-employed workers' participa-\ntion in Keogh plans.\nEmployment in the core industrial sector, defined as\noligopolies or monopolies, is an occupational context in\nwhich workers are more likely to have pension coverage and\nsteady work histories, thus encouraging specific plans for\nretirement (Hendricks and McAllister, 1983). The career\npatterns and informal timetables that are strong in core\nindustries also convey expectations about the timing for\nretirement (Henretta, 1994). A binary indicator of core\nemployment for respondents' current occupation was based\non Beck, Horan, and Tolbert's (1978) measure of the dual\neconomy.\nWorkers who have greater control over their circum-\nstances of work, as indexed by occupational prestige, can\ncommand more choices and more rewards than workers in\nlower prestige occupations. Such labor market advantages\nwould increase the conceivability and attainability of post-\ncareer positions, second careers, and partial retirements --\nthe complex paths to retirement (O'Rand, 1986). Current,\nmain occupations were coded for prestige according to\nscores used by the National Opinion Research Center for the\nGeneral Social Survey (Davis and Smith, 1990).\nSelf-employment is an interesting status that, overall,\nwould be less likely to channel workers to a full retirement\n(Quinn, 1980). Self-employment tends to foster personal\ninvestment in the job situation, with a higher cost to individ-\nual identity for a complete withdrawal from work. To con-\nserve that identity, self-employed workers may refuse to\nentertain retirement plans. At the same time, being one's\nown boss should give the self-employed greater ability to\nreduce hours and slip into partial retirement. Self-\nemployment on the main job was incorporated in the analysis\nas a binary variable.\nAmong individual factors, education gives individuals\ngreater market control and hence a wider range of prospec-\ntive choices for retirement (Campbell and Henretta, 1976).\nMore years of education, while associated with pension\ncoverage, are also associated with occupations that have\nnoneconomic rewards -- gratifications that an individual\nmay want to conserve with extended employment arrange-\nments. Education was measured in years of formal school-\ning, coded in the HRS to a maximum of 17 years.\nJust as health limitations prompt retirement behavior, so\nthese circumstances should also focus workers' retirement\nplans away from uncertainty and toward a full retirement or a\nreduction in effort (Hayward and Hardy, 1985). Health was\nmeasured by a binary indicator of work limitations, derived\nfrom a \"yes\" answer regarding any impairment or health\nproblem that limits one's kind or amount of paid work.\nMarital status, finally, should influence individual work-\ners' view of the future. Married couples, for example, tend\nto conceive of retirement as a conjugal project (Vinick and\nEkerdt, 1991), and so married workers should have more\ncertainty about their retirement plans and should also favor\nthe full-retirement option as a greater resource for their time\nin retirement. Marital status was included as a binary indica-\ntor: currently married versus all other groups.\nData Analysis\nThe consistency of the plans categories with analogous\nsurvey questions was examined with cross-classifications.\nThe construct validity of the categories was examined with a\nmultinomial logistic regression technique (Aldrich and Nel-\nson, 1984). The technique generated estimates of the likeli-\nhood of \"membership\" in one category of retirement plans\nversus another category given one's standing or score on an\nindependent variable net of other independent variables. The\n10 independent variables measured aspects of workers' op-\nportunity structure as described above. Nonlinear effects for\nage, occupational prestige, and education were not detected.\nThe results presented here describe contrasts between all\npossible pairs of the plans construct.\nRESULTS\nThe proportion of the sample assigned to each of the\nretirement plans categories is shown in Table 1, along with\nother information about the convergent validity of the plans\nclassification. The plans categories can be understood as\nolder workers' current idea about their next move; we can\nassume that people may have further ideas and that their\ncurrent plans may change.\nAs we have categorized them, approximately one-fifth of\nthese workers aged 51-61 planned to Stop Altogether -- the\nclassic, complete retirement. Another one-fifth foresaw a\npath of Reduced Effort. Nine percent thought that they\nwould remain at work full-time (as best we can determine)\nbut Change Job or switch to self-employment. Approxi-\nmately 7 percent said that they will Never Stop working. An\nunexpected aspect of the plans distribution was the finding\nthat more than two-fifths of these workers had specifically\nstated that they had No Plans regarding retirement.\nCumulative distributions of planned ages for three of\nthese transitions are also shown in Table 1. The Change Job\ngroup planned more moves by age 60 than the Reduce and\nStop groups, consistent with their embarking sooner on a\nmore complex path toward withdrawal from work. In all\nthree groups, approximately 70 percent of transitions were\nforeseen to occur by age 62 or sooner, and over 90 percent\nConvergent Validity of the Plans Categories\nThe validity of the plans categories can be evaluated by\nexamining group responses on three analogous survey ques-\ntions -- each of which in different ways also asks about work\nand retirement expectations (Table 1, Nos. 1-3). The first of\nthese asked about the chances of working full-time (gener-\nally, not just at the present job) after reaching age 62 and\nthen age 65. As would be expected, the Stop group cited the\nlowest chances of working past age 62 or 65, and the Never\nStop group cited the highest chances of continuing full-time.\nThe other three groups fell between these extremes. Separate\none-way analyses of variance with post-hoc contrasts\nshowed that the means of all groups significantly differed\nfrom one another across the past-62 and past-65 rows in\nTable 1, with the exception of the Reduce and Change Job\ngroups. This raises the possibility that these two groups\ncould be collapsed in further analyses, a matter to be ad-\ndressed later.\nAnother survey question (Table 1, No. 2) asked explicitly\nabout expected retirement date or age, with the meaning of\nretirement as full or partial being left to the respondent.\n(Note that the question used to form the plans categories had\nsuggested various work/retirement options that workers\nmight be considering.) As is usual for this type of question\nabout expected retirement age, most respondents gave a\ndate/age, but some had no response or said \"never\" (Nes-\nResponses to the expected-age question are particularly\nhelpful for validating the Stop category. Nearly all workers\nplanning to Stop Altogether cited an expected age for retire-\nment and, cumulatively, 88.6 percent expected to retire by\nage 65. For the Reduce Effort and Change Job groups,\nexpected ages were distributed somewhat later than among\nthe Stop group; approximately 60 percent expected to retire\nby age 65. Such distributions are consistent with these\ngroups' stated plans for continued employment arrange-\nments. Also, some 12-14 percent of these groups said that\nthey expected to work indefinitely (expect \"never\" to re-\ntire). Nonetheless, the majority of workers with present\nplans to Reduce employment or Change Jobs still foresaw\nthemselves as eventually retiring.\nAppropriately, the modal response category for the\nNever Stop group was expecting \"never\" to retire\n(48.2%). Some workers in the Never Stop group did cite a\nretirement age, which possibly signals their expectation of\nan intermediate retirement \"event\" even as they maintain\nthe long-range view that they will work indefinitely,\nwhether at paid or unpaid pursuits. Finally, the No Plans\ngroup has expected-age responses distributed with more\nheterogeneity than other groups.\nThe last item (No. 3) used to validate the plans categories\nwas a question asking workers if they would like to continue\ndoing some paid work when they retire (even though they\nmay elsewhere have said that they would never retire). This\nquestion seems to tap preferences over plans. The Stop\ngroup is most apt to have favored stopping entirely, but a\ngood proportion (38%) nevertheless said that they would like\nto continue some work. Whether they will actually pursue\npostretirement employment is not certain. Over 85 percent\nof the Reduce Effort, Change Job, and Never Stop groups\npreferred continued work. The No Plans group, too, was\nattracted to continued work.\nTo sum up, the comparisons of the plans groups on\nanalogous survey questions show reasonable consistency\nabout intentions toward retirement. Those who plan to Stop\nAltogether project retirement transitions substantially com-\npleted by age 62 and almost wholly completed by age 65;\nthey express little uncertainty about expected retirement\nages; and they are the group most likely by far to prefer no\npostretirement employment. The Reduce Effort and Change\nJob groups resemble each other in foreseeing longer work\ncareers on average than the Stop group, later and even\nindefinite expected retirement dates, and strong favor for\npartial retirement. From the evidence so far, these two\ngroups may differ more in degree than in kind. The Never\nStop group, while some may eventually retire, presently\nforesee the longest work careers and the least likelihood of\never retiring. And as it should be, the No Plans group are\nhardest to profile, projecting longer worker careers than the\nReduce Effort and Change Job groups, but not foreclosing\nretirement so strongly as the Never Stop group.\nPlans and Opportunity\nHaving defined and characterized the groups in terms of\ntheir retirement plans and intentions, we next examine\nwhether plans are associated with selected situational and\nbiographical factors that should, in theory, channel workers\ntoward certain intentions about retirement. A formal theoret-\nical model of the opportunity structure as it predicts specific\nretirement plans would show complex relations among fac-\ntors, with some factors, such as pension eligibility, endoge-\nnous to others. Our present purpose is heuristic and more\nmodest: to explore the construct validity of plans with\nreference to some key elements of the opportunity structure.\nSimple associations between the plans categories, as sepa-\nrate binary indicators, and elements of the opportunity struc-\nture are shown in Table 2 (missing data on some variables\nreduces the pool of cases to 4,746). The correlations are\nshown mainly as a reference for the discussion of multivari-\nate results in Table 3.\nTable 3 shows estimates of the likelihood of workers'\npreference for one plan category over another as predicted by\na set of 10 independent variables. For each independent\nvariable, the matrix of table entries are antilogged logit\ncoefficients that estimate the change in the odds ratio when\nthe predictor variable changes by one unit.

Values greater than 1 reflect\nincreased odds; values less than 1 reflect decreased odds. For\nexample, in the first row of the matrix for the first variable,\nFemale, the value 1.49 indicates that women are more likely\nthan men to have plans to stop altogether (row category) than\nto reduce hours (column category). For the third variable in\nTable 3, Age, the value .92 in the third row specifies how an\nadditional year of age decreases the odds of the change-job\nplan (row category) versus the stop-completely plan (column\ncategory). Interpretations of the entries above the diagonal\nare the inverse of those below the diagonal (because the\nnumerators and denominators of the odds ratios are inverted).\nUnlike our Table 3, results from multinomial logistic\nregression are usually shown as contrasts between a refer-\nence category of the dependent variable and its other catego-\nries. Here we have included all contrasts between plans\ncategories because different contrasts are of interest depend-\ning on the predictor in question. Readers can manage the\ndetail of each matrix by reading rows for sets of coefficients\nof consistent size and direction. Also shown in Table 3 are\nnested likelihood-ratio chi-square tests for the contribution\nof the variable to the model net of the other variables.\nTwo of three ascribed statuses are reasonably predictive of\nretirement plans, and in anticipated ways. Female workers,\nadjusting for other factors in the model, are less likely than\nmales to have plans to Reduce employment or Change Jobs\nrelative to other options, and they are more likely to have No\nPlans. Put another way, men are more likely than women to\nchoose complex plans about retirement and are less apt to be\nfound without plans, suggesting a different preretirement\nprocess for men and women.\nRetirement plans were significantly but not strongly dif-\nferentiated by race. Older age, however, seems to close off\noptions and raise the certainty of plans substantially. Older\nworkers were less likely to plan a job change and less likely\nto have no plans.\nPlans also appear to be formed in the context of the work\nsituation. The expectation of a private pension clearly fo-\ncuses workers' plans. Prospective pensioners are more likely\nto plan a complete retirement and they are less often found\namong those who would never retire or have no plans. In this\nvalidation model, the pension indicator probably obscures\nthe effect of core-sector employment on retirement plans.\nPension receipt tends to accompany employment in large,\nformal organizations (the correlation between these two\nvariables here was .21). In a fully specified analytic model of\ncertain plans categories, pension status would be endoge-\nnous to core employment. Likewise, occupational prestige\nshows a zero-order relationship to certain plans categories\n(Table 2), but no substantial relationship in the multivariate\nsetting (Table 3), probably due to the relationship between\nprestige and education (r = .50).\nSelf-employment is a fairly strong predictor of retirement\nplans and in a way that distinguishes the two complex paths\nto retirement, Reduce Effort and Change Job. Relative to\nother options, the self-employed are more likely to favor\nreduced employment as their next step but unlikely to favor a\njob change. The self-employed tend to say they are headed\nfor partial retirement but in the same job situation.\nThe final three predictors in Table 3 represent individual\ncharacteristics. Education, in a full analytic model of retire-\nment plans, would be exogenous to other factors in the\nopportunity structure. In this simple validation model,\nhigher education somewhat recaps effects observed for male\ngender: greater favor for the complex paths and greater\ncertainty. Respondents with a self-reported work limitation\ndue to health are as likely to entertain one type of plan as\nanother, both in the bivariate and multivariate setting. Per-\nhaps the expected health effect on retirement plans is mani-\nfest only late in the retirement process. Married respondents,\nfinally, favor the option of stopping completely and are less\nlikely to say that they plan never to retire, prospective views\nconsistent with couples' anticipation of retirement as a\nresource for companionship.\nOne remaining question about our five-category construct\n(and our use of the multinomial model) is whether we could\ndo with fewer categories because some are redundant or\nclose alternatives. For example, results in Table 1 suggest\nthat the Reduce Effort and Change Job types might be\ncollapsed together. An important assumption of the multino-\nmial logit model concerns what is often referred to as \"the\nindependence of irrelevant alternatives\" or IIS assumption\n(Zhang and Hoffman, 1993). This assumption, which itself\narises from the assumption that the discrete outcome variable\nis multinomially distributed, essentially assumes that the\nrelative probability of choosing between any two alternative\noutcomes is independent of all the other alternatives. In the\npresent application, for instance, this would mean that the\nrelative probability of choosing \"Stop Altogether\" versus\n\"Never Stop\" is independent of all the other choices.\nMoreover, this difference in relative probabilities would be\nassumed to hold regardless of the number of alternatives\navailable in the choice set. Clearly, such an assumption\ncould not be met if some of the alternatives were close\nsubstitutes for one another. To test the plausibility of this\nassumption in the present study, we estimated the model on a\nrestricted set of choices (constructed by randomly eliminat-\ning various alternatives from the choice set). Parameter\nestimates were virtually identical to those obtained using the\nfull set of outcomes, thereby supporting the viability of the\nIIS assumption.\nDISCUSSION\nIn the foregoing analyses we have sought to demonstrate\nthe validity of a five-category construct that can be used to\ndescribe the retirement intentions of older workers. The five\ngeneral types of retirement plans -- stop altogether, reduce\neffort, change jobs, never retire, and no plans -- were\noperationalized among 51- to 61-year-old workers in the\nbaseline sample of the Health and Retirement Study, from\nwhich source other information was used to demonstrate\nreasonable convergent and construct validity for the catego-\nries. The scheme, we would argue, has heuristic value\nbecause it recognizes the heterogeneity of retirement inten-\ntions, including the refusal to entertain plans (\"never re-\ntire\") and uncertainty about the future.\nAs operationalized here, we sorted workers into mutually\nexclusive groups according to their general plans. This\nstrategy, treating workers as if they were one-plan people set\non singular paths to the future, may be too simple. Rather, a\nworker's commitment to any of the plan scenarios could be a\nmatter of degree. (The HRS items that ask workers their\nsubjective probability of working full-time past age 62 or 65\nare indeed such a test for degree of commitment to a\nparticular, though oddly mixed, intention: nonretirement at a\nparticular age.) Although few HRS respondents cited multi-\nple plans, it is reasonable to suppose that some older men\nand women, while not uncertain about retirement, could\nhave ambivalent intentions or mixed plans.\nAt any rate, whether it is more appropriate to think of\nworkers as planning a single course or as having propensities\ntoward two or three retirement arrangements -- this is a\nmatter for research. The question could be investigated by\nestimating the probability that workers will subscribe to each\nof the plan types based on responses to the sort of questions\nused to establish construct validity in Table 1. Latent vari-\nables describing each worker's propensity to stop altogether,\nreduce effort, etc., could be compared with the single\nmultinomial construct to determine the relative usefulness of\nthe two approaches for summarizing how workers think\nabout retirement.\nOver and above validation research on the construct itself,\nwe foresee three broad applications of the construct for\nstudies of retirement decision making. First, as noted in our\nintroduction, the plans construct can be the organizing idea\nfor an elaborated, though loose, taxonomy of retirement\nplans. Subsidiary to our idea of general plans, one could\nclassify specific plans and expectations regarding employ-\nment, transition timing, financial arrangements, and life\nstyle. Plans themselves, general and specific, could be\nthought of as a subset of the wider experience of retirement\nanticipation (or late careers), which also encompasses retire-\nment preparation behaviors and other attitudes.\nHolding general plans conceptually separate from specific\nplans provides analytic and interpretive advantages. Know-\ning the general intention, for example, enhances the intelli-\ngibility of data on expected timing of retirement. In addition,\nspecific plans for occupational continuity, job change, or\nself-employment are only pertinent to certain general plans.\nSpecific life-style plans (e.g., to conserve one's health, to\nmigrate) may be pertinent only to other general intentions\nsuch as full retirement. The don't-know responses disclosed\nby survey items about probable timing of retirement or\nSocial Security receipt might be usefully regarded not as\nmissing data but as positive indicators of a broad uncertainty\nabout retirement. In all this, we recognize that the hierarchy\nof retirement plans is conceptual; single specific plans (to\nmigrate, to preside over the family business) may in fact\ndrive all other plans for the future.\nThe second application is to studies of extended decision\nmaking for retirement. As outlined in our introduction, it is\nhelpful to think of workers as putting themselves on a path\ntoward retirement or late career transitions -- paths conceiv-\nable because of one's location in a structure of opportunity,\nand paths sustained by instrumental preparation steps. Plans\nmade and remade are the manifest aspect of extended deci-\nsion making and, assuming longitudinal data for the con-\nfirmation of lagged relationships, specific plans can be\nmodeled as the outcome of structure and situation. Who\nentertains plans for complex arrangements (e.g., partial\nretirement), or who characteristically faces the future with\nuncertainty? If plans are unstable, is it because opportunity\nhas changed, or because workers have misinterpreted the\nprobability of favorable events (Frisch, 1988)? Analyses can\nalso consider whether preparation steps solidify intentions,\nwith the \"returns\" on preparation becoming part of the\nopportunity structure for subsequent intentions. One hypoth-\nesis, for example: Workers' resolve to retire all at once\nprompts saving behavior that later reinforces the conceiv-\nability of a full-stop retirement. Our contention, in all, is that\nconsequential decisions about retirement are made far in\nadvance of the event.\nRegarding stability and change, the plans construct could\nalso help chart secular trends in retirement anticipation. The\ncontingent experience with work careers, depending on\ngender. They now face retirement less able than preceding\ncohorts to rely on assumptions about protected career lines\nand about welfare state promises of social security\n(Henretta, 1994). Assuming that this cohort and oncoming\ncohorts face greater uncertainty about the life course, they\nshould come to distribute themselves differently among the\ngeneral intentions toward retirement (e.g., fewer full-stop\nplans and more complex plans).\nThe construct can be applied, thirdly, to the explanation of\nretirement and late career behaviors, using it to depict the\npath of plans over time. The factors that conventionally\npredict retirement outcomes -- gender, pension profile,\nmarital status -- might better be understood as doing so\nbecause they shape the path of retirement intentions. Tempo-\nrally deep intentions, we suspect, are more likely to be\nfulfilled and, we also suspect, more likely to be held by\nsocially and economically advantaged workers (Ekerdt,\nVinick, and Bosse, 1989). People on paths of erratic and\ninchoate plans will arrive at the same outcomes as those with\ndeep plans -- fully retired, extended employment, partial\nretirement -- but possibly quite earlier or later, and with less\nassurance of a satisfying experience with retirement. Our\nperspective is that many workers retire as they do because\nthey have meant to, and those aims can be traced upstream\nfrom events.\nThe focus on retirement plans puts a developmental em-\nphasis on retirement decision making, usefully so because it\nrescues research from casting older workers, on the one\nhand, as point-of-purchase \"deciders\" or, on the other\nhand, as fated by social context. There is now great interest\nin the retirement behavior of the next decades, and we\nsuggest that the decisions about that behavior are already\nbeing made.\n"
