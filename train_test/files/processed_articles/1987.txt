Conclusions There are modifiable health behavior differences between rural and urban\nchildren which may account for the significantly higher obesity rates among rural children.\nKey words nutrition; obesity; public health.\nIntroduction\nPediatric overweight is often cited as the most pressing\nhealth problem among today's children (Robinson, 2008).\nObesity is considered an important pediatric health issue\nbecause child weight status is directly related to adult health\nstatus, independent of adult weight status (Dietz, 1998). In\nother words, if an individual is overweight as a child, even if\nthey lose weight prior to adulthood, being overweight as a\nchild can result in many negative health outcomes such as\ndiabetes, heart disease, orthopedic issues, and sleep diffi-\nculties (Must & Strauss, 1999). Children who are over-\nweight or obese are also likely to remain obese as adults\n(Guo et al., 2000) and have increased rates of psychosocial\nproblems, such as poor quality of life (Zeller, Roehrig, Modi,\nDaniels, & Inge, 2006), poor body image (Israel & Ivanova,\n2002), and social problems (Janssen, Craig, Boyce, &\nPickett, 2004). Recent economic data indicate that\noverweight/obesity costs the U.S. healthcare system over\n$100 billion dollars annually (Overweight and obesity for\nprofessionals: Economic consequences, 2009).\nIn June 2007, the Expert Committee on Pediatric\nObesity changed terminology, such that children with a\nBody Mass Index (BMI) at or between the 85th and 94th\npercentiles are now considered ``overweight,'' and children\nwith a BMI percentile at or above the 95th are now con-\nsidered ``obese'' (Barlow & The Expert Committee, 2007).\nRecent data indicate that prevalence of pediatric overweight\nand obesity continue to rise both in the United States and\naround the world (World Health Organization Obesity and\nThere are certain groups of children who are more\nlikely to have difficulties with pediatric overweight, includ-\ning African American teenage girls, Hispanic teenage boys,\nand children whose parents are obese (Winkleby,\nJournal of Pediatric Psychology vol. 36 no. 6 \u00df The Author 2011.

Some data also\nindicate that living in a rural community increases one's\nrisk of overweight or obesity. For example, Davy Harrell,\nStewart, & King (2004) conducted a study of body weight\nstatus, dietary habits, and physical activity levels among\nmiddle-school children in rural Mississippi (Davy et al.,\nover the 85th percentile, they consumed 34% of their cal-\nories from fat (30% or fewer are recommended), and en-\nmore steps are recommended). Unfortunately, no matched\nurban group was included making comparison between\nurban and rural children difficult. In a similar study with\n54 Appalachian Kentucky elementary school children, an-\nother group found that 33% of rural children had a BMI\nover the 85th percentile, they consumed 36% of their cal-\nories from fat and engaged in over 3 hr of screen time (TV/\nvideo/computer play) on average per day (Crooks, 2000). It\nis problematic to draw conclusions from such a small\nsample from a single rural region. However, similar results\nhave been found for African American children from rural\nSouth Carolina (Felton et al., 1998), and for fourth grade\nchildren from rural central Iowa (Gustafson-Larson &\nTerry, 1992). Although these studies are consistent, they\nlack a nationally representative sample of urban and rural\nchildren obtained simultaneously which would allow for\nassessment of the relationship between overweight/obesity,\nhealth behaviors and rural/urban status. Such national\nstudies have been conducted with adults and consistently\nindicate that overweight (Jackson, Doescher, Jerant, &\nand overweight-related health behaviors (i.e., excess calo-\nries, decreased physical activity; Martin et al., 2005) are\nmore common among rural adults than urban adults.\nRural Healthy People 2010 suggests that there may be\n``cultural'' and ``structural'' limitations specific to rural\nareas that may impact the prevalence of overweight/obesity\n(Tai-Seale & Chandler, 2003). ``Cultural'' tendencies im-\nplicated include higher dietary fat and calorie consumption\nin rural areas, lower rates of exercise, higher rates of screen\ntime (TV, video, and computer play), and lack of adequate\nhealth education. The ``structural'' causes include lack of\nnutrition education, poor access to nutritionists, limited\nresources, and fewer outlets for exercise. Demographic fac-\ntors also play a role. Rural individuals are typically poorer\nand have less education than their urban counterparts, two\nfactors that have been shown to be positively associated\nwith higher rates of overweight.\nDespite these compelling data, to date, there have\nbeen no national studies of the rates of pediatric over-\nweight/obesity and related health behaviors with rural\nand urban children. The objective of the current study\nwas to assess overweight/obesity and overweight/\nobesity-related health behaviors among rural and urban\nchildren using data from the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). NHANES is a\nnational survey conducted biannually to provide a snap-\nshot of the health and nutrition of the U.S. population. As\nsuch, it is an ideal source of data given the objective of the\ncurrent study. Based upon previous data, we hypothesize\nthat children in rural areas will have higher rates of over-\nweight and obesity, will have different dietary composition,\nand will have lower rates of physical activity when com-\npared with urban children.\nMethods\nof the general U.S. population conducted by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics within the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention. NHANES participants undergo a\nsurvey as well as a medical examination that includes blood\nwork and measured height and weight. Responses to ques-\ntions were obtained directly from those aged 16 years or\nolder; all others were obtained from the parent or guardian.\nWe used two cycles of NHANES data to ensure ade-\nquate sample sizes for analysis, for a total of 7,882 partic-\nipants aged 2\u00ad18 years. We then used the weights, strata,\nand primary sampling units provided by the NHANES data\nto weigh the data to provide representative estimates of the\nU.S. population at large, resulting in a weighted sample\nVariable Definitions\nOverweight/Obesity\nThe main variable of interest, weight status, was defined\naccording to the CDCs age- and gender-specific percentile\nranks for BMI. Three measures were used in this analysis;\noverweight was defined as an age and gender BMI equal to or\ngreater than the 85th and below the 95th percentile; obese\nwas defined as an age and gender specific BMI equal to or\nabove the 95th percentile; overweight/obese was defined as\nan age and gender BMI greater than the 85th percentile.\nResidence\nEach participant's county of residence's rural status was\nclassified according to its urban influence code (UIC), es-\ntablished by the USDA (Economic Research Service). These\ncodes are drawn from the 2005 Area Resource file, which\nmaintains information regarding the characteristics of the\n3,142 counties in the United States (DHHS, Area\n670 Davis, Bennett, Befort, and Nollen\ncounty was coded as Urban while all other UIC codes (3\u00ad\n12--known as ``nonmetropolitan codes'' by the USDA\nEconomic Research Service) were classified as Rural (Liu,\nPhysical Activity\nThe CDC recommends that children and adolescents aged\n6\u00ad17 years should participate in at least 60 min of activity\nper day, and vigorous activity several days per week\n(Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2009). The\nNHANES questions are not structured, however, to deter-\nmine if the participants met these recommendations.\nTherefore, for children aged 2\u00ad11 years, we classified\nthose who answered the question ``How many times per\nweek does ____ play or exercise enough to make {him/\nher} sweat and breathe hard?'' as three or more times to be\nin compliance with the recommendations. For those aged\n12\u00ad18 years old, we utilized the Physical Activity\nIndividual Activities data file. This survey component\nasked participants to choose from a list of activities those\nthey participate in on a regular basis, the number of times\nthey performed the activity during the past 30 days, and\nthe average number of minutes each activity is performed\nper session. These responses were summed by participant\nand averaged over the 30 day period to obtain an estimate\nof daily activity level. Those who averaged 60 min of activity\nper day, based upon these responses, were classified as\nmeeting the physical activity recommendations.\nDietary intake\nDietary intake was defined using the mean estimated daily\nintake in seven categories; fruits/vegetables, sugar-\nsweetened beverages, milk products, fried foods, meat,\nadded fats, and desserts/sweets. Parents were asked to\nreport the number of items consumed in a typical day by\ntheir child. These answers were then aggregated and esti-\nmated daily frequencies were computed.\nSocioeconomic status\nSocioeconomic status was defined using the federal poverty\nlevel percentage, grouped by each NHANES year's tertile,\nto provide low-, middle-, and high-socioeconomic status\ndesignations.\nElectronic entertainment\nElectronic entertainment was defined as more than 2 hr\nspent, per day, watching television, using computers, or\nplaying video games for entertainment purposes. Other\nvariables utilized in the analysis included age, race,\ngender, and the presence of any physical limitations that\nwould affect activity levels.\nAnalytic Plan\nThe proportion of participants who were overweight/obese\nwas calculated, subset by the variables detailed above.\nThese proportions were further subset by residence (rural\nvs. urban), with differences tested using chi-squared. The\nbivariate analyses indicated potential interactions between\nrace, gender, and age, which were included in the multi-\nvariate logistic models. The multivariate logistic models\nused obesity status as the dependent variable, while con-\nsocioeconomic status, physical activity, dietary intake, use\nof electronic entertainment, and physical activity limita-\ntions. We conducted two sets of multivariable logistic re-\ngression models to determine the factors related to obesity\namong rural and urban populations. The initial models\nutilized a dichotomous obesity indicator variable for the\ndependent variable, and included all of the above intend-\nment variables. This model was performed on two subpop-\nulations; rural only and urban only. The final models were\nalso subset to the two subpopulations (rural only and\nurban only), and only included those independent vari-\nables that that were significant in the full model at\np < .10. All analyses were conducted using SAS-Callable\nSUDAAN (Proc Crosstab, Proc Descript, and Proc\nMultilog) to take into account the complex sampling struc-\nture of the NHANES data.\nResults\nA total of 7,882 unweighted subjects in this analysis rep-\nresented more than 138 million weighted, nationally rep-\nresentative individuals. Overall, nearly 16% lived in rural\nareas, and the sample was predominately White (See\nTable I for demographic information). Rural residents dif-\nfered significantly from urban residents on most key demo-\ngraphic characteristics (gender, race, age, and SES; see\nTable I).\nThe unadjusted analyses indicate that overall, 33.1%\nof the sample was overweight/obese; 15.4% were over-\nweight while 17.7% were obese (see Table II). Breaking\nthe sample down by rural/urban status, 39.0% of the\nrural children were over the 85th percentile, whereas\n32.0% of the urban children were over the 85th percentile.\nThis difference did not reach statistical significance.\nLooking at categories of overweight versus obese, signifi-\ncantly more rural children were obese (21.8%) compared\nto urban children (16.9%). Other factors significantly as-\nsociated with weight status included gender, race, age, and\nsocioeconomic status.\nRural Urban Childhood Obesity Behaviors 671\nAnalyses were then conducted to learn more about\nspecific health behavior differences that may be associated\nwith weight status for rural and urban children. For these\nanalyses, initial modeling revealed healthy and overweight\n(not obese) children had no differences between rural and\nurban areas regarding specific health behaviors, so those\ngroups were collapsed and the groups analyzed were:\n(a) obese versus and (b) healthy weight and overweight\n(groups collapsed). Activity variables (Table III) included\nmeeting physical activity guidelines and more than 2 hr/day\nusing electronic entertainment were not significantly differ-\nent between rural and urban children. When these were\nbroken down by obese (BMI > 95th) versus nonobese,\nhowever, we found that significantly more nonobese chil-\ndren met physical activity guidelines as compared to obese\nuse of electronic entertainment, in that significantly more\nobese children used electronic entertainment for more than\n2 hr/day as compared to non-obese children, both in urban\nareas.\nRegarding dietary variables, there were no urban\u00adrural\ndifferences in mean intakes of any of the dietary intake\ncategories (Table III). Overall, both urban and rural obese\nchildren were more likely to drink more sugar-sweetened\nbeverages. Urban obese children consumed more meat and\ndesserts on a daily basis than nonobese urban children,\nand among urban children obese were less likely to con-\nsume sweets than nonobese.\nThe multivariate analysis showed, after controlling for\nthe independent variables, few factors remained significant\npredictors of obesity, and that the factors differed for rural\nchildren compared to urban children (See Table IV).\nAmong rural children, the significant factors related to obe-\nsity included race (African American children were more\nlikely to be overweight than White children), meeting phys-\nical activity recommendations [Odds Ratio (OR) \u00bc 0.70,\nAmong urban children, the factors significantly related to\nobesity included race (again, with African American chil-\ndren were more likely to be obese than White children),\nage (children less than 10 years old were less likely to be\nobese), socioeconomic status (those in families with\nmiddle incomes were more likely to be obese than those\nwith high incomes), and dietary intake (more average daily\nconsumption of meat and sugar-sweetened beverages was\nassociated with being obese).\nConclusions\nThis study sought to examine the rate of overweight and\nobesity among rural and urban children, and to determine\nwhich specific health behaviors contributed to any existing\ndifferences. We found that rural children were significantly\nTable II.

In terms of treatment options, this\nfinding is especially problematic, given that so many rural\nareas are designated as healthcare provider shortage areas\nas well (Health Resources Services Administration, n.d.). If\nthere are more children in rural areas in need of treatment,\nhow are we to get empirically supported programs out\nto them? There have been some novel uses of technology\nsuch as interactive televideo (Davis et al., 2011) and other\noutreach programs (Janicke et al., 2010) that may be\nhelpful, but this is definitely an area in need of further\nattention.\nFew of the major health behaviors that were measured\nin the study demonstrated any significant differences be-\ntween rural and urban children that would account for the\ndifferential obesity rates. The two groups of children had\nsimilar rates of meeting physical activity recommendations,\nsimilar rates of electronic entertainment use, and similar\nrates of consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. It is\nimportant to note, however, that there are more methodo-\nlogically rigorous assessment methods available (i.e., phys-\nical activity monitors, 24 hr dietary recalls) that may be\nmore sensitive than the self-report measures used by\nNHANES. Other studies utilizing these rigorous\nassessment methods among smaller samples have found\nhealth behavior differences among urban and rural children\nThe current data do show that there are health behav-\nior differences between obese and nonobese children in the\nexpected direction. For example, nonobese children were\nsignificantly more likely to meet physical activity guide-\nlines, and significantly less likely to engage in more than\n2 hr of electronic entertainment. Regarding dietary vari-\nables, obese children consumed significantly more\nsugar-sweetened beverages than nonobese children. Like\nadult findings (Davies et al., 2000), our data do indicate\nthat drinking milk had a protective effect, but this only\nreached statistical significance for rural children, possibly\ndue to their slightly higher milk consumption.\nOne surprising finding was that urban children who\nwere not obese consumed significantly more sweets than\nurban children who were obese. Interestingly, this same\npattern of higher sweets consumption among the nonobese\nwas observed for rural children as well, but did not reach\nstatistical significance. Looking at the methodology for the\nNHANES survey, dietary information is based upon parent\nreport. There is some literature to suggest that weight\nstatus of underreporters is significantly higher than that\nof plausible reporters (Ventura, Loken, Mitchell,\nSmickilas-Wright, & Birch, 2006) suggesting that our re-\nsults could be due to underreporting. Further research is\nneeded to clarify this issue.\nThe multivariate models showed that for rural children\nobesity was highly related to race (African American), not\nTable III.

This indi-\ncates that among rural children activity and the lack thereof\nmay be key in combating obesity in children. However,\namong urban children, obesity was related to race\n(African American), age (children less than 10 years of\nage were less likely to be overweight/obese), socioeconomic\nstatus (high-income children were less likely to be over-\nweight/obese), and higher dietary intake (specifically re-\ngarding meats and sugar-sweetened beverages). Therefore,\namong urban children physical activity and sedentary ac-\ntivity variables may be less important shifting the focus to\ndietary interventions possibly focusing on meats and\nsugar-sweetened beverages.\nThis study is an improvement over previous studies\nbecause we used NHANES data, which provides a nation-\nally representative sample of rural and urban children.\nAlso, NHANES physically measures a child's height and\nweight to calculate BMI; other studies have used data\nsets that depended upon parental report for height and\nweight (Tai-Seale & Chandler, 2003). The results, however,\nare similar enough to lend credence to the previous work,\nand to bolster the evidence of a rural difference in obesity\nprevalence among children.\nOur study has several limitations. Although we pooled\ntwo waves of NHANES data, we were still limited by rela-\ntively small rural sample sizes that reduced our ability to\ndetect significant differences among groups and factors.\nAlso, many of the health behaviors (such as physical activ-\nity data) depended upon respondent recall and estimation,\nand are subject to recall bias. We chose to use the frequen-\ncy measures of dietary intake rather than dietary recall in-\nformation, despite it being present for a majority of the\nchildren in the sample, due to the nature in which the\nrecall data were collected. For those aged 6 years and\nunder, a proxy (usually a parent or guardian) recalled the\nTable IV.

Finally, combining\nthe physical activity data for children aged 2\u00ad11 years of\nage with the data for children aged 12\u00ad18 years despite the\ndifferent methodology used with each age group is a\nlimitation.\nThe current study provides evidence that rural chil-\ndren and adolescents are at higher risk for obesity than\ntheir urban counterparts. The results also demonstrate\nthat it is not living in a rural area in and of itself that\nleads to this increased prevalence. Rather, the factors that\ndiffer between urban and rural residents, such as socioeco-\nnomic status, and prevalence of physical limitations, con-\ntribute significantly to the weight differences. These\nfindings support the notion that interventions aimed at\nimproving these factors are needed in rural areas to\ncombat the significantly higher rates of pediatric obesity.\nThe current study also raises several areas in need of\nfurther study. First, our study did not find any significant\nhealth behavior differences between rural and urban chil-\ndren. Using stronger methodology (such as three 24-hr\ndietary recalls, 7-day activity monitor counts) and a more\nappropriately powered sample, may allow the sensitivity\nand statistical power to detect any differences that exist.\nSecond, the finding that drinking milk had a protective\neffect, but only for rural children, bears further study, as\ndoes the finding that urban children who were not obese\nconsumed more sweets than urban children who were\nobese. Finally, our multivariate findings that physical activ-\nity variables may be more important for rural children and\ndietary variables may be more important for urban children\nhave direct implications for the development of treatment\ninterventions targeting pediatric obesity among rural and\nurban children.\n"
