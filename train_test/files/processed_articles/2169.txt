    "reduced_content": "Care Under Federal Laws\nand state prisons--a 21 percent increase from the number of prisoners\nreleased in 2000. Poor health and poor health coverage have been major\nchallenges for former prisoners trying to reintegrate into the community\nand find work. We discuss these challenges and the likely effect of recent\nfederal legislation, including the Second Chance Act, the Mental Health\nParity and Addiction Equity Act, and the Affordable Care Act. We\nestimated that with the implementation of health reform, up to\n2009--could enroll in Medicaid. Similarly, we estimated that up to\n2009--could be eligible for federal tax credits to defray the cost of\npurchasing insurance from state health exchanges. This health insurance,\ncombined with new substance abuse services and patient-centered medical\nhome models, could dramatically improve the health and success of\nformer inmates as they return to the community. States should consider\nseveral policy changes to ease prisoners' transitions, including\nsuspending rather than terminating Medicaid benefits for offenders;\nincorporating corrections information into eligibility determination\nsystems; aiming Medicaid outreach and enrollment efforts at prison\ninmates; and designing comprehensive approaches to meeting former\nprisoners' health care needs.\nHealth care planners and reform-\ners should take note: A large\nchange has occurred in US pris-\nons. The number of prisoners in\ninmates are in local jails at any one time;2 most\npeople in jail have received sentences of a year or\nless, while most people in prison are serving\nlonger sentences.

In general, men of working age have high\nrates of uninsurance. The health status and\nconstrained employment prospects that often\ncharacterize offenders after release further\ncomplicate their prospects of obtaining health\ninsurance.\nAddressing health insurance access for offend-\ners returning to the community is a priority be-\ncause of their high rates of chronic conditions\nand infectious disease. In addition, research has\nfound that having health insurance after release\nmay be associated with lower rates of rearrest\nand drug use,9 making the issue relevant not\nonly to health officials but also to correctional\nofficials.\nIt should be noted that the impact of former\nprisoners' reentry into society will not be felt\nequally across states. States differ markedly both\nin the percentage of their population in prison\nand in how that percentage is changing. In 2009\nCalifornia had the greatest net decline in state\nprison population in the country--with 4,300\nfewer prisoners than in 2008--followed by Mich-\nigan, New York, Maryland, Texas, and Missis-\nsippi.10 In twenty-four other states the state\nprison population grew in 2009, including gains\nof 5 percent or more in Vermont, West Virginia,\nand Indiana.\nThese changes reflect state policies about ad-\nmission and release, including parole violation\nrules, changes in sentence length and probation\nterms, diversion programs (that is, alternatives\nto usual criminal justice processing such as drug\ntreatment or restitution for eligible offenders)\nand reentry planning, and court orders regard-\ning prison overcrowding.\nUnlike the number of state prisoners, the\nnumber of federal prisoners did not decline in\n2009. This reality probably reflects stricter sen-\ntencing provisions, more restrictive probation\nand parole policies, and fewer diversion oppor-\ntunities in the federal system, compared to state\nsystems. This paper provides an overview of\nhealth insurance and the challenges in securing\ncoverage for offenders returning to the commu-\nnity. It then addresses the effects of legislation\npassed since 2006. We provide estimates of the\nAffordable Care Act's likely effects on offenders\nreentering the community.\nFormer Inmates' Access To Health\nInsurance\nObtaining health insurance can present a\nchallenge for former inmates. On reentering\nthe community, they may need time to find\nhousing and jobs. If the work they get is\npart time, temporary, or low-paying, employer-\nbased health coverage may not be available or\naffordable.\nMedicaid is another important source of\nhealth insurance coverage. In forty states, dis-\nabled individuals who receive Supplemental\nSecurity Income also receive Medicaid. In eight\nstates, poor childless adults are eligible for\nMedicaid or Medicaid-like programs even if they\ndo not qualify for Supplemental Security In-\ncome.11 Medicaid covers extensive mental health\nservices and services--such as intensive case\nmanagement, rehabilitation, and support ser-\nvices. However, coverage for substance abuse\ntreatment is frequently limited in amount and\nby type of provider.11\nMedicaid enrollment and renewal procedures\nimpose documentation requirements that seem\nalmost insurmountable for some former in-\nmates. Some inmates who had Medicaid cover-\nage before incarceration may miss renewal re-\nquirements during their prison term. Others\nwill no longer have the necessary identification\nto enroll because identification documents may\nhave expired or been lost.\nSupplemental Security Income Specific\nrules about Supplemental Security Income and\ninmates pose additional challenges. First, a per-\nson who is in jail or a halfway house under the\nauspices of a department of corrections is not\neligible for these benefits.\nSecond, the Social Security Administration re-\nquires people with outstanding felony arrest\nwarrants to respond to those warrants before\napplying for or resuming Supplemental Security\nIncome benefits. This causes particular difficul-\nties for people who are homeless. Many of them\nhave been arrested for minor charges such as\ntrespassing and loitering, have failed to appear\nfor hearings, and as a result had \"bench\nwarrants\"--often classified as felony warrants--\nissued for their arrest.12 Recently, however, the\nEx-Prisoners' Care\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Incar-\nceration for less than a year leads to a \"suspen-\nsion\" rather than a \"termination\" of benefits.\nUnder Medicaid administrative rules, states\ncan follow the rules of the Social Security\nAdministration with respect to Supplemental\nSecurity Income and suspend Medicaid benefits\nas well. Payments for someone whose benefits\nwere suspended should resume soon after he or\nshe is released, as long as the Social Security\nAdministration is informed of the release and\nthe person submits a relatively simple form with\nevidence showing that he or she again meets the\nincome requirements.15\nDisability Status People who are incarcer-\nated for longer than a year and had their benefits\nterminated must reestablish the existence of\ntheir disability and eligibility for Supplemental\nSecurity Income. Once Supplemental Security\nIncome eligibility is established, Medicaid\nfollows.\nDisabling conditions may emerge or become\nexacerbated during incarceration. In such cases,\ninmates who were not eligible for Supplemental\nSecurity Income when they entered prison may\nseek those benefits on release. Supplemental\nSecurity Income applications can take three\nmonths to complete, but special rules apply to\npeople with severementalillness whocanmake a\ncase for financial emergency.15 Seeking Supple-\nmental SecurityIncome benefits for thefirst time\nincludes providing extensive documentation of a\nqualifying disabling condition. On release, for-\nmer prisoners may need to access their prison\nmedical records to successfully make their dis-\nability case. Obtaining such access can cause de-\nlays in the application process for Supplemental\nSecurity Income as well as Medicaid.\nRecent Federal Legislation\nThree federal laws passed since 2006 are particu-\nlarly relevant to offenders returning to the com-\nmunity and seeking health insurance coverage.\nThey are the Second Chance Act of 2007, the\nMental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act\nSecond Chance Act UndertheSecond Chance\nAct, state, local, and community organizations\ngovernment to make former inmates' reintegra-\ntion into the community after jail or prison more\nsuccessful. These funds also gave the states\nan opportunity to examine barriers--statutory,\nregulatory, or practical--to delivering health\ncare to former inmates, including lack of health\ninsurance. In doing so, communities can ad-\ndress, for example, any misalignments between\nstate and local Medicaid procedures that might\naffect how people enroll.16\nThe Second Chance Act also promotes the use\nof community-based correctional facilities--\nmany of which are private, residential facilities\nwhere prisoners can begin to seek employment\nand obtain needed treatment services, giving\nthem an opportunity to adapt to local conditions\nbefore being formally released. However, if these\ncommunity facilities are considered to be under\nthe control of a department of corrections, their\nuse could make residents ineligible for Medicaid\ncoverage, as noted above. Community-based cor-\nrectional facilities also include nonresidential\n\"day reporting\" centers where prisoners are re-\nquired to meet with case managers.With federal\nplanning support, states can revisit how these\ncommunity alternatives are used to improve\nreentry, increase former inmates' employment\nopportunities and access to health care services,\nand maximize their possibility of Medicaid\neligibility.\nMental Health Parity The Mental Health\nParity and Addiction Equity Act addresses the\ncoverage of mental health and substance abuse\nbenefits in large-group health insurance plans.\nThe law does not require plans to offer mental\nhealth benefits. However, if plans do offer men-\ntal health and substance use disorder benefits,\nthese benefits must be on an equivalent basis\nwith medical and surgical benefits. For example,\nboth types of coverage must have equivalent co-\npayments and deductibles, maximum number of\nvisits, annual and lifetime dollar limits, and out-\nof-network coverage.\nDisabling conditions\nmay emerge or\nbecome exacerbated\nduring incarceration.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The law re-\nmoves major financial barriers to access for peo-\nple who need mental health or addiction treat-\nment. In the light of high rates of mental health\nand substance abuse disorder among offenders,\nthis is potentially very important to former\ninmates.\nAffordable Care Act Offenders returning to\nthe community will be affected by the Affordable\nCare Act in several ways: through mandates to\nobtain health insurance; through the existence\nof insurance exchanges in which low-income\npeople will be able to receive federal tax credits\nto reduce the cost of purchasing mandatory cov-\nerage; and through the expansion of Medicaid.\nMedicaid expansion is particularly important\nfor prisoners, who are disproportionately low-\nincome men. Medicaid will become the primary\nsource of health insurance for most people\nwhose income is below 138 percent of the federal\npoverty level (133 percent plus 5 percent that the\nAffordable Care Act requires states to disregard\nwhen they calculate eligibility), especially child-\nless adults. In addition, states will receive a\nhigher federal matching payment for the popu-\nlation that will become newly eligible for Medic-\naid. This enhanced match could provide finan-\ncial support to bolster a delivery system that is\ncurrently fragmented and fraught with access\nproblems. States may also expand Medicaid to\nchildless adults before 2014, but at regular\nfederal match rates.\nThere are no published estimates of the impact\nthat the Affordable Care Act is likely to have on\npeople released from prison, either through\nMedicaid or private insurance coverage. In this\narticle we present an analysis that attempts the\nfirst such estimates.\nStudy Data And Methods\nWe began with the number of released prisoners\nas reported by the federal government.2 Then we\nestimated the proportion of those former in-\nmates who would be eligible for Medicaid--those\nwhose annual income was below 138 percent of\nthe federal poverty level, as explained above.\nWe also estimated the proportion of released\nprisoners eligible for federal tax credits to pur-\nchase private health insurance policies through\ninsurance exchanges--those with annual in-\ncomes below 400 percent of the federal poverty\nlevel. We did not model how employer coverage\nor premiums might change. First, using data\nfrom the 2004 Survey of Inmates in Federal\nof Inmates in State Correctional Facilities,18 we\nidentified inmates who had indicated that they\nexpected to be released within the following\ntwelve months. Fewer than 1 percent of inmates\nwho anticipated release were over age sixty-five.\nWe excluded these older inmates from our\nsample.\nWe then estimated the annual income of the\nprisoners expecting to be released. Although the\nsurveys asked inmates about their monthly in-\ncome prior to arrest, their responses may suffer\nfrom recall bias. Instead of using those survey\nresponses, we assigned each inmate the average\nincome for people with identical age, sex, race,\nand education level according to the 2009 Cur-\nrent Population Survey.19\nWe considered reducing this assigned income\nbecause having been an inmate may impose a\n\"wage penalty\" on former prisoners, lowering\ntheir wages. Such a wage penalty could occur\nbecause prisoners did not gain work experience\nor lost skills during their incarceration. In the\ncase of younger offenders, they may not have\naccumulated work skills prior to being incarcer-\nated. The wage penalty could also arise because\nof the stigma attached to former inmates in the\nlabor market or because offenders represent a\nsubset of the population with fewer work skills,\nafter controlling for education.\nThe evidence is mixed on whether former pris-\noners suffer a wage penalty when they return to\nthe workforce. Several studies found that con-\nviction has relatively small effects on the wages\nof released prisoners.20\u00ad22 However, one study\nfound that people who had been convicted were\nless likely to be employed than those who had\nnot, and that convicted people who were em-\nployed earned lower wages than people who\nhad not been convicted.23 And other studies\nfound large effects on income, with decreases\nof 10\u00ad25 percent for those who served jail or\nprison terms.22 Another study found that length\nof incarceration had no effect on medium-term\nemployment and earnings and had a positive\nThe evidence is mixed\non whether former\nprisoners suffer a\nwage penalty when\nthey return to the\nworkforce.\nEx-Prisoners' Care\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Because the prisoner survey does not ask\nabout length of residency, we used the Current\nPopulation Survey19 to estimate the proportion\nof low-income male inmates who had been in the\nUnited States for less than five years. We esti-\nmated that 7 percent of released prisoners would\nnot qualify for Medicaid on this basis.\nStudy Results\nThe estimated mean income for our sample was\nfederal prisoners expecting to be released in\nthe coming year, assuming no wage penalty\n(data not shown).

Increasing the\n\"take-up\" in Medicaid--the enrollment of indi-\nviduals who meet eligibility requirements--has\nbeen a persistent challenge.

Tax credits for coverage purchased\nthrough an exchange will be available to people\nwith incomes below 400 percent of the federal\npoverty level. People who have coverage through\ntheir employer generally will not be eligible for\ntax credits, unless the premium exceeds 9.5 per-\ncent of income.

However, most of them would be\neligible for Medicaid, unless they could not meet\nresidency requirements.\nChallenges And Opportunities\nMedicaid is important to health care access for\noffenders today, and it will become increasingly\nimportant with the continuing implementation\nof health care reform. The expansionof Medicaid\nunder the Affordable Care Act will have a pro-\nfound impact on nondisabled adults, particu-\nlarly those who do not live with dependent chil-\ndren, because historically this group has not\nbeen covered under Medicaid.We estimated that\nMedicaid each year after returning to the com-\nmunity (Exhibit 1).\nThis sum is not a large fraction of the new\nenrollees that the Affordable Care Act is expected\nto bring to Medicaid--a number that the\nCongressional Budget Office has pegged at six-\nteen million.26 However, people in this group\nhave high levels of health care need, and their\nsocial situations present complexities with\nwhich health plans may have little experience.\nFor example, they may have relationships to case\nmanagers and treatment providers who are af-\nfiliated with the corrections system, in addition\nto experiencing fragmented social and family\nnetworks and high mental health and substance\nuse treatment needs.\nProviding insurance coverage is only one step\ntoward improving the health of former prisoners\nand, ultimately, improving their income and\nemployment prospects. Former prisoners have\ntraditionally relied on a web of safety-net\nproviders to meet their complex needs. Several\nprovisions in the Affordable Care Act promote\nnew models of care delivery, including patient-\ncentered medical homes and health homes for\npeople with chronic conditions. These models\nhave enormous potential.\nTo serve former prisoners adequately, medical\nhomes will need to have strong ties to mental\nhealth and substance abuse treatment providers.\nMental health treatment could help stabilize for-\nmer prisoners' reintegration into their families\nand the job market, while substance abuse treat-\nment could reduce their risk of committing new\noffenses. Ideally, these medical homes will coor-\ndinate with corrections and probation officers to\nhelp former prisoners with benefit enrollment,\ncontinuity of treatment from prison to commu-\nnity, and understanding probation terms and\ncourt orders.\nIn addition to expanding coverage, the Afford-\nable Care Act contains provisions to simplify\nenrollment in health insurance. For example,\nMedicaid eligibility for newly eligible adults will\nnot involve an asset test.However, asset tests will\ncontinue to apply to adults who receive Supple-\nmental Security Income and seek Medicaid. A\nrelatively small percentage of prisoners is likely\nto be affected by those tests. The prison inmate\nsurveys found that fewer than 5 percent of in-\nmates reported receiving disability benefits in\nthe month prior to arrest, although others may\nbecome disabled during their incarceration.\nThe Affordable Care Act also requires states to\nstreamline and coordinate enrollment between\nMedicaid and the health insurance exchanges. If\nan applicant applies for coverage through an\nexchange but is eligible for Medicaid, he or\nshe should be enrolled in Medicaid. Federal as-\nsistance is also available to help states design and\nimplement the necessary enrollment technol-\nogy. These efforts should increase health insur-\nance enrollment and reduce churning--the mov-\ning of people in and out of insurance coverage.\nConclusion\nNew policies in several areas are worth consid-\nering. First, states should consider suspending\nrather than terminating Medicaid benefits for\noffenders, if their current data systems permit.\nOtherwise, this functionality could be added as\nstates adapt enrollment procedures and data sys-\ntems in anticipation of the health exchanges and\nMedicaid expansions.\nSecond, where possible, corrections data\nshould be incorporated into eligibility determi-\nnation systems. Eligibility is determined based\non vital statistics and employment and income.\nThus, correctional data can provide important\ninformation to determine former inmates' eli-\ngibility. Alternatively, corrections staff could\nprovide key documents to inmates, including\nincarceration dates, to make it easier for former\nprisoners to obtain identification and provide\nProviding insurance\ncoverage is only one\nstep toward improving\nthe health of former\nprisoners.\nEx-Prisoners' Care\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

For exam-\nple, entities within a local department of correc-\ntions could be given access to Medicaid enroll-\nment and eligibility data systems. Similar\nprocedures already exist in some state juvenile\nFourth, to hasten inmates' access to services\nafter being released from prison, providers who\ntreat the offender population in the community\ncould be identified as \"qualified entities\" under\nMedicaid. As qualified entities, service providers\ncan determine if a person is temporarily eligible\nfor Medicaid, pending a final eligibility determi-\nnation.\nFinally, states can involve representatives of\nthe corrections, probation, and parole systems\nin designing a comprehensive approach to meet-\ning the health care needs of former prisoners.\nStates could also include the representatives in\ntraining programs for new enrollment and eli-\ngibility systems.\nStates face the practical challenges of expand-\ning health insurance coverage and orchestrating\nthe reentry into their communities of more than\nsteps now to smooth these inmates' transitions\nwill hasten their enrollment in health plans and\nremove financial barriers to their treatment. Fur-\nthermore, promoting patient-centered medical\nhomes that can address returning offenders'\ncomplex health and behavioral health needs\ncould be beneficial to both public health and\npublic safety. \nThis work was completed with partial\nsupport from the US Department of\nJustice's Bureau of Justice Assistance\nand the John D. and Catherine T.\nMacArthur Foundation.\nNOTES\n1 Beck AJ, Gilliard DK.
