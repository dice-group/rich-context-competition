Mexico is the fifth largest country in the\nAmericas with a population over 120 million, and a life\nexpectancy of 80 years for women and 75 for men; almost\nOverall, developing countries currently carry 58% of the\nworld's dementia burden and this is projected to rise to\nand older, when compared to other countries in the Latin\nAmerican region (3), and is estimated to affect 6\u00c18% of\nthose aged 60 years (4, 5). Dementia, which includes\nAlzheimer's disease, Lewy body and frontotemporal\ndementias, and vascular dementia, results from a number\nof pathological processes and is preceded by changes in\ncognition that differ from the normal ageing process.\nMild changes in cognition can manifest as delays in\nmemory and impairments in complex activities of daily\nliving (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living\n(IADLs) (6, 7). More significant cognitive impairment\nwould be characterised by considerable disability and\nneuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression and\nanxiety (8), often resulting in high caregiving needs (9).\nGlobal Health Action \u00e6\nGlobal Health Action 2016. # 2016 Jenny Miu et al.

In Mexican populations, reported\nrisk factors for mild impairments in cognition include\nolder age, sex, education, depression, heart disease, and\ndiabetes (10, 11). As ageing populations are growing\nworldwide, groups at highest risk for cognitive decline,\nparticularly those from low- and middle-income countries,\ncan be targeted as part of wider efforts to reduce the\nprevalence of dementia and its burden on society and\nhealthcare systems. This paper examined risk factors for\ncognitive impairment amongst a sample of adults aged\n50 years and older in a population-based study in Mexico.\nMethods\nPopulation and sample\nThe sample of respondents aged 50' years from the\nWorld Health Organization's Study on global AGEing\n2010) was used for this study. SAGE is a longitudinal\nstudy of health and well-being in adults from six low- and\nmiddle-income countries, including Mexico. Stratified\nmultistage clustered sampling (1) was used to generate a\nfinal sample of 2,756 respondents in Mexico. The study\ndesign included samples of follow-up respondents from\nSAGE Wave 0, a baseline cohort created during the\nProxy respondents were identified for respondents who\nwere unable to provide reliable responses or due to poor\nhealth. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in Mexico\nWave 1 were used in this study. More information on\nWHO SAGE is available elsewhere (17). SAGE was\napproved by the Ethics Review Committee of the World\nHealth Organization and by the Ethics Committee of\nthe National Institute of Public Health in Cuernavaca,\nMexico.\nMeasures\nSAGE evaluates self-reported perceptions of health, well-\nbeing, and cognition, and also assesses these using more\nobjective measures, including a battery of cognitive tests\n(immediate and delayed verbal recall, VR; verbal fluency,\nVF; forward digit span, FDS; and backward digit span,\nBDS), and a 4-metre (4-m) timed walk at both normal and\nrapid pace.\nVerbal memory was tested using verbal recall, consisting\nof three repetitions of a 10-word list for immediate recall,\nand then assessing the recall of these words after a 10-min\ndelay. The verbal fluency test consisted of naming as many\nanimals as possible in 1 min, to assess attention, semantic\nmemory, and executive functions. Digit span was used to\nassess memory capacity and executive function, using both\nforward and backward digit recall tests (18). An overall\ncomposite cognitive score, used to characterise cognitive\nfunction, was calculated by standardising and summing\nthe correct responses from immediate and delayed VR, VF,\nFDS, and BDS, and rescaling these to a value between\nCovariates included a number of sociodemographic\nvariables such as age, sex, urban/rural locality of residence\nand asset-based income quintiles. Age was recategorised\nOther predictors included: self-report of difficulties with\nmemory (`Overall in the last 30 days, how much difficulty\ndid you have with concentrating or remembering things?'),\ndifficulties with ADLs (including questions on eating,\nwalking, climbing stairs, concentrating, bathing, getting\ndressed) and IADLs (including questions on household\ncare, daily work, using public transport), timed normal\ngait speed over a 4 m distance (slow gait was considered to\nexcluded). Prevalence of stroke and hypertension was\nbased on self-report using a form of the question: `Have\nyou ever been told by a health professional that you have\n[disease/condition]?'. Depression was measured using an\nalgorithm based on diagnosis and symptoms (including\nquestions on medication/therapy, sadness, loss of interest,\nlow energy) and based on the World Mental Health\nSurvey's version of the Composite International Diagnos-\ntic Interview (21). Use of tobacco was based on the\nquestion: `Do you currently use (smoke, sniff or chew)\nany tobacco products such as cigarettes, cigars, pipes,\nchewing tobacco or snuff?'. Tobacco use for this analysis\nincluded daily and non-daily use. Alcohol use was based on\nthe question: `Have you consumed alcohol in the last 30\ndays?'.\nStatistical analysis\nData were analysed in STATA (MP13). Post-stratification\nanalysis weights were applied. Bivariate associations\nbetween predictors and the outcome variable (overall\ncognitive score) were assessed using linear regression.\nReference groups were: 50\u00c159 age group, male gender,\nurban locality, lowest income percentile, no self-reported\ndifficulty with memory, no difficulty with any of the six\nADLs, no difficulty with IADLs, slow gait speed (B1 m/s),\nno depression, no stroke, no hypertension, no tobacco use,\nand no alcohol use. Variables associated with cognition at\npB0.1 were then included in a multiple linear regression\nJenny Miu et al.\n(page number not for citation purpose)\nanalysis and reduced stepwise until only factors with\nResults\nyears old (Table 1, unweighted data). Men made up 40% of\nrespondents and 73% of respondents lived in urban areas.\nA large proportion of people reported having memory\ndifficulties in the past 30 days (53%) and difficulties in\nADLs (45%); only 16% reported difficulties with IADLs.\nRespondents predominantly walked at a gait slower than 1\nm/s (85%). Thirteen percent ofolder adults had a historyof\ndepression, 5% reported having had a stroke, and 39%\nreported hypertension. Fifty-two percent reported current\ntobacco use and 28% had consumed alcohol in the past\nIn the bivariate analysis, significant negative associa-\ntions were found between lower cognitive score (poorer\ncognitive function) and higher age (pB0.001), rural living\nincreasing difficulty with ADLs (pB0.001), and IADLs\n(pB0.001), and those diagnosed with hypertension\nwere observed for income percentile (pB0.001), faster gait\nweighted data). Sex, depression, and stroke were not\nsignificantly associated with the calculated composite\ncognitive score.\nMultiple linear regression analyses revealed that, after\nadjusting for confounding factors, poorer global cognitive\nfunctioning was significantly associated with age (!80,\nTable 1.

In this study, lower\ncognitive functioning was strongly associated with ad-\nvancing age, rural living and lower income, as well as with\nsubjective memory complaints and ADL limitations.\nThese findings compare with other SAGE publications\nexamining cognition in Ghana, Tanzania, India (18),\nSouth Africa (22), and China (23), where poorer cogni-\ntive function was observed in those of advancing age,\nrural living, lower education, and wealth levels, and\npoorer subjective health status, including deterioration\nin ADLs and slower gait. Subjective losses in memory\nand daily functioning and its association with poorer\ncognition have been described as features of mild\ncognitive impairment (6, 7), and testing these along\nwith gait speed (24) may aid the early detection of those\nat high risk of dementia and provide a point for successful\ninterventions.\nComorbidities, such as hypertension, also indicated a\nhigher risk for poorer cognitive functioning in this study,\nbut thiswas not observed for a historyof stroke as shown in\nprevious studies in the Mexican population (10, 11).\nAlthough evidence suggests a role for vascular disease in\nTable 2.

Hyperten-\nsion may be a stronger predictor of dementia (10) rather\nthan cognitive impairment (11, 25) and this study did not\ninclude a measure of hypertension in midlife, the factor\nwith, perhaps, the strongest evidence (26). There also is a\nlack of causal evidence between cognition and stroke, as\nboth have been described on the causal pathway in\nMexican\u00c1American populations (25, 27). Similarly, de-\npression may (28), or may not (25) be associated with\ncognitive changes.\nModifiable factors such as tobacco and alcohol use did\nnot have a negative association with cognitive function,\nperhaps because the duration and quantity of use were not\nquantified in these regressions. Approximately 33% of\ntobacco users were not daily smokers (data not shown).\nWhile tobacco is generally associated with poorer cogni-\ntive functioning (13, 29), as it is a known risk factor\nfor cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (30), some\nstudies have not shown an association (31). These\ndifferences are attributed to survivorship bias in large\nepidemiologic studies (32). Similarly, while alcohol in\nmoderation has been shown to be protective (29, 33) other\nstudies have shown no association with cognitive decline\n(13). This may reflect the positive and negative effects of\nalcohol on the cardiovascular system (33), resulting in a\nrelationship described as U-shaped. Alcohol consumption\nalso was not quantified for this analysis but of the\nrespondents who reported use in the past 30 days, 54%\nhad consumed less than one standard drink in the past\nmonth (data not shown).\nThis study describes for the first time associations\nbetween various demographic and modifiable risk factors\nand global measures of cognitive function in a representa-\ntive sample of the older adult Mexican population,\nbuilding upon a previous study examining incidence rates\nof dementia and cognitive impairment (10). Strengths of\nthis study include the large-scale cross-sectional data,\nincluding the collection of objective measurements, with\nthe potential to follow up on individual data with future\nsurvey waves. Comparisons also can be made across a\nnumber of low- and middle-income countries that are\nparticipating in WHO SAGE. Weaknesses include the lack\nof causality, the use of subjective rather than objective\nmeasures including self-report on some disease conditions,\nmissing data particularly on self-reporting which can bias\nthese findings, and the exclusion of dementia data. These\nfindings can inform public health initiatives in Mexico, for\nexample, the current Over 70s Allowance, the 70'\nProgram, or Prospera an intervention for those living in\npoverty (1), to address wider issues involving ageing\npopulations by increasing education and supporting\nmemory (34), or improving vascular health, to reduce the\nburden of cognitive impairment.\nAuthors' contributions\nJM designed the study, carried out the analyses, and\nwrote the paper.
