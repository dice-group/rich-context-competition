Logan, Holly A. Hill, Michele Lynberg Black, Alex E. Crosby, Debra L. Karch, Jamar D. Barnes,\nand Keri M. Lubell\nHomicide-followed-by-suicide (referred to as ``homicide-suicide'') incidents are rare events but can have a profound\nimpact on families and communities. A better understanding of perpetrator characteristics and how they compare with\nthose of other homicide suspects and suicide decedents might provide insight into the nature of these violent acts.This\nreport is based on 2003\u00ad2005 data from 17 US states participating in the National Violent Death Reporting System,\na unique, incident-based, active surveillance system that integrates data on violent deaths from multiple sources. Of\nthe 408 homicide-suicide incidents identified, most incidents were committed with a firearm (88.2%) and perpetrated\nby males (91.4%), those over 19 years of age (97.6%), and those of white race (77.0%); however, just over half of\nfilicide (killing of children)-suicides (51.5%) were perpetrated by females. Over 55% of male homicide-suicide perpe-\ntrators versus 26.4% of other male suicide decedents had prior intimate partner conflicts (P < 0.001). In fact, having\na history of intimate partner conflicts was even common among homicide-suicide perpetrators who did not victimize\ntheir intimate partners. Recognition of the link between intimate partner conflicts and homicide-suicide incidents and\nstrategies involving collaboration among the court/legal and mental health systems might prevent these incidents.\nhomicide; suicide; violence\nAbbreviation: NVDRS, National Violent Death Reporting System.\nA homicide-followed-by-suicide (hereafter referred to as\n``homicide-suicide'') incident is generally defined as a\n2-stage sequential act in which a person kills 1 or more in-\ndividuals and then commits suicide shortly thereafter (1\u00ad3).\nAlthough homicide-suicide incidents are relatively rare events,\nannually or 20\u00ad30 violent deaths weekly (3). Homicide-\nsuicide incidents can have long-term traumatic effects on\nthose closely associated with the incident and frequently\nhave a profound psychological impact on communities\n(4). Some incidents involve multiple fatalities among individ-\nuals unrelated to the perpetrator, as did the 2007 shooting\nincidents at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univer-\nsity and the 1999 incident at Columbine High School (5);\nhowever, for the vast majority of homicide-suicide inci-\ndents, the homicide victim is a current or former female\nintimate partner of a male perpetrator (1\u00ad3).\nSome studies have proposed typologies for categorizing\nthese incidents to help guide future research into this phe-\nnomenon (3, 6). These typologies are typically based on the\nvictim-perpetrator relationships and generally include the\nfollowing, by order of commonality: intimate partner-\nrelated homicide-suicide incidents (approximately 42%\u00ad\n69% of homicide-suicide incidents); familicide (killing of\nall family members in a household) or filicide (killing of\nchildren)-suicide incidents (18%\u00ad47% of homicide-suicide\nincidents); and extrafamilial homicide (killing of nonfamily\nmembers)-suicide incidents (12%\u00ad26% of homicide-suicide\nincidents) (1, 7). Some incidents are also of mixed type,\nwhere there are familial and extrafamilial victims involved.\nSeveral studies have evaluated homicide-suicide inci-\ndents within selected populations (e.g., among the elderly)\n(8), in individual states (7, 9\u00ad12), and across multiple cities\nCorrespondence to Dr. Joseph E. Logan, Division of Violence Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease\nstudies on homicide-suicide incidents from multiple states are\nNational Violent Death Reporting System, Bossarte et al.\n(2) estimated that only 11% of homicide-suicide perpetrators\nhave a documented mental health condition and that approxi-\nmately 30% are intoxicated at the time of the incident. Over\n85% of perpetrators were male, and more than 70% were\nnon-Hispanic white. Additionally, over 70% of victims in\nhomicide-suicide incidents were female, and over 55% of\nvictims were current or former intimate partners. Approxi-\nmately 20% of victims are the perpetrator's children,\nstepchildren, or other relatives. Approximately 80% of homi-\ncide-suicide incidents occurred in either the victim's or per-\npetrator's home, and over 80% were committed with\na firearm. These findings were similar to those from earlier\nCircumstances leading up to these violent events have\nalso been described in several studies. These include es-\ntrangement associated with divorce or breakup (1, 3, 10,\nkilling or death pact (2, 3, 22), and loss of employment or\nfinancial problems (2). Some events are also likely to be\nidiosyncratic of a perpetrator's delusions or psychopathol-\nAlthough previous studies have expanded our knowledge\nabout the characteristics of homicide-suicide incidents,\nmany areas require further exploration. For example, there\nis little information comparing perpetrator characteristics\nacross types of homicide-suicide incidents (typology based\non the victim-perpetrator relationship). Similarly, there is\nlittle information available with respect to how character-\nistics of homicide-suicide perpetrators compare with those\nwho commit homicide alone or those who commit suicide\nalone. Such information may lead to an increased under-\nstanding of etiologic factors related to the perpetration of\nhomicide-suicide incidents (1, 3) and may inform the de-\nvelopment of prevention and intervention efforts.\nThe primary objective of this study was to describe per-\npetrators across a full range of homicide-suicide incidents\nthat occurred within a multistate, population-based surveil-\nlance system. Additionally, we compared homicide-suicide\nperpetrators with other suicide decedents and with other\nhomicide suspects to assess differences and similarities.\nTo the authors' knowledge, no study to date has had suffi-\ncient samples to do this kind of analysis by use of multiple\ndata sources.\nData source\nThe National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS)\nis an incident-based, violent death surveillance system that\ncombines data from multiple sources. Data collection for\nthe NVDRS began in 2003 in 7 states (Alaska, Maryland,\nMassachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, and\nVirginia). In 2004, 6 states were added (Colorado, Georgia,\nNorth Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin).\nIn 2005, 4 states were added (California, Kentucky, New\nstates. Data collection is statewide with the exception of Cal-\nifornia, which collects data in only 4 counties (Los Angeles,\nRiverside, San Francisco, and Santa Clara).\nInformation is gathered from participating states on all\nsuicides, homicides, legal intervention deaths, unintentional\nfirearm deaths, and deaths for which the manner is undeter-\nmined (24, 25). The NVDRS includes information on the\nvictims of violent death, the suspected perpetrators and their\nrelationships to the victims, the involved weapons, and the\ncircumstances leading up to the injury event (24, 26). Data\nfrom coroner and medical examiner reports, toxicology re-\nports, various law enforcement records, supplemental homi-\ncide reports, and death certificates are linked into a single\ndata repository. Several optional reports can also be linked\ninto the data set, depending on the states' preferences. These\ninclude crime lab reports, firearm trace reports from the\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and child fatality\nreviews. Such integrated data provide greater insight into the\nnature of violent deaths than does any single data source (24).\nStates manage data collection typically through state\nhealth departments or a subcontracted entity, such as a med-\nical examiner's office. Data are gathered and coded by\ntrained abstracters in each state. Data may be extracted from\nvarious reports or imported electronically from other sys-\ntems (i.e., Bureau of Vital Statistics' death certificate files or\nmedical examiner's data sets). All data are reviewed by the\nabstracter to ensure accuracy of the codes (27). To maintain\nconsistency among abstracters, each abstracter follows\na strict NVDRS coding manual. Additionally, for quality\ncontrol purposes, 10% of all narratives are reviewed by staff\nof the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure\naccurate coding of circumstances preceding the violent\ndeath. The NVDRS has been described in further detail\nCase finding\nThe data used for this analysis represent the calendar\nan NVDRS database that was updated through June 2007.\nHomicide and suicide incidents were identified by the man-\nner of death recorded from the death certificates. Homicide-\nsuicide incidents were defined as suicide incidents where the\nperpetrator committed at least one homicide within 1 calen-\ndar day prior to his or her suicide death. Incidents were\ncategorized as homicide-suicide, homicide-only, or suicide-\nonly incidents.\nThe homicide-suicide incidents were further categorized\non the basis of the victim-perpetrator relationship. Informa-\ntion on the victim-perpetrator relationship was obtained\nfrom the narratives of the law enforcement, coroner, and\nmedical examiner reports. In general, these narratives are\nbased on information gathered from the victim's neighbors,\nfriends, family members, and other acquaintances.\nhomicide-only incidents where 1 perpetrator is reported\n(homicide-only incidents were excluded if the perpetrator\nwas either unknown (n \u00bc 2,388) or the incident had multiple\nperpetrators (n \u00bc 1,516)). It should be noted that information\nPerpetrators of Homicides Followed by Suicides 1057\nregarding trial results and convictions of suspected perpe-\ntrators is not included in the NVDRS. Therefore, in the re-\nmainder of this report, the term ``suspects'' is used, which\nincludes both perpetrators and ``suspected'' perpetrators.\nOf the 420 homicide-suicide incidents identified, the\nvictim-perpetrator relationship could not be identified in\n12 incidents; therefore, these incidents were excluded from\nthis study. For the remaining 408 homicide-suicide inci-\ndents, 304 (74.5%) involved current or former intimate part-\nners (this included spouse, former spouse, girlfriend,\nboyfriend, former girlfriend, and former boyfriend). There\nwere 33 (8.1%) filicide-suicide incidents; these included\nchild, stepchild, and foster child (child of the suspect, in-\ncluding both young and adult children). Additionally, there\nwere 29 (7.1%) ``other'' family-related homicide-suicide in-\ncidents (including parent, sibling, grandchild, grandparent,\nin-law, stepparent, child of suspect's boyfriend or girlfriend,\nintimate partner of suspect's parents, foster parent, other\nfamily member) and 42 (10.3%) extrafamilial homicide-\nsuicide incidents (babysitter, acquaintance, friend, room-\nmate, current or former coworker, rival gang member, other\nperson known to victim, or stranger).\nIntimate partner-related homicide-suicide incidents were\nfurther divided into 2 categories, those with only intimate\nintimate partners and one or more additional victims (n \u00bc 24,\n5.9% of total incidents). For the majority of the intimate\npartner-related incidents that had other victims (n \u00bc 16),\nthe additional victims were children. For 8 incidents, the\nadditional victims were friends, strangers, or other family\nmembers.\nAnalysis\nHomicide-suicide perpetrators were compared across the\nvarious types by calculating frequency distributions of de-\nmographic factors (i.e., age, sex, race, and ethnicity) and\nvarious health-related and preceding life-event circumstan-\nces known to be risk factors for suicide and/or homicide (all\nhealth-related and circumstance information was gathered\nfrom the narratives written in the various law enforcement\nand coroner and medical examiner reports). These factors\nincluded having a current mental health condition, having\na history of substance abuse problems, being suspected of\nintoxication at the time of the event, having a history of\nsuicide attempts, having serious physical health problems\n(e.g., chronic pain or cancer), having a history of intimate\npartner conflict, having a history of other relationship prob-\nlems, and having job or financial problems (28\u00ad31). Com-\nparisons were also made regarding whether the perpetrator\ndisclosed suicide intent (indicating signs of premeditation),\nwhether the perpetrator was receiving mental health treat-\nment (i.e., currently in mental health treatment or using\nantidepressants), and whether the perpetrator committed\nthe act out of the belief that he or she was relieving some\nform of suffering (i.e., mercy killing). Because cell sizes\nwere often small, Fisher's exact tests were used to assess\nstatistical significance for all categorical variables. The sig-\nnificance of observed differences in median age across the\nsubtypes was evaluated by the Kruskal-Wallis test.\nPerpetrators of homicide-suicide incidents were also\ncompared with those who only committed suicide and those\nwho only committed homicide. This analysis was stratified\nby sex, because male and female perpetrators often have\ndifferent characteristics and preceding circumstances (3).\nFor this analysis, 3 homicide-suicide perpetrators, 5 suicide\ndecedents, and 843 homicide suspects were excluded be-\ncause the sex of the perpetrator was unknown. Bivariate\nanalyses using Fisher's exact tests and a Wilcoxon test were\nconducted to assess significant differences in demographic\nvariables.\nOdds ratios were used to compare homicide-suicide per-\npetrators with other suicide decedents on the basis of the\nsame health-related and life-event circumstances listed in\nthe previous analysis. Because the NVDRS is a violent\ndeath surveillance system, less information is available with\nrespect to the characteristics of suspected perpetrators\nwho are still living. Therefore, we were unable to compare\nhomicide-suicide perpetrators with homicide-only suspects\nwith respect to these factors. Multivariable logistic regres-\nsion analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios;\neach model adjusted for age and racial/ethnic differences\nin order to make the two groups more comparable. Fisher's\nexact tests and the Wilcoxon test were conducted by using\nthe SAS for Windows 9.1 statistical package (SAS Institute,\nInc., Cary, North Carolina). The multivariable logistic re-\ngression analyses were conducted by using the Stata/SE for\nWindows 10.0 statistical package (StataCorp LP, College\nStation, Texas).\nRESULTS\nThe demographic characteristics of the homicide-suicide\nperpetrators, stratified by homicide-suicide type, are pre-\nsented in Table 1. Overall, perpetrators were mostly male\nyears), of white race (77.0%), and of non-Hispanic ethnic\nstatus (89.5%). Most homicide-suicide perpetrators (64%)\nthe extrafamilial homicide-suicide incidents to 61.4% of the\nintimate partner-only homicide-suicide incidents. However,\na high proportion (37.1%) of intimate partner-only homicide-\nsuicide perpetrators were 50 years of age or older.\nAmong incidents with male perpetrators, the vast major-\nity of victims were female intimate partners (77.7%); 4%\nwere children. In contrast, the victims of female homicide-\nsuicide perpetrators were most likely to be children\n(48.6%); 40% of victims were male intimate partners. Thus,\nover half (51.5%) of the filicide-suicide incidents were com-\nmitted by female perpetrators.\nThe majority of homicide-suicide incidents (>85%) were\ncommitted by perpetrators that were not suspected of being\nin a depressed mood or having a mental health condition by\nfamily members or friends. However, a third of filicide-\nsuicide perpetrators were reported to be depressed or to have\na current mental health problem (Table 2). Furthermore, for\nall types of homicide-suicide incidents, the majority of the\nperpetrators did not have prior reports of alcohol or sub-\nstance abuse problems, a history of suicide attempts, or\nphysical health problems. However, with the exception of the\nfilicide-suicide perpetrators, about 1 in 5 perpetrators was\nsuspected of being intoxicated at the time of the incident.\nOnly 4.9% of the homicide-suicide incidents were be-\nlieved to have been the result of a mercy killing (Table 2).\nOf the 20 homicide-suicide incidents that were precipitated\nby this circumstance, 19 (95%) of them involved an intimate\npartner.\nApproximately 10% of the perpetrators were currently in\nmental health treatment at the time of committing the\nhomicide-suicide incident; the highest proportion (21.2%)\nwas among those who committed filicide-suicide incidents\n(Table 2). Furthermore, for those with toxicology reports,\na high proportion (36.4%) of the filicide-suicide perpetrators\nwere found to be on antidepressant medications, suggesting\nthat they had previously sought treatment for clinical de-\npression or another mood disorder.\nThe most common weapon used by homicide-suicide per-\npetrators, regardless of the victims involved, was a firearm\n(Table 2). In general, 88.2% of homicide-suicide perpetra-\ntors, ranging from 72.7% of filicide-suicide perpetrators to\n97.6% of extrafamilial homicide-suicide perpetrators, used\na firearm to commit the violent act.\nWith the exception of the other-family-related type of\nhomicide-suicide incidents, intimate partner conflict was\nthe most common preceding life-event factor among perpe-\ntrators (53.9%) (Table 2). In addition to the intimate partner-\nrelated homicide-suicide incidents, these problems were\nalso common among filicide-suicide perpetrators (36.4%)\nand extrafamilial-related homicide-suicide perpetrators\nDemographic characteristics of homicide-suicide perpe-\ntrators were compared with those of suicide-only decedents\nand homicide-only suspects (Table 3). An estimated 92.1%\n(n \u00bc 373) of homicide-suicide perpetrators were male, com-\nmales and females, approximately 60% or more of the per-\npetrators were aged between 20 and 49 years across all\ngroups (homicide followed by suicide, suicide only, and\nhomicide only). A significant proportion of male homicide-\nsuicide perpetrators and suicide-only decedents were aged\npared with male homicide-suicide perpetrators, a higher\nproportion of male homicide-only suspects were aged 10\u00ad\n19 years. This same pattern was observed for females. Simi-\nlarly, for both male and female perpetrators, the vast majority\nof homicide-suicide perpetrators and suicide-only decedents\nwere white non-Hispanics. Male and female homicide-only\nsuspects were more evenly distributed among white (29.2%),\nhomicide-only suspects who victimized an intimate partner,\nthe distribution by race differed in that 40.2% were white and\n39% were black (data not shown).\nTable 4 compares the health, mental health, and life-event\nfactors of homicide-suicide perpetrators with those of\nsuicide-only decedents. Compared with males who died\nby suicide, male homicide-suicide perpetrators were signif-\nicantly less likely to have reports of depressed mood, mental\nhealth problems, alcohol or substance abuse problems, a his-\ntory of suicide attempts, physical health problems, mental\nhealth treatment, or job or financial problems or to have\nTable 1.

They were significantly more likely to have\na history of intimate partner conflicts. Further analysis of the\n208 male homicide-suicide perpetrators who had a history\nof intimate partner conflict revealed that 191 (92%) of these\nperpetrators used a firearm in the homicide-suicide incident\nperpetrators were believed to have retaliated in response to\na divorce request or breakup. In addition, 14 (7.3%) of these\n191 perpetrators were currently in mental health treatment,\nand 34 (17.8%) were currently or recently in court for\nfamily-related issues (i.e., divorce, custody, child support)\nor were recently issued a restraining order.\nWhen compared with female suicide-only decedents, fe-\nmale homicide-suicide perpetrators were less likely to be\nintoxicated at the time of the incident and less likely to have\na prior history of suicide attempts. However, the 2 groups\nwere similar in that a large proportion of female homicide-\nsuicide perpetrators were identified as being in a depressed\nmood (28.6%), currently having a mental health problem\n(42.9%), currently being in treatment for a mental health\ncondition at the time of the incident (31.4%), and having\na history of intimate partner conflict preceding the incident\nDISCUSSION\nSimilar to previous research, this study found that most\nhomicide-suicide incidents were perpetrated by white males\nin middle to late adulthood. Also consistent with pre-\nvious research, this study found that most homicide-suicide\nthe majority of victims were either current or former inti-\nmate partners, and a substantial number of victims were\nchildren (2, 9, 10). We also found that having a history of\nintimate partner conflict was highly common among most\nTable 2.

Our findings also suggest that homicide-\nsuicide perpetration, particularly by males, is mostly\npreceded by intimate partner conflicts/violence as opposed\nto other determinants of suicidal behavior.\nAlthough the demographics of homicide-suicide perpe-\ntrators, in general, differed from those of other homicide\nsuspects, the demographics of males who perpetrated inti-\nmate partner-related homicide-suicide incidents were more\nsimilar to those of male suspects in intimate partner homi-\ncides. In addition, circumstances surrounding many of the\nintimate partner-related homicide-suicide incidents were sim-\nilar to those of intimate partner violence (e.g., divorces or\nseparations) (32). Primary prevention of intimate partner vi-\nolence (preventing violence before it starts) using promising,\neffective strategies is an important step toward reducing the\noccurrence of homicide-suicide incidents and the violent\ndeaths of intimate partners, children, family, friends, and even\nstrangers that are associated with these incidents. Such strat-\negies include changing social norms, role modeling, and\nmentoring adolescents and young adults to help them develop\nand sustain healthy, respectful relationship behaviors (32).\nOur finding that many of these perpetrators were cur-\nrently involved in a family legal court case at the time of\nthe incident also highlights the importance of reducing frag-\nmentation between the court/legal system and the mental\nTable 3.

Recognition of the link among family court\nissues, mental distress, and homicide-suicide violence might\nhelp to improve communication between these two systems.\nInnovative approaches that might facilitate this communi-\ncation without slowing the legal processes include using\ncase managers to rapidly evaluate access to firearms, gather\nhistories of domestic violence, and make referrals to mental\nhealth providers for those in need of counseling.\nFurthermore, the fact that some perpetrators had previ-\nously been issued restraining orders highlights the need for\neffective interventions, once the violence has occurred. For\nexample, a number of integrated domestic violence courts\nhave been specifically designed to improve defendant ac-\ncountability and to enhance victim safety (33). By working\nwith a wide spectrum of stakeholders (e.g., civil attorneys\nand law enforcement, probation, and parole professionals),\njudges in these courts gain greater access to much needed\ninformation. These courts also increase coordination among\ncriminal justice and community-based social service agen-\ncies to provide rapid and comprehensive victim advocacy\nand links to appropriate services (34).\nIn contrast to intimate partner-related homicide-suicide\nperpetrators, a high proportion of filicide-suicide perpetra-\ntors were found by this study to be in mental health treat-\nment at the time of the incident. This finding may be\nexpected because approximately half of these incidents are\ncommitted by females (35, 36), and females are more likely\nthan males to seek care for mental health conditions (37,\n38). This study also found that many of the filicide-suicide\nperpetrators who sought mental health treatment committed\nthe violent act with a firearm. Feeling distressed, sad, or\ndepressed and having access to a weapon of lethal means\nTable 4.

For exam-\nple, for parents who seek treatment for mental health con-\nditions, providers may be able to evaluate access to firearms\nin the household, to obtain additional help for caregiving\nresponsibilities, and to recruit family members to help mon-\nitor the patient's treatment and progress (3).\nThe results from this study are subject to at least 4 lim-\nitations. First, because this study used a 24-hour period to\ndefine homicide-suicide incidents, the number of homicide-\nsuicide incidents may have been underestimated. Second,\nthe information on mental health and substance abuse is\nnot routinely reported by all investigators, and relevant data\nsources (e.g., medical records) are not required for the\nNVDRS; therefore, this study probably underestimated the\nprevalence of these factors. Furthermore, because such\nhistories are typically provided by family members and\nfriends, the accuracy of the information is often unknown\n(2). Third, little information is available on the homicide-\nonly suspects, thereby limiting our ability to compare them\nwith homicide-suicide perpetrators. Fourth, medical investi-\ngators and police officers may be more or less likely to seek\nspecific information (e.g., history of depression), depending\non whether the event is a homicide-suicide incident, a suicide-\nonly incident, or a homicide-only incident. This could\naccount for the low prevalence of these characteristics among\nhomicide-suicide perpetrators found in this study. These char-\nacteristics were found to be prevalent among filicide-suicide\nperpetrators, suggesting that this bias is unlikely, although\ninvestigators might be more inclined to assess mental health\nfactors among those who perpetrate violence on children.\nThis study improves our understanding of homicide-\nsuicide incidents by using the multistate NVDRS. Continued\ndata collection will allow for better descriptions of homi-\ncide-suicide perpetrators, which will further inform preven-\ntion and intervention efforts to address this important public\nhealth problem.\n"
