Survey procedures described elsewhere (9)\nwere approved by the institutional review board, University of North\nCarolina at Chapel Hill.\nFamily subsample\nAdd Health included a respondent subsample matched with up to five\nrelated and nonrelated adolescents per household (mean, 2.1 \u00b1 0.4\nhouseholds) sharing household/physical environments for 10 years\nat Wave I (Figure 1). In Wave III, 4,588 participants were surveyed as\nyoung adults; 913 individuals (in 449 households) continued living with\nanother survey respondent, excluding participants who were severely\ning BMI (Wave II, n = 450; III, n = 613).

Self-\nreported height and weight were substituted for those refusing meas-\nurement and/or weighing more than scale capacity (Wave II, n = 54;\nIII, n = 155) (5). Obesity was defined as BMI 95th percentile of the\nNational Center for Health Statistics/Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention reference curves (11) in adolescence and the BMI 30\ncut-point in adulthood (12).\nGenetic Epidemiology of BMI and Body Mass\nChange From Adolescence to Young Adulthood\nand Penny Gordon-Larsen3,4\nThe complex interplay between genes and environment affecting body mass gain over lifecycle periods of risk is\nnot well understood. We use longitudinal sibling cohort data to examine the role of shared household environment,\nadditive genetic, and shared genetic effects on BMI and BMI change. In the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nHealth, siblings and twin pairs sharing households for 10 years as adolescents (N = 5,524; mean = 16.5 \u00b1 1.7 years)\nwere followed into young adulthood (N = 4,368; mean = 22.4 \u00b1 1.8 years). Using a variance component approach, we\nquantified genetic and household effects on BMI in siblings and nonsiblings sharing household environments over\ntime. Adjusting for race, age, sex, and age-by-sex interaction, we detected a heritability of 0.43 \u00b1 0.05 for BMI change.\nSignificant household effects were noted during the young adulthood period only (0.11 \u00b1 0.06). We find evidence for\nshared genetic effects between BMI and BMI change during adolescence (genetic correlation (\nG\nyoung adulthood (\nG\n= 0.23 \u00b1 0.06). Our findings support a complex etiology of BMI and BMI change.\n1Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA; 2Carolina Center for Genome Sciences, University of North Carolina,\nChapel Hill, North Carolina, USA; 3Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA; 4Department of Nutrition, University\nof North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA; 5Department of Genetics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA; 6Department of Sociology,\nUniversity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA. Correspondence: Penny Gordon-Larsen (pglarsen@unc.edu)\nbrief reports\n \nStatistical methods\nTo identify and evaluate the genetic and environmental contributions\nto BMI and BMI change we used a variance component approach\nimplemented in SOLAR (13), which is explained in detail in previous\npublications (14,15) and briefly summarized in the Supplementary\nMethods and Procedures online. All models were adjusted for race,\nage, sex, and age-by-sex interaction.\nResults\nFrom adolescence (mean age = 16.5 \u00b1 1.7 years) to young adult-\nAdjusting for race, age, sex, and age-by-sex interaction,\n(Table 1).\nThough slightly higher in whites, heritability was fairly simi-\nlar across ethnicity. Due to power restrictions, we were only\nable to interrogate the household effect in the full sample,\nwhere significant household effects were noted during young\nadulthood (Table 2). Moreover, the additive genetic signal was\nreduced once household variance was incorporated.\nFindings suggest shared genetic effects between BMI level\nand during adolescence (\nG\nened in adulthood (\nG\nDiscussion\nWe found moderate to strong evidence for the additive effects\nof genes influencing BMI change in a nationally representa-\ntive, ethnically diverse sibling cohort of adolescence followed\ninto young adulthood. These heritability estimates are higher\nthan those from other family studies (2\u00ad4), perhaps due to\nthe large variance in BMI change during this critical period of\nweight gain or to features of our study design, i.e., the sample\nis primary composed of sibling pairs. The heritability estimates\nwere most similar to those reported by Rice et al., in partici-\npants from the Longitudinal Quebec Family Study, where they\ncalculated heritability for BMI change of 37% over a 12-year\nperiod. This heritability estimate was mainly driven by correla-\ntions between young adult siblings, ranging in age from 19 to\n31 years between the two BMI measurements. In comparison\nto other family studies, this study may have been most similar\nin age to the Add Health cohort. However, direct comparison\nof heritability estimates across studies is problematic due to\ndifferences in study designs, ascertainment schemes, methods\nof parameter estimation, and population-specific environmen-\ntal contributions to the phenotypic variance (16). The vast\nmajority of literature on heritability is in European samples.\nTaking advantage of our large, ethnically diverse sample, we\nfound that residual heritability was fairly similar across ethnic-\nity, although power limitations precluded estimation of ethnic-\nspecific interactions.\nHousehold effects are attributable to unmeasured non-\ngenetic factors (e.g., dietary or lifestyle factors) that are shared\nmore closely by members of the same (versus different) house-\nhold (16). We found household effects at young adulthood, but\nnot during adolescence perhaps because dietary and physical\nactivity behaviors of adolescents likely mirror parental and\nsibling behaviors while they live in the same household (17),\nbut may change as young adults move out and establish their\nown households. Thus, the differences in household behaviors\nbecome more varied as siblings move away from each other\nand their parents.\nConversely, shared genetic effects between BMI level and\nchange were stronger during adolescence than young adult-\nhood. Research in adult twins similarly shows low genetic\ncorrelation between BMI level and change (suggesting little\noverlap in the genetic variants influencing these phenotypes),\nwhich coupled with our findings provide support for distinct\ngenetic effects (7,8).\nIn summary, our findings suggest that BMI change, particu-\nlarly in adolescence, may be an important trait for mapping\ngenes related to obesity. In addition, our findings support pre-\nvious findings of a complex etiology of BMI change, involving\ngenetic and environmental components.\nTable 1Residual heritability of body mass change in young\nadults:The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\nHeritabilitya P value\naAfter accounting for the effects of age, sex, and age-by-sex interaction.\nbStandard errors could not be computed.\nTable 2Residual heritability and household effects on body\nmass change in Add Health participants\nHeritability\nHousehold\nvariance\naAfter accounting for the effects of age, sex, and age-by-sex interaction.\nbEstimated on a boundary, standard errors could not be computed.\nFigure 1 Shared and nonshared environments among the sibling and\nhousehold analysis sample of Add Health.
