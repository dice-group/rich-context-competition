The opportunity to\nuse illicit drugs was reported by 81.4% of the oldest ado-\nmedian age at onset was 14 years for alcohol abuse with\nor without dependence, 14 years for drug abuse with de-\npendence, and 15 years for drug abuse without depen-\ndence. The associations observed by age, sex, and race/\nethnicity often varied significantly by previous stage of use.\nConclusions: Alcohol and drug use is common in US\nadolescents, and the findings of this study indicate that\nmost cases of abuse have their initial onset in this im-\nportant period of development. Prevention and treat-\nment efforts would benefit from careful attention to the\ncorrelates and risk factors that are specific to the stage\nof substance use in adolescents.\nand drug use that emerge\nduring adolescence are in-\ncreasingly recognized as\nimportant determinants of\nlater substance use behavior and associ-\nated disorders.1-9 Estimates from major sur-\nveys in the United States, including the Na-\ntional Survey on Drug Use and Health\n(NSDUH),10 the National Health and Nu-\ntrition Examination Surveys (NHANES),11\nand the Monitoring the Future study,12 in-\ndicate that by 17 years of age most ado-\ncohol, 31% to 44% had tried cannabis, and\n4% to 6% had tried cocaine. Although each\nof these investigations provides informa-\ntion on the prevalence of alcohol or drug\nuse among adolescents, only the NSDUH\nexamined substance use disorders, and the\nassessments were limited to symptoms ex-\nperienced during the previous 12 months.\nThe only national survey to use direct di-\nagnostic interviews regarding both cur-\nrent and lifetime substance use among US\nadolescents recently described large in-\ncreases in the cumulative incidence of sub-\nyears of age13 and an overall lifetime preva-\nlence that approaches that of adult\nsamples.14-17 Nationally representative data\nconcerning the full trajectory of sub-\nstance use and associated disorders in ado-\nlescence have been lacking and are neces-\nsary for attaining further progress in\nprevention and public health objectives.18\nIn addition to more complete descrip-\ntions of substance use trajectories in ado-\nlescents, assessment of factors associated\nwith the development of substance use dis-\norders in nationally representative samples\nis crucial.

For example, no\nsalient sex differences were observed for initial alcohol\nand ethnic differences for illicit substances in this inves-\ntigation were at times contrary to the adult literature.11\nAn additional rationale for understanding sociodemo-\ngraphic variation is the need for information concern-\ning the timing of their influence across the substance use\ntrajectory. Recent analyses of population-based surveys\nhave shown that the magnitude and even direction of as-\nsociations observed for many sociodemographic vari-\nciodemographic factors conditioned on stage of previous\nuse are currently lacking in US adolescent samples, and\nlittle is known about the timing of their expression dur-\ning this key stage of development.\nThe present investigation examines these issues in the\nNational Comorbidity Survey\u00adAdolescent Supplement\n(NCS-A), a nationally representative survey that used di-\nrect diagnostic interviews with youth aged 13 to 18 years.\nThe goals of this report are to (1) describe the preva-\nlence of 4 lifetime stages of alcohol use (use, regular use,\nabuse without dependence, and abuse with depen-\ndence) and 4 lifetime stages of illicit drug use (opportu-\nnity to use, first drug use, drug abuse without depen-\ndence, and drug abuse with dependence); (2) estimate the\nprevalence of these stages by age, sex, and race/ethnicity;\nand (3) examine the association of these sociodemo-\ngraphic variables with the risk of transition among stages.\nMETHODS\nThe NCS-A is a nationally representative, face-to-face survey\nUnited States conducted between February 1, 2001, and Janu-\nsional interview staff of the Institute for Social Research at the\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor. There were 197 interview-\ners supervised by a team of 18 experienced regional supervi-\nsors. A study manager located at the central facility in Michi-\ngan oversaw the work of the supervisors and their staff. The\nNCS-A was performed in a dual-frame sample that included a\nhousehold subsample and a school subsample.24-27 The overall\nNCS-A response rate combining the 2 subsamples was 82.9%.\nComparisons of sample and population distributions on US Cen-\nsus sociodemographic variables, and in the school sample on\nschool characteristics, documented only minor differences,\nwhich were corrected with poststratification weighting. The re-\ncruitment and consent procedures were approved by the Hu-\nman Subjects Committees of both Harvard Medical School and\nthe University of Michigan. On making in-person contact, the\ninterviewer answered questions before obtaining written in-\nformed consent from the parent and then written informed as-\nsent from the adolescent. Once the survey was completed, cases\nwere weighted for variation in within-household probability of\nselection (in the household subsample) and for residual dis-\ncrepancies between the sample and the US population on the\nbasis of sociodemographic and geographic variables. These\nweighting procedures are discussed in more detail else-\nwhere.26,27 Sociodemographic variables examined in this re-\nport include age (in years), sex, and self-described race/\nethnicity. Approximately half the sample was male (51.3%) and\nthe mean age was 15.2 years, with a larger proportion of ado-\nnon-Hispanic blacks, and 14.4% Hispanics.\nAdolescents were administered a modified version (version 3.0)\nof the World Health Organization Composite International Di-\nagnostic Interview (CIDI), a fully structured interview admin-\nistered by trained lay interviewers to generate DSM-IV diagno-\nses.28 The modifications to the CIDI were conducted following\na standard 4-step process of instrument development pro-\nposed by experts in survey methods.24 First, diagnostic sec-\ntions of the adult CIDI were reviewed to determine whether\nassessment for particular disorders should be removed based\non low presumed prevalence in adolescents. Second, the lan-\nguage in the remaining CIDI sections was modified to en-\nhance comprehension with adolescents using an iterative pro-\ncess. Third, CIDI modules were modified in content to make\nthem more germane to the contexts and experiences of ado-\nlescents. The most common change of this type required al-\ntering references from adult contexts (eg, work life and par-\nenting) to adolescent contexts (eg, school life and peer\nrelationships). Fourth, the finalized revision of each diagnos-\ntic module was reviewed for meaning, logic, and comparabil-\nity to the adult version. Each diagnostic section was then sys-\ntematically piloted to test the flow and timing among adolescents,\nwith subsequent modifications to reduce the length of the di-\nagnostic sections. Lifetime substance use disorders assessed in\nthe CIDI included alcohol and drug abuse, and individuals ful-\nfilling abuse criteria were administered questions concerning\ndependence criteria. This report therefore presents both cat-\negories of abuse (with or without dependence). In light of dif-\nferences in the pertinence of diagnostic categories for nico-\ntine, trajectories for this substance will be addressed in a separate\nmanuscript. In addition to DSM-IV diagnoses, all respondents\nwere asked about the use of diverse substances and their age\nat which specific stages of use first occurred. For alcohol, the\nlifetime use question concerned age at which respondents first\n(if ever) had a drink with alcohol, specified as beer, wine, wine\ncoolers, and hard liquor (eg, vodka, gin, whiskey, and mixed\ndrinks). First regular use of alcohol was defined as the age at\nwhich the respondent first had at least 12 drinks within a single\nyear. For illicit drugs, participants were asked their age at which\nthey had first (if ever) consumed a range of specific sub-\nstances, including marijuana or hashish; cocaine in any form\n(eg, powder, crack, freebase, coca leaves, or paste); tranquil-\nizers, stimulants, pain killers, or other prescription drugs either\nwithout the recommendation of a health professional or for any\nreason other than a health professional said they should be used;\nand heroin, opium, glue, lysergic acid diethylamide, peyote, or\nany other drug. Participants were also asked about the first time\nthey had an opportunity to drink alcohol or use drugs, regard-\nless of whether they used them. Opportunity to use was de-\nfined as when someone either offered them alcohol or drugs\nor when the individual was present when others were using and\ncould have used if he or she wanted to. The age at first oppor-\ntunity to use substances was recorded separately for alcohol\nand drugs. In light of the high availability of legal substances,\nsuch as alcohol, only opportunity to use illicit drugs is exam-\nined in this investigation.\n\u00a92012 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nCross-tabulations were used to calculate the prevalence of the\n4 stages of alcohol and drug use by demographic characteris-\ntics. Conditional prevalence estimates for each alcohol or drug\nuse stage were also calculated among those who had reached\nthe earlier stage of use. Estimated projections of the cumula-\ntive probability of stages of alcohol or drug use as of the age of\n18 years were obtained by the actuarial method implemented\nin PROC LIFETEST in SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS\nInstitute, Inc). The associations of age, sex, and race/ethnicity\nwith the stages of alcohol or drug use were examined using mul-\ntiple logistic regression analysis. Because the NCS-A data are\nboth clustered and weighted, the Taylor series linearization\nmethod implemented in SUDAAN (version 10; Research Tri-\nangle Institute) was used to estimate standard errors of logis-\ntic regression coefficients. The coefficients and standard er-\nrors were exponentiated to produce odds ratios and 95% CIs.\nSignificance of predictor sets was evaluated using Wald F tests\nbased on design-adjusted coefficient variance-covariance ma-\ntrices. Statistical significance was consistently evaluated using\n2-sided tests with a .05 significance level.\nTable 1.

Female adolescents were also\nless likely to make the transition from any alcohol use\nto regular use, as were adolescents who were black or\nmembers of other racial/ethnic groups compared with\nwhite adolescents.

The pur-\nposes of the present investigation were to estimate in a\nnationally representative sample of adolescents the preva-\nlence of multiple states of alcohol and illicit drug use and\nabuse and to examine the association of sociodemo-\ngraphic variables with transitions across these sub-\nstance use categories.\nThe present study reports several novel findings con-\ncerning the incidence and prevalence of alcohol and drug\nabuse among US youth. Although the NSDUH has shown\nthat the rates of abuse with or without dependence of al-\ncohol or illicit drugs have converged during the past sev-\neral years among adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, we found\ngreater rates for drug abuse (8.9%) than alcohol abuse\n(6.5%) among adolescents. Our conditional analyses also\nrevealed high rates of regular use and abuse in adoles-\ncent substance users. Among alcohol users, 42.2% re-\nported regular use, and 25.9% of these regular drinkers\nmet criteria for abuse with or without dependence. For\nillicit substances, 40.5% reported using drugs after hav-\ning had the opportunity to do so, and nearly 36.6% of\ndrug users met criteria for abuse with or without depen-\ndence. These conditional rates are higher than base (un-\nconditional) rates reported by prior surveys of youth and\ntherefore provide additional information concerning risk\nof substance abuse after initial use during adolescence.\nThe risk of drug abuse among adolescent users is of con-\ncern considering the recent findings from the Monitor-\ning the Future and NSDUH, which show a resurgence\nof marijuana use among adolescents, even surpassing use\nof nicotine, a finding that may reflect increasingly toler-\nant attitudes concerning the use of illicit drugs.10,12\nThe median age at onset of alcohol abuse with or with-\nout dependence was 14 years, with 15.1% meeting diag-\nnostic criteria by 18 years of age. Drug abuse was char-\nacterized by a similarly young median age at onset and\nwith a prevalence of 16.4% among the oldest adoles-\ncents. These adolescent lifetime prevalence estimates for\nabuse can be compared with adult prevalences observed\nin the National Comorbidity Survey\u00adReplication, a study\nthat used parallel methods and was conducted concur-\nrently with the NCS-A. Lifetime prevalence of alcohol\nabuse in the adult survey (18.6%) was only marginally\nhigher than the adolescent prevalence we observed,\nwhereas the prevalence of drug abuse among adults\n19-30) was actually lower than the adolescent preva-\nTaken together, these findings suggest greater inci-\ndence risk and lifetime prevalence of substance abuse dur-\ning adolescence than has been estimated from adult\nsamples.14-17 Such differences are likely to reflect the in-\nclusion of older-onset cases in investigations of adults and\nincreases in retrospective memory biases in these samples.\nIt also remains possible that younger cohorts are more\nlikely to use specific substances or to use them at an ear-\nlier age. In this regard, the conditional analyses demon-\nstrate that the risk of abuse among users is particularly\nhigh among the youngest adolescents. The conditional\nrate for abuse with or without dependence among the\nconditional rate (35.4% vs 3.4%). By contrast, the con-\nditional rate of abuse with or without dependence among\nthe oldest adolescents is just more than twice the un-\nditional rates in younger adolescents may be partly at-\ntributable to the low unconditional prevalences, they\nnonetheless pinpoint early adolescence as a period of\nheightened risk for substance use and abuse.29,30 The el-\nevated rate and risk of substance use and abuse among\nyouth should be considered relative to neuroimaging data\nthat demonstrate the occurrence of important matura-\ntional changes in the brain during adolescence, particu-\nlarly in regions associated with regulatory control and\ndecision making. Such normative developmental pro-\ncesses may be substantially compromised by substance\nAlthough probability of each stage of alcohol and drug\nuse increased with age, rates were almost always lowest\nfor black and other racial/ethnic groups compared with\nwhite or Hispanic adolescents. These findings may con-\ntradict common assumptions but are consistent with pre-\nvious investigations in adult and adolescent samples.10,11\nNo salient sex differences were observed in lifetime al-\ncohol use, whereas minor differences were observed for\nall other stages of alcohol or drug use among adoles-\nyears of age, male adolescents had notably higher rates\nfor most stages of alcohol or drug use. These findings are\nglobally consistent with previous reports of the associa-\ntions between sociodemographic characteristics and sub-\nindicate that sex differences in substance use behavior\nAge at Onset, y\nCumulative Prevalence, %\nAny drug use\nFirst opportunity to use drug\nAbuse and dependence\nAbuse alone\nFigure 2.

In conditional analy-\nses, male alcohol users were significantly more likely to\ntransition to regular alcohol use, whereas no sex differ-\nences were associated with drug use transitions. Re-\nduced risk for black adolescents was significant only in\ntransitions from alcohol use to regular use, from having\nthe opportunity to use drugs to drug use, and from drug\nuse to drug abuse without dependence. Despite lower rates\nof drug use among other racial/ethnic groups, these ado-\nlescents were more likely than white adolescents to tran-\nsition from use to abuse with dependence. These find-\ndemonstrating that stage of previous substance use mod-\nerates the role of sociodemographic factors.\nThe principal strengths of this study include its use\nof a nationally representative adolescent sample with di-\nrect diagnostic interviews and the assessment of mul-\ntiple stages of alcohol and drug use. Study limitations in-\nclude its cross-sectional design, retrospective reporting\nfor age at onset information, and the lack of assessment\nof alcohol or drug dependence without a history of abuse.\nHowever, although we would expect that only a small\nproportion of youth would be excluded in this latter rea-\nson, the conclusions are limited to the categories exam-\nined and may not be generalizable outside of the US ado-\nlescent population. Caution is also warranted in drawing\nparallels to findings from retrospective estimates in adult\nsamples because such interviews may underestimate rates\nTable 3.

It is impor-\ntant to consider that psychoactive substances are impli-\ncated in more than 12% of mortality worldwide and their\nuse constitutes the leading cause of preventable death.39,40\nBecause the early onset of substance use is a significant pre-\ndictor of substance use behavior and disorders in a life-\nspan,1-9 the public health implications of the current find-\nings are far reaching. The prevention of both alcohol and\nillicit drug abuse requires strategies that target early ado-\nlescence and take into account the highly differential in-\nfluence that population-based factors may exert by stage\nof substance use. The lack of information concerning the\nprecise stage of alcohol or drug use most associated with\nsociodemographic factors may partly explain the modest\nsuccess observed for certain prevention strategies.41-43 An\nadditional challenge for national policy concerns the emer-\ngence of drug instrumentalization models that emphasize\nthe adaptive role that psychoactive substances may play in\nthe daily lives of nondependent individuals.44 The critical\nevaluation of such perspectives and the development of ap-\npropriate national policy on alcohol and drug use can only\nbe achieved through empirical data describing the nature\nof harm or risk posed by alcohol and drugs.\nSubmitted for Publication: June 7, 2011; final revision\nCorrespondence: Kathleen R.
