Epiglottis length and angle,\ntongue size and narrowest pharyngeal distance were determined using computed tomography\nimaging. Intubation success rate, time to successful intubation (intubating time) and postoperative\nthroat symptoms were documented.\nResults: Of 152 patients, 148 (97.4%) were successfully intubated on the first attempt (mean\nintubating time 11.5 \u00c6 6.7 s). Intubating time was positively correlated with laryngoscopic grade\nand body mass index in both male and female patients, and Mallampati class and neck\ncircumference in male patients. Epiglottis length was positively correlated with intubating time.\nConclusions: Ease of intubation was influenced by epiglottis length. Radiological evaluation may\nbe useful for preoperative assessment of patients undergoing endotracheal intubation with light\nwand.\n",

In the case of light wand\nintubation, obesity (body mass index\n[BMI] ! 30kg/m2) and Mallampati class III\nairway have been shown to predict pro-\nlonged intubating time in patients with no\nknown airway abnormalities.12 There was\nno apparent correlation between the laryn-\ngoscopic view and either orotracheal intub-\nation13 or nasotracheal intubation success\nEpiglottis length and tongue size (both\nmeasured radiologically) are used to predict\ndifficulties in fibreoptic orotracheal intub-\nation,15 and may also be relevant to light\nwand intubation.16 There are no studies that\nhave investigated which airway anatomical\nfeatures are associated with difficulties in\nlight wand intubation in adults, however.\nThe aim of the present study was to deter-\nmine the correlation between anatomical\nfeatures of the upper airway (evaluated via\ncomputed tomography [CT] imaging) and\nthe ease of light wand intubation in patients\nundergoing ear, nose and throat (ENT)\nsurgery under general anaesthesia.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe study recruited adult patients (aged !20\nyears) with American Society of Anesthesiolo-\ngists physical status I or II (https://www.asahq.\norg/resources/clinical-information/asa-physical\n-status-classification-system), who were sched-\nuled to undergo ENT surgery with endotra-\ncheal intubation at the Department of\nAnaesthesiology and Pain Medicine,\nUijeongbu St Mary's Hospital College of\nMedicine, The Catholic University of Korea,\nSeoul, Republic of Korea, between October\nwere: known upper airway abnormalities\n(tumours, polyps, infections); history of neck\nsurgery; morbid obesity (BMI ! 35kg/m2);\nsignificant cardiorespiratory disease.\nThe ethics committee of Uijeongbu\nSt Mary's Hospital College of Medicine,\nThe Catholic University of Korea approved\nthe study; and all patients provided written\ninformed consent prior to enrolment.\nStudy parameters\nThe airway was evaluated at the preopera-\ntive visit, and the following parameters were\nrecorded: modified Mallampati class with\nthe patient's mouth wide open, head slightly\nextended and tongue maximally forward\nwith phonation in the sitting position;17\nmouth opening (distance between first inci-\nsors, with mouth fully opened); thyromental\ndistance (distance between thyroid notch\nand lower border of the mandibular\nmentum, with head fully extended); neck\ncircumference at thyroid notch level; any\nneck motion limitation.\nThe upper lip bite test was performed and\nclassified as: I (lower incisors can bite the\nupper lip above the vermilion line); II (lower\nincisors can bite the upper lip below the\nvermilion line); III (lower incisors cannot\nbite the upper lip).18 Patient age, sex, height,\nweight and BMI were recorded.\nPatients were stratified into groups accord-\ning to the following criteria: BMI (<25kg/m2,\ncircumference (<40cm, ! 40cm); Mallampati\nclass (I, II, III); laryngoscopic grade (1, 2, 3,\n4); upper lip bite class (I, II, III). Overweight\nand obesity were classified according to the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\ndefinition (http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/\nadult/defining.html).\nAll patients underwent routine preopera-\ntive CT scanning of the paranasal sinus or\nscout film of the temporal bone. CT scans\nwere analysed by one investigator, blinded\nto possible intubation difficulties. Epiglottis\nlength (tip of epiglottis to vallecula), tongue\nlength (tip of tongue to vallecula), tongue\nheight (from length line to highest portion of\nthe tongue) and pharyngeal gap (narrowest\npharyngeal dimension defined anteriorly by\nthe posterior wall of the epiglottis and\nposteriorly by the posterior pharyngeal\nwall) were measured digitally on soft\ncopies of scout views of temporal bone CT\nor sagittal views of paranasal sinus CT.\nEpiglottic angle was described as the angle\nbetween the perpendicular line subtended\nfrom the vallecula and the line subtended\nfrom the posterior wall of the epiglottis.\nTongue size was calculated as its\nlength \u00c2 height (Figure 1).\nAnaesthesia and intubation\nNone of the patients received premedica-\ntion. Routine monitoring included electro-\ncardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure and\npulse oximetry. Patients were placed in the\nsniffing position with a 10-cm pillow under\nthe head. Anaesthesia was induced with 2mg/\nkg propofol and 1.0\u00ad1.5 lg/kg fentanyl, after\npreoxygenation with 100% oxygen for 3 min.\nAfter loss of eyelash reflex, 0.6mg/kg rocur-\nonium was administered intravenously. The\nlungs were manually ventilated by face mask\nfresh gas flow of 6l/min.\nAfter muscle relaxation, laryngoscopy\ngrade was determined in all patients via\ndirect laryngoscopy using a Macintosh no. 3\nblade. Laryngeal view was graded without\nexternal laryngeal pressure according to\nthe Cormack classification as: grade I (com-\nplete visualization of the vocal cords);\ngrade II (visualization of the inferior portion\nof the glottis); grade III (visualization of\nthe epiglottis only); grade IV (inability to\nvisualize the epiglottis).19 Patients were\nventilated by mask for 1 min after assessing\nlaryngoscopic view in order to prevent\nhypoxaemia.\nAn experienced anaesthetist (J.K.) who\nwas blinded to patients' radiological meas-\nurements performed all tracheal intubations\nusing a well-lubricated endotracheal tube\nplaced over a light wand (Surch-liteTM;\nAaron Medical, St Petersberg, FL, USA).\nThe light source was placed at the level of\nthe endotracheal tube tip, and the distal end\nof the wand and covering tube were bent to\ncheal tube was used for women and a size 8\ntube for men, regardless of body weight.\nOperating room lights were dimmed during\nintubation to assist visualization of trans-\nillumination. The jaw was lifted forwards\nwith the left hand of the intubating anaes-\nthetist, and the light wand and tube were\npassed down the midline of the tongue using\nthe right hand. The cuff of the endotracheal\ntube was then inflated with air and intub-\nation was confirmed by both auscultation of\nbreath sounds and detection of carbon\ndioxide by the capnograph. All patients\nwere mechanically ventilated with 2\u00ad3%\nsevoflurane in air/oxygen and received con-\ntinuous remifentanil infusion.\nThe time to intubation (intubating time)\nand numbers of attempts and failures were\nrecorded. Intubating time was defined as\nthe interval from the device touching the\npatient's lip to complete unthreading of the\nlight wand. A maximum of two attempts,\neach lasting 30s, was allowed; the 30-s time\nlimit was adopted because intubation using\nlight wand is successful within 30s in 95% of\npatients.7,8,12 Patients were ventilated with\n100% oxygen by mask between intubation\nattempts. If tracheal intubation was unsuc-\ncessful after two attempts, intubation was\nachieved using conventional laryngoscopy.\nPostoperative assessment\nThe presence and severity of sore throat,\nhoarseness and dysphagia were assessed at\nwas: sore throat (0, none; 1, less severe than\nwith a cold; 2, like a cold; 3, more severe\nthan with a cold); hoarseness (0, none; 1,\nnoticed by patient; 2, obvious to observer; 3,\naphonia); dysphagia (0, none; 1, painful\nwith certain foods; 2, painful with all food\nand drink; 3, unable to swallow own secre-\ntions).21 All complications were recorded.\nStatistical analyses\nThe sample size calculation was based on the\nin a pilot study of 12 patients (unpublished\ndata). We assumed that the difference in\nintubating time was clinically significant if\n>5.5s. Power analysis indicated that a\nsample size of 76 patients in each group\nshould be adequate to detect a difference\nbetween the two groups, with a two-sided\nFigure 1.

There was a significant\npositive correlation between epiglottis length\nP \u00bc 0.015). No other parameter was asso-\nciated with intubating time.\nTable 5 shows the correlations between\nintubating time and anatomical parameters.\nThere were significant positive correlations\nbetween intubating time and epiglottis\nlength, laryngoscopic grade, Mallampati\nclass, BMI and neck circumference in the\ntotal study population, and in male patients\n(P < 0.05 for all correlations). In female\npatients, there was a significant positive\ncorrelation between laryngoscopic grade\nand BMI, and a significant negative correl-\nation between thyromental distance and\nintubating time (P < 0.05 for all correl-\nations). There were no correlations between\nintubating time and epiglottic angle, tongue\nsize, pharyngeal gap, mouth opening\nor upper lip bite class in the study\npopulation as a whole, or when stratified\naccording to sex.\nThere were no correlations between intu-\nbating time and the incidence and severity of\nsore throat, hoarseness or dysphagia\n(Table 6).\nDiscussion\nRadiological assessment of airway anatom-\nical characteristics determined that epiglot-\ntis length was correlated with intubating\ntime in the present study. Both laryngo-\nscopic grade and BMI were correlated with\nintubating time in male and female patients,\nand there were significant correlations\nbetween intubating time and Mallampati\nclass and neck circumference in male\npatients. Epiglottic angle, tongue size, pha-\nryngeal gap, mouth opening and upper lip\nbite class were not associated with intubat-\ning time in male or female patients.\nAnaesthetic induction affects muscle\ntone, resulting in a degree of upper airway\nobstruction ranging from narrowing to\ncomplete obstruction, which may hinder\nmanoeuvrability of a light wand.22 Use of\na jaw lift (as in the present study) elevates the\nepiglottis and enhances the passage of the\nintubation tube/light wand.16 It is possible\nthat a long epiglottis may prevent the free\nadvancement of the tube into the trachea,\neven with the use of a jaw lift. A study of 76\nTable 2.

We performed CT imaging\nwith the patients awake and in the supine\nposition, without jaw lifting. It is therefore\npossible that the position of the epiglottis\nand tongue in relation to the pharynx, as\nrevealed by these scans, would differ from\nthat occurring under general anaesthesia.\nHowever, even in cases where the epiglottis\nfalls on the posterior pharyngeal wall, the tip\nof the light wand can be placed at the glottic\nopening when guided from the lateral pos-\nterior side through the piriform fossa.5 Our\nfindings are in accordance with others who\nshowed that, in contrast to laryngoscopy,\nthe ease of light wand-assisted intubation\ndid not appear to be influenced by anatom-\nical variations in the upper airway.3 In a\nstudy of 265 patients who experienced diffi-\ncult intubation, all patients were successfully\nintubated using a light wand.7\nTable 3.

Other studies have\nfound no correlation between high laryngo-\nscopic grade and orotracheal intubation13 or\nnasotracheal intubation success rates.14\nThese studies placed the patient's head and\nneck in a neutral or relatively extended\nposition, in contrast to the present study\nwhere the head was placed in the sniff\nposition with jaw lift. In a sniff position,\nthe epiglottis is almost in contact with the\nposterior pharyngeal wall, making it difficult\nfor the light wand to pass underneath the\nepiglottis.11 The discrepancy between these\nstudies and our study may, in part, be\naccounted for by the different head position\nduring the intubation.\nMallampati class was significantly corre-\nlated with intubating time in the present\nstudy. This finding is in accordance with\nothers, who reported that Mallampati class\nis a good indicator of ease of light wand\nintubation in patients without known\nairway abnormality.12 In contrast, a further\nstudy reported no correlation between\nMallampati class and ease of light wand\nintubation in patients without known or\npotential problems relating to intubation.3\nMallampati class is a valuable estimate of\ntongue size relative to the capacity of the\noropharynx,23 and was modified to reliably\npredict difficult laryngoscopy with the\npatient sitting, head in extension, tongue\nout and with phonation.17 Differences in the\nmethods used to assess Mallampati class\nmay explain the discrepancies between dif-\nferent study findings. Alternatively, these\ndifferences may be due to variation in the\ndefinition of intubating time. The present\nstudy defined the beginning of intubation as\nthe moment when the device touched the\npatient's lip, whereas Hung et al3 used the\nTable 5.

In accordance\nwith our findings, others have noted failure\nof light wand-assisted intubation in overweight\nor obese patients.3,7,24 Intubation using the\nSurch-liteTM requires visualization of a central\nbright transillumination glow through the\nanterior neck rather than visualization of the\nlaryngeal structure. Magnetic resonance ima-\nging of fat deposits around the upper airway in\nobese patients revealed that these fat deposits\nwere anterior to the laryngopharyngeal air-\nspace and in submental regions.25 It is expected,\ntherefore, that intubating time would be pro-\nlonged with increasing BMI, because the\nincreased fat deposits in the neck mask the\nlight, and thereby increase the time taken to\nvisualize the transillumination.26 Patients with\nsevere obesity (BMI!35kg/m2) were therefore\nexcluded from the present study.\nNeck circumference is significantly corre-\nlated with visceral abdominal and neck fat.27\nLight wand-guided intubation has been\nshown to be difficult in obese patients and\nin those with short, thick necks.28 These\nproblems may be overcome by using simple\nsteps, such as extending the neck by placing a\nsupport under the shoulder, using a brighter\nlight source, and switching off or dimming\nthe operating room lights when neces-\nsary.6,7,11 Transillumination of the light\nwand at the neck can also be enhanced by\nadjustment of the bent length or angle of the\nlight wand against the wall of the trachea.20\nSore throat and hoarseness are common\ncomplaints after laryngoscopy and endotra-\ncheal intubation.21 Since light wand-guided\nintubation is performed without visualiza-\ntion of the laryngeal structures, it would be\nexpected to result in airway complications\nmore frequently than laryngoscopic intub-\nation. Sore throat has been shown to occur\nless frequently after light wand-guided\nintubation than laryngoscopic intubation\ngesting that the former is less traumatic than\nthe latter. The incidence of throat discom-\nfort was higher in the present study than in\nother studies;3 this is because we included\nmild degrees of discomfort, most of which\nwould not have been regarded as true\nsymptoms in routine practice. The incidence\nTable 6.

Thirdly, we excluded patients with\nknown upper airway abnormalities because\nthese are absolute contraindications to the\nblind light wand technique.6 As a result, our\nfindings may not be applicable to patients with\nknown abnormalities. Finally, all intubations\nwere performed by a single anaesthetist, and\nour data may therefore be biased towards the\nexpertise of that operator. Patients were\nunintentionally sampled so that the likelihood\nof a difficult airway was dispersed throughout\nthe study period, however. In addition, the\nanaesthetist was very experienced in light\nwand intubation.\nIn conclusion, the ease of intubation using\na light wand (Surch-liteTM) is influenced by\nepiglottis length. In addition, high laryngo-\nscopic grade and high BMI in male and female\npatients, and high Mallampati class and neck\ncircumference in male patients, may compli-\ncate light wand-guided tracheal intubation.\nRadiological evaluation may be useful for\npreoperative assessment of patients undergo-\ning endotracheal intubation with light wand.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
