Ursano, MD; Maria Petukhova, PhD; Ronald C. Kessler, PhD\nContext: Uncertainty exists about the prevalence, se-\nverity, and correlates of mental disorders among people\nexposed to Hurricane Katrina.\nObjective: To estimate the prevalence and associa-\ntions between DSM-IV anxiety-mood disorders and hur-\nricane-related stressors separately among prehurricane\nresidents of the New Orleans metropolitan area and the\nremainder of the areas in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mis-\nsissippi affected by Katrina.\nDesign: Community survey.\nSetting and Participants: A probability sample of 1043\nEnglish-speaking prehurricane residents of the areas af-\nfected by Hurricane Katrina was administered via tele-\nThe survey assessed hurricane-related stressors and\nscreened for 30-day DSM-IV anxiety-mood disorders.\nMain Outcome Measures: The K6 screening scale of\nanxiety-mood disorders and the Trauma Screening Ques-\ntionnaire scale for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),\nboth calibrated against blinded structured clinical reap-\npraisal interviews to approximate the 30-day preva-\nlence of DSM-IV disorders.\nResults: Prehurricane residents of the New Orleans met-\nropolitanareawereestimatedtohavea49.1%30-daypreva-\nlence of any DSM-IV anxiety-mood disorder (30.3% esti-\nPTSD) in the remainder of the sample. The vast majority\nof respondents reported exposure to hurricane-related\nstressors. Extent of stressor exposure was more strongly\nrelated to the outcomes in the New Orleans metropolitan\narea subsample than the remainder of the sample. The\nstressors most strongly related to these outcomes were\nphysical illness/injury and physical adversity in the New\nOrleans metropolitan area subsample and property loss in\nthe remainder of the sample. Sociodemographic corre-\nlates were not explained either by differential exposure or\nreactivity to hurricane-related stressors.\nConclusions: The high prevalence of DSM-IV anxiety-\nmood disorders, the strong associations of hurricane-\nrelated stressors with these outcomes, and the indepen-\ndence of sociodemographics from stressors argue that the\npractical problems associated with ongoing stressors are\nwidespread and must be addressed to reduce the preva-\nlence of mental disorders in this population.\nral disasters lead to increased\nprevalence of mental illness in the\nmostincreasesareinthelowerhalf\nof this range.3-8 Much of the between-\ndisaster variation is likely due to differen-\ntial disaster severity and exposure,9 as in-\ndicatedbythefactthatstudiesofpeoplewho\nexperienced devastating loss in major natu-\nral disasters consistently document high\nprevalence of mental illness.1,10 Assess-\nment of individual stressors in natural di-\nsasters is nonetheless challenging, and our\nunderstanding of their effects on postdisas-\nter mental illness remains limited.\nHurricane Katrina was the worst natu-\nral disaster in the United States in the past\n75 years, creating a disaster region as large\nas Great Britain, killing more than 1000\nvast devastation would lead us to expect a\nhigh prevalence of mental illness among\npeople who lived through Katrina. Avail-\nable evidence is consistent with this expec-\nsearch has yet considered the scope or\nvariety of stressors experienced or the role\nplayed by disaster-related stressors in the\nmental illness of people who lived through\nKatrina. Such an investigation has the po-\ntential to be important in targeting inter-\nvention efforts, especially because Katrina\nexposed people to a wide variety of stress-\nors,suchascommunitydisruption,jobloss,\nand property loss,15 many of which still per-\nsist 2 years after the hurricane.\nWe examined the prevalence of hurri-\ncane-related stressors and their associa-\ntions with screening measures of DSM-IV\nanxietyandmooddisordersusingdatafrom\nAuthor Affiliations are listed at\nthe end of this article.\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\ntheHurricaneKatrinaCommunityAdvisoryGroup(CAG),\na representative sample of 1043 prehurricane residents of\nthe areas in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi directly\naffected by Katrina who agreed to participate in a series of\ntracking surveys over several years to assess need for ser-\nvices and the pace of recovery efforts. Based on the much\nmore devastating nature of the disaster in the 7 parishes\ndefined by the Census Bureau as the New Orleans metro-\npolitan area (henceforth New Orleans metro) than in the\nremainder of the hurricane area, we consider results sepa-\nrately in each of these 2 subsamples.\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nThe CAG target population was English-speaking adult (aged\n18 years) prehurricane residents of the counties (in Ala-\nbama and Mississippi) and parishes (in Louisiana) defined by\nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as di-\nrectly affected by Hurricane Katrina.16 Prehurricane residents\nof these areas were eligible for the sample regardless of whether\nthey were in these areas at the time of the hurricane and re-\ngardless of the extent to which they or their property were af-\nfected by the hurricane. Census data suggest that only about\n1% of this population was unable to speak English,17 suggest-\ning that the restriction of the sample to English speakers did\nnot introduce major bias into the sample.\nRespondents were selected from 3 sampling frames: the tele-\nphone numbers (land lines and cell phones) of the roughly 1.4\nmillion families that applied for assistance from the American Red\nCross(ARC);arandom-digitdial(RDD)telephoneframeofhouse-\nholds in the areas affected by the hurricane; and a supplemental\nsample of hotels that housed FEMA-supported evacuees. Sur-\n5 to 7 months after the hurricane. As noted earlier, prehurricane\nresidents of New Orleans metro were oversampled.\nAlthough the use of RDD might seem impractical in a popu-\nlation where many people evacuated, evacuation was much more\ncommon in the New Orleans metro than the remainder of the\naffected areas. Furthermore, many evacuees had returned as of\nthe time of the survey. Random-digit dial was useful in con-\ntacting these nonevacuees and returned evacuees. The vast ma-\njority of evacuees, in comparison, applied to the ARC for as-\nsistance and could be traced through contact information\nprovided in the ARC applications for assistance. Other evacu-\nees could be traced in the RDD sample through a call-\nforwarding service set up by Bell South in the wake of the hur-\nricane, which forwarded calls to phone numbers anywhere in\nthe country as requested by the person in whose name the pre-\nhurricane phone was registered. More details on sampling and\nadjustment for overlap of the frames are reported elsewhere.18\nThe sample of potential respondents we were able to con-\ntact and screen for eligibility represented 64.9% of those we at-\ntempted to reach. This low contact-screening rate reflects the\nspecial difficulties locating people after the massive disrup-\ntion caused by Katrina. Screening-survey respondents were in-\nformed that joining the CAG required a commitment to par-\nticipate in a number of follow-up surveys over several years and\nto provide tracing information if they moved. Screening-\nsurvey respondents were asked to consider these require-\nments carefully before agreeing because we wanted all respon-\ndents to participate in subsequent surveys. The 1043 respondents\nwho agreed were administered the baseline CAG survey, the\nresults of which are presented here. These respondents repre-\nsent 41.9% of those we attempted to reach. This could have been\nincreased up as much as 64.9% (ie, all the screening-survey re-\nspondents) if we had not required a commitment for long-\nterm involvement in the CAG, but we felt that this commit-\nment was needed because a central aim of the CAG was to track\nchanges in adjustment over time.\nScreening questionnaires administered to the full screen-\ning sample showed that those who did not join the CAG were\nsimilar to respondents on all sociodemographic variables but\nhad a somewhat higher level of self-reported hurricane-\nrelated stress exposure than CAG members (assessed by ask-\ning respondents to rate their hurricane-related stress expo-\nsure on a 0-10 scale where 0 meant \"no stress at all\" and 10\nmeant \"the most stress you can imagine a person having\") and\nmore psychological distress than CAG members (assessed with\na short series of questions about frequency of common anxiety-\nmood symptoms, responses to which were summed and normed\nto a 0-10 theoretical range). The median and interquartile range\n(IQR)(25th-75thpercentiles)ofreportedhurricane-relatedstress\nof reported psychological distress were 2.9 (IQR, 1.2-4.4) among\nbers. A weight was applied to the CAG data to adjust for these\nresponse biases. A within-household probability of selection\nweight was also used along with a poststratification weight to\nadjust for residual discrepancies between the CAG and the 2000\ncensus population on a range of social, demographic, and pre-\nhurricane housing variables. The consolidated CAG sample\nweight, finally, was trimmed to increase design efficiency based\non evidence that trimming did not significantly affect the es-\ntimated prevalence of anxiety-mood disorders.\nMEASURES\nHurricane-Related Stressors\nThe survey included 29 structured questions developed based\non pilot interviews about hurricane-related stressors. In addi-\ntion, we asked an open-ended question--\"What would you say\nare currently your most serious practical problems caused by\nKatrina?\"--in an effort to discover any common stressors not\ncoveredinthestructuredquestions.Itshouldbenotedthatsome\nrespondents,especiallyevacueestosouthTexas,weresubsequently\nexposed to Hurricane Rita. To capture information about these\nexperiences,weaskedallrespondentswhethertheywereexposed\nto Rita, and if so, we asked about stressors experienced in either\nhurricane. The full text of the interview schedule that includes\nthe complete set of stressor questions is available elsewhere.18\nTen stressors emerged as sufficiently common to be con-\nsidered in this analysis. Four were traumatic stressors in the\nsense specified in the DSM-IV for a diagnosis of posttraumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD): experiences that involved serious risk\nof death, death of a loved one (family member or close friend),\nvictimization (burglary, robbery, physical assault, or sexual as-\nsault) due to lawlessness after the storm, and victimization of\na loved one. The other 6 were for the most part nontraumatic\nstressors: physical illness or injury caused or exacerbated by\nthe storm, extreme physical adversity (eg, sleeping in a church\nbasement, difficulty obtaining adequate food or clothing), ex-\ntreme psychological adversity (eg, living in circumstances where\nthe respondent had to use the toilet or change clothes without\nadequate privacy, exposure to threats of violence), major prop-\nerty loss, income loss, and ongoing difficulties associated with\nhousing (multiple moves or living in substantially worse post-\nhurricane than prehurricane housing). Some cases of the lat-\nter 6 stressors were described by respondents in ways that im-\nplied that the stressors might have been traumatic (eg, a life-\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nthreatening injury, a threat of fatal violence), but no attempt\nwas made to distinguish these cases from nontraumatic stress-\nors because the open-ended reports of these events were often\ntoo imprecise to make this distinction clearly.\nMental Illness\nThe K6 scale of nonspecific psychological distress19 was used\nto screen for DSM-IV anxiety disorders within 30 days of the\ninterview.20 Scores range from 0 to 24. Two independent vali-\ndation studies found the K6 to have an area under the receiver\npredicting diagnoses of mental illness based on comprehen-\nsive diagnostic interviews. Based on previous K6 validation and\nusing the definition of the terms from SAMHSA (Substance\nAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration), scores of\n13 to 24 were classified probable serious mental illness (SMI)\nwhile scores of 8 to 12 were classified probable mild/moderate\nmental illness (MMI) and scores of 0 to 7 were classified prob-\nable noncases. The designation of MMI represents respon-\ndents who were estimated to meet criteria for a DSM-IV anxiety-\nmood disorder but not SMI. Previous research has shown that\nMMI is of considerable public health importance because of its\nhigh prevalence, burden, and risk of transition to SMI.23 A small\nclinical reappraisal study of 5 respondents selected randomly\nfrom each of these 3 K6 categories (SMI, MMI, noncase) with\nthe Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)24 con-\nfirmed K6 classifications for 14 of 15 respondents. The excep-\ntion was a respondent classified as having SMI by the K6 but\nMMI by the SCID based on a global assessment of functioning\n(GAF) score of 65 (a GAF score of 0-60 is required to diag-\nnose SMI). These results, although based on only a small sample,\nsuggest that the K6 has excellent psychometric properties (es-\ntimated in the SCID sample weighted to adjust for the sample-\nwide K6 distribution), including sensitivity (1.0 for SMI, 0.90\nfor MMI, and 1.0 for either SMI to MMI) and specificity (1.0).\nGiven the special importance of PTSD in trauma situa-\ntions, a separate PTSD screen was included based on the 12-\nitemTraumaScreeningQuestionnaire(TSQ),25 avalidatedscreen\nfor PTSD.26 Our version differed from the original TSQ in using\ndimensional response options rather than a simple yes-no re-\nsponse format to assess 30-day symptom frequency (never, less\nthan once a week, about once a week, 2 to 4 days a week, and\nmost every day). A clinical reappraisal study was carried out\nto calibrate TSQ responses to DSM-IV PTSD with 30 respon-\ndents judged possible cases and 10 randomly selected others.\nA cutpoint on the factor-based 0-to-42 scale of TSQ responses\nmate the SCID PTSD prevalence in the weighted (to adjust for\noversampling of screened positives) clinical reappraisal sample.\nSensitivity (0.89), specificity (0.93), and area under the re-\nceiver operating characteristic curve (0.91) were all excellent\nfor this dichotomous screen.\nSociodemographic Controls\nWe examined associations of K6 and TSQ approximations of\nDSM-IV diagnoses with several sociodemographic variables: age,\nsex, race/ethnicity, family income in the year before the hurri-\ncane, education, prehurricane marital status, and prehurricane\nand 60 years or older. Race/ethnicity was coded non-Hispanic\nwhite,non-Hispanicblack,andother(largelyHispanicandAsian).\nFamily income was coded in quartiles where low was defined as\nless than or equal to 0.5 of the population median on the ratio of\nper-tax income to number of family members while low-average\nwas defined 0.5 through 1.0 on the same ratio; high-average,\n1.0 through 3; and high, 3 on this ratio. Years of education\nwere coded in 4 categories: 0 to 11, 12 (high school graduate),\n13 to 15, and 16 (college graduate). Marital status was coded\nmarried (including cohabiting, excluding separated), never mar-\nried,andpreviouslymarried(separated,widowed,divorced).Em-\nployment status, finally, was coded employed (including self-\nemployed and full-time students), homemaker, retired, and other\n(largely unemployed and disabled).\nEstimated prevalence of DSM-IV disorders and hurricane-\nrelated stressors were examined with cross-tabulations that dis-\ntinguished prehurricane residents of the New Orleans metro\nfrom the remainder of the sample. The effects of sociodemo-\ngraphic variables, hurricane-related stressors, and their inter-\nactions in predicting the estimates of DSM-IV disorders were\nexamined using logistic regression analysis.27 Logistic regres-\nsion coefficients and their standard errors were exponentiated\nto create odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%\nCIs) for ease of interpretation. Because the data were weighted,\nthe Taylor series linearization method28 was used to calculate\ndesign-based significance tests. Multivariate significance was\ncalculated using Wald 2 tests based on design-corrected co-\nefficient variance-covariance matrices. Statistical significance\nwas evaluated using 2-sided .05-level tests.\nRESULTS\nThe estimated prevalence of any 30-day DSM-IV anxiety-\nmood disorder based on the K6 was 31.2% in the total\nsample (Table 1) and significantly higher among pre-\nhurricane residents of the New Orleans metro (49.1%)\nApproximately one-third of respondents who screened\npositive for a DSM-IV anxiety-mood disorder were clas-\nsified as having probable SMI (11.3%) and the other two-\nthirds as having probable MMI (19.9%).

The\nstrongest ORs in the New Orleans metro were for low\nincome and other employment status with PTSD (4.0-\n5.3), whereas the strongest ORs in the remainder of the\nsample were for low education, low income, other em-\nployment status, and being unmarried with PTSD (4.7-\n17.7). Although some of the significant sociodemo-\ngraphic predictors of estimated SMI or MMI had different\nassociations with estimated PTSD than with other esti-\nmated anxiety-mood disorders, these associations were\ninconsistent across geographic subsamples.\nSTRESSORS\nThe vast majority of respondents both in the New Or-\nleans metro (91.9%) and in the remainder of the sample\negories of hurricane-related stressors (Table 3). New\nOrleans metro respondents reported a higher preva-\nlence of each stressor than respondents in the remain-\nder of the sample. The 2 most frequently reported stress-\nors were housing adversity (71.7% in the New Orleans\nmetro; 34.1% in the remainder of the sample; z=8.6,\nthreatening experience) of respondents.\nBecause high intercorrelations among stressors made it\ndifficult to assess the separate effects of individual stress-\nors in predicting estimated mental disorders, we evalu-\nated a series of logistic regression models that included\nadditive and interactive effects of exposure to multiple\nstressors (Table 4). Model 1 included only sociodemo-\ngraphic predictors. Model 2 then added information about\nnumber of hurricane-related stressors, ignoring type of\nstressor. Information about number of stressors was sig-\nnificantly related to the outcomes in all but 1 instance\n(other probable anxiety-mood disorders in the sub-\nsample exclusive of the New Orleans metro; 2\nP=.06). We then evaluated a series of 10 models, each\nadding 1 of the 10 stressors to model 2 to determine\nwhether type of stressor predicted the outcomes net of\nnumber of stressors. (Detailed results are not reported\nbut are available on request.) Three of these 10 were sig-\nnificant: physical illness/injury and physical adversity in\nthe New Orleans metro and property loss in the remain-\nder of the sample. When these significant adversities were\nadded to model 2, the best-fitting specification included\na single predictor to distinguish respondents exposed to\n1 or more stressors vs none plus separate predictors for\nTable 3.

The latter model\n(model 3) improved significantly on model 2. We next\nconsidered a model that allowed for interactions among\npairs of stressors (model 4). No significant interactions\nof this type were found. We also examined the ORs in\nmodel 4 for evidence of a consistently strong substan-\ntive pattern because the 44 df test (all logically possible\npairs among the 10 stressors minus 1 df for the global\ncount of stressors) might have failed to detect substan-\ntively important patterns in a small number of pairs. No\nsuch evidence was found.\nThe best-fitting model 3 shows that physical illness/\ninjury and physical adversity are associated with in-\ncreased odds of the outcomes in the New Orleans metro\n(2.8-7.9) while financial loss is associated with increased\nodds in the remainder of the sample (2.8-5.6) (Table 5).\nThe ORs for other stressors are 3.6-6.3 in the New Or-\nleans metro and 1.5-1.8 in the remainder of the sample.\nThe ORs are consistently higher in the New Orleans me-\ntro than the remainder of the sample with the exception\nof a higher OR associated with property loss in predicting\nestimated PTSD in the remainder of the sample.\nAnalyses were conducted to determine whether the sig-\nnificant sociodemographic associations documented in\nTable 2 could be explained by differential exposure to\nhurricane-related stressors. They could not. (Detailed re-\nsults are not reported but are available on request.) In-\ndeed, 22 of the 27 statistically significant ORs in Table 2\nremained significant at the .05 level after introducing con-\ntrols for the stressors. The other previously significant\nORs only changed modestly in substantive terms.\nWe also evaluated the possibility that the adverse ef-\nfects of the hurricane-related stressors vary across socio-\ndemographic subsamples. To increase statistical power, we\ncombinedthesignificantstressorsfromTable5intoasingle\nmeasure by generating individual-level predicted prob-\nabilities of the outcomes based on the coefficients in model\n3. This summary measure was used in interaction with the\nsociodemographic variables.

Comparing these estimates\nwith other postdisaster samples is challenging because\nfew previous studies either attempted to sample com-\nplete populations affected by large disasters or compre-\nhensively assessed disaster-related stressors. However, to\nthe extent that comparisons allow, it appears that the pro-\nportion of people experiencing hurricane-related stress-\nors after Katrina was substantially higher than after other\nAlthough the hurricane-related stressors assessed here\nwere significant predictors of estimated anxiety-mood dis-\norders, the stressors with the highest ORs were different\nin the New Orleans metro (physical illness/injury and\nphysical adversity) than the remainder of the sample\n(property loss). It is especially striking that the impact\nof property loss was less in the New Orleans metro than\nthe remainder of the hurricane area even though prop-\nerty loss was much more commonly experienced in the\nNew Orleans metro than the remainder of the hurricane\narea. One possible explanation for this difference is that\npersonal property loss might have been experienced as\nless stressful in a situation where, as in the New Orleans\nmetro, property loss was the norm in the population. Or\nit might be that evacuation and physical displacement,\nwhich occurred to the vast majority of prehurricane resi-\ndents of the New Orleans metro, created a context in\nwhich property loss had much less of an emotional effect\nthan in the rest of the hurricane area. It is also possible\nthat the subjective stressfulness of property loss was less-\nened in the context of the situation in the New Orleans\nmetro, where many people were exposed to even worse\nstressors, such as death and injury and extreme physi-\ncal adversity. But these are merely speculations. The only\ncertain conclusion that can be drawn from the results re-\ngarding variation in the relative effects of specific stress-\nors in New Orleans and the remainder of the hurricane\narea is that we have much more to learn about the ways\nin which multiple exposures and disaster context influ-\nence the effects of individual disaster-related stressors.\nThefindingsthatwomen,youngpeople,andpeoplewith\nlow socioeconomic status were at comparatively high risk\nof anxiety-mood disorders are consistent with previously\ndocumented correlates of mental illness after disasters9,31\nand other traumas.35 Importantly, though, these same as-\nsociations are found in community epidemiological sur-\nveys in the absence of disasters, suggesting that these as-\nsociationsmightberelatedtopreexistingmentaldisorders.14\nConsistent with this possibility, these sociodemographic\nassociations were not explained by exposure to hurricane-\nrelated stressors. Nor did we find evidence that the asso-\nciations of hurricane-related stressors with estimated anxi-\nety-mood disorders differ meaningfully in subsamples\ndefined by these sociodemographic factors.\nThe finding that Hispanic individuals and people of\nother minorities exclusive of non-Hispanic black had sig-\nnificantly lower estimated prevalence of anxiety-mood\ndisorders than non-Hispanic white individuals is diffi-\ncult to interpret. Previous research has found elevated\nprevalence of postdisaster mental illness among His-\npanic people,36 although this was largely Puerto Rican\nand Dominican individuals whereas the prehurricane His-\npanic people in the Katrina area were largely Mexican-\nAmerican. However, caution is needed in interpreting this\nfinding, because the number of respondents in our mi-\nnority subsample is quite small (35 respondents) and in-\ncludes Asian as well as Hispanic individuals. Future re-\nsearch will need much larger samples to investigate ethnic\ndifferences in disaster response, noting that elevated preva-\nlence among Hispanic people could well vary substan-\ntially among Mexican-American people compared with\nother segments of the Hispanic population.\nThe results lead to 4 conclusions. First, the stressors\nconsidered here appear to have played a critical role in\nthe high prevalence of hurricane-related anxiety-mood\ndisorders. Second, the fact that the associations be-\ntween hurricane-related stressors and estimated anxiety-\nmood disorders were stronger in the New Orleans me-\ntro than the remainder of the hurricane area suggests that\nundetermined vulnerability or contextual factors were\npresent in the New Orleans metro that remain under-\nstood. Third, the observation that hurricane-related\nstressor exposure was widespread and comparable across\nsociodemographic subsamples means that the impact of\nthe hurricane on mental health was widespread rather\nthan concentrated in any one particular segment of the\npopulation. This, in turn, suggests that efforts to ad-\ndress the problem of increased mental illness in the wake\nof the hurricane must address the needs of persons in all\nsegments of society rather than target specific popula-\ntion segments. This may be particularly challenging for\nprehurricane residents of the New Orleans metro, many\nof whom are now living throughout the country. Fourth,\nevidence that avoidable stressors associated with the slow\ngovernment response to Hurricane Katrina (eg, physi-\ncal adversity) had important implications for the men-\ntal health of people who lived through Katrina argues\nstrongly for the importance of efficient provision of prac-\ntical and logistical assistance in future disasters, not only\non humanitarian grounds, but also as a way to minimize\nthe adverse mental health effects of disasters.\nAuthor Affiliations: Department of Epidemiology, Uni-\nversity of Michigan School of Public Health (Dr Galea),\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association.
