    "abstract": "Abstract\nRationale: Neuroimaging and clinical studies have defined human sporadic cerebral small vessel disease but the patho-\nphysiology remains relatively poorly understood. To develop effective therapies and preventative strategies, we must\nbetter understand the heterogeneity and development of small vessel disease at a cellular level.\nHypothesis: Small vessel disease lesions as seen on neuroimaging have specific neuropathological correlates.\nMethods and design: Standard histological samples are taken from strategic areas of the brain typically affected by\nsmall vessel disease, in cases with a range of disease from mild to severe and controls. Tissue is formalin fixed, scanned\nusing 7-tesla magnetic resonance imaging and processed for histology. Histological slides are digitalized then registered\nwith the corresponding magnetic resonance image. Small vessel disease burden is assessed and lesions are precisely\nidentified on the ex vivo imaging and microscopy independently then compared. The tissue can be interrogated using\nmultiple magnetic resonance sequences and histological methods targeting the gliovascular unit.\nStudy outcomes: The primary outcome is identifying and defining the cellular characteristics of small vessel disease\nlesions compared to imaging. Secondary outcomes are related to obtaining information about abnormalities of protein\nexpression in the gliovascular unit, defining groups of small vessel disease severity in our cohorts for future analysis and\ndeveloping a reliable, reproducible protocol for accurate radiological\u00adhistological lesion comparison, which can be\napplied to other neurological diseases in the future.\nDiscussion: Comprehensive, precise pathological\u00adradiological\u00adclinical correlations in small vessel disease will provide\ngreater insight into associations and pathophysiology underlying magnetic resonance imaging findings in normal- and\nabnormal-appearing tissue, ex vivo and in vivo.\n",

They are\nlimited to tissue taken at the time of death. Much\nof the pathological literature has focused on the\nlacune, which is relatively easily identified at autopsy,\nbut is descriptive.6 Attempting to understand the\npathophysiology is difficult;7 pathological studies, espe-\ncially with imaging correlations, are few,8,9 with little\ninformation on histopathological changes in and\naround SVD lesions seen on imaging and whether\nlesions vary by brain region.10 Systematic reviews of\nstudies comparing post-mortem imaging and histology\nappearances8,11 reveal just three studies correlating 79\nmicrobleeds identified on magnetic resonance imaging\nwhile one other paper described three cases with at\nleast three microbleeds.15 Five papers studied lacunes:\ncases and at least four lacunes,18 one with two cases\nand unknown numbers of lacunes19 and one study\ndescribing lacune appearances without any details of\nnumbers of cases or lesions.20 There are greater num-\nbers of studies looking at white matter hyperintensities\n(WMH), but their pathophysiology has not yet been\nAll previous post-mortem studies aiming to charac-\nterize SVD lesion appearances image whole brains,\nwhole hemispheres or brain slices (manuscript in prep-\naration). Some studies have attempted to provide more\ndetailed localization by scanning both whole brains and\nindividual macroscopic coronal brain slices.10,23 This is\nof value when assessing overall disease burden, but\nlesion locations are typically approximated using gross\nlandmarks24 or tissue is sampled broadly from areas\nidentified on imaging, precluding accurate comparison\nof individual lesions.25 As such these studies cannot con-\nfidently correlate histology with imaging. This may, at\nleast partly, explain the limited understanding of SVD\npathogenesis, the lesion heterogeneity at a cellular level,\nand the modest associations described so far between\nimaging and clinical features.8\nWe developed a protocol to precisely compare the\nhistological and radiological features of SVD in human\npost-mortem brain tissue, to test the hypothesis that\ndifferent SVD lesions identified and defined on MRI\nrepresent specific histological, lesions. We aim to use\nthis information to define the histological lesions of\nSVD and compare it to clinical and in vivo radiological\ndata. In the future we will further explore the patho-\nphysiological mechanisms using targeted genetic\nstudies, with the intention of ultimately being able to\nrefine SVD animal models and identify therapeutic tar-\ngets and preventative strategies.\nMethods\nDesign\nThis is a prospective observational study using tissue from\nthree cohorts representing severe SVD (Lothian study of\nINtraCerebral Haemorrhage, Pathology, Imaging and\nNeurological Outcome, LINCHPIN2), normal aging\nnormal to severe SVD, including lesions in evolution)\nand controls (no or only mild SVD) within the Medical\nResearch Council (MRC) Edinburgh Brain Bank.\nStudy population\nInclusion criteria\ncohort criteria.\n. Controls: sudden, unexpected, non-suspicious deaths\nwith no known neurological disease in life.\nExclusion criteria\n. Time from death to autopsy >5 days.\n. Next of kin decline authorization.\nPost-mortem neuropathological examination. A standard\nneuropathological post-mortem examination is carried\nout by at least one neuropathologist according to Brain\nBank protocols (unpublished), extended for this study\nto include areas typically affected by SVD on MRI.\nThe brain is weighed, the cerebellum and brainstem\nare removed and 1 cm thick coronal sections are\nmade. The cerebellum is sliced sagittally and the brain-\nstem axially. Samples approximately 2 \u00c2 2\u00c21 cm are\ntaken from defined neuroanatomical areas (Table 1).\nTissue from the left cerebral hemisphere only is used,\nas SVD is usually considered symmetrical.5 The right\nhemisphere will also be studied in 10% of cases, ran-\ndomly chosen, to ensure this symmetry is true in\nour population. Each sample is bisected in the same\nplane as it was cut; one piece is placed in a plastic\ncassette and fixed in 10% unbuffered formalin in a\nplastic tube for 24\u00ad72 hours before MR scanning and\nhistology (Figure 1). The complementary sample is\nfrozen in nitrogen vapor for long-term storage at\n\u00c0150C to support future research applications.\nPost-mortem magnetic resonance imaging. Through\npilot work, we developed the most practical approach\nto satisfy both our requirements to make precise histo-\npathological comparisons and to obtain excellent\nInternational Journal of Stroke, 0(0)\n2 International Journal of Stroke 0(0)\nquality images. To minimize air bubble artefact, the lid\nof the container is secured under formalin cover and left\nto stand for 5 minutes, it is tapped to release trapped air\nand then the lid is re-secured under formalin. The\ncassettes are held by pieces of plastic at the sides with\nempty cassettes at each end to prevent movement.\nThe tissue is scanned overnight in a 7T small-bore\nrodent MRI scanner (Agilent Technologies, Yarnton,\nUK) equipped with a 400 mT/m gradient insert with\nsequences similar to those used in vivo to detect evi-\ndence of SVD (Table 2). The long acquisition time\n(135 minutes) increases sensitivity to small subtle\nfeatures. For all scans (except the scout), the field of\nview is 60 \u00c2 60 mm, the slice thickness is 1 mm with no\n30 slices are obtained across the cassettes containing\nthe tissue. For the scout scan, the field of view is\nin three planes. Shimming is done on the entire plastic\ncontainer using an automated routine for global shim-\nming followed by manual adjustment of the shim coils.\nThis optimizes the homogeneity of the magnetic field to\navoid artefact on images. Quality of shim was checked\nby measuring the 50% linewidth of the H2\nO peak in an\nunlocalized 1H spectrum. Typical values were 50\u00ad60 Hz.\nWe are not aware of any established grading systems\nfor imaging tissue blocks and grading the SVD burden\ntherein. We have therefore adapted existing protocols\nfor assessing SVD in whole brain MRI5 which were\ndeveloped, validated and applied in our studies of\nhave been tested in these studies over the past two dec-\nades. Our existing protocols for assessing SVD on MRI\nare now included in international standard definitions.5\nFigure 1. Small tissue samples are placed in plastic cassettes for standard histological processing (a). Eight cassettes are stacked in\na plastic container and fixed (b) before scanning in a small bore 7T MRI scanner (c) (gradient echo scout). Tissue is only placed in\nthe cassettes where the gradient coil is mostly linear, empty cassettes at each end and folded plastic along the length of the stack\nprevent movement within the container.\nTable 1.

After scanning, the formalin-fixed tissue is\nparaffin-embedded in its entirety and sections are\nstained based on previously published data from histo-\nlogical and imaging literature to assess the gliovascular\nunit and general neuroinflammatory and glial responses\n(Table 3). SVD burden,32 Alzheimer's disease path-\ngraded using published, validated systems. Slides are\ndigitally scanned using the Xeiss Axioscan system.\nImage registration and analysis. The MR slice that best\nmatches the histology section is selected visually, and\nthe corresponding slice for each MR sequence is trans-\nformed into NIfTI format.\nThe size of the histology image varies but is of the\norder of 10\u00ad20 thousand pixels in each dimension.\nTo facilitate registration, they are rescaled by a factor\nof 1/20 using a Mitchell\u00adNetravali kernel37 and con-\nverted to grey levels. To ensure successful registration,\nthe histology images need to be reoriented to match\nroughly the position of MR images, which might\ninvolve flipping the image around the x or y axis.\nThe histology samples are cut to be approximately rect-\nangular in shape and kept in alignment with the rect-\nangular cassettes. Due to the standardized nature of the\nhistological processing methods, there are only a\nlimited number of opportunities for it to be manipu-\nlated and rotated away from the position in which it\nwas scanned. Therefore, there are only four possible\norientations of the histology sample. The reorientation\nis done automatically by creating the four possible\norientations of the histology image (original, flipped\nin x, flipped in y, flipped in x and y), registering each\nto the T1-weighted image (detailed below) and calculat-\ning a similarity score (normalized mutual information)\nbetween the histology and MR in each case. The high-\nest similarity score corresponds to the best match\nbetween histology and the T1-weighted and therefore\npermits automatic selection of the correct histology\norientation. An image with the outline of the MR over-\nlaid on the histology is produced for each sample to\nenable a rapid visual confirmation of whether the regis-\ntration has been successful (Figure 2). The automatic\nreorientation gives a satisfactory registration in >85%\nof the cases, in the cases where it fails, the histology is\nreoriented manually before registration, which then\ncompletes successfully.\nAutomatic registration of MR to each histology\nimage is performed as follows. First, the T1-weighted\nimage is used to create a binary mask of the tissue using\nk-means clustering38 with three clusters. The binary\nmask was created by setting the pixels in the cluster\nof the maximum center to 1 and the remaining pixels\nin the image to zero. This mask is applied to all MR\nimages to exclude background signal and then cropped\nto the minimum field-of-view containing the tissue.\nTable 2.

All processing is performed in R (v. 3.4)\nwithin RStudio (v. 1.0), using the packages ``jpeg'',\n``divest'', ``mmand'', ``RNifti'', and ``RNiftyReg''.41\u00ad45\nThe registered images are visualized and SVD lesions\nidentified and described during grading are selected in\none modality and automatically identified in the other,\nTable 3.

The whole process from autopsy\nto lesions being compared takes about one week.\nBoth MR and histology quality are excellent; histology,\nin particular is unaffected by the scanning process\n(examples in Figures 2 and 3).\nIn establishing this protocol, we have carefully con-\nsidered how to minimize bias. All consecutive cases\ndonated to the brain bank that meet the specific\ncohort and brain bank criteria are coded and processed\nusing standardized procedures. Cases are batched until\nFigure 2.

An initial\n``quick check'' image is produced with the MR outline overlaid on the registered histology (c) to confirm successful registration.\nFeatures of interest are selected on any image using the blue crosshairs and the precise corresponding feature on the other images\nis identified automatically.

We estimate that\nabout 18 brains will be donated and can be scanned\nper annum for all three cohorts in total, based on\nFigure 3. The white matter vessel identified in Figure 2 is stained (Table 3) to interrogate the gliovascular unit and blood\u00adbrain\nbarrier (\u00c240 magnification). As the course of the vessel is followed on consecutive histological sections the distribution and pattern\nof pathology can also be described.\nInternational Journal of Stroke, 0(0)\nHumphreys et al. 7\nprevious years. We began scanning in 2015 and\nhave carried out this protocol in 53 cases so far; 21\nsevere SVD, 9 normal aging and 23 controls. Of\nthese, 25 have also had in vivo MRI or CT brain ima-\nging (17 severe SVD, 8 normal aging). In comparison\nwith existing literature, this sample is one of the largest\nto date, and the only one to precisely and systematically\nstudy the areas most affected by SVD on in vivo ima-\nging. It will allow for much greater depth of analysis\nregarding, for example, spatial variation in lesions,\nperilesional changes and severity of lesions. Numbers\nwill increase as we continue to scan cases and include\nnew cohorts; a population with symptomatic lacunar\nstroke46 and a subgroup of the Scottish Dementia\nResearch Interest Register47 with Alzheimer's disease\nhave recently been added.\nStatistical analyses. Specific statistical analyses will\ndepend on the distribution of the data; they will include\ndescriptive statistics for lesion prevalence and appear-\nances, and regression analyses for differences between\ngroups. We will choose a number of relevant features to\nstudy from the rich clinical, imaging and histological\ndata available.\nFor example, LBC1936 subjects have serial research-\nstandard MRI in life with detailed assessment of SVD\nfeatures including quantitative structural and func-\ntional analysis, medical histories and cognitive informa-\nincludes current cognition, medical history and recent\nin vivo imaging. This will enable us to study associ-\nations where information is currently missing; such\nas the burden of SVD lesions visible in life and the\nprevalence of matrix protein abnormalities; the rela-\ntionship between perivascular space visibility on\nMRI and numbers of active microglia; and confirm if\nthe health of the myelin and axons in apparently\nnormal tissue varies with the severity of WMH as is\nsuggested by in vivo MRI.48 Control cases have medical\nand social history available. However, by definition\nthey have had no neurological disease in life, have no\ncognitive impairment and therefore do not have in vivo\nimaging. We will be able to compare these data to the\nextent and severity of SVD assessed on the ex vivo\nimaging and histology. The extent of the analyses will\nbe decided based on the final number of cases obtained.\nInter-rater reliability will be assessed using weighted\nKappa statistics.\nAfter MRI and histology images are fully assessed,\ncases will be stratified into groups with and without\ncognitive impairment, by medical history and SVD\nburden, from none to severe. We will use the comple-\nmentary frozen tissue to make targeted studies of gene\nexpression differences between the groups. In particu-\nlar, the short tissue fixation period retains RNA and\nDNA integrity supporting novel techniques such as\nBaseScope, a modified, quantifiable in situ hybridization\ntechnique identifying transcripts at a single cell level.49\nData monitoring body, study organization, funding\nand ethics.

It has a\nlocal management group and a steering committee,\nboth of which include lay representation.\nDiscussion\nIn our current study, two cohorts, LBC1936 and\nLINCHPIN, have several important complementary\ncharacteristics relevant to SVD; and other cohorts are\nnow being added. The MRC Edinburgh Brain Bank is\na responsive tissue resource, ensuring tissue is fit for\nend-user needs, developed around existing clinical\ncohorts, with high brain donation rates within the clin-\nical cohorts.27,50 We employ targeted sampling with all\nresidual tissue being returned to the body, as donation\nof small tissue samples is less distressing to relatives\nthan whole organs.51 The Edinburgh Brain Bank is\npart of the UK Brain Bank Network, a coordinated\ngroup who have developed minimum diagnostic\nInternational Journal of Stroke, 0(0)\n8 International Journal of Stroke 0(0)\ndatasets, tissue handling protocols, and ethical and gov-\nernance standards across multiple UK brain banks.52\nData linkage is key to maximizing this resource, and\ntargeted post-mortem MRI adds to the data generated\nfrom each individual case.\nWe encountered several issues while developing this\nprotocol. Air bubbles within the tissue and plastic cas-\nsettes cause MR artefact and may be mistaken for, or\nmask, microbleeds on T2* sequences making it import-\nant to minimize their presence, as described. Previous\nstudies did not precisely match lesions on MR with\nhistological images due to differing slice thicknesses\nand resolutions. We obtain serial 1 mm MR slices\nthrough each tissue block, although this is of a different\norder of thickness to the histological sections (mm\nversus microns). To make the most accurate compari-\nson, the MR images are compared to corresponding\nhistological images and the most complementary are\nregistered. Formalin fixation of human brain tissue\nalters the MR properties of the tissue with time as the\nformalin diffuses into it.53 The use of small samples\nminimizes the difference in fixation between the deep\nand superficial tissue. T2 values of human brain tissue\nchange with duration of fixation but plateau between\n10 hours and five weeks.53 We have standardized tissue\nfixation to minimize fixation-induced variability\nbetween MR images. At 7T, tissue is vulnerable to\noverheating, which impairs tissue quality. Brain\nabsorbs more radiofrequency than other tissues and\nour samples are in a relatively small amount of forma-\nlin without in vivo mechanisms, such as vasodilation, to\ndissipate heat. The scanner bore is cooled to 22.6C but\nthis may not be sufficient. Our scanning protocols have\nbeen designed to maximize anatomic resolution and\nincrease the signal to noise ratio while avoiding over-\nheating. Temperature monitoring during scanning\nshowed a maximum 1.8C rise within the plastic tube,\nwhich would not affect tissue quality and heat artefact\nhas not been observed on histological examination.\nAs with many post-mortem studies, the number of\ncases available for study are relatively small. However,\nour study is one of the largest detailed post-mortem\nstudies of SVD, and benefits from detailed data linkage\nand well-characterized cohorts. In addition, we employ\nextensive sampling of each case, targeting areas particu-\nlarly affected by SVD and retaining complimentary\nfrozen tissue for further interrogation with genomic\ntechnologies. The specific areas studied may be refined\nin future depending on the specific disease or charac-\nteristic under investigation. Pilot work within our lab\nhas shown that formalin fixed paraffin-embedded tissue\nis not suitable for post-mortem imaging so retrospective\nimaging of cases with paraffin-embedded tissue is not\npossible. However, the histological protocol developed\nfrom the combined radiological\u00adhistological assessment\ncould be applied retrospectively to appropriate tissue\nwithin the Brain Bank with relevant clinical data,\nthereby further extending the sample size for future\nrelated work using biochemical and genetic methods.\nSVD lesions are well characterized on neuroimaging5\nand described on neuropathology (although not con-\nsistently);54 however, attempts to correlate the appear-\nances have found only modest associations.8 This may\nreflect variation in methodologies or true variation as\nsuggested in rodent models where it appears SVD may\nresult from multiple minor defects in different compo-\nnents of the neurovascular unit55 which we aim to study\nfurther with this protocol and future work. As a static\nassessment of a dynamic disease process, histopathological\nassessment may be limited; lesions at post-mortem in eld-\nerly patients are often end-stage. However, longitudinal\nassessments in life allow plotting of disease trajectories,\nand our initial work shows a gradation from subclinical,\nto lesions-in-evolution to severe lesions which will further\ninform interpretation of SVD pathophysiology. WMH in\nparticular may be more dynamic than previously appre-\nciated.21 Histopathological studies in humans have found\nprotein expression abnormalities within the gliovascular\nunit in subjects with WMH56 and in vivo imaging suggests\nblood\u00adbrain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and leakiness.30\nAlterations in the gliovascular unit are seen in an animal\nmodel prior to the onset of recordable hypertension.57\nSummary and conclusions\nThis protocol describes a new method to precisely\nassess and compare lesion appearances between brain\nMRI and histopathology to validate in vivo MRI find-\nings in and around SVD lesions, aiming to increase our\nunderstanding of SVD pathophysiology and facilitate a\nmeaningful clinical and radiological diagnosis. These\nmethods and tissue may also be used in other condi-\ntions where the pathophysiology is poorly understood\nsuch as autism or the neurological effects of type 2 dia-\nbetes mellitus, and to validate clinical and radiological\nassessments and diagnoses.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nVi\u00b4ctor Gonza\nInternational Journal of Stroke, 0(0)\nHumphreys et al. 9\nReferences\n1.
