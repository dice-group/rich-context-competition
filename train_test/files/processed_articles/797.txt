How Age and Gender\nAffect the Perceived Quality of Support\nfrom Family and Friends\nSusan A. Lynch, PhD1\nOver the past two decades there has been in-\ncreasing interest in the role social support plays in\nhelping people cope with life stress. Numerous stud-\nies have found that individuals who have a spouse,\nfriends, or family members who give them psycho-\nlogical and/or material support are healthier than those\nwithout such relationships (Cohen & Wills, 1985;\nUchino, Cacioppo, & Kiecolt-Glaser, 1996). Indeed,\nthe support supplied through social attachments with\nfamily and friends has been shown not only to di-\nrectly affect psychological adjustment (Sarason, Levin,\nbut also to provide a buffer that helps moderate the\ndetrimental effects of life stress on health and well-\nbeing (Seeman & Berkman, 1988; Smith, Fernengel,\nNevertheless, research assessing the role of social\nsupport in moderating the negative effects of life stress\nindicates that the effectiveness of such support de-\npends on many factors. These include the type and\namount of support provided, as well as the context\nsurrounding the support transaction and the re-\ncipient's satisfaction with the support (Antonucci, 1985;\ntionalizing of social support, often criticized as inad-\nequate (Thoits, 1982), has undergone a series of\nredefinitions and modifications in recent years. It has\nbecome increasingly evident that characteristics of sup-\nport quality are as important, if not more so, as those\nrelating to support quantity (Smith et al., 1994; Ward,\n1985). Social support is now generally conceived to\nbe a complex construct with at least three distinct\n\"\u00b7This article is adapted from a paper presented at the 48th Annual\nScientific Meeting of the Cerontological Society of America held in Los\nAngeles, CA in November 1995.

Despite this lack of clarity, there\nis growing evidence that two such characteristics - age\nand gender - affect support relationships in important\n& Lieberman, 1980; Frieze, Parsons, Johnson, Ruble,\nSpecifying how gender and age differentially affect\nvariations in social support is especially important in\nlight of the fact that the correlation between mental\nand physical health and social support variables has\noften been weaker than predicted (Antonucci, 1985).\nIndeed, research has consistently failed to find a\ncorrelation between interaction with family and posi-\ntive mental health outcomes in elderly samples (Ishii-\nKuntz, 1990). Even more alarming is the fact that, for\nfemales, there appears to be a negative correlation\nbetween support network size and satisfaction with\nsupport (Cohler & Lieberman, 1980; Kessler & McLeod,\nThis article investigates how gender is related to two\ndimensions of social support - type of relationship and\nperceived quality - and how these relations change\nacross age groups. The analyses focus on the direct\nand interaction effects of age level and gender on the\nrelative perceived quality of relationships with spouse,\nchildren, and friends/other relatives across six life stages.\nLiterature Review\nVaux (1985) states that research has consistently\nfound significant gender differences in friend and\nfamily relationships, and numerous other authors have\nnoted gender differences in the dimensions of sup-\nexample, adult women frequently report receiving\nmore support from friends and family members than\ndo men. Additionally, while women report having\nclose, intimate relationships with a few friends and\nfamily members, men are more likely to report hav-\ning casual relationships with many people (see Schultz,\nOverall, findings indicate that the social and family\nrelationships of women, when compared to those of\nmen, tend to exhibit more closeness and intimacy,\nand that women place a higher value on support reci-\nprocity. These findings have led some theorists to de-\nscribe the support relationships of women as \"qualita-\ntively superior\" to those of men (Antonucci, 1994).\nHowever, there is growing evidence that, in some\ncases, rather than buffering the negative effects of life\nstress, women's larger, more intimate support net-\nworks actually increase their vulnerability to the detri-\nmental effects of such stress (Antonucci, 1994; Kessler\nhigh level of involvement in the lives of significant\nothers, coupled with their role as the main providers\nof support to spouses, children, aging parents, and\nboth women and men friends, may lead them to ex-\nperience increased levels of distress when network\nneeds for support become too emotionally and/or\nIn contrast, men may be more likely to experience\na lack of adequate support, especially after a divorce\nor the death of a spouse. Indeed, one of the most\nstriking gender differences in the utilization of support\nis the fact that men focus heavily on one provider of\nsupport - their wives - whereas women most often\nAdditionally, Depner and Ingersoll-Dayton (1985)\nnote that women in middle and old age are more\nlikely to have close relationships outside the marital\nrelationship than are men in these age groups. This\nfinding is supported by Antonucci (1994), who states\nthat gender differences in support network size are\nthe result of the fact that older women define signifi-\ncantly more people as being \"so close, it is hard to\nimagine life without them.\"\nSocial exchange theorists point out that all relation-\nships incur certain costs to trie participants if they are\nto be maintained, and hold that both or all partici-\npants in a social relationship not only receive ben-\nefits, but also are subject to having demands made\nupon their physical and emotional resources (Rook,\n1992). Although social support relationships, by defi-\nnition, were conceived as only positive and beneficial\nin early literature, it has recently become evident that\nthese relationships can possess both positive and nega-\ntive features (Rook, 1992). Therefore, in examining the\nperception of quality of support from various relation-\nships across the life span, this research considers how\nsupport interactions can be beneficial and/or stressful\nfor both participants.\nDespite the numerous studies on gender differ-\nences, there have been few studies to date that have\nexamined social support from a life span perspective\nthat have explored age differences in support have\ntended to focus on cross-generational transactions,\npaying little attention to normative changes that\nmay occur in social support at different developmen-\ntal stages. There is evidence, however, that such\nchanges do occur, and that variations in the structure\nand perceived quality of social support is related to\nFor example, Cowan and Cowan (1992) note that\nyoung adults often become socially isolated when they\nmarry and start families. Indeed, the birth of the first\nchild often results in a significant decrease in social\ninteractions with nonparent friends and with co-\nworkers. Other studies have noted that middle-aged\nadults may experience increased stress when they\nare called upon to provide largely unreciprocated sup-\nport to both their children and their aging parents\nIn addition to the variations in social support re-\nlated directly to gender and age, it is important to\nrecognize that the interaction of these variables also\naffects the structure, function, and perceived quality\nof social support. For example, although it appears\nwomen are more distressed by unreciprocal relation-\nships than are men (Antonucci, 1994), it appears that\na desire for reciprocity in support relationships adds\nto women's levels of stress for different reasons at dif-\nferent points in the life span. Young adulthood is a\ntime when women often begin careers, marry, and\nstart having children. Although work relationships,\nother friendships, and partner relationships may pro-\nvide adequate support for women before they be-\ncome parents, these supportive relationships can be\ndisrupted by the birth of the first child (Cowan &\nCowan, 1992). This can result in a significant increase\nin stress, especially if the woman perceives her hus-\nband as nonsupportive. Thus, a young, new mother\nmay find her emotional and physical energy taxed\nby the demands of a new infant, who cannot recip-\nrocate, at the same time she is receiving less sup-\nport from others in her network due to a decrease in\ncontact.\nIn middle adulthood, however, unreciprocal rela-\ntionships may be stressful for a different reason. Dur-\ning this period, many close relationships are not re-\nciprocal in nature. Middle-aged women tend to be\nthe primary caretaker for their spouse, children, and\naging parents (Ingersoll-Dayton & Antonucci, 1988;\nthat these women will find themselves in a position\nof receiving less support than they provide to a large\nnumber of network members. Additionally, it may be\nthat the larger and closer the network, the more likely\nit is that these women will be faced with providing\nsupport to network members for whom they feel re-\nsponsible and from whom they cannot expect imme-\ndiate reciprocation.\nFor these reasons, it is likely that above and be-\nyond the direct effects gender and age have on\nvariation in social support, there is also a significant\neffect for the interaction of these variables. Although\nseveral studies have explored this interaction, few, if\nany, have done so from a life span perspective. This\nis important because it is likely that men and women\nwill perceive the quality and the demandingness of\ntheir support relationships differently at different age\nlevels.\nThese analyses not only examine the direct and in-\nteraction effects of both age and gender on the per-\nceived quality of social support, but build on previ-\nous research in two ways. First, these data present a\nunique opportunity to assess the perceptions of the\npositive support received from and trie demands\nmade by one's spouse, children, and friends/other rela-\ntives in relation to each other. This allows for a com-\nparison of how positive and/or stressful these relation-\nships are perceived to be. Additionally, by looking at\nthese perceptions across five age groups, we can be-\ngin to identify normative changes that may occur in\nmen's and women's perceptions of their support net-\nworks over the life span.\nStudy Question and Hypotheses\nThe question addressed here is whether age group,\ngender, and/or their interaction affect the relative per-\nceived quality of support received from three types of\nrelationships across the life span. The three types of\nrelationships examined are those with one's spouse,\none's children, and one's friends/other relatives.\nHypothesis I\nGiven previous research findings that indicate there\nare gender differences in all three dimensions of\nsocial support - structure, function, and perceived\nthe perception of positive support from these rela-\ntionships will vary on the basis of gender. Specifically,\nit is proposed that women will report receiving more\npositive support from their children and from friends/\nother relatives than will men, while men will report\nreceiving more positive support from their spouses than\nwill women.\nFurthermore, in assessing the perceived level of de-\nmands made by these relationships, it is hypothesized\nthat women will perceive all three types of relation-\nships as more demanding than will men. This is\nbased on findings that indicate women are called up-\non more often than men by network members for\nHypothesis II\nAlthough there is less known about the direct\neffect of age on the perceived quality of social sup-\nport relationships, studies that have been done (Ishii-\nhypothesis that age level, too, will evince a direct ef-\nfect on both the perception of positive support and\nthe perception of level of demandingness across these\nrelationships. Specifically, it is expected that there will\nbe a general increase in the perception of positive\nsupport across age groups, coupled with a general de-\ncrease in the perception of demandingness across these\nrelationships.\nAdditionally, given the largely unreciprocated na-\nture of a parent's relationship with his or her young\nand adolescent children, it is hypothesized that one's\nrelationship with one's children will be rated as pro-\nviding the least positive support, and as being the most\ndemanding, for younger respondents. However, it is\nexpected that both perceptions will change as age level\nincreases. Many elderly adults report receiving high\nlevels of support from their adult children, while few\nreport these relationships as being overly demanding\n(Isnii-Kuntz, 1990). Thus, it is likely that perception of\npositive support will increase with age level, while the\nperception of demandingness will decrease.\nHypothesis III\nIt is expected that there will be an interaction ef-\nfect of age level and gender. Given prior research find-\nings indicating that women are particularly vulnerable\nto feeling a decrease in positive support while experi-\nencing an increase in support demands at certain life\nstages (e.g., after the birth of their first child, during\nmiddle adulthood) (Cowan & Cowan, 1992; Ingersoll-\n1987), it is expected that there will be more variation\nin perception of positive support and level of demand-\ningness for women than for men across age groups.\nMethods\nSample\nThis research analyzes the main and interaction ef-\nfects of age level and gender on the relative perceived\nquality ot support received from one's spouse, chil-\ndren, and friends/other relatives across six adult de-\nvelopmental stages. This is a secondary analysis of data\ngathered as part of the larger Americans' Changing\nLives (ACL) data set collected by James S. House (1986\n& 1989). These data constitute the second wave in a\nnational longitudinal panel survey of people aged 27\nyears or older in the United States. Sampling con-\nsisted of a multistage stratified area probability sample,\nwith over sampling of those 60 years-of-age and older.\nData were collected during face-to-face interviews con-\nducted by interviewers trained at the Survey Research\nCenter in the Institute for Social Research at the Uni-\nversity of Michigan.\nA subsample of respondents from the larger study\nsample used in this research consisted of 2,867 Cau-\ncasian women and men aged 27 years and older. The\ndecision to control for racial differences by including\nonly Caucasian adults in the sample was based on re-\nsearch that indicates there are significant differences\nin the social support networks of African Americans\nand Caucasians (Lynch, in press; Petchers & Milligan,\nfocus of this research is on age and gender differ-\nences across the life span, and treating these popula-\ntions as homogenous is theoretically and methodo-\nlogically flawed, the decision was made to examine\nonly a Caucasian sample to control for the effect of\nrace.\nThe sample was further reduced as a function of\nthe comparative nature of this research which focuses\non the perception of quality of support across three\ntypes of relationships - with spouse, children, and friends/\nother relatives. The final sample consists of only those\nrespondents who reported having all three types of\nrelationships at the time of data collection, resulting\nin a final sample n of 1154. Table 1 presents a sum-\nmary of the sample divided by age and gender.\nOperational Definitions of Variables\nThe predictor variables used in this analysis were\nage, gender, and the interaction of these variables. In\norder to ascertain the effect of age, the continuous\nage variable in the original data set was divided into\nsix age groups based on the stages of adulthood\nidentified by Ishii-Kuntz (1990). The resulting six\ncategories were: i) young-adult: 27-30-years-old; ii)\nTable 1. Sample Divided by Age and Gender\nCender\nFemale\nSample n\nColumn %\nRow%\nSample %\nMale\nSample n\nColumn %\nRow %\nSample %\nColumn\nTotal n\nTotal %\nAge Level\nRow\nTotal\n98-years-old. Because there were no respondents in\nthe young-adult category who had all three types\nof relationships, this category was eliminated. For\nanalysis, the categorical variable gender was dummy\ncoded into a dichotomous variable with males coded\nas 1 and females coded as 2.\nPositive support was operationalized by replicating\nthe positive support indices created by House and\nKahn (1985) using equivalent items from ACL: Wave\n1. Respondents were asked to rate their spouse, their\nchildren, and their friends or other relatives separately\nin response to the items \"(this person) makes me feel\nloved and cared for\" and \"(this person) is willing to\nlisten to me.\" A positive support index was then\nformed for each relationship by averaging the Likert\nscale responses to these items (7 = a great deal; 2 =\nquite a bit; 3 = some; 4 = a little; 5 = not at all).\nThe internal consistency for each index was measured\nusing Cronbach's alpha in order to assess reliability.\nAll alpha coefficients were .70 or greater.\nDemandingness was operationalized by using a\nsingle indicator. Again respondents were asked to rate\ntheir spouse, children, and friends or other relatives\nseparately on a Likert scale in response to the item\n\"(this person) makes too many demands on me.\" The\nanchors for this variable were: 1 = a great deal; 2 =\nquite a bit; 3 = some; 4 = a little; 5 = not at all.\nThe positive support indices and the demand-\ningness indicator were used to measure respondents'\nperception of the quality of support received across\nthree types of relationships - spousal, children, and\nfriends/other relatives. Obviously, the last category of\nrelationship - friends or other relatives - is problem-\natic. It is highly probable that relationships with friends\nare quite different from relationships with other rela-\ntives, especially considering that siblings would be in-\ncluded in the \"other relative\" category. Indeed, in most\nstudies, relationships with friends and with siblings\nare considered separately and are often shown to re-\nlate to support variables in distinct ways (Wilson, Calsyn,\nUnfortunately, in this data set, these relationships\ncannot be separated for analysis. But despite the\nproblems with this variable, it is clear from the analy-\nses that there are both age and gender differences in\nthe perception of positive support from the relation-\nships it represents. Therefore, it is included in the\npresent study with the "
