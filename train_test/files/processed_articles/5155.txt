    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe construction industry has significant impacts on the environment. Abound the efforts to induce a greater green\nimplementation in the construction project, it has been argued that the usage of green building materials in construction\nprojects can help to minimize the production of waste and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. This article's objective is\nto identify the degree of compliance with the green building materials criteria by wood and cement manufacturers. The\ngreen building materials criteria were conceptualized as part of the sustainability movement in which the term green is\nused to refer to a clean environment and unpolluted atmosphere. To verify the compliance of the manufacturers through\nthe green building materials criteria, a questionnaire survey supported by an interview was conducted. The results show\nthat most Malaysian green manufacturers complied with the green criteria, which converged all three principles including\nenvironmental impact, resource management, and recycling implementation. This article provides a basis upon which existing\nand new manufacturers can produce green building materials thoroughly in accordance with the listed criteria. Clearly,\nthe manufacturers' compliance with the green building materials criteria has several impacts on the development of the\nconstruction industry such that a green building material production process will stimulate a balanced ecosystem and prevent\nan environmental catastrophe.\n",

The catastrophe created by\nthese construction projects enormously affected the environ-\nment through, for example, the waste production and green-\nhouse gas (GHG) emission. These issues have garnered much\nattention among researchers, professionals, and practitioners\nin the construction sector because they are against the funda-\nmental concept of sustainable development, which focuses on\nbalance between environmental, social, and economic ele-\nments. Most authors noted that the production of building\nmaterials has contributed to the environmental catastrophe\ntion of this originates from wood usage and cement produc-\ntion. Yeheyis, Hewage, Alam, Eskicioglu, and Sadiq (2012)\nstated that wood had become major element of construction\nwaste in Canada. In Australia, an estimated 20% to 30% of\nconstruction waste is added to landfills (Craven, Okraglik, &\nwaste is generated in European countries (Vefago & Jaume,\nIn Malaysia, a similar situation has occurred. For exam-\nple, the construction site in Batu Pahat, Johor, contributed\nAdnan, 2013). Furthermore, Lachimpadi, Pereira, Taha, and\nMokhtar (2012) noted that timber elements represented the\nhighest sources of construction waste from two of eight con-\nstruction sites in Klang Valley, Kuala Lumpur. Wood has\nbecome a major choice in conventional construction due to\nits function as the structural support in buildings. However,\ndue to the phenomenon of rotting, wood cannot be used\nrepeatedly and usually ends in a landfill. The Malaysian con-\nstruction industry released nearly 32.2% of CO\nemissions in\n1Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia\n2Effat University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia\nCorresponding Author:\nNuril Izzeaty Ishak, School of Housing, Building and Planning, Universiti\nEmail: nurils89@yahoo.com\nThe Green Manufacturer's Compliance\nWith Green Criteria Throughout the Life\nCycle of Building Material\nNuril Izzeaty Ishak1, Ernawati Mustafa Kamal1,\nand Nor'Aini Yusof2\n Keywords\ngreen manufacturer, green criteria, green building material, life cycle building material, construction industry\n2 SAGE Open\n2010, a portion of this originates from the cement production\nprocess (International Energy Agency [IEA], 2012).\nThese situations have triggered governments around the\nworld to implement green development in construction proj-\nects. Simcoe and Toffel (2014) discussed government efforts\nin implementing the green movement in which government\nprocurement affects the private sector demand. Utilizing the\nU.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and\nEnvironmental Design (LEED) standard in green building is\none effort that has been introduced. The Green Public\nProcurement (GPP) establishment in various countries such\nas Denmark, Germany, and Sweden derives environmental\nbenefits and stimulates the demand for green products (Testa,\nAnnunziata, Iraldo, & Frey, 2016). In the research conducted\nby Zhang, Wu, and Shen (2015), several efforts by govern-\nments have been identified, for example, Building Research\nEstablishment Environmental Performance Assessment\n(BREEAM) in the United Kingdom, Green Building\nChallenge in the United States, and Hong Kong Building\nEnvironment Assessment Method (HK-BEAM) in Hong\nKong.\nFurthermore, one means of addressing the problem is\nthrough the usage of green building materials in construction\nprojects. It has a very clear and significant impact of the\namount of waste produced with the development of the con-\nstruction industry. Understanding from the building materi-\nals production stage will minimize the aftereffect from cradle\nto grave and yet derogate the amount of waste produced.\nMany approaches have been made by the government such\nas introducing the 3R program (Agamuthu, Santha, Fauziah,\n& Dennis, 2011), enacting a green policy (Ahmad Fariz,\n2010), and executing the eco-labeling standard (Ahmad\nFariz, 2010) as a medium for green certification of the prod-\nuct. In addition, the Malaysian government has enforced the\nutilization of green construction approaches in government\nprojects such as energy consumption initiatives in public and\nindustrial buildings (Kristensen, Khalid, & Tang, 2005).\nAs the green movement is still considered to be in its early\nphase (Papargyropoulou, Padfield, Harrison, & Preece,\n2012), the Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water\n(KeTTHA) has been mandated to execute and enforce green\npractices in the country. The ministry has collaborated with a\nfew organizations such as the Malaysian Green Technology\nCorporation (MGTC), Malaysian Green Building Council\n(MGBC), and Scientific and Industrial Research Institute of\nMalaysia (SIRIM) Berhad in fostering the green movement;\nthis has led to the establishment of the National Green\nTechnology Policy (NGTP) and to carbon footprint labeling\n(SIRIM LCA Team, 2013). It was important for the produc-\ntion of green building materials to be endorsed by green cer-\ntificates. Green certificates are the important element that\ndifferentiates between a self-claimed product and a product\nthat undergoes a bona fide green process.\nAlthough these efforts and approaches have been intro-\nduced by the government, the problem of environmental\ndegradation remains. Implicitly, the problem is due to the\nproduction of building materials themselves, in particular,\nwood and cement-based products, which do not comply with\nthe green building materials criteria. Green building materi-\nals production is the first step in the green building produc-\ntion cycle. Wood and cement feature several criteria\nassociated with the environmental spectrum such as recycled\ncontent, natural resources, energy efficiency, and renewable\nCertain manufacturers have claimed that they produced\ngreen products; however, compliance with the green build-\ning materials criteria is in doubt. Because the spectrum of\nenvironmental protection had been widely spread, manufac-\nturers must be well-prepared and organized to cling to this\nindustry (Lee, Kang, Hsu, & Hung, 2009). However, in\ncatering to the demand in a construction project or of the cap-\ntive users, the manufacturers compete in producing greener\nbuilding materials without stressing the important parame-\nters in green building materials criteria.\nMost studies focus more on building material assessment\n(Ali & Al Nsairat, 2009), the impact of building materials on\nthe environment (Woolley, Kimmins, Harrison, & Harrison,\n2002), the life cycle of building materials (Saiz, Kennedy,\nBass, & Pressnail, 2006), green building materials selection\n(Akadiri & Olomolaiye, 2012; Castro-Lacouture, Sefair,\nFl\u00f3rez, & Medaglia, 2009), and barriers to green building\nmaterials implementation (Hoffman & Henn, 2008). Previous\nstudies have also addressed the green building materials\nassessment (Li, Wang, Wang, & Zhang, 2012), rating system,\nimplementation in building, impact on environmental assess-\nments (Cheng, Lin, & Hsu, 2015; Gall, Darling, Siegel,\nMorrison, & Corsi, 2013), innovation (Chang, Huang, Wu,\nson with conventional building materials (Cheng et al.,\n2015). Identifying the degree of manufacturer's compliance\nwith the green building materials criteria has not yet occurred.\nAlthough studies on green building materials have been\nrigorously conducted, the issues on environmental problems\nsuch as pollution, GHG emission, and improper waste man-\nagement still persist. Thus, this article aimed to identify the\ncompliance degree of the green manufacturers of wood and\ncement-based products with the green building materials cri-\nteria. Because the production of green building materials is\nthe utmost important step leading to green building forma-\ntion, assessing the fundamental criteria compliance by the\ngreen manufacturers helps to stimulate the green construc-\ntion industry and a greener environment and helps to foster\nthe green building materials production. Practically, this\nresearch helps the stakeholders in the construction industry\nto select the right green building materials, assists the user in\nbuying high quality green building materials, and triggers a\nbetter manufacturing process. Understanding the fundamen-\ntals of green building materials production in theory may\nlead to innovative research and development (R&D) activi-\nties in the manufacturing industry as well.\nIshak et al. 3\nThe first section of this article discusses the research\nobjectives, followed by the criteria and principles of green\nbuilding materials based on the literature and government\nprocurement. The third section delineates the life cycle of\nbuilding materials. Next, the methodology is discussed,\nwhich consists of the data collection and the analysis\ninvolved. The last section elaborates on the findings, which\nthen answer the research question raised earlier.\nResearch Objectives\nGreen building materials had drawn an attention among the\nconstruction industry players such as developers, contrac-\ntors, and manufacturers. In producing a truly green building\nmaterials, the manufacturers should consider several param-\neters theoretically and practically. Each stage in the life cyle\nof the building material starting from extraction of raw\nmaterial until the waste disposal, should follow standard-\nized procedures to call it as green building material.\nHowever, the compliance of the buiding materials with the\ngreen principles and criteria through each of production\nitself specifically focusing on wood and cement-based prod-\nucts have not yet been discovered. Previous researches have\nfocused on the life cycle issues such as the impact of build-\ning materials production on the environment (Esin, 2007)\nand the implementation of 3Rs concept in demolition pro-\ncess (Sabai, Egmond, Cox, Mato, & Lichtenberg, 2009). In\nMalaysia, the assessment tools have been provided to recog-\nnize the material and yet the growth of green building mate-\nrials was still low. The SIRIM Eco-Label certification only\nused to verify the materials as an environmental friendly\nproducts. Thus, this will lead to the question of whether the\nmanufacturers comply with the green principles and criteria\nin the process of producing green building material. Hence,\nthis article's objective is to identify the degree of compli-\nance with the green building materials criteria by wood and\ncement manufacturers.\nCriteria and Principles of Green\nBuilding Material\nGreen building materials are sustained by its name and veri-\nfied by eco-labeling certification; in addition, the green build-\ning materials production process should follow the right\ncriteria to ensure that the material is genuinely produced in\naccordance with the green process. Certain scholars noted that\ngreen building materials originate from the green manufac-\nturer concerned with the green practices implemented by their\nmanagement (Deif, 2011). The green practices in the company\nand the production of green building materials are interrelated\nbecause the green manufacturers apply practices such as the\nelimination of sources of waste and the reduction of energy\nconsumption (Deif, 2011). These manufacturers should also\nsimilarly implement green practices when producing the green\nbuilding materials product. The green manufacturer that\nexecutes the concept of green in its company is more sensitive\nto the elements and criteria used in making their products. To\ncertify the building material as green, the green manufacturer\nis obliged to follow certain criteria that relate to nature and\nhuman health. In Malaysia, green manufacturing companies\nneed to follow the criteria noted in the NGTP and the SIRIM\neco-label standard to produce green products. However, before\nmoving to the practical compliance, it is important to examine\nthe criteria noted in the theory used as the baseline for all\nrequirements.\nFor deeper understanding, the term green building crite-\nria is defined holistically by various scholars. U.S. Green\nBuilding Council defined green building criteria as counter-\nmeasure of making the building sustain toward the environ-\nmental changes and human health effect (Kriss, 2014). The\nauthors mentioned that to identify the green criteria of the\nbuilding, a few parameters should be considered such as\nenergy usage, indoor environmental quality, material, and\nselection. On the contrary, Olanipekun, Xia, and Nguyen\n(2017) compiled the term green building as product of a min-\nimum environmental footprint, clean, and resource-efficient\nmeasures in the whole life cycle of the building with regard\nto balance ecosystem and users' well-being. In addition,\nSteinemann, Wargocki, and Rismanchi (2017) mentioned\nthat the current trend of defining the green buildings is\nthrough the green building certification such as Building\nResearch Establishment Environmental Assessment\nMethodology (BREEAM) and LEED. In Malaysia, Green\nBuilding Index (GBI) is implemented to define and catego-\nrize the green buildings. In Malaysian context, green build-\ning focused on resource efficiency in terms of energy, water,\nand materials and reducing building impact on human health\nand environment during building's life cycle (GBI, 2017). In\ngeneral, green building is defined universally, in which the\nmain concern is to promote sustainability of available\nresources through an efficient management of the present\nand aftereffect of the building to the environment and\npeople.\nlisted several criteria to be used to evaluate green building\nmaterial (GBM). The green criteria possessed several simi-\nlarities although certain scholars have added a few more cri-\nteria. Table 1 shows that certain scholars agreed that local\nmaterials are part of the important criteria to clarify the prod-\nuct as a green. Kim and Rigdon (1998) noted that using local\nmaterials could reduce the energy consumption used in trans-\nportation and minimize the GHG emissions. For instance,\nthe utilization of local materials requires fewer transporta-\ntion processes because it involves short distance transfers.\nUsing local materials could also minimize the effort of\nimporting the material, and this supports the economic\ngrowth of local trade. Other green criteria noted by previous\nauthors are depicted in Table 1.\nFor the purpose of this study, classification of the criteria\ninto principles is necessary because some manufacturers\n4 SAGE Open\nlisted the major criteria and some listed the subcriteria.\nExamining the definition of the principle, Blengini and Carlo\n(2010) defined it as a guideline used to provide a general\nview on one issue. Thus, if one interprets the criteria as prin-\nciples, one may view the green building materials criteria as\na general perspective. The criteria listed by the scholars as\nshown in Table 1 were regrouped into three major principles,\nwhich are as follows: (a) environmental impact (P1), (b)\nresource management (P2), and (c) 3R implementation (P3).\nThese principles were developed by researchers based on\nthe definition of each criterion that matches the principle.\nFor example, the natural resources criterion is one of the\nresource management activities (Holling & Meffe, 1996);\nthus, this criterion is classed into P2. The combination of the\ngreen criteria with the green principles provides a strong\nfoundation for green building materials. The principles and\ncriteria used to evaluate the green building materials during\nthe production process are shown in Table 2.\nFurthermore, the government of Malaysia gazettes the\ngreen policy to enhance the usage of green technology and\naccelerate the production of green product in the country.\nThe NGTP is viewed as an economic booster, which at the\nsame time is conducive to sustainable development (Roslina,\nRM5 billion to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and it is\nThe NGTP, established in 2009, aligns with the establish-\nment of the KeTTHA, which is responsible for green enforce-\nment in Malaysia. KeTTHA has collaborated with the green\nauthority within the country to ensure that green practices are\nwell implemented and aligned with the goal and objectives\nof the NGTP. SIRIM Berhad was part of the green authority\nresponsible for the verification of green products. There are\n37 criteria documents used to evaluate green products. Table\n3 shows an example of the criteria in the SIRIM eco-label\nstandard documentation used by the SIRIM authority to\nevaluate wood and cement-based product. From the criteria\nnoted in Table 3, much emphasis has been placed on carbon\nrelease during the production process. The production of\nbuilding material emits certain quantities of chemicals and\ngasses such as carbon monoxide, sulfur oxide, and nitrogen\noxide (Safiuddin, Mohd Zamin, Salam, Islam, & Hashim,\n2010). The emission of gasses should be in accordance with\nthe Environmental QualityAct (EQA; 1974). Verifying green\nproducts with green certificates could possibly help reduce\nthe quantity of carbon emission released into the atmosphere.\nThe emphasis on the issues of carbon release shows that the\ngovernment of Malaysia considers the reduction of the\nenergy consumption by the manufacturing industry, which\ncurrently depends on the usage of fossil fuel, to be a serious\nconcern.\nLife Cycle of Building Material\nThe overall impact on the environment is significantly\nrelated to the life cycle of a building material. Many\napproaches raised by previous scholars are related to reduc-\ning the impact. Some of the initiatives involve using techni-\ncal tools such as life cycle assessment (LCA) tools, which\ntake into account the energy used, material consumption, and\nwaste production during the production process, to measure\nthe impact on the environment (Curran, 1996). Mungcharoen,\nSridowtong, and Saibuatrong (2010) proved that the use of\nTable 1. Summary of the Green Criteria of Building Material by Various Authors.\nAuthors (Year)\nGreen criteria\nNote.

Huntzinger and\nEatmon (2009) evaluated the impact of the life cycle process\nof four types of cement product and found that the use of\nnatural pozzolans such as rice husk in the cement production\nreduces the GHG emissions and minimizes the environmen-\ntal impact. There were also other studies that used other tech-\nnical method such as relative index (RI) analysis (Akadiri &\nOlomolaiye, 2012) and genetic algorithm (GA) analysis\n(Zhou, Yin, & Hu, 2009) to discover the optimum criteria for\nselecting sustainable material.\nThe selection of raw material is a very crucial step in\nwhich the raw material selection involves a complex process\nthatleadstohighintensityenergyusetoproduceit(Amponsah,\nLacarriere, Jamali-Zghal, Le, & Corre, 2012). The impact\nfrom the product could be minimized if the main focus is con-\nsidered during the material selection. Thus, the center point\nhas looked at the life cycle of building material. The life cycle\nprocess was adopted from the studies done by Kim and\nwhere the green criteria is incorporated into each stage of the\nlife cycle process. Figure 1 shows that the life cycle is divided\ninto three phases known as the (a) pre-use phase, (b) use\nphase, and (c) post-use phase. The pre-use phase is dominant\nin the environmental damages (Kim & Rigdon, 1998). This is\nthe phase where many impacts could affect the environment\nin a serious way. Examining the early phases of the life cycle\nprocess will ensure that the building material is produced in\nan environmentally benign manner. Although the impact may\nTable 3.

The 3R (recycle, reduce, and\nreuse) elements operate in the closed-loop cycle, which will\nhelp to reduce production waste (Sassi, 2008) and to hinder\nthe exploitation of natural sources. The compliance with the\ngreen criteria and appliance of the 3R element to the life cycle\nprocess cause less stress on the environment and reduce the\nimpact on human health.\nMethod\nThe census population that represents the entire population\nwas used because there are a limited number of manufac-\nturing companies in Malaysia that produce green building\nmaterials. The survey technique and the interview approach\nwere used to obtain data from the Malaysian top manage-\nment of green manufacturing companies that specialize in\nwood and cement-based product. The data from these two\nsources help to strengthen the findings and provide better\nunderstanding on the particular topic. A total of 72 respon-\ndents were selected, and 21 completed the survey form;\nfurthermore, five companies were involved in the semis-\ntructured interview session, which is shown in Table 4.\nDespite the small number of respondents, the survey ques-\ntionnaire used has a reliable measure of Cronbach's alpha\nwith an average of 0.6-0.9; it is supported by the exper-\ntise endorsement.\nThe questionnaires were distributed to the respondents\ndirectly one-to-one and collected after they had answered all\nthe questions. As for the interview, the respondents were\ncalled through mail or direct call and were asked for their\npermission to undergo an interview. The questionnaire was\ndivided into two main sections: Part A and Part B. Part A\ncovers the information on the green manufacturer company\nand consists of three subsections: (a) background of the com-\npany, (b) management of the company, and (c) barriers faced\nby the green manufacturer. In Part B, the manufacturers were\nasked their opinion on the principles of green building mate-\nrials. Meanwhile, for the interview, the questions were\ndivided into two sections: The first section represented the\nfunctions of the authorities and second section consisted of\nquestions on the criteria of green building material develop-\nment. An example of the questionnaires and interview ques-\ntions and answers is shown in the next section.\nThe Likert-scale type, with ratings from 0 (not at all) to\n5 (very high), was utilized to ascertain the greatest and the\nleast compliance with green criteria applied by the green\nmanufacturer during the production process. Several tech-\nniques were used to evaluate the survey data; these were\nan SPSS statistical analysis package, matrix data analysis,\nand percentage compliance. The survey data were first\nanalyzed based on the mean value score. The rank mean\nscore was adapted from the study conducted by Alston and\nMiller (2002) and rearranged to be suitable for this study:\nhigh implementation, and (f) 4.5-5.00 = very high imple-\nmentation. The criteria scored as 3.5 and above were\nselected as the criteria most implemented by green\nmanufacturers.\nThe matrix data analysis was used to identify the greatest\ncompliance between the data obtained and the criteria noted\nin the previous study and the SIRIM eco-label. The criteria\nwith the highest degree of compliance were calculated based\non the percentage of compliance, which used the basic math-\nematical formulation as shown in Figure 2. The interview\ndata were interpreted and organized using the content analy-\nsis technique and the thematic approach. The raw data from\nthe interview session were first coded into a script and man-\naged under important topics, which were then organized\nbased on thematic forms.\nData Survey\nBased on the questionnaires and interview made, a few\nfindings reflected the objectives targeted were found.\nFrom the questionnaires, the respondents were asked on\ntheir profile and their opinions on the principles of green\nbuilding material. The researcher categorized the green\nmanufacturer into three levels: (a) high level, if the manu-\nfacturer fulfills all the requirement of green listed compa-\nnies in Part A and complies with the principles and criteria\nTable 4. Distribution of Respondents Based on the Type of\nProduct.\nProduct\nTotal\npopulation\nRespondents for\nquestionnaire survey\nRespondents\nfor interview\naone respondent produced two materials at a time.\nIshak et al. 7\nof green in production process in Part B; (b) medium\nlevel, if the manufacturer fulfills 50% requirement in Part\nA and complies with certain green principles and criteria\nin Part B; and (c) low level, if the manufacturer does not\nfulfill part requirement in complying in Part A and Part B,\nrespectively. For example, the respondents were asked to\nprovide information on the ways they produced their\nbuilding materials based on three main principles which\nwere the environmental impact, resource management,\nand 3R implementation. The scale was rated from 0 (not at\nall) to 5 (very high). From the items listed in the environ-\nmental criteria, the highest degrees of choice from the\nrespondents are the reduction of environmental impact\nthrough recycling activities and the efficient usage of\nenergy. The mean value for these two items is near to the\nvalue of 3.5, and, as such, it can be classified as a high\ndegree of implementation. Thus, these two criteria were\nconsidered as very important criteria that the company\nhad to comply to be called a green company. Marked by\ncorrespondence with the data from the interview, one of\nthe manufacturers mentioned that their products are green\nin terms of zero emission. Thus, based on the data, the\nmanufacturers were scored using mean value scoring sys-\ntem mentioned earlier to be classifying as full compliance\nor vice versa.\nFindings and Discussion\nThe identification of the most important green criteria of\nbuilding material was determined using the mean value, and\nthis is presented in Table 5. The information gathered from\nthe interview session was included in the analysis in addition\nto the questionnaire survey data. The findings show that the\nmost selective criteria in P1 are the reduction in the environ-\nmental impact through recycling activities and the efficient\nuse of energy. The interview data shown in Table 6 eluci-\ndated that the energy saving criteria are the ones most fre-\nquently noted by the interviewees, and they believed this to\nbe the best element to describe their green building materi-\nals.

The\nimplementation of 3R element principles shows that the\nrecyclability criteria are preferred by the green manufactur-\ning companies that represent the value of 3.45.\nIn relation to the data obtained, the dispersion of the\ncriteria compliance with the green building materials\nnoted by the SIRIM eco-label and the previous studies\nclarifies the similar and different levels of importance of\nthe data. For instance, the following has been noted in the\nSIRIM eco-label criteria document for fiber-cement prod-\nuct: the fiber cement shall contain of not less than 15 per-\ncent of recycle content. In the survey data, recycled\nmaterial has the second highest mean value in P3, whereas\nin the interview data, this criterion is also noted by two of\nfive manufacturers. One of the interviewees stated that the\ncompany is using recycled materials as 20% of the total\nmaterials in the production process for autoclaved aerated\nconcrete (AAC). The recycled material criteria are essen-\ntial elements to produce the green building material. This\nfinding aligns with the findings of previous scholars in\nwhich the building material produced with the recycled\ncontent provides a better strength, improves the product\nperformance (Garg & Jain, 2014), minimizes the usage of\nnatural resources (Saghafi & Hosseini Teshnizi, 2011),\nand reduces GHG emissions and waste production (Kubba,\nAs noted by Spiegel and Meadows (2010), the green\nbuilding material should exhibit less CO\nemission and\nshould minimize the impact on the environment. Even the\nSIRIM eco-label standard documentation emphasized\nreducing the carbon release to the atmosphere during the\nproduction process. However, the survey data show con-\ntradictions in what had been gazetted. The carbon release\nranked in 10th place in P1, whereas one of the respondents\nnoted reduction in carbon emissions during the interview\nsession. Manufacturer E noted that by replacing the main\nelements such as clinker with alternative materials such as\npulverized fuel ash (PFA), CO\nemissions could be reduced.\nThe finding was also supported by Aranda Us\u00f3n, L\u00f3pez-\nSabir\u00f3n, Ferreira, and Llera Sastresa (2013); in their study,\nthe usage of alternative materials could minimize the wast-\nage, reduce energy consumption, minimize costs, and pre-\nserve natural resources.\nIn addition, the authority noted that less than 20 manufac-\nturers had enquired about the eco-label certification. The sur-\nvey data elucidated that eight of 21 manufacturers had\napplied for eco-labeling, and this criterion is ranked as high\nas 10th place, with a mean value of 2.62; this is not a prefer-\nable criterion among the manufacturing companies. However,\nduring the interview session, Manufacturer B described this\ncriterion as a main focus that the company was targeting. The\ncompany had targeted achievement of the green certificate\nwithin and outside the country to the extent possible. As\nnoted by Zimmerman (2005), green certificates help a com-\npany compete in the green market with more competitive\noptions. The certificate also helps to protect consumers from\nenvironmental fraud.\nThe compliance with the previous study and with the\nSIRIM eco-label standard criteria was studied to observe the\npattern of the most implemented criteria. The matrix data\nanalysis used to indicate the cross section between the data is\npresented in Appendices A and B. The degree of compliance\nhad been determined based on the total number of criteria\ncomplied with in the previous study and the SIRIM eco-\nlabel. From Appendix A, the green manufacturer complied\nwith 10 of 13 green criteria noted by previous scholars,\nplied with the SIRIM eco-label criteria.\nConsidering the information gathered from the survey\nand the interview, the green building materials criteria are\ntabulated in Table 7. As noted earlier, the criteria of the envi-\nronmental impact principle featured two criteria: pollution\nprevention and toxicity. However, the findings expanded to\ninclude specific criteria: minimum wastage, no toxicity, and\na low carbon footprint. Of the eight criteria listed in the\nresource management principle, five criteria are selected to\ndetermine the green building materials. In the literature, 3R\nimplementation is listed as one principle of GBM. The depic-\ntion of the finding shows that one R is selected, which is the\nrecycle criteria.\nThus, the principle is refined to a 1R implementation. The\ncriteria are more specific to two materials: wood and cement-\nbased products.\nConclusion\nIn recent years, the environmental issue is a topical issue\nthat has been debated, and this includes the emergence of\nthe green building materials issue. The main issues that\nIshak et al. 9\nthe construction industries are confronted with are the\npollution and waste production. This study's objective\nwas to identify the compliance of the wood and cement-\nbased product manufacturers throughout the green build-\ning materials life cycle with the green building materials\ncriteria. Although current practices on green building\nmaterials in this country remain in the low levels, intro-\nducing these efforts and approaches may help develop\nbetter material production methodologies. Extensive\nunderstanding on the green production of building mate-\nrials helps to stimulate the green development as well. If\nthe manufacturer complied with each criteria in the green\nbuilding materials principles, the building materials\nwould pass through a green production process. However,\nthere are several implications identified. Malaysian green\nbuilding materials industry has not yet witnessed uniform\nand objective quality system and construction firms such\nas developers, manufacturers, and suppliers practice their\nown developed standard. Certain manufacturers did not\nfully comply with the criteria listed in the literature and\nthe SIRIM eco-label documentation. From the list of\ngreen manufacturers in Malaysia, less than 20 manufac-\nturers are certified by SIRIM. Although green\ncertification is one of the important elements to identify\ngreen manufacturers, certain manufacturers refuse to\nacknowledge the importance of applying for green certi-\nfication. To address this problem, the government of\nMalaysia should enforce a mandatory requirement for\nmanufacturers to certify using green label certification.\nGreener construction had become popular trend among\ndeveloper and construction industry practitioners. The\ngovernment should strictly enhance the green standard\nand policy which relates to the environment while foster-\ning green practices in the country. The initiatives in terms\nof financial support, green education, and program and\nother efforts related to green could be used to promote the\ngreen concept as well as to increase the knowledge and\nawareness among the people. Furthermore, understand-\ning on the green building materials and commitment from\nthe manufacturers will ameliorate the current position of\ngreen material production to better level. However, this\nstudy has concentrated solely on wood and cement-based\nproducts only. Rigorous studies are suggested for future\nresearch work to better understand all the types of build-\ning materials' manufacturers.\nAppendix A: Analysis of data and literature review\nLiterature review\nData obtained\nEnvironmental impact Resource management\nimplementation\nEnvironmental\nimpact\nPollution\nprevention\n* * * \nToxicity * * \nResource\nmanagement\nResource efficient * \nNatural resources * \nLocal material * \nWater\nconservation\n\nEco-label \nRenewable\nresources\n* \nEmbodied energy \nEnergy efficient * * * \n3R implementation Recycled content * *\nRecyclability * * \nReusability \nNote.
