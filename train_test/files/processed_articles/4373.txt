From childhood\nuntil death, we face a `wide-ranging and unending\nseries of choices' across almost every domain of life\nwhat clothes to wear, our style of haircut, what types\nof insurance to purchase (or not), the level and types of\nconsumption practices that we undertake, and so on.\nChoice, that is, the options that individuals have at\ntheir disposal as well as the ability to compare between\nthem and make a decision, has been argued to be fun-\ndamental to individual freedom, autonomy and well-\nbeing (Leotti et al., 2010), and the development of\nWestern society (Rosenthal, 2005). Although choice is\na phenomenon that is unequally distributed throughout\nconsumer societies (discussed later in section), at the\nsame time it enables people to cultivate an individual\nsense of self and exercise the right to direct their own\nlives and practices of consumption. As Iyengar sug-\ngests, there is a feedback loop between self-identity\nand choice: `If I am this, then I should choose that; if\nappear that choice is a universal good, that is, more\nchoice is better. However, choice is both complex and\nproblematic.\nA challenge concerning choice is that consumer\nsocieties have an over-abundance of it (Clarke, 2010;\nIyengar, 2011). For example, counting the products in\nhis local supermarket, Schwartz (2005) observed that\nAustralian National University, Canberra, Australia\nCorresponding author:\nTimothy Graham, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.\nEmail: Timothy.Graham@anu.edu.au\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License (http://\nwww.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-\nat-sage).\nBig Data & Society\njournals.sagepub.com/home/bds\n285 kinds of cookies and 40 toothpastes, to name a few.\nWhilst too little choice can be detrimental, too much\nchoice threatens to overwhelm individuals and under-\nmine the benefits that choice can provide. In this way,\nchoice has been critically examined as a paradox\nElsewhere the notion of `hyper-choice' has been devel-\noped to describe an objective condition of consumer\nsocieties whereby an `ever-increasing amount of\nbuying occurs amidst an ever-increasing amount of\nnew products, brands, and brand extensions' (Mick\nconstrue hyper-choice as a situated phenomenon\nwhereby individuals are faced with too many or too\nvaried options, which in turn overwhelms their capacity\nto make choices. Choice is thus positioned as `hyper' in\nterms of the scale and speed at which it is expanding\nand differentiating.\nYet individuals are not passive in contemporary\nchoice-infused environments. They actively draw on a\nrange of tools, knowledge and heuristics in order to\nhelp them navigate choice and make `informed' deci-\nsions. Nowadays, one of the most important and per-\nvasive tools is the Internet and, more specifically, the\nweb. The advent of what is popularly referred to as\n`Web 2.0' has opened up a world of choice (Han,\n2011) and choice-making functionalities through a pro-\nliferation of consumer and e-commerce websites. For\nexample, popular e-commerce websites such as\nAmazon.com and eBay.com position users as co-\nproducers of sprawling online market places (e.g.,\nreading and writing reviews, providing ratings,\nmaking purchases). `Comparison shopping websites'\nprovide tools for users to compare prices between sell-\ners (e.g., Shopbot.com, BizRate.com). Similarly,\n`reviews websites' (e.g., TripAdvisor.com, Yelp.com)\nand `ratings websites' (e.g., RateMyTeachers.com,\nDoctorScoreCard.com) provide users with information\nto compare businesses and professionals.\nIn exploring this topic, Graham (2016) undertook a\nfoundational study of how choice is shaped online\nthrough the design features and architecture of web-\nsites. Graham argues that the aforementioned kinds\nof sites neither determine choice nor simply provide a\nneutral space for the liberal ideal of `free choice' to play\nout, but instead constitute and structure the experience\nof having and making choice. Such websites thus obtain\na `logic of choice' (in some ways akin to Ziewitz's\n(2012) `logic of evaluation'). Moreover, the empirical\nanalysis of websites undertaken by Graham (2016)\nrevealed an interesting type or sub-species of choice-\ninfused websites, that is, large-scale platforms that go\nbeyond the baseline or `normal' understanding and\nexperience of choice. Graham argues that the design\nfeatures and architecture of platforms such as\nAmazon significantly expand the scope, scale and\nspeed of choice-making, blur the line between users\nand content producers (Bruns and Schmidt, 2011),\nand embody a form of empiricism that radically chal-\nlenges how we come to know and differentiate choice.\nIndeed, the author alludes to the `hyper' nature of these\nkinds of choice-infused platforms, although this idea is\nnot pursued further (see Graham, 2016, abstract).\nThese kinds of platforms provide an interesting ana-\nlytical focal point for further investigation. In what\nways do their design features and architecture appear\nto drive, expand, speed up, and reconfigure choice in a\n`hyper' way? However, more than simply energising or\nexciting the choice-making process, I seek to attend to\nhow platforms appear to `go beyond' and `overshoot'\nor `overstep' our normal understanding of what choice\nis and how it is constituted, drawing on the lexical def-\ninition of the prefix `hyper' and its Greek roots (Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary, 2017). Hence, our focus is not\nsimply on hyper-choice as the relationship between\nplatforms and a growing abundance or glut of choice,\nbut more importantly on how platforms reconfigure\nchoice in interesting and profound ways that reimagine,\nre-specify and challenge our foundational understand-\nings of what choice is, who and what is involved in\nproducing knowledge about choice, and what it\nmeans to be a `chooser'.\nTo be sure, choice is not a universally available phe-\nnomenon. Not everyone experiences choice in the same\nway \u00ad it is differentially constructed and experienced\ndistributed throughout the population. Differences in\nindividuals' social realities have a significant impact\nnot only on the choices they have on offer, but also\ntheir ability to choose between them. Choice is differ-\nential, just as opportunity is not uniform. Despite\nclaims that the Internet produces uniform benefits\nand opportunities for economic growth, differing\ndegrees of Internet connectivity result in uneven eco-\nnomic impacts across geographies and social strata\n(Friederici et al., 2017). These geographical inequalities\nof Internet access are also concomitant with differences\nin the modes of participation available to users in dif-\nferent geographical contexts. Indeed, peoples' experi-\nence of choice on the web would be markedly\ndifferent in countries where Internet access is filtered\nor controlled by the state. Thus the expansion of\nchoice I have elaborated so far in this paper is not\nexperienced universally. In light of these consider-\nations, the focus of this paper is on particular forms\nand experiences of choice in the context of large-scale,\ncommercial web platforms. In this paper I focus on,\n2 Big Data & Society\nand critically examine, practices of choice and con-\nsumption in privileged Western countries predomin-\nantly in North America and Western Europe, and\ncountries such as Australia and New Zealand.\nHaving made some important clarifications about\nthe types and experiences of choice I invoke in this\nstudy, the remainder of the paper is organised as fol-\nlows. In the next section, I examine how platforms\nleverage user-generated Big Data and ratings and rank-\nings devices to undertake a politics of commensuration\nthat fundamentally reconfigures knowledge production\nabout choice. Drawing on theories in the sociology of\nclassification and standards and science and technology\nstudies (STS), I argue that this novel form of empiri-\ncism radically challenges, and perhaps even nullifies,\nexisting categories and standards that used to define\nchoice. In `Choice and the politics of commensuration\nwithin produsage-driven platforms' section I use illus-\ntrative case examples of popular choice-infused plat-\nforms (Graham, 2016) to discuss how their design\nfeatures and architecture shape choice in a way that\nbreaks down, hybridises, and challenges the longstand-\ning conceptual dualisms that we use to understand con-\nsumer choice and web use, such as producers versus\nconsumers, and users versus producers. In the final sec-\ntion I examine how the individuality, self-governing\ncapacities and subjectivity of users is actively harnessed\nand attempted to be shaped by platforms. Drawing on\nFoucauldian governmentality and key theories in STS\nand the philosophy of technology, I argue that plat-\nforms, through their architecture and design features,\nimbue a productive mode of power that seeks to pro-\nduce and reproduce particular kinds of consumerist and\nneoliberal subjectivities pertinent to the goals and ima-\nginaries of the platform operators.\nTaken together, I argue that these factors point\ntowards a condition of hyper-choice as one possible tra-\njectory and emergent feature of contemporary choice-\ninfused platforms such as TripAdvisor.com and\nYelp.com. The concept of hyper-choice developed in\nthis paper opens up new opportunities and research dir-\nections to appraise and critically evaluate the way in\nwhich platforms organise and reconfigure human experi-\nence through a logic of choice. In exploring this import-\nant \u00ad and scarcely studied \u00ad phenomenon, the paper\ninvites readers to go beyond what it means to experience\nand enact choice in an era of Big Data and platforms.\nChoice and commensurability on\nplatforms: The reconfiguration of\nchoice and choice-making practices\nA key aspect of choice on the web concerns the prac-\ntices of `choosing', that is, the ability for users to\ncompare between heterogeneous goods and/or services\nin particular ways, in order to evaluate their merits and\nproperties against a common standard or metric. For\nexample, when choosing somewhere to eat, a user on\nYelp.com might compare between a French restaurant\nversus a Chinese restaurant, trading off between five-\nstar user ratings versus affordability and location. The\nlongstanding notion of commensurability (cf. Kuhn,\n1982) is key to understanding how practices of choosing\nare made not only made practicable but also reconfi-\ngured via the design of web spaces. Comparing two\ndissimilar items (e.g., an orange and an apple) is pos-\nsible providing we have a common nomenclature or\nstandard \u00ad or technology \u00ad to compare them by. Thus\nratings, rankings and sorting devices become enrolled\nin different ways to make commensurability (and thus\nchoice) possible through the web.\nYet choice is also about knowledge. How can we\nknow which option is a better choice amongst various\nalternatives? Ziewitz positions this in terms of a `politics\nof commensuration' that frames commensuration as a\nsocial process enacted through practical facilities\nCommensuration is `the process of transforming dis-\nparate forms of value into homogeneous units, which\nallows information reduction, uncertainty absorption,\nand simplification of decision-making' (Scott and\n`forms of value' and `units', platforms such as\nTripAdvisor construct choice by classifying things in\nparticular ways. Recent scholarship has examined the\nrole of commensurability through a case study of\nTripAdvisor, which enables users to find and compare\nbetween accommodation and travel options (Scott and\nOrlikowski, 2012). They argue that user-generated rat-\nings and reviews on Trip Advisor have reconfigured the\nhotel industry because these technologies enable com-\nparisons between accommodation options that are\nregarded as categorically different and incommensur-\nable in the travel industry. The authors use the example\nof the ManorHouse (a hotel) and the PubInn (a pub),\nwhich are not seen as direct competitors in the industry\nbecause they are in different classes of accommodation,\nand are listed in entirely separate industry guidebooks.\nYet, they argue that the review and rating system on\nTrip Advisor renders these options commensurable and\nin doing so `[intensifies] this material nullification of\nProcesses of sorting and commensuration on plat-\nforms have important consequences for the categories\nwe use to define and navigate choice. Moreover, classi-\nfication and categories are central to understanding how\nknowledge is produced about choice (as in the options\non offer). To clarify what is meant by classification I\ndraw on the foundational definition provided by\nBowker and Star:\nA classification is a spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal\nsegmentation of the world. A `classification system' is a\nset of boxes (metaphorical or literal) into which things\ncan be put to then do some kind of work \u00ad bureaucratic\nemphasis original)\nThe way in which categories order social processes is\nimportant to how choice is constructed and facilitated\nthrough platforms such as TripAdvisor. Ranking and\nrating devices have become a sort of `information infra-\nstructure' (Bowker et al., 2010) providing practical\nfacilities to categorise the world, effectively becoming\nstandardised tools that constitute `recipes for reality'\n(Busch, 2011). Choice-making practices and modes of\nknowledge production in platform environments are\nremarkably different than in traditional settings. For\ninstance, Blank's (2007) two-fold framework of reviews\nsystems consists of `connoisseurial' reviews by singular\nexperts, and `procedural' reviews produced through\ntests and standardised procedures, which usefully con-\nceptualise traditional choice-making practices but do\nnot attend to the radically different form of empiricism\nwe observe in the context of large-scale platforms. Yet\nconstruing these kinds of devices and functionalities as\nsimply making everything commensurable and produ-\ncing difference fails to consider a more important point:\nplatform ratings and reviews systems are reconfiguring\nexisting standards, driven (at least in part) by the need\nto organise and facilitate choice in consumer societies\nthat have an overabundance of it.\nAs discussed previously, Scott and Orlikowski (2012)\nargue that the platform infrastructure of TripAdvisor\nintensifies a nullification of existing industry standards.\nIn this way, existing categories that are context-specific,\nsuch as classes of accommodation in the travel industry\n(e.g., pubs versus hotels) do not come to define and\nstructure choice in the way they used to. Ratings,\nreviews and rankings devices (as infrastructure for\nchoice on platforms) reinvent, reimagine, and perhaps\neven in the case of TripAdvisor collapse, existing cate-\ngories and systems of classification that we use to define\nchoice. To be sure, standardisation differentiation and\ncategorisation systems for choice are not new phenom-\nena. For example, Busch highlights how the Sears\nRoebuck catalogue, issued in 1894, `massively increased\nconsumers' choices' by using standardised categories\nand characteristics of commensurability to differentiate\nof digital platforms we observe that established stand-\nards for commensuration and categories that define and\norder choice are radically reconfigured. The politics of\ncommensuration engendered through platforms `goes\nbeyond', `overshoots', and respecifies how consumer\nchoice is normally or traditionally constructed and\nframed. This is one of the `hyper' aspects of choice in\nthe context of large-scale consumer platforms such as\nTripAdvisor.\nthere is a constellation of devices, including but not\nlimited to ratings and reviews, that websites deploy in\norder to engender a politics of commensuration within\nthe web space. For instance, platforms such as\nAmazon.com enable options on offer to be rendered\ncommensurable according to how many other users\nhave viewed or purchased them (i.e., number of page\nhits and number of purchases). This provides the ability\nto rapidly sort options by how popular they are with\nother users (see Figure 1), even in the absence of other\ninformation such as product ratings. Such devices differ\nto rating devices insofar as an option might be popular\n(i.e., many people are viewing it) or bestselling (i.e.,\nmany people are purchasing it) regardless of how\nhighly it is rated. For example, at the time of writing,\nthe book `Allegiant' by Veronica Roth was ranked 4th\non the Kindle best-seller list on Amazon.com, despite\nonly receiving an average of three stars out of five (after\n8,241 reviews). Ostensibly at least, platforms are able to\nleverage and triangulate massive stores of user-\ngenerated data (purchases, product views, clickstreams)\nto not only respecify and reimagine previously existing\ncategories that used to define choice, but also increas-\ningly speed up the choice-making process and make it\neasier for users. For instance, if a user can't find a\nrating for a particular product or service they wish to\ncompare, then they might be able to sort the options on\noffer by popularity; or if there is not enough data to\nrank the options by popularity, they can look at the\nsorted list of bestsellers; and so on. Crucially, what\nthese kinds of algorithmic devices and functionalities\nFigure 1. Sorting options by best-selling/popular\n(Walmart.com).\n4 Big Data & Society\ndepend upon a sufficiently large amount of user-\ngenerated data to render them practical. If there is\nonly a small user population to derive data-driven pat-\nterns from and a small number of options to compare\nbetween, their usefulness and practicality arguably\ndiminishes.\nThus another hyper aspect of choice on platforms is\nhow user-generated Big Data and economies of scale\nare leveraged not only to facilitate choice under condi-\ntions of abundance, but moreover to speed up choice-\nmaking practices and expand the scope and scale of\nchoice. We observe that there is a rapid feedback\nloop between users and platforms, and moreover that\nthis relationship is recursive: as more users are attracted\nto the platform (interpreted here as visiting the plat-\nform in order to make choices quickly and easily),\nmore data becomes available to enhance the choice-\nmaking functionality, which results in more users\nvisiting and revisiting. However, whilst the arguments\npresented in this section form part of the picture of\nwhat is different \u00ad I suggest hyper \u00ad about choice in a\nplatform context, it does not attend to the way in which\nplatforms not only depend upon but actively target and\nsubjectify users in ways that go beyond and greatly\noverstep conventional choice-making practices and\nsubject/object dichotomies. It is to these issues that\nwe now turn.\nChoice and the politics of\ncommensuration within\nprodusage-driven platforms\nUsing a range of illustrative examples in the previous\nsection I have shown how platforms configure choice\nthrough a complex entanglement of user-generated Big\nData, architectures that deploy ratings, rankings and\nsorting devices, and a politics of commensuration that\ninvolves classification practices and knowledge produc-\ntion via categories. In this way, the design features and\narchitecture of platforms such as eBay.com are a kind\nof `invisible engine' that choice runs on, facilitating and\nstructuring how transactions and economic interactions\nbetween different actors take place (Evans et al., 2006:\ncately interconnected, often asymmetric, relationships\nand interests in this arrangement. Indeed, Gillespie\ncalls to attention the `politics' of platforms, highlighting\nthe `tensions inherent in their service: between user-gen-\nerated and commercially-produced content, between\ncultivating community and serving up advertising,\nbetween intervening in the delivery of content and\nthis further, one important aspect we must consider is\nwhat the `technical architecture [of platforms] allows\nfeatures of platforms are part of the `engine' that drives\nchoice, then users are not only passive consumers-\nqua-choosers, but also in one sense the Big Data\n`fuel' that platforms run on.\nThe work involved in creating and maintaining plat-\nforms involves a heterogeneous array of individuals,\nincluding programmers, designers and paid content\ncheckers. Users are also an essential element.\nConsiderable work is involved in navigating, enacting\nand co-constructing choice on platforms, as users are\nnot simply consuming, but also labouring to use, pro-\nduce and evaluate content. For example, account repu-\ntations on eBay.com are crucial to the economics of the\nplatform, and responsibility is placed on both sellers\nand buyers to attract and maintain positive feedback\nfrom one another. As eBay states: `Some buyers have\nbeen frustrated by the increasing number of sellers who\nrefuse to accept bids from buyers with a feedback rating\nof ``less than 10'' or ``any negative feedback''' (eBay,\n2017). Thus to participate on eBay, users must neces-\nsarily perform additional work above and beyond the\nsimplistic characterisation of comparing alternative\noptions and making a choice (and potentially also\nmaking a transaction).\nThis fusion of usage and production has been con-\nceptualised in terms of `produsage'. Bruns' notion of\nprodusage broadly describes the multi-directional\nflows of information that characterise the user-led con-\ntent-creation environment of contemporary platforms\n(Bruns, 2008). In this way, the dualism of the user-\nas-consumer (of web content) versus user-as-producer\ndoes not account for the blurring of roles that users\nhave, whereby they can `switch easily and effortlessly\nbetween these two roles \u00ad allowing, ultimately, for the\nemergence of a hybrid role in between: that of the pro-\nchoice-infused platforms must perform constant work\nto compare between options, experience and enact\nchoice, and produce and sell goods and services.\nWithout this work, the platform economy risks a down-\nturn or even failure. Platform operators govern an\ninteractive space that choice runs on (or is an emergent\nproperty of), without needing to curate and control it\ndirectly.\nIn this sense, platforms tend be oriented towards\nwhat Ritzer has termed `prosumer capitalism' (2015a).\nRitzer and Jurgenson argue that `in producer and con-\nsumer capitalism, corporations are likely to exert great\ncontrol over the production and/or consumption of\ncontent (goods and services), but in prosumer capital-\nism companies are more likely to stand back and to\nmeddle less with the prosumers who are producing\n`prosumption' provides an interpretive key to the plat-\nform logic of choice-infused websites, which involves\nboth production and consumption rather than a specific\nThis augments the notion of `produsage' (Bruns and\nSchmidt, 2011), as it attends not only to the user experi-\nence, but also the economies and politics of commen-\nsuration within platforms. It accounts further for the\nconsiderable work or labour that is involved in produ-\ncing, navigating and transacting choice on these plat-\nforms. Who are prosumers in this scenario? They are\nusers who not only work to `produse' content in the\nweb space, but in doing so also shape the market pro-\ncesses and economies in which choice operates. Ritzer\nprovides a key insight, arguing that users are\n`. . . increasingly making all-but-the-most-complex\ntravel arrangements on one's own through various\nwebsites (e.g., Travelocity, Expedia); doing all of the\nwork on websites such as Amazon.com including\nmaking the appropriate choices for items to be pur-\nchased, providing needed delivery and payment infor-\nmation, and making one's way through the various\nsteps needed to complete the process; as buyers doing\nthe largely digital work of providing a body of infor-\nmation on themselves to eBay and if (when) they are\nsellers on that which they are offering for sale.' (Ritzer,\nThrough the prosumption processes of such platforms,\nusers provide free digital labour that is highly beneficial\nto other users, but even more so for website operators\n(Anderson, 2010). There is a blurring of leisure and\nlabour time (Fuchs, 2014) that characterises digital pro-\nsumption on these platforms. For example, Yelp.com\ndoes not directly sell goods or services, but the devices\nand functionalities it provides users to navigate choice\n(i.e., comparing businesses and restaurants) generates\nmassive amounts of data that, as I have argued\nbefore, operationalise and sustain a dynamically chan-\nging landscape of choice through the platform. This\nreconfiguration of choice through prosumption on plat-\nforms has a performative effect on the market (Callon,\n1998), which recursively responds to new and emergent\n`prosumer' activities generated around the clock.\nFigure 2 shows an example of private services on\nPeoplePerHour that are extremely tailored and niche\nservices, and may be popular today, but not tomorrow.\nPlatforms configure users as prosumers of a dynamically\nshifting landscape of choice, rather than a landscape of\nchoice that is static (where the options on offer change\nrelatively infrequently over time, such as one might\nexperience in a local convenience store or a choice-\ninfused website such as Ikea.com, for example).\nThis performative dimension suggests that these\nplatforms are, drawing on MacKenzie (2006), not\nsimply `cameras' that present choice and enable com-\nparisons between different options, but also `engines'\nthat drive and expand choice and categories that\ncome to define choice. This idea resonates with the\nnotion of platforms as `invisible engines' discussed pre-\nviously (see Evans et al., 2006). One implication is that\nplatform architectures may engender more choice at the\nsame time as structuring how users (qua produsers)\nnavigate it. In a sense, these commercially-oriented\nlarge-scale platforms appear to intensify post-Fordist\nprosumption processes to a hyper level: goods and ser-\nvices are able to be produced, compared and transacted\nat great speed. The implication for users is that their\nexperience of choice is co-extensive with, and\nFigure 2. Highly individualised and specialized private services (PeoplePerHour.com).\n6 Big Data & Society\ndifferentiated via, the actions of a multitude of others\nwho inhabit the platform, which in turn are structured\nthrough the platform architectures. Choice in this sense\n`goes beyond' or `overshoots' its conventional bound-\naries, pointing towards the notion of `hyper-choice' as a\nrelevant way to understand what is happening to choice\nand choice-making practices in the context of plat-\nforms. Seemingly benign features of platform architec-\ntures intensify and produce choice, and more\nimportantly produce the appearance of choice by struc-\nturing the field of action of users in particular ways. In\nthis sense platform architectures are constitutive of a\nproductive form of power (Foucault, 1982) that not\nonly facilitates and constrains action, but, as I will\nexamine in the next section, also construct and seek\nto produce certain forms of subjectivity.\nConstructing (or exploiting) choice\nthrough individualisation and\nsubjectivity\nThe discussion so far has demonstrated the crucial role\nthat users have to play in constructing and maintaining\nchoice-infused platforms. In this final section I will\ndevelop this further by looking at the way in which\nplatforms actively seek to drive and shape users towards\nparticipating and contributing to the online space,\nwhich seeks to govern users and construct their field\nof action in strategic ways. Revisiting the example of\nYelp, we might consider how large-scale consumer\nchoice platforms such as Yelp constantly present\nusers with opportunities to `produse' content, for\nexample by uploading photos and videos of visits to\nrestaurants as part of their reviews. At the same time,\nusers are presented with `offer[s] of subjectivation'\nthem and also produce content that relates to and\nproduces knowledge about the options on offer. For\nexample, Figure 3 shows how each photo uploaded\nby `Jane D.' (de-identified alias) has a `like' button\n(i.e., unary rating), which offers users a chance to\nbecome `produsers' and not only evaluate Jane D.'s\ncontent, but also take up this offer of subjectivation\nto express themselves as someone who `likes' the food\nand beverages from the restaurant that is under evalu-\nation (i.e., `Coffee Anthology').\nIn contrast to the liberalist perspective that choice\nconstitutes the freedom that individuals have to make\nrational decisions, this example of Yelp further serves\nto illustrate how choice on platforms is something that\ncan be engineered, shaped, calculated and governed in\norder to `structure the possible field of action' of users\nkey relationship between the choosing subject and the\nnotion of `interest', that is, `a subject of interest, by\nwhich I mean a source of interest, the starting point\nof an interest, or the site of a mechanism of interests'\nof the subject (in this case user) become the interests of\ngovernment (platform operator): users become the cor-\nrelate of a governmentality that manufactures and\nshapes the environment and variables in which\n`choice' is exercised. As web users we are no less `gov-\nerned through our freedom' than in other domains of\nFigure 3. Offers of subjectivation through user-generated media (Yelp.com).\non platforms that shape and govern us through our\nagential capacities. Thus platforms offer particular\nkinds of subjectivity to users, and moreover these are\ndigitally mediated consumer subjectivities that construct\nusers as distinctly neoliberal subjects. Sauter (2013)\ndraws on Rose's ideas to highlight `how information\nand communication technologies (ICTs) contribute to\nconverting the rational-economic expectations of neo-\nliberal governments into the subjective personal aims of\nPinterest platform, Sauter argues that it `encourage[s]\nusers to self-manage their lives, maximise their poten-\ntial . . . constantly seeking to improve and perfect them-\nselves and display this activity publicly' (2013: 8). Thus\nplatforms such as Yelp do not simply provide tools for\nusers to make comparisons and enact choice, but offer\nopportunities to become the kinds of citizen-consumer\nsubjects that align with, or do not deviate too far from,\nthe goals and rationalities of the platform (such as the\naccumulation and retention of users).\nIn advancing this argument further, we observe how\nplatform users are often subjected to technologies of\nperformance measurement that provides numeric\nlevels of their contribution to the platform (e.g.,\n`Level 3 Contributor'), which is attributed to, and\nmakes up, their individual profile. This configures\nusers towards a logic of competition and self-\nadvancement that is expressed through their individu-\nality. Figure 4 exemplifies the subjectification of users\non Tripadvisor.co.uk, quantifying and measuring their\nactivity or contribution to the platform by measuring it\nquantitatively. Activity conducted within the web space\nis tied to the self through the individualising effects of\nprofiles (e.g., `Jill Smith' is a Level 5 Contributor), and\nbecomes meaningful in the context of the broad net-\nworked public composed of individuals who convene\ntogether in the online space (boyd, 2011). Indeed,\nbeyond the illustrative example provided here, the\nquantification of these kinds of user practices has\nbeen studied empirically by David and Pinch (2006)\nIt follows that a key aspect of individualisation and\nsubjectivation on choice-infused platforms is the role of\nthe user profile. As Graham argues, platforms often\nurge users to log into the site using existing social net-\nworking site (SNS) profiles under the proviso that\ndoing so is much faster and more convenient than set-\nMoreover, if a user decides to log in using their SNS\nprofile, they are subsequently using the site not as an\nanonymous reader, but in a sense as themselves. Unlike\nother kinds of web spaces, users of these platforms are\nnot anonymous and undifferentiated entities, but are\nconfigured as unique individuals with a self-identifying\nname and personalising characteristics and attributes,\nvisible to private social networks and networked pub-\nlics. For example, if a user of TripAdvisor logs in using\ntheir Facebook account and clicks `like' on a particular\nhotel, they are liking the hotel in the capacity of their\nself. They authorise the platform to use their data,\nwhich, in the case of Facebook, often includes rich\nand detailed personal information, and this in turn is\nredeployed by the platform.\nFigure 4. Individualisation and subjectification of users through performance measurement (TripAdvisor.com).\n8 Big Data & Society\nAs Figure 5 shows, Trip Advisor co-opts users' exist-\ning social networks to encourage them to join their\nfriends by participating within the site. This is an\noffer that the user can accept or refuse \u00ad if they refuse\nto sign in with Facebook, they subsequently miss out\non participating on TripAdvisor as part of their friend-\nship network. This `offer of subjectivation' (Latour,\nauthentic user-consumer and produser of the platform,\ni.e., a user who is configured within a consumerist dis-\ncourse of choice and is actively enrolled in producing,\nfor example, reviews and ratings that are visible to, and\nopen to evaluation from, private social networks and\nthe general networked public. To the extent that users\nengage with and take up these offers of subjectivation,\nplatforms have a productive power that creates certain\nforms of subjectivity as digitally experienced expres-\nsions of self. To be sure, I am not suggesting that plat-\nforms cause or determine particular forms of\nsubjectivity, but rather that these technologies `attri-\nbute various capacities, qualities and statuses to par-\nticular agents . . . that these agents come to experience\nThus the design architecture of choice-infused plat-\nforms attempts to link up the interests and rationalities\nof the operators with the interests and self-governing\ncapacities of users. If users are satisfied, they will come\nback, are more likely to make a transaction, and they\nwill keep produsing content within the space. As previ-\nously discussed, this provides free digital labour for\nplatforms (Amazon built an empire on user-submitted\nratings), and users may do so because in varying\ndegrees they govern themselves through and/or are\naffected by the labels, badges and categories that signify\nindividuality, social status, reputation and achievement\ntive feedback' on eBay). Ekbia and Nardi reason about\nthe `affective rewards' that these types of systems pro-\nduce, arguing that users and enterprises (read here as\nplatforms) both gain benefits, although the benefits are\nasymmetrically weighted in favour of enterprises (2014,\nsection 1.2). These processes of governing users\nthrough their affective subjectivities shapes and drive\nchoice by configuring users as instruments of know-\nledge production (e.g., generating ratings and reviews).\nBoth the platform and the user are not left unchanged\nby their interactions and entanglement in this environ-\nment constructed through flows of Big Data and\npractices of categorisation and commensuration.\nA particular type of choice and experience of choice-\nmaking is produced with and via the self-governing\ncapacities, actions, and individuality of users. As\nIntrona argues, `they [users] internalize these calculat-\ning practices, and the knowledge they legitimate, to\nsubjectivities and interests link up to, and become\nFigure 5. Harnessing users' social networks to gain and retain attention on the website (TripAdvisor.com).\nenmeshed with, the interests and rationalities of\nplatforms.\nThis is interesting in light of Bucher's argument that\nalgorithms that underpin Web 2.0 may lead users to\ninternalise the subjectivities of the website operators\n(2012). It may be possible that website users, through\nrepeated use of categories over time, may come to\ninternalise the subjectivities of the website operators,\nwhich I have identified here in the context of choice-\ninfused platforms as pro-capitalist and characteristic-\nally neoliberal constructions of self. As Hearn (2010)\nargues, Web 2.0 practices `function to direct human\nmeaning-making and self-identity in highly motivated\nand profitable ways' (abstract, 2010). Again, this is not\nto argue that these processes are deterministic, but to\nhighlight a powerful aspect of how such platforms\nshape both choice and users. Thus platforms may in\nfact intensify and reproduce consumerist and pro-capi-\ntalist modalities of choice, contributing to the expan-\nsion of consumer choice (read hyper-choice) that I\ndiscussed in the introduction to this paper, whilst at\nthe same time ostensibly appearing to reduce and\nnarrow down choice for users.\nAlthough these kinds of governmental strategies and\neffects are certainly not reducible to choice, it is evident\nthat choice, platform architectures and users are bound\nup together in a complex relationship. To a certain\nextent, platforms and individual subjectivity are\nco-constitutive, existing and transforming in a feedback\nloop mediated through the architecture of the space.\nChoice, in this platform configuration, appears to\ntake on a machinic aspect as it is not clear where the\nmachine (platform features and architecture) starts and\nthe human (user) ends. In this sense choice appears to\nhave an inter-objectivity that resonates with Morton's\nnotion of `hyperobjects', whereby `nothing is ever\nexperienced directly, but only as mediated through\nother entities in some shared sensual space' (2013:\n86). Although I would not go so far as to construe\nchoice as a hyperobject in the broader sense used by\nMorton, in the context of large-scale platforms choice\nand choice-making practices appear to exhibit `hyper'\nqualities. For example, we come to know the value of\nthings through ratings devices, which mediate the opin-\nions and experiential knowledge of an unknown public\ndistributed across space and time (`product X has a\n2-star rating based on 1,000 user ratings'). Similarly,\nwe come to know the identities of human entities on\nplatforms through the platform-specific systems of clas-\nsification that are used to categorise, order and differ-\nentiate them. Thus, as for technology and human\nagency more generally, platforms, users, and choice\ndo not merely have complex relationships, but in dif-\nfering degrees co-constitute one another (Verbeek,\n2005). Choice in the context of platforms transcends\nour conventional understandings of it, both ontologic-\nally (what choice is and the entities that are involved)\nand epistemologically (how choice is categorised,\nordered and produced, as well as the shifting practices\nand dynamics of choice-making).\nConclusion\nIn this paper I have argued that large-scale web-based\nplatforms such as Amazon, Yelp and TripAdvisor not\nonly enable users to experience and enact choice, but\npresuppose and engender a kind of `hyper-choice' that\ngoes beyond, overshoots, and fundamentally challenges\nour normal understanding of what choice is and how it\nis constituted. In developing this idea, I made four main\narguments.\nFirstly, the myriad ratings, reviews and ranking\ndevices deployed by platforms combined with large vol-\numes of user-generated Big Data have resulted in a\nfundamental reconfiguration of knowledge production\nabout choice that reimagines, re-specifies, and perhaps\nin some cases nullifies, pre-existing standards and\nsystems that used to define choice. For example,\nTripAdvisor's rating system collapses longstanding\nindustry standards for differentiating accommodation\noptions.\nSecondly, platform architectures have brought about\na breakdown or hybridisation of longstanding dualisms\nthat we use to understand consumer choice and web\nuse, such as producers versus consumers and users\nversus producers. As a result, consumer choice on plat-\nforms such as Yelp requires new conceptual devices to\nunderstand how it is enacted, who and what is involved\nin the production and reproduction of markets, and\nhow to make sense of the increasingly blurred lines\nbetween choice and choosers.\nThirdly, I examined productive modes of power\nwhereby platforms actively seek to shape and construct\nsubjectivities so that users come to govern themselves in\nways that do not deviate too far from the goals of the\nplatform. Platform architectures are not designed for\nusers inasmuch as they are designed with and around\nthe self-governing and individual agential capacities of\nindividuals. What we understand as choice is not\na priori to platforms, but instead platforms construct\nparticular forms of choice and experiences of choice-\nmaking. In effect, platform architectures actively seek\nto produce and reproduce particular kinds of con-\nsumerist and neoliberal subjectivities that link up with\nthe aims, rationalities and imaginaries of platform\noperators.\nFinally, from a user-centric perspective I point\ntowards the curious, perhaps even paradoxical, notion\nthat these large-scale choice-infused platforms might\ncontribute to reconfiguring, driving, expanding and\n10 Big Data & Society\nspeeding up choice at the same time as presenting a\nstructured space in which users navigate and narrow\ndown an overabundance of it. To be sure, this paper\nhas only considered specific aspects of platforms,\nnamely the ratings and rankings devices deployed by\nthem, as well as theories that help us make sense of\nplatform architectures vis-a\n` -vis `choice'. Space pre-\ncluded a more comprehensive consideration of other\nkey dimensions of platforms, including recommender\nsystems, the politics of algorithms, and data practices,\nto name a few. Further, this study focussed on con-\nsumer choice (rather than choice more broadly) and\npractices of choice and consumption in privileged and\npredominantly Western countries. The over-abundance\nof choice and accessibility of Internet technologies\nexperienced in these geographies is not universal. I\nnote these as limitations of the study and key areas\nfor future work.\nIn conclusion, there is something markedly different\nabout choice in an increasingly platform-saturated web.\nChoice has in a sense become hyper \u00ad the technical,\nsocial, and political infrastructures of platforms have\nrapidly reconfigured our experience of choice and our\nroles in relation to it. Perhaps in some ways large-scale\nplatforms such as Yelp and TripAdvisor have transi-\ntioned beyond our conventional understandings of\nchoice and choosers. In various modes and levels of\nintensity we are confronted with a complex, hybrid,\nperhaps even paradoxical, picture: is this the emerging\ncondition of hyper-choice in platform environments?\n"
