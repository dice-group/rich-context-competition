Left anterior decending artery, right coronary artery and left circumflex artery\npericoronary EATTwere measured. Demographic, clinical and CAD risk factor data were obtained\nfrom medical records.\nResults: Patients with CAD (n \u00bc 49) had significantly larger mean EATT than those without CAD\n(n \u00bc 101). Pericoronary EATTwas significantly correlated with body mass index, total cholesterol\nlevel, coronary artery calcium score, hypertension and diabetes mellitus history.\nConclusions: There is an association between pericoronary EATTand CAD, as well as CAD risk\nfactors. Pericoronary EATT measurement may become a widely used, easy-to-perform method for\ndetermining CAD risk.\n",

Patients\nwere informed about the necessity of hold-\ning their breath and avoiding movement\nbefore the start of the examination, to\nshorten the scan duration and ensure patient\ncompliance. Patients were given 5 mg iso-\nsorbide dinitrate (sublingual) 2\u00ad4 min before\nimage acquisition in order to dilate the\ncoronary arteries. Patients with heart rate\n>70 bpm received 5 mg metoprolol tartrate\n(intravenous) until their heart rate reached\nand lower scanning limits were determined\nby obtaining anteroposterior and lateral\nscanograms at the beginning of the examin-\nation.

Adiponectin\ndecreases insulin resistance and has a protect-\nive role in the formation of atherosclerosis.21\nAdiponectin levels have been found to be\nlower in epicardial tissue than in subcutane-\nous fat, in patients with CAD.22\nEpicardial adipose tissue secretes pro-\nand anti-inflammatory mediators that con-\ntribute to the formation of CAD. Increased\nunderstanding of the pathophysiological\nrole of EAT has led to a search for imaging\nmethods that can provide EATT measure-\nments and detect CAD. An echocardiog-\nraphy study found associations between\nEATT and risk factors for CAD, such as\nBMI, age and C-reactive protein levels, as\nwell as a correlation between CAD severity\nand increased EATT.23 Echocardiography\nhas also revealed thicker EAT in patients\nwith metabolic syndrome than in healthy\ncontrols,24 and an association between\nthicker EAT and poor prognosis in patients\nwith acute coronary syndromes.25 A further\nechocardiography study found no associ-\nation between CAD severity and EATT,\nhowever.2 The limited echocardiography\nwindow available for the visualization and\nmeasurement of EATT thickness can limit\nthe efficiency of this technique in determin-\ning the full measurement of fat surrounding\nthe heart. A study examining the reproduci-\nbility of echocardiography EATT findings\nidentified large interobserver differences\nand, as a result, echocardiography was\nreported to be of limited use for EATT\nAlthough conventional angiography\nis the gold standard for diagnosis of\ncoronary artery disease, MDCT coronary\nTable 2.

We therefore measured\npericoronary EATT in order to examine the\nrelationship between epicardial adipose\ntissue and coronary heart disease. Few\nstudies have investigated pericoronary\npostmenopausal women found positive rela-\ntionships between pericoronary EATT and\nage, body weight, BMI, waist circumference,\nwaist-to-hip circumference ratio, smoking\nstatus, blood glucose and low serum high-\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol concentra-\ntions.32 In contrast to the present study,\nthe study population was made up entirely\nof older women, and age and sex are known\nrisk factors for CAD. We also examined\nother CAD risk factors and observed that\npericoronary EAT was significantly thicker\nin patients with CAD than in those without.\nPositive correlations were found between\npericoronary EATT and total cholesterol,\nBMI, coronary artery calcium score, hyper-\ntension and diabetes mellitus in the present\nstudy. Although pericoronary EAT was\nthicker in patients with high LDL-C, this\ncorrelation was not statistically significant.\nSimilar findings have been reported by\nothers,32 and this lack of significance may\nbe due to the different proportional distri-\nbution of other risk factors in our study.\nPericoronary EATT was not correlated with\neither cigarette smoking or family history in\nthe present study, which may also be due to\ndifferences in the distribution of CAD risk\nfactors.\nThe present study had several limitations.\nEATT measurements were made from the\nthickest region around the LAD, LCX and\nRCA, but interobserver differences are pos-\nsible. In addition, factors, including the low\nnumber of patients and differences in the\ndistribution of CAD risk factors between\nindividuals limited the statistical power.\nIn conclusion, the present study reveals a\nrelationship between pericoronary EATT\nand CAD, as well as an association between\npericoronary EATT and CAD risk factors.\nPericoronary EATT measurement may\nbecome a widely used, easy-to-perform\nmethod for determining CAD risk.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
