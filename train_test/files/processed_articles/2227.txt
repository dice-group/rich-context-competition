Strata include children's hos-\npitals and four general hospital size strata defined by annual\nnumber of ED visits.18 Each case is assigned a sample\nweight; these are summed to provide national estimates.\nMiscodings are minimized by: weekly reviews of random\nsamples of written narratives abstracted verbatim from the\nmedical record, five trained coders visually reviewing narra-\ntives and coded data elements for every NEISS-AIP case,\nCPSC supervisors visiting each hospital once or twice yearly\nand blindly abstracting from the records of a random\nsample of ED cases and extensive batch edits on the final\ndataset. NEISS-AIP personnel estimate that ,1% of\nrecords, on average, are miscoded (personal communication,\nwith NEISS product code 1716 (`hypodermic needles and\nsyringes') and/or comments with the letter strings:\n`hypodermic', `needle', `needlestick', `needle-stick', `needle\nstick', `percutaneous injur', `sharp injur', `sharps injur' or\n`syringe' and without comments, indicating that the injury\nwas related to occupational activities, receipt or provision of\nprofessional healthcare, medical training, drug use, lancets\nor non-medical needles. Of note, inadvertent inclusion of\nrecords related to these activities would bias toward an over-\nestimation of CANSI rates. NEISS-AIP data and associated\nmedical records cannot be accessed by non-NEISS research-\ners. OSP personnel performed my specified record selec-\ntions and SAS runs.\nUS National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care\nSurveys (NHAMCS), directed by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics (NCHS), CDC\nThe elements and levels of CANSI-associated ED medical\nservice, procedures, treatment and medication were deter-\nNHAMCS include a four-stage systematic random sample\nof all injury- and non-injury-related patient visits to\nnon-Federal hospitals, during randomly assigned 4-week\nreporting periods. Trained hospital personnel complete\npatient record forms, which are reviewed and validated by\nNCHS staff and include data on the patient's complaint(s),\ncause of the injury, diagnostic/screening services, medical\nprocedures, medications, types of providers seen, discharge\ndiagnoses, follow-up disposition (if any) and expected\nsource(s) of payment.19,20 NCHS field representatives review\nthe logs used for visit sampling to determine whether any\ncases were missed and edit completed forms for missing\ndata, which is sought through consultation with hospital\nstaff and medical record review. Quality control for the\nmedical and drug coding operation, as well as straight-key\nitems, includes a two-way, 10% independent verification pro-\ncedure. All forms with coding variations or illegible entries\nrelated to the reason for a visit, diagnostic and therapeutic\nprocedures, diagnosis, International Classification of\nDiseases (ICD) diagnosis E codes, or medication items are\nreviewed and adjudicated at NCHS.\nI could not access medical records, but I used the follow-\ning four-step process to select and internally validate the\ncases used in the NHAMCS analyses herein: (i) I examined\nsis E codes even vaguely consistent with the possibility of a\ndescriptive variable (`vcause') can be used to provide event\ndetails. I examined vcause in each selected record and, if it\nindicated the injury involved healthcare or intentional action,\nI excluded it from the analyses. (iii) If the `payment source'\nvariable was coded as `Worker's Compensation', I excluded\nthe record from analyses. (iv) If the `work-related' (`workrel')\nvariable was marked `yes' and this was consistent with the\nvcause and payment source coding, I excluded the record from\nanalyses. For 16 records, workrel was coded `yes', payment\nwas not through worker's compensation and vcause did not\nsuggest that the injury was work-related. Those 16 records\nwere included in the NHAMCS CANSI analyses. Since\nNHAMCS data were used solely to characterize CANSI-\nrelated medical treatment and costs, this did not affect the\nCANSI incidence estimate. Fifty-one NHAMCS records\nmet the criteria for the CANSI analyses.\nAmbulatory Medical Care Surveys (NAMCSs) collected nee-\ndlestick injury data from outpatient departments and physi-\ncians' offices. I examined those data and determined that, at\nmost, three records from outpatient departments and two\nfrom physicians' offices might have been associated with\nCANSIs. These are not included herein because (i) those\nnumbers of needlestick injuries were inadequate for analysis\nand (ii) the data were not collected in other years.19\u00ad 22\nCost estimates\nI estimated costs associated with various elements/levels of\nservice using Current Procedural Terminology Coding\nadvice of physicians, CPT coding experts and hospital\nbilling officers. I based medication costs on a standard\ncourse of therapy with generic medications, unless a particu-\nlar brand name was specified in the NHAMCS record. For\neach record, cost calculations took into account the specified\nhealthcare providers, time spent receiving care, procedures/\ntreatments, laboratory tests and medications.\nIn order to maximize the estimated cost of ED-associated\nmedical care, I made the following assumptions:\n(i) NHAMCS forms have separate (yes/no) variables for\nthe following blood tests: complete blood cell count,\nblood urea nitrogen, creatinine, cardiac enzymes, elec-\ntrolytes, glucose, liver function tests, arterial blood\ngases, blood alcohol, `HIV serology' (antibody status)\nand `other blood test(s)'. If other blood test(s) was marked\n`yes' and specified blood tests did not add up to the\nspecified `total number of laboratory studies done', I\nassumed that HBV and HCV serology were done.\n(ii) If HIV serology was blank and not marked `no' and\nother blood test was marked `yes', I assumed that HIV\nantibody testing was done.\n(iii) If a patient's disposition was `refer to [another] phys-\nician/clinic for follow-up' or `refer to other physician',\nI assumed that the referral was to an infectious disease\nspecialist and he/she provided an initial evaluation and\nthe maximum prophylaxis and follow-up recom-\nmended for healthcare-associated NSIs, including\nHBV immunoglobulin; HBV vaccine; HBV, HCV and\nHIV serology; HIV prophylaxis (nelfinavir 1250 mg\nweeks with full serology; follow-up evaluation at 4\u00ad6\nmonths with full serology and follow-up evaluation at\n1 year with HIV serology.25 Of note, CANSIs rarely\nrequire this full constellation of treatment and follow-\nup (reference 25 and Appendix).\nOther data sources\nI obtained US population figures from census reports.26\nSince most medical self-injections are of insulin, I used\nthese as a surrogate for all self-injections. Of note, this over-\nestimates the per-person/per-injection cost of CANSIs. The\nnumbers of insulin-injecting US diabetes patients !18 years\nold and insulin injections received per year were obtained\nfrom the 2011 US Roper Diabetes Patient Market Study\nRoper survey of non-military, non-institutionalized US\nadults with diabetes, which estimated the annual numbers of\nadults with diabetes by applying regressions of CDC's\nNational Health Interview Survey and Behavioral Risk\nFactor Surveillance System estimates to Roper survey data\n(Data provided by and cited with the permission of GfK\nCustom Research LLC, www.gfk.com.)\nData analyses\nAll analyses retained NEISS-AIP's and NHAMCS's weight-\ning, strata and primary sampling unit design variables and\nused SAS SAS/STATw Version 9.2's survey module (SAS\nInstitute, Cary, NC). NEISS-AIP's sampling design permits\nstatistically reliable estimation if the estimate is based on\n!20 records and the associated coefficient of variation is\n30%; NHAMCS's design requires !30 records and an\nassociated standard error of the estimate of 30%.\nResults\ntreatment, for a median of 1937 per year, with no consistent\nobserved temporal trend in annual numbers (Table 1).\nold). Fifty-six percent of recorded CANSIs were to women.\nThe type of needle was mentioned in 21% of records:\nEpiPens, in 4%, and insulin syringes, in 17%.\nBased on the vcause variable, 10 records with needlestick\ninjury-ICD codes involved an intentional injection (e.g.\ntherapeutic receipt of epinephrine) and 18 involved a com-\nplication of illegal drug use (e.g. a drug overdose or infec-\ntion at an injection site). At least 75 of these injuries were\nreceived while the individual was providing healthcare,\nworking in a medical setting, or as a complication of receiv-\ning healthcare (e.g. `infiltration at the site of blood drawing').\nAt least 17 others were work-related. These (n \u00bc 120) were\nall excluded from NHAMCS analyses, leaving 51\nCANSI-related records. If record inclusion had been based\nsolely on ICD coding, the CANSI number would have been\nFor 26 of the 51 records, the vcause variable provided no\ninformation other than `needle stick'. In 14 records, vcause\nindicated the site of injury: finger (n \u00bc 6), foot or `stepped\non a needle' (n \u00bc 4), thumb (n \u00bc 2), hand (n \u00bc 1) and\nforearm (n \u00bc 1). In three records, vcause noted the injury oc-\ncurred while emptying garbage or handling a plastic bag;\none, walking barefoot in a hotel room; two, on a beach; one,\nplaying in a park and one, in an alley. In one record, vcause\nnoted that the source was unknown and in one, the needle\nwas a neighbor's. In three records, vcause referred to the\nneedle as `dirty' and in one, vcause noted that the patient\nwas concerned `it might be a drug needle and for HIV'. In\ntwo records, vcause mentioned an EpiPen and in one, a\n`syringe'.\nAll 51 CANSI-related NHAMCS records represented\ninitial visits. One patient was admitted for several hours of\nobservation. Three received intravenous fluids; two received\nbronchodilator inhalation therapy. Two patients arrived by\nambulance. No information was available concerning the\nreasons for these treatments, other than the injury code.\nForty-eight patients were treated by a physician. One\nreceived a follow-up appointment to an associated clinic; 20\nwere referred to another physician. While in the ED, nine\nreceived tetanus toxoid; two, HIV prophylaxis; two, HBV\nvaccine and one, anti-HBV immunoglobulin.\nEstimation of healthcare-associated costs\nThe median estimated cost of ED evaluation, diagnostic\nstudies and treatment was $575 (Table 2); the range was\n$415 (for a patient who was not seen by a physician and\nreceived no tests or medications) to $3371. When the poten-\ntial costs associated with referral to infectious diseases physi-\ncians were included in the calculations, the median estimated\ncost of CANSI-associated medical treatment was $5078,\nBased on these median cost figures, the estimated annual\nnational medical costs of ED-treated CANSIs were $1.1\nmillion for ED care alone and $9.8 million for both ED\nTable 1 Number and rate of community-acquired needlestick/sharp injuries treated in US emergency departments, 2001\u00ad08, NEISS-AIPa\nYear Case count National estimate 95% CI for estimate CV Rateb 95% CI for rate US population\nCI, confidence interval; CV, coefficient of variation\naThe US National Electronic Injury Surveillance System All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) data herein include needlestick and sharp (but not lancet) injuries\noccurring outside of healthcare and work settings (n \u00bc 327).

First, CANSI estimates should not be based\nsolely on ICD coding. Based on NHAMCS's descriptive\nvariables, doing so might overestimate actual rates by over\n3-fold. Second, CANSIs requiring ED care are rare events\nand require relatively minimal medical care. These findings\nare consistent with and expand on those of several studies\ndone in local communities or health facilities in the UK,\nthe Netherlands and Canada.27 \u00ad 29 Third, although self-\nadministration of medications has escalated in the USA,\nthere has not been a concomitant increase in ED-treated\nWhat is already known on this topic\nFor any needlestick injury, the most critical medical question\nis its likelihood of transmitting a blood-borne pathogen--\nparticularly HIV, HBV or HCV. Empirical data, scientific\nevidence and theoretical considerations all support that\npathogen transmission from a CANSI is extraordinarily un-\nlikely (Appendix). The risk factors for transmission include\nthe involvement of a larger gauge hollow-bore needle (as\nused in phlebotomy or blood sampling from a vascular line),\ndeep injury and/or a procedure involving a needle that was\nin the artery or vein.30,31 Insulin devices and EpiPens have\nsmall gauge needles. NHAMCS data herein support that\nCANSIs are to extremities, not blood vessels. Worldwide,\nthere have been only three reported cases each of HBV32\u00ad34\nand HCV35,36 and no documented case of HIV transmission\nfrom non-healthcare-associated needlestick injuries.25 Two of\nthe HCV infections were from occupational exposure; all\nthree HBV transmissions were to persons without adequate\nvaccination and/or post-exposure prophylaxis.\nDespite this evidence, there are concerns that members\nof the general public may be at increasing risk of infections\nfrom injuries caused by: (i) used needles/syringes discarded\nby persons legally self-injecting medication and (ii) disposed\nneedles/syringes that have been found, reused and redis-\ncarded by persons illegally self-injecting addictive substances\n(IDUs). These concerns have led to guidelines for safe\nneedle/sharp disposal6\u00ad 8,13,14 but further legislation, regula-\ntions and programs are being advocated, including `take-\nback programs' and `Extended Producer Responsibility' laws\nTable 2 Estimated per-patient and US national health care costs\nassociated with community-acquired, non-occupational needlestick\ninjuries treated in US EDs\nMedian (mean)\nPer-patient costa,b\nAnnual US emergency room costs associated with these injuriesa,b,c\nAnnual US emergency room and maximum projected referral costs\nassociated with these injuriesa,b,c\naThe per-patient cost estimate was based on data extracted from 51\nED records in the 2003\u00ad09 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care\nSurveys (NHAMCS). See the Methods section for details.\nbIndividual patient costs were calculated using 2010 Medicare rates\nand include all treatments, testing, radiographic studies and blood\nwork done in the ED. Referral costs include the projected costs\nassociated with the maximal care that would be provided by infectious\ndisease specialists (see the Methods section for details). Medical costs\nthat would be incurred if any patient developed HBV, HCV, HIV or\nother infections, as a result of the needlestick injury, were not included\nin these calculations. These costs also do not include expenses\nassociated with non-ambulance transportation, time lost from work,\nchild care needed while a patient was receiving medical care, etc.\ncThe estimated median and mean total costs were calculated by\napplying NHAMCS median and mean per-patient costs to the median\nor mean annual number of injuries estimated from the 2001\u00ad08\nNational Electronic Injury Surveillance System All Injury Program\n(NEISS-AIP).

These analyses indicate that, despite the ballooning\nnumber of US persons self-injecting medications, ED-\ntreated CANSI rates have not increased and the associated\nmedical costs are relatively low.\nLimitations of this study\nThis study is limited in the following respects. First, it\nincludes only US incidents. However, its results are consistent\nwith those of localized studies from other countries.27\u00ad29\nSecond, it examines only ED-treated injuries. I could not\nlocate any accurate data concerning the number or medical\nsignificance of untreated CANSIs or concerning CANSIs\nsurveys included needlestick injuries treated at outpatient\ndepartments and physicians' offices; only five might have\nbeen unrelated to healthcare or occupation. This suggests\nthat medical treatment is predominantly provided at EDs.\nThird, these cost calculations do not include mental health-\ncare/counseling or non-medical expenses (e.g. child care\ncosts, travel expenses and/or income losses incurred while\nobtaining medical care). Fourth, I could not externally valid-\nate these data or review the medical records of any of the\ncases involved in this study. However, NEISS-AIP and\nNCHS extensively validate their data18 \u00ad 20 and, in this study,\nmy selection process included internal validation checks.\nFifth, I could not determine the indications for the medical\ncare provided to these patients, other than what was repre-\nsented by a diagnostic code. Some procedures (e.g. ambulance\ntransport, inhalation therapy and hospital observation) were\nlikely related to the patient's emotional reaction to their injury,\nnot the injury itself, but this could not be confirmed. Sixth,\nthese analyses support that ED-treated CANSIs are rare\nevents but, because of that rarity, these estimates are imprecise.\nSeventh, it must be emphasized that the calculations herein\npurposefully provide maximum estimates, to deter complaints\nby legislation and safety device advocates that these data under-\nrepresent the number and financial impact of CANSIs.\nThese limitations should be considered when interpreting\nthese estimates, but they do not negate the key finding of\nthis study: although the number of persons self-\nadministering insulin has ballooned in the past decade, there\nhas not been an observable increase in the incidence of\nCANSIs requiring US ED treatment. Indeed, the incidence\nof ED-treated CANSI was so low that statistically valid US\nestimates could be derived only from NEISS-AIP, an\nongoing survey devoted to injuries. Based on these data, it\nwould be difficult to justify additional legislation or the\nexpense of using needle-free or safe-injection devices in a\ncommunity setting. Prevention of blood-borne infections\nmight be better served by funding HBV vaccination and\nIDU syringe/needle exchange programs.\n"
