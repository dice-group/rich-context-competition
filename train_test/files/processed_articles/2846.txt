One of the most important transmis-\nsion channels operates on highly volatile business fixed investment. The monetary authori-\nties alter the terms and availability of credit, and impact investment in plant and equipment.\nWhile this textbook version of one transmission channel is widely accepted, questions re-\nmain about its empirical importance.1\nA key difficulty facing econometric assessments of this monetary policy channel is unrav-\nelling the complex dynamics that characterize business investment. While theoretical\nframeworks offer precise implications about long-run capital formation, these formal mod-\nels have proven less useful in formulating dynamic relations describing transitional invest-\nment behaviour. The roles of convex adjustment costs, costly reversibilities, and fixed\ncosts, inter alia, have been studied extensively, and important new insights have been de-\nveloped. However, little consensus exists on which factors are most relevant for modelling\ninvestment spending. Hence, the movement of investment spending at cyclical frequencies\nand its response to variations in interest rates are not fully understood.\nPartly in response to these gaps, research on finance constraints has been actively pursued\nover the past 15 years, and has increased understanding of short-run investment behaviour.\nAsymmetric information and monitoring frictions between borrowers and lenders result in\nincentive and agency problems that, in turn, create a wedge between the costs of internal\nand external finance. Perhaps the most important empirical implication is that financial\n* The authors acknowledge helpful comments from Heinz Herrmann and the Advisory Board of the\nBundesbank's Economic Research Centre, and the invaluable contribution of Fred Ramb with respect to\nthe construction of our user cost variable.

While the im-\nportance of financial factors on business investment decisions has been documented in\nmany studies, whether the coefficients on these variables signify finance constraints is an\nopen question. For example, Chirinko (1997) and Gomes (2001) show that, in formal op-\ntimising models, the effects of finance constraints can be capitalized into fundamentals,\nthus altering the interpretation and role of financial variables in investment equations. In\nAbel and Eberly (2002), investment spending by an optimising firm faced with uncertainty\nand imperfect competition depends on cash flow even though the firm does not face any fi-\nnance constraints. While one can accept the economic importance of finance constraints\nand the existence of a premium on external finance, doubts exist concerning precisely how\nthese financial factors enter formal theoretical models and affect the specification of an\neconometric investment equation.\nA further implication of finance constraints for firm behaviour is that real and financial de-\ncisions are intertwined. An important property of the separation theorem of Modigliani and\nMiller (1958) is that the supply of finance is infinitely elastic at the prevailing interest rate,\nand thus real investment decisions can be considered in isolation from financial decisions.\nAsymmetric information and monitoring cost frictions disrupt this separation theorem, and\nrequire that real and financial decisions be analysed in tandem. Benito and Young (2002)\ntake an important first step in that direction, but they stop short of modelling the dynamic\nconsequences of simultaneity.\nThese real/financial interactions, coupled with important ambiguities concerning the mod-\nelling of investment dynamics, suggest taking a new approach to understanding the invest-\nment process and its responses to monetary policy. We adopt a VAR methodology, and ap-\nproximate the complicated and incompletely understood relations among investment and\nits determinants as a VAR with minimal restrictions.\nWe begin our analysis in Section 1 by considering specification issues for our Vectorauto-\nregressive Investment Model (VIM). The neoclassical investment model developed by Jor-\ngenson (1963) guides the specification of the basic determinants of investment spending. In\nthis framework, sales is the quantity variable, and the user cost of capital is the price vari-\nable. (The user cost variable contains an interest rate, and is key to evaluating the effects of\nmonetary policy on investment spending.) We assume that firms operate in competitive\nmarkets and minimize cost; thus, price and quantity variables are exogenous. Recent re-\nsearch on finance constraints has demonstrated that cash flow is an important determinant\nof investment spending, and we include cash flow as our financial variable. That research\nhas also shown that financial decisions affect and are affected by real investment decisions\nand, hence, both investment and cash flow are endogenous. Furthermore, current cash flow\nshocks affect current investment but, owing to gestation and time-to-build lags, investment\ndoes not impact cash flow contemporaneously.\nEconometric issues are considered in Section 2. We estimate VIM with an equation-by-\nequation GMM procedure that is asymptotically efficient for our recursive system of dy-\nnamic simultaneous equations.2 Lag lengths are determined with two specification tests. As\nwith any VAR, the individual VIM coefficients are not meaningful in and of themselves.\nWe calculate dynamic multipliers, impulse responses, and error bands associated with the\nexogenous and endogenous variables, respectively.\nEstimates of our VIM are based on three unique datasets for German firms discussed in\nSection 3. First, as part of its rediscount lending operation, the Bundesbank collected a vast\namount of detailed financial statement data. After accounting for lags, outliers, and missing\nobservations, we have an unbalanced panel of 44,345 datapoints for 6,408 firms for the pe-\nriod 1988-1997. Second, we compute user costs of capital along the lines presented in King\nand Fullerton (1984), adapting important prior work by Harhoff and Ramb (2001) and\nRamb (forthcoming) for the purposes of this study. Third, in discharging its credit evalua-\ntion obligation, the Bundesbank routinely determined overall creditworthiness through a\ndetailed discriminant analysis.3 These confidential credit ratings are a precise indicator of\nthose firms facing a substantial external finance premium, and will be important in exam-\nining the differential responses by financial constrained and unconstrained firms. In combi-\nnation, these three datasets provide an exceptional opportunity to analyse the response of\ninvestment spending to changes in user costs and shocks to cash flow.\nSections 4 and 5 simulate VIM's estimated on different sub-samples. Section 4 provides\nbenchmark results with the full sample, and draws comparison between a single equation\ninvestment model in which financial variables are exogenous and VIM in which both real\nand financial variables are endogenous. Dynamic multipliers computed for changes in the\ntwo exogenous variables - user cost and sales - and impulse response computed for shocks\nto the two endogenous variables \u00ad investment and cash flow \u00ad are larger in VIM than in a\nsingle equation model. Endogenizing financial decisions leads to more substantial reactions\nby firms and a more potent monetary policy transmission channel. A 25 basis point in-\ncrease in short-term rates reduces investment by a substantial 3.1% in two years.\n2 Our econometric model differs from that used in the pioneering study of Holtz-Eakin, Newey and Rosen\n(1988). They estimated a VAR model excluding any contemporaneous variables, whereas we have a\nrecursive system of dynamic simultaneous equations.\n3 Since the implementation of the Monetary Union on January 1, 1999, the Bundesbank continues to\nassess creditworthiness in the course of the Eurosystem monetary policy operations, but it no longer\nrediscounts trade bills.\nThe roles of heterogeneity and finance constraints are explored in Section 5. Firms facing\nrelatively costly external finance are identified with our confidential Bundesbank credit-\nworthiness data. The sensitivity of these firms to changes in the exogenous variables and\nshocks to the endogenous variables are compared to firms that have a much lower external\nfinance premium. Firms with poor credit ratings do not react to changing economic condi-\ntions as given by relative prices or demand. This \"paralysis\" might be traceable to their ina-\nbility to finance investment. On the other hand and consistent with binding financing con-\nstraints, these endangered firms show a high responsiveness to cash flow shocks.\nSection 6 contains a summary and conclusions.\n1. Specifying VIM\n1.1. Some Perspective On Modeling Investment Spending\nThe primary focus of this study is on investment spending, and we begin with a considera-\ntion of investment modelling strategies appearing in the literature. In specifying an invest-\nment equation, it is important to distinguish between demand for the stock of capital and\ndemand for the flow of investment. Since the capital stock is a factor of production, the\nstandard tools of microeconomics can be used to relate the demand for capital, conditional\non output, to its \"price.\" The definition of this price variable is complicated by capital's du-\nrability. The important contributions of Jorgenson (1963) and Hall and Jorgenson (1967)\nrelate the price of durable capital to the user cost (or rental price) of capital, defined as a\nfunction of interest, tax, and depreciation rates and relative prices. With a readily measur-\nable user cost as a price variable, the long-run demand for capital can be easily analysed.\nComplications arise, however, when specifying the demand for the flow of investment.\nTwo sets of \"frictions\" introduce important and complex factors into the investment equa-\ntion. The first set of frictions includes dynamic elements such as convex adjustment costs\nwith changing the capital stock, delivery lags, vintage effects, costly reversibility con-\nstraints, time-to-build lags, fixed costs, and gestation lags. The interaction between these\nfrictions and durability forces the optimising firm to take a deep look into the future. Con-\nsequently, expectations of future variables are an additional dynamic element affecting the\ninvestment equation. The second set of frictions is due to asymmetric information and\ncostly monitoring between borrowers and lenders that, in turn, lead to constraints on the\navailability and cost of external finance. Finance constraints further imply that real and fi-\nnancial decisions are intertwined.\nWhile explicit models have the notable advantages of being based on a choice-theoretic\nframework and having coefficients in the econometric equation that can be identified with\ntechnology and expectation parameters, several problems have arisen. First, their empirical\nperformance has been disappointing, and coefficient estimates appear fragile in many ap-\nplications. Second, in most cases, they do not provide a framework for assessing the impact\nof monetary policy on investment spending that is the central concern of the present study.\nThird, there is a great deal of uncertainty about which of the frictions listed above are im-\nportant for understanding the investment decision. While additional work with explicit\nmodels is likely to yield valuable insights into the investment process, our analysis of\nmonetary policy transmission can best be undertaken with an implicit model given the cur-\nrent state of development of explicit models.\n1.2 The Investment Equation\nImplicit models are based on a less formal specification of the capital accumulation proc-\ness. Theory is used to suggest the determinants of investment spending that, in turn, enter\ninto a relatively unrestricted econometric equation.\nWe assume that the firm operates in competitive markets, and takes output and prices as\ngiven. (Since the median firm in our sample has 119 employees, this atomistic assumption\nseems appropriate.) Cost minimizing behaviour, coupled with a CES production function\n(Coen, 1969), results in the following specification of the logarithm of the optimal capital\nstock (k*),\nk*\nt\nuc*\nt\ns*\nt\nwhere uc*\nt\nis the logarithm of the long-run user cost of capital (described in detail in Sec-\ntion 3.2 and Appendix A), s*\nt\nis the logarithm of long-run sales, and the 's are parameters\nrelated to the production technology. In (1), the cost of finance is assumed independent of\nthe amount used by the firm; this assumption will be discussed below.\nThe challenge facing the applied econometrician is to translate the above demand for a\nstock of capital into the demand for the flow of investment. To derive a useful econometric\nspecification, we introduce dynamics with three assumptions. First, the adjustment of the\ncapital stock to its optimal level is distributed over time according to the following lag\nspecification,\nkt\n= It\n\u00ad  = (L) k*t\nwhere  is the first-difference operator, the difference in the logarithm of the capital stock\nequals the investment/capital ratio less depreciation (It\n- ), and (L) is a polynomial in\nthe lag operator representing technological constraints such as delivery lags and other fric-\ntions.\nSecond, following Jorgenson (1966), we assume that (L) can be approximated by a ra-\ntional lag polynomial, (L)/(1-(L)), and rewrite (2) as follows,\nIt\n\u00ad  = (L)/(1-(L)) k*t\nIt\n= (L) k*t\n+ (L) It-1\nwhere  =  (1\u00ad(1)). The (L)'s, (L)'s, and  contain technology parameters.\nThird, in preparing their decisions at time t, agents form expectations about the long-run\nvalues determining the optimal capital stock in (1). These expectations are based upon cur-\nrent and lagged values of variables determining the optimal capital stock and by lagged\nvalues of the dependent variable. Combining the above assumptions, identifying firm-spe-\ncific variables with an i index, and appending an error term (i,t\n), we obtain the following\ninvestment equation,\nIi,t\n= UC(L) uci,t\n+ S(L) si,t\n+ I/K(L) (Ii,t-1\n) + i\n+ i,t\nwhere the (L)'s are coefficients representing a mixture of technology and expectation pa-\nrameters. Thus, as with all implicit models, this specification is subject to the Lucas Cri-\ntique. While this objection is undoubtedly correct theoretically, coefficient shifts are un-\nlikely to be important for the small changes in policy analysed in this study. Furthermore,\nthere is some empirical evidence indicating that the Lucas Critique is not quantitatively\nimportant.4\nEquation (5) is based on the assumption that the supply of finance is infinitely elastic at the\nprevailing interest rate. However, recent research has challenged this view.5 Owing to fi-\n(forthcoming).\n5 The recent renaissance began with Fazzari, Hubbard, and Peterson (1988). See Chatelain (forthcoming),\nHubbard, and Petersen (2000) for a lively exchange concerning some unresolved issues in the finance\nconstraints literature.\nnancial market frictions, the cost of external finance exceeds the cost of internal finance,\nand investment spending is sensitive to the quantity of internal funds. In this case, the com-\nposition of finance affects real decisions. Moreover, these real decisions affect finance. For\nexample, the additional indebtedness for a new investment project may lower cash flow for\nseveral years due to interest expenses on the project debt and a higher external finance\npremium on future borrowings. With financial market frictions, real and financial decisions\nare intertwined.\nTo reflect short-term credit constraints, we follow the literature, and include the ratio of\ncash flow to the capital stock as an additional argument in (5). Finally, we assume that the\nerror term, i,t\n, contains three components: a firm-specific fixed effect (\n, which incorpo-\nrates i\n), a time-specific fixed effect (t\n), and a white noise error (i,t\n). With these addi-\ntional elements, we obtain the following autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) investment\nequation,\nIi,t\n= UC(L) uci,t\n+ S(L) si,t\n+ CF/K(L) (CFi,t\n+ I/K(L) (Ii,t-1\n) + i\n+ t\n+ i,t\n.\n1.3 The VIM Equation System\nOur model of a cost minimizing firm facing finance constraints has several implications for\nthe variables appearing on the right-side of (5) and the specification of the VIM. Since the\nprice and quantity variables are taken as given, uci,t\nand si,t\nare exogenous. By contrast,\nfinancing responds to investment, and (CFi,t\n) is an endogenous variable. Rather than\nmodelling the relations among these variables explicitly, we allow them to interact in a\nrelatively unrestricted manner by estimating the following Vectorautoregressive Investment\nModel (VIM),\n( )\n( )\n( )\n( ) \u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6\n+\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6\n\n\n+\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6\n\n\n+\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6\n\n\n+\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6\n=\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6\n-\n-\nK\nCF\nt\ni\nK\nI\nt\ni\nK\nCF\nt\nK\nI\nt\nK\nCF\ni\nK\nI\ni\nt\ni\nt\ni\nt\ni\nt\ni\nt\ni\nt\ni\nu\nu\ns\nuc\nL\nB\nK\nCF\nK\nI\nL\nA\nK\nCF\nK\nI\nA\n,\n,\n/\n/\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n)\n(\n)\n(\nYi,t\n= A(L) Yi,t-1\n+ B(L) Xi,t\n+ i\n+ t\n+ Ui,t\nE(Ui,t\n) = 0 and E(Ui,t\nUi,t') = i,t\n(diagonal) for all i=1,N and t=1,T, (6c)\n, A(L), and B(L) contain coefficients for the current endogenous (Yi,t\n), lagged en-\ndogenous (Yi,t-1\n), and the current and lagged exogenous variables (Xi,t\n), respectively.

Equation system (6) is a recursive system of dynamic simultaneous equations,\nand will be the basis for our coefficient estimates and the associated dynamic multipliers\nand impulse responses with which we assess the sensitivity of investment to monetary pol-\nicy and other stimuli.\n2. Estimating VIM\n2.1. Obtaining Coefficient Estimates\nThis sub-section discusses identification and estimation issues with equation system (6).\nTo identify the coefficients, we assume that the error covariance matrix, i,t, is diagonal\nand that the VIM has a recursive structure such that the matrix A0\nis upper triangular,\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6\n=\na\nWith (7), current cash flow affects current investment through the a coefficient but, owing\nto gestation and time-to-build lags, investment does not impact cash flow contemporane-\nously.\nThe coefficients are estimated by GMM. Following Arellano and Bond (1991) and Holtz-\nEakin, Newey, and Rosen (1988), we first-difference (6) to eliminate the firm-specific ef-\nfects and, for notational simplicity, exclude the time-specific fixed effects,\n= A(L) Yi,t-1\n+ B(L) Xi,t\n+ Ui,t\nDue to the resulting serial correlation in the error term (Ui,t\n), the system is estimated by\nGMM using the following instruments (whose number increases with t),\nZi,t\n= [X'i,t-2\n, ... X'i,1\n, ... Y'i,1\nand the GMM moment matrix, E[Gi,t\n()], where\nGi,t\n()  E[Zi,t\n- A(L) Yi,t-1\n- B(L) Xi,t\nE[.] is the expectation operator, and the coefficient vector  comprises the unknown ele-\nments in A0\n, A(L), and B(L) in (8). The empirical moments are stacked into the column\nvector gi\n() = vec[Gi,p+1\n... Gi,T\n], where p is the lag order for the polynomials A(L) and\nB(L). The GMM estimator minimizes the following criterion function,\n( ) ( ) ( )\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6\n\n\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6\n\n\n=\n\n=\n=\ni\nN\nl\ni\ni\nN\nl\ni\ng\nW\n'\ng\nwhere the weighting matrix, W, is given by\n( ) ( ) ,\n'\ng\ng\nE\ni\ni\nN\nl\ni\n-\n= \u00fa\n\u00fa\n\u00fb\n\u00f9\n\u00ea\n\u00ea\n\u00eb\n\u00e9\n\u00fa\n\u00fb\n\u00f9\n\u00ea\n\u00eb\n\u00e9\n\n\n\nis the true value of  that solves E[Gi,t\nOur VIM extends the panel data VAR model considered by Holtz-Eakin, Newey, and\nRosen (1988) to a dynamic system of simultaneous equations. In an ordinary VAR system,\nthe coefficients can be estimated efficiently with equation-by-equation least-squares. By\ncontrast, Holtz-Eakin, Newey, and Rosen showed that an efficient GMM estimator for a\npanel data VAR system must be estimated as a system. However, for the recursive structure\nemployed here, an equation-by-equation GMM procedure is asymptotically as efficient as\nthe system estimator. The reason is that under the assumption that the errors are uncorre-\nlated across equations, the weight matrix W is diagonal and, therefore, the equation-by-\nequation GMM procedure is identical to the system GMM estimator. In finite samples the\nestimated weighting matrix is not diagonal, in general, and a difference usually exists be-\ntween the equation-by-equation and system GMM estimators that disappears as N tends to\n2.2 Selecting The Lag Length\nWe employ two specification tests to select the lag length. With the First-Difference esti-\nmator, white noise errors imply that the residuals between periods t and t-2 will be uncor-\nrelated. The Lagrangian Multiplier statistic (LM) proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991)\ntests for second-order residual serial correlation. A second specification test examines the\nvalidity of the overidentifying restrictions with the SH statistic proposed by Sargan (1958)\nand Hansen (1982). If the model is correctly specified, the residuals between periods t and\nt-2 will be uncorrelated, and the overidentifying restrictions will be sustained.\nSince our primary focus is on investment spending, we focus on the properties of this\nequation for lag lengths of 2, 3, and 4 periods. The LM statistics have p-values of 0.008,\nacceptable. For the same three models, the p-values for the SH statistic are 0.002, 0.075,\nand 0.009, respectively. Thus, only the investment model with three lags passes both speci-\nfication tests, and all of the estimates reported in the tables are based on systems of equa-\ntions with three lags.6\n2.3 Computing Dynamic Multipliers, Impulse Responses, And Error Bands\nThe coefficient estimates from VAR models are difficult to interpret, but they provide use-\nful information for computing dynamic multipliers for changesin the exogenous variables\nor impulse responses for shocks to the endogenous variables.\nTo compute dynamic multipliers, the final form of the system has to be determined.

The error bands for the impulse responses are computed in a similar manner\nto those for the dynamic multipliers.\n3. Datasets\n3.1. Financial Statements (UBS)\nThe Bundesbank's financial statement database (Unternehmensbilanzstatistik, UBS) con-\nstitutes the largest source of accounting data for nonfinancial firms in Germany.8 These\ndata were collected by the Bundesbank in performing its rediscounting and lending opera-\ntions. Bills of exchange issued by nonfinancial firms were frequently presented to the Bun-\ndesbank by credit institutions (cf. fn. 3). When a bill was presented for discounting, the\ncreditworthiness of the issuing firm and all other firms that have held this bill needed to be\ndetermined. In the case of default, liability for payment of the bill fell on any firm that had\nheld the bill. By law, the Bundesbank could only accept bills backed by three parties\nknown to be creditworthy.\nAbout 70,000 annual accounts were collected per year on a strictly confidential basis by the\nBundesbank's branch offices. These data were initially subjected to a computer check for\nlogical errors and missing data. Approximately 15,000 accounts had to be excluded be-\ncause they were incomplete, represented consolidated accounts, or were for firms in sectors\n(e.g., agriculture) for which no meaningful results could be generated owing to the small\namount of available data. Additional checks and corrections for errors were undertaken in\nthe Statistical Department at the Bundesbank's Central Office in Frankfurt before finalizing\nthe UBS database.\nThe dataset used in estimation is smaller for several reasons. We use data only for firms lo-\ncated in the manufacturing sector of West Germany to avoid any issues of comparability\nbetween the western and eastern sections of the country. Sole proprietorships and private\npartnerships are excluded because their tax treatment depends on personal characteristics\nthat are very difficult to quantify. State dominated corporations are also excluded. The da-\ntaset is further reduced by first-differencing, missing values, data cleaning, variable con-\n8 This discussion draws on the Deutsche Bundesbank (1998) and St\u00f6\u00df (2001), which contain more\ndetailed descriptions of the UBS data.\nthus have available for our preferred econometric specification containing three lags (dis-\n42% of the total turnover of the West German manufacturing sector and 61% of the total\nturnover of incorporated firms in all German manufacturing.\nThe user cost of capital (UC) is the variable through which monetary policy through inter-\nest rates affects investment spending. In very simple terms, the user cost is comprised of\nthree components,\nUC = R * P * T, (14)\nwhere R, P, and T represent rental, price, and tax terms, respectively. The rental term con-\ntains two components, the opportunity cost of funds measured by the real long-term interest\nrate (r = i - , the nominal discount rate (i) less the expected rate of inflation () in the price\nof investment goods) and the economic rate of depreciation (). The P term is the price of\ninvestment goods relative to the price of output. Two key taxes entering T are the rate of\nincome taxation (reflecting both federal and L\u00e4nder rates, as well as the \"solidarity sur-\ncharge\") and the present value of the stream of current and future tax depreciation deduc-\ntions. The user cost variable used in this study is much more complicated than presented in\nthis sub-section, and important details are discussed in Appendix A.\nTable 1 contains summary statistics for the variables that enter VIM defined by equation\nsystem (6).\n3.3. Creditworthiness Ratio (CWR)\nA unique element in this study is the set of creditworthiness ratios (Gesamtkennzahl,\nCWR's) generated by the Bundesbank when it performed its rediscounting and lending op-\n9 We control for outliers by discarding the upper and lower 1% tails of st\n, (CFi,t\n), and the\ncreditworthiness ratio (introduced in Section 3.3) and the upper 2% tail of (Ii,t\n). See Appendix B\nfor further details about the financial statement data.\n10 The beginning year of 1988 is chosen because the definitions of many important financial statement\nvariables were changed in 1986 by the directive harmonizing financial statements in the European\nUnion. For many firms, the changes were not instituted in 1987, and the amount of data available in the\nUBS is unacceptably low in that year.\nerations. The CWR's are determined by a discriminant analysis.11 The two underlying\npopulations are solvent and insolvent firms, where insolvency is indicated by a legal appli-\ncation for bankruptcy. The sample is constructed by first identifying the relatively scarce\ninsolvent firms, and then adding a solvent firm from the same sector. To enhance the sta-\ntistical properties of the discriminant function, the sample contains an equal number of sol-\nvent and insolvent firms. The following information is used to compute the discriminant\nfunction: 1) equity/pension provision ratio (adjusted equity capital and pension provisions\nas a percentage of total capital employed); 2) return on total capital employed (profit before\nincome taxes and before interest payments as a percentage of total capital employed); 3)\nreturn on equity (profit before income taxes as a percentage of adjusted equity income); 4)\ncapital recovery rate (net receipts as a percentage of capital invested); 5) net interest pay-\nment ratio (net interest as a percentage of turnover); 6) accounting practice (which affects\navailable valuation methods). The weights assigned to these categories are confidential.\nThese ratios are examined by the Bundesbank's Department of Credit, Foreign Exchange,\nand Financial Markets for outliers.\nThe discriminant analysis determines two critical values of the CWR that classifies firms\ninto one of three categories: high degree of creditworthiness (Good), low degree of credit-\nworthiness (Endangered), or Indeterminate. The proportion of distressed firms in the data\nused in the discriminant analysis appears representative, and compares favourably to the\npercentage of failed firms in the overall economy (Deutsche Bundesbank, 1998; St\u00f6\u00df,\n4. Simulating VIM - Full Sample\nThis section reports simulations of VIM to changes in the exogenous user cost and sales\nvariables and shocks to the endogenous cash flow and investment variables. As discussed\nin Section 2, all coefficients are estimated by GMM with the equations first-differenced to\neliminate firm fixed effects. Coefficient estimates and error bands are presented in Appen-\ndices C and E, respectively.\n4.1. User Cost Change\nMonetary policy affects investment spending through the interest rate embedded in the user\ncost of capital. This variable enters the investment equation, and represents the interest rate\n11 See Deutsche Bundesbank (1999) for further details about the construction of the CWR's and the credit\nevaluation process.\nchannel of monetary policy. In VIM, the user cost also enters the cash flow equation. In\nturn, cash flow affects investment and vice versa. These real/financial interactions are at\nthe core of the credit channel of monetary policy, and are also captured by VIM.\nTable 2a and Figure 1a display the dynamic multipliers for investment and cash flow fol-\nlowing from a one unit change in the user cost growth rate.12 As shown in columns 1 and\n4, the responses of both investment and cash flow is substantial in the first two years and,\nbased on the error bands, these multipliers are statistically different from zero. The time\nprofile of responses differ. For investment, 92% of the cumulative response takes place in\nthe first two years. By contrast, only 67% of the reduction in cash flow occurs during the\nsame period.\nRelative to single equation evaluations of monetary policy, VIM matters. Columns 2 and 5\ncontain comparable dynamic multipliers for the ADL investment equation (5) and an\nanalogously specified cash flow equation. The percentage differences between these single\nequation multipliers and VIM are presented in columns 3 and 6. The cumulative difference\nfor investment is 33.7%. Thus, endogenizing financial decisions and recognizing the feed-\nbacks between investment and cash flow has a substantial impact on the monetary policy\ntransmission channel. For business investment, these feedbacks are one-third as large as the\ninterest rate channel.\nTo understand the economic significance of monetary policy, we adjust the entries in Table\n2a to correspond to the percentage change in investment with respect to a 25 basis point in-\ncrease in the short-term interest rate. Specifically, the entries in columns 1, 2, 4, and 5 are\nmultiplied by 0.07.13 During the first two years after this monetary intervention, invest-\n12 In this experiment, the monetary authorities raise the real rate for an indefinite period. Although this is\nnot a realistic assumption, it allows us to avoid the complications associated with specifying an\nadjustment path for capital goods prices that returns the real interest rate to its long-run level. Moreover,\nthis assumption has no practical significance for our analysis of investment because the bulk of the\nresponse to various stimuli occurs in the first two years.\n13 The adjustment proceeds in two steps. First, the entries is Table 2a represent I/K, and are transformed\ninto the percentage change in investment by the following relation: (I/I) = (I/K) / (I/K), where (I/K) is\nincrease in user cost, and need to be adjusted to the percentage change in the user cost, UC/UC,\ncorresponding to a 25 basis point change. Consider an expanded version of the user cost equation (14),\nUC = ((1-) i[m]-+) * P * T, where  is the corporate tax rate (see equation (A-3) for further details),\ni[m] is the nominal long-term interest rate that depends on the monetary policy variable (m),  is the\nexpected rate of inflation in the price of investment goods,  is the economic rate of depreciation, and P\nand T represent price and tax terms, respectively. Differentiating with respect to m, we obtain UC/UC\n= (i/m) m (1-) / ((1-) i[m]-+), where (i/m) reflects the impact of the short-term rate\ncontrolled by the monetary authorities on the long-term rate entering the user cost and m is the basis\npoint change in the short-term rate. We assume that (i/m) = 1, the net-of-tax real long-term rate is\nment falls by a substantial 3.1%. However, it is important to realize that this assessment\ndepends critically on the expectation assumptions reflected in the term structure of interest\nrates.\nFor the purpose of exposition, we assume that the long term rate changes by the same\namount as the short term rate. Depending on how expectations are formed, the sensitivity\nof the long term rate might be smaller or perhaps even be larger. While our results indicate\na statistically significant monetary policy channel that is enhanced by endogenous financ-\ning, its economic significance is sensitive to auxiliary assumptions outside the scope of the\npresent study.\nSimulations of a one unit increase in sales growth are presented in Table 2b and Figure 1b.\nSimilar to the results with the user cost, dynamic multipliers based on VIM are approxi-\nmately 30% larger than those computed from the ADL investment equation in isolation.\nThe multipliers are statistically different from zero at the 5% level for all 10 simulation pe-\nriods.\nTo understand the economic significance of these multipliers and the role of demand shifts,\nassume that exogenous sales rises for all firms by 1.0%14 In this case, the entries in Table\n2b are multiplied by 0.01, and investment rises by 1.9% during the first two years and 3.0%\nin the long-run (10 years).15 The well-known investment accelerator is alive and well and,\nin VIM, enhanced by interactions with financial decisions.\n4.3. Cash Flow Shock\nThe remaining two sets of simulations assess shocks to the equations comprising the\neconometric system (6). Table 3a and Figure 2a contain impulse responses for a unit shock\nto cash flow. Relative to single equation calculations, the sensitivity of investment to a cash\nflow shock is 66% larger when the investment and cash flow equations interact. This dif-\n(Note that this formulation does not allow the present value of depreciation allowances (\"A\" in\nAppendix A) to vary with the interest rate due to computational considerations and a desire to separate\n14 This perturbation equals a one standard deviation movement in (filtered) GDP for the period 1970-1998.\nThe standard deviation is computed using a band-pass filter, and equals 1.06 (Agresti and Mojon, 2001,\n15 This change is computed as follows: (I/I) = (I/K) 0.01 / (I/K), where (I/K) is taken from Table 2b,\ncolumn 1 and (I/K) is the mean value of 0.1813 taken from Table 1, column 1. For the first two\nference is twice as large as the comparable figures for the user cost and sales multipliers\ndiscussed above.\nAs is standard in VAR analyses, we evaluate the response of investment to a one standard\ndeviation shock, which equals the residual standard error in the cash flow equation. In this\ncase, the entries in Table 3a are multiplied by 0.04, and investment rises by 3.9% in the\nlong-run in response to this cash flow shock.\n4.4. Investment Shock\nTable 3b and Figure 2b report the impulse responses associated with a unit shock to in-\nvestment. Apart from the initial shock, the long-run effect on investment and the cumula-\ntive difference between the VIM and ADL multipliers are small.\n5. Simulating VIM - Sample Sorted By Creditworthiness\nMuch recent research in macroeconomics has emphasized the importance of firm heteroge-\nneity and the differential impacts of monetary policy on firms facing varying degrees of dif-\nficulty obtaining external finance. While the finance constraints literature has been charac-\nterized by sharp differences of opinion (see fn. 5), there is rather broad agreement that\nvariations in firm creditworthiness and the resulting wedge between internal and external\nfinance are the key elements in models of finance constraints.16\nThe Bundesbank data on firm creditworthiness allows us to examine the impact of this type\nof heterogeneity. Firms are classified by a direct measure of the external finance premium,\nCWR. There are three categories of creditworthiness - Endangered, Good, and Indetermi-\nnate - depending on the state in the year before the investment/capital ratio first enters the\nregression model as a dependent variable. Our large sample permits us to discard the mid-\ndle group in order to sharpen the evaluation.\nDynamic multipliers and impulse responses for the Endangered and Good classes of firms\nare presented in Figure 3 (coefficient estimates are in Appendix D). A change in monetary\npolicy (and the associated change in the user cost) has almost no impact on investment by\nEndangered firms in the first year and a relatively small effect in the second year. The sen-\nsitivity of investment to this monetary impulse is much larger for the Good firms. An even\nmore extreme pattern emerges with respect to a change in sales. Firms with poor credit\nratings do not react to changing economic conditions. This \"paralysis\" might be traceable\nto their inability to finance investment. On the other hand and consistent with binding fi-\nnancing constraints, investment is much more responsive for Endangered firms than for\nGood firms (bottom panel of Figure 3). The CWR split sample results offer striking con-\nfirmation of the importance of firm heterogeneity and finance constraints for understanding\nthe differential effects of monetary policy.\n6. Summary And Conclusions\nThis paper presents a new approach to modelling business investment spending and mone-\ntary policy transmission. Ambiguities concerning the modelling of investment dynamics\nand interactions between real and financial decisions suggest a VAR methodology for\ndrawing relations among investment and its determinants. We specify a Vector Autoregres-\nsive Investment model (VIM) containing investment, user cost, sales, and cash flow vari-\nables. Estimates are based on a large panel dataset containing 44,345 datapoints for 6,408\nGerman firms supplemented with data for the user cost of capital and firm credit ratings.\nWe obtain three key results. First, monetary policy matters. The effects of a monetary con-\ntraction are statistically significant and very rapid, with 92% of the cumulative response\noccurring in the first two years. Over this period, a 25 basis point increase in the short-term\ninterest rate lowers investment by 3.1%, though this computation of economic significance\nis sensitive to auxiliary assumptions outside the scope of this study.\nSecond, VIM matters. Relative to simulations of a single equation based on exogenous fi-\nnancing, the sensitivity of investment to monetary policy is larger by one-third and to cash\nflow shocks by two-thirds in VIM. Endogenizing financial decisions and recognizing feed-\nbacks between investment and cash flow has a substantial impact on the monetary policy\ntransmission channel.\nThird, financial status matters. Firms with a poor credit rating are \"paralysed\" in being un-\nable to respond to changes in the user cost and sales. However, they are more responsive to\ncash flow shocks than firms with a good credit rating.\nThese initial results indicate that VIM is a feasible approach for analysing firm-level panel\ndata, and can shed new insights into firm behaviour and monetary policy transmission.\nReferences\nAbel, Andrew B., and EJanice E.

Due to data limitations, however, we\nhave to confine ourselves to the mean Gewerbesteuer rate for the whole sample.\n( )\nt\nI\nt\nj\nI\nt\nj\nI\nt\nj\nt\nI\nt\nj\nj\nt\nI\nt\nj\nI\nP\nP\nP\nK\nP\nK\nP ,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6\n\n-\n=\n-\n-\n-\nwhere I\nt\nj\nP ,\nis a sector specific price of investment goods,\nt\nI is real investment and\nj\n the\nsector-specific depreciation rate.\nReal Sales (S): Sales, deflated by a sector-specific index for output prices.\nUser Costs of Capital (UC): see Section 3.2 and Appendix A.\nCash Flow (CF): Net income plus depreciation, deflated by a sector-specific index for out-\nput prices.\nCreditworthiness Ratio (CWR): A discriminant analysis procedure separates firms with\nhigh a priori risk of default from those with a low risk, also see Section 3.3. Firms are\nplaced in one of three categories of creditworthiness: \"good credit standing\", \"indifferent\ncredit standing\" and \"endangered credit standing\". Individual ratios for calculating dis-\ncriminant functions in the manufacturing sector include:\n\u00b7 equity/pension-provision ratio (adjusted equity capital and pension provisions as a per-\ncentage of adjusted balance-sheet total);\n\u00b7 return on total capital employed (Profit/loss before taxes on income and before interest\npayments as a percentage of adjusted balance-sheet total;\n\u00b7 return on equity (Profit/loss before taxes on income as percentage of adjusted equity);\n\u00b7 capital recovery rate (Net receipts/net expenditures as percentage of capital invested);\n\u00b7 net interest payment ratio (Net interest result as percentage of turnover/total output);\n\u00b7 accounting practice.\nHere, balance sheet total and equity are adjusted by subtracting items like subscribed capi-\ntal unpaid, goodwill, credits to proprietors and partners, formation expenses. \"Net receipts\"\nis an elaborate measure for cash flow, not equal to the simpler one used in estimation. It is\nprofit plus depreciation, augmented by changes of items like provisions for taxes, other\nshort term provisions, pension provisions and other long term provisions, payments re-\nceived on account of orders, less items like increases of stocks of finished goods. Capital\ninvested is adjusted balance sheet total less liquid financial assets.\nThe creditworthiness ratio (CWR) takes on values between -99.9 and 99.9. It is a weighted\nsum of the individual ratios. The weights are determined by the discriminant analysis pro-\ncedure, as well as the cut-off points (cl\n, cu\n) for a grouping of creditworthiness:\nendangered credit standing\ncl <\nCWR < cu\nindifferent credit standing\ncu <\nCWR < 99.9 good credit standing\nOutlier control\nObservations with missing values for sales, capital, investment, cash flow or the overall\nrating ratio were excluded. The presence of CWR serves as a check that the EU harmoni-\nzation guidelines were being followed. The data set is trimmed by discarding the upper and\nlower 1% tails of st\n, (CFi,t\n), and CWR and the upper 2% tail of (Ii,t\n).\nAppendix C: GMM Coefficient Estimates of Equation System (6)\nFull Sample\nExplanatory\nVariable\nInvestment Equation\nDependent Variable: Ii,t\nCash Flow Equation\nDependent Variable: CFi,t\n\n\n\nuci,t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsi,t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCFi,t\nNotes to Appendix C:\nSee the note to Table 1 for variable definitions.** and * indicate statistical significance at\nthe 1% and 5% levels, respectively.
