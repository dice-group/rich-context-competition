A previous laboratory study that investigated the\neffects of local norms on charitable donations by using watching eye images and manipulating money visible in a collection box\nfound that the presence of eye images significantly increased overall donations; however, the images did not make people more\nlikely to conform to the apparent local norm. Here, we report the results of a field study examining the effects of watching eyes\nand the amount of money in transparent collection boxes on charitable giving in an izakaya (a Japanese-style tavern) setting.\nContrary to the previous study, we found that the amount donated increased more under the large- than the small-norm\ntreatment. The presence of eye images increased the overall amount donated but was more salient under the small-norm\ntreatment. We found that participants were more likely to increase the amount of money in the box than to conform to the\nlocal norm of a small donation when the eye images were present. The results of this study suggest that an appropriate com-\nbination of eye images and normative information can alter people's behavior without changing their economic incentives.\n",

Alternatively, altru-\nism is a social norm, and humans tend to conform to social\nnorms and to sanction departures from these norms (Chudek &\nHenrich, 2011). Thus, eye images may promote conformity by\nincreasing awareness of the presence of others.\nThe findings of several previous studies support the\nreputation-based partner choice model. In a field study that\ninvolved manipulating the amount of litter, Bateson, Callow,\nHolmes, Redmond Roche, and Nettle (2013) found that images\nof watching eyes posted on nearby bicycle racks did not facil-\nitate norm compliance. Fathi, Bateson, and Nettle (2014) con-\nducted an experimental study in which participants were\ninvited to donate money earned in a previous task to a charity\nand observed the amount donated under conditions of large and\nsmall amounts of money already present in the transparent\ndonation jars in the presence and absence of watching eyes\nimages on the walls. The authors found that the local norm did\nnot affect overall donations and that, although the presence of\neye images significantly increased overall donations, watching\neyes did not make people more likely to conform to the appar-\nent local norm. Oda, Niwa, Honma, and Hiraishi (2011) inves-\ntigated this issue through the participants' interpretations of the\nsituation. They conducted the dictator game in the presence and\nabsence of a painting of stylized eyes. The participants were\nasked to complete a postexperimental questionnaire designed\nto determine what they were thinking when they decided on the\namount of money to offer the recipient and how they perceived\nthe experimental situation. The results suggested that the\nwatching eyes effect was mediated by the expectation of a\nreward rather than by the fear of punishment. The results of\nthese studies appear to support the reputation-based partner\nchoice model. Nevertheless, support also exists for the norm-\ncompliance model. Oda, Kato, and Hiraishi (2015) compared\nthe tendency to tell a ``prosocial lie'' in the presence and\nabsence of stylized eyes. Contrary to previous studies, they\nfound that prosocial behavior and norm compliance contra-\ndicted each other. Participants tended to tell lies that benefited\nothers when eye images were not present, whereas the tendency\ntoward prosocial lying disappeared in the presence of the sty-\nlized eyes, suggesting that the desire to avoid violating norms\nby being honest was stronger than the desire to pursue a good\nreputation by demonstrating generosity. Further studies of the\nwatching eyes effect in various settings are needed to settle this\nissue. Moreover, several studies have found no effect of eye\nimages on behavior (e.g., Fehr & Schneider, 2010; Raihani &\nmoto, & Ohtsubo, 2015). Thus, replication studies are needed\nto investigate the robustness of the watching eyes effect.\nHere, we report the results of a field study examining the\neffects of watching eyes and the amount of money in transpar-\nent collection boxes on charitable giving in an izakaya (a\nJapanese-style tavern) setting. Our aim was to replicate the\nfindings of Fathi et al. (2014) with high ecological validity.\nBased on the findings of Ekstro\nof watching eyes would increase charitable donations,\nwhereas the prosocial norm would not affect the amount\ndonated.\nMaterials and Method\nStudy Location\nThe study was conducted in an izakaya, a Japanese-style\ntavern, located near a terminal station in Nagoya, Japan. The\nizakaya contained 12 low tables, each of which sat 4 people, 3\nlow tables that sat 6, and a counter for 17 people.\nMaterials\nWe used three ready-made transparent collection boxes with a\nFigure 1). Cardholders were mounted on the front and back of\nthe boxes. We inserted a blue card (100 \u00c2 65 mm, W \u00c2 H) on\nthe front of the box indicating that the donation would be sent\nto the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\n(UNHCR) to aid refugees. On the back, we inserted a white\nof the refugee crisis and the watching eyes stimulus image\n(50 \u00c2 30 mm, W \u00c2 H) in the upper portion. The eyes treatment\nstimulus employed the same stylized eyes image as used by\nHaley and Fessler (2005). The control treatment stimulus was a\nreconstructed version of the same image, in which the eyes\nwere not identifiable (Figure 1). Under the small-norm treat-\n(JPY). Under the large-norm treatment, the box contained 149\nbanknote amounting to a total value of 15,930 JPY (Table 1).\nFigure 1. (a) The collection box of small-norm treatment with con-\ntrol stimulus. (b) The collection box of large-norm treatment with\neyes stimulus.\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nProcedure\nThe collection boxes were placed in three locations around the\nizakaya: on the checkout counter, near the entrance to a room\nwith 11 low tables, and on a low table in a private dining room\nfor six. The boxes were left in place for 84 days between\ncombinations of the eyes/control and small-/large-norm treat-\nments was randomly allocated to each day during the study\nperiod; thus, each combination was tested for a total of 21 days.\ncollection boxes were emptied by an author or an izakaya staff\nmember each day during the experimental period after the\nizakaya closed, and the amount donated was counted. The staff\nprovided the number of patrons and groups who visited the\nizakaya on each experimental day.\nData Analysis\nThe R statistical software package (R Core Development\nTeam, 2011) was used to conduct the statistical tests. The dis-\ntribution was highly skewed to the right because most individ-\nuals donated a small amount of money, and large donations\nwere rare; thus, the dependent variable was modeled using the\nPoisson distribution. A general linear model was used to ana-\nlyze the effects of the predictor variables of eyes, norm, and\ntheir interaction on the dependent variable (amount donated).\nResults\nDonations by Treatment\nDonations were made on 74 of the 84 experimental days. Of the\n10 days during which no money was donated, 7 were small-\nnorm/no-eyes condition days, and each of the other conditions\nwas represented on 1 no donation day, that is, 1 day was the\nsmall-norm/with-eyes condition, 1 was the large-norm/no-eyes,\nand 1 was the large-norm/with-eyes condition. The difference\ntotal amount donated was 10,174 JPY, and the median amount\npatrons visited the izakaya during the experiment, and the\nA Poisson regression model was fitted using the number of\npatrons who visited the izakaya each day as an offset term\n(Akaike information criterion [AIC] \u00bc 4,866.2) because it was\ncorrelated with the amount donated (Kendall t \u00bc .61, z \u00bc 8.07,\np < .001). The main effects of watching eyes and norm were\ninteraction between eyes and norm was not significant\nwas donated under the large-norm than under the small-norm\ntreatment. Furthermore, the presence of watching eyes\nincreased the overall amount donated.\nThe largest donation in a day was 530 JPY, which was made\nunder the large-norm/no-eyes condition. We considered this\ndonation an outlier and excluded it from the following analyses\nbecause the amount was 1.5 times the interquartile range (202.1\npatrons visited the izakaya during the remaining 83 experimen-\ntal days, and the median number of patrons per day was 93\nTable 2 shows the amount donated and number of patrons\naccording to condition.\nA Poisson regression model was fitted using the number of\npatrons who visited the izakaya each day as an offset term (AIC\n\u00bc 4,027.4) because it was correlated with the amount donated\nwatching eyes and norm were significant (eyes: B \u00bc .132,\nwas donated under the large-norm than under the small-norm\ntreatment. Furthermore, the presence of watching eyes\nincreased the overall amount donated; however, the effect of\nthe eye images was more salient under the small-norm than\nunder the large-norm treatment (Figure 2).\nWe quantified the frequency of coin denominations donated\nunder each condition to determine the effects of watching eyes,\nnorm, and the norm/eyes interaction on individual donations\n(Table 2). We found no significant difference in coin denomi-\nChanges in Donations by Treatment\nTo estimate the effects of patrons' consciousness of the reci-\npients and their habituation to the experimental treatments, we\nplotted the amount donated per patron each day (Figure 3). The\namount donated in the small-norm/no-eyes condition tended to\ndecrease as the days passed (Figure 3a; Kendall t \u00bc \u00c0.43,\nz \u00bc \u00c02.62, p \u00bc .008). However, no significant decrease in the\namount donated was detected under the other three conditions\nDiscussion\nWe found that both the prosocial norm and watching eyes\naffected charitable donations and that the effect of the norm\nwas stronger than that of watching eyes. No decrease in the\namount donated was detected as a function of days elapsed\nunder the large-norm or with-eyes treatments. Although we\nhave no data on the regularity of the patrons, the results suggest\nTable 1. Number of Coins and Banknotes Contained in Boxes of\nSmall- and Large-Norm Treatments.\nDenomination (JPY)\nNote. JPY \u00bc Japanese yen.\nOda and Ichihashi 3\nthat few patrons visited the izakaya on a regular basis and that\nno patron, even among the few regulars, habituated to the sti-\nmulus. However, the amount donated decreased as a function\nof days elapsed under the small-norm/no-eyes treatment. This\ncould reflect trends in the news coverage of the refugee crisis.\nAccording to Google Trends, the search volume index for the\nword ``nanmin'' (``refugee'' in Japanese) was at its peak (100)\n2015, when we started the experiments. The index values in\n17, respectively. That is, consciousness of the refugee crisis\ntended to decrease in Japan during the study period. The transi-\ntion analysis suggested that the decrease in donations later in\nthe period was probably caused by the lack of concern about\nthe refugee crisis, which was prevented by the large-norm or\neye-stimulus treatments and led to differences in total dona-\ntions among conditions.\nOur finding that the presence of eye images increased the\noverall amount donated supports those of Ekstro\neffect was more salient under the small-donation treatment\nafter excluding an outlier. The interaction between the eyes\nand norm treatments was not significant when we included a\nday in which an extreme donation was made, which raises\nquestions on the robustness of the interaction effect. However,\nsimilar to Nettle et al. (2013), we found that the watching eyes\neffect appeared to be driven by a change in the probability of\ngiving anything at all (7 days with no donations under the\ncontrol treatment vs. 1 day under the eyes treatment) under the\nsmall-norm treatment, whereas no such tendency was observed\nunder the large-norm treatment (1 day with no donations under\neach eye treatment). In any case, the eye image did not boost\nconformity to local norms, which supports the reputation-based\npartner choice model.\nContrary to the findings of Fathi et al. (2014), the partici-\npants in our study donated more money under the large-norm\nthan under the small-norm treatment, which supports the find-\nreported that the median donation under the large-norm/no-\neyes treatment was zero and suggested that this was caused\nby a relative excess of zero donations, suggesting that the norm\ncues provided an indication of an acceptable minimum level of\nprosociality. However, no donations were seen during only\n2 days under the large-norm treatment of our experiments.\nSeveral differences between these studies may account for the\ndisparity. First, the study settings differed: Ours was conducted\nin the field, whereas that of Fathi et al. was a laboratory study.\nSecond, differences in the manipulation of money in the col-\nlection boxes may have significantly affected local norms; for\ninstance, the norm cues in our experiment may have been\nstronger than those used by Fathi et al. In the Fathi et al. study,\nthe amount of money in the large-norm jar was about twice as\nmuch as that in the small-norm jar, whereas in our study, the\nlarge-norm collection box contained approximately 4 times\nmore money than the small-norm box. Moreover, our large-\nnorm boxes contained banknotes. Third, cultural differences\nmay have contributed to the disparity between studies.\nFathi et al. recruited participants from a volunteer database\nheld by a university in England, whereas our subjects were\npatrons of a Japanese izakaya. Japanese individuals are\nmore likely than Westerners to conform to norms. Studies of the\nculturally construed self suggest that the East Asian cultures\nadhere to the fundamental relatedness of individuals to one\nanother (interdependent self), whereas European and American\nindividuals seek to maintain their independence from others\n(independent self; e.g., Markus & Kitayama, 1991).\nFurthermore, the money to be donated was provided by the\nexperimenter as payment for the completion of a task in the\nFathi et al. (2014) study, whereas our subjects were required to\nTable 2.

Participants in the Fathi et al. study\nwere told that their donations went to a local organization that\nprovided air ambulance services in the North of England,\nwhich could be classified as an ``in-group.'' Conversely, our\nparticipants were told that the donations were for refugees,\nwhich could be classified as an ``out-group.'' Furthermore, the\nwatching eyes stimulus used by Fathi et al. was an image of\nmale eyes, whereas our stimulus image was Horus eyes.\nFinally, alcohol intoxication may have affected behavior in\nour study because most of the patrons consumed alcoholic\nbeverages during the evening. Any one of these factors alone\nor interactions among them may account for the differences\nobserved between our findings and those of Fathi et al. Fur-\nther studies that control for each confounding factor are\nneeded for clarification.\nAlthough the proportions of \u00a550 and \u00a5100 coins were larger\nunder the large-norm treatment than under the small-norm treat-\nment, no significant difference in the type of coin denominations\nwas observed among the conditions. Moreover, the total number\nof coins was larger under the large-norm treatment than under\nthe small-norm treatment. These results suggest that the larger\namount of money donated under the large-norm treatment was\nnot due to large individual donations. It is likely that differences\nin the amount donated among the four conditions resulted from\ndifferences in the total number of coins donated. This finding\nsuggests that the large amount of money in the large-norm box\nserved to draw more attention to the written information about\nUNHCR activities than did the small amount of money. Indeed,\nwe included a banknote in the large-norm box, which is unusual\nin charity boxes. Similarly, it may be that the presence of eye\nimages drew attention to the collection box, as Ernest-Jones et al.\n(2011) suggested. Alternatively, it is possible that although the\nfrequency of coin throwing did not differ between the large- and\nsmall-norm treatments, people who saw a large amount of\nmoney in the boxes donated more coins at a time to conform\nto the norm, leading to the same result. The use of a video\ncamera to confirm the number of donations made under each\ncondition, similar to that used by Martin and Randall (2008),\nwould help clarify this issue.\nIn conclusion, both an eye image and normative information\nfacilitated prosociality, and there may be some interaction\nbetween these factors. The results of this study suggest that\nan appropriate combination of eye images and normative infor-\nmation can alter people's behavior without changing their eco-\nnomic incentives.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work\n(a) (c)\n(b) (d)\nAmount donated per patron (JPY)\nDays\nAmount donated per patron (JPY)\nDays\nDays\nAmount donated per patron (JPY)\nDays\nAmount donated per patron (JPY)\nFigure 3.
