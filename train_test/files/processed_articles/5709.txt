Asking and observing how 56 users actually browse news and what clicking and\nnot clicking mean to them, we identified 30 distinct considerations for (not) clicking\nand classified them into three categories: cognitive, affective and pragmatic. The results\nsuggest, first, that interest is too crude a term to account for the variety of people's\nconsiderations for (not) clicking. Second, even if one aims for roughly estimating\npeople's news interests, clicks are a flawed instrument because a lack of clicking does\nnot measure people's lack of interest in news. Third, taking users' browsing patterns\nseriously could help bridge the gap between what people need as citizens and what they\nactually consume. Finally, we argue that all metrics should be critically assessed from a\nuser perspective rather than taken at face value.\n",

Web metrics are not only monitored by individual\njournalists but also displayed on big screens in newsrooms and forwarded to staff by\neditors-in-chief.\nScholars and news professionals have tended to take metrics at face value by assum-\ning a close correspondence between clicks and audience interests. Since `most viewed\nlists' are often dominated by news about entertainment, crime and sports, it is assumed\nthat news users are more interested in `junk' than in `public affairs' news (politics, eco-\nnomics, international relationships) (e.g. Tenenboim and Cohen, 2015; Tewksbury,\n2003). Boczkowski and Mitchelstein (2013) speak of a `news gap' between the prefer-\nences of journalists and news users. This article problematizes the relationship between\nclicks and audience interests. Rather than looking at metrics, we observed how news\nusers in everyday circumstances browse news and asked them what moves them to click\nor not to click. The aim of this research is to explore what (not) clicking means to people\nand to what extent clicks reflect their news interests.\nProfessional autonomy versus pleasing the masses\nMonitoring audiences is hardly new. Schlesinger (1978: 111) describes how the BBC News\nhad a large wallchart tracking how its Nine O'Clock News was doing in the ratings. However,\nmonitoring was done mostly to track how they were doing relative to their competition.\nOther than today, the audience in itself was not an important consideration for journalists\nneed for knowledge about their audience, as one producer illustrates: `I know we have\ntwenty million viewers, but I don't know who they are. I don't know what the audience\nwants, and I don't care' (Gans, 1979: 234). Indeed, journalists actively resisted audience\nfeedback. In the early 2000s, public TV journalists interpreted any discussion of audiences\nas potentially compromising journalistic autonomy (Costera Meijer, 2003). Journalists also\nfeared that taking audience preferences into consideration equalled lowering journalistic\nstandards (Costera Meijer, 2013; Gans, 1979). This binary opposition between professional\nautonomy and pleasing the masses, between making quality journalism while users appar-\nently prefer trivial news, is deeply ingrained in the journalism profession.\nThe impact of clicks\nDespite the autonomy-popularity binary, today, journalistic considerations have become\naudience-centric. Research shows how by and large, news organizations are having met-\nrics inform their editorial decisions, from news presentation (news placement, headline\nadjustment) to news production (expanding or following up heavily clicked stories)\nence clicks affect both news placement (Lee et al., 2014) and subsequent reporting\n(Welbers et al., 2015). Tandoc (2014) illustrates how editors select and de-select news\nitems based on the web traffic they generate.\nNews organizations aiming for popularity monitor clicks most closely, whereas those\nwhose brand identity hinges on quality emphasize the importance of their professional\njudgment (Welbers et al., 2015). Yet, Tandoc (2014) found no evidence of journalists\nweighing editorial autonomy and accommodating audiences while observing their eve-\nryday practices. Christin (2014) illustrates an ambivalence towards clicks: even journal-\nists critical towards click-chasing do `understand online success as a signal of professional\nvalue'(n.p.). Similarly, Usher (2013) found that journalists at Al Jazeera English, who do\nnot have to take economics into consideration, were nevertheless monitoring metrics for\n`personal validation'; they want their stories to do well (p. 346). Karlsson and Clerwall\n(2013) found that while public service journalists may not track metrics in real time, they\ndo look to clicks to `prove' their public relevance and thus provide legitimacy. Finally,\njournalists in the same study suggest clicks deserve not just a critical attitude as they can\nalso help increase the quality of journalism: if clicks indicate `important' stories did not\nreach the audience, journalists can take action (Karlsson and Clerwall, 2013).\nRace to the bottom?\nScholars typically evaluate clicks from a critical perspective because clicking patterns\nare seen as evidence that users prefer junk news over news about public affairs\nThis leads to worries about the future state of journalism and the implications for society.\nAlthough Nguyen (2013) notes that metrics `provide a considerable amount of accurate\nand reliable information for journalists and news executives [...] to serve people in a\nmore considered, more scientific manner', he warns that using them uncritically can lead\nto `the dumbing down of news' and `a disaster for public life in the long term' (p. 157).\nTandoc and Thomas (2015) argue that the use of metrics `has the potential to lock jour-\nnalism into a race towards the lowest common denominator, ghettoizing citizens into\nbundles based on narrow preferences and predilections rather than drawing them into a\ncommunity' (p. 247). Such observations echo journalists' assumptions about the narrow\nscope of the interests of the general public. As one journalist in Usher's (2013) research\nnoted, `On a certain level you just can't give the masses what they want. You are selling\nThe relationship between clicks and interest\nScholars \u00ad and journalists \u00ad typically measure clicks in terms of the most read or viewed\nnews stories, and in turn use these as a proxy for people's `preference' for or `interest' in\nnews (e.g. Boczkowski and Mitchelstein, 2013; Schaudt and Carpenter, 2009; Tenenboim\nand Cohen, 2015). For instance, Schaudt and Carpenter (2009) conclude from most-\nviewed stories lists that readers `most preferred' the news values `proximity' and `con-\nflict' and `least preferred' `timeliness' and `prominence'. Similarly, Tenenboim and\nCohen (2015) argue that `sensational topics and curiosity-arousing elements' being most\nheavily clicked indicates `that news consumers are mostly interested in non-public affairs\nnews' (p. 212). However, other research suggests that clicking patterns may not accu-\nrately or fully capture the interests or preferences of news users. We previously found\nthat people engage in online user practices that do not necessitate clicks but do express\ninterest in news, such as `checking', `monitoring', `scanning' and `snacking' (Costera\nGroot Kormelink and Costera Meijer 671\nMeijer and Groot Kormelink, 2015). Von Krogh and Andersson (2015) found that meas-\nured in clicks (page views), `public sphere' accounted for 9per cent of online news con-\nsumption, whereas measured in spent time it made up 20per cent. Therefore, our aim is\nto explore what it actually means when users click on news and also what it means when\nthey do not click, and how this relates to their (lack of) interest in or preference for news.\nMethodology\nTo explore what clicks actually mean, we researched people's considerations for click-\ning and not clicking by looking at their everyday online news browsing. Our approach\nwas mixing interviews with sensory ethnography and the think-aloud protocol (cf.\nO'Brien et al. (2014), who combined the think-aloud protocol with a simulated work\ntask scenario). First, participants were asked to describe how they use news throughout\nthe day, focusing on the `multisensoriality' (Pink 2009: 1) of their experiences (e.g.\nwhat they feel, taste, smell, hear or see when using news). This approach allowed us to\nget a layered picture of their news use (e.g. checking news with an espresso or while\nriding the bus) and enabled our participants to call to mind their news user practices.\nSubsequently, using the concurrent think-aloud protocol (Van Den Haak et al., 2003),\nparticipants were instructed to browse news as they normally would \u00ad using their own\ndevices and preferred websites and apps \u00ad and to say out loud all their steps and con-\nsiderations. Participants were encouraged to comment on actions they failed to men-\ntion spontaneously. We argue that the subsequent loss of natural flow was warranted\ngiven our aim of uncovering considerations for (not) clicking; indeed, subtle or sub-\nconscious actions like scanning or scrolling past a headline were as important as con-\nsciously clicking on news.\nIt should be noted that although most participants had little problem verbalizing\ntheir motivations, news users may not know precisely what they want and why they\nwant it. Yet, we argue that having participants provide their own account of why\nthey did (not) click might give a more accurate reflection of what clicking means to\nthem than having them choose from pre-selected categories, as is often the case in\nuses and gratifications research (see, for an overview, Ruggiero, 2000). Although\nsocially desirable answers should never be ruled out, the ease with which partici-\npants `admitted' to reading entertainment or being tired of news about Syria sug-\ngests we obtained a fair picture of the news they would normally (not) click. We\nalso sought to limit social desirability by having the interviewers demonstrate the\nthink-aloud protocol to participants using such `interviewer self-disclosures'\n(Lindlof, 1995: 182) as `I usually go to the entertainment section'. Finally, partici-\npants were selected from the social network of the interviewers as `the development\nof a personal relationship' is crucial for interviews that go `deeply into the person's\nWe seek to map the whole spectrum of considerations for (not) clicking rather than\nlook for the distribution, frequency or representativeness of clicking patterns. Yet, com-\nmon user patterns found across a relevant variety of news users might point to firmly\nanchored user patterns in general. A total of 56 people were interviewed in an everyday\nsetting, typically their home. Participants were selected using `maximum variation\nsampling' which seeks to generate a wide range of data by including a broad spectrum\nof users (List, 2004). To enable capturing a variety of consideration for (not) clicking,\nnews habits (e.g. light or heavy digital use). The participants were from various (e.g.\nrural, urban) parts of the Netherlands, a country characterized by high rates of Internet\npenetration (96%) and online news use (81%) (Newman et al., 2016). We might, there-\nfore, assume that their routines or preferences rather than obstructive technology (e.g.\nbad Internet connection) were the main factors in the participants' browsing behaviour.\nThe interviews were conducted in February and March 2014 by seven Journalism MA\nstudents from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and typically lasted 20\u00ad40\nminutes. This\nincluded the browsing of websites and apps, which ranged from quick `checking cycles'\n(Costera Meijer and Groot Kormelink, 2015) to lengthier reading sessions, depending\non how the participant would normally use news. Devices used included computers,\nlaptops, tablets and smartphones. Visited websites and apps varied but often concerned\nmajor Dutch titles including Nu.nl, NOS.nl and Telegraaf.nl. The interviewers received\nextensive interview training and exhaustive feedback after each interview round. All\ninterviews were recorded and transcribed. The process of analysis drew from the\nGrounded Theory Method, using constant comparison between data and analysis and\nallowing categories to emerge from the data themselves (Corbin and Strauss, 1990).\nInitial open coding was done by the first author, whereas the labelling of the concepts\nand subsequent integration of concepts into categories was done in collaboration with\nthe second author.\nBecause we are interested in participants' own considerations for (not) clicking, the\ncategories are illustrated through interview quotes. Even if some labels seem self-evi-\ndent, exploring the meaning of clicks for users demands taking seriously the perspective\nof the participants. Also, participants often had multiple reasons for (not) clicking on one\nparticular headline, but since we want to map the variety and range of user patterns, the\nquotes illustrate the categories in their `purest' form.\nConsiderations for clicking and not clicking\nFollowing the procedures of the Grounded Theory Method (Corbin and Strauss, 1990),\nwe found 30 distinct considerations for clicking and not clicking. After an extensive\nprocess of axial coding, the first major distinguishing factor between the considerations\nappeared to be whether or not they were content-related. The content-related considera-\ntions proved to be further divisible into cognitive and affective considerations. Here,\n`cognitive' refers to considerations where the decision whether or not to click was made\npredominantly on a mental level (`thinking'), whereas `affective'refers to considerations\nwhere the decision was made predominantly on an emotional level (`feeling'). We use\nthe term `predominantly' because the distinction between cognition and affect was more\ngradual than absolute. In the third category, not participants' thoughts or feelings about\ncontent but their pragmatic considerations were their dominant reference point for click-\ning or not clicking. For each consideration, we will note whether it concerns a reason to\nclick or not to click (or both), and where applicable, we will discuss how it relates to\nselection criteria of news professionals (cf. O'Neill and Harcup, 2009).\nGroot Kormelink and Costera Meijer 673\nCognitive considerations\nRecency and importance might be expected to be dominant considerations from a pro-\nduction perspective (cf. Golding and Elliott, 1979), yet were not mentioned much by our\nparticipants. Recency refers to whether the participant sees the news as timely or current.\nThe limited mentions of this consideration seem to contradict research that indicates how\nusers expect being presented with the latest news online (Bergstr\u00f6m, 2008; Groot\nKormelink and Costera Meijer, 2014). However, we argue that from a user perspective,\nrecency may constitute a general prerequisite for online news but not an important con-\nsideration when deciding which particular news item to click on.\nImportance refers to whether the participant views the news as significant in the con-\nventional sense. However, if from a professional perspective importance is about `need\nto know' (Golding and Elliott, 1979: 118), from a user perspective `ought to know' is a\nmore accurate description. Sandra (25) illustrates how the placement of news on a web-\nsite influences how important she perceives it to be:\n`Cabinet: no clear picture of money laundering', I couldn't care less, so wouldn't click on that.\n[...] If it was REALLY important it would have been big at the top [of the homepage]. Then\nmaybe I would've clicked on it.\nOnline news presented as important through prominent placement on the website or\nnews app is experienced as more worthy of knowing; if the same news is placed less\nprominently, it apparently is not significant enough to deserve a click. Like recency,\nimportance is not a dominant consideration when deciding which individual headline\nto click on. They are not so much selection criteria for (not) clicking on news as pre-\nrequisites for selecting a news site or app in the first place. Indeed, reflecting the origi-\nnal function of the front page of newspapers, users do expect (professional) news\nwebsites or apps to show them what is recent and important (Groot Kormelink and\nParticipants often clicked on news that had personal relevance, relating to their eve-\nryday life, including work. This consideration is dual, meaning that it counts as reason to\nclick when present and as reason not to click when absent. Henry (55), who invests,\nclicked on a news item about the stock market, but skipped a headline concerning the\nshares of a specific company: `I [don't invest] in companies, so the particular company\nmentioned here I couldn't care less about'. Matthew (25) clicked on a headline about\nSamsung Galaxy S5: `because I want to buy a new phone'but skipped news about rented\nhousing because `after [I leave my student house] I'm not going to rent, I will buy some-\nthing immediately'.\nGolding and Elliott (1979) distinguish between professional selection criteria geo-\ngraphical proximity and cultural proximity, and from a user perspective we found a\nsimilar distinction. Both considerations are dual. First, participants tended to click if\nthey saw the headline as concerning news taking place within their immediate sur-\nroundings, regardless of absolute distance. Bianca (54) clicked on a headline about a\ndead body found 20km away from her hometown: `[City] is so close, I just wanna\nknow. [...] And if it's not so close then it's not interesting'. Yet, Tracy (53) skipped a\nheadline about an accident that happened within a similar distance because she did\nnot experience it as nearby: `I think it didn't happen in this region but somewhere in\nthe south. No, that doesn't really interest me'. Golding and Elliot's (1979) `cultural\nproximity' depends `on what is familiar and within the experience of journalists and\ntheir audience', but for our participants, more specifically, it refers to whether they\nrecognize a kinship with the subject of the news, again regardless of absolute distance\n(p. 166). Leonard (24) clicked on sports news concerning compatriots: `I like cycling,\nespecially if Dutch people are participating. [...] I don't have to know if some Slovak\nwon a round in Poland'. Conversely, Dutch native Andrew (58) did not click on a\nheadline regarding Antilleans in the Netherlands because he does not feel a connec-\ntion: `It may be important, but [...] not for me right now. [...] Because I don't do\nanything with Antilleans. [...] I mean, I don't know one Antillean and I don't know if\nthey're good or bad'.\nWhereas for journalists unexpected refers to rare, out-of-the-ordinary developments\n(Galtung and Ruge, 1965), from a user perspective it is about whether the news fits their\nidea of what is common. Lilly (26) clicked on a headline about a joint action from a trade\nunion and an employers'organization: `Seems interesting, I'm curious why [they] are on\nthe same page here, seems a bit illogical'. It is important to stress that what is unexpected\nto journalists may not be experienced as unexpected by users, and vice versa. For\ninstance, Anita (21) did not click on news about a man lighting himself on fire: `Yeah,\nit's bad, but it's, I don't care [...] because uhm, yeah it happens regularly'.\nRelated to `unexpected' is the reason this is logical, where the user does not click\nbecause from their perspective the news is (too) obvious. Regarding the headline `Nokia\nunsure about brand name for the future', Nanda (21) noted that she already knew Nokia\nwas not doing well: `Then this seems like a logical continuation. Then I don't have to\nread it, because I already know why that is'.\nLike journalists selecting stories already in the news (Galtung and Ruge, 1965; Harcup\nand O'Neill, 2001), participants regularly clicked on follow-ups to stories they had read\nbefore. Lauren (26) illustrates, `What catches my eye immediately is the headline [....]\n\"Exam fraud [school] costs 3million euro.\" I've followed [that story] before'. A domi-\nnant reason not to click was that the participant already knew about the news. Not to be\nconfused with `follow-up'where users click on a new development, here they are already\nfamiliar with this particular development, as Karen (50) indicates: `[This] I already just\nheard, so I'm not going to read that again'.\nA dominant dual consideration was whether the subject of the headline rang a bell\nwith the participant. This concerned famous people but also names or events the partici-\npants recognized but could not quite place, as Nina (54) illustrates: `That Benno L.,\nyou've heard something about that before and then [you're] like, gosh, who was that\nBenno L. again?' Conversely, Eddy (53) asks why he would click if the subject matter\ndoes not ring a bell: `\"Fight parenting clinic and insurer resolved,\" well, I wouldn't know\nwhat a parenting clinic is, so (laughs) I'm like, why should I read that?'\nMore detail on particulars comes into consideration when the headline raises a ques-\ntion in the participant's mind, causing them to want to know more about the situation, as\nJack (56) illustrates: `Heavy weather in Italy, I see [...] (clicks) What is going on here?'\nFor a similar reason, Karen (50) clicked on a headline about a fishing ban: `Then I'm\nlike, what do we catch there? [...] What kind of fish is swimming there?'\nGroot Kormelink and Costera Meijer 675\nAnother reason to click was that the news enables participants to join in conversation.\nRod (24) explains why he clicked on a headline about the Winter Olympics:\nBecause if you start a conversation with people then often you want to talk about things that uh\nare recent and speak to a lot of people and uh the Winter Olympics I think are a part of that, so\nuhm to be able to join in the conversation, so to speak.\nRod's reason for clicking is the social utility function the topic provides: fodder for\nconversation. Teacher Joe (26) similarly clicked on a headline about the `largest lunar\nimpact ever recorded' `because I also talk about that with my students'.\nParticipants also clicked if they had their own opinion about a headline and wanted to\nsee how it was discussed in the article. Jenna (27) clicked on the headline `World Bank\nfreezes aid to Uganda over gay law' because `I personally have an opinion about it, so\nI'm curious on what grounds the World Bank does something like that'. However, this\nconsideration was uncommon; like in Donsbach's (1991) study that relativized the influ-\nence of cognitive dissonance on readers' selections, our participants rarely expressed\nstrong opinions about headlines. If they did, disagreement was not a reason not to click.\nParticipants regularly did not click on news they thought was repeating itself. We\nlabelled this supersaturation. Bruce (55) noted about the ongoing crisis in Syria:\n`Because every day it's the same, same, same, at some point it becomes less interesting.\nEven though it's not less terrible'. This is less about `compassion fatigue' (Moeller,\n1999) than about how hearing about it again does not provide new insights. The headline\ndoes not invite a click anymore, as Jeff (58) illustrates: `You actually drown in that kind\nof news. At some point you're like, it's not going to stop anyway. It's not that it's not\nimportant, but it doesn't stop'. As we will elaborate later, not wanting to click on a head-\nline does not mean the user does not want to see it. But for now the headline itself pro-\nvides a sufficient update about the situation; it is not until `something completely new'\nhappens that Jeff (58) will click again.\nSome participants clicked on headlines that offered a new perspective. This is not\nabout the news event being unexpected but about the headline offering `the other side' of\na topic. Such news inspires because it adds to your knowledge or broadens your horizon\nand as such enables an aha-erlebnis (cf. Costera Meijer, 2013). Corbin (24) illustrates,\nHere's an article called `According to these three imams the Koran has nothing against gays'.\nThat's interesting to me [because] you have this image that in the Koran it says that\nhomosexuality is wrong and here it says something completely different, and I'm curious how\nthat is substantiated by those imams.\nRather than the topic of homosexuality and the Islam it is the original angle of the\nheadline that makes Corbin click.\nSometimes, participants clicked on a headline because they wanted to see for them-\nselves or `experience' what happened. We labelled this participatory perspective. An\nexample is Nick (24), who clicked on the headline `Man makes illegal base jump from\nmoving ski lift' because he `can't really picture how anyone would do that' and hoped to\nsee it in a video.\nA reason not to click was that the headline was just an opinion. Regarding a develop-\ning story about the possible resignation of a minister, Tara (20) noted, `If a decision really\nhas been taken, I'll find it interesting, but [...] nine out of ten times it's blether. [...] If\n[prime minister] says \"[He] is staying,\" then that's not a truth but just an opinion'. What\nkeeps Tara from clicking is the lack of validity or decisiveness.\nA similar reason for not clicking was disjointed news fact, where the participant\ndoes not want to read a story until it is finalized. Tara (20) is not interested in clicking\non isolated updates about developments she is already aware of: `I don't need to have\nthat information in between, [...] I want the answer, you know, the conclusion'. From\na user perspective, even the conclusion of a story can be a disjointed news fact. Mark\n(52) did not click on a headline concerning a resolved conflict, because he was not\naware of the problem in the first place: `You have to know what the problem is [and]\nthen you can also know: what is the solution? [...] But yeah, just an isolated little fact,\nI would never read that'. About a headline regarding the Ukraine, he similarly argued\nthat it concerned a detail too small to warrant a click. If he were to click, he would\nalso want to know the context: `What is the cause? How did it happen? What hap-\npened? Why do they do it? What do they want to achieve?' This suggests that Mark\nwould appreciate a headline like `5 things you should know about the crisis in the\nUkraine' that allowed him to get a full picture of the situation within one article.\nAn important finding was that sometimes the participant did show (signs of) interest in\nparticular news items and yet did not click. The narrative construction of the headline\nappeared to be a relevant factor. A frequent occurrence was that the participants showed\ninterest in the news itself but the headline was informationally complete and consequently,\nthey did not expect to be better informed by clicking. Lauren (26) noted, `\"More than 4mil-\nlion viewers for Olympic finals 1500meters,\" that's a fun fact to know, but I know that this\nis usually all the information you're gonna get, so I don't really have to click it anymore'.\nThis is the opposite of clickbait: Lauren is interested in the topic, but there is no need to click\nbecause the headline tells the whole story. Nick (24) similarly illustrates, `I see it says \"Final\nwill be great,\" so I already know they're in the final so I don't necessarily have to click it'.\nFinally, sometimes there was an associative gap: despite the participants' apparent\ninterest in a topic, the headline did not tell them enough to want to click. Ella (51) read,\n`Pieterburen [location of a famous seal cr\u00e8che] will possibly move to [island]' and said,\n`The headline doesn't tell me much, that's why I don't click it'. However, later in the\ninterview she did click on a headline that explicitly mentioned `seals' and said she was\nfascinated by them. Clearly, she had not made the connection between Pieterburen and\nseals. Based on clicks, it would be tempting to conclude that Ellen was not interested in\nthis article, but based on her comments about how much seals `intrigue'her, it seems safe\nto assume that she is. Similarly, Matthew (25) was clear about his interest in clicking the\nheadline `Warning Kerry about Cold War Ukraine', claiming he was following all news\nabout the country because he planned to visit its city Chernobyl, `and of course I'm not\ngonna go there if there is almost a civil war'. Yet, he did not click on a headline about\nformer Ukrainian president Janoekovitsj because `I don't know exactly who that is, so I\nthink I would skip that'. While this consideration is similar to `ring a bell', the focus here\nis not the topic; instead, it is about not being able to make a connection between the\nheadline and the user's (pre-existing) interest in the topic.\nGroot Kormelink and Costera Meijer 677\nCognitive considerations\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Recency.

The user is unable to connect the headline to the topic.\nAffective considerations\nParticipants clicked on disheartening headlines, similar to the news value `bad news'\n(Harcup and O'Neill, 2001). Sarah (21) illustrates, `This one I would read: \"Biker killed\nby car.\" That's just sad'. However, if participants found the headline too disheartening,\nthey skipped it: `It's such a heavy text, \"Dragging patients is risky.\" I prefer starting with\nhappy news' (Jeff, 58). Indeed, on the other side of the emotional spectrum, participants\nclicked on light-hearted, fun headlines that made them feel good. Isabel (30) illustrates,\n`Something about self-cleaning plastic for cars. [...] Yeah, that's a fun news item. [...]\nIt's light, [...] just nice to read'. While this corresponds to the news value `good news'\n(Harcup and O'Neill, 2001), from a user perspective `feel good' is about the impact of\nthe news rather than its genre.\nSome participants clicked on headlines because they found the accompanying image\nvisually appealing, also a selection criterion for journalists (`visual attractiveness') (Golding\nand Elliott 1979: 155). Danny (25) is not interested in the news itself, but the picture evokes\narousal: `On Nu.nl you often have these dumb items about, I don't know, the New Year's\ndive. Couldn't care less, but if it happens to have a picture of a lady, I do click on it'.\nSimilar to the news value Harcup and O'Neill (2001) labelled `entertainment', partici-\npants regularly clicked on headlines that bemused them. More specific than wanting to\nbe amused, they feel a strong urge to click on the headline because they feel excitedly\npuzzled by it. Eva (19) illustrates, `Something provocative like \"Anders Breivik:\nPlaystation 2 instead of Playstation 3 is torture,\" [...] then I think what is this about? And\nthen I click it and read it'. Such headlines usually concern remarkable or bizarre news,\nwhich might partially explain why this type of news is so heavily clicked (cf. Tenenboim\nand Cohen, 2015). The colloquial term for this is clickbait \u00ad headlines with a `what-the-\nhell'factor that makes the user want to click, as Martin (24) illustrates: `Actually it never\nhas any news value, but it's usually those headlines that make you think, yeah, I'm curi-\nous what it is exactly'. A related reason not to click was that the participant felt the news\nwas bullshit. Leonard (24) explains, `Now I see \"German cat survives 30-meter fall.\"\nThen you're like, I don't care. [...] I think it's a bit rubbish actually'. We classified this\nas affective instead of cognitive because it is a gut reaction dismissing the pettiness of the\nheadline rather than a cognitive deliberation about whether or not the topic is nonsense.\nHowever, this consideration was mentioned less often than `bemusement', where the sil-\nliness of the headline was exactly what does make users click.\nAnother dominant dual consideration for (not) clicking was the categorical welcome\nor rejection of a particular `beat' or topic that participants felt, respectively, enthusiasm\nor aversion towards. The latter was often the case with sports news, as Ruth (24) illus-\ntrates: `The last [headline] is sports news, sports mean nothing to me'. Anita (21), on the\ncontrary, categorically welcomes news about sports with which she has affinity but\nrejects others: `I don't find soccer interesting, so I skip those headlines automatically.\nBut ice skating and tennis, those I do follow'. While this consideration is similar to `per-\nsonal relevance', the emphasis here is on the feeling the headline evokes rather than the\nrecognition of how the topic relates to one's life.\nAsurprising finding was that some participants clicked on news that gleefully annoyed\nthem. Lilly (26) clicked on the headline `President of Uganda will sign antigay law'\nbecause she found it `particularly bothersome that again there is a country that does not\nunderstand that homosexuality is not something you should draft a law against, so yeah,\nI'll read that news and be very irritated by it'. Isabel (30), similarly, clicked rather than\nignored a headline that annoyed her: `Bart Veldkamp once again has an opinion. [...]\nNow he thinks that the Netherlands should share their ice-skating knowledge. [...] It\ndoes evoke a bit of irritation, that headline. I'm like, you became a Belgian'.\nAffective considerations\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Disheartenment. The user is saddened by the news.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Feel-good. The light-hearted news makes the user feel good.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Visual appeal. The image evokes the urge to want to see more.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Bemusement. The user feels excitedly puzzled by the headline.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Bullshit. The user instantly dismisses of the pettiness of the headline.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Categorical welcome/rejection. The user feels either enthusiasm or aversion\ntowards the beat or the topic of the news.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Gleeful annoyance. The user is delightfully enraged by the news.\nGroot Kormelink and Costera Meijer 679\nPragmatic considerations\nSome participants did not click on news that would disrupt an otherwise smooth user\nexperience, for instance, due to loading time or commercials when clicking videos.\nBruce (55) illustrates, `Then you have to sit through commercials before you can watch\nsomething. Well, I won't do that, I don't want to'. A related reason not to click mostly\nassociated with videos was that the item was data-heavy. Here platform-specificity also\nplays a role. Joe (26) does click videos about wrestling news on his computer, but not on\nhis smartphone: `Videos [...] I'd rather not watch on my phone because, well, data\nheavy'. Clicking would cost him too much.\nFinally, participants did not click on news when it did not fit their routine. Josh (62)\nonly has a few minutes to check headlines before he leaves for work, where the radio is\nplaying the whole day. He skipped a headline about a poison gas attack in Syria, explain-\ning, `That's very important, [...] but I'm sure I'll hear it on the radio'. Similarly, Jenna\n(27) skipped a headline noting she would only click on it if she `really took the time to\nreally dive into it'. While interested, clicking right now did not fit her schedule.\nPragmatic considerations\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Disruption. Clicking will interrupt a smooth user experience.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Data-heaviness. Clicking will use up too much data.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Does not fit routine. Clicking does not match with the user's schedule.\nBrowsing patterns without click\nAnother important finding is that the participants engaged in online browsing patterns that\ndid express interest in news, yet did not necessitate a click. Costera Meijer and Groot\nKormelink (2015) have previously labelled these distinct user practices `checking', `monitor-\ning', `snacking'and `scanning'. Checking means quickly and efficiently finding out whether\nanything new or interesting is happening by looking at the latest headlines (Costera Meijer\nand Groot Kormelink, 2015). Clicks are not automatically involved, as Billy (52) illustrates:\n`For me it's important to just quickly see things, so just a [homepage] is fine, just the [head-\nlines]. [...] I actually use it just to quickly see what the latest news is'. Just because users do\nnot click on an item, does not mean that they do not want to see the headlines. Danny (25)\nexplains, `It's nice that you kind of know what is happening in the world. Because let's say\n[the item] wasn't there anymore. [...]Then people start to talk and then you really don't know\nanything about it'. For social purposes, then, he does want to check the latest important news:\n`The headlines I'd want, yes, but the articles themselves, uh, whatever'.\nMonitoring is `actively surveying the informational environment to be able to come\ninto action when necessary' (Costera Meijer and Groot Kormelink, 2015: 671). Annabel\n(53) describes, `When those two criminals were on the loose last week, I constantly\nlooked on my phone to see if they were caught. That was really scary'. Even though\nAnnabel was continually monitoring her smartphone for updates, no clicks were regis-\ntered. In similar fashion, Henry (55) uses his phone to monitor his investments: `I return\nto that at least once every two hours, because I want to see how my portfolio is develop-\ning'. In both the cases, their evident interest in news was not captured in clicks.\nSnacking is defined as grabbing `bits and pieces of information in a relaxed, easy-going\nfashion to gain a sense of what is going on' (Costera Meijer and Groot Kormelink, 2015:\n670). Danny (25) describes how he snacks on a website about movie news without click-\ning: `I scroll a bit and look at pictures and at movies and then I click away [from the site]'.\nScanning means picking out `the highlights of news in order to get the gist of the\nning does not necessitate any clicking. Although she does want to know about the news,\nshe plucks words from the lead on the homepage to get the essence: `Like here: they\n\"foresee no profits,\" it's about \"Dutch companies,\" OK, then I know enough'. As noted,\neven headlines can be so informationally complete that they do not necessitate a click\neven if the user is interested.\nConclusion and discussion\nThis article explored what clicks mean from a user perspective and to what extent they\nreflect the interests of news users. Asking and observing how people browse online\nnews, we found 30 considerations for clicking or not clicking, classifiable into three\ncategories: cognitive, affective and pragmatic. These differences are not normative but\ndescriptive of the level on which the decision to click or not click is made: mental, emo-\ntional or practical. Taking an open, user-centred grounded theory approach rather than\nemploying prefigured categories (e.g. from uses and gratifications theory) has resulted in\na more complex account of people's digital news use. For instance, cognitive considera-\ntions are not limited to information seeking (surveillance) but include the (lack of) rec-\nognition of news (ring a bell, associative gap) and the perception of how news is presented\n(e.g. disjointed news fact, just an opinion, new perspective). Likewise, affective consid-\nerations go beyond entertainment or positive affect and include feelings of negative (dis-\nheartenment) and mixed affect (gleeful annoyance). Our user-centred approach has also\ngenerated a vocabulary for news values and selection criteria that puts focus not on how\nnews is sent but how it is received. The detailed labels might be relevant for journalism\nprofessionals seeking to understand what user experiences like enthusiasm and aversion\nare based on and provide a handle on how to effectuate or avoid such reactions.\nOur results suggest that while clicking does indicate some type of interest, preference\nor engagement towards news, these concepts are too crude to account for the wide vari-\nety of people's considerations for (not) clicking; our precise labels provide a more fine-\ngrained vocabulary. More importantly, even if one seeks a rough estimate of people's\nnews interests, clicks are a flawed instrument. First, pragmatic considerations unrelated\nto interest in content interfere with users' clicking behaviour. Second, headlines can tell\nusers interested in particular topics too little (associative gap) to warrant a click or\nenough (informational completeness) not to warrant a click. Finally, digital news user\npractices such as checking, monitoring, snacking and scanning may not involve any\nclicking, but do fulfil valuable functions for users, including being brought up to speed\non the latest `public affairs'developments without interrupting one's news flow. In terms\nof news interests, then, the news gap between news makers and news users may not be\nas wide or unbridgeable as Boczkowski and Mitchelstein (2013) point out. If news users\nappreciate browsing without having to click, future research might explore the\nGroot Kormelink and Costera Meijer 681\nunderlying logic of these experiences as well as how non-clicking browsing patterns can\nbe optimally facilitated and measured.\nOur argument is not that clicks are meaningless, they just capture a limited range of\nusers' interests or preferences. Clicks may be helpful for news organizations looking to\nincrease traffic through A/B testing of headlines or article placement (Cherubini and\nCherubini and Nielsen, 2016), metrics that measure various forms of engagement (see\nNapoli, 2011) seem promising because they capture a broader array of digital user prac-\ntices than only clicking. Such metrics could help organize websites and apps so as to\naccommodate users' diverse expectations and desires at different times and in different\ncontexts. In addition, information about users might be used not for `ghettoizing citizens\ninto bundles based on narrow preferences and predilections'(Tandoc and Thomas, 2015:\n247) but for tracing and providing news that has `proportional relevance'(Costera Meijer,\n2003) to different communities. For instance, students are not only interested in news\nabout students but also \u00ad as participant Matthew suggested \u00ad interested in news about the\nstarter-home market. However, each metric should be assessed critically rather than\ntaken at face value. Our research has shown how an open, qualitative user-centred\napproach can help examine what metrics do and do not measure.\nIf clicks only tell part of the story, our own methods are not without limitations either.\nThe concurrent think-aloud protocol forces participants to consider and verbalize actions\nthat in everyday life are often done automatically or subconsciously. Therefore, we\nencourage other researchers to further explore clicking and not clicking using different\nmethods, such as (video) ethnography, tracking devices or screen capture tools.\nFinally, and paradoxically, by giving people what they supposedly `want' \u00ad as cap-\ntured in clicks \u00ad news organizations could end up harming not only democracy but also\nthemselves, as adhering to clicks might lead to the trivialization of news and thus to a\ndecreasing interest of users.\n"
