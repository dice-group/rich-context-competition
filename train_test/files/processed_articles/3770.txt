    "abstract": "Abstract\nConsumers are becoming more health conscious. Increasingly, products that are labeled \"healthy\" are being marketed as new\nretailers and new brands vie for the consumers' share of wallet. This research identifies the self-image factors that constitute\na health conscious image of the self and examines how self-image impacts consumer buying of foods that are labeled healthy.\nIt also makes an effort to find out whether specific self-image factors are significantly associated with demographics. This\nstudy employs a scale consisting of 15 statements that included four statements from the Health Consciousness scale\ndeveloped by Gould. The psychometric properties of the scale used in the study are reported. The study uses factor analysis\nto identify five factors of consumer self-image as they relate to health consciousness. Furthermore, the study explores the\nrelationship between demographics such as age, gender, education, and relationship status with the self-image factors and\nreports results for consumer preferences for choosing healthy foods when hungry. This research has important implications\nfor marketers in the health food industry and for such other companies that might use consumer health consciousness as a\nbasis for market segmentation and strategy design.\n",

Years of consumer research have con-\nfirmed an intimate connection between identity and con-\nsumption behavior (Weiss & Johar, 2013; White & Argo,\n2009). Products help to define and maintain consumers' self-\nconcept by reinforcing their identities (Berger & Ward, 2010;\n2011). Brands are important to consumers for their func-\ntional benefits and their symbolic meaning. They help them\nin portraying their self-image and how others perceive them\nuct consumption symbolizes personal attributes, motiva-\ntions, and social patterns, symbolic consumption reflects the\npersonality and lifestyle of consumers, helping in expressing\nsocial distinctions (Sirgy, 1982). Consumers express their\nidentities by choosing brands whose images are perceived to\nbe similar to their own self-images (Aaker, 1999; Kassarjian,\nwith an important identity sometimes causes cognitive dis-\nsonance, motivating consumers to sometimes cease consum-\ning the less identity-consistent product (Berger & Heath,\n2008), leading them to seek out and consume products that\nare more identity consistent (Ward & Broniarczyk, 2011).\nHealth consciousness assesses the degree to which a per-\nson plays an active role in maintaining his or her health. It is\na motivational component encouraging consumers to\nenhance or sustain their physical well-being by engaging in\npreventive behaviors and health care (Jayanti & Burns, 1998;\nMichaelidou & Hassan, 2008). Health conscious consumers\npurposively monitor their state of health and perform\n1SUNY Potsdam, NY, USA\n2Siena College, Loudonville, NY, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nSavita Hanspal, Department of Business Administration, SOEPS, SUNY\nEmail: hanspal.savita@gmail.com\nImpact of Consumers' Self-Image and\nDemographics on Preference for Healthy\nLabeled Foods\nSavita Hanspal1 and P.

In recent\ndecades, consumption of fast food and food away from home\nhas increased in the United States (Krieger et al., 2013).\nAccording to Poti and Popkin (2011) and Powell et al.\nrants accounted for an estimated per day consumption of 275\nkilocalories (kcal) among children, 564 kcal among adoles-\ncents, and 599 kcal among adults amounting to energy intake\nof 14% for children and 24% of total energy for adolescents\nand adults. Healthy diet helps to prevent type 2 diabetes,\nobesity, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers (Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, 2012). The direct costs\nof diet-related diseases account for an enormous proportion\nof the total health expenditures in the world--diabetes mel-\nlitus type 2 alone accounts for 11% of the total costs world-\nwide (International Diabetes Federation, 2013). The type of\nfood consumed is, therefore, likely to influence money spent\non health care.\nEating healthy also gets a lot of publicity as it is seen as a\npanacea for curing obesity. Media has played a crucial role in\nhighlighting obesity and its ill effects on both short-term and\nlong-term enjoyment of life. Public policy makers have,\ntherefore, aimed to foster healthy food choices (e.g., fruits,\nvegetables) and reduce consumption of unhealthy food. The\nsocial marketing campaigns urge people to consume fruits\nand vegetables and avoid fast food and sugary drinks in large\nsizes to contain high expenditures on health care. Media has\nalso highlighted the irresponsible practices of the food busi-\nness that have caused harm to health.\nConsuming healthy food is seeing an upsurge not only in\nthe United States but all around the world. It has, therefore,\nbecome \"cool\" to be seen as being a health conscious con-\nsumer. Since the late 1970s, nutrition-related behaviors have\nemerged as consumers'most frequent activity to stay healthy\nrecognized \"interest in health\" as a key motive in the pur-\nchase of organic food (Grankvist & Biel, 2001; Lockie et al.,\ning to these changed preferences by increasingly selling\nproducts labeled \"healthy.\" Food retailers and manufacturers\nalso eagerly position themselves as health friendly to target\nhealth-conscious consumers (Leeflang & Van Raaij, 1995;\nCornish (2012) classified healthy foods into nutritionally\nrich and nutritionally poor functional foods. His study\nrevealed that although a number of functional foods (e.g.,\nprobiotic yoghurts, cholesterol-lowering spreads) are proven\nto provide genuine health benefits and have become a staple\nof the modern diet (Nestle, 2007), some other functional\nfoods (e.g., low-fat cookies, zinc-fortified breakfast cereals),\nalthough fortified, lack real nutritive value (Pollan, 2009;\nUrala & L\u00e4hteenm\u00e4ki, 2003) and provide no real health\nbenefits (Nestle, 2007). Food choice theories suggest that\nconsumers are more likely to be swayed by nutritional beliefs\nand labels than actual nutritional quality, at times making\nwrong choices.\nIt is, therefore, pertinent to understand whether only the\nconsumers with a \"health conscious\" self-image would con-\nsume healthy labeled foods. The present study has been con-\nceived to address this question. The following paragraphs\nsummarize the extant literature in the area.\nLiterature Review\nThe survey of literature focused on self-image, self-concept,\nhealth orientation/consciousness, nutrition labeling, and\nhealthy/organic foods consumption for identifying relevant\nstudies.\nPast research has established that self-concept influences\na variety of consumer behavior decisions including choice of\noffice decor (Gosling et al., 2002), brand preference (Escalas\n& Bettman, 2003), and choice of accessories (Berger &\nWard, 2010). Identity-consistent products are consumed not\nonly as a signal to others but also as signals to the self\nneed for coherence, meaning, and control (Heine et al., 2006;\nthey seek out products that provide feedback consistent with\ntheir self-concept. A consumer's sense of self influences\npreferences for products that help maintain their self-concept\nlize product choice to offset dissonance-arousing self-con-\ncept threats encountered in the environment (Rucker &\nConsumers choose those brands that are harmonious with\ntheir personality and self-image (Ericksen, 1996; Graeff,\net al., 1991) and psychologically compare their self-images\nwith the stereotypical user of a brand (Sirgy, 1982). The\ninteraction between the image of the product user in various\nmedia and consumer's self-concept results in the consumer\nstriving for self-image congruence (Sirgy et al., 1997), an\nimportant predictor of consumer behavior (Sirgy, 1982;\nSirgy et al., 1997). Research has also shown that self-image\ncongruence affects customers' brand preferences and their\ning the creation of positive attitudes and behavior toward\nAccording to Graeff (1996), self-image is positively related\nto customers' product evaluations and triggers motives that\ncreate the need for self-consistency and self-esteem.\nHowever, there is a difference in the brand images of socially\n(e.g., conspicuous consumption) and privately consumed\nbrands and, hence, the effects of self-image congruence are\nlikely to be stronger for publicly consumed products (e.g.,\nautomobiles and jeans). Hume and Mills (2013) found that\nHanspal and Devasagayam 3\nself-esteem and self-image also influenced private purchases\nsuch as intimate women's apparel and fashion.\nDue to interplay of factors such as price, income, prod-\nuct life cycle, consumer involvement, product utility and\nvalue, image congruence does not always materialize\n(Onkvisit & Shaw, 1987). Individuals can vary in the degree\nor level (high or low) of self-image congruence experi-\nenced by them. The extent to which self-concept is acti-\nvated in a given context can also moderate the effect of\nself-image congruence on certain consumer behavior. Khan\nand Dhar (2006) showed that one instance of bolstering\none's self-concept through a virtuous action could increase\nthe likelihood of choosing a luxury over a necessity in a\nsubsequent unrelated choice.\nStudies have also been conducted on self-image congru-\nence and specific brands. Jamal andAl-Marri (2007) explored\nthe impact of self-image congruence and brand preference on\nbrand satisfaction among expert and novice customers of\nautomobile brands. Bosnjak and Brand (2008) regressed\nconsumption-related attitudes and intentions of Chevrolet\ncar on participants' perceived match between their self-con-\ncept and different positive and negative image facets.\nOrganic foods are purchased more due to perceived health\nbenefits than their environmental benefits (Hughner et al.,\nchildren could increase their parents' health conscious\nchoices (Prasad et al., 2008), they could also increase their\npurchases of indulgent snack foods (Marshall et al., 2007).\nHealth (and diet) concerns could shift the way shoppers\napproached indulgences and/or influenced their perceptions\nof which categories constituted indulgences. Mazar and\nZhong (2010) demonstrated that when people considered\ngreen purchases such as organic food, they felt virtuous for\ntaking a socially and environmentally positive action and\nwere more likely to lie or show other negative moral behav-\nior afterward.\nA study by Chugani et al. (2015) found that satiation was\nlinked to a consumer's self-concept and the rate of satiation\nto identity-consistent products depended on the consumers\nactive connections between their sense of self and the focal\nidentity. Heath and Scott (1998) showed that if the brand-\nrelated information was inconsistent with the customers'\nself-concept, it was not likely to gain customers' attention,\nacceptance, and retention. Sirgy et al. (1997) reported that\nself-image congruence was a strong predictor of brand satis-\nwas generally described as the full meeting of one's expecta-\ntions (Oliver, 1997) and was widely recognized not only as a\nkey influence on the customers'future purchase intentions of\nthat brand (Taylor & Baker, 1994) but also as the key to\nretaining customers and improving profitability (Anderson\ndynamic, motivated agents who evaluated both themselves\nand the world around them in a manner consistent with a set\nof \"sacrosanct beliefs\" and self-motives.\nBisogni et al. (2012) found that different life experiences,\nself-concept, resources, food availability, and conflicting\nconsiderations influenced people in developed countries not\neating according to their ideals for healthy eating. Mai et al.\n(2012) showed that health conscious consumers were more\nwilling to elaborate on health-related product attributes (e.g.,\nnutrition facts) and emphasized food naturalness (e.g., non-\ngenetically engineered foods).\nChang et al. (2003) found that those who had open, con-\nscientious, and extroverted personalities had higher needs for\nhealth consciousness and used food traceability labels as a\nunique learning device and choice criteria.\nPast research on the effectiveness of nutrition labeling has\nbeen remarkably inconclusive, irrespective of whether it was\nconducted in a grocery store (Moorman et al. 2012) or res-\ntaurant settings. Some studies concluded that providing\nnutritional information on restaurant menus lowered caloric\nintake (e.g., Milich, Anderson, & Mills, 1976; Roberto et al.,\nfound that the information had no effect (e.g., Elbel et al.,\ning an effect, the size of the effect tended to be small. Balfour\nproportion of consumers (16% and 29%, respectively)\nchanged their menu item selection when presented with\nnutrition information.\nCornish (2012) examined the impetus behind the con-\nsumption of both nutritionally rich and nutritionally poor\nfunctional foods and found that consumers were unable to\ndistinguish between the two, and believed the health claims\nof both. The consumption of nutritionally poor foods could\nhave a negative impact on consumer well-being, pointing to\nthe necessity of educating consumers about what constituted\na healthy diet, the role of nutrients as building blocks in\nhealthy diets, and the importance of choosing appropriate\nsources for these nutrients to enable them to make healthier\ndietary choices.\nA number of studies have been conducted on the impact\nof calorie information on labels on choice of low calorie\nfoods. In a study conducted in New York City (Elbel et al.,\n2009), of the 28% of fast food patrons using calorie labels,\n88% reported being influenced by the information; of the\n68% customers dining at restaurants in Seattle, 45% said the\ncalorie labels informed their meal choice, and only 13%\nreported the information influenced what they ordered for\nEllison et al. (2013) explored the potential relationships\nbetween caloric intake and diners' socioeconomic character-\nistics and attitudes in a restaurant field experiment that sys-\ntematically varied the caloric information printed on the\nmenus. Results showed that calorie labels had the greatest\nimpact on those who were least health conscious. In addition,\nusing a symbolic calorie label could further reduce the caloric\nintake of even the most health conscious patrons. Finally,\n4 SAGE Open\ncalorie labels were more likely to influence the selection of\nthe main entr\u00e9e as opposed to supplemental items such as\ndrinks and desserts. The study concluded that if numeric\ncalorie labels were implemented, they were most likely to\ninfluence consumers who were less health conscious. To\nreach a broader group of diners, a symbolic calorie label may\nbe preferred as it reduced caloric intake across all levels of\nhealth consciousness. In another study in 2014, the same\nauthors used field experiment data, to compare the effective-\nness of calorie labels with a \"fat tax\" at reducing calories\nordered. Results of the research study revealed menu label-\ning could influence food choice. The study found that when\nno calorie label was present, a greater proportion of higher\ncalorie meals (more than 800 calories) were ordered than\nwhen either a numeric or symbolic calorie label was utilized,\nand that the symbolic calorie label led to greater calorie\nreductions than the numeric calorie label proposed by the\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA).\nGad et al. (2013) surveyed U.K. consumers and explained\nconsumption motivations through examining antecedents of\ntemporally dominated benefits in application to organic\nfood. The research findings established significant associa-\ntions of level of involvement, prior knowledge, product\nusage, and some association of time orientation with the tem-\nporally emphasized consumption benefits consumers ulti-\nmately pursued.\nA number of research studies have focused on messages\nused to promote the consumption of healthy foods. Krystallis\nand Chrysochou (2011) examined whether health food (low\nfat) claims positively influenced levels of brand loyalty and\nfound that products with health food claims could have\nnoticeable advantages over competitors. Mohr et al. (2012)\ndiscussed serving size and its impact on calorie information\nand consumer guilt. Robinson et al. (2014) found that health-\nbased messages used to promote fruit and vegetable intake\nwere limited in their effectiveness. Instead, social norm mes-\nsages, suggesting other people were eating healthily, were\nmore effective.\nMai et al. (2015) found that the goal conflict between\nshort-term indulgence and long-term health considerations\nwas at the heart of unhealthy food choices. The research\nexamined the potential of health consciousness to resolve the\nunhealthy = tasty intuition (UTI) and demonstrated that the\nUTI partly worked implicitly and independently of health\nconsciousness.\nSpecific studies focusing on the impact of socio-demo-\ngraphic factors on the consumption of healthy food were also\nfound. Research by Pasternak et al. (1996) showed that\ndietary guidelines were often not followed. Glanz et al.\n(1998) found that nutrition was more important to women\nand older individuals, making these groups more responsive\nto menu labels as opposed to young males. Gandini et al.\n(2000) suggested that despite the fact that socioeconomic\nstatus (SES) could be assessed in terms of income, occupa-\ntion, and/or educational level, each of these dimensions had\nits own causal pathway toward dietary habits. Herman et al.\n(2003) argued that food choice was influenced by a desire to\nconvey a certain impression or adhere to social norms (Leary\nfound that the workplace culture, social networks, and future\nsalience mediated the relationship between occupation and\ndiet. Grotza et al. (2011) examined the association between\nhealth behavior and socio-demographic variables and Health\nLocus of Control (HLC). They found that higher age, low\nSES, and migration background were associated with higher\nHLC scores.\nresidents of low-income neighborhoods were least likely to\nreport using calorie labels to make a lower calorie food\nchoice, Dumanovsky et al. (2011) found consumers in more\naffluent communities were most likely to use this informa-\ntion. Women, especially those between the age group of 18\nand 24 years more so than men, reported using calorie labels\nGram, 2013), and compliance with dietary guidelines steadily\nfell as SES decreased (Grundy et al. 1999). Casagrande et al.\ndiet relationship was mediated by access to food and diet\nThe educational level\u00addiet relationship might be medi-\nated by attitudes toward healthy eating, knowledge about\nfood (Booth et al., 1992), family values (McLeod et al.,\nEducation seemed to be the most important variable to\nexplain social differences in dietary habits (Cho et al., 2009;\nHuckfeldt & Sprague, 1995). Mediation of the educational\nlevel\u00addiet relationship by attitudes toward healthy eating\nwas twice as strong in women as in men (Wardle et al., 2004).\nparticipants surveyed, favorable attitudes toward healthy eat-\ning were associated with both higher educational level and\ndiet quality, and that higher educated people were more\nlikely to pay \"attention to health when buying food,\" and\n\"organic food consumption,\" but were less likely to cite\nhealth in the perceived role of eating.\nGram and Blichfeldt (2014) explored female students'\nfood dilemmas to identify reasons why unhealthy food con-\nsumption happened despite the students' good intentions to\neat healthy diets and found that female students were well\ninformed about nutrition, and several of them were experi-\nenced cooks from home but \"bad\" food sneaked into their\ndiets, because of lack of time and energy, pressure from their\nstudies and food cravings, along with more liberal rules in\nsocial situations.\nResearch studies also focused on the role of emotions and\nfood choices. Ogden (2009) found that the link between\nemotions and food consumption was well documented, and\nboth negative and positive emotions influenced eating behav-\nadvocated that emotional issues such as boredom, loneliness,\nHanspal and Devasagayam 5\nunhappiness, and stress affected U.S. students' consumption\nof particularly unhealthy foods.\nSome researchers focused on factors influencing con-\nsumption of healthy foods. Herman et al. (2003) found that\nsocial influence affected eating, that behaviors were influ-\nenced by social comparisons (Hupkens et al. 2005;\neating was a normative standard (Jutel, 2005). McFerran\net al. (2010a) examined the effect of body type of consumers\non the food consumption of other consumers around them\nand found that people chose a larger portion following\nanother consumer who first selected a large quantity but that\nthis portion was significantly smaller if the other was obese\nthan if she was thin.\nAn interesting study by Karmarkar and Bollinger (2015)\nfocused on shopping with reusable grocery bags and its\nimpact on consumers'in-store behavior. Using scanner panel\ndata from a single California location of a major grocery\nchain, and controlling for consumer heterogeneity, they dem-\nonstrated that bringing one's own bags increased purchases\nof not only environmentally friendly organic foods but also\nindulgent foods.\nA research by Huneke et al. (2015) examined the effect of\nservice employees' appearance on consumers' food choice\nusing an experimental study, involving a video manipulation\nand eye-tracking technique. The study demonstrated that\nexposure to the overweight employee did not stimulate\ngreater attention to unhealthy meal alternatives, whereas\nexposure to the employee who displayed an unhealthy life-\nstyle did.\nKelly et al. (2016) focused on an increasing societal\nimpact of ill health in later life. They found that lack of time\n(due to family, household, and occupational responsibilities),\naccess issues (to transport, facilities, and resources), finan-\ncial costs, entrenched attitudes and behaviors, restrictions in\nthe physical environment, low SES, and lack of knowledge\nwere the recurring barriers. Specific issues relating to popu-\nlation and culture were identified relating to health\ninequalities.\nThus, the studies reviewed have covered diverse aspects\nof consumption of healthy foods but most of them have\nfocused on factors influencing purchase of healthy foods or\nthe impact of food labeling legislation on choice of food.\nSome research was found on self-image as a variable influ-\nencing consumption of various products but there is a lack of\nresearch on the self-image of health conscious consumers\nand the relationships between self-image and consumption\nof healthy labeled foods. Furthermore, none of the studies\nattempted to identify how consumers defined themselves as\nbeing health conscious and how this might affect the choice\nof foods labeled healthy. It is to fill this gap that the present\nstudy is designed.\nThe objective of this research is to better understand how\nconsumers view themselves in terms of health consciousness\nand whether some demographic factors are associated more\nsignificantly with the health conscious self-image, and fur-\nther, whether consumers with a health conscious self-image\nare more prone to purchase food labeled \"healthy.\"\nHypotheses Development\nThere are no two opinions that with an increased conscious-\nness to consume healthy foods and beverages, understand-\ning the factors that influence consumer preferences toward\nhealth food is becoming increasingly important in the mar-\nket today. Food consumption decisions are no longer\nrestricted to being personal but carry a social image and are\nmodified by peer approval that is dependent on the types of\nfood consumed by individuals, especially because food is\nvery frequently consumed in a social setting with family,\nfriends, colleagues, and others. Self-image influences the\nconsumption of products and that, in fact, consumers strive\ntoward maintaining self-image congruity and as such choose\nproducts that support their self-image. Research has also\nshown that if products fail to match the self-image held by\nconsumers, they are likely to avoid consuming them. To\nunderstand how consumers who support the self-image of\nbeing health conscious choose products labeled healthy, it is\nimportant to understand what constitutes the self-image of\nhealth consciousness.\nThis study aims to find out how people who consume\nproducts labeled healthy choose to describe themselves in\nterms of health consciousness. Do all the consumers define\nthemselves in terms of the same variables? Can we address\nthem as one segment of consumers who are concerned about\ntheir health? Are there differences in the perceptions of\nhealth consciousness among consumers regarding what con-\nstitutes a health conscious self-image? This leads us to exam-\nine the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1: There are differences on account of vari-\nables used to describe the self-image of health conscious-\nness among consumers of healthy labeled foods.\nPrevious research has also shown that demographic fac-\ntors influence the consumption of food. It will then be perti-\nnent to find out whether consumers who consider themselves\nas health conscious are likely to differ in their demographics.\nThus, we need to examine a second hypothesis:\nHypothesis 2: There are differences among health con-\nscious consumers on account of demographic factors,\nsuch as age, gender, education, and relationship status.\nResearch has also shown that consumers belonging to dif-\nferent demographic factors are likely to differ in terms of\ntheir consumption behavior. Would this analogy be applica-\nble to consumers with a health conscious self-image in their\nconsumption of healthy labeled foods too? We, therefore,\nneed to understand as to whether consumers holding the\n6 SAGE Open\nhealth conscious self-image actually consume food labeled\nhealthy when they are hungry or whether they choose prod-\nucts that are not labeled as such. This leads us to our third\nhypotheses:\nHypothesis 3: Consumers holding a health conscious\nself-image will consume only those products that are\nlabeled healthy.\nMethod\nThe study focused on understanding the factors that consti-\ntuted the self-image of health consciousness and its effect on\nactual purchase of healthy food. A brief (5-6 min) self-\nadministered online questionnaire was designed, pretested,\nand distributed to a random sample via emails. The email\ninvitation provided a brief description of the study and a link\nto the survey. The respondents were allowed to opt to take\nthe survey by filling an informed consent form prior to begin-\nning the survey itself, but were unable to go back to previous\nscreens to review or revise their responses, to reduce a halo\nbias that could contaminate results.\nThe survey included 15 items to measure the self-image\nof people toward health consciousness, and questions related\nto demographics and actual purchase behavior. For the pur-\npose of this study, the Health Consciousness Scale created by\nStephen Gould in 1988 was modified. Of the original nine\nitems, four items were selected from this scale and 11 addi-\ntional items were added to it. Two focus groups were con-\nducted to identify behaviors related to the consumption of\nhealthy labeled foods. These 11 additional items were identi-\nfied and developed from the conversations in these groups.\nTwo types of scale options were used: a five-point scale\nranging from not like me at all (1) to like me (5) to describe\nthemselves and another scale where they described their\nlevel of agreement from strongly disagree (1) to strongly\nagree (5) with their activities and opinions related to health\nconscious behavior. SPSS 18 was used for analysis.\nSample Profile\nCare was taken to obtain unbiased data from different age\ngroups, gender, education levels, ethnicities, and relationship\nstatuses. The total sample consisted of 390 respondents. The\nincidence rate was 92.6%. The sample emerged to be largely\ndifferent age groups. Two age segments appeared to be\ngraduated with a high school diploma and 24% had acquired\na bachelor's degree. Approximately 52% of the sample con-\nsisted of respondents still studying for their undergraduate\ndegree, and about 64% were either in a relationship or mar-\nried and 36% were single.\nReliability\nBefore conducting further analysis of the data, it was\nimportant to assess the reliability of the scales used for\nmeasuring health consciousness. The user-defined missing\nvalues were treated as missing and statistics are based on\nall cases with valid data. For the purpose of calculating\nreliability, 29 cases were excluded list-wise as the\nresponses were incomplete and 361 cases were used for\nthis computation. The analysis revealed a Cronbach's\nalpha of .753. The value of the alpha coefficient if an item\nwas deleted was computed to ascertain whether its value\ncould be further improved (Table 1).\nThe analysis revealed that if we dropped item number 9,\nthe value of the alpha coefficient would increase to .787. It\nwas, however, not dropped from further analysis because\nits deletion would have increased the scale variance. To fur-\nther understand whether some of the variables consumers\nused to describe themselves as health conscious could be\nfurther reduced, a factor analysis of the 15 statements was\nconducted.\nAre There Different Self-Image Factors of Health\nConsciousness?\nTo identify prominent self-image variables, exploratory fac-\ntor analysis was used. To assess whether the data were ade-\nquate for this purpose, the value of Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin\n(KMO) measure of sampling adequacy was computed (Table\n2). This measure varies between 0 and 1, and although values\ncloser to 1 are better, the value of .6 is a suggested minimum.\nThe KMO measure was .840, which is considered good for\nconducting the factor analysis. The analysis also meets the\nrequirements of Bartlett's test of sphericity, which tests the\nhypothesis that the correlation matrix is an identity matrix,\nand there are correlations in the data set that are appropriate\nfor factor analysis.\nThe principal component method and varimax rotation\nwere used. Factors with eigenvalues above one (EV  1;\nKaiser, 1958) were selected after conducting the scree test\n(Cattell, 1966). This resulted in identifying five factors,\nexplaining 69% variance. The rotated component matrix was\nused to identify statements composing each factor. The\nrotated factor loadings (factor pattern matrix) represent both\nhow the variables are weighted for each factor and the cor-\nrelation between the variables and the factor. Being correla-\ntions, their possible values range from 1 to +1. Furthermore,\nto identify the constituent statements, those with factor load-\nings below .26 were ignored. Items that did not load on any\nof the retained factors or with factor loading <.26 were\nsequentially removed based on the recommendation pro-\ncan be considered significant for a sample size of 50, a load-\ning greater than .512 is significant for a sample size of 100,\nand a loading greater than .364 is significant for a sample\nHanspal and Devasagayam 7\nsize of 200. By the same reasons, therefore, a factor that con-\nsists of a single statement that loads high is considered highly\ndesirable. Furthermore, statements that loaded highly for\nmore than one factor were retained only toward the factor\nthey loaded highest on and were removed from consideration\nfrom other factors. Accordingly, Table 3 lists the statements\nthat were found to constitute the factors\nDescription of Factors\nThe five factors identified by the research portray the differ-\nent self-image variables that constitute each factor. These are\ndescribed below.\nSelf-Image Factor 1\nThis factor represented the self-image that identified\nitself with an overly concern for health. The respondents\nsubscribing to this self-image constantly reflect about\ntheir health and believe that they live a healthy lifestyle.\nThey closely monitor their physical condition throughout\nthe day, are self-conscious about their health, and try to\nmake healthy choices in their food consumption deci-\nsions. They are, thus, actively seeking healthy labeled\nfood products. Accordingly, we labeled this factor as\nhealth conscious.\nSelf-Image Factor 2\nThis image identifies with those who like to eat healthy, as it\nis important for them to monitor their calorie intake. They\ncorrelate a healthy body with an ideal weight and make efforts\nto avoid obesity. They actively search for nutritional informa-\ntion and like to consume products with claims of low-fat\ningredients. They, thus, associate healthy eating to mean con-\ntrol over calorie and fat intake. They might even feel guilty if\nthey discovered that they made an unhealthy choice. This\nself-image factor is named as weight conscious.\nSelf-Image Factor 3\nThis self-image identified itself with those who considered\nthemselves as very brand conscious in choosing products\nlabeled healthy. They do not prefer generic products and\nneed the assurance of a known brand name. They are also\nunlikely to feel comfortable trying new and unfamiliar\nbrands or unbranded food products that make health claims.\nThey are brand loyal and may sometimes even choose\nunhealthy products and purchase their preferred brand\ninstead. This factor was labeled the brand conscious.\nSelf-Image Factor 4\nThis factor represents those who are very price conscious\nand choose brands that are not expensive. They also trust\nadvertising. The two factors combine to indicate that their\nchoice of healthy labeled products depends on whether such\nbrands are well advertised and have a low price. They are\nunlikely to use unfamiliar brands of healthy labeled food or\nitems that are expensive. They are also brand conscious to\nthe extent that they may not try unbranded products even if\nthey promise a health benefit and are inexpensive. This fac-\ntor was called the value conscious.\nTable 1. Health Consciousness Scale: Reliability.\nNo. Scale items Squared multiple correlation Cronbach's alpha if item deleted\n9.

KMO = Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin.\n8 SAGE Open\nSelf-Image Factor 5\nThis factor consists of those who like to try new brands and\nare more open to experimenting with them. They are the\nearly adopters of food products that are new that may or may\nnot carry a health benefit. They focus more on the experi-\nences they have with brands rather than seek assurance from\nwell-known brands. They are likely to try new unknown food\nitems, which makes them least brand loyal, but they might\nchoose products that are not healthy. This factor is labeled\nvariety conscious.\nThus, the results indicated that there were at least five dif-\nferent self-image factors that could explain the health con-\nscious self-image held by consumers of healthy products.\nConsumers perceive themselves differently even on health\nconsciousness, and are likely to differ on the basis of how\nstrongly they associate themselves on the health conscious-\nness continuum. They are likely to have different expecta-\ntions from healthy labeled foods and choose different types\nof labels that describe healthy foods. The next section identi-\nfies whether specific demographic factors were associated\nwith the different self-image factors identified thus far.\nSelf-Image Factors and Demographics\nIt was assumed that every health conscious consumer would\ndisplay a similar behavior toward healthy labeled foods and\nthat such consumers would share similar demographics.\nBecause the self-images of health conscious consumers were\nfound to be different, it was of interest to identify whether the\nfactors representing different self-images related to same or\ndifferent demographics. The following demographics--age,\ngender, marital status, and level of education--were studied.\nThus, sub-hypotheses for our second hypothesis were devel-\noped. It was hypothesized that,\nHypothesis 2a: Consumers choosing different self-image\nfactors are likely to differ on account of age.\nHypothesis 2b: Consumers choosing different self-image\nfactors are likely to differ on account of gender.\nHypothesis 2c: Consumers choosing different self-image\nfactors are likely to differ on account of education.\nHypothesis 2d: Consumers choosing different self-image\nfactors are likely to differ on the basis of their relationship\nstatus.\nThe results of the analysis are presented below.\nRelationship Between Self-Image Factors and Age\nRespondents were classified into five age groups. To under-\nstand the relationship between the different self-image fac-\ntors and age groups, an ANOVA was conducted. The F test\nwas applied to test the significance of differences between\ntwo variances: the among group variance and the between\ngroup variance. Significant F values indicate that the means\nare significantly different from one another.\nThe results showed significant relationships between\nself-image and age for the health conscious, F(4, 356) =\nsignificant relationship was found between the brand and\nvariety conscious self-image factors and age. The descrip-\ntive for self-image factors and significant age groups are\nsummarized in Table 4.\nTable 3. Rotated Component Matrix.\nComponent\nNote. Extraction method: principal component analysis.

Rotation converged in nine iterations.\nHanspal and Devasagayam 9\nThe Tukey\u00adKramer multiple comparison of means was\nemployed to understand whether the differences between the\nmeans pertaining to age groups were significant (Table 5).\nThe results reveal that for the health conscious self-image,\nas compared with the age group of 18 to 22 years, there was\na highly significant mean difference for the age group of 41\npared with the age group of 23 to 30 years, there was a highly\nsignificant mean difference for the age group of 41 to 49\nences were not significant for the 50+ age group. In other\nwords, the age group of 41 to 49 years was different in their\nself-image of health consciousness both from the 18 to 22\nyears and 23 to 30 years age groups. Considering the means\nand standard deviations (Table 4), we see that the highest\nmean for health conscious self-image was for the age group\nFor the weight conscious self-image, as compared with\nthe age group of 18 to 22 years, there was a highly signifi-\ncant mean difference for the age groups of 31 to 40 years\ndifference = 0.48, sig. = .009).

Considering the\ndescriptives (Table 4), we see that the highest mean for\nweight conscious self-image was for the age group of 31 to\nFor the value conscious self-image, as compared with the\n18 to 22 age group, the mean differences were highly signifi-\ncant for the age groups of 41 to 50 years (M difference =\n.004). The differences were not significant for the age groups\nshow that the highest mean for value conscious self-image\nThus, the findings suggest that there are differing self-\nimage perceptions among age groups on the health, weight,\nand value conscious factors.At a younger age, the consumers\nare still not financially independent and have limited means.\nFurthermore, their anxiety about health and weight is spurred\nby their desire to look attractive as they join college, look for\npartners, or enter the job market. The concerns around weight\nstart changing around middle age, when career and familial\nresponsibilities take precedence over maintaining the normal\nphysical exercise routine. These responsibilities also moti-\nvate the consumers in the above 40 years age group to obtain\nmore value in their brand choice. Furthermore, the percep-\ntions of an ideal or acceptable weight might be different for\npeople belonging to diverse age groups, differences in height,\nand gender. Thus, within the broad category of weight con-\nscious consumers supporting a self-image of health con-\nsciousness, the choices may be different.\nAs consumers age, they are likely to seek more value in\ntheir purchases of healthy labeled products. Students and\nyounger consumers are able to settle down financially by age\n30. Their choice of healthy labeled food may not necessarily\nbe dictated by the value they obtain from such foods as they\ncelebrate their new-found financial independence and, at the\nsame time, start their own families. The senior consumers,\nhowever, may seek more value in their purchases as they\nTable 4.

No significant differ-\nences were found for self-image groups of brand conscious\nor variety conscious factors on the basis of age.\nRelationship Between Self-Image Factors and\nGender\nThe sample consisted of 95 men and 266 women. Because\ngender influences the consumption of some products, it was\nimportant to identify whether it influenced the consumption\nof products labeled \"healthy.\"\nA cross tabulation by gender for the self-image variables\nwas conducted to understand whether there were significant\ndifferences among men and women in how they perceived\nthemselves with regard to health consciousness. The results\nare presented in Table 6.\nThe results reveal that the gender differences in self-\nimage factors are significant among men and women for the\nweight, brand, and variety conscious self-image factors.\nAlthough both genders are weight and brand conscious in\ntheir self-image, men appear to be more weight, brand, and\nvariety conscious as compared with women. There are no\nsignificant differences among men and women on the health\nand value conscious self-image. While previous research\nwomen were more health conscious than men, this study\nreveals that men are becoming more weight, brand, and vari-\nety conscious in their selection of healthy labeled foods. This\nchange could probably be explained with changing socio-\ndemographic environment where more and more men are\nchoosing to remain single, or engaged in building a body or\nare staying at home to take care of kids and, in this process,\nimprove the quality of diet consumed by them. Because more\nwomen are choosing to go out to work, they are unable to\nmaintain the consumption of healthy foods due to time con-\nstraints and, therefore, may not be able to necessarily choose\nhealthy labeled food that might help them influence their\nweight or to find time to purchase branded items. They may\nalso be more brand loyal than men because the relationship\nwith the variety conscious self-image was not significant.\nThe results are supported by the study conducted by Gram\nand Blichfeldt (2014), which found that despite the fact that\nfemale students were more health conscious, their actual\nconsumption of food was becoming more unhealthy due to\nlack of time and energy and work pressure.\nSelf-Image Factors and Relationship\nStatus\nThe respondents were asked to select any one of the follow-\ning to describe their relationship status--single, in a relation-\nship, married, divorced, separated, and widowed. Because\nthe responses in the two categories divorced and widowed\nwere very few, they were merged in the category of single.\nOnly three categories were, therefore, used for further analy-\nsis--single, in a relationship, and married.\nTo understand the relationship between the self-image\nfactors and relationship status, we computed ANOVA. The\nresults for ANOVA for the self-image factors showed a sig-\nnificant relationship between the relationship status and self-\nand a highly significant relationship with the value con-\nrelationship between the self-images of health, brand, and\nvariety conscious consumers and relationship status. The\ndescriptives are presented in Table 7.\nTukey\u00adKramers' multiple comparison of means revealed\nthat there were significant differences between the married\nrespondents and those who were either single or in a relation-\nship with regard to the weight and value conscious self-\nimage factors (Table 8).\nAs compared with singles, the married respondents are\nlikely to significantly differ in their weight conscious self-\nimage (M difference = 0.33, sig. = .02), value consciousness\nself-image from both singles (M difference = 0.37, sig. = .01),\nand those in a relationship (M difference = 0.32, sig. = 03). The\ndescriptives in case of the weight conscious self-image were\nTable 7. Descriptives for Self-Image and Relationship Status.\nSelf-image factor Marital status N M SD\nWeight\nconscious\nValue\nconscious\nHanspal and Devasagayam 11\nhigher for singles (M = 0.18, SD = 1.06) as compared with mar-\nried respondents (M = 0.15, SD = 0.95). In case of value con-\nscious self-image, the married enjoyed a higher mean value (M\nThe results appear to be true as singles are more con-\ncerned about their weight, looking forward to getting into\nrelationships, to look more physically appealing as compared\nwith the married who become more accepting of their own or\npartner's weight gain. Furthermore, the married respondents\nare the most value conscious as they deal with marital and\nfamilial responsibilities, and the desire to save.\nSelf-Image and Education\nThe respondents reported the following educational qualifi-\ncations: high school diploma, freshman, sophomore, junior,\nsenior, bachelor's degree completed, and master's degree\ncompleted. ANOVA was employed to identify the relation-\nship between self-image factors and education. The results\nrevealed that there was a highly significant relationship\n.001, and education. No other self-image was found to have\na significant relationship with education. The descriptives\nfor the weight conscious self-image are reported in Table 9.\nTo ascertain which educational groups differed on this\nself-image factor, the Tukey\u00adKramer's multiple comparison\nof means test was conducted (Table 10).\nThe analysis showed that there were highly significant dif-\nferences in the means for graduates in their self-image about\nweight consciousness relative to freshmen (M difference =\ndescriptives for the self-image and education revealed that the\nrespondents with a master's degree (M = 0.50, SD = 0.71) had\nthe highest mean value followed by sophomores (M = 0.36,\n= 0.12, SD = 1.03). This implies that consumers at different\neducational levels assign a different meaning to what they\nperceive as being weight conscious. As consumers get more\neducated, their self-image with regard to what weight they\nconsider as healthy also changes. Thus, people subscribing to\ndifferent self-image factors differ on account of demograph-\nics. Next, we explore the relationship between the self-image\nfactors identified above and preferences for actual consump-\ntion of healthy foods when the consumers were hungry.\nConsumer Behavior: Preference for\nHealthy Foods When Hungry\nData were collected on whether the respondents preferred to\nconsume products that were \"healthy,\" \"not healthy,\" or had\n\"no preference\" for either when they were hungry. ANOVA\nwas conducted to identify relationship between the self-\nimage factors identified above and the consumption prefer-\nences of consumers when they were hungry. The results\nreveal that the differences were highly significant for four\ncant for the value conscious self-image factor.\nTo identify which of the self-image groups were signifi-\ncantly different on account of preference for healthy labeled\nfoods, Tukey\u00adKramers' multiple comparison of means was\nemployed (Table 11).\nTable 8.

A\nlook at the descriptives (Table 12) revealed that those who\nhad no preferences (M = 0.19, SD = 1) had a higher mean\nTable 11.

The descriptives for the variety conscious\nrevealed the highest mean for those who chose unhealthy\nare likely to choose unhealthy options as well. The relation-\nships were not significant for the value conscious consumers\nand they may focus more on price/value rather than the\nhealth benefit. These results show that some consumers may\nnot actually conduct themselves in a way that supports their\nself-image.\nConclusion and Implications\nThus, the research shows that consumers with a self-image\nof health consciousness differ in how they see themselves\nwith regard to both their image and the preference for healthy\nlabeled products. The study identified five different self-\nimage factors: the health conscious, weight conscious, brand\nconscious, value conscious, and the variety conscious. The\ndifferences in self-image are likely to influence what the\nlabel \"healthy\" means to each of the self-image groups and\nthe preference for healthy labeled products. Marketers will\nneed to understand these differences and design their prod-\nucts, advertising, and communication strategies to appeal to\nthese different segments\nFurthermore, the self-image factors have particular rela-\ntionships with the different demographic variables (Table 13).\nWe found significant relationships between the self-image\nfactors and age, gender, relationship status, and education.\nFor example, consumers who held the health conscious self-\nimage differed on account of age, and the age groups of 18 to\nyears old, and from 31- to 39-year-old consumers with a\nweight conscious self-image. In terms of value conscious-\nness, 18- to 22-year-old consumers differed significantly\nsignificantly from 41 to 49 years of age. Thus, the meaning\nof a healthy self-image changed with age. The same advertis-\ning appeals will, therefore, not work with all consumers.\nGender was found to be having a significant relationship\nwith the different self-image variables. Both men and women\nwere more likely to be holding the image of health and\nweight consciousness, but compared with women, men were\nmore likely to see themselves as weight, brand, and variety\nconscious. These results do not seem to support previous\nresearch findings, which concluded that women are often\nmore responsible eaters than their male peers; they tend to\neat more vegetables, less fast food, and drink less alcohol\nthan male students (Beasley, Hackett, & Maxwell, 2004); or\nthat female food consumers seem to experience conflicting\ndesires and practices when consuming food as they are typi-\ncally more concerned with healthy eating (Rasmussen et al.,\n2012), more preoccupied with their weight, and often have a\nhigher consumption of chocolate and other sweets than men\n(Rasmussen et al., 2012). This study, however, sees a rever-\nsal and actually finds that as compared with women, men are\ntaking charge of their own health by consuming a greater\nvariety of healthy labeled foods that help them control weight\ngain and prefer branded products.\nSimilarly, the relationship status influences the self-image\npeople have with regard to the consumption of healthy\nlabeled products. In terms of education, the study found sig-\nnificant differences on the self-image of weight conscious-\nness between the less educated (high school) and those who\nhad undergraduate (and seniors) or graduate qualifications.\nThese results support results from previous research by\nTable 13. Summary of Significant Results.\nDemographic self-image Health Weight Brand Value Variety\nGender X (Men) X (Men) X (Men)\nRelationship status X \n Married \n Single \n In relationship \nEducation X \n Masters \n Sophomore \n Freshman \n Juniors \nPreference for consumption\nPreference options X X X X\n Healthy Unhealthy Healthy Unhealthy\n Unhealthy No Preference No Healthy\n No preference preference \nLeDoux and Vojnovic (2013), which shows that education\nplays an important role in the selection of healthy diets.\nThus, we find the existence of sub-segments of self-\nimages that would require different strategies for marketing\nhealthy products. Not only will they need to be advertised to\ndifferently but the healthy food products and services will\nalso need to be designed, labeled, priced, and packaged dif-\nferently keeping in mind the different meanings the healthy\nself-image holds for different consumers. Brands after all are\nsymbols that consumers choose to express themselves with\nand these findings have important repercussions for how the\nbrands engage with their consumers.\nThe actual preferences of consumers who had a self-\nimage of health, weight, or brand consciousness were found\nto be significantly congruent with their self-images. They\nappeared to choose more products labeled healthy as they did\nnot differ significantly among themselves, but consumers\nwith a self-image of value or variety consciousness were\nmore likely to be different with regard to preferences for\nproducts that were labeled healthy. Marketers need to adopt\nstrategies that emphasize value or variety to attract these seg-\nments of consumers toward the consumption of foods labeled\nhealthy. In addition, these segments require better pricing-\nand value-based offers to attract them to such foods.\nThe strategies to market healthy foods for example to\nthose holding the self-image of being brand conscious will\nrequire building brand awareness and recall and focus on\nbuilding a positive brand image and unique positioning to\nappeal to target consumers. Innovative customer engagement\nstrategies will be required to succeed in the marketplace. To\nattract the value conscious consumers, successful strategies\nwould require assessing the customer lifetime value of con-\nsumers who prefer less expensive healthy foods. The manu-\nfacturers will have to weigh in on benefit of attaining the\nprofits through higher volume versus profits through pre-\nmium pricing. Accompanying these will of course be sepa-\nrate positioning and distribution strategies. There cannot be a\none-size-fits-all approach to marketing products labeled\nhealthy. Evidence has shown that health conscious consum-\ners are more preventive in their general outlook than less\nhealth conscious consumers and that they tend to believe\nmore in the efficacy of actions that can benefit their health\nThis research points out that within the self-image factors\nthat differentiate health conscious consumers, the marketers\nalso need to consider the demographics if they need to better\ntarget their consumers to obtain better sales. There are sub-\nsegments within the broad segments identified by the five\nself-image factors with significantly distinct preferences,\ndemographics, and behavior patterns. Furthermore, even\nthough consumers consider themselves as being health con-\nscious, the actual choice of healthy food products will also be\ninfluenced by value perceptions and variety offered.\nAccording to USDA report by the Economic Research\nService (2015), over the past 30 years, food prices have risen\nfaster than some other consumer goods, such as housing and\ntransportation. Inflation-adjusted (real) prices for poultry\nand dairy products have been stable, while real prices for red\nmeats, eggs, and fresh fruits and vegetables grew by 18%,\nthe same time period, real prices for fats and oils, sugar and\nsweets, and nonalcoholic beverages fell. The price of corn\nfoods, many of which are included in the sugar and sweets\ncategory, are less affected by commodity-level price swings\nand are generally more closely linked to the costs of inputs\nsuch as electricity and wages. Industrial electricity costs and\nmanufacturing wages both increased at a rate about 10%\nlower than overall inflation since 1985. These price trends\nwill further affect the consumption of healthy labeled prod-\nucts as consumer expectations from these products will differ\ndepending upon their self-image. In these times, when mar-\nketers are faced with tough competition and increasing\naccountability on the marketing rate of return, challenges of\nimproving customer relationship and experience manage-\nment, the basic equation of catering to the right consumer\nsegments is becoming more important than ever.\nLimitations and Further Research\nThe data have a limited generalizability having been con-\nfined to the state of New York. The survey may be distributed\nnationwide to ascertain whether additional segments of self-\nimages regarding consumption of healthy products emerge\nor whether there is a replication of these image factors.\nQuestions pertaining to income and occupation need to be\nadded to the survey. There is also a need to look at situational\nfactors that may influence the decision to purchase healthy\nlabeled foods and consumer perceptions of brands that are\navailable to health conscious consumers. Furthermore, there\nis a need to conduct studies on value and variety conscious\nconsumers to identify what strategies could attract these seg-\nments to consciously choosing healthy foods, especially in\nthe light of the fact that the cost of health care is also among\nthe highest in these segments.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAaker, J.
