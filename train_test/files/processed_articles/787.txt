The study investigates the social and demographic, personality and social contact correlates of emotional\nsupport and negative interaction among older Black Americans.\nMethods. The present analyses are based on the responses of 519 older African American respondents (55\u00ad96 years\nold) from the Americans' Changing Lives Survey. Structural equation modeling (e.g., LISREL) was used to estimate the\ndirect and indirect effects of sociodemographic variables (i.e., age, gender, education, income, marital status, and presence\nof children), social contact factors (i.e., frequency of face-to-face and telephone contact), and personality (i.e., extraversion\nand neuroticism) on emotional support and negative interaction with relatives and friends.\nResults. Gender, marital status, and extraversion were significantly associated with emotional support. Age, education,\nmarital status, having a child, and neuroticism were identified as correlates of negative interaction.\nDiscussion. The majority of older Black adults in this sample participated in emotionally supportive relations with\nrelatives and friends, whereas negative social interactions were reported with less frequency. The distinctive group of\npredictors explaining emotional support and negative interaction suggests that they are different social occurrences. This\nanalysis particularly underscores the role of personality factors in these processes.\nTHE social networks and social relationships of older adults\nhave raised fundamental questions in social gerontology\nsince its inception as a field of study (e.g., disengagement and\nactivity theories). Although much of the prior literature is\npredominated by a focus on emotional support among older\nadults (Ingersoll-Dayton, Morgan, & Antonucci, 1997), current\ntheory and research incorporate notions of conflict and other\nnegative occurrences (e.g., criticism or demands) as inevitable\nfeatures of interpersonal relations with family members and\nothers. Emotional support refers to exchanges between in-\ndividuals that involve expressing care and affection, validating\nthe person's worth, and confiding (listening to problems).\nNegative interaction, in contrast, connotes social exchanges\nbetween individuals that are perceived by the recipient as\nnonsupportive, critical, harmful, or otherwise inconsequential\nto their needs (see Lincoln, 2000, for a review). Emotional\nsupport and negative social interactions are important ante-\ncedents to mental health and well-being outcomes (Finch,\nsupport has a beneficial impact on health and well-being,\nwhereas negative interaction (e.g., being too demanding or\ncritical) is detrimental to health. Although negative interaction\noccurs with less frequency than emotional support, it appears to\nbe more important for predicting health and well-being (Finch\nAfrican Americans and Social Interaction\nThe majority of African American elderly people (Barker,\n1986) are involved in strong and viable social support networks\nof immediate and extended family and nonkin associates (e.g.,\nfriends, fictive kin, and church members) and interpersonal\nrelationships that involve exchanges of social support (e.g.,\nemotional support and instrumental aid). However, African\nAmericans are also likely to experience conflictual relations\nwith the members of their support networks. Unfortunately,\nthere is little research on the degree to which older Black adults,\nor minority elderly adults, more generally, are involved in\nunpleasant, conflictual, and other negative interactions with\nfamily and friends. The purpose of this article is to investigate\nthe correlates of emotional support and negative interaction\namong older Black Americans. This analysis utilizes the older\nAfrican American subsample of the Americans' Changing\nLives data set and examines demographic, social contact, and\npersonality factors (extraversion, neuroticism) as correlates of\nemotional support and negative interaction.\nMuch of the literature on the informal support networks\nof African Americans focuses on general support exchanges,\nwith little emphasis on negative social interaction. Further, the\navailable research examines the consequences of emotional\nsupport and negative interaction with respect to health and\nwell-being outcomes in defined groups. For example, Gant and\nOstrow's (1995) study of HIV-positive men found that negative\ninteraction (e.g., feeling misunderstood) with social network\nmembers had a greater impact on measures of mental health\nthan did social support and was highly correlated with tension\nor anxiety, depression, anger or hostility, and loneliness. Stud-\nies of pregnant and parenting adolescent mothers and their re-\nlationship with their parents (Davis & Rhodes, 1994; Davis,\nRhodes, & Hamilton-Leaks, 1997) indicate that adolescents\nwho receive more parental support (i.e., from their own mothers\nand fathers) have lower levels of depression (Davis et al.,\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2003 by The Gerontological Society of America\n1997). In contrast, relationship problems (i.e., negative in-\nteraction) such as disappointment, intrusiveness, and criticism\nare associated with psychological distress (Davis & Rhodes,\nFurther, low parental support and negative interaction with\nfathers is associated with higher levels of depression (Davis\net al., 1997). Despite problems of small and specialized, non-\nprobability samples, this research is a promising initial attempt\nat exploring the impact of negative social interaction on the\nsupportive networks of Black Americans.\nTheoretical Perspectives\nCurrent approaches to examining social networks and\ninteraction in later life (Ajrouch, Antonucci, & Janevic, 2001)\nare increasingly concerned with both emotional support and\nnegative aspects of social interaction. Socioemotional selectiv-\nity theory (Carstensen, 1995; Lang, Saudinger, & Carstensen,\n1998) specifically examines issues of social network size\nand the emotional quality of later life relationships. The theory\nposits that, because of awareness of one's mortality, older\npersons are motivated to pursue social relationships that opti-\nmize short-term goals of emotional gratification, and hence\nthey actively select emotionally ``close'' social partners in lieu\nof individuals who are less intimate. Although socioemotional\nselectivity results in declines in the overall size of the social\nnetwork with advancing age, these networks are characterized\nas emotionally close with high levels of social integration. Com-\nparable findings have been noted elsewhere in the literature\namong samples of the U.S. population (Antonucci & Akiyama,\nAfrican American elderly population (Ajrouch, Antonucci, &\nJanevic, 2001), verifying that small, emotionally close net-\nworks are typical for the very old.\nDemographic and Social Correlates of Emotional\nSupport and Negative Interaction\nFindings for age effects for various dimensions of social net-\nworks (i.e., size, composition, and contact) are generally\nconsistent with socioemotional selectivity theory. Fung, Car-\nstensen, and Lang (2001) found that among both Blacks and\nWhites, older and younger persons report comparable numbers\nof close social partners, but older persons have fewer peripheral\nsocial partners in their social networks. Furthermore, Lansford,\nSherman, and Antonucci (1998) found that, across three age\ncohorts of nationally representative samples of Black and White\nadults, older persons tended to express greater satisfaction with\nthe size of their informal networks, while at the same time they\nreported less frequent contact with networks overall. Compared\nwith Caucasians, African American respondents had smaller\nnetworks with a higher proportion of family members and\nreported more contact with their networks. Taylor and Chatters\n(1986) found that more than a quarter of older Blacks indicated\nthat emotional assistance (e.g., companionship, advice, and\ncomfort) was the most important type of aid received from their\nsupport networks; best friends were important for providing\ncompanionship, whereas church members were important with\nrespect to advice and encouragement. Finally, Johnson and Barer\n(1995) found that although Black and White respondents receive\ncomparable levels of emotional support from children and\ngrandchildren, Blacks are more likely to receive emotional sup-\nport from extended kin.\nIn contrast, several studies involving older African Ameri-\ncans indicate either no age differences in level of contact and\nemotional closeness to extended kin networks (Taylor &\nChatters, 1991) or declines in support from family and church\nadvanced age. With regard to negative interaction, Rook's\n(1984) study of a small sample of elderly widows failed to find\nany differences in negative interaction across a variety of\nindicators, including age. In contrast, other studies indicate that\nage is inversely associated with negative social interaction.\nYounger versus older (mean age of 68.9 vs. 73.6 years) stroke\npatients (Stephens, Kinney, Norris, & Ritchie, 1987), younger\n(Pagel, Erdly, & Becker, 1987), and younger versus older (28\u00ad\ncated more negative interactions with their family and social\nnetworks (i.e., spouse, children, other relatives, and friends).\nFindings for other sociodemographic correlates are less con-\nsistent. With respect to gender, women's greater overall invest-\nment in interpersonal and supportive relationships (so-called\nrelationship work) suggests that they may receive higher levels of\nemotional support relative to men. In contrast, women's greater\nsocial involvement could also mean that they are potentially\nmore vulnerable to experiencing negative aspects of these re-\nlationships. The research evidence is equivocal and indicates\nthat women are more likely than men to report negative inter-\nactions with their social networks (Pagel et al., 1987), Black\nwomen are more likely than Black men to receive support from\nadult children (Mutran, 1985), and older Black women and men\nare equally likely to receive expressive support from extended\nfamily members (Johnson, 1999). Education effects on social\ninteraction indicate that persons with higher levels of education\ntend to receive greater amounts of assistance from family\n(Mutran, 1985), whereas other research indicates that education\nis unrelated to negative interaction (Pagel et al., 1987; Rook,\nMarital and parental statuses represent primary and intimate\npersonal relationships that facilitate feelings of social embed-\ndedness and emotional closeness (Lang et al., 1998). Compo-\nsitional differences in the social networks of elderly adults who\nare married and parents (i.e., as opposed to unmarried and\nchildless) embody greater levels of socioemotional selectivity\nand maximize opportunities for emotionally satisfying relation-\nships. Particular nonmarried statuses (i.e., divorced) may result\nin decreased levels of support from family (Taylor, 1986) and\nchurch networks (Taylor & Chatters, 1986). Further, being\nmarried and a parent provides opportunities for older indi-\nviduals to be engaged in social interaction with others (in\naddition to spouses and children), is a link to other social\n& Chatters, 1986) and church members (Taylor & Chatters,\n1986), and is associated with larger helper networks (Chatters,\nof affective dimensions of family life (Taylor & Chatters,\n1991). Social contact (i.e., telephone and face to face) not only\nprovides opportunities to engage in social interaction with\nfamily and friends but is associated with feelings of emotional\nConversely, social contact is likely diminished for those per-\nsonal relationships that are viewed as being detrimental.\nPersonality Correlates\nExtraversion and neuroticism are two primary dimensions\nof personality that have received considerable attention in\nconnection with social networks and relationships (e.g., Krause\net al., 1990). Extraverts are characterized as individuals who are\ntalkative, warm, and sociable, enjoy the company of others,\nprefer large groups, and actively seek out the opportunity to\nsocialize. These attitudes and behaviors, in turn, create and\nmaintain positive interaction and feedback from others. Extra-\nversion is associated with larger networks, perceptions of\nsupport availability, and a greater propensity for social network\nformation and maintenance (Russell, Booth, Reed, & Laughlin,\n1997). Among older adults, extraversion was associated with\nsocial contact (e.g., visits and contact by phone or letter) with\nfamily and friends (Krause et al., 1990) and larger social\nnetworks (Lang et al., 1998), but it was unrelated to perceptions\nof emotional closeness with the network (Lang et al., 1998). In\ncontrast, persons with high levels of neuroticism are quiet and\nreserved, ineffective interpersonally, feel anxious in social\nsituations, and withdraw or disengage from social interaction.\nNeuroticism is associated with conflictual relationships (Berry,\nWillingham, & Thayer, 2000), lower levels of support (Russell\nnegative interaction (bivariate association).\nThe Proposed Model\nFigure 1 illustrates the conceptual model of the proposed\nrelationships between demographic and family status factors,\npersonality, telephone and face-to-face contact, and emotional\nsupport and negative interaction. The notation used in the model\nis in accordance with that devised by Jo\n\u00a8reskog and So\n\u00a8rbom\n(2001), in which the etas represent the latent or unobserved\nconstructs, the xis represent the latent exogenous constructs, and\nthe psis represent the correlation between the disturbance terms.\nThe disturbance terms in the equation predicting extraversion\nand neuroticism (g1\n) are correlated. This specification\nsuggests that extraversion and neuroticism are two dimensions of\nthe same construct, personality, that may be related in some\nmanner. Similarly, the disturbance terms predicting emotional\nsupport and negative interaction (g5\n) are correlated. This\nspecification suggests that the experience or perception of\nemotional support from network members is related, in some\nmanner, to the negative interaction experienced or perceived.\nCorrelating the disturbance terms in this manner makes it pos-\nsible to consider the potential association between the factors\nwithout specifying a particular causal direction.\nThe proposed model is a reflection of theoretical suggestions\nfrom socioemotional selectivity theory, as well as empirical\nfindings on the personality and sociodemographic correlates of\nsocial relationships. Focusing first on endogenous constructs,\nthe model posits that personality is associated with frequency\nof social contact, emotional support, and negative interaction.\nExtraverted individuals are predicted to have more frequent\ntelephone and face-to-face contact and to receive more emo-\ntional support from network members, whereas the reverse is\nanticipated for those high on neuroticism. Individuals who\nhave more frequent social contact with members of their social\nnetwork, both by means of the telephone and face to face, are\nexpected to report more emotional support and have less neg-\native interaction with network members, whereas the opposite\nis expected for persons with low levels of social contact.\nConsistent with expectations from socioemotional selectivity\ntheory, age status will exhibit a number of specific relationships\nwith social contact and social relationship factors that reflect\nolder persons' tendency to be more selective in their social\nrelations and to maximize these interactions. Accordingly, we\nanticipate that age will be positively associated with emotional\nsupport and inversely related to negative interaction with\nrelatives and friends. However, as noted previously, despite\ngenerally high levels of satisfaction with social networks, older\nrespondents tend to report less frequent contact (Lansford et al.,\n1998). Consequently, we expect that age will also be inversely\nassociated with levels of telephone and face-to-face contact.\nFinally, research in the area of personality suggests that\ndifferences in social networks and relationships may, in part, be\nexplained by basic personality distinctions. In particular, prior\nresearch notes that older persons differ from younger in-\ndividuals with respect to personality characteristics, such that\nolder age is associated with higher levels of extraversion and\nlower levels of neuroticism. The model's inclusion of age status\nand personality factors will provide an estimation of their\nindependent effects on social contact and relationships and\nsome assessment of the validity of the selectivity hypothesis\nwithin the context of individual factors that are known to be\nassociated with social interaction. That is, we can determine, to\nsome extent, whether observed differences in social contacts\nand relationships are attributable to socioemotional selectivity\nprocesses (which are associated with advanced age) or to\ndifferences in personality characteristics (i.e., extraversion or\nneuroticism) that are themselves known to be associated with\nsocial factors (e.g., network size, social contact, and conflict).\nPrevious research suggests that sociodemographic status\nfactors are associated with personality characteristics and are\nimportant in terms of access to social resources and in patterning\nsocial relationships. With respect to gender, women are expected\nto report higher levels of emotional support and negative inter-\naction, and social contact and neuroticism, but lower levels of\nextraversion, as compared with men. Education effects are less\nFigure 1. Proposed measurement model of sociodemographic\nfactors, personality, social contact, emotional support, and negative\ninteraction.\nclear cut, but we anticipate that more education is associated with\nhigher levels of emotional support and social contact but lower\nlevels of neuroticism and negative interaction. Marital and\nparental statuses will be associated with model components in\na similar manner; married persons and parents will demonstrate\nhigher levels of emotional support, social contact, and extra-\nversion and lower levels of negative interaction and neuroti-\ncism. Finally, because interactions with relatives and friends\ncan reflect both beneficial and detrimental aspects, we antici-\npate that emotional support and negative interaction will have\na weak, inverse relationship (Okun & Keith, 1998).\nThis investigation of the correlates of emotional support and\nnegative interaction among older African Americans addresses\nseveral questions in the research literature. First, it examines\ndemographic and social contact factors (e.g., face-to-face and\ntelephone contact) as correlates of emotional support and neg-\native interaction from relatives and friends. Second, it exam-\nines the influence of personality factors (neuroticism and\nextraversion) on emotional support and negative interaction and\nassesses their contribution to social interactions. Third, because\nthe analysis is based on a large subsample of older African\nAmericans from a major national sample, it provides greater\nsociodemographic variability and representativeness of find-\nings. Finally, structural equation modeling techniques are used\nthat provide the opportunity to specify a theoretically driven\ncausal model of these relationships that assesses direct, indirect,\nand total effects of model components.\nMETHODS\nData\nThe Americans' Changing Lives study is a multistage\nstratified probability panel survey of persons 25 years of age\nand older and who live in the coterminous United States. Face-\ncompleted interviews and a response rate of 67%. Blacks and\npersons aged 60 and older were oversampled at a rate twice that\nAfrican American respondents. The present analyses are based\non the responses of 519 African American older respondents\nmately 68% of the respondents are women, 38% are married,\nthe average number of years of education is 8.73 (SD \u00bc 3:89),\nand 67% are parents.\nAnalysis Issues\nTable 1 presents the items used to develop the model\nconstructs depicted in Figure 1. All analyses were conducted\nby using covariance matrices as input and the maximum likeli-\nhood estimator in LISREL 8.51 (Jo\n\u00a8reskog & So\nThe standardized factor loadings and measurement errors (indi-\ncated next to each item) provide information about the psycho-\nmetric properties of the measures.

The data in Table 1 indicate that individual\nfactor loadings were moderate to high in magnitude, ranging\nThere has been much discussion concerning the appropriate\nnumber of indicators for latent constructs. In general, the\nstrategy for selecting items for latent variables involves select-\ning multiple observed variables that reliably and validly de-\nmonstrate good indicators of the construct in question (John &\nBenet-Martinez, 2000). Although there are no rules regarding\nthe appropriate number of indicators per factor, recommenda-\ntions range from 1 to 12 items (Marsh, Hau, Balla, & Grayson,\n1998). Results from the current analyses indicate that the mea-\nsured items have face validity and function within the model as\nwould be theoretically expected (i.e., the hypothesized relations\nconcerning them hold). Given that the items reflect the\nconstruct, they are related to other variables as expected under\nthe theory, and the model fits well, we believe that we are\ntapping the constructs of interest.\nMeasures\nEmotional support and negative interaction. --Two indica-\ntors measuring emotional support from relatives and friends ask\nrespondents the extent to which network members (a) make\nthem feel loved and cared for and (b) are willing to listen\nto them discuss worries or problems. Two indicators of nega-\ntive interaction with relatives and friends assess the extent to\nwhich they (a) make too many demands (e.g., interference\nor demands) and (b) are critical of the respondent and what\nthey do (e.g., criticism or ridicule). Each item has five re-\nsponse categories, ranging from ``not at all'' to ``a great deal,''\nwith a high score corresponding to more emotional sup-\nport or negative interaction.\nFrequency of telephone and face-to-face contact. --One\nindicator measuring frequency of telephone contact asked\nrespondents to indicate how often they talk on the telephone\nwith friends, neighbors, or relatives in a typical week.

Neuroticism was\nmeasured with three indicators that asked respondents to\nindicate the extent to which they (a) consider themselves\nmoody, (b) felt fed up, or (c) were tense or high strung.\nResponse categories for all items were ``no,'' ``sometimes,'' and\n``yes,'' with a higher score on these indicators reflecting high\nlevels of extraversion or neuroticism.\nSociodemographic controls. --All analyses were conducted\nwith the effects of age and education (coded continuously),\ngender (0 \u00bc male; 1 \u00bc female), marital status (0 \u00bc married; 1 \u00bc\nunmarried), and parental status (0 \u00bc no children; 1 \u00bc has\nchildren) taken into account.\nRESULTS\nThe means, standard deviations, and range for the study\nvariables are presented in Table 2.

A significant but weak negative correlation between\nemotional support and negative interaction among relatives and\nfriends (b \u00bc \u00ff:180; p , :05) was observed. An examination of\nthe direct, indirect, and total effects provides a comprehensive\npicture of the process by which the model components are\ninterrelated. Extraversion is positively associated with telephone\ncontact and emotional support (b \u00bc :503; p , :01). Although\nextraversion leads to greater social contact and emotional sup-\nport, there are no mediating relations among these constructs. The\nindirect effect, although statistically significant, is small and\nmay be the result of the effects of other variables that were\nnot included in the model. Neuroticism is related to negative\ninteraction, such that high neuroticism scores are associated with\nnegative interaction with relatives and friends (b \u00bc :421;\np , :01). Table 4 presents the coefficients for the effects of\nexogenous variables on the latent constructs. With respect to age\ndifferences, persons of advanced age are more extraverted\nreport fewer negative interactions (b \u00bc \u00ff:279; p , :01) with\nrelatives and friends, compared with their younger counterparts.\nTable 2.

Compared with men, women\nreport higher levels of neuroticism (b \u00bc :241; p , :01), more\nemotional support (b \u00bc :195; p , :01) from relatives and\nfriends. Although the data indicate a direct effect of gender on\nface-to-face contact (b \u00bc \u00ff:117; p , :05), the total effect is\nreduced to insignificance (b \u00bc \u00ff:054; ns) once the indirect effect\nby means of extraversion is taken into account. Further, the direct\neffect of gender on negative interaction (b \u00bc \u00ff:222; p , :05) is\noffset by its indirect effect by means of neuroticism (b \u00bc :125;\np , :05). Although women report less face-to-face contact and\nfewer negative interactions with relatives and friends, this re-\nlationship is explained, in part, by the higher levels of neuroti-\ncism among women.\nPersons with higher levels of education are more extraverted\nthan their counterparts (b \u00bc :300; p , :001). Education has both\ndirect and indirect effects on telephone contact and emotional\nsupport; higher levels of education are associated with more\ntelephone contact (b \u00bc :221; p , :01), which is due, in part, to\nhigher levels of extraversion (b \u00bc :058; p , :05; indirect effect)\namong older persons with more education. Although education\nhas no direct effect on face-to-face contact, education operates\nthrough extraversion (b \u00bc :123; p , :05; indirect effect) to\naffect the frequency of face-to-face contact (b \u00bc :097; p , :05;\ntotal effect). Older persons with more years of formal education\nalso report lower levels of emotional support from network\nmembers (b \u00bc \u00ff:157; p , :05). However, this direct effect is\nmediated by the indirect effect by means of extraversion\n(b \u00bc :156; p , :01). Thus, the total effect of education on\nemotional support is not significant (b \u00bc \u00ff:001; ns). With\nrespect to education and negative interaction, older African\nAmericans with more education report more negative interaction\nwith relatives and friends, compared with their less educated\nWith respect to marital status, older persons who are\nunmarried are less extraverted (b \u00bc \u00ff:144; p , :05) and report\nless frequent telephone contact with relatives and friends\n(b \u00bc \u00ff:174; p , :01; total effect) than their married counter-\nparts. An indirect effect of marital status on emotional support\nby means of extraversion indicates that unmarried persons\nreport less emotional support from network members, partially\nbecause of their lower levels of extraversion (b \u00bc \u00ff:153;\np , :05; total effect). In addition, marital status is significantly\nrelated to negative interaction, such that unmarried persons\nreport more conflict with relatives and friends (b \u00bc :121;\np , :05; total effect). Finally, respondents who have children\nreport lower levels of negative interaction with relatives and\nfriends (b \u00bc \u00ff:184; p , :05; total effect), compared with those\nwithout children. The squared multiple correlations for the\nstructural equations (the equivalent of R2) indicate that the set\nof factors explain 22.5% of the variance in emotional support\nand 30% of the variance in negative interaction.\nDISCUSSION\nThis investigation found that older Black Americans were\nmore likely to report emotionally supportive, as opposed to\nnegative interactions with relatives and friends. This is consistent\nwith the findings reported by Carstensen (1995) and others\n(Rook, 1984) on Whites. Further, the significant but weak (Okun\n& Keith, 1998) inverse relationship between emotional support\nand negative interaction indicates that these dimensions are not\nindependent and that older African Americans can experience\nboth supportive and conflictual relationships with relatives and\nFigure 2.

The remainder of this section discusses\nthe correlates of emotional support and then turns to a con-\nsideration of the factors associated with negative interaction.\nBecause of space constraints, and because the primary focus here\nis on emotional support and negative interaction, findings related\nto the correlates of personality and social contact (i.e., telephone\nand face-to-face interaction) are not discussed.\nEmotional Support\nEmotional support from relatives and friends was associated\nwith personality, demographic, family status, and social contact\nfactors. Similar to research indicating that extraverts are more\nlikely than nonextraverts to socialize with network members\nsample reported that they were more likely to receive emotional\nsupport from relatives and friends. Neuroticism, in contrast,\nwas unrelated to emotional support from relatives and friends.\nWith regard to social and demographic status factors, age was\nunrelated to reports of emotional support from relatives and\nfriends. Although predictions from socioemotional selectivity\ntheory suggest that age is associated with enhanced support\nresources and positive appraisals of support relationships, it is\nimportant to note that research findings are equivocal as to the\nassociation between age and supportive relationships, noting\ndecreases in support with advanced age (Taylor, 1986). These\ndiscrepancies could be attributed to the different types of\nsupport measures that have been used in previous studies (e.g.,\nsocial network size and relationship quality). Further, the null\nfindings in the present analysis could have resulted from using\na measure in which the focal support group combined relatives\nand friends. In other words, socioemotional selectivity pro-\ncesses may operate differentially in relation to specific groups\n(e.g., relatives vs. friends). Additional refinements in measure-\nment may clarify both the relevant social support dimensions\n(i.e., network size and relationship quality) and the focal groups\n(i.e., kin vs. nonkin) involved in socioemotional selectivity\nprocesses. Although socioemotional selectivity theory does not\nfocus on negative interactions, it is noteworthy that advanced\nage was associated with lower levels of reported problematic\ninteractions with relatives and friends, suggesting that selec-\ntivity processes may involve divergent and independent dimen-\nsions of social relations.\nWomen in this study received more emotional support than\ntheir male counterparts, a finding that is consistent with research\nindicating that older Black women have more family and friends\nwho provide emotional assistance (Barker et al., 1998), receive\nsupport from family members more frequently (Taylor, 1985),\nand have a larger pool of available helpers when confronted with\na health problem (Chatters et al., 1985). Taken together, these\nfindings suggest that older women are advantaged with respect to\ninformal support networks (Antonucci, 1994). Persons who are\nnot married were less likely to receive emotional support from\nrelatives and friends than their married counterparts. The finding\nis consistent with that of Lang and colleagues (1998) and others\n(Krause et al., 1990) regarding the importance of social context\n(e.g., availability of nuclear family) for emotional closeness.\nthat in order to compensate for the absence of a spouse, unmarried\nolder Blacks were more likely than their counterparts to rely on\nbroader social networks (i.e., siblings, friends, and neighbors) for\nassistance in the event of illness. Further, the lack of an effect of\nparenthood on emotional support is at odds with socioemotional\nselectivity theory and prior findings that adult children are\nTaylor & Chatters, 1991). In this analysis, parents were no more\nlikely than nonparents to receive emotional support from\nrelatives and friends. As noted previously, discrepancies with\nprior research may reflect differences in the measures of support\n(e.g., potential helpers vs. enacted emotional support), as well as\nthe focal support group (relatives and friends) used. Further, the\npresent analysis specifically examined emotional support,\ngeneral support, which included instrumental assistance (e.g.,\nhelp during illness and financial help) and emotional support.\nNegative Interaction\nConsistent with previous research, neuroticism was signifi-\ncantly related to negative interaction with relatives and friends\n(extraversion wasunrelated to negative interaction). Therelation-\nship between neuroticism and negative interaction may reflect\na complex interpersonal dynamic. Those with high levels of\nneuroticism may respond to ambiguous social situations (e.g.,\ngenerate negative social exchanges. For instance, because they\nare more likely to engage in self-recrimination and doubt and\nto be sensitive to ridicule, those with high levels of neuroticism\nare easily disturbed by awkward social situations and tend to\nperceive social interactions as negative. These reactions, in turn,\nmay create situations that elicit negative interactions with others.\nConsistent with previous findings (e.g., Okun & Keith, 1998;\nadults reported fewer negative interactions with relatives and\nfriends, compared with their younger counterparts. Socioemo-\ntional selectivity theory would predict that because of increasing\nawareness of mortality, the very old actively choose social\nnetworks that emphasize intimate and positive emotional ties\nand reduce contact with peripheral relationships. The current\ninvestigation provided only limited evidence that gender is\nassociated with negative interaction. Although the direct gender\neffect indicated that African American women experienced\nfewer negative interactions than men, this was reduced to in-\nsignificance once neuroticism and telephone and face-to-face\ncontact were taken into account. This finding is supported by the\nwork of others who report no gender differences in exposure to\nnegative interaction (e.g., Pagel et al., 1987; Stephens et al.,\nAlthough previous studies report that education and negative\nthe current findings indicated that older African Americans with\nmore education were more likely to report negative interaction\nwith relatives and friends. This finding is puzzling and suggests\nthat there may be circumstances in which the dynamics of\nsupport exchanges and social interactions within social net-\nworks contribute to negative interactions. For example, persons\nwho have more social and economic resources (e.g., higher\neducational level) and who are often expected to provide\nassistance to others may find that traditional norms governing\nsocial support to network members are burdensome. In these\ninstances, support providers may become overtaxed if asked to\nrepeatedly provide assistance. In addition, unbalanced support\nexchanges (e.g., lack of reciprocity) may generate negative\ninteractions between network members (DiMatteo & Hays,\n1981), including providers' feelings of being unappreciated and\ntaken advantage of and recipients' feelings of indebtedness,\nembarrassment, and being a burden. Additional research into\nthe dynamics of support exchanges may further clarify this\nrelationship. Finally, with respect to marital and parental\nstatuses, older African Americans who were married and had\nchildren experienced fewer negative interactions with members\nof their social network. This finding suggests that these social\nroles confer certain advantages on older adults with respect to\nsupportive exchanges and interactions vis-a\n`-vis their social\nnetworks (Krause et al., 1990). In particular, children are\nreliable sources of social support (Chatters et al., 1986), buffer\nthe adverse effects of negative social interactions with relatives\nand friends (Okun & Keith, 1998), and broker supportive re-\nlationships and social interactions with others (Taylor, 1985,\nmarried is an important correlate of the use of social support in\nlater life.\n1986), the findings indicated that neither face-to-face nor\ntelephone contact directly influenced emotional support or\nnegative interaction among older Black adults. Previous\nmultivariate analyses (Krause et al., 1990) examining person-\nality and social contact factors (combining visits and contact\nby telephone and mail) in relation to emotional support from\nfamily or friends indicated that contact with family predicted\nreceived emotional support, whereas contact with friends and\nsocial extraversion were unrelated to support. Similarly, Lang\nand associates (1998) noted that extraversion is related to social\nnetwork size but not the number of emotionally close re-\nlationships of older adults. In the present study, the significant\neffects for personality factors would seem to indicate that\npersonality, rather than social contact, is of relatively greater\nimportance for determining social interaction. Further in-\nvestigation is needed to clarify the independent effects of\npersonality and social contact factors on discrete measures\nof social networks and relationships. Finally, the pattern of\nfindings in which extraversion predicted emotional support and\nneuroticism predicted negative interaction is worthy of note and\nsuggests that dimensions of personality are domain specific\nwith respect to their effects on social interactions (see Ingersoll-\nDayton et al., 1997). That is to say, elements of personality that\nembody negative traits (i.e., neuroticism) predict negative\nsocial interactions, whereas positive aspects of personality (i.e.,\nextraversion) are associated with positive social interactions.\nStudy Limitations\nAn interpretation of these findings should be considered within\nthe context of the study's strengths and limitations. First, there are\nacknowledged limitations associated with the measures of social\ninteraction available in the Americans' Changing Lives data set.\nAs opposed to source-specific measures of negative interaction\nand emotional support from spouse, children, and parents, this\nanalysis used global measures to assess relationships with\nnonimmediate family members and nonkin (i.e., relatives and\nfriends combined). The use of the source-specific measures\nfocusing on spouse, children, and parents, although providing\nmore discrete information, would have limited sample selection\ncriteria to respondents who are married, have adult children, or\nhave a living parent. These stipulations would have severely\nrestricted sample size and prohibited the use of more rigorous\nstatistical techniques (structural equation modeling) in testing\nthese relationships. The measures assessing interactions with\nrelatives and friends were the most generous with respect\nto sample size considerations, and thus they were preferred for\nthis initial investigation of these issues among older African\nAmericans. Furthermore, given the prominence of extended\nfamily and nonkin relations for supportive exchanges among\nAfrican Americans, it is important to examine these relationships\ninvolving relatives and friends, particularly among older adults.\nThis investigation only assessed two dimensions of person-\nality. Given that the influence of personality on social inter-\nactions among older African Americans has received little\nattention in the literature, it is possible that other personality\ndimensions may be contributing to observed relationships.\nFor example, there is evidence that individuals high in agree-\nableness are more likely to interpret their interactions as less\nconfrontational and perceive their networks as supportive\n(Graziano & Eisenberg, 1997) and that agreeableness is linked\nto positive and negative social interactions in ways similar\nto extraversion and neuroticism (Finch & Graziano, 2001).\nHowever, given the dearth of literature in this area that focuses\non African Americans in general and older Blacks in particular,\nthe current study provides initial empirical evidence that at least\ntwo dimensions of personality are linked to social interaction in\nimportant ways.\nConclusions\nThe present analysis found that factors associated with\nemotional support and negative interaction were distinct. Future\nresearch should continue this line of investigation in distin-\nguishing between the correlates of emotional support and neg-\native interaction and, further, identify particular factors (e.g.,\nintense support needs or poverty status) that potentially expose\nolder adults to negative interactions with social networks.\nDespite the several innovations used in this study, the model\ntested is preliminary and in need of elaboration. Further investi-\ngations of the proposed relationships should consider other\nsources (e.g., spouse or children) and types of social support\n(e.g., instrumental assistance) and negative interaction (e.g.,\nmanipulation), as well as other important factors related to\nsocial interaction, such as stressful events.\nInvestigations of this sort will help us to more fully under-\nstand the processes that influence social support and negative\ninteraction with the social networks of older African Americans.\n"
