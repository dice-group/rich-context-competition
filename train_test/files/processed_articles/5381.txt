    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the United States, 70% of all non-arrest domestic violence (DV) police investigations are rejected by prosecutors. Using\nDV investigation data, the routine work habits of two groups of police officers were compared across six measures. Cases\nsubmitted by routinely lower effort (RLE) officers are rejected 270% more often, sustaining an average of 4.00 criticisms each,\ncompared to 2.21 for routinely greater effort (RGE) officers. RLE officers submit ambiguous investigations (58% v. 0%), and\ncases with insufficient evidence (74% vs. 36%). The Proficiency Score (P Score) quantitative monitoring method is presented\nand validated. This method identifies RLE officers, and also specific areas of deficient individual investigative practice in need\nof improvement. With improvement, rates of prosecution and conviction for DV crime should increase substantially.\n",

Nelson1\n Keywords\npolice, domestic violence, prosecutor, investigation, rejection\n2 SAGE Open\nThe academy has failed to comprehensively investigate\nthe how and why of case rejection. As shall be seen, only a\nsmall amount of attention has been paid to a few reasons for\nrejection of cases across a range of aggregated crimes; but, to\ndate, no study has examined the range of reasons that DV\ncases are rejected by prosecutors, upon their presentation by\npolice. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to collect and\nanalyze these data, focused particularly on a search for clues\ninto the origins of \"garbage DV cases.\"\nFirst though, in order to gain a better understanding of why\nprosecutors reject most DV cases, we must examine the infor-\nmation source upon which prosecutors mostly rely when\ndeciding whether to file a DV criminal case, which being the\nwritten report of the first responding police officer (FRPO).\nThe Police Report\nIt is important to understand the heavy dependence of\nreviewing prosecutors upon the FRPO's written report. It is\ntrue, prosecutors may interview the victim, or some of the\nwitnesses, or perhaps have an investigator do more research;\nbut, these subsequent actions follow onto the evidence an\nofficer memorializes in her/his written report. If the FRPO\ndid not interview a neighbor looking through a window, if an\nofficer did not ask about broken table leg, and so forth--then\nthe reviewing prosecutor may not gain actionable knowledge\nthat can be relied upon for decision making or acted upon for\nfurther investigation. The prosecutor responds to the evi-\ndence (s)he is made aware of by the FRPO's report.\nIt should not be assumed that reviewing prosecutors re-\ninvestigate crimes, because generally they do not. When\nprosecutors decide whether to file criminal charges, their pri-\nmary source of information is the report written by the police\nofficer who investigated the crime (Hinds, 1993, p. 87; Levie\nby Stanko (1981) who, as noted, witnessed hundreds of\nprosecutorial reviews of presented police cases: Reports\nwere read, sometimes officers were interviewed, and then the\nreviewing prosecutor filed or rejected a case. Since police\nreports are generally not admissible into evidence due to\nDeise, & Grimm, 2010), it may be their greatest contribution\nto the prosecution of DV criminals is to persuade prosecutors\nto file charges, and to memorialize evidence that prosecutors\ncan utilize during criminal proceedings.\nPolice Reports as Persuasive Argument\nA police officer, in situ, gets a first and perhaps best look at\nthe evidence, and (s)he also gets the first opportunity to ques-\ntion witnesses. If the officer concludes that a crime was com-\nmitted, (s)he composes a written report in which (s)he strings\ntogether a set of facts, telling a story of what (s)he believes\nhappened. It is not unreasonable, it is believed, to view the\npolice officer's report as a particular type of letter, written to\nwhomever the reviewing deputy prosecutor might be,\nattempting to convince her/him that crime was committed,\nand that charges should be filed. Due to the general inadmis-\nsibility of police reports into courtroom evidence, it might be\nmore accurate to reconceptualize police reports as a persua-\nsive argument made by the FRPO to the reviewing prosecu-\ntor, outlining the merits of a criminal case.\nPolice Reports as a Data Warehouse\nIf a criminal complaint is filed, then the police report serves\nas a data warehouse for prosecutors as they organize and\nconduct a criminal case against the defendant(s). The report\nlists contact information for witnesses, and it summarizes the\ntestimony they are likely to provide in the court. The former\nfact helps prosecutors locate witnesses so they can be served\nwith subpoenas to testify, and the latter fact helps prosecutors\nevaluate their potential usefulness to the prosecutorial effort.\nThe report describes evidence that was booked for safekeep-\ning, as well as evidence which may have been left behind\nafter being photographed.5 Descriptions of evidence helps\nprosecutors evaluate its persuasive value, and also when and\nhow to use it. The police report can include spontaneous\nstatements such as \"That'll teach him to keep his damn\nmouth shut\" or \"Next time I'll kill the bitch.\" Spontaneous\nstatements can be strategically employed by prosecutors to\nchallenge the accuracy and truthfulness of testimony by the\nindividual who said them, if their courtroom testimony is\ncontradictory.6 Reports have other benefits as well.\nRelying upon the content of the police report, and some-\ntimes other factors, the reviewing prosecutor considers the\nstrength of the evidence, the general deterrence value a pros-\necution would hold, and the government's enforcement pri-\norities (Weaver, Abramson, Burkoff, & Hancock, 2008).\nThen, (s)he makes a decision about what to do.\nFour Prosecutorial Options\nThe reviewing prosecutor selects one of four options. (S)he\ncan file charges and proceed with a criminal case, or perhaps\nask for additional investigation.7 The prosecutor may also\nelect to place a first time offender in a program where, if (s)\nhe complete a series of requirements and also remains vio-\nlence free for a year, charges will not be filed and thus a\ncriminal record will not be incurred (Garner & Maxwell,\net al., 2008). The final alternative is to reject the case alto-\ngether, this being the fate of most baseline DV investigations\nIf low rates of DV prosecution are unacceptable, and if\none wishes to investigate how rates of prosecution might be\nraised such that more batterers are held accountable to crimi-\nnal law for their actions, a good place to begin such an\ninquiry would seem to be an examination of the stated rea-\nsons for case rejection, as listed by reviewing prosecutors.\nReasons for Case Rejection\nFrom a sparse literature, we learn that prosecutors reject\ninvestigations for multiple specific reasons. Table 1 presents\nseven of them, documented by the NIJ/Forst et al. study,\nalong with their frequencies of use (1982).\nThough it might be reasonable to attribute some amount\nof blame to police for evidence problems, witness problems,\nand violations of due process, an unknown portion of blame\nis undoubtedly due to factors beyond their control. Delving\ninto the genesis of case rejection, which is what the present\nstudy does, can be tricky. One way to try to measure the\namount of prosecutorial potential under police control may\nbe to compare officers whose investigations are routinely\nprosecuted with those who are routinely rejected. It is possi-\nble that these groups may differ on investigative methodol-\nogy, and perhaps, these differences may account for variance\nin rates of prosecution. Only two studies have examined this\npossibility.\nRoutine Investigative Insufficiency\nA year-long study of N = 4,500 police officers at a large\nmunicipal police agency, by the National Institute of Law\nEnforcement and Criminal Justice (NILECJ; Forst et al.,\n1977), showed that more than half of the criminal convictions\nresulted from the work of just 8% of the officers, and that\nmore than half of all felony convictions were the work of\n5.5% of the officers. Even more surprisingly, 46% of the offi-\ncers did not make a single arrest over the course of the entire\nyear. Since about two thirds of the police officers at any\ncounty or city police agency are assigned to patrol duties, the\nremaining assignments--some of which may have lower\npotential for making arrests--cannot explain these findings.8\nThe NILECJ findings were replicated by Forst et al.\n(1982), who went further by distinguishing between two\ngroups of police officers. Ineffective officers stood around at\ncrime scenes \"preserving the scene\" and concluding \"noth-\ning could be done\"; whereas, high conviction rate officers\nsearched for evidence and witnesses. They were also\nobserved to more effectively interrogate suspects and adhere\nto legalities of the investigative process, were more business-\nlike in their procedures, were more persistent, and were bet-\nter at establishing rapport with and trust of witnesses. Ewing\nhas described officers of this type as \"super cops\" (Forst\nPurpose of the Study\nBecause the literature is silent on reasons why prosecutors\nreject DV cases, the primary purpose of this work is to fill\nthat void. The second purpose is to assess the use of proba-\nbility scores (P Scores) to quantitatively sort individual\npolice officers according to their routine use, or non-use, of\nnon-mandatory investigative techniques, drawing upon data\ncollected from each DV crime report they write. It is believed\nthat by separating officers according to their routine DV\ninvestigative habits, we can begin to investigate the origins\nof case rejection. Accordingly then, the third purpose is to\ncompare routinely lower effort (RLE) officers, as measured\nby their lower use of the optional investigative techniques\n(OITs; these are explained further in the \"selection of vari-\nables\" section), and routinely greater effort (RGE) officers,\nwho make greater use of the OITs, on rates of case rejection.\nDoing this comparison may illuminate a relationship between\nwork habits and prosecution rates.\nCriminology of the Study\nThe style and purpose of this study are intended to also serve\nas an appeal to criminologists to re-think the current direc-\ntion and practices of the discipline, and to serve as an exam-\nple of a problem-solving criminology (PSC) that responds to\ndeficiencies in the criminal justice system. Criminologists\nthemselves have identified two problems of great signifi-\ncance with regard to the current practice of criminology:\nLack of impact upon public policy and lack of reach outside\nof the discipline. As Currie (2007) describes,\nDespite its accumulated theoretical and empirical heft, the\ndiscipline of criminology has distressingly little impact on the\ncourse of public policy toward crime and criminal justice . . .\nsignificant changes (are needed) in the inner culture of the\nThis lack of practical helpfulness might have its origins,\nat least partially, in what seems to be an excessive and pre-\ndominant focus upon theoretical explanations, and a search\nfor meaning regarding crime, the transmission and acquisi-\ntion of criminal practice, differences in crime and victimiza-\ntion rates between different groups, and so on. Though\nmeaning is illuminating, and the ability to predict\nTable 1.

They were weighted for\nthe total number of criminal investigations submitted to prosecutors, per\nstudy site (n = 8 cities). Slightly more than 27% of the investigations were\nrejected at screening. Rates of rejection were adjusted to the 100 scale\n4 SAGE Open\nsuccessfully is respectable, neither type of explanation\ndirectly contributes useful methods for fixing current prob-\nlems in the criminal justice system or society. Thus, PSC\nincorporates, fundamentally in its conception and design, the\ngoal of using empirical methods to solve practical problems\nand to impact public policy. However, even if problems are\nsolved, a second obstacle still exists, such that validated\nsolutions may remain hidden from the public and from crimi-\nnal justice practitioners.\nChancer and McLaughlin (2007) describe the second\nproblem as follows:\nCriminologists have had to confront the embarrassing fact that\nin a society saturated with \"crime talk,\" they have (the) utmost\ndifficulty in communicating with politicians, policy makers,\nprofessionals and the public. (p. 157)\nOne reason may be that traditional criminology journals\ntend to exist behind pay-walls, making them mostly inacces-\nsible to criminal justice professionals. With download fees\nfrom about US$25 to US$40,9 it is easy to see why chiefs of\npolice, police academy trainers, sergeants and lieutenants\nand other police supervisors, prosecutors, judges, and so on\nmight not be able to access, and thus put to use findings from\nthe criminological study. However, there is a potential solu-\ntion to this problem as well. In the last decade, a new type of\njournal has been gaining steady traction among academics,\nsuch that even major publishing houses are now offering\nthem: the peer-reviewed, open-access journal. In addition to\nplacing scholarly work in the hands of the public, for free, a\nnumber of studies have shown that publishing in journals of\nthis type leads to greater citation of one's work (Antelman,\ncitation counts are of less importance to PSC, because they\nare a measure of the use of one's material by fellow scholars.\nPSC is primarily concerned about its availability to non-aca-\ndemic practitioners. Thus, a measure of greater importance\nwould be rates of download.As noted by Davis (2011), open-\naccess articles are downloaded significantly more often,\nreaching a broader audience.\nPSC, as it is proposed herein, responds to identified crimi-\nnal justice shortcomings by employing the methods of crimi-\nnology to seek empirically validated answers, and by making\nthose findings available to criminal justice practitioners by\npresenting them in open-access journals. Undoubtedly, these\nsolutions will ruffle the feathers of a few traditionalists.\nDoing so is not the intention of this work. It is hoped that\ncriminologists will maintain an open mind, and consider the\nevidence and arguments in support of PSC. Just as the field\nof physics contains theoretical and applied scholarship, so\nalso it is hoped and believed that the practice of criminology\nis large enough to welcome another form of practice into this\nimportant work. Like physics, where theoretical and applied\nforms can both gain useful material from the work of the\nother, so also it is believed that the phenomenological\ndescriptions, as well as the quantitative empirical work of\nPSC, can provide much rich material for theoretical consid-\nerations and proposition of meaning by others. And, con-\nversely, prior traditional work is an excellent source to\nconsult when searching for prescient problems in the crimi-\nnal justice system. It is believed that traditional criminolo-\ngists should welcome the practice of PSC.\nChanges in the manner of journal article production\nare inevitable, when a substantially different paradigm\nguides empirical work. That is true for PSC. Changes in\nthe presentation style will be most evident in the tail ends\nof a scholarly paper. A review of the empirical and theo-\nretical literature is replaced with an overview of the crim-\ninal justice problem, and a survey of prior work that\nframes it. The focus of the discussion section is re-pur-\nposed into a forum where potential methods for criminal\njustice practitioners to operationalize validated findings\nare presented. What remains the same are the middle\nparts: the empirical collection of quantitative data, and its\nstatistical analysis and presentation in tables and figures.\nThe present work is intended as an example of how PSC\ncan be put into practice.\nHypothesis\nThe null hypothesis of this study is that there are no differ-\nences between RLE and RGE officers on any of the prosecu-\ntorial outcomes. Two alternative hypotheses are considered.\nThe first is that rates of DV case rejection, by prosecutors,\nwill be significantly greater for RLE officers when compared\nto their RGE counterparts. The second is that the rejected\ninvestigations of RLE officers will sustain significantly more\ncriticism from reviewing prosecutors who reject their inves-\ntigations, when compared to RGE officers.\nMethodology\nWith permission, the author collected 16 types of data from\nN = 1,810 DV investigations, those representing the total\nnumber of DV crime allegations made by police, in the form\nof a written report, for the entire year of 2007. An additional\n242 types of data were collected on each of n = 366 randomly\nselected investigations.10 The police agency where the study\nwas conducted employs several hundred officers and it\nserves a mid-sized city in California. Access to archival data\nwas granted by the chief of police and also the District\nAttorney. All cases were matched at the prosecutor's office\nby using police case numbers. Because both offices use elec-\ntronic records keeping, the problem of searching for paper\nfiles was not encountered. Each investigation/case was\nreviewed in detail, several times, over the course of 2.5 years,\nand all data were coded by the author. Only the FRPO's writ-\nten report was used. The reason is because the interest of this\narticle is to assess the relationship between the work of\nFRPO's and the outcome of criminal case filing. It is possible\nthat other factors also have a bearing upon the decision to\nprosecute, those being left to others to investigate.\nSelection of Variables\nSome components of a police report, when alleging a DV\ncrime, are mandatory and thus will show no variance.11 In\norder to measure performance differences between officers,\none must therefore compare them on variables which are\noptional, because those types of variables are under an indi-\nvidual police officer's control, at least to the extent that a\ngiven circumstance will permit their use. In addition, it\nwould seem important to select variables that are relevant to\nthe criminal justice process and specifically to DV crime. Six\nexplanatory variables fitting these requirements were\nselected for the study. Each has been shown to significantly\nincrease the odds of prosecution for DV crime. They are as\nfollows: obtain an emergency protective order (EPO) 87%,\nobtain photographs 60%, locate additional witnesses 68%,\nfind and arrest the suspect 94%, and list more than one crimi-\nnal charge 284%. Survival analysis demonstrates that the\nslope for a sixth action, completing the written report the\nsame day, is almost vertical at the onset, and it rapidly\ndecreases after just a few days following the investigation,\nmeaning if charges are to be filed the police officers report\nmust reach the prosecutor's office without delay (Nelson,\nsured. The first is whether or not the prosecutor filed crimi-\nnal charges, for a given investigation. The remainder are the\n12 standardized reasons that prosecutors select to character-\nize a rejected investigation, and whether they were used.12\nCalculation of Proficiency Scores\nProficiency scores (P Scores)13 were calculated for each\npolice report in the random sample by assigning a whole\nnumber value of one (1) to each positive occurrence of an\nOIT, with one exception. A value of one (1) was added for\neach crime code listed in the police report. Doing so gives\nthat variable additional weight, which seems reasonable in\nlight of the fact that, as noted, the number of charges has\nsignificantly more influence upon the odds of prosecution.\nBecause at least one crime is always listed in a police report,\nthe range of P Scores is 1. Table 2 lists an example of how\nP Scores are calculated using raw data from two police offi-\ncers, each of whom had n = 4 investigations.\nSegregation of Cases\nOfficers with 3 investigations within the random sample\nwere segregated for a further study (n = 49). Under ideal cir-\ncumstances, the selection threshold would be higher than\nthree cases; however, the diminished group size which natu-\nrally attends random selection limits access to larger amounts\nof any individual's work. P Scores were determined for each\ninvestigation, and from those, average P Score and standard\ndeviation (sd) values were calculated for each officer.\nIf one assumes that average sd is, per officer, a direct mea-\nsure of habit, with small sd indicating closely followed rou-\ntines, then one can use an officer's average sd as a sorting\ncriteria. Among the segregated officers, average sd ranged\nthose, n = 37 officers had an average sd <2.00 (mean\nsd = 1.35). Those officer were partitioned according to indi-\nvidual average P Scores, with n = 9 landing in the high\nP Score range, those officers demonstrating routine greater\neffort; n = 19 in the middle; and n = 10 in the low P Score\nrange, those officers demonstrating routine lower effort. The\nmean sd of the excluded group is 2.38.\nComparison of Measures\nComparison of means and ratios was conducted using one-\ntail z tests. The z test is the appropriate choice because only\ntwo means or two ratios are compared at a time, and because\nTable 2.

It is likely that there are procedural dif-\nferences in other locations; thus, generalizability may be\ndiminished to an unknown extent. However, fundamental\ntechniques for investigating, documenting, and proving DV\ncrime in the United States are contained within bounds estab-\nlished by Constitutional law and also U.S. Supreme Court\ndecisions; and so, it is felt that regional differences will not\nbe large.Also, officers in the present study were not tested on\ntheir knowledge of law and procedure, and more specifically\nattitudes, motivations, and narratives regarding why RLE\nofficers choose to investigate DV crime less thoroughly, and\nwhy RGE officers choose to routinely operationalize the\nOITs with significantly greater frequency.\nResults\nOf the 366 investigations submitted to the prosecutor, 48%\nwere rejected (n = 178). Written reasons for case rejection\nchoosing one or more reasons from the standardized list con-\ntaining 12 categories. An average of 3.01 reasons were listed\nper rejected investigation (sd = 1.84). Table 3 identifies the\nreasons along with their frequency of use.\nAs seen, two thirds of the investigations are labeled \"no\ncase\"--which is, essentially, the twin to Stanko's \"garbage\ncase.\" In the prosecutor's office under study, the \"no case\"\ndesignation is the \"kiss of death,\" meaning, the police depart-\nment should not re-investigate and re-submit the case. It has\nbeen permanently rejected.14 The frequency of \"no case\"\nrejections illuminates why police officers should be investi-\ngatively thorough the first time--odds are, there will not be\na second chance to get it right.\nSlightly more than 50% of the investigations were\ndescribed as having insufficient evidence. This designation\ndoes not mean that a crime did not occur, it just means that\nthere was not enough evidence to prove it happened in a\ncriminal trial.15 These findings indicate that prosecutors want\nmore evidence, more independent witnesses, and more thor-\nough investigations than they are routinely getting from the\npolice. Table 4 compares RLE and RGE officers on rates of\ncase rejection.\nAs the data in Table 4 demonstrate, the rate of case rejec-\ntion for RLE officers is about three magnitudes greater com-\npared to their RGE counterparts16; therefore, the first\nhypothesis is accepted. In addition, as seen, RLE officers\nsustain significantly more criticism from reviewing prosecu-\ntors compared to RGE officers; therefore, the second hypoth-\nesis is accepted as well. In light of the vast difference between\nRLE and RGE officers on rates of case rejection, the results\ndisplayed in Table 5 are not surprising. They are ranked\naccording to the frequency as it applies to RLE officers.\nAs the data demonstrate, there are significant differences\nin 7 of the 10 case rejection reasons actually used by prose-\ncutors. The rejected investigations of RLE officers are seen\nas having a low likelihood of conviction, insufficient or\nambiguous evidence, no witnesses, and possibly represent-\ning acts of self-defense. In two categories, RLE and RGE\nofficer scores are the same, those being further investigation\nneeded, and deminimus conduct.17 Only one case rejection\nreason was directed toward RGE officer investigations more\noften, which being dismissed without a reason being given.\nSometimes that is done to join the charge to another case,\nand sometimes it is done because a first time offender agrees\nto a diversion program. There can be other reasons as well.\nDiscussion\nAs the results demonstrate, prosecutors want understandable\nreports with sufficient evidence, witnesses, and charges.\nWhen they do not get what they need, which is what happens\nwith most reports written by RLE officers, DV investigations\nare rejected. This is not a new finding. The NILECJ in 1974,\nElizabeth Stanko in 1981, and the NIJ/Forst et al. study in\n1982 all described the devastating effect of low effort offi-\ncers upon the likelihood of prosecution; yet, almost four\ndecades later little has changed, at least in regard to rates of\nDV crime prosecution. Perhaps this is because, until now,\nthere has not existed a means by which each DV investiga-\ntion and each police officer could be quantitatively scored\nand subjected to trend analysis. This article aims to correct\nthat deficiency by equipping police supervisors, and others\nprofessionals, with the means to do so.\nOne might suspect that additional training of police is\ncalled for; however, there are at least four reasons that sug-\ngest that police officers, at least in California and probably\nelsewhere in the Western world, are already sufficiently\ntrained and experienced in the operationalization of each of\nthe six OITs. First, police officers are trained in the specifics\nof DV investigation, while they are in the police academy. In\nCalifornia, police recruits are trained on 21 topics related to\nDV crime investigation, those being explained in a 151-page\ntraining manual (California Commission on Police Officer\nis supplemented by a 29-page field investigation guide that\nofficers can consult when organizing a DV investigation\nSecond, rookie police officers cannot matriculate out of\nfield training, until they have repeatedly and sufficiently\ndemonstrated their ability to operationalize hundreds of\npolice skills, including the six OITs. 19Requirements such as\nthese are seen in other states as well (Haarr, 2005; Sun,\nofficers must undergo regularly scheduled refresher training\non DV investigation techniques. In California it is every 2\nyears, with 17 mandated teaching points being required by\nFinally, RLE and RGE officers do not operate in differ-\nent spheres; probability theory insures that their work over-\nlaps regularly. In the case of DV crime, it can be inferred\nthat RLE officers are regularly exposed to the more thor-\nough investigative methods of RGE officers. We know this\nto be likely for at least two reasons. Because of the risk of\ninjury when responding to DV crime, it is routine police\npractice to have two or more officers approach the scene\ntogether (Hirschel, Dean, & Lumb, 1994; Meyer & Carroll,\nprovide protection for RGE officers assigned to investigate\na particular DV crime, and vice versa. Doing so places RLE\nofficers in a position to observe the investigative method of\nRGE officers. Also, the amount of exposure would be even\ngreater when RLE and RGE officers are paired up as a\npatrol team, circumstances where each type of officer\nwould have ample opportunity to observe the work habits\nof the other.\nThe assertion of global investigative competency chal-\nlenges the position that additional training may be needed,\ninstead suggesting what is actually needed is a means by\nwhich RLE officers--who know how to investigate DV\ncrime thoroughly--can be compelled to do so. The global\nargument contends: Every police officer knows how to\nsearch for, locate, and interview witnesses. Finding wit-\nnesses is something police officers do across a wide variety\nof crimes, on a daily basis. So also, every police officer\nknows how to obtain photographs; make a detailed search for\nevidence; call a judge to seek an EPO; and search for and\nfind a suspect for the purposes of obtaining a statement, serv-\ning an EPO, or to make an arrest. Every police officer knows\nhow to ask detailed questions if they want to, of the type\nwhich will elicit important details not only about the present\ncrime(s) but also those in the recent past that are still\nchargeable.\nIf the assertion of global investigative competency is\ncorrect, and at least in California the level of initial, field,\nand follow-up training suggests the supposition may be\ntrue, then so long as one assumes random distribution of\ninvestigative potential--that is, RLE officers are con-\nfronted with an equal amount of potential to operationalize\nthe OITs as are RGE officers--then there seems to be no\nother testable explanation for why RLE officers operation-\nalize the OITs significantly less often, other than by indi-\nvidual choice.\nThere is some evidence in the literature as to the origins\nof low effort policing. The problem can be seen as not only\nendemic to a subset of police officers but also to entire\npolice agencies. A 2005 report by the California State\nAttorney General's office describes how some police orga-\nnizations are known, with regard to DV, to produce \"inade-\nquate investigations.\"\nTable 5.

[Some] of these District Attorney's\nOffices stated that they will reject a case, rather than request\nfurther investigation, if the initial report is inadequate and comes\nfromanagencygenerallythoughttodoinadequateinvestigations.\nIf the findings of Stanko, the NILECJ, and the NIJ/Forst\net al. are to be believed, minimal effort officers may consti-\ntute a substantial portion of the total number of police per-\nsonnel, and if the California State Attorney General is to be\nbelieved, the problem is not only individual but also sys-\ntemic. Thus, resistance to change--that being a mandate to\nalways investigate every DV crime thoroughly--may exist\nat both the individual and organizational levels. Psychologists\nhave amply documented at the individual level, and sociolo-\ngists, economists, political scientists, and anthropologists\nhave documented at the group level how challenging it is to\neffect permanent change of behavior. Thus, to solve the\nproblem of low effort policing of DV crime, much difficult\nwork may lay ahead.\nEarly criticism of this article suggested that it may not be\nappropriate to engage in a corrective discussion of this type:\nOne that recommends specific changes to the methodology\nof individual police officers and also entire police organiza-\ntions. The stated reason was because such a call for change\nbroadens the discussion beyond the scope of the empirical\nfindings presented in this article. In a traditional journal form\nthat would probably be appropriate advice. However, as\nnoted in the \"Criminology of the Study\" section (above), the\npresent work is organized on the practice of a problem-solv-\ning criminology. The key nature of problem solving is to try\nto identify the genesis of a targeted problem, in this case the\nrelationship between low effort policing and low rates of\nprosecution of DV crime, and then to propose solutions to\nthe problem. Thus, it is essential to present potential solu-\ntions in this portion of the article.\nOne solution to the problem of low effort policing will\nundoubtedly be the creation of feedback systems which\ninform street-level police officers about the mistakes and\ninsufficiencies of their work, as seen by reviewing prosecu-\ntors. In the city of the present study, no such system existed\nat the time of data collection. The same is true in many other\nlocales (Forst et al., 1982, p. 34), though some jurisdictions\nhave established prosecutor to police officer feedback sys-\ntems (Smith, Davis, Nickles, & Davies, 2001).\nThe National District Attorneys Association is aware of\nthe problem of low feedback. Highlighting the importance of\nprosecutorial input to police officers, the organization has\nstated \"The prosecutor has a large stake in the training and\nprofessionalization of local law enforcement. Its handling of\na case is often crucial to the prosecutor's success\" (National\nhelp remedy the problem, the NDAA recommends the fol-\n1. Seek to actively improve communication between\nprosecutors and law enforcement.\n2. Implement a communication system which keeps\npolice officers informed about cases they\ninvestigated.\n3. Assist in the training of police officers.\n4. Periodically provide briefings for police officers on\nrecent court decisions, legislation, and changes in the\nrules of criminal procedure.\n5. Request that each law enforcement agency establish\na liaison with their office.\n6. Advise police agencies on investigative policies\nwhich will withstand later judicial inquiry.\nEase of Implementation\nTo summarize, there are three potential solutions that may\nhelp to significantly and substantially increase rates of DV\nprosecution, actionable items that can be operationalized\nwithout delay--it should not be difficult to implement any of\nthem. The first is to compel FRPOs to fully operationalize\nthe best practices method for the investigation of DV crime,\nbecause doing so has been shown to substantially and signifi-\ncantly raise those rates (Nelson, 2013). Second, police agen-\ncies should use the P Score method to monitor the routine\nwork habits of their police officers, with regard to DV crime\ninvestigation. Finally, the NDAA's system of prosecutorial\nfeedback--which is, in essence, a system of teaching--can\nhelp officers advance their investigative skills by telling\nthem, in writing, what they are doing right, what they are\ndoing wrong, and what is missing altogether. Taken together,\nit is believed and predicted that implementation of these\nthree systems should substantially and permanently increase\nrates of DV prosecution and conviction, in jurisdictions\nwhere they are imposed.\nAt the officer level, the only equipment that is required to\nthoroughly investigate DV crime is a pencil and notebook,\nsome paper bags in which to collect evidence and a camera.\nAt the supervisorial level, the only equipment that is needed\nto track P Scores is a notebook or a spreadsheet, and possibly\na calculator. At the prosecutorial level, all that is required for\nfeedback is the means to write a message to an officer, such\nas by email. These are not burdensome methods to imple-\nment; so, arguments of expense and training are seen as\nunpersuasive. Religion, culture, political power, and indi-\nvidual habit are more likely to be the actual obstacles that\ncould prevent full adoption of this program.\nThe use of P Scores is not limited to police supervisors.\nVictims and advocates may find the method to be useful\nwhen evaluating the content of a given police report for\nsufficiency. Police oversight bodies, including Attorney's\ngeneral and state departments of justice, can use aggregated\nP Scores to evaluate the response to DV by agencies they\nmonitor. Government or private sources of grants can use\nP Scores as a means to assess change in the way a police\nagency responds to DV crime. Researchers can use the\nmethod for both within and between assessments of police\nagencies. Police academy instructors can use the method\nwhen grading cadets as they engage DV training scenarios,\nor when they participate in written examinations. Also, the\nP Score method is not limited to American style policing, or\njust to DV crime. Once the validity of additional explanatory\nmeasures is established, the method could be adjusted to fit\nother types of crimes and other types of legal systems as\nwell.\nRecommendations\nPolice agencies and political leaders are encouraged to con-\nsider mandating the use of the best practices model for DV\ninvestigation. It is possible that individual officers may not\nrealize how significantly the OITs impact prosecution rates;\nand so, they should be informed about how important usage\nof those investigative techniques is to a case. Thereafter, offi-\ncers should be required to document, each time they investi-\ngate DV crime, how they attempted to operationalize each of\nthe six OITs. Police agencies should be encouraged to adopt\nP Score monitoring of officers. Minimalist officers identified\nby low aggregated P Scores should be counseled to increase\ntheir use of the OITs, and then monitored for compliance. It\nis felt that those who are unwilling or unable to do so should\nbe, after sufficient warning, discharged from police service\nas unfit.\nThere is a historical reason to believe that implementation\nof these recommendations may produce a substantial and\nlasting increase in the rates of DV prosecution. When DV\narrest was mandated by some states, and strongly encour-\naged by others, what followed was a permanent increase in\nthe rates of DV prosecution for those cases that included an\nAuthor's Note\nThe author requests correspondence from agencies and govern-\nments that implement this program in order to assist in proper\nrecords keeping and documentation, as well as to monitor results.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1.

The other locations were\nCobb Co., Georgia, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Manhattan,\nNew Orleans, and Salt Lake City.\n4. These results were calculated using the data reported in the\nNational Institute of Justice/Forst et al. study.\n 5. Some evidence is difficult to collect, for example, a message\nscrawled upon a wall. In order to collect that evidence, one\nwould be required to cut out that section of the wall, pack-\nage it, and then book it into the agency's evidence room. That\nis a burdensome and destructive proposition. Or, suppose the\nevidence are bruise marks, one cannot preserve an arm just for\nits evidentiary value. Thus, for some types of evidence, police\nofficers can only photograph it, but cannot collect it.\n 6. Unlike ordinary statements, in the United States spontaneous\nstatements are generally admissible in the court, and they can\nbe damning to a defendant or to the witness who said them\n(United States Supreme Court, Michigan v. Bryant, 2011).\n7. Perhaps, the prosecutor might have noticed something in a\nphotograph and wants it looked into, or maybe (s)he wants\nchildren interviewed, and so on.\n 8. This can be confirmed by reviewing organizational charts of\nmunicipal and county police agencies.\n\"domestic violence (DV)\" \"police\" \"investigation\" for the\nbook links were opened.

A fee of\n$25 was seen consistently; however, one SpringerLink article\nwas $40 (Seelau and Seelau, 2005, Journal of Family Violence\nGoogle Scholar had broken links; thus, it was not possible to\ngo to the purchase page even with repeated effort.\n10. These data are constituents of a comprehensive study across\nmany aspects of the criminal justice response to DV crime.\nThey are being reported across a series of papers, each devoted\nto a different aspect of the criminal justice response. The best\npractices method for the investigation of DV is detailed in\n(Nelson, 2013). Other forthcoming papers in this series address\nover- and under-reporting of DV crime by first responding\npolice officers (FRPOs); means by which individual officers,\nand also police agencies as a whole subvert prosecution of DV\ncrime; a detailed examination of post-conviction DV sentenc-\ning; and a model for quantitative monitoring of FRPOs for DV\ninvestigative sufficiency.\n11. Always, at a minimum, an officer must identify a victim, iden-\ntify a suspect, establish that they have a qualifying \"domestic\"\nrelationship, and (s)he must describe how all of the elements\nof at least one DV crime were fulfilled by the actions of the\nsuspect. If any of these components are missing, the crime\nreport is incomplete, and therefore a criminal case cannot be\nprosecuted.\n12. An assumption of a causal relationship between FRPO inves-\ntigative actions and later prosecutorial outcomes is made.\nParsimonious logic, it is believed, favors this assumption.\nThe actions of police always precede the actions of prosecu-\ntors; whereas the opposite is never true. Prosecutors do not\ncome to the scene of a DV crime and advise police officers\nhow to perform their job. Police and prosecutors are separated\nby time, location, agency, and the organizational structure\nof two bureaucracies. Thus, the assumption of causal influ-\nence of police-associated explanatory variables, such as the\nsix optional investigative techniques, seems to be adequately\njustified by the unidirectional and relatively isolated nature\nof the relationship between police and prosecutor during the\nperiod when the FRPO is on the scene, investigating a DV\ncrime.\n14. The reason \"Rejected, do not resubmit\" seems to be reserved\nfor use when a previously rejected police investigation is re-\nworked and re-submitted, and for a second time it is rejected\nby prosecutors.\n15. Recognizing that police can face lawsuit for making up facts\nand falsely accusing people of crime, and they may also\nface criminal prosecution for doing so, the assumption that\nmost rejected investigations represent bone fide DV crime is\nbelieved to be reasonable. In support, we see that the Type I\nerror rate for felony convictions in the United States is quite\n17. Deminimus conduct means the facts as described do not suf-\nficiently meet the definition of a crime. For example, throwing\na wadded up piece of paper at one's romantic or sexual partner,\neven though it may strike his/her, and even though it may have\nbeen done in anger, probably does not constitute battery.\n18. These topics include defining domestic violence, willful inflic-\ntion of corporal injury, criminal threats, stalking, malicious\ndestruction of telephone or electrical lines, battery, spousal\nrape, batterer and victim characteristics, response procedures,\narrest, identifying evidence, victim protection, types of court\norders, victim services, and so forth (California Commission\non Police Officer Standards & Training [POST], 2006).\n19. In California, the Commission on Police Officer Standards and\nTraining establishes and regulates all police training require-\nments. The following link goes to the webpage that contains\nthe details regarding the field training of rookie police officers:\nhttp://www.post.ca.gov/field-training-program-guide.aspx.\n20. These include the duty to respond in a timely manner, the\ncircumstances under which to make an arrest, the nature and\nextent of DV, signs of DV, rights of the victim, investigation\nand documentation, evidence collection, report writing, the\nimpact on children, and so forth.\nReferences\nAntelman, K.
