In human societies, an\nindividual's access to valuable resources does not depend only on physical power but also\non the person's status as the \"owner\" of particular objects (Hobbes, 1651; Hume, 1740;\nLocke, 1689). Human groups determine ownership using intricate property rules that are\nmuch more complex than those observed in non-human animals (Brosnan, 2011). However,\nfor people to respect property, they need to remember who owns which items. Individuals\nare surrounded by numerous objects with different owners. Moreover, people own objects\nthat are physically similar and distinguished only by subtle details such as different\npeople's pens, jackets, bicycles, MacBooks, or Honda Accords. These complexities raise\nMemory for property\nquestions about how people maintain accurate representations of the property relations in\ntheir social groups.\nPrevious studies have found a variety of psychological features that support\npeople's sense of ownership. Research suggests that people show better memory for items\nthey own compared to items owned by other people (Cunningham, Conway, Turk, and van\nCunningham, Conway, and Turk, 2010). People also value the same object more if they\nown it than if they do not, termed the endowment effect (Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler,\n1991; Jones and Brosnan, 2008). To determine ownership, people make inferences using\nrules such as who was first to possess the item (DeScioli and Karpoff, in press; Friedman,\nKanngiesser, Gjersoe, and Hood, 2010), who grants permission to other people to use the\nitem (Neary, Friedman, and Burnstein, 2009), and who was necessary for acquisition of the\nitem (Friedman, 2010). Property transfers such as gift-giving, buying, borrowing, and\nstealing are also characterized by systematic intuitions in children and adults (Blake and\nimplications of ownership, such as the owner's right to destroy their property, begins in\nearly childhood (Rossano, Rakoczy, and Tomasello, 2011). Finally, Constable, Kritikos,\nand Bayliss (2011) found that ownership influences visuomotor processing; participants\nwere more careful when lifting the experimenter's mug, whereas they used more forceful\nmovements to lift their own mug.\nTheories about the functions of property can help understand these empirical\nobservations. Researchers have proposed that the concept of property helps to resolve\nproposals build on Maynard Smith's (1982) classic evolutionary model of resource\ndisputes, which shows that evolution can favor strategies that compete or acquiesce based\non an uncorrelated asymmetry: an asymmetry between disputants that is not correlated with\nphysical power. Maynard Smith examined the case of the bourgeois strategy, in which\nindividuals compete when they have first possession over a resource and they back down\nwhen their counterpart had prior possession. The model shows that by respecting property\nrules, individuals can coordinate their fighting decisions to avoid costly disputes such as\nstubborn standoffs, heated arguments, or violence. Individuals who respect property gain an\nevolutionary advantage over individuals who ignore the rules because they incur less\nfighting costs (Maynard Smith, 1982). DeScioli and Wilson (2011) found empirical support\nfor Maynard Smith's model in an economic game in which participants disputed over\nmonetized resources. When resources were clumped in patches, creating the potential for\ncostly disputes, participants spontaneously developed a prior-possession rule to resolve\nconflicts of interest. In contrast, when resources were distributed uniformly and costly\ndisputes were rare, no property convention was observed.\nFrom the perspective of Maynard Smith's model, property is defined as a particular\nstrategy that uses coordination rules to reduce the costs of disputes. A coordination function\ncan encompass a variety of rules that differ in content and complexity (see also DeScioli\nand Kurzban, 2013). Perhaps the simplest property rule is based on immediate possession\nor physical contact between the individual and the object, and the next simplest rule is\nbased on physical proximity. These two rules have been observed in non-human animals\nMemory for property\nthere is limited evidence in non-human species for more abstract property rules that do not\nrequire co-presence, such as prior possession or invested labor (Brosnan, 2011). A possible\nexception is chimpanzees, which appear to recognize working for a reward as establishing\nownership (Brosnan, 2011). The idea that property functions as a fighting strategy shows a\ncommon thread running from simple possession to the most complex property laws found\nin human societies (DeScioli and Karpoff, in press). Different property rules found in non-\nhuman animals versus humans and in one human culture versus another are all connected\nas instances of a single underlying strategy for reducing fighting costs.\nThe present experiments add to previous research by looking at how people\nremember who owns which objects. If ownership functions to allocate resources, then it is\ncritical for individuals to remember property relations so they can apply ownership\nconventions. Hence, we test the primary hypothesis that people possess enhanced memory\nwhen person-object pairs are characterized by ownership, compared to when the person and\nobject are unrelated. We test this hypothesis both for recall of items, such as remembering\nJohn's scissors and Mary's keys (Experiments 1 and 2), and perceptual details, such as\nremembering John's bicycle as distinct from Mary's bicycle (Experiment 3). Recall for\nitems is required for applying ownership conventions to different types of objects. Recall\nfor perceptual details is required for distinguishing among similar objects. Individuals in a\nsocial group often need to distinguish ownership for objects that share the same category\nand similar appearance such as different people's hammers, baskets, shirts, or wallets.\nMemory for associations, such as owner-to-object, as well as for perceptual details,\nsuch as distinguishing one bicycle from another, are challenging memory tasks because\nthey require a great deal of specificity in memory (Schacter, Gutchess, and Kensinger,\n2009). Although general information often supports the distinction between a familiar item\nand a novel one, memory for associations and details requires accurate binding together of\nseveral pieces of information (e.g., color, orientation, size, owner information) into one\nrepresentation (Chalfonte and Johnson, 1996; Koutstaal and Schacter, 1997). Thus, finding\nthat ownership benefits these aspects of memory would provide strong support for the\nsalience of ownership information.\nFurther, we compare memory for property to other physical and mental relations\nbetween people and objects. These comparisons can clarify the relative strength of memory\nfor property. Also, they can test alternative ideas about how the mind represents property\nrelations. We select comparison cases based on the fundamental distinction between\nphysical versus mental relations, and between desires and beliefs within mental relations\nFor physical relations, we draw on the principle of contact, which is fundamental to\nunderstanding inanimate objects even in young infants (Spelke and Kinzler, 2007).\nSpecifically, we look at bumping interactions in which a person contacts an object. We\nselected bumping rather than terms for contact that could additionally imply mental\nrelations, such as touching or holding, in order to separate physical from mental relations.\nFor mental relations, we select desires and beliefs because they are basic and\ndistinguishable elements of people's understanding of others' minds (Frith and Frith, 2003;\nWe take the general empirical approach that theories about shared psychological\nmechanisms predict similar patterns of cognitive processing such as memory, attention, and\nMemory for property\ninferences (e.g., DeScioli, Asao, and Kurzban, 2012; Spelke and Kinzler, 2007). It is\npossible that the human concept of property is built on simpler concepts such as physical\ncontact and proximity. If people represent ownership as a physical relation, then they will\nshow similar memory abilities for ownership and physical relations. Alternatively, the\nconcept of ownership might be more closely related to mental state representations (Frith\nand Frith, 2003). If ownership is understood as a mental relation, then memory for\nownership will be similar to memory for desires and beliefs.1 We note that these\nhypotheses are about whether ownership is primarily a physical or mental concept rather\nthan about which cues are used to infer ownership in a particular instance (we expect that\ncues of ownership span both physical and mental domains).\nExperiment 1\nIn Experiment 1, we showed participants a sequence of 10 person-object pairs\nbefore administering a surprise associative memory test asking them to match the person's\nface with the object from the previous pairings. Each person was paired with a different\ntype of object. For example, John was paired with scissors and Mary was paired with keys.\nAcross experimental conditions, we varied how the person-object pairs were\ndescribed to participants. To test memory for ownership relations, participants in the\nproperty condition were told that each pair showed a person and an object that they own.\nWe compared performance to the unrelated condition in which participants were told that\neach pair showed a person and an unrelated object. The property hypothesis predicts that\nparticipants would show better memory for person-object pairs when the person was\ndescribed as the owner rather than being unrelated.\nIn three additional conditions, participants were told that the person bumps into the\nobject, wants the object, or is thinking about the object. The physical-relation hypothesis\npredicts that ownership relations will show similar recall to physical relations. The mental-\nrelation hypothesis predicts that ownership relations will show similar recall to desire and\nbelief relations.\nMaterials and Methods\nWe recruited participants online to complete a short study for payment ($0.30)\nusing Amazon's Mechanical Turk website (Buhrmester, Kwang, and Gosling, 2011;\nparticipants who omitted responses or previously participated in a property study, yielding\nParticipants read a short paragraph of general instructions stating that they will view\na series of 10 person-object pairs (see Figure 1). To draw attention to the photos,\nparticipants were asked to write two adjectives for each face and each object before\nproceeding to the next pair on the next page. After completing 10 person-object pairs,\n1 There are of course more complex possibilities. Property concepts could combine, alternate between, or be\nseparate from both physical and mental concepts. Nonetheless, we motivate a simpler dichotomous approach\nbased on previous research showing a fundamental divide between physical and mental concepts (Pinker,\nMemory for property\nparticipants were presented with a surprise associative memory test. The 10 face images\nand names were displayed in a resorted order in the left column and the 10 object images\nand labels were shown in the right column, independently resorted. Participants read:\nIn this section, please try to match the people you previously saw with the objects\nthey were paired with in the previous task. It is ok if you do not remember, just\nmake the best guess you can. We are interested in which pairings were the most\nmemorable and your guesses will help us find out even if you do not remember the\nexact answer.\nParticipants answered which face was previously paired with which object by\nselecting the object label from a drop-down menu next to each face. Chance performance\nAcross conditions, we varied (between-subjects) one sentence in the initial\ninstructions and the headings shown over the person and object photos. In the property\ncondition (n = 56), the instructions described the pairs as \"a person and an object that the\nperson owns.\" In the unrelated condition (n = 57), the pairs were described as \"a person\nand an unrelated object.\" In the bumping condition (n = 52), the pairs were described as \"a\nperson and an object they bumped into.\" In the wanting condition (n = 54), the pairs were\ndescribed as \"a person and an object they want.\" In the thinking condition (n = 54), the\npairs were described as \"a person and an object they are thinking about.\" The headings\nabove the person and object were \"Person\" and then either \"Person's object,\" \"Unrelated\nobject,\" \"Object person bumped into,\" \"Object person wants,\" or \"Object person is\nthinking about\" in each condition, respectively.\nFigure 1. Stimuli showing a person-object pair from the property condition (Experiment 1)\nMemory for property\nResults and Discussion\nFigure 2 shows the results of Experiment 1. Overall, we found a significant effect of\nhypothesis, we compared the property and unrelated conditions. In the unrelated condition,\nparticipants accurately recalled M = 2.95, SD = 2.31 of the 10 person-object pairs. In the\nproperty condition, participants accurately recalled M = 5.41, SD = 2.90 pairs. Consistent\nwith the property hypothesis, recall in the property condition was significantly greater than\nFigure 2. Mean (SE) percent correct on memory task in Experiment 1\nProperty Unrelated Bumping Wanting Thinking\nPercent Correct\nWe next compared property to bumping, wanting, and thinking. We found that\n.01, d = 0.53. In contrast, property did not statistically differ from wanting (M = 5.96, SD =\nThese findings support the hypothesis that people have enhanced memory for\nperson-object pairs characterized by ownership rather than being unrelated. Moreover, the\ndata comparing property to bumping, wanting, and thinking provide evidence that recall for\nproperty relations is better than physical relations and is similar to mental relations.\nExperiment 2\nIn Experiment 2, we repeated the previous experiment with two methodological\nchanges. First, the previous manipulation was subtle (a single sentence and heading). We\naimed to strengthen the manipulation by asking participants to additionally write one\nsentence about each person-object relation. Second, after viewing the person-object pairs,\nparticipants counted backwards for 30 seconds prior to the surprise memory test. This was\ndesigned to reduce recency effects, which could add noise to the recall measures.\nExperiment 2 serves as a replication of Experiment 1 and also tests whether these modified\nmethods will distinguish property from beliefs and desires.\nMemory for property\nMaterials and Methods\nWe recruited participants online to complete a short study for payment ($0.35)\nusing Amazon's Mechanical Turk website. We excluded participants who omitted\nresponses or previously participated in a property study, yielding a final sample of n = 236\nThe procedures and conditions were the same as Experiment 1, with two\nexceptions. First, in addition to writing adjectives for each photo, participants were also\nasked to write one sentence about the person-object relationship in a specified format:\n\"John owns the scissors,\" \"John is unrelated to the scissors,\" etc. Second, after viewing the\n10 person-object pairs, participants entered a brief retention interval of 30 seconds during\nwhich they were instructed to count backwards from 100 by sevens. They typed these\nnumbers into a textbox on their screen. Following the retention interval, participants were\npresented with a surprise memory test.\nResults and Discussion\nOverall, we found a significant effect of condition on memory performance, F(4,\n231) = 2.45, p < .05 (see Figure 3). We compared property and unrelated conditions to test\nthe main hypothesis. In the unrelated condition, participants accurately recalled M = 3.85,\nSD = 2.51 of the 10 person-object pairs. In the property condition, participants accurately\nrecalled M = 5.13, SD = 2.67 pairs. Recall in the property condition was significantly\nare for two-tail tests).\nFigure 3. Mean (SE) percent correct on memory task in Experiment 2\nProperty Unrelated Bumping Wanting Thinking\nPercent Correct\nCompared to a physical relation, the difference between property and bumping (M =\n4.43, SD = 2.69) showed a trend in the predicted direction that was not statistically\nIn sum, these findings largely replicated the pattern observed in Experiment 1, with\nthe exception of a non-significant trend for the property-bumping difference. Recall for\nMemory for property\nproperty was better than for unrelated objects, replicating the main result from Experiment\n1. Also, memory for property did not differ from wanting and thinking, as observed in\nExperiment 1. The absence of a property-bumping difference gives mixed evidence across\nExperiments 1 and 2 for the physical-relation hypothesis.\nExperiment 3\nIn Experiment 3, we examine participants' memory for the details of an object. In\nthe previous two experiments, each person was paired with a different type of object. Thus,\nparticipants could associate people with broad classes of objects such as scissors or keys. In\nExperiment 3, we assessed memory for perceptual details of objects by matching each\nperson with a different exemplar of the same type of object (bicycle). For example, John is\nmatched with one style of bicycle (red color, drop handlebars, etc.) and Mary is matched\nwith another style of bicycle (white color, flat handlebars, etc.). This allows us to test\nwhether people use the details of an object to remember ownership relations.\nExperiment 3 provides a more demanding test of the efficacy of ownership in\nmemory. Remembering item details requires more elaborated memory traces than memory\nfor items in general. Previous work indicates that making ownership-related judgments\nabout oneself or an intimate close other enhances memory for both items and their\nperceptual details (Hamami, Serbun, and Gutchess, 2011; Serbun, Shih, and Gutchess,\n2011). We test whether objects owned by unknown individuals also show enhancements\nfor both item and details.\nParticipants viewed a sequence of 10 person-bike pairs before receiving a surprise\nmemory test asking them to match the person's face with the bike from the previous\npairing. As in the previous studies, we varied whether the pairs were described as property,\nunrelated, bumping, wanting, or thinking. The property hypothesis predicts that participants\nwill show greater recall for details when the pairing is described as property compared to\nunrelated. The physical-relation and mental-relation hypotheses predict that recall\nperformance for ownership will be similar to performance for physical and mental\nrelations, respectively.\nMaterials and Methods\nWe recruited participants online to complete a short study for payment ($0.35)\nusing Amazon's Mechanical Turk. We excluded participants who omitted responses or\npreviously participated in a property study, yielding a final sample of n = 258 participants\nThe procedures and conditions were the same as Experiment 2, with one exception:\nEach object was a different bicycle. On the memory test, the 10 bikes were presented\nalongside an assigned number and participants were asked to match the faces to the number\nof the bike the face was previously paired with.\nResults and Discussion\nOverall, we found a significant effect of condition on memory performance, F(4,\nMemory for property\nremembering details is more difficult than remembering items.

Mean (SE) percent correct on memory task in Experiment 3\nProperty Unrelated Bumping Wanting Thinking\nPercent Correct\nWe also found that memory for property was greater than bumping (M = 2.80, SD =\nIn sum, Experiment 3 found the same pattern for people's recall of object details\nthat was observed for recall of items in Experiments 1 and 2. Memory for property was\nbetter than for unrelated and bumping, and did not differ from the mental states of wanting\nand thinking.\nGeneral Discussion\nIn three experiments, we found that memory for person-object pairs was improved\nwhen the person was described as the owner of the object compared to being unrelated to\nthe object. We observed this effect on two different memory tasks: one assessing memory\nfor items (Experiments 1 and 2) and another assessing memory for perceptual details\n(Experiment 3). These observations illuminate how people distinguish who owns which\nitems as well as how they discriminate among similar possessions such as one person's\nbicycle versus another person's bicycle.\nThese experiments also provide suggestive evidence about how people represent\nproperty. In Experiments 1 and 3, we found greater recall performance for property than for\na basic physical relation of bumping, contradicting the physical-relation hypothesis that\nownership is processed and encoded similar to physical relations; however, this property-\nbumping difference was a non-significant trend in Experiment 2, providing mixed evidence\noverall for the physical-relation hypothesis. For mental relations, memory for property did\nMemory for property\nnot differ from wanting or thinking. These observations support the idea that property is\nconceptualized as a mental relation.\nHowever, there are alternative interpretations of the results for mental and physical\nrelations. First, mental relations such as wanting and thinking might be cues for (current or\nfuture) ownership. Participants might have inferred ownership from people's mental states\nof wanting and thinking, particularly because participants had little other information about\nthe people and objects. In this case, similar memory occurred not because ownership is a\nmental state concept but because cues about mental states activated property concepts.\nSecond, the results might be affected by the presentation of the stimuli as static images\nrather than dynamic events, which could interfere with the processing of physical relations\nmore than mental relations. Third, bumping and thinking might differ in other relevant\nrespects such as bumping potentially being perceived as more transitory than thinking.\nAlthough the present evidence is suggestive, additional tests using different cognitive tasks\nare needed to determine whether property is represented as a mental relation.\nOur results add to previous investigations describing cognitive abilities in adults,\nchildren, and non-human primates that support the sense of ownership (e.g., Brosnan, 2011;\nand Shaw, 2011). The present experiments show a cognitive ability to remember other\npeople's property. This ability can support the functions of ownership by helping people\nremember who owns which items. By tracking ownership status, people can use ownership\nto allocate valuable resources while saving the costs of lengthy debates, hostile arguments,\nPrevious research has shown that people remember objects they own better than\nThis finding is consistent with theories of property because individuals need to remember\nwhich objects they own in order to recognize their privileged access to these items.\nHowever, people also need to remember other people's property in order to avoid\nprovoking an owner's hostility. Consistent with this idea, our results show a memory\nadvantage for other people's property.\nPrevious research has also found improved memory for items and details when\nparticipants made ownership-related judgments (Hamami et al., 2011; Serbun et al., 2011).\nSpecifically, participants decided whether they would buy an item, whether a close other\nwould buy an item, and whether an unknown (but familiar) person would buy an item.\nRecall of the item and its details was better when participants decided about themselves and\na close other, compared to an unknown person. The present experiments build on this\nprevious work by comparing property to non-property relations. The results reveal\nimproved memory for unknown individuals' property when compared to unrelated pairs\nand physical relations.\nAn important limitation of the current studies is that, like many experiments in\ncognitive psychology, the task is stylized and abstract compared to natural environments.\nParticipants were presented with strangers associated with objects in rapid succession. In\nnaturalistic settings, people usually have the benefit of background knowledge about\nfamiliar people and richer interactions with objects. This suggests that in natural situations\nthere might be greater differentiation in memory among ownership, unrelated, physical, and\nmental associations.\nMemory for property\nProperty is a core element of human social life and is also the foundation of\nbe understood as part of a strategy for reducing the costs of disputes over access to\nresources--a strategy that is present in non-human animal species but especially elaborated\nMaynard Smith, 1982; Stake, 2004). Successful performance of ownership strategies\nrequires cognitive abilities for acquiring and organizing relevant information to accurately\ntrack ownership. Future research can continue to investigate ownership strategies to\nuncover the psychological abilities that support people's respect for property.\nReferences\nBlake, P. R., and Harris, P. L.
