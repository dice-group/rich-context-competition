Tercyak, PHD\nDepartments of Oncology and Pediatrics and Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center,\nGeorgetown University Medical Center\nObjective To compare smoking progression in adolescents with and without asthma and to\ncompare their psychosocial risk factors. Methods Participants were 1,507 adolescents with\nasthma and 1,507 healthy matched controls from Waves I and II of the Add Health Project\nassessed at baseline and again 1 to 2 years later at follow-up. Three levels of smoking progression\n(defined as smoking more frequently and/or intensely over time) were identified: (a) Late\nExperimenters (never smokers at baseline, ever smokers at follow-up), (b) Early Experimenters\n(ever smokers at baseline, current/current frequent smokers at follow-up), and (c) Early Smokers\n(current smokers at baseline, current frequent smokers at follow-up). Results Twenty percent\nof adolescents experienced progression in their smoking behavior; those with and without\nasthma were equally likely to progress. Among adolescents who progressed, 37% were Late\nExperimenters, 42% were Early Experimenters, and 21% were Early Smokers. Exposure to\nfriends who smoked was a consistent and powerful social risk factor for smoking progression\namong adolescents with asthma--more so than among adolescents without asthma. This\neffect was intensified among Late Experimenters by the presence of a positive history of parent\nsmoking. Conclusions Findings underscore the importance of addressing cigarette smoking\nbehavior and its social risk factors among adolescents with asthma in both clinical and public\nhealth contexts, during early adolescence, and through research on this topic.\nKey words adolescents; asthma; psychosocial risk factors; smoking.\nCigarette smoking is harmful to all individuals, especially\nthose affected by chronic illness. To date, the pediatric\npsychology literature has largely focused on cigarette\nsmoking behaviors among healthy youth, with scant\nattention paid to youth with chronic conditions. The\nfew studies that have emerged with a focus on youth\nwith illnesses, including asthma (Tercyak, 2003;\nZbikowski, Klesges, Robinson, & Alfano, 2002), diabe-\ntes (Frey, Guthrie, Loveland-Cherry, Park, & Foster,\nsuggest alarming similarities in smoking prevalence\nrates between adolescents with and without chronic\nillnesses.\nRecently, Tercyak (2003) reported on the preva-\nlence of smoking among adolescents with asthma who\ntook part in the National Longitudinal Study of Adoles-\ncent Health (Add Health Project). There, the lifetime\nprevalence of smoking was 56% among adolescents with\nasthma and their prevalence of current smoking was\n20%. No differences were observed between adolescents\nwith and without asthma with respect to lifetime smok-\ning prevalence, though adolescents with asthma were\nmore likely to be current smokers than were their\nhealthy counterparts. Psychosocial risk factors for\nsmoking were highly similar between the two groups,\nand included exposure to family members and friends\nwho smoked, as well as concurrent depression. These\nAll correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Kenneth P.

Adolescent smoking pro-\ngression (defined as smoking more frequently and/or\nintensely over time) has been the subject of a number of\ninvestigations (e.g., Dierker, Avenevoli, Goldberg, &\nden Bree, Whitmer, & Pickworth, 2004). Understanding\nthe behavioral epidemiology of cigarette smoking among\nindividuals with asthma is critical so that more effective\nsmoking prevention and intervention programs can be\ndesigned and implemented. To address this issue, two\nsuccessive waves of Add Health Project data were ana-\nand Wave II data collected at follow-up (1996). (Data\nfor this study were obtained through a contractual\narrangement with the proprietors of the Add Health\nProject Waves I and II data sets.) It was hypothesized\nthat adolescents with asthma would progress in their\nsmoking behavior at a rate similar to their healthy peers.\nFurther, that psychosocial risk factors for smoking identi-\nfied at baseline (exposure to parents' and friends' smok-\ning, depression) would predict smoking progression in\nadolescents with asthma as powerfully as in adolescents\nwithout asthma.\nMethod\nAmong the more than 90,000 adolescents enrolled in the\nAdd Health Project, some 20,000 adolescents and their\nparents completed extensive in-home interviews about\nadolescent health and well-being (Udry & Bearman,\n1998). Taking an hour or more to complete, these inter-\nviews were individually administered in person in ado-\nlescents' homes. Special care was taken to assure\nparticipants that their responses would remain confi-\ndential. For example, on sensitive topics adolescents lis-\ntened to tape-recorded questions and entered their\nanswers directly into a laptop computer.\nParticipants\nWave I\nDuring the Wave I parent in-home interview, parents\nreported on a number of parent- , child- , and family-\nspecific factors, including if the child currently experiences\nthe health problem of asthma or emphysema (yes/no).\nOn the basis of parents' responses to this question,\n2,073 affected adolescents were identified. (The in-\nhome interview did not distinguish between asthma\nand emphysema as different forms of chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease. However, it is assumed that affected\nadolescents were diagnosed with asthma and not emphy-\nsema as emphysema usually develops in adulthood, often\nafter many years of exposure to cigarette smoke and\nother air pollutants.)\nAdolescents included in the control sample were ran-\ndomly selected via a computer program from the Wave I\ndata set after the cases of adolescents with asthma had\nbeen identified. The computer program sought to exactly\nmatch controls to cases on four vital statistics: (a) gender\n(male or female), (b) race (Hispanic, Black or African\nAmerican, Asian, Native American, Other, White), (c) age\n(11\u00ad21 years), and (d) the U.S. census region in which the\nschool the adolescent attended lies (west, midwest, south,\n(99%) could be matched in this manner. Limitations in the\nAdd Health Project data set prevented a complete determi-\nnation of the health status of these individuals, other than\nthat they did not have asthma. However, adolescents with\ndiabetes (n = 78) could be excluded before the selection of\nthe sample of controls as the Wave I in-home parent inter-\nview asked parents to identify whether their adolescent\nwas affected with diabetes.\nWave II\nCases accessioned in the manner described above were\nthen screened to determine whether they also had relevant\ndata (i.e., smoking behavior data) at Wave II. Of the\nscreening item regarding lifetime cigarette use since the\ndate the Wave I interview was conducted. There were no\ndiscernible demographic differences at baseline between\nadolescents who could or could not be included in the\nlongitudinal analysis. Only these 1,507 cases and their\nmatched controls were retained for analysis.\nProcedure\nIn the Add Health Project, the sampling frame included\nall high schools in the United States meeting certain eli-\ngibility criteria (N = 26,666). A systematic random sam-\nple of 80 high schools and 52 middle schools was then\nselected with unequal probability of selection for partici-\npation. Incorporating systematic sampling methods and\nimplicit stratification into the Add Health Project design\nensured that the sample was representative of U.S.\nschools with respect to region of country, urbanicity,\nschool type, ethnicity, and school size. Overall, 79% of\nschools agreed to participate (Resnick et al., 1997).\nMeasures\nThe following variables/scales were extracted/created\nfrom the Waves I and II adolescent in-home interviews\nWave I: Environmental Smoking Exposure\nTwo items assessing resident mother and resident father\nlifetime cigarette smoking (yes/no), and one item assessing\nthe number of best friends who smoke at least one cigarette\nper day (none, one, two, or three), were included in the\nanalysis.\nWave I: Depression Symptoms\nResnick et al. (1997) created a reliable (Cronbach  =\n.86) multi-item scale of psychological distress/depres-\nsion symptoms over the past week for the Add Health\nProject data set. This 19-item 4-point Likert scale (0,\n\"never or rarely\"; 1, \"sometimes\"; 2, \"a lot of the time\";\n3, \"most of the time or all of the time\") is based, in large\npart, on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression\nScale, which is commonly used with adolescents (Myers\n& Winters, 2002); higher item-summed scores indicate\ngreater depression symptoms. Sample items include\n\"You felt depressed\" and \"You felt sad.\" To ease the\ninterpretability of this variable, a median-split procedure\ndetermined those adolescents with depression symp-\ntoms falling at or above the median (\"high\") from those\nwith depression symptoms falling below the median\n(\"low\").\nWaves I and II: Cigarette Smoking\nAdolescent cigarette smoking was assessed by a series of\nstandard epidemiological items regarding the frequency\nand intensity of their smoking behavior/lifetime and cur-\nrent cigarette smoking. These items were \"Have you ever\ntried cigarette smoking, even just one or two few puffs?\"\nand \"During the past 30 days, on how many days did\nyou smoke cigarettes?\"\nFor the purposes of the data analysis, three cigarette\nsmoking dependent variables were created from Wave I:\nlifetime cigarette use (ever tried cigarette smoking, even\none or two puffs), current cigarette use (smoked ciga-\nrettes on 1 or more of the past 30 days), and current fre-\nquent cigarette use (smoked cigarettes on 20 or more of\nthe past 30 days). Definitions for each of these variables\nwere adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System\n(Grunbaum et al., 2004). At Wave II, identical variables\nwere created and analyzed. However, these variables\nwere specific to the frequency and intensity of smoking\nbehaviors that had occurred since the date of the Wave I\ninterview.\nData Analysis\nThe sample's baseline demographic characteristics, and\nsmoking exposure and depression variables (indepen-\ndent psychosocial risk predictor variables) were\ndescribed in univariate fashion, stratified by illness sta-\ntus. Equivalency between the groups of adolescents with\nand without asthma was confirmed with bivariate statis-\ntics. Next, three groups of adolescent cigarette smokers,\ndistinguished by their smoking frequency and intensity,\nwere created. Group I, labeled \"Late Experimenters,\"\nconsisted of adolescents with a negative history of life-\ntime smoking at baseline who progressed to a positive\nlifetime history by follow-up. Group II, labeled \"Early\nExperimenters,\" was comprised of adolescents with a\npositive history of lifetime smoking at baseline who pro-\ngressed to current smoking or current frequent smoking\nby follow-up. And Group III, labeled \"Early Smokers,\"\nwas made up of adolescents who were currently smoking\nat baseline who progressed to current frequent smoking\nat follow-up. Bivariate analyses then tested for differ-\nences in smoking progression (dependent variable)\nbased on the independent variables of interest; those\nwith significant (p < .05) associations with progression\nwere then tested in a multivariate fashion by using logis-\ntic regression. These adjusted equations generate odds\nratios (OR) (with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) esti-\nmating each variable's influence on smoking behavior\nprogression 1 to 2 years later.\nResults\nUnivariate and Bivariate Analyses\n[1.6] years at follow-up). There were no differences in\nthe distributions of gender (51% male), race (54%\nsouth, 17% west) between adolescents with and without\nasthma; their ages at follow-up were also comparable.\nThus, the case-control matching procedure was successful.\nRegarding cigarette smoking, 596 adolescents\n(20%) experienced progression in the frequency and/or\nintensity of their smoking behavior from baseline to fol-\n(58%) were unchanged. Adolescents with and without\nasthma were equally likely to experience progression\n(Table I), regression, or to remain unchanged. Within\nthe group of adolescents who experienced progression,\n219 (37%) fell into Group I and were Late Experimenters,\n252 (42%) fell into Group II and were Early Experi-\nmenters, and 125 (21%) fell into Group III and were\nEarly Smokers.\nSmoking Progression Among Adolescents with Asthma 249\nIndependent Predictor Variables Associated\nwith Smoking Progression\nAnalyses of independent psychosocial risk predictor\nvariables associated with smoking progression are pre-\nsented in Table I and in the text below.\nOf the five variables tested, only exposure to parents\nwho smoked was significantly associated with any level\nof progression among adolescents with asthma; those\nexposed to parents who smoked were 50% more likely\nto progress than were unexposed adolescents. Among\nadolescents without asthma, race and exposure to\nfriends who smoked were associated with any progres-\nsion. Specifically, White adolescents were 40% more\nlikely to progress than were nonWhite adolescents, OR =\nexposed to friends who smoked were almost 50% more\nlikely to progress than were unexposed adolescents, OR =\nAmong Late Experimenters (Group I) with asthma,\nmale adolescents, those exposed to parents who\nsmoked, and those exposed to friends who smoked were\nmore likely to progress. Specifically, males were 82%\nmore likely to progress than females, adolescents\nexposed to parents who smoked were 65% more likely\nto progress, and adolescents exposed to friends who\nsmoked were 63% more likely to progress than were\nadolescents without those exposures. Among Late\nExperimenters (Group I) without asthma, only the effect\nof baseline exposure to friends who smoked was signifi-\nFor both Early Experimenters (Group II) and Early\nSmokers (Group III) with asthma, exposure at baseline\nto friends who smoked was associated with their smok-\ning progression. For Early Experimenters, those with\nfriends' exposure were 92% more likely to progress. For\nEarly Smokers, those with friends' exposure were over 2\ntimes more likely to progress. No variables were associated\nwith smoking progression among adolescents without\nasthma in Groups II and III.\nMultivariate Analysis\nBecause bivariate analyses suggested that more than one\nindependent variable was associated with progression in\nsmoking among Late Experimenters with asthma only, a\nmultiple logistic regression analysis examining the\neffects of exposure to parents and friends who smoked\n(controlling for adolescent gender) was conducted. Both\nmain effects and their interaction term were tested. The\nresults indicated that adolescents with exposure from\nparents were 65% more likely to progress (OR = 1.65,\nsure from friends were 58% more likely to progress (OR =\nexposure to both parents' and friends' smoking were the\nmost likely to progress (p = .01). Unadjusted follow-up\ncontingency tables revealed 10.4% of Late Experiment-\ners progressed when exposed to parent smoking only,\n5.4% progressed when exposed to friends smoking only,\nand 17.4% progressed when exposed to both risk factors\nat baseline.\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study suggest that adolescents with\nasthma were just as likely as adolescents without asthma\nto progress in their smoking behavior over a 1- to 2-year\ninterval beginning in midadolescence. This appeared to\nbe true regardless of whether or not adolescents with\nasthma had a negative or positive lifetime history of\nTable I. Smoking Progression Among Adolescents with Asthma\nPercent smoking progression\nVariable N\nVariable\npresent\nVariable\nGroup I: Adolescents with a negative history of lifetime smoking at baseline who\nprogressed to a positive lifetime history by follow-up (Late Experimenters);\nGroup II: Adolescents with a positive history of lifetime smoking at baseline who\nprogressed to current smoking or current frequent smoking by follow-up (Early\nExperimenters); Group III: Adolescents who were currently smoking at baseline\nwho progressed to current frequent smoking at follow-up (Early Smokers)\nsmoking at baseline, or were currently smoking at baseline.\nFurther, the results indicated that among adolescents\nwith asthma, exposure at the beginning of this interval\nto friends' smoking was a significant and consistent\nsocial risk factor for smoking progression at three differ-\nent levels of personal smoking behavior. This effect was\nintensified at the early stage of smoking experimentation\nby the presence of exposure to parents who smoked.\nThe results are consistent with prior cross-sectional\nwork with adolescents with asthma suggesting social\nfactors such as exposure to smoking among family\nmembers and friends may place adolescents at risk for\nare also consistent with longitudinal research findings\nthat these risk factors exert an influence over time on\nthe uptake and progression of adolescent smoking\nbehavior (Chassin, Presson, Rose, & Sherman, 1996;\nChoi, Pierce, Gilpin, Farkas, & Berry, 1997). This\nstudy's unique contribution is in both the identification\nand replication of exposure to friends' smoking as a\nsocial risk factor for smoking progression among adoles-\ncents with asthma, and its synergistic interaction effect\nwith exposure to parents' smoking on experimentation.\nThis study did not demonstrate any effect of depression\nsymptoms on smoking progression over time. It is\nunclear why social factors predicted cigarette smoking\nmore consistently and powerfully among adolescents\nwith asthma than among adolescents without asthma.\nOne possible explanation as to why this may be the case\ndraws upon previous findings suggesting adolescents\nwith asthma have more positive attitudes toward ciga-\nrettes and smoking, stronger intentions to smoke, and\npositive self-image of smokers (Brook & Shiloh, 1993;\nZbikowski et al., 2002). Another is that adolescents with\nasthma may more readily succumb to social influences,\nincluding offers from friends to smoke, to fit in with\ntheir peer group and avoid stigmatization as being dif-\nferent because of chronic illness (Zbikowski et al.,\nThe results reported should be interpreted in light\nof a few limitations. First, changing patterns in the prev-\nalence of cigarette smoking among U.S. high school stu-\ndents since the time these data were collected in the mid\n1990s may limit the relevance of the findings. Second,\nadolescents' self-reported cigarette smoking status was\nnot independently confirmed via biochemical or other\nmeans and may have been subject to biased reporting.\nSimilarly, parental smoking history was not well detailed\nand it is possible that parents stopped smoking before\nthe adolescent's birth. Third, the Add Health Project offers\nrelatively crude assessments of smoking progression and\ndepression; varying levels of smoking experimentation\nwere not covered and clinical cut-offs for depression are\nunavailable. Finally, complete case ascertainment was\nnot possible at Wave II because of missing data.\nThese limitations notwithstanding, the findings\nunderscore the importance of addressing the problem of\nsmoking among adolescents with asthma. Clinically,\nhealth care providers should routinely screen adoles-\ncents and their parents for tobacco use and offer them\neducation, counseling, and assistance. Overt signs of\nsmoking, such as the smell or presence of cigarettes, are\nalso cues to action for providers. Providers should be\naware of the social influences on adolescent smoking\nprogression too and inquire about smoking among ado-\nlescents' peers. Enhancing self-efficacy may be key,\nalong with providing social skills and cigarette refusal\nskills training, to reduce use and prevent or delay smoking\nprogression among adolescents with asthma (Borrelli\net al., 2002). From a public health standpoint, effective\nways to reach adolescents with asthma or other chronic\nillnesses and deliver and tailor smoking prevention and\ncessation messages to this special population are not\nknown. More research in these contexts seem warranted.\n"
