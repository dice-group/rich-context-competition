Results are reported here from a\nmultistage probability sample of 3,050 Mexican Americans aged 65 and older drawn from a 5-state region. Par-\nticipants reported low levels of education and income, and most reported difficulty in reading or writing in En-\nglish. Deaths, illness of close other, and financial problems were the three most frequent life events, and many\nreported financial strains. Depressive symptoms were then regressed on demographic indicators, cognitive status,\nlinguistic acculturation, social supports, and three types of stressors. Being a woman, lower income, decreased in-\ncome, chronic financial strain, and several health stressors were associated with greater symptomatology. Results\nidentified a cluster of economic stressors and conditions that may play a critical role in the etiology of depressive\nsymptoms in this minority population.\nN this article we report the experiences of a population\nabout whose stress exposure and its consequences little is\nknown: the Mexican American elder. The Hispanic popula-\ntion in general is of interest not only because it constitutes\nthe nation's second largest minority group but also because\nit is exhibiting a growth rate seven times larger than the\ncountry as a whole (Therrien & Ramirez, 2000). Within\nthe broader Hispanic American community, Mexican Amer-\nicans are the largest subgroup: of the 32.8 million Hispanics\nMexican origin and reside primarily in the Southwest (Ther-\nThe need for research on stress and the Mexican Ameri-\ncan elderly population draws from the well-documented re-\nlationship of stress exposure to physical and mental health.\nAs a way of beginning an exploration, this article focuses on\ndepressive symptomatology as an outcome. We chose de-\npressive symptomatology because there is clear evidence of\nan elevated rate of depressive symptoms among older His-\npanics, especially women (e.g., Black, Markides, & Miller,\nLeon & Markides, 1988;), but reasons for the elevation are\nunknown. At the same time there are a wealth of studies\ndemonstrating a detrimental effect of stress exposure upon\nthe depressive symptoms of Anglo-American and other pop-\nulations. The problem of heightened symptom levels, in\nturn, is accentuated by the underutilization of mental health\nservices by middle-aged and older Mexican Americans\n(L\u00f3pez-Aqueres, Kemp, Plopper, Staples, & Brummel-Smith,\nAn enhanced understanding of the relationship of stress ex-\nposure and depression in this population could facilitate the\ndelivery of services if Mexican American elders were found\nto manifest specific and remediable stress vulnerabilities.\nOf course, stress exposure does not occur in a vacuum:\nThe impact of stressors may be modulated by specific con-\nditions. Almost from its inception, stress research placed an\nemphasis on identifying factors associated with the stress\nprocess (Chiriboga & Cutler, 1980). This effort has by and\nlarge been successful, with the result that stress today has\nwell-established general models and measures (Glass, Kasl,\n1995). Common to all models are one or more social stres-\nsors (i.e., life events, chronic stressors, hassles), mediating\nand contextual elements (i.e., adaptive resources), and indi-\ncators of outcome (i.e., physical health, depression). Given\nour focus on stressors, in this article we sought to include as\nmany of these variables as possible, while holding to the\nsingle criterion of depressive symptoms.\nPast research suggests that the influence of stress upon\nfunctioning is robust and transcends culture and race\nthe other hand, there has been a developing interest in how\nstress applies in specific contexts (Turner, Lloyd, & Lloyd,\ndence already exists that specific sociodemographic and cul-\ntural factors help shape both stress exposure and its conse-\nChou & Chi, 2001). As one example, studies of stress and\ndepressive symptomatology have consistently found that\nwomen report higher levels of both stress events and symp-\nAn area of growing interest is the relevance of stress to mi-\nnority populations, especially to their older members. The\nstress context of older minorities groups is relatively unex-\nplored despite the manifest need for this type of research\n(Marsella, Friedman, Gerrity, & Scurfield, 1996). The need\nI\nis underscored by the fact that people from disadvantaged\nbackgrounds may, because of these very disadvantages,\nhave fewer resources with which to cope and adapt (Blan-\nthat among the relatively impoverished Chinese elderly pop-\nulation of Hong Kong, greater financial strain is strongly re-\nlated to depressive symptom expression.\nThere are marked variations in adaptive resources across\nminority populations that render any uniform assessment of\nrisk suspect. In the instance of the Mexican American elder,\nresearch suggests that the extended family is generally more\nextensive and potentially supportive than in mainstream\nAmericans (Markides & Black, 1996; Mendes de Leon &\nMarkides, 1988). Their often robust social resources, how-\never, may be offset by economic problems that are not only\nmore likely among Hispanic groups but that may reduce\ncoping resources and create greater vulnerabilities (Flack et\nbe a major risk factor for many disadvantaged groups. Fer-\nraro and Su (1999) report that such strain was a predictor of\npsychological distress in three of the four Western Pacific\nlocalities they studied. Overall, there is a need for better un-\nderstanding of what constitutes risk factors, and the distri-\nbution of risk factors, for diverse cultural groups (Culbert-\nIn addition to those already mentioned, we included mea-\nsures of two other potential risk factors in the present inves-\ntigation because of their potential relevance to the study\npopulation. Because of a likelihood of cognitive decline in\nthe age groups being studied, we included a measure of cog-\nnitive status. We also included indicators of acculturation\nsince low levels of acculturation have been associated with\ndepression in Mexican American elders (Zamanian, Thack-\nrey, & Starrett, 1992). Whereas the available measures of\nacculturation dealt primarily with just its linguistic aspect,\nthe latter aspect has demonstrated content and predictive va-\nlidity (e.g., Cuellar, Arnold, & Maldonado, 1995; Marin &\nA final point is that although the general relationship of\nstress to health is well established, there is some suggestion\nthat it is now time for the entire paradigm, and its constitu-\nent building blocks, to be reexamined (e.g., Brown, Harris,\n& Hepworth, 1994). Studies of diverse populations may fa-\ncilitate this reexamination process at the same time that they\ngenerate useful information concerning the relationships\namong variables within a specific group. In the present in-\nstance, the availability of a large, five-state probability study\nprovides a unique opportunity for rigorous examination of\nthe applicability of stress measures to an at-risk minority\npopulation. Although our general interest was in beginning\nan assessment of the role of stress for older Mexican Amer-\nicans, we developed five hypotheses on the basis of existing\nliterature: (a) consistent with past research, the level of de-\npressive symptom expression will be relatively high; (b)\nconsistent with past research, women and those with lower\nincomes will be more depressed; (c) because of the influ-\nence of cultural factors, those who are more highly accultur-\nated will demonstrate lower levels of depressive symptoms;\n(d) because of the general robustness of the stress paradigm,\nstressful experiences of all types will be associated with the\nreporting of depressive symptomatology, and (e) because of\nthe marginal economic circumstances of many older Mexi-\ncan Americans, economic stressors will demonstrate the\nstrongest associations.\nMETHODS\nThe Study\nAnalyses drew from the initial wave of a multiwave\npanel study of Mexican American elders. We closely mod-\neled the research design after existing Established Popula-\ntions for Epidemiological Studies of the Elderly (EPESE)\nresearch and included many of the EPESE instruments (c.f.\n1994, we conducted home interviews with an area probabil-\nity multistage sample of 3,050. All participants were aged\n65 or older, noninstitutionalized, and resided in a five-state\nregion that contains the majority of Mexican Americans:\nTexas, California, Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona.\nSampling Frame\nLouis Harris and Associates Poll, Inc. developed and im-\nplemented a multistage area probability sampling frame for\nthe study. As described in detail by Miller, Markides, and\nBlack (1997), we included four stages in sampling proce-\ndures: (a) we selected counties from a complete listing of\ncounties in the five states; (b) we randomly selected 300\ncensus tracts (primary sampling units); (c) we randomly se-\nlected blocks from each census tract; and (d) we conducted\nhouse-to-house surveying, requesting interviews of all Mex-\nican Americans, aged 65 and older. The response rate, at\n86%, approximates the response rate found in the other\nparticipants included in the sample, 2,873 were interviewed\nin person and 177 were interviewed by proxy, either be-\ncause of illness or low cognitive capacity as judged by their\nscore on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).\nConceptual Model\nThe model applied to the cross-sectional data represents a\nrelatively \"no frills\" direct effects approach incorporating\nvariables common to most stress models (e.g., Lazarus &\nvariables appropriate to the study population. Five hierar-\nchical levels of explanatory variables guided the regression\nanalyses, entered by sets according to whether they tapped\npreexisting or stable social characteristics (e.g., age, gender,\nincome), were more or less current, or might act as condi-\ntioning or predisposing factors (e.g., cognitive status, accul-\nturation, supports) for depression. In order of entry, the sets\nincluded: (a) sociodemographic characteristics; (b) cogni-\ntive status; (c) acculturation; (d) social resources and sup-\nports; and (e) three domains of stressors: recent life events,\nchronic strains, and recent health events. The criterion se-\nlected for study was depressive symptomatology, one of the\nmost widely used indicators of stress response (e.g., Anesh-\ndence for heightened levels of depressive symptoms among\nMexican American elders was critical to our selection of\nthis criterion (e.g., Black et al., 1998).\nMeasures\nWhere possible, we drew measures from other EPESE\nstudies, especially the one conducted at Duke University. If\nsuitable measures were not available from the EPESE\nstudies, we drew measures were drawn from the Hispanic\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (HANES) or cre-\nated ones specifically for this study. The measures analyzed\nfor this article represent a subset of those available in the\nlarger study. A Spanish version of the interview schedule\nwas available, and all interviewers were bilingual.\nSociodemographic.--The six items include: (a) age, (b)\ngender, (c) educational attainment (grade level), (d) personal\nincome, (e) work status (fully employed, partially employed,\nnot employed), and (f) marital status (in analyses coded as\npresently married and spouse present vs. all alternatives).\nCognitive status.--We included a Spanish version (Bird,\nof the MMSE (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975), as a\nmeans of assessing the individual's general adaptive capac-\nity. Note that we substituted spelling world (or the Spanish\nequivalent, mundo) backwards for the option of serial sev-\nens subtraction. Scores can range from 0 to 30, with higher\nscores indicating fewer errors. For mainstream American\npopulations, scores from 0 to 17 suggest severe cognitive\nimpairment, 18\u00ad23 indicate mild impairment, and scores\nfrom 24 to 30 indicate probable lack of deficit (Weissman et\nthere is evidence that education can affect the significance\nof scores, no change in the above cutoffs was made in the\npresentation of frequencies. Cronbach's alpha level of inter-\nnal reliability for the present data set was .65.\nAcculturation.--Following the lead of the Hispanic\nHANES, the overall study included 13 acculturation items\ndrawn from the indices of Cuellar, Harris, and Jasso (1980)\nand Hazuda, Stern, and Haffner (1988). The majority of\nitems assessed linguistic acculturation, only one dimension\nof what is generally recognized to be a multidimensional con-\nstruct (e.g., Cuellar, Arnold, & Maldonado, 1995; Keefe &\nthe cultural background of social others. Because several of\nthe items had relatively high levels of missing data as a re-\nsult of vacated or never occupied role status (e.g., language\ncurrently spoken with parents: in most cases the parent was\ndeceased), the present analyses employed only five of the\nlinguistic items and two of the cultural background items.\nIncluded items each had 2% or less missing data, and in-\ncluded self-reports of: (a) how well the respondent (R)\nspoke English, (b) how well the R was able to read English,\n(c) language used with most of R's friends, (d) language\nused at family gatherings, (e) language used with most of\nneighbors, (f) whether neighbors had been primarily Mexi-\ncan American or Anglo American over the life course, and\n(g) whether close friends had been primarily Mexican Ameri-\ncan or Anglo American over the life course. The internal\nreliability for these seven items was high (Cronbach's  \n.91), but we did not include a summary scale in the follow-\ning analyses because we were most concerned with identi-\nfying individual items of significance to stress and depres-\nsion. To round out the breadth of assessment, we included also\ntwo additional indicators (see Cuellar, Arnold, & Maldonado,\n1995) of acculturation: (a) whether the R was born in the\nUnited States or not, and (b) whether the interview was con-\nducted (per participant request) in English or Spanish.\nSocial resources.--Social resources are not only the\nmost commonly studied mediators in stress research, but\nalso represent a construct of particular significance to\nstudies of Mexican Americans because of the generally\nlarger size of the extended family. Given the importance of\nthe overall construct, we included 11 items. Two dealt with\nhow often the R felt he or she could (a) count on some fam-\nily or friends in \"times of trouble\", and (b) talk to some fam-\nily or friends about \"your deepest problems\" (coded from 1\n[most of the time] to 3 [hardly ever]). The remaining nine\nitems dealt with characteristics of the family network. Items\nincluded: (a) how many different family generations lived in\nnumber of living sons and number of living daughters; and\n(4) how many children the R saw at least once a month.\nCronbach's  for the 11 items, at .65, was relatively low. In-\nspection of the zero-order intracorrelations indicated great\nvariation in magnitude, which is not surprising given that we\ndid not intend for the included items to constitute a scale.\nStressors.--Measures representing three different do-\nmains of stressor were included.\n1. Life events. These were 13 acute life events reported by\nthe R as occurring within the past year. Seven items were\nfrom the Duke EPESE (Cornoni-Huntley et al., 1990; see\nalso Holmes & Rahe, 1967): death of a close other, wid-\nowed, illness of close other, finances got worse, change\nin residence, retired, and divorced. We draw six addi-\ntional items from several inventories developed for older\npopulations (e.g., Chiriboga & Cutler, 1980; Murrell, Nor-\nris, & Hutchins, 1984): victim of crime, became caregiver,\nspouse hospitalized, married, separated, moved to USA (a\nsubset of the general question concerning change in resi-\ndence). Note that for one general item (\"Did anyone close\nto you die?\"), we included probes to ascertain relationship\nof the deceased for up to two reported deaths. Because the\ntwo probes elicited reports of more deaths than did the ini-\ntial yes or no response, results are based on recodings that\ndrew upon responses to all three items. Internal reliability\nfor all items, at .45, is quite low but typical of inventories\ndesigned to assess the incidence of adventitious events over\na limited period of time.\n2. Chronic economic strains. Because research has empha-\nsized the important role of chronic stress (e.g., Cohen et\nal., 1998), we included five items. The focus of these\nitems was disproportionately on economic stress, be-\ncause past research has indicated that Mexican Ameri-\ncans in general experience higher rates of poverty, and\nwe hypothesized that economic strain might be particu-\nlarly important in the lives of older members of this\ntarget population. Four items came from the Pearlin,\nMenaghan, Lieberman, and Mullen (1981) Index of Chronic\nEconomic Strain (reported Cronbach's   .73; 3-year\ntest\u00adretest reliability  .9; Chronbach's  for present\n3. Personal health events. These were 10 items that assess\nonset or initial diagnosis of either acute health events or\nchronic health problems within the past year. Such health\nstressors are problematic in that they often introduce a\nspurious effect into predictions of health-related out-\ncomes. In the analyses presented in this article, we\ntreated health stressors as a distinct category. We were\nconcerned that because the outcome measure of depres-\nsion includes several somatic items, it was possible that\nany relationship could be due to explanatory and out-\ncome measures both tapping health status. Of the in-\ncluded items, two dealt with experiences within the past\nthree months: (a) having a health problem that limited\nactivities, and (b) having a health problem that required\nbed rest. The remaining eight items dealt with health ex-\nperiences over the past year: (a) an illness or injury re-\nquiring hospitalization; (b) total days spent in a hospital;\n(c) heart attack; (d) stroke; (e) bone fracture; and (f) di-\nagnosis with cancer, hypertension, or diabetes. Internal\nreliability, at .21, was low but again we did not presume\nhealth events to constitute a scaleable set of items.\nDepressive symptoms.--We included the 20-item Cen-\nter for Epidemiologic Studies\u00adDepression (CES-D) scale\nitems and 4 positively oriented items (reverse scored) and\nhas proved to be a valid and reliable instrument when used\nwith Spanish-speaking populations (Angel & Guarnaccia,\n1989). Although previous factorial studies of the CES-D in\nmainstream samples have reported from two to four factors,\nthere is evidence that there are two major dimensions, and\nthis has been found to be the case with our own sample\n(Miller, Markides, & Black, 1997). We used the translation\ndeveloped for the Hispanic HANES; at .88 the internal reli-\nability for this study was moderately high. A score of 16 or\nhigher is often used as a cutoff for heightened probability\nfor clinical depression, although the CES-D is not consid-\nered a diagnostic or clinical tool (Radloff, 1977; Zarit &\nAnalyses\nAll computations included adjustments based on the mul-\ntistage sampling design. For example, although the actual\nfrequency distributions shown in Table 1 are unweighted,\nthe percentages represent normalized population estimates,\nand the extrapolated frequencies represent projections based\nadjusted also all derived scores, such as means, standard de-\nviations, or regression coefficients to represent normalized\nestimates. In calculating levels of significance, we used the\nSUDAAN procedure (Version 7.5.2; Shah, Barnwell, &\nBieler, 1997) to adjust analyses for weight and design effects.\nOverall, these adjustments allowed us to make generaliza-\ntions regarding distributions and relationships manifest in\nthe Mexican American elderly population living in the five\nsouthwestern states from which the sample was drawn.\nRESULTS\nBasic Characteristics\nDemographic.--Because the demographic characteris-\ntics of the sample have implications for how Mexican\nAmerican elders fare when exposed to stressors, we present\nthese characteristics in some detail. As shown in Table 1,\nand reflecting the fact that the Mexican American popula-\ntion has proportionately fewer older people than the Anglo-\nAmerican population, the age distribution was highly\nskewed. Two thirds of the sample were aged 65 to 74 years,\nan age period often referred to as the young old stage of life;\nonly slightly more than 7% were aged 85 and older. Even this\noldest group, however, was sizable when extrapolated to the\npopulation of the five-state region: over 35,000 Mexican\nAmericans were estimated to fall into the oldest-old category.\nWomen accounted for 56% of the sample, fewer than\nwould be anticipated in an Anglo sample. More striking,\nperhaps, are the distributions for income and education. Well\nover a third reported personal incomes of less than $5,000,\nand half had not completed elementary school. These results\ndemonstrate that, compared to other groups of older adults,\nMexican Americans have fewer economic resources with\nwhich to cope with adverse events and conditions.\nCognitive status.--Although the levels of educational\ndisadvantage evident in our sample have been associated\nwith increased MMSE errors in both American and interna-\ntional studies (Crum, Anthony, Bassett, & Folstein, 1993),\nthe results suggested that this was a relatively intact group.\nNearly two thirds fell within what is generally considered\nthe normal range for Anglos, with another 30% falling\nwithin the mild impairment category (Zarit & Zarit, 1998).\nFewer than 7% had scores indicative of severe cognitive\ndeficit. This low proportion translated into a projection that\nwell over 30,000 older, community-dwelling Mexican\nAmericans in the five-state region may suffer from severe\ncognitive impairment.\nAcculturation.--By and large the sample displayed rela-\ntively low levels of linguistic acculturation. For example,\napproximately 37% was unable to read English and 30% re-\nported that they could not speak English. In contrast, about\n58% reported they spoke only Spanish with their spouse,\nand a full 74% reported that they spoke only Spanish with\ntheir (middle-aged) children. At family gatherings, the pro-\nportion relying solely on Spanish dropped to 47%, perhaps\nreflecting out-marriages and greater use of English among\nyounger generations. Two questions asked about character-\nistics of neighbors and friends over the participant's life-\ntime, with responses suggesting that large numbers of older\nMexican Americans live rather segregated lives. Over 76%\nreported that their friends had been mostly MexicanAmericans\naverage number of persons in the household was 2.75). Ap-\nproximately 57% reported having only one or two living\nsons, and roughly the same proportion reported one or two\nliving daughters. A series of questions asking about the\nnumbers of people in the household of differing ages again\nsuggested that the majority of the participants did not live\nwith people of differing generations. On the other hand, al-\nthough generally not living as part of an extended family,\nthe majority of these elders were not socially isolated:\n68.5% reported that they could count on family members to\nhelp out most of the time, and 66.2% reported having a fam-\nily member or friend with whom they could talk \"about\nyour deepest problems\" most of the time. Only 22% re-\nported seeing one or no children each month.\nLife events.--Several of the included events were re-\nported with some frequency. As shown in Table 1, 22.4% of\nthe subjects reported the death of a family member or close\nfriend within the past year, and 19.3% reported the serious\nillness of a family member. Slightly over 14% reported a\nworsening of their financial situation and about 10% reported\nTable 1.

Frequencies are unweighted; inflated frequencies project to estimated population of Mexican\nAmericans aged 65 and older (N  498,176) in the five-state region under study [U.S. Bureau of the Census.

Although this high proportion of immi-\ngrants might suggest greater than usual vulnerability, many\nof these individuals had spent a substantial length of time\nhere: The average number of years in the United States was\nwithin the past year; at the other extreme, a total of 7 had\nimmigrated 90 or more years ago.\nSocial supports.--Turning to social support characteris-\ntics (Table 1), the results suggested that the Mexican Ameri-\ncan elders were generally well integrated into the family\nnetwork. Contrary to stereotypes, the majority did not live\nas part of a large and multigenerational household: Over\n20% lived alone and this percentage increased to approxi-\nmately 62% when two person households were counted (the\na residential change of some sort. Several other events oc-\ncurred with less frequency, but are still of interest because\nthe events were not trivial: 9.3% reported that their spouse\nwas hospitalized within the past year; 5.8% reported they\nhad become caregivers, and 2.5% reported becoming a\nwidow (a specific instance of \"death of a close other\").\nChronic strains.--Perhaps the most striking information\ncontained in the distributions for more durable stressors was\nthat over 55% of participants reported difficulty in paying\nmonthly bills some or most of the time. This percentage\ntranslated into an estimate that over 240,000 Mexican Ameri-\ncans elders in the five-state region frequently encountered\nproblems paying their bills. Approximately 18% reported\nthat they did not have enough money left at the end of the\nmonth to make ends meet. Lower proportions reported not\nhaving enough money for food (7.2%) and medical care\n(8.9%) some or most of the time.\nHealth stressors.--For this sample, the most frequently\nreported health events were those that either limited activi-\nties or required hospitalization (Table 1). The most com-\nmonly reported health event, at 27%, was having to cut\ndown on activities within the past 3 months because of ill-\nness or injury. Approximately 19% reported having been\nbedfast all or most of a day within the past 3 months be-\ncause of illness or injury. At least one hospitalization during\nthe past year was reported by 19.2%, and nearly 17% re-\nported having spent 2 or more days in the hospital. The fre-\nquency of being diagnosed during the past year with hyper-\ntension, diabetes, and cancer was relatively low, as was the\nincidence of stroke and heart attack. Still lower was the inci-\ndence of bone fractures, a finding that builds on reports indi-\ncating that the prevalence of osteoporosis among older\nMexican Americans was relatively low (Markides, Rudkin,\nDepressive symptoms.--The outcome measure used in\nthis study was the CES-D. With the standard cutoff of 16 or\nhigher, the results suggested that over one quarter of the Mex-\nican American elderly population in the five-state region cov-\nered by the study manifest symptom levels indicative of de-\npression. This translated into a five-state estimate of 120,770\nolder Mexican Americans who may be in need of treatment.\nPrediction of Depressive Symptomatology\nTo evaluate the contribution of a general stress model to-\nward an understanding of depressive symptomatology in\nthis sample, we employed a hierarchical regression ap-\nproach that followed the conceptual model outlined earlier\nin this article. Each included variable has been found in pre-\nvious research to associate with depressive symptoms. As\nshown in Table 2, at nearly every level the hierarchical anal-\nysis generated significant results. Overall, the predictive set\naccounted for 25% of the variance in depressive symptoma-\ntology. It should be noted that all predictors retained for the\nfinal analysis had previously demonstrated probability lev-\nels of .10 or lower, when we ran initial regressions without\nthe use of inflation weights. We adjusted these probabilities\nduring the final SUDAAN procedures.\nDemographic variables accounted for 5% of the variance\nin depression (Table 2). As reported in other studies of Mex-\nican Americans (e.g., Chiriboga, 1996), as well as studies of\nthe majority population, women were substantially more\nlikely to report depressive symptoms. Also in accord with\nstudies of Anglo-American and other populations, partici-\npants with lower levels of education and lower incomes re-\nported more symptoms.\nThe MMSE contribution was significant and suggested\nthat older Mexican Americans with lower scores on cogni-\ntion were likely to report more depressive symptoms. At the\nsame time, the very low proportion of explained variance\nthat came with adding the cognitive score suggested that\ncognitive factors play only a minimal role in the origins of\ndepressive symptoms. One possible explanation for the\nquite minimal MMSE contribution was that cultural or lin-\nguistic factors may have affected responses to the cognitive\ntest and thereby vitiated its meaningfulness. However, al-\nthough those who took the MMSE in English scored signifi-\ncantly higher than those who took the test in Spanish, the\nTable 2.

The one significant association indicated that\nthose elders who were more likely to speak Spanish at fam-\nily gatherings were significantly more likely to report symp-\ntoms of depression. On the whole, however, the results sug-\ngest that lower levels of acculturation do not dramatically\nincrease the risk of experiencing depressive symptoms for\nolder Mexican Americans.\nThe findings for social supports are very much in line with\nresults from studies of other populations of older adults. As\none example, it has been known for over 30 years that having\nsomeone to talk to about problems is associated with mental\nwellness (e.g., Lowenthal & Haven, 1967). Thus, it is not re-\nally a surprise to find that having someone to talk to about\nproblems was associated with fewer symptoms in this Mexi-\ncan American group. A finding that is at the very least pro-\nvocative was that those with more living sons were likely to\nreport more symptoms (number of living daughters did not\ncontribute in either direction). An examination of zero-order\ncorrelations indicated that having more living sons was sig-\nnificantly (p . 001) associated with being male, being less\nlinguistically acculturated, and living with more generations\nin the same residence. More investigation is obviously\nneeded to parse out the relationships with mental health.\nThe last three sets in the hierarchical regression all dealt\nwith various domains of life stress and together accounted\nfor 16% of the variance in symptoms. In the first set of stres-\nsors, we entered the more traditional life-event measures.\nThree associations remained significant after the SUDAAN-\nbased regression, with the strongest indicating that people\nwho had recently experienced a worsening of their financial\nsituation were more depressed. In addition, those who had\nretired within the year were less depressed than those who\nretired over a year ago. This latter finding suggests that dis-\ntance from retirement may represent a proxy for chronic\neconomic problems or for age itself. Finally, people whose\nspouse had died within the year reported more symptoms.\nOverall, the life-event measures explained 5% of the vari-\nance in depressive symptoms, an amount equal to that ex-\nplained by demographic characteristics.\nThe indices of chronic financial problems also made an\nindependent, and significant, contribution, accounting for ap-\nproximately 4% of the variance in symptom level. The only\nsignificant contributor was a measure indicating how often\nthe subject reported not having enough money to buy food.\nAfter we adjusted the significance level by the SUDAAN pro-\ncedure, the significance levels of measures indicating diffi-\nculty with medical bills and bills in general fell to what is\nsometimes indicated to be a \"trend\" level (p  .10).\nThe final set we entered into the equation (i.e., that deal-\ning with recent changes in one's personal health) made the\ngreatest overall contribution to levels of symptom expres-\nsion: 7%. The two major contributors were variables that\nseem to reflect the consequences of many different health\nproblems. The first was a self-report of the amount to which\none's activities had become limited by ill health within the\npast 3 months. The second was a self-report of how many\ndays had been spent in a hospital over the entire year.\nDISCUSSION\nThis article focuses on factors associated with depressive\nsymptoms among older Mexican Americans. Although anal-\nyses are inherently limited by virtue of the cross-sectional\ndesign, a unique characteristic of the investigation is its abil-\nity to extrapolate numbers and percentages to the entire five-\nstate region included within the sampling frame. The result-\ning figures, as depicted in the first table, show the extent of\nneed and risk in the population. Confirming our initial hy-\npothesis (regarding levels of depression), the proportion re-\nporting depressive symptoms is surprisingly high. Indeed, at\n25.7% the proportion who report 16 or more symptoms on\nthe CES-D (a cut-off score associated with a heightened risk\nof clinical depression) is substantially above the 15.1% re-\nporting the same symptom range in the primarily Anglo-\nAmerican New Haven EPESE (White, Kohout, Evans, Cor-\nnoni-Huntley, & Ostfeld, 1986). Such findings emphasize the\nneed for clinical intervention in the population under study.\nThe level of symptomatology is not particularly surpris-\ning, however, given the generally sparse economic and edu-\ncational resources available to these older Mexican Ameri-\ncans. We had expected relatively low incomes on the basis\nof existing census data, but the fact that well over one third\n(37.5%) of our subjects report personal incomes of under\n$5000 is particularly striking. This proportion is lower than\nlevels reported by any of the other EPESE populations.\nComparable figures include 25.6% for the East Boston\nand 25.3% for North Carolina (Brock, Manton, & Woodbury,\nIn light of the extreme poverty manifest in our sample, it\nis also not surprising that chronic and acute economic prob-\nlems are among the most common stressors reported. Over\n50% report difficulty meeting monthly bills at least some of\nthe time, and over 17% report not having enough money to\nmake ends meet at the end of the month. Among more acute\nstressors, the two most frequent events are related to the\ndeath or illness of a close other. The third most frequent\nevent is a worsening of financial status within the past year.\nMedical events are also common, with over a quarter of the\nsample reporting that their health had limited activities dur-\ning the 3 months prior to the interview.\nThe investigation not only evaluated prevalence of poten-\ntial risk factors but sought in addition to evaluate which of\nthese factors are associated with problems. We, therefore,\nexamine how depressive symptoms are related to stressors\nand other elements of what is generally considered to be the\nbasic stress mode. The results demonstrate that several\nstressors--as well as several other social and personal char-\nacteristics--do in fact manifest an association. Generally,\nthe factors that are associated with symptom expression in\nthis population are very similar to those factors associated\nwith symptoms in Anglo Americans, African Americans,\nand other groups and nationalities. The role of demograph-\nics, for example, is essentially the same as has been reported\nin numerous studies of mainstream Americans. Specifically,\nand supporting our second hypothesis, women and those\nwith lower incomes report more symptoms.\nCognitive status, the second hierarchical set, is not gener-\nally included in stress paradigms. We include cognition\nbecause the perception of stress is widely acknowledged as\nimportant in the stress literature, and in older populations\ncognition might play a critical role as a conditioning factor\nfor stress responsivity in addition to having a direct predic-\ntor role with regard to depressive symptoms. The results in-\ndicated that cognitive status played only a minor role with\nregard to symptom expression, and the triad of stressor\ntypes (acute, chronic, and health related) continued to be\nsignificantly associated with symptoms after the removal of\nvariance attributed to cognition.\nPartial support is provided for our third hypothesis (re-\ngarding the role of acculturation). Only one acculturation\nmeasure is associated with symptoms: Those who are less\nlikely to speak Spanish at family gatherings report fewer\nsymptoms. This particular indicator may indirectly tap the\nlevel of overall family acculturation: It can be hypothesized\nthat the more likely an elder is to speak Spanish in family\ngatherings, the less acculturated is his or her extended fam-\nily. One result may be that the extended family is less able\nto provide help, including linkages with the formal provid-\ners. Two caveats deserve mention here. First, given that\nmost of our measures tap just one dimension of accultura-\ntion, the scarcity of associations may reflect limitations of\nour instrumentation rather than limitations of the concept it-\nself. Second, being more or less acculturated in itself is not\nclearly linked to adaptation: The individual and context play\nIn contrast to cognition and acculturation, but providing\nsupport for the fourth hypothesis, all three sets of stress in-\ndicators do account for moderate proportions of the variance\nin depressive symptoms. In total, the 12 measures included\nin the final analysis generate 16% of the 25% of the variance\naccounted for in the full model. Although these levels are\ncertainly not striking, they hold interest for at least three\nreasons. The first reason is that we have relatively few items\nwithin each of the three stressor inventories. Shorter inven-\ntories such as these often are lacking in content validity:\nThey may not detect the stress experiences of subjects (e.g.,\nChiriboga & Cutler, 1980). On the other hand, the present\nresults suggest that a relatively brief array of potential stres-\nsors will generate results if the items are carefully selected\nfor population relevance.\nThe second reason is that most studies of stress focus on\nonly one type of stressor: either life events or chronic strains.\nIn this study, we include both events and chronic strains. We\nalso separate out those events that can be classified as health\nrelated, so that the contribution of each can be examined in-\ndependently. It is noteworthy that all three types of stress\nmeasure contribute to our findings.\nThe third reason the stress measures are of interest is that\nthey told a coherent story. Supporting the fifth hypothesis,\nresults from the life events and chronic strain sets of the re-\ngression analysis suggest vulnerabilities related to socioeco-\nnomic factors. This vulnerability to economic stress occurs\nin the context of socioeconomic disadvantage: Over 35%\nsixth-grade education or less. The substantial proportions\nreporting limited or no knowledge of English may also rep-\nresent at least a potential barrier to health services.\nGiven their income levels, it is not surprising that low in-\ncome is significantly associated with higher levels of de-\npressive symptomatology. However, the influence of eco-\nnomic factors clearly does not end with income. Even after\nthe variance associated with the latter variable is partialed\nout of the equation, financial life events and chronic eco-\nnomic strains, in their respective sets, are significantly asso-\nciated with symptom expression. In other words, it is not\njust level of income, but the experience of acute and chronic\neconomic events and strains, that independently and addi-\ntively affect their mood.\nThese results are in agreement with past research sug-\ngesting that economic constraints are profoundly important\nin the lives of older adults (e.g., Brenner, 1997; Krause,\n1997). Low income is perhaps the most common of con-\nstraint, with either acute or chronic financial stressors occa-\nsionally added or employed in substitution. For example,\nFerraro and Su (1999), who refer to money as a power re-\nsource, used financial strain as their primary economic indi-\ncator in a study of psychological distress in four Western\nPacific countries. In the present study, we find that for older\nMexican Americans there may be a triad of economic con-\nstraints with implications for emotional well-being. It is not\nsimply low income. It is not simply a specific financial loss.\nIt is not simply the chronic burden of meeting monthly bills.\nIt is in fact all three (income, economic events, and chronic\nstrains) that exert an independent and additive influence on\nsymptoms of depression. For health professionals these re-\nsults suggest a new strategy for risk screening: Although\nlow income remains an important risk factor for depression\namong Mexican American elders, attention should be di-\nrected towards identifying persons with chronic and acute\nfinancial stressors. These stressors play a role in depres-\nsive symptom expression that is independent of the effect\nof income.\n"
