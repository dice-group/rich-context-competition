Accordingly,\nthe presence of a downward risk means that outturns less than the point forecast\nhave a probability of more than 50%.\nIn this work, we investigate how macroeconomic risk forecasts can be evaluated.\nA typical problem of these evaluations is the small sample size of currently available\nrisk forecasts. As a start, we nd that an evaluation should not be based on the\nstandard measure of asymmetry for probability density functions (the skewness),\nbecause an alternative measure, the Pearson mode skewness, allows a markedly\nmore precise evaluation in small samples.\nWe also consider several problems to be encountered in practice and try to\noer remedies where possible. For example, if the width of the forecast density,\ni.e. the dispersion of the forecast errors is systematically over- or underestimated,\na certain test for the optimality of risk forecasts tends to yield misleading results.\nHowever, a modication of this test leads to correct results.\nA general conclusion of the investigations presented is that tests for the op-\ntimality of macroeconomic risk forecasts cannot be expected to be very powerful\ngiven the mostly very small sample sizes which are currently available. So, it is\nnot unlikely that no statistical evidence against the optimality of risk forecasts can\nbe found, even if optimality is not present, i.e. if the asymmetry of the forecast\ndensity is not predicted correctly.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nViele Zentralbanken versehen ihre makro\u00f6konomischen Prognosen mit Ein-\nsch\u00e4tzungen \u00fcber zuk\u00fcnftige Risiken, wobei ein Risiko eine Asymmetrie der Prog-\nnosedichte impliziert.

In general,\nthese risk forecasts are related to possible asymmetries of forecast densities, as\ndescribed in Kn\u00fcppel & Schultefrankenfeld (2011). In Figure 1, two examples of\nforecast densities implying upside or downside risks to the forecast can be found.2\nBoth densities are asymmetric, so that mean and mode do not coincide.\nAs noted by Leeper (2003), it would actually be important to verify whether\nmacroeconomic risk assessments contain valuable information. Since the forecast\nof the central tendency is often a mode forecast3, realizations above [below] the\ncentral tendency should be observed more often in the presence of an upward\n[downward] risk. If it turns out that this is not the case, the risk forecasts are not\ninformative.\nIn this work, we attempt to identify methods which are suitable for the evalu-\n1Authors: Malte Kn\u00fcppel and Guido Schultefrankenfeld, Deutsche Bundesbank, Research\nCentre, Wilhelm-Epstein-Stra\u00dfe 14, D-60431 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

This paper represents the authors'\npersonal opinions and does not necessarily re ect the views of the Deutsche Bundesbank.\n2To be more precise, a risk is usually dened as an important event which, in case of its\noccurrence, would lead to a change of the central forecast. For example, the risk of an oil supply\nplunge would constitute an upward risk to the in ation forecasts. Of course, there might be\nseveral dierent risks to a forecast. If the upward [downward] risks dominate, it is often said\nthat the balance of risks is tilted to the upside [downside]. Instead of using the expression\n\"balance of risks\", in this work we simply speak of upward or downward risks.\n3This fact might be surprising, but many central banks and other institutions indeed explicitly\nstate that their published point forecasts refer to the mode of the forecast density or, equivalently,\nto the most likely outcome. See Kn\u00fcppel & Schultefrankenfeld (2011) for a survey.\nmean\nmode\nmode\nmean\nFigure 1: Two of the Bank of England's density forecasts for in ation.

Risk forecasts\ncan be regarded as point forecasts, because the asymmetry of a density is usually\nsummarized by a single parameter. While there is a vast literature concerning the\nevaluation of point forecasts, we are not aware of any work which focuses on the\nspecic nature of macroeconomic risk forecast evaluation.\nMacroeconomic risk forecast evaluation has to deal with several issues. First, a\nchoice has to be made concerning the parameter which is supposed to measure the\nasymmetry of the density forecast. Also, it has to be considered how the corre-\nsponding parameter re ecting the asymmetry of the true forecast density could be\nmeasured. Moreover, evaluations of macroeconomic risk forecasts typically have\nto deal with the small sample sizes of risk forecasts. In addition, the risks that are\nforecast are usually not very large, either. Finally, many institutions do not quan-\ntify the risk, i.e= the asymmetry of the forecast density, but only give the direction\nof the risk. That is, these institutions state that there is an upward or downward\nrisk to their forecasts, or that the risks are balanced, but they do not reveal the\nmagnitude of the forecast risks. Due to small samples and only moderate asym-\nmetries of the forecast densities, the power of tests for risk forecast optimality can\nbe expected to be rather low, amplifying the importance of power considerations.\nTherefore, this study focuses on a careful analysis of the power properties of these\ntests.\nIn what follows, we are concerned with the partial optimality of forecasts,\nwhere partial optimality is dened as in Diebold & Lopez (1996). As mentioned\nby Diebold & Lopez (1996), the original concept of partial optimality refers to\noptimality conditional on the information set being used by the forecaster and\ngoes back to Brown & Maital (1981).4 When we speak of optimality in this study,\nwe always mean partial optimality with respect to the information set that is given\nby the independent variable(s) of a certain regression.\n2 How to Measure the Forecast Risk?\nIn principle, the optimality of quantitative risk forecasts can be investigated in\na similar way as the optimality of conditional mean forecasts. That is, in the\nregression\n~\nu =  + ^\nu + %> (1)\nwhere ^\nu is the risk forecast and ~\nu is the realized risk, the joint null hypothesis\n = 0>  = 1 can be tested. If the risk forecasts are not optimal, the null hypothesis\n4Therefore, it would actually seem more plausible to speak of conditional optimality instead\nof partial optimality.\nshould be rejected.\nThe major question here is how to measure risk. Since, in macroeconomic\nforecasting, the balance of risks is related to the skewness of the forecast density,\nmeasures of skewness are natural candidates for the measurement of risk. In what\nfollows, we consider the third standardized moment (henceforth standard skew-\nness) and the Pearson mode skewness of the density forecast. While the standard\nskewness measure is more familiar to statisticians, the Pearson mode skewness\nis more directly related to many macroeconomic forecasts by institutions which\nquantify risks in terms of the mean-mode dierence. Interestingly, as described in\nKn\u00fcppel & Schultefrankenfeld (2011), these institution mostly focus on the mode\nas measure of the central tendency of their forecasts. Both measures of skewness\nare standardized. This is an advantage if the volatility of the forecast variable\nchanges over time, or if the risk forecasts for dierent variables or dierent fore-\ncast horizons are to be analyzed simultaneously, for example in a panel study.\nSuppose that the parameters of the forecast density are known. Denote the\nexpectation of the variable of interest by  and the corresponding mode by p=\nThen, using standard skewness as the measure of risk, the forecast risk ^\nu for the\nrandom variable \\> henceforth denoted by ^\n> is given by\n^\nu = ^\n \nH\n\u00a3\n\u00a4\n>\nwhere  denotes the standard deviation of \\ , the variable to be forecast.

In addition,\nboth measures depend on the standard deviation of the forecast variable.\nA choice of the risk measure to be employed might be based on the power prop-\nerties of tests for the optimality of risk forecasts in small samples. We attempt to\nnd out which risk measure implies a larger power of the tests. To this end, we\nconduct a Monte Carlo study using the two-piece normal distribution (henceforth\ntpn distribution) as described, among others, by Wallis (2004). We use this type\nof distribution because it is employed by several institutions which publish macro-\neconomic risk forecasts, like the Bank of England or the International Monetary\n5We apply the usual notation where upper case letters denote random variables and the\ncorresponding lower case letters denote their realizations.\nFund.6 The density of a tpn-distributed variable | is given by\ni (|) =\n;\nA\n?\nA\n=\nD exp\n\u00b4\nif |  p\nD exp\n\u00b4\nif |  p>\nwith D = 2\nI\n.

Only for Q = 5000 the test seems to be\n8They are based on simulations with 10,000 observations for each point of each power curve.\nunbiased, although this conclusion might change if a ner grid for  was used.\nIn contrast to that, the optimality test based on the Pearson mode skewness\nworks reasonably well in small samples. For Q = 20, its power is not very large,\nreaching up to about 60% if the density is standard normal, i.e= if  = 1. However,\nits size is close to 5%, although %!>l is not normally distributed. For Q = 40, the\npower is large for all  6= 2 considered and the empirical size is close to 5%.\nThese results show that tests for the optimality of risk forecasts based on the\nstandard skewness are not useful in small samples. Optimality tests based on the\nPearson mode skewness, however, seem to yield fairly satisfactory results even in\nsmall samples. In what follows, skewness will refer to the Pearson mode skewness,\nnot to the standard measure of skewness based on third moments.\n3 Testing the Optimality of Macroeconomic Risk\nForecasts in Practice\nThe examples given above show that the Pearson mode skewness is a more promis-\ning measure of asymmetry than the standard skewness if risk forecast optimality is\nto be tested.

This\nproblem can be addressed by using Newey & West (1987) standard errors. As this\napproach is well-known, we will not elaborate on this issue.\n3.1 Varying Asymmetry\nInstead of assuming that the true skewness ! as well as the forecast skewness ^\n! are\nxed for all l = 1> 2> ===> Q, we will now assume that they are uniformly distributed\nover the interval\n\u00a3\n\u00af\n!> \u00af\n!\n\u00a4\n. Given a tpn-distribution, the largest possible value for\n\u00af\n! equals 1=32=9 However, such a large value is rather unlikely to be encountered\nin practice, since it would imply a folded normal distribution, meaning that the\nrealization is going to be larger than the mode with certainty. The absolute values\nfor ^\n! found in the sample of risk forecasts by central banks studied in Kn\u00fcppel\n& Schultefrankenfeld (2011) do not exceed 0=5. Moreover, the number of non-zero\nrisk forecasts in that sample hardly exceeds 30 per forecast horizon, so that we\nwill focus on samples of that size.\nIn the following Monte Carlo simulations, we consider two cases. In the rst\ncase, the true risks !l\nare independent of the risk forecasts ^\n!l\n, so that the risk\nforecasts have no information content. In the second case, the risk forecasts are\noptimal, i.e. !l\n= ^\n!l\nholds. For both cases, we simulate Q tpn-distributed vari-\n9The exact number is given by max\n\u00a1\n\u00af\n!\n\u00a2\n=\nq\n=\nables10 and estimate the parameter  in the equation\n~\n!l\n= ^\n!l\n+ %!>l (5)\nwith l = 1> 2> = = = > Q as above in equation (4). However, in contrast to the sim-\nulations above, here in general ^\n!l\n!m\nholds for l 6= m. If the risk forecasts are\noptimal, ~\n!l\nis drawn from a tpn-distribution with skewness equal to ^\n!l\nwhere the\nparameter ^\n!l\nis drawn from a uniform distribution over the interval\n\u00a3\n\u00af\n!> \u00af\n!\n\u00a4\n= If\nthe risk forecasts have no information content, ~\n!l\nis drawn from a tpn-distribution\nwith skewness !l\n, where !l\nis drawn from a uniform distribution over the interval\n\u00a3\n\u00af\n!> \u00af\n!\n\u00a4\n> and ^\n!l\nis drawn independently from the same distribution.11\nWe test the hypotheses of no information content ( = 0) and of optimal risk\nforecasts ( = 1) at a level of signicance of 5% and for various values of Q, but\nfocusing on Q = 30. We do so for ve distinct values of \u00af\nin Table 2. Apparently, the optimality tests have the correct size. Their power,\nhowever, can be quite low if the largest possible value of the true and the forecast\nrisks is low. When Q = 30, with ^\n!l\nthe case  = 0 with !l\ncoming from the same interval,) the wrong null is rejected\nonly in 12% of all simulations. In case that \u00af\n! equals 0.5, this number increases\nto slightly more than 30%.

Using the standard normal distribution, we nd results which are similar to those\nreported below.\n12This holds for all following Monte Carlo simulations as well.\n\u00af\nTable 2: Size and power of tests for optimality of risk forecasts.

Therefore pl and l have to be predicted themselves. So a risk forecast\nactually consists of three elements: the forecast mode, the dierence between the\nforecast mean and forecast mode, and the forecast standard deviation.\nSo the question arises how problems with forecasting the mode or the standard\ndeviation aect the results of tests for risk forecast optimality. Suppose, for exam-\nple, that the forecaster optimally forecasts the dierence between the mode and\nthe mean as well as the standard deviation, but the mode forecasts are biased. If,\nin this case, a test for risk forecast optimality would reject the null of optimality\ndue to the biased mode forecast, its result would be misleading.\nDenote the mode forecast by ^\npl, the mean forecast by ^\nl\nand the standard\ndeviation forecast by ^\nl. The equation used in order to test for risk forecast\noptimality is then given by\n|l\n^\npl\n^\nl\n=  + \n^\nl\n^\npl\n^\nl\n+ %l\nAssume that the forecast mode and the forecast standard deviation are related to\nthe true mode pl and standard deviation l according to\n^\nl\n= d\n+ l\n^\npl\n= dp\n+ pl\n+ xp>l\nwhere x>l and xp>l are iid zero-mean error terms with nite variances x\nand\nxp\n.13 If d and dp equal zero, the forecasts of mode and standard deviation are\nunbiased.\nSuppose that the forecast standard deviation ^\nl is equal to the true standard\ndeviation l and substitute for ^\npl on the left-hand side of equation (6). This yields\n|l\npl\nl\ndp\nl\n=  + \n^\nl\n^\npl\nl\n+ %l\n+\nxp>l\nl\n=\nNote that we do not need to substitute for ^\npl on the right-hand side of equation\n(6), because (^\nl\n^\npl\n) @l\n= (^\nl\n^\npl\n) @^\nl correctly measures the risk forecast.\nAssuming, for the sake of simplicity, that l\n=  holds, this equation implies that\n13In addition, the support of x>l must be bounded from below such that min (^\nl\n) A 0 holds.\nthe estimators for  and  in equation (6) converge to\nsolp (^\n) =\ndp\n\n+ \nsolp\n^\n\n\u00b4\n= =\nNow suppose that the forecast mode ^\npl is equal to the true mode pl and substitute\nfor ^\nl on the left-hand side of (6). This gives\n|l\npl\nd\n+ l\n+ x>l\n=  + \n^\nl\npl\n^\nl\n+ %l\n=\nAgain, we we do not need to substitute for ^\nl on the right-hand side of (6), because\n(^\nl\npl\n) @^\nl\n= (^\nl\n^\npl\n) @^\nl correctly measures the risk forecast. Using the linear\napproximation\n|l\npl\nd\n+ l\n+ x>l\n\n|l\npl\nl\n\nd\nl\nx>l\nl\n\u00b6\nand assuming that l\n=  holds, it follows that\nsolp (^\n)  \nd\n\n\u00b4\nsolp\n^\n\n\u00b4\n \nd\n\n\u00b4\n=\nSo if d\nA 0, both estimates will be biased towards zero, and if d\nestimates will be biased away from zero. Yet, if  is close to zero, the bias will\ntend to be negligible for the estimate ^\n.\nGiven these results, a careful analysis of risk forecasts should rstly check for\nbias in the forecasts of mode and standard deviation. Unfortunately, without\nfurther assumptions it is unfeasible to evaluate the bias of mode forecasts. One\nmight assume that the risks are balanced on average, so that H\n\u00a3\nl\n\n\u00a4\n= 0 holds,\nimplying H [l\n] = H [pl\n]. In this case, one could test for the bias of mode forecasts\nin the same way as for the bias of mean forecasts.14 If one is unwilling to make the\nassumption of balanced risks on average, one might just focus on the bias of the\nstandard deviation and concentrate on tests of hypotheses about .15 Of course,\na potential bias of the risk forecasts given by  6= 0 will remain undetected in this\ncase.\nIf the forecasts of mode and standard deviation are unbiased, the main dier-\nence with respect to the results of the Monte Carlo simulations conducted above is\nmostly a loss of power. Results of Monte Carlo simulations where mode and stan-\ndard deviation are unknown are presented in Table 3. The parameter \u00af\nx denotes\nthe limits of the interval ( \u00af\nx\n> \u00af\nx\n) of the uniform distribution from which x is\ndrawn. xp is drawn from a normal distribution. The true standard deviation is\ngiven by l\n= 1 and the true mode by pl\n= 0. Moreover, as in most simulations\nThe results conrm the considerations from above. Tests about  can suer\n14If the standard deviation can vary, one would need the additional assumption that (l\npl\n)\nand l are independent, because then H\nh\nl\npl\nl\ni\nH[l]\nH [l\npl\n] holds, so that H\nh\nl\npl\nl\ni\ncontinues to imply H [l\npl\nOtherwise, H\nh\nl\npl\nl\ni\n= 0 would still imply H\nh\npl\nl\ni\n= H\nh\nl\nl\ni\n. So one could test the hypothesis\nH\nh\npl\nl\ni\n= 0= However, note that the standard test for the bias of a mean forecast should actually\nbe based on the regression |l\nl\nl\nl\n=  + %l instead of |l\nl\n=  + %l. Yet, it is always\nthe latter equation that is employed. This approach could be justied if l hardly varies or\nif heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors are used. In any case, it does not seem too\nproblematic to use the regression |l\npl\n=  + %l as well for testing the bias of mode forecasts\nin case of balanced risks.\n15Another possible but even more restrictive assumption would be given by the constancy of\nthe mode, i.e. by p = pl.

In this case, the realized and the forecast risks are categorical variables.\nEven if the risk forecasts are quantitative, a transformation of quantitative risks\n(interval variables) to qualitative risks (categorical variables) might be interesting\nif the focus rather lies on the direction of the risks.\nActually, in the case of qualitative risk forecasts, there are only two possible\noutcomes: success (direction of forecast risk equals direction of realized risk) and\nfailure (direction of forecast risk diers from direction of realized risk). Therefore,\none could use tests based on the binomial distribution. However, in empirical\napplications one is most likely going to be confronted with the problem of serial\n on average equals 0=77, diering slightly from the value 0=70 implied by equation\n(9), because the latter result is based on an approximation.\ncorrelation. This problem can be addressed more easily if the categorical variables\nare analyzed in a regression context.17\nRecode the realized and forecast risks according to\n~\n$l\n=\n;\nA\n?\nA\n=\n!l\n!l\nand\n^\n$l\n=\n;\nA\n?\nA\n=\n!l\n!l\nThen tests for forecast optimality can be based on the regression\n~\n$l\n=  + $\n^\n$l\n+ %$>l\nObviously, if the risk forecasts have no information content, $\nequals zero. If the\nrisk forecasts are optimal, $\nis larger than zero but, in contrast to > it is not\nequal to one in general. This is due to the fact that, even if the forecast density\nis strongly skewed, there is still a positive probability mass on each side of the\nmode.18 However, necessary (though not su!cient) conditions for risk forecast\noptimality could be tested using one-sided tests. If the risk forecasts are optimal,\nthe null hypothesis $\n 0 should be rejected, whereas the null hypothesis $\nshould not. Note that optimal forecasts do not imply  = 0=\nWe use the same Monte Carlo simulation design as for the results in Table 2 in\norder to obtain information about the rejection probabilities. That is, we simulate\n18Only in the special case of a folded normal distribution, i.e. the case ! = \u00b1\nq\n, optimal\nrisk forecasts would always correctly predict the direction of the realized risk.\n~\n!l\nand ^\n!l\nas in Section 3.1, and we construct the variables ~\n$l and ^\n$l according\nto equations (10) and (11). Then we estimate equation (12) and test hypotheses\nabout $\n. The results are displayed in Table 4. Here, the sample size Q always\nequals 30, and the nominal size of the tests is again 5%.\nIf the risk forecasts have no information content, $\nequals zero and the null\nhypotheses about $\n($\n 0) have the correct size. If the\nrisk forecasts are optimal, $\nis positive, but can be close to zero if \u00af\n! is small.\nConsequently, the null hypothesis $\n= 0 can hardly be rejected if \u00af\n! is small. The\npower of the test only marginally exceeds its nominal size if \u00af\nThe results show that it is preferable to conduct tests for risk forecast optimality\nbased on quantitative risk forecasts if available. For example, according to Table 2\nthe power of the test for  = 0 if  = 1 is 33% if \u00af\n! = 0=5= This is considerably larger\nthan the 13% attained with qualitative risk forecasts and the test for $\nIf  = 1, the one-sided test for $\n 0 of course rejects more often than the\ntest for $\n= 0, but its power is not very large either. For example, it rejects in\n22% of the simulations if \u00af\n! = 0=5. Given  = 1, the one-sided test for $\nhardly ever rejects even if \u00af\n! is small.\nThe 95% condence intervals for the estimate of $\ninterestingly include neg-\native values unless \u00af\n! is very large. This implies that, even if the risk forecasts are\noptimal, it is not unlikely to observe more failures than successes of the qualitative\nrisk forecasts in small samples.\nOne might expect that the fact that mode and standard deviation are unknown\nfurther reduces the power of the tests if qualitative risk forecasts are analyzed.\nThis, however, is not always the case.

The mode forecast, however,\ncan aect the size and the power of the tests for forecast optimality.\nSeveral results of Monte Carlo simulations can be found in Table 5.

This alternative test could work, because, if the null hypothesis is\ntrue, this implies that (|l\npl\n) @l\n= (^\nl\npl\n) @l\n+ %l\n@l holds, independently\nof the properties of the forecasts ^\npl and ^\nl. So this test might seem preferable if\none wants to circumvent problems arising from forecasting pl and l\n= However,\n20In the most extreme case, dp can deviate so strongly from zero that the dependent variable\nbecomes a constant, because one would always observe a downward risk if dp is very large or an\nupward risk if dp is very small.\nit turns out that strong deviations from risk forecast optimality can easily remain\nundetected by standard tests of forecast optimality.\nConsider the following case: Suppose that ^\npl\n= pl and that ^\nl\n= l. Suppose\nfurther that the risk forecasts are given by ^\nl\n^\npl\n=  (l\npl\n). So if  A 1, the\nmagnitude of risk is overestimated, whereas if 0   ? 1, the magnitude of risk is\nunderestimated. This implies that the mean forecast, given by ^\nl\n= ^\npl\n+(^\nl\n^\npl\n),\nequals\n^\nl\n= ^\npl\n+  (l\npl\n) = (1 ) pl\n+ l\n=\nFor the sake of simplicity, also assume that H [pl\n] = H [l\n] = 0. The condition\nH [pl\n] = H [l\n] implies that the (unscaled) risks are balanced on average.\nEven if  strongly diers from 1, i.e if the risk forecasts are strongly non-\noptimal, it might be very di!cult to detect that ^\nl\n. Firstly, since H [pl\n] =\nH [l\n] holds, H [^\nl\n] = H [l\n] holds as well. Secondly, the correlation between\n^\nl\nand l\ncan be very large even if  strongly diers from 1. Assuming that\nFry [pl\n> l\npl\n] = 0, the correlation equals\nH [^\nl\nl\n]\nq\nH\n\u00a3\n^\nl\n\u00a4\nl\n]\n=\np\nq\u00a1\np\n\u00a2 \u00a1\np\np\ndenotes the variance of the mode and 2\ndenotes the variance of the\nunscaled risk, i.e. the variance of the dierence between mode and mean.21 If\nis small compared to 2\np\n, this correlation will be close to 1 even if  strongly\ndiers from 1.\nAs an example, consider the in ation nowcasts of the Bank of England stud-\n21See Appendix A for details.\nied in Kn\u00fcppel & Schultefrankenfeld (2011).22 The variance of the unscaled risk\nforecasts, i.e. of the mean-mode dierence equals 0=0022, whereas the variance of\nthe mode forecasts equals 0=4704. Assuming that these values are good estimates\nof the true variances of mode and unscaled risk, the variance of the mode is more\nthan 200 times larger than the variance of the unscaled risk. Even if the risk\nforecasts contain no information, so that  = 0, the correlation between between\n^\nl\nand l\nin the regression |l\n=  + ^\nl\n+ xl in such a case, one will need an extremely large\nnumber of observations to obtain an acceptable power of the test. With Q = 30,\nthe power of the test is virtually identical to its size.23\n4 Conclusion\nIn this work, we have investigated several issues arising when evaluating macroeco-\nnomic risk forecasts, focusing on tests for the optimality of these forecasts. Such\ntests are confronted with the problems of small samples, at best moderate risks\n(i.e. asymmetries) and potentially only categorical instead of quantitative risk\nforecasts. Although all simulation results presented rest on certain assumptions\nlike the tpn-distribution of the densities and the uniform distribution for the risks,\nthey nevertheless clearly show that one should not expect too much power of the\noptimality tests for risk forecasts. However, they also give guidance in order for\nthe tests to have the correct size and as much power as possible under the given\ncircumstances.\n22For these nowcasts, the assumption ^\npl\n= pl might be a good approximation to the more\nrealistic relation ^\npl\n= pl\n+ xp>l, because the variance of the mode forecasts is much larger than\nthe variance of the forecast density. The latter can be thought of as a proxy for H\n\u00a3\np>l\n\u00a4\n.\n23Results of Monte Carlo simulations are available on request.\nWe nd that the asymmetry of the risk forecasts should not be measured by the\nstandard coe!cient of skewness, because the power of the test would be extremely\nlow in this case. Instead, the Pearson mode skewness is preferable yielding much\nlarger power in small samples. The asymmetry of the true density then has to\nbe measured using the forecasts of mode and standard deviation. This can cause\nproblems in terms of power loss if these forecasts are imprecise and in terms of\nsize distortions if these forecasts are biased.\nIn order to evaluate the bias of the mode forecasts, potentially problematic\nassumptions are required. If these assumptions are to be avoided, tests for risk\nforecast optimality can still be conducted if the null hypothesis of the test is modi-\ned. That is, from the composite null hypothesis about the constant and the slope\nparameter, one can exclude the hypothesis about the constant and concentrate\non the slope parameter only, because the estimate of the slope parameter remains\nunaected by a potential bias of the mode forecasts.\nIf the risk forecasts are available on a categorical basis only, the tests suer\nfrom a further loss in power. However, they are not aected by the potential\nimpreciseness of the forecast standard deviation.\nConsidering the relation of standard tests for mean forecast optimality and risk\nforecast optimality, one might think that the results of these standard tests contain\ninformation about risk forecast optimality. While this is true in principle, we nd\nthat in practice the results of these standard tests should not be interpreted in\nterms of risk forecast optimality.\nIn order to tackle the problem of potentially low power, risk forecasts could pos-\nsibly better be evaluated in a panel setup. This may be feasible if the risk forecasts\nfor a certain variable are, for example, available for several forecast horizons.\nReferences\nBrown, B. W. & Maital, S.
