We sought to assess the likely\ncost-effectiveness of using the Diamondback 360\u00ae Orbital Atherectomy System (OAS) in the\ntreatment of de novo, severely calcified lesions from a health-system perspective.\nMethods and results: In the absence of a head-to-head trial and long-term follow up,\ncost-effectiveness was based on a modeled synthesis of clinical and economic data. A cost-\neffectiveness model was used to project the likely economic impact. To estimate the net\ncost impact, the cost of using the OAS technology in elderly ( 65 years) Medicare patients\nwith de novo severely calcified lesions was compared with cost offsets. Elderly OAS patients\nfrom the ORBIT II trial (Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of OAS in Treating Severely Calcified\nCoronary Lesions) [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01092426] were indirectly compared with\nsimilar patients using observational data. For the index procedure, the comparison was with\nMedicare data, and for both revascularization and cardiac death in the following year, the\ncomparison was with a pooled analysis of the Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization\nand Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI)/Acute Catheterization and Urgent\nIntervention Triage Strategy (ACUITY) trials. After adjusting for differences in age, gender,\nand comorbidities, the ORBIT II mean index procedure costs were 17% (p < 0.001) lower,\napproximately US$2700. Estimated mean revascularization costs were lower by US$1240 in\nthe base case. These cost offsets in the first year, on average, fully cover the cost of the device\nwith an additional 1.2% cost savings. Even in the low-value scenario, the use of the OAS is\ncost-effective with a cost per life-year gained of US$11,895.\nConclusions: Based on economic modeling, the recently approved coronary OAS device\nis projected to be highly cost-effective for patients who undergo PCI for severely calcified\nlesions.\n",

The Diamondback\n360\u00ae Coronary Orbital Atherectomy System\n(OAS) (Cardiovascular Systems Inc., St. Paul,\nMN, USA), approved in late 2013 by the US\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) specifi-\ncally indicated for the treatment of de novo, severe\ncoronary artery calcification (CAC), represents\nthe first major advance in many years for coronary\nlesion preparation dedicated to heavily calcified\nlesions. The pivotal clinical study, the Evaluate\nthe Safety and Efficacy of OAS in Treating\nSeverely Calcified Coronary Lesions (ORBIT II)\ntrial, was a single-arm trial carried out at 49 US\nsites and included 443 patients [Chambers et al.\n2014b], and was the first prospective study to\nfocus exclusively on the treatment of severely cal-\ncified coronary lesions.\nGiven the ongoing changes in healthcare policy and\nfinancing in the postreform era, payers, clinicians,\npatients, and policymakers must increasingly con-\nsider both the cost and the clinical effectiveness of\ntherapeutic devices, including not only the initial\ninpatient or acute care costs but also the postacute\ncare costs over a longer period of time. In addition,\nas recommended in the recent American College of\nCardiology/American Heart Association statement\non cost/value methodology [Anderson et al. 2014],\nit is important to assess societal-level cost and value\ninformation. These data are critical for developers\nof clinical guidelines and performance metrics, as\nwell as for health technology assessment and adop-\ntion considerations.\nThe primary objective of this analysis was to\nassess the potential cost-effectiveness of the\nDiamondback Coronary OAS device for severe\nCAC from a health-system perspective by mode-\nling: (a) the expected cost offsets, both during the\nacute and postacute care periods; (b) the poten-\ntial reduction in patient mortality and morbidity;\n(c) the comparison of mortality and morbidity\nimpacts in relation to the overall cost impact of\ndevice use via a cost-effectiveness analysis. Given\nthe lack of a control arm in the pivotal trial, an\nindirect comparison was made with other clinical\ntrial results and relevant observational data to\nassess the cost-effectiveness. This economic anal-\nysis compared the ORBIT II study population\nwith: (a) a comparison sample of elderly Medicare\nbeneficiaries; (b) a new subanalysis of data from\ntheHarmonizingOutcomeswithRevascularization\nand Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction\n(HORIZONS-AMI)/Acute Catheterization and\nUrgent Intervention Triage Strategy (ACUITY)\ntrials pooled (H-A/AP) analysis that was pub-\nlished recently [G\u00e9n\u00e9reux et al. 2014]. This study\ncompared the cost of the OAS device with poten-\ntial savings that may be attributed to lower stent-\nprocedure costs and lower revascularization rates\nin treated patients as well as the projected impact\non patient mortality.\nMethods\nStudy design\nIn October 2013, the FDA approved the OAS\ntechnology for coronary use. The covered indica-\ntion is \"to facilitate stent delivery in patients with\ncoronary artery disease (CAD) who are accepta-\nble candidates for percutaneous transluminal cor-\nonary angioplasty (PTCA) or stenting due to de\nnovo, severely calcified coronary artery lesions\"\n[FDA, 2013]. The approval was based on a sin-\ngle-arm study (ORBIT II), for which safety and\nefficacy were compared with historical data for a\nrange of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs)\nat 30 days postprocedure [Chambers et al.\n2014b]. The study met both endpoints: efficacy\nIn the absence of a head-to-head trial and long-\nterm follow up, this assessment of the potential\ncost-effectiveness of the intervention was based on\na modeled synthesis of relevant, available data,\nboth clinical and economic, in comparison with\nthe current standard of care for severely calcified\nlesions, which is the use of balloon angioplasty to\nprepare the stent-placement site. Although a rota-\ntional atherectomy device is available, it was likely\nused in only a small percentage of cases. A simple\ncost-effectiveness model was used to project the\nessential elements of the likely economic impact.\nTo estimate the net cost impact (the numerator in\nthe cost-effectiveness ratio), the cost of using the\nOAS in elderly ( 65 years) Medicare patients\nwith de novo, severely calcified lesions was com-\npared to any cost offsets. The potential cost offsets\ndue to OAS use fall into three major categories:\n(a) reduced procedural costs related to stent\nimplantation; (b) reduced revascularization events\nin the 30 days following the initial hospitalization;\nTherapeutic Advances in Cardiovascular Disease 10(2)\n76 http://tac.sagepub.com\n(c) reduced revascularization events between day\n30 and 1 year. Effectiveness (the denominator in\nthe cost-effectiveness ratio) was measured in two\nways: (a) patient survival at the end of 1 year;\n(b) life-years gained over a lifetime horizon.\nTo a considerable extent, the structure and limi-\ntations of the available data defined the type and\nbreadth of the economic comparison that was\nmade at this early stage of commercialization.\nORBIT II patients were followed through 1 year\npostprocedure. In addition, a new International\nClassification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,\nClinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis\ncode (414.4) for CAC was instituted in the last\nquarter of 2011, and data for elderly Medicare\npatients through to the end of 2012 (the latest\nperiod for which these data are available) were\nexamined. Given the small numbers, it was not\npossible to estimate postprocedure revasculariza-\ntion in the Medicare sample: instead, a new suba-\nnalysis of the elderly population from the H-A/AP\nsample was used [G\u00e9n\u00e9reux et al. 2014]. This\ncombination of information allowed us to com-\npare the two groups for 1 year postprocedure.\nEconomic model\nThe cost-effectiveness analysis was based on a\nmathematical model that integrated data on costs\nand MACE rates from several sources in order to\ncompare the performance of the OAS technology\nversus standard treatment in stenting de novo,\nseverely calcified lesions in a specific set of\npatients, i.e. elderly Medicare patients.\nThe analysis was from the perspective of a health\nsystem, which considers direct costs as well as\npatient outcomes. Given current data limitations,\nthe focus was on the key drivers for which evi-\ndence is currently available.\nFigure 1 provides a simple schematic of the com-\nparison. Elderly OAS patients from the ORBIT II\ntrial were compared with a similar sample of\nMedicare patients with de novo, calcified lesions\nfor the index stent placement and with the H-A/\nAP sample following the index procedure. Thus,\nthe cost comparison was constructed as the sum\nof three intervals: (a) the initial index procedure;\n(b) patient status at 30 days following the proce-\ndure; (c) patient status from the period between\npostprocedure day 31 and 1 year. The primary\neffectiveness endpoints were based on the survival\ndifference at 1 year following the procedure and\nwere measured in two ways: cost per `life saved'\nand cost per `life-years gained'. The latter required\na projection of expected lifetime for a typical\n(median) patient (a 74-year-old man) in the\nORBIT II elderly subsample.\nCost of the OAS device\nThe manufacturer's suggested list price of the\nOAS device in this analysis was set at US$3795\nand did not vary in the analysis. It is a disposable,\none-time-use device.\nCosts of stent-implantation procedure\nTo assess the impact on medical care resource use\nand cost, elderly (age  65 years) ORBIT II\nFigure 1.

As shown in Table 1, the ORBIT II and\nMedicare comparison samples were similar in\nterms of baseline characteristics with the exception\nof the Charlson comorbidity index score [Delong\net al. 1997]. This may be due, in part, to coding\ndifferences in the two datasets: the documentation\nof comorbidities in the clinical trial database was\nless thorough and clear because only those reported\nduring the index hospitalization were included. A\ngeneralized linear model with a gamma distribu-\ntion was used with the following covariates: age\ngroup, gender, and Charlson index, and censored\ncosts were taken into account using the Basu-\nManning method [Basu and Manning, 2010].\nORBIT II patients.\nUniform inpatient billing\nrecords were obtained for the elderly ORBIT II\npatients (n = 297) and compared with a sample\n(n = 308) of elderly Medicare coronary-stent\npatients with reported CAC. Inpatient charges\nwere adjusted to costs using hospital-specific,\ncost-to-charge ratios.\nMedicare patients.\nThe Medicare comparison\nsample was drawn from the 100% Standard\nAnalytical File (SAF) for the period September\nduced late in 2011 for severe CAC, actual docu-\nmentation of CAC via administrative coding\npractice has lagged. For example, only 1.7% of\npatients with de novo PCIs were reported to have\nCAC, and the significant degree of underreport-\ning of CAC in the Medicare population has\nrecently been described [Garrison et al. 2015].\nThis is the first published cost-effectiveness\nanalysis that relies to any extent on the\nreporting and use of this ICD-9 code for de novo\nPCI patients in the elderly Medicare\npopulation.\nThe principal data sources for the control-arm\nindex procedure cost and survival analyses were\nfrom the Medicare SAFs. The SAFs contain\nseven datasets with detailed claims information\nabout healthcare services rendered to Medicare\nbeneficiaries in fee-for-service Medicare. SAFs\nwere available for institutional (e.g. inpatient,\noutpatient, skilled nursing facility, hospice, or\nhome health agency) and noninstitutional (e.g.\nphysician and durable medical equipment pro-\nviders) claim types. Data were organized at the\nclaim level and included basic beneficiary demo-\ngraphic information, date of service, diagnosis\nand procedure code, provider number, and\nreimbursement amount. Two SAF databases\nSAF. The 5% random sample of beneficiaries\nincluded all relevant claims (e.g. inpatient, out-\npatient, physician, durable medical equipment,\netc.) except drugs, which are tracked and\nreported separately via Medicare Part D and\nnot readily accessible for evaluation. The 100%\nfiles include inpatient and outpatient claims\nonly and include all fee-for-service beneficiaries;\nMedicare Advantage program members are not\nincluded.\nFor this comparison, a special subsample (n =\nincluded all hospitals (n = 17) that coded more\nthan 10% of their PCI patients as having CAC\n(using code 414.4). This sample was used as the\ncontrol arm under the assumption that this sub-\nset was more diligent and accurate in their\ncoding.\nTable 1.

This\nincluded 205 patients with severe CAC. The\nmean age was 73.7 years, somewhat older than\nthe average age of 71.4 years seen in the ORBIT\nII study. Patients included in the H-A/AP study\npresented with unstable angina, moderate- or\nhigh-risk non-ST-segment elevation acute coro-\nnary syndrome (ACS), or ST-segment elevation\nmyocardial infarction (MI). As shown in the Sup-\nplemental Appendix Table, the ORBIT II and\nH-A/AP samples had significant and comparable\nhistories of comorbidities, such as diabetes,\nhypertension, and hyperlipidemia.\nMACE rates, target lesion revascularization/\ntarget vessel revascularization\nFor the OAS arm, estimated MACE rates were\ndrawn from the ORBIT II 1-year follow-up anal-\nysis [G\u00e9n\u00e9reux, 2015]. Estimates for the standard\ntherapy arm were based on the subanalysis of the\nelderly population patients with severely calcified\ncoronary lesions from the H-A/AP sample\nHowever, to simplify the comparison and the\nmodel, only differences in target lesion revascu-\nlarization (TLR)/ target vessel revascularization\n(TVR) were compared since most MIs would\noccur during the index procedure.\nMACE costs\nThe cost of MACEs, specifically for revasculari-\nzation (TLR/TVR), was estimated using the\nMedicare SAF samples.

For the life expectancy calcula-\ntion, the life-years gained estimate was based on\nthe median age and gender of an elderly PCI\npatient (i.e. a 74-year-old man) who would nor-\nmally have an expected an additional lifetime of\nyears after discounting at 3% per annum, which\nis the standard practice in cost-effectiveness\nanalyses with a lifetime patient horizon [Gold\net al. 1996].

Discounting\nby 3% per annum for time preference, this\namounts to 0.247 years per OAS patient, i.e.\nabout one-quarter year per patient.\nCost-effectiveness\nTable 5 presents the cost-effectiveness results for\nboth the base case and for alternative low-value and\nhigh-value scenarios. In the base case, it is estimated\nthat the use of OAS technology would enable a slight\ncost savings of about 1.2%. In addition, the average\npatient would expect to gain 0.247 (discounted) life-\nyears. On average, the documented lower cost with\nbetter outcomes, technically termed as `dominant',\nsuggests that the use of OAS technology is the clear\ntreatment of choice. At the more optimistic end of\nthe range, the cost savings could be as high as\nUS$3795 for the device). This savings projection\nstrongly supports clinical use of the OAS technology\nfor severely calcified patients, with the average\npatient gaining 0.36 life-years. Even with more pes-\nsimistic assumptions, use of the device offers good\nvalue at US$11,895 per life-year gained. This is far\ncost per healthy life-year [Anderson et al. 2014].\nSensitivity analyses\nFigure 4 summarizes the one-way sensitivity anal-\nysis in a tornado diagram. Not surprisingly, the\ntwo key drivers are the price of the OAS device\nand the cost offset during the index event. The\nrates and cost of revascularization are also influ-\nential. However, in any case, even with a 25%\nchange (in either direction) of key parameters, the\nprojection suggests that the use of OAS technol-\nogy is highly cost-effective.\nFigure 5 presents the results of the probabilistic\nsensitivity analysis in a scatterplot of projected\ncost-effectiveness ratios. The analysis showed\nthat the 95% CI for the incremental cost-effec-\ntiveness ratio of OAS technology compared\nwith standard treatment was dominated,\nUS$2657 per life-year. The figure depicts the\nresulting cost and effectiveness (in life-years)\nfrom 5000 simulations of OAS technology and\nstandard treatment. OAS results were domi-\nnant, which suggests that OAS technology is\nless costly and more effective than the standard\ntreatment in 58.5% of simulation cases. Using\na conservative (high value) willingness to pay\nprojected to be cost-effective and thus high\nvalue in approximately 99.9% of simulations\nDiscussion\nThese parallel, indirect comparisons to the\nMedicare claims data and to previous stent trials\nsuggest that the additional cost of the OAS tech-\nnology in treating de novo, severely calcified coro-\nnary lesions would likely be offset by other\ndownstream health-system cost savings. These\nresults represent a conservative estimate of poten-\ntial savings. A less optimistic set of assumptions\nfor OAS technology use suggested a modest\nincrease in overall costs (US$848), but still pro-\nduced a cost-effectiveness ratio that is deemed to\nbe high value when mortality reductions are con-\nsidered. Given the expectation of better health\noutcomes in terms of improved survival and fewer\nMACE episodes, it is highly likely that this inter-\nvention will be cost-effective from a health-system\nperspective that considers both payer medical\ncare costs and health benefits to patients\nthemselves.\nTable 4.

The cost differential in\nthe index procedure reflects a variety of possible\nfactors, including fewer in-hospital MACEs (par-\nticularly MIs), fewer complications that lead to\nlonger stays, and reduced use of supplies, such as\nguide wires. The impact on physician costs was\nnot included since neither dataset includes them.\nTable 5.

The H-A/\nAP analysis of elderly patients showed a higher\noverall revascularization rate in the first year, but\nwith the major difference appearing in the first 30\ndays following the index procedure. This would\nbe important to facilities that are at financial risk\nfor the cost of postoperative re-admissions in the\nfirst 30 days. The significance of, and reasons for\nthe slightly higher mean revascularization rates in\nare unclear, however, the difference is small and\ndoes not greatly affect the overall 1-year differen-\ntial. The mean age in the ORBIT II trial was 71.4\nyears [Chambers et al. 2014b], which is slightly\nless than the 73.7 years in severely calcified\npatients in the H-A/AP analysis. Older patients in\ngeneral have worse outcomes. Furthermore, the\nORBIT II study may have more patients with sta-\nble angina compared with the H-A/AP sample.\nPatients with unstable angina or acute MI are\nmore likely to have recurring events versus a stable\nangina population. This could bias the projected\nsavings upwards, though probably only slightly.\nIn any case, the sensitivity analysis demonstrates\nthat, even at the lower bound of the mortality\nadvantage, use of the OAS technology would be\nhighly cost-effective at about US$12,000 per life-\nyear gained. Even with an adjustment for lower\nquality of life compared with a perfectly healthy\nperson, which was not calculated in this analysis,\nthis cost would be far below the high-value thresh-\nproposed by Anderson and colleagues [Anderson\nThis analysis had several limitations. First, there\nwas lack of a direct comparator, as ORBIT II was\na single-arm study. Second, coding of CAC in the\nMedicare data has lagged since its introduction\nand therefore, was highly likely to have been\nunderreported at the time of this analysis. Third,\nsince the degree or severity of calcification is not\nalways known or estimated, it was unclear how\nwell the Medicare SAF sample compared with the\nORBIT II trial. While the retrospective compari-\nson of this cohort has inherent bias, the H-A/AP\ntrials represent the largest cohort of patients with\nseverely calcified lesions ever published. While\nusing different cohorts with different demographic\ncharacteristics is a limitation, we believe that these\ncohorts are the best available population in the\ncurrent literature, and that they are appropriately\nmatched for calcification severity. Fourth,\nalthough the multivariate cost equation for differ-\nences in the index PCI is potentially subject to\nunmeasured confounding, the adjustment for the\nCharlson index and other measured variables was\nlikely biased downwards due an underestimate of\nthe Charlson index in the ORBIT II sample.\nThus, their actual costs are lower than predicted.\nFifth, the HORIZONS-AMI [Stone et al. 2008]\nFigure 5. Scatterplot of results of probabilistic sensitivity analysis. WTP, willingness to pay.\nTherapeutic Advances in Cardiovascular Disease 10(2)\n84 http://tac.sagepub.com\nand ACUITY [Stone et al. 2006] trials enrolled\npatients with ACS. Patients with ACS have been\nshown to have worse outcomes than patients with\nstable angina. In addition, since morbidity-related\nMACEs are higher with standard therapy, this\nmodel likely underestimated the total impact of\npatient-level, health-status improvements made\npossible by the OAS technology because it does\nnot capture the negative impact that these events\nhave on a patient's quality of life. Finally, the\nassumption about survival impact might be ques-\ntioned because of the lack of a direct comparison.\nORBIT II may have been underpowered to meas-\nure this single component of the composite MACE\nmeasure.\nConclusion\nRelying on comparison of a single-arm trial to his-\ntorical data, the FDA approved the OAS technol-\nogy in October 2013 to improve outcomes in\ndifficult-to-treat PCI patients with severely calci-\nfied coronary lesions. For this population, this\neconomic modeling analysis suggests that using\nOAS technology is likely to result in lower inpa-\ntient costs, particularly for the initial procedure\nand during the immediate 30-day follow-up\nperiod. Based on economic modeling from the\npivotal ORBIT II trial as well as indirect compari-\nsons with other trial and Medicare data, the OAS\ndevice likely represents both significant clinical\nand highly cost-effective improvements in the\ncare of patients with severely calcified lesions\nundergoing PCI.\nFunding\nThe ORBIT II trial was funded by Cardiovascular\nSystems, Inc.
