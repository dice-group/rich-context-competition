On average, providing public coverage would increase annual physician visits\nacross states. The annual physician visit rate in the 3 states with the highest access for\nthe uninsured was 160% of that in the 3 lowest-access states. Safety net capacity in\nthe high-access states ranged from 120% to 220% of that in the low-access states.\nConclusions Our data suggest that the potential effects of CHIP vary substantially\nacross states. Notably, improvements in access to health care by uninsured low-\nincome children should be greater in states with the fewest safety net resources.\ncomes.11 In addition, diversity in state\nregulations and programs has pro-\nduced significant interstate variation\nin all aspects of the health care sys-\ntem.12,13 Therefore, to assess the poten-\ntial and limitations of new state pro-\ngrams targeted to the uninsured\nrequires information about how ac-\ncess differs across states.\nThe purpose of this article is to ex-\namine variation in access to physician\nservices for uninsured children in 10\nstates and to explore the role the safety\nnet plays in this variation. Using simu-\nlation methods, we also investigate the\nlikely improvements in access under a\nnew public insurance program for low-\nincome uninsured children in the 10\nstates. To date, all but 2 states have re-\nceived approval from the Health Care\nFinancing Administration for a CHIP\nplan to expand coverage of children.2\nHowever, at least 20 states indicate they\nare still developing the fully phased-in\nCHIP program.14 Thus, it will be some\nyears until the CHIP programs are fully\nimplemented and several years be-\nyond that before postimplementation\nempirical evidence is available on the\neffects of the programs. Therefore, our\nsimulation analysis provides policy-\nmakers with current information about\nthe potential implications of CHIP.\nMETHODS\nData\nData for our study come from the Rob-\nert Wood Johnson Foundation Family\nHealth Insurance Survey conducted in\nrado, Florida, Minnesota, New Mexico,\nNew York, North Dakota, Oklahoma,\nOregon, Vermont, and Washington.\nThey were selected for the Founda-\ntion's State Initiatives in Health Care Re-\nform program through a competitive\napplication process,15 but the selec-\ntion was designed to include both large\nand small states and states in all re-\ngions of the country. The states span\nthe range of variation observed in all 50\nstates in important population, health\nsystem, and health policy characteris-\ntics including age, education, race, in-\ncome, health maintenance organiza-\ntion enrollments, physicians per capita,\nhealth spending per capita, and state\nThey also represent the range of exist-\ning state health care financing pro-\ngrams for children as measured by the\nand Medicaid expenditures per en-\nrolled child (ranging from $870-\nappropriate geographic unit for our\nanalyses because they are the relevant\njurisdiction for CHIP policy.\nminute telephone interviews were con-\nducted with families in each state. Fami-\nlies with Medicaid enrollees or\nuninsured persons were oversampled\nusing a general population telephone\nscreening interview. The Medicaid\npopulation identified in the screening\ninterview was supplemented by sam-\npling from program enrollment lists in\n9 of the 10 states. Finally, households\nwithout telephones in a small number\nof geographic areas in each state were\nidentified and interviewed in person.\nResponse rates ranged from 61% in New\nYork to 83% in North Dakota.\nThe interview unit was the family.\nWithin families, the survey collected de-\nmographic and insurance information\nabout all children in the family and\nasked about the health status and uti-\nlization of a randomly selected child.\nchildren. We used this sample to esti-\nmate the number of low-income unin-\nsured children in each state, which mea-\nsures the potential impact of CHIP if\nall children eligible for public insur-\nance enrolled in it.\nTo estimate access effects of provid-\ning coverage to low-income uninsured\nchildren, we modelled physician visits\nas described below. To fit the model, we\nrestricted the sample to children who\nwere uninsured for the full year prior to\nthe survey, those who were covered by\nMedicaidorspecialstate-sponsoredpro-\ngrams (eg, MinnesotaCare) during the\nentire year, or those who were covered\nby private employer-sponsored insur-\nance (including the Civilian Health and\nMedical Program of the Uniformed Ser-\nvices [CHAMPUS]) for the full year. We\nlimited our sample to those whose in-\nsurance remained constant for the year\nbecause our health service utilization\nmeasures were also for the preceding\nyear. Lack of congruence between the\nmeasure of insurance and the measure\nof health service use can lead to biased\nestimates of the effect of insurance sta-\ntus.18 Moreover, other research has\nshown that the relationship between\nhealthcareuseandinsurancestatusdoes\nnot differ for the continuously unin-\nsured and those in insurance transi-\ntions during the period of uninsur-\nbias our estimates of the relationship.\nWe also excluded children who were\ncovered by more than 1 type of insur-\nance program during the year and those\ncovered by private, individual insur-\nance.Finally,weexcludedchildren who\nwere entitled to Medicaid because they\nwere receiving Supplemental Security\nIncome. These children were eligible for\nMedicaid because they had special\nhealth problems. Including them in our\nmodel might result in selection bias in\nour estimates of the insurance effect,\nand so in our simulation of the effect\nof an expanded public insurance pro-\ngram.4 The sample used in fitting our\nemployer-sponsored private insur-\nance. Each state was given equal weight\nin the analysis. Within states, weights\nwere used to account for differential\nsampling probabilities.\nWe collected secondary data on\nhealth care safety net resources by\nthen expressed as a proportion of some\ndenominator--for example, public hos-\npital beds divided by total hospital beds.\nWhen the safety net resource gener-\nally served a subset of the population,\nthe chosen denominator reflects an at-\ntempt to measure the appropriate in-\ncome, insurance, or demographic group\nthat is served. Some of the measures we\nused are indicators of capacity while\nothers include dimensions of both ca-\npacity and service utilization. Because\nwe compared differences between states\nin the measures of the safety net with\ndifferences between them in our esti-\nmates of access for uninsured chil-\ndren, we would have preferred pure\nmeasures of capacity. However, mea-\nsuresthataccuratelyreflectcapacitywere\nnot always available. For example,\nsimple counts of physical plant (such as\nthe number of hospital emergency and\noutpatient departments) do not mea-\nsure the number of patients that can be\nserved. In such case, we have used uti-\nlization as the measure to standardize\ndifferences in the number of physical\nplants per state. We believe the consis-\ntency of the relationships we observed\nfor both the pure capacity measures and\nthose that included some component of\nutilization supports our conclusions.\nStateswereclassifiedashaving\"high\"\nvs \"low\" safety net capacity. To do so,\nthe states were ordered from highest to\nlowest on each of the 5 safety net ca-\npacity measures collected and were as-\nsigned a rank from 1 to 10 consecu-\ntively. The 5 rankings for each state\nwere then summed to create an index;\nthe 3 states with the highest rankings\n(lowest index values) were deemed to\nhave high safety net capacity, whereas\nthe 3 with the lowest rankings (high-\nest index values) were classified in the\nlow-capacity group.\nEstimation of Access Effects\nWe used a 2-part multivariate model to\nestimate the relationship between in-\nsurance status and ambulatory care vis-\nits for the children in our analytic\nsample. The first part was a logit model\nfor the probability of having an ambu-\nlatory physician visit in a year; the sec-\nond part was a linear regression for the\nlogarithm of the number of visits for\nthose who have at least one. Both mod-\nels included indicator variables for\nthe type of insurance the individual\nhad (uninsured, private employer-\nsponsored coverage, or Medicaid); in-\ndicators for the state; the child's age, sex,\nrace, and health status; the family in-\ncome expressed as a percentage of pov-\nerty; and interactions of insurance sta-\ntus with health status and family\nincome. To capture state differences in\nutilization patterns in different pro-\ngrams, we also allowed for differences\namong the states in the effect of insur-\nance and for differences in the insur-\nance and income interaction by state by\nincluding terms interacting the state in-\ndicators with these other variables.\nWe used the model to predict or\nsimulate the number of ambulatory care\nphysician visits that each low-income\nuninsured child would have if unin-\nsured all year and if insured for a full\nyear. The simulated value for each child\nis the product of the predicted prob-\nability of use from the logistic model\ntimes the predicted number of visits.\nThe latter is the exponential of the pre-\ndicted value from the regression times\na factor to retransform from the loga-\nrithmic scale to the raw quantity scale.25\nWe first used the model to predict an-\nnual uninsured visit rates for each cur-\nrently uninsured child. We used the\nmodel rather than observed values be-\ncause some of these children were in-\nsured for part of the year, so observed\nvisits will be higher than rates of use\nwhile uninsured.\nWe then predicted the number of vis-\nits that each of these children would\nmake if enrolled in Medicaid to repre-\nsent use under a new state insurance\nprogram for the uninsured, because\nmost states' CHIP plans involve Med-\nicaid expansions and will provide Med-\nicaid benefits. Medicaid managed care\nenrollments have increased rapidly--\nHowever, most physicians are still re-\nimbursed on a fee-for-service basis and\nso their practice styles are not likely to\nbe altered.27 Moreover, other research\nsuggests that managed care alters hos-\npital use rates, but that there are few dif-\nferences in ambulatory care visit rates\nbetween the managed care and fee-for-\nservicedeliverysystems.20 Therefore,we\nbelieve our estimates of predicted Med-\nicaid visits based on 1993 data are still\nlikely to be valid for the current Med-\nicaid program.\nWe also predicted what each unin-\nsured child's use would be if covered\nby private employer-sponsored cover-\nage for the year to estimate how use pat-\nterns would change if the new public\nprogram required greater patient cost\nsharing than Medicaid.\nThe tables that follow show the pre-\ndictions averaged over all of the unin-\nsured children in our sample in the\nstate. (The regression equations on\nwhich these predictions are based are\navailable on request to the authors.) We\nmeasured variation between the states\nin access rates by the coefficient of varia-\ntion--the SD of the 10 state estimates\ndivided by the unweighted mean of the\nstate estimates. We compared differ-\nences between the states in predicted\naccess with differences in safety net ca-\npacity. This is an indirect estimate of\nthe effect of the safety net, rather than\na direct estimate of the relationship that\nwould be obtained by including these\nmeasures in the multivariate models.\nWe could not include the safety net\nmeasures, which are state-specific mea-\nsures, directly in our regressions be-\ncauseweusedafixed-effectsmodel with\nstate indicators and interactions of state\nindicators and other key variables. We\nchose this approach to capture the\nmyriad of differences between states in\nhealth care policies and programs and\nthe effect they may have on access. With\nonly 10 states, we do not have enough\ndf to include measures for each of the\nimportant programs and policies that\nvary among the states. If safety net ca-\npacity is correlated with other state poli-\ncies that affect access, however, our ap-\nproach may overstate the marginal\ncontribution of the safety net.\nRESULTS\nThere are substantial differences among\nstates in the potential of a public in-\nsurance program to expand coverage of\nlow-income uninsured children. In our\nsurvey states, the uninsured rate for\nlow-income children ranged from\n9% in Vermont to 31% in Florida\n(TABLE 1). As a proportion of all un-\ninsured children, the low-income group\nin New Mexico. These disparities,\nwhich have been documented by oth-\ners, suggest that there will be consid-\nerable differences in the magnitude of\nthe coverage effects of CHIP among\nstates.28 They are a reflection of past dif-\nferences in private insurance cover-\nage, in Medicaid and other public in-\nsurance programs, and in the income\ndistribution of families with children.\nWe predict that expanding public in-\nsurance would substantially improve\naccess for low-income uninsured chil-\ndren (TABLE 2). On average in the 10\nstates, use would rise from 2.3 visits to\nWe used behavior for children under\nMedicaid and state-only insurance pro-\ngrams for low-income populations to\nestimate the effect of a new program be-\ncause few states have imposed cost shar-\ning that exceeds Medicaid levels in their\nCHIP programs. Should states impose\ngreater cost sharing, use could be sig-\nnificantly lower. Specifically, we pre-\ndict low-income uninsured children\nwould have about 3.5 visits with cost\nsharing comparable to that in existing\nprivate plans, or only about one-half the\nimprovement predicted with benefits\ncomparable to Medicaid.\nThe increases in utilization would\nvary substantially from state to state,\nhowever,rangingfromlowsofonly41%\nin Minnesota and 50% in New York, to\nhighs of 135% in New Mexico and Ver-\nmont and 189% in Oregon. Access dif-\nferences for the uninsured and those in\npublicprogramsdifferedsignificantlybe-\ntween the states (2\nability of use; 2\nof visits among users). These differ-\nences have little to do with differences\nin service use under public insurance\nprograms for children--the levels of use\namong the states were pretty tightly dis-\ntributed around the mean. Instead, they\nhave much more to do with state-\nspecific differences in use by unin-\nsured children. The coefficient of varia-\ntion in uninsured use was about twice\nthat for the insured use (Table 2). The\ndifferences in the use rates by the un-\ninsured among states are significantly\ndifferent (2\nits among users).\nWe investigated whether differ-\nences between states in the demo-\ngraphic and health characteristics of\ntheir uninsured children account for the\nvariation in access by predicting val-\nues for each state using a standardized\npopulation. Results for the standard-\nized population were essentially the\nsame as those for the state's own un-\ninsured children and are not pre-\nsented here. Thus, we conclude that\npopulation differences do not account\nfor the state-to-state variation.\nWe explored another possible cause\nof the state variation--specifically, the\navailability of safety net services to the\nuninsured, which serve as a partial sub-\nstitute for having insurance.29 TABLE 3\nshows several measures of health safety\nnet resources for the 3 states with the\nhighest access for the uninsured (Colo-\nrado, Minnesota, and New York) and\nthe 3 states with the lowest access (New\nMexico, Oregon, and Vermont). The es-\ntimates shown are based on simple\nmeans of the estimates for the 3 indi-\nvidual states--that is, they are not\nweighted by each state's population--\nbecause our objective was to use these\nstates as observations to characterize\ncircumstances in similarly situated\nstates that were not studied. The high-\naccess states, where utilization by un-\ninsured children is 160% of that in the\nmore safety net capacity depending on\nthe particular measure considered.\nThe results were similar when ex-\nplored from another perspective. We\nranked states according to their safety\nnet capacity across the 5 measures\npresented in Table 3. The 3 highest-\ncapacity states (Florida, New York, and\nWashington) had an average pre-\ndicted use rate for uninsured children\nsafety net capacity states in our study\n(North Dakota, Oregon, and Ver-\nmont). Limiting the ranking to the 3\nsafety net measures that are indepen-\ndent of utilization resulted in 5 of the\n6 states remaining in their respective\ngroup and a relative use rate of 126%.\nCOMMENT\nOur simulations of an illustrative pub-\nlic insurance program for low-income\nuninsured children suggest that CHIP\npromises to have significant effects,\nboth on the number of children who\nTable 1.

These ef-\nfects will vary significantly among the\nstates, however, not only because of the\nsize and the income distribution of the\npool of uninsured children, but also be-\ncause of differences in baseline use of\nphysician services. We found evi-\ndence to suggest that the states vary in\ntheir contributions from the safety net,\nwith a resultant effect on access for the\nuninsured.\nOur results show the potential for the\nCHIP program, but several factors may\nalter the actual outcomes. CHIP may\nnot reach all of the targeted unin-\nsured. Participation rates in public pro-\ngrams fall far short of universal, and par-\nticipation rates are likely to vary among\nstates because of differences in the\nimplementation of CHIP. Thus, our es-\ntimates of the number of low-income\nuninsured will overstate the number of\nchildren the CHIP program is targeted\nto reach who will actually be covered.\nOn the other hand, some families may\nshift children from employer plans\nto CHIP--the \"crowd-out\" effect--\nwhich would increase the number of\nchildren enrolled. But there would not\nbe access gains for those who have sub-\nstituted private insurance for public in-\nsurance, except to the extent that the\npublic program provides more com-\nprehensive coverage than the existing\nprivate coverage. Thus, our estimates\nof the average access gains for the un-\ninsured may overstate the average ac-\ncess gains across all CHIP enrollees.\nSeveral other considerations may also\nresult in bias in our estimates of the ac-\ncess gains for the uninsured who en-\nroll in CHIP. First, if those who choose\nto participate in CHIP differ from those\nwho remain uninsured in ways that af-\nfect health care use, then our esti-\nmates of the access gains when the en-\ntire population of uninsured is enrolled\nin a public program may be a biased es-\ntimate of the access gains in CHIP. We\ncompared the demographic and health\ncharacteristics of sample persons be-\nlow the poverty level who were unin-\nsured and those on Medicaid to see\nwhether there is evidence that these cor-\nrelate with participation in public pro-\ngrams. Except for age differences, which\nreflect the Medicaid eligibility expan-\nsions for young children, we did not\nobserve differences between those who\ndid and did not participate in public\nprograms.\nSecond, our estimates of the access\ngains were based on comparing cur-\nrent use by the Medicaid population\nwith similar individuals in the unin-\nsured population. However, the Med-\nicaid population is also a self-selected\npopulation. We controlled for self-\nselection by including important deter-\nminants of Medicaid eligibility for chil-\ndren in our model--especially income\nand the child's age. We also controlled\nforself-reportedhealthstatusinouresti-\nmation and excluded the Supplemen-\ntal Security Income population--\nknowntobealesshealthypopulation--\nfrom our estimation. However, there\nmaybeotherunmeasuredfactorsrelated\nto Medicaid enrollment and to use of\nservicesthatcouldleadtoselectionbias.\nFor example, those who are entitled to\nMedicaid on the basis of medical need\nare likely to have greater use than the\nuninsuredwithotherwisesimilardemo-\ngraphic profiles.
