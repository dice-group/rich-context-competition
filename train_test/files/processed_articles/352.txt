Alzheimer's disease has been thought to have familial and sporadic forms, and several genetic defects\nhave been identified that chiefly explain early-onset familial cases. In this study, our purpose was to detect all cases of\ndementia in an established twin registry and to estimate total extent of genetic contribution to liability to Alzheimer's\ndisease.\nMethods. At the first stage, members of the registry were screened for dementia, using in-person or telephone mental\nstatus testing. At the second stage, those who screened positively and their partners were referred for clinical work-ups,\nincluding neuropsychological assessment, physician examination, laboratory tests, and neuroimaging. Clinical diagno-\nses were assigned at a multidisciplinary consensus conference. Probandwise concordance rates were examined by\nzygosity, and structural modeling was applied to the data to estimate genetic and environmental influences, using both\nsingle- and multiple-threshold models.\nResults. Sixty-five pairs were identified in which one or both was demented. The probandwise concordance rate for\nAlzheimer's disease among monozygotic pairs was 67%; the corresponding figure for dizygotic pairs was 22%.\nHeritability of liability to Alzheimer's disease was estimated to be .74; to any dementia, .43. The other variance is\nattributable to environmental influences.\nConclusions. Findings indicate a substantial genetic effect for these predominantly late-onset Alzheimer's disease\ncases. At the same time, structural modeling results and large intra-pair differences in age of onset suggest that\nenvironmental factors are also important in determining whether and when an individual may develop dementia.\nDEMENTIA of the Alzheimer's type, resulting in pro-\ngressive memory loss and other cognitive and behav-\nioral impairment, represents a major health concern. Disen-\ntangling the etiology of Alzheimer's disease is essential to\ntreatment, prevention, and policy. It is known that genetic\nfactors are important for Alzheimer's disease, yet molecular\nfindings suggest substantial genetic heterogeneity.\nFamilies have been investigated in which there is a pattern\nof autosomal dominant inheritance with multiple generations\nin which affected members have an early age of onset, and\nmutations have been identified in three different genes. The\nfirst, with a locus on chromosome 21, relates to encoding (3-\namyloid precursor protein (1). The second, presenilin-1 (PS-\n1), has a locus on chromosome 14 (2). The third, with a\nlocus on chromosome 1, is probably related to encoding\nmembrane protein (3). These findings are of considerable\ninterest in suggesting disease mechanisms; however, most\ncases of the disorder, which are not early-onset, remain\nunexplained by these discoveries.\nFor late-onset Alzheimer's disease, a polymorphism for\napolipoprotein E (APOE) on chromosome 19 has been found\nto affect the risk of Alzheimer's disease, with the e4 allele\nincreasing the risk in a dose-dependent manner and the e2\nallele apparently decreasing the risk in comparison to the\nmost common e3 allele (4). However, questions have arisen\nconcerning the proportion of Alzheimer's disease that can be\nexplained by APOE and the specificity of APOE with respect\nto Alzheimer's disease (5,6). More recently, it has been\nreported that homozygosity of the 1-allele in the PS-1 gene\non chromosome 14 is also related to late onset Alzheimer's\ndisease (7). Thus, although case-control studies have de-\nscribed increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in blood rela-\ntions (8,9), the relative importance of genetic factors in the\ncausation of this illness in the general population continues\nto be largely unknown (10).\nTwin studies can address this question by offering esti-\nmates of heritability, that is, the relative importance of\ngenetic variation for liability to a disease (11). In order to\nhave an accurate estimate of heritability, it is necessary to\nascertain cases in an unbiased manner from a registry that is\nrepresentative of a population. We have superimposed a\ndementia study on an ongoing registry-based study of nor-\nmal aging, thereby providing a sample that is derived from a\npopulation and is not restricted by age or gender, nor limited\nto institutionalized cases or to those who have sought medi-\ncal treatment.\nMETHODS\nSample\n  is based on the\nSwedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging, or SATSA (12).\nSATSA consists of a subset of twins from the population-\nbased Swedish Twin Registry (13). SATSA includes all 961\npairs from the twin registry who indicated having been\nreared apart and a matched sample of 961 pairs who were\nreared together, drawn from the twin registry to correspond\nin sex, year of birth, and county of birth to the reared-apart\ntwins (14). Members of the SATSA panel have been sur-\nveyed every three years, while a subset of complete pairs\naged 50 and older has participated in in-person cognitive and\nhealth assessments on a three-year rolling schedule.\nFor purposes of the dementia study, all twins identified for\nthe SATSA sample were included, whether or not they had\nresponded to SATSA data collection efforts. Due to very low\nprevalence of dementia shown in population surveys among\nously, of whom one or both twin partners was alive in 1987,\nwere included in the dementia study. The resulting base\nof the complete pairs were MZ, figures that correspond to the\nregistry as a whole. Zygosity was initially determined by\nquestionnaire and then confirmed serologically. All pairs are\nof the same sex.\nScreening Procedures\nCase ascertainment entailed, first, screening all pairs in\nthe SATSA sample to establish whether or not the person\nshould be regarded as a suspected proband for dementia, and\nsecond, conducting a diagnostic assessment of each sus-\npected case. Subjects and collaterals were informed about\nthe study in accordance with the Ethics Committee of the\nKarolinska Institute and the Swedish Data Inspection Board.\nScreening took advantage of the level of data available\nfrom SATSA: participation in mailed surveys and in-person\nassessment; surveys only; or nonrespondent to surveys.\nFigure 1 shows these different pathways. Those who had\nrequested to be removed from future twin studies (n = 194)\nwere not screened, leaving a sample of 1,784.\nFor 638 individuals, in-person cognitive testing results\nwere available, including the Mini-Mental State Examina-\ntion [MMSE; (16)]. The MMSE was modified to include\npairs with one or both alive\nin-person testing\nMMT\nOK\nMMT\nlow\nfollow\nevery\nrespond/\nno relative\nreport\ntelephone\nscreening\nTELE\nOK\nTELE\nlow\nfollow\n'every\nsuspect\nSATSA\nsurvey\nrelative\nreport\nsuspect\nwithdrew\nnon-response to survey\nmatch w/\npsychiatric\nregistry\ntelephone\nscreening\nTELE\nOK\nTELE\nlow\nfollow\nevery\nI\nunlisted\nor not\nreached\nI\ndied\nrefused\nsuspect\nno match match\nsuspect\nDAT\nother dementia\nmild dysfunction\nintact\nexcluded\nrefused\nDAT\nother dementia\nmild dysfunction\nintact\nexcluded\nrefused\n1 other dementia\n9 mild dysfunction\n2 not located\n1 other dementia\n1 case excluded\nFigure 1.

Therefore, a cutoff\nAnother 466 individuals responded to the most recent\nSATSA survey but were not participants in the in-person\ntesting. Individuals who returned the survey were regarded\nas intact unless identified through one of two secondary\nmethods: registry linkage (described below) or a family\nmember's contacting us by telephone or by letter to indicate\nthat this member of the SATSA sample was having cognitive\ndifficulty. Altogether, 48 individuals were identified through\nreports of family members.\nFor the remaining SATSA survey nonresponders, screen-\ning was by means of a telephone interview [TELE; (17)].\nTelephone numbers were obtained by submitting the names\nto a national listing of telephone numbers. Before they could\nbe screened, 89 of the survey nonresponders had died.\nAnother 86 were unable to be reached, because they had\nemigrated or had unlisted telephone numbers or were not\nlocatable through the telephone listing or never answered.\nand 140 refused. Altogether, evaluation with either the\nMMSE or TELE was achieved with 80.9% of those slated\nfor screening and still alive.\nThe telephone interview incorporated the Mental Status\nQuestionnaire [MSQ; (18)]; items to tap other cognitive\ndomains, i.e., attention and working memory, short-term\nmemory, and cognitive abstraction; and questions about\nhealth and functional status, self-reported memory function-\ning, and depression. A proxy form of the interview focused\non functional status, memory functioning, and depression,\nincluding history and course of any cognitive or memory\nproblems.\nFinally, registry linkage was employed in which all mem-\nbers of the SATSA sample were matched with the Swedish\nPsychiatric In-patient Registry in order to identify any mem-\nber of the SATSA sample with any diagnosis of dementia.\nRegistry linkage offers the advantage that all individuals are\nscreened regardless of their participation status in SATSA.\nHowever, in part because records were available only for\nfectual, resulting in only 4 matches.\nEvaluations of Screening Methodology\nTwo issues were of concern. First, we wished to identify\nall potential cases and to avoid false negatives. Second, we\nwished to avoid any bias in screening with respect to zygos-\nity. Therefore, we undertook several ancillary analyses to\nevaluate the screening methodology.\nThe assumption that those able to answer the survey\ncompletely without assistance were nondemented was tested\nthrough applying the telephone protocol to a sample of\nsurvey responders. A sample of 70 was identified, of whom\none refused and 69 were interviewed. None was determined\nto be demented.\nThe sensitivity and specificity of the telephone interview\nwere tested on an established registry of 41 Alzheimer's\ndisease patients and controls. In this selected sample, re-\nsponse rate was 90%, sensitivity was 100%, and specificity\nIn completed diagnostic workups with suspected probands\nin the present study, the false positive rate was 33.6%. Thus,\nthere is considerable loss of specificity in an unselected\npopulation. Of 32 partners who screened negative, 31 were\nnot demented and one was a false negative. Apart from\npartners, we have no basis on which to estimate a false\nnegative rate. However, our design has built into it the\nfeature that everyone is rescreened at 3-year intervals. We\nnow have six examples of cases who were negative at\nscreening but subsequently found to be demented. None had\nan age of onset earlier than the screening, confirming that the\nscreening result was correct.\nThus, with multiple ways of entering the study, we en-\nhanced our chances of including all cases of dementia.\nParticularly notable is that considerable effort was put into\nscreening those who were nonresponders in the longitudinal\npanel, and that over 40% of those who screened positive\ncame from this group. To the extent that under-\nascertainment did occur, there is no reason to believe that it\nwas biased. At all stages, personnel collecting data were\nblind to zygosity. Nearly the same proportions of MZ and\ndizygotic (DZ) twins were screened by each method. Among\nthose who screened positive, 34.1% were monozygotic,\nmatching the distribution of zygosity in the base population.\nDetermination of Diagnoses\nThe diagnostic evaluation employed a nurse, psycholo-\ngist, and physician trained in geriatric medicine. The proto-\ncol parallels Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzhei-\nmer's Disease (CERAD) procedures for physical and\nneurological evaluations, laboratory tests, neuropsychologi-\ncal testing, and neuroimaging (19). Evaluation was discon-\ntinued and the suspected proband excluded if it was learned\nduring the evaluation that the individual was not demented\nbut instead had some other condition, such as psychiatric\ndisorder or mental retardation.\nAfter workups were complete, findings were presented at\na consensus diagnosis conference, where the chair (BJ) was\nblind to zygosity and to any information other than that\npresented at the conference. Each professional presented her\nor his independent opinion, and the final diagnosis was\nreached through discussion. Diagnostic decisions were\nguided by checklists that correspond to DSM-III-R criteria\nfor dementia (20) and for level (severity) of dementia,\nNINCDS/ADRDA criteria for probable and possible Alzhei-\nmer's disease (21), and -- once available -- NINDS-\nAIREN criteria for vascular dementia (22).\nTwin partners of probands were given an identical clinical\nworkup. While probands were all alive at the time of screen-\ning, partners were brought into the study regardless of their\nand 55% of DZ were still living. If the partners were\ndeceased and therefore had not been screened, their diagnos-\ntic assessment included informant interviews (23) and re-\nview of medical records, including death certificates. Analy-\nses were subsequently conducted in two ways, both\nincluding all pairs and excluding pairs where the partner died\nprior to the age of onset of the proband (i.e., \"truncated\npairs\").\nMean age at workup was 78.4 years (SD = 7.9) for MZ\nand 77.5 years (SD = 7.8) for DZ twins. Age of onset was\nestablished by asking the informant for a description of\nmemory and other problems, followed by the age at which\nthese changes were observed (24). Where medical records\nwere available, they were used to crosscheck the information.\nCases and partners are being followed longitudinally\nevery 18 months, with post-mortem neuropathological ex-\namination for any who die. Diagnoses used in the analyses\nreported here reflect longitudinal clarification but not new\ncases of dementia. One case that had been classified as\n\"other dementia\" met criteria for possible Alzheimer's\ndisease longitudinally; two cases that had been called Alz-\nheimer's disease were changed to reflect other dementia (in\none instance, mixed Alzheimer's and vascular dementia; in\nthe other, dementia of ambiguous etiology).\nAutopsy confirmation of diagnosis is available for 10\ncases. There was concurrence on 9 cases between clinical\ndiagnosis and neuropathological results (5 of these were\nAlzheimer's disease cases). On the tenth, from a DZ pair,\nclinical diagnosis was vascular dementia, whereas neuropa-\nthology supported a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.\nRESULTS\nSample Characteristics\nA total of 75 probands were identified: 38 probable Alz-\nheimer's disease, 11 possible Alzheimer's disease, 12 vas-\ncular dementia, and 14 mixed or other dementia diagnoses.\nAmong partners not primarily ascertained were 5 probable\nAlzheimer's disease, 2 possible, 1 vascular dementia, and 4\nwith other dementia diagnoses. Sixty-five pairs were avail-\nable for twin analyses, reflecting the fact that 7 pairs (3 MZ\nand 4 DZ) had been doubly ascertained; that is, both mem-\nbers of the pair screened positive and were diagnosed as\ndemented; and 3 partners refused to participate in the assess-\nment, losing those 3 pairs to analysis.\nThere was no significant difference by zygosity in age of\nonset. Among MZ pairs, mean age of onset for all Alzhei-\n91 years). Among DZ pairs, mean age of onset was 73.7\nPrevalence Estimates\nThe prevalence rate of dementia for those in the sample\nof Alzheimer's disease was 3.3%. These calculations are\nbased on a weighted combination of sample prevalences\nacross subgroups defined by screening outcome, but without\nincluding any false negatives. These rates compare well to\nrecent reports of prevalence of dementia and of Alzheimer's\ndisease (15). Rates of dementia did hot differ significantly by\nzygosity; and, among dementia cases, 31.0% were MZ,\nmatching the MZ:DZ ratio in the base population. Rates of\ndementia also did not differ significantly according to rear-\ning status. An identical number of twins reared together and\ntwins reared apart were given clinical workups. Of all\ndementia cases, 54.0% were twins reared apart, while\n46.0% were twins reared together (for Alzheimer's disease\nwere twins reared together).\nConcordance Rates\nThe first step in twin analyses is computation of concor-\ndance rates in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Concor-\ndance rates -- a usual means of reporting results from twin\nstudies of psychopathology -- make use of the fact that MZ\ntwin pairs are genetically identical whereas DZ twins share\non average only half of their segregating genes. Probandwise\nconcordance rates represent the ratio of the number of\naffected twin partners of independently ascertained probands\nto the total number of probands. If MZ twin pairs have a\nhigher concordance rate than DZ twin pairs, the importance\nof genetic effects is indicated. For calculating probandwise\nconcordance for Alzheimer's disease, probands with\ndefinite, probable, or possible Alzheimer's disease were\nincluded. Pairs were regarded as concordant if the partner\nhad Alzheimer's disease or mixed Alzheimer's and vascular\npathology or unspecified dementia. Pairs where the partner\nhad vascular dementia or a dementia due to another specified\ncause (e.g., hydrocephalus, Parkinson's disease) were ex-\ncluded. Results shown in Table 1 indicate significantly\ngreater probandwise concordance for Alzheimer's disease\nfor MZ than for DZ pairs. (For all pairs, difference between\nThere were insufficient probands in any other diagnostic\ngroup for calculating separate concordance rates. However,\nthere were no pairs concordant for vascular dementia. Con-\ncordance rates were then calculated for all dementias. Dif-\nference in concordance between MZ and DZ pairs was\nsubstantial but not statistically significant. The fact that the\nconcordance rate for DZ pairs for all dementias was some-\nwhat higher than for Alzheimer's disease alone was due to\nthree DZ pairs in which the proband had Alzheimer's dis-\nease, while the partner had another dementia; there was only\none such MZ pair.\nTetrachoric Correlations\nAlso shown in Table 1 are tetrachoric correlations, with\n95% confidence intervals, for Alzheimer's disease and for\nall dementias. Tetrachoric correlations, representing the\ncorrelation of liability between relatives, are calculated us-\ning PRELIS (25). The values are analogous to intraclass\ncorrelations based on continuous data. All pairs are used in\nwhich both members of the pair could be given a value of 1\n(demented) or 0 (not demented). The 0 values were assigned\nto any individual who was determined not to be demented\nafter clinical workup and to any individual whose screening\noutcome was negative. In these contingency tables, each\npair is entered only once, even if doubly ascertained.\nResults indicate a very high degree of twin similarity. MZ\npairs are more similar than DZ pairs, pointing to substantial\nheritability. At the same time, MZ pairs appear to be less\nthan twice as similar as DZ pairs. Therefore, not all of the\nsimilarity between pairs can be explained by genetic in-\nfluences.\nTetrachoric correlations were also calculated for twins\nreared together and twins reared apart. Results for Alzhei-\nmer's disease were .76 and .70, respectively. As these are\nnot significantly different from one another, rearing status\nwas not considered further.\nTable 1.

Truncated pairs are\nthose cases in which the partner had died prior to the proband's age of onset.\nThreshold Models\nRecent analytical advances in twin methodology use struc-\ntural model-fitting techniques in order to estimate genetic and\nenvironmental components of variance (26). These methods\nare based on liability-threshold models, which assume a\nlatent, normally distributed liability to disease that is manifest\nas a categorical phenotype, i.e., demented or not demented\n(27). For dichotomous or ordinal data, models are fit to\ncontingency tables for MZ and for DZ twins using the Mx\nprogram (28). A threshold is fixed at a z-score corresponding\nto prevalence of dementia in the sample. Heritability (h2) is an\nestimate of the relative importance of additive genetic differ-\nences for the variance in a population. Shared environment\n(c2) reflects experiences that contribute to twin similarity,\ne.g., living in a rural area. Non-shared environment (e2)\nrefers to the contribution of environmental experiences not\nshared by twin pairs, e.g., different work histories. Expecta-\ntions for fitting the observed data are based on the fact that\ngenetic similarity is half as great for DZ as for MZ twin pairs,\nwhile shared environmental influences contribute equally to\nmaking MZ and DZ pairs similar. A series of models was\ntested, with all three parameters included in the full model,\nand then successively dropping either the h2 or the c2 parame-\nter. Degrees of freedom reflect the number of parameters\nbeing estimated, the number of constraints, and the number\nof observed statistics. Indicators of fit include chi square and\nAkaike's Information Criterion [AIC; (29)]. A significant\nincrease in the chi square goodness-of-fit between the full and\nreduced model indicates that the reduced model fits the data\nless well than the full model. Final determination of which\nmodel to accept is based on a combination of statistical\nindicators, parsimony, genetic logic, and consistency with\ninferences based on the correlations and concordances.\nModels were fit for Alzheimer's disease and for all de-\nmentias. In addition, for all dementias, a multiple-threshold\nmodel was used with three levels: demented, mild cognitive\nimpairment (insufficient for diagnosis as demented), and not\ndemented. A multiple-threshold model is based on the as-\nsumption that the same underlying liability is reflected in\ndementia and in mild cognitive dysfunction. Power analyses\nhave shown that low population prevalence diseases (i.e., a\nhigh threshold) require inordinately large sample sizes to\nhave sufficient power for identifying accurate estimates for\nthe components of variance (30). Multiple-threshold models\ngenerally afford some improved power. Still, because of the\nsmall sample sizes in the present study, standard errors are\nquite large.\nResulting parameter estimates from a series of models are\nshown in Table 2. The second and third models are each\nnested in the full model but not in each other. The full model\nappears to offer the best solution. Models that drop the\nadditive genetic parameter have a poorer fit, meaning that\nthis parameter must be retained. While h2 and c2 are difficult\nto distinguish in these models, the pattern of correlations\nargues for retaining the shared environmental parameter.\nThe multiple-threshold model gave a reasonable fit to the\ndata, suggesting that there may be a shared liability underly-\ning dementia and mild cognitive impairment, and that these\nrepresent a continuum of dysfunction. To date, just 10% of\nthe mildly impaired individuals have gone on to develop\ndementia when followed up longitudinally.\nTable 2 shows only the models with thresholds corres-\nponding to the contingency tables underlying Table 1. How-\never, a family of models was tested using both lower and\nhigher thresholds. Higher prevalences represent the possibil-\nity of undetected false negatives. Very similar parameter\nestimates resulted from this exercise. Only under the ex-\ntreme assumption of doubling the prevalences in Table 2,\ndenoting that the contingency tables contain only half of the\ncases and that there was an equal number of false negatives\nwho were undetected, is there a noticeable effect on the\nparameters. For example, h2 for Alzheimer's disease would\nincreased under this latter assumption is consistent with prior\ndemonstration that, if the disorder increases probability of\nenrollment, then c2 will be overestimated and e2 will be\nunderestimated (31).\nTable 2.

As evident in the figure,\nage of onset can vary widely between members of a concor-\ndant pair. For concordant pairs, the within-pair difference in\nage of onset for Alzheimer's disease ranged from 4 to 16 for\nMZs and from 1 to 12 for DZs. The means were 9.5 (SD =\nwas not statistically significant. In other words, only 56% of\nMZ and 50% of DZ cases were concordant within 5 years\nfrom the age when the first member of the pair became\ndemented.\nDISCUSSION\nConcordance rates, intra-pair tetrachoric correlations, and\nmodel-fitting results with this registry-derived population-\nbased sample of twins suggest that there is a marked herita-\nble component to dementia of the Alzheimer's type late in\nlife. Concordance figures are based on ascertained pairs,\nwhile correlations and model-fitting take the population into\naccount. In particular, results from model-fitting allow\nquantification of the relative importance of genetic risk\nfactors in late-onset Alzheimer's disease. It bears emphasis\nthat these variance estimates are \"anonymous.\" Thus, twin\nstudies tell us how much influence genes have, taken alto-\ngether, but do not identify specific genes of importance.\nOne manner in which multiple hereditary factors may play\na role in Alzheimer's disease occurrence is suggested by a\nmodel of dementia that incorporates a neuropathological\nthreshold (32). Attaining that threshold is a function both of\nextent of cerebral reserve and onset of specific pathophysio-\nlogical events. Genes may contribute either to the specific\npathophysiological defect or to extent of cerebral reserve.\nAt the same time, we would not want to overemphasize a\nsolely genetic model. Two findings point to the role of the\nenvironment. First, both the tetrachoric correlations and the\nstructural modeling results point to twin similarity due to the\nenvironment (c2). These variance estimates are, again,\n\"anonymous.\" The Alzheimer's disease literature details a\nnumber of risk and protective factors (33), but the analyses\npresented here do not incorporate specific exposures. Inter-\npreting the fact that environmental factors emerged as shared\ninfluences rather than as nonshared influences (e2) does not\nmean that both members of the pair suffered from exposure\nto the same risk factor; rather, that both members of the pair\nshared a likelihood to be exposed to some factor that in-\nfluenced their risk to develop dementia.\nSecond, the range of ages of onset within both MZ and DZ\npairs is further evidence for environmental influences. Espe-\ncially for identical pairs with discrepant ages of onset, the\npossible role of environmental factors is compelling. These\nresults might even suggest a hypothesis that there are differ-\nent etiologies for liability to the disease and for age of onset.\nIt is of interest to compare these findings from the Study of\nDementia in Swedish Twins with other twin studies of\nAlzheimer's disease. The Norwegian Twin Registry has\nbeen matched with records from geriatric services in old age\nhomes, leading to the report of 83% concordance for 12 MZ\ndue to case identification strategies, the Norwegian sample is\nsomewhat older than ours. As has been pointed out (35),\nconcordance rates can increase with the age of the sample.\nFurther, this method of identifying cases would lead to high\nspecificity but low sensitivity. In particular, cases may have\nbeen missed because they never came to the attention of\nthese service sites.

Total height of bar indicates age at most recent assessment or at\ndeath.\nlence of Alzheimer's disease in this relatively young sample\nis presently 0.42%. Over time, given the intrapair differ-\nences in age of onset that we have observed, it might be\nexpected that more pairs will become concordant. The Finn-\nish Twin Registry has been linked with hospital discharge\nrecords. Probandwise concordance for Alzheimer's disease\nThere may well have been under-ascertainment due to in-\ncluding only those cases who had a hospital discharge\nrecord. Age-adjusted incidence is reported to be 0.7%. This\nnumber corresponds to the 5-year Kaplan-Meier incidence\nrates for total dementia in a population at ages 65 to 69 (38),\nbut incidence has been found to double at successive 5-year\nage groups; thus, incidence should be much greater for a\nsample followed until death. In the Finnish data, rate of\nAlzheimer's disease was also higher in MZ than in DZ pairs,\nwhich could reflect ascertainment bias.\nPrior to these studies, a volunteer National Institutes of\nHealth sample of 22 twin pairs showed a concordance rate of\n70. Although the sample was relatively large compared to\ncase studies of single individuals, the likelihood of volunteer\nbias makes interpretation difficult. The earliest twin study\nwas that of Kallman (40), who reported 42.8% concordance\nfor MZ and 8.0% concordance for DZ co-twins with respect\nto senile psychosis. This diagnosis excluded presenile cases\n(at that time, the term \"Alzheimer's disease\" was reserved\nfor presenile dementia) and combined what would now be\nregarded as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementias, and\nother more rare late-onset dementias. Thus, the Kallman\nresults can most appropriately be compared to all dementias.\nInterestingly, he held that the best model for understanding\nheritability of dementia might be to consider separate genes\nfor longevity and for the psychopathological changes associ-\nated with senile psychosis. Finally, there have been reports\nin the literature of single MZ pairs that have remained\nThere are major challenges in evaluating heritability for\nlate-age-of-onset, low-prevalence disorders at a single pe-\nriod of time. Failure to detect all cases is one major concern.\nAvailable resources precluded our undertaking either in-\nperson or telephone assessment with every individual in the\npopulation, and we cannot be certain of the sensitivity of the\ncase ascertainment procedure. However, convergence be-\ntween the prevalence of dementia in this sample and that\nreported by various population-based surveys provides some\nassurance that the method of identifying cases was success-\nful. The chief methodological concern, above all, is whether\nundetected cases differ from detected cases in any fashion\nthat would influence concordance. We did not find any bias\nin this regard. Further reassurance stems from comparison of\nthe dizygotic concordance figure to the rate of cases among\nsiblings of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, who also\non average share half of their genes. A re-analysis of 7 case-\ncontrol studies has shown that 18.5% of siblings of late-\nonset cases of Alzheimer's disease had a diagnosis of de-\nmentia (43). This rate is not substantially different from the\nconcordance rate found here for DZ twin pairs.\nBecause Alzheimer's disease has a late age of expression,\nmany presumably predisposed partners will have died of\nother causes before the proband becomes affected, poten-\ntially biasing the estimate of heritability. For this reason, we\nconsidered the data in two ways, both including and exclud-\ning pairs where the partner died before the proband's age of\nonset. When these pairs were excluded, the estimate for\ngenetic variance decreased and the estimate for shared envi-\nronmental variance increased. This result may well simply\nreflect twin similarity for survival, because pairs who are\ndiscordant for age at death are eliminated from the sample.\nAnother concern is diagnosis, and the difficulty in accu-\nrately diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. We may have been\neither too inclusive or too exclusive with respect to Alzhei-\nmer's disease diagnoses. Consequently, we have presented\nresults based on diagnosed Alzheimer's disease but also for\ntotal dementia. At the same time, neuropathological con-\nfirmation indicates that the diagnoses are largely accurate.\nOther concerns include refusals on the part of co-twin\npartners to participate and the fact that the study is cross-\nsectional. These methodological considerations all would\nmainly lead to an underestimation of heritability. For exam-\npie, if all pairs are followed longitudinally, some partners,\nalthough currently intact, may develop dementia.\nAlthough ours is a large twin study of dementia, because\nAlzheimer's disease is a low-prevalence disorder, sample\nsize is small with respect to statistical power, and confidence\nintervals are large. Numbers of cases become particularly\nsmall when pairs are dropped from Alzheimer's disease\nanalyses due to the partner's presenting with another de-\nmenting disorder or to the partner's death before the pro-\nband's age of onset. It should be cautioned too that shared\nenvironment will be overestimated if a disorder is age-\nrelated, because twin pairs share the same age. However, a\nlarger sample would be required in order to determine the\ncontribution of age to the c2 term. Further, gene-\nenvironment correlation and gene-environment interaction\nare not evaluated. Finally, it should be noted that heritability\nestimates, because they are anonymous, may include both\ngenetic influences specific to Alzheimer's disease and ge-\nnetic influences related to cerebral reserve. Nonetheless,\nacross the various analyses, results consistently indicated\nsignificant heritability.\nIn conclusion, our findings indicate a substantial genetic\nsusceptibility in late-onset Alzheimer's disease cases,\nreflecting multiple defects or variations in brain metabolism\nthat may ultimately lead to a similar pathological cascade. At\nthe same time, it appears that environmental factors play a\nkey role with respect to both occurrence and age of onset,\neither through their effects on cerebral reserve or through\nmodifying the disease cascade, an observation with implica-\ntions for strategies to delay onset or to prevent disorder\nentirely.\n"
