A num-\nber of studies have shown that some clients' participation in\ncommercial sex is motivated by their desire for intimacy.\nBernstein (2007) coined the term bounded authenticity to\ndescribe clients' experience of an authentic emotional and\nphysical connection with a sex worker. Sander's (2008a)\nexamination of the sexual scripts of \"regular\" clients of sex\nworkers displays a mirroring of conventional relationship\nscripts in their interactions.Milrod and Weitzer's (2012)\nexamination of online clients suggest the possibility for a\nshift toward unbounded affection and romantic relationships\nbetween clients and their regular sex workers. Milrod and\nas \" . . . interactions with (sex) providers mirror those found\nin conventional non-remunerative sexual relationships.\"\nGFE sessions involving \" . . . lengthy period of foreplay in\nwhich the customer and the escort touch, rub, fondle, mas-\nsage and perhaps even kiss passionately.\" GFE has become a\nuniversally sought-after commodity by male clients, and a\ntool used by sex workers to increase their appeal and demand\nMilrod & Weitzer, 2012). These intimate acts challenge the\nnotion that clients indulge in commercial sex for the sole aim\nof domination and exploitation. This study examines the dis-\ncourses and experiences of 23 Malaysian men who have\nformed a relationship with a foreign female sex worker\n(FSW) to understand their willingness to transcend the\nboundaries of commercial sex at the cost of great personal\nrisk.\nLiterature Review\nFeminist scholars have until recently focused their attention\non the supply side of the sex trade. Feminist scholars are split\nin their views on the women involved in the sex trade. On\none side, there are those that support the abolitionist perspec-\ntive arguing that men exploit their positions of power by\nallowing the sex trade to continue at the expense of the suf-\nfering and victimization of the women. They argue that the\nunequal power relations between the men in power and the\n1Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Kajang, Selangor, Malaysia\nCorresponding Author:\nLim Soo Jin, Faculty of Creative Industries, Universiti Tunku Abdul\nRahman, Jalan Sungai Long, Bandar Sungai Long, Cheras 43000, Kajang,\nSelangor, Malaysia.\nEmail: sjlim@utar.edu.my\nRisky Pleasures: Malaysian Male Clients\nTranscending the Boundaries of\nCommercial Sex With Foreign Female\nSex Workers\nLim Soo Jin1 and Cheah Shu Xu1\n Keywords\nsex work, clients, intimacy, emotional labor, bounded authenticity\n2 SAGE Open\nwomen have allowed the commodification of women to \"sex\nOn the other end of the spectrum, feminist scholars argue for\nthe \"right\" to capitalize on their sexuality for economic\ngains. They argue that by restricting their freedom to choose\nsex work limits their freedom as women (O'Connell\nfor the freedom to choose sex work, citing many legitimate\n\"women\" occupations are built to capitalize on female sexu-\nality with the aims of maximum profit (see Oerton & Phoenix,\n2001). To break the deadlock, scholars shifted their focus to\nthe demand side of the equation which until recently has\nbeen largely ignored.\nThe early 20th-century view based on the natural male\nsexual drive and the psychopathological model proposed by\nCharles Winick (1962) who linked men's desire for sex\nworkers as a sign of mental disorder has largely been aban-\ndoned by scholars in light of current empirical literature\nwhich suggest that men who purchase commercial sex are\n\"normal\" \"everyday\" men spread throughout all social\ngroups with little distinguishing characteristics (Monto &\nstreet-level sex workers have been challenged not providing\na complete picture of the experiences of sex workers (Weitzer,\n2005), resulting in greater interest on the less visible sectors\n(indoor mid-tier and high-end) of the sex trade. Studies have\nrevealed that clients within the mid and upper tiers of the sex\ntrade are nether homogeneous group nor specific in their\nmotives when purchasing commercial sex (Bernstein, 2007,\nBernstein (2007) noted that the relationship between con-\ntemporary markets in commercial sex and the growing vari-\nety of sex services in postindustrial societies shows the\ndifference in the expectations of clients of street-level sex\nworkers where the exchange is impersonal and focused on\nphysical release mid and upper tier indoor establishments\nwho demand greater amounts of intimacy and personaliza-\ntion. Sex work within the mid and upper tiers has shown to\nrequire greater amounts of intimacy and emotional labor\nfrom the sex worker.\nBernstein (2007) coined the term bounded authenticity,\nmeaning a genuine albeit limited sexual and emotional expe-\nrience by both the client and the sex worker within the\nboundaries of a paid sexual encounter. What is for sale is not\nmerely the sexual satisfaction of the client but rather an\nauthentic emotional and physical connection felt by both\nparties constrained within the boundaries of commerce and\ntime. The demand for intimacy in commercial sex is seen in\nthe widely used term GFE and is understood to signify ver-\nbal and physical acts performed by a sex worker akin to that\nof a conventional relationship which suggest a mainstream-\ning and partial normalization of intimacy within the sex\ntrade. These developments are very different from the sex\nservices described by \"career sex workers\" who establish\npsychological barriers delineating what is for sale and what\nit private (O'Connell Davidson's, 1995), where certain inti-\nmate acts like kissing is off-limits. This is not to suggest that\nthere are no limits enacted by sex workers performing GFE,\nrather the encounter is not focused on solely the sexual\nrelease of the client but one that includes mutuality and a\ngenuine emotional experience.\nThe categorization of GFE in the field reports with the\nintention to quantify the emotional labor provided is so\ningrained in online communities that it is seen in almost\nevery field report alongside clients' evaluations on the sex\nworker's physical characteristics, attitude, and sexual perfor-\nmance. It should be noted that while many clients understand\nthe meaning of GFE, what it actually entails varies from indi-\nvidual to individual. To some clients, GFE could represent\npurely intimate physical acts (kissing, cuddling, oral sex on\nthe woman), whereas for others, it could mean the suspen-\nsion of time during the encounter for conversation and other\nnonphysical acts. Regardless of the definition, sex workers\nhave recognized the demand and have adapted their practice\nto take advantage of the demand for commodified intimacy\nin return for favorable reviews, which is translated into more\nclients and in turn better monetary gains (Earle & Sharp,\nintimacy as part of their service has increased the expecta-\ntions of the clients failing, which result in negative impres-\nsion of the sex worker affecting their demand (Bernstein,\nway is GFE separate from the economic dimensions of com-\nvides boundaries in which men are able to take advantage of\ntheir gender privilege to satisfy their demand for an intimate\nencounter through monetary exchange. Bernstein (2010) has\nreported that sex workers who attempt to breach the bound-\naries of \"bounded authenticity\" risk driving their clients\nreported clients experiencing \"off the clock\" activities with\ntheir regular sex worker such as extended time, sex without\npayment and public excursions; however, their study sug-\ngests the possibility of transcending the client\u00adsex worker\nbusiness relationship into a long-term romantic relationship\nor even a conventional relationship. The men in previous\nstudies have initiated relations with local sex workers, which\nbound them geographically thus reducing the amount of ano-\nnymity between the two parties. In this study, the imperma-\nnent state of the sex worker is a critical difference that is not\nexamined by previous studies.\nMethod\nThis study uses an ethnographic approach using face-to-face\ninterviews and participation observations. The semistructured\ninterviews conducted along with onsite participation observa-\ntion collected data on the participant's demographics, experi-\nences with commercial sex, specifically their relationship\nLim and Cheah 3\nwith a FSW. An online forum discussing commercial sex\nactivities in Malaysia was used as a secondary source of data.\nFifty participants were reached; however, only 23 participants\nfulfilled the requirement of the study, which required men\nwho were in or had been in a relationship with a FSW. The\nextent of the relationships ranged from going on multiple\ndates in public areas, to sexual sessions that occur outside the\nwork venue of the FSW and to living with their regular FSW.\nAll participants reported regular face-to-face and electronic\ncommunication, unpaid sexual encounters outside the sex\nestablishment, and had engaged in public social activity with\ntheir regular FSW. Although these factors do not necessarily\nconstitute a conventional relationship, it indicated that these\nmen attempted to transcend the boundaries of commercial\nsex. Racial composition of the 23 participants were 18\nChinese, two Malay, and three Indian; aged between 27 and\n46 years of age; 13 single, eight married, and two divorced.\nAll had a minimum diploma, professionals ranging from\nexecutive to managerial levels, from middle to upper socio-\neconomic group. Interviews took place between 2010 and\n2014, each interviewed over a number of sessions lasting\nbetween 2 and 3 hr. Participants' participation in this study\nwas voluntary and their identities confidential; names of the\nmen were changed in this article. They were also informed\nthat they could terminate or withdraw from the study at any\ntime. The interviews took place in a number of settings mostly\nin public areas where the men felt the most comfortable. The\ninterviews were transcribed and emailed to the participants to\nreview and verify its content.\nThe main problem I encountered was gaining access to this\nelusive group. Initially participants were recruited from an\nInternet forum where they had posted questions pertaining to\nhaving relations with a FSW. The forum chosen was a forum\nby Malaysians specifically on commercial sex activities in\nMalaysia. A thread within the forum where men were seeking\nadvice pertaining to relationships with sex workers or women\nof foreign nationalities provided a starting point for this study.\nRequest by Private Message (PM) for face-to-face interviews\nwas unsuccessful with only three agreeing to be interviewed,\nand none of the three participants provided additional con-\ntacts. Forum administrators and senior members held a signifi-\ncant amount reputation and respect; their assistance in this\nstudy was invaluable (see Williams & Lyons, 2008) as it\nallowed me to participate in a gathering of forum members in\na specified physical location, which provided an opportunity\nto gain face-to-face contact with members of this group.\nMethodological Concerns and\nLimitations\nIt was common that during the fieldwork, the participants\nwould decide on an impromptu visit to a brothel which I par-\nticipated in an attempt to integrate and gain the trust of the\ngroup. \"Going native\" was an issue which I had to tackle with\neach participation observation: the dilemma between gaining\nthe trust of the participants versus the potential risk of compro-\nmising the study. Many times, I was misidentified as a client or\nurged to buy a sex worker by the pimps and participants.\nProlonged contact with the group forced me to constantly\nrenegotiate the boundaries of researcher and participant; as\nnoted by Sanders (2006), the researchers'identities in this area\nare rarely clearly defined. This study forced me to constantly\nreevaluate my position as a researcher, my gender role, as well\nas my opinions on sex workers. Being male allowed me to\nintegrate myself into the group without the sexual harassment\nreported by female researchers (see Marttila, 2008; Peng,\nof problems; my refusal to participate set me apart from the\ngroup, and the men would in jest question my sexual orienta-\ntion and constantly test my resolve to truly understand their\nsituation. One participant said, \"if you really want to know,\nstep into our shoes and experience for yourself.\" This allowed\nme to experience firsthand the peer pressure experienced by\nmen visiting sex workers in a group as reported by Zheng\n(2006). Another problem was participant's initial instinctive\nreaction to maintain a masculine image and to \"safe face\"\nespecially when they were in a group or during the first meet-\ning, this resulted in initial narratives being superficial. Only in\nthe subsequent one-to-one interview was I able to gather\ndetailed descriptions of their relationships with a FSW along\nwith their feelings toward the relationship.\nA limitation in this study is the high ratio of Chinese men;\nthis was due in part to the sampling method and the polarized\nnature of Malaysian society. The senior members and the\nforum administrators who lent their assistance to this study\nwere all Chinese except for one Malay senior member, which\nled to a higher proportion of introductions to Chinese partici-\npants. Furthermore, some of the venues visited in this study\nwere averse to allowing Malay clients, fearing they could be\nundercover authorities. While the two respondents might not\nbe representative of the Malay community, it nonetheless\nallowed me to gain a glimpse into Malay mind-set.\nThe men interviewed in this study were either currently in\na relationship or have had previously been in a relationship\nwith a FSW; however, only seven out of the 23 men inter-\nviewed reported being currently involved with a FSW. The\nremaining 16 men were reiterating their past relationship\nexperiences with FSW; these men displayed regret and\nresentment for their failed relationship while illuminating is\nnonetheless clouded with the knowledge of hindsight. Five\nmen also reported having the relationship as long as 5 to 8\nyears ago; therefore, the accuracy of their recall may come\ninto question. I was, however, purview to examine the pur-\nsuit of four participants from the beginning to the end of their\nrelationship with a FSW.\nIntimate Encounters\nMajority of participants formed relations when they were\nnew to commercial sex; their surprise at the intimacy of the\n4 SAGE Open\nencounter and the FSW's pleasant attitude is a contrast to\ntheir stereotypical perceptions of the impersonal nature of\ncommercial sex; Loke, a 27-year-old sales executive, recalls\nhis first experience with a FSW:\nFirst time . . . was quite scary but yet exciting at the same time.\n. . . she was really friendly totally not what I expected. I thought\nit was all business but she would talk to you and try make you\nfeel more comfortable.\nSex workers who are able to put their clients at ease are able\nto mask the business nature of commercial sex and provide\nan intimate experience. This is vastly different from the por-\ntrayal by the Malaysian media of sex workers as cheap and\nimpersonal; Mun's perception of a sex worker was changed\nafter his first experience:\n. . . the normal image of a prostitute that you see in the movies\nand on TV are those that are waiting by the side of the street . . .\nthose arrested in dark and dodgy clubs . . . they [sex workers] are\nugly and unclean. But the prostitute was nothing at all like what\nI imagined, she was friendly and cheerful and very pretty. It was\ngreat coz she knew it was my first time and she just said to relax\nand she sat down and talked to me and just told me about how\nfirst timers were often nervous and we would just take it slow\nand easy no pressure.\nParticipants' experience with commercial sex challenges\ntheir preconceived ideas of sex workers as victims as por-\ntrayed by the Malaysian media; Mun describes his first expe-\nrience as \" . . . an intensely satisfying love-making session . . .\nwith a friendly and eager woman.\" First time clients tended\nto objectify sex workers, and their narratives focused solely\non sexual and the physical traits of the sex worker. However,\ntheir thoughts after their initial encounter are conflicted. On\none hand, they enjoy the pleasures and convenience of paid\nsex; on the other hand, the intimate encounter experienced\nmade it difficult to completely objectify FSWs. Mun's first\nexperience with a FSW forced him to consider the FSW as an\nindividual and not just a sex object:\n. . . I could not help but think of her as a person I just met and\nwe were talking about stuff. I used to think that prostitutes were\nrude and rough but . . . she speaks well and she's happy, smiling\nat me all the time. It was like a real person . . . I mean I know that\nshe is a real person but what I mean is that she is a real person\nthat I would have liked to meet and hang out with.\nMarshall (1999) noted that in commercial sex, the client is\nengaged in physical and emotional contact with a human\nbeing, which entails some form of mutuality making it\nimpossible to ignore their humanity.\nBeginning a Relationship\nThe result of the intimate encounter is the desire to repeat the\nexperience, resulting in increased intimacy which garners\nbetter sexual and nonsexual services (Milrod & Weitzer,\n2012). These \"extra\" services include extra shots, postcoital\nstimulation and affection, body to body massages, sex toys,\nanal sex, and in the most extreme cases, unprotected sex.\nKong, a 34-year-old executive, was introduced to commer-\ncial sex by peers and his relationship began initially because\nof the service provided:\nHer service was good that's why I continued to visit her. After\nmy 3rd visit she offered me a second shot which I gladly\naccepted. Initially it was about the extras which I got for free but\nafter a while we would just land up talking and cuddling, kissing\n. . . it was like having a real girlfriend. I learnt that she came here\nto make some money and start a business when she returned to\nChina, . . . of course I still took the extras, she trusted me enough\nto bring out her personal sex toys to play . . . that is the benefits\nof going back to one girl.\nAll participants had relationships with FSWs working in the\nmid-tier sector. The mid-tier sex sector in Malaysia consists\nmainly of indoor establishments operating behind the fa\u00e7ade\nof legitimate businesses such as hotels, karaokes, and mas-\nsage parlors in an attempt to avoid attention from the authori-\nties (Lim, 1998). Each establishment had different operating\nprocedures aimed at deterring authorities, many hotels used\nhealth spas as a cover for commercial sex activities, while\nother hotels had designated floors where FSWs lived and ser-\nviced their clients. FSWs would be given their own rooms in\nthe hotel; participants reported that the rooms contained\nFSW's personal artifacts, which according to the participants\nmade the experience more \"real.\" The four participants\nwhom I had followed from beginning to the end of their rela-\ntionship began their relationship with their regular FSW in\nsuch a setting. This setting also provided FSWs some flexi-\nbility to extend their sessions during low peak hours, which\nallowed for the possibility of more intimate encounters.\nMilrod and Weitzer's (2012) reported that men start out with-\nout expecting anything from their encounters with their sex\nworker but gradually develop intimate connections akin to a\nconventional relationship. Many participants reported being\nmotivated by the \"excellent\" service; however, with each\nsubsequent encounter, they began to develop unexpected\nemotional ties to their regular FSW. Chris, a 30-year-old\nMalay executive, developed a relationship with his regular\nbecause of the combination of highly sexual and nonsexual\nintimate acts:\n. . . her service was amazing. She really loved having sex. . . .\nvery different from my ex. And it was not like she was slutty, she\nwas actually quite shy. You could see this after sex where she\nwould just cover up and cuddle. People say that prostitutes are\nwhores who just love sex but she was different . . . she spoke\nsoftly and was gentle. . . . before I knew it I was visiting her over\nand over . . . she suggested meeting outside, which I agreed.\nClient's desire for more intense displays of intimacy makes\nthem susceptible to believing the affections displayed by\nLim and Cheah 5\nFSW is genuine, and the sessions become what Milrod and\nWeitzer (2012) called \"quasidating\" where the client and\ntheir regular sex worker act out relationship scripts of an\nactual date, such as learning about each other's background\nthrough prolonged verbal and physical intimacy. Wan, a\n33-year-old Malay executive, reported increased interest in\nhis regular's personality and background after a number of\nvisits:\nAt first it was good service with cuddling then it became \"When\nam I going to see you again?\" . . . at the peak I was visiting her\ntwice, three times a week . . . sometimes for double sessions. . . .\nyou can't be having sex all the time. Of course I try to have as\nmuch as possible but we would talk during the breaks . . . the\nbreaks became longer and longer. . . . she was a really nice\nperson, very witty and interesting, what surprised me was\ndespite all the hardship she experienced she still managed to\nkeep a positive outlook on life.\nThe men who have become regular clients had obtained their\nFSW's phone number, Wechat, or Whatsapp number; mak-\ning communication with their regulars is no longer solely\ndependent on physical visits, allowing for greater freedom\nand more personal connections to be formed beyond the\nphysical constrains of the FSWs work establishment.\nDissatisfaction and Placing Blame\nScholars have suggested that clients are attracted by intimacy\nprovided by sex workers because of lack of affection in their\npersonal lives, whether it is because of their inability or\nunwillingness to form conventional relationships (Mansson,\npants' narratives center on the willingness of their regular\nFSW to provide boundless sexual and nonsexual affections\nthat they compare with their current partners, revealing their\ndissatisfaction with their partner as well as their conserva-\ntive, misogynist mind-set:\nFoo: My wife could learn a thing or two from these women . . .\nlike how to treat a man so that he feels like he matters. . . .\nwomen always talk about men doing their share. It is ironic that\nthey do not do their share.\nRosh: My girlfriend makes me work for her affections, it is\ntotally different with Fann [FSW], she is always willing, . . . I\nthink that is the problem with Malaysian women they are\nbecoming like Singaporeans.\nParticipants' narratives on the materialistic and demanding\nnature of Malaysian women stem from their reluctance to\nadapt to changing gender roles brought on by the rapid social\nand economic development. Malaysian Chinese women\nhave benefitted most significantly from these changes result-\ning in higher education and better jobs, coupled with their\nadoption of feminist ideals and a focus on career coupled\nwith their adherence to ingrained traditional dictates of\n\"suitable partners\" has led to a trend in delayed and nonmar-\ntance to adapt to these developments has made it difficult for\nsome of them to obtain \"suitable\" partners, increasing their\nscorn for Malaysian Chinese women. Their problem in finding\na suitable partner is made more difficult by racial fencing leg-\nislation in Malaysia that prohibits Muslim\u00adnon-Muslim mar-\nriages (Mohamad, 2010), thus limiting potential partners to\nnon-Malay women. The desire for more feminine and submis-\nsive partner has some participants falling for FSWs believing\nthey are \"untainted\" by modern society (Mansson, 2006).\nMalaysian policies that focus on Muslims, seen in the\ncase of Wan who's attraction for local Chinese women, has\nresulted with constant failure, due in part to the prohibition\nof Muslim\u00adnon-Muslim marriages. Unlike the Malaysian\nChinese community that has largely been ignored, the\nMalaysian government has placed great interest over the\nMalay community's sexuality, primarily as a political tool to\nconsolidate and maintain their power (see Mohamad, 2010).\nThis has most significantly affected the Malay women where\nconflict arising from their education and exposure to modern\nideals clash with the religious doctrines preached by the\nMalaysian authorities. A study by Ong (1990) shows the\nimmense social pressure experienced by Malay women to\nconform to their expected roles has resulted in many Malay\nwomen succumbing to the pressure. The Malaysian govern-\nment emphasizes on Islamic teachings and values that\nemphasizes the Malay women's central role in the family\n(Ong, 1990). Hence, there is a greater desire for marriage and\na fear of being priced out of marriage because of their higher\neducation and career among the Malay women, which is\nnoticeable because Malay women are more willing to marry\ndownwards compared with their Chinese counterparts (Tey,\n2007). This has resulted in Malay women conforming to\nexpected gender roles, which has led to less friction between\ngenders in the Malay community, as seen in the Malay par-\nticipants of this study who did not display the level of resent-\nment toward Malay women compared with the Chinese\nparticipants.\nRisky Relationships\nMost of the participants and forum members recognize the\nslim chance of success in forming long-term relations with\nFSWs. Warnings by forum members revolve around the\ninterest of FSWs in monetary gains, believing that the inti-\nmacy is manufactured performances to eliciting favorable\nresponse from their clients:\n. . . man is trading money for sex & warmth & the [FSW] is\ntrading sex for money, simple as that. There is no such thing as\nlove with a [FSW]. The moment the money ends, the so-called\nlove also ends!\nStudies have shown that sex workers do manufacture separate\nidentities as part of their strategy to illicit positive reviews\n6 SAGE Open\nand to cope and control their work environment (see; Brewis\n2005). Participants report that FSWs use tragedy and misfor-\ntune to gain sympathy from their clients. Studies have shown\nthat while some FSWs do enter the sex trade because of pov-\nerty and lack of choice, not all come from improvised or\nuneducated backgrounds, some sex workers come from mid-\ndle-class families with no financial problems (see Hoang,\nnot solely because of poverty or the lack of jobs but rather a\nHan, & Zhao, 1996). Forum members claim that these women\nchoose to work in Malaysia because of lesser competition and\nthe ability to resume a \"normal\" life back in their home coun-\nDespite the warnings, some men willingly enter into a\nrelationship with a FSW; findings from this study indicate\nthat men who are new (involvement in commercial sex is\nless than 6 months) to the sex trade are the most susceptible\nto forming emotional attachments to their regulars. Analysis\nof postings on the online forum reveal that not all forum\nmembers are totally against the idea of forming relation-\nships; common themes of being human and second chances\nfeature regularly:\n[FSW] is also a woman and I am sure she has her own reason of\njoining the flesh trade. She deserve a second chance . . .\n. . . a lot of us have bad impression about [FSW] . . . However,\nthey are still human, they have feelings as well. When the feeling\ndeveloped, they are no other than ordinary woman who wants to\nbe loved and cared for.\nParticipants were aware of their risky endeavor and used\nconventional courtship rituals as a tool to gauge the sincerity\nof their regular FSW; gifts and \"dates\" instead of cash is used\nto profess their romantic intentions as well as to gauge their\nFSW's interest in material gains. Participants rationalize that\nFSWs who are overly interested in monetary gains are insin-\ncere, whereas displays of concern over the men's financial\nwelfare are proof of genuine commitment, as seen in the case\nof Ray who formed a 6-month relationship that continued for\nanother 3 months after his regular FSW left Malaysia:\n. . . she never asked for anything. She always just said that it was\nenough that I spend my hard earned money visiting a girls like\nher and that she was happy with the time we were together. . . .\nwhen I did give her extra she would not refuse but just take it\nand look away. It was those little things she did that convinced\nme of her sincerity . . .\nIronically, once participants were convinced of FSW's sin-\ncerity, monetary exchange played a larger role in their narra-\ntives. Ngah says that his \"girlfriend\" never directly asked\nhim for money, rather he volunteered to help out with her\nfinancial problems because he did not want to see her\nworking so hard; Chris felt his relationship with his regular\nimproved greatly after he helped her with her family's finan-\ncial problems; Mun gave RM10,000 to help his FSW's moth-\ner's medical bills; according to him, she did not ask for the\nmoney, rather she said that she had to work doubly hard and\ncould not take time away to be with him; Ray continued to\nsend money to his regular after she returned to China with a\npromise to return as soon as her family affairs was in order;\naccording to Ray, she decided to enter the sex trade to help\nher family especially her mother who struggled to support\nher family because of her \"useless\" father. Hoang's (2010)\nstudy on mid-tier Vietnamese sex workers suggest that deep\nacting by sex workers allowed them to capitalize on their\norigins to create an imaginary fantasy world where their cli-\nents live in as heroes or saviors to these poor, unfortunate\nwomen.\nConflicting Emotions\nAll participants anticipated problems arising from family,\npeers, and society; while they initially thought they were pre-\npared for the repercussions, findings from this study showed\nthat they underestimated the amount of pressure experienced\nbecause of their highly stigmatized relationship; approxi-\nmately half of the participants reported intense pressure by\nfamily and peers as a cause for the termination of the rela-\ntionship. Leong's relationship with a FSW lasted only 3\nmonths; when he ignored the advice from friends, his friends\ninformed his family members about his relationship with a\nFSW which led to heated argument and threats to disown\nhim if he continued with the relationship:\nMy friends thought I was just crazy. They continuously pointed\nout the problems with the relationship and how it would never\nwork . . . I began avoiding them. . . . I knew I had to choose\nbetween my friends and my \"girlfriend\" and I choose her. . . . the\nreal problem came when my family got word of my \"girlfriend's\"\nbackground. . . . friends can ignore. Family cannot. . . . she\nunderstood my situation she's Chinese too. . . . until now I feel\nthat it was my lack of courage that ended the relationship.\nLeong's case is unique because of the involvement of his\nfamily; all other participants kept their relationship with their\nFSW away from their families, only revealing their relation-\nship to like-minded peers believing that they would better\nunderstand their situation; this, however, was not the case.\nNgah's peers felt that he was being irrational and illogical to\nrisk his marriage for a relationship with a FSW and they\nbegan avoiding him to distance themselves from the fallout\nof the inevitable failure of the relationship. However, Ngah\ncontinued his relationship with his FSW until she left him to\nreturn to China; for some participants, their voluntary isola-\ntion from family and friends leave them little choice but to\npursue the relationship to its bitter end, leaving some like\nChris regretful of their decisions: \" . . . savings gone, and\nnothing to show for it. . . . Never will I fall for the trap of\nLim and Cheah 7\nthese women, . . . it is true what people say it is all about how\nmuch money they can get.\" Not all participants regret their\nrelationship, instead they report positive personal develop-\nment as a result of their failed relationship; Ngah's fulfill-\nment of his deeply rooted desire for his \"ideal\" woman\njustified his relationship:\nYou must understand I was living the dream that I never had\nwhen I was younger. It felt fantastic walking with a hot chick in\nthe shopping mall, going for movies and stuff. You feel like a\ntotal stud. My friends were laughing at me but I'm the one\nfucking this hot ass.\nNgah's relationship served to boost and reinforced his mas-\nculine self-image. Ray was disappointed by the sudden loss\nof contact even though he knew it was unlikely to go the\ndistance; his narratives attempt to justify his \"poor\" decision\nthrough his monetary contributions and playing up his role as\nher savior in time of need:\n. . . friends say I'm stupid. Sometimes I feel they are right but I\nalso know that I helped her in her time of need. . . . at least I\nknow I did some good.\nOthers like Wan who was involved with a FSW for 3 months\nviewed his experience in a positive manner even though his\nrelationship with his regular FSW ended when she returned\nto her home country:\nFirstly I would not be married now . . . I realized [through my\nrelationship with my FSW] that all women are in it for the\nmoney. . . . she made me realize that to a woman security is what\nmatters, in the past I would have never thought that I would\nagree to marriage setup by my parents. . . . but if I can love a\nFSW I'm sure that I can learn to love my wife.\nWan's deference to the selection of a partner by his par-\nents suggests a greater compliance with familiar pressures\nand traditional marriage arrangement although highly\nuncommon but still accepted by the Malay community.\nPushing the Boundaries\nAlthough all participants use the personal information they\nhave obtained from their regular FSW as proof of their inti-\nmate relationship not all are genuinely interested in pursuing\na long-term relationship (see Mansson, 2006; McKeganey &\nold business owner, reported having relations with two\nFSWs, and his narratives began with themes revolving\naround affection and intimacy; however, when his regular\nbegan demanding more time and commitment, he committed\nto the role knowing that it would eventually end. Huang's\nstrategy takes advantage of the impermanent nature of FSWs:\n\"It was like a real relationship except the sex was better. . . .\nIt ended when she returned to China. . . . now I have another\n`girlfriend.' One leaves another arrives, that's the beauty of\n[FSWs].\" For Yann, the excitement of the relationship with\nhis regular FSW is how far he can push the boundaries of\ncommercial sex while still operating within the provision of\n\"bounded authenticity\":\n. . . when you have gotten their trust it is easy to get better\nservice. By service I don't just mean more \"action\" but it is the\npersonal connection. . . . something you cannot get by just\nvisiting a spa, let me put it this way have you ever had a girl iron\nyour clothes in the nude.\nWhen queried about whose idea it was to get her to iron his\nclothes, his reply was that she wanted to do it herself seeing\nas how they had intercourse with their clothes on and he had\nto go for a meeting later on. Yann's relationship with his reg-\nular FSW leaves him feeling virile, attractive, and powerful;\n\" . . . no one knows she is a [sex worker] for all anyone else\nknows she is my girlfriend. . . . considering what we do and\nwhat I know about her she is my `girlfriend.'\" Yann uses his\nrelationship as a playground where women not only conform\nto traditional gender roles but also are highly sexual.\nConclusion\nThe conditions that exist in Malaysia varies greatly from\nother studies where legislation that drives sex trade under-\nground and transitory nature of FSWs has resulted in greater\ninequality in power between FSWs and clients making a\n\"genuine\" long-term relationship highly unlikely. Although\nSanders (2008b) suggested commercial sex does not neces-\nsarily result in corruptive, abusive, exploitation of either\nparty, in this study, the sex worker\u00adclient relationships often\nend with the exploitation of one or both parties.\nClients who involve themselves with FSWs suspending\ntheir positions of power take great risk for a chance at \"love.\"\nIt is unsurprising that participants report they do not feel that\ntheir position offers any form of privilege when dealing with\nFSWs. They feel that they are exposed to similar, if not more\nvulnerable, situation as their FSWs; their role as client is ille-\ngal and is not afforded any form of protection if caught.\nParticipants' narratives attempt to project an image of being\n\"victimized\" as a means to deflect their relationship failure\nwith FSWs which would result in ridicule and negative self-\nimage (Worchel, 1984). These findings are parallel to that\nreported by Bernstein (2010) where sex workers attempting\nto transgress the preset boundaries are met with negative\nrepercussions; in this study, it is the clients who are \"pun-\nished.\" Findings in this study are similar to that reported by\nMilrod and Weitzer (2012) where participants in a relation-\nship with FSWs struggle to gauge the authenticity of the inti-\nmacy and commitment of their regular FSW to the\nrelationship. Some participants adopt a strategy which takes\nadvantage of the limited time FSWs have in Malaysia push-\ning the boundaries of \"bounded authenticity\" by having\n8 SAGE Open\nshort-term relationships that mirror conventional relation-\nship, which suggests a commodification intimacy that lies\nsomewhere in between \"bounded authenticity\" and the\nboundary-breaking relationship suggested by Milrod and\nWeitzer. The conditions which FSWs operate in Malaysia is\nsignificantly different and while participants display cues of\na conventional relationship, the relationship is constrained\nby the transitory nature of the FSWs which prevents it from\nmanifesting into a truly genuine long-term conventional\nrelationship.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBernstein, E.
