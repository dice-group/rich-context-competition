Yet, there is variability in these seemingly\ninevitable changes. Understanding why this variability\nexists and attempting to identify the factors that determine\nwhy some people age well and others do not has demanded\ninnovation from aging researchers interested in psychophys-\niology. For years, self-reported measures of physical health\ndominated biopsychosocial data collection, and such mea-\nsures continue to garner important information regarding\nthe association between psychological and physical health\nacross adulthood. Certain questions, however, cannot be\nanswered with self-reported measures alone and, instead,\nrequire the collection of physiological data. To this end,\nbiomarkers that reflect underlying physiological processes\nare being utilized in several research laboratories that focus\non stress, health, and aging.\nA biomarker is defined as a biological indicator--such as\nblood or saliva--that reflects underlying physiological pro-\ncesses, including both normative processes and pathogenic\nstates (Baum & Grunberg, 1997). For example, elevated\nblood pressure is a biomarker of cardiovascular disease,\nelevated proinflammatory cytokines are biomarkers of\ninflammation, and elevated body temperature is a biomarker\nof infection. Biomarker assessments have become increas-\ningly popular among behavioral and social aging research-\ners as a way to connect behavioral, environmental, and\nsocial factors to an individual's health and well-being\n(Gruenewald & Kemeny, 2007). In fact, the National Institutes\nof Health encourages research that assesses multiple behav-\nioral and psychosocial pathways to health and well-being--\na task that requires an integration of biological and social\nscience (Singer & Ryff, 2001). Biomarkers play a pivotal\nrole in this journey, and the goal of this article is to provide\nresearchers with an understanding of how biomarkers in-\nform research on stress, health, and aging.\nThis article is divided into three broad sections. In the\nfirst section, we discuss how stressors of different domains\nmay affect physical health. In the second section, we review\nthree systems closely implicated in stress functioning (i.e.,\nthe sympathetic\u00adadrenal\u00admedullary [SAM] axis, the hypo-\nthalamic\u00adpituitary\u00adadrenal [HPA] axis, and the immune\nsystem) and discuss normative age-related changes that\noccur in each system. Page restrictions prohibit an exhaus-\ntive review of the literature, so we provide tables that describe\nthe function and age-related changes of specific biomarkers\nand refer the reader to resources mentioned in text for more\ndetailed information. In this section, we also address the\nimpact psychological stress has on these systems and how it\nmay accelerate age-related physical health declines. In the\nlast section, we discuss the future of biomarkers and pro-\npose that researchers studying stress, health, and aging take\na multivariate and dynamic approach.\nStressor Domains: Life Events, Chronic\nStressors, and Daily Hassles\nThere are two major approaches to examining the inter-\nrelationships between stress, health, and aging. The first\napproach focuses on major life events that are relatively rare\nin their occurrence and that require significant life adjust-\nments, such as divorce or the death of a spouse (e.g., Dohren-\nThe second approach focuses on everyday events, or quo-\ntidian stressors (Almeida, 2005; Bolger, Davis, & Rafaeli,\nchronic stressors and daily hassles.

Klein\nDepartment of Human Development and Family Studies, Pennsylvania State University, University Park.\nAssessment of biomarkers that reflect objective indicators of physiological processes has become increasingly\npopular in psychological research on stress and aging. The current article reviews biomarkers of the neuroendocrine\nand immune systems, including issues related to measurement and normative age-related changes. We also discuss\nhow exposure to stressors can provoke changes in these biomarkers and propose that stressful experiences may\naccelerate age-related declines in these systems. We recommend that future research examining physical health\nand aging incorporate dynamic and multivariate methods for assessing links between stressors and biomarkers.\nKey Words: Aging--Allostatic load--Daily diary--Hypothalamic\u00adpituitary\u00adadrenal axis--Immune system--Stress--\nSympathetic\u00adadrenal\u00admedullary axis.\nrefer to ongoing persistent situations, such as caregiving for\nan ill spouse, daily stressors refer to minor events that arise\nfrom day-to-day living, such as meeting work deadlines\n(see review by Almeida, Piazza, Stawski, & Klein, in press).\nThe mechanisms through which different types of stressors\nexert an effect on health vary, with life events associated\nwith prolonged arousal and daily stressors associated with\nspikes in arousal (Almeida et al.). Not surprisingly, how-\never, these constructs overlap. Take, for instance, the ex-\nample of spousal caregiving. In this situation, a life\nevent--that is, one's spouse being diagnosed with an ill-\nness--leads to the chronic stress of caregiving, which, in\nturn, results in increased exposure to daily stressors related\nto caregiving responsibilities. Indeed, many researchers\nsuggest that it is the interaction and accumulation of stres-\nsors that lead to poor health outcomes over time (e.g.,\nIn and of itself, the stress response does not lead to ad-\nverse health outcomes; rather, it protects an organism from\nharm by increasing alertness, mobilizing energy, and pro-\ntecting against pathogens. Each time the stress response is\nactivated, however, physiological adjustments must be\nmade, and over time, these adjustments may lead to cumu-\nlative wear and tear (McEwen, 1998). Exposure to stressors\nmay, therefore, accelerate the aging process, particularly\nwhen this exposure occurs in later adulthood, as physiolog-\nical systems are already compromised. In the following sec-\ntion, we discuss this view in greater detail and also provide\nan overview of the biomarkers implicated in the stress\nresponse.\nThe SAM Axis, the HPA Axis, and the Immune\nSystem: A Brief Review\nSAM Axis\nCannon (1914) was the first to describe hormones as bio-\nmarkers of stress when he detailed the physiological \"fight-\nor-flight\" response (Cannon, 1932; Cannon, Britton, Lewis, &\nGroeneveld, 1927). The fight-or-flight response begins\nwith the activation of the sympathetic (SNS) branch of the\nautonomic nervous system (see Figure 1), which stimulates\nthe release of the catecholamines, epinephrine (EPI) and\nnorepinephrine (NE), from sympathetic neurons and the\nadrenal medulla (for review, see Klein & Corwin, 2007);\nthis SNS-stimulated release of EPI and NE from the adrenal\nmedulla is also known as the SAM axis. Effects of EPI and\nNE include decreased blood flow to the organs of the gas-\ntrointestinal tract, the skin, and the kidneys, which ensures\nmaximum blood flow to the brain, heart, and skeletal\nmuscles when a stressor is encountered.\nTable 1 provides a description of several biomarkers of\nthe SAM axis. Circulating or excreted levels of EPI and\nNE are the primary biomarkers of SAM axis activity\n(Baum & Grunberg, 1997) and can be measured reliably in\nurine, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid samples. Circulating\ncatecholamines are metabolized quickly (within 1\u00ad3 min)\nand indicate immediate changes in SAM axis activation.\nThe invasive nature of blood sampling, as well as the short\nhalf-life and high frequency of pulse-like fluctuations in\ncatecholamines, make it challenging to track circulating\ncatecholamines outside of the laboratory. Analysis of urine\nprovides a relatively noninvasive measure of catecholamine\nlevels, and home collection of urine by participants has\nbeen used successfully in many field studies of chronic\nstress (e.g., Baum, Gatchel, & Schaeffer, 1983; Cohen,\nDoyle, & Baum, 2006; Lundberg & Frankenhaeuser,\n1999). Because catecholamines are secreted slowly (over\nhours) while the bladder fills, however, urinary cate-\ncholamine assessments provide a relatively static index of\nSAM axis activity, which makes it difficult to examine the\nimpact of stressor onset and cessation (Baum & Grunberg;\nA rapidly growing literature suggests that the salivary en-\nzyme a-amylase (sAA) can serve as a minimally invasive\nsurrogate marker of SNS activity (for reviews, see Granger,\nKivlighan, El-Sheikh, Gordis, & Stroud, 2007; Nater &\nRohleder, 2009). The rationale is that catecholamine release\nin response to SNS activation stimulates salivary gland re-\nceptors that, in turn, alter activity of these glands (Nederfors\n& Dahlof, 1992). Although the main function of sAA is the\nenzymatic digestion of carbohydrates (Rohleder & Nater,\n2009), sAA appears to be a viable surrogate marker of SAM\naxis activation, as it parallels stress-related increases in NE\n5\u00ad10 min after NE release (Rohleder, Nater, Wolf, Ehlert, &\nKirschbaum, 2004). With regard to diurnal patterns, sAA\nexhibits moderately low levels upon awakening, drops\nbriefly at 30-min post-awakening and increases gradually\nthroughout the day (Nater, Rohleder, Schlotz, Ehlert, &\nAge Differences and Changes in SAM Axis Functioning\nA number of normative age-related changes occur in the\ncardiovascular and sympathetic nervous systems, partly\ndue to changes in SAM axis functioning (for reviews, see\nCrimmins, Vasunilashorn, Kim, & Alley, 2008; Uchino,\nBirmingham, & Berg, 2010). Systolic and diastolic blood\npressure gradually increases across the adult life span until\napproximately age 70 years, at which time the increase ap-\npears to cease. Resting heart rate remains relatively stable\nacross adulthood, whereas maximum heart rate gradually\ndecreases (Uchino et al.). In response to acute psychosocial\nstressors, older age is associated with increased systolic\nblood pressure and modest increases in diastolic blood\npressure (Uchino, Holt-Lunstad, Bloor, & Campo, 2005;\nUchino et al.). In contrast, heart rate response to physical\nexercise and psychosocial stressors is attenuated in older\nage (for review, see Ferrari, Radaelli, & Centola, 2003).\nFigure 1.

Of those that have, age appears to be associ-\nated with higher average NE levels (e.g., Barnes, Raskind,\nincrease that may occur due to age-related increases in\nbasal sympathetic NE activity and reduced metabolic clear-\nance (i.e., neuronal reuptake) of NE among older adults\n(Seals & Esler, 2000). In contrast, basal EPI activity is\nreduced in older age (e.g., Esler et al., 1995), but lower\nlevels are not always evident because of reduced clearance\nof EPI in later adulthood (Seals & Esler). Older age is gen-\nerally associated with higher NE reactivity to stressors\n(Barnes et al.; Palmer, Ziegler, & Lake, 1978) and possibly\nlower EPI reactivity to stressors (e.g., Esler et al.). Not all\nstudies illustrate these patterns, however (e.g., Lindheim et\nal., 1992), and an examination of individual differences may\nhelp to elucidate these results. In addition, the diurnal in-\ncrease and deceleration of the diurnal increase of sAA are\nattenuated from young adulthood to midlife (Nater et al.,\n2007), though recent studies suggest no age differences in\nbasal sAA levels (for review, see Rohleder & Nater, 2009).\nPsychological Stress and the SAM Axis\nAs previously described, the SAM axis is the body's\nprimary physiological response to acute stressors (for\nreview, see Klein & Corwin, 2007). Following the experience\nof a stressor, NE slows digestion and gastrointestinal motility,\nincreases plasma glucose levels, and dilates pupils, whereas\nEPI increases heart rate and cardiac contractility, relaxes\nsmooth muscle, and increases blood pressure and glucose re-\nlease. The rise in catecholamine levels depends on stressor\nseverity, doubling in their resting levels during daily activi-\nties, and rising to three to five times their resting levels during\nmoderately severe stressors (for review, see Frankenhaeuser,\n1971). Other important determinants of SAM axis reactivity\nare various stressor characteristics, such as stressor control-\nlability, pleasantness, uncertainty, and elicitation of fear or\nAs stressors increase in chronicity, the frequency and length\nof sympathetic activation also increases, possibly resulting in\ntissue damage. Several studies indicate that the effect of\nchronic stressors on the SAM axis resembles age-related\nchanges, as evidenced by higher diastolic blood pressure\n(Jeckel et al., 2010), higher blood pressure reactivity (Chida\nand blunted diurnal profiles of NE (Fujiwara et al., 2004;\nHawk, Dougall, Ursano, & Baum, 2000), EPI (Hawk et al.),\nand sAA (Nater et al., 2007; Rohleder, Marin, Ma, & Miller,\n2009) among people experiencing elevated levels of chronic\nor perceived stress.\nHPA Axis\nWhereas SAM axis activation is designed for an immedi-\nate response to threat, HPA axis activation is a longer-term\nhormonal response that is observed approximately 15\u00ad20\nmin following stressor onset (see review by Dickerson &\nKemeny, 2004). Once a stressor is perceived by the cerebral\ncortex, it alerts the neurons of the paraventricular nucleus of\nthe hypothalamus to release corticotrophin-releasing hor-\nmone (CRH) into the hypothalamic\u00adpituitary portal blood\nflow system. CRH travels to the pituitary gland, where it\nstimulates the release of the adrenocorticotropin hormone\n(ACTH), as well as arginine vasopressin (AVP). Although\nAVP acts centrally to support the fight-or-flight response,\nACTH circulates to the cortex of the adrenal glands to stim-\nulate glucocorticoid release, including corticosteroids (e.g.,\ncortisol) (for reviews, see Klein & Corwin, 2007; Taylor\net al., 2000). Corticosteroids themselves regulate contin-\nued HPA axis function through a negative feedback loop\nby dampening further CRH release from the hypothala-\nmus and ACTH release from the anterior pituitary gland.\nUltimately, cortisol mobilizes energy stores, serves as an\nanti-inflammatory hormone, and communicates with the\nimmune system (Chrousos & Gold, 1992; for review, see\nDickerson & Kemeny).\nThe primary biomarkers of the HPA axis include CRH,\nACTH,cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate(DHEA-S)\nand its unsulfated form DHEA, andAVP (see Table 2). CRH\nis measured in cerebrospinal fluid, which means that this\nbiomarker must be measured in controlled clinical settings.\nIn contrast, ACTH, cortisol, and AVP can be assessed in\nblood, and unbound levels of cortisol can be measured in\nsaliva. The ease of the salivary collection, in conjunction\nwith cortisol's predictable diurnal pattern--peaking 30\u00ad45\nmin after awakening and gradually decreasing throughout\nthe day (e.g., Van Cauter, Leproult, & Kupfer, 1996)--have\nmade it possible for researchers to include this hormone as\na biomarker across a number of laboratory (for reviews,\nsee Dickerson and Kemeny, 2004; Hellhammer, W\u00fcst, &\nKudielka, 2009) and field studies (e.g., Almeida, Piazza &\nWhereas cortisol is a catabolic hormone, DHEA-S is an\nanabolic hormone that is thought to be coreleased with cor-\ntisol (Granger & Kivlighan, 2003). DHEA-S and its unsul-\nfated form, DHEA, are bioactive, work similarly in the body\n(Montanini et al., 1988), and can be assayed in cerebrospi-\nnal fluid, blood, urine, or saliva. Secreted primarily from the\nadrenal cortex in women and men, as well as from the testes\nin men, DHEA-S/DHEA is similar to cortisol in that it is\nreleased in response to ACTH stimulation as part of the\nHPA axis, making it a potential moderator of the HPA axis\nresponse to stress (Roberts, 1999). Similar to cortisol,\nDHEA-S levels are highest in the morning and decline\nthroughout the day (Hucklebridge, Hussain, Evans, & Clow,\nAge Differences and Changes in HPA Axis Functioning\nTable 2 lists some of the age-associated changes that\noccur in the HPA axis. Increasing age is associated with\nhigher mean cortisol levels, a disruption of the negative\nfeedback loop, and a relatively flat diurnal pattern (for re-\nviews, see Chahal & Drake, 2007; Epel, Burke, & Wolkowitz,\n2007). With age, cortisol appears to exhibit an attenuated\nawakening response (e.g., Kudielka & Kirschbaum, 2003;Van\n2000) and a less steep decline in the evening hours, resulting\nin a higher nadir (Deuschle et al., 1997; Van Cauter et al.).\nSeveral studies also suggest that age is associated with\ngreater HPA axis reactivity to stressors (e.g., Otte et al.,\ncase (e.g., Kudielka, Schmidt-Reinwald, Hellhammer,\nSchurmeyer, & Kirschbaum, 2000; Nicolson, Storms,\nPonds, & Sulon, 1996). More research is needed to ascer-\ntain age differences in DHEA-S/DHEA, but some studies\nsuggest that levels steadily decline from early (i.e., 20\u00ad30\nyears old) to later adulthood (i.e., 70\u00ad80 years old) (Labrie,\nBelanger, Cusan, Gomez, & Candas, 1997).\nPsychological Stress and the HPA Axis\nHPA axis activation is adaptive in the short term, but\nrepeated or prolonged activation can have detrimental ef-\nfects on health, and lead to a dysregulation of the nega-\ntive feedback loop. Specifically, prolonged exposure to\nstressors appears to uncouple cortisol from its ability to\ninhibit further CRH and ACTH secretion, which leads to\nan overproduction of cortisol (Dickerson & Kemeny,\n2004). Elevations in cortisol, in turn, are associated with\nchronic health problems, psychological disorders, and\nproblems with memory, learning, and attention (Sapolsky,\nThe changes that occur in the HPA axis as a result of ex-\nposure to chronic stressors appear to be similar to the\nchanges that occur during the aging process. For example,\nthe experience of trauma, persistent or chronic stressors, or\nstressors of high magnitude are associated with greater\ncortisol and ACTH reactivity (Rasmusson et al., 2004), a\nblunted diurnal rhythm of salivary cortisol (Adam &\nSeltzer et al., 2009), lower evening DHEA levels (van\nNiekerk, Huppert, & Herbert, 2001), and lower overall\nDHEA-S levels (Jeckel et al., 2010), although there are\nexceptions to these findings (e.g., Miller et al., 2009;\nThe Immune System\nJust as the SAM and HPA axes are essential to the stress\nresponse, so too is the immune system. The immune system\nprotects the body from a variety of internal (e.g., defective\ncells) and external threats (e.g., bacteria) by destroying\npathogens. It comprises two interrelated branches referred\nto as innate and adaptive immunity. The innate branch of the\nimmune system provides the first line of defense against in-\nfection and includes cells and proteins that are nonspecific\nto particular antigens and include--but are not limited to--\nnatural killer (NK) cells, phagocytes, and complement.\nBecause of their nonspecificity, these cells and proteins are\nthe first to mount a defense against pathogens. They also\ntrigger a response by the adaptive branch of the immune\nsystem via cytokine communication. The adaptive branch\ncreates antigen-specific immunity; therefore, it responds to\nTable 2.

During initial antigen exposure, this\nbranch responds by developing lymphocytes with a high de-\ngree of specificity and \"memory\" for the challenge, so that\nif the pathogen returns, a subset of lymphocytes can respond\nmore rapidly. The adaptive branch consists of two major\ngroups of cells: lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells.\nThe two major populations of lymphocytes are T lympho-\ncytes, which are responsible for the antigen-specific killing\nof infected cells, and B lymphocytes, which are responsible\nfor the mass production of antigen-specific antibodies. Be-\ncause the innate and adaptive branches work in tandem,\ndecrements in one branch can compromise the efficacy of\nthe other (for reviews, see Bauer, Jeckel, & Luz, 2009;\nGraham, Christian, & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2006; Segerstrom &\nMiller, 2004).

Yet, over the last century, life expectancy has\nnearly doubled (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\nNational Center for Health Statistics, 2007), and the result-\ning health implications of a less than optimal immune sys-\ntem are apparent. Consequences of immunosenescence\ninclude higher rates of most illnesses, including cancer\n(Huang, Patel, & Manton, 2005), osteoporosis and arthritis\n(Aw et al.), increased susceptibility to infectious disease\n(Weiskopf, Weinberger, & Grubeck-Loebenstein, 2009),\nand less efficacious responses to vaccinations (Kovaiou,\nHerndler-Brandstetter, & Grubeck-Loebenstein, 2007).\nDespite the known health consequences of immunosenes-\ncence, the study of immune biomarkers in aging research\nhas developed relatively recently (see review by Graham\net al., 2006) and suggests that there are certain biomarkers\nimplicated in immunosenescence.\nIn terms of the innate branch, research indicates that with\nage, cells involved in phagocytosis (e.g., macrophages) be-\ncome less effective, levels of complement decrease, and\nalthough there are increases in the number of NK cells,\nthere is also a decrease in their functionality (Kovaiou et al.,\n2007). The adaptive branch also undergoes age-related\nchanges. The thymus gland shrinks with age, and as a result,\nfewer naive T cells are produced. Although the percentage\nof T cells does not decrease with age, the proportion of\nmemory T cells (i.e., those cells that are only activated by a\npreviously encountered antigen) and naive T cells (i.e.,\nthose cells that respond to novel pathogens) is altered, such\nthat the number of memory T cells is greater than the num-\nber of naive T cells. A similar pattern occurs among the\nB lymphocytes, which also become less able to produce an-\ntibodies (for reviews, see Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2004;\nKiecolt-Glaser & Glaser, 2001; Kovaiou et al.; Pfister &\nSavino, 2008). With fewer lymphocytes able to respond to\nnewly introduced pathogens, an individual becomes less\nable to fend off new immunologic threats, resulting in\nincreased morbidity and mortality (Weiskopf et al., 2009).\nIn contrast to the declines that occur in some components\nof the immune system, those aspects that promote inflam-\nmation, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis\nfactor-\n, and C-reactive protein (CRP), typically increase\nwith age (Graham et al., 2006), resulting in concomitant\nage-related diseases associated with inflammation, such as\nosteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and atherosclerosis (Huang et al.,\nPsychological Stress and the Immune System\nPsychological stressors activate a number of changes in\nthe immune system, and these alterations vary according to\nstressor duration, with short-term stressors provoking tran-\nsient changes in the immune system, and progressively\nlonger lasting stressors triggering greater changes (for review,\nsee Segerstrom & Miller, 2004). In the face of an acute chal-\nlenge, the immune system readies itself for possible exposure\nto pathogens, resulting in an upregulation of some aspects\nof innate immunity and a decrease in lymphocyte prolifera-\ntion. These transient changes downregulate approximately\n1 hr after the threat ceases and are evolutionarily adaptive,\nas they protect an organism from impending threat (Kiecolt-\nGlaser, McGuire, Robles, & Glaser, 2002). As the duration\nof stressors increases, however, such as during examination\nperiods or when undergoing residential relocation, more ro-\nbust changes in immune biomarkers occur, including low-\nered B-lymphocyte concentrations (McGregor, Antoni,\nCeballos, & Blomberg, 2008), weaker vaccine responses\n(Glaser et al., 1992), slower wound healing (e.g., Marucha,\nKiecolt-Glaser, & Favagehi, 1998), and decreased func-\ntioning of NK cell activity (Lutgendorf, Vitaliano, Tripp-\nReimer, Harvey, & Lubaroff, 1999). As stressors become\nmore chronic, the adaptiveness of the stress response begins\nto wane. Changes similar to those seen in aging start to\noccur, with decreases in adaptive immunity (for review, see\nGraham et al., 2006; Segerstrom & Miller), increases in\ninflammatory markers, such as proinflammatory cytokines and\nCRP (Koster et al., 2006), and decrements in several aspects\nof innate immunity (Gomez, Boehmer, & Kovacs, 2005).\nDoes Chronic Stress Accelerate Aging?\nIf chronic stress activates biomarker changes that are akin\nto those seen in aging, does it also have the potential to exac-\nerbate normative age-related changes? Surprisingly, rela-\ntively few studies have examined this question, but of those\nthat have, several suggest that stress does, indeed, exacerbate\nthe aging process. For example, in their seminal study, Epel,\nBurke, and Woskowitz (2004) found that women reporting\nhigher levels of perceived stress showed accelerated cellular\naging compared to their lower-stressed peers. One intriguing\nquestion that was not explicitly examined in this study, how-\never, is how age may influence this association. Studies that\nhave examined the impact of age on the relationship between\nstress and health indicate that stress may actually be more\nharmful for older as compared to younger adults. For exam-\nple, high job demands appear to be more detrimental to the\nhealth of older employees than to the health of younger em-\nployees (Schnorpfeil et al., 2003). Older adults may also\ntake longer to physiologically recover from high-stress work\nweeks than their younger counterparts (Ritvanen, Louhevaara,\nHelin,Vaisanen, & Hanninen, 2006), a finding that coincides\nwith the self-ratings of older adults who indicate needing\nmore \"recovery time\" after work compared with younger\nadults (Kiss, De Meester, & Braeckman, 2008). Similarly, in\na study of stressed individuals, age was linearly related to\ncortisol levels, indicating that among people exposed to\nstressors, older adults were affected to a greater extent than\nwere their middle-aged counterparts (Jacobs, Mason, Kosten,\nStudies also suggest that chronic stress may exacerbate\nnormative aging processes of the immune system (see reviews\nSchneiderman, Ironson, & Siegel, 2005; but see Pedersen,\nZechariae, & Bovbjerg, 2009). In one study, for example, the\ninfluenza vaccine was given to caregivers of spouses with\ndementia and noncaregiver controls. Noncaregivers were\nbetter able to mount a response to the vaccine than were care-\ngivers, and among the caregivers, those younger than 70 years\nhad a stronger response than did those older than 70 years\n(Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1996). In contrast, nonelderly caregivers\nof relatives with multiple sclerosis did not appear to differ in\ntheir ability to mount a vaccine response than did noncaregiv-\ners (Vedhara et al., 2002). More postsurgery complications\nhave also been noted among anxious older men when com-\npared with nonanxious older men and both anxious and\nnonanxious younger men (Linn, Linn, & Jensen, 1983). Over a\n6-year period, Kiecolt-Glaser and colleagues (2003) also found\nthat spousal caregivers had a fourfold increase in levels of IL-6\ncompared with noncaregivers. Given that aging is positively\nassociated with levels of IL-6, this additional increase may\nresult in even greater health repercussions. Indeed, in a meta-\nanalysis of over 300 studies examining stress and the immune\nsystem, Segerstrom and Miller (2004) concluded that \"aging\nlikely makes people more susceptible to negative immunologi-\ncal effects of stress\" (p. 619).\nCurrent research hints at the possibility of chronic stress\nexacerbating normative age-related changes in the neuroen-\ndocrine and immune systems. Not all studies show this\npattern(e.g.,Dijkstra,Charness,Yordon,&Fox,2009;Strahler,\nBerndt, Kirschbaum, & Rohleder, 2010), however, so\nmore work is needed before definitive conclusions can be\ndrawn. Fortunately, there has been an increase in the\nnumber of large-scale longitudinal studies that collect\nboth biological and psychological data, which will make\nit possible to assess the impact stressor type and duration\nhave on aging.\nFuture Directions\nTaking a Multivariate View: Allostasis and Allostatic Load\nOur review thus far has highlighted how aging, stress,\nand the interaction between the two may affect biomarkers\nof the SAM axis, the HPA axis, and the immune system.\nRather than operating independently, these systems\ninteract, leading to dynamic, synergistic effects on the\nbody. Examining how only one biomarker is related to one\nphysiological system may provide an unacceptably narrow\nunderstanding of aging and stress. The concepts of allosta-\nsis and allostatic load (McEwen, 1998; Sterling & Eyer,\n1988) were introduced in recognition of the need to inte-\ngrate the effects of stress on the entire body and have moved\nresearchers away from a univariate approach (i.e., use of\none biomarker) of understanding the effects of stress on the\nbody toward a multivariate approach (i.e., use of multiple\nbiomarkers).\nWhen faced with external challenges, such as stressful\nsituations, the human body adapts by altering internal\nphysiological processes. This process of adjustment and\nadaptation to meet external demands is referred to as\nallostasis (Sterling & Eyer, 1988). Allostasis is adaptive in\nthe short term; continual accommodation of physiological\nsystems in response to stressors, however, may result in\nallostatic load or a wearing down of bodily systems due to\nconstant activity (McEwen, 1998). Operationalization of\nallostatic load varies from study to study, but one common\nway to measure it is through a summary score that repre-\nsents the total number of biomarkers for which an indi-\nvidual scores in the uppermost or lowermost extreme (e.g.,\nCrimmins, Kim, & Seeman, 2009; Seeman, Singer, Rowe,\nHorwitz, & McEwen, 1997). Studies using this method\nhave shown that the more biomarkers for which a person\nscores in the highest risk quartiles, the greater is one's\nrisk of cognitive and physiological declines, as well as\nmortality (e.g., Seeman et al.).\nStatistical techniques, such as canonical correlation and\nrecursive partitioning, have been used to more accurately\naccount for the multidimensional and complex nature of\nallostatic load (e.g., Gruenewald, Seeman, Ryff, Karlamangla,\n& Singer, 2006; Karlamangla, Singer, McEwen, Rowe, &\nSeeman, 2002). Such methods allow researchers to identify\nthe biomarkers that are most predictive of the outcome of\ninterest. In general, however, much of the research on allo-\nstatic load has taken a fairly static view of aging, stressor\nexposure, and biomarkers. Because biological processes are\nlabile and responsive to recent experiences and challenges,\nthe understanding of aging, stressor exposure, biomarkers,\nand allostatic load may benefit from daily diary methods.\nTaking a Dynamic View: Daily Stressors, Biomarkers, and\nDiary Designs\nThere are several virtues to daily diary studies (Bolger et al.,\n2003), one of the most notable being increased ecological\nvalidity, which oftentimes limits the generalizability of\nlaboratory research. Given their relatively short-time\nframes, daily diary studies also address concerns regard-\ning potential memory biases that may be an issue for ret-\nrospective studies with longer time frames. Perhaps most\nrelevant to the study of stress, health, and aging, however,\nis the ability of daily diary studies to assess \"within-person\nstressor reactivity.\"\n\"Stressor reactivity\" refers to how people react either\nemotionally or physically to daily stressors, and is opera-\ntionalized as the within-person association between stres-\nsors and a particular outcome--in this case biomarkers\nactivity does not refer to the average level of a given bio-\nmarker, but rather how biomarkers change as a function of\nstressor exposure. For example, prior research demonstrates\nthat people who are less reactive to daily stressors are also\nless susceptible to physical illness than are people who are\nmore reactive to daily stressors (Cacioppo).A more dynamic\nway to approach the study of daily stressor reactivity, how-\never, is to compare an individual's biomarker levels on stres-\nsor days versus stressor-free days. For example, rather than\nask whether caregivers have higher salivary cortisol levels\nthan do non-caregivers, researchers can examine whether\ncaregivers' cortisol levels are higher on days when they ex-\nperience stressors related to caregiving versus days when\nthey do not experience caregiving-related stressors (e.g.,\nSeltzer et al., 2009). This within-person approach makes it\npossible to rule out third variable explanations for the asso-\nciation between stressors and biomarkers, and permits a\ntemporal examination of these two variables (for review, see\nThe next step in this daily approach is to embed inten-\nsive repeated measurements in traditional longitudinal de-\nsigns to tease apart the pathways through which economic,\nsocial, and psychological factors affect daily stressor ex-\nposure and reactivity and how they may influence bio-\nmarkers (Almeida et al., 2009). Using data collected over\nan extended period of time would allow researchers to ex-\namine how preexisting circumstances may be associated\nwith daily stress processes and biomarker changes. More-\nover, examining the full life course would make it possible\nto explore how life cycle variation, in conjunction with\neconomic and social factors, may alter these pathways\nThe use of daily diary data may also help researchers\ndetermine the physiological responses that are most adap-\ntive to different types of stressors. Some researchers, for\nexample, suggest that an adaptive response to stress consists\nof moderate activity within the SAM and HPA axes, with\neither moderate\u00admoderate or high\u00adlow activation of the two\nsystems, in contrast to the less adaptive high\u00adhigh or low\u00ad\nlow balance (Bauer, Quas, & Boyce, 2002). By collecting\ndaily diary and biomarker data from the same individuals\nover time, it is possible to not only determine the responses\nthat are most adaptive for people of different ages but\nalso which biomarker combinations are most predictive\nof morbidity and mortality.\nA Word of Caution\nClearly, the use of biomarkers in stress, health, and aging\nresearch provides a wealth of information. Yet, researchers\nmust be well informed of the potential limitations that\naccompany this type of data collection. Biomarker assays\ntend to be costly, may require specialized training or a\nskilled technician, and--in isolation--are not always\nindicative of meaningful underlying processes (Mayeux,\n2004). In addition, many biomarkers can only be collected\nin laboratory settings, thereby limiting the types of phenom-\nena researchers may study. When biomarkers are collected\nin the field, however, questions arise regarding participant\ncompliance and sample integrity. Researchers, therefore,\nmust decide whether reduced control is outweighed by the\nbenefit of capturing stress processes as they occur in daily\nlife. Regardless of where data are collected, proper collec-\ntion procedures cannot be overemphasized.Arm movement,\nfor example, can make blood pressure readings unreliable\n(Mourad et al., 2003); saliva collection method (e.g.,\ncotton swab vs. passive drool) can affect DHEA-S/DHEA\n(Gallagher, Leitch, Massey, McAllister-Williams, &Young,\n2006); and caffeine consumption can affect salivary cortisol\nlevels (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004). Finally, it is important\nto realize that not all research on stress, health, and aging\nrequires biomarker data. In many situations, self-reported\nhealth information is not only acceptable but is ideally\nsuited for the question at hand. Indeed, biomarkers are not a\npanacea to all research on stress, health, and aging. Instead,\nthe use of biomarker data simply allows skilled researchers\na chance to ask questions they may not otherwise be able to\nanswer.\nSummary and Conclusions\nThe study of stress and biological aging has a rich history.\nof The Stress of Life: \"Stress is the sum of all of the\nwear and tear caused by any kind of vital reaction through-\nout the body at any one time. That is why it can act as a\ncommon denominator of all of the biologic changes which\ngo on in the body; it is a kind of `speedometer of life'\"\n(p. 274). The frontier for research on stress and aging is to\nassess this speedometer within naturalistic settings across\nmultiple time frames. Only by examining multiple daily\nstressors, in conjunction with individual differences and\nbiological measures, can researchers determine the ways\nspecific types of stressors, as well as their duration, are re-\nlated to physiological processes across the life span.\nFunding\n"
