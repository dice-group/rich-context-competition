Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry systems (pencil-beam geometry in NHANES III, fan-beam geometry in NHANES 2005\u00ad2006)\nwere used to measure femur BMD, and World Health Organization (WHO) definitions of low BMD were used to categorize skeletal status.\nosteopenia and 2% had femur neck osteoporosis.

The most recent\nnationally representative estimates of osteoporosis prevalence,\nbased on femur BMD data from the third National Health and\npublished a decade ago.(3) Total-body and regional BMD data\ncannot provide osteoporosis estimates for the femur neck, which\nhas been proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO)(5)\nas the skeletal site that should be used for the description of\nosteoporosis in populations. To address these data gaps,\nproximal femur bone density measurements by dual-energy\nX-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were included in the continuous\nNHANES beginning in 2005. Not only can these data can provide\nmore recent estimates of the prevalence of osteoporosis based\non the recommended femur neck skeletal site, but they also can\nprovide estimates of osteoporosis prevalence at the total hip, the\nskeletal site on which the osteoporosis objective in Healthy\nPeople 2010 is based.(6) Finally, these data allow a comparison of\nosteoporosis prevalence in representative samples of the\nnoninstitutionalized US population that were assessed at two\ndifferent time points so that changes in bone status over time\ncan be examined. The specific objectives of this study are to\n(1) assess the prevalence of low bone density at the femur neck\nwith target prevalence goals identified for the population in\nHealthy People 2010, and (3) contrast the prevalence of low bone\nobserved in NHANES III.\nJ\nJBMR\nAddress correspondence to: Anne C Looker, PhD, National Center for Health Statistics, Room 4310, 3311 Toledo Road.

The\npresent study was based on data collected in NHANES 2005\u00ad\n2006. In each NHANES, data were collected via household\ninterviews and direct standardized physical examinations\nconducted in specially equipped mobile examination centers.(7,8)\nAll procedures in both surveys were approved by the NCHS\nInstitutional Review Board, and written informed consent was\nobtained from all subjects.\nreliable estimates for three race/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic\nwhites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans. Race and\nethnicity were self-reported by the participants. A total of 10,995\nadults age 50 years and older were eligible to participate in\nNHANES III. Of the eligible sample, 8654 (79%) were interviewed,\nand 7155 (65%) were examined. The present study uses data for\n6401 adults age 50 years and older with valid nonmissing femur\nBMD data from NHANES III, which represents 58% of the sample\nin this age range who were originally selected for NHANES III,\n74% of the participants in this age range who were interviewed,\nand 89% of those who received physical examinations. A total of\n3157 adults age 50 years and older were eligible to participate in\nwith valid, nonmissing femur BMD data, which represents 51% of\nthe participants in this age range who were eligible to participate\nin the survey, 73% of the interviewed participants, and 76% of\nthose who received physical examinations.\nVariables\nAs described elsewhere,(9) femur BMD was measured in NHANES\n(Hologic, Inc., Bedford, MA, USA) using Discovery version 12.4\nsoftware. Scanning was done in the fast mode. In NHANES III,\nfemur BMD was measured with Hologic QDR 1000 pencil-beam\ndensitometers.(10) Rigorous quality-control (QC) programs were\nemployed in both surveys, which included use of anthropo-\nmorphic phantoms and review of each QC and respondent scan\nat a central site (Department of Radiology, University of California\nDiagnostic Radiology, Mayo Clinic in NHANES III).(9,10) In both\nsurveys, the left hip was scanned unless there was a history of\nprevious fracture or surgery.\nTo address the potential impact of the change in DXA\nmethodology between surveys, a literature search was\nperformed to identify the magnitude of the difference that\nmight be expected when the same individuals were measured\non both scanner types.(18\u00ad21) The largest discrepancy between\nthe two scanners found in published studies was a difference\nof \u00c6 3% at either the femur neck or total hip.(18,21) Accordingly,\nwere raised or lowered by 3%. Estimates of osteoporosis, as\ndefined below, that were based on the adjusted BMD values\nwith the prevalence estimates from NHANES III (data not shown).\nAlthough the magnitude of the prevalence estimates was altered\nby this adjustment, conclusions regarding the differences in\nprevalence between surveys were the same as when based on\nthe observed BMD values except in one case (when BMD was\nlowered by 3% in men). As a result, the observed BMD values\nfrom both surveys were used in the present study without\nadjustment for the difference in DXA methods.\nIn the present study, BMD data at the femur neck and total hip\nwere analyzed. The femur neck was chosen because it has been\nproposed as the reference skeletal site for defining osteoporosis\nin epidemiologic studies.(5) The total hip was included because it\nis the skeletal site used in the Healthy People 2010 objective\nrelated to osteoporosis.(6) Definitions of osteopenia and\nosteoporosis were based on criteria outlined by WHO in 1994(11):\nOsteopenia: BMD between 1 standard deviation (SD) and 2.5 SD\nbelow the mean of the young reference group.\nOsteoporosis: BMD 2.5 SD or more below the mean of the young\nreference group.\nAs recommended more recently by the WHO,(5) 20- to 29-year-\nold non-Hispanic white women from NHANES III(3) were used\nas the reference group to derive these cutoff values for men\nand women in both surveys. The specific NHANES III cutoff\nrespectively.(3) The thresholds for osteoporosis were 0.56 g/\ncm2 or less and 0.64 g/cm2 or less for the femur neck and total\nhip, respectively.(3)\nTwo potential explanatory factors related to secular trends in\nBMD were examined in the present study: body mass index (BMI)\nand use of osteoporosis medications. These variables were\nchosen because they have been shown to be strongly related to\nBMD,(12,13) and there is also evidence that changes have occurred\nin the population since NHANES III.(14\u00ad16) BMI was calculated as\nbody weight (kilograms) divided by height (meters squared). In\nboth surveys, body weight was measured to the nearest 0.01 kg\nusing an electronic load-cell scale, and standing height was\nmeasured with a fixed stadiometer.\nOsteoporosis medication users were defined as those who\nself-reported having been treated for osteoporosis and/or were\ncurrently taking the prescription medications described below.\nData to define users of osteoporosis medications were collected\nin a comparable manner in both surveys. Respondents who\nself-reported having been diagnosed with osteoporosis by a\nphysician were asked if they had been treated for it. In addition,\nall respondents, regardless of whether they had self-reported\nhaving been diagnosed with osteoporosis, showed the contain-\ners for all current prescription medications to the interviewer,\nwho recorded the name of the product. Medications were\nTRENDS IN OSTEOPOROSIS Journal of Bone and Mineral Research 65\nassigned standard generic names and four-digit generic codes\nusing the Physicians' GenRx(17) in NHANES III.

In\nalendronate, risedronate, etidronate, pamidronate, tiludronate,\nibandronate, and zolendronate), calcitonin, calcitriol, fluoride,\nraloxifene, tamoxifen, tibolone, strontium ranelate, parathyroid\nhormone, teriparatide, and sex hormones (i.e., estrogen and\ntestosterone). The Multum drug therapeutic category codes for\nestrogen and testosterone were used to identify the relevant sex\ncorresponding to these Multum drug therapeutic codes were\nconsidered to be in these categories in NHANES III as well.\n``Estrogens'' included estradiol, estradiol valerate, estrogenic\nsubstances, conjugated estrogens, esterified estrogens (alone\nand with methyltestosterone), estropipate, ethinyl estradiol\n(alone or with ethynodiol diacetate, levonorgestrel, norethin-\ndrone, norethindrone acetate, or desogestrel), diethylstilbesterol\n(alone or with disphosphate), fluoxymesterone, and quinestrol.\n``Testosterones'' included testosterone, testosterone cypionate,\nstanozolol, and nandrolone decanoate.\nEducation was included as a variable in order to make\ncomparisons with subgroups identified in the osteoporosis\nobjective in Healthy People 2010.(6) Education was defined as\nnumbers of years of schooling completed and was categorized\nas less than high school, high school, and more than high school\nto be consistent with categories used in the Healthy People 2010\nosteoporosis objective.\nStatistical analysis\nAnalyses were conducted with PC-SAS (version 9.1, SAS Institute,\nCary, NC, USA) and SUDAAN (version 9.03, Research Triangle\nInstitute, NC, USA). All analyses used sample weights and took\ninto account the complex design of the survey. When multiple\ncomparisons of estimates between groups were made, a\nBonferoni correction was used.\nBMD means by age and race/ethnicity were calculated for\nother characteristic in the model. The prevalence of low BMD at\nand age group, and differences by age and sex were tested using\nlogistic regression. Prevalence estimates for the total population\nand by race/ethnicity were age standardized to the US Census\n2000 population estimates when not provided by detailed age\ngroups. Estimates of the number of older US adults with poor\nskeletal status were calculated by multiplying the unadjusted\nprevalences for age 50\u00fe by Census Current Population Survey\nestimates of the noninstitutionalized US population for 2005\u00ad\n2006 (www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/nhanes_cps_totals.\nhtm).\nChanges in the prevalence of low femur BMD between\ncalculating the age-standardized prevalence in each survey for\nthe total population age 50 years and older and by sex and race/\nethnicity. Differences between age-standardized prevalences\nwere tested using a t test. Differences between the two surveys\nalso were tested using logistic regression models that included\nage and the survey time period.\nSecondary analyses were done to assess the potential impact\nof changes in BMI and osteoporosis medications on the observed\ndifference in prevalence of femur neck osteoporosis. These\nanalyses were stratified by race/ethnicity in order to avoid\npotential confounding by this variable in the relationships.\nThe analyses were limited to non-Hispanic whites owing to\nstatistically unreliable prevalence estimates of osteoporosis and/\nor medication use in the other groups. To assess the potential\nimpact of differences in BMI and medication use, the prevalences\nbefore and after adjusting for those two factors were calculated\nusing logistic regression models that also included age and the\nsurvey time period as variables.\nResults\nMean femur neck and total hip BMD by age, sex, and race/\nethnicity are shown in Table 1 for adults age 50 years and older\nafter adjusting for the other variables shown in the table.

In women, mean BMD was\nsignificantly lower in each successive age decade at both\nskeletal sites. In men, however, only the difference between 60 to\n69 years and 70 to 79 years reached statistical significance at\neither skeletal site. Race/ethnicity also was related significantly to\nBMD at both femur sites. Non-Hispanic blacks had a significantly\nhigher age-adjusted mean BMD than whites at both skeletal sites\nin both sexes (see Table 1). Age-adjusted mean femur neck BMD\nwas significantly higher in Mexican-American women than non-\nHispanic white women, but age-adjusted mean total hip BMD\ndid not differ significantly between these two groups of women.\nAmong men, non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans had\nsimilar age-adjusted mean BMDs at both skeletal sites.\nThe crude, or unadjusted, prevalence and estimated millions\nof older adults (all races combined) with osteoporosis and\nTable 2.

The prevalence of\nlow BMD was lower at the total hip; for example, among older\nwomen, 36% had osteopenia, and 7 percent had osteoporosis.\nPopulation Survey estimates revealed that roughly 40 million\nolder adults had low BMD at the femur neck (34.5 million with\nosteopenia \u00fe 5.3 million with osteoporosis).

However, the prevalence of osteoporosis was\nsimilar in the two surveys in non-Hispanic black women and also\ndid not differ significantly between surveys among Mexican-\nAmerican women, although the estimates tended to be lower in\nbetween surveys among non-Hispanic black or Mexican-\nAmerican men owing to a lack of statistically reliable estimates\nTable 2.

The lack of difference in\nosteopenia between surveys despite a decline in osteoporosis\nmay be due to the location of the osteoporosis and osteopenia\ncutoff values in the BMD distribution coupled with differences in\nthe shape of the BMD distributions between the two surveys. The\ncutoff values for osteoporosis fall in the tail region of the BMD\ndistribution, where differences in the BMD distribution between\nthe surveys were more pronounced. The cutoff values for\nosteopenia fall more in the center of the BMD distribution, where\ndifferences between surveys were less pronounced.\nSecondary analyses were performed to assess the impact of\nchanges in BMI and medication use that might underlie the\nobserved difference in osteoporosis between NHANES III and\nneck osteoporosis prevalence between NHANES III and NHANES\nuse differences in the two surveys.

Smaller changes\nwere observed among non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican\nAmericans that did not reach statistical significance possibly\nNonetheless, the estimated reduction in osteoporosis prevalence\nobserved among non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans in\nDespite the apparent decline in low femur BMD between\naffected older adults remains high. For example, an estimated 5.3\nmillion older men and women had osteoporosis at the femur\nfemur neck osteoporosis and 26.3 million with femur neck\nosteopenia.(3) Thus the increase in the number of older adults\nin the US population led to more older adults having low\nin osteoporosis prevalence.\nThe decline in femoral osteoporosis did not appear to be\nstrongly associated with two bone-related factors known to\nhave changed in the population between the two time periods\nexamined: an increase in BMI(14,15) and approval of new medi-\ncations (e.g., several bisphosphonates and teriparatide) to\nprevent and treat osteoporosis.(13,16) We had previously\nprojected that the increase in BMI was unlikely to significantly\nreduce the prevalence of osteoporosis in older women despite\nits strong relationship with BMD(12) because the increase in\noverweight was confined to a fairly small proportion of the total\npopulation of older women.(22) The present results support our\nearlier projections. The lack of impact of medication use in the\npresent study also may stem in part from the small increase in\nuse: 10% of our NHANES III sample compared with 16% of our\nosteoporosis medications or reported ever receiving treatment\nfor osteoporosis. Not unexpectedly, the type of medications\ndiffered between surveys, being almost exclusively estrogen in\nthe NHANES III and almost exclusively bisphosphonates in the\nsimilar effects on femur BMD is not certain because, to our\nknowledge, head-to-head randomized clinical trials have not\nbeen conducted. Meta-analyses of randomized trials of each\nclass separately have been performed, however. Between-trial\ncomparisons must be interpreted with caution owing to the\npotential impact of variability in study designs, but the meta-\nanalysis results suggest that these two drug classes may have\nsimilar effects on femur BMD.(23) Furthermore, six head-to-head\nrandomized clinical trials found no difference in fracture\nincidence in patients using these two drug classes.(13)\nDifferences in the DXA technology used in the two surveys\nalso may have contributed to the observed decline in prevalence.\nDevices from the same manufacturer were used in both surveys,\nbut NHANES III used first-generation pencil-beam instruments\nfan-beam instruments (QDR 4500a/Discovery). The DXA manu-\nfacturer performed calibration studies between sequential\ngenerations of DXA instruments so that the old and new\nsystems would provide equivalent BMD values within the\naverage accepted level of agreement between any two DXA\nsystems of roughly \u00c6 2%. However, a direct in vivo comparison\n(Thomas Kelly, personal communication, Hologic, Inc.). We found\nonly a small number of published studies with in vivo results for\nthe QDR 1000 compared directly with any version of the QDR\nmagnitude and direction of the BMD difference for a particular\nfemur region of interest. Some studies found that the difference\nbetween DXA systems depended on the subject's BMD value,(18)\nwhereas others did not.(20,21) This lack of consistency prevented\nus from developing a robust statistical adjustment to remove the\neffects of the DXA system change from the NHANES data set.\nInstead, we performed a sensitivity analysis in which we raised or\n3% and reexamined differences in prevalence between NHANES\nwomen regardless of how BMD was adjusted and changed\nfor men only when BMD values were adjusted by \u00ad3%. This\nsuggests, but cannot establish, that differences in DXA techn-\nology are unlikely to fully explain the apparent decline seen\nbetween surveys, at least in women. Interpretation of the change\nin prevalence among men is complicated by the low prevalence\nestimates observed in both surveys.\nRace/ethnic differences in femur BMD were similar to those\nseen in NHANES III,(24) with non-Hispanic blacks having the\nhighest BMD values and non-Hispanic whites having the lowest\nvalues. Mexican Americans had BMD values that generally fell\nbetween those of non-Hispanic blacks and whites, although not\nall the differences were statistically different. Interestingly,\nMexican Americans had lower BMD values than non-Hispanic\nwhites for the total body and at several large skeletal subregions\nexamined.(4) The use of different population samples in NHANES\ndiscrepancy, but a similar discrepancy in ranking of Hispanics\nversus whites also has been observed in other studies in which\nboth the femur and total-body measurements were made on the\nsame individuals.(25,26) The basis for this discrepancy is unclear.\nDifferences in femur shape between ethnic groups could be a\ncontributing factor. For example, differences in anteroposterior\ndiameter and platymeria, or flattening, of the proximal femur\nhave been noted between whites and Native Americans.(27)\nMexican Americans vary in their degree of Native American\nancestry, but Klimenditis et al.(28) found that self-identified\nMexican Americans in New Mexico had 39% Native American\ngenetic admixture.\nThis study has limitations beyond the inability to directly\naddress the difference in DXA methods used in the two surveys.\nrepresentative, is smaller than the sample from NHANES III\nand was drawn from fewer locations in the United States, so\nstable than those from NHANES III. Nonresponse bias may be\nTRENDS IN OSTEOPOROSIS Journal of Bone and Mineral Research 69\npresent in the estimates from both surveys. Nonresponse bias\nowing to refusal to participate in the physical examinations in\nNHANES is reduced by a nonresponse adjustment factor\nincluded in the calculation of the sample weights for use with\nexaminee data. Approximately 11% and 24%, respectively, of the\nand older who came to the examination centers lacked usable\nproximal femur DXA data, and this nonresponse is not addressed\nby the sample weight adjustments. However, results from a\ndetailed nonresponse bias analysis conducted by NCHS prior to\nthat additional adjustments for nonresponse (beyond those\nperformed in the construction of the original examination\nweights) were not necessary. Finally, institutionalized people, an\nimportant at-risk group for osteoporosis,(29) are excluded from\nthe NHANES sampling frame by design.\nIn summary, the prevalence of osteoporosis, as defined by low\nfemur BMD, appears to have declined among older adults in the\nUnited States since the mid-1990s so that osteoporosis reduction\ntargets identified for the population in Healthy People 2010\nhave been met. The observed decrease in femoral osteoporosis\nthe number of older US adults with low femur BMDs remains\nsubstantial, and annual costs associated with osteoporotic\nfractures are projected to rise by almost 50%, from $17 billion to\nof the population.(30) Although it is reasonable to assume that\nthe decline in the prevalence of low femur BMD underlies the fall\nin hip fracture incidence that has been reported in other\nstudies,(1,2) this could not be addressed directly in the present\nstudy owing to a lack of incident fracture data for this sample and\nthus requires further investigation. Finally, more research is\nneeded to identify factors that underlie the decline in low BMD,\nwhich does not appear to be explained by the increase in\naverage BMI of the population or by the introduction of new\npharmaceutical treatments for osteoporosis prevention and\ntreatment.\nDisclosures\nAll the authors state that they have no conflicts of interest.\n"
