The majority of studies testing this theory have\nexamined men and women's responses to hypothetical infidelity scenarios in which\nparticipants must choose which type of infidelity (sexual or emotional) is more\ndistressing or upsetting. Although studies using this forced-choice methodology generally\nfind that a higher proportion of men than women choose the sexual infidelity as more\ndistressing (Harris, 2003), reliance on this methodology has led to a number of serious\nSex differences in jealousy\nchallenges, including: (a) that sex differences in jealousy are not replicable with\ncontinuous measures of jealousy, and (b) that sex differences in jealousy do not emerge\nwhen people report their reactions to actual infidelity experiences.\nSex Differences in Jealousy using Continuous Measures\nThe majority of studies examining sex differences in jealousy have used the\nforced-choice methodology (Buss et al., 1992; Harris, 2003). This methodology was\nfavored because both men and women were expected to have strong jealous reactions to\nsexual and emotional infidelity due to their co-occurrence throughout history, and the\nforced-choice method allows for a cleaner separation of reactions to both types of\ninfidelity. However, a number of critics have argued that sex differences in jealousy are\nnot replicable with continuous measures of jealousy (DeSteno, Bartlett, Braverman, and\nnoted that some studies have found significant sex differences using continuous measures\n(Sagarin, Becker, Guadagno, Nicastle, and Millevoi, 2003; Sheets and Wolfe, 2001;\nWiederman and Allgeier, 1993; See also Pietrzak, Laird, Stevens, and Thompson, 2002),\nHarris (2005) responded that other studies, including one with a large random sample\n(Green and Sabini, 2004), failed to find significant sex differences.\nThe failure to find sex differences in a large random sample (Green and Sabini,\n2004) is particularly troubling for the theory of evolved sex differences in jealousy. But\nan examination of Green and Sabini's data (with permission of the first author; Green,\npersonal communication, March 11, 2005) suggests that the lack of a significant sex\ndifference might have stemmed from a ceiling effect in the data. Participants were asked\nto imagine that their romantic partner has become interested in someone else. They were\nthen asked how distressed or upset they would be when imagining an emotional\ninfidelity. On a seven-point scale with 1 labeled Not at all, 4 labeled Moderately, and 7\nlabeled Very, 56.7% of men and 75.0% of women responded with a 7. Similarly, when\nasked how distressed or upset they would be when imagining a sexual infidelity, 72.2%\nof men and 85.1% of women responded with a 7.\nBecause a partner's infidelity will typically elicit an intense jealous reaction, the\nuse of \"very\" as an upper anchor label may have effectively condensed the usable portion\nof the scale. Indeed, in Green and Sabini's (2004) sample, over 95% of participants\nresponded using the top four points on their seven point scale (the majority using the\nuppermost point). To remedy this, the present studies used a jealousy scale adapted from\nHarris (2002) with a lower anchor labeled Not at all, and an upper anchor labeled\nCompletely.\nSex Differences in Jealousy in Response to Actual Infidelity\nHarris (2002) argued that responses to hypothetical infidelity scenarios might not\nalign with responses to actual infidelity experiences. As evidence, Harris replicated the\nsex differences using the traditional forced-choice hypothetical questions, but when\nparticipants were asked about their reactions to actual infidelity, both men and women\nreported that they focused on the emotional aspects of the infidelity more than the sexual\naspects. However, as discussed in Sagarin (2005), Harris' change from hypothetical\nSex differences in jealousy\ninfidelity scenarios to actual infidelity experiences was confounded with a change in the\nconstruct being measured (participants reported their distress or upset in response to\nhypothetical infidelity scenarios, whereas they reported their focus in response to actual\ninfidelity experiences). Distress or upset is an affective response whereas focus is\nprimarily a cognitive response.\nBerman and Frazier (2005) partially explored this issue using a forced choice item\nthat asked past victims of infidelity whether they were more distressed or upset by their\n\"partner's emotional attachment to the other person\" or their \"partner's enjoying sexual\nactivities with that other person\" (p. 1621). They replicated the sex differences using the\ntraditional forced-choice hypothetical questions, but when the questions were asked about\nactual infidelity they found no difference between the sexes. However, Berman and\nFrazier (2005) used a different method of identifying past victims of infidelity that\nyielded a much smaller proportion of participants identified as experiencing infidelity.\nof heterosexual men in her sample said yes to the question \"Have you had any\nexperiences in which someone you were romantically involved with `cheated on' you?\"\nsample indicated that \"a romantic partner had been unfaithful to them sometime in the\npast year\" (p. 1620) according to a specific definition of infidelity (\"a romantic, sexual,\nor emotional relationship with someone other than the primary partner that was kept\nsecret from that partner and that would have been unacceptable to the partner if s/he had\nknown,\" p. 1620). This led to an N of 64 in the critical 2 analysis--a very small sample\nsize for a confident interpretation of a null effect.\nThe present studies used Harris's (2002) method of identifying past victims of\ninfidelity and found proportions of past victims similar to Harris (2002).\nCurrent Studies\nIn two studies, we examined whether a sex difference in jealousy emerges in\nresponse to actual experience with infidelity using both continuous and forced-choice\nmeasures. In Study One, we administered a paper survey to undergraduate students. In\nStudy Two, students recruited working adults to participate in a web-based survey.\nStudy One\nMethods\nParticipants\nTwo hundred fifteen students participated in this experiment (53 men, 162\nwomen, Mage\nwomen (53%) had been cheated on. Nine participants who self identified as non-\nheterosexual were excluded from the analyses. 1\nProcedure\nSex differences in jealousy\nStudents completed a three-page survey in class for extra credit. The first page\ncontained demographics and asked whether the participant had ever been cheated on. If\nthe participant had been cheated on they proceeded to the second page, otherwise the\nparticipant skipped to the third page. The second page asked how emotionally distressed\nthe participant was by the infidelity, how jealous they were in response to the emotional\nand sexual aspects of the infidelity (answered on seven-point scales with end points\nlabeled \"not at all\" and \"completely\"), a forced-choice jealousy item (\"Which aspect of\nthe infidelity made you more jealous?\" with options \"Sexual\" and \"Emotional\"), how\nmuch the participant focused on the emotional and sexual aspects (answered on seven-\npoint scales with end points labeled \"not at all\" and \"completely\"), and a forced-choice\nfocus item (\"Which aspect of the infidelity did you focus on?\" with options \"Sexual\" and\n\"Emotional\"). The third page contained Buss et al.'s (1992) hypothetical infidelity\nscenario.\nResults and Discussion\nWhen recalling actual experiences with infidelity, men reported greater jealousy\nin response to the sexual aspects (M = 4.61, SD = 1.99) than the emotional aspects (M =\n4.26, SD = 2.11) of the infidelity, whereas women reported greater jealousy in response\n1.79) of the infidelity, Finteraction\neffect (d = .50).

Sixty-three participants (46%) were working adults, 65 were\nstudents (48%, including participants who dual-identified as worker and students), and 8\ndid not identify their profession (6%). Five participants who reported being familiar with\nthe theory of evolved sex differences in jealousy and six participants who self-identified\nas non-heterosexual were excluded from data analyses.\nProcedure\nPsychology undergraduates recruited working adults to participate in a web-based\nsurvey (adapted from Study One). Recruiters were given the web address of the survey\nand were offered extra credit points for recruiting up to three people to participate in the\nstudy. The web survey included a field for participants to report the person who should\nreceive credit for their participation. To ensure anonymity of responses, this name was\nsubmitted to the researchers separately from the rest of the survey responses. Jealousy\nand focus questions, as well as emotion and sex questions were counterbalanced.\nContinuous measures always preceded forced-choice measures. This was done to ensure\nthat participants would not use their responses from the forced choice measure in\ndeciding how to respond to the continuous items.\nResults and Discussion\nConsistent with Study One, when recalling actual experiences with infidelity, men\nreported greater jealousy in response to the sexual aspects (M = 4.94, SD = 2.16) than the\nemotional aspects (M = 4.50, SD = 2.18) of the infidelity, whereas women reported\ngreater jealousy in response to the emotional aspects (M = 5.44, SD = 1.94) than the\nsexual aspects (M = 4.58, SD = 2.11) of the infidelity, Finteraction\nwhich represents a moderate to large effect size (d = .73). There was no main effect of\nreported that the sexual aspect of the infidelity made them more jealous, 2(1, N = 58) =\nSex differences in jealousy\nBecause one of the primary goals of Study Two was to examine sex differences in\njealousy in response to actual infidelity in a non-student sample, we ran an additional set\nof analyses using only the working adult portion of the sample. The same pattern of\nresults emerged. When recalling actual experiences with infidelity, men reported greater\njealousy in response to the sexual aspects (M = 4.73, SD = 2.28) than the emotional\naspects (M = 3.55, SD = 1.86) of the infidelity, whereas women reported greater jealousy\nin response to the emotional aspects (M = 5.16, SD = 2.17) than the sexual aspects (M =\nlarge effect size (d = .93).

In two separate studies, one a paper-and-pencil survey with a student\nsample and the other a web-based survey targeting a non-student sample, men and\nwomen showed significant sex differences in jealousy in response to actual infidelity\nexperiences. Furthermore, these sex differences emerged using both continuous measures\nof jealousy as well as the traditional forced-choice measure. Moreover, these studies\nshowed that the sex differences are not attenuated in an adult sample.\nThe present results also withstand an additional concern raised by Harris (2005).\nSpecifically, Harris (2005) argued that interactions on ordinal scales are interpretable\nSex differences in jealousy\nonly if they include a sign change or a cross-over pattern. In Study One, the critical\ninteraction showed a sign change with men reporting greater jealousy in response to the\nsexual aspects of the infidelity than the emotional aspects and women reporting greater\njealousy in response to the emotional aspects of the infidelity than the sexual aspects. In\nStudy Two, this sign change occurred within the context of a cross-over interaction. Thus\nthe interactions in both studies are interpretable despite the use of ordinal jealousy scales.\nSmaller, often marginal or non-significant sex differences emerged for the focus\nitems. These results help to resolve the otherwise contradictory findings of Harris (2002),\nsuggesting that the lack of a sex difference found when Harris (2002) asked participants\nhow much they focused on each aspect of the infidelity stemmed from Harris's use of the\nterm \"focus\" instead of \"jealousy.\"\nThe present studies did not assess whether the infidelities experienced by\nparticipants were purely sexual, purely emotional, or both sexual and emotional.\nHowever, for three reasons, it seems unlikely that systematic differences in the type of\ninfidelity experienced by men and women could account for the observed sex differences\nin jealousy. First, Berman and Frazier (2005) investigated this issue and did not find a sex\ndifference in the types of infidelity experienced by men and women. Second, in our\nstudies, very few participants (6%) indicated that the sexual or emotional aspects of the\ninfidelity caused no jealousy, suggesting that the infidelities experienced by our\nparticipants included both sexual and emotional components (see Buss, 2000, for a\ndiscussion of the co-occurrence of sexual and emotional infidelity). Third, given men's\ngreater predisposition than women toward short-term sexual liaisons (Buss and Schmitt,\n1993), women would probably be more likely than men to have been the victims of\npurely sexual infidelities. Nevertheless, women reported greater jealousy in response to\nthe emotional aspects of the infidelities than the sexual aspects.\nA large number of studies have examined sex differences in jealousy using\nhypothetical infidelity scenarios, and a growing number have used retrospective reports\nof actual infidelity. Future research could profitably expand beyond these traditional\nmethods of research in this domain. One promising option would be to create jealousy-\nprovoking situations in a laboratory and examine the jealous reactions. Jealousy could be\nprovoked in existing couples through the flirtatious advances of a confederate, or non-\ncoupled participants could be bonded through guided self-disclosure (Melinat, 1991) and\nthen the bond could be threatened by a rival. Of course, these methodologies raise\nnumerous ethical and practical challenges, most importantly ensuring the welfare of the\nparticipants and their relationships. But if these challenges could be overcome, such\nmethodologies could provide a valuable opportunity to examine real jealousy as it occurs.\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate than sex differences in jealousy are not\nlimited to responses to hypothetical infidelity scenarios. Sex differences also emerge in\nresponse to actual infidelity experiences.\n"
