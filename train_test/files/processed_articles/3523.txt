Centrally produced Ang II is well character-\nized for its ability to modulate blood pressure and cardiac\nhypertrophy by regulating sympathetic nerve activity, vaso-\npressin release and fluid intake.1,2 The diverse actions of\nAng II are mediated by its interactions with Ang AT1\nand\nreceptors, which are coupled to many signaling mole-\ncules, including small G proteins, phospholipases, mitogen-\nactivated protein (MAP) kinases, phosphatases, tyrosine\nkinases, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate\n(NADPH) oxidase, and transcription factors.3\u00ad5 Recently,\nthe heptapeptide Ang III, which is also known as Ang 2-8,\nhas received attention due to similarities in its physiological\nand pathological actions as compared to Ang II.6 Indeed,\nAng III also couples with the Ang AT1\nreceptors\nand binds with similar affinity as Ang II to these receptors\nand can activate these receptors with similar efficacy.2,7 Like\nAng II, most of the physiological and pathological effects of\nthe peptide are mediated by its interaction with the AT1\nreceptor with fewer actions mediated via the AT2\nreceptor.6\nAs examples, Ang III induced protein and DNA synthe-\nsis as well as collagen synthesis and secretion in a concen-\ntration-dependent manner in neonatal cardiac fibroblasts.8\nAng III via interaction with AT2\nreceptors induced aldos-\nterone secretion from adrenal glomerulosa.9 In the central\nAngiotensin III induces signal transducer\nand activator of transcription 3 and\ninterleukin-6 mRNA levels in cultured\nrat astrocytes\nUmadevi Kandalam1, Nancy Sarmiento2, Dhanush Haspula3 and\nMichelle A Clark3\n Keywords\nAngiotensin III, astrocytes, interleukin-6, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, proliferation\n1Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Nova Southeastern University,\nUSA\n2Farquhar College of Arts and Sciences, Nova Southeastern University,\nUSA\n3Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nova Southeastern\nUniversity, USA\nCorresponding author:\nMichelle A Clark, College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical\nSciences, Nova Southeastern University, 3200 South University Drive,\nEmail: miclark@nova.edu\nOriginal Article\nnervous system (CNS), Ang III is shown to be physiologi-\ncally important causing arginine vasopressin (AVP) release\nand blood pressure increases, similar to Ang II after intrac-\nerebroventricular injection of the peptides.10\u00ad12\nOther studies focused on the effects of Ang III on neu-\nrons in vivo and showed that the peptide is much more\npotent than Ang II in inducing responses from paraven-\ntricular nucleus receptors from both normal and hyperten-\nsive rats.13 We have recently shown that Ang III interacts\nwith Ang AT1\nreceptors to activate the extracellular sig-\nnal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and the c-Jun N-terminal\nkinase (JNK) MAP kinase pathways leading to astrocyte\nproliferation.14,15 The actions of Ang III to induce these\nMAP kinase pathways were very similar to those of Ang\nII suggesting that this peptide has equipotent potential as\ncompared to Ang II. Huang et al., in a recent study in\n2013, showed that inhibition of brain Ang III attenuated\nsympathetic hyperactivity and cardiac dysfunction in a\nmyocardial infarction model.16 Thus, these studies and\nothers have established Ang III as a physiologically rele-\nvant peptide with a pivotal role in regulating blood\npressure.1\nWe have determined the pro-inflammatory potential of\nAng II in astrocytes by studying its ability to induce the\npleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine19 whose expres-\nsion in plasma is elevated through activation of the Janus\nkinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription\n(JAK/STAT) pathway.19 JAK/STAT is one of several path-\nways that translate signals from cell membranes to the\nnucleus in response to many growth factors and cytokines.\nStudies have shown that JAK2 activates STAT3 in the\npresence of Ang II and induces various cell responses and\nings in astrocytes demonstrated that Ang II interacts with\nreceptors to induce IL-6 production; the JAK2/STAT3\npathway was shown to mediate this action of Ang II.17,18\nThe ability of Ang III to induce the STAT pathway lead-\ning to IL-6 gene expression is unknown in our system.\nHowever, it has been recently reported that Ang III also\nhas pro-inflammatory properties. In rat mesangial and\nmononuclear cells, Ang III induced the transcription fac-\ntors nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated\nB cells (NF-B) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), and\nincreased the expression of related genes, such as mono-\ncyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1).22 Thus, the focus\nof the present study was to use cultured rat brainstem and\ncerebellum astrocytes as model systems to determine\nwhether Ang III induced STAT3 phosphorylation leading\nto an effect on the gene expression of IL-6. We chose to\nstudy STAT3 because this early response gene is well\nknown to mediate pro-inflammatory effects and growth\npromoting effects of Ang II.18,23,24 In addition, astrocytes\nfrom brainstem and cerebellum will be investigated\nbecause we and others have established that these brain\nregions have well defined renin-angiotensin system (RAS)\nMaterials and methods\nMaterials\nTissue culture supplies such as Dulbecco's modified Eagles\nMedium (DMEM)/F12 (1:1), fetal bovine serum (FBS), anti-\nbiotic solution, and trypsin/ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid\n(EDTA), were purchased from VWR (Grand Island, New\nYork, USA) or Fisher Scientific (Milford, Massachusetts,\nUSA). Ang III was obtained from Bachem (Torrance,\nCalifornia, USA). Losartan was a kind gift from Du Pont-\npurchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri, USA).\nStattic, the STAT3 inhibitor, was purchased from Sigma-\nAldrich (St. Louis, Missouri, USA). 3H-thymidine (2000 Ci/\nmmole) was purchased from MP Biomedicals (Solon, Ohio,\nUSA). The phospho-STAT3 antibody and the STAT3 anti-\nbody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology\n(Beverly, Massachusetts, USA). Protein measurement sup-\nplies, gel electrophoresis and western blotting supplies\nincluding bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein reagents, acryla-\nmide, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) reagents, and nitro-\ncellulose membrane were purchased from either VWR\n(Piscataway, New Jersey, USA) or Biorad Laboratories\n(Hercules, California, USA). Supplies to measure IL-6 gene\nexpression such as master mix, probes, cDNA kit and others\nwere purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City,\nCalifornia, USA) or Life Technology (Carlsbad, California,\nUSA).All other chemicals were purchased from either VWR\ninternational (Suwannee, Georgia, USA), Fisher Scientific\n(Milford Massachusetts, USA) or Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,\nMissouri, USA).\nPreparation of astrocytes\nTimed, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from\nCharles River Laboratories (Wilmington, Massachusetts,\nUSA) and maintained in theAssociation forAssessment and\nAccreditation of LaboratoryAnimal Care (ALAAC) accred-\nited animal facility of Nova Southeastern University.\nPrimary cultures of astrocytes were prepared from the brain-\nstem and cerebellum of 2\u00ad3 days old neonatal pups by phys-\nical dissociation as previously described.25\u00ad27 Cells were\ncillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin at 37\u00b0C in a humidi-\nand 95% air). Cultures were\nfed every 3\u00ad4 days until confluent.

Astrocytes were\nEDTA), replated at a ratio of 1:10, and grown to about 85%\n760 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)\nconfluence prior to use. Isolated cells showed a positive\nimmunoreactivity with an antibody against glial fibrillary\nacidic protein and negative immunoreactivity with markers\nfor neurons, fibroblasts or oligodendrocytes.\nWestern blot analysis\nCultured brainstem and cerebellum astrocytes were made\nquiescent by a 48 h treatment with serum-free media. Cells\nwere treated with increasing concentrations of Ang III (0.1\nexperiments, brainstem and cerebellum astrocytes were\ntreated for 10 min with 100 nM Ang III in the presence and\nabsence of the STAT3 inhibitor (5 \u00b5M Stattic) or the AT1\nreceptor inhibitor (10 \u00b5M losartan) or the AT2\nreceptor\nthe inhibitors alone. Basal and stimulated levels of the pro-\nteins were determined in the presence of dimethyl sulfox-\nide (DMSO) in experiments involving Stattic. Immediately\nfollowing treatments, cell lysates were prepared by wash-\ning cells with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01\nfollowed by solubilization in supplemented\nPMSF and 0.6 M leupeptin, pH 7.4). The supernatant was\nand the protein concentration was measured based on the\nBCA method according to the manufacturer's instructions\n(Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, Illinois, USA).\nProteins previously solubilized in lysis buffer were sep-\narated in 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitro-\ncellulose membranes. Nonspecific binding to the\nmembranes was blocked by incubation with 5% Blotto\n(5% evaporated milk, 1% Tween-20 in Tris-buffered\nsaline). Subsequently, membranes were sequentially\nprobed with phospho-STAT3 antibody followed by the\ngoat anti-rabbit secondary antibody as previously\ndescribed.17,18 The immunoreactive bands were visualized\nusing ECL reagents and the data quantified by densitome-\ntry. The non-phosphorylated form of STAT3 was used to\nvisualize protein loading as described.17,18\nMeasurement of DNA synthesis\nSubconfluent monolayers of astrocytes growing in 24-well\nculture dishes were made quiescent by 48 h treatment with\nserum-free media. Individual wells were then pretreated\nfor 15 min with 5 \u00b5M Stattic, a selective inhibitor of\nSTAT3. Subsequently, the cells were treated with 100 nM\nAng III for 48 h. For comparative purposes, some wells\ndid not receive any peptides or were treated with DMSO\n(the vehicle for Stattic) or were only treated with the inhib-\nitor alone. 3H-thymidine (0.25 Ci/ml culture medium) was\nadded during the last 24 h of treatment. Newly synthesized\nDNA was precipitated with 5% TCA, dissolved in 0.25 N\nNaOH, and quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry\nas previously described.28\nIL-6 mRNA expression\nQuiescent astrocytes were treated with Ang III ranging in\nIII for 30 min to 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from astro-\ncytes using Tri reagent (Life Technology, Carlsbad,\nCalifornia, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruc-\ntions. DNA-free kit was used to eliminate any fractional\ngenomic DNA contamination in the RNA. Total RNA con-\ncentrations and purity were determined using a Biorad\nSmartSpecTM spectrophotometer. Two micrograms of\ntotal RNA from each sample were reverse-transcribed into\nthe complementary strand DNA using a high capacity\nreverse transcription reagent kit (Applied Biosystems,\nFoster City, California, USA).\nQuantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was\nperformed using TaqMan Universal master mix, and the\nTaq Man gene expression assay for rat IL-6 all supplied by\nApplied Biosystems (Foster City, California, USA).\nSamples were assayed in triplicates in 96 well plates using\nthe StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR Systems from Applied\nBiosystems. The widely accepted comparative Ct (thresh-\nold cycle) method was used to perform relative quantifica-\ntion of qPCR results.29 An arithmetic formula (fold\ndifference = 2-Ct) was used to calculate the relative\nIL-6 mRNA expression in Ang III-stimulated astrocyte\ncultures as compared to the unstimulated controls, after\nnormalization to levels of the housekeeping control gene,\nbeta-actin. Data are thus expressed as fold change in IL-6\nmRNA expression as compared to basal IL-6 mRNA\nexpression in unstimulated cells.\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are expressed as the mean\u00b1standard error of the\nmean (SEM) of six or more experiments, as indicated.\nT-tests or repeated measures of one-way analysis of vari-\nance (ANOVA) with Dunnett's post-test were used to com-\npare treatment groups with groups treated with no\nchemicals or those treated with the inhibitors, using\nPRISM (GraphPad). The criterion for statistical signifi-\nResults\nSTAT3 activation by Ang III\nIn previous studies we showed that Ang II rapidly induces\nSTAT3 phosphorylation in brainstem and cerebellar astro-\ncytes.17,18 To determine whether Ang III also activated\nSTAT3 in cultured astrocytes from neonatal rat cerebellum\nand brainstem astrocytes, cells were incubated with Ang III\nranging in concentrations from 0.1 nM to 1 \u00b5M. Ang III\nincreased the phosphorylation of STAT3 protein in a con-\ncentration-dependent manner (Figure 1). Maximal phos-\nphorylation was observed with 100 nMAng III in astrocytes\ncultured from the brainstem (3.0\u00b10.46 fold over basal,\nFigure 1(a)). Similarly, in astrocytes isolated from the cer-\nebellum, maximal effects were observed with 100 nM Ang\nstimulated STAT3 phosphorylation in both brainstem and\ncerebellar astrocytes in a time-dependent manner (Figure\n2). In both brainstem (Figure 2(a)) and cerebellum (Figure\n2(b)) astrocytes, significant phosphorylation occurred as\nearly as 1 min, with maximal effects observed by 10 min\n(Figure 2) suggesting that this Ang III effect was rapid and\nsustained. Comparison of effects in brainstem versus cere-\nbellum astrocytes showed no significant differences in the\nabilities of cells from these two regions to respond to the\npeptide. Our findings suggest that brainstem and cerebel-\nlum astrocytes cultured under the same conditions do not\ndiffer in their responses to Ang III in terms of potency and\ntime course of induction (See Figures 1 and 2).\nTo determine the specificity in this Ang III effect, qui-\nescent astrocytes were also pretreated for 15 min with the\nSTAT3 inhibitor Stattic (5 \u00b5M), and then stimulated with\n100 nMAng III for 10 min. Pretreatment of astrocytes with\nStattic attenuated Ang III-induced STAT3 phosphorylation\nby ~80% (brainstem) and 100% (cerebellum) suggesting\nthat this was a direct and select effect of Ang III to activate\ninduced STAT3 phosphorylation\nThe Ang receptor involved in this effect was determined\nby treating quiescent brainstem and cerebellar astrocytes\nwith 100 nM Ang III in the presence and absence of the\nselective AT1\nreceptor antagonist (losartan, 10 \u00b5M) or the\nselective AT2\nLosartan attenuated by more than 80% and 90% Ang III-\ninduced STAT3 phosphorylation in brainstem and cerebel-\nlum astrocytes, respectively (Table 1). The AT2\nreceptor\nantagonist was ineffective (Table 1). These findings sug-\ngest that Ang III interacts with the Ang AT1\nreceptor to\nactivate STAT3 in these cells.\nEffects of Stattic on Ang III-induced astrocyte\nDNA synthesis\nPrevious studies showed that Ang III significantly induced\nastrocyte DNA synthesis.14 To determine whether Ang III-\ninduced astrocyte growth involved STAT3, quiescent brain-\nstem and cerebellum astrocytes were pretreated with 5 \u00b5M\nFigure 1.

Quiescent monolayers of brainstem (1(a)) or cerebellum (1(b)) astrocytes were incubated for 10 min\nwith Ang III ranging in concentration from 0.1 nM to 1 \u00b5M. STAT3 protein phosphorylation was measured by Western blot analysis\nusing an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of STAT3. Protein loading was visualized using a non-phosphorylated\nSTAT3 antibody. The data were analyzed by densitometry and the amount of phosphorylation was calculated as the fold-increase\nover basal in the presence of vehicle after normalization with values obtained with the STAT3 antibody.

The results showed that Ang III significantly stim-\nulated brainstem and cerebellum astrocyte growth to a\nsimilar extent as we have previously observed (Table 2).\nWe also observed that pretreatment of quiescent astrocytes\nwith 5 \u00b5M Stattic completely prevented Ang III-mediated\nastrocyte growth in both brainstem and cerebellum astro-\ncytes (Table 2). These findings suggest that Ang III acti-\nvates STAT3 to induced astrocyte DNA synthesis, a\nmeasure of growth.\nEffects of Ang III on IL-6 mRNA expression\nTo investigate whether Ang III stimulated IL-6 mRNA\nexpression, astrocytes were stimulated for 45 min with\nconcentrations of Ang III ranging from 0.1 nM to 1 \u00b5M\nwith 10-fold increments in each concentration. As shown\nin Figure 3, Ang III induced IL-6 mRNA expression in a\nconcentration-dependent manner. Maximal effects were\nin brainstem astrocytes, and 1.9 \u00b10.3 fold over basal in\ncerebellum astrocytes). These findings suggest that the\npeptide had a similar potency in brainstem and cerebellum\nastrocytes to induce IL-6 mRNA expression.\nThe time course of Ang III-mediated IL-6 mRNA\nexpression was also investigated over a time period rang-\ning from 30 min to 24 h. As shown in Figure 4, Ang III\nenhanced the expression of IL-6 mRNAin a time-dependent\nmanner. In brainstem astrocytes (Figure 4(a)), there was a\nFigure 2.

Maximal mRNA\nexpression occurred after 3 h of treatment with 100 nM\nAng III (1.7\u00b10.2 fold over basal). Similarly in cerebellar\nastrocytes (Figure 4(b)), there was significant upregula-\ntion in IL-6 mRNA expression as early as 30 min and up\nto 3 h. The maximal Ang III-induced expression of IL-6\nmRNA was 2.6\u00b10.5 over basal observed at the 3 h time\npoint, with effects tapering off thereafter. 100 nM Ang III\ntreatments did not induce IL-6 mRNA expression after 24\nh of treatment in both brainstem and cerebellum astro-\ncytes (Figure 4).\nAng III-mediated IL-6 mRNA induction\nTo investigate whether STAT3 mediates Ang III-induced\nIL-6 mRNA expression, quiescent brainstem and cerebel-\nlar astrocytes were pretreated for 15 min with the STAT3\ninhibitor (Stattic, 5 \u00b5M) followed by stimulation with 100\nnM Ang III. Our results demonstrated that Stattic signifi-\ncantly downregulated Ang III-mediated IL-6 mRNA\nexpression by 80% and 60% in brainstem and cerebellum\nastrocytes, respectively (Table 3), suggesting that STAT3\nmediates Ang III-mediated IL-6 mRNA induction.\nCells were also treated with 100 nM Ang III in the pres-\nence and absence of the selective AT1\nreceptor antagonist\n(losartan, 10 uM) or the selective AT2\nreceptor blocker\ntion of IL-6 mRNA occurred through interaction at one of\nthe Ang receptors.

These findings suggest that Ang III interacts\nwith the Ang AT1\nreceptor leading to STAT3 induction and\nIL-6 mRNA expression.\nDiscussion\nIn recent years it has become clear that the central RAS is\nimportant in many pathophysiological conditions including\nhypertension, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarc-\ntion, and diabetic nephropathy.1,2 The importance of neu-\nrons in the brain is well established, but in recent years the\nrole of other cells such as astrocytes are now appreciated.\nSpecifically for the functions of the central RAS, astrocytes\nhave been shown to be important in the production of angi-\notensinogen, the precursor proteins for Ang II, Ang III and\nother physiologically relevant peptides produced by this\nTable 2.

The central effects of Ang II are well\nknown.1,2 Ang III has recently received attention as an\nimportant peptide produced by RAS, and even though\nsome controversy still exists in terms of the effects of Ang\nIII compared to Ang II, it is clear that the peptide is physi-\nologically important particularly in the control of blood\npressure, fluid homeostasis, and AVP release.6\nMost studies delineating the effects of Ang III have\nfocused on the binding affinity of the peptide to AT1\nrecep-\ntors or measured the effects of the peptide to modulate\nblood pressure11,12,31 with few studies delineating the intra-\ncellular mediators of these Ang III effects. The earlier\nsignaling pathways governing the effects of Ang III have\nbeen the recent focus of our laboratory. In cultured rat\nastrocytes, we showed that Ang III stimulated Ang AT1\nreceptor to induce the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and\nJNK MAP kinase pathways with the same potency as Ang\nII.14,15 These pathways were also shown to mediate Ang\nIII-induced astrocyte proliferation suggesting, at least in\nastrocytes, that these MAP kinase pathways mediate Ang\nIII effects. In neonatal cardiac fibroblasts Ang III induced\nprotein synthesis, DNA synthesis and collagen synthesis/\nsecretion in a concentration-dependent manner.8 Blume\net al.32 demonstrated in conscious rats that Ang III induced\nthe expression of the transcription factors c-Fos, c-Jun and\nKrox-24, effects mediated by the AT1\nreceptor.\nIn the current study we explored the ability of Ang III\nto activate STAT3, a member of the JAK/STAT family of\nproteins. This pathway is thought to be important in\ndevelopment and homeostasis33 and is a characteristic\npathway via which several cytokines elicit their responses.\nJAK/STAT signaling mediates several Ang II-induced\nthat apparently involve an increase in angiotensinogen\nlogical actions including induction of cell growth, cellu-\nlar development, and inflammation; it is also involved in\nseveral disease processes as well.19,37 The role of Ang III\nin inducing IL-6 levels is unknown. However, a link\nbetween Ang III and inflammation has been proposed. As\npreviously mentioned, it has been shown in rat mesangial\nand mononuclear cells that Ang III has pro-inflammatory\nFigure 4.

This effect is mediated by the\ninteraction of Ang III with the Ang AT1\nreceptor. Most\nimportantly, our results showed that the effects of Ang II\nand Ang III to induce STAT3 and IL-6 mRNA levels were\nequipotent since the magnitude of the Ang III effects\nobserved in our current samples were comparable to our\npreviously published Ang II results for Ang II effects on\nIL-6 mRNA expression.17,18 Future studies will be done to\ndetermine whether Ang III induces IL-6 protein levels and\nIL-6 protein secretion in a similar manner and pattern as\nAng II. Further, astrocytes isolated from the brainstem and\ncerebellum, were equally responsive to Ang III exhibiting\nsimilar sensitivity to the effects of the peptide to induce\nboth STAT3 protein and IL-6 mRNA expression.\nMultiple members of the STAT family of transcription\nfactors are known to mediate Ang II effects23,35 but the abil-\nity of Ang III to induce STAT family of transcription factors\nis unknown and the reason for our studies. We selected\nSTAT3 for our studies with Ang III because it protects\nagainst apoptosis and enhances cell proliferation.38 As we\nAng III induces cell proliferation in cerebellar and brain-\nstem astrocytes. Moreover, inhibition of STAT3 prevented\nAng III-mediated astrocyte proliferation. We have previ-\nously shown that Ang III stimulated the proliferation of rat\nastrocytes through the Ang AT1\nreceptor, an effect mediated\nfindings suggest that, along with the other intracellular sig-\nnals mentioned, STAT3 is also involved in Ang III growth-\npromoting effects as well as Ang III inflammatory actions.\nFurther, these studies also show that both Ang II17,18 and\nAng III can cause similar effects in astrocytes (increase\nDNA synthesis), and may use similar pathways, here the\nJAK2/STAT3 pathway, to achieve these effects. The mecha-\nnism responsible for astrocyte proliferation caused by Ang\nIII-induced STAT3 activation is unknown. However,\nSTAT3-mediated, IL-6-dependent T cell proliferation\noccurred through prevention of apoptosis suggesting a pos-\nsible pathway by which STAT3 may promote astrocyte pro-\nliferation.39 Future studies will be geared at determining the\nmechanism(s) by which this peptide induces STAT3 leading\nto an increase in DNA synthesis.\nIt is apparent that activated astrocytes contribute to cen-\ntral inflammatory effects and tissue repair as a participant\nin the local innate immune response triggered by a variety\nof insults.40,41 Astrocytes display an array of receptors\ninvolved in innate immunity, and astrocyte activation leads\nto cellular proliferation and secretion of a number of solu-\nble mediators, including IL-6, which impacts immune\nresponses.42\u00ad44 Thus, it is important to study the pathways\nthat lead to local immune responses (here, IL-6 production\nand astrocyte proliferation) in the brain. Moreover, it has\nbeen shown that STAT3 is a key regulator of reactive\nastrocytes in the healing process after spinal cord injury\nalso suggesting a role for this mediator in central inflam-\nmatory processes involving astrocytes.45 In this study, we\nare using an astrocyte-enriched culture system that to some\nextent is contaminated with microglia. Since cultured\nmicroglia express components of the RAS, and STAT3 is\npresent in these cells, it is possible that the astrocyte\nresponse we detect in this study is influenced by the small\nOver the last two decades, the RAS has become much\nmore complex with the identification of novel peptides\nsuch as Ang III that exhibit biological activity. Ang III\ninteracts at the same receptor as Ang II and is produced\nfrom the same precursor molecule angiotensinogen by a\nseries of reactions which included conversion of Ang II to\nAng III by the enzyme aminopeptidase A.6 This has led to\nthe discovery of a number of physiological effects that are\nsimilar between Ang II and Ang III. Actually, it has been\ntheorized that in the central nervous system it is Ang III\nthat is the active peptide not Ang II.12,48,49 However, this\ntheory has been invalidated due to a number of studies that\nAng II role in inflammation has been investigated in a\nnumber of systems;53\u00ad56 however, the role of Ang III in\ninflammatory processes is unknown. Thus, it is important\nthat we delineate whether Ang III also plays a key role in\ninflammation since a dysregulated central RAS is thought\nto be involved in inflammatory processes due to the sig-\nnificant increase in the production of brain angiotensino-\ngen during an inflammatory response.57 In addition, during\ncold injury angiotensinogen-deficient mice exhibits an\nattenuated glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expres-\nsion and decreased laminin levels in astrocytes; these defi-\nciencies result in an incomplete reconstitution of the blood\nbrain barrier.58 These findings suggest that during inflam-\nmation or physical trauma to the brain, there is dysregula-\ntion in the RAS which may lead to astrocyte proliferation\nand activation. Activated astrocytes, as previously men-\ntioned, are important in the body's response to inflamma-\ntion. Most importantly, this dysregulated RAS may involve\neffects of Ang II and Ang III as well.\nIndeed in our previous studies, we have shown that Ang\nII increases mRNA expression and release of the pro-\ninflammatory cytokine IL-6 from astrocytes, effects that\nwere mediated by the JAK/STAT pathway.17 Here we show\nfor the first time that Ang III also acts in a similar manner\ninducing STAT3 phosphorylation and IL-6 mRNA expres-\nsion. STAT3 and the AT1\nreceptor were shown to mediate\nthis Ang III effect. It is significant that Ang III induces\nIL-6 mRNA levels since this cytokine is a known mediator\nsion in a similar manner as Ang II, and these two peptides\nother physiological effects are mostly similar, it is plausi-\nble that both peptides may promote inflammatory pro-\ncesses in the brain via this inflammatory cytokine.\n766 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)\nConclusion\nOur studies are important in delineating RAS pathways\nthat may be important in inflammatory responses in areas\nof the central nervous system known to express Ang recep-\ntors and associated signaling pathways. It is important to\nestablish an association between inflammatory pathways\nand the RAS since these systems on their own are associ-\nated with diseases such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease,\nheart failure, and hypertension. Deleterious interactions\nbetween these two systems could make these conditions\neven more prevalent and validate the importance of study-\ning connections/crosstalk between these systems in the\nbrain in particular in glial cells.\n"
