We restricted the model to this\nage group because the age-related increase in HSV-2 is\nattenuated in individuals aged 40 years and older, while\nseroprevalence of HSV-2 is low before age 15 years.3,4\nHealth states in the model were broadly characterized as\ninfected or susceptible (i.e., uninfected) and were further\nstratified by age to capture heterogeneity in risk of infection\nand annual live birth rates in different age groups. The\nmodel assumed random, heterosexual mixing of the popu-\nlation.25 Infectiousness was assumed to be unrelated to the\npresence of symptomatic disease.26\nIndividuals enter and leave the model at a rate that is\ndefined by aging of the population and by the rate of\npopulation growth, estimated to be approximately 0.7% per\nyear.27 This model is described in further detail in Appendix\nThe rate at which HSV-2 is transmitted between men and\nwomen is a function of the infectiousness of sexual contact\nwith an infected individual, the rate of partner change\namong sexually active individuals, and the prevalence of\ninfection.25 While estimates of infectiousness of HSV-2\nexist,5,28\u00ad30 they are derived from monogamous heterosex-\nual couples and may not be applicable to the general het-\nerosexual population. Therefore, we estimated age- and\ngender-specific rates of acquisition of HSV-2, using the\nchanges observed in population prevalence of HSV-2 infec-\ntion between NHANES-II and NHANES-III. These studies\ncollected demographic data and serum from large, represen-\nWe calculated the rates of infection that would have\nbeen necessary to change the prevalence in a given age\ncohort in NHANES-II (e.g., 20\u00ad29-year-olds) to the\nprevalence observed in the next oldest age cohort (e.g.,\n30\u00ad39-year-olds) at the time of NHANES-III (Appendix\n2). The resulting estimates of initial age- and gender-\nspecific rates of HSV-2 acquisition are presented in Table\nfrom these studies were assumed to apply to the midpoint\nof the study. Age-specific seroprevalence estimates for\n1978 were used as initial model inputs in the age-strati-\nfied model (Table 1). The model was constructed with\nuse of Microsoft Excel version 6.0 (Microsoft Corpora-\ntionTM, Redmond, WA).\nNatural History of HSV-2 Infection\nIn the model, we stratified the infected health state such\nthat individuals with symptoms were distinguished from\nthose who were asymptomatic. Individuals who were symp-\ntomatic could initially experience a primary HSV-2 syn-\ndrome2,8 or could progress directly to a health state charac-\nterized by relapsing, remitting ulcerative genital disease.9\nEstimates of the probability of symptomatic genital her-\npes in an individual infected with HSV-2 vary widely.4,5,7,31\nIn NHANES-III, only 9% of individuals with serologic\nevidence of HSV-2 infection reported a prior diagnosis of\ngenital herpes.4 However, clinical evidence of genital her-\npes can be demonstrated in approximately 50% of asymp-\ntomatic individuals with serologic evidence of infection\nfollowed prospectively by experienced practitioners.7 We\nestimated the probability of symptomatic disease by com-\nparing the annual incidence of HSV-2 infection projected by\nour model with estimates of incident, symptomatic genital\nherpes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC, Atlanta).31 Such a comparison suggests that approx-\nimately 17% of infected individuals receive medical care for\nrecognized genital herpes.\nThe frequency with which individuals relapse varies\nwidely.10 We estimated a weighted average lifetime number\nof relapses by applying a linear decline in annual relapse\nrate to published gender-specific distributions of symptom\nfrequency in the first year of infection32 (Appendix 3).\nPregnancy and Maternal\u00adFetal Transmission\nAn important contributor to the health and economic\nconsequences of HSV-2 relates to infection and pregnancy\nand may result either from maternal\u00adfetal transmission of\nHSV-2, with resultant infection in the neonate,33\u00ad37 or from\nthe increased risk of cesarean section observed for women\nwith a history of symptomatic HSV-2 infection.38 We esti-\nmated the probability of pregnancy in women by using\naverage age-specific live birth rates for the US population\nModeling maternal\u00adfetal transmission of HSV-2 infec-\ntion is complicated by several factors, including possible\nchanges in sexual behavior and acquisition of HSV-2 infec-\ntion associated with pregnancy,39\u00ad41 the difficulty in esti-\nmating the incidence of spontaneous abortion due to early\ntrimester infections,42\u00ad44 and by protective effects associ-\ndata suggest that neonatal infection with either HSV-1 or\nHSV-2 usually occurs following maternal acquisition of\nassumed in the base case analysis that maternal\u00adfetal trans-\nmission of HSV-2 occurs exclusively in this context. We\nconservatively estimated the risk of third-trimester acquisi-\ntion of HSV-2 infection by calculating the decrease in risk\nof third-trimester maternal infection that would be neces-\nsary to explain the observed incidence of neonatal HSV\ninfection. These calculations are described in detail in Ap-\nCurrent published guidelines48\u00ad50 advocate cesarean de-\nlivery in women with known genital herpes if herpetic\nlesions are present at the time of labor. However, practicing\nobstetricians may perform cesarean delivery for women\nwith a history of genital herpes, even in the absence of\nvisible lesions,51,52 and there appears to be an absolute\nincrease of approximately 20% in the probability of cesar-\nean section among American women with known genital\nherpes.38 We estimated the future increase in cesarean sec-\ntions among women with symptomatic HSV-2 infection as\nthe product of the expected number of future term pregnan-\ncies and the absolute increase in risk of cesarean section\nassociated with a history of genital herpes. These calcula-\ntions are described in detail in Appendix 5.\nCosts\nSelected cost inputs for the model are presented in Table\nHSV-2 accrued medical costs due to hospitalization (if they\nexperienced a severe primary HSV-2 syndrome), physician\nvisits and drugs prescribed for symptomatic episodes and\nlong-term suppressive therapy, and the excess occurrence of\ncesarean sections among women with a history of genital\nherpes.38,53 It was assumed that patients would be treated in\naccordance with the 1998 CDC Guidelines for Treatment of\nSexually Transmitted Diseases.48\nDirect medical costs resulting from neonatal herpes sim-\nplex virus infection were estimated as a weighted average of\ncosts associated with neonatal herpes without sequelae,\nneonatal herpes causing death, and neonatal herpes resulting\nyear were estimated as a weighted average of the costs of\ncaring for infants with skin, eye, and mucous membrane\nTABLE 1.

In the absence of primary genital herpes, the first symptomatic episode was assumed to have an average duration\nof 4 days, equivalent to the duration of recurrent episodes of genital herpes.\ndisease (SEM), herpetic encephalitis, and disseminated neo-\nnatal HSV infection.38 Infants who survived with moderate\nor severe neurologic sequelae were projected to incur addi-\ntional lifetime medical and long-term care costs, based on\npublished estimates of the future costs of caring for children\nwith neurologic impairment.37,56 Our model also included\npatient time costs associated with travel, waiting room time,\nand time spent receiving medical care.\nThe total future cost of HSV-2 infection for an individual\nwas discounted to present value with use of a 3% real\ndiscount rate.58 Thus, we estimated the total cost of infec-\ntion for that individual as though the entire future stream of\nmedical and nonmedical costs resulting from HSV-2 infec-\ntion had to be paid for at the time of the initial infection. The\nannual costs attributable to incident HSV-2 infection in the\nUnited States were estimated as the product of the projected\nnumber of incident infections and the average present value\nof the costs attributable to a single HSV-2 infection. Both\nundiscounted estimates and estimates discounted to present\nvalue were calculated. All costs were converted to year-\n2000 US dollars with use of the US Consumer Price Index\nfor medical goods and services.57\nSensitivity Analysis\nWe performed sensitivity analysis by varying param-\neter values over plausible ranges, in order to assess the\nrobustness of our projections in the face of reasonable\nvariation in data inputs. We also performed best-case and\nworst-case analyses by running the model using upper\nand lower bounds of parameters to which our results\nproved sensitive.\nIn our best-case estimates, we assumed that the true\nprevalence of HSV-2 infection in the United States. was\nrepresented by upper 95% confidence limits reported from\nNHANES-II and by lower 95% confidence limits reported\nfrom NHANES-III. This would result in an attenuated es-\ntimate of the force of infection acting on the population\nduring that time period, as the true increase in HSV-2\nless. Conversely, our worst-case estimates assumed that the\ntrue prevalence of HSV-2 infection in the United States. was\nrepresented by lower 95% confidence limits from\nNHANES-II and upper 95% confidence limits from\nNHANES-III, which would result in estimation of a larger\nforce of infection than in the base case simulation.\nTABLE 2.

In the best-case projections,\nit was assumed true that HSV-2 prevalence was\nunderestimated by the National Health and Nu-\ntrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\u00adII and\noverestimated by NHANES-III; worst-case pro-\njections assumed overestimation of prevalence\nin NHANES-II and underestimation in\nHSV-2 necessary to produce the change in seroprevalence\nseen in the United States between the late 1970s and early\n1990s would project a continued increase in the incidence\nand prevalence of HSV-2 infection in the early 21st century.\nOur base case simulation projected a modest increase in\nchronic nature of HSV-2 infection, this was projected to\nproduce an almost twofold increase in the prevalence of\nHSV-2 infection during the same time period. We estimate\nthat the cumulative economic consequences of such an\nincrease would be substantial.\nIn our base case simulation, the prevalence of HSV-2\ninfection reached a plateau during the second half of the\n21st century. Our projections of equilibrium prevalence in\nthe population aged 15 to 39 years as a whole are similar to\ncurrent estimates of HSV-2 prevalence among blacks,\nwhich did not change substantially between 1978 and\nfor this difference would be that the HSV-2 epidemic is\nmore mature and nearer to equilibrium in the African Amer-\nican population.\nOur initial estimates of HSV-2 transmission rates, using\ndata from NHANES-II and NHANES-III, reproduced the\nchange in prevalence that was reported between the late\nincident cases of HSV-2 infection during that time are\nsimilar to those generated by Armstrong and colleagues,\nusing the same data but a different statistical model.60 For\nexample, Armstrong and colleagues estimated approxi-\nmately 1.34 million new infections with HSV-2 among\nwith 1.48 million new infections projected by our model.\nOur projection of HSV-2 prevalence in the late 1990s is\nhigher than that reported during the first year of the\nfact that sexual behavior remained constant in our model,\nwhereas sexual behaviors that would affect HSV-2 trans-\nmission (particularly numbers of sex partners and rates of\ncondom use) may have changed in the 1990s, perhaps as a\nresult of the AIDS epidemic.63\u00ad65 Increased use of antiviral\ndrugs or cyclic variation in sexual risk behavior, as has been\nseen with the US AIDS epidemic66\u00ad68 and previously with\nthe syphilis epidemic,69,70 might explain the discrepancy\nbetween our model outputs and these data. Alternatively,\nthis discrepancy may reflect the preliminary nature of the\nNHANES-IV data or the regional nature of annual sampling\nin the NHANES studies. Future updates on NHANES-IV\nwill permit ongoing calibration of our model.\nMaternal-fetal transmission of HSV-2 infection is\nthought to occur with high frequency when maternal infec-\ntion occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy and with\nmuch lower frequency with chronic maternal infec-\nmission to women with third-trimester infection; even so,\nour base case analysis projected rates of neonatal HSV-2\ninfection higher than those reported in the population.46,59\nWhen we added the possibility of transmission by chroni-\ncally infected women, the difference between our projec-\ntions and empirical estimates grew even larger. Other au-\nthors have also noted that mathematical estimates of\nneonatal HSV-2 are larger than empirically reported\nrates.34,46,61 An important attribute of models such as this\none is their ability to highlight discrepancies such as this\none. This suggests that the epidemiology of neonatal herpes\nvirus infection is incompletely understood and highlights\nthe importance of this area for future research.\nWe purposefully chose to focus on the costs of incident\ndisease, rather than combine costs of incident and prevalent\nHSV-2 infection, and we valued the total expected future\nstream of costs generated by an incident infection as a cost\nincurred at the time of infection. Given that goals for HSV-2\ncontrol focus on prevention of incident infections, empha-\nsizing the cost of incident disease highlights modifiable\ncosts of the HSV-2 epidemic and makes our model poten-\ntially useful for assessing the cost-effectiveness of herpes\ncontrol interventions. Because the costs associated with\ngenital herpes are \"front-loaded,\" (i.e., severe medical se-\nquelae, including neonatal infections, are most likely to\nrelapse decreases with time,32 the impact of this assumption\nis blunted.\nOur annual direct medical cost estimates are higher than\nsome existing estimates, which have ranged from $100\ncosts of genital herpes 1996 (including patients' time and\nlost wages) at $1.2 billion.74 However, although we may\nhave overestimated the amount of medical care required by\nHSV-2-infected individuals, we have certainly underesti-\nmated some costs associated with HSV-2 infection, such as\ncosts associated with enhanced HIV transmission among\nindividuals with genital herpes75\u00ad77 and economic costs\nassociated with the physical pain, depression, disruption of\nthat may accompany HSV-2 infection.\nIn addition, other published estimates, particularly those\nderived from large databases, may be underestimates. For\nexample, Tao and colleagues38 estimated that only 13% to\n28% of acyclovir claims not associated with a specific\ndiagnostic code were for the treatment of genital herpes. As\ndrugs accounted for over half the costs attributed to genital\nherpes, underestimation of drug costs would substantially\ndecrease the estimated annual cost of genital herpes. When\nwe removed drug costs associated with chronic suppressive\nantiviral therapy from our model, in conjunction with our\nlower-bound estimate for the probability of symptomatic\ndisease, our direct medical cost estimate for 1993 decreased\ngenerated by Tao and colleagues.\nOur model has additional important limitations. We did\nnot stratify our population according to ethnicity due to the\ndifficulty in making assumptions about interethnic sexual\nmixing.82,83 However, the higher prevalence of HSV-2 in-\nfection among blacks relative to the population as a whole3,4\nsuggests that the burden of morbidity and economic cost\nassociated with incident HSV-2 infection falls dispropor-\ntionately on this population.\nWe used a mathematical model to project the future costs\nand consequences of the HSV-2 epidemic in the United\nStates. Given the future economic burden that is likely to be\nimposed on society by the HSV-2 epidemic, substantial\ninvestment in HSV-2 prevention strategies makes economic\nsense. The recent development of inexpensive serologic\nassays for the detection of asymptomatic HSV-2 infec-\nvide superior means of control of the HSV-2 epidemic in the\nUnited States. Programs incorporating these new technolo-\ngies are anticipated to be expensive, but in light of the large\ncosts that the HSV-2 epidemic is projected to impose, such\nprograms may prove to be cost-effective or cost-saving.\nAppendix 1: Compartmental Model for Genital HSV-2\nInfection\nWe constructed a compartmental model to simulate the\ncourse of the HSV-2 epidemic in individuals aged 15 to 39\nyears in the United States. Health states in the model were\nbroadly characterized as infected (I) or susceptible to infec-\ntion (S). Assuming random, heterosexual mixing of the\npopulation, susceptible individuals would become infected\nin proportion to the prevalence of infection among members\nof the opposite sex at some time\nt\n Iot\nIot\n Sot\n,\nthe annual probability of sexual transmission of HSV-2\nwithin a sexual partnership (), and the age- and gender-\nspecific weighted average number of partners per person in\nOur model incorporated three age strata: stratum 1 in-\ncluded those aged 15 to 19 years, stratum 2 included those\nto 39 years. We developed a series of difference equations\nto calculate the annual number of susceptible and infected\nindividuals in each age stratum.\nSusceptible Individuals\nThe first, youngest age stratum comprises individuals\nwho have just become sexually active. Because no individ-\nual is infected with HSV-2 before initiating sexual activity,\nthe number of susceptible individuals in this stratum at\nsome time t  1 will be equal to the number of individuals\nremaining in this stratum at time t (i.e., the number not lost\ndue to age or acquisition of infection), plus those individuals\nwho enter the stratum by reaching an age at which sexual\nactivity is initiated. The number of individuals entering the\nyoungest stratum by initiating sexual activity will be pro-\nportional to the size of the youngest age stratum (both\ninfected and susceptible individuals). Individuals move out\nof the youngest susceptible age stratum either by growing\nolder or by acquiring HSV-2 infection.\nThe number of individuals in the youngest age stratum at\nsome time t  1 will be the number of susceptible individ-\nuals:\n \n Iot\nIot\n Sot\n \nwhere the constants \nand \nrepresent the rate at which\nindividuals move in and out of the youngest age stratum,\nrespectively, the constant c1\nis the product of the infectiv-\nity of HSV-2 and the rate of partner change in the youngest\nage stratum, and the term\n Iot\nIot\n Sot\n\nrepresents the prevalence of HSV-2 infection among mem-\nbers of the opposite sex at some time t. The rate at which\nindividuals move out of the youngest age stratum, \n, is\ndefined as 1/D, where D is the duration of that age stratum.\nFor a given rate of population growth, g, the term \nwill be\nequivalent to (1  g)/D.\nFor all subsequent age strata, the rate at which susceptible\nindividuals enter the stratum is a function of the size and\nduration of the next youngest age stratum, Si  1\n. For the ith\nage stratum, the number of susceptible individuals in the\nstratum at some time t  1 will be:\n Sit\n \ni\n ci\nSit\n Iot\nIot\n Sot\nSit\nSumming across all n age strata, the number of suscep-\ntible individuals in the population at some time t  1 will\nbe:\nSt\n\n)\n\nn ci\nSit\n Iot\nIot\nSot\nSnt\nInfected Individuals\nThe number of infected individuals in the first, youngest age\nstratum at time t  1 will be equal to the number of\nindividuals infected at time t, plus those who acquired\ninfection during the interval between t and t  1, minus\nthose individuals who leave the youngest age stratum by\ngrowing older:\nSt\n Iot\nIot\nSot\n\nIn subsequent age strata, the number of infected individ-\nuals in the ith stratum at some time t  1 will be equal to the\nnumber of infected individuals in that stratum at time t, plus\nthose individuals infected in younger age strata who enter\nthe stratum by growing older and those individuals with\nnewly acquired infections, minus those individuals who\nleave the stratum by growing older:\nIit\n\nt\nci\nSit\n Iot\nIot\nSot\n\nIit\nSumming across all n age strata, the number of infected\nindividuals in the population at time t  1 will be\nIt\n\n\nn ci\nSit\n Iot\nIot\nSot\n\nInt\nAppendix 2: Estimation of Rates of Partner Change\nThe rate at which HSV-2 is transmitted between men and\nwomen is a function of the infectiousness of sexual contact\nwith an infected individual (), the rate of partner change\n(c) among sexually active individuals, and the average prev-\nalence of infection among members of the opposite sex:\n Io\nIo\n So\n\nThus, the rate of acquisition of HSV-2 infection within\nthe ith age stratum may be represented as\n\ni\n c\ni\n Io\nIo\n So\nwhere \ni\nis the \"force of infection\" in the ith age stratum, or\nthe rate at which infection is acquired by susceptible indi-\ni\ncan also be represented as\n\ni\n\nis the prevalence of infection in the ith age group\nat some time t1\n, while pt0\nis the prevalence in the ith age\ngroup at some earlier time t0\n, and t is equal to the time\nelapsed between t1\n. For a given age cohort, we\nestimated pt1\nas prevalence in that age cohort at the time of\nNHANES-III, while pt0\nwas estimated as the prevalence in\nthe next youngest age cohort at the time of NHANES-II. We\nestimated t as 13 years, the time elapsed between the\nGiven equations (2.1) and (2.2), and assuming some\naverage seroprevalence in the opposite sex between t0\nand\n, the product of the infectiousness of an individual with\nHSV-2 and the rate of partner change in a given age cohort,\n(c)i\n, can be estimated as\n(c)i\n\nIo\nSo\nIo\n))\nWe attempted to derive rates of partner change using\nother sexual mixing assumptions, including complete age-\nassortative mixing (i.e., individuals choose partners from\nwithin only their own age group),25 and using several less\nextreme forms of age-assortative mixing (e.g., men mix\nwith women from their own and younger age groups at one\nrate and with older women at another rate, while women\nbehave in the opposite manner). The use of age-assortative\nmixing resulted in extremely high estimates of HSV-2 se-\nroprevalence in the early 1990s. The use of a matrix alge-\nbraic approach96 demonstrated that other mixing patterns\nwere mathematically implausible.\nAppendix 3: Projection of Future Number of Relapses\nand Relapse-Associated Costs\nWe calculated weighted average relapse rates in the year\nafter infection from published distributions of symptom\nfrequency. Suppose n different frequencies of symptomatic\nrelapse are observed in a population in the first year after\ndevelopment of symptomatic genital herpes. The weighted\naverage rate of relapse in the first year may be represented\nas\n\nn\nPq\nLq\nwhere Lq\nis the rate of relapse in the qth stratum, while Pq\nis\nthe proportion of the population in the qth stratum. The\nfrequency of relapse in individuals with symptomatic gen-\nital HSV-2 infection appears to decrease in a linear fashion\nover time.10 If the annual change in the number of relapses\nfor a given individual is L, that individual will cease to\nexperience relapses at time tend\nsuch that\nLq\n Ltend\ntend\n\nLq\nL\nThe total number of future relapses can be represented as\na sum of the sum of relapses over time, or\n\nn\nPq\n\ntend\n(Lq\nThe average per-relapse cost at some time t, represented\nas Crelapse\n(t) will change over time, as individuals who have\nhigh initial rates of relapse are likely to be given chronic\nsuppressive antiviral therapy, while those with lower re-\nlapse rates will be treated with intermittent antiviral therapy.\nIn a population with n different relapse rates, the average\npresent value of total relapse-associated costs among indi-\nviduals with symptomatic disease can be calculated as\n\nn\nPq\n\ntend\n(Lq\nLt)  Crelapse\n(t) \nwhere\nrepresents the discount factor, with a 3% annual discount\nrate and discounting at the beginning of each year.\nAppendix 4: Incidence and Costs of Maternal\u00adFetal\nTransmission Among Women With Third-Trimester\nHSV-2 Infection\nTransmission of HSV-2 infection from a pregnant woman\nto a neonate occurs most commonly in the context of new\nmaternal infection in the third trimester of pregnancy, with\ndelivery occurring before the development of humoral im-\nmunity to HSV-2 in the mother.12 Transmission of HSV-2\ninfection to the neonates of women with chronic HSV-2\ninfection appears to be much less efficient.11 In our base\ncase analysis, we assumed that maternal\u00adfetal transmission\nof HSV-2 occurred exclusively in the context of third-\ntrimester infection.\nIn a woman with incident HSV-2 infection, the probabil-\nity of transmission of HSV-2 to a neonate will be a function\nof the probability that the woman is in the third trimester at\nthe time of initial infection. The expected fraction of a year\nduring which a woman will be in the third trimester of\npregnancy will be approximately\nwhere\nis the live birth rate in a woman in the ith age stratum. The\n\"force of infection\" among initially susceptible women in\nthe third trimester, \nthird\n, will be related to the prevalence of\ninfection in the opposite sex, as in equation (2.1) above.\nHowever, it might be expected that the rate of partner\nchange and the type of sexual activities engaged in during\nthe third trimester of pregnancy would be different from\nthose in the nonpregnant population, such that\n \nthird\nwhere \nthird\nis the product of the rate of transmission within\na partnership and the rate of partner change among women\nin the third trimester of pregnancy. However, \nthird\nwill\ndiffer from c in the population as a whole by some con-\nstant k, such that\nk  \nthird\nThus, the \"force of infection\" in the third trimester would\nbe\n\nthird\n kc\n Io\nIo\n So\nand the probability of third-trimester infection among ini-\ntially susceptible women in the ith age stratum would be\n \nthird\nThe probability of maternal\u00adfetal transmission among\ninitially susceptible women in a given age stratum is\n \nthird\n PTRthird\nwhere\nPTRthird\nis the probability of perinatal transmission of HSV-2 infec-\ntion from a woman to a neonate, given third-trimester\ninfection.\nFrom equation (4.2) we can see that in a population with\nn age strata, the annual number of infants with HSV-2\ninfection is estimated to be\n\nn\n\ni\nSi\n k  PTRthird\nThe costs associated with transmission of HSV-2 to a\nneonate as a result of third-trimester infection will be\n\nn\n\ni\nSi\n k  PTRthird\nwhere CN\nis the present value of the total costs associated\nwith neonatal HSV-2 infection.\nThe constant k was estimated by calibrating the model\nsuch that the model output matched empirical data on the\n1981, the incidence of neonatal herpes infection in King\nCounty, Washington, was reported to be 11.9 cases per\ntal herpes infection were due to HSV-2 infection; thus, the\nincidence of neonatal HSV-2 infection was estimated to be\nOn the basis of the estimates of incident HSV-2 infection\nprovided by our model and using age-specific live birth\nrates, we estimated the number of third-trimester HSV-2\nyears to be 8670k.

We assumed that changes in\nsexual behavior associated with the third trimester of preg-\nnancy remained constant over time and used k to estimate\nthe projected future number of cases of neonatal HSV-2\ninfection resulting from third-trimester maternal infection.\nAppendix 5: The Incidence and Costs of Obstetrical\nComplications of Chronic HSV-2 Infection\nIn our base-case analysis, we assumed that all maternal-\nfetal transmission of HSV-2 would result from third-trimes-\nter maternal infection. However, there is likely a small risk\nof maternal\u00adfetal transmission of HSV-2 even for women\nwith chronic HSV-2 infection. In addition, women with a\nhistory of chronic HSV-2 infection appear to be more likely\nto undergo cesarean section, in part because of existing\nrecommendations that cesarean section be performed if vis-\nible genital lesions are present in the mother at the time of\ndelivery, although practicing obstetricians may be more\nlikely to perform cesarean sections on women with a history\nof symptomatic HSV-2 even in the absence of visible le-\nThe cumulative future risks of cesarean section and of\nmaternal\u00adfetal transmission of HSV-2 as a result of chronic\nmaternal infection will be a function of the age at which\ninitial HSV-2 infection is acquired, as individuals who are\ninfected at a younger age will have, on average, more future\nterm pregnancies and thus more future chances to incur\nobstetrical complications of chronic HSV-2 infection.\nIf a woman in the ith age stratum becomes infected, on\naverage, in the middle of that age stratum, she will have z\nfuture years of potential child-bearing, such that:\nz \nDi\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Dn\nwhere D is the duration of a given age stratum and n is the\ntotal number of age strata during which childbearing is\npossible. We made the simplifying assumption that a\nwoman would not be at risk for obstetrical complications of\nchronic HSV-2 infection until the year after acute infection.\nFor a woman infected at some time t  0, the average\nnumber of future pregnancies that might be complicated by\nchronic HSV-2 infection would be\n\nz\nFor an individual with symptomatic HSV-2 infection and\nz future years of childbearing, the average total number of\nexcess cesarean sections resulting from symptomatic infec-\ntion with HSV-2 was estimated to be\nP(cesarean)\n\n\nz\nwhere P(cesarean)\nis the excess probability of cesarean\nsection associated with a history of symptomatic HSV-2\ninfection (estimated to be approximately 20%).38 The\npresent value (at the time of incident infection in the\nmother) of the future stream of costs due to excess cesarean\nsections and neonatal HSV-2 infection secondary to chronic\nmaternal infection would be approximately\nP(cesarean)\n\n\nz PLBt\n\nC(cesarean)\nwhere Ccesarean\nrepresents the excess costs associated with\ncesarean (as opposed to vaginal) delivery, and\nrepresents the discount factor, with a 3% annual discount\nrate and discounting at the beginning of each year.\nSimilarly, if\nPTRchron\nis the probability of maternal\u00adfetal transmission of HSV-2\nby a chronically infected mother, the average future inci-\ndence of neonatal infection resulting from chronic maternal\ninfection with HSV-2 would be approximately\nPTRchron\n\n\nz\nwhile the average present value of future costs due to\nmaternal\u00adfetal transmission of HSV-2 would be\nPTRchron\n\n\nz PLBt\n\nCneonatal\nwhere Cneonatal\nrepresents the present value of the costs of\nneonatal infection at the time of neonatal infection.\nWe evaluated the health and economic impacts of mater-\nnal-fetal transmission of HSV-2 resulting from chronic ma-\nternal infection by assigning\nPTRchron\nReferences\n1.
