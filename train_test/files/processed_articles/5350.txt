    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe contemporary school environment in England has been identified as stressful for both staff and pupils. School-based\ninterventions aimed at improving well-being and mental health have shown mixed results. The Principle Based Model (PBM)\nof Mind, Consciousness, and Thought is an untried intervention in English schools and as a working model there is a paucity\nof research into its potential. The aim of this mixed-methods pilot study was to investigate the effectiveness of the PBM as a\nmeans of increasing the psychological well-being of staff and pupils. The study was a 16-week pre, post, and follow-up study\nusing the Friedman Well-Being Scale (FWBS) as a measure of psychological well-being, and analyzed using matched sample\nt tests and repeated measures ANOVA. The study was carried out in a high school in the east of England with 10 staff and\nnine pupils. The staff and pupils involved received the PBM as a psychoeducational program. During the follow-up period,\nsix members of staff and one pupil were interviewed and the transcripts analyzed using Thematic Analysis. The pre to post\ntotal FWBS scores showed an increase in psychological well-being for both staff and pupils but only the change for pupils was\nstatistically significant. Post to follow-up total FWBS scores for both staff and pupils showed no significant change. This study\nprovides some initial evidence to suggest that the PBM may be a useful tool for schools to utilize in attempting to increase\npsychological well-being.\n",

Previous governments have invested in large-\nscale programs aimed at enhancing pupils' social and emo-\ntional well-being, especially through the Social and\nEmotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) program, which was\nexplicitly linked to learning, behavior, and attendance The\nSEAL program was extensively evaluated with mixed results\nThe introduction of the new national curriculum under the\ncoalition government sidelined SEAL although schools have\nbeen able to keep aspects of it.\nThis article reports on a small, mixed-methods pilot study\nof an intervention aimed to improve the well-being of both\nstaff and pupils through the use of the Principle Based Model\n(PBM; described below). Although there are overlaps with\nSEAL especially in SEAL's relationship with self and rela-\ntionship with others part of the framework (Garner & Gains,\n1996), PBM comes with a broader purpose and is not con-\nstrained to furthering school aims.\nThe heavy cost to the system of stress, depression, and\nanxiety has been highlighted by Troman (2000). The\nAssociation of Teachers and Lecturers has also shown con-\ncerns over the increasing number of youth committing or\nattempting to commit suicide, suggesting that academic\ndemands placed on pupils alongside peer pressure are con-\ntributing toward this dramatic increase (Kelley, 2004). Since\n1999, education has been a devolved responsibility in the\nUnited Kingdom. Therefore, the Scottish Parliament and the\nAssemblies of Wales and Northern Ireland have been able to\nset their own education policies. This study was conducted in\nEngland and, thus, the context concentrates on previous\nresearch in English schools.\n1University of Essex, Colchester, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nDavid J.

Pevalin1\n Keywords\nachievement, education, social sciences, educational research, schools, students, applied psychology, psychology\n2 SAGE Open\nA recent classroom-based, depression prevention, cogni-\ntive behavioural therapy (CBT) program for pupils in\nEngland was rigorously assessed using a randomized con-\ntrol trial design and found that the intervention did not\nreduce depressive symptoms in adolescents at high-risk for\ndepression compared to usual school provision (Stallard et\nbased interventions should not be undertaken without fur-\nther research. A qualitative evaluation of the same program\nindicated that although the program had some good features\nsuch as relevance of material, especially for younger pupils,\nthere were issues with the lack of flexibility and consistency\nof quality (Taylor et al., 2014). An earlier geographically\nbroader review concluded that targeted interventions, as\nopposed to universal ones, had great efficacy, that most\nschool-based interventions used a CBT structure, and over-\nall the results were mixed with only half the studies report-\ning improvements at posttest or follow-up (Calear &\nChristensen, 2010). Regardless of these findings, the case\nfor supporting adolescents during school had generally been\nmade and most of the discussions are about how to provide\nsuch services and if teachers are the most appropriate ones\nto deliver such programs (Dewhirst et al., 2014; Kidger,\nDonovan, Biddle, Campbell, & Gunnell, 2009; Kidger,\nGunnell, Biddle, Campbell, & Donovan, 2010). However,\nthe current government has reduced the emphasis on pupils'\nemotional well-being in the English education system\nTeachers' occupational stress has been the subject of\nmuch research with well-established factors (Salter-Jones,\nteachers have been shown to have worse psychological\nwell-being than their European counterparts (Griva &\nJoekes, 2003). Despite the amount of empirical evidence on\nteachers' stress and psychological well-being, they have not\nbeen the subject of interventions designed to help with some\nsmall-scale exceptions (Annan & Moore, 2012; Troman,\nFrom the perspective of the PBM, the negative behaviors\nand symptoms displayed within the school environment\ncould be alleviated if people were given the opportunity to\nunderstand their own part in the psychological construction\nof their feelings. Pransky and McMillen (2013) explained\nthat at the core of the PBM, the focus is not on what we think\nabout, but the power of thought through which we all experi-\nence life.\nThe three principles in the PBM are as follows: Mind, the\nsource of all intelligence; Consciousness, which allows us to\nbe aware of our existence; and Thought, which guides us\nthrough the world we live in as free-thinking agents. Banks\n(1998) explained it this way, \"[w]hen you start to see the\npower of Thought and its relationship to your way of\nobserving life, you will better understand yourself and the\nworld in which you live\" (p. 52). The PBM has been known\nby a number of names: Psychology of Mind, Innate Health,\nand as Health Realization or simply \"Principle-Based.\"\nFuller descriptions and background to the PBM have been\npresented in this and other forums (e.g., Kelley, 2003a;\nhow the PBM could be administered by looking toward the\nhealth in clients rather than illness and that once an individ-\nual begins to understand what role thought plays in the cre-\nation of their lives, they have more of a tendency to use\nthinking more efficiently. Furthermore, once people begin to\nsee the role of thought, the end result is generally a quieter,\nless busy mind, which ultimately leads to a calmer and more\npositive state, without the need to attempt the removal of so-\ncalled negative thinking. In other words, seeing thought as\nthe defining factor in how we see life, leads to a freeing up of\nthe energy more commonly expended in the endeavor to deal\nwith life's ups and downs.\nThe primary focus of the PBM is the health of the indi-\nvidual and not the details of their individual lives or their self\nperceived problems and difficulties. Thus, it becomes not a\nway to reduce stress or anxiety directly, or to attempt to fix\nindividual thoughts or problems, but as a solution to all of\nlife's ups and downs by seeing their source as coming from\nperception of life via personal thinking.\nKelley (2003a) charted the course of research using the\nPBM, the vast majority being conducted in the United States.\nFirst, the focus was on using the model as a therapeutic\napproach for adults with, usually, depression. Then the model\nbegan to be used in community empowerment programs;\nnotably Modello and Homestead Gardens (Pransky, 1998)\nand Avalon Gardens (Borg, 2002). These community-based,\nmainly qualitative, studies produced impressive results for\nreductions in crime and increased attendance and achieve-\nment in the local schools. Kelley's own research has applied\nthe PBM to the issue of school violence (Kelley, 2003b;\nKelley et al., 2005) and in the police and correctional ser-\nvices professions (Kelley, 2005). Furthermore, the PBM has\nbeen shown to have comparable results to a 12-step program\nin a female drug treatment program (Banerjee, Howard,\nMansheim, & Beattie, 2007) and has been used as the basis\nfor an intervention to improve coping and well-being in refu-\ngee women (Halc\u00f3n, Robertson, & Monsen, 2010; Halc\u00f3n,\nNo previous research has been published on the PBM in\nschools outside the United States and using pre- and postint-\nervention, individual measures of well-being. In this study,\nwe hypothesize that the PBM intervention will result in\nincreased well-being for both staff and pupils.\nMethod\nThis study was a quantitative/qualitative (QUANT + qual)\n(Morgan, 1998), single-group, pre, post, and follow-up\nRees-Evans and Pevalin 3\ndesign study (Figure 1), collecting primary data using the\nFriedman Well-Being Scale (FWBS). Post study in-depth\ninterviews were carried out at the conclusion of the project,\ntranscribed, entered into Max QDA 2, coded, and examined\nfor themes using ThematicAnalysis (Bryman, 2004). Written\nconsent was obtained from all participants, including paren-\ntal consent for the pupils. The school head teacher gave per-\nmission for the study and the University of Essex granted\nresearch ethics approval.\nSetting/Location\nThe study was carried out at a high school in the east of\nEngland with an average Ofsted report record. The school\nwas in a central town setting with a wide catchment area tak-\ning children from both rural and urban homes. The school\nalso had a relatively high proportion of ethnic minority group\npupils in comparison with other local schools. In addition, a\nproportion of children came from socially deprived back-\ngrounds as the town has three of the top 13 most deprived\ncouncil wards in England.\nRecruitment\nThe recruitment process began with a series of discussions\nwith the head teacher of the school, followed by a presenta-\ntion about the study to the entire teaching staff.\nAfter the presentation, all interested staff were given a\nhandout detailing the outline and time requirements for the\nstudy along with a consent form. For pupils, an information\nletter and consent forms were sent home to parents of all Year\nTen pupils. The pupils who volunteered were given a simpli-\nfied outline sheet for their information and a consent form.\nSample\nUpon recruitment, 10 staff and nine pupils volunteered to\nparticipate in the study. The sample of both staff and pupils\nwas self-selected following the open recruitment messages at\nthe school. Two staff members did not complete the follow-\nup data collection and one pupil withdrew from the study\nduring the intervention phase, leaving eight staff members\nand eight pupils who completed all stages. At recruitment,\nthe 10 staff consisted of six males and four females with an\naverage age of 46 years. The pupil sample consisted of six\nmales and three females and all pupils were either 14 or 15\nyears of age.\nIntervention\nThe PBM sessions were facilitated by D.R.-E. and a col-\nleague, who are both trained PBM practitioners, over an\n8-week period with both groups. The pupils' intervention\ntook place over two extended evenings at the school, and for\nthe staff, the study began with a 2-day intervention at an off-\nsite location. During the first 2 days, both the pupils and staff\nwere introduced to philosophy of the Three Principles, espe-\ncially focusing on the idea of Thought, as a principle, creat-\ning individual reality.\nThe staff and pupil sessions had a similar loose structure,\nand much of the same material was covered in both. However,\nwith the pupils, more of an emphasis was placed on under-\nstanding self-esteem, via the power of Thought. In addition,\nit was explained to both groups how the feelings of empow-\nerment or disempowerment are usually a direct result of how\nwe view the world and how we view the situations that we\nfind ourselves in, via the power of Thought.\nOne important aspect of the training for the pupils was the\nexamination of seeing past the impersonal nature of interac-\ntions with other people, that is, beginning to recognize that the\nmood level of teachers, parents, siblings, or peers was simply\na result of the other persons thinking, and nothing personal to\nthem, despite the fact that it appeared that way sometimes.\nBoth groups were encouraged to see this understanding of\nthe power of Thought as a generalization, that is, that this\nrecognition of how Thought plays a contingent part of what\nwe can potentially take for granted as coming from the out-\nside (i.e., objective pressure). Contrasted with seeing pres-\nsure as coming from within, from Thought, and therefore\neach person has some control over this process when they\nbecome aware of it.\nFWBS\nand is a simple questionnaire that is easy to score. We used it as\na general measure of well-being, using all 20 items in the\n`Friedman Well-Being Composite' (FWBC) and five sub-\nscales: emotional stability (FES); self-esteem/self-confidence\nFigure 1. Study design and sample numbers.\n4 SAGE Open\n(FSES); joviality (FJOV); sociability (FSOC); and happiness\n(FHAPP) all using the raw to standard score conversion table.\nThe FWBS was used in two previous PBM studies (Department\nParticipants completed the FWBS either in school time in a\nseparate classroom (pupils) or at the intervention location\n(staff). In this study, the FWBC had good internal reliability\nwith Cronbach's alpha values of .83 (pre), .87 (post), and .91\n(follow-up) for the combined sample.\nData Analysis\nThis study looked at related samples comparisons, from the\npre, post, and follow-up FWBS data using paired sample t\ntests and repeated measures ANOVA, separately for staff and\npupils. Statistical significance is set at p < .05, two-tailed\ntests. Effect sizes were estimated by Cohen's d for the paired\nchange statistics followed Jacobsen and Truax (1991) with\ntest\u00adretest information from Friedman (1994). The semis-\ntructured interviews were transcribed and coded using Max\nQDA 2 software, and the transcripts were evaluated using\nThematic Analysis.\nResults\nThe FWBS results are presented in two parts below, the first\n(Table 1 and Figure 2) is the FWBC scores for staff and\npupils, and Table 2 presents the FWBS subscale results for\nstaff and pupils.\nFigure 2 shows a dot plot of the pre and post FWBC\nscores for staff and pupils along with lines of no change\n(solid) and lines of reliable change (dotted). For staff, post\nscores are more dispersed and three staff recorded lower\nscores than their pretest--one of which exceeded the reliable\nchange indicator. Three staff recorded increased FWBC\nscores that exceeded the reliable change indicator. All pupils\nincreased their FWBC post scores but only two increases\nexceeded the reliable change indicator.\nIn Table 1, for staff, there is an increase in FWBC scores\nat post and follow-up compared to pre. These changes are not\nstatistically significant but the effect sizes (d = 0.724 and\n0.787, respectively) are medium sized. The repeated mea-\nsures ANOVA resulted in a nonsignificant result, F(2, 18) =\nthe paired t tests and an overall small effect size.\nFor pupils, the pre to post increase is statistically signifi-\ncant and the effect size (d = 1.448) is large. This group's\nscores decreased from post to follow-up resulting in the dif-\nference from pre being nonsignificant but still with a moder-\nate sized effect (d = 0.699). The repeated measures ANOVA\nresulted in a significant difference across the three time\ning the results of the paired t tests and an overall moderate\neffect size.\nFor the FWBS subscales (Table 2), staff showed only one\nstatistically significant change from pre to follow-up on the\nJoviality (FJOV) subscale. Pupils showed statistically signifi-\ncant increases from pre to post on three of the five subscales, the\nTable 1.

However, only the Emotional Stability (FES)\nsubscale managed to remain significantly different at follow-up\n(compared to pre). In the repeated measuresANOVAtests, none\nof the subscales were statistically significant for the Staff group.\nFor pupils, two of the subscales had statistically significant\nrepeated ANOVA results: Emotional stability (FES): F(2, 16) =\nThematic Analysis\nSemistructured interviews were carried out with six mem-\nbers of staff and one pupil using an interview guide (Table\n3). These interviews were conducted to attempt rapproche-\nment (Bryman, 2001) and enhance the findings of the quanti-\ntative data analysis, thus creating the opportunity to elucidate\nsome of the personal experiences that participants had gone\nthrough in light of the training. The transcribed data from the\ninterviews were open coded into ten main codes: (1)\nExpectations and motives; (2) Personal changes; (3) Well-\nbeing; (4) Simplicity; (5) What other people think; (6)\nEffecting others; (7) Reduced stress; (8) Changes in others;\n(9) Increased awareness; and (10) Potential of the Principles.\nOut of these 10 codes, three main themes emerged that of\n(A) Expectations and motives; (B) Personal changes; and (C)\nReduced stress. With the remaining coded segments being\neither collapsed into subthemes to the main coded texts, or\nbeing dropped. Exploring these themes using extracts taken\nfrom the transcripts, it was possible to create a picture of\nchange of the individuals.\nTheme A: Expectations and Motives\nMost staff participants attended simply out of general curiosity\nor interest and thought that the training would be more interac-\ntive like other training days they had attended as teachers, and\nas such some were surprised by the differences:\nI was a bit nervous about that cause (you know) I didn't\nknow what you'd expect us to do, I didn't know whether\nwe'd have to (you know) enter role-play type activities, or\nsit around in groups and bare ourselves to each other.\n(Interview 3)\nTable 2.

Semistructured Interview Guide.\n1 General introduction\n2 Did you have a motive to take part in the research or was\nit simply general interest? (In other words, were you\nhoping to achieve a personal outcome by attending?)\n3 Was the training what you expected? If not, could you say\nwhat you thought it would be like?\n4 How would you have described yourself before the\ntraining: Personally, socially, at work?\n5 What did you think about well-being and self-esteem\nbefore the training, in connection with personal\nrelationships and life?\n6 How would you say you felt about well-being and self-\nesteem before the training in connection with work\nrelationships?\n7 Have you noticed anything different in other people that\nare around you since the training: at home or at work?\nFor example, the way in which people deal or cope with\npotentially stressful situations; how they feel or talk about\nthemselves.\n8 Since the training, do you feel any changes have taken place\nin the way you feel about your work and life?\n9 If you have felt some changes, can you say how you feel\nnow, and mention any stories that may illustrate changes\nthat have taken place?\n10 What is the most important thing (for you personally and\nalso in the context of your work) that you took away\nfrom the training?\n11 Do you feel the training has potential to help people in\ngeneral, in the way they feel about themselves and cope\nwith life; at home and at work? For example, pupils or\nteachers at school.\n12 Is there anything else you would like to add to what you\nhave said so far?\n13 Thanks and conclusion.\n6 SAGE Open\nThose who had a motive to take part other than simply\ngeneral interest seemed to have had an experience born out\nof a more open mind, and as such potentially gained more\nfrom the experience. At least two of the teachers who volun-\nteered had definite reasons for attending, one explained,\nI went on the course to find out if I could do a high-pressured\njob, be a Mum to very young children and not feel so stressed\nafter being so ill. (Interview 6)\nA second disclosed,\nNo, I did have a motive, I think after losing [her husband] and\ngoing through bereavement I was on tranquillizers, and all sorts,\nso I wanted to kind of find something to help me. (Interview 1)\nTheme B: Personal Changes\nThe changes that some staff expressed during the interviews\nappeared to be a reflection of a personal knowing. As if they\nintuitively recognized that their life as a teacher, and its effect\nupon the pupils could open up in a calmer way and that the\ntraining had led to an increased awareness to this fact:\nI have noticed, well, I've been more aware, I've become\nincreasingly aware of the children at school, of how they are\naffected, you know, about what's going on . . . I know all of this,\nof course I know, I've always known this, but I'm more sensitive\nto it. (Interview 4)\nAnother participant pointed out that although it was not\nthe results they might have hoped for it was still a step for-\nward. They put it this way,\nDefinitely, not [an] earth moving, life changing, earth shattering\nmoment. But little things that have made my work and my life\nbetter--not all the time, because I forget sometimes, but in certain\nsituations definitely things have been a lot better. (Interview 2)\nSome staff spoke of the ways in which they were respond-\ning to conditions at school or home and how it had become\nmarkedly different. One participant spoke of having been in\na cycle of being stressed at work, invariably feeling tired,\ngoing home, staying up late, not wanting to go to bed, watch-\ning television, and having no desire to \"think about any-\nthing.\" Followed by,\nDefinitely, I mean at work now, I don't get tired when I go home,\nI've got more motivation, I've got more patience with all the\npupils and students, and I've seen a difference there, I'm not so\nsharp or quick to jump on them. And that's been really good . . .\nso yeah, I do feel a lot better. And not so tired, you know I still\ngo to bed late, but I'm rested (more restful sleep). (Interview 1)\nSeveral staff members explained how they had witnessed\nsometimes subtle and occasionally more obvious transfor-\nmations in themselves:\nI feel calmer, I don't disrupt the school and it's just a little bit\nmore a professional and easier way to work, somehow. That's a\nkind of big change for me . . . really, cause I used to be quite\nfamous for going off on one, and then coming down straight\naway, cause it's all just an act, but that was maybe not a very\ngood act to have in a way. (Interview 2)\nThis sense of feeling calmer at school was a revelation to\nsome staff as it was assumed by most that teaching by its\nvery nature must be stressful. The distinction between pres-\nsure (objective tangible workloads) and stress (as being cre-\nated by our personal thinking about the pressure) was\nexplored during the interviews. There appeared to be a great\ndeal of objective pressure on the teachers with considerable\nother duties and obligations outside of classroom teaching\nThe pupil who volunteered to be interviewed seemed cer-\ntain of the changes that had taken place for them, and spoke\nwith great clarity of their transformations, enumerating them:\nWell, I used to get angry really easily, like just little things would\nmake me really, really angry, and errrm . . . I had a really, really\nshort attention span, and . . . just . . . Like--I was quite sociable\nbut, you know, like in a different kind of way--I would see\npeople but not try and meet new people, but now, it's just all\ndifferent really, all three things have changed . . . Because I've\nlearnt how to (like) interact more and, (don't know) just, what\nother people think, because people have the same feelings as me\nand so, I can . . . just realize that (approach), easier really.\n(Interview 7)\nTheme C: Reduced Stress\nIn many of the interviews, staff pointed toward a reduction in\ntheir levels of stress. One explained,\nI think with work I really noticed it last week, when we were\nbeing [Ofsted] inspected, . . . everyone, all the staff were\ngetting stressed, . . . and I must admit I had no stress at all. I\nstayed up the night before, done my lesson plans, but not\nstressful, put them on the pen [drive] . . . I know what I'm\ngoing to teach. And I just went in, and so it didn't stress me at\nall. But I did see quite a lot of teachers really stressed, and even\nthe two days after [people] were going off sick and you could\nsee the stress that they had. And I had none of that which was\nlovely. (Interview 1)\nOne member of staff explained how they had the iniqui-\ntous task of dealing with pupils for discipline reasons. Often\nthese pupils would be very rude and challenging, arriving in\na state of great disharmony, but this teacher found that feel-\ning calmer had made the whole process easier for all involved.\nThey describe how the pupils\n. . . just come and [I] do the paperwork and move on, next one.\nI've been doing that really since the course [PBM]. Now, I could\ndo it before, but I find I'm much more methodical in my calm\nRees-Evans and Pevalin 7\napproach to those sort of situations now, because it's better for\neverybody. (Interview 2)\nThe same teacher continued to explain their previous stress\nand its perceived personal negative effect upon the school,\nprior to the training:\nI must have destroyed whole lessons as I'm shouting and yelling\nin the corridor--cause it interferes with everybody's learning--\ndoesn't do any good, might have made me feel better in the\nshort-term, but . . . still have a little go at home at the kids\nsometimes, but I've got better at that as well, cause that was one\nof my main aims, wasn't it, that I wouldn't take the pressure\nfrom work home and take it out on the kids. (Interview 2)\nThis sense of finding a more relaxed way of working\nwithin familiar circumstances seems to point toward the\nPBM theory that each individual has within them what is\ntermed \"innate health\"; that it is a return to a neutral and\nnatural state that takes place from an understanding of the\nThree Principles, not learning new coping strategies. One\nparticipant talked of a shift in their thinking had and that they\nhad come to realize that the content of their thinking about\ncircumstances is what drives stress home or, conversely,\naway:\nYeah, but I think a lot more about it since that course [PBM],\nabout the fact that thought is just a thought. (Interview 3)\nThe subject of \"Thought\" and it being the cause of stress\nled to much discussion during the training, and the distinc-\ntion between the content of our everyday thinking, and\n\"Thought\" as a guiding principle was suggested as a reason\nfor these differences. Participants were not always com-\npletely comfortable or relaxed during the training, as one\nrecalls,\nI think people are innately suspicious of anything which is [or]\ncould be branded as alternative. And also people are very\nsuspicious of anything that involves them doing something\nrather than them thinking through things, people are quite\nuncomfortable, that was one of my observations, people are\nquite uncomfortable doing what they perceive as nothing. Again\nthat's part of our conditioning, we're used to being force-fed fast\ndances. (Interview 2)\nDiscussion\nThe aim of this study was to test the efficacy of the PBM as\na way of increasing the psychological well-being of staff and\npupils in a school. The total pre to post scores demonstrated\nan increase in psychological well-being for both staff and\npupils and with moderate to large effect sizes, but with only\nthe pupil group being statistically significant. Reliable\nchange analysis indicates that two pupils and three staff\nmembers' change in FWBC score was marked--although\none staff member did decline in excess of the reliable change\nindicator. This tentatively suggests that PBM has a positive\neffect on pupils' well-being. Post to follow-up scores for\nboth groups showed no significant change.\nThe primary limitation of this pilot study was the short-\nness of its length for both the intervention and the follow-up\nperiod. Future research would benefit enormously if it was\ncarried out over a longer period of time. Another limitation\nwas the lack of a control group. The single group design\nallowed us to investigate the possible impact of the PBM on\nthe staff and pupils at this school but without a control group,\nwe do not know if the changes may have occurred without\nthe intervention. Furthermore, the small numbers of staff and\npupils and the self-selecting nature of the sample make gen-\neralization unreasonable but the exploratory nature of this\npilot study is primarily designed to inform and/or generate\nfurther research.\nResearch has shown how the psychological and emotional\nstate of a child dictates their ability to learn, because it is\nemotions that sit behind motivation and the drive to access\neducation. Additionally, it has been suggested that education\nhas not fully taken up the responsibility of addressing the\nconnection between stimulating positive emotions in the\nclassroom and psychological well-being of staff and pupils\nworking together (Sylwester, 1994). This study shows the\npossibility for some pupils to increase their level of psycho-\nlogical well-being and thus to potentially recover the incen-\ntive to engage in education more positively.\nOne of the features of this study was the focus on the\nhealth of the individuals during the intervention as opposed\nto attempting to trouble shoot or offer solutions for existing\nproblems that the school or individuals might be dealing\nwith. Borg (2002) suggested in his community renewal study\nthat illness, as it appears in a community in general, is not\njust organic in nature but also social, and where there is a\nsocial element to suffering, the solution lies in the commu-\nnity understanding each other at a deeper level, and then the\nsolution arises quite naturally from within the community,\nalong with the Modello Community renewal project\nThe qualitative interviews show how individuals, once\nthey begin to become more aware of their own innate health\nbegin to see it in others and thus treat peers and pupils with\nmore respect and care and ultimately become more effective\nand productive in what they do. This, as one participant\nnoted, can only be better for the school as a whole.\nIt is important to note that understanding the power of\nThought is not the same as simply thinking positively.\nUnderstanding how thought works aids the development of a\ndeeper awareness of the power behind thought itself. Put\nanother way, recognizing that all thought is neutral until it is\ngiven life by the thinker and the direction and focus that peo-\nple as individuals choose to orient themselves.\nOne final note about the PBM in general and its applica-\ntion is that the PBM has been applied in many different\n8 SAGE Open\nsettings, including community and education applications. It\nwould seem from the evidence available that once individu-\nals begin to see how the Principles operate in their lives, this\nprocess has the potential to shift their perspective away from\nfocusing on the things they do not want in their lives and\ntoward the things they do want, that is, happier states of\nbeing. It would seem that developing a deeper awareness of\nfeeling states helps individuals to understand that a mood\nshift down into a lower state of consciousness is not some-\nthing to become worried about or even something that neces-\nsarily requires any action, although it may. Once individuals\nbegin to understand the source of mood changes their lives\nhave the potential to change positively.\nThis study provides some evidence to suggest that where\nsocial, psychological, and emotional improvements are being\nsought in education, the PBM may be a useful tool for schools\nto utilize in creating greater levels of psychological well-\nbeing and a reduction in stress, with a corresponding increase\nin calmness and stability, thus creating a more harmonious\nplace of work for adults to work, and children to learn in.\nHowever, a limitation (and possible benefit) of the PBM is\nthat it is partially \"reactive\" to the group dynamic and cannot\nbe designed into a protocol. The lack of flexibility in deliver-\ning CBT-based interventions has been previously commented\non (Taylor et al., 2014) and the flexibility of the PBM, in the\nhands of trained facilitator, may be one of its benefits.\nThe findings of this study tentatively suggest the potential\nfor staff to work in a more relaxed and resilient way, recon-\nnecting with a more common sense and intuitive approach to\ntheir relationships with peers, senior management, and the\npupils with which they work. As the PBM uses a nontech-\nnique-based approach, it is potentially easier for staff to con-\nnect with an understanding of the Three Principles, as having\nmeaning for them in their lives, rather than having to rely on\ntechniques from the outside, something which often requires\nmemorization and application. Using the PBM uncovers\nresilience within themselves.\nThe conclusions taken from this study are important as\nthey show some promising possibilities for further research,\nand correspond with the hypotheses that an exposure to the\nPBM does indeed lead to a greater experience and level of\nwell-being for people. They add to the growing body of stud-\nies that are exploring an understanding of the human experi-\nence and of resilience and positive psychological health.\nThis study is in line with previous research projects carried\nout within similar settings and offers great potential hope to\nthe ever-increasing problems within the education system.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAnnan, M., & Moore, S.
