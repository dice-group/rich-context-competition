    "abstract": "Abstract:\nFollowing Diamond (1997) and Fecht (2004) we use a model in which nancial market\naccess of households restrains the eciency of the liquidity insurance that banks' deposit\ncontracts provide to households that are subject to idiosyncratic liquidity shocks. But in\ncontrast to these approaches we assume spacial monopolistic competition among banks.\nSince monopoly rents are assumed to bring about ineciencies, improved nancial market\naccess that limits monopoly rents also entails a positive eect. But this benecial eect\nis only relevant if competition among banks does not suciently restrain monopoly rents\nalready.\nThus our results suggest that in the bank-dominated nancial system of Germany,\nin which banks intensely compete for households' deposits, improved nancial market\naccess might reduce welfare because it only reduces risk sharing. In contrast, in the\nbanking system of the U.S., with less competition for households' deposits, a high level\nof households' nancial market participation might be benecial.\n",

Corporate stocks and\ncorporate bonds but also investment fund shares still play a minor role in the portfolio of\nGerman households.\nWithin a theoretical model the present paper tries to evaluate the welfare implications\nof having an intense competition between banks for households funds instead of having a\nstrong competition between bank products and more nancial market related investments.\nIn general, competition within the nancial sector is benecial because this limits banks'\nmonopoly power and thereby reduces the ineciencies associated with this monopoly\npower. However, depending on the specic type of competition within the nancial sector\ncompetition might also incur some welfare costs. In particular, competition between\nbank deposits and market related investments reduces the liquidity insurance that can be\nprovided by deposit contracts.\nIn general, bank deposits oer an insurance against idiosyncratic liquidity risks: they\npay a comparably high return if funds are needed after a short period, but pay less than\nalternative long-term investments if held for a longer period. Thus deposits implement a\nredistribution of funds from those agents that do not have an immediate liquidity need to\nthose that cannot postpone their consumption. However, if there is strong competition\nbetween bank deposits and market related assets then those households that do not have\nan immediate liquidity need can eciently withdraw from this redistribution scheme and\ninvest into alternative long-term assets. Thus the more ecient the access to market-\nrelated investments the less risk-sharing can be provided by bank deposits. Consequently,\nin a nancial system in which banks' market power in the deposit business is limited\nby the competition with market related investments, an increasing competition reduces\nbanks' market power but comes at the costs of less ecient risk-sharing.\nIn contrast, competition between banks does not entail this negative welfare eect.\nA more intense competition for deposits between banks does not reduce the eciency\nof the liquidity insurance provided by banks' deposit contracts. The deposit contract of\nall banks entails the same optimal degree of liquidity transformation. Therefore it does\nnot oer a benecial exit option for those households that do not have an immediate\n1See, for instance, the IMF's report \"Germany's Three-Pillar Banking System: Cross-Country Per-\nspectives in Europe\".\nconsumption need.\nThus according to our analysis a reduction in banks' monopoly rents due to an increase\nin competition from other banks leads to greater welfare than a comparable reduction in\nmonopoly rents due to an increase in competition from the nancial market. Indeed, while\nkeeping banks' monopoly rents and the associated ineciencies at a low level is associated\nwith some welfare costs in a nancial system characterized by strong competition between\nbanks and market-related investments, this is not necessarily the case in a nancial system\ncharacterized by a strong competition between banks.\nOur analysis also suggests that households' improved access to market related invest-\nments in recent decades could have been welfare reducing in Germany whereas it might\nhave been welfare increasing in those nancial systems characterized by a historically\nstrong competition between banks and market related investments like, for instance, the\nUS. In the US nancial system the improved nancial market access might have further\nreduced the degree of liquidity insurance oered by banks' deposit contracts. However,\nthe increased competition between bank deposits and market related investments would\nhave also entailed a positive welfare eect, because it reduced banks' monopoly rents.\nIn Germany, monopoly rents were already suciently limited by the strong competition\nbetween banks. Hence, according to our model, here the increased competition between\nbanks and market related investments would have only limited the liquidity insurance\nprovided by deposit contracts.\nNicht technische Zusammenfassung\nZahlreiche aktuelle Studien f\u00fchren die anhaltende Ertragsschw\u00e4che deutscher Banken ins-\nbesondere auf den intensiven Wettbewerb im Privatkundengesch\u00e4ft zur\u00fcck.\nIm interna-\ntionalen Vergleich, zum Beispiel mit den USA, ist dagegen der Wettbewerb in Deutschland\nzwischen Bankeinlagen und alternativen, st\u00e4rker kapitalmarktorientierten Anlageproduk-\nten relativ moderat. So machen Aktien und Unternehmensanleihen, aber auch Invest-\nmentfondsanteile nach wie vor einen vergleichsweise geringen Teil des Portfolios privater\nHaushalte aus.\nIm Rahmen eines theoretischen Modells vergleicht das vorliegende Papier die Wohl-\nfahrtsimplikationen eines Finanzsystems, das wie das deutsche durch intensiven Wett-\nbewerb zwischen Banken gepr\u00e4gt ist, mit denen eines Finanzsystems, das wie das US-\namerikanische eher durch einen intensiven Wettbewerb zwischen Banken und anderen An-\nlageformen charakterisiert ist. Allgemein ist ein hoher Wettbewerbsgrad im Finanzsektor\nwichtig, um die Monopolmacht und die hieraus resultierenden Inezienzen zu begrenzen.\nAllerdings kann der Wettbewerb im Finanzsektor auch mit Kosten, d.h. Wohlfahrtsein-\nbu\u00ffen, verbunden sein. So f\u00fchrt der Wettbewerb zwischen Bankeinlagen und kapitalmarkt-\norientierten Anlageformen beispielsweise zu einer Verminderung der Liquidit\u00e4tsversiche-\nrung, die durch Bankeinlagen bereitgestellt werden kann.\nGenerell bieten Bankeinlagen Haushalten eine Liquidit\u00e4tsversicherung gegen idiosyn-\nkratische Liquidit\u00e4tsschocks. Der Ertrag von Bankeinlagen ist vergleichsweise hoch, wenn\ndie Einlagen bereits nach kurzer Zeit aufgel\u00f6st werden m\u00fcssen. Dagegen bieten Bankein-\nlagen, wenn sie l\u00e4ngerfristig gehalten werden, oft eine geringere Verzinsung als langfristige\nKapitalmarktanlagen. Insofern implementieren Einlagenvertr\u00e4ge eine implizite Umvertei-\nlung von solchen Einlegern, die keinen unmittelbaren Liquidit\u00e4tsbedarf haben und daher\nihre Einlagen langfristig halten, hin zu solchen Einlegern, die ihre Liquidit\u00e4t fr\u00fchzeitig\nzur\u00fcck ben\u00f6tigen. Der Grad der Liquidit\u00e4tsversicherung, der durch den Einlagenver-\ntrag erm\u00f6glicht werden kann, h\u00e4ngt allerdings vom Zugang zu alternativen Investitions-\nm\u00f6glichkeiten ab. K\u00f6nnen Haushalte sehr ezient in alternative langfristige Anlagen\ninvestierenbesteht also ein intensiver Wettbewerb zwischen Bankeinlagen und kapital-\nmarktorientierten Anlageformenso k\u00f6nnen sich solche Einleger, die keinen unmittelbaren\nLiquidit\u00e4tsbedarf haben, eektiv dem Umverteilungsmechanismus entziehen, indem sie\nihre Einlagen abziehen und in alternative Anlagen investieren. Dementsprechend nimmt\ndie durch den Einlagenvertrag erm\u00f6glichte Liquidit\u00e4tsversicherung ab, wenn der Wettbe-\nwerb zwischen Bankeinlagen und alternativen kapitalmarktorientierten Anlagen steigt.\n2Siehe zum Beispiel die IWF-Studie \"Germany's Three-Pillar Banking System: Cross-Country Per-\nspectives in Europe\".\nIn einem Finanzsystem, in dem die Marktmacht der Banken im Einlagengesch\u00e4ft\ndurch den Wettbewerb mit alternativen Investitionsformen begrenzt wird, ist eine Re-\nduktion der Marktmacht durch eine Intensivierung dieses Wettbewerbs mit den Kosten\neiner verringerten Liquidit\u00e4tsversicherung in der \u00d6konomie verbunden. Im Gegensatz\ndazu f\u00fchrt der Wettbewerb zwischen Banken nicht zu derartigen negativen Wohlfahrtsef-\nfekten. Ein intensiverer Wettbewerb zwischen Banken reduziert nicht die Ezienz der\nLiquidit\u00e4tsversicherung des Einlagenvertrags. Da der Einlagenvertrag aller Banken den\ngleichen optimalen Grad an Liquidit\u00e4tsversicherung impliziert, erm\u00f6glicht ein intensiverer\nWettbewerb zwischen Banken nicht, dass sich Haushalte ohne unmittelbaren Liquidit\u00e4ts-\nbedarf ezienter dem Umverteilungsmechanismus der Liquidit\u00e4tsversicherung entziehen\nk\u00f6nnen.\nDie vorliegende Studie deutet demnach daraufhin, dass eine Reduktion der Monopol-\nrenten von Banken durch einen intensivierten Wettbewerb zwischen Banken zu einer\nh\u00f6heren Wohlfahrt f\u00fchrt als eine Begrenzung der Monopolrenten durch einen verst\u00e4rkten\nWettbewerb von alternativen marktorientierten Anlageformen. W\u00e4hrend die Begrenzung\nder Monopolrenten und der damit verbundenen Inezienzen demnach in einem Finanzsys-\ntem, das durch einen starken Wettbewerb zwischen Banken und alternativen Investitionen\ngepr\u00e4gt ist, mit Wohlfahrtseinbu\u00ffen verbunden ist, gilt dies nicht unbedingt f\u00fcr ein Fi-\nnanzsystem wie dem deutschen, in dem der Wettbewerb im Finanzsektor vor allem durch\nden Wettbewerb zwischen Banken gepr\u00e4gt ist.\nDar\u00fcber hinaus zeigt die Analyse, dass der verbesserte Zugang von privaten Haushal-\nten zu kapitalmarktorientierten Anlageformen in Deutschland negative Wohlfahrtseekte\nmit sich gebracht haben d\u00fcrfte. In einem Finanzsystem, wie dem US-amerikanischen, das\nbereits historisch besonders von einem intensiven Wettbewerb von Banken und alterna-\ntiven Anlageformen gepr\u00e4gt war, k\u00f6nnte diese Entwicklung dagegen durchaus auch posi-\ntive Wohlfahrtsimplikationen gehabt haben. Im US-amerikanischen Finanzsystem d\u00fcrfte\nder verbesserte Finanzmarktzugang privater Haushalte zwar einerseits die Liquidit\u00e4tsver-\nsicherung der Einlagenvertr\u00e4ge reduziert haben. Anderseits hat aber der verst\u00e4rkte Wett-\nbewerb mit marktorientierten Anlageformen zu einer Verringerung der Monopolmacht\nder Banken und der hieraus erwachsenden Inezienzen gef\u00fchrt. In Deutschland dage-\ngen waren die Monopolrenten bereits stark durch den Wettbewerb zwischen Banken re-\nstringiert. Eine zus\u00e4tzliche Versch\u00e4rfung des Wettbewerbs durch den verbesserten Finanz-\nmarktzugang vermindert hier mithin nur die Liquidit\u00e4tsversicherung, die durch Bankein-\nlagen bereitgestellt werden kann.\nContents\n3 Monopolistic banking system 6\n3.1 The prot maximizing deposit contract . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\n3.2 Equilibrium monopoly rent and households' wealth . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n3.3 Households' welfare and the optimal  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\n4 Monopolistically competitive banking system 13\n4.1 The non-local deposit contract . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14\n4.2 The local deposit contract . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15\n4.3 Equilibrium monopoly rent and households' wealth . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\n4.4 Households' welfare and the eect of  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\n5 The globally optimal nancial market access 18\nBanks, markets, and eciency\n1 Introduction\nIn the discussion about dierences between nancial systems Germany is usually viewed as\nthe most prominent example of a system in which banks play the central role in channelling\nfunds from households to investing rms. Banks typically collect funds issuing sight, time,\nand saving deposits and provide these funds as loans to the corporate sector. In contrast\nto more market-oriented nancial systems, direct investments in the corporate sector play\na minor role in households' portfolios. At the same time only a few corporations issue\ntradable bonds to raise funds directly over the capital market.\nHowever, in recent years the German nancial system has undergone many remarkable\nchanges. The most remarkable one has probably been in the renancing of German banks.\nWhile in 1991 a fraction of around 46% of German households' portfolio was invested in\nbank deposits (including currency), this portfolio fraction dropped to 36% in 2003 which\nis, however, still far larger than the 15% that U.S. households hold in currency and bank\ndeposits. Due to technological progress and innovation in the nancial service industry,\nhouseholds' access to nancial markets became more ecient. The privatization of large\npublic enterprizes also created a large supply of corporate claims in the nancial market.\nFinally the introduction of the euro created a more liquid nancial market for corporate\nstocks and corporate bonds making these nancial assets more attractive to households.\nThus banks compete for households' funds with direct investments and more nancial\nmarket-related intermediaries, such as money market funds, to a much larger extent today\nthan they had to at the beginning of the nineties.\nAt the same time the competition among banks for households' deposits has always\nbeen more intense in the German bank-dominated nancial system than in more market-\noriented nancial systems like those of the U.S. and UK. This is reected, for instance, in\nthe number of banking institutions which in 2003 amounted to 2,225 in Germany compared\nwith 426 in the UK.

The market share\nof direct banks that mainly oer sight deposit that pay an interest rate closely linked to\nThis high and still intensifying degree of competition among banks and the increased\ncompetition between banks on the one side and nancial markets and market-related\nnancial intermediaries on the other has eroded the protability of the German banking\nsector signicantly in recent years.\nThis paper analyzes in a theoretical model the welfare implications of these develop-\nments. We address the question of whether an increasing nancial market access of private\nhouseholds improves welfare in a nancial system in which banks compete intensely for\nprivate households' funds. We compare these implications with the welfare eects of an\nimproved nancial market access of households in a nancial system with less intense\ncompetition among banks for households' deposits. In our model, regional monopolistic\nbanks oer deposit contracts to local households. As in Diamond and Dybvig (1983) these\ndeposit contracts provide liquidity insurance to households that face uncertain intertem-\nporal consumption preferences. But similar to Diamond (1997) and Fecht (2004) the\ndegree of liquidity insurance that deposit contracts can oer is restrained by households'\nnancial market access. Liquidity insurance implies an ex post redistribution of resources\nfrom patient depositors to impatient depositors. Financial market access provides patient\ndepositors with an ex post option to withdraw from this insurance scheme. Thus an\nimprovement of households' nancial market access limits the degree of risk sharing that\nbanks' deposit contracts can provide. However, in contrast to previous approaches, in\nour model banks have local monopoly power that allows them to earn a monopoly rent.\nWe assume that these rents are associated with welfare losses. This might be viewed,\nfor instance, as a shortcut for the managerial moral hazard that arises in the relation-\nship between the equity owners of the bank and the bank management. The higher the\nmonopoly rents of banks (and the lower therefore the debt-equity ratio) the more severe\n2Data taken from European Central Bank (2004). For a more detailed analysis of measures of the\ndegree of competition in the German banking industry see Fischer and Pfeil (2004).\n3See Deutsche Bundesbank (2004) and International Monetary Fund (2003) for a more detailed dis-\ncussion.\n4See von Thadden (1999) for a detailed survey of the various approaches that allow for a coexistence\nof a nancial market and a deposit taking bank that provides liquidity insurance.\nbecomes this moral hazard problem and the higher the associated ineciencies.\nSince an\nimproved nancial market access of households reduces the monopoly rent it also limits\nmanagerial moral hazard at banks. Consequently, a trade-o emerges: households' im-\nproved nancial market access reduces risk-sharing in the economy but at the same time\nlimits the eciency losses resulting from banks' monopoly rents. We derive the optimal\ndegree of nancial market access that optimizes this trade-o.\nHowever, the results change if the monopoly power of regional banks is also limited\nby households' option to deposit their funds at a cost with a bank from another region.\nAs soon as the monopoly rent of local banks is suciently restrained by the competition\nbetween banks, the welfare improving eect of increased nancial market access becomes\nobsolete. In that case improved nancial market access only limits the degree of risk-\nsharing oered by banks' deposit contracts.\nThus our results suggest that a more ecient nancial market access of households\nmight improve welfare in a nancial system that is characterized by an insucient com-\npetition for deposits among banks. In contracts, in a nancial system with a strong com-\npetition for households' deposits among banks, more ecient nancial market access only\nreduces welfare by restraining the available risk-sharing in the economy. Consequently,\nwhile in the U.S. and the UK, which are characterized by a less competitive banking\nsectors, a high level of households participation in the nancial market may be benecial,\nhouseholds' improved nancial market access in Germany, which is characterized by a\nstrong competition for deposits among banks, might be welfare reducing.\nApart from Diamond (1997) there are only very few papers that analyze the inter-\nplay between competition in the nancial sector for households' funds and the liquidity\ninsurance provided by banks' deposit contracts. Von Thadden (1997) introduces in the\nDiamond and Dybvig (1983) framework an additional long-term asset that has a dierent\nterm structure  i.e., a dierent maturity risk. He shows that if banks' deposit contracts\ncan provide households with more insurance against maturity risk than direct investments,\nthen deposit contracts can also oer some degree of liquidity insurance even if households\nhave a perfectly ecient access to nancial markets. Extending the model to continuous\ntime von Thadden (1998) shows that if households are suciently risk averse then the\npersisting demand for maturity risk insurance enables banks to oer incentive-compatible\ndeposit contracts that provide the optimal degree of liquidity insurance even if households\ncan eciently invest directly in the nancial market. While providing a very detailed fo-\ncus on the eect of competition between banks and direct nancial market investments\non liquidity provision all these approaches assume a perfectly competitive banking sector.\nIn contrast, Carletti, Hartmann, and Spagnolo (2003) analyze the eect of bank mergers\n5See Harris and Raviv (1990) and Aghion and Bolton (1992) who model the disciplining role of debt.\non liquidity provision. They show that a bank merger (due to the economies of scale in\nliquidity provision) will increase aggregate liquidity if ex post renancing in the interbank\nmarket is expensive relative to ex ante nancing through deposits. However, in their pa-\nper changes in competition only relate to an intensifying competition in the loan market.\nThey neither analyze the aggregate liquidity eect of an increasing competition among\nbanks for deposits nor do they study the impact of an intensifying competition between\nbanks and nancial market investments on the liquidity provision. Thus in contrast to\nprevious studies our paper takes both the competition between banks and nancial mar-\nkets as well as the competition within the banking sector for deposits into account and\nanalyzes its impact on liquidity provision and ultimately welfare.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the basic set up.\nIn section 3 we rst derive the optimal nancial market access given that banks are local\nmonopolists. In section 4 we also allow for competition among bank from dierent region.\nIn section 5 we derive the optimal nancial structure for a given degree of competition\nfrom the market and from other banks. Section 6 concludes.\n2 The Model\nThe economy consists of N regions and takes place at three dates, denoted by t = 0, 1,\nand 2. Each region contains one bank and a continuum of mass 1 of households. There is\nalso a large number of entrepreneurs. Households are endowed with one unit of the only\nconsumption good in the economy at date 0. They can deposit their endowment with\nthe local bank or with a bank from another region. Households can also invest directly\nat a centralized nancial market. Each bank oers a deposit contract and maximizes its\nprots. Entrepreneurs operate a long-term technology as described below.\nThere are two technologies in this economy. The storage technology returns 1 unit\nof goods at date t, for each unit invested at t - 1, t = 1, 2. The long-term technology\nis operated by the entrepreneurs. It has a high potential return but is subject to moral\nhazard. The long-term technology returns R units of goods at date 2 for each unit invested\nat date 0, provided the entrepreneur operating the technology is monitored at date 1. If\nthe entrepreneur is not monitored, the return is only R at date 2, with R < 1. The\nlong-term technology can also be liquidated at date 1, in which case it returns r < 1.\nThis is summarized in the table below.\nStorage\nLong-term technology\nIf nished\nunmonitored -1 0  \u00b7 R\nIf liquidated -1 r 0\nBanks are able to costlessly monitor entrepreneurs at date 1. Households can also\nmonitor entrepreneurs, but only if they become sophisticated. In order to become so-\nphisticated, a household must pay a proportional utility cost denoted by .\nHouseholds\nchoose whether or not to become sophisticated at date 0, after observing the deposit\ncontracts oered by banks.\nAt date 1, households learn whether they are patient or impatient. Patient households\nonly derive utility from consuming at date 1, while impatient households only derive utility\nfrom consuming at date 2. The probability of being impatient is denoted by q. We assume\na law of large number holds so that q also denotes the fraction of impatient households\nin the economy. The expected utility of a household from consuming ct with t = 1, 2 can\nthus be written as\n) =\n) with probability q\n) with probability 1 - q\nif it remains unsophisticated. The expected utility of a sophisticated household is given\nby\n) =\n) with probability q\n) with probability 1 - q\nwhere  denotes the disutility from the eort required to become sophisticated. Similarly,\nif a households prefers to deposit the endowment with a bank from another region its\nexpected utility is discounted by \u00b5, reecting the disutility due to the additional eort\nthat has to be spend in that case. The intratemporal utility function is assumed to display\nconstant relative risk aversion: u(ct\nt , with  > 1.\n6While assuming a proportional cost simplies the exposition, we conjecture that modelling the cost\ndierently would yield qualitatively similar results. Assuming a resource cost instead of a utility cost\nyields similar results as shown in Fecht, Huang, and Martin (2004).\n7Note that because the utility function is a negative function \u00b5,  > 1. A higher number means more\ndisutility.\nBanks oer households a deposit contract. A deposit contract species the repayment\nd1 that depositors receive if they withdraw their funds in t = 1 and the repayment d2 that\nthose depositors receive that keep their deposits until date 2.\nBefore banks decide about the deposit contracts, the right to run the dierent regional\nbanks has to be allocated. There are B potential bank managers with B > N. They\ncompete for the licences to run a regional bank. The bank managers that can credibly\npromise to distribute the highest prot to the households in the economy receive a licence.\nBank managers can only realize the maximum feasible prot  if they expend some eort.\nWithout eort, the monopoly rent will only amount to  with  < 1. The actual eort\nexpended by the bank manager is not veriable and therefore cannot be required in a\ncontract. Bank managers' disutility from eort is assumed to be always higher than the\nutility from keeping a fraction (1-) of the prots. Consequently, the maximum prot of\nlocal banks that can be credibly promised to households and that will actually be realized\nis .\n3 Monopolistic banking system\nIn this section we study the problem of a monopolistic bank. We assume that the local\nbank does not compete with other banks for depositors; i.e., \u00b5 = . The local bank's\nmonopoly position is only challenged by the ability of households to invest directly in the\ncentralized nancial market.\n3.1 The prot maximizing deposit contract\nThe deposit contract {d1\n} oered by the bank maximizes prots subject to a number\nof constraints.\nFirst, the deposit contract must ensure that households prefer to deposit\ntheir funds with the bank rather than investing in the storage technology if they decide\nto stay na\u00efve. Let M denote wealth of a household at date 0, which is given by the\nhousehold's endowment as well as the value of its share of the bank's prots: M = 1+.\n8There are several other explanations why monopoly rents might lead to ineciencies and why the\nprots cannot be distributed entirely to household. For instance, we could relate this managerial moral\nhazard problem to the return on the long-term investment technology and assume that only a certain\nfraction of R would be realized if bank managers did not spend their full eort. This would probably\nbe more convincing but would complicate the analysis without qualitatively changing the result. More-\nover, there are several other explanations for the ineciencies that we assume to be associated with the\nmonopoly rent of banks and the debt-equity relation. See, for instance, Harris and Raviv (1990) and\n9As usual in this kind of model there are multiple equilibria. Our paper focuses on the good equilibrium\nand leaves the study of bank panics in this context to future research.\nThus this participation constraint, denoted by (PCN\n), is given by\n)  u (M) . (3)\nIn addition, the optimal deposit contract must also provide an incentive for households\nnot to become sophisticated and invest directly at the nancial market. The arbitrage-free\nprice in the centralized nancial market in t = 1 of a claim against the corporate sector\nthat pays R in t = 2 is always 1.\nConsequently, the constraint that households remain\nna\u00efve, denoted by (PCS\n), can be written as\n)  qu (M) +  (1 - q) u (RM) . (4)\nNote that, in principle, sophisticated households could also deposit their wealth in the\nbank at date 0, withdraw at date 1, and invest d1 in the nancial market if they turn out\nto be patient. Sophisticated households would choose this option if\nqu (M) +  (1 - q) u (RM) < qu (d1\nwhich obviously only holds if d1\n> M. As shown in the Appendix, the monopolistic\ndeposit contract always satises d1\n M, so (PCS\n) is the relevant constraint.\nFor the sake of completeness, we include the incentive compatibility constraint d1\n M\nin the problem below and denote it by (ICS\n).\nThe prot maximizing deposit contract is also subject to another incentive compatibil-\nity constraints, denoted by (ICN\n), which ensures that na\u00efve households will not withdraw\nif they turn out to be patient. This is the case if d2\n d1. This constraint never binds.\nThe deposit contract oered by a monopolistic bank thus solves\n\n\n\nmax\nR\ns.t. (PCN\n), (PCS\n) , (ICN\n) , (ICS\n)\nWe denote by {dm\n; dm\n} the deposit contract that solves (P1).\nComparing (PCS\n) and (PCN\n) shows that if the cost  of becoming sophisticated is\nabove the threshold level\n\u00af\n =\n,\n11So in the present paper sophisticated households never invest in deposits that they withdraw to buy\nclaims against the corporate sector in the nancial market if they turn out to be patient. This contrast\nto the equilibrium in Fecht, Huang, and Martin (2004) results from the assumptions in the present paper\nthat banks are regional monopolists and oer their deposit contract before households decide whether to\nbecome sophisticated or not.\nhouseholds stay na\u00efve even if they plan to invest directly in either technology (see Ap-\npendix for the derivation of \u00af\n). In that case, (PCN\n) is the only binding constraint. If\n  \u00af\n, na\u00efve households do not invest in the centralized nancial market and (PCN\n) is\nnever binding. If   , \u00af\n , where  is given by\n =\nq + (1 - q) \u00b7 R(1-)/\n,\n< M and the optimal deposit contract maximizes prots subject to (PCS\n) only\n(details of the derivation of  are provided in the appendix). If the cost of becoming\nsophisticated is even lower, so that   1,  , then d1\n= M and (ICS\n) holds with\nequality.\nWe derive the deposit contract oered by the bank for each case in turn. If   [\u00af\n, )\nthe deposit contract oered by the monopolistic bank is given by\n{dm\n; dm\n} =\nM;\nM .\nThe degree of risk-sharing provided by this contract is dm\n1 . It can be shown\nthat this is the optimal degree of risk-sharing that would also be provided by a social\nplanner. Since this contract is independent of , the monopolist deposit contract is the\nsame for all   [\u00af\n, ].\nIf   \u00af\n,  , the equilibrium deposit contract is given by\n{dm\n; dm\n} =\n\nM;\n\nThe degree of risk-sharing provided by this contract is also dm\n1 . It is easy to\nsee that the degree of risk-sharing remains the same for all   \u00af\n,  . However, the level\nof the repayment on deposit contracts oered by the monopolistic bank changes with \nin that interval.\nFinally, if   1,  , the optimal deposit contract is given by\n{dm\n; dm\n} = M;\n[q + (1 - q) \u00b7 R1-] - q\n\u00b7 M .\nIndeed, the contract is determined by d1\n= M and\nq \u00b7 u(M) + (1 - q) \u00b7 u(d2\n) =  [q \u00b7 u(M) + (1 - q) \u00b7 u(R \u00b7 M)] .\nThe degree of risk-sharing oered by this contract is\n =\n[q + (1 - q) \u00b7 R1-] - q\nThus when   1,  a decrease in  not only increases the average repayments to\nhouseholds, and therefore their expected utility, but also changes the degree of liquidity\ninsurance, , provided by the deposit contract.\nWe can summarize the eect of a change in the cost of becoming a sophisticated\ninvestor in the following proposition.\nProposition 1 For  < \u00af\n a reduction in the cost of becoming a sophisticated investor\nimproves the outside option of households vis-\u00e1-vis the monopolistic bank. Therefore the\nbank increases the repayment level on deposits. However, if  <  a reduction in the\ncost of becoming sophisticated constrains the degree of risk-sharing that is provided by the\ndeposit contract.\n3.2 Equilibrium monopoly rent and households' wealth\nThe monopoly rent a bank could realize at maximum with the full eort of the bank\nmanager is given by\n = M - qd1\nR\nFor dierent values of , we can substitute the relevant value of d1 and d2 in this equation\nto obtain an expression for the maximum realizable prots.\nOnce again, we consider each case in turn. If   [\u00af\n, ) the monopoly rent is\n = M - qAM - (1 - q)AMR(1-)/, (8)\nwhere\nA =\n.\nRearranging yields\nwith details provided in the Appendix. Not surprisingly, in this interval the monopoly\nrent is independent of .\nIf   , \u00af\n the monopoly rent is given by\nwhere\nwith details provided in the Appendix. In this interval a reduction in  leads to a higher\nlevel of repayments on the deposit contract which brings about a lower monopoly rent.\nFinally, if   [1, ) the monopoly rent is given by\n[q + (1 - q)R(1-)] - q\nwith details are provided in the Appendix. In this interval also, a decrease in  increased\nthe outside option of households, forcing the bank to increase the level of repayment on\nthe deposit contract. It is thus not surprising that a decrease in  reduces the monopoly\nrent in this case as well.\nWe can state the following proposition.\nProposition 2 If  < \u00af\n, in which case becoming sophisticated and investing directly in\nthe nancial market is the relevant alternative for households, a decrease in  reduces the\nmonopoly rent of banks.\nAs noted above, the wealth of each household is given by its endowmentnormalized\nto 1and the payout of the actual prots  the bank manager realizes without expending\neort. Hence,\nFor dierent values of , inserting the relevant value of  into the above equation yields\nthe households' equilibrium wealth.\nIf  > \u00af\n the monopoly prots are given by (9). Substituting this expression into\nequation (10) yields\nM =\n.\nIf   , \u00af\n households' initial wealth is given by\nM =\n.\nObviously, given the participation of households in the prots of the banks, lower prots\ndue to lower costs of becoming sophisticated reduce the initial wealth of households.\nSimilarly, in the case where   [1, ) reducing monopoly rents lowers the households'\ninitial wealth, which is given by\nM =\n.\nWe can now state the following proposition.\nProposition 3 If  < \u00af\n, in which case becoming sophisticated and investing directly in\nthe nancial market is the relevant alternative for households, a decrease in  reduces the\ninitial wealth of households.\n3.3 Households' welfare and the optimal \nIn this section, we nd the value of , denoted by , that maximizes the expected\nutility received by households that invest in a monopolist bank. First we show that that\nClearly,  does not belong to [\u00af\n, ), since this interval provides the lowest expected\nutility for households. In this case,  is so large that becoming sophisticated in order to\ninvest directly in the nancial market is not a relevant alternative for households. Indeed,\nfor such high values of  a household invests only in the storage technology. Changes in\nthe value of  in this interval aect neither the deposit contract, nor the monopoly rent,\nnor the households' wealth.\nWhenever   , \u00af\n a reduction in  improves the outside option of households by\nincreasing the expected utility received from direct investments in the nancial market.\nTherefore, the monopolistic bank has to increase the repayment on the deposit contract,\nimproving households' expected utility. On the other hand, a higher repayment on de-\nposits squeezes the monopoly rent of banks and, thereby, reduces households' wealth. The\nrst eect always dominates so that a decrease in  increases households' expected utility.\nTo see that, note in this case the expected utility of a household is given by\nRecall M is a function of . Dierentiating with respect to  yields\nE [U]\n\nwith details provided in the Appendix. Consequently, reducing the costs of becoming\nan ecient investor is always welfare improving in that interval because it reduces the\nmonopoly rent of banks and thereby limits the ineciencies associated with these rents.\nThe most interesting case is when   1,  . In that case a second eect goes against\nthe eciency gains arising from reducing the monopoly rent. Indeed, for such low levels\nof  the liquidity insurance provided by the deposit contract worsens as  decreases,\nreducing the households' welfare. Consequently a trade-o emerges between these two\neects and the optimal value of  must balance both costs. To see this, note that the\nexpected utility of households in this case is\nE [U] = q + (1 - q) 1-\n.\nTo solve for the optimal value of , we rst nd the value of  which maximizes house-\nholds' expected utility and then back out the corresponding value of . The optimal  is\na solution to\nE [U]\n\nM\n\nThe expressions for the initial wealth of households and its derivative are given by\nM =\n,\nM\n\n= -\n.\nSubstituting for these in equation (13) and rearranging yields\n =\n1 -  +  \u00b7 q\n \u00b7 q\n\u00b7 R\nwith details provided in the Appendix. Using equation (6) it is easy to see that the\noptimal  is\n =\n(1 - q) \u00b7q\nR(1-)/ + q\nNow we can state the following proposition.\nProposition 4 Improving nancial market access of households is not necessarily welfare\nenhancing. If   [\u00af\n, ] changing  does not aect welfare. If   [1, ] a reduction\nin  strictly decreases welfare. Only in the case   [, \u00af\n] does a decrease in  increase\nwelfare. In that case, reducing the ineciencies due to the monopoly rents dominates the\ncost of reducing the risk-sharing provided by the equilibrium deposit contract.\nFigure 1 depicts the expected utility received by a household under the monopolist\ndeposit contract (the gure assumes R = 3, q = 0.3,  = 2, and  = 0.8) .\nIn the remainder of this section we provide conditions under which  is an interior\nsolution; i.e.,  >  > 1. Inserting the equilibrium expression for  and , respectively,\nand rearranging yields\n(details are provided in the Appendix).\nWhenever there are some ineciencies associated with the monopoly power of banks\n( < 1),  should be smaller than  because limiting the monopoly power at the expense\nof some liquidity insurance is welfare improving. It can be seen from expression (15) that,\nwhenever (16) holds,\n\n\nHence, the optimal value of  decreases as the ineciencies due to the monopoly rent\nincrease. However, if these ineciencies become too severe  will attain the lower bound\n = 1. This constraint binds whenever  > 1\n.\nWe can summarize these ndings in the following proposition.\nFigure 1: Households' utility in a monopolistic banking system\nFigure 1: Households' utility in a monopolistic banking system\nFigure 1 depicts the expected utility received by a household under the monop-\nolist deposit contract (the figure assumes R = 3, q = 0.3,  = 2, and  = 0.8).\nIn the remainder of this section we provide conditions under which  is an\ninterior solution; i.e.,  >  > 1. Inserting the equilibrium expression for  and\n, respectively, and rearranging yields\n(details are provided in the Appendix).\nWhenever there are some inefficiencies associated with the monopoly power of\nbanks ( < 1),  should be smaller than  because limiting the monopoly power\nat the expense of some liquidity insurance is welfare improving. It can be seen from\nexpression (15) that, whenever (16) holds,\n\n\nHence, the optimal value of  decreases as the inefficiencies due to the monopoly\nrent increase. However, if these inefficiencies become too severe  will attain the\nlower bound  = 1. This constraint binds whenever  > 1\n.\nWe can summarize these findings in the following proposition.\nProposition 5 If there are some ineciencies associated with monopoly power, the cost\nto become sophisticated should be reduced to  <  to limit these ineciencies even\nthough this reduces risk-sharing. The optimal cost of becoming sophisticated decreases as\nthe ineciencies due to the monopoly power increase.\n4 Monopolistically competitive banking system\nIn this section, we relax the assumption that \u00b5 = . If \u00b5 is suciently low, each regional\nbank must be concerned that local households might deposit their wealth in the bank of\nanother region. We assume that households can only deposit money in either bank at\nt = 0. In t = 1 households can only invest over the centralized nancial market. Thus if\nbanks want to raise funds in t = 1 they have to issue bank bonds. Just like in the case\nof bonds issued by the non-nancial corporate sector  households can only eciently\ninvest in these bank bonds if they spend the utility cost  to become sophisticated.\n12This assumption reects the argument put forward in Diamond and Rajan (2001) that a deposit\ncontract only provides a credible disciplining device of the borrower because of the threat that lenders\nwithdraw on an unexpectedly large scale if the borrower misbehaves. If a deposit contract incorporates\nno such optionbecause it is due after one period anywayit is subject to the same ineciencies as other\nnancial claims against the corporate sector.\nNote that if we would assume that banks could also raise one-period deposits in t = 1, non-local banks\ncould oer one-period deposits in t = 1 promising for each unit deposited a repayment smaller but close\nto R in t = 2. This would be benecial for non-local banks because it provides them with liquidity at a\n4.1 The non-local deposit contract\nWe assume that there is at least one bank, called the non-local bank, which does not have\nany depositors in its region. This bank will have depositors only if it can attract them from\nother regions. The contract oered by the non-local bank is the outside option against\nwhich local banksthose that do have depositors in their regionmust compete.\nBecause of competition between banks, the non-local bank oers a deposit contract\nwhich maximizes the utility of depositors, subject to some constraints. First, since it\nhas no depositors in its region, the non-local bank makes zero prots. Hence this bank's\nbudget constraint, denoted by (BC), is given by\nR\nAlso, it can be veried that the constraints (PCN\n) and (ICN\n) never bind.\nIf  > 1, the deposit contract oered by the non-local bank will provide some risk-\nsharing. This implies d1\n> M. In that case, as noted in the previous section, sophisticated\nhouseholds deposit their wealth in the bank and withdraw at date 1 whether or not they\nturn out to be impatient. Hence, the relevant constraint providing incentives for depositors\nto remain na\u00efve is (PCS\n), or\nThe equilibrium deposit contract oered by the non-local bank thus solves the following\nproblem:\n\n\n\nmax\n)\ns.t. (BC), (PCS\n).\nHence, the non-local bank oers the deposit contract\n{d\n; d\n} =\nM\n;\n \u00b7 M\n.\nThe degree of risk-sharing provided by this contract is\nd\nd\nlower cost than investing in the storage technology in t = 0. If households utility costs of switching to a\nnon-local bank in t = 1 is suciently low then they will indeed withdraw their funds from their regional\nbank and deposit them at the non-local bank. In order to prevent this, regional banks have to limit the\ndegree of risk-sharing provided by their initial deposit contract. Thus allowing to switch deposits from\nthe local to a non-local bank in t = 1 at a cost has the same eect as the secondary nancial market\naccess of households described in the previous section.\n13Alternatively, we could assume that banks can distinguish between depositors from their region and\ndepositors from other regions. The deposit contract oered to depositors from other regions would be\nthe same as the deposit contract derived in this section.\nwhere  is dened in equation (6).\nIf  > , then (PCS\n) is not binding. In that case the contract oered by the non-local\nbank is the same as the contract a planner would oer since it maximizes depositors'\nutility subject to (BC), which in this case is equivalent to a resource constraint. If  < ,\nthen the deposit contract is given by the intersection of (PCS\n) and (BC). Because\n) is binding, the contract cannot implement the socially optimal risk-sharing in this\ncase. Thus, whenever  <  the option of households to become sophisticated, withdraw\ntheir deposits in t = 1, and invest them in the secondary nancial market prevents the\nnon-local bank from oering a deposit contract that implements the ecient degree of\nrisk-sharing. Further, as immediately follows from the denition of , a lower cost of\nbecoming sophisticated reduces risk-sharing (i.e., increases ).\nAs will be shown in the next section, if \u00b5 is suciently small, so that the deposit\ncontract oered by the non-local bank constrains the contract oered by local banks,\nthen the agent's wealth, M, is independent of . Hence, a decrease in risk-sharing will\nimply a lower utility for depositors. We can now state the following proposition.\nProposition 6 The equilibrium deposit contract oered by the non-local bank is not af-\nfected by changes of  if   ,  . If   1,  then the risk-sharing provided by the\nequilibrium deposit contract decreases as  decreases.\n4.2 The local deposit contract\nWhen \u00b5 is nite, local banks must potentially take into account the competition from\nthe non-local bank. If \u00b5 is suciently high, the local bank will still be able to oer the\ncontract derived in section 3. However, if \u00b5 is low then the local bank must oer a contract\nwhich provides incentives for depositors in its region not to invest in the non-local bank.\nThis constraint, which we denote (PCC\n), can be written as\n)  \u00b5qu (d\n) + \u00b5 (1 - q) u (d\nIt is easy to see that if (PCC\n) binds then d1\n> M. Hence the local bank also faces the\nconstraint (PCS\n). The local bank thus solves the following problem.\n\n\n\nmax\nM - q \u00b7 d1\nR\ns.t. (PCC\n), (PCS\n).\nThe deposit contract solving (P3) is given by\n{dc\n; dc\n.\nNote that if both (PCC\n) and (PCS\n) bind, then the deposit contract is given by the\nintersection of these two constraints holding at equality.\nIf \u00b5 decreases, the repayment to households from the contract oered by their local\nbank obviously increases. A reduction in  does not aect the repayment on the deposit\ncontract of local banks if   ,  because in that case (PCS\n) is not binding. However,\nif   1,  a decrease in  leads to a decrease in the degree of risk-sharing, a decrease\nin d1, and an increase in d2.\nFor a given , there exists a threshold value for \u00b5 such that if \u00b5 is above that threshold\nthen the regional bank oers the monopolist deposit contract derived in section 3 and\ndenoted by {dm\n; dm\n}. However, if \u00b5 is below the threshold value, then the local bank\noers the contract {dc\n; dc\n} derived in this section. The threshold value of \u00b5, denoted by\n\u00af\n\u00b5 is the one that makes depositors indierent between the two contracts.\nIf   [1, ), then dm\n= M and dm\n= dm\ndc\nM\nand dc\n= dc\n1. It follows that U (dm\n, dm\n) = U (dc\n, dc\n) if and only if dm\n= dc\n1. This is the\ncase if\n\u00af\nUsing the same logic it can be easily veried that for any value of , U (dm\n, dm\n) =\nU (dc\n, dc\n) if and only if dm\n= dc\n1. If   , \u00af\n , this condition implies\n\u00af\n\u00b5 = \n\n\nIf  > \u00af\n, this same condition implies\n\u00af\n\n-\nWhenever  > \u00af\n, the threshold value of \u00b5 is independent of . This is not surprising\nsince neither the deposit contract {dm\n; dm\n} nor {dc\n; dc\n} depend on . When   \u00af\n, \u00af\n\u00b5\nincreases as  increases.\nThus \u00af\n\u00b5 is a weakly increasing function of the costs  of becoming a sophisticated\ninvestor. If the costs of investing eciently in the nancial markets are high then the\nnon-local banks can oer a more ecient deposit contract. Consequently, the costs of\ndepositing at a non-local bank \u00b5 must be higher to leave the deposit contract of a mo-\nnopolistic local bank unconstraint by the competition of non-local banks.\nFigure 1 shows \u00af\n\u00b5 as a function of  (this gure assumes R = 3, q = 0.3, and  = 2).\nWe can summarize our ndings in the following proposition:\nProposition 7 Whenever \u00b5 < \u00af\n\u00b5, for a given , the deposit contract oered by local banks\nis constrained by the competition with the non-local bank. In that case changes of  have\neither no eect on the deposit contract oered by the local bank (for   ,  ) or only\naect the risk-sharing oered by that contract (for   1,  ). The cuto \u00af\n\u00b5 increases\n(weakly) with .\n4.3 Equilibrium monopoly rent and households' wealth\nTo nd banks' prots when competition between local and non-local banks is a binding\nconstraint, we can substitute dc\n2 into the general prot function given by equation\n(7) and get\nThen, substituting this expression into the general equation of households' wealth given\nM =\nFrom (24) we can immediately derive the following proposition.\nProposition 8 Whenever competition among banks is binding (\u00b5 < \u00af\n\u00b5, for a given ) M\nis independent of . Changes in  do not aect the ineciencies related to the monopoly\nrent of banks.\n4.4 Households' welfare and the eect of \nInserting the households' equilibrium wealth and the optimal deposit contract oered if\n  ,  in the expected utility function yields (see Appendix for details)\nU (dc\n; dc\n) =\n.\nThis is the households' welfare in the case where competition between banks limits local\nbanks' monopoly power, but direct nancial market access does not restrain the risk-\nsharing provided by the equilibrium deposit contract. It is easy to see that in this case\na change in  does not have any welfare eect. A decrease in \u00b5, however, reduces the\nmonopoly power of local banks and thereby limits the monopoly rents and the ineciencies\nassociated with these rents. The higher these ineciencies (the lower ) the more benecial\nis a reduction in local banks' monopoly power.\nIf   1,  then the local banks' equilibrium deposit contract is not only constrained\nby competition with non-local banks. The nancial market access of households also\nrestrains the equilibrium contract in that it limits the degree of risk-sharing the contract\ncan provide. In that case households' expected utility is given by (see Appendix for\ndetails)\nU (dc\n; dc\n) = -\n.\nSince\n\n\n> 0, it is easy to see that households' expected utility decreases strictly when\nthe cost of becoming sophisticated decreases. As long as the monopoly rent is determined\nby the competition between the local and non-local banks, rather than by the competition\nbetween banks and markets, a more ecient nancial market access of households only\nlimits the risk-sharing that the deposit contract provides.\nProposition 9 Whenever for a given , \u00b5 > \u00af\n\u00b5 improving nancial market access of\nhouseholds (lowering ) is not welfare improving. In that case competition among banks\neciently restrains banks' monopoly rents. Lower costs of becoming sophisticated have\neither no eect (for   ,  ) or decrease welfare (for   1,  ), because they reduce\nthe available risk-sharing in the economy.\nFigure 2 depicts the expected utility received by a household under the monopolist\ndeposit contract, as well as the competitive deposit contract for two dierent values of\n\u00b5. (the gure assumes R = 3, q = 0.3, = 2, and  = 0.8).Graphically, an increase in \u00b5\nsimply lowers the curve showing the expected utility provided by the competitive deposit\ncontract.\n5 The globally optimal nancial market access\nIn the two previous sections we have shown that in an economy in which the banking\nsystem is not suciently competitive there is an optimal cost of nancial market access for\nhouseholds that trades o the welfare improving reduction of banks' monopoly rent versus\nthe ineciencies due to suboptimal risk-sharing. If the banking system is suciently\ncompetitive, welfare is maximized if households have no ecient access to nancial market,\nbecause in these economies the option of households to invest in the nancial market only\nlimits the risk-sharing the deposit contract oers. Ineciencies due to banks' monopoly\nrents are limited by the competition among banks and not by the nancial market access\nof households. Consequently, in these economies increasing households' costs of accessing\nthe nancial market always improved welfare. In this section we address the question\nof how intense competition between banks has to be for a competitive banking sector\nwithout ecient nancial market access of households to be preferable to a monopolistic\nbanking sector with the optimal degree of nancial market access of households.\nFigure 2: Households' utility in competitive banking systems\nFigure 2: Households' utility in competitive banking systems\nket access for households that trades off the welfare improving reduction of banks'\nmonopoly rent versus the inefficiencies due to suboptimal risk-sharing. If the bank-\ning system is sufficiently competitive, welfare is maximized if households have no effi-\ncient access to financial market, because in these economies the option of households\nto invest in the financial market only limits the risk-sharing the deposit contract\noffers. Inefficiencies due to banks' monopoly rents are limited by the competition\namong banks and not by the financial market access of households. Consequently, in\nthese economies increasing households' costs of accessing the financial market always\nimproved welfare. In this section we address the question of how intense competition\nbetween banks has to be for a competitive banking sector without efficient financial\nmarket access of households to be preferable to a monopolistic banking sector with\nthe optimal degree of financial market access of households.\nAs shown above, the highest expected utility households can obtain from a mo-\nnopolistic bank is achieved for  = . The expected utility offered by this contract\nis given by\nU (dm\n, dm\n| =  ) = q + (1 - q) ()1-\nm\n,\nAs shown above, the highest expected utility households can obtain from a monopo-\nlistic bank is achieved for  = . The expected utility oered by this contract is given\nby\nU (dm\n, dm\n| =  ) = q + (1 - q) ()1-\nm\n,\nwhere\nMm\n=\nR\nand\n =\nq\nR\n.\nWhen banks are competing with each other, the highest expected utility households\ncan obtain from their local bank, given \u00b5, is achieved for   . The expected utility\noered by this contract is\nU dc\n; dc\n =  =\n.\nThe threshold \u00b5 below which households are better o in a competitive banking system\nwithout nancial market access than in a system with monopolistic banks and an optimal\ndegree of nancial market access therefore follows from\nU dc\n; dc\n =  = U (dm\n, dm\n| =  )\nand is given by\n\u00b5 =\n-\n\n.\nThus we can state the following proposition.\nProposition 10 If the costs of switching to non-local banks are suciently small (\u00b5 <\n\u00b5, \u00b5) in the competitive banking system, then the competitive banking system without e-\ncient nancial market access (  ) of households is more ecient than a monopolistic\nbanking system (\u00b5 > \u00b5) with the optimal costs of accessing the nancial market ( = ).\n6 Conclusion\nIn the paper we study the deposit contract oered by banks when they face competition\nfrom a nancial market and from other banks. When competition from other banks is too\nweak, promoting competition from the nancial market can be welfare improving. Com-\npetition reduces the monopoly rents that banks can extract and limits the ineciencies\nassociated with these rents. However, competition from the nancial market at the same\ntime restrains the risk-sharing oered by banks. Hence, there is a point after which more\ncompetition from the market will decrease depositors' welfare. When competition from\nother banks is strong enough, competition from the nancial market is no longer neces-\nsary to reduce monopoly rents. In that case, the competition among banks limits banks'\nmonopoly rents. The only eect of increased competition between banks and the nancial\nmarket is to reduce risk-sharing. Thus our results suggest that even though greater access\nto nancial markets might be preferable if competition between banks is not suciently\nstrong, if banks compete with each other intensely enough, increased competition from a\nnancial market might be welfare reducing.\nWe can also show that if in a particular nancial system the competition among banks\nis higher than a threshold level (and the banks' monopoly rents are therefore suciently\nreduced) but households cannot eciently invest at the nancial market then this nancial\nsystem is preferable to a nancial system with weak competition among banks but an\necient access of households to the nancial market.\nWe conclude that while in the U.S. and the UK nancial systems with a less competi-\ntive banking sector the increased participation of private households in nancial markets\nmight have been preferable, these developments are likely to be welfare reducing in Ger-\nmany where competition between banks seems to be more intense. The still increasing\nlevel of competition within the German banking industry makes this conclusion even more\nrelevant.\nOne limitation of our model is that, by assumption, competition among banks does not\naect the ability of banks to attract depositors from other banks in the interim period.\nThis is why changes to the degree of competition between banks do not restrain the\nrisk-sharing provided by the banks. However, allowing for such an eect of competition\nbetween banks does not change the results for reasonable parameter settings. It would\nonly provide a reason why, in this context, the maximum degree of competition between\nbanks is not necessarily optimal. We leave the study of this eect in our framework for\nfurther research.\nObviously, another interesting dimension to extend this framework is to analyze the\nimplications of changes in competition between banks and between banks and markets\non the stability of the nancial system. Following Fecht (2004) it would be interesting to\nstudy the eect of a collapse of one bank on the overall nancial system and the likelihood\nof contagion of other institutions in the economy. Similar to Fecht (2004) an improved\naccess of households to nancial markets would, on the one hand, reduce the negative\nimpact of re-sales of troubled banks. On the other hand, banks are more sensitive to\nchanges in the price of claims against the corporate sector if households become more\necient in investing directly at the nancial market. But in addition to Fecht (2004) in\nour framework the eect of changes in competition between banks and nancial markets\non banks' monopoly rents is taken into account. Since banks' monopoly rents serve as a\nbuer in crisis periods this eect would add an interesting additional dimension.\nAppendix\nProof that the monopolistic contract always satises d1\n M:\nTo show that it is never optimal for a bank to oer a deposit contract with d1\n> M, note\nthat in such a case households will  if they spent the eort to become sophisticated \ndeposit their funds initially with the bank and withdraw at date 1. Impatient sophisticated\ndepositors consume d1 while patient sophisticated depositors buy claims on the long-term\ntechnology in the nancial market. Hence, patient sophisticated depositors can buy d1\nclaims on the long-term technology which provide them with a consumption of Rd1\nat date 2. Thus (PCS\n) is no longer the relevant constraint. The optimal deposit contract\nsolves (P1 )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmax\ndB\n;dB\nM - q \u00b7 d1\nR\ns.t. q \u00b7 u (d1\n) \n \u00b7 q \u00b7 u (d1\n) +  \u00b7 (1 - q) \u00b7 u (R \u00b7 d1\n) (PCS\n)\n)\n> M (ICS\n)\n)\nIt is obvious that for any contract satisfying (ICN\n) and (ICS\n), (PCN\n) will hold. From\n) it follows that the risk-sharing of the contract solving (P1 ) must satisfy\nHence, the degrees of risk-sharing implied by the contracts solving (P1) and (P1 ) are\nidentical for   0,  . However, given that d1\n> M the deposit contract solving (P1 )\nwill always provide less prots to the bank than the optimal contract solving (P1 ) with\n M.\nFor   [\u00af\n, ],  < 1 and therefore (PCS\n) is always implied if (ICN\n) holds. Thus the\nprot maximizing deposit contract in (P1 ) is constrained by (ICN\n), (ICS\n), and (PCN\n)\nwhich implies {d1\n} = {M; M}. Clearly, such a contract leaves less prots to the bank\nthan the point of tangency between (PCN\n) and the prot function that is the optimal\ndeposit contract in (P1) for this case.\nFinally it remains to be shown that for   , \u00af\n the contract solving (P1) provides\nhigher prots than the one that is given by (P1 ). But comparing (PCS) and (PCS)\nshows that any contract solving (P1 ) is on a higher indierence curve than a contract\nsolving (P1). Given that the latter contract maximizes prots along that indierence\ncurve, prots provided by this contract must always be higher.\nDerivation of \u00af\n:\nSince the LHS of (PCS\n) and (PCN\n) is identical, (PCS\n) cannot be a binding constraint\nif\n\u00af\n q + (1 - q)R1- u(M)  [q + (1 - q)] u(M).\nSince u(M) < 0 this condition is equivalent to\n\u00af\n \u00b7 q + (1 - q)R1-  [q + (1 - q)] ,\nso we can write\n\u00af\n \n.\nDerivation of :\nThe expression for  comes from equation (4) at equality and substituting M = d1\n d1.
