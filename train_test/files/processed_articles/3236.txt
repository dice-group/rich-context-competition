If, however, results are additionally made dependent on the\ndegree of equality of the distribution of interbank exposures, some deviant cases can be shown.\nThus, the first result of the paper is that not only the completeness and interconnectedness of\nthe network determines its stability but also how equally interbank exposures are distributed.\nThe second result is that the sign of the correlation between the degree of equality of the distri-\nbution of interbank exposures and the average number of bank failures depends on the number\nof interbank links within the financial system as well as on banks' equity ratio and the loss given\ndefault.\nThird, within a money center model, an increasing concentration of assets on core banks de-\ncreases the stability of the system.

Especially\nthe investigation of various channels of interbank contagion has been in the focus of recent re-\nsearch. In the context of this paper, interbank contagion means that the failure of one financial\ninstitution leads to the failure of other financial institutions.\nVarious fields of studies have been developed to capture the numerous facets of this comprehen-\nsive topic (for a literature survey, see Allen and Babus (2009)). From the theoretical point of\nview, Allen and Gale (2000) show that interbank connections can be useful in order to provide an\ninsurance against liquidity shocks. Because of these interbank linkages, however, the bankruptcy\nof one bank can lead to the bankruptcy of other banks. In this context, Allen and Gale show that\na financial system with a complete network structure is less prone to contagion than a financial\nsystem with an incomplete network structure. In addition, they state that a disconnected system\nis useful to limit contagion. Freixas et al. (2000) implement, among other things, a theoretical\nanalysis of contagion within a \"money center system\", where banks in the \"periphery\" are linked\nto one \"core bank\" but not to each other. They show that there are parameter constellations\nunder which the failure of a periphery bank does not lead to contagion, whereas the failure of\nthe \"core bank\" does.\nAnother part of the literature that investigates financial stability are empirical studies that use\nsupervisory data to analyze the danger of domino effects within a banking system (e.g. van\nand Maurer (1998)). As a lot of detailed data on interbank exposures are necessary but often\nnot available, assumptions such as maximum entropy are made concerning the structure of these\nexposures. This means that banks are assumed to spread their interbank claims as equally as\n1Angelika Sachs, Department of Economics, University of Munich, angelika.sachs@lrz.uni-muenchen.de. The\nopinions expressed in this paper are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the Deutsche\nBundesbank. I would like to thank Frank Heid, Christoph Memmel, Thilo Pausch and the participants of the\nresearch seminar of the Deutsche Bundesbank for helpful comments and suggestions.\npossible among their counterparties. However, it is likely that, under the maximum entropy\nassumption, results are biased. In his summary of the analysis of interbank contagion, Upper\n(2007) states that maximum entropy assumptions tend to underestimate the incidence but over-\nestimate the severity of contagion. Mistrulli (2007) investigates interbank contagion using actual\nItalian interbank data and compares his findings with an analysis using the maximum entropy\nassumption. He finds that, for most parameter constellations, the maximum entropy assump-\ntion tends to underestimate the extent of contagion. There are, however, also some parameter\nconstellations (in particular a high loss given default) where the maximum entropy assumption\noverestimates the scope of contagion.\nCifuentes et al. (2005) extend a contagion model of domino effects by simulations that include\ncontagion due to liquidity problems. Within their simulations they use a clearing algorithm\ndeveloped by Eisenberg and Noe (2001).2 The analysis of pure domino effects is also extended\nby Chan-Lau (2010) and Espinosa and Sol\u00b4\ne (2010) by additionally considering contagion due to\nbanks' refinancing problems and due to risk transfers. Also, the impact of market and funding\nliquidity risk on the stability of a financial network is investigated by Aikman et al. (2009).\nIn recent years there has been a growing literature which uses theory of complex networks to\ndescribe real-world financial systems and simulate the effects of potentially dangerous events.\nFor example, Boss et al. (2004) analyze the network topology of the Austrian interbank market.\nIori et al. (2008) apply network theory to describe the Italian overnight money market. Haldane\n(2009) provides a characterization of the world's financial network. Additionally, Gai and Kapa-\ndia (2010), as well as Nier et al. (2008), use random graphs to analyze the danger of contagion\ndependent on certain characteristics of the financial system by simulation. Gai and Kapadia\n(2010) find that for a high connectivity of the network, the probability that contagion occurs\nis low but the impact if contagion occurs is high. Nier et al. (2008) find out by parameterized\nsimulation some non-linearities between certain parameter values and financial stability. Con-\ntrary to most of the empirical literature, where one special financial system is considered to test\nthe danger of contagion, simulation-based work instead tries to find out the main characteristics\nthat make a financial system especially vulnerable to contagion.\nAs, up to now, only few studies exist about the detailed structure of real-world financial net-\nworks, this paper considers several stylized structures and investigates their impact on financial\n2Eisenberg and Noe showed that under mild regularity conditions (strong connectivity and at least one node\nhas positive equity value or all nodes have positive operating cash flows) there exists a unique fixed point that\ndescribes the clearing payment vector of the financial system.\nstability by simulation. This paper builds on the empirical literature that uses entropy methods\nto construct and characterize interbank linkages as well as on literature that tries to simulate the\ndanger of contagion according to certain characteristics of the financial system, in particular the\nmatrix of interbank exposures. For example, it extends the work of Mistrulli (2007) in such a\nway that not only one matrix is compared to the maximum entropy solution but a great variety\nof randomly generated matrices with different network structures. For the first time, a large set\nof valid interbank matrices is constructed by a random generator and then characterized accord-\ning to certain properties, such as entropy, relative entropy to the maximum entropy solution or\nconnectivity.\nAdditionally, this paper differs from Nier et al. (2008) in the sense that, first, balance sheets\nare constructed and, as a second step, the liability matrix is generated, which is, besides row\nand column sums of the matrix, independent from banks' balance sheets. Thus, stability results\nobtained in this paper can be attributed purely to changes in the liability matrix.\nFurthermore, results can be interpreted as an extension to the theoretical literature about the\nimpact of certain network patterns on contagion. Up to now the focus has been exclusively on\nthe completeness and interconnectedness of interbank networks (see Allen and Gale (2000)). In\nthis context, banks are modelled as completely homogeneous, especially with all interbank expo-\nsures being the same size. This work, however, investigates a large number of possible matrices\nwith various possible specifications of interbank exposures and can thus have an additional focus\non the distribution of claims within the network for given completeness and interconnectedness.\nResults of this paper show that the distribution of interbank claims within the network is an\nimportant parameter affecting the stability of the network.\nWithin this paper, pure domino effects between banks are examined. To be more precise, it is\ninvestigated what happens if one bank fails and therefore a part of other banks' claims to that\nbank also fail. It is then possible that creditor banks lose all their capital and therefore fail as\nwell. In the worst case, there are subsequent rounds of failures until the whole system defaults.\nOf course, this is just one channel through which interbank contagion can occur. Further chan-\nnels can be contagion due to liquidity problems because of correlated asset portfolios among\nbanks, or contagion due to refinancing problems affecting banks. As a starting point, however,\nto be able to exclusively focus on the effect of the structure of the liability matrix on the stability\nof the financial network, only domino effects are considered.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the basic structure of the financial system is\ndefined. Section 3 explains in more detail how interbank liability matrices are created and char-\nacterized. Simulations of domino effects are run and results are presented in Section 4 which is\ndivided into the investigation of complete networks (Section 4.1), random graphs (Section 4.2)\nand money center models (Section 4.3). Section 5 summarizes the main findings.\n2 Structure of the financial system\nThe financial system is modelled as a network of N nodes where nodes 1 to N - 1 are financial\ninstitutions (referred to as banks in the following) and node N constitutes the external (non-\nbanking) sector (such as households or non-financial companies). These nodes are linked by\ndirected edges that depict direct claims/obligations between the financial institutions and the\nexternal sector. For some of the subsequent financial networks modelled, it is assumed that there\nare two different types of banks, core banks and periphery banks, that are equal within their\ngroups but differ across groups with regard to their connectivity and size, respectively. The\ndistribution of assets among the two types of banks is given by a concentration ratio CR, that\ndenotes the share of total bank assets that core banks hold.\nBank i's balance sheet has the following structure:\nAIB\ni\n+ AE\ni\ni\n+ LE\ni\n+ Ei\nInterbank assets AIB\ni\n(liabilities LIB\ni\n) are claims (obligations) between banks. External assets\nAE\ni\nare interpreted as credit to the external sector. External liabilities LE\ni\ndenote obligations\nof banks to the external sector such as customer deposits. The balance sheet is completed by\nequity Ei\nthat is given by the difference of bank i's total assets Ai\n(= AIB\ni\n+ AE\ni\n) and liabilities\nLi\n(= LIB\ni\n+ LE\ni\n).\nThe (risk-unweighted) equity ratio, which is presumed to be equal across banks, is given by:3\nr =\nEi\nAIB\ni\n+ AE\ni\nThe financial system is characterized by the total amount of banks' assets Abanks, as well as\nthe total amount of banks' interbank assets AIB. The ratio of interbank to total assets in the\n3More general models including banks with heterogeneous equity ratios can be implemented in a straightforward\nway.\nfinancial system is defined as:\n =\nAIB\nAbanks\nBanks' total assets, total liabilities and equity of this stylized financial system can be perfectly\ndescribed by the total amount of banks' assets Abanks, the total number of banks N - 1, the\nnumber of core banks ncore\n, the concentration ratio CR and banks' equity ratio r.\nThe direct connections between the nodes can be illustrated by a liability matrix:\nL =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nLN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith Li,j\nbeing the obligation of bank i to bank j (i, j {1, ..., N - 1}). Because banks and\nthe external sector do not lend to themselves, Li,i\n= 0  i {1, .., N}. Additionally, as banks\nare linked on both sides of their balance sheets, it is easy to interpret row sums (= total lia-\nbilities) and column sums (= total assets) of the matrix. The elements of the last row, LN,i\n( i {1, .., N - 1}), are equal to banks' external assets AE\ni\n. Thus, the sum of the elements\nin the last row of the matrix is equivalent to banks' total external assets, which are given by\n(1 - ) \u00b7 Abanks. The elements of the last column, Li,N\n( i {1, .., N - 1}), are equal to banks'\nexternal liabilities LE\ni\n. Hence, the sum of the elements in the last column of the matrix (AN\n) is\nequivalent to the total amount of external liabilities of banks. Furthermore, it is assumed that\nthe system is closed, i.e. there is no lending / borrowing to somewhere outside the network.\nTechnically, this means that the sum of row sums of the liability matrix has to be equal to the\nsum of column sums. Thus, total external liabilities of banks (or total assets of the external sec-\ntor AN\n) can be calculated by the difference between total liabilities in the system (the external\nsector included) and total assets of banks.4\n4In the aggregate AN , it is not considered that the external sector might be the owner of the banks. Thus,\nAN only comprises the amount of banks' liabilities that is provided by the external sector.\n3 Creation and characterization of liability matrices\nRegulators often face the problem of limited data. Sometimes only the row sums and column\nsums of the liability matrix are observable. At least it is quite common for some elements of the\nliability matrix to be missing. As already mentioned, this problem is often surrounded by using\nthe assumption that banks spread their exposures as evenly as possible, which is equivalent to\nmaximizing the entropy of the (normalized) liability matrix.5 However, using matrices under the\nmaximum entropy assumption tends to bias the results.\nThe approach of this paper is to abstract from generating only one matrix using the maximum\nentropy assumption but to create, for given row and column sums, a large number of valid liability\nmatrices by a random generator. This is done in two steps: first, a random number Lrand\nij\n, that\ndoes not exceed the number of total liabilities in the system Ltotal (or total assets in the system\nAtotal, respectively), is assigned to each off-diagonal element. This random number is drawn\nfrom a uniform distribution with Lrand\nij\n0, Ltotal ,  i = j, where RSgoal(i) is the aspired\nrow sum and CSgoal(j) is the aspired column sum associated to this element. The interval the\nrandom number is drawn from seems at first more restrictive than it is. A reduction/expansion\nof the interval of the uniform distribution to some smaller/higher upper bound does not change\nthe simulation results. To make the matrix fit exactly, the RAS algorithm is applied:6 In a first\nstep, each element of the matrix is multiplied by the ratio of the aspired row sum (RSgoal(i))\nand the actual row sum (rs(i)).\nLij\n= Lij\n\u00b7\nRSgoal(i)\nrs(i)\nIn a second step, each element of the matrix is multiplied by the ratio of the aspired column sum\n(CSgoal(j)) and the actual column sum (cs(j)).\nLij\n= Lij\n\u00b7\nCSgoal(j)\ncs(j)\nBy repeating these two steps sufficiently often, a matrix with elements that fit to the aspired\nrow and column sums will be generated.\nThe RAS algorithm shows some interesting features. First, restrictions to connectivity can be\nimposed by setting certain elements equal to zero. These elements will remain zero after run-\nning the algorithm. Second, given certain random starting values within the matrix, the RAS\n5For the calculation of the maximum entropy solution of a matrix with given row and column sums, see\nAppendix 1.\n6For a detailed description of the RAS algorithm, see Blien and Graef (1991).\nalgorithm yields a unique solution, independent of the \"position\" of a certain bank within the\nmatrix. The algorithm is also robust to a transposition of the matrix. Third, the randomly\ngenerated starting values determine a certain correlation structure within the matrix. The RAS\nalgorithm determines a unique solution that matches the given correlation structure as well as\npossible and that fulfills row and column sum restrictions. However, there are cases where the\nRAS algorithm does not provide a valid solution. This happens especially when too many zero\nrestrictions are imposed. Within the simulations, randomly generated matrices that do not fit\nare dropped.\nAfter liability matrices are generated, they have to be characterized. As the aim of this pa-\nper is to investigate the stability of the financial system dependent on the matrix of interbank\nexposures, the focus is, for the following characterizations, on the (N - 1 \u00d7 N - 1) matrix that\ncovers the interbank market. It is created by deleting the last row and the last column of the\n(N \u00d7 N) liability matrix L. As a next step, there has to be some normalization of matrices\nbecause entropy measures have to be applied on probability fields. This is done by dividing\nall elements by the total amount of interbank liabilities. As a result, elements of normalized\nmatrices add up to 1 and thus can be treated as probabilities. In the following, all normalized\nelements are marked with a superscript p and written in lower case letters.\nAfter normalization, the next step is to characterize matrices according to the following measures:\n\u00b7 Entropy: In information theory, entropy is a measure for information and can, for example,\nbe explained in the context of search problems. To be more precise, entropy is a lower bound\nof the average path length from the root to the leaves of a binary search tree. Thus, entropy\nis a lower bound to the average number of yes/no questions that is needed to obtain full\ninformation. The more equal the probability distribution of the elements in the search\nspace, the more questions are on average needed to obtain the desired element and, hence,\nthe higher entropy is. The more unequal the probability distribution, the lower entropy is.\nThe lowest entropy (equal to zero) can be obtained when one element in the search space\noccurs with probability 1 and the other elements with probability 0, i.e. the most unequal\ndistribution of elements occurs.\nThis entropy measure can be reinterpreted to quantify the inequality of the distribution\nof claims of a liability matrix. Using the normalization mentioned above, the elements\nof the matrix can be seen as realizations of a probability distribution of elements within\na search space that need not be defined more specifically. Entropy measures the amount\nof information inherent in these realizations and is maximal if banks spread their claims\n/ obligations as equally as possible. The higher the entropy, the more equally interbank\nclaims are distributed for given row and column sums. The entropy is calculated by:7\nENT = -\nlp\nij\n\u00b7 ln lp\nij\n\u00b7 Relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence) to maximum entropy solution: The\nrelative entropy is a measure for the difference between two probability distributions. Given\ntwo normalized liability matrices Xp (in this case the maximum entropy solution X, see\nAppendix 1, with last row and last column deleted and normalized by the total amount of\ninterbank liabilities) and Lp (in this case a valid normalized liability matrix generated by\nrandom generator), the relative entropy is given by:\nRE =\nlp\nij\nln\nlp\nij\nxp\nij\nA higher value of RE denotes a greater difference between the two distributions. In the\nfinancial system modelled here, a higher relative entropy means a greater distance to the\nprobability distribution of the maximum entropy solution and thus a more unequal distri-\nbution of claims among banks. As long as the relative entropy to the maximum entropy\nsolution is considered and banks are assumed to be of equal size, there is a negative linear\nrelationship between the entropy of a matrix and its relative entropy to the maximum\nentropy solution.8\n\u00b7 Connectivity: The connectivity of the financial system can be described by the probability\nthat a directed link between two banks exists. While constructing the liability matrix of\na random graph, each off-diagonal interbank element is (independently) given a certain\npositive real number with probability p and 0 with probability 1 - p. This probability p is\ncalled Erd\u00a8\nos-R\u00b4\nenyi probability. However, during implementation one has to be careful that,\n7When applying the entropy measure in the context of binary search trees, log2 is used. However, in economics\nliterature it is more common to use the natural logarithm. This is equivalent to multiplying a constant factor.\n8The general derivation of this linear relationship is provided in Appendix 2. Simulation results confirm this\ntheoretical finding.\nfor given starting values (including zeros with a certain probability), the RAS algorithm\nis able to find a valid solution of matrix entries. This problem increases with decreasing\nconnectivity. The algorithm used in this paper simply drops matrices that are not valid.\n4 Simulation of domino effects\nWithin this paper, pure domino effects are modelled dependent on characteristics of the inter-\nbank liability structure.9 As a trigger event, one bank fails.10 Assuming a certain loss given\ndefault (LGD), creditor banks lose a share of their claims to the defaulting bank.11 If this lost\nshare is larger than the creditor bank's equity, the creditor bank also fails. If one or more banks\nfail due to the first failure, the next round starts with banks losing additional shares of their\nclaims to failing banks. Thus, a bank fails if:\nInterbank exposures to failed banks  LGD > Equity\nFor a large number of randomly generated matrices, it is investigated how many banks fail\non average, after the failure of one bank, dependent on the characteristics of the liability matrix\nmentioned in Section 3. To be more precise, it is calculated which percentage of total assets of\nthe banking system belongs to failing banks, i.e. which percentage of total bank assets is affected\nby bank failure.12 Note, however, that this does not mean that all assets affected by bank failure\nactually default. This depends on the value of the loss given default.\nTo depict the results graphically, value intervals of characteristics have to be defined. One pos-\nsibility to do this is to adjust interval size according to the number of observations. After the\nrandom generation of matrices, they are sorted according to their characterization values, and\nthen intervals are defined with each interval having the same number of observations.\nThe network simulations are run several times and for different banks failing initially to check\n9For advantages and disadvantages of modelling domino effects, see Upper (2007).\n10This is a rather simple way to model a shock on the financial system. A more sophisticated approach is, for\nexample, used by Elsinger et al. (2006), who apply aggregate macroeconomic shocks to test for the resilience of\nthe Austrian interbank market.\n11In this paper, a constant, exogenously given LGD is assumed. An obvious extension is to endogenize the\nLGD as, for example, in Degryse and Nguyen (2007).\n12An alternative target value to measure the harm of interbank contagion is the loss of the external sector,\nwhich can be computed easily within this model.\nhow robust these results are with respect to sample changes and to changes in the trigger event.\n4.1 Complete networks\nTo begin with, simulations are run for complete networks, i.e. it is assumed that there exists\na directed link from each node to all other nodes.

Under the assumption that all banks are of equal size, the average\nnumber of bank defaults dependent on entropy can be derived easily by multiplying the average\npercentage of banks' assets affected by failure by the total number of banks (in this case, 10).\nHence, the more equally banks spread their claims, the fewer institutions default on average.\nThese results suggest that, within a complete network and for the parameter values given above,\nshocks are absorbed best if banks diversify their (credit) risk exposures well. The results, as well\nas all subsequent simulation results, are robust to changes in the sample and to changes in the\nbank that fails first.\nFigure 2, which shows the relation between relative entropy to the maximum entropy solution\nRelative entropy\n% of total assets of banking system affected on average\nFigure 2: % of total assets of banking system affected on average dependent on relative entropy\nand average percentage of banks' assets affected, yields an inverse result compared to Figure 1:\nThe higher the relative entropy, the higher the percentage of banks' assets affected and therefore\nthe higher the average number of bank failures. Thus, because of the negative linear relationship\nbetween entropy and relative entropy shown in Appendix 2, Figure 2 also confirms that a more\nequal distribution of claims leads to a more stable system.\nUp to now, the impact of the distribution of claims on financial stability can be summed up\nas follows:\nResult 1: In a complete network, for the parameter values given above,13 a liability matrix\nwith an equal distribution of interbank exposures (a high entropy or a low relative entropy to\nthe maximum entropy solution, respectively) leads to a more stable system than a liability matrix\nwith an unequal distribution of interbank exposures.\nA connectivity of 100% is rather unrealistic. Thus, some network has to be designed that omits\nsome directed links within the financial system. One option in this context is to model random\ngraphs.\n13In the sections below, it is specified in more detail for which parameter values these results hold.\nConcerning completeness and interconnectedness of the network only and assuming that banks\nare completely homogeneous, especially with a completely homogeneous asset / liability struc-\nture, subsequent results should be expected according to the theoretical findings of Allen and\nGale (2000). They examine three types of networks that are displayed in Figure 3. The complete\nand perfectly interconnected network (Figure 1 in Allen and Gale) is equivalent to a random\ngraph with an Erd\u00a8\nos-R\u00b4\nenyi probability of 100%. In this case, the possibility that contagion\noccurs is rather low because the more complete a financial system, the greater is the potential\nfor risk diversification. With decreasing connectivity, the network structure moves towards sys-\ntems that are still highly interconnected but also incomplete (equivalent to Figure 2 in Allen\nand Gale). Allen and Gale show that these systems are more vulnerable to contagion. With\nconnectivity decreasing further, the network structure becomes equivalent to the disconnected\nsystem in Figure 3 in Allen and Gale. This disconnection can limit the extent of contagion.\nHence there is a non-monotonic relationship between completeness of the network and financial\nstability.\nIn the following simulations, the degree of disconnection is measured by the average number of\nstrongly connected components across all matrices in a sample. Within a strongly connected\ncomponent, every bank can be reached by every other bank. This does not mean that there\nare direct links between all banks as in a complete network. It is sufficient that there exists a\ndirected path between all nodes. If the graph contains only one strongly connected component,\nthe failure of one bank can (potentially after several rounds of contagion) cause the failure of\nall other banks. If there is more than one strongly connected component, however, it is possible\nthat the failure of one bank cannot cause the failure of all other banks because not all banks\ncan be reached by the failing bank. Hence, the higher the average number of strongly connected\ncomponents for a given Erd\u00a8\nos-R\u00b4\nenyi probability, the more disconnected is the system.\nAs mentioned above, the analysis of Allen and Gale is based on a banking system with completely\nhomogeneous banks with a completely equal asset / liability structure. Within this simulation, in\naddition to completeness and interconnectedness, a third aspect is introduced into the analysis:\nthe distribution of claims within the system.\nFIG 1: Complete market structure FIG 2: Incomplete market structure FIG 3: Disconnected incomplete\nmarket structure\nFigure 3: Types of networks investigated by Allen and Gale (2000)\nIn the following, the default algorithm is run for different values of the Erd\u00a8\nos-R\u00b4\nenyi probabil-\nity, all other parameter values kept equal to those of Section 4.1. Each off-diagonal element of\nthe liability matrix that denotes an interbank claim / obligation is set equal to zero with this\nprobability.14 As for certain zero constellations, the RAS algorithm is not able to find a valid\nsolution; matrices that do not fit are dropped. Furthermore, matrices where the actual share\nof existing links to total possible links deviates more than 0.02 from the desired connectivity\nare also dropped. Thus, only matrices that fit exactly to desired row and column sums and to\ndesired connectivity are used for the analysis.\nTo capture the degree of disconnection of the randomly generated network, the number of strongly\nconnected components is computed for each graph using an algorithm developed by Tarjan\n(1972). After generating a large number of matrices, the average number of strongly connected\ncomponents for a given Erd\u00a8\nos-R\u00b4\nenyi probability is calculated. It turns out that the system starts\nto become disconnected for p = 0.5 with an average number of strongly connected components\nof around 1.03. For p = 0.3, more randomly generated graphs are not perfectly interconnected\nany more, which yields an average number of strongly connected components of about 1.80. The\ndegree of disconnection jumps up for p = 0.1, where the average number of strongly connected\n14Alternatively, the whole graph (including the node that denotes the external sector) can be modelled as a\nrandom graph. The aim of this paper is, however, to investigate the impact of the network topology of the\ninterbank market on financial stability. Furthermore, it is certainly more realistic to assume that all banks have\nconnections to the external sector.\ncharacteristic p ENT RE\nTable 1: Correlation coefficients between characteristics in a random graph (generation of 25, 000\nos-R\u00b4\nenyi probability, RE =\nrelative entropy, ENT = entropy\nfor an Erd\u00a8\nos-R\u00b4\nenyi probability of 10% to 100% (with 10%-steps) using the same parameter val-\nues as in the previous section.\nAs a first step, to capture the effect of completeness and interconnectedness on financial sta-\nbility, the average percentage of bank assets affected by failures dependent on the connectivity\nof the financial system is calculated. Figure 4 shows the average percentage of banks' assets\naffected by failures dependent on the median entropy for a given Erd\u00a8\nos-R\u00b4\nenyi probability. It\ncan be seen that a complete network (i.e. with p = 100%) leads on average to matrices that are\ncharacterized by high entropy. With decreasing connectivity, entropy also decreases, meaning\nthat claims are distributed more unequally (according to Table 1, there is a high correlation of\n0.94 between entropy and the Erd\u00a8\nos-R\u00b4\nenyi probability). Furthermore, Figure 4 shows that with\ndecreasing completeness (i.e. a decreasing Erd\u00a8\nos-R\u00b4\nenyi probability) the average percentage of\nassets affected by bank failure rises. This is in line with the finding of Allen and Gale that an\nincomplete but perfectly interconnected network leads to a less stable financial system than a\ncomplete network. The effect appearing in Allen and Gale's disconnected network can be ob-\nserved for p = 10%. For p = 10%, the average percentage of assets affected (and therefore the\naverage number of bank failures) is much lower than for p = 30% which can be explained by the\nlarge rise in the average number of strongly connected components from around 1.80 to around\nThese results shown in Figure 4 can be obtained on average if networks are exclusively charac-\nterized by their completeness and interconnectedness. However, the effect of the structure of the\nfinancial system on financial stability can be analyzed in more detail by additionally considering\nthe effect of the distribution of claims for a given connectivity. Intervals of characteristics are, as\nin Section 4.1, defined in a way that the number of observations is the same within all intervals.\nEntropy\n% of total assets of banking system affected on average\nFigure 4: % of total assets of banking system affected on average dependent on entropy and\nconnectivity\nSimulations show that results are still not dependent on which bank failed first and the sample\ngenerated.\nIn Figure 5 it can be seen that for p = 100% the same result is obtained as in Figure 1. A\nEntropy\n% of total assets of banking system affected on average\nFigure 5: % of total assets of banking system affected on average dependent on entropy and\nconnectivity\nliability matrix with a higher entropy leads to a lower average percentage of assets affected by\nbank failure and therefore a lower average number of bank failures. However, with the 100%\nconnectivity assumption, only rather high values for entropy can be generated. Inserting zero\noff-diagonal \"interbank\" elements into the matrix with 10% probability, which is equivalent to\np = 90%, generates matrices with a lower entropy. The negative correlation between bank failures\nand entropy still holds for p = 90%. With decreasing connectivity, matrices with an even lower\nentropy can be created. The negative correlation between entropy and average bank failures,\nhowever, becomes weaker and turns into a positive correlation. This means that for a given low\nErd\u00a8\nos-R\u00b4\nenyi probability (e.g. p = 50%, p = 30% or p = 10%), a comparatively high entropy\nleads on average to more banks defaulting than a comparatively low entropy.\nAn interpretation for this observation is that, for a high connectivity, an equal distribution of\ninterbank claims is the best shock absorber due to credit risk diversification, whereas an unequal\ndistribution of claims increases the probability that there is a second-round effect after the failure\nof one bank. On the contrary, when connectivity is low, the failure of one bank is very likely\nto cause second-round effects because the average amount of interbank exposures to the few\nconnected banks is very high. Hence, the more equal the distribution to the few other banks, the\nhigher the probability that all these banks fail because there are not enough counterparties to\ndiversify the losses induced by the shock. On the other hand, the more unequal the distribution\nto the few other banks, the higher the probability that not all of these banks fail and therefore\nthe average number of failures is smaller in this case.\nThus, a change in the average percentage of assets in the banking sector affected by failure (i.e.\na change in the average number of bank failures) is not just due to a change in connectivity\nbut can also be due to a change in the distribution of interbank claims. For example, though\nthe overall average number of banks failing is higher for a connectivity of 30% compared to a\nconnectivity of 50% (see Figure 4), a system with a very unequal distribution of interbank claims\n(low entropy) and 30% connectivity is more stable than a system with a rather equal distribution\nof interbank claims (high entropy) and 50% connectivity (see Figure 5). Also, a system with a\nvery equal distribution of interbank claims (high entropy) and 90% connectivity is more stable\nthan a network with 100% connectivity and a very unequal distribution of interbank claims (low\nentropy).\nThus, by additionally considering the distribution of claims within the system, it can be seen\nthat a complete network can be more unstable than an incomplete but perfectly interconnected\nnetwork. This finding extends the work of Allen and Gale in a way that results could change if\ninterbank claims are allowed to be heterogeneous.\nFigure 6 and 7 show the average number of bank failures dependent on the relative entropy to the\nmaximum entropy solution. As entropy and relative entropy are exactly negatively correlated\n(see Appendix 2 and Table 1), these two figures can be regarded as the mirror image of Figures\nRelative entropy\n% of total assets of banking system affected on average\nFigure 6: % of total assets of banking system affected on average dependent on relative entropy\nand connectivity\nRelative entropy\n% of total assets of banking system affected on average\nFigure 7: % of total assets of banking system affected on average dependent on relative entropy\nand connectivity\nThe results of this paragraph can be summarized as follows:\nResult 2: Financial stability does not only depend on the completeness and interconnected-\nness of the network but also on the distribution of claims within the system.\nResult 3: For the parameter values given above,15 the sign of the correlation between the\nequality of the distribution of claims (measured by entropy and relative entropy) and financial\nstability changes with decreasing completeness of the network. For high completeness (and high\ninterconnectedness) an equal distribution of claims leads to the most stable system. For lower\ncompleteness (but still high interconnectedness) the positive correlation between entropy and\nnumber of banks failing weakens. For very low completeness (and low interconnectedness) a\nmore unequal distribution of interbank claims leads to a more stable system.\nAs long as banks are assumed to be of equal size, the characterization of matrices by entropy and\nrelative entropy yields exactly the same results. Thus, all the following investigations are only\nmade dependent on entropy. As a next step, some sensitivity analysis is done by varying one\nparameter (LGD, equity ratio or ratio of interbank assets to total assets in the banking system),\nas well as connectivity, and fixing all other parameters at their benchmark value set in Section\n4.2.2 Varying loss given default and connectivity\nFigure 8 shows the not very surprising result that, for a given connectivity, the average percentage\nof assets affected by bank failure (and thus also the average number of bank failures) increases\nwith an increasing loss given default. An interesting observation is that for a high LGD (= 100%)\nthe effect of a disconnected system (equivalent to Figure 3 in Allen and Gale) is already visible\nbetween p = 50% and p = 30%. Starting from p = 50% the average number of bank defaults\ndecreases with decreasing connectivity. Hence, the impact of the disconnection of the financial\nsystem becomes more important for high rates of LGD where the average number of bank defaults\ntends to be very high.\nFigure 9 shows that a LGD of 100% leads to a positive correlation between assets affected by\nbank failure and entropy, even for a high connectivity of the network. A LGD of 30% leads\n15In the sections below, it is specified in more detail for which parameter values these results hold.\nEntropy\n% of total assets of banking system affected on average\nFigure 8: % of total assets of banking system affected on average dependent on entropy and\nconnectivity\nto a negative correlation between assets affected by bank failure and entropy, even for a low\nconnectivity (up to p = 30%) of the network. An explanation for this observation is that a high\nLGD makes a system vulnerable to interbank contagion as a high share of claims to the failing\nbanks defaults. Thus, it can be assumed that contagion occurs with certainty. In this case, it\nis better to have a relatively unequal distribution of interbank exposures so that only few banks\nare hit by a second-round effect of contagion. For a low LGD, the system is rather resilient to\ninterbank contagion. In this case, second-round effects only occur if interbank exposures are\ndistributed very unequally, i.e. interbank claims are not well diversified among counterparties.\n4.2.3 Varying equity ratio and connectivity\nFigure 10 shows, not surprisingly, that a lower equity ratio leads, for a given Erd\u00a8\nos-R\u00b4\nenyi prob-\nability, to a higher average number of bank assets affected by failure. Again, the impact of\nthe disconnection of the financial system becomes more important for parameter constellations\nwhere the average number of bank defaults tends to be very high, i.e. for low equity ratios.\nLooking at the effect of the distribution of claims for given connectivity in Figure 11, it can be\nseen that for an equity ratio of 9% the correlation of entropy and percentage of assets affected\nby bank failure is negative for all values of p (except p = 10%). For an equity ratio of 3% the\ncorrelation is always positive. Similar to the variation of LGD, systems with high equity ratios\nare more stable with an equal distribution of claims because second-round effects only occur\nEntropy\n% of total assets of banking system affected on average\nFigure 9: % of total assets of banking system affected on average dependent on entropy and\nconnectivity\nEntropy\n% of total assets of banking system affected on average\nFigure 10: % of total assets of banking system affected on average dependent on entropy and\nconnectivity\nwhen interbank claims are not well diversified. Systems with low equity ratios are, for a given\nErd\u00a8\nos-R\u00b4\nenyi probability, more stable with an unequal distribution of claims so that second-round\neffects (that occur almost with certainty) only hit few counterparties in the financial system.\nEntropy\n% of total assets of banking system affected on average\nFigure 11: % of total assets of banking system affected on average dependent on entropy and\nconnectivity\n4.2.4 Varying ratio of interbank to total assets and connectivity\nAdditionally, the ratio of interbank assets to total assets  can be varied. Figure 12 shows that\na higher ratio of interbank assets to total assets leads, for a given Erd\u00a8\nos-R\u00b4\nenyi probability, to a\nhigher average percentage of assets affected by bank failure. This is not surprising because, for\na given equity ratio and LGD, banks become more vulnerable to the default of a neighboring\nbank. The reason is that, on average, the bilateral exposure per counterparty increases with an\nincreasing ratio of interbank to total assets. Furthermore, for high numbers of bank failures (i.e.\nhigh numbers of ) the effect of a disconnected system is again already visible for an Erd\u00a8\nos-R\u00b4\nenyi\nprobability below 50%.\nFigure 13 shows that the correlation between entropy and average percentage of assets affected\nby failure changes from positive to negative at an Erd\u00a8\nos-R\u00b4\nenyi probability of around 70%, inde-\npendent of the value of . Thus, contrary to the variation of LGD and r, there is no influence\nof  on the correlation between entropy and average number of banks defaults.16 However, one\n16In additional simulations the loss given default and the equity ratio were varied for different values of .

On the other hand, the sign of the correlation tends to be negative for parameters\nthat make the system resilient to interbank contagion (i.e. a low LGD and high equity ratios).\nFor intermediate parameter values, the sign of the correlation between equality of the distribu-\ntion of claims and average number of banks defaulting changes from negative to positive with\npercentage of assets affected, and low values of LGD or high values of r lead to a negative correlation, independent\nof . Thus, a variation of LGD and r changes the correlation between entropy and average percentage of assets\naffected by failure; a variation of , however, does not.\nEntropy\n% of total assets of banking system affected on average\nFigure 13: % of total assets of banking system affected on average dependent on entropy and\nconnectivity\ndecreasing connectivity (see results in Section 4.1 and 4.2.1).\nIn further simulations, additional parameters are varied. At first, the total number of assets\nwas changed. This, however, does not alter the results as relative numbers (e.g. equity ratio\nor ratio of interbank assets to total assets) do not change. Increasing the number of banks in\nthe system makes it (all other variables kept equal) less vulnerable to the failure of one bank as\nthe average amount of bilateral exposures per counterparty decreases with an increasing number\nof counterparties. Furthermore, these simulations were run for \"extreme\" parameter values, i.e.\nparameters that all make a financial system very unstable (high LGD, low equity ratio and high\nshare of interbank assets to total assets) or stable, respectively. The results confirmed the main\nfindings summarized in result 4.\n4.3 Money center models\nThe analysis of the impact of the distribution of claims on financial stability in random graphs\nleads to some interesting results. It is, however, questionable, whether a random graph is a good\ndescription of real world financial networks. In the literature, it is sometimes stated that a more\nadequate model of a financial system is a scale-free network (see, for example, Boss et al. (2004)\nand Soram\u00a8\naki et al. (2006)). Furthermore, some recent studies prefer to model financial systems\nas (multiple) money center systems (see e.g. Craig and von Peter (2010)), where few large core\nbanks are strongly interconnected (i.e. they form a complete network) and a larger number of\nsmall banks in the periphery are only connected to one core bank but not to other banks in the\nperiphery. Figure 14 shows an example of a money center model (without the external sector).\nFigure 14: Example of a money center model with 15 banks (3 core banks and 12 banks in the\nperiphery)\nThe financial network of Figure 14, including the external sector, can be described by an adja-\ncency matrix:\nL =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAN\n- - - - - - - -\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. |\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nLN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interbank part of this adjacency matrix, i.e. the (N - 1) \u00d7 (N - 1) matrix that is ob-\ntained when deleting the last row and the last column of L, can be written in block matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n- - -\n\n\n\n\n\nBy assumption, the money center model has to follow certain patterns. First, all core banks\nare strongly connected to each other. Thus, all off-diagonal elements of the top left corner of the\nadjacency matrix LIB (1) have to be equal to one. Second, each bank in the periphery is linked\nto exactly one money center bank in both directions. Thus, the top right corner (2) has exactly\none non-zero element per column and the bottom left corner of the adjacency matrix (3) is the\nexactly transposed version of the top right corner. Third, banks in the periphery are not linked\nto each other. Hence, the bottom right corner (4) contains only zeros. By construction, the\nstrongly connected component always includes all nodes in the system.\n17The way this money center system is constructed is very similar to the \"block-model approach\" of Craig and\nvon Peter (2010). The conditions a money center system has to fulfill are, however, stronger in this paper.\nAfter constructing the adjacency matrix, the edges of the graph obtain weights that are, similar\nto the case of the random graph, created by a random generator. For given row and column\nsums, elements are again adjusted by using the RAS algorithm.\n4.3.1 Varying the number of core banks and concentration ratio\nAt first, the stability of a money center model is investigated by varying two main parameters\nthat characterize its pattern: the number of core banks ncore\nand the concentration ratio CR.\nTo create a more reasonable ratio of core banks to periphery banks, the number of banks in\nthe financial system is increased to 15, i.e. N = 16. Remaining parameters are set at their\nbenchmark values, i.e. LGD = 0.5, r = 0.06 and  = 0.3. Total assets in the banking system\nare again set at Abanks = 1, 000 and each simulation is run for a sample of 50, 000 randomly\ngenerated matrices. While for the random graph it does not matter which bank fails first, for\nthe money center model it is assumed that a core bank fails.18 Figures 15 to 18 show the average\npercentage of total assets that are affected by bank failure for ncore\n= 5 to ncore\neach number of core banks the concentration ratio is varied from CR = 0.99 (core banks hold\nalmost all assets in the banking system) to CR = 0.4 (core banks hold 40% of total assets in the\nbanking system). The lower bound of the concentration ratio is set in such a way that, for all\nvalues of ncore\ninvestigated, it cannot happen that core banks have smaller balance sheet totals\nthan periphery banks.\nNot surprisingly, entropy decreases with an increasing concentration ratio as a higher concen-\ntration of assets among few core banks implies a more unequal distribution of claims within the\nfinancial system. Furthermore, for a given number of core banks, the average percentage of as-\nsets affected by bank failure increases with the concentration ratio. One reason is that the total\namount of assets of the bank that fails first, and therefore the initial percentage of assets affected\nby bank failure, is higher. But this is not the only effect. With increasing size of core banks\ncompared to banks in the periphery (i.e. a higher CR), and all other variables kept equal, the\naverage weights of the links between core banks increase in the liability matrices generated. Thus\nthe amount of interbank assets between core banks becomes larger on average, which makes core\nbanks more vulnerable to interbank contagion. And the more core banks fail, the more banks in\nthe periphery are on average affected by domino effects.\nComparing the stability of the financial system by varying the number of core banks ncore\nit can\n18Additionally, simulations with a periphery bank failing were run. Not surprisingly, in this case, the financial\nsystem is more stable than in the case of a core bank failing.\nbe seen that, all other parameters kept equal, the stability of the financial system increases with\nan increasing number of core banks. This effect is again due to the size of the core banks. For a\ngiven concentration ratio, the size of the core banks decreases with an increasing number of core\nbanks. Thus, the average amount of interbank assets between core banks also becomes smaller\nand the probability that domino effects between core banks occur, is reduced.\nHence, the main result of this paragraph is:\nEntropy\n% of total assets of banking system affected on average\nCR = 0.99 money center system (n\ncore\nFigure 15: % of total assets of banking system affected on average dependent on entropy and\nconcentration ratio\nResult 5: Increasing asset concentration (a higher concentration ratio for a given number of\ncore banks or a lower number of core banks for a given concentration ratio) within a money\ncenter system makes it more unstable on average.\n4.3.2 Comparison to random graphs\nAdditionally, the stability of a money center system is compared to the stability of a random\ngraph. As a benchmark, the investigation of the stability of random graphs with the same system\nsize (in terms of total assets) and the same number of banks as in the money center system is\nincluded in each subsequent figure. When modelling the random graph, it is assumed that all\nEntropy\n% of total assets of banking system affected on average\nCR = 0.99 money center system (n\ncore\nFigure 16: % of total assets of banking system affected on average dependent on entropy and\nconcentration ratio\nEntropy\n% of total assets of banking system affected on average\nmoney center system (n\ncore\nFigure 17: % of total assets of banking system affected on average dependent on entropy and\nconcentration ratio\nEntropy\n% of total assets of banking system affected on average\nmoney center system (n\ncore\nFigure 18: % of total assets of banking system affected on average dependent on entropy and\nconcentration ratio\nbanks have homogeneous balance sheet totals and are linked randomly with a certain probability.\nThe money center system is interlinked according to the description in Section 4.3.\nHowever, one has to be careful when setting the parameter values for the money center system.\nWithin a random graph, the average amount of bilateral interbank exposures (over the whole\nsample of generated matrices) is the same between all banks. In a money center model, though,\nif the concentration ratio is chosen too low (or the number of core banks is chosen too high),\ni.e. core banks do not have a balance sheet total that is large enough compared to periphery\nbanks, the assumed network topology of the money center model leads to interbank connections\nwhere core banks have less exposures to each other than to banks in the periphery. The reason\nis that periphery banks have all their interbank exposures to one core bank by assumption. To\nobtain a valid liability matrix for given balance sheet totals, the result is a very low weight on\ninterbank exposures among core banks. This does not fit to realistic banking systems. Thus,\nin the following simulations, it is assumed that the average amount of bilateral interbank assets\neach core bank holds against another core bank is at least as high as the average amount of bilat-\neral interbank assets a core bank holds against a periphery bank. This amounts to a minimum\nconcentration ratio of CR = 0.25 for ncore\n19These results are obtained by calculating the average amount of bilateral interbank assets between two core\nbanks and between a core and a periphery bank by simulation for different values of CR (in steps of 0.05). The\nFigures 19 to 22 show that (for the same values of N, Abanks, , LGD and r) the random graph\nis always more stable on average than the money center system with the minimum concentration\nratio derived above.20\nSeveral reasons for this result can be mentioned. First, in the money center model, the initial\npercentage of assets affected by bank failure is larger than in the random graph. The reason\nis that, for the given minimum concentration ratio, core banks in the money center model are\nalways larger than banks in a random graph. Second, a large balance sheet total of the failing\ncore bank implies on average a high amount of interbank claims defaulting in the first round.\nThus, the initial shock is larger compared to a random graph. Third, among core banks there are\nonly limited possibilities of risk diversification, as they are only linked to the other core banks\nand to few periphery banks. Additionally, there is no sufficient risk diversification possible for\nperiphery banks that hold all their claims against one core bank. Fourth, money center models\nare always strongly connected by assumption, i.e. they have only one strongly connected com-\nponent. Hence, domino effects can never be curtailed by disconnection of the financial system.\nEntropy\n% of total assets of banking system affected on average\nrandom graph\nmoney center system (n\ncore\nFigure 19: % of total assets of banking system affected on average dependent on entropy and\nconcentration ratio (money center system) or connectivity (random graph)\nvalue of CR, where the discrepancy between the average amount of interbank assets each core bank holds against\nanother core bank and the average amount of interbank assets a core bank holds against a periphery bank is\nminimal, is then chosen as the minimum concentration ratio for further simulations.\n20In additional simulations the same result was obtained for extreme values of LGD and r.\nEntropy\n% of total assets of banking system affected on average\nrandom graph\nmoney center system (n\ncore\nFigure 20: % of total assets of banking system affected on average dependent on entropy and\nconcentration ratio (money center system) or connectivity (random graph)\nEntropy\n% of total assets of banking system affected on average\nrandom graph\nmoney center model (n\ncore\nFigure 21: % of total assets of banking system affected on average dependent on entropy and\nconcentration ratio (money center system) or connectivity (random graph)\nEntropy\n% of total assets of banking system affected on average\nrandom graph\nmoney center system (n\ncore\nFigure 22: % of total assets of banking system affected on average dependent on entropy and\nconcentration ratio (money center system) or connectivity (random graph)\nThus, to summarize the main findings of this paragraph, it can be said that:\nResult 6: Under the assumption that the average amount of bilateral interbank assets be-\ntween two core banks is at least as high as between a core and a periphery bank, a money center\nsystem with asset concentration among core banks is, in all previously conducted simulations,\nless stable on average than a system of banks with homogeneous size that follows a random\ngraph.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, the impact of the structure of the interbank liabilities matrix on financial stability\nis analyzed. After characterizing the financial system according to the number of banks, total\nassets in the banking system, equity ratio, the ratio of interbank to total assets and loss given\ndefault, a large number of valid interbank liability matrices is created by random generator for\ngiven row and column sums. Thus, for the first time, interbank contagion is investigated for\na large sample of interbank matrices. These matrices are then characterized by entropy and\nrelative entropy to the maximum entropy solution, which constitute measures of the equality of\nthe distribution of interbank exposures. This procedure makes it possible to investigate financial\nstability dependent on how equally interbank exposures are distributed. As a next step, domino\neffects resulting from the default of one bank are modelled. As long as banks are assumed to\nbe of equal size (to be able to only focus on the effects of the structure of the liability matrix),\nit does not matter which bank fails first. Additionally, as a large number of valid matrices is\ngenerated, results do not depend on the sample of matrices.\nThe first simulations are conducted for complete networks and \"intermediate\" parameter values.\nThe main result is that a more equal distribution of interbank claims leads to a more stable\nfinancial system.\nThese results, however, change if an incomplete network is considered. Starting with a random\ngraph and, again, \"intermediate\" parameter values, it can be seen that the sign of the correlation\nbetween equality of distribution of claims and percentage of assets affected by bank failures\nchanges with decreasing connectivity. Furthermore, a crucial result of these simulations is that\nnot only completeness and interconnectedness of a financial network, as investigated theoretically\nin Allen and Gale (2000), matters, but also the distribution of claims within the financial network.\nIn this paper, cases can be shown where, contrary to the findings of Allen and Gale, a complete\nnetwork (with an unequal distribution of claims) is less stable than an incomplete but perfectly\ninterconnected network (with an equal distribution of claims).\nAs a next step, further sensitivity analysis is implemented by varying loss given default, banks'\nequity ratio and the ratio of interbank assets to total assets. The main result in this context is\nthat the sign of the correlation between entropy and the average percentage of assets affected\nby bank failure depends on connectivity, loss given default and equity ratio. For high values of\nLGD and low values of r (i.e. parameters that make a financial system vulnerable to interbank\ncontagion) the sign of the correlation between entropy and the average percentage of assets\naffected tends to be positive, while for low values of LGD and high values of r (i.e. parameters\nthat make a financial system resilient to interbank contagion) the sign of the correlation tends\nto be negative. For \"intermediate\" parameter values the sign of the correlation changes from\nnegative to positive with decreasing connectivity.\nA second, probably more realistic, approach to modelling incomplete networks is to consider\nmoney center systems. The main idea of money center models is to distinguish between large\ncore banks that are strongly connected to each other and small banks in the periphery that are\nonly linked to one core bank. Not surprisingly, the more concentrated assets are within a money\ncenter system, the less stable it is. Additionally, using reasonable parameters for the number of\ncore banks and the concentration of assets among core banks, it turns out that, for all simulations\nrun, the money center system is less stable than a random graph with homogeneous bank size.\nAs a conclusion, this paper extends the existing literature on interbank contagion within a\nfinancial network by explicitly considering the distribution of claims within the financial system,\nand therefore gives a variety of insights into the determinants of financial stability. This approach\ncan be widened to aspects of interbank contagion extending domino effects (e.g. contagion due to\nliquidity problems or refinancing problems). Therefore, this approach leaves a lot of new topics\nfor future research.\n6 References\nAikman, A.; Alessandri, P.; Eklund, B.; Gai, P.; Kapadia, S.; Martin, E.; Mora, N.;\nSterne, G.; Willison, M.
