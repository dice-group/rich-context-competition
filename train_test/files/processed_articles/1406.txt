Multiple regression methods were\nused to examine the independent association of history of trying to lose weight with reported intakes of energy, nutrients,\npercentage energy from low-nutrient-dense foods (sweeteners, baked and dairy desserts, visible fats and salty snacks), and\nserum concentrations of vitamins, carotenoids and lipids.\nResults: Men and women in the Y=Y group reported lower energy intake relative to the N=N group (P < 0.0000). However, the\nreported percentage energy from fat and carbohydrate by the Y=Y group did not differ from the N=N group. Percentage of\nenergy from low-nutrient-dense foods was lower in men in the Y=Y group but not women. The relative odds of reporting the\nestimated average requirement (EAR) of folate, and vitamins A, B6\n, C, E and iron and adequate intake (AI) of calcium were\nnot adversely affected by history of trying to lose weight in men. In women, the odds of meeting the folate and vitamin E EAR\nwere lower in the Y=Y group. Some history of weight loss categories were significant positive predictors of serum vitamin and\ncarotenoid concentrations, or unrelated to cardiovascular disease risk biomarkers.\nConclusions: There was little evidence for increased nutritional risk in those reporting repeat attempts at weight loss.\nKeywords: weight cycling; yo-yo dieting; weight variability; food intake; low-nutrient-dense foods; biomarkers; NHANES III\nIntroduction\nWith increasing prevalence of obesity around the globe, a\nlarge proportion of individuals attempt to lose weight for\nhealth or aesthetic reasons.1 \u00ad 3 Most attempts at weight loss\ninvolve dietary modifications.3 However, the success rates of\nmaintaining the reduced body weight are disappointingly\nlow and individuals make repeated attempts to control their\nweight.1 This phenomena of repeated attempts at weight loss\nusing dietary means has been described as `yo-yo dieting',\nand is thought to be linked to weight variability or weight\ncycling.4 \u00ad 6 The evidence linking weight cycling to adverse\nhealth outcome, metabolic changes and risk of subsequent\nmajor weight gain has been the subject of several recent\nstudies and reviews.4 \u00ad 9\nDespite the interest in this issue, little is known about the\nreported dietary practices and nutritional health of indivi-\nduals making repeated attempts to lose weight. Some studies\nhave examined nutrient adequacy of diets reported by indi-\nviduals trying to lose weight.10 To the author's knowledge,\nhowever, nutritional status of those making repeated\nattempts to lose weight has not been differentiated in these\nstudies. One may hypothesize that with repeated attempts at\nenergy restriction, intake and status of some nutrients may\nbe compromised.

The MEC exam included a physical and dental exam,\ndietary interview, body measurements, and collection of\nblood and urine samples. Body weight, height, and circum-\nference at various body sites were measured using standar-\ndized procedures in the MEC.11 The MEC examination\nresponse rate (weighted) was 73%.\nHistory of trying to lose weight\nDuring the household interview, respondents were asked,\n`During the past 12 months, have you tried to lose weight?',\nand at the MEC exam respondents were asked, `Are you\ncurrently trying to lose weight?' By combining responses to\nthese questions, following categories of history of attempt-\ning weight loss were created: (1) yes, currently trying and yes,\ntried in the last 12 months (Y=Y); (2) yes, currently trying but\nnot tried in the last 12 months (Y=N), (3) no, currently trying\nand yes, tried in the last 12 months (N=Y); and (4) no,\ncurrently trying and no, tried in the last 12 months (N=N).\nDietary assessment method\nA 24 h dietary recall was collected by a trained dietary\ninterviewer in an MEC interview using an automated, micro-\ncomputer-based interview and coding system.11 The type\nand amount of foods consumed were recalled using recall\naids such as abstract food models, special charts, measuring\ncups and rulers to help in quantifying the amounts\nconsumed. Special probes were used to help the recall of\ncommonly forgotten items such as condiments, accompani-\nments, fast foods and alcoholic beverages, etc.\nAnalytic sample\nAll adults aged 20 y and over were eligible for inclusion\n(n \u00bc 17 030) in this study. A complete and reliable dietary\nrecall (as determined by NCHS) was not available for 1051\nrespondents, leaving 15 979 eligible for inclusion. We further\nexcluded respondents stating that food intake on recalled\nday was `much less' or `much more' than usual (n \u00bc 2245),\nwomen who were pregnant (n \u00bc 282) or nursing (n \u00bc 91),\nthose missing information on body weight (n \u00bc 33) or\nheight (n \u00bc 16), and those missing information on whether\ncurrently trying to lose weight or whether they had tried to\nlose weight in the past 12 months (n \u00bc 308). The final\ndents were in more than one exclusion category.\nAssessment of intake of low-nutrient-dense foods\nBecause of the prevailing hypothesis about misreporting of\nnutritional undesirables in relation to body weight, and\ntrying to lose weight, we were especially interested in exam-\nining the intake of low-nutrient-dense foods. To determine\nthe intake of low-nutrient-dense foods, it was necessary to\nidentify foods belonging to this category from those reported\nreported by adult survey respondents were classified as\nbelonging to one or more of the five major food groups\n(dairy, fruit, grain, meat and vegetable) or the low-nutrient-\ndense foods group using methods we have described pre-\nviously.12,13 Briefly, the assignment of foods into the various\ngroups was dependent on their nutrient content and uses in\nthe diet. The dairy group included milk, yogurt, cheese and\nbutter milk but excluded butter, cream cheese and dairy\ndesserts. The fruit group included all fresh, frozen, dried\nand canned fruit and fruit juices but excluded fruit drinks.\nThe grain group included all breads, cereals, pastas and rice,\nbut excluded pastries. The meat group included meat, poul-\ntry, fish, eggs and meat alternates such as dried beans, nuts\nand seeds. The vegetable group included all raw or cooked\nfresh, frozen, and canned vegetables and juices. Mixed dishes\ncontaining foods from several groups were grouped into all\nthe relevant groups. Foods excluded from these major food\ngroups were grouped into the low-nutrient-dense foods\ngroup. The low-nutrient-dense foods were further placed\ninto five subgroups as follows: (1) visible fat -- butter, oil,\ndressings and gravies, etc.; (2) sweeteners -- sugar, syrup,\ncandy, carbonated and non-carbonated sweetened drinks,\netc.; (3) baked and dairy desserts -- cookies, cakes, pies,\npastries, ice cream, puddings and cheese cakes, etc.; (4)\nsalted snacks -- potato, corn and tortilla chips, etc., and\nlastly; (5) miscellaneous -- coffee, tea, condiments, spices,\netc.\nThe NHANES III nutrient database for individual foods,\nwhich is derived from the US Department of Agriculture's\nSurvey Nutrient Data base,14 was used for determining\nenergy and nutrient content of all foods. The nutrients\nexamined included: vitamins A, E, B6\n, folate and C,\nand the minerals iron and calcium. The intake of each\nnutrient was compared to the respective age \u00ad sex-specific\nstandard available. The standards used were 1989 Recom-\nDietary reporting and weight-loss attempts\nAK Kant\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nmended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for protein, and Dietary\nReference Intakes (DRIs) for vitamins A, E, C, B6\n, folate,\nand the minerals iron and calcium.15 \u00ad 19\nAs an estimate of dietary misreporting, a ratio of reported\nenergy intake (EI) to energy expenditure for basal needs\n(BEE) was computed. BEE was estimated using age-sex-\nweight specific equations according to Schofield.20\nData on serum vitamin C, folate, carotenoids and lipids\nwere obtained from the NCHS public release compact\ndisc.21,22 The methods used for measurement of these\nserum analytes and their associated errors have been\ndescribed.21,22 Serum folate, ascorbate and the carote-\nnoids -- a-carotene, b-carotene, b-cryptoxanthin, lutein=\nzeaxanthin and lycopene -- were chosen because the dietary\nintake of these nutrients are believed to be major determi-\nnants of serum concentrations of the respective nutrient and\ncan thus serve as biomarkers of dietary exposure.17,18 Serum\nlipids are known to be adversely affected by body mass index\n(BMI),23 and weight loss is usually recommended to improve\nthe serum lipid profile, hence we wished to examine their\nrelationship with history of attempted weight loss.\nStatistical analyses\nThe mean daily energy, percentage energy from macronu-\ntrients, percentage energy from low-nutrient-dense foods\ngroups (separately and combined), mean percentage of the\npopulation meeting the RDA or DRI of selected nutrients,\nmean serum concentration of selected vitamers and analytes,\nadjusted for multiple covariates, were obtained by categories\nof history of trying to lose weight variable, separately for\nmen and women. All covariates for inclusion in the various\nmultiple regression models were decided a priori based on\nknown relationships of trying to lose weight related variables\nwith dietary, sociodemographic, lifestyle and biological vari-\nables.

The procedure used for\nobtaining covariate-adjusted estimates and standard errors\nfrom survey data is based on Taylor Linearization methods\naccording to Graubard and Korn.24 All statistical analyses\nwere performed using SAS,25 and software designed for\nanalysis of survey data (SUDAAN).26 This software generates\nvariance estimates that are corrected for multi-stage stratified\nprobability design of complex surveys. Sample weights pro-\nvided by the NCHS to correct for differential probabilities of\nselection, non-coverage and non-response were used in all\nanalyses to obtain point estimates.11\nThe independent association of history of trying to lose\nweight with food and nutrient intake, and serum analyte\nconcentration was examined using regression procedures to\nadjust for multiple covariates mentioned above. Linear\nregression procedures were used when the outcome variables\nwere continuous (eg dietary nutrient intake or serum nutri-\nent concentration). For categorical outcomes such as\nwhether or not the standard of a nutrient intake was met,\nwe used logistic regression procedures. In these regression\nmodels, history of trying to lose weight was entered as a\ncategorical variable with the N=N as the reference category.\nResults\nSociodemographic profile\nTable 1 presents the sociodemographic profile of respondents\nby categories of history of trying to lose weight questions.\nMore of those in the Y=Y category were women, non-Hispa-\nnic white, and had > 12 y education.

Despite these\ndifferences in energy intake, the magnitude of differences in\nthe macronutrient distribution of energy intake among the\nvarious history of weight loss categories were small. Percen-\ntage energy from dietary fat in repeaters did not differ from\nthe N=N group, thus providing little support for the notion\nthat repeat dieters may show increased preference for dietary\nfat.27 The reported intakes of energy and percentage energy\nfrom fat by all history of weight loss groups were markedly\nhigher than those estimated from a food frequency ques-\ntionnaire for men and women considered to be successful at\nMen in the Y=Y group reported lower energy density for\nall foods and beverages, smaller amount of all foods and\nbeverages, as well as a lower percentage of energy from all\nlow-nutrient-dense foods and the low-nutrient-dense sub-\ngroups -- desserts and sweeteners. Similar trends were noted\nin women, but reached statistical significance only for\nreported energy density of foods. These observations are in\nthe expected direction for dietary strategies recommended\nfor decreasing energy intake. Increased physical activity is\nalso a recommended adjunct to achieving weight loss.23 A\nslightly higher proportion of those in the Y=Y category\nreported recreational physical activity. However, it should\nbe noted that both energy intake and physical activity are\nsubject to reporting bias (see discussion below).\nIn men, although mean energy intake in all history of\nweight loss categories was lower, the odds of meeting the\nstandard of intake of key micronutrients were not adversely\naffected; men repeat attempters were more likely to report\nconsuming all five food groups and consequently a higher\nnutrient density for most examined micronutrients. Others\nhave also found diets of those trying to lose weight to be\ngenerally adequate in micronutrients.10 Accordingly, serum\nvitamin and carotenoid concentrations in men repeating\nattempts at weight loss were generally higher relative to\nthe N=N group. Although women repeat attempters had\nlower odds of meeting the folate and vitamin E standards,\nthe serum concentrations of folate and vitamin E were not\nlower in these women. Similarly, cardiovascular risk biomar-\nkers examined (serum total and LDL cholesterol, and homo-\ncysteine concentrations) were not higher in repeat\nattempters.\nOverall gender differences in the study results are note-\nworthy. Generally, men making repeat attempts at weight\nloss reported more nutrient-dense diets than women,\nwhereas, in women, the dietary patterns reported by the\nY=N group were better relative to other weight loss groups.\nThis conclusion is also supported by the biochemical data --\nRBC folate, serum ascorbate, vitamin E, and all carotenoid\n(except lycopene) concentrations were higher in men in the\nY=Y group relative to the N=N group; in women, the highest\nmean serum concentration of nutrients was more often\nassociated with the Y=N group.\nSome limitations of this cross-sectional study should be\nconsidered in interpreting the results. At least some over-\nweight individuals may have responded affirmatively to\ntrying to lose weight at the time of the survey and in the\npast because of the social desirability bias. Thus overweight\nsubjects may be more likely to be misclassified into history of\ntrying to lose weight categories. The result of this misclassi-\nfication will be to attenuate the magnitude of differences\namong history of trying to lose weight groups. Some indivi-\nduals may not have used dietary modification while trying to\nlose weight, but are nonetheless grouped into trying to lose\nweight categories, also resulting in the attenuation of differ-\nences among groups. We note, however, that recent survey\ndata suggests that nearly 90% of those trying to lose weight\nmodified their diet.4 No information on the strategies\nemployed for achieving weight loss, as well as the duration\nor the efficacy of these attempts was available, thus limiting\nthe applicability of results of this study. No adjustments were\nmade for multiple comparisons made in this study, it may\nthus be preferable to pay attention to the magnitude of\ndifferences among groups rather than P-values.\nAll methods of dietary assessment including the 24 h\nrecall used in this study are prone to a number of measure-\nment errors.30 These measurement errors may contribute to\nan attenuation of significant associations between dietary\nexposure and outcomes such as biomarkers. It is noteworthy\nthat in this study dietary intakes of vitamin C, folate,\nvitamin E and carotenoids related positively with serum\nconcentrations of the respective nutrients, thus validating\ndietary data. The 24 h recall method is generally considered\nunsuitable for describing nutrient intakes of individuals, but\nis useful for describing intakes of groups.30 Therefore, in this\nstudy, the conclusions about nutrient intake are described as\ndifferences among history of weight loss categories. Never-\ntheless, dietary measurement errors are possibly present and\nmay have contributed to the inability to find significant\ndifferences among groups.\nDietary misreporting is one of the major sources of mea-\nsurement errors.30 \u00ad 32 BMI and dieting history are believed to\nbe negative correlates of dietary energy reporting.33,34 In this\nstudy, the EI=BEE ratio adjusted for BMI and other potential\ncorrelates was lower in all groups attempting weight loss.\nArguably, a lower EI=BEE ratio is consistent with attaining\nnegative energy balance in those attempting weight loss.\nHowever, to what extent the reported energy intake repre-\nsents actual intake cannot be ascertained without indepen-\ndent validation of food intake. Therefore, the possibility of\nunder-reporting of food intake in relation to reported history\nof trying to lose weight remains a consideration. Another\nrelated issue is whether those with history of weight loss are\nDietary reporting and weight-loss attempts\nAK Kant\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nmore likely to selectively under-report low-nutrient-density\nfoods. In this study, the reported proportion of energy from\nmany of the low-nutrient-density food groups was lower in\nsome history of weight loss categories in both men and\nwomen. It is impossible to discern from the present study\nwhether this represents differential under-reporting of such\nfoods by those trying to lose weight or actual intake. Given\nthe bias in reporting of dietary intake, the examination of\nbiomarkers in relation to history of weight loss attempts is a\nstrength of the present study.\nIn conclusion, the results provide little evidence for\nincreased nutritional risk in those reporting repeat\nattempts at weight loss. Conversely, higher serum concen-\ntration of key vitamins and carotenoids in those making\nrepeat weight loss attempts suggests improved nutritional\nprofiles. There is a need for evaluation of biomarkers and\nrepeated assessment of diet from prospective studies focusing\non weight cycling.\n"
