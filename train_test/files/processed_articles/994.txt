Little information is available on the general prevalence of POF or\non the prevalence by ethnic group. There is also a lack of information on the association of POF with health indica-\ntors. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of women aged 40\u00b155 years was conducted at seven sites in the USA to\ndetermine eligibility for a community-based, multi-ethnic longitudinal study of the peri-menopause (The Study of\nWomen Across the Nation, SWAN). Interview data were used to (i) determine the prevalence of self-reported POF\noverall and by ethnic group, and (ii) assess the association of POF with selected self-reported variables related to\nhealth. Cases of POF included only women with no discernible cause for POF. RESULTS: POF was reported by\nJapanese women experienced POF. The differences in frequency across ethnic groups were statistically signi\u00aecant\n(P = 0.01). Only Caucasian, African American and Hispanic women were included in further analyses since too few\nAsian women had POF. In a multivariate model, POF was independently associated with osteoporosis, female hor-\nmone use (excluding oral contraceptives), higher body mass index (BMI) and current smoking after adjustment for\neducation level, ability to pay for basics, site and age at interview. In Caucasian women, use of female hormones,\nosteoporosis, severe disability and smoking were signi\u00aecantly associated with POF. In contrast, POF in African\nAmerican women was associated with higher BMI and female hormone use, but not osteoporosis. CONCLUSIONS:\nThe prevalence of POF appears to vary by ethnicity. Health factors associated with POF also vary by ethnicity but\nbecause of the cross-sectional study design, it is not possible to determine cause and effect relationships. Health risks\nof POF would bene\u00aet from further study.\nKey words: ethnic/health risk/population/premature menopause/premature ovarian failure\nIntroduction\nPremature menopause, also termed premature ovarian failure\n(POF), is a disorder characterized by cessation of menstruation\nbefore the age of 40 years. POF has been studied primarily in\nselected clinic populations, and rarely in community or\npopulation-based studies of women. Based on elevated FSH\nbefore the age of 40 years, Coulam et al. estimated that 0.9% of\nwomen will experience POF (Coulam et al., 1986). Likewise,\nin a population-based study of early ovarian failure, the\nThus, only a few prior studies estimated the prevalence of POF.\nFurthermore, little information exists on the prevalence of POF\nin different ethnic groups.\nThe aetiology of POF other than that due to known causes\nsuch as surgical intervention (hysterectomy or oophorectomy)\nor chemical or radiation therapy is not well de\u00aened (Hoek et al.,\nbeen proposed to explain the occurrence of POF of unknown\ncause. Based on evidence of anti-ovarian antibodies and\ndefective antigen processing by immune cells, 50\u00b170% of POF\nwas associated with an autoimmune disease of the ovary\nwith the reported association of POF with other autoimmune\ndiseases (Hoek et al., 1997). Genetic defects such as chromo-\nsome deletions or translocations, a breakpoint in the human\n*The \u00aendings of this report were presented in part at the Fourth\nInternational Symposium, Women's Health and Menopause, Washington,\n\u00e3 European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology 199\nDIA gene, association with fragile X syndrome (Bondy et al.,\nbeen detected in some women with POF. These observations\nsuggest that POF may be the consequence of processes that\ndiffer from those leading to natural menopause around the\nexpected age of 50 years.\nIn addition, POF is associated with a more prolonged low\nestrogen state than would be observed with natural menopause\nMcKinlay, 1996). Consequently, POF, coupled with an\nincreasing lifespan, is potentially associated with both more\nsevere and different health risks, than natural menopause.\nEarly age at menopause has been reported to be associated\nwith increased risk of mortality (van der Schouw et al., 1996;\n2001), and osteoporosis (Kritz-Silverstein and Barrett-\nRelatively few of these studies speci\u00aecally assessed women\nwith POF. For example, although cardiovascular disease risk\nin women increases around menopause (van der Schouw et al.,\n1996), it was shown that the risk did not differ between women\nwith POF and those with menopause around age 51 years\n(Senoz et al., 1996). In contrast, bone density was lower in\nwomen with POF compared with menopausal women\ncycling women of similar age (Anasti et al., 1998). Additional\ninformation on potential health risks speci\u00aecally associated\nwith POF is needed.\nassess eligibility for enrolment into a multi-ethnic longitudinal\ncohort study of the perimenopause, and to collect health,\nreproductive, demographic and lifestyle data. The information\nfrom this survey provided a unique opportunity to (i) describe\nthe frequency of POF in the overall population, and in speci\u00aec\nethnic groups, and (ii) assess the association of selected\nmedical/biological and lifestyle factors with POF.\nMaterials and methods\nData were collected in a cross-sectional survey and used to\ndetermine eligibility for participation in the longitudinal Study of\nWomen's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a prospective,\nmulti-ethnic, multi-disciplinary study of the natural history of the\nmenopausal transition. The study included seven locations in the\nUSA: Boston (MA), Chicago (IL), Detroit area (MI), Los\nAngeles (CA), Newark (NJ), Pittsburgh (PA) and Oakland\n(CA). Eligibility criteria for the cross-sectional survey were:\nage 40\u00b155 years, self-designation as Caucasian or in the targeted\nracial/ethnic group for the site, residence in the geographical area\nde\u00aened by one of the seven study sites, use of English or one of\nthe other selected languages (Spanish, Japanese, Cantonese), and\nability to give verbal consent to participate.\nA common interview protocol was employed across the seven\nclinical sites, supported by a written manual of operations, common\ntraining, and standardization of research staff. Menopausal status was\nbased on self-report of menstrual characteristics. Menopause was\nde\u00aened as no menses for 12 months. Age and ethnicity were self-\nreported. Primary race/ethnicity was self-de\u00aened as Black or African\nAmerican, non-Hispanic Caucasian, Chinese, Japanese, or Hispanic\n(Central American, Cuban or Cuban American, Dominican, Mexican\nor Mexican American, Puerto Rican, South American, Spanish or\nother Hispanic). Respondents could also specify `other', `mixed', or\nno primary ethnic af\u00aeliation. Of the women that participated in the\nthe primary ethnic groups. The cross-sectional group included 7771\nCaucasian women at seven sites, 4393 African American women at\nat one site each.\nIn order to assess premature menopause, women whose menstrual\ncycles had stopped for known reasons were excluded from analysis.\nWomen who had a hysterectomy (n = 3030), ovariectomy (n = 83),\ncancer (n = 349), or who were currently pregnant (n = 31) or who\nstopped menstruating for medical reasons (n = 170), pregnancy or\nbreast-feeding (n = 29), or severe weight loss or other reason (n = 78)\nwere excluded from analysis. In addition, those with missing values\nfor the exclusion criteria (n = 127) or missing information on the year\nof cessation of menstrual cycles were excluded (n = 56). Of the\nwomen screened, 11 652 were included in further analyses. The study\nwomen who had stopped menstruating.\nThe use of age 40 years to de\u00aene POF is empirical. An alternative\nde\u00aenition of POF is based on a cut-off age that is 2 SD (2Q2.5 years)\nfrom the expected age of menopause at 50\u00b151 years, or age 45 years\n1997). However, cessation of menstruation before the age of 40 has\nbeen customarily used to de\u00aene premature menopause in research and\nclinical practice, and was used in this analysis (Hoek et al., 1997).\nFurthermore, women aged b40 years were surveyed and thus all\nwomen whose menstrual cycles ceased before the age of 40 years\ncould be identi\u00aeed. Women with POF were de\u00aened using the self-\nreported year that menses stopped and converting the year to the\nmidpoint date (July 1). The estimated date that menses stopped was\nconverted to the age that menses stopped by subtracting the date of\nbirth. Current age was calculated from the difference between the\ninterview date and the birth date. This variable was used to select\nwomen who stopped menstruating before the age of 40 years.\nStudy variables\nVariables reported in the literature as signi\u00aecantly related to health,\nphysiology, lifestyle, socioeconomic status, age at menopause or POF\nwere selected. Self-reported history of arthritis, diabetes, heart attack/\nangina, osteoporosis, ever use of oral contraceptives, use of hormones\nin the past 3 months, ever use of hormones, ever use of female\nhormones (excluding oral contraceptives), and ever had a live birth\nhad a `yes' or `no' response. Self-reported health had categories of\nexcellent, very good, good, fair and poor. Marital status was\ncategorized as married or living as married, or single (never\nmarried/separated/widowed/divorced). Education was categorized\nas high school or less, high school degree, some college, college\ndegree, or graduate studies. Income category was estimated from a\ngeneral question on how hard it was to pay for basics (very hard,\nsomewhat hard, not hard). Cigarette smoking was categorized as\nnever, former or current smoker. `Disability' was calculated from a\n10 part question on daily activity (strenuous sports, moderate sports\nor activity, ability to climb stairs, distance walked comfortably and\nbathing) and was categorized as limited, limited a little, not limited.\nBody mass index (BMI) was calculated from self-reported height\n(cm) and weight (kg) as weight (kg)/height (m)2.\nJ.L.Luborsky et al.\nAnalysis\nBased on the concept that the mechanism of the dependent variable,\nPOF, is different than menopause around age 50 years, POF was\ncompared with a `non-POF' group that included women with and\nwithout menses.\nThe prevalence of POF was calculated and the statistical\nsigni\u00aecance of differences determined by Pearson's c2-analysis or\nFisher's exact test when expected values were <5. The age at\nmenopause for each ethnic group was displayed using the\nKaplan\u00b1Meier procedure for estimating survival and hazard rates.\nAnalysis of variance was used to evaluate group means for continuous\nvariables. The selected variables of interest were treated as\nindependent variables to assess associations with POF. Important\nvariables were identi\u00aeed in unadjusted univariate analysis; those\nsigni\u00aecant at the P < 0.1 level by c2-analysis were included in\nmultivariate analyses. Logistic regression with multiple variables was\nused to consider the independent relationships of important covariates\nwith POF after adjusting for education and income category\n(socioeconomic status), site and age at survey. Site was included in\nall adjusted models since it was a characteristic of the sampling design\nof the study.\nResults\nPrevalence\nThe overall prevalence of POF was 1.1% (Table I).\nBy ethnicity, 1.0% of Caucasian, 1.4% of African American,\nwomen experienced POF (Table I). The relative difference in\nfrequency of POF across ethnic groups was statistically\nsigni\u00aecant (P = 0.01). POF was signi\u00aecantly more prevalent\nHispanic (P = 0.004) women than in Japanese women\n(Figure 1). The prevalence of POF was not signi\u00aecantly\ndifferent between Chinese and Japanese women (P = 0.2).\nTable I.

Japanese women tended to stop menstruating at later\nages.\nPOF in a multi-ethnic population study\nUnadjusted association of POF with selected medical/\nbiological and lifestyle variables\nBecause of the small numbers of Asian women with POF,\nfurther analysis was limited to Caucasian, African American\nand Hispanic women. Arthritis, diabetes, poorer self-reported\nhealth, higher BMI, osteoporosis, severe disability, use of\nfemale hormones (excluding oral contraceptives), single\nmarital status, lower education level, dif\u00aeculty paying for\nbasics, and smoking were each signi\u00aecantly associated with\nPOF in univariate analysis (Table II). In subset analyses, the\nsigni\u00aecance of variables differed for Caucasian, African\nAmerican and Hispanic women (Table II). The prevalence\nof POF by site also differed signi\u00aecantly, but did not differ for\nCaucasian or African American women in subset analyses and\nwas likely related to differences in ethnic composition by site.\nAfter adjustment for education and paying for basics, site and\nethnicity were no longer signi\u00aecant.\nThe mean (T SD) BMI was signi\u00aecantly higher for women\nAfrican American women with and without POF (P = 0.03),\nbut did not differ for Caucasian (P = 0.1, non-signi\u00aecant) or\nHispanic women (P = 0.7, non-signi\u00aecant) with and without\nCurrent smoking was associated with POF (Table II).

For\nexample, a similar proportion of African American (29.1%)\nwomen were current smokers (P = 0.0001), although the\nprevalence of POF was similar among Hispanic, African\nAmerican and Caucasian women.\nAt interview, the average age of women with POF was\nsigni\u00aecantly different from non-POF women with and without\n0.0001). The average age of women with POF also varied\namong ethnic groups at interview. Age may have an impact on\nmedical/biological variables. Therefore, an adjustment for age\nat interview was made in multivariate analyses.\nMultivariate models\nVariables in univariate analysis with a P-value < 0.10 were\nentered into multi-variate models. For women with POF\ncompared with women without POF in a multivariate logistic\nregression model, self-reported history of osteoporosis, use of\nfemale hormones (excluding oral contraceptives), higher BMI\nand current smoking were associated with POF, after adjust-\nment for site, socioeconomic status and age at interview\n(Table III).\nThe models differed for Caucasian and African American\nwomen (Hispanic women were not analysed due to the small\nnumbers of affected women) (Table III). For Caucasian\nwomen, osteoporosis, female hormone use (excluding oral\ncontraceptives), severe disability and current smoking were\nassociated with POF after adjustment for site, age and\nsocioeconomic status. For African American women, female\nhormone use and higher BMI were associated with POF after\nadjustment for site, age and socioeconomic status.\nDiscussion\nPrevalence\nThis is the \u00aerst assessment of the prevalence of POF in a single,\nmulti-ethnic study. We observed that 1.1% of women in our\nsample experienced POF before the age of 40 years. This result\nagrees with two previous reports that 0.9% of women under age\nwomen stopped menstruation before the age of 40 years\nenced an early menopause before age 45 years. This agrees\nstudy of Caucasian women in the USA and 3.3% in the current\ngeneration of French women (Cassou et al., 1997).\nFurthermore, our data showed that the prevalence of POF\nvaries by ethnicity from 0.1 to 1.4% among Caucasian, African\nAmerican, Hispanic, Chinese and Japanese women. In this\nstudy, signi\u00aecantly fewer Japanese women experienced POF.\nThis is consistent with another report from SWAN that\nmenopause occurred signi\u00aecantly later in Japanese women\n(Gold et al., 2001). This is also consistent with the report that\nthe slope of the age of menstrual cycle cessation increases\nsharply around the age of 50 years with a smaller skew toward\nyounger ages for Japanese women (Kono et al., 1990).\nThe age of menopause, and the accompanying loss of\nfunctional follicles (Faddy et al., 1992), may be in\u00afuenced by\ngenetic determinants (de Bruin et al., 2001), and modi\u00aeed 1\u00b12\nyears from the average by various lifestyle and environmental\net al., 1997). Interestingly, the distribution of age at which\nmenses cease is skewed with a long left tail. Using mathemat-\nical curve \u00aetting, the distribution of age at menopause in\nFinnish women was resolved into three curves with mean\nof the study population respectively (Luoto et al., 1994). This is\nconsistent with the possibility that different processes are\ninvolved in ovarian failure, or that selected processes\ndifferentially accelerate ovarian ageing in some women.\nDemographic/lifestyle associations\nThe variables selected for examination in this study were\nreported in the literature as signi\u00aecantly associated with POF.\nIn univariate analysis, dif\u00aeculty paying for basics, lower\neducational level attained, single marital status, and smoking\nwere signi\u00aecantly associated with POF in agreement with\nearlier reports.

Although low parity was related to earlier natural\nmenopause in other reports (Luoto et al., 1994; Torgerson\n2001), it was not speci\u00aecally associated with POF in this\nstudy. Lower socioeconomic status is also associated with a\nyounger age at natural menopause (Luoto et al., 1994; Cramer\ntwo variables were used as indicators of socioeconomic status,\ndif\u00aeculty paying for basics and educational level attained.\nBoth variables were associated with POF consistent with\nprevious studies of an earlier natural menopause in women of\nlow socioeconomic status (Luoto et al., 1994; Torgerson et al.,\nSmoking has been suggested as a signi\u00aecant risk factor for\nearly natural menopause (Willett et al., 1983; Cooper et al.,\nCaucasian women. In this study, smoking was not uniformly\nassociated with POF among ethnic groups. The prevalence of\nPOF was similar for Caucasian and Hispanic women and\nHispanic women smoke less than Caucasian women. One\nexplanation for the lack of association of smoking and POF for\nHispanic women may be that smoking was assessed at\ninterview rather than prior to POF. Alternately, ethnic\ndifferences in nicotine metabolism and pharmacogenetics\net al., 2002) may account for differences in the association of\nPOF and smoking among ethnic groups.\nHealth associations\nIn unadjusted univariate analysis, arthritis, higher mean BMI,\ndiabetes, osteoporosis, disability, poorer self-rated health and\nfemale hormone use (excluding oral contraceptives) were\nassociated with POF. After adjustment for socioeconomic\nstatus, age at interview and site, only osteoporosis, higher\nBMI, female hormone use, and disability remained associated\nwith POF, depending on the ethnic group.\nIn this analysis, a self-reported history of osteoporosis was\nthe most signi\u00aecant health factor associated with POF overall.\nAn association between earlier age at menopause and lower\nbone density, as well as increased risk for osteoporosis, has\nbeen reported (Kritz-Silverstein and Barrett-Connor, 1993;\nOhta et al., 1996). POF is also associated with increased risk\nInterestingly, in subset analyses, osteoporosis was associated\nwith POF in Caucasian and Hispanic women but not African\nAmerican women. The incidence of osteoporosis is lower in\nAfrican American women and it was suggested that this is due\nto a higher bone mass with lower initial rates of bone loss in\nit is not clear if this is the basis for a lack of association of\nosteoporosis with POF in African American women.\nRelatively little information is available on the relationship\nof physical disabilities to POF. Osteoporosis is associated with\ndisability (Kenny and Prestwood, 2000). In multivariate\nanalysis, severe disability was more likely to be associated\nwith POF in Caucasian and not African American women,\nsimilar to the association of osteoporosis with POF.\nHormone use (excluding oral contraceptives) was associ-\nated with POF. Because of the cross-sectional design, we\ncannot distinguish hormone use as a risk factor, from use as a\ntherapy, for POF. Hormones may include gonadotrophins and\nsteroids in infertility treatment or hormone replacement for\novarian failure. Ethnic differences in hormone replacement\ntherapy prescription and use may vary from location and\nmedical practice structure (Jahnige and Fiebach, 1997; Brown\net al., 1999). However, recent hormone use (hormone use in\nthe past 3 months) was not associated with POF. This suggests\nthat the association of female hormone use (excluding oral\ncontraceptives) with POF may not solely represent estrogen\nreplacement therapy, or it may re\u00afect an initial use of hormone\nreplacement therapy followed by its discontinued use.\nIn multivariate models, higher BMI was associated with\nPOF. Since this analysis considered weight at interview, it\ndoes not re\u00afect weight at the time of ovarian failure. Further,\nbecause the study was cross-sectional, it is not possible to\ndetermine if BMI was the same at the time of POF or if it\nchanged since the onset of POF. In some other studies, higher\nmean BMI was related to later age at menopause (Leidy, 1996;\nall studies (Gold et al., 2001). In another report from SWAN,\nBMI was associated with ethnicity and physical activity and to\na lesser extent, menopausal status and age (Matthews et al.,\n2001). A variety of factors may in\u00afuence BMI such as\nethnicity, race, socioeconomic status and genetics (Wagner\nand Heyward, 2000). The association of BMI with POF\nrequires longitudinal investigation in order to determine the\ninterpretation and signi\u00aecance of the observation.\nPOF is associated with autoimmune diseases such as\ndiabetes type 1 (Dorman et al., 2001), Addison's disease\n(Winqvist et al., 1995), polyendocrine autoimmunity\ntype 1 diabetes experienced menopause ~6\u00b18 years earlier\nthan their non-diabetic sisters or unrelated controls (Dorman\net al., 2001). However, diabetes type 2 does not appear to be\nassociated with POF (Lopez-Lopez et al., 1999). Data on\ndiabetes were collected in this survey, but the type of diabetes\nwas not identi\u00aeed. Diabetes approached signi\u00aecance in\nunivariate but not in multivariate analyses in this study. An\nassociation with POF may not have been clearly detected in\nthis study since diabetes type 1 and 2 were not differentiated in\ndata collection.\nAn association between POF and cancer and cancer-related\nmortality has been reported (Cramer et al., 1983; Cooper and\nSandler, 1998). However, women with a history of cancer\nwere excluded in this analysis in order to eliminate chemo-\ntherapy or radiation treatment as a basis for ovarian failure\nJ.L.Luborsky et al.\nPOF was not associated with a history of cardiovascular\ndisease. In a previous report from SWAN, heart disease was\nassociated with earlier age at natural menopause (Gold et al.,\n2001). However, this apparent difference is consistent with\nprevious studies in which different conclusions were obtained\ndepending on whether POF was identi\u00aeed as a speci\u00aec study\ngroup (Senoz et al., 1996) or if POF was not speci\u00aecally\nidenti\u00aeed in a group of menopausal women (van der Schouw\net al., 1996). The latter study reported the association between\ncardiovascular disease, and earlier age at menopause occurred\nearly in the menopause transition but the risk declined with age\nsince menopause (van der Schouw et al., 1996). Thus, another\npossible interpretation of the result in this study is that the risk\nhas already declined in women with POF.\nObviously, in a cross-sectional study design there are\nlimitations in the type of information that can be obtained\nand in the interpretation of `associations'. The study group\nrepresents a `window' in time of women aged 40\u00b155 years.\nHealth risks that may be expressed at later ages, such as\ncardiovascular disease, would not be identi\u00aeed. Also, the\ncause\u00b1effect relationship of POF and health or lifestyle factors\ncannot be discerned. For example, tobacco use is categorized at\nthe time of interview but information on the use of tobacco\nbefore POF occurred was not available in this study.\nIn summary, POF is not rare. The prevalence of POF varies\nby ethnicity. Health factors associated with POF, and variations\namong ethnic groups may differ from those of menopause\naround age 50 years and would bene\u00aet from further study.\n"
