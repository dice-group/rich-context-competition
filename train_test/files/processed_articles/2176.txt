Sampson, BA;\nAlan M. Zaslavsky, PhD; Kathleen Ries Merikangas, PhD\nContext: Estimates of DSM-IV disorder prevalence are\nhigh; stringent criteria to define need for services are de-\nsired.\nObjective: To present US national data on the preva-\nlence and sociodemographic correlates of 12-month se-\nrious emotional disturbance (SED), defined by the US Sub-\nstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,\nfrom the National Comorbidity Survey Replication Ado-\nlescent Supplement.\nDesign: The National Comorbidity Survey Replication\nAdolescent Supplement is a national survey of DSM-IV\nanxiety, mood, behavior, and substance disorders among\nUS adolescents.\nSetting: Dual-frame household and school samples of\nUS adolescents.\nParticipants: Total of 6483 pairs of adolescents aged\n13 to 17 (interviews) and parents (questionnaires).\nMain Outcome Measures: The DSM-IV disorders were\nassessed with the World Health Organization Compos-\nite International Diagnostic Interview and validated with\nblinded clinical interviews based on the Schedule for Af-\nfective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Chil-\ndren. Serious emotional disturbance was operational-\nized as a DSM-IV/Composite International Diagnostic\nInterview disorder with a score of 50 or less on the Chil-\ndren's Global Assessment Scale (ie, moderate impair-\nment in most areas of functioning or severe impairment\nin at least 1 area). Concordance of Composite Interna-\ntional Diagnostic Interview SED diagnoses with blinded\nSchedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for\nSchool-Age Children diagnoses was good.\nResults: The estimated prevalence of SED was 8.0%. Most\norders. Although respondents with 3 or more disorders\nComposite International Diagnostic Interview disor-\nders, they constituted 63.5% of SEDs. Predictive effects\nof high comorbidity were significantly greater than the\nproduct of their disorder-specific odds ratios and con-\nsistent across disorder types. Associations of sociodemo-\ngraphic variables with SED were generally nonsignifi-\ncant after controlling for disorder type and number.\nConclusions: The high estimated 12-month preva-\nlence of DSM-IV disorders among US adolescents is largely\ndue to mild cases. The significant between-disorder dif-\nferences in risk of SED and the significant effect of high\ncomorbidity have important public health implications\nfor targeting interventions.\nsistently find that more than\none-fourth of all US chil-\ndren and adolescents meet\ncriteria for 1 or more re-\ncent DSM-IV mental disorders.1,2 This pro-\nportion is so high that it raises questions\nabout the clinical significance of DSM-IV\ncriteria3 and about estimates of the mag-\nnitude of unmet need for treatment.4 Con-\nsistent with these questions, research has\nshown that, as with adults,5 prevalence es-\ntimates of child and adolescent mental dis-\norders decrease substantially when spe-\ncial impairment requirements are imposed\nin making diagnoses.6 Nonetheless, pre-\ncise data on the population severity dis-\ntributions of child and adolescent mental\ndisorders are lacking.\nThis report presents data on severity\ndistributions for DSM-IV mental disor-\nders among the adolescents who partici-\npated in the US National Comorbidity Sur-\nvey  \nAuthor Affiliations are listed at\nthe end of this article.\n\u00a92012 American Medical Association.

We distinguish DSM-IV disorders that\ndo vs do not qualify for the Substance Abuse and Mental\nHealth Services Administration definition of serious emo-\ntional disturbance (SED),8 focusing on disorder-\nspecific distributions and sociodemographic correlates.\nPrevious research6,9 has estimated that 4% to 13% of US\nadolescents meet 12-month criteria for SED, although\nnone of the previous studies of SED was based on a na-\ntional sample using a fully structured diagnostic inter-\nview. Previous NCS-A reports described the sample de-\nsign,7,10 measurements,11 and validity of diagnostic\nassessments7,10-12 along with lifetime prevalence of DSM-IV\ndisorders.13 A companion article2 in this issue docu-\nments that the disorders assessed in the NCS-A are highly\nprevalent and persistent throughout adolescence.\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nThe companion article2 in this issue describes the sample in\ndetail. In brief, adolescents (aged 13-17) were interviewed from\nresponse rate) samples.7,10 The high percentage (72.0%) of non-\nparticipating initially selected schools in the school sample was\nreplaced with matched replacement schools that were shown\nin a methodologic study to yield prevalence data comparable\nwith those obtained in the household sample from students in\nnonparticipating schools.10 One parent-surrogate of each par-\nticipating adolescent was asked to complete a self-admin-\nistered questionnaire about the adolescent's developmental his-\ntory and mental health (82.5% conditional response rate in the\nhousehold and 83.7% in the school sample). This report fo-\ncuses on the 6483 adolescent-parent pairs with complete data.\nIncomplete parent data were taken into consideration by weight-\ning procedures discussed elsewhere.7,10\nParental written informed consent and adolescent assent were\nobtained before completing the surveys. Each respondent was\ngiven $50 for participation. The recruitment consent proce-\ndures were approved by the human subjects committees of both\nHarvard Medical School and the University of Michigan. Weights\nwere used for within-household probability of selection and de-\nviation from census population sociodemographic or geo-\ngraphic distributions, and the household and school samples\nwere then merged with adjustments for differential design ef-\nMEASURES\nDiagnostic Assessment\nAs described in more detail in the companion article,2 adoles-\ncents were administered the fully structured Composite Inter-\nnational Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)14 modified to simplify lan-\nguage and use examples relevant to adolescents.11 The 15 DSM-IV\ndisorders that were assessed included mood disorders, anxi-\nety disorders, behavior disorders, eating disorders, and sub-\nstance disorders. There were no other exclusionary diagnoses.\nThe DSM-IV distress and impairment criteria and organic ex-\nclusion rules were used in making diagnoses. Hierarchy rules\nwere used with the exceptions of oppositional-defiant disor-\nder with or without conduct disorder and substance abuse with\nor without dependence. Briefer parent questionnaires as-\nsessed disorders for which parent reports have previously been\nshown to play a large part in diagnosis: behavior disorders15\nand depression and dysthymia.16 As described in more detail\nin the companion article,2 an NCS-A clinical reappraisal study\ndocumented good concordance between diagnoses based on the\nCIDI and diagnoses based on blinded clinical reappraisal in-\nterviews.12 Parent and adolescent reports in the CIDI were com-\nbined at the symptom level using an \"or\" rule (except in the\ncase of attention-deficit disorder for which only parent re-\nports were used for evidence of low validity of adolescent re-\nports) because results showed that this optimized concor-\ndance with blinded clinical diagnoses.\nDisorder Severity\nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administra-\ntion defines SED as \"a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emo-\ntional disorder of sufficient duration to meet diagnostic crite-\nria specified within DSM-III-R,\" and \"that resulted in functional\nimpairment which substantially interferes with or limits the\nchild's role or functioning in family, school, or community ac-\ntivities.\"8(p29425) This definition was operationalized in the NCS-A\nclinical reappraisal study by defining respondents with 1 or more\n12-month DSM-IV Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizo-\nphrenia for School-Age Children disorders as serious (SED) cases\nif they scored 50 or less on the Children's Global Assessment\nScale (CGAS).17 A CGAS score of 50 or less can be obtained\neither by having moderate impairment in functioning in most\nareas of living (eg, fears and anxieties that lead to gross avoid-\nance behavior, episodes of aggression, or antisocial behavior)\nor severe impairment in at least 1 area (eg, suicidal preoccu-\npation and ruminations or frequent anxiety attacks). Respon-\ndents who were not classified as having an SED were classified\nas moderate cases if they had CGAS scores of 51 through 60\n(variable functioning, with sporadic difficulties in several but\nnot all areas of living) and mild cases otherwise.\nAlthough the CIDI adolescent survey and parent question-\nnaire included many measures of impairment, they could not\nbe used to construct CGAS scores directly because the latter\nare based on clinical ratings. However, we were able to use these\nsurvey measures to generate a close approximation of CGAS.\nThis was done using regression-based imputation, a standard\napproach for establishing individual-level estimates of miss-\ning data in large-scale surveys in which information on impor-\ntant variables is missing for some cases.18 In this approach, data\navailable in the survey that are known from some other data\nset (in this case, the NCS-A clinical reappraisal sample) to pre-\ndict the missing variable are used to generate a prediction equa-\ntion for that variable in the other data set. The coefficients from\nthat prediction equation are then used in the main survey to\ngenerate predicted values of the missing variable. When the pre-\ndictors are strongly related to the missing variable, as was the\ncase in the NCS-A impairment variables predicting CGAS scores\nin the NCS-A clinical reappraisal sample, quite accurate indi-\nvidual-level measures of the missing variable can be generated\nin this way.\nCross-validated stepwise regression analysis performed in\nthe NCS-A clinical reappraisal sample using information about\n12-month DSM-IV disorder prevalence and severity was used\nto predict clinical ratings of SED. (Detailed results are avail-\nable on request from the corresponding author.) The area un-\nder the receiver operating characteristic curve, a measure of con-\ncordance that is fairly insensitive to prevalence,19 showed that\nthe estimate of SED based on the prediction equation had strong\nindividual-level concordance with clinical ratings in compari-\n\u00a92012 American Medical Association.

On the basis of these results, the coefficients in the pre-\ndiction equation were used to estimate whether each respondent\nin the larger NCS-A sample met criteria for serious, moderate,\nor mild 12-month disorder. These imputed scores were then\nused as outcomes in a series of logistic regression analyses per-\nformed in the total NCS-A sample to study the substantive pre-\ndictors of SED. To build in information about imputation in-\naccuracy to significance tests, the multiple imputation20 method\nwas used to adjust estimates of standard errors.\nSociodemographic\nVariables\nSociodemographic variables examined as predictors of SED in-\nclude age, sex, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, Hispanic, or other), parental educational level\n(less than high school, high school, some college, or college\ngraduate), family income (low [defined as no more than 1.5\ntimes the official federal poverty line], low-average [1.5-3 times\nthe poverty line], high-average [3-6 times the poverty line], or\nhigh [6 times the poverty line]), number of siblings, birth\norder, number of biological parents living with the adoles-\ncent, urbanicity (census metropolitan areas, nonmetropolitan\nurban counties, and rural counties), and census region (North-\neast, Midwest, South, or West).\nThe distribution of disorder severity was examined for each 12-\nmonth DSM-IV/CIDI disorder using cross-tabulations. Multi-\nvariate regression models were then used to predict log-odds\nof SED among respondents with disorders from information\nabout the type and number of disorders. This analysis was per-\nformed only in the subsample of respondents with a 12-\nmonth DSM-IV/CIDI disorder because the focus was on the pre-\ndictors of severity among respondents with disorders. Both\nadditive and nonadditive models were considered, and the best-\nfitting model was selected using the Bayesian information cri-\nterion.21 The regression coefficients and standard errors from\nthe best-fitting model were exponentiated to produce odds ra-\ntios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Population-attributable risk propor-\ntions (PARPs) were calculated to estimate the proportion of se-\nrious cases associated with each disorder that would not have\noccurred in the absence of a given predictor disorder or set of\ndisorders under the model if the regression coefficients repre-\nsented causal effects of the predictor disorders. The simula-\ntions were produced by generating a predicted probability of\neach value on the severity distribution twice for each respon-\ndent from the best-fitting model: the first time using all model\ncoefficients and the second time setting to zero the coeffi-\ncients associated with the predictor disorder(s) of interest. Popu-\nlation-attributable risk proportion was defined as 1-R, where\nR represents the ratio of the mean predicted probability in the\nsecond specification divided by the mean predicted probabil-\nity in the first specification. So, for example, if the mean pre-\ndicted probability decreases by 30% after deleting a given set\nof predictor disorders, PARP would be defined as 0.30.\nAs the NCS-A data are both clustered and weighted, the de-\nsign-based method of jackknife repeated replications based on\nthe 42 NCS-A sampling strata was used to produce standard\nerrors of logistic regression coefficients. The coefficients and\nstandard errors were exponentiated to produce ORs and 95%\nCIs. The significance of predictor sets was evaluated using Wald\nF tests based on design-adjusted coefficient variance-\ncovariance matrices. Statistical significance was consistently\nevaluated using 2-sided tests with an  level of .05.\nRESULTS\nThe estimated prevalence (SE) of 12-month SED is 8.0%\n(1.3%) among NCS-A respondents with complete ado-\nlescent-parent data.

See\nTable 2 in the companion article2 in this issue for information on 12-month prevalence of disorders. By independent sociodemographic variables we mean the\nsubset of sociodemographic variables that could not plausibly be caused by the respondent's SED. This was the best-fitting model from a wide variety of models\ncompared using the Bayesian information criterion as the measure of model fit. Model selection was not sensitive to the criterion used because other criteria\nexamined also selected this as the best-fitting model. The 14 disorder-specific ORs differ significantly among themselves (F13,29\nnumber-of-disorders coefficients are significant as a set (F3,39\n= 3.4; P = .03).

See the \"Analysis Methods\"\nsubsection in the \"Methods\" section for a description of the simulation method used to calculate PARP.

The dra-\nmatic increase in risk of SED among adolescents with 4\nor more disorders can be seen graphically by comparing\nthe observed distribution with the predicted probabili-\nties of this outcome among respondents with 1, 2, 3, and\n4 or more disorders in the additive and interactive mod-\nels.

That is, the multiplier of the 4-way interaction co-\nefficientovertheexpectedvaluebasedonanadditivemodel\nis relatively constant for all the 4-way interactions in the\ndata. Further exploratory analysis found no evidence of\ndifferential importance of particular disorders in the 292\ndistinct 4-way interactions observed among disorders in\nthe sample. (Detailed results are available on request.)\nCalculation of PARPs shows that much higher propor-\ntions of SED are due to behavior disorders (54.5%) than\ndisorders (Table 2). The PARP components across all dis-\norders sum to more than 100% because the calculation\nof PARP is made by deleting a single disorder at a time,\nwhich means that the effects of comorbidity are counted\nmultiple times. The disorders with the highest PARPs are\npositional-defiant disorder (15.6%), specific phobia\n(9.8%), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\n(8.4%). The high PARP for conduct disorder occurs de-\nspite a relatively low prevalence (5.4%) because of the\nhigh OR of conduct disorder predicting SED (18.4). The\nhigh PARP for depression, in comparison, is due to the\nconjunction of a high prevalence (13.3%) with a high OR\n(4.5). The lower, but nonetheless substantial, PARPs as-\nsociated with oppositional-defiant and attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorders are due to intermediate preva-\n3.1), whereas the high PARP associated with specific\nphobia is due to high prevalence (16.3%) in conjunc-\ntion with a modestly elevated OR (1.6). Eating disor-\nders are the only behavior disorders without signifi-\ncantly elevated ORs, raising the question whether eating\ndisorders should be thought of as behavior disorders.\nSociodemographic variables are significant overall pre-\ndictors of SED among respondents with 12-month dis-\nin the multivariate model are elevated among respon-\nwhose parents are high school graduates or had some\npost\u00adhigh school education (1.5-1.6 compared with col-\nlege graduates), and who live with neither or only 1 bio-\nlogical parent (5.2-1.9, respectively, compared with those\nliving with both parents). Serious emotional distur-\nbance is significantly less prevalent among non-\nHispanicblacks(0.6comparedwithnon-Hispanicwhites).\nNo other significant associations exist in the multivari-\nate model between any of the sociodemographic vari-\nables considered here and SED. Further analyses found\nthat bivariate associations do not differ markedly from\nthe multivariate associations reported here.

A related issue is whether these results im-\nply that only a small proportion of youths with a DSM-IV\ndisorder needs treatment. Again, this is an issue that goes\nbeyond the scope of this article. However, a case might\nbe made for the appropriateness of nonintensive treat-\nment for even the mildest of cases (eg, short-term be-\nhavioral treatment of specific phobias). Furthermore, mild\nadolescent disorders are powerful predictors of serious\nThe finding of a strong positive interaction involving\nhighcomorbidity(4disorders)predictingSEDisbroadly\nconsistent with evidence in previous studies that comor-\nbidity is associated with high severity.31-33 The existence\nof this interaction in conjunction with evidence from the\nNCS-A as well as other studies34-36 that a substantial pro-\nportion of adolescents have high comorbidity raises the\nquestion whether the parcellation of symptom clusters\ninto many different disorders in DSM-IV is correct. How-\never, this issue far exceeds the scope of this article. A more\ntractable issue is that the interaction has important im-\nplications for intervention targeting. In particular, if the\nprimary goal of intervention is to treat the bulk of youths\nwith current serious disorders, our results suggest that\nthe focus should be on disorders with the highest PARPs,\nwhich include a trio of 3 behavior disorders (conduct dis-\norder, oppositional-defiant disorder, and attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder) and depression, with a special em-\nphasis on multimorbidity37 (ie, 4 disorders). However,\nif cost-effectiveness is also an intervention goal, we have\nto consider that previous research has found treatment\neffectiveness to be lower among patients with certain,38\nalthough not all,39 comorbidities. The rational response\nto these complexities is far from obvious because we are\naware of no data to evaluate the relative effectiveness of\nintervening early with pure cases to prevent the onset of\ncomorbidity vs targeting cases that are already comor-\nbid as a focus of special attention. Some consideration\nof the timing and content of comorbidity is needed to op-\ntimize the value of outreach efforts from a public health\nperspective.\nWe found few sociodemographic correlates of SED\namong respondents with 12-month disorders. How-\never, in the earlier companion article in this issue2 we\ndocumented significant sociodemographic correlates of\n12-month prevalence of individual disorders consistent\nwith those found in previous studies. This means that\nsociodemographic variables, while systematically corre-\nlated with the presence vs absence of disorders, are for\nthe most part not systematically related to severity of dis-\norders among people with 12-month disorders. The stron-\ngest sociodemographic correlate of severity of 12-\nmonth disorders is not living with both biological parents.\nHowever, this association becomes nonsignificant when\nwe control for type and number of disorders, suggesting\nthat type and number of disorders mediate the associa-\ntion between living with biological parents and SED. Fur-\nther analysis (results available on request) showed that\nthe high prevalence of behavior disorders among ado-\nlescents not living with their biological parents explains\nthe gross predictive effect of this sociodemographic vari-\nable. Race/ethnicity is the only sociodemographic vari-\nable that remained significantly related to severity after\ncontrolling for type of disorder, with non-Hispanic blacks\nhaving significantly lower odds of SED than non-\nHispanic whites with the same profile of disorders. This\nfinding might be thought of as inconsistent with the re-\nsults of the National Health Interview Survey, which re-\nported higher rates of SED among non-Hispanic black\nand Hispanic youths than non-Hispanic whites,40 but the\ncomparison is inappropriate because we focused in this\nreport on predicting severity among adolescents with dis-\norders rather than among all adolescents. The seeming\ninconsistency of our failure to find strong socioeco-\nnomic predictors of SED with previous studies26 can be\nunderstood in the same way, as the juxtaposition of these\nresults can be interpreted as meaning that the associa-\ntions of sociodemographic variables with SED are due to\nmore basic associations with specific disorders.
