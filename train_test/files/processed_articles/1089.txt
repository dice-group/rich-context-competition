Human\u00adelephant conflict (HEC) in Africa occurs wherever these two species co-\nincide, and poses serious challenges to wildlife managers, local communities and\nelephants alike. Mitigation requires a detailed understanding of underlying patterns\nand processes. Although temporal patterns of HEC are relatively predictable, spatial\nvariation has shown few universal trends, making it difficult to predict where conflict\nwill take place. While this may be due to unpredictability in male elephant foraging beha-\nviour (the male behaviour hypothesis) it may also be due to variations in the data\nresolution of earlier studies.\n2. This study tested the male behaviour and data resolution hypotheses using HEC data\nfrom a 1000-km2 unprotected elephant range adjacent to the Masai Mara National\nReserve in Kenya. HEC incidents were divided into crop raiding and human deaths or\ninjuries. Crop raiding was further subdivided into incidents involving only male ele-\nphants or family groups. A relatively fine-resolution, systematic, grid-based method\nwas used to assign the locations of conflict incidents, and spatial relations with under-\nlying variables were explored using correlation analysis and logistic regression.\n3. Crop raiding was clustered into distinct conflict zones. Both occurrence and intensity\ncould be predicted on the basis of the area under cultivation and, for male elephant\ngroups, proximity to major settlements. Conversely, incidents of elephant-induced\nhuman injury and death were less predictable but were correlated with proximity to\nroads.\n4. A grid-based geographical information system (GIS) with a 25-km2 resolution\nutilizing cost-effective data sources, combined with simple statistical tools, was capable\nof identifying spatial predictors of HEC. At finer resolutions spatial autocorrelation\ncompromised the analyses.\n5. Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that spatial correlates of HEC can\nbe identified, regardless of the sex of the elephants involved.

As a result, some are coming into increas-\ning conflict with people, and this is particularly true\nof large mammals. Large herbivores, such as the black\nrhinoceros Diceros bicornis L., and large carnivores bear\nmost of the cost of this conflict and are either critically\nendangered or declining rapidly (Woodroffe & Ginsberg\nelephant Loxodonta africana Blumenbach, also have\nconsiderable impact on people and are in the unusual\nCorrespondence: M.J.

Sitati et al.\n ,\n \nposition of being simultaneously an endangered species\n(IUCN 2000) and, in places, a pest species.\nHuman\u00adelephant conflict (HEC) may take many\nforms, from crop raiding and infrastructural damage,\nthough disturbance of normal activities such as travel\nto work and school, to injury or death of people and\nelephants (Hoare 2000). HEC occurs throughout the\nelephant range in Africa, both in forest ecosystems in\nwest and central Africa (Barnes 1996) and savanna eco-\nsystems in east and southern Africa (Thouless 1994;\nO'Connell-Rodwell et al. 2000). HEC is a problem that\nposes serious challenges to wildlife managers, local\ncommunities and elephants alike.\nThe issue of HEC has become increasingly signifi-\ncant as human populations have expanded and\nencroached upon elephant habitat (Dublin, McShane\nwhere people practice cultivation. Crop raiding is per-\nhaps the most common form of HEC. Although nei-\nther the only crop pest in Africa nor the most damaging\noverall, elephants may cause severe localized damage\nwithin affected areas and can destroy entire fields\nof crops (Barnes, Asika & Asamoah-Boateng 1995;\nTreves 1998). Moreover, elephants are also dangerous\nto people. As a result, elephants have a higher profile\nthan other wildlife species and are generally less easily\ntolerated(Naughton-Treves,Treves&Rose2000; Hoare\nIt is vital, therefore, to gain a thorough under-\nstanding of the problem in order to develop and direct\nmitigation strategies. Recent reviews of HEC (Hoare\nally takes place between dusk and dawn, and for crop\nraiding in particular is often strongly seasonal. Spatial\npatterns have been more difficult to identify. Conflict\nis generally highest in close proximity to protected\nareas that act as elephant refuges (Barnes, Asika &\nOsborne2001).However,fewsystematicstudiesof HEC\ndistribution have been conducted.\nOther pest species, including carnivores (Stahl et al.\n2002), have exhibited considerable spatial predict-\nability in their patterns of crop and livestock raiding,\nenabling appropriate management and mitigation\nmethods to be applied strategically. The most com-\nprehensive published study of HEC, however, failed to\nidentify any strong spatial correlates (Hoare 1999a).\nThis suggested that HEC was as much a feature of\nunpredictable behaviour by male elephants, respons-\nible for the majority of crop-raiding events in the study\narea in Zimbabwe, as of underlying spatial patterns.\nThis `male behaviour hypothesis' reflects the fact that\nmale elephants may be more willing to take risks for\nthe higher nutritional rewards of mature crops\nthan female elephants, as has been shown for Asian\nA similar study in Kenya identified spatial correlates\nrelated to human and elephant density. This was partly\nexplained because female-led family groups, which\nmay be more predictable than male elephants, were\nmore involved in crop raiding in this area (Smith &\nKasiki 1999). It was not possible, however, to separate\nincidents caused by male vs. female-led family groups\nin order to test this hypothesis. Moreover, the study was\nconducted at a finer spatial resolution than that of\nHoare (1999a). Both studies used local government\nadministrative boundaries to delineate areas to be used\nas data points in subsequent analyses, although those\nof Smith & Kasiki (1999) were significantly smaller\nindependent variables such as distance from roads,\nwater or protected area boundaries over large and\nirregular-shaped areas may obscure patterns that\nwould be evident using a more refined spatial delinea-\ntion of data points. Thus the identification of spatial\ncorrelates of HEC intensity in one study and not the\nother may be as much a result of differences in spatial\nresolution as of differences in the composition of ele-\nphant groups involved in HEC.\nThe aim of this study was to identify whether\nspatially explicit predictive models of HEC could be\nderived from field monitoring and other available data,\nregardless of the composition of the elephant groups\ninvolved. The study tested the alternate male behaviour\nand data resolution hypotheses for the apparent unpre-\ndictability of HEC in earlier studies. This was achieved\nby performing analyses at fine (1 \u00d7 1-km and 5 \u00d7 5-km)\nspatial resolutions and by separating crop-raiding incid-\nents involving all male groups from those involving\nfemale-led family groups. The resolution of the ana-\nlyses was further refined compared with earlier studies\nby conducting separate analyses on different forms of\nHEC (crop raiding vs. human deaths and injuries) that\nmay have different spatial patterns. The study tested a\nsimple grid-based geographical information system\n(GIS) and statistical analytical procedure not previ-\nously used in HEC research but with the potential for\nwidespread comparative application.\nMaterials and methods\nTransMara District lies in the south-west of Kenya\n35\u00b014E). The district was created out of the western\npart of Narok District in 1994 and encompasses the\nwestern portion of the world-famous Masai Mara\nNational Reserve (MMNR) (Fig. 1). It covers an area\nan unprotected area inhabited by people separated\nfrom the protected and uninhabited MMNR by a steep\nescarpment. Elevation outside of MMNR ranges from\nPredicting human\u00ad\nelephant conflict\n ,\n \nplateau separated from northern highlands by the\nMogor River and drainage system running north-east\nally and falls in a bimodal pattern from March to June\nand from November to December. There is a north\u00ad\nsouth gradient of high to low rainfall across the district\nThe natural vegetation is a mosaic of Afro-montane,\nsemi-deciduous and dry-deciduous forests and\nAcacia savanna woodlands (Kiyiapi, Ochieng-Obado &\nOtieno-Odek 1996). However, the northern, north-east\nand south-west areas of the district have high agri-\ncultural potential, and these areas have undergone\nsignificant transformation for cultivation, particularly\nof maize and sugar cane. The central area has lower\npotential and remains substantially forested, although\nit is increasingly affected by slash-and-burn cultivation\nand charcoal production. The 1999 census recorded\nticularly dense settlement in the north and west where\nthe traditional, pastoralist Maasai inhabitants have been\njoined by an influx of other agro-pastoral ethnic groups.\nLand tenure outside of MMNR is a mixture of private\n(18%) and communal (group ranch, 82%) ownership.\nElephants once ranged across most parts of Trans-\nMara District and beyond. As immigration, human\npopulation growth and land transformation have\nincreased around the borders of the district, elephants\nhave become excluded from these areas (cf. Hoare & du\nToit 1999). As a result, the elephant range outside of\nMMNR has gradually contracted to its present area of\napproximately 1000 km2 in the centre of the district\n(Fig. 1). This area supports a resident population of\nspatially segregated from the larger population living\nmainly within MMNR. It has lower rainfall, agricul-\ntural potential and human population density than\nother parts of the district but more intact forest.\nThe conflict between elephants and people over cul-\ntivatedcropsbeganwiththeimmigrationof non-Maasais\ninto TransMara in the 1920s, through land acquisition\nand intermarriage with resident Maasai, to exploit the\nfertile soils and high rainfall. As the cultivation intro-\nduced to the District by these immigrants increased, so\ntoodidcropraiding,whichhasbecomeaperennialproblem\nthroughout the 1990s. Equally, both humans and eleph-\nants have suffered injury and death as a result of their\ninteractions. This TransMara case study therefore rep-\nresents a model of a common situation across Africa\nwhere elephants and people co-exist in disharmony.\nData were collected on both crop-raiding incidents and\nhuman deaths and injuries from March 1999 to August\n2000. To establish a reliable and independent conflict\nFig. 1.

The study covered the whole of the unprotected elephant range.\nN. W. Sitati et al.\n ,\n \na team of 10 community members was selected and\ntrained to enumerate crop-raiding incidents. This cir-\ncumvents the problem of overexaggeration of reported\nconflictbyfarmersthemselves(Siex&Struhsaker1999).\nEach enumerator was stationed at a different location\nwithin the elephant range, to offer widespread coverage\nof the area. Any crop-raiding incident within an enu-\nmerator's area was visited for verification purposes and\nto record the location in Universal Transverse Mercator\n(UTM) coordinates using a Garmin GPS12 satellite\nnavigation unit (Garmin Corp., Ulathe, KA). Further\ndetails of the incident, such as elephant group size and\ncomposition (male groups vs. female-led family\ngroups; cf. Sukumar & Gadgil 1988) and time of incid-\nent, were recorded from complainants on a stand-\nardized reporting form (Hoare 1999b). Incidents of\nhuman death and injury were similarly recorded.\nHowever, due to the rarity of suchincidentsduringthe\nsurvey period, historic incidents from 1986 onwards\nwere also investigated. Details of such incidents were\nobtained from Kenya Wildlife Service occurrence\nbooks and through participatory rural appraisals\n(PRA)withlocalcommunities,andthesiteof eachincid-\nent was revisited to record its exact location. The\nUTM coordinates of each incident were imported\ninto the ArcView v.3\u00b72 GIS software package (ESRI\nInc., Redlands, CA) for manipulation prior to ana-\nlysis. Separate layers were created for crop raiding by\nmale elephants, crop raiding by family groups and\nhuman deaths and injuries.\nData for seven independent variables that might\ndetermine the spatial pattern of HEC by their effect on\nhuman density or elephant density and movement\npatterns were obtained from a variety of sources.\ntopographic sheets and satellite imagery were obtained\nfrom the Organization for German Technical Coopera-\ntion (GTZ) in Lolgorien, TransMara District.

Instead the analyses were confined to the area\nof known elephant range where elephants were present\nfor at least part of the year and within which all conflict\nTo facilitate data analysis, all variables were imported\nintoArcViewandsuperimposedontoa1-km2 gridcover-\ning the whole of the elephant range (a total of 966 grid\ncells). The area of each grid cell comprising forest\nor cultivation was calculated. The road, river and mar-\nket centre vector files, and forest polygons, were used to\nderive raster distance maps at 100-m resolution in\nArcView, and mean distance from each of these fea-\ntures was calculated for each 1-km2 grid cell. The DEM\nwas already at a resolution of 1 km2 and so did not need\nto be manipulated. Human population density was at a\ncoarser resolution and so each grid cell was assigned\nthe mean density of the sublocation in which it was\nlocated (or the mean of two sublocations where grid\ncells overlapped sublocation boundaries).\nAnalysis was carried out using SPSS v.9 (SPSS Inc.,\nChicago,IL)atthelevelof the1-km2 gridcell.Univariate\ncorrelations were conducted using Spearman's rank\ncorrelation (rs\nBecause the intensity of different types of HEC exhib-\nited highly skewed distributions among grid cells it was\nnot possible to use linear regression to identify multi-\nvariatecorrelates.Instead,eachtypeof HECwas binary\ncoded into presence and absence for each grid cell, and\nanalysis was undertaken using multiple stepwise logis-\ntic regression (cf. Manel, Williams & Ormerod 2001;\nTourenq et al. 2001), with entry and exit of variables\ndetermined by the Wald statistic with P-values of 0\u00b705\nand 0\u00b71, respectively. The relative contribution of vari-\nables to the model was estimated by the R statistic\n(Tourenq et al. 2001). Spearman's rank correlation was\nused to examine the relationship between predicted\nprobabilities of HEC occurrence from the logistic\nmodels and actual intensity of HEC in grid cells.\nWhen analysing spatial data there is a danger of\nnon-independence caused by spatial autocorrelation\n(Koenig 1999) whereby adjacent cells share similar\nvalues in the dependent variable. This effect can reduce\nthe degrees of freedom in the analysis and thus increase\nthechancesof typeIerrors(Legendre&Legendre1998),\nwhereby correlation coefficients appear more signi-\nficant than they actually are. We tested for spatial auto-\ncorrelation in the dependent variables by calculating\nMoran's I statistic (Cliff & Ord 1981) using the Crime-\nstats v1\u00b71 software package (N. Levine & Associates,\nAnnandale, VA). The significance of Moran's I was\nexamined using a Z-test. An autocovariate term was\nderived to model spatial autocorrelation explicitly\nwhere it occurred (Augustine, Mugglestone & Buckland\n1996). The term used was an inverse Euclidean dis-\ntance weighted mean of conflict presence in the eight\nsurrounding cells of each cell in the grid. This increases\nthe fit of logistic models where data are spatially auto-\ncorrelated and removes spurious variables from the\nanalyses. However, caution is still needed in the inter-\npretation of the significance of correlation coefficients\nwhere spatial autocorrelation occurs (Osborne, Alonso\n& Bryant 2001). For this reason, we also conducted the\nanalyses at a coarser (5 \u00d7 5-km grid) resolution at which\nspatial autocorrelation was less likely to be significant.\ngroups occurred in 51 cells and by family groups in 91\nPredicting human\u00ad\nelephant conflict\n ,\n \ncells, whilst human deaths and injuries were present in\n34 cells.

W. Sitati et al.\n ,\n \nDiscussion\nThis study is the first of its kind to compare the spatial\npatterns of different types of HEC. Furthermore, it is\nthe first to use a systematic, grid-based approach to\nanalyse spatial patterns. The occurrence of HEC and\nits intensity were correlated with a variety of under-\nlying spatial variables in TransMara District. The study\nidentified different correlates of crop raiding and\nhuman deaths and injuries. Moreover, it was possible\nto develop predictive models of crop raiding by both\nmale elephant groups and family groups, suggesting\nthat male elephants are no less predictable than females.\nThere are, however, some caveats to this conclusion.\nAlthough crop raiding by both male and family groups\nwas significantly correlated with the area of each grid\ncell under cultivation, that by male groups was also sig-\nnificantly correlated with proximity to towns. Since\nproximity to towns also reflects increasing human den-\nsity on a fine scale, crop raiding close to towns is more\nlikely to bring elephants into contact with people.\nThus, this relationship with crop raiding by male ele-\nphants, but not by family groups, would seem to indi-\ncate an increased propensity to take risks by male\nelephants (Sukumar & Gadgil 1988). This in turn is\nmore likely to lead to less predictability in male ele-\nphant behaviour. Indeed, although significant correla-\ntions were identified, those for male crop raiding were\nless strong than those for family groups, and the pre-\ndictiveperformanceof resultingspatialmodelswasless\naccurate for males. Although possibly due to differ-\nences in prevalence of male vs. family group raiding,\nthis might nevertheless suggest that all-male groups are\nindeed less predictable than female-led groups.\nIt may be the case that single males are even less\npredictable, so that an area with a higher proportion of\nsingle males involved in HEC (e.g. Hoare 1999a) may\nreveal few if any spatial correlates. However, results\nfrom elsewhere with a high proportion of single bull\nelephants involved in HEC do not support this (Smith\n& Kasiki 1999). It seems more likely that data resolu-\ntion, and not elephant group composition, is the key to\nidentifying spatial correlates of HEC.\nThe pattern of human deaths and injuries was less\npredictable than that of crop raiding. This is partly\nbecause such events were less frequent but may also be\ndue to the fact that underlying variables, including\nhuman and elephant population density and distri-\nbution, forest cover and road networks, may have\nchanged over the 15-year period for which data were\navailable. The correlation with proximity to the current\nroad network reflects the fact that such events usually\noccurred at night when people were travelling to or\nfrom home along main roads. They represent unfortu-\nnate spatial coincidences when elephants have ven-\ntured out of forest refuges and crossed roads just as\npeople were passing by. In around one-third of cases\nthe human victim had been drinking and was returning\nhome from a local bar. Despite the fact that no predic-\ntivemodelof theoccurrenceof humandeathsandinjur-\nies could be constructed, there is still a recognizable\nspatial pattern to the intensity of incidents. The fact\nthat this pattern was different to that of crop raiding\nimplies the need to ensure separation of these types of\nHEC in future analyses.\nAt the 1-km2 resolution crop raiding and, to a lesser\nextent, human deaths and injuries were spatially clus-\ntered. Such localized and persistent elephant crop\nraidinghasbeenwitnessedelsewhere(Bell1984; Damiba\nreflects clustering in the underlying variables such as\narea under cultivation and distance from roads. Part of\nit may reflect proximity to particularly dense elephant\nrefuges, from which they forage at night. Neither area\nof forest nor distance from forest margin predicted the\noccurrence or intensity of HEC in our study. However,\nthese may not be accurate indicators of daytime ele-\nphant refuges as elephant density data over the study\narea were not available so could not be included in the\nanalyses. Indeed, local communities reported particu-\nlarly high elephant densities in refuges close to three of\nthe major conflict areas. Clustering of crop-raiding\nFig. 5. The relationship between the intensity of human deaths and injuries and mean distance from roads in 25-km2 grid cells.\nPredicting human\u00ad\nelephant conflict\n ,\n \nincidents may also reflect the fact that elephants have\nlong memories (McComb et al. 2001) and often utilize\ntraditional movement routes (Low 2000) and thus may\nreturn to areas where they remember having success-\nfully raided in the past. The role of daytime refuges and\ncorridors in determining the distribution and intensity\nof HEC outside protected areas warrants further study.\nClustering notwithstanding, there were clear rela-\ntionships with underlying spatial variables that became\nmore apparent at the coarser-scale analyses. Although\nuseful for fine-scale mapping of HEC and identifica-\ntion of high conflict zones, data at the 1-km2 resolution\nexhibited too much noise and autocorrelation to iden-\ntify spatial correlates reliably. At the 25-km2 resolution,\nthe data were less clustered and so spatial correlates\ncould be identified with statistical confidence. More-\nover, those variables identified as important at this\nresolution were also those with the strongest correlation\ncoefficients at the 1-km2 resolution. This suggests that\na compromise in resolution on statistical grounds does\nnot affect the identification of underlying relationships\nand may improve clarity by reducing noise. Although\ncoarser than the 1-km2 resolution data, the 25-km2 res-\nolution data are still considerably finer overall than the\ngovernment administrative units used in previous ana-\nwas considerably coarser than in this study). It is also\nthe finest resolution available for some data sets, such\nas wildlife and livestock aerial counts (Ottichilo et al.\n2000), that may be incorporated into spatial analyses. It\nis therefore recommended that a 25-km2 grid is used to\ngenerate spatial units for HEC analysis. When com-\nbined with a suitable index of HEC intensity (Hoare\n1999a) such a grid would be a useful comparative map-\nping tool that could be applied to areas experiencing\nHEC throughout Africa.\nA grid-based approach to mapping, combined with\nrobust statistical models of HEC, could also be used to\npredict HEC intensity in other areas or under chang-\ning circumstances. Although logistic models simplify\nthe data into presence and absence, the correlations\nbetween predicted presence and actual intensity sug-\ngest that relative intensity can be inferred using logistic\nmodels. Moreover, the models developed in this study\nrelied solely on variables such as land cover and dis-\ntance from roads and settlements that can be easily and\ninexpensively derived from remotely sensed data, top-\nographic maps and simple ground-truthing. This is in\ncontrast to variables such as human and elephant den-\nsity that would require considerable time and resources\nto measure at such fine spatial scales. Such models\ncould easily be developed using the same variables at\nthe same fine scale resolution in other sites to enable a\nmore meaningful comparative assessment of factors\naffecting HEC across the continent than has been\npossible to date. Including some reference to locally\nrecognized daytime elephant refuges and traditional\nmovement routes may also increase the strength of\nthese analyses. When combined with a grid-based GIS,\nsuch models could be useful management tools both\nfor planning the deployment of mitigation methods and\nfor future land-use planning as any planned changes can\nbe incorporated into the models to assess vulnerability.\nFor example, although the risk of human death and\ninjury is small it can probably be reduced substantially\nwith the avoidance, at night, of walking in areas of high\nrisk, even along main roads. Crop raiding clearly\nincreases with increasing settlement and cultivation up\nto a threshold at which elephants are permanently\nMoreover, the existence of discrete crop-raiding zones\nmay simplify mitigation strategies by enabling meas-\nures to be focused on the `front line' of farms closest to\ntraditional, non-fatal methods has been used by com-\nmunities all over Africa to combat crop raiding. These\ninclude guarding, scaring elephants with light, noise\nAlthough not 100% effective and subject to habitu-\ncombination of such methods on the front-line farms\nmay be the most successful short-term approach to\nmitigating this most prevalent form of HEC. Equally,\nknowing where to target mitigation measures also\nallows for the strategic implementation of early warn-\ning systems that are critical to the success of HEC\nmitigation. Comprehensive field tests of the efficacy of\nsuch measures are vital to identify the most appropri-\nate combination.\nWherever people and elephants coincide, however,\nHEC will occur. Short-term mitigation can only\nreduce, and not eradicate, the problem (O'Connell-\nRodwell et al. 2000). In TransMara the areas of highest\nagricultural potential have already been settled exten-\nsively and transformed, and this historic elephant\nrange has been sacrificed. Settlement and cultivation\nare now encroaching on the remaining elephant range,\nresulting in further HEC. A longer-term solution to the\nproblem would be to avoid cultivation or extensive\nsettlement within the remaining elephant range. The\nMaasai occupants of the area, who still form the\nmajority, were not traditionally agriculturalist and\nsome communities have now begun to approach the\nissue of alternatives to cultivation to alleviate conflict.\nTourism is viewed as a significant untapped oppor-\ntunity outside of MMNR, within which a large existing\npotential client base resides. Elsewhere in Kenya,\ncommunities are developing small-scale tourism as a\nwildlife-compatiblelandusethatgeneratesdirecteconomic\nFor example, communities in Mwaluganje near Mom-\nbassa have abandoned cultivation and settlement in an\nelephant corridor between protected areas and, with\ntheassistanceof theKenyaWildlifeService,havedevel-\noped an elephant sanctuary that generates entrance fee\nrevenue from tourists. Communities in TransMara\nbear the costs of living with wildlife without receiving\nN. W. Sitati et al.\n ,\n \nmanyof thebenefitsfromtourisminMMNR(Walpole\n& Leader-Williams 2001). They are now beginning to\ntake it upon themselves to organize community asso-\nciations charged with exploring and developing alter-\nnatives to cultivation that conserve the remaining\nforest whilst generating benefits from both forest and\nwildlife. Generating direct tourism benefits from ele-\nphants in a low-density, forested area may be difficult in\nthe absence of trophy hunting, which is not permitted\nin Kenya but which can offer considerable benefits to\noffset the costs of co-existence (Taylor 1993; Leader-\nWilliams, Smith & Walpole 2001). However, any altern-\native to cultivation, such as broader wildlife-based\nand cultural tourism, will alleviate HEC and render co-\nexistence all the more tolerable.\n"
