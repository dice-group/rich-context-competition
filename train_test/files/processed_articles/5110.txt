    "abstract": "Abstract\nSocial media and text messaging show promise as public health interventions, but little evaluation of implementation exists. The\nB'more Healthy Communities for Kids (BHCK) was a multilevel, multicomponent (wholesalers, food stores, recreation centers)\nchildhood obesity prevention trial that included social media and text-messaging components. The BHCK was implemented in 28\nlow-income areas of Baltimore City, Maryland, in 2 waves. The texting intervention targeted 241 low-income African American\ncaregivers (of 283), who received 3 texts/week reinforcing key messages, providing nutrition information, and weekly goals.\nRegular posting on social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) targeted community members and local stakeholders.\nHigh implementation standards were set a priori (57 for social media, 11 for texting), with low implementation defined as <50%,\nmedium as 50% to 99%, high as 100% of the high standard for each measure. Reach, dose delivered, and fidelity were assessed\nvia web-based analytic tools. Between waves, social media implementation improved from low-moderate to high reach, dose\ndelivered, and fidelity. Text messaging increased from moderate to high in reach and dose delivered, fidelity decreased from\nhigh to moderate. Data were used to monitor and revise the BHCK intervention throughout implementation. Our model for\nevaluating text messaging\u00adbased and social media\u00adbased interventions may be applicable to other settings.\n",

This paper addresses these gaps by describ-\ning the process evaluation of the text messaging and social\nmedia components of the B'more Healthy Communities\nfor Kids (BHCK) intervention.17\nMethods\nIntervention Overview\nThe BHCK was a childhood obesity prevention, group-\nrandomized trial implemented in 2 waves.17 In each wave,\n14 zones were selected upon meeting study's eligibility\ncriteria: low-income, predominantly African American\n(>50%) neighborhood with a recreation center at least 0.5\nmiles from a supermarket. Neighborhoods were random-\nized to be an intervention or comparison zone (n = 28 total\nzones). Different zones were used for waves 1 and 2.\nWithin each zone, an evaluation sample of African\nAmerican caregivers, defined as any adult (>18 years old)\nresponsible for taking care of a 10- to 14-year-old child,\nwas actively recruited at community sites (eg, recreation\ncenters, corner stores, carryout restaurants, parks). The first\nwave of BHCK intervention was implemented from June\nand 133 caregivers in wave 1 and wave 2, respectively. The\nBHCK intervened on different components of the Baltimore\nfood environment (corner stores, carryout restaurants,\nwholesaler, and recreation centers) and at different socio-\necological levels (policy, small food stores, afterschool\nprogram, and informational environment--social media\nand text messaging).\nPrior to intervention, three focus groups with youth, ages\n10 to 14 years, and their adult caregivers were conducted in\npredominantly African American communities in Baltimore\n(n = 20). Most participants used at least one of the following\nsocial media sites: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Tumblr,\nwith Facebook being most popular. Participants were open to\ncommunicating and receiving BHCK updates through social\nmedia and texts, and provided feedback on the types of mes-\nsages they preferred to receive.\nBased on the formative research, we chose Facebook,\nInstagram, Twitter, and text messaging to reach caregivers\nand connect and reinforce various BHCK intervention\ncomponents. Content delivered on these platforms paral-\nleled the 3 phases delivered in other intervention levels:\nsmart drinks, smart snacks, and smart cooking. Intervention\nwas guided by social cognitive theory, with goal-setting\nmessages and bidirectional interactions to enhance self-\nefficacy and reinforce positive health behaviors to encour-\nage behavioral change.18 Sharing recipes and individual\nstories of success on our social media accounts and text-\nmessaging campaign promoted observational learning.\nReplying encouraging messages to BHCK participants\nwho texted us with questions or responses to our chal-\nlenge-of-the-week text messages also promoted behavioral\nreinforcement. The BHCK interventionists also sought to\nimprove self-efficacy with supportive posts that helped\npeople to identify where healthier choices were available\nin their food environment, especially when promoted\nhealthy food and drink items were stocked and on sale in\nthe corner stores and carryout restaurants that were coop-\nerating with BHCK.\nThe Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health\nthis research; written informed consent was obtained from\nall adult participants.\nSocial Media and Text-Messaging Recruitment\nWave 1 recruitment for social media and text messaging\nstarted 1 month before overall BHCK intervention in June\n2014 to build initial follower base. All eligible caregivers\nin the intervention evaluation arm (n = 150) were invited\nto join via email, phone, and letter using contact informa-\ntion gathered at their baseline interview.17 Participants\ncould choose between receiving 3 and 5 texts per week.\nThey joined the text-messaging program with a specific\nkeyword and were invited to follow BHCK social media\npages.\nLoh et al 3\nWave 2 recruitment of caregivers in the evaluation inter-\nvention sample (n = 133) took place during the baseline\ninterview (April-November 2015). Those who were not\ninvited or initially declined invitation were called afterward\nabout enrolling in the program. Based on wave 1 partici-\npants'preference for 3 texts per week, all wave 2 participants\nwere texted 3 texts per week at off-peak hours.\nTo involve the community, social media handles were\nprinted on all wave 2 posters and handouts distributed at\nstores and recreation centers, and on cooperating carryout\nmenus. Participants in the intervention evaluation arm were\nactively invited to follow the pages through email, mail,\ntexts, and calls. Unlike text messaging, social media pages\nwere open to the public to reach a larger audience and poten-\ntial stakeholders.\nText-Messaging Intervention\nThe BHCK text-messaging intervention targeted adult care-\ngivers. Messages were drafted by BHCK interventionists,\nwho were undergraduate and graduate students trained in\nnutrition and public health, revised by the registered dieti-\ntians on the research team, approved by the primary investi-\ngator. The content was designed to encourage bidirectional\ncommunication and allowed for individual follow-up\n(Supplemental Table S1). Contact names were used to per-\nsonalize text messages. First text of the week was goal-ori-\nented, with the promoted task related to the unit concurrently\ntaught at the recreation center and corner stores. To encour-\nage response from participants, a yes or no question was typi-\ncally sent at the end of the week, asking whether they\nachieved the weekly challenge. Other message content\nincluded information to support goal attainment, nutrition\ninformation, recipes for promoted food items, and their cost\nand availability at corner stores (Supplemental Table S1).\nEnrolled participants could opt-out at any point.\nTextIt (https://textit.in) was used in wave 1, because it\nallowed scheduling of message flows, with automated\nresponses to preset questions. Due to issues with message\ndelivery and scheduling inflexibility, BHCK switched to EZ\nTexting (https://app.eztexting.com) during wave 2. The\nBHCK also used MobileVip (http://mobilevip.me), a custom-\nmade texting platform that allowed scheduling of automated\nresponses to preset questions and improved successful text\nmessage delivery.\nSocial Media Intervention\nSocial media, namely Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter,\nbroadened BHCK by targeting the whole Baltimore commu-\nnity. Content promoted other program components, includ-\ning BHCK posters and handouts, photos from recreation\ncenters and corner store interventions, the youth leaders\n(local college students trained to deliver the BHCK after-\nschool program), and cooperating wholesalers and corner\nstoreowners. The BHCK social media also shared Baltimore-\nspecific news and community events to engage the\ncommunity.\nFacebook. It allowed for longer and more frequent posts than\ntext messaging and the other social media platforms (ie, Ins-\ntagram and Twitter) and use of links, photos and videos, cre-\nating a more comprehensive communication platform to\nreach study sample and other members within and beyond\nBaltimore. The wave 1 Facebook page was maintained for\nwave 2 to retain initial follower base. Using a set weekly\nposting schedule (Supplemental Table S2), interventionists\nposted at least once a day in the evening, which was when\nmost of BHCK's followers were online based on Facebook\nAnalytics, to optimize post engagement.\nInstagram. During wave 1, users were less engaged with the\n\"BHCK1\" Instagram page than our Facebook Page, such that\nthe Instagram page had much fewer followers and likes and\ncomments per post. A new account with a catchier title of\n\"Bmore4kids\" was hence created for wave 2. Before wave 2\nimplementation, preintervention posting about general nutri-\ntion and networking (via liking, following, and commenting)\nwith users within the target community helped create a sub-\nstantial follower base (n = 1443) with the aim of giving cre-\ndence to the account as a reliable source for nutrition advice\nand community news. The BHCK interventionists posted\naccording to a weekly posting schedule (Supplemental Table\nS3) with 1 to 2 posts per day, as posting on average 1.5 times\nper day was found to be best practice.19 All Instagram posts\nwere generally linked to and posted on Facebook. The BHCK\nhad weekly Instagram challenges that corresponded to that\nweek's text-messaging goal, and large giveaway challenges\nper phase to increase participation. Large giveaway chal-\nlenges were different to the weekly challenges in that they\nare larger scale, with the competition open for entry for lon-\nger than a week and involved gift incentives, such that all\nBaltimore residents who participated in the giveaway would\nbe entered into a random drawing for a prize.\nTwitter. In wave 1, Twitter was used to connect with caregiv-\ners and shared similar content to Facebook and Instagram.\nHowever, we found poor engagement, as local caregivers\nwere not active Twitter users. The BHCK team learned Bal-\ntimore policy makers and organizations were more active on\nTwitter, so a new Twitter page, \"Bmore4kids,\" was created\nfor wave 2. It focused on connecting with agencies that had\nan interest in changing the food environment and supple-\nmented the BHCK policy component.\nBoosting and use of hashtags. To increase reach, BHCK paid\nto \"boost\" 1 to 2 posts per week on Facebook near the end of\nwave 1 and on all social media platforms during wave 2.\n\"Boosted\" posts display content to a broader preselected\naudience: adults ages 18 to 65 in Baltimore City. The BHCK\ninterventionists also boosted its overall Facebook page and\ntracked both paid and organic, meaning via unpaid distribu-\ntion, average reach (ie, number of people who saw any activ-\nity from the page) per month. Hashtags are prevalently used\non social media, especially Twitter and Instagram, to catego-\nrize and help users find content. Ten BHCK hashtags were\ncreated with 2 hashtags per phase based on the 3 phase slo-\ngans used on BHCK communication materials (eg, #Refresh-\nBHCK #SnackSmartBHCK) (Supplemental Table S4).\nDefinitions of Key Process Indicators\nPrior to intervention, process evaluation standards were cre-\nated to track implementation quality and make improve-\nments during the program. Multiple reach, dose delivered,\nand fidelity indicators were initially developed based on pre-\nvious intervention experience,20 and applied to each social\nmedia platform and text messaging, reviewed and refined as\nneeded during BHCK team meetings (bimonthly). Reach\nwas defined as the number of followers and impressions, ie,\nthe number of times the page or post was displayed, or per-\ncentage of families in the evaluation sample enrolled in the\ntext-messaging program. Dose delivered accounted for the\nnumber of BHCK posts on social media platforms and text\nmessages sent. Fidelity was the effectiveness of the text-\nmessaging and social media components, and measured indi-\nrectly through level of engagement that the page, posts, and\ntexts generated (eg, likes, comments, replies), and follower\nretention rate.\nProcess Evaluation Standards\nReach, dose delivered, and fidelity were measured by 20 pre-\nset standards in wave 1 and an expanded set of 68 standards\nin wave 2 (Supplemental Tables S5-S7). The BHCK set stan-\ndards based on current literature,13,21 and measurement data\navailable from social media analytical sites. Each standard\ncould be met at a low, medium, or high level, with high being\nthe goal to reflect optimum intervention delivery according\nto BHCK initial plans. Aiming to improve implementation\nfor wave 2, ranges for low, medium, and high were increased\n(ie, high ranges in wave 1 standards were set as moderate for\nwave 2). The BHCK also modified its social media standards\nbased on lessons learned and experience from wave 1. Due to\nthe different process evaluation standards used between\nwaves 1 and 2, this paper evaluates implementation of both\nwaves using wave 2 standards. Impact results for the BHCK\nintervention are presented elsewhere.22\nData Sources and Analysis\nTextIt (wave 1), EZ Texting, and MobileVip (wave 2) were\nonline platforms used to send messages and track process\ndata (ie, reach, dose, and fidelity). During wave 1, Facebook\nInsights, Instagram, and HootSuite were used to track\nfollower growth and posts on Facebook, Instagram, and\nTwitter, respectively. For wave 2, Iconosquare was used for\nInstagram and Twitter Analytics for Twitter. Data were mea-\nsured on a weekly and monthly basis and reported as an aver-\nage at the end of each phase.\nProcess data were derived from various program applica-\ntions and recorded in Microsoft Word and Excel 2011.\nProcess evaluation data for each platform were computed\nseparately. All dose, reach, and fidelity standards were calcu-\nlated as a percentage of the high standard met so that results\nwould be comparable with similar interventions. We defined\nabove of the high minimum standard, respectively. Standard\npercentages were averaged to calculate total reach, total dose\ndelivered, and total fidelity for a total wave 1 average across\nthe phases and an average for each of the 3 BHCK phases in\nwave 2 to track the progress of wave 2 implementation\nagainst wave 1.\nResults\nReach\nText messaging. Based on wave 2 standards, total reach of the\nwave 1 text-messaging program was moderate (Figure 1). Of\nthe entire intervention evaluation sample, 97% of all caregiv-\ners (n = 150) were successfully invited to join the BHCK\ntexting program through email, phone call, or letter, with 5\nparticipants unable to be reached due to invalid phone num-\nber, email, or home address. Seventy-two percent (n = 108)\nof the wave 1 caregivers enrolled. In wave 2, of 133 caregiv-\ners in the intervention group, 82% enrolled in the texting,\nreflecting high reach.\nSocial media. In wave 1, low to moderate reach was achieved\nfor new page likes (Facebook) or follower growth (Insta-\ngram, Twitter) per month (Table 1). Over the course of wave\n2, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter gained an average of\nrespectively, reflecting high reach. By intervention's end,\nInstagram built the largest follower base (n = 4317), fol-\nlowed by Facebook and Twitter (Supplemental Table S8).\nWave 2 overall reach for Facebook and Twitter was consis-\ntently high--an improvement over the total moderate reach\nfor both platforms during wave 1. Instagram improved from\nlow to moderate total reach, meeting 62% of high minimum\nstandard on average across the 3 phases as compared with\nDose Delivered\nText messaging.On average, wave 1 participants in the\n2-texts per week group received 2.3 texts per week, and\nparticipants in the 3-to-5 texts per week group received 3.1\ntexts per week. Moderate total dose delivered was achieved\nLoh et al 5\nin wave 1 (Figure 2), as goal-setting text messages were\nonly sent on 10 of 17 weeks. Wave 2 participants received\n4.5 texts per week and 1 goal-setting text weekly, achiev-\ning high total dose delivered. Use of MobileVip also\nimproved text delivery during wave 2, averaging 89.5%\nand 91.3% successfully delivered texts per week in phases\nweek were made on average to Facebook, Instagram, and\nduring wave 2. New social media dose standards were devel-\noped and met during wave 2 to assess delivery of different\npost types (ie, video, article discussion, youth leader feature)\nto ensure variety and improve engagement. Total dose deliv-\nered improved from moderate to high from wave 1 to 2\nacross all platforms (Figure 2).\nFidelity\nText messaging. Total fidelity for wave 1 text messaging was\nhigh (Figure 3). Participation retention rate was high, with\n87% of initially enrolled caregivers (n = 94) remaining for at\nleast 6 months (Supplemental Table S8). On average, 26.9%\nof participants responded when questions were prompted.\nWave 2 texting achieved moderate fidelity with an averaged\nilies (n = 105) stayed enrolled in the program for at least 6\nmonths, while 96.3% of families remained for at least 2\nmonths. This discrepancy is largely because many partici-\npants were interviewed and invited into the text-messaging\nprogram after overall start of intervention, so they were not\nyet enrolled for 6 months by intervention end. Opt-out rate\nSocial media. Fidelity was newly defined after wave 1 with\nnew wave 2 standards set to indirectly measure fidelity\nthrough engagement. Thus, no data were collected for these\nstandards in wave 1, and social media fidelity was not quan-\ntified. Fidelity in wave 2 was consistently high for Facebook,\nInstagram, and Twitter (Table 1). On average, Facebook\nper month. Instagram received 60.8 likes and 1.5 comments\nper post. Twitter received 34.2 page mentions per month and\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first community-based obesity\nprevention trial to include multiple social media platforms\nand text messaging as part of a multi-level, multi-component\nintervention, and to report on implementation quality.\nOverall, social media implementation improved from low-\nto-moderate to high reach, dose delivered, and fidelity\nbetween the 2 waves. Text-messaging implementation\nimproved to high reach and dose delivered.\nA novel component of this study was its measurement of\nfidelity. Fidelity is typically defined as quality of delivery--\nor a more refined version of dose delivered.23 We chose to\nassess fidelity indirectly, as engagement in the target popula-\ntion. We quantified engagement by number of likes, com-\nments, and shares associated with each post. This approach\nhas been used by others.13 Engagement has also been mea-\nsured in other ways, including post views21 and link clicks,10\nwhich we instead defined as reach. We deemed engagement\nas an action on the viewer's part and used it to assess fidelity,\nas social media and texting were created for social network-\ning. Although engagement assessed for BHCK social media\npages included individuals beyond our target audience (as\npages were open to the general public), an overall higher\nFigure 1. Social media and text-messaging intervention reach.\nNote. The data points were calculated by averaging the percentage of minimum high standard met for all reach standards. Implementation was considered\nlow for <50% of the high standard. Medium is 50% to 99% of the high standard, high is 100% or above of the high standard. For texting, 2 out of 2 of wave\n2 reach standards were analyzed for both wave 1 and wave 2. Based on wave 2 Facebook standards, 1 out of 6 reach standards were analyzed for wave 1;\nsix out of 6 reach standards for wave 2. Based on wave 2 Instagram standards, 1 out of 2 reach standards were analyzed for wave 1, and 2/2 for wave 2.\nFor Twitter, 1/6 wave 2 reach standards were analyzed for wave 1 and 6/6 for wave 2.\nTable 1.

Organic reach is the number of unique people who saw BHCK post through unpaid distribution, whereas paid reach is the total number of\npeople who saw BHCK post as a result of advertisements.25\nLoh et al 7\nengagement level would still reflect improvement in the inter-\nvention's fidelity.\nThe BHCK interventionists found that posting timely and\npersonalized content (ie, cultural-specific and community-\nspecific posts, individualized text responses) and encourag-\ning goal-setting and discussion were successful ways to\npromote each platform. These techniques were also shown to\nbe successful in previous mobile-based14,24 and social media\nBeyond boosting to increase reach, social networking was\nmost effective at increasing reach and gaining followers.\nThroughout wave 2, BHCK interventionists dedicated time\nto like and retweet from relevant Twitter accounts, and join\nTwitter chats. The BHCK also made \"shout-out\" posts for\nother accounts on Instagram and Facebook, to feature weekly\nchallenge winners and connect with other users. Dose deliv-\nered standards were set in wave 2 to track these activities.\nLinking social media pages also helped increase reach by\nspreading messages to a greater audience. The BHCK\nInstagram posts were always linked to Facebook and often to\nTwitter. The BHCK interventionists observed increases in\nlikes and comments on linked posts. However, effectiveness\nof different media types varies within platforms. For instance,\nhyperlinks cannot be shared on Instagram; Facebook follow-\ners were less likely to watch a video if a link was posted\ninstead of the video itself.\nA limitation found in this study and previous studies16\nwas that the quantifiable engagement with social media posts\nFigure 2. Social media and text-messaging intervention dose delivered.\nNote. The data points were calculated by averaging the percentage of minimum high standard met for all dose delivered standards. Low dose delivery was\ndefined as meeting <50% of high standard. Moderate dose delivered was 50% to 99%, and high dose delivered is 100%. For texting, 6 out of 7 wave 2\ndose delivered standards were analyzed for wave 1 and 7 out of 7 for wave 2. For Twitter, 2/5 wave 2 dose delivered standards were analyzed for wave 1\nFigure 3. Social media and text-messaging intervention fidelity.\nNote. The data points were calculated by averaging the percentage of minimum high standard met for all fidelity standards. Low fidelity was defined as\nmeeting <50% of high standard, 50% to 99% (moderate), and 100% high. For texting, 4/4 wave 2 fidelity standards were analyzed for both waves 1 and\n2. For all social media, no wave 2 fidelity standard was collected during wave 1. Six out of 6 wave 2 Twitter fidelity standards were collected for wave 2;\nnine out of nine for Instagram; five out of five for Facebook.\nand text messages was not always directly correlated with\nbehavioral change. Including specific measures for behavior\nchanges within intervention may help, such as asking users\nto post a photo of their home-cooked meal, which BHCK did\nas part of its large Instagram challenges.\nAnother challenge encountered was in assessing percent-\nage of the evaluation sample participating in BHCK social\nmedia sites due to individuals' privacy settings and use of\ndifferent usernames. To overcome this, BHCK tried to gauge\nengagement by using example posts in the dose received\n(\"exposure\") evaluation during post-intervention assessment\nwith study participants.\nThe BHCK texting response rate was low compared with\nanother study that received an average 68.5% response rate\nto self-monitoring text messages.13 Difference in response\nrates was likely due to the sample population age, as their\nparticipants were college students, who are probably more\nfamiliar with texting than BHCK's older caregiver sample\n(mean age = 41 years). However, like the study by Napolitano\net al, BHCK participants also reported positive feedback\nabout receiving health-related text messages.\nFinally, changes in standards between waves 1 and 2 pre-\nvented comparison between some process evaluation standards.\nHowever, new process evaluation measures were added based\non best practices and lessons learned in wave 1, and ultimately\nimproved evaluation and implementation during wave 2.\nConclusions\nThe BHCK showed that social media and text messaging\nwere innovative tools to include in and increase reach of a\nmultilevel community intervention. Valuable improvements\nin intervention implementation made in wave 2, based on\nlessons learned from wave 1, suggest the benefit of imple-\nmenting the program in 2 waves and conducting detailed\nprocess evaluation. The overall high level of reach and fidel-\nity achieved by end of intervention demonstrated the need\nfor consistent high dose delivery and community interest in\nusing social media and text messages to receive and engage\nwith health-related topics. This study shows the importance\nof understanding the target audience's usage of social media\n(ie, which platform(s), frequency, peak hours) to maximize\nengagement and successfully utilize it as an intervention\ntool. Recommended practices for managing social media\nsites include boosting, networking with other accounts, and\nposting varied and population-relevant content consistently.\nIn the text-messaging program, use of personalized texts,\ngoal-oriented messages, and yes-or-no prompt questions\nwere among the recommended strategies. This work furthers\nthe field by identifying features that increase engagement\nand retention of target audience and detailing an effective\nimplementation plan and process evaluation standards for\nsocial media and text messaging. Future researchers can\napply these practices in their own interventions to promote\nbehavior change and improve reach.\n"
