    "abstract": "Abstract\n\nM-PRESS-CreditRisk is a new top-down macro stress testing framework that can\nhelp supervisors gauge banks\u00e2 capital adequacy related to credit risk. For the \u010f\u0179rst\ntime, it combines calibration of microprudential capital requirements and macro-\nprudential bu\u010f\u0179ers in a uni\u010f\u0179ed, coherent framework.\nIts core element is an ad-\nvanced credit portfolio model \u00e2 SystemicCreditRisk \u00e2 built upon a rich, non-linear\ndependence structure for interconnected bank portfolios. Incorporating numerous\nsector/country-speci\u010f\u0179c systematic factors, the model focuses on credit default con-\ncentration risk as a major source of large losses that may have systemic impact. A\ntest run using a sample of 12 systemically important German banks provides mea-\nsures for systemic credit risk and the banks\u00e2 contributions to it in both baseline and\nstress scenarios. Capital requirements calibrated to the results combine elements of\nPillar 1 and Pillar 2, whereas macroprudential bu\u010f\u0179ers can internalize the system\u00e2s\ntail risk. The maximum model-based combined requirements range between 6.3%\nand 27.2% of credit RWA depending on the bank. A comparison with the reported\ncapital \u010f\u0179gures suggests that there appears to be enough capital in the banking sys-\ntem, but its distribution might be suboptimal from a systemic point of view as the\ncapital level of a number of banks might need improvement.\n\n",

New tools were introduced\nto address systemic risk, especially macroprudential capital bu\u010f\u0179ers. Stress testing, too,\ngained momentum, helping supervisors to gauge the potential impact of adverse devel-\nopments. This paper suggests a model \u00e2 M-PRESS-CreditRisk \u00e2 that aligns these two\naspects and presents a framework for setting capital requirements that takes systemic\ncredit risk into accounts.\n\nContribution\n\nM-PRESS-CreditRisk has two main advantages: First, it provides an advanced portfolio\nmodel for credit risk which captures extreme losses in the banking system that may\nmaterialize during crisis-like, systemic events (tail risk). Second, our framework brings\ntogether for the \u010f\u0179rst time di\u010f\u0179erent prudential instruments that address credit risk either\nat the bank level or system level, suggesting a coherent approach to their calibration. For\nthis purpose, the paper combines the portfolio model with a macroeconomic model which\ngenerates multi-risk-factor, multi-country stress scenarios.\n\nResults and Policy Application\n\nM-PRESS-CreditRisk provides estimates for the banks\u00e2 own funds needed to support\ncredit risk in the banking sector, including forward-looking loan loss provisioning, mini-\nmum capital requirements and capital bu\u010f\u0179ers that address systemic risk. In particular,\nit delivers a measure of systemic credit risk and banks\u00e2 individual contributions to it. We\nillustrate how the framework works using a sample of 12 systemically important German\nbanks. The results show that the actual capital levels and the capital needs calculated\nwith regard to systemic credit risk may di\u010f\u0179er considerably.\n\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\n\nFragestellung\n\nAls Lehre aus der globalen Finanzkrise entwickelten die Bankenaufseher neue Methoden\nzur Eind\u00c2\u00a8ammung der Risiken aus einem Versagen des Bankensystems.

The aim of the\ntraditional microprudential regulation is making sure that individual banks1 can support\ntheir standalone risk; this is achieved with minimum capital requirements. Complemen-\ntary to that, the macroprudential overlay targets resilience of the banking sector as a\nwhole by internalizing the risk of system-wide distress, using a toolkit of capital bu\u010f\u0179ers\nthat address systemic risk.2\n\nSystemic risk is generally de\u010f\u0179ned as the potential loss of economic value or con\u010f\u0179dence\nin a substantial portion of the \u010f\u0179nancial system, triggered by a low-probability event\nwhich might have signi\u010f\u0179cant adverse e\u010f\u0179ects on the real economy (Smaga, 2014; Deutsche\nIt can be described along two dimensions: time\nand cross section (Deutsche Bundesbank, 2011; Caruana, 2010). The time dimension of\nsystemic risk is re\u010f\u0179ected, for instance, in \u010f\u0179nancial market actors\u00e2 pro-cyclical behavior\nthat may exaggerate economic \u010f\u0179uctuations. The counter-cyclical capital bu\u010f\u0179er is the\nmacroprudential tool designed to address these risks (Detken, Weeken, Alessi, Bon\u010f\u0179m,\nBoucinha, Castro, Frontczak, Giordana, Giese, Jahn, Kakes, Klaus, Lang, Puzanova, and\nWelz, 2014). In the cross section, on the other hand, shocks may become systemic via\nmany channels of risk propagation such as correlated exposures, balance sheet contagion\nthrough asset devaluation and feedback e\u010f\u0179ects of asset \u010f\u0179re sales, direct contagion in an\ninterbank-network and funding risk due to runs by depositors and short-term wholesale\nlenders (Cont and Schaanning, 2016; Clerc, Giovannini, Lang\u010f\u0179eld, Peltonen, Portes, and\nScheicher, 2016; Gorton and Metrik, 2012). Macroprudential tools available in the EU\nthat address structural, non-cyclical systemic risks include the systemic risk bu\u010f\u0179er and\nthe bu\u010f\u0179er for other systemically important institutions (O-SII).3\n\nDespite considerable headway already made, the question about a speci\u010f\u0179c level of\ncapital that banks should have to su\u010f\u0179ciently cover systemic risk remains a subject of\nscienti\u010f\u0179c debate.4 Thus, not least for pragmatic reasons, supervisory macro stress testing\nbecame widely used as a tool for capital needs assessment under adverse macroeconomic\nscenarios. The supervisory stress tests can generally be conducted for micro- and macro-\nprudential purposes. For microprudential purposes, a set of scenarios is given to banks.\nThe banks use these scenarios for their institute-speci\u010f\u0179c calculations accomplished along\nstrict methodological guidance and provide the supervisor with the results. In the EU,\n\n1We use the word \u00e2bank\u00e2 as a generic term for both individual banks and banking groups.\n2BCBS (2011); Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV).\n3Articles 133 and 131(5) of the CRD IV, respectively. The latter represents the Union\u00e2s implementation\nof the Basel framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks (BCBS, 2012). SIIs are\nlarge and complex organizations whose failure might create major disruptions in the functioning of the\n\u010f\u0179nancial system (see also Freixas and Rochet, 2013).\n\n4A number of academics voice doubts about whether the Basel III reforms go far enough. Hellwig\nof their total assets. Furthermore, Admati, DeMarzo, Hellwig, and P\u010f\u0179eiderer (2013) argue that setting\ncapital requirements substantially above the currently existing levels bears more social bene\u010f\u0179ts than\nsocial costs. Dagher, Dell\u00e2Ariccia, Laeven, Ratnovski, and Tong (2016) estimate capital rates su\u010f\u0179cient\nto have withstood past banking crisis in a range between 15% and 23% of risk-weighted assets (RWA),\ndepending on the assumptions.\n\n\nthe European Banking Authority (EBA) has carried out these so called bottom-up stress\ntests since 2011 (EBA, 2016). The goal of such exercises is to primarily estimate capital\nneeds for single institutions.\n\nFor macroprudential purposes supervisors often develop their own models in order to\nrun so called top-down stress tests in a uni\u010f\u0179ed manner, i.e. independently of any possible\ndivergence in the banks\u00e2 internal models. For instance, the ECB, BoE, OeNB, and the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) have developed comprehensive\nstress testing frameworks.5 Common to these frameworks is initially that they incorporate\n\u010f\u0179rst-round e\u010f\u0179ects of macroeconomic shocks on the capital adequacy of individual banks.\nAdditionally, they incorporate second-round e\u010f\u0179ects such as contagion in the interbank\nnetwork and asset \u010f\u0179re sales, feedback e\u010f\u0179ects to the real economy, liquidity or funding risk,\nwhich is important from the macroprudential perspective. Therefore, macroprudential\nstress tests go beyond capital adequacy assessment from the point of view of an individual\ninstitution; their primary goal and the value added is to take into account the externalities\nof systemic risk to be able to judge about capital adequacy for the whole banking system.\nThe latter is also the angle of the growing strand of literature on top-down supervisory\nmacroprudential stress testing where our paper steps in. We argue, that large credit losses\nrepresent a major risk for a banking system. Hence, modeling portfolio credit risk should\nbe a key component of every stress testing framework. However, for reasons of simplicity,\nsome approaches do not capture the non-linear character of portfolio credit risk in a\nproper way nor do they incorporate an externality important from the macroprudential\npoint of view, namely the risk related to rare, extreme credit losses in the banking system,\nusually referred to as tail risk. For instance, both the BoE\u00e2s and the ECB\u00e2s stress testing\nframeworks as well as stress tests regularly conducted by the FRB focus on expected losses\nunder the macroeconomic stress scenarios but do not account for unexpected losses which\nare the main source of risk (Dees, Henry, and Martin, 2017; FRB, 2016; Hirtle and Lehnert,\nKapadia, Mora, and Puhr, 2009). Other authors \u00e2 Busch, Koziol, and Mitrovic (2015)\nand D\u00c2\u00a8ullmann and Kick (2014) \u00e2 go further and adopt a Merton-type portfolio model for\nsolvency stress testing. Yet, such models only account for linear correlation between the\nsystematic risk factors and are not designed to properly address the tail risk externality.\nThe closest to our model is Systemic Risk Monitor (SRM) of the OeNB (Boss, Krenn,\nPuhr, and Summer, 2006; Elsinger, Lehar, and Summer, 2006a). Pointing to the minor\nimportance of the linearized losses for assessing credit risk, SRM instead applies the\nCreditRisk+ model6 in order to obtain entire loan loss probability distributions. Using a\nlatent common economic shock, SRM introduces correlation between the banks\u00e2 portfolios,\nwhich provides a clue as to how a macroprudential approach to credit risk assessment in\na banking system may proceed.\n\nAt this juncture, our paper aims at improving the macroprudential supervisory stress\ntesting toolkit for modeling the \u010f\u0179rst-round e\u010f\u0179ects due to the credit risk. We concen-\n\n5Discussing the whole range of the existing approaches is beyond the scope of this paper. An overview\nof the current macro stress testing methodologies, practices and principles as well as related challenges\nmay be found in Dent, Westwood, and Segoviano (2016); Kapinos, Mitnik, and Martin (2017); Jobst,\n\n6CreditRisk+ is a reduced-form model for assessing portfolio credit risk thats introduced by Credit\n\n\n\ntrate on the channel of correlated credit exposures and develop a new, advanced port-\nfolio model: SystemicCreditRisk. To make it operational for supervisory needs, we em-\nbed the portfolio model into a top-down macro stress testing framework abbreviated as\nM-PRESS-CreditRisk, which refers to micro- and macroprudential requirements under\nsystemic stress with focus on credit risk.\n\nWe consider SystemicCreditRisk to be the major contribution of our paper. We tailor\nthis stochastic portfolio model to the supervisory needs of assessing the risk of potentially\nextreme system-wide credit losses (tail risk). Originating from correlated credit expo-\nsures, tail risk may materialize in an adverse, crisis-like macroeconomic scenario. This\nis captured by modeling systematic risk that simultaneously a\u010f\u0179ects borrower probabili-\nties of default (PDs) in a given industry sector and/or country. Additionally, borrowers\nfrom di\u010f\u0179erent sectors and countries are interconnected using a rich and heterogeneous\ndependence structure for the systematic part of credit risk that allows for non-linear de-\npendence. Importantly, this structure links the banks\u00e2 portfolios together and, in e\u010f\u0179ect,\naccounts for default concentration risk \u00e2 a major source of potentially large losses in a\nbanking system.\n\nThis allows us to go beyond a microprudential analysis for individual banks, also as-\nsessing risks from the systemic perspective. Thus, our second contribution consists in\ndeveloping a holistic micro- and macroprudential approach to capital adequacy assess-\nment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the \u010f\u0179rst paper that brings together both\naspects of prudential capital regulation: making sure that individual banks can support\ntheir standalone risk and making the banking sector as a whole more resilient by inter-\nnalizing the risk of system-wide distress. To accomplish this task, we suggest a coherent\napproach to inform the calibration of the respective capital instruments, including the\nsystemic risk bu\u010f\u0179er and the O-SII bu\u010f\u0179er.\n\nOur stress testing framework M-PRESS-CreditRisk combines an advanced portfolio\nmodel with other modules that generate and translate macroeconomic scenarios into bor-\nrower PDs and provide output that may serve policy purposes, as shown in Figure 1.1.\n\nThe \u010f\u0179rst building block generates relevant international macroeconomic stress sce-\nnarios that could a\u010f\u0179ect banks\u00e2 multinational credit exposure. For the purpose of this\npaper we apply NiGEM as a scenario-generating engine.7 The second building block rep-\nresents a satellite macro-econometric model that links these scenarios with a measure\nof the credit quality of bank portfolios represented by the ratio of non-performing loans\n(NPLs). In a \u010f\u0179rst step, we estimate the country-level relationship between macroeconomic\nvariables also obtained from NiGEM and the NPL rates obtained mostly from the Inter-\nnational Monetary Fund (IMF) database. In a second step, we apply this relationship in\norder to translate the macroeconomic scenarios into the future NPL ratio projections.\n\nThe stochastic portfolio model SystemicCreditRisk is the third and central\nbuilding block of our framework. It develops and estimates the joint probability distribu-\ntion (based on a \u00e2heavy-tailed\u00e2 copula) for the systematic part of credit risk common to\ndi\u010f\u0179erent sectors and/or countries. This distribution is constrained to a \u00e2stressed\u00e2 region\ndue to a link to the NPL ratio projections under the stress scenarios, which results in\nstressed borrower PDs. Using granular information about the banks\u00e2 credit exposures,\nthis block simulates probability distributions of portfolio losses for each individual bank\n\n7NiGEM is frequently used in central banks, but any other model that can deliver international\n\nmacroeconomic stress scenarios can be utilized here.\n\n\nFigure 1.1: M-PRESS-CreditRisk: Modeling framework\n\nand the entire system. The resulting portfolio loss distributions deliver all relevant credit\nrisk metrics, including measures of systemic credit risk and the banks contributions to it.\nThe fourth and last building block \u00e2 policy applications \u00e2 develops a novel coherent\napproach to capital adequacy assessment. In more detail, it shows how both micropruden-\ntial capital requirements of Pillar 1 and 2 and macroprudential bu\u010f\u0179ers can be calibrated\nto the respective risk metrics derived from the simulated portfolio loss distributions.\n\nTo test the new framework, we carry out an analysis for 12 systemically important\nGerman banks, using unique supervisory data of the German credit register as of 2013Q4.\nIn this illustrative study we concentrate on macroeconomic shocks to Greece, Italy, Portu-\ngal and Spain (GIPS) and, additionally, include a scenario that generates macroeconomic\nstress at the global level. We observe heterogenous results: The maximum model-based\ncombined capital requirements range between 6.3% and 27.2% of credit RWA depending\non the bank. On aggregate, it appears to be enough capital in the system to support the\nsystem\u00e2s tail risk, and a number of individual banks seem to be very well capitalized in\naccordance with the model. However, the other banks\u00e2 capital level seems to need im-\nprovement. These \u010f\u0179ndings suggest that the distribution of capital in the system might be\nsuboptimal from the macroprudential point of view (i.e. when the banks\u00e2 contributions to\nthe system-wide credit risk are taken into account). Moreover, our results and conclusions\nbased on them are robust to econometric approaches and estimation techniques (satellite\n\n\nSatellite Macro-Econometric Model Macroeconomic Stress Scenarios NPL ratios projections  Stochatic Portfolio ModelSystemicCreditRisk(Stressed) conditional PDs Credit portfolio loss simulation Policy applications Pillar 1 & Pillar 2 & macroprudential buffers Credit risk measures:system / individual banks model) and the choice of the time period (portfolio model).\n\nNeedless to say, our numerical results should be treated cautiously. First, while the\nresults of each model are subject to uncertainty, the linkage of the models may elevate\nthe overall degree of uncertainty (see Danielsson, James, Valenzuela, and Zer, 2016). Sec-\nond, our present assessment concentrates on the credit risk that arises from correlated\nexposures, not yet taking into account the systemic risk propagation via direct contagion\nand other channels mentioned above. Third, the microprudential capital requirements\nobtained in our framework and the regulatory requirements based on the banks\u00e2 inter-\nnal models are not directly comparable because of many di\u010f\u0179erences in the underlying\nassumptions.8\n\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our novel portfolio model.\nSection 3 describes the data sets used. Section 4 presents our stress test scenarios. Sec-\ntion 5 designs the satellite macro-econometric model and discusses estimation results.\nSection 6 focuses on the calibration of SystemicCreditRisk, the sampling procedure, and\nthe relevant risk metrics. Section 7 makes suggestions for calibration of capital tools.\nSection 8 concludes with a summary.\n\n2 SystemicCreditRisk\n\n2.1 Basic set-up of the portfolio model\n\nSystemicCreditRisk joins the ranks of default-only type of credit portfolio models, i.e. it\nonly considers a borrower\u00e2s default as a credit event.9 The target variable is the credit\nportfolio loss (PL). This is de\u010f\u0179ned as the sum of losses on exposures to N individual\nborrowers that comprise the portfolio and is calculated as\n\n\n\nP L =\n\nEADi \u00c2\u02c7 LGDi \u00c2\u02c7 Di.\n\n\nEAD represents the credit exposure at the moment of a borrower i\u00e2s default (i.e. exposure\nat default). LGD or loss given default is the percentage of the EAD that will be potentially\nlost in the event of the borrower\u00e2s default. D denotes the default indicator that equals\none if the borrower defaults and zero otherwise. D is a random, Bernoulli-distributed\nvariable. Its distribution is governed by one parameter set to the borrower\u00e2s probability\n\n8The Basel II formula for minimum capital requirements under the IRB approach is based on the\nassumption of a perfectly diversi\u010f\u0179ed credit portfolio and, thus, neglects credit concentration risk. This\napproach only accounts for one source of systematic risk in the portfolio and does not allow default\ncorrelations to be stronger in the downswing (tail dependence). Our model relaxes those assumptions\nand, therefore, leads to a more conservative estimation of portfolio credit risk (see Puzanova, 2011).\nAdditionally to the microprudential layer of requirements, our model accounts for correlation between\nbank portfolios and for the banks\u00e2 impact on the system-wide risk, which is not part of the stand-\nalone assessment of the individual banks\u00e2 risk under Basel II. We also assess credit risk in adverse\nmacroeconomic scenarios and, based on that, calibrate macroprudential capital bu\u010f\u0179ers, which were not\npart of the o\u010f\u0179cial capital requirements at the time of consideration.\n\nTM\n\n9Related benchmark models in the \u010f\u0179nancial industry include the Merton-type structural model of\nPortfolio Manager\nintroduced\nby Credit Swiss First Boston in 1997. Among the \u00e2mark-to-market\u00e2 models that additionally take into\naccount the borrowers\u00e2 credit rating migration, the well-known examples are CreditMetrics\n, published\nby McKinsey and Company, which followed in 1998.\nby J. P. Morgan in 1997, and CreditPortfolioView\n\nlaunched by KMV in 1993 and the reduced-from model CreditRisk+\n\nTM\n\nTM\n\nTM\n\n\nof default (PD). All variables mentioned refer, as is usual in this type of model, to a risk\nhorizon of one year into the future.\n\nWhen we consider the credit portfolio of an individual bank, the sum in Equation (2.1)\nruns over all borrowers of this bank. For the system\u00e2s portfolio, on the other hand, the\nsum is taken over the borrowers of all banks contained in the sample. If a \u010f\u0179rm i borrows\nfrom di\u010f\u0179erent banks, Di is the same for all these banks, but EADi and LGDi represent\nbank-speci\u010f\u0179c \u010f\u0179gures.\n\nD is the only random variable in Equation (2.1); EADs, LGDs and PDs are treated\nas \u010f\u0179xed values (calibrated in Section 6.1). Since Di are stochastic, so is PL. Thus, PL\nhas a probability distribution. This is determined by the joint probability distribution of\n{Di}i=1,...,N . Therefore, in order to approximate the probability distribution of PL using\nMonte Carlo sampling, we need to make assumptions about the stochastic structure that\ngoverns mutual dependencies among the default indicators. In this respect, there are es-\nsentially two approaches. One method ties default indicators to the underlying economic\nfactors that may lead to borrowers default, such as the obligors\u00e2 asset value (structural\nmodels). The other method speci\u010f\u0179es the dependence structure of default indicators di-\nrectly, not going into details on the economic reasons behind a default, such as negative\nequity when the asset value drops below the value of the borrower\u00e2s debt (reduced-form\nmodels). In this paper, we exploit the second method.

This is consistent with the hypothesis that joint default risk\nvaries with economic conditions, as investigated empirically by Das, Freed, Geng, and\n\nWe introduce one systematic factor for each group of borrowers, as described below.\nThis factor applies multiplicatively to the borrowers\u00e2 PDs and scales them up and down.\nMore formally, the stochastic probability of default of a borrower n in group m is a\nfunction of the \u010f\u0179xed PD as estimated by the lender and the group-speci\u010f\u0179c stochastic\nsystematic factor Sm.11 This is given as\n\nP Dmi(Sm) = P Dmi \u00c2\u02c7 Sm, with E[Sm] = 1, m = 1, . . . , M.\n\n\n10This assumption arises from the observed variability of actual default rate statistics over time. Con-\nsider, for instance, insolvency statistics by sector published by the German Federal Statistical O\u010f\u0179ce\n(a proxy for the rate of borrowers\u00e2 defaults): Whereas mean historical insolvency rates over the period\n1995\u00e22012 ranged in a sectoral cross section from 0.2 % for electricity, gas and water supply companies\nto 2.5 % for \u010f\u0179nancial intermediaries and insurance companies, their standard deviation over this time\nperiod ranged between 0.1 % and 1.2 %, respectively.\n\n11The implicit assumption here is that the lender estimates PDs in a through-the-cycle manner (as\nopposed to a point-in-time estimate which incorporates information on the current state of the economy).\n\n\nA common systematic factor Sm refers to systematic risk that a\u010f\u0179ects all borrowers in\ngroup m. This is normalized to have unity expectation so that E[P Dmi(Sm)] = P Dmi\nholds. That is, on average, the random PDs equal their estimates reported by lenders. In\nterms of default correlation, Equation (2.2) generally implies\n\ncorr(cid:0)Dmi, Dnj\n\n\n\nP DmiP Dnj\n\n\u00c2\u02c7 cov(Sm, Sn)\n\nfor two borrowers in di\u010f\u0179erent groups m and n. For two borrowers in the same group m,\nvar(Sm) replaces cov(Sm, Sn). That is, the (co-)variation of systematic factors governs\nlinear dependence among the borrowers\u00e2 defaults.\n\nIntroducing systematic factors has an important consequence from a systemic per-\nspective. It makes the default indicators of the obligors of di\u010f\u0179erent banks dependent on\ncommon factors and, thus, renders the banks\u00e2 portfolios interdependent. Therefore, the\nmodel captures defaults concentration risk as a major source of potentially large losses in\nthe banking sector.12\n\nAs in the CreditRisk+ model, random variables Sm follow a gamma distribution with\nexpectation one and variance given by the scale parameter \u00ce\u0105m, as recapitulated in Ap-\npendix A.1. In the standard CreditRisk+ setting, though, the group-speci\u010f\u0179c factors Sm\nare assumed to be mutually independent, which implies that default events of the bor-\nrowers who belong to di\u010f\u0179erent sectors/countries are independent of each other. Such a\nsimplifying assumption might lead to a signi\u010f\u0179cant underestimation of losses given that\nin Germany, for instance, the correlation between insolvency rates in di\u010f\u0179erent industries\noften reaches 60% to 90%.13 A more realistic model would allow for inter-group depen-\ndence. Giese (2004) introduces two such models \u00e2 hidden gamma and compound gamma14\n\u00e2 which generate a uniform inter-group correlation and a uniform inter-group covariance,\nrespectively. In both models the maximum possible correlation depends on either largest\nor smallest sector variance. Parameters involved can, in principle, be \u010f\u0179tted to an exter-\nnally given covariance matrix of risk factors. However, a good \u010f\u0179t is rarely possible and\nthe \u010f\u0179tting procedure is far from being straightforward, since M + 1 parameters of the\nsystematic factors have to be \u010f\u0179tted to an empirical covariance matrix with M (M + 1)/2\n\nFor SystemicCreditRisk we design a novel, conceptually appealing model for the inter-\ngroup dependence. Its parameters can be estimated without constraints using conven-\ntional statistical techniques and historical data from the German credit register. We\n\n12As the global \u010f\u0179nancial crisis demonstrated, contagion between di\u010f\u0179erent parts of the market can be\nanother source of systemic risk, especially due to loss of con\u010f\u0179dence (see Allen and Carletti, 2013, p.\n125). However, at this stage of the model development we do not consider contagious e\u010f\u0179ects via direct\nlinkages between the banks. We instead give priority to an advanced portfolio model. The impact of\nsystematic factors on common exposure of banks does indeed have far more severe consequences for the\nprobability of simulations bank defaults than direct contagion through the interbank market, as pointed\ntherein.\n\n13Correlation was estimated for the insolvency statistics published by the German Federal Statistical\nO\u010f\u0179ce (see Footnote 10) in a simpli\u010f\u0179ed manner without adjusting for the autocorrelation. Similar \u010f\u0179ndings\n\n14Puzanova (2013) suggests another applications of compound-gamma distributed systematic factors\n\nas an extension to a KMV-type credit portfolio model.\n\n\nsuggest joining the group-speci\u010f\u0179c factors by a copula function.15 Using copulas has the\nadvantage that we can control dependence characteristics by choosing a copula with ap-\npropriate properties such as\n\n1. A heterogeneous dependence structure.\n\n2. Upper tail dependence.\n\n3. Feasible parameter estimation and sampling in high-dimensional problems.\n\nThe \u010f\u0179rst property allows di\u010f\u0179erentiating between groups that are closely related to each\nother and groups that are only weakly related to each other. The second characteristic\nmeans that large, i.e. \u00e2bad\u00e2, realizations of di\u010f\u0179erent systematic factors are likely to oc-\ncur simultaneously. Consequently, default probabilities of the borrowers tend to increase\nsimultaneously, mimicking clustering default events during a recession, when credit con-\ncentration risk materializes in large losses. The third, pragmatic criterion implies that\neven for a large number of systematic factors, estimation and sampling from the copula\nhave to remain feasible.\n\nArchimedean copulas with their simple, closed-form analytical representation are typ-\nical candidates for modeling high-dimensional joint distributions (our third criterion).\nWhereas these copulas themselves are not suitable for modeling heterogeneous depen-\ndence structures (our \u010f\u0179rst criterion), the nested or hierarchical Archimedean copulas\n(HACs) ful\u010f\u0179ll this requirement.16 It is possible to construct a HAC consistent with the\nsecond criterium, using a Gumbel generating function.\nA Gumbel copula has one parameter \u00ce\u00b8 \u00e2 [1,\u00e2) that controls the strength of depen-\ndence between random variables, including the asymptotical upper tail dependence (see\nde\u010f\u0179nition A.2). This parameter is closely related to Kendall\u00e2s rank correlation \u010e given\nin de\u010f\u0179nition A.1.17 For a bivariate Gumbel copula (a copula that joints two random\nvariables), \u010e has a simple analytical expression in terms of the dependence parameter:\n\u010e = (\u00ce\u00b8 \u00e2 1)/\u00ce\u00b8. This shows that higher values of \u00ce\u00b8 lead to stronger dependence of the\nmarginal distributions. \u00ce\u00b8 = 1 corresponds to the independence copula.\n\nThe dependence model that we suggest has a hierarchical structure. Its \u010f\u0179rst hierarchy\nlevel comprises single sectors, countries and regions, i.e. one-dimensional marginal distri-\nbutions of the systematic factors. At the next level, some of the sectors, countries and\nregions are coupled together, for instance, two or three at a time. They a combined by\nlow-dimensional marginal Gumbel copulas with large dependence parameters. Some of\nthe sectors, countries and regions remain loose at this level. They may join in at the next,\nhigher level of hierarchy, where marginal copulas with smaller dependence parameters\nmay combine them either with each other or with the copulas of their peers that have\nbeen already coupled together at the previous level. And so on until, at the very top,\nthe last remaining elements are joined together by a copula with the smallest dependence\nparameter (possibly equal to 1). The entire structure has a mathematical representation\n\n15Appendix A.2 provides the basic theoretical background for copulas. For further reading, we recom-\n\n\n16For an application of HAC within a structural credit risk framework and for its impact on the portfolio\n\ntail risk in comparison to a Gaussian model see Puzanova (2011).\n\n17Conceptually, a measure of rank correlation is more appealing than the Pearson\u00e2s linear correlation\n\nin the non-Gaussian context: see Appendix A.2.\n\n\nthat can be easily pieced together using expressions in the form of Equation (A.7) in\nAppendix A.2.\n\nThe assumptions of gamma marginal distributions and a dependence function in the\nform of HAC with a Gumbel generator completely determine the joint distribution func-\ntion of the systematic factors. Relevant parameters must be \u010f\u0179tted to the available data,\nas Section 6.2 will describe.\n\n2.3 Portfolio loss distribution and risk metrics\n\nHaving completed the description of our portfolio model, we now outline the general\nprocedure for sampling portfolio loss variable which delivers PL distributions at the bank\nand system level:\n\n1. Draw 1, 000 joint realizations of M systematic factors using their copula.\n\n2. Based on that, obtain conditional PDs as given in Equation (2.2).\n\n3. For each joint realization of the systematic factors, draw 10, 000 realizations of the\n\nindividual default indicators for each single borrower using the conditional PDs.\n\n4. For each draw, calculate portfolio loss according to Equation (2.1).\n\n5. Calculate the empirical probability distribution of PLs for each single bank and for\nthe entire system; the system\u00e2s loss equals the sum of losses of all banks in a given\nsimulation run.\n\nThe overall number of simulation runs amounts to ten million \u00e2 a solid basis for the\nempirical PL distributions.\n\nTo express credit risk in numbers, we can obtain the following metrics from the PL\ndistributions of every single bank and of the entire system: expected loss, value-at-risk\nand expected shortfall. Furthermore, from the simulation results we can also derive each\nbank\u00e2s contribution to the system\u00e2s expected shortfall. In the following paragraph, we\nde\u010f\u0179ne these risk metrics in plain words and refer to Puzanova and D\u00c2\u00a8ullmann (2013, p.\n1245 f.) and references therein for more technical details:\n\n\u00e2\u02d8 Expected loss (EL) is de\u010f\u0179ned as the expected value of PL. It is estimated as the\n\nmean of the simulated PL distribution.\n\n\u00e2\u02d8 Value-at-risk (VaR) equals a prede\u010f\u0179ned percentile q of the PL distribution. VaR\nis estimated as the level of PL that was only exceeded in (100 \u00e2 q)% of simulation\nruns.\n\n\u00e2\u02d8 Expected shortfall (ES) is de\u010f\u0179ned as the expected value of PL beyond the VaR. We\n\ncalculate the ES as the mean over (100 \u00e2 q)% of the largest realizations of PL.18\n\n\u00e2\u02d8 A bank\u00e2s individual contribution to the system\u00e2s ES is estimated as the mean PL of\nthe bank in those (100 \u00e2 q)% of simulation runs, in which the system\u00e2s PL exceeds\nthe VaR-threshold.\n\n18For simplicity, we do not adjust ES for the discontinuity of the discrete probability distribution of\n\n\n\n\nTo study the impact of macroeconomic stress scenarios on the credit portfolios of system-\nically important German banks, we combine four data sets: (1) macroeconomic variables,\n(2) NPL ratios, (3) the Bundesbank\u00e2s credit register and (4) supervisory reporting data.\nWe generate the relevant international macroeconomic stress scenarios using NiGEM.\nFrom the NiGEM database, we additionally obtain time series of macroeconomic vari-\nables and use them for the empirical estimation of the satellite macro-econometric model.\nWorking with the same database ensures consistency of estimation, projection and stress\ntesting.\n\nThe country-speci\u010f\u0179c NPL ratios are largely obtained from the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) database on Financial Soundness Indicators (FSI). In the IMF FSI database\nNPLs are de\u010f\u0179ned as non-performing loans to total gross loans.19 This data is enriched with\nNPL ratio time series from the World Bank and, in some cases, from the National Central\nBanks. We use quarterly rather than annual observations, which allows for NPL ratio\nprojections that may vary during the year. The recent crisis, in particular, demonstrated\nhow quickly events in \u010f\u0179nancial markets can be re\u010f\u0179ected in changes of NPL ratios.\n\nThe Bundesbank\u00e2s credit register is our main data source for individual exposures\nof German banks to their borrowers.20 Therefore, we build our portfolio model on this\ndatabase. The credit register contains information on large exposures that reached or\nexceed e1.5 million anytime during the reporting period. We concentrate on the 12 ma-\njor banks that, at the time of our analysis, the German Federal Financial Supervisory\nAuthority (BaFin) identi\u010f\u0179ed (along with a few other banks) as systemically important in-\nstitutions.21 Nevertheless, no aggregation at group level takes place. We instead consider\nindividual credit exposures of all banks belonging to a group, omitting the intra-group\nclaims. For each borrower, the credit register contains information on the country code\nand industry branch. The credit register thus covers both domestic and foreign exposures\nof individual banks to other banks, other \u010f\u0179nancial institutions, non-\u010f\u0179nancial \u010f\u0179rms, house-\n\n19However, there is no single de\u010f\u0179nition of NPLs across countries. For a detailed discussion of the\nde\u010f\u0179nition of NPLs according the IMF FSI database, see also Beck, Jakubik, and Piloiu (2013). The\nIMF summarizes the recommendations for considering loans (and other assets) as NPLs in the IFS\nCompilation Guide. According to the Guide, loans (and other assets) become non-performing when (1)\npayments of interest and/or principal are more than 90 days past due, or (2) interest payments equal to\n90 days or more have been capitalized, re\u010f\u0179nanced, or delayed by agreement, or payments are less than\n90 days overdue, but there are doubts that payments will be made in full (IMF, 2006). The Basel II\nrules and to the EBA standards introduced in 2013 use a broader de\u010f\u0179nition of non-performing exposures\nthat applies to all on-balance sheet loans and debt securities (except those held for trading) as well as to\nsome o\u010f\u0179-balance sheet exposures. Additionally, non-performing exposures include defaulted and impaired\nexposures, or exposures more than 90 days past due, or, if the full repayment of principal and interest\nwithout realization of collateral is unlikely, regardless of the number of days past due (BIS, 2016; EBA,\n\n20Details on the credit register can be found in Schmieder (2006), and in published work by Ongena,\nexample.

We consider them all, excluding only loans to the central banks.\nFurthermore, we obtain information on borrowers\u00e2 PDs as estimated from internal rating\nsystems by the lenders and information about the credit risk mitigation techniques such\nas collateral and guarantees.\n\nFinally, we obtain data on capital and RWA for the banks under consideration from the\nsupervisory reporting system maintained by the Bundesbank and the BaFin for regular\nbanking supervision. All bank-speci\u010f\u0179c information is as of 2013Q4.\n\nBelow we present some descriptive statistics on large German banks and brie\u010f\u0179y elab-\norate on their credit exposure to the GIPS countries, on which our application example\nfocuses. Section 6 devoted to the calibration of the portfolio model will present more\ndetails on the country- and sector-breakdown.\n\nThe 12 systemically important German banks we focus on in our analysis cover 60%\nfrom total assets of the whole banking industry as of 2013Q4; see Table A.1. Their\nexposure and RWA reported in the credit register total e2,309 billion and to e641 billion,\nrespectively. Thus, the data from the credit register accounts for about 78% of the banks\u00e2\ntotal RWA for credit risk, which equals e817 billion. On average, they maintain core\nequity tier 1 capital (CET1) ratio of nearly 16%.\n\nTable A.2 additionally provides aggregated \u010f\u0179gures on the banks\u00e2 portfolio structure\nwith respect to the GIPS countries. Whereas the overall foreign exposure accounts for\n55% (e1,272 billion) of the total exposure, exposure to the borrowers located in the GIPS\ncountries makes up 12% (e147 billion). In this context, Italy (e76 billion) and Spain\n(e58 billion) account for a bulk of the GIPS exposure. Exposure to Portugal and Greece\nis far less signi\u010f\u0179cant (e10 billion and e2 billion, respectively).\n\n4 Scenario Design\n\n4.1 Modeling with NiGEM\n\nThe present paper designs relevant international macroeconomic stress scenarios using\nNiGEM. NiGEM is a global structural macroeconomic model developed and maintained\nby the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). It is often used for\npolicy analysis and stress testing purposes by various institutions, such as international\norganizations and central banks (including the ECB; Dees et al., 2017). It combines struc-\ntural models for a large number of individual economies by linking them through trade,\nprices and \u010f\u0179nancial markets. Thus, the model captures important mechanisms for the\ntransmission of macroeconomic shocks across countries.22 Additionally, we use the base-\nline scenario designed by the NIESR that supplies projections as to how macroeconomic\nvariables could develop in the future in the absence of any additional shocks.\n\n22In contrast to purely empirical models (e.g. vector autoregressive or VAR models) NiGEM im-\nposes an explicit structure on economies and exhibits \u00e2New Keynesian\u00e2 characteristics by combining\nnominal rigidities and forward-looking elements. On the other hand, it does not model the microeco-\nnomic optimization decisions which are the foundation of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)\nmodels. For an overview of NiGEM, see, in particular, Barrell, Becker, Byrne, Gottschalk, Hurst, and\nvan Welsum (2004). A brief model description and a policy application are also provided by Catte,\nCova, Pagano, and Visco (2011), for example. For more recent information on the model structure, see\nhttp://nimodel.niesr.ac.uk/.\n\n\nWe de\u010f\u0179ne various stress scenarios using shocks to certain variables that induce en-\ndogenous reactions of real GDP, unemployment as well as short and long-term interest\nrates. One key advantage of this model-based approach is that the derived responses of\nthe variables which are relevant to bank stress are model-consistent and not determined\nexogenously. The short-term (three-month) interest rates, in particular, develop in ac-\ncordance with NiGEM\u00e2s default monetary policy rules, the key objective of which is to\nstabilize in\u010f\u0179ation. The long-term interest rates are, in turn, derived from the expected\nshort-term interest rates over the next ten years. The deviations of the relevant variables\nfrom the baseline (as a percentage or percentage points) show the extent of macroeco-\nnomic stress generated. The levels for important macroeconomic variables represent the\nsum of the baseline levels and the deviations in a stress scenario simulation. Thus, they\nalso depend on the underlying NIESR projections. In macroeconomic stress tests, su\u010f\u0179-\nciently strong stress should be generated within a plausible macroeconomic setting. The\nscenarios presented in this paper which focus on speci\u010f\u0179c, intuitive macroeconomic stories\nhave been designed in order to illustrate how our model works. The consideration of even\nlarger individual shocks might have compromised the plausibility of the scenarios. How-\never, it would be straightforward to combine the individual scenarios in order to generate\neven greater macroeconomic stress (at the expense of an intuitive storytelling).\n\nIn all stress scenarios, GDP declines and the unemployment rate increases in the GIPS\ncountries compared to the baseline. However, the implications for the interest rate spread,\ni.e. the premium on long over short-term interest rates, di\u010f\u0179er considerably depending on\nthe speci\u010f\u0179c stress scenario applied. As a rule, the shocks for the GIPS countries are\ncalibrated to the same relative magnitude (e.g. as a percentage of GDP). Furthermore,\nthe shocks always hit these countries simultaneously, which means that direct e\u010f\u0179ects and\nspill-over are included in the simulations. Originating in a small number of countries,\nthe shocks are transmitted to macroeconomic variables in other countries in the NiGEM\nworld.\nIn all cases, the simulations of stress scenarios start in 2015Q1 and allow us\nto make a projection over a four-year time horizon until 2018Q4, based on the baseline\nscenario assumed in NiGEM.23 The baseline starts as early as 2014Q1. In order to generate\nsu\u010f\u0179ciently strong stress, each scenario represents a combination of several macroeconomic\nshocks. Subsequent shocks are implemented by stacked simulations so that new shocks\nare not anticipated by economic agents.\n\n4.2 Macro stress scenarios for the GIPS countries\n\nWe concentrate on macroeconomic shocks to the GIPS countries. During the sovereign\ndebt crisis in the euro area the GIPS countries were subject to severe macroeconomic\nstress, which also a\u010f\u0179ected other economies adversely. While we acknowledge that the\npast may not be a good guide to the future, we have selected those countries in order to\nillustrate how stress propagated through our model might potentially a\u010f\u0179ect the German\n\u010f\u0179nancial sector. Additionally, we include a scenario that generates macroeconomic stress\nat the global level. Overall, we simulate three stress scenarios for the GIPS countries\nin NiGEM: an oil crisis, a \u010f\u0179nancial crisis and a scenario of \u010f\u0179scal contraction. They are\nmutually complementary insofar as they di\u010f\u0179er particularly in terms of the development of\nthe interest rate spread. Moreover, the scenarios also di\u010f\u0179er in terms of the persistence of\n\n23NiGEM version v2.14-b and the corresponding baseline APR14-B were used for simulation purposes.\n\n\nthe assumed shocks and the degree to which other economies are a\u010f\u0179ected by the assumed\nshocks. Figure A.1 presents the resulting deviations of the macroeconomic variables of\ninterest from their baseline path for the GIPS countries.\n\nOil crisis scenario.\n\nIn the oil crisis scenario, an exogenous surge in the nominal\noil price is assumed, which might re\u010f\u0179ect an escalation of geopolitical tensions, for exam-\nple.24 Eventually, the oil price peaks at US$120 above the baseline, before returning to\nthe baseline. This oil price shock raises in\u010f\u0179ation sharply at the global level, triggering\na vigorous tightening in monetary policies so that short-term interest rates rise steeply\nrelative to long-term rates. Real global output falls below the baseline due to the imme-\ndiate weakness in aggregate demand and the deterioration in supply-side fundamentals.\nAs the oil price surge ultimately proves to be transitory, however, the variables return to\ntheir original path in the long term.\n\nFinancial crisis scenario. In this scenario, a crisis in the \u010f\u0179nancial markets of the\nGIPS countries is generated by a combination of several shocks which, eventually turn\nout to be temporary. First, a term premium is used to raise the long-term interest rates\nrelative to short-term interest rates. This corresponds ceteris paribus to a decline in the\nprices of the a\u010f\u0179ected government bonds. As the yields on government bonds form the basis\nof enterprises\u00e2 \u010f\u0179nancing costs, this dampens private investment. Additionally, a premium\nis also introduced directly into enterprises\u00e2 user costs of capital with the aim of capturing a\nspeci\u010f\u0179c deterioration in their \u010f\u0179nancing conditions. The overall rise in user costs of capital\nin the GIPS countries resembles the crisis in 2008-09. At the same time, a slump in stock\nprices is simulated via the risk premium contained in stock prices, while house prices are\nlowered exogenously. Overall, a pronounced weakness in aggregate demand (especially in\nprivate investment) is generated in the GIPS countries which dampens consumer prices\nthere over the longer term. However, the \u010f\u0179nancial shocks entail a depreciation of the\neuro, the short-term in\u010f\u0179ationary impact of which a\u010f\u0179ects the entire euro area and needs\nto be dampened from the perspective of monetary policy. As a result, the euro area-\nwide short-term interest rate rises slightly above the baseline initially before it falls below\nit. A decline in real (long-term) interest rates stimulates investment in other euro-area\ncountries counteracting a shortfall in demand due to reduced exports to GIPS countries.\nLower euro-area demand and the depreciation of the euro also transmit the impact of the\nshocks to economies outside the euro area.\n\nFiscal contraction scenario. The scenario of \u010f\u0179scal contraction simulates ambi-\ntious e\u010f\u0179orts to improve public \u010f\u0179nances in the GIPS countries combining cuts to (real)\ngovernment consumption and hikes in the income tax rate. To capture mixed economic\ndevelopments in the euro area, nominal hourly wages in Germany are raised exogenously\nabove the baseline. At the euro-area aggregate level, this basic in\u010f\u0179ationary shock coun-\nteracts the disin\u010f\u0179ationary impact of \u010f\u0179scal consolidation in the GIPS countries. As a\nresult, there is virtually no change in short-term and long-term interest rates in the euro\narea. Nevertheless, real aggregate output in the GIPS countries is severely dampened in\nthis setting. In Germany, real GDP is somewhat lower compared to the baseline, as the\nexogenous rise in wages constitutes a negative supply-side shock.25\n\n24The plunge in the oil price since mid-2014 demonstrates that the oil market has been prone to severe\nprice shifts. Moreover, US recessions have been regularly preceded by strong increases in the oil price;\n\n\n\n5 Multi-Country Macro-Econometric Model\n\n5.1 Dynamic country panel model\n\nDesigning our satellite macro-econometric model, we follow the current literature on the\ndeterminants of NPLs (Beck et al., 2013; Louzis, Vouldis, and Metaxas, 2012) and use\nthe dynamic panel approach in order to estimate the impact of macroeconomic variables\non the NPL ratios. The estimation procedure examines changes in the NPL ratios rather\nthan NPL ratio levels.26\n\nThe regression explains changes in the NPL ratios at country level in terms of changes\nin the most important macroeconomic variables that may theoretically exert an in\u010f\u0179uence\non the NPLs. The explanatory variables taken into consideration relate, \u010f\u0179rst, to the real\neconomy (the growth rate of real GDP and the change in the unemployment rate)27 and,\nsecond, to the \u010f\u0179nancial markets (the change in the short-term and long-term interest\nrates), with the exact de\u010f\u0179nitions of the variables to be found in Table A.328. Our sample\nconsists of 24 EU countries available in NiGEM plus the four large economies of Australia,\nCanada, Japan and the United States (see also the upper panel of Table A.7; we exclude\nCroatia, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, and Norway because of lack of data in NiGEM).\nThis is a balanced panel data set with a total of 1,008 country-quarter observations for\nvariables entering the regression.\n\nWe use the two-step system generalized method of moments (GMM) approach pro-\n\nposed by Blundell and Bond (1998) to estimate the following linear dynamic model:\n\n\n\u00e2NPLit =\n\n\u00ce\u0105k\u00e2NPLi(t\u00e2k) + \u00ce\u02db(cid:48) (L) \u00e2Macroit + \u00ce\u02c7i + \u010eit,\n\n\n\nt = q + 1,\u00c2\u02c7\u00c2\u02c7\u00c2\u02c7 , Ti,\n\ni = 1,\u00c2\u02c7\u00c2\u02c7\u00c2\u02c7 , N,\n\nwhere the variable \u00e2NPLit is the change in the NPL ratios at time t compared to the\nprior period and \u00e2NPLi(t\u00e2k) is the lagged change in the NPL ratios, \u00e2Macroit is a vector\nof explanatory macroeconomic variables, \u00ce\u02db(cid:48) (L) is a vector of associated polynomials in\nthe lag operator and q is the maximum lag length in the model. \u00e2Macroit consists of the\n\n26First, the levels are very persistent. Second, we are predominantly interested in the in\u010f\u0179uence of\nmacroeconomic factors on changes in NPL ratios. Last but not least, considering changes rather than\nlevels, we can better deal with di\u010f\u0179erences in the de\u010f\u0179nition of the NPLs in individual countries.\n\n27The NPL ratios used in our model refer to total gross loans for a two-fold reason. First, a recent\nBundesbank study for Germany, France, Italy and Spain shows on the one hand that there is a pronounced\ncyclical relationship between the annual growth rates of real loans to non-\u010f\u0179nancial corporations and the\ncorresponding growth rates of real GDP Deutsche Bundesbank (2015). Second, Minh, Dinh, Mullineaus,\nand Muriu (2012) show, using the UK data, that unemployment appears to be the major macroeconomic\nfactor in\u010f\u0179uencing loan losses for mortgage loans.\n\n28We do not include variables that describe the credit cycle in our regression since they are not available\nin NiGEM. However, there is evidence that loans to non-\u010f\u0179nancial corporations follow the business cycle\nwith a lagging pattern. Moreover, on the demand side, large \u010f\u0179rms may prefer \u010f\u0179nancing through corporate\nbonds rather than through bank borrowing during periods when capital market conditions are favorable\n\n29NPL ratios enter the regression starting in 2005Q1, whereas macroeconomic variables are used from\n\n2004Q2 onwards to account for the maximum lag length of three quarters.\n\n\ngrowth rate of real GDP (\u00e2GDPit), the change in the unemployment rate (\u00e2UNit), the\nchange in the short-term (\u00e2SRit) and long-term (\u00e2LRit) interest rates. Ti is the number\nof time periods for which macroeconomic variables are available for the ith country and\nN is the number of countries. In our case we have a balanced panel and Ti equals 39\nquarters for every i and N equals 28 countries. \u00ce\u02c7i denotes the time-invariant unobservable\ne\u010f\u0179ects \u00e2 the country-speci\u010f\u0179c e\u010f\u0179ects \u00e2 and \u010eit denotes the error term.\n\nA number of studies (Nkusu, 2011; OeNB, 2002; Demirg\u00c2\u00a8u\u00c2\u00b8c-Kunt and Detragiache,\n1998) describe the relationship between the macroeconomic variables and NPL ratios as\nwell as the expected signs of the corresponding regression coe\u010f\u0179cients as follows:\n\n\u00e2\u02d8 In an economic upturn, there are few corporate insolvencies and credit defaults. As\na result, growth in real GDP will be negatively correlated to changes in NPL ratios.\nBy contrast, a higher unemployment rate is likely to be associated with an increase\nin NPL ratios.\n\n\u00e2\u02d8 A rise in the long-term interest rate implies higher funding costs for enterprises and\nhouseholds and therefore impairs their ability to repay loans. A large increase in\nthe short-term interest rate can be passed on to borrowers as well, especially due\nto rising funding costs of banks. Additionally, a very large increase in the short-\nterm interest rate may lead to an inverted yield curve, which indicates the periods\nof economic recession. Accordingly, an increase in both short-term and long-term\ninterest rates should be positively correlated with the changes in NPL ratios.\n\nTo account for the NPL persistence, we include two lags of the changes in NPL ratios,\nexpecting positive coe\u010f\u0179cients. We consider the macroeconomic variables to be endogenous\nto the model.30 The two-step Blundell-Bond estimation for small samples requires a\nWindmeijer correction of the standard errors (Windmeijer, 2005). We apply a two-step\nrobust estimation using Stata.\n\n5.2 Results of dynamic country panel analysis\n\n\nTable A.5 shows the results of the two-step Blundell-Bond estimation, including two\ntests for autocorrelation as well as a test for overidentifying restrictions.31 Moreover,\nin order to assess the cumulative impact of each explanatory variable on the change\nin the NPL ratios, the table additionally reports the long-run coe\u010f\u0179cients de\u010f\u0179ned as\nk=1 \u00ce\u0105k). The coe\u010f\u0179cients for the lagged NPL ratio are positive\nand statistically signi\u010f\u0179cant. This means that an increase in the change of the NPL ratios\nin the last two quarters is likely to be followed by an increase in the current quarter.\n\n\n30However, the number of groups in the cross-section imposes certain restrictions on the number of\ninstruments used for the endogenous variables. Too many instruments could lead to implausible results\nin the speci\u010f\u0179cation tests conducted by the Blundell-Bond estimator (particularly in the Hansen test);\nsee Roodman (2009b). Therefore, in our estimation procedure, we limit the number of instruments\naccording to the rule that the overall number of instruments for the endogenous variables should be as\nclose as possible to the number of groups in cross-section.\n\n31Although, normally, in the dynamic panel regression, the R-sq is not reported we can use the R-sq\nwithin from the corresponding \u010f\u0179xed-e\u010f\u0179ect estimator which is equal to 0.45 as a guide to the overall\ngoodness-of-\u010f\u0179t for our model. We also run the two-step Arellano-Bond estimation as a robustness test.\nHowever, the results remain mostly the same.\n\n\nThe persistence of the NPL ratio growth is also con\u010f\u0179rmed by Beck et al. (2013). Overall,\nthe macroeconomic variables in our model are fairly good at explaining the change in\nthe NPL ratios; they show the expected signs and a signi\u010f\u0179cant impact.32 Our results are\ngenerally in line with the \u010f\u0179ndings of other recent studies (Beck et al., 2013; Louzis et al.,\n\nThe impact of the macroeconomic variables also appears to be signi\u010f\u0179cant in economic\nterms.33 Overall, for both the entire country sample and the GIPS countries, the economic\ne\u010f\u0179ects from our empirical model show that if all macroeconomic factors are \u00e2stressed\u00e2\nsimultaneously and their values increase by two standard deviations, the change in NPL\nratios also increases by more than two standard deviations. In terms of economic signi\u010f\u0179-\ncance, the declining real GDP growth rate is the main driving force behind the deteriora-\ntion in credit quality for the entire country sample. It is worth noting that the change in\nthe unemployment rate exerted a clear, economically signi\u010f\u0179cant in\u010f\u0179uence on the change\nin NPL ratios. For the GIPS countries, the economic e\u010f\u0179ect from the increase in the un-\nemployment rate slightly outweighs the economic e\u010f\u0179ect from the decline in real GDP. For\nthe GIPS countries, the economic e\u010f\u0179ects from the change in the long-term interest rates\nseem to play an important role as well.\n\nTwo diagnostic autocorrelation tests unambiguously attest the consistency of the dy-\nnamic Blundell-Bond estimator (see also Roodman, 2009a). As expected, the AR(1) test\nrejects the null hypothesis that there is no \u010f\u0179rst-order autocorrelation in the di\u010f\u0179erentiated\nerror terms. The more important AR(2) test cannot reject the null hypothesis that there\nis no second-order autocorrelation in the di\u010f\u0179erentiated error terms.\n\nThe third diagnostic Hansen test for overidentifying restrictions generally shows that\nthe instruments used are valid. It does not reject the null hypothesis which assumes that\nthe instruments do not correlate with a certain set of error terms.\n\nSince we aim at using our model to project the NPL ratios as part of stress testing,\nFigure A.2 demonstrates, using the GIPS countries as an example, the projections of the\nstress scenarios. With the exception of Portugal, the oil crisis scenario has the greatest\nimpact on the NPL ratios in the GIPS countries. In contrast to the \u010f\u0179nancial crisis and\nthe \u010f\u0179scal contraction scenarios, the oil crisis scenario comprises a global shock a\u010f\u0179ecting\nall economies (albeit to varying degrees), creating a slump in aggregate demand at the\nglobal level. Moreover, the in\u010f\u0179ationary impact of higher oil prices causes central banks\nto raise short-term interest rates vigorously (in line with pre-set monetary policy rules).\nThis response in interest rates poses additional stress on the \u010f\u0179nancial system beyond the\n\n32It is evident from the correlation matrix (not reported here) that there is a problem of multicollinearity\nbetween the lagged change in the unemployment rate and growth in real GDP lagged by one or two\nquarters. Despite this problem, the lagged change in the unemployment rate stays signi\u010f\u0179cant in the\nmodel. A robustness check using Arellano-Bond, \u010f\u0179xed-e\u010f\u0179ects and OLS estimations has shown that the\nlagged change in the unemployment rate proves consistently signi\u010f\u0179cant. We therefore decide to retain\nthe lagged change in the unemployment rate in the model, as the removal of an important explanatory\nvariable may result in model misspeci\u010f\u0179cation and a biasing of the coe\u010f\u0179cients for the variables remaining\nin the model (Wooldridge, 2000). Additionally, while an adverse shock to aggregate demand lowers real\nGDP and raises the unemployment rate, the degree of persistence of these responses di\u010f\u0179ers in NiGEM,\nas the wage mechanism facilitates a return of the labor market to equilibrium.\n\n33The economic e\u010f\u0179ect of a macroeconomic variable is calculated as two times its standard deviation\nmultiplied by its estimated long-run coe\u010f\u0179cient. It is a usual practice in di\u010f\u0179erent stress-testing models to\ntake two standard deviations in order to evaluate the stress levels.\n\n\nimpact of lower macroeconomic activity.\n\nIn the case of the oil price shock, the deviation of the NPL ratios from the baseline\nwith the maximum value reaching 3 2\n3pps, whereas it reaches nearly 3pps for Spain. The\nreaction of Italy and Portugal is less strong with the largest deviation from the baseline\namounting to around 1 1\n2pps for Italy and to roughly 1pp for Portugal. The maximum\nabsolute values of the NPL ratios during the same time span are the highest for Greece\nat slightly above 36%, followed by Italy, Spain and Portugal with values at around 20%,\n\nThe second strongest reaction of the GIPS countries is observed in the \u010f\u0179nancial crisis\nscenario. During the period from end-2016 to end-2017, the deviation of the NPL ratios\nfrom the baseline reaches the highest value of over 3pps for Greece and of around 2 2\nfor Spain. Here too, Italy and Portugal show a less strong reaction with the highest values\n2pps. The maximum absolute values for the NPL ratios for Greece are slightly\nabove 35%, followed by Italy, Spain and Portugal with values, again, at about 20%, 18%\nand 13%, respectively.\n\nIn the scenario of \u010f\u0179scal contraction we see a rather moderate reaction for the GIPS\ncountries. During the period from end-2016 to end-2017, the largest deviation of the NPL\nratios from the baseline is observed for Greece at slightly below 2pps, followed by Spain\nat just over 1pp. The deviation of the NPL ratios from the baseline for Italy and Portugal\nremains at the level of around 1pp for both countries. The maximum absolute values for\nthe NPL ratios are just over 34% for Greece, at around 19.5% for Italy, just over 16% for\nSpain and at around 12.5% for Portugal.\n\n6 Calibration of the Portfolio Model\n\n\nIn order to calibrate the SystemicCreditRisk model described in Section 2, we \u010f\u0179rst de\u010f\u0179ne\nrisk parameters EADs, LGDs and PDs using the data from the German credit register.\nThe EAD is approximated by the total exposure of a bank to a borrower. Bank exposure\nto borrowers is de\u010f\u0179ned fairly broadly. It includes not only loans but also bonds and other\nsecurities in the banking book as well as derivatives and other o\u010f\u0179-balance sheet items.34\nTaking into account collateral posted, the LGD is \u010f\u0179xed to 35% for the secured part of\nthe exposure and to 45% for the unsecured part. Additionally, the LGD is adjusted\nfor the e\u010f\u0179ect of guarantees provided by other banks. The PDs originate from internal\nrating systems of the lenders and undergo a few corrections. Appendix A.3 provides more\ntechnical details on EADs, LGDs and PDs.\n\n34The following items are not reported in the credit register: exposures to German central and local\ngovernments and communities (supposed to have zero PD), securities in the trading book, undrawn loan\ncommitments, shares in other enterprises. For a detailed de\u010f\u0179nition of credit exposure and exceptions, see\n\n\n6.2 Copula of the systematic factors\n\nThe next step in the calibration of the portfolio model consists in the estimation of the\njoint probability distribution of systematic factors for German sectors, foreign countries,\nand remaining geographic regions.\n\nThe credit register assigns each corporate borrower to a country and an industry sec-\ntor according to the Nomenclature statistique des activit\u00c2\u00b4es \u00c2\u00b4economiques dans la Commu-\nnaut\u00c2\u00b4e europ\u00c2\u00b4eenne (NACE) classi\u010f\u0179cation and separates remaining retail borrowers into two\ngroups: households and non-pro\u010f\u0179t organizations. Based on that, we introduce M = 69\ngroup-speci\u010f\u0179c systematic factors. This includes, on the one hand, 28 sectors for German\nborrowers. Foreign borrowers, on the other hand, are only grouped either by country or\nby region of their residence (since there are not always enough borrowers per group to\nallow a \u010f\u0179ner breakdown). Thus, in addition to German sectors, we consider 32 single\nforeign countries (Table A.7) and nine remaining geographic regions. The regions are de-\n\u010f\u0179ned in accordance with the de\u010f\u0179nition of country groups used in the balance of payments\nstatistics.\n\nTables A.6 and A.7 provide sectoral, country and regional breakdown of exposure of\nthe 12 banks as well as the historic average share of loans in each of these groups. This\noverview shows that approximately half of large loans by major German banks have been\nextended to German borrowers and that the domestic exposure is concentrated in the\n\u010f\u0179nancial sector (on average, exposure to banks and other \u010f\u0179nancial intermediaries has\nmade up around 75% of the reported large domestic loans).35\n\nWe calibrate the joint distribution of systematic factors in two steps. First, we es-\ntimate parameters of the marginal gamma distributions of the group-speci\u010f\u0179c systematic\nfactors. Then, we \u010f\u0179t their copula to the data. For this purpose, we need historical data\nthat re\u010f\u0179ects (joint) variability of defaults per sector, country and region. In the Cred-\nitRisk+ context, related literature suggests using historical default rates; see, for example,\nBoegelein, Hamerle, Knapp, and R\u00c2\u00a8osch (2004). Such data is very scarce, though.36 For-\ntunately, since 2008, the credit register has contained, on borrower level, data on speci\u010f\u0179c\nprovisions for impairment losses. Using them, we can approximate annualized default\n\n35Around 60% of the domestic exposure are concentrated in the banking sector. Therefore, we argue,\nit is essential to consider this exposure. Other studies with a similar top-down stress-testing set-up\nalso choose portfolio structure which includes exposure to \u010f\u0179nancial institutions (Castre, Fitzpatrick, and\nsectors) argue that exposure to banks is di\u010f\u0179erent in terms of the amount secured by collateral and in\nterms of maturity structure; thus, they exclude it from their analysis. However, in our study, we take\ninto account the amount of collateral posted. In this respect we do not di\u010f\u0179erentiate between exposure\nto banks and other exposures. Additionally, there is also empirical evidence that the average length\nof contracts in the interbank market is well above one year (Bluhm, George, and Krahnen, 2016). In\nthe central bank models such as the BoE\u00e2s RAMSI, the ECB\u00e2s stress-testing approach and the OeNB\u00e2s\nSRM, the interbank market appears to be an integral part of the top-down stress-testing framework\nas well. However, these models focus mere on network e\u010f\u0179ects and contagion in the interbank market.\nAdmittedly, considering credit exposure to banking sector within the scope of our portfolio model is a\n\u010f\u0179rst step towards a more-sophisticated stress-testing framework.\n\n36Since the actual default rate history accumulated by banks is not available to researchers, published\nstatistics on insolvency rates are often used instead. However, data restrictions do not allow us to\npursue this estimation strategy. Although the German Federal Statistical O\u010f\u0179ce publishes annual data\non insolvency rates, the sector breakdown di\u010f\u0179ers from the NACE classi\u010f\u0179cation used in the credit register.\nMoreover, it is di\u010f\u0179cult to obtain insolvency statistics for all countries and regions included in the model.\n\n\nrates per sector/country/region for each quarter. To accomplish this, we take four con-\nsecutive quarters at a time and calculate the share of borrowers with speci\u010f\u0179c provisions\nin the respective group. By doing so, we take account of lending from all German banks,\nas reported in the credit register.37\n\nThe default statistics serve as a data basis for parameter calibration. First, we use\nthem for setting the parameters of the marginal gamma distributions of the group-speci\u010f\u0179c\nsystematic factors. For each factor, we apply Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for\ntruncated samples to the historical group-speci\u010f\u0179c default rates. We assume that samples\nare right truncated with a known point of truncation that equals the maximum observed\nvalue of default statistics for this group. The estimation procedure boils down to MLE\nthat does not simply use a gamma probability distribution function fg(x; \u00ce\u0105) to de\u010f\u0179ne its\nobjective function, but also takes into account the cumulative probability of observing\nthe data up to the point of truncation fg(x; \u00ce\u0105)/Fg(xtr; \u00ce\u0105); see Hughes (1962, p. 21 f.). In\nsome rare cases, the MLE may fail. Here, we suggest using sample moments for pinning\ndown distribution parameters. The estimated gamma distributions are then normalized\nto have the mean of one. Tables A.6 and A.7 provide a schematic overview of the resulting\ngamma distributions.\n\nWe then use the default statistics to calibrate the structure and dependence parame-\nters of the copula that joins all systematic factors. To estimate parameters \u00ce\u00b8 at di\u010f\u0179erent\nlevels of the hierarchy of the Gumbel HAC copula, we utilize routines from the \u00e2HAC\npackage\u00e2 in R programming environment (R Core Team, 2014). The HAC package docu-\nmentation by Okhrin and Ristig (2012, p. 4 f.) describes the multi-stage MLE procedure\nimplemented, and Appendix A.2 brie\u010f\u0179y summarizes the main steps of the estimation\nalgorithm. MLE is performed such as to neglect small di\u010f\u0179erences in the strength of de-\npendence between di\u010f\u0179erent systematic factors and, on the other hand, with the goal of\npreserving a reasonably granular copula structure.38\n\nFigures A.3 to A.5 present the estimated HAC in all details and show its 44 depen-\ndence parameters. For reasons of clear presentation, we divide the HAC into many parts:\nsub-copulas C[1] to C[5] and a \u00e2top\u00e2 copula. Here, we brie\u010f\u0179y describe the estimated\ndependence structure. Sub-copulas C[1] and C[4] mostly join German sectors. The esti-\nmated parameters suggest that, historically, default statistics approximated based on the\ndata for speci\u010f\u0179c provisioning by German banks were closely associated for the following\n\n37Similar approaches have been pursued in the related literature before; see, for instance, Memmel,\nG\u00c2\u00a8und\u00c2\u00a8uz, and Raupach (2012) for German borrowers. The authors approximate historical default statistics\nby the rates of write-downs obtained from the German borrowers statistics. The quarterly borrowers\nstatistics collected by the Bundesbank contain information on loans to domestic borrowers as well as\nwrite-downs (write-ups) aggregated at the level of di\u010f\u0179erent industries and groups of retail borrowers.\nInformation on foreign borrowers is not collected, however, which precludes consideration of the borrowers\nstatistics in our study.\n\n38In order to check the robustness of estimation results for the joint distribution function of the system-\natic factors (their marginal distributions and the copula), we have additionally performed estimation that\nincludes the most recent data up to 2015Q4. The results (not reported here) show that there are some\nchanges in dependence parameters and in the composition of groups (sub-copulas) of German sectors\nand/or foreign countries. These changes in the overall dependence structure, however, do not a\u010f\u0179ect the\nresults for banks\u00e2 capital requirements considerably.\n\n\nsectors in Germany:\n\n((((construction (S19) and housing companies (S20)) and\n(households (S26) and food service (S22))) and other real estate (S21)) and\nother services (S25),\n\nas shown in C[1], and, as shown in C[4], for:\n\n(((metals and metal products (S6) and machinery (S7)) and\n((wood, furniture, paper, printing (S9) and textiles (S10)) and\n(renting and leasing (S14) and equity investment (S18)) and\ncomputers, electronic (S8))) and a number of others).\n\nOn the other hand, the arguments of sub-copulas C[3] and C[5] are mostly countries\nand regions. C[3] includes Sweden, Norway and other countries in Europe (1031) as\nwell as Spain and remaining countries in the Americas (1036). C[5] joins Slovenia and\nPoland, Croatia and remaining countries in Europe (1032), Malta and Cyprus, Denmark,\nNetherlands, Finland, Italy, Portugal and Greece as well as Luxembourg and Austria.\nThe sub-copula C[2] has mixed arguments, including most of the remaining sectors in\nGermany and Canada and the USA and other main countries in the Americas (1035), as\nwell as remaining countries in Asia (1038) and Africa (1034). At the top level, we see\nthat in the past the default statistics for Bulgaria evolved virtually independently of the\nrest of the portfolio and even more so in the case of Japan, Latvia and Hungary.\n\nAdditionally, \u010f\u0179gures presented in Appendix A.4 show as an example small segments\nof the copula that represent pairwise realizations for a number of selected variables. Fig-\nure A.6 presents 500 pairwise realizations for seven selected industry sectors in Germany.\nIt demonstrates for the \u010f\u0179nancial sector that the copula produces the strongest link be-\ntween equity investment \u010f\u0179rms and other non-bank \u010f\u0179nancial intermediators (including\nmoney market fonds). The link to the rates of bank defaults is substantially weaker. The\ninterdependence between systematic factors for the sector \u00e2insurance companies\u00e2 and for\nall three other groups of \u010f\u0179nancial intermediaries is of a medium-scale order of magni-\ntude.\nInterestingly, the positive association between construction, housing companies,\nand other real estate activities is next to perfect. Next, Figure A.7 shows a number of\nselected countries.\nIt illustrates a strong default correlation for the USA and Canada\nand a relatively close association with defaults on the Australian exposure. As for the\ngroup of countries on which we focus our scenario analysis, the HAC generates a tight de-\npendence between systematic factors for Greek, Italian and Portuguese credit exposures.\nInterestingly, credit losses in Spain are more closely related to the group of countries we\ndescribed \u010f\u0179rst. Between both groups, no considerable dependence can be detected.\n\nThe combination of the univariate gamma marginal distributions and the hierarchical\nGumbel-copula makes up the joint M -dimensional distribution function of the systematic\nfactors. This completes our de\u010f\u0179nition of the dependence structure in the proposed port-\nfolio model. What remains to be described is the link between the portfolio model and\nthe macroeconomic scenarios.\n\n\n6.3 The link between NPL ratio projections and the portfolio\n\nmodel\n\nTo embed the portfolio model SystemicCreditRisk into the stress testing framework, we\nperform a percentile mapping between the NPL ratios and the systematic factors that\nwill conduct the e\u010f\u0179ect of macroeconomic projections to the borrower PDs.39 For this\npurpose, we \u010f\u0179rst \u010f\u0179t gamma distributions to the country-speci\u010f\u0179c observations of the NPL\nratios (similarly to the procedure applied for the systematic factors). Then, given a\nrealization of the NPL ratio for a country in a macro scenario, we calculate to which\npercentile of the \u010f\u0179tted gamma distribution this realization corresponds. This percentile\nserves in the following simulation as the lower threshold for the systematic factor(s) for\nthis country. Conditioning on the percentiles means that acceptable realizations of the\nsystematic factors can only lie above the speci\u010f\u0179ed thresholds. Thus, sampled systematic\nfactors cannot be \u00e2better\u00e2 than suggested by the scenario, but they can be \u00e2worse\u00e2. The\npercentile mapping is done for those 28 countries for which NPL ratio projections are\navailable.40 Even if no percentile mapping is possible for the remaining \u010f\u0179ve countries and\ngeographic regions, the corresponding sampled systematic factors will depend on stress\nscenarios, too. The reason for this is that realizations of all systematic factors have to\nexceed their respective thresholds simultaneously. This constrains the area of the HAC\nfrom which sampling is performed. That is, all systematic factors are sampled from a\nsmall, \u00e2stressed\u00e2 part of the copula.\n\nFigure A.8 illustrates the percentiles of the estimated gamma distributions that cor-\nrespond to NPL ratio projections per country in each scenario. For countries such as\nFrance, Netherlands or Germany, where historical NPL ratios over the observation period\nwere not very high, the stressed, large values of NPL ratios lie in the far right tail of the\ndistribution. That is, they represent rare events for these countries. By contrast, for GIPS\ncountries with a historic record of high NPL ratios, realizations from stress scenarios seem\nto be more commonplace, so the NPL ratio percentiles are lower.\n\n6.4 Simulation of portfolio losses\n\nThe NPL ratio projections determine from which part of the estimated copula systematic\nfactors can be drawn. The sampled simulated factors will a\u010f\u0179ect borrower PDs and,\nultimately, the distribution of credit portfolio losses in accordance with the simulation\nprocedure described in Section 2.3.\n\nFor our simulation study, we use the data from the credit register as of the end of\n2013 and assume a static balance sheet. Thus, we sample portfolio losses (PL) quarter-\nby-quarter, scenario after scenario based on the same portfolio composition. The time\n\n39A direct link between the macro model and the portfolio model is problematic. On the one hand,\nNPL ratios are not reported in the credit register. On the other hand, there is no breakdown of NPL\nratios by sector in Germany. Similarly, the data on NPL ratios covers only a limited sub-sample of\ncountries reported in the credit register.\n\n40In Germany, one country-speci\u010f\u0179c percentile threshold applies to all domestic sectors.\nrealization of all stress scenarios coincides with the baseline, however. Therefore, for the stress scenarios,\n\n\nFirst, we draw joint realizations of the 69 systematic factors using their constrained\ncopula. The resulting sample only contains realizations that lie above the \u00e2stressed\u00e2 NPL\nratio thresholds. Figure A.9 demonstrates the magnitude of the systematic factors in the\noil crisis scenario for a number of selected sectors and countries. The systematic factors\nscale up PDs for the borrowers in Italy, Greece and Portugal as high as by a factor of\napproximately 3 to 4. For Spain and, for instance, the United Kingdom, the scaling\nfactors of around 2 apply. The same is true of the German real estate sector (excluding\nhousing companies) and the banking sector. For other domestic \u010f\u0179nancial intermediaries,\nthe oil crisis scenario a\u010f\u0179ects only a moderate increase in PDs of some 50%. Similar scaling\nfactors apply to French borrowers\u00e2 PDs.\n\nIn the next simulation step, we draw default indicators for all borrowers using PDs\nconditional on a realization of systematic factors and calculate the banks\u00e2 portfolio losses.\nFigure A.10 shows a few examples of PL distributions after performing ten million sim-\nulation runs. Comparing PL distribution under the baseline and the oil crisis scenario,\nwe see that not only the magnitude of simulated losses but also sometimes the shape of\ndistribution change considerably under the stress scenario, shifting both bank portfolios\nand the system\u00e2s portfolios into a more dangerous area of high credit risk.\n\nBased on the sampled distribution, we calculate relevant risk measures as described\nat the end of Section 2.3. For the simulations under the baseline and stress scenarios we\nfocus on the system-wide tail risk represented by the system\u00e2s ES. In order to calculate\nthe system\u00e2s ES, we \u010f\u0179x the percentile threshold at a lower of q = 99%, which accounts in\na non-formal way for a limited probability of scenario occurrence.42\n\nFor the purpose of policy application introduced in the next section, we additionally\ncompute the banks\u00e2 individual EL and VaR based on an unconditional simulation of\ncredit portfolio losses, i.e. without regard to any macroeconomic scenarios or NPL ratio\nprojections. This means that the area of the copula, from which systematic factors are\nsampled, is not constrained by any percentile conditions; we draw realizations from the\nentire HAC.43 Running the unconditional simulation for individual banks, we take the\nregulatory threshold for credit-VaR calculation given as q = 99.9%.44\n\nBoth scenario-based and unconditional risk metrics described above can be utilized\n(alongside other supervisory information and risk assessment results) for assessing micro-\nand macroprudential capital needs, as the next section describes. In contrast to a mere\nstand-alone risk assessment for every single bank, this approach incorporates a systemic\nview of capital adequacy.\n\n42In this context, q re\u010f\u0179ects the regulator\u00e2s tolerance towards the probability of a systemic event, as\nIn our case, the latter is given by 100 \u00e2 q = 1%\npointed out by Puzanova and D\u00c2\u00a8ullmann (2013).\nconditional on a scenario. Why use ES and not VaR at the system\u00e2s level? Consider that VaR only\nrepresents minimum loss in the worst (100\u00e2 q)% of cases. Thus, it might be an appropriate risk measure\nfrom the bank owners\u00e2 point of view because their liability given the bank\u00e2s default is limited. The\nregulator, however, has to care about the losses that a bank failure may incur, i.e. in formal terms, the\nexpected losses given that the losses exceed the VaR threshold. This is exactly the de\u010f\u0179nition of ES that\nrepresents expected loss in the worst (100 \u00e2 q)% of cases. Therefore, ES is a more appropriate measure\nof externalities than VaR.\n\n43To ensure a better coverage of the entire copula (as opposed to only a small part of the copula\nconditional on NPL ratio scenarios), we increase the number of joint drawings of the systematic factors\nby factor 10 (10,000 drawings). In turn, we reduce the number of simulation runs for default indicators\nby the same factor (1,000 drawings) to ensure that the sampling remains computationally feasible.\n44This means that the regulator tolerates a bank\u00e2s unconditional probability of default of 100\u00e2q = 0.1%.\n\n\n7 Results and Policy Applications\n\n7.1 Overall assessment\n\nThis section presents an overall assessment of the capability of the system as a whole to\nwithstand severe macroeconomic shocks. Figure A.11 summarizes the results obtained\nfor the system\u00e2s portfolio that consists of all credit exposures of the 12 banks. It presents\nEL and ES at the system level calculated under the unconditional and scenario-based\nsimulations using the SystemicCreditRisk model. These risk metrics suggest that, if we\nonly consider shocks to the banks\u00e2 credit portfolios, the system\u00e2s ES in the unconditional\nsimulation amounts to no more than 13% of the aggregated credit RWA and 62% of the\naggregate common equity tier 1 (CET1) of the 12 banks. In the scenario analysis, the\nsystem\u00e2s ES never exceeds 18% of the reported credit RWA or 88% of the available CET1\ncapital. Thus, in aggregate, there is seemingly enough capital to support the system\u00e2s tail\ncredit risk.\n\nBut the heterogenous results at the bank level presented below tend to tell another\nstory. Although a number of banks appear very well capitalized to withstand even the\nmaximum stress imposed by the scenarios, other banks\u00e2 capital level might need im-\nprovement in order to su\u010f\u0179ciently re\u010f\u0179ect tail risk externality. This indicates that the\ndistribution of capital in the banking system is not necessarily optimal from a systemic\npoint of view.45 This results remain stable also when we include more resent data from\nthe credit register for the purpose of model calibration and portfolio loss simulations.\n\n7.2 Micro- and macroprudential capital requirements\n\nThis section shows how to calibrate micro- and macroprudential capital requirements for\nindividual banks based on the risk measures provided by the model and reports model-\nbased requirements for the 12 banks under consideration.\n\nThe M-PRESS-CreditRisk framework features a holistic micro- and macroprudential\napproach to capital adequacy assessment in the banking sector. Properly adapted, it\ncan inform decisions both on CET1 capital requirements of Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 and on\nmacroprudential bu\u010f\u0179ers such as the systemic risk bu\u010f\u0179er (SRB) and the bu\u010f\u0179er for other\nsystemically important institutions (O-SII). Figure 7.1 outlines these model applications\nembedded into the overall structure of capital requirements, and the next paragraphs\nwalk us through them. Additionally, the model provides information that can be used for\nbuilding loan loss provisions in a forward-looking way.46\n\n45A reallocation of capital according to the banks\u00e2 systemic risk contributions can reduce risk in the\nbanking system, especially by decreasing the probability of multiple defaults; see Gauthier, Lehar, and\n\n46From the range of macroprudential capital tools, we omit the counter-cyclical bu\u010f\u0179er because it is\ntied, in the \u010f\u0179rst place, to aggregate credit growth; see Detken et al. (2014). On the other hand, we\ndo not consider the capital surcharge for global systemically important institutions. According to the\nBasel methodology (BCBS, 2013), setting this bu\u010f\u0179er requires detailed information on a wide range of the\nworlds\u00e2 major banks, which is not available to us. For both these instruments, Puzanova and D\u00c2\u00a8ullmann\n(2013) suggest an alternative: a credit portfolio-based approach. Another tool not considered here is the\ncapital conservation bu\u010f\u0179er. This is de\u010f\u0179ned as a \u010f\u0179xed percentage (2.5%) of an institution\u00e2s risk-weighted\nassets and, therefore, does not require any modeling.\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Model-based CET 1 capital requirements and loan loss provisions\n\nForward-looking provisioning should cover expected future losses. The model\ndeveloped in this paper suggests that a cushion against the losses expected one year ahead\nequals the unconditional expected loss of a bank, denoted in the \u010f\u0179gure as ELbank\nuncond. The\nmetric is computed as the mean of a bank\u00e2s credit portfolio loss distribution obtained\nfrom an unconditional simulation. In our example EL ranges from around 1% to roughly\n4% of the banks\u00e2 credit exposure reported in the credit register. At the aggregated level,\nit amounts to about 2% of the credit exposure of the system.\n\nThe aim of forward-looking provisioning is to absorb expected losses. Minimum capital\nrequirements and capital bu\u010f\u0179ers, on the other hand, are intended to protect individual\nbanks and the system as a whole from losses that exceed the expected amount, i.e. from\nunexpected losses. Unexpected losses are less likely to materialize, but if they do, they\ncan bring an undercapitalized institution \u00e2 or, in an extreme event, even a large part\nof the banking system \u00e2 to the brink of bankruptcy. Against this backdrop, the present\npaper focuses on addressing unexpected losses by means of both microprudential minimum\ncapital requirements and macroprudential add-ons and bu\u010f\u0179ers.\n\nMinimum capital requirements under Pillar 1 represent the minimum amount of\ncapital that a bank must have in order to cover unexpected losses at a one-year risk horizon\ncalculated in accordance with regulatory standards.\nIn general, the regulator de\u010f\u0179nes\nunexpected credit loss as the di\u010f\u0179erence between VaR (99.9% percentile) and expected\nloss computed for the credit portfolio of a bank in the unconditional simulation.\nuncond \u00e2 ELbank\n\nIn our framework, this metric corresponds to the unexpected loss at the bank-level\nobtained from the unconditional simulation and denoted as V aRbank\nuncond. Thus\ncalculated, the unexpected loss can be compared to the regulatory capital reported by a\ngiven bank. Any comparison should, however, account for di\u010f\u0179erences in the underlying\ncalculation prescriptions between the regulatory standards under Pillar 1 and our model-\nbased \u010f\u0179gures. The former is computed using either pre-de\u010f\u0179ned risk weights (standardized\napproach) or based on the assumptions of a perfectly diversi\u010f\u0179ed portfolio (internal rating-\nbased approach), which neglects credit concentration risk. In contrast, our model-based\n\n\nForward looking provisioning: ELuncondbankMinimum capital requirement: VaRuncondbank\u00e2ELuncondbank Additional Pillar 2: ESbaselinesys. contr\u00e2VaRuncondbankCapital conservation buffer Countercyclical capital buffer O-SII buffer: ESsys. share SRB: share in \u0111\u0111\u0111\u0111\u0111\u0111\u010f\u017c\u02ddESstresssys\u00e2ESbaselinesys\u010f\u017c\u02dd G-SII buffer Figure 7.2: Model-based capital requirements per bank\n\n(a) Relative to credit RWA\n\n(b) Relative to CET1\n\nNote: The \u010f\u0179gure presents the model-based capital requirements per bank as well as average values of the\nrespective capital charge for the system.

For the Pillar 2 add-on only the maximum values over the simulation period per bank are\nshown. As to the systemic risk bu\u010f\u0179er (SRB) and the bu\u010f\u0179er for other systemically important institutions\n(O-SII bu\u010f\u0179er), only the maximum of both per bank is shown.

According to the model-based uncon-\nditional simulations, all but one bank have enough capital to back their credit risk. The\naverage value amounts to 7% and 35%, respectively, where the average value is calculated\nas the sum over the unconditional unexpected losses of individual banks divided by the\nsum of credit RWA or of CET1 capital.\nAdditional Pillar 2 capital requirements, should cover volatility over the business\ncycle (EBA, 2014, \u00c2\u00a7358 \u010f\u0179.), i.e. risks to which a bank may expect to become exposed\n7). More generally, those risks to which an institution might be exposed beyond the coverage of Pillar 1\nrequirements should be taken into account under Pillar 2. If the risks not accounted for under Pillar 1\nare addressed by any existing capital bu\u010f\u0179er requirements, including macroprudential bu\u010f\u0179ers, Pillar 2\nrequirements should be o\u010f\u0179set against those bu\u010f\u0179ers if they address the same risk (no double charge); see\nEBA (2014, \u00c2\u00a7 346). Note, however, that di\u010f\u0179erent jurisdictions apply di\u010f\u0179erent approaches to exercising\n\n\nrelevant tail risk metric. It shows how much loss the banking system\u00e2s aggregate credit\nportfolio is expected to incur in the event that the loss exceeds the system\u00e2s VaR. The\nsupervisor should impose an additional capital charge to back this tail risk.48 For this\npurpose, the Pillar 2 capital add-on can be calculated as the banks\u00e2 contribution to the\nsystem\u00e2s ES in the baseline scenario minus the banks\u00e2 VaR from unconditional simulation\nthat was already addressed under Pillar 1: (ESsys.contr\n\nbaseline \u00e2 V aRbank\n\nuncond)+.\n\nDepending on the macroeconomic projections, the banks\u00e2 contributions to the system\u00e2s\nES expressed in euro vary over time. This gives rise to a time-varying Pillar 2 capital add-\non. Its maximum value per bank observed during the 20 quarters for which we generate\nNPL ratio projections, is shown in Figure 7.2. The add-on ranges between around 1% to\n6.5% of credit RWA or 5% to 34% of CET1 capital. The average \u010f\u0179gures come to 3% and\n\nAlthough not a macroprudential instrument per se, the Pillar 2 add-on suggested in\nthis paper takes a system-wide view on capital adequacy. This perspective is central to\nthe application of macroprudential instruments, two of which we consider in the following\nparagraphs: the SRB and the O-SII bu\u010f\u0179er.49\n\nThe systemic risk bu\u010f\u0179er is a macroprudential capital tool available to banking\nsupervisors in the EU.50 It aims at mitigating long-term non-cyclical systemic risk not\ncovered by other instruments. We argue that the SRB can be applied to ensure that even\nin a severe stress scenario the system as a whole can cover its tail risk. To guide decisions\non the possible size and timing of the bu\u010f\u0179er, we suggest using the model-based estimates of\nthe system\u00e2s ES under stress. In particular, for each of the relevant supervisory scenarios,\nthe euro amount of the system\u00e2s ES can be calculated quarter by quarter and compared\nto the system\u00e2s ES in the baseline scenario. The maximum positive di\u010f\u0179erence to the\nbaseline indicates the maximum excess systemic credit risk that should be covered by the\naggregate SRB requirement: SRBsys = max(ESsys\nbaseline)+. The capital charge\nfor each single bank equals to the amount of additional capital needed in the entire\nsystem multiplied by the bank\u00e2s average percentage share in the system\u00e2s ES: SRBbank =\nSRBsys \u00c2\u02c7 ESsys.share.51 Since the ES shares remain remarkably stable, we simply take\nthe average shares over all considered scenarios. The quarter in which the maximum\ndi\u010f\u0179erence is observed indicates the time period up to which the banks should have built\nup the bu\u010f\u0179er.\n\nstress \u00e2 ESsys\n\nIn our particular example, the oil crises scenario generates the greatest adverse impact\non the NPL ratios and portfolio loss. Therefore, the SRB is based on this scenario. This\ndi\u010f\u0179erence between the system\u00e2s ES in oil crisis and baseline scenario reaches its maximum\n\n48The intention is that the owners \u00e2 rather than the deposit insurance schemes or the public \u00e2 bear\n\nthe risk of losses.\n\n49The capital regulation does not provide a de\u010f\u0179nite clear cut between macro- and macroprudential\ninstruments. From the economic perspective, however, we can argue that capital charges based on a\nstandalone assessment of risk of individual banks serve microprudential purposes. On the other hand,\ninstruments that address risks gauged from the systemic perspective, taking externalities into account\n(see Section 1), pursue macroprudential objectives.\n\n51Note that article 133(9) of the CRD IV allows the application of di\u010f\u0179erent SRB requirements for\ndi\u010f\u0179erent subsets of institutions. If the macroprudential authority nevertheless decides to apply a level\nSRB charge for all relevant institutions, any positive di\u010f\u0179erence between (i) SRBsys de\u010f\u0179ned above for an\nindividual bank and (ii) the level charge imposed can be accounted for under Pillar 2.\n\n\nshould have (gradually) built up the SRB. The bu\u010f\u0179er ranges for individual banks from\nabout 1.4% to 5.9% of credit RWA or from around 7% to 43% of the CET1 capital reported\n\nThe O-SII bu\u010f\u0179er is a European supplement to the capital bu\u010f\u0179er designed in the\nBasel III framework for the global systemically important banks (G-SIB). It has a more\nlocal focus, and should internalize the risk which the failure of a large and interconnected\ninstitution located in the EU poses for the banking system of the EU as a whole or its\nmember states.52 According to article 131(5) of the CRD IV, O-SIIs may be required to\nmaintain an O-SII bu\u010f\u0179er of up to 2% of the RWA. In Germany, for instance, the identi\u010f\u0179ed\nO-SIIs are assigned to one of four groups with gradually decreasing bu\u010f\u0179ers of 2%, 1.5%,\n\nFollowing the currently applied methodology, we suggest an approach to how to di-\nvide the banks into the pre-de\u010f\u0179ned four buckets according to their systemic importance,\ntaking the level of the respective capital bu\u010f\u0179ers as given. We gauge the banks\u00e2 systemic\nimportance based to their mean relative share in the system\u00e2s ES, i.e. ESsys.share, and\napply the k-means clustering algorithm. This algorithm assigns banks with the largest\nESsys.share into Group 1. The other groups follow as shown in Figure 7.3.54\n\nThe sum of all capital requirements suggested by our model at hand can be seen\nin Figure 7.2. Here, only the maximum of SRB and O-SII bu\u010f\u0179er is taken into account;\nnot both requirements.55 The smallest capital charge totals 6.3% of credit RWA. The\ncorresponding bank reports nearly three times as much CET1 as required by the model.56\nThe highest capital charge in terms of credit RWA totals 27.2%; the corresponding bank\nreported nearly 8pps less CET1 capital than the suggested combined model-based capital\ncharge for credit risk. Four other banks, labeled bank 2, 3, 4 and 7 in the \u010f\u0179gure, also\nreported less capital than our maximum model-based charge, the di\u010f\u0179erence being 96, 14,\n50 and 9pps, respectively. Therefore, our results emphasize that the distribution of capital\namong the banks might not be consistent with a macroprudential risk assessment.\n\nFurther research. In this paper we have shown how a novel approach to model sys-\ntemic credit risk can be embedded in a general macroprudential stress testing framework.\nBecause of its \u010f\u0179exibility, this framework can accommodate further important features left\n\n52See BCBS (2013) for the G-SIB framework and article 131(5) of the CRD IV for the O-SII bu\u010f\u0179ers. The\nlatter represent the Union\u00e2s implementation of the Basel framework for dealing with domestic systemically\n\n53https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Eigenmittel_BA/dl_methode_asri_ba.pdf.\n54The k-means clustering divides entities into a prede\u010f\u0179ned number of groups by maximizing the distance\nbetween the clusters\u00e2 means. This method was applied by Puzanova and D\u00c2\u00a8ullmann (2013) to the G-SIBs\u00e2\ncontributions to the system\u00e2s ES.\n\n55Since both the SRB and the O-SII bu\u010f\u0179er target the same cross-sectional dimension of systemic risk\n(although possible from di\u010f\u0179erent angles), in most common cases, only the maximum of SRB and O-SII\nwould be applicable. More precise, the maximum of the SRB, O-SII, and the G-SIB bu\u010f\u0179er would apply;\n\n56The results should be interpreted with caution, bearing in mind that the model only considers a\npart of credit risk attributed to the exposures reported in the credit register. The calculated maximum\nrequirement does not, however, include capital charges for the remaining credit risk, market risk, oper-\national risk or credit valuation adjustment. We also do not consider the following capital instruments:\nthe capital conservation bu\u010f\u0179er, the counter-cyclical capital bu\u010f\u0179er and the bu\u010f\u0179er for global systemically\nimportant institutions.\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Banks grouped with respect to their expected shortfall contributions\n\n(a) Banks\u00e2 average share in the system\u00e2s ES\n\n(b) Four groups of respective O-SII bu\u010f\u0179ers\n\nNote: Four groups of banks are shown, clustered according to their mean ES contributions (i.e. percentage\nshares in the expected shortfall of the system) using the k-means algorithms. For the group with the\nlargest ES contributions we assign the highest bu\u010f\u0179er for other systemically important institutions of\n2% of the total RWA. For the following three groups we assign bu\u010f\u0179ers of 1.5%, 1%, and 0.5% of the\ntotal RWA, respectively.

Moreover, in tandem with a capital stress test, liquidity bu\u010f\u0179ers should be chal-\nlenged by funding shocks in order to assess the overall resilience of the system (see Hirtle\nand Lehnert, 2014, p. 8). Most importantly, a comprehensive macroprudential approach\nto stress testing needs to include the feedback e\u010f\u0179ects of a possible credit contraction and\nasset reallocation on the real economy. Obviously, the output risk metrics of an extended\nmodeling framework will be di\u010f\u0179erent in numbers from those presented in the paper. This\nwill not, however, a\u010f\u0179ect the logic of the coherent approach to capital adequacy assessment\nfrom the micro- and macroprudential perspective which we propose.\n\n8 Conclusions\n\nThis paper develops an advanced portfolio model for credit risk assessment in a bank-\ning sector called SystemicCreditRisk and embeds it into a novel stress testing framework\nwhich can inform decisions on micro- and macroprudential capital requirements under\nsystemic stress with focus on credit risk: M-PRESS-CreditRisk. From a technical point\nof view we add to the literature by developing a detailed dependence structure (copula)\nthat can capture the externality of tail risk, i.e. risk of extreme losses that materialize only\n\n\nfrom di\u010f\u0179erent industry sectors and countries in a non-linear way. This approach accounts\nfor many simultaneous borrower defaults across banks\u00e2 portfolios and, therefore, incorpo-\nrates credit default concentration risk in a banking system. Consequently, portfolio loss\ndistributions of individual banks and the entire system show a higher likelihood of large\nlosses. In comparison with Basel II and similar approaches based on simplifying assump-\ntions of perfectly diversi\u010f\u0179ed portfolios, no concentration risk, linear dependencies, absence\nof clustering borrower defaults and banks that are independent from each other (no sys-\ntemic risk), our model considerably reduces the scope for the possible underestimation of\ncredit risk in the banking system.\n\nAdditionally to the SystemicCreditRisk model, M-PRESS-CreditRisk consists of the\nmodule that generates multi-risk-factor, multi-country stress scenarios designed for our\napplication in NiGEM and the satellite macro-econometric model that helps to translate\nthese scenarios into the credit portfolio model. As to the policy applications, we show how\nthe risk metrics derived from the combination of the portfolio model and scenario analysis\ncan inform supervisors\u00e2 judgment about the level of capital needed in the banking system\nto cover both expected and unexpected losses under normal and adverse macroeconomic\nconditions (baseline and stress scenarios, respectively). To this end, the framework pro-\nvides model-based measures of both bank-level and systemic credit risk that supervisors\nmay use in their assessment of the whole chain of capital adequacy: starting with dynamic\nloan loss provisioning, proceeding with minimum capital requirements, including Pillar 2\nadd-ons, and \u010f\u0179nishing with macroprudential bu\u010f\u0179ers that address structural systemic risk.\nWe also illustrate how the framework may be put into practice, using a sample of 12\nsystemically important German banks and utilizing a baseline and three stress scenarios\n(oil crisis, \u010f\u0179nancial crisis, and \u010f\u0179scal contraction). Based on the results, we argue that the\nactual capital levels and the capital needs calculated with additional regard to systemic\ncredit risk may di\u010f\u0179er considerably. Moreover, although the aggregate capital \u010f\u0179gures\nsuggest that there is enough capital in the system as a whole to withstand severe adverse\nmacroeconomic scenarios, the analysis on the bank level indicates that the distribution of\ncapital in the banking system might be suboptimal from a systemic point of view. This\nfollows from the observation that a number of banks show excess capital compared to\nthe overall requirement calibrated to the systemic risk metrics from our model, whereas\nanother banks\u00e2 capital base needs improvement.\nIn the worst case, \u010f\u0179ve banks would\nhave di\u010f\u0179culties satisfying the combined model-based micro- and macroprudential capital\nrequirements.\n\nAt the end, we must emphasize that our numerical results should be treated with\ncaution because our model is subject to a number of constraints. First, it only focuses on\ncredit risk, whereas regulatory requirements also address other risk sources such as market\nand operational risk. Second, our model concentrates on only one channel of systemic risk\npropagation represented by the correlated bank exposures; contagion among the banks or\nother second-round e\u010f\u0179ects are not considered here. Finally, M-PRESS-CreditRisk links a\nnumber of approaches together which introduces an additional layer of model risk.\n\nBearing these caveats in mind, the risk measures generated in the coherent stress\ntesting framework of M-PRESS-CreditRisk may help supervisors think of di\u010f\u0179erent micro-\nand macroprudential capital instruments as a logically linked chain of requirements and\nsupport the calibration of bank-speci\u010f\u0179c capital charges.\n\n\nReferences\n\nAas, K.

The\nexpected value and the variance of X are given by E[X] = k\u00ce\u0105 and var(X) = k\u00ce\u01052. This\nleads to the following method of moments parameter estimators:\n\n\u00cbk =\n\n\nand \u00cb\u00ce\u0105 =\n\n\nwhere \u00c2\u017bx and s2 are the sample mean and variance, respectively. The objective function\nfor MLE can be obtained from Equation (A.1).\n\nLet X be a gamma random variable with parameters k and \u00ce\u0105. Then, the normalized\ngamma variable Y := X/E[X] has unity expectation, and its distribution function can be\ndescribed using only the variance: var(Y ) = var(X)/E[X] = 1/k = \u00ce\u0105.\n\n\nA.2 Basics of copulas\n\nA comprehensive introduction to the copula theory may be found in Nelsen (1999); Joe\n(1997). The gist of the copula concept can be explained in a few paragraphs, though.\nConsider a joint cumulative distribution function (cdf) of a random vector. This comprises\ninformation about each single random variable and information about the interdependen-\ncies between the random variables. We can separate these two pieces of information in a\nformal way. That is, each joint cdf can be expressed in terms of its univariate marginal\ndistributions and a unique function \u00e2 called copula \u00e2 that describes its dependence struc-\nture. The Sklar\u00e2s theorem formalizes this idea (for proof see, for instance, Nelsen, 1999,\n\nTheorem A.1 (Sklar )\n\nLet H be a continuous joint cdf of a random vector (X1, . . . , XN ) with univariate\nmarginal cdfs FXi with i = 1, . . . , N . There exists a unique copula function C :\n[0, 1]N (cid:55)\u00e2 [0, 1] such as for all xi \u00e2 R\u00e2\u015e{\u00e2\u00e2,\u00e2} with i = 1, . . . , N the following holds\n\nH(x1, . . . , xN ) = C(cid:0)FX1(x1), . . . , FXN (xN )(cid:1).\n\nThe converse is also true: given a copula C :\nFXi with i = 1, . . . , N the function H in Equation (A.2) is an N -dimensional cdf with\nunivariate margins FX1, . . . , FXN .\n\nA copula itself is a joint cdf on the N -dimensional unit hypercube. It has uniform mar-\ngins that represent the cdfs of the probability-integral transforms of the original random\nvariables given by U := FX(X):\n\nC(u1, . . . , uN ) = H(cid:0)F \u00e21\n\n\n(uN )(cid:1),\n\n\nXN\n\n\nA copula is invariant under strictly monotone transformations of the random variables.\nThe same is true of copula-based dependence measures. We de\u010f\u0179ne two such (bivariate)\nmeasures: Kendall\u00e2s rank correlation and coe\u010f\u0179cient of tail dependence.\n\nDe\u010f\u0179nition A.1 (Kendall\u00e2s rank correlation)\n\nLet (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) be two iid random vectors. Then Kendall\u00e2s rank correlation,\ndenoted \u010e , is given by\n\n\n\nThe \u010f\u0179rst term in Equation (A.3) is the probability of concordance of the two random\nvectors. The second term is the probability of discordance.\n\nThe invariance of Kendall\u00e2s \u010e to transformations of the marginals is an advantage\nover the Pearson\u00e2s product-moment correlation. The Pearson\u00e2s \u010e only describes the linear\nrelationship between variables; it measures how well the random variables cluster around a\nlinear function. Therefore, \u010e is a natural measure of association for multivariate normally\nand, more generally, elliptically distributed random variables. For other multivariate\ndistributions, measures of concordance like \u010e are more appropriate because they are more\ngeneral and re\u010f\u0179ect the degree to which random variables cluster around a monotone\n\n\nfunction (with linear functions being only one of the special cases).\n\nDe\u010f\u0179nition A.2 (Coe\u010f\u0179cients of tail dependence)\n\n\n\n\n(u)(cid:9)\n(u)(cid:9) ,\n\nLet X1 and X2 be random variables with cdfs FX1 and FX2. The coe\u010f\u0179cients of upper\nand lower tail dependence of X1 and X2, denoted \u00ce\u0165U and \u00ce\u0165L, respectively, are\n\n\u00ce\u0165U = lim\n\u00ce\u0165L = lim\n\nprovided that limits \u00ce\u0165U , \u00ce\u0165L \u00e2 [0, 1] exist.\nIf \u00ce\u0165(\u00c2\u02c7) \u00e2\u013d 0, X1 and X2 are said to be\nasymptotically dependent (in the corresponding tail). If \u00ce\u0165(\u00c2\u02c7) = 0, X1 and X2 are said\nto be asymptotically independent (in the corresponding tail).\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to de\u010f\u0179nition A.2, extreme realizations of two asymptotically tail-dependent\nrandom variables tend to occur simultaneously. By the same token, asymptotical inde-\npendence in the tails means that, regardless of whether two random variables are linearly\ncorrelated or not, extreme realizations occur independently for each variable.\n\nOften, using copulas to construct multivariate models with desirable dependence prop-\nerties is more convenient than specifying cdfs. It is especially true if a copula, but not\nthe corresponding cdf, can be expressed in the form of a simple formula. Copulas of one\nspecial class \u00e2 Archimedean copulas \u00e2 have particulary simple analytical representation\nin terms of what is known as a generating function, denoted \u010e, and the general inverse of\nthe generating function, denoted \u010e\u00e21:\n\nC(u1, . . . , uN ) = \u010e\u00e21(cid:0)\u010e(u1) + \u00c2\u02c7\u00c2\u02c7\u00c2\u02c7 + \u010e(uN )(cid:1).\n\n\nTo give rise to a proper Archimedean copula, a generating function must satisfy certain\n\nArchimedean copulas have a number of appealing features that make them popular\nin \u010f\u0179nance and risk management. Their simple analytical representation facilitates their\nuse in high-dimensional portfolio models. These copulas are \u010f\u0179exible in capturing various\ndependence structures, including tail dependence, which makes them suitable for modeling\nextreme events. For a number of families of Archimedean copulas, e\u010f\u0179cient sampling\nalgorithms have been developed, too.\n\nAt the same time, the permutation symmetry, stemming from the exchangeability of\nthe summands in Equation (A.6), constrains the practical applicability of Archimedean\ncopulas. The permutation symmetry means that the dependence among all components\nis identical; all sub-copulas of the same dimension are equal. For those models, where\nthe exchangeability of the marginals poses too strong a restriction, a more general and\n\u010f\u0179exible class of nested Archimedean copulas should be considered.\n\nNested Archimedean copulas are often called hierarchical Archimedean copulas, or\nHACs. A HAC represents a hierarchical structure of sub-copulas, where di\u010f\u0179erent sub-\ncopulas may be de\u010f\u0179ned for separate groups of marginals. For instance, a copula with \u010f\u0179ve\n57The inverse of the generator function must be (at least) N -monotone on the interval [0,\u00e2). This\nis why Laplace transforms of positive random variables, being completely monotone functions, are often\napplied to construct Archimedean copulas.\n\n\narguments and a structure of sub-copulas schematically represented as (((1, 2), 3), (4, 5))\ntakes the following form:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a partially nested HAC with three sub-copulas: one sub-copula is a fully nested\nHAC that joins arguments 1, 2 and 3; other two sub-copulas are the regular two-dimensional\nArchimedean copulas that join 1 with 2 and 4 with 5, respectively.\n\nA HAC can adopt arbitrarily elaborate structures. It may be either fully or partially\nnested. The generator functions within a HAC can come either from di\u010f\u0179erent generator\nfamilies or from just a single generator family with di\u010f\u0179erent parameters for its sub-copulas.\nIn this paper, we construct a HAC making use of the generator function of the Gumbel\nfamily of Archimedean copulas.\n\nIn what follows we consider, without loss of generality, the two-dimensional Gumbel\ncopula. This copula exhibits asymmetric dependence structure by putting more proba-\nbility mass on the upper tail. Its generating function is given by \u010e(u) = (\u00e2 ln(u))\u00ce\u00b8 and\nthe bivariate copula function reads\n\n\nC Gu\n\n\u00ce\u00b8\n\n\nParameter 1 \u00e2\u00a4 \u00ce\u00b8 < \u00e2 controls the degree of dependence between two random variables.\nFor \u00ce\u00b8 = 1 the variables are independent; they become perfectly dependent as \u00ce\u00b8 grows\nlarge. For any \u00ce\u00b8 > 1, the random variables joined by a Gumbel copula are positively\nassociated and asymptotically dependent in the upper tail. For a Gumbel copula, the\npopulation versions of Kendall\u00e2s tau is given by \u010e Gu = (\u00ce\u00b8 \u00e2 1)/\u00ce\u00b8 and the coe\u010f\u0179cient of\nU = 2 \u00e2 21/\u00ce\u00b8. The lower tail dependence coe\u010f\u0179cient\nupper tail dependence is given by \u00ce\u0165Gu\nis zero.\n\n.\n\nAs to the copula estimation, the \u00e2HAC package\u00e2 in R programming environment\ndocumented in Okhrin and Ristig (2012) provides a multi-stage MLE procedure, which\nsimultaneously determines the parameter and the structure of a HAC. The algorithm\nendows the estimator with the usual asymptotic properties and is less computationally\nintensive than a regular one-step MLE. It can be summarized as follows: Consider M\nrandom variables. For all possible pairs of these variables, parameters \u00ce\u00b8 of bivariate\nGumbel copulas are estimated using regular MLE. The pair with the strongest dependence\n(the largest \u00ce\u00b8) is then combined by its estimated copula to a new pseudo variable \u00e2 the\n\u010f\u0179rst node in the copula hierarchy. The program reiterates the whole procedure until all\nM\u00e21 parameters of bivariate copula nodes are estimated. To allow for more sophisticated\nstructures, the variables of two successive nodes are aggregated if the di\u010f\u0179erence between\ncorresponding parameters \u00ce\u00b8 is smaller than a \u010f\u0179xed small threshold which we set to 0.5.\nThis allows for marginal copulas with more than two arguments. The chosen value of 0.5\nmakes it possible to neglect small di\u010f\u0179erences in the strength of dependence, preserving\na reasonably granular copula structure. For further information on the methods and\nchallenges of estimating Archimedean copulas in high dimensions, we refer the reader to\n\n\nA.3 Details on approximation of EADs, LGDs and PDs\n\nIf a bank has more than one credit exposures to a particular borrower, the EAD equals the\ntotal exposure to this borrower. The on-balance sheet exposure is taken at its book value.\nBy contrast, lenders convert their o\u010f\u0179-balance sheet exposure stemming from derivatives\ninto credit equivalents using appropriate credit conversion factors. They report other\no\u010f\u0179-balance sheet credit exposure such as \u00e2guarantees extended\u00e2 at its book value.\n\nTo compute LGD, we take into account the following information about credit risk\nmitigation techniques: (i) collateral posted by the borrower and (ii) guarantees provided\nby other banks. For the secured (overcollateralized) part of the exposure we assign the\nLGD of 35%. For the remaining unsecured part we \u010f\u0179x the LGD at 45% (see sections 287\nand 295 in BCBS, 2006). As for the guarantees, we scale down the LGD for that part\nof the exposure for which a guarantee is available by the ratio of the guarantor\u00e2s PD to\nthe borrower\u00e2s PD. Ideally, simulation of a double default, i.e. a possible default of the\nguarantor given the default of the borrower, should be performed. But this is di\u010f\u0179cult\nto implement because no estimates for the probability of joint default of the borrower-\nguarantor pairs are available. Thus, we only model the borrowers\u00e2s default, but scale\ndown the corresponding LGD to account for the risk mitigation technique (see sections\nto the guarantor (g) should be equal to the expected loss from the secured exposure to\nthe borrower (b): LGDg \u00c2\u02c7 P Dg = LGDb \u00c2\u02c7 P Db. Then, we compute the adjusted LGD\nas LGDb = LGDg \u00c2\u02c7 P Dg/P Db, with LGDg = 45% if P Dg < P Db. If, on the contrary,\nP Dg > P Db, we do not consider the guarantee at all (see section 301 in BCBS, 2006). If\nan exposure is backed by more than one guarantor, the median guarantors\u00e2 PD is taken.\nFor the credit exposures backed by both collateral and a guarantee, we take both into\naccount subject to the LGD \u010f\u0179oor of 0%.\n\nThe PDs are taken as reported by the lenders. They originate from the lenders\u00e2\ninternal rating systems. For a given rating system, the PDs of two borrowers only di\u010f\u0179er\nfrom each other if the borrowers belong to di\u010f\u0179erent rating categories. For all PDs we\nA few reported PDs that exceed this ceiling are set to 100%, which means a sure default of\nthe borrower. The same borrowers may be rated di\u010f\u0179erently by di\u010f\u0179erent banks. Therefore,\nif multiple PDs are available for the same borrower, we take the maximum value. For\nborrowers for which no estimates of PDs are available at all, we take the median PD of all\nborrowers belonging to the same group (sector/country/region). As an exception, missing\nPDs for banks are set to the median PD for the banking sector across all countries.\n\n\nA.4 Tables and \u010f\u0179gures\n\nTable A.1: Descriptive statistics for the 12 systemically important German banks\n\nVariable\n\nAmount (ebillion or %)\n\nNumber of banks\nTotal assets\nPercentage of total assets of all German banks\nTotal credit exposure from the credit register\nTotal RWA\nTotal RWA: credit risk\nTotal RWA: credit register\nTotal capital\nTotal CET1 capital\nTotal CET1 to total RWA ratio\n\n\nNote: Data as of 2013Q4.
