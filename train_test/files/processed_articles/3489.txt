    "abstract": "Abstract\nAlthough sociology education began a century ago in Turkey, sociology is considered a scientific discipline rather than a\nprofession in which graduates can earn money. The primary aim of this article is to identify the essence of this problem\nin sociology education based on students' and sociologists' views. To achieve the study objectives, a phenomenological\nstudy based on standpoint theory was designed and conducted with 25 students and 20 working sociologists. The findings\nreveal that sociology education is quite far removed from being considered a professional education. Theoretical courses\nwithout field studies are not in accordance with the requirements of both the public and private sectors. Students and\nsociologists are quite romantic regarding what sociology is and what sociologists do. Students mostly begin the study of\nsociology involuntarily and without a clear understanding of the discipline. Sometimes students find themselves in a paradox\nor dilemma: Although the knowledge and skills they have developed during their sociology education enable students to\nexpress themselves effectively and understand social events more comprehensively, the risk of unemployment is a severe\nthreat. Even if they are employed, graduates are disappointed because they are not prepared to conduct the tasks that their\njobs demand. Students assess these activities as social work and thus inappropriate. To solve the problems of sociology as a\nprofession in society and as an academic field in the university, both problems must be clearly defined and programs must be\ncarefully reconfigured to meet the demands of both society and sociologists.\n",

Intellectuals of political and administrative bod-\nies preferred Westernization as their primary tool as Turkey\nmoved away from its society's own traditional institutions.\nWhen introducing social and cultural innovations to society,\nOttoman intellectuals were deeply affected by French politi-\ncal and social thought. According to Sezer (1988), Paris was\nthe cynosure of intellectuals who spoke against existing gov-\nernment while shaping their political and ideological views.\nZiya G\u00f6kalp was the most important politician among them\nand was later accepted as the founder of sociology in Turkey;\nG\u00f6kalp gave sociology lectures at Istanbul University in\n1914. G\u00f6kalp was also the father of the basic principles of\nthe newly established Republic of Turkey in 1923. Ziya\nG\u00f6kalp introduced positivism to Mustafa Kemal, who insti-\ntuted major reforms to convert society to modern Western\ntraditions beginning with changing the alphabet from Arabic\nto Latin, changing the Muslim calendar to the Gregorian cal-\nendar and changing Islamic canon law Sharia to civic law.\nG\u00f6kalp's (1988) book, Main Principles of Turkishness,\nfacilitated the definition of a nation of Turks. When the\nOttoman Empire with its multiethnic structure was becoming\na nation state, G\u00f6kalp's sociological definition, that \"citizens\nof Turkey are considered Turks,\" established a practical\nmanner with which to resolve questions regarding the ethnic\norigins of society and was applied by Mustafa Kemal when\ndeclaring the Republic of Turkey.\nContrary to economically based sociological analysis of\nsocial structure such as Marxism, Durkheim sociology is\nwidely accepted and followed in Turkey because of Ziya\nG\u00f6kalp, who himself was an ideologist of the Order and\nProgress Party, whose members changed the political system\nof the country from a monarchy to a republic. The primary\nslogan developed by Ziya G\u00f6kalp was the articulation of\nthree main concepts: \"Islamization, Westernization and\nTurkification.\" As a sociologist, he proposed an amalgama-\ntion to solve the identity problems of the citizens of the new\n1Ankara University, Turkey\nCorresponding Author:\nAytul Kasapoglu, Professor of Sociology, Department of Sociology, Ankara\nEmail: kasap@humanity.ankara.edu.tr\nProblems With Sociology Education in\nTurkey on Its 100th Anniversary\nAytul Kasapoglu1\n Keywords\nsociology, education, phenomenology, Turkey\n2 SAGE Open\nnation state by saying, \"I am from the Turkish nation; I\nbelong to Western civilization as well as Islam.\" (G\u00f6kalp,\n1914, the Ottoman Empire was certainly not a modern indus-\ntrial society that required sociology to solve its problems.\nHowever, Ziya G\u00f6kalp considered Durkheim's sociology\nand its communitarian approach appropriate for Turkey,\nwhich was primarily traditional and patriarchal. Being a\ncommunitarian instead of an individualist such as Durkheim\nwas politically preferable in Turkey and later garnered many\nsupporters as opposed to other sociology traditions such as\nPrens Sabahattin's, who was a representative of Le Play's\nsociology, which is more decentralized and individualistic\n(Parla, 2006). The history of sociology in Turkey falls pri-\nmarily into two periods or stages. The first period was influ-\nenced by Ziya G\u00f6kalp and Prens Sabahattin and was called\nthe constitutionalist period. The second period reached from\nthe Second World War to the present (Mardin, 1974; Tanyol,\nAccording to Mardin (1983), the first period was more\npolitical whereas the second period has primarily been based\non data collected from field studies conducted by universi-\nselves as responsible for saving the empire from collapse\nwere called Young Turks (Jon Turks); the Young Turks\napproached issues in terms of a doctor\u00adpatient relationship,\nacting as social physicians. In fact, at that time, developed\nWestern countries were also defining the Ottoman Empire as\na sick man. This first period of sociology was full of contro-\nversy among intellectuals who defended progress as modern-\nists and the status quo as conservatives. The Young Turks\nconsidered themselves accelerants, transforming society\nfrom traditional to modern with the help of the positive sci-\nences; these intellectuals considered sociology their most\nimportant tool. In fact, two political movements were com-\npeting with one another and later developed as two different\nsociological traditions in Turkey. Whereas one tradition\nadopted the Le Play school's principles, the other tradition\nadopted Durkheim sociology, both of which originated in\nFrance (Dogan, 2006). During the Ottoman Empire, intel-\nlectuals were strongly affected by France in terms of culture\nand the social sciences whereas bureaucrats collaborated\nwith Germany to make military progress.\nThe Young Turks believed that translating sociology\nbooks was quite important in changing the society from tra-\nditional to modern. Westernization was the primary target for\nimproving the Turkish society, and the Young Turks required\navailable prescriptions. Therefore, intellectuals began to\ntranslate sociology books into the Ottoman language.\nSometimes the translators adapted the books to the condi-\ntions of the Turkish society by interpretations (Parla, 2006).\nZiya G\u00f6kalp, who was the theoretical and ideological leader\nof the Progress and Development Party, and the Young Turks\nbegan presenting sociology lectures based on these trans-\nlated books in 1914 at Istanbul University and began\npublication of a sociology journal. However, at the end of the\nFirst World War, Ziya G\u00f6kalp was fired by the invasion\nforces who occupied Istanbul as the capital of the Ottoman\nEmpire and deported him to Malta/Cyprus as punishment in\n1918. Later, professors such as Mehmet Izzet and Necmeddin\nSadak were unable to regain the same popularity as the first\nestablished department of sociology in Turkey. However,\nMehmet Izzet is important as the author of the first sociology\ntextbook for secondary schools (Dever, 2014).\nAnother sociologist made significant contributions to\nTurkey's history of thought following Ziya G\u00f6kalp at\nIstanbul University. Himi Ziya Ulken studied human geogra-\nphy and philosophy before joining the sociology department,\nin which he was a professor of sociology between 1940 and\n1950. His ideas were primarily Marxist although his philoso-\nphy changed when he moved to Ankara to work in the\nFaculty in Divinity in 1960. His book on refusing historical\nmaterialism was the primary evidence indicating Ulken's\nradical transformation.\nLater, holistic (Durkheim) and particularistic (Weber)\nviews competed in different faculties of Istanbul University.\nThus, after the foundation years, sociology in Turkey became\nquite enriched and proliferated by developing two schools.\nmember of the Faculty of Economics, wrote a book called\nMoral World of Economic Disorganization. Because of this\nstudy, he is referred to as Turkey's Weber, and his book is\nconsidered a milestone of sociology in Turkey. This tradition\nwas continued by Ahmet Guner Sayar (2006), who was a stu-\ndent of Ulgener.\nin addition to followers of Durkheim at the Istanbul\nUniversity Faculty of Letters who evaluated the social struc-\nture of Turkey from the perspective of the \"Asian Type of\nProduction\" and the \"historical specificity\" principle of\nMarxism. These philosophies helped to explain why there\nwas a different infrastructure in Turkey in terms of a produc-\ntion type of economy that did not result in the development\nof a capitalist system.\nIt should also be noted that these two traditions of sociol-\nogy were both interested in the difference between Turkey's\nsocioeconomic structure and Western societies that had suc-\nceeded in shifting from traditional to modern or from agri-\ncultural to industrial in general and/or from feudalism to\ncapitalism in Marxist terms. To achieve this aim by follow-\nof thought and that the factors that determine individual\nthought lead to the reproduction of traditionalism. Sezer\nthe most eminent Turkish novelists, studied the social struc-\nture of Turkey to show the uniqueness of the feudalism that\nwas peculiar to Turkey and Eastern despotic countries based\non the Asiatic Type of Production.\nUnfortunately, after its foundation period, sociology again\nfound itself in crisis in 1947 during the Republican Period.\nKasapoglu 3\nTurkey's first sociology department in the Republican era at\nAnkara was closed when professors were accused of being\ncommunists. Although the professors were not found guilty\nand were freed, education in the department and sociology as\na discipline in Turkey were deeply affected. The expectations\nof Turkish sociology, particularly in terms of proliferation,\ncould not be realized. Field-based studies on the social struc-\nture of Turkey were interrupted. More importantly, the insti-\ntutionalization of sociology in Turkey failed because of the\npolitical effects of the Second World War and Turkey's inter-\nnal reflections on existing government policies. The\nDepartment of Sociology in the Faculty of Letters was abol-\nished, and professors who were educated in the United States\nsuch as Behice Boran, Niyazi Berkes, and their research\nassistant, Fatma Takingol (Basaran); Muzaffer Sherif from\npsychology; and Mediha Berkes from anthropology were all\nfired (Kasapoglu, 1991). During their short academic lives at\n(Yurt ve Dunya), published by Behice Boran and Niyazi\nBerkes, and Steps (Adimlar), published by Behice Boran,\nwere important contributions in terms of \"public sociology\"\nDuring the planned period of Turkey beginning in the\n1960s, the establishment of the State Planning Institution\nwas a milestone for sociologists. One of the students of\nBehice Boran, whose name was Mubeccel Belik Kiray\n(1964), conducted a study similar to Boran's study on the\nsocial structure of a small town called Eregli to determine\nsocioeconomic changes because of industrialization.\nHowever, those studies are mostly defined as apolitical as\nwell as quantitative, influenced by American sociology\nbecause those new state institutions and universities pro-\nvided scholarships for sociologists, particularly in American\nOther important events in sociology education were the\nestablishment of Middle East Technical University (1959),\nUnfortunately, Turkey experienced a military intervention in\n1980, and the new Higher Education Law redesigned all dis-\nciplines, including sociology curricula. The process of pro-\nliferation was certainly interrupted by imposing the identical\ncurriculum on all departments. The number of university and\nsociology departments has increased and reached 104 by\nFrom its inception, sociology in Turkey always had prob-\nlems with the identity of the discipline. Because sociology\nwas politically preferred and considered a science, sociology\ncourses were added to secondary school curricula in 1929,\nand students who studied sociology were sufficiently confi-\ndent to at least teach in secondary or high schools. Until the\n1990s, there were a limited number of sociology departments\nin old universities, and their graduates were easily employed.\nBecause of Turkey's European Union Entrance project, the\nnumber of universities increased, as did sociology depart-\nments. Furthermore, sociology departments in distance\neducation began to add 14,000 sociologists each year.\nCurrently, 19,000 students have studied sociology; however,\n(Kasapoglu,2015). Therefore, the risk of unemployment for\nsociologists, particularly by the state, is a serious problem for\nboth students and their parents.\nAs indicated by the American Sociological Association,\nsociologists have three major alternatives to find employ-\nment after graduation. These areas are teaching, research,\nand sociological practice (cited in Kasapoglu, 2015). The\nmajority of sociology graduates work as teachers in second-\nary schools, vocational schools, preparatory schools, and as\nfaculty in the universities of Turkey. In addition to sociology\ndepartments, other disciplines such as law, business admin-\nistration, education, social anthropology, divinity, social\nwork, medicine, and nursing require sociology courses and\nhire sociologists. Although teaching was widely perceived\nas satisfactory because teaching is secure and garners\nrespect in society, the teaching profession has changed, par-\nticularly for secondary and preparatory school teachers.\nCorrosion observed in the teaching profession in general is\nalso true for secondary school sociology teachers (Ayalp,\nEmployment in the private or public sector as a researcher\nis the second most common career option for sociologists.\nHowever, if teachers want to be promoted or work under\nmore secure conditions, they should conduct research and\npublish their results because \"publish or perish\" is the core\nprinciple of academia. Therefore, teaching also requires\nresearch skills. Finding a job on a research team in a research\ninstitute, which can be governmental or nongovernmental at\nthe local or central level, is quite desirable for many sociolo-\ngists in many countries, including Turkey. In fact, when soci-\nologists work as researchers in any field of expertise related\nto the environment or health or human resources, they can\nfind themselves in some confusion regarding their identity,\nidentifying as a researcher rather than a sociologist.\nAlthough the percentage of sociologists who are doing\napplied or clinical sociology is quite limited in Turkey, the\nmajority of sociologists in developed countries earn their liv-\ning by applying their knowledge to solve social problems.\nAlthough their work is quite close to research, sociology\nextends beyond research activities and therefore is consid-\nered a sociological practice.\nPolicy-making and administration, other opportunities in\ngovernment, and opportunities in business are additional\noptions for sociological practice. Local and central adminis-\ntrations require sociologists when developing urban transfor-\nmation, housing transformation, health, education, and law\nenforcement policies. Certainly, sociologists work in these\nfields with professionals such as engineers, architects, urban\nplanners, lawyers, and physicians. Sometimes sociologists\ncan be the head of a project, which occurred in the assess-\nment of Turkey's largest investment project of water in 1990.\nSociologists can also work in human resources, sales, and\n4 SAGE Open\nbusiness administration departments as planners or analysts\nalthough these positions are scarce when compared with the\nnumber of sociologists in Turkey.\nResearch Problem\nAlthough sociology education celebrates its 100th anniver-\nsary in Turkey, sociology is not recognized as a profession in\nthe Turkish society but is considered an academic discipline\nand career. Unfortunately, professors are unaware of the\nproblems of graduates and continue to apply curricula that\nomit the skills and knowledge necessary to address the real\nneeds of society.\nObjectives\nAlthough the primary research is more comprehensive and\ndetailed, including quantitative survey results gleaned from a\nrepresentative sample of students from all over Turkey, this\narticle is limited to identifying answer to the following\nquestions:\na. What is the essence of the problems with sociology\neducation in Turkey?\nb. When sociology and sociology education are consid-\nered, is there any difference between the views of stu-\ndents and working sociologists?\nc. What should be done to solve the existing problems of\nsociology education?\nMethod\nIn this qualitative study, standpoint theory (Ramazanoglu &\nHolland, 2002) was deemed appropriate based on phenome-\nnological tradition; as proposed, standpoint theory is gener-\nally superior to positivist traditions because it is critical to\ndichotomies and focuses on process and dynamism.\nStandpoint theory identifies differences among similar sides\nor components. In our case, although sociologists as students\nand employed sociologists are different, they are in a con-\ntinuum with one another. Comparisons are made between\nthem rather than with other disciplines or professionals. In\nthis study, it is assumed that there is no one unique type of\nsociologist to compare with other professionals such as psy-\nchologists or social workers; it is therefore assumed that\nthere are differences among sociologists, and comparisons\nare made between sociologists who are of different statuses,\nsuch as student and worker.\nParticipants\nThe study group comprised 25 students who are studying\nsociology at various universities (Middle East Technical\nUniversity, Hacettepe University, Ankara University, Gazi\nUniversity, and Yildirim Beyazit University) and 20 sociolo-\ngists who are working in several municipalities and ministries\nin Ankara, the capital city of Turkey. Senior students who are\nin their last year were intentionally selected because they are\npresumed to be more experienced and knowledgeable regard-\ning the conditions and the problems of sociology education\nand employment. Interviews were also conducted with soci-\nologists who have at least 5 years of work experience.\nTherefore, \"purposive\" and \"theoretical\" sampling tech-\nniques (Creswell, 1998) were used to achieve the study\nobjectives.\nData Analysis\nThe design of this qualitative research is based on principles\nof the phenomenological tradition (Moustakas, 1994;\nnological principles. For example, first, recorded interviews\nwere listened to carefully before the interpretations were writ-\nten. Then, significant statements were determined and catego-\nrized into negative and positive statements for comparison.\nMeanings were also grouped into four thematic clusters that\nwere common to all of the participants' transcripts.\nThe data used in this article were part of a more compre-\nhensive quantitative study supported by theAnkara University\nResearch Fund. The qualitative research was designed to sup-\nport and validate quantitative data derived from a nationwide\nties located in different parts of Turkey. In this article, a short,\nunstructured questionnaire was developed after applying the\nresults of the quantitative data. The open-ended questions\nincluded \"What is your definition of sociology?\" \"How did\nyou decide to study sociology?\" \"What is your experience\nhere in this department?\" \"What meaning does sociology\nhave in your life?\" and \"What do you feel about your future\nafter graduation?\" The sociologists were asked similar ques-\ntions when they were interviewed.\nAfter obtaining their oral consent, face-to-face interviews\nwere conducted during data collection. Interviews lasted at\nleast half an hour, and most lasted approximately an hour. All\ninterviews were recorded with the participants' permission. As\na component of the research problem, researchers were careful\nnot to influence the interviewee's responses and were particu-\nlarly aware of setting aside all prejudgments by bracketing for-\nmer experiences, as suggested by Husserl (1931). Interview\ndata were deciphered immediately by the researchers to ensure\nthat no important point was lost. The validity of the research\nwas ensured by reviewing the literature and bracketing past\nexperiences. Taking field notes, selecting an appropriate sam-\npling in accordance with the study purposes, and interviewing\nuntilreachingthesaturationpoint(receivingrepetitiveanswers)\nare also worthy of mention (Meadows & Morse, 2001).\nFindings\nA total of 267 significant statements extracted from inter-\nviews with 25 students and 20 sociologists were quite com-\nprehensive and complex. To present data in a reader friendly\nKasapoglu 5\nform, some statements are presented in the appendix (see\nTables A1 to A4). A summary of significant statements\ngrouped in thematic clusters is presumed to render the find-\nings more understandable. In this section, the findings of the\nphenomenological study are presented based first on com-\nparing the thematic clusters of students' positive and nega-\ntive statements (Tables 1 and 2), including their formulated\nmeanings, and then presenting the data obtained from work-\ning sociologists (Tables 3 and 4).\nThe four themes derived from the findings are the mean-\ning of sociology, sociology education, the effects of sociol-\nogy education and thoughts about the future. To reach the\nessence of the problem, these four themes were used to com-\npare data gathered from students and working sociologists.\nAt first, it appeared crucial that significant negative state-\nments of both students and sociologists were longer and\nmore numerous. Although similar statements were deleted,\nthere were nevertheless many more significant negative\nstatements (183) than positive statements (84; see Tables A3\nand A4 of the appendix).\nThe findings presented in Table 1 reveal that sociology\nstudents have positive feelings regarding sociology because\nstudents attribute a higher stature to sociology by saying that\nsociology is more than a profession and that their lifestyle is\nin harmony with sociology. Their satisfaction with the edu-\ncation they receive is also consistent with their impressions\nregarding sociology, and students reported that they had the\nopportunity to go into the field to understand society.\nStudents also admitted that sociology education had changed\ntheir personalities and that they are happy with these changes.\nStudents believe that they will find a job as a sociologist and\nare thus quite optimistic about their futures.\nSociology students' negative significant statements, pre-\nsented in Table 2, show that the status of sociology is unfortu-\nnately not as high as expected. Like society in general, students\ndid not know much about sociology and lacked an understand-\ning of sociology when they began their studies. In fact, if their\nscores had been higher, they would have preferred to study\npsychology, which is considered a health profession, with spe-\ncial departments in state hospitals and other related organiza-\ntions in Turkey. Students also blamed sociology professors for\nnot being objective in their lectures and imposing their own\nideologies on students. Students were critical that their educa-\ntion remained theoretical without allowing the transfer of their\nknowledge and skills to the field. Because students do not\nbelieve that they belong to either sociology or sociology edu-\ncation, they isolate themselves from any type of interaction\nthat could result in changing their personalities or relation-\nships. Students also claim that because of their sociology edu-\ncation, their relationships with their families are not as good as\nin the past. Families worry about unemployment and blame\nthe students for not behaving like responsible adults. Families\nthink that at least by working hard and getting high scores, the\nstudents can major or minor in psychology or public adminis-\ntration to guarantee their futures.\nTurkey's economic conditions are not good (Boratav,\n2011), particularly when considering the unemployment rate\namong the young. According to International Labour\nOrganization (ILO in 2011) data, the unemployment rate is\nquite high and reached 24% among university graduates\n(Kasapoglu, 2015). The findings in Table 3 show that some\nsociologists expressed being happy because they are doing\nuseful things for society. They also supposed that their edu-\ncation enriched them and prepared them for the work they\ndo. Their desire for a master's degree in sociology also shows\nthat they want to improve their knowledge and skills and that\nthey are optimistic about their future careers.\nAlthough optimists exist, the majority of sociologists inter-\nviewed reported negative perceptions regarding sociology as\npresented in Table 4 and Table A4 (of the appendix). First, like\nthe students interviewed, the sociologists began to study with-\nout consciously choosing this discipline.According to the soci-\nologists, the objectives of sociology curricula were limited to\nacademic sociology. Therefore, their expectations when they\nstarted to work were unfortunately quite far from the condi-\ntions they faced. They also noticed that the tasks they had to\nperform required knowledge of the administrative system of\nTurkey. The sociologists claimed that because they were not\nfamiliar with the social structure of Turkey or the components\nof its social institutions, they had to enhance their knowledge\nwith a master's degree in the field of public management. The\nmajority of sociologists in Turkey prefer to work in the public\nsector as government officers with scheduled hours and job\nsecurity. These sociologists prefer not to go out in the field to\nTable 1.

Therefore, they are realistic when they admit\nthat they are alienated. Because of their training, they guard\nagainst being perceived and treated as social workers. The soci-\nologists believe that sociology is superior to social work in\nterms of the scientific nature of the discipline. However, they\nare simultaneously impressed with social workers' job defini-\ntions and salaries. In Turkey, psychologists and social workers\nare considered health personnel, and they earn more money\nthan other staff who do similar work in the same office. Because\nof this inequality, some sociologists began distance education\nin social work to obtain the same status and salary as social\nworkers. All of these phenomena may be interpreted as a type\nof the \"corrosion of character\" that was proposed by Sennet\n(1998) to define the workers' dilemma. Here in Turkey, soci-\nologists are not considered to be sociologists either by them-\nselves or by society. They are always pessimistic regarding\ntheir future although they are employed.\nDiscussion\nSociology education and its problems have persisted for\nyears in Turkey (Coskun, 1991; Kasapoglu, Kavas, Kili\u00e7,\n\u00c7inar, & Kilikbicen, 2014; Kasapoglu, Kaya, & Ecevit,\nTurkey, sociology has had identity problems. What sociol-\nogy is or what sociologists do remains unclear. Another\ndimension of the identity problem is people who are not\neducated in sociology but act as if they are sociologists in\nsociety. For example, some social scientists and in particular\neminent politicians and journalists claim that they are soci-\nologists when they are talking on TV or writing for the\nmedia. Although these pseudo-sociologists become popular\nwith the public, real sociologists react negatively. If these\npseudo-sociologists are considered sociologists, then the\nreal sociologists certainly are not. Sociologists also believe\nthat sociology cannot be as ignoble as nonsociologists cause\nit to appear. All of these attitudes indicate that sociology has\nsevere identity problems; otherwise, other professionals in\nthe market would not play the role of sociologist.\nCertainly, the status of sociology is not only problematic in\nTurkey. Similar discussions have occurred in the United States\nregarding whether sociology is a science and its scientific status\nTable 2.

During the late 1980s, the ASA prepared a report\ncalled Task Force on Graduate Education (TAGGE) and several\narticles published in the American Journal of Sociology written\nwas proclaiming the death of sociology, Collins examined soci-\nology as either a proscience or an antiscience. What is wrong\nwith sociology as a topic has also been discussed in special\nforums (Cole, 1994). The primary discussions concerned what\nacademic sociology is or is not (Davis, 1994). These academics\nconcluded that there are no firm lines between legitimate aca-\ndemic and nonacademic sociology because of postmodernism,\nhumanistic sociology, and critical theory. Some other sociolo-\ngists, such as Molotch (1994), proposed escaping the science\ntrap as a model. Sociology and other social sciences have all\nbeen troubled by long discussions regarding the nature of\nscience, and some have suggested that it may be better to\nassume, at least for sociology, that the discipline is an \"intellec-\ntual craftsmanship,\" as proposed by Mills (1959). Categorizing\nthe social sciences with a flexible definition of science rather\nthan a strict definition may be a solution. The majority of the\nsocial sciences are far from applying the principles of natural\nsciences, principles such as generalization and objectivity. In\naddition, there have been many changes in the philosophy of\nscience and the epistemological convergence of natural and\nsocial sciences as opposed to divergence, prompting new areas\nIn Turkey, even senior professors are not completely clear\nwhen they answer questions regarding the identity of sociol-\nogy. When these senior professors compare themselves with\nmembers of other disciplines and professions, they notice that\nsociology as a science is accepted and its education has con-\ntinued for 100 years. Simultaneously, however, they believe\nthat they are only the teachers of sociology and do not con-\ntribute to the scientific body of knowledge in terms of theory.\nThey only transfer existing theoretical knowledge of the dis-\ncipline, assuming that the theoretical knowledge is universal.\nSociology students also complain that the subject they\nstudy is not well known by society, causing them to feel a lack\nof motivation to concentrate on their lessons. Even after a cer-\ntain number of years spent in the sociology department, stu-\ndents admit that they too are unable to define sociology, and\nthe majority of the time they try to avoid answering such\nquestions. The students who are not able to change reality\nbehave like conformists. Because the majority of the students\ndo not know a foreign language, they must read textbooks\nonly in translation, never in the original language. These\ndrawbacks have resulted in \"mediocrity\" (Sowell, 1993)\namong sociology students; students accepted being average\nand did not struggle to be superior or better. In fact, this medi-\nocrity is true for both students and professors because of the\nexisting system that reproduces it (Kasapoglu, 2011b).\nFurthermore, a lack of original theories and concepts peculiar\nto Turkey prevents the accuracy of both students' and profes-\nsors' perceptions of reality. Rapid social changes in society\nnecessitate more rigorous and comprehensive studies, not an\neasy task in existing market system conditions.\nAn examination of sociology education suggests that there\nare many students who are not studying voluntarily. There are\nalso many students who began voluntarily but because of the\nrisk of unemployment, have lost their motivation. The majority\nof students do not know where they will work and what will\nthey do when they graduate. Few positions in the private sector,\na lack of job security, fewer nongovernmental organizations,\nand limited opportunities to continue their education in aca-\ndemia as research assistants push sociologists to work in the\npublic sector. A lack of sufficient departments in the state ren-\nders students disappointed and unhappy. In addition, there is no\nguarantee that graduates will do sociological work; graduates\nmay have to do everything as an \"everyman,\" which was dis-\ncussed by Sennet (1998) in his study on corrosion of character.\nTable 4. Selected Examples of Significant Negative Statements of\nSociologists and Related Formulated Meanings in Four Thematic\nClusters.\nSignificant negative statements Formulated meanings\nRegarding the meaning of sociology: \"Uncertain risky field to\nstudy at that time\"\n \"My decision to study sociology was unconscious.\"\n \"Involuntarily, I studied sociology.\"\n \"Sociology is not accepted as a field of expertise or a\nprofession of expertise.\"\nRegarding sociology education: \"Objectives of curriculum\nare limited by academia.\"\n \"We are educated as if we will be academics in the university,\nwhich is not the case.\"\n \"The job I do here is not related to academic sociology.\"\n \"Sociology education must be more realistic.\"\n \"I have graduated without knowing what I can do as a\nprofessional.\"\n \"The duration of field studies can be increased.\"\nRegarding personal effects: \"Corrosion of character\"\n \"I have never defined myself as a sociologist.\"\n \"We are alienated from the society we live in.\"\n \"I work here like a social worker.\"\nRegarding the future: \"Worried and pessimistic\"\n \"We are worried about our future because there is no\nguarantee for tomorrow.\"\n \"It is obvious without doing a master's in business\nadministration, we can't advance.\"\n \"The most important problem for sociologists is employment.\"\n \"I suppose there is not a sufficient number of jobs in the public\nsector.\"\n \"We should also have business administration skills when we\nare working as sociologists.\"\n \"The job description of a sociologist must be prepared like a\nsocial worker's.\"\n8 SAGE Open\nThe majority of sociologists who are working for the state\nclaimed that they are doing jobs unrelated to sociology.\nThe results of the phenomenological study revealed that\nboth students and sociologists are in a type of dilemma or\nstate of confusion regarding the status of sociology. Although\nstudents and sociologists are certainly aware of the problems\nin the discipline, particularly regarding the risk of unemploy-\nment, they nevertheless maintain positive perceptions about\ntheir discipline. Although sociology is not known and\nrespected in Turkish society, students, regardless of their gen-\nder and university, express being happy studying sociology.\nTo solve the problems of sociology requires applying the\ntenets of sociology to sociology. If sociology solves its own\nproblems, certainly the discipline will be more successful\nwhen practiced in other fields. Transferring Western theory\nwithout adaptation, the gap between Western theory and local\npractices, the lack of communication among sociologists, and\ncertainly identity problems in society are the main problems\nof sociology in Turkey (Kasapoglu, 1991; Kasapoglu etal.,\n2014).Although all of these problems affect sociology educa-\ntion, the education in sociology also affects the quality of\nsociology. However, existing central examination system for\nentrance of higher education should also be revised.\nProfessors must realize that the intensive efforts that they\nhave exerted to transfer the existing knowledge contained in\nmany ordinary textbooks and neglecting to connect theory with\nthe nation's or society's needs represent an old-fashioned man-\nner of teaching. Curricula that do not prepare students to become\nthe professional sociologists should be revised. To fill the gaps\nbetween academic and nonacademic sociology, professors\nshould facilitate \"anticipatory socialization\" (Bynum, Boyle,\nPresnall, & Wemhaner, 1977) for their students; the skills and\nideas we learn from sociology can be applied to many subjects\nand areas, from art and culture including pubs, museums, street\nculture, games, and sports. According to Crawford (2012), a\nnew and changing world is always challenging us as sociolo-\ngists to explore and research. It should also be noted this is not\npeculiar only to sociology and can be interpreted for other disci-\nplines such as urban planning or social anthropology.\nTable A1.
