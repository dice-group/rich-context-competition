Pollack, PhD\nmethadone maintenance\ntreatment facilities meet es-\ntablished standards for best\npractice care?\nThis is a critical question for public\nhealth policy and, more broadly, for so-\ncial policy.1 Changes in methadone\ntreatment practices are important in re-\nsponding to the changing prevalence\nand modalities of heroin use, to the con-\ntinued role of injection drug use in the\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\nand hepatitis C epidemics, and to\nchanges in the financing and regula-\ntion of methadone treatment. Assess-\ning methadone treatment practices is\nalso important in light of recent re-\nsearch results about methadone treat-\nment effectiveness.\nAn upsurge in heroin use has in-\ncreased the need for effective treat-\nment services for opioid dependence.\nAdmissions for opioid dependence have\nsurpassed admissions for cocaine abuse\nin the nation's drug abuse treatment\nprograms.2 Population-based epide-\nmiological studies also show a marked\nincrease in heroin use.3 The Office of\nNational Drug Control Policy now es-\ntimates that the number of heroin us-\ners in the United States has increased\nby more than half in less than a de-\nAnalysts agree that increased heroin\nuse is influenced by declining heroin\nprices and by increased purity. In-\ncreased purity creates additional con-\ncern because this may increase the ad-\ndictive potential of street heroin.5\nAverage pure heroin content con-\ntained in a $100 purchase has in-\nin cities across the United States.5 High\npurityalsofacilitatesnoninjectingforms\nof heroin use, such as smoking and\nsnorting, which may attract new users\nwho are deterred by injection-related\nrisks. Newly available modalities of\nheroin use may thus have attracted new\nusers, most of whom are younger than\n26 years of age.2 The long-term risk be-\nhaviors of noninjection heroin users are\ncurrently unknown. Public health con-\nsequences would be significant if ini-\ntial noninjectors frequently convert to\nneedle use.\nInjection heroin use also remains\ncentral to HIV transmission and to the\ntransmission of other infectious agents.6\nMany studies indicate that methadone\ntreatment is associated with reduced\nHIV seroconversion among metha-\ndone patients and is also associated with\nreduced needle-sharing and other risk\nbehaviors.7,8 A recent Institute of Medi-\ncine report concludes, as have previ-\nous expert reports,1,8 that effective\nmethadone treatment for opioid de-\npendence is critical to prevent HIV\ntransmission.

Effective treatment for heroin\nusers is critical given the upsurge in heroin use and the continued role of injection drug\nuse in the human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C epidemics.\nObjectives To examine the extent to which US methadone maintenance treatment\nprograms have made changes in the past 12 years to provide adequate methadone\ndoses and to identify factors associated with variation in program performance.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Program directors and clinical supervisors of\nnationally representative methadone treatment programs that varied by ownership (for-\nprofit, public, or private not-for-profit) and setting (eg, free-standing, hospital-based)\nMain Outcome Measures Percentage of patients in each treatment program re-\nResults The percentage of patients receiving methadone dosage levels less than the\nsults also show that programs with a greater percentage of African American patients\nare especially likely to dispense low dosages, while programs with Joint Commission\non Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations accreditation are more likely to provide\nadequate methadone doses.\nConclusions Efforts to improve methadone treatment practices appear to be mak-\ning progress, but many patients are still receiving substandard care.\ntion drug users have now contracted\nhepatitis C. Effective methadone treat-\nment may be important to slowing this\nMoreover, important changes are\noccurring in financing and regulation\nthat may carry significant implications\nfor methadone treatment effectiveness.\nOne prominent change is the intro-\nduction of managed care as a payment\nand administrative mechanism for\nmethadone treatment. Although a\nrecent study indicates that methadone\ntreatment programs are less likely to\nbe involved in managed care than are\ntheir nonmethadone counterparts,11\nsome 30% of all methadone treatment\nprograms participate in some form of\nmanaged care.11 For those programs\nand the tens of thousands of patients\nthey serve, managed care can poten-\ntially improve treatment practices. At\nthe same time, managed care might\nhinder treatment effectiveness through\npractices such as limiting treatment\nduration, a central factor in treatment\nA second prominent change is the\npending move to regulate methadone\ntreatment facilities through the Cen-\nter for Substance Abuse Treatment\n(CSAT) rather than through the Drug\nEnforcement Agency and the Food and\nDrug Administration (FDA). This sub-\nstantial shift was prompted by con-\ncerns about quality of care in metha-\nCSAT, which is part of the federal Sub-\nstance Abuse and Mental Health Ser-\nvices Administration, brings exten-\nsive experience working with treatment\nprograms to improve quality. This regu-\nlatory shift may therefore create op-\nportunities to improve patient care.\nFinally, results from prior studies of\nmethadone treatment practices16 and\ntreatment effectiveness17 support the\nneed for a current assessment of treat-\nment practices.

Vaughn27 showed that the\nmore that clinical supervisors in metha-\ndone treatment programs supported an\nabstinence model of treatment, the\nmore likely their programs were to pro-\nvide low methadone doses.\nIn sum, the current study adds to\nprior research16,28 by examining changes\nin methadone treatment practices us-\nrepresentative panel of methadone\nmaintenance programs. We also exam-\nine how important characteristics of\nthese programs (eg, Joint Commis-\nsion on Accreditation of Healthcare Or-\nganizations [JCAHO] accreditation) are\nrelated to differences in average metha-\ndone dose levels.\nMETHODS\nThis study uses data from a panel sur-\nsearch at the University of Michigan and\nby the National Opinion Research Cen-\nter at the University of Chicago.29\nSampling Frame\nWe define a methadone treatment unit\nas a physical facility with resources\ndedicated specifically to treating opi-\nate dependence through methadone.\nMethadone programs with multiple\ntreatment units or multiple sites were\nidentified, and units were sampled ran-\ndomly from such programs. The ini-\ntial sampling frame consisted of the\ndone maintenance treatment units\n(N=587).

In addi-\ntion, we added 47 new methadone units\nto the 2000 sample. These units were se-\nlected at random from among metha-\ndone programs that had begun since\nsample to the panel units was to ensure\nwas representative of the population of\nmethadone treatment units; the panel\nsample alone would not have repre-\nsented these newer units.

This control for new\nsample units was not significant in any\nequations, and we dropped it in the re-\nsults reported herein. Thus, the total\ncombined response rate of 92%.\nData Collection\nThe unit director and supervisor of\nclinical services of each participating\nunit completed telephone surveys. The\nsurvey team followed established meth-\nodologies shown in previous research\nto maximize data reliability and valid-\nity in telephone surveys.30 Respon-\ndents received a worksheet in advance\nof our call that informed them of the\nrequested data. This enabled respon-\ndents to consult financial and admin-\nistrative records prior to the call.

Clinical su-\npervisors reported 4 important char-\nacteristics of patient mix that could be\ncorrelated with methadone treatment\npractices: employment status (percent-\nage of patients who are currently un-\nemployed), race/ethnicity (percent-\nage of African American and Hispanic/\nLatino patients), sex (percentage of\nmale patients), and average patient age.\nAll of these measures are characteris-\ntics of the mix of patients at the unit\nlevel of analysis; we do not have data\nfrom individual patients.\nUnit Characteristics. We measured\nseveral organizational characteristics\nthat could relate to variation in treat-\nsors reported the percentage of staff\nmembers who are ex-addicts. Direc-\ntors reported unit ownership (public,\nprivate for-profit, or private not-for-\nprofit; we used private not-for-profit as\nthe referent category). Finally, given re-\ncent efforts to improve the quality of\nmethadone treatment through accredi-\ntation, we used data from the unit di-\nrector to measure JCAHO accredita-\nGeographic Location and Time Ef-\nfects. Previous research suggests im-\nportant geographic variation in metha-\nmeasured geographic location using a\ncensus division scale (Northeast, Mid-\nwest, South, and West) with the North-\neast region serving as the referent cat-\negory. To capture time effects, we\ncreated dummy variables correspond-\ning to the year in which survey data\nwere collected, with 1988 serving as the\nreferent year.\nData Analysis\nThis study uses a longitudinal, panel de-\nsign. This design is most effective for\nexamining changes in treatment prac-\ntices over time. Panel data analysis is\ncomplicated, however, by unobserved\nunit heterogeneity and by potential\nwithin the same treatment units are\nlikely to be correlated over time due to\nunobserved characteristics of these\nsame units. Standard linear and logis-\ntic regression models, which assume in-\ndependence among observations, must\nbe modified for panel data analyses.\nNonrandom attrition may also bias sub-\nsequent results.\nTo address these concerns, we ana-\nlyzed the data using a random-effects\nspecification that accounts for repeated\ndent variable, a random-effects model\nuses all data from the 4 waves simulta-\nneously,butallowsforthepossibilityof\nrandom unit effects.

This procedure compared our\nrandom-effects results with a fixed-\neffects model that allowed for the pos-\nsibility that unit characteristics that we\ndid not measure (eg, staff training) are\ncorrelated with the observed covari-\nates. When the random-effects model is\ncorrectly specified, the fixed-effects es-\ntimator yields consistent (though inef-\nficient) point estimates for all time-\nvarying covariates. If point estimates\nfrom the 2 models yield statistically sig-\nnificant differences, unobserved hetero-\ngeneity may bias the random-effects co-\nefficients.

We examined this pos-\nsibility by estimating a fixed-effects\nmodel. When we compare the 2 mod-\nels, we find nearly identical results for\nyearly trends and for the estimated ef-\nfects of number of methadone patients.\nThe effect of African American case\nmix is also smaller (though less pre-\ncisely measured) in the fixed-effects\nspecification. These results suggest that\nunits that treat a large proportion of Af-\nrican American patients have charac-\nteristics associated with lower doses.\nFor example, perhaps counselors in\nunits that treat a high percentage of Af-\nrican American patients are not trained\nadequately about proper dose levels. Or,\nperhaps there is more turnover of staff\nmembers in such units that prevents\nthem from establishing relationships\nwith patients that would support higher\ndoses.\nA Hausman test formally supports\nthese possible explanations. This pro-\ncedure rejects the similarity of the 2\nmodels (P.004), indicating that unit\ncharacteristics that we did not mea-\nsure are correlated with observed co-\nvariates in our model. Comparing spe-\ncific point estimates, we find quite\nsimilar year effects in the fixed-effects\nand random-effects specifications. In\nour fixed-effects specification, we found\nthat private for-profit status was asso-\nciated with lower doses. We also found\nweaker effects for JCAHO accredita-\ntion, supporting the interpretation that\nunits with more effective practices\nhave self-selected into the JCAHO-\naccredited group.\nResults of Multivariate Analysis\nBecause current variations in metha-\ndone dosage practices are most\nimportant for public policy, we also\nsection, JCAHO accreditation dis-\nplayed the largest correlation with\nmethadone dose.

Two thirds of all patients now re-\nceive dosages above 60 mg/d. Treatment\ntients received dosages below this level.\nDespite these trends, only 32.4% of\npatients are receiving dosages above 80\nmg/d, the level indicated as optimal in\nrecentrandomizedtrials.Increasingdos-\nage levels to 80 mg/d may be the most\npressing current issue, in light of re-\ncent clinical evidence and in light of in-\ncreased heroin purity of street drugs. In\nfact, the increase in dose levels we have\nobserved may reflect increased purity:\ntreatment providers may have in-\ncreased dosage in response to more se-\nvere abuse or dependence among their\npatients. Treatment providers may re-\nmain one step behind if they do not con-\ntinue to increase dosages to the 80 mg/d\nlevel. At a minimum, individuals who\nhave responsibility and authority for de-\ntermining dose levels should conduct a\nreview of policies and practices to en-\nsure that dose levels are tailored to meet\nthe needs of individual patients.\nWe expect, however, that increas-\ning dosage levels to 80 mg/d will be dif-\nficult in many programs, especially\nthose that hold strong abstinence ori-\nentation or those whose patients or staff\nare otherwise ambivalent regarding the\nclinical or values trade-offs inherent to\nmethadone use. It is also true that some\npatients can do well on lower doses of\nmethadone; \"more\" is not always bet-\nter. Because this study did not collect\noutcome data from patients, we are not\nable to examine this possibility.\nFurther, some drug treatment pro-\nfessionals and staff (and some pa-\ntients) do not fully support the use of\nmethadone to treat heroin use disor-\nders. Others do not support the prin-\nciple that methadone is an appropri-\nate long-term solution to heroin\ndependence or abuse. Perhaps these\nprograms should consider alternative\ntherapies such as buprenorphrine,\nshown in clinical trials to be effective\nwhen properly dispensed.34Alternative\nmedications do not carry the stigma as-\nsociated with methadone, nor do they\ncarry the symbolic importance of\nmethadone within the drug treatment\ncommunity and broader society.\nAnother critical result is that units\nthat treat predominately African Ameri-\ncan patients continue to provide low\ndoses. Within-unit changes in the per-\ncentage of African American patients\nhad smaller association with dosage\nthan did comparisons across treat-\nment units with different proportions\nof African American patients. This pat-\ntern of results--indicated formally\nthrough comparison of fixed-effects\nand random-effects specifications--\nindicates that these low doses reflect\ncharacteristics of treatment programs\nthat are widely used by African Ameri-\ncan patients. It is possible that African\nAmerican patients are receiving treat-\nment at programs that have underly-\ning weaknesses in resources, includ-\ning funds and staff, that make them less\nlikely to keep up with best practices.\nThese programs are located dispropor-\ntionately in urban settings that have dif-\nficulty attracting and retaining well-\neducated and well-motivated staff\nmembers. Further, these programs are\nTable 3.

Further research on quality of\ntreatment available to African Ameri-\ncans is warranted, especially in light of\nthe high HIV incidence and preva-\nlence among African American injec-\ntion drug users.\nFinally, the results indicate that\nJCAHO accreditation seems to play an\nimportant role in adherence to consen-\nsus guidelines. Because JCAHO does\nnot set explicit standards for metha-\ndone dose levels, we suspect that the\nhigher doses that accredited units give\nto patients reflect some of their under-\nlying characteristics. Specifically, one\npossible reason that units with JCAHO\naccreditation are more likely to pro-\nvide higher methadone doses is that\nsuch units have more adequate re-\nsources overall, including staff and\nfunds for training.\nAdditional research is needed to\nunderstand how JCAHO accreditation\naffects conformity to consensus guide-\nlines. But the relationship between\naccreditationandadequatedosageprac-\ntices may suggest directions for the\nCSAT to pursue as it begins its regula-\ntory control of the nation's methadone\ntreatment programs.\nAuthor Contributions: Study concept and design:\nD'Aunno, Pollack.\nAcquisition of data: D'Aunno, Pollack.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: D'Aunno, Pollack.\nDrafting of the manuscript: D'Aunno, Pollack.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important in-\ntellectual content: D'Aunno, Pollack.\nStatistical expertise: D'Aunno, Pollack.\nObtained funding: D'Aunno.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support:\nD'Aunno.\nStudy supervision: D'Aunno.\nFunding/Support: This research is supported by grant\nDA03272 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\nREFERENCES\n1.
