Despite the centrality of parent\u00adadult child relations, prior research has found only weak associations with\nparent well-being. There is a need to give more explicit attention to the relations of parents with multiple children and to\nthe potentially mixed or ``ambivalent'' nature of those relations. These patterns may differ for mothers and fathers.\nMethods. Wave 1 of the National Survey of Families and Households provided detailed information on relations\nbetween parents and each of their adult children. The sample included 2,270 persons aged 50\u00fe who had at least one child\nResults. Measures across multiple adult children uncovered more mixed patterns of ``collective ambivalence'' that\nincluded lesser quality and/or contact with at least some children. The presence of less positive relations with any children\nwas consistently, albeit modestly, related to lower parent well-being. Mothers reported higher ``maximum'' quality and\ninteraction across children, but mothers and father did not differ in ``minimum'' reports. Associations between parent\u00ad\nchild relations and well-being were similar for mothers and fathers.\nDiscussion. Analyses that incorporate the relations of parents with their multiple adult children, viewed as part of\na family network, yield a more comprehensive and nuanced view of those relations and their implications for well-being.\nKey Words: Parent\u00adchild relations--Well-being--NSFH.\nTHE parent\u00adchild bond is a central tie that now typically\nlasts into the later adult years of parents and into middle\nage and even beyond for children (Mancini & Blieszner, 1989).\nParent\u00adadult child relations are generally characterized by\npositive feelings and solidarity (e.g., see Bengtson, Biblarz, &\nRoberts, 2002), but research has found only weak associations\nbetween those relations and parent well-being. This may reflect\nthe mixed quality of parent\u00adchild relations. Little research has\nlooked at parent\u00adchild relations as a network of ties in which\nsome may be more positive whereas others may be more\nnegative, with presumably mixed implications for parental\nwell-being.\nThis article addresses the implications of considering in\na more explicit and detailed way the multiple parent\u00adadult child\nrelations of most parents to better understand their implications\nfor parent well-being. In particular, it directs attention to less\npositive aspects of parent\u00adchild relations and extends the con-\ncept of intergenerational ambivalence (Luescher & Pillemer,\n1998), which has been applied to particular parent\u00adchild re-\nlationships, to a collective view of ambivalence across multiple\nchildren. The following sections review the literature on\nparent\u00adadult child relations and well-being and on ambivalence\nin those relations.\nParent\u00adAdult Child Relations and Well-Being\nClose social relationships are presumed to contribute to\nindividual well-being (Krause, 2001). Indeed, such perspectives\nas socioemotional selectivity and expectancy theory argue\nthat people seek out ties that are emotionally supportive\nparticular offer the kinds of durable ``strong ties'' that may\ncontribute to well-being, in part by buffering the effects of\nstressful circumstances (Bengtson & Silverstein, 1993; Lin,\nties may play an increasing role as individuals age and network\nties focus increasingly on kin. Social networks in later life may\nbecome smaller but retain emotional closeness by focusing se-\nlectively on those ties, such as family, that are most supportive\nand gratifying (Ajrouch, Antonucci, & Janevic, 2001; Lang,\nStaudinger, & Carstensen, 1998; Shaw, Krause, Liang, &\nDrawing from various theoretical perspectives, Umberson\n(1992) cited the parent\u00adchild tie as a particularly strong and\nunique source of social attachment and solidarity. Indeed, it\nseems reasonable to expect that such relations would affect\nwell-being through supports that meet the needs of both parents\nand their adult children. Knoester (2003) also suggested that the\nwell-being of adult children affects parent well-being through\nfeelings of empathy, as parents vicariously experience their\nchildren's joys and sorrows, and because children's successes\nor failures reflect on parent performance.\nKnoester, however, indicated that relatively little is known\nabout the extent to which parents and adult children actually\naffect one another's well-being. Being childless, for example,\nexhibits little association with well-being (Brubaker, 1991;\nproximity and frequency of contact with adult children appear\nto have little overall association with well-being (Brubaker,\nWeinstein, Glei, Yamazaki, and Ming-Cheng (2004) reported\nlittle association between interaction and affectional ties with\nadult children and parent depression. Parents who are\n``sandwiched'' between their adult children and older parents\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2008 by The Gerontological Society of America\nalso exhibit little association between parent\u00adchild relations and\nIf the parent\u00adadult child tie is central in the lives of both, why\nis the evidence of its effects on well-being so weak? It may be\nthat children have less salience for parental well-being\nfollowing the empty nest, in what Rossi (1968) termed the\ndisengagement stage of parenthood. This reduction in the\nparenting role may itself be a source of gratification. Although\nchildren can be a source of enjoyment, the parent role can also\nbe stressful, especially when children are young, and there is\nsome evidence that the departure of children (the ``empty nest'')\nis associated with increased well-being (Barber, 1989; Logan &\nLaningham, Johnson, & Amato, 2001; White & Edwards,\nThere are indications that involvement and interaction with\nadult children may enhance well-being (Logan & Spitze, 1996;\nWhite & Edwards, 1990) but also that adult children can be\na source of distress. Reciprocity in gratifications and assistance\nis accompanied by reciprocity in strain and burden, as parents\nand adult children affect one another's lives. Negative\ndimensions of parent\u00adchild ties have been a focus in caregiving\nresearch assessing, for example, the burdens and strains\nexperienced by child (and other) caregivers (e.g., see Pearlin,\nAneshensel, Mullan, & Whitlatch, 1996; Sherwood, Given,\nEven aside from caregiving, other research has found that some\naspects of parent\u00adchild relations are associated with psycholog-\nical distress for both parents and adult children (e.g., Logan &\nKnoester (2003) found that the well-being of parents and adult\nchildren, and changes in their well-being, affect the well-being\nof the other. Parent\u00adchild relations may have both positive and\nnegative effects, varying by relationship quality, circumstances\nof parents and children, and other factors (Ha & Carr, 2005;\nMultiple Parent\u00adChild Relations and Collective\nAmbivalence\nThese considerations suggest that parent\u00adadult child relations\nmatter but that children (and parents, for that matter) are\na ``mixed blessing.'' Parent\u00adadult child relations are generally\npositive along multiple dimensions of intergenerational soli-\ndarity (Silverstein & Bengtson, 1997), with relatively close\nproximity, frequent contact, emotional closeness, and feelings\nof normative obligation accompanied by support and advice\nUmberson, 1992). These positive portrayals notwithstanding,\nsocial ties, including family, have both positive and negative\ndimensions that may affect well-being both positively and\nnegatively (Ingersoll-Dayton, Morgan, & Antonucci, 1997;\nThe potentially mixed qualities of parent\u00adadult child\nrelations point to a need to recognize the multiple relations\nexperienced by most parents. Research has typically operation-\nalized parent\u00adchild relations as individual dyads or children\ngrouped as a composite. Lye (1996) noted related questions\nregarding the appropriate unit of analysis in studies of parent\u00ad\nchild relations. Focusing on a particular parent\u00adchild tie, or on\nchildren as an undifferentiated composite, loses information\nabout how relations with one child fit into and are related to\nthose with other children within a network of parent\u00adchild ties.\nMultiple relations include the possibility that some are positive\nbut others are negative.\nThere has been attention to within-family differentiation\namong adult children in such areas as emotional closeness and\n``favoritism'' (e.g., Aldous, Klaus, & Klein, 1985; Suitor &\nPillemer, 2007) and the division of labor in caregiving (e.g.,\ninvestigated the existence of such differentiation and its\npredictors (e.g., gender and family size). I extend that line of\nresearch here to consider the consequences of within-family\ndifferentiation for parent well-being, applying and extending\nthe concept of ambivalence in parent\u00adchild relations.\nResearch has described parent\u00adadult child relations as being\ncharacterized by intergenerational ambivalence, or ``contra-\ndictions and ambiguities in relationships'' (Lowenstein, 2007,\np. S101) at social\u00adstructural and subjective\u00ademotional levels\nthat are reflected in a mix of solidarity and conflict, and\nautonomy and dependence (also see Luescher & Pillemer,\nambivalence has been operationalized as ``mixed feelings''\n(e.g., Lowenstein, 2007), but this has largely focused on\nparticular dyads. Ambivalence may also be extended to\nconsider relations with multiple children. For example, not\nonly are some children noted by parents as ``favorites''\nfound that parents may refer to some children as more\n``comforting'' and others as ``disappointing.'' Thus, there may\nbe collective ambivalence entailed in mixed feelings across\nmultiple children.\nAmbivalence in parent\u00adadult child relations may be\nparticularly pertinent to parent well-being. Some have sug-\ngested that negative interactions and feelings within social\nnetworks may affect well-being more strongly than positive\ninteractions; that family ties are more likely than other\nrelationships to include negative, conflictual, or unbalanced\nexchanges; and that negative dimensions of such close ties are\nbe more likely with kin than other relationships but that they are\nnot expected, so problematic relations ``stand out'' when they\noccur. Lowenstein (2007) found negative emotions (conflict\nand ambivalence) in family relations to be relatively low in\nsurveys of five countries, but feelings of both solidarity and\nambivalence predicted quality of life among older persons.\nUmberson (1992) found that negative aspects in the relation-\nship had stronger associations with distress for both parents and\nadult children than did positive, supportive aspects. Thus,\nconsideration of collective ambivalence across adult children,\nand particularly of less positive relations with some children,\ncan contribute to an understanding of the implications of\nparent\u00adadult child relations for parent well-being.\nGender Differences in Parent\u00adAdult Child Relations\nResearch on parent\u00adadult child relations must attend to\ngender differences. Gender is an organizing feature of family\nrelationships, and the significance and implications of family\nties likely differ for men and women. Women have been\nWARD\ndescribed as kinkeepers who feel stronger family obligations,\nmaintain family bonds, and are most involved in assistance and\ncaregiving (Bengtson, Rosenthal, & Burton, 1990; Logan &\nconnections carry both benefits and costs and may themselves\nbe sources of stress (Antonucci, 1990). Pillemer and Suitor\n(2002), for example, suggested that mothers feel more\nambivalence in the parent\u00adchild relationship.\nGender differences in parent\u00adadult child relations should not\nbe oversimplified, however; Logan and Spitze (1996) noted that\nthey are not necessarily straightforward and evidence is not\nconsistent. For example, they found that women received and\ngave more help in exchanges with adult children, but gender\ndifferences were not strong; and although having and helping\nchildren increased family burden for women but not for men,\nchildren were a potential source of distress for both. Umberson\n(1992) found that parent\u00adchild strains had a greater effect on\nmothers than fathers, but others have found similar outcomes of\nparent\u00adadult child relations for mothers and fathers (Knoester,\nResearch Questions\nThis study looked explicitly at relations by parents across\nmultiple adult children by using a data set that assesses relations\nwith each of multiple children within a family. The main\nquestion was as follows: How does this contribute to\nunderstanding the implications of parent\u00adadult child relations\nfor parent well-being? More specifically, the literature suggests\nthat negative relations with children may have a greater effect\non parent well-being than positive relations. How does this play\nout across multiple children, viewed as collective ambivalence?\nDoes it matter, for example, if the relations with any child\nwithin a network are negative, or are things OK as long as there\nare positive ties to any (perhaps favorite) child? I also inves-\ntigated parental gender differences in these patterns. Reflecting\ntheir kinkeeping role, I hypothesized that parent\u00adadult child\nrelations, and especially negative relations and collective\nambivalence, may have a greater effect on the well-being of\nmothers. I also included in the analysis other variables that may\nbe pertinent to parent\u00adadult child relations and their con-\nsequences, including parent and family characteristics (e.g.,\nparent age, marital status, and health; family size and gender\ncomposition).\nMETHODS\nSample\nData were from Wave 1 of the National Survey of Families\npersons aged 19 and older representing the noninstitutionalized\nU.S. population, with oversampling of some demographic\ngroups (including Blacks and Hispanics) and household types\n(Sweet & Bumpass, 1996). The first wave had particular variety\nin measures of parent\u00adchild relations, especially about each\nadult child, that enabled a more comprehensive view of\nrelations across multiple children.\nI used a subsample, selecting respondents who had at least\none adult child (aged 19 or older) and were themselves aged 50\nor older (N \u00bc 2,270). Age 50 was the cutoff to focus on parents\nin later middle age and beyond and to focus on their relations\nwith adult children in part by lessening the presence and\nimplications of relations with younger children. Table 1\nsummarizes the characteristics of parent respondents (N \u00bc\nage, gender, and marital status; and number, gender, and ages\nof adult children. As also noted in the table, nearly one fourth of\nparents had a coresident adult child, and almost all had at least\none adult child outside of their household; a minority (13%)\nhad an adult stepchild, and only 8% had a child younger than\n19 in the household.\nMeasures\nMy focus was on relations between parents and adult\nchildren and their implications for the well-being of parents. As\nan indicator of overall quality of parent\u00adadult child relations,\nrespondents were asked to ``describe your relationship with\neach of these children'' from excellent (7) to very poor (1).\nParents were also asked about frequency of contact with each\nadult child during the prior 12 months: ``How often did you\nsee ___'' (from 1 \u00bc not at all to 6 \u00bc several times a week;\ncoresident children were coded as 7 in the analyses). Parents\nTable 1.

The ``did you see'' measure represented\na deeper and more personal form of interaction, and neither\nletter/phone contact nor proximity exhibited much association\nwith parent well-being, so I use the former here.\nParents were also asked about assistance to and from each\nadult child. Assistance from children included the following:\nlistens to my problems and provides advice; provides news\nabout mutual friends and the family; helps out with household\ntasks, including transportation; provides financial assistance;\nand provides companionship. Assistance to children included\nthese five dimensions plus child care. I created separate\nindicators for instrumental assistance (household tasks, finan-\ncial, child care) and expressive assistance (listening, news,\ncompanionship). Preliminary analyses found little difference in\nassociations with well-being separately for giving and receiving\nassistance, and giving and receiving were highly correlated\n(indicating strong patterns of reciprocity, as well as multi-\ncollinearity); for these reasons, measures of exchange of\nassistance combined giving and receiving separately for\nexpressive and instrumental dimensions (the number of times\nchildren were named for each).\nThere are various options for combining information on\nrelations across multiple children. Preliminary analyses assessed\ndifferent options, including counting number of children versus\nwhether any child was mentioned for assistance, and counts\nversus maximums and minimums across children on quality and\ninteraction. Empirical patterns considered in selecting which\nmeasures to employ in subsequent analyses included distribu-\ntional characteristics (e.g., skewness), intercorrelations among\nmeasures of parent\u00adchild relations (to avoid multicollinearity),\nand patterns of association with well-being. Indicators of\nparent\u00adchild quality and contact tended to be skewed positively.\nSome measures were intercorrelated; for example, as noted\nabove, assistance from and to children were highly correlated. It\nis interesting, however, that quality of parent\u00adchild relations had\nonly moderate correlations with the other dimensions of their\nrelations (no higher than .3\u00ad.4). Finally, some approaches\nyielded stronger associations with well-being. For example,\nmaximum and minimum quality of parent\u00adchild relations had\nmore consistent associations than did counts of the number of\nchildren who were high or low in quality.\nOn the basis of these considerations, I selected the following\nindicators of parent\u00adchild relations for use in subsequent analyses:\nmaximum and minimum quality of relations and of contact (i.e.,\nhighest and lowest reports across children), and number of\nchildren reported for exchange of expressive and of instrumental\nassistance (to reduce skewness, I recoded these as 0 to 5 or more).\nLooking at both highest and lowest quality and contact was\nintended to capture collective ambivalence of both positive and\nnegative (or, perhaps more accurately given the patterns, less\npositive) relations across multiple children. I also addressed\ncollective ambivalence by looking at the extent to which relations\nby parents across their adult children combined both higher and\nlower levels of quality or contact with different children.\nThe presentation of results first summarizes patterns of\nparent\u00adadult child relations when viewed across multiple\nchildren. The main focus, however, is on associations of\nparent\u00adchild relations with parent well-being using two\nindicators: (a) global happiness (``Taking things all together,\nhow would you say things are these days''; 1\u00bcvery unhappy to\n7 \u00bc very happy; M \u00bc 5.5), and (b) a composite of 12 items\nassessing depression included in a ``list of the ways you might\nhave felt or behaved during the past week'' (aggregated number\nMultivariate analyses of parent well-being included as\ncontrol variables that may affect parent\u00adadult child relations\nand parent well-being. These included the following parent\ncharacteristics: age, race/ethnicity (binary variables for Black\nand for Hispanic), marital status (a binary variable for married),\nhealth (self-reported, from 1 \u00bc very poor to 5 \u00bc excellent), and\neducation (number of years) as an indicator of social class.\nFamily characteristics included family size (number of adult\nchildren), the presence of a child younger than 19, gender\ncomposition of adult children (binary variables for sons only\nand daughters only, with both sons and daughters as the omitted\ncategory), and having an adult stepchild.\nRESULTS\nPatterns of Parent\u00adAdult Child Relations\nAssessing across multiple children yields a more compre-\nhensive and diverse view of parent\u00adadult child relations.\nTable 2 summarizes patterns for the sample as a whole and\nseparately for mothers and fathers; Ward (2007) presents more\ndetailed information on these patterns and their predictors.\nViewed across all of a respondent's adult children, the table\npresents selected information on the highest reported quality\n(a 7 reported for any child) and lowest quality (less than 7 for\nTable 2.

As described below, the\ntable also presents frequencies of parents' reported mixed\npatterns of quality and interaction across children (i.e., higher\nfor some children but lower for others).\nLooking at maximum quality of relations, 83% reported\n``excellent'' (7) relations with at least one child, reflecting the\ntypical positive skew in such ratings; but the minimum measure\nreported 5 or 6 for at least one child. Similarly with interaction,\nmost parents (58%) reported seeing at least one child at least\nseveral times a week (maximum), but 14% saw at least one\nchild ``not at all,'' 17% only ``about once a year,'' and 43% less\nthan weekly (minimum). Substantial majorities of parents\nreported exchanges of assistance (given or received) with adult\nchildren, with expressive more common than instrumental.\nThere were also indications that parents had mixed relations\namong their children, reflecting collective ambivalence (see\n``Mixed quality'' and ``Mixed interaction'' in Table 2). For\nreported quality, 62% of parents reported only the highest\nrating (7) for all of their children, but 21% reported both a high\nrating (7) for some children and lower (1\u00ad6) ratings for other\nchildren; another 17% reported only ratings lower than 7 for all\nof their children. For interaction, 26% saw all of their children\nat least once a week, but 47% saw some children that often and\nother children less often; another 27% saw all of their children\nless than once a week.\nAs anticipated, mothers reported higher maximum quality\nand interaction than did fathers, but quality and interaction\nminimums did not differ significantly by parent gender; and\nmothers were less likely to have lower quality or interaction\nwith all of their children. Thus, mothers appeared to experience\nmore positive relations across children without also experienc-\ning more negative relations. Mothers also reported more\nexchanges of aid. Other analyses indicated that larger families\n(more adult children) entailed both more positive and more\nnegative relations, though exchange of assistance was less\nsensitive to family size; sons and daughters had comparable\nmaximum and minimum quality of relations, with mothers\nreporting more positive relations with both sons and daughters;\nand relations with adult stepchildren entailed lower quality,\ninteraction, and exchange of assistance (for details of these\nTo summarize, incorporating information from all adult\nchildren yields a more complete view of parent\u00adadult child\nrelations. In particular, compared with reports for individual\nparent\u00adchild dyads or ``averages'' combined across children,\nassessing lowest levels of quality and contact across multiple\nchildren uncovers more indications of negative (or less\npositive) relations. It is apparent that mixed relations across\nadult children (collective ambivalence) is not uncommon for\nmiddle-aged and older parents. What are the implications of\nthese relations for parent well-being?\nParent\u00adAdult Child Relations and Parent Well-Being\nThe main focus here is the implications of parent\u00adadult child\nrelations for parent well-being. I conducted regression analyses\nwith parent happiness and depression as dependent variables. I\nanticipated that negative relations with children and collective\nambivalence would be more influential than positive relations.\nPreliminary analyses indicated that minimum scores for adult\nchild quality had stronger associations with well-being than\nmaximum quality. I also included minimum contact as a parallel\npredictor; these measures of quality and contact were only\nmodestly correlated (r \u00bc .34). I also included measures of\nexchange of expressive and instrumental assistance (number of\nchildren named for giving/receiving each) as predictors; assis-\ntance is not directly related to ambivalence, but it is an important\ndimension of parent\u00adadult child relations that may affect parent\nwell-being, though it is not obvious whether assistance\nexchanges would affect well-being positively or negatively.\nTable 3 presents regression results for the total sample and\nseparately for mothers and fathers. I conducted additional\n(married vs not married), and number and gender of adult\nchildren. I assessed the latter to investigate whether relations\nwith adult children might be more influential, for example, if\nthere are only one or two children or only sons or daughters, as\nwell as whether the implications of these factors differ for\nmothers and fathers. Table 3 does not report those analyses, but\nI refer to them in the text. As noted earlier, control variables in\nthe analyses included parent and family characteristics.\nTo begin with overall happiness, being married and having\nbetter subjective health were the most consistent predictors; this\nwas true across all of the subgroup analyses. Of particular\nrelevance to the focus here, however, quality of parent\u00adchild\nrelations also exhibited a consistent albeit modest association:\nParents exhibited greater happiness when the lowest (mini-\nmum) quality of relations across their children was higher. Size\nof the coefficient for minimum quality varied some across\nsubgroups; for example, it was somewhat higher for mothers,\nfor older (60\u00fe) parents, and for unmarried parents. But\nsubgroup differences were quite modest (coefficients ranged\nbetween .08 and .15); in particular, differences in the coeffi-\ncients for mothers and fathers were not statistically significant.\nFurthermore, the coefficient for minimum quality was the same\nfor small families (one or two adult children) as for larger\nfamilies, indicating that lower quality relations with any child\nreduced parent well-being, even when there were multiple\nchildren that included relationships with higher quality. Contact\nand exchange of assistance, and the number of children, in\ncontrast, exhibited little association with parent happiness.\nChild gender appeared to play little role in these patterns of\nwell-being. Preliminary analyses found that correlations with\nwell-being were similar for measures of quality of relations\nwith sons and with daughters for both mothers and fathers.\nFurthermore, gender composition of children was unrelated to\nhappiness (see Table 3); analyses for sons-only and daughters-\nonly families (not shown) exhibited similar patterns to those for\nthe sample as a whole for both mothers and fathers.\nLooking at patterns for depression, subjective health was\nagain a consistent predictor. Depression was also lower for men\nand for married and better educated parents. Better parent\u00adchild\nquality (a higher minimum rating) was associated with less\ndepression; the magnitude of these coefficients was comparable\nto those for gender, marital status, and education. As with\nhappiness, associations for parent\u00adchild quality and patterns for\nmothers and fathers were similar across subgroup analyses,\nincluding those respondents with only one or two adult children\nand those with only sons or only daughters. Also as with\nhappiness, other measures of parent\u00adchild relations and family\ncharacteristics exhibited little association with depression. In\nsummary, although coefficients for parent\u00adchild minimum\nquality with happiness and depression were not high, they\nwere consistently significant across a variety of subgroup\nanalyses, including parent gender and the number and gender of\nchildren. Only health, and to a lesser extent marital status, had\nstronger and more consistent associations with well-being.\nI repeated analyses in Table 3 using maximum quality and\ninteraction with adult children as predictors in place of the\nminimum measures. Maximum quality had a somewhat\nstronger association with happiness than its minimum counter-\npart for fathers (b \u00bc .13,vs .08, p , .05). With that exception,\nhowever, the more positive indicators of parent\u00adchild relations\nexhibited weaker associations with well-being than did the\nminimum indicators.\nTo further explore the implications of negative parent\u00adadult\nchild relations and of collective ambivalence, the bottom of\nTable 3 reports findings using indicators of either mixed or\nconsistently low quality and contact with children; each is\na binary variable, with highest quality (7) and at least weekly\ncontact for all children, respectively, as omitted comparison\ngroups. Those results further highlighted the relevance of\nnegative (or less positive) relations with at least some children.\nCompared with parents who reported consistently high quality\nacross their adult children, those who reported more mixed\nrelations and especially those who reported consistently lower\nquality had lower happiness and higher depression. Further-\nmore, low contact with all children also exhibited associations\nwith lower well-being (depression) that were not evident in the\nanalyses in the upper part of Table 3. Differences in coefficients\nin these analyses for mothers and fathers were not statistically\nsignificant.\nDISCUSSION\nParent\u00adchild ties are important and increasingly long lasting.\nParents and adult children generally report quite positive\nrelations and are important sources of gratification and\nassistance. But attention is needed to parent\u00adadult child\nrelations as networks of multiple ties and interactions with\nboth positive and negative qualities and outcomes. This article\nhas extended the concept of ambivalence in parent\u00adadult child\nTable 3.

Incorporating information from all adult\nchildren in assessing parent\u00adchild relations yields a more\ncomplete view, in particular illuminating a collective ambiva-\nlence of mixed and negative relations between parents and their\nadult children.\nLooking at multiple parent\u00adadult child relations also enables\na better understanding of the implications of parent\u00adadult child\nrelations for parent well-being. Past research has found limited\nand inconsistent evidence that such relations affect well-being.\nHere, however, there is evidence that parent\u00adadult child\nrelations have a consistent, albeit modest, contribution to\nparent well-being. This cuts across a variety of demographic\nand family subgroups, including parent age and marital status\nand family size. It appears that perceived quality of parent\u00ad\nchild relations matters more than quantity (in terms of contact\nor exchanges of assistance). Furthermore, more negative\naspects of parent\u00adchild relations, especially lower quality\nwith at least one child (and especially with all children),\nappear to be more salient than positive aspects, as Krause\nbe relations with a favorite child that matter so much to parent\nwell-being as those involving less favored or more problematic\nchildren.\nI expected parental gender differences in parent\u00adadult child\nrelations and their implications for parent well-being, but there\nwere both differences and similarities between mothers and\nfathers. Mothers reported more positive quality across multiple\nchildren, as well as greater contact and exchange of assistance,\nbut mothers did not report more negative relations. Compared\nwith those of fathers, mothers' relations with adult children\nappeared to exhibit more benefits without more ``costs,'' or\ncollective ambivalence. However, there were not significant\ndifferences between mothers and fathers in the implications of\nnegative relations with adult children for well-being. As Logan\nand Spitze (1996) noted, gender differences may not be as clear\ncut as often presumed; and, as here, they found that adult\nchildren were a potential source of distress for both mothers and\nfathers.\nIn addition to parent gender, the analyses reported here sought\nto assess the role of child gender in various ways. Previous\nanalyses indicated that quality of relations reported by parents is\nsimilar for sons and daughters (see Ward, 2007). In the analyses\nfor this article I found that measures of relations with sons and\ndaughters were correlated similarly with the well-being of\nmothers and fathers, that the gender composition of adult\nchildren was not related to parent well-being, and that patterns\ndid not vary for sons-only or daughters-only families. Thus, the\nimplications of relations with children for parent well-being\ninvestigated here do not appear to depend on child gender.\nI should acknowledge some limitations of this research. It\nrelied on parent reports of parent\u00adchild relations. Parents tend to\ngive somewhat more positive reports than children (Aquilino,\n1999); thus, child reports might have exhibited more mixed\nrelations and collective ambivalence. Parents' perspectives are\nmore relevant here, however, for the focus on parent well-being.\nThis cross-sectional view cannot be unequivocal about causal\nordering in the association between the quality of parent\u00adadult\nchild relations and parent well-being. It seems reasonable that\nnegative relations with children (and especially with all of one's\nchildren) reduce parental well-being, but it is plausible that\ncausality may operate also in the other direction: Parent\ndepression or unhappiness may cause strains in parent\u00adadult\nchild relations, and difficult parents may alienate their children.\nThe data employed here were gathered 20 years ago. It is not\nuncommon to use such ``older'' data, especially with data sets as\nrich as the National Survey of Families and Households and\nwhen not addressing issues and events that be may relatively\nspecific to particular cohorts or historical periods. Nonetheless,\nthe salience of parent\u00adadult child relations in the lives of both\ngenerations, and their implications for parent well-being, might\nvary by cohort and/or period. Gans and Silverstein (2006) noted\nthat historical conditions that shape the values of birth cohorts\nmay yield variation in family values and expectations; in\nparticular, they cited suggestions that there has been a decline in\nthe salience of family values in American society. However,\nGans and Silverstein found that although there was evidence that\nlater born baby boom cohorts expressed slightly stronger norms\nof filial responsibility than did earlier cohorts. Bengtson and\ncolleagues (2002) argued that there is more support for continued\nfamily solidarity than for a ``family decline'' perspective. Logan\nand Spitze (1996) suggested that such factors as divorce, single\nparenthood, and increased longevity and widowhood may have\nheightened the salience of parent\u00adchild relations as the most\nenduring relationship. Thus, it is reasonable to anticipate that\nparent\u00adadult child relations continue to affect parent well-being\nnow in ways that are similar to patterns in these data, with similar\nconceptual underpinnings.\nThis was also a relatively exploratory look at the issues\naddressed here. Although the data set used here is unusual in\nproviding information about relations between parents and each\nof their adult children, available measures of those relations were\nlimited in depth and variety. In particular, measurement of\nrelationship quality rested on a single item. More direct measures\nare needed that assess ambivalence both in particular parent\u00adadult\nchild relationships and collectively across multiple children.\nAnalyses here considered some of the predictors of parent\u00ad\nadult child relations and parent well-being. Gender differences\nwere a particular focus, with standard controls for parent and\nfamily characteristics incorporated into the multivariate analy-\nses; some of these (age, marital status, and family size) were\ninvestigated further through subgroup analyses. Further re-\nsearch should explore in more depth the role of other factors,\nincluding the characteristics of parents, adult children, and\nparent\u00adchild dyads. For example, although there was some\nattention to child gender here, more in-depth assessment of\nsame- and different-gender parent\u00adchild dyads is warranted. In\naddition, the quality of other relationships, such as marital or\nother social ties, may also affect parent\u00adchild relations and their\nconsequences.\nI also suggested in the introduction that parents may be\naffected by circumstances in the lives of adult children--their\nsuccesses or failures. These may themselves affect parent well-\nbeing independent of, or in spite of, the nature and quality of\nparent\u00adchild relations. They may also affect parent\u00adchild\nrelations and thereby affect parent well-being, as Knoester\n(2003) suggested that the quality of parent\u00adadult child relations\nmediates links between parent and child well-being. Future\nwork should consider the implications of child experiences,\nsuch as job promotion (or loss) and marriage (or divorce), for\nboth parent\u00adchild relations and parent well-being.\nThere are other ways in which the research and issues\naddressed here can be extended. Luescher and Pillemer (1998)\nindicated that a dynamic life course approach is warranted for\nunderstanding ambivalence, and that ambivalence can be either\na dependent or independent variable. Suitor and Pillemer (2007)\nnoted that the developmental literature on young and adolescent\nchildren has found parental differentiation among children on vari-\nous dimensions; parent\u00adadult child ambivalence itself has roots\nin family history and early parent\u00adchild relations (Luescher &\nPillemer, 1998). Thus, early parent\u00adchild relations affect sub-\nsequent within-family differentiation among adult children; for\nexample, Suitor and Pillemer (2007) found differences between\nfirst- and last-born adult children in emotional closeness and\npreferences for assistance. Differences across children in adult life\ncourse transitions and statuses, such as marital and parental status,\nare likely to be sources of further differentiation across children\nThe focus here was the implications of within-family\ndifferentiation and ambivalence in parent\u00adadult child relations\nfor parent well-being. Other potential outcomes should be\nexplored. For example, Pillemer and Suitor (2006) investigated\nparent preferences for particular children as caregivers and how\nthis is related to variation in emotional closeness and past\nexchanges of assistance with children.\nRecognition of multiple parent\u00adadult child relations also\ndirects attention to how relations with one or some children\nmay affect relations with other children in the same family, and\nhow these interconnecting ties affect parent\u00adchild relations and\nparent well-being. For example, modeling by Spitze, Logan,\nDeane, and Zerger (1994) of parent\u00adadult child exchanges\nsuggested the existence of sibling dependence in such\nexchanges. Further research needs to address and bring in the\neffects of relations with one adult child on those with others.\n"
