    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Recent studies suggest that neighborhood fast food restaurant availability is related to greater\nobesity, yet few studies have investigated whether neighborhood fast food restaurant availability promotes fast\nfood consumption. Our aim was to estimate the effect of neighborhood fast food availability on frequency of fast\nfood consumption in a national sample of young adults, a population at high risk for obesity.\nMethods: We used national data from U.S. young adults enrolled in wave III (2001-02; ages 18-28) of the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (n = 13,150). Urbanicity-stratified multivariate negative binomial regression\nmodels were used to examine cross-sectional associations between neighborhood fast food availability and\nindividual-level self-reported fast food consumption frequency, controlling for individual and neighborhood\ncharacteristics.\nResults: In adjusted analysis, fast food availability was not associated with weekly frequency of fast food\nconsumption in non-urban or low- or high-density urban areas.\nConclusions: Policies aiming to reduce neighborhood availability as a means to reduce fast food consumption\namong young adults may be unsuccessful. Consideration of fast food outlets near school or workplace locations,\nfactors specific to more or less urban settings, and the role of individual lifestyle attitudes and preferences are\nneeded in future research.\n",
    "reduced_content": "Neighborhood fast food restaurants and fast food\nconsumption: A national study\nAndrea S Richardson1, Janne Boone-Heinonen2, Barry M Popkin1 and Penny Gordon-Larsen1*\n Keywords: Epidemiology, United States, *Diet, Geographic Information Systems, Environment, Environment Design,\nFast Foods, Restaurants, Young Adult, MeSH\nBackground\nNeighborhood availability of fast food restaurants has\nrecently received considerable attention as a target to pre-\nvent obesity [1-6]. It is intuitive that fast food restaurants\ncontribute to obesity by promoting fast food consumption.\nHowever, few studies have tested the relationship between\naccess to fast food and diet behavior and those that have\nrely on measures of fruit and vegetable intake [7-9]. Find-\nings from an even smaller literature that investigates direct\nrelationships with fast food consumption are mixed\nFurthermore, most evidence focuses on urban popula-\ntions, with little research in suburban or rural populations.\nOne of the difficulties is that urbanicity is often classified\naccording to population density [13], which may correlate\nwith cultural or social influences on diet and thus obscure\nimportant heterogeneity across urban, suburban and rural\nareas. Because the nature of accessibility in suburban or\nrural environments differ from urban environments, and\nother social, environmental, and individual influences of\ndiet behavior may differ according to urbanicity, residen-\ntial fast food restaurant availability may influence fast food\nconsumption differently in rural, suburban, and urban\ncontexts. Therefore, we hypothesize that the relationship\nbetween chain fast food availability with fast food con-\nsumption varies by urbanicity. In most existing research,\ngeneralizability across multiple contexts and comparisons\nby urbanicity are not possible due to small sample sizes\nand constrained geographic areas.\nAdditionally, variation in and limitations of neighbor-\nhood fast food availability measures may contribute to\ninconsistent and sometimes counterintuitive findings.\n* Correspondence: pglarsen@unc.edu\n1Department of Nutrition, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill;\nCarolina Population Center, 123 West Franklin St. Campus Box 8120, Chapel\nHill, NC USA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2011 Richardson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

In contrast, network buffers, the polygon shaped by\nthe street network up to a given distance, represent\naccess to resources relative to the street network [14].\nWhereas the count (or number) of fast food restaurants\nwithin a given area does not take into account popula-\ntion density and development, which are correlated with\nneighborhood food resource availability and indepen-\ndently related to dietary behavior [15]. Conceptually,\ngreater density of food resources per capita may repre-\nsent greater quantity and diversity of restaurant choices\nthat may, in turn, influence decision for where and\nwhen to eat outside of the home. Fast food restaurant\ndensity per population [16,17] may therefore capture\npopulation density or serve as a proxy for physical\ndevelopment density. Alternatively, a roadway-scaled\nmeasure that represents the concentration of fast food\noutlets along access routes may help account for differ-\nences in fast food restaurant counts according to the\namount of commercial activity.\nWe used national data from 13,150 sociodemographi-\ncally diverse young adults living throughout the U.S to test\nthe hypothesis that individuals living in neighborhoods\nwith greater chain fast food availability report more fre-\nquent fast food consumption. We improve on prior fast\nfood availability measures by examining fast food restau-\nrants per roadway mile within 3 km street network dis-\ntance from each respondent home, with sensitivity analysis\ncomparing to measures used in published research. Capi-\ntalizing on the size and geographic scope of our study, we\ninvestigated how the association between fast food avail-\nability and consumption varies by urbanicity.\nMethods\nStudy population and data sources\nOur study sample is derived from respondents aged 18 to\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add\nHealth), a nationally representative, prospective cohort\nstudy of adolescents representative of the U.S. school-\nstudy population (n = 20,745) was obtained through a sys-\ntematic random sample of 80 high schools and 52 middle\nschools in the United States, stratified to ensure that the\nschools were representative of US schools with respect to\nregion, urbanicity, school type, percentage of white stu-\ndents, and school size [18]. Respondents were followed\n15,197). Add Health included a core sample plus subsam-\nples of selected minority and other groupings collected\nunder protocols approved by the Institutional Review\nBoard at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nThe survey design and sampling frame have been dis-\nWe used the Add Health Obesity and Neighborhood\nEnvironment database (ONEdata), a Geographic Informa-\ntion System that linked time-varying, community-level\ndata to Add Health respondent Wave III home addresses\ngeocoded with street-segment matches (n = 13,039), global\npositioning system (GPS) measurements (n = 1,204), and\nWave III respondents with sample weights. Residential\nlocations were linked to attributes of areas within 1,3,5,\nand 8 km straight line distance (Euclidean neighborhood\nbuffer) and through the street network (street network\nneighborhood buffer) surrounding each wave-specific\nrespondent residence; and block group, tract, and county\nattributes from time-matched U.S. Census and other data,\nwhich were merged with individual-level Add Health\ninterview responses [20]. The number of census block\nOf 14,322 Wave III respondents with sample weights,\nwe excluded those reporting disability or pregnancy and\nNative Americans (due to sparse data) (n = 582). Remain-\ning respondents missing individual and geographic data\nwere also excluded (n = 590), leaving an analytic sample of\n13,150. The analytic sample had higher parental income,\nhad fewer children, were more likely to own a vehicle, and\nlived in more highly educated and lower poverty neighbor-\nhoods compared to those excluded for missing data.\nStudy variables\nFast food intake\nWeekly frequency of fast food consumption was ascer-\ntained from the question: \"On how many of the past\nseven days did you eat food from a fast food place\nMcDonalds, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut, Taco\nBell, or a local fast food restaurant?\"\nGIS-derived neighborhood fast food availability data\nNeighborhood fast food restaurant data were obtained\nfrom a commercial dataset of U.S. businesses corre-\nsponding to the Wave III interview period (2001). Fast\nfood restaurants include a wide range of quick service\nestablishments providing generally premade food and lit-\ntle table service; they include traditional burger outlets as\nwell as delicatessens and coffee shops. To capture a more\nhomogenous, well-defined category, we examined only\nchain fast food restaurants (e.g., McDonald's or Pizza\nHut), classified according to the 8-digit Standard Indus-\nrant, chain).\nKilometers of secondary/connecting and local, neigh-\nborhood and rural roads were obtained from StreetMap\nResearch Institute (ESRI, http://www.esri.com) in Red-\nlands, CA. We defined fast food availability as the num-\nber of chain fast food restaurants per 100 kilometer of\nroadway within a 3 km network buffer to account for\ndifferences in fast food restaurant counts according to\nthe amount of commercial activity in an area. Our\nresearch with Add Health and a similar large population\nstudy suggests that restaurant proximity within a 3 km\nbuffer is the most appropriate distance for examining\nassociations between neighborhood fast food restaurant\navailability and individual level behavior [21,22].\nUrbanicity\nU.S. Census-defined urbanized areas (UA) were used to\nclassify residential locations as non-urban (outside UA) or\nurban (inside UA). Urban locations were further distin-\nguished as 1) low density [95% (75th percentile) devel-\noped land cover] and 2) high density [> 95% developed\nland cover] urban areas based on the area of developed\nland as a proportion of total area within 3 km after exclud-\ning water and ice (calculated using Fragstats software with\nU.S. Geologic Survey National Landcover Data). Our mea-\nsure of developed land cover provides an indicator of\nurban development that is independent of population den-\nsity, which may correlate with cultural or social influences\non diet, and correctly classifies areas as within or outside\nof a UA (Receiver Operating Characteristic curve area =\n0.937). Region was defined as Midwest, West, South, or\nNortheast.\nGIS-derived neighborhood sociodemographics\nWe examined neighborhood sociodemographic character-\nistics within 2000 U.S. Census block groups because they\nmore likely adhere to individually perceived neighborhood\nboundaries [23,24] and are more sociodemographically\nhomogeneous than larger units. Using the federal defini-\ntion of \"poverty area\" [25,26], we dichotomized neighbor-\nhood poverty into > 20% or 20% of population below the\nfederal poverty level. We defined neighborhood-level edu-\ncation as percent of persons 25 years with a college\ndegree. We obtained population density per squared kilo-\nmeter by using Census block-group population count,\nweighted according to the proportion of block-group area\nwithin the 3 km neighborhood buffer, after excluding\nwater and ice, and divided by the area.\nIndividual characteristics\nWe adjusted for the following individual characteristics:\nrace, age, parental income (> $36,000), employment sta-\ntus, has any children, vehicle ownership (\"has a car/\nmotorcycle/van\"). We included parental rather than the\nyoung adults' own education (> high school) because\nparental SES is shown to be a strong predictor of obe-\nsity and obesity-related behaviors [27-29] during the\ncomplex transitional stage of young adulthood [30,31]\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were carried out using Stata ver-\nsion 10.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX). Descriptive\ncharacteristics were calculated within each urban strata.\nIn multivariable analysis, we used negative binomial\nregression to model individual-level, self-reported fast\nfood consumption (days eating fast food in last week) as\na function of neighborhood-level fast food restaurants\nper 100 kilometer roadway within 3 km network buffers,\ncontrolling for neighborhood sociodemographics, indivi-\ndual characteristics, and region. We hypothesized a\npriori that the association between fast food availability\nand fast food consumption is different across non-\nurban, low density urban, and high density urban areas.\nBecause fast food outlets and neighborhood sociodemo-\ngraphics varied dramatically across urbanicity and thus\nlimited comparability across sociodemographic and geo-\ngraphic subpopulations, we stratified by urbanicity to\navoid structural confounding [32].\nOur preference was to use consistent restaurant avail-\nability measures for all strata, but the alternative specifi-\ncations yielded invalid estimates because they violated\nmodel assumptions and/or were highly unstable. For\nexample, nearly 100% of the high density urban respon-\ndents had at least one fast food restaurant within 3 km\nof their home, so the dichotomous measure was\nunstable and relied on 60 observations. In contrast,\napproximately 70% of non-urban respondents had no\nfast food restaurants within 3 km, resulting in a highly\nskewed distribution of fast food availability and hetero-\nskedasticity in our models. Thus, these distributions\nnecessitated different measures across strata of urbani-\ncity. We analyzed fast food availability as a continuous\nvariable for low and high density urban strata and as a\ndichotomous measure (any versus none) for the non-\nurban stratum. Statistical interactions between fast food\navailability and vehicle ownership, poverty, and sex were\nnot significant (p > 0.10) and therefore excluded from\nall models. We tested higher order relationships for all\ncontinuous variables and included where statistically sig-\nParental selection of a neighborhood may be influenced\nby preferences or constraints related directly or indirectly\nto the area's food resources and diet behaviors, which\nmay cluster within school populations. Thus, to address\nour concern that unobserved factors associated with fast\nfood consumption might be associated with neighbor-\nhood choice and school at baseline (Wave I), we tested\nbaseline school indicator variables in the models using a\nHausman-like test [33], which indicated that the school\nindicator variables were necessary (p < 0.05). Thus, we\ninclude school indicator variables in our models to cap-\nture long lasting unobservable influences on individual\ndecisions even after the individual leaves their place of\nresidence at wave I.\nBuffer-based fast food availability measures were indivi-\ndual-level variables. While block groups used for neigh-\nborhood-level control variables could comprise a third\nlevel in multilevel analysis, we did not perform multilevel\nmodeling because census unit boundaries did not corre-\nspond with school catchment areas, so schools and census\nunits were not hierarchically related. Therefore, analyzing\ncensus units as higher levels in multi-level models was not\npossible while controlling for school indicators, the pri-\nmary sampling unit for Add Health. Furthermore, census\nblock groups contained sparse, unbalanced numbers of\nrespondents (mean 1.9, range 1-57 respondents), which\ncan lead to bias in non-linear multi-level models, and clus-\ntering within census block groups was minimal (0.08 intra-\nclass correlation for reported fast food consumption). We\ndo, however, include school indicator variables in the\nmodels, which correct for school-level clustering and\naccount for survey design.\nSensitivity Analysis\nWe evaluated the sensitivity of our findings to the follow-\ning aspects of our fast food availability measure (count of\nchain fast food restaurants per 100 kilometer roadway\nwithin 3 km street network buffers): (1) the variable used\nfor scaling (roadway km vs. population), (2) network vs.\nEuclidean buffers, and (3) 1 km vs. 3 km buffers, and (4)\ntotal (chain and non-chain) vs. chain fast food restaurants.\nCorresponding alternative variables included (1) chain fast\nEuclidean (straight-line) buffers (population counts were\nderived from 2000 US Census block-group population\ncount weighted according to the proportion of block-\ngroup area within the neighborhood buffer); chain fast\nfood restaurant counts per 100 kilometer roadway within\n(2) 3 km Euclidean buffers and (3) 1 km network buffers;\nand (4) total fast food (chain and non-chain) restaurant\ncounts per 100 kilometer roadway within 3 km street net-\nwork buffers.\nWe repeated our multivariable analysis using each of\nthe four alternative fast food availability measures. Few\nnon-urban and low density urban areas had any fast\nfood restaurants within the 1 km network buffer (8%\nand 25%, respectively); therefore, we analyzed fast food\navailability within 1 km in high density urban areas only.\nResults\nOur diverse national sample of 13,150 young adults\nreflects a variety of individual sociodemographic and\nneighborhood differences by urbanicity. In general,\nrespondents of racial/ethnic minority lived in greater\nproportion in high density urban areas (Table 1). Job-\nlessness and car ownership among respondents was\nhighest in non-urban areas (Table 1). All neighborhood-\nlevel characteristics differed across urban strata (Table 2).\nFast food availability was not associated with reported\nfast food consumption in non-urban, low density urban,\nor high density urban areas after controlling for individual\nand neighborhood characteristics (Table 3). In general,\nestimated associations were not sensitive to alternative\ndefinitions of fast food availability: the total fast food mea-\nsure and chain fast food measures scaled by population\nand within different neighborhood buffers yielded similarly\nsmall and precise estimates. However, findings suggest\nthat estimates may be sensitive to measure differences\nwithin the context of high density urban areas. A few esti-\nmates approached marginal significance but in inconsis-\ntent directions.\nDiscussion\nIn contrast with our hypothesis, we found that neighbor-\nhood fast food availability was not related to fast food\nconsumption in our large, national sample of young\nadults residing in neighborhoods throughout the U.S.\nOur findings suggest that targeting neighborhood fast\nfood availability may not reduce consumption or obesity\namong young U.S. adults.\nOur findings, of no relationship between fast food avail-\nability on fast food consumption among adults, are consis-\ntent with prior research [11,34]. One study reports a\npositive association between fast food availability and fast\nfood consumption, but only among a subset of 404 adults\nliving in Montreal who were \"reward sensitive\" [10].\nNull results may reflect: (1) that young adults more\noften purchase and consume fast food in settings other\nthan their residential neighborhoods, such as school or\nworkplace locations, (2) that lifestyle factors such as family\nstructure or employment status are stronger determinants\nof fast food consumption [35-37] or (3) the possibility that\nunmeasured neighborhood and social preferences, such as\nlocation selection factors, more strongly influence dietary\nbehaviors. That is, the social, economic, cultural factors\nthat affect where a person is able or wishes to live may\nalso influence dietary behaviors [38]. Much would be\ngained by broadening research to focus on environmental\ncontexts beyond the residential location, such as college\nand workplace neighborhoods as well as commuting\nroutes. In addition, future research should incorporate\nother neighborhood- and individual-level factors to deter-\nmine which settings and individual and neighborhood\ncharacteristics are most salient for dietary behaviors.\nThe majority of published research has focused on the\nindirect relationship between fast food availability and\nobesity, rather than investigating direct effects on fast\nfood consumption. Greater neighborhood fast food avail-\nability is consistently related to higher obesity [1,3,39,40]\nyet it is possible that this relationship reflects processes\nTable 1 Individual characteristics by urbanicity a\nNon-urban Low density urban High density urban\nRace (%)\na National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, Wave III (2001-2), n = 13,150.

In particular,\nfast food restaurants may cluster with other environmen-\ntal characteristics that influence obesity [20,41]. For\nexample, automobile access may be important for fast\nfood restaurants because of their dependence on drive-\nthru business. Therefore, neighborhoods with more fast\nfood restaurants may promote obesity as a result of dom-\ninating road structures that hinder active transportation.\nOur findings that neighborhood fast food availability is\nunrelated to fast food consumption suggest that associa-\ntions between fast food availability and obesity may\nreflect this or similar processes.\nOur study expands current literature by comparing fast\nfood restaurants scaled by roadway kilometers within a\nstreet network buffer - a measure of availability that\nimproves upon widely used restaurant count measures by\naccounting for urban development and street access -\nacross multiple geographic and sociodemographic char-\nacteristics. We present data from a large sample of U.S.\nyoung adults that uses a more refined urban/rural classi-\nfication than the traditional urban/rural dichotomy.\nFurthermore, we observed vast differences in the avail-\nability of fast food for non-urban compared to urban\nrespondents. While these differences precluded the use\nof comparable availability measures across urbanicity\nlevels, they suggest that the built environment may oper-\nate quite differently in rural, suburban, and urban areas,\nand thus may necessitate different measurement\napproaches. This might also underlie some of the mixed\nStrengths and limitations\nWe present data from a unique and large national cohort\nthat includes a variety of detailed environmental data com-\nbined with individual-level diet data in a cohort of young\nadults from around the U.S. To our knowledge ours is the\nonly large analysis of fast food availability and consump-\ntion that accounts for multiple environmental features and\nindividual characteristics simultaneously.\nYet, our study has some limitations. Our measure of\nfast food consumption is based on self-report and, like all\nself-report diet measures, has inherent recall and report-\ning error. Respondents were not instructed how to report\nmeals versus snacks; that is, snacking at a fast food res-\ntaurant may be undercounted if the respondent did not\nconsider it as a visit. Further, because the question asks\nTable 3 Associations between fast food availability and reported days ate fast food, by urbanicitya [beta coefficient\n(95% CI)]b, c, National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health Wave III (young adulthood; 2001-02)\nNon-urban Low density urban High density urban\nFast food availability measure\nChain fast food restaurant within 3 km network buffer around each individual residence\nSensitivity analyses\nChain fast food restaurant within 3 km Euclidean buffer around each individual residence\nChain fast food restaurant within 1 km network buffer around each individual residence\nCount 1 versus 0 -- -- --\nChain + non-chain e fast food restaurant within 3 km network buffer around each individual residence\na non-urban: distance to UA > 0, low density urban: distance to UA = 0 & % land developed 95%, high density urban: = distance to UA = 0 & % land\nb Negative binomial regression models, controlling for age, race, parental education, household income, owning car, relationship type, having any children,\npopulation density (except model of count per population measure), %college educated, employed (except where effect measure modification), > 20%\npopulation below FPL, % non-Hispanic White\nc Dashes represent un-estimated associations; 1) continuous measures in non-urban areas and dichotomous measures in low- and high-density areas 2) measure\nwithin network 1 km in non- and low-density urban areas.\nd Each sensitivity measure was modeledb separately as continuous variables in low and high density strata and dichotomously in non-urban stratum.\nabout the number of days that respondents ate fast food\nin the last week, fast food consumption may be under-\nrepresented if the respondent ate more than one fast\nfood meal in a day. Yet, this is a measure that is com-\nmonly used to assess fast food consumption in large\npopulation-based studies such as the Panel Study of\nIncome Dynamics and Coronary Artery Risk Develop-\nment in Young Adults [39,42]. Moreover, we are unable\nto ascertain what foods were available and consumed at\neach fast food visit. This is increasingly an issue as fast\nfood restaurants are including healthier options in\nresponse to consumer health concerns [43]. In addition,\nour study is cross-sectional and thus does not capture\nchanges in the food environment or consumption over\ntime. We were also unable to control for factors related\nto selection of residential neighborhoods, however by\nincluding Wave I school indicator variables, we\nattempted to address unmeasured characteristics asso-\nciated with baseline neighborhood. Our 3 km network\nneighborhood buffer may not accurately reflect food-pur-\nchasing areas for different urban settings and sociodemo-\ngraphic subgroups, however estimates for the 1 km\nnetwork buffer were very similar. Significant differences\nin characteristics of respondents included versus\nexcluded in our sample may have biased our results.\nThere may be error in our roadway (StreetMap Pro)\nand food resource data that we are unable to investigate\nin our national sample. In addition, the relatively narrow\nrange of fast food availability may limit our ability to\ndetect effects of fast food availability in relation to fast\nfood consumption. We were not able apply spatial inter-\naction models to our national sample, but our models\naccount for spatial clustering of respondents. The trade-\noff is our large, national sample and the ability to com-\npare individuals living in non-urban, low density urban,\nand high density urban environments, within the context\nof the same cohort. There are no other datasets in which\nsuch a study is possible at the small, geographic unit\nused in our study.\nDespite these limitations, our study is an essential step\nin understanding the allocation and consumption of fast\nfood restaurants across geographic space over the entire\nU.S. and within urbanicity levels, and our findings can\ninform measurement and design in future individual-\nlevel and longitudinal studies.\nImplications\nOur findings are significant in light of the recent efforts to\nreduce obesity though policies targeting the fast food\nenvironment. For example, a one-year ban on fast food\nrestaurants was unanimously put forth in South Los\nAngeles (LA) in an effort to reduce obesity in this low SES\narea, despite lower fast food restaurant per capita relative\nto more affluent West LA [44]. Given evidence that eating\nfast food increases BMI and obesity risk [39,45], reducing\nfast food consumption may be a valuable aim. However,\nspecific environmental factors that influence fast food con-\nsumption among young adults are not well understood.\nOur findings suggest that greater residential neighborhood\nfast food availability may not be an important driver of\nfast food consumption. Greater understanding of how life-\nstyle factors and neighborhood food resources interact to\ninfluence fast food consumption is needed to inform effec-\ntive policy.\nConclusions\nFindings from our large, national sample of U.S. young\nadults do not support the hypothesis that neighborhood\nfast food availability increases the likelihood of fast food\nconsumption among young adults. To understand the\ncomplex relationship between fast food availability and\nindividual dietary behaviors, future research should inves-\ntigate the settings in which young men and women con-\nsume fast food, other individual lifestyle and contextual\ninfluences on dietary choices, and how these processes dif-\nfer across urbanicity and sociodemographic contexts.\nAdd Health data\nThe more extensive restricted-use data, available by con-\ntractual agreement, will be distributed only to certified\nresearchers who commit themselves to maintaining lim-\nited access.
