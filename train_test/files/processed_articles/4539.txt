Traditionally, the bathymetry of ocean was determined\nby a hydrographic ship carrying an echo sounder instrument which was cost effective but time consuming and also often\ninaccessible in shallow water regions. The alternate solution to infer the bathymetry of ocean is remote sensing technology.\nThe multispectral satellite platform such as Ikonos and WorldView images are commercially available, whereas the Landsat-8\nimagery is freely accessible and therefore the Landsat-8 imagery is used. In this study, the first objective was to evolve a\nprocedure to determine the bathymetry of ocean using the ratio transform algorithm. The second objective was to find the\neffectiveness of improving the spatial resolution of Landsat-8 imagery to estimate the bathymetry of ocean, and the results\nof both before and after improving the spatial resolution are compared. The statistical indices, root mean square error and\nmean absolute error, are computed between the algorithm results and the reference hydrographic chart values, and it was\nfound that the improved spatial resolution of Landsat-8 imagery provided better estimation up to 10m depth.\n",

Moreover, in the port, main-\ntaining the depth of man-made channel throughout the\nyear is important for the smooth navigation of large ships.\nTypically, the measurement of ocean depth is done\nusing conventional methods such as pre-measured rope\nor cable passage, placed on the side of the vessel and\nallowed to reach the seabed (Doxani et al., 2012). This\nmethod can retrieve the depth of a single point in time.\nThis method was rapidly replaced by hydrographic ships\ncarrying echo sounder instruments such as single-beam\nand multi-beam echo sounders. The echo-sounding\nmethod is capable of determining the depth accurately\nover clear water coastal environment, whereas in turbid\nwater, the method lacks performance due to infiltration of\nsound waves to the bottom of the ocean. Generally, the\nspeed of ship constrains the surveyors to map the ocean\nregion at a slightly different scale than the desired scale.\nIt is to be noted that the method would take 200years of\nsurvey time to complete swath survey of deep ocean, and\nit would take even more time for shallow coastal areas\nIn order to overcome this inefficiency, various airborne\nlaser bathymetric (ALB) and light detection and ranging\n(LiDAR) systems such as scanning hydrographic opera-\ntional airborne lidar survey (SHOLAS), compact hydro-\ngraphic airborne rapid total survey (CHARTS), laser\nairborne depth sounder (LADS), and experimental\nadvanced airborne research lidar (EAARL) were estab-\nlished to infer the bathymetry of oceans. This method can\neffectively determine the depth of both shallow and clear\nEstimation of bathymetry along the coast\nof Mangaluru using Landsat-8 imagery\nJagalingam Pushparaj and Arkal Vittal Hegde\n Keywords\nSatellite-derived bathymetry, ratio transform algorithm, image fusion, sun glint correction, high-pass filter\nNational Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, Mangaluru, India\nCorresponding author:\nJagalingam Pushparaj, National Institute of Technology Karnataka,\nEmail: lingam.jai10@gmail.com\nOriginal Article\n72 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(2)\nwater coastal environment, but this technique is limited by\nits high purchasing and maintenance costs.\nAlmost all of the above methods take a long interval\nof time to revisit the same location and thus it is difficult\nto monitor the frequent changes of seabed morphology.\nIt is very difficult to infer the bathymetry of shallow\nwater region, as those areas are inflexible to access by\nhydrographic ships carrying echo-sounding instruments.\nAccurate estimation of bathymetry of shallow water\nregion is important for the navigation safety of small\nboats like fishing and for benthic studies (Ma et al.,\n2014). Remote sensing technology can be regarded\nas one of the most promising alternative tools to map\nthe bathymetry of shallow water regions by pairing\nremote sensing data with ground-based measurements\n(Winterbottom and Gilvear, 1997). Remote sensing tech-\nnology has various advantages such as wide coverage of\narea, repetivity of the area over certain period of time,\nand also easy access of data. Therefore, this technology\nprovides a fast solution to map bathymetry of the region,\nwhere rapid change of coastal environment is observed\nBathymetry mapping using remote sensing technology\nis attained from the principle in which the total amount of\nelectromagnetic energy observed and reflected from the\nwater body determines the water depth. The remote sens-\ning technique is available to determine the depth of ocean,\nfor the reason that the water attenuates signal from the bot-\ntommost part of ocean with a strong wavelength depend-\nency (Dekker et al., 2011). However, penetration of\nelectromagnetic wave energy is limited. Therefore, remote\nsensing technique is primarily adopted to infer the depth of\nclear and shallow water region (Zheng et al., 2014).\nThe two important approaches such as analytical\nmethod and empirical method are adopted to retrieve the\nbathymetry of ocean using satellite image. A number of\nanalytical algorithms are available in the literature, which\nmethod for mapping the bathymetry of ocean, a number of\ninput parameters such as water column, properties of\natmosphere and bottom reflectance, and spectral signa-\ntures of suspended and dissolved materials are required\n(Spitzer and Dirks, 1986). Although the analytical method\nis moderately complex and difficult, it has been adopted by\net al. (2012). On the other hand, the empirical method\nestablishes the relationship between the remotely sensed\nradiance of a water body and the depth at sampled loca-\ntions is established empirically without regard to how light\nis transmitted in water (Gao, 2009). In comparison, empir-\nical method requires only few parameters as input which\nare simple and do not require water column parameters.\nHowever, for the calibration function, the method requires\nhydrographically measured data.\nA number of empirical algorithms are proposed to\nretrieve the bathymetry of ocean, among which the most\ncommonly used algorithm is the ratio transform algorithm\ndeveloped by Stumpf et al. (2003). The ratio transform\nalgorithm operates by the mixture of two bands (blue and\ngreen) to detach the difference in depth from difference in\nbottom albedo. The algorithm works on the principle that\nthe observance of water differs from band to band when\nthe depth of water increases. Generally, the spectral band\nof green is high in absorptivity, in which the reflected irra-\ndiance declines quicker than in the low absorptivity of blue\nband (Pe'eri et al., 2014). Therefore, the ratio between the\ngreen and blue bands declines linearly with penetration,\nwhen they are log transformed. It is important to note that\nboth bands are affected similarly with the changes in the\nbottom albedo, but the high absorption band green is\naffected more when the depth varies.\nThe mapping of bathymetry in the clear ocean water is\nsuccessfully mapped up to the depth of 25\u00ad30m by adopting\nthe remote sensing technique (Eugenio et al., 2015; Lyzenga\nocean and marine water environment, the blue and green\nbands (visible bands) of spectrum wavelength are selected for\nremotely sensing bathymetry. In the visible bands, light infil-\ntrates the water column, an exponential attenuation of radi-\nance as a function of both depth and wavelength, and delivers\nthe primary principle for estimating the depth (Gao, 2009).\nSome of the important literatures for estimating the\nbathymetry of ocean using remote sensing technology are\ndiscussed below.\nVahtm\u00e4e and Kutser (2016) investigated linear band\nmodel and the log-transformed band ratio model for deter-\nmining the bathymetry of optically complex Baltic Sea\nregion using airborne HySpex hyperspectral images. The\nresults of both the models are compared by the statistical\nindices of R2 and root mean square error (RMSE). The\nvalues of these indices indicate that the linear band model\nis outperformed by the log-transformed band ratio model\nby accurately estimating the depth of 4\nm. The log trans-\nform model provides inaccurate results for the reason of\nhigh albedo in the near-coastal regions.\nEugenio et al. (2015) implemented the multichannel\nphysical s-based algorithm to determine the bathymetry\nof Granadilla de Abona (Tenerife Island) and Corralejo\n(Fuerteventura Island) areas using WorldView-2 imagery. In\norder to retrieve the depth accurately, the physical s-based\nalgorithm is coupled with radiative transfer model. The cou-\npled model estimates the depth effectively up to 25m. The\nmodel declines the prediction of depth greater than 25m.\nSu et al. (2014) used a geographically adaptive inversion\nand conventional global inversion model to estimate the bot-\ntom depth over Kauai and Barbuda Islands using high-\nresolution Ikonos and Landsat ETM+ satellite imagery.\nThe performance of conventional global inversion model is\nlimited, when the bottom type and water quality vary\nPushparaj and Hegde 73\nspatially within the scene. The geographically adaptive\ninversion model divides the image scene into local areas to\ncalibrate the inversion models for each submission to\nimprove the accuracy and reliability of retrieving the bathym-\netry from remote sensing imagery. It is demonstrated that the\ngeographically adaptive inversion model estimates the\nbathymetry better than the conventional model.\nSu et al. (2008) developed an automated method for\ncalibrating the parameters for a non-linear inversion model\nbased on the Levenberg\u00adMarquardt optimization algo-\nrithm for determining the bathymetry of south shore of\nMolokai Island, Hawaii, using Ikonos satellite imagery.\nDepth data derived from the non-linear inversion model\nare compared with the conventional log-linear inversion\nmodel. It is observed that the overall performance of both\nthe models is similar. The non-linear inversion model pro-\nduced slightly better and accurate estimation of deeper\ndepth of 10\u00ad15m, but slightly less accurate for very shal-\nlow regions (i.e. <5m).\nThe following literature represents the estimation of\nbathymetry along the coast of India.\nPattanaik et al. (2015) used a simple radioactive model\nand a linear radioactive model for estimating the depth\nalong the coast of Odisha, India, using Indian Remote\nSensing (IRS) Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor\n(LISS-III) multispectral imagery. The statistical index R2\nis calculated to compare the result of two models. The\nindex value indicates that the linear radioactive model\noutperformed the simple radioactive model. However,\nboth the methods are very effective to determine the depth\nThe common errors associated while estimating the\ndepth from remote sensing images are as follows: first,\nerror may be presented in the reference bathymetry data\nset (i.e. ground data). Second, water turbidity is one of the\nmost significant factors which decline the accuracy of\nremotely sensed bathymetry. Third, the existence of sub-\nmerged vegetation canopies in the study area also affects\nthe accuracy of remotely sensed bathymetry.\nThe first objective of this study was to evolve a proce-\ndure based on ratio transform algorithm for estimating the\nbathymetry of near shore along the Mangaluru coast of\nKarnataka, India, using Landsat-8 imagery. The second\nwas to adopt the same procedure to find the effectiveness\nof improving the spatial resolution of Landsat-8 imagery.\nThe coefficient of determination R2 is calculated between\nthe pixel value and the reference hydrographic data which\nidentifies the extinction of depth. The results of both before\nand after improving the spatial resolution are compared.\nMaterials and methodology\nStudy area\nThe coastal region of Dakshina Kannada district of\nKarnataka state, India, stretches from Talapady in the\nsouth to Baindur in the north over a distance of about\n140km. The region is enclosed by the Arabian Sea on the\nwest and the Western Ghats on the east. Generally, the\ncoast of Dakshina Kannada adores the tropical hot mon-\nsoon climate due to its latitudinal position. The coast is\ninfluenced by the southwest monsoon which receives\nheavy rainfall during the months from June to September,\nmm. The coast experiences\nhigh temperature throughout the year with relatively con-\nstant high humidity. During the monsoon period, wave\nm is recorded along the coast of Dakshina\nKannada, and in the non-monsoon period, the height of\nwave is less than 1m.\nThe present study area covers a total length of 25\nkm\n(approximately), extending from Ullal region in the south\nshown in Figure 1. Mangaluru is the major city in the coast\nof Dakshina Kannada and gains economic importance due\nto urbanization and industrialization. The Netravathi and\nGurpur rivers originate from the Western Ghats and flows\nwestward and takes a right angle bend near the coast and\nthen flow either northward or southward close to and par-\nallel to the coast. These rivers join together at some point\nbefore they merge into the Arabian Sea. The study area\nalong the coast of Mangaluru covers the range of depth up\nm and also encompasses the New Mangalore Port\nTrust (NMPT).\nMethodology\nThe important steps for determining the bathymetry of\nnear-shore ocean along the coast of Mangaluru using\nLandsat-8 imagery are shown in Figure 2.\nFirst, the procedure is adopted on the original imagery\nof Landsat-8. Second, the same procedure is adopted on\nthe Landsat-8 imagery after improving spatial resolution.\nThird, range of depth obtained from the original and after\nimproving spatial resolution of Landsat-8 imagery is\ncompared.\nBathymetry from space\nGenerally, the bathymetry of ocean is surveyed by ships\ncarrying echo sounders.\nAlthough most of the areas are unexplored due to the\ncomplications of transporting the ship to the deep ocean,\nestimating the bathymetry by ship is cost effective.\nThe remote sensing\u00adbased technique has advantages in\ncomparison with the present echo sounder technique. The\nremote sensing technique absorbs the globe with uniform\nresolution, and repetivity of collecting data over the same\narea helps to monitor changes in the bathymetry of ocean.\nThere are several commercially available multispectral\nsatellite data acquired through Ikonos and WorldView,\nwhich can be used to determine the bathymetry of ocean.\n74 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(2)\nHowever, the Landsat-8 satellite imagery is available\nfreely in the open domain. Hence, Landsat-8 imagery is\nutilized for determining the bathymetry of near-shore\nocean. The Landsat-8 imagery used for this study is down-\nloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS)\nlite acquires total of 11 bands, including blue and green\nwith the spatial resolution of 30m and panchromatic (pan)\nband with the spatial resolution of 15m.\nFor this study, blue, green, and near-infrared (NIR)\nbands of Landsat-8 imagery are used. The spatial resolu-\ntion of blue, green, and NIR bands is 30m. The reason for\napplying the blue and green bands in the coastal environ-\nnm)\ndecreases more rapidly with depth than radiance in the\nnm has a very low transmittance in sea water.\nTherefore, water appears dark and the land appears bright.\nnm) is used for\ndistinguishing water from land.\nThe bathymetry of near-shore ocean is estimated using\nthe blue and green band pair, and most importantly,\nhydrographic chart of the same area is acquired on 18\nMarch 2014. The acquisition dates of both satellite image\nand hydrographic chart are close to each other. Therefore,\nboth the data are co-registered correctly and used for the\nestimation of bathymetry. The hydrographic chart repre-\nsents the ground data with respect to the chart datum. The\ndepth soundings of hydrographic chart were used to ref-\nerence the satellite-derived bathymetry to the chart\ndatum. To perform the ratio transform algorithm, the gain\nand offset (i.e. m0\n) values are computed from the\nsoundings (i.e. hydrographic chart), which are used as\ncontrol points for the algorithm results. During the satel-\nlite image acquisition, instant water level is very unlikely\nto correspond with the chart datum (e.g. mean lower low\nwater (MLLW) or lowest astronomical tide (LAT)), and\nthe measurement of tide height during the acquisition of\nsatellite image is not needed because it is automatically\naccounted for using the control points which are selected\nfrom a hydrographic chart to define the transformation\nparameters. Generally, the water levels over small spatial\nmagnitude are normally well approximated as a vertical\noffset and do not harm the linear relationship between the\nhydrographic chart soundings and the algorithm results.\nThus, the procedure excludes the need for tide-corrected\nsatellite imagery and for tide correctors (Pe'eri et al.,\nSpatial filtering\nBefore performing spatial filtering, technique float is per-\nformed to convert each pixel of satellite image into a float-\ning point representation. Later, a spatial filtering technique\ncalled low-pass filter (kernel size of 5\n\u00d7\n5) is applied on\nthe blue, green, and NIR bands of Landsat-8 imagery to\nremove the speckle noise.\nFigure 1. Location map of study area.\nFigure 2. Methodology for estimating the bathymetry of near-\nshore ocean.\nPushparaj and Hegde 75\nWater separation\nIt is important to separate land from water to estimate the\nbathymetry of ocean. For this purpose, band NIR is used\ndue to the appearance of water in dark and land in bright.\nHere, the land/water threshold value is obtained by draw-\ning a line that crosses from land (bright areas) into the\nwater (dark areas). The obtained threshold value is applied\non the blue and green bands of Landsat-8 imagery to sepa-\nrate land from water.\nGlint and cloud correction\nThis step is intended to correct the radiometric contribu-\ntion from sun glint and low clouds; the method proposed\nby Hedley et al. (2005) is performed to rectify the radio-\nmetric correction on blue and green bands. The linear rela-\ntionship between the NIR and visible bands (i.e. green and\nblue) is established using the linear regression, based on a\nselected sample area of the image pixels. Following the\nrecommendation of Hochberg et al. (2003), sample region\nof image is selected which is evident of sun glint, but the\nspectral brightness of the selected region is expected to be\nconsistent, wherein the region of deep water is ultimate for\nthis. The equation for removing the sun glint and low\nclouds is shown below\n = - -\n( )\nR R b R Min\ni i i NIR NIR\nwhere Ri\nis the pixel value in blue and green bands, bi\nis\nthe regression slope, R Min\n- is the difference\nbetween the pixel NIR value of RNIR\nand the ambient NIR\nlevel MinNIR\nwhich gives the \nRi\nsun glint\u00adcorrected pixel\nbrightness in blue and green bands. The value of MinNIR\nindicates the pixel brightness of NIR with no sun glint, and\ncan be assessed by the minimum NIR value, which is\nfound in the regression sample. Generally, the minimum\nNIR pixel is less prone to problematic outliers than the\nmaximum NIR pixel. The following steps are implemented\nto remove the radiometric correction on blue and green\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Select the sample area where the range of sun glint is\nevident. It is important to note that the image might\nbe more or less homogeneous, and if the sun glint\nwas not present (in deep water), then estimate the\nminimum NIR brightness MinNIR\nin the sample.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 To remove the sun glint from the bandi\n(bandblue\n,\nbandgreen\n), perform the linear regression using the\nselected pixels of NIR brightness (x-axis) against\nbandi\n(y-axis). And determine the slope of the\nregression line for the bandi\n, which is denoted as bi\n.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 To remove the sun glint from the bandi\n(for all pix-\nels in the image), subtract the outcome of bi\nand the\nNIR brightness of the pixel minus MinNIR\nfrom the\npixel value in the bandi\n.\nRatio transform algorithm\nA ratio transform algorithm was proposed by Stumpf et al.\n(2003) to estimate the bathymetry of near-shore ocean.\nThe algorithm makes use of two bands in order to reduce\nthe number of parameters to infer the depth of ocean. It\ndecreases the bottommost radiance of one band more rap-\nidly with respect to depth, when compared to another band.\nThis leads to the ratio between the two bands to differ with\nrespect to the depth. A near-constant attenuation value will\nbe preserved between the ratio of two bands which is noth-\ning but the difference of the diffuse attenuation coefficient\nat two different wavelengths; just depending on notion that\nwater column is uniformly mixed. The algorithm can cut\ndown the error coupled with varying radiation in the\natmosphere, water column, and seafloor, for the reason\nthat both bands are distributed equally.\nTypically in the coastal environment, radiance in the\nnm) attenuates faster with\nnm)\n(Jerlov, 1976). Thus, the variation in ratio between the\nbands is affected further by the depth than by bottom\nreflectance. To infer the bathymetry, the algorithm estab-\nlishes the linear relationship between the ratio of radi-\nance in two bands (green and blue) and water depth\n(Stumpf et al., 2003). The algorithm relies on the circum-\nstance that the absorptivity of water differs spectrally\nfrom band to band. As the depth of water increases,\nreflectance values of the band with higher absorption will\ndecrease proportionately faster than reflectance value of\nthe band with lower absorption. Therefore, when two\nbands are transformed, there exists a linear decrease\nbetween a ratio of high absorption band to a low absorp-\ntion band and water depth.\nThe following equation is used to determine the depth\nof the near-shore ocean\nz m\nL Band\nL Band\nm\nobs i\nobs j\n=\n( )\n( )\n( )\n( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\nln\nln\nwhere Lobs\nis observed radiance of bands, m1\nare\noffset and gain which are determined empirically, i refers\nto blue band and j refers to green band, and z is depth in\nmeters. The advantage of ratio transform algorithm is that\nit takes very few parameters and does not require any opti-\ncal properties to determine the depth of ocean.\nIdentifying the extinction depth\nThe statistical analysis R2 (the coefficient of determina-\ntion) is adopted to estimate the extinction of depth. The\nparameters such as m1\nare obtained from the anal-\nysis of coefficient of determination. The R2 closest to 1\nindicates that there exists a linear relationship between the\npixel value and the reference hydrographic chart datum.\n76 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(2)\nHere, the reference hydrographic chart is overlaid on the\noutput of ln( ( )) / ln( ( ))\nL Band L Band\nobs blue obs green\n, and the\ncorresponding pixel value from the satellite image and cor-\nresponding hydrographic chart value (in meter) is obtained\nto determine the extinction of depth. The region deeper\nthan the extinction depth do match the pixel value with the\nreference hydrographic chart; therefore, the value of R2\ndoes not show clear correlation.\nFinally, the calculated parameter such as observed radi-\nance of band from the ratio of blue and green and the val-\nare provided as input to the ratio\ntransform algorithm and identified the depth along the\nnear-shore ocean of Mangaluru coast, Karnataka. The\nabove procedure for estimating the bathymetry is pro-\ncessed using the ArcGIS 10.2 environment.\nImproving the spatial resolution of Landsat-8\nimagery\nIn order to improve the spatial resolution of satellite image,\nvarious image fusion methods are proposed, such as prin-\ncipal component analysis (PCA) (Chavez and Kwarteng,\n1989), modified intensity hue saturation (M-IHS)\n(Siddiqui, 2003), Brovey transform (BT) (Hallada and\nand wavelet coupled with IHS and PCA (Gonzalez-\nfusion is the process of transferring high spatial resolution\nof pan image to the multispectral image in order to obtain\na single image with both high spatial and high spectral\nresolution. The important conditions for fusing the satellite\nimage are (1) both pan band and multispectral band should\ncover the same area and should be acquired at the same\ntime and (2) wavelength range of pan band and multispec-\ntral band should be close to each other. Here, the wave-\n\u00b5m) and green\nTherefore, the original blue and green bands with the\nspatial resolution of 30m are fused separately with the pan\nband of 15-m spatial resolution. Improved spatial resolu-\ntion of blue and green bands is obtained using the HPF\nimage fusion method as shown in Figure 3(a) and (b).\nHPF\nThe only pan-sharpening HPF tool (ERDAS Imagine 2014\nsoftware) provides single-band fusion option. Therefore,\nthe HPF method has been used for fusing the pan band\nwith blue and green bands individually. The method com-\nputes the ratio R between the spatial size of the pan and\nblue and also pan and green bands. The kernel size of 5\u00d75\nis used based on the suggestion in the ERDAS software\nmanual as the ratio of multispectral band to pan band reso-\nlution is <2.5. A small HPF is placed on the pan band, and\nthe pixel size of the blue and green bands is resampled to\nthat of the high-pass pan band. The filtered high-pass pan\nband is added to the resampled blue and green bands to\nobtain a merged blue and green band with both high spatial\nand rich spectral information.\nAfter improving spatial resolution, it is important to\nassess the quality of blue and green bands, before it is used\nfor estimating the bathymetry of near-shore ocean. The\nquantitative index, spatial correlation coefficient (SCC)\nquality of blue and green bands (i.e. improved spatial reso-\nlution). In order to process this index, the reference blue\nand green band with the spatial resolution of pan band is\nneeded, but in reality it is difficult to obtain the blue and\ngreen band with this requirement. Nevertheless, a refer-\nence image can be obtained by resampling the original\nblue and green bands to the size of the pan band\n(Gangkofner et al., 2008). The index value of SCC close to\n1 indicates that the bands have good spatial quality.\nHere, the value of SCC for the blue band is 0.8995 and\nfor the green band is 0.8815, which is close to the original\nvalue of 1. Therefore, the HPF method generates improved\nspatial resolution of blue and green bands with high spatial\nquality. The HPF method is processed using the ERDAS\n2014 software based on the suggestions in the software\nmanual and also on the basis of existing literature, and the\nspatial quality of fused image is assessed using MATLAB\n2015b. The improved spatial resolution of blue and green\nbands is used to estimate the bathymetry of near-shore\nocean by applying the above procedure. The extinction of\nFigure 3. Improved spatial resolution of (a) blue band and (b)\ngreen band.\nPushparaj and Hegde 77\ndepth before and after improving the spatial resolution is\nalso compared.\nResults and discussion\nIn this study, a procedure was evolved to estimate the\nbathymetry of near-shore ocean using the Landsat-8 satel-\nlite imagery. The results of the procedure implemented are\npresented in Figures 4 to 14. It is important to pre-process\nthe satellite image before estimating the near-shore\nbathymetry. Therefore, the low-pass filter is applied on the\nblue, green, and NIR bands as shown in Figure 4(a) to (c),\nrespectively. To separate the land from water, the threshold\nvalue is estimated from the NIR band as shown in Figure\n5, which indicates the smooth section with low values rep-\nresenting water, whereas the fluctuating high values\nrepresent land. Thus, the threshold value 7000 is applied\non the blue and green bands to separate water from land as\nshown in Figure 6(a) and (b).\nIn order to remove the silver glint, Hedley et al.'s (2005)\nmethod is adopted.\nFirst, the polygon is drawn which covers only the\nwater area (from the recommendations of Hochberg\net al., 2003, areas of deep water are ideal for this). The\npolygon is created over the NIR band (i.e. band contains\nboth dark (water) and bright (land) areas). The extracted\npolygon covers only the water area and is next used to\nextract the water body of the blue and green bands, as\nshown in Figure 7(a) and (b).\nFigure 4. Low-pass filter of (a) blue band, (b) green band, and\n(c) NIR band.\nFigure 5. Threshold value to separate the land from water.\nFigure 6. Removal of land from water for (a) blue band and\n(b) green band.\n78 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(2)\nSecond, linear regression is established for all the\nselected areas of each visible band against the NIR band,\nas shown in Figure 8(a) for blue band and Figure 8(b) for\ngreen band, where x-axis represents the NIR band bright-\nness and y-axis represents the visible band. To remove the\nsun glint and cloud, the parameters such as Ri\n, bi\n,\nand MinNIR\nare needed. Ri\nis the pixel value in the corre-\nsponding blue and green bands, and the regression slope\nbi\nis calculated for the blue and green bands using the fol-\nlowing equation\nSlope =\ny y\nx x\n-\n-\nwhere the values of x1\n, and MinNIR\n(pixel\nbrightness of NIR) are obtained from Figure 8(a) for blue\nband and Figure 8(b) for green band. RNIR\nis the pixel\nvalue of NIR band. Consequently, the removal of sun glint\nof blue and green bands is shown in Figure 9(a) and (b).\nThe ratio transform algorithm is adopted on the pre-\nprocessed blue and green bands and estimates the bathym-\netry of near-shore ocean.

It is impor-\ntant to note that the hydrographic chart is prepared using\nthe in situ data collected using multi-beam echo sounders,\nand it is corrected to MLLW. The pixel value of the bathy\nimage is obtained with the reference of hydrographic chart\nvalue, and so there is no need to measure the tidal height\nduring the image acquisition.\nFrom Figure 10(b), depth points in the hydrographic\nchart and the corresponding pixel values from the bathy\nimage are obtained, and the scatter plot is plotted which is\nshown in Figures 11 and 12, in which x-axis represents the\nhydrographic chart depth and y-axis represents the corre-\nsponding pixel value. To estimate the bathymetry of near-\nshore ocean using ratio transform algorithm, certain\nparameters are required, such as Lobs\n, where\nLobs\nis observed radiance of bands, obtained from the ratio\nof blue and green bands which is shown in Figure 10(a),\nare obtained empirically by correlating the\ncorresponding pixel value to the hydrographic chart value\nThe effectiveness of improving the spatial resolution of\nLandsat-8 imagery for determining the bathymetry of near-\nshore ocean is examined by comparing the results of both\nFigure 7.

Linear regression is established for bands (a) blue\nand (b) green to determine the MinNIR\n.\nPushparaj and Hegde 79\nbefore improving the spatial resolution of 30\nm and after\nimproving the spatial resolution of 15\nm. To validate the\nratio transform algorithm, the statistical indices such as\nRMSE and mean absolute error (MAE) are computed\nbetween the algorithm results and hydrographic chart depth.\nFigure 11 represents the result of estimating the bathym-\netry of near-shore ocean before improving the spatial reso-\nlution of satellite image (i.e. 30m), where the top portion\nof the image shows the scatter plot of the corresponding\npixel value against the hydrographic chart depth, which\nthe depth from 5 to 16m indicates that the corresponding\npixel moderately matches the hydrographic chart depth,\nFigure 9.

Extinction of depth before improving the spatial\nresolution.\nFigure 12. Extinction of depth after improving the spatial\nresolution.\n80 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(2)\nindicates that the pixel value and hydrographic chart depth\ndo not match.\nThe bottom portion of the image explains the pixel\nvalue and its relation to the depth of extinction. Areas\ndeeper than the extinction depth (i.e. 5\nm) do not have a\ngood correlation between the pixel value and the reference\nhydrographic chart depth. Therefore, the ratio transform\nalgorithm can retrieve the depth up to 5m for the 30m spa-\ntial resolution of Landsat-8 imagery.\nFigure 12 represents the result of estimating the bathym-\netry of near-shore ocean (i.e. after improving the spatial\nresolution of satellite image to 15m), where the top portion\nof the image shows the scatter plot of the corresponding\npixel value against the hydrographic chart depth which indi-\ndepth from 10 to 16m indicates that the pixel value moder-\nately matches the hydrographic chart depth, and the value of\npixel value and hydrographic chart depth matches unlikely.\nThe bottom portion of the image explains that the areas\ndeeper than the extinction depth 10m do not have a good\ncorrelation between the pixel value and the reference\nhydrographic chart depth. Therefore, it is evident that\nimproving the spatial resolution of satellite image helps to\ndetermine the higher depth.\nThe required parameters such as Lobs\n(obtained from\nthe ratio of blue and green bands) and m1\n(obtained\nempirically by correlating the corresponding pixel value to\nthe hydrographic chart value) are provided as input to the\nratio transform algorithm and depth ( )\nz is obtained. In\norder to validate the ratio transform algorithm, statistical\nindices RMSE and MAE are calculated between the algo-\nrithm results and the reference hydrographic chart as\nshown in Tables 1 and 2.\nTable 1 indicates that the range of depths between 0 and\nTable 2, it is observed that the highest accuracy\n=\n=\n0.79) is achieved for the range of\ndepths between 0 and 10. It is seen that the ratio transform\nalgorithm tends to underestimate the depths in water\ndeeper than 10m. Therefore, the ratio transform algorithm\ncan better estimate the depth up to 10m for the improved\nspatial resolution of Landsat-8 imagery.\nFigure 13. Estimation of depth before improving the spatial\nresolution.\nFigure 14. Estimation of depth after improving the spatial\nresolution.\nPushparaj and Hegde 81\nFigures 13 and 14 represent the estimation of bathym-\netry before and after improving the spatial resolution of\nsatellite image along the coast of Mangaluru, Karnataka.\nThe Landsat-8 image with the spatial resolution of 30m\n(i.e. before improving the spatial resolution) provided bet-\nter estimation of depth up to 5\nm, which is indicated in\nlight blue and shown in Figure 13, the depth from 5 to 16m\nis shown in blue, and the depth from 16 to 25m is shown\nin dark blue in which the algorithm results and hydro-\ngraphic chart depth do not match. Therefore, the Landsat-8\nimage with spatial resolution of 30m better estimates the\ndepth up to 5m.\nThe Landsat-8 image with the spatial resolution of 15m\n(i.e. after improving the spatial resolution) provided the\nbetter estimation of depth up to 10m (which is colored in\nlight blue) is shown in Figure 14, the depth from 10 to\nm is shown in blue, and the depth from 16 to 25\nm is\nshown in dark blue indicates that the algorithm results and\nhydrographic chart depth do not match. Therefore, the\nLandsat-8 image with improved spatial resolution of 15m\nbetter estimates the depth up to 10m.\nConclusion\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 In this study, the procedure is evolved for estimat-\ning near-shore bathymetry using Landsat-8 satellite\nimagery based on the ratio transform algorithm. In\neffect, this procedure can be best used as an explo-\nration tool to infer the bathymetry of coastal region\nbefore a high-resolution hydrographic survey is\noperated using an expensive instrument such as\nmulti-beam echo sounder.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The results of satellite image show a good correla-\nfor the depth up to 5m for the 30-m spatial resolu-\ntion of Landsat-8 imagery.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The results of satellite image after improving the\nspatial resolution to 15\nm show a good correlation\nthe depth up to 10m. Therefore, improving the spa-\ntial resolution helps to infer the higher depth in the\nregion of coast.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The results of RMSE and MAE between the algo-\nrithm results and hydrographic chart indicate that\nthe ratio transform algorithm can better estimate the\ndepth up to 10m for the improved spatial resolution\nof Landsat-8 imagery.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The procedure used for deriving the satellite\nbathymetry can be used by marine surveyors and\nhydrographic officers. Using the results of this\nprocedure, marine surveyors can assess the cur-\nrent amount of change in depth, and if a weaker\nR2 value is observed, it necessitates the update of\nhigh-resolution hydrographic chart to the exist-\ning one.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 To derive the bathymetry using the satellite\nimagery, environmental conditions such as water\nclarity, cloud cover, and sun glint are needed to be\nconsidered that could deteriorate the accuracy of\nestimated depth.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 It is also to be noted that the selection of reference\nhydrographic chart is important due to the age of\nthe hydrographic survey or the old technique and\nequipment used to conduct the survey.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Finally, regardless of improvement in the satellite-\nderived bathymetry, the procedure evolved can be\nused as an exploration tool for operating the hydro-\ngraphic survey, and this is not an alternative for\nacoustic hydrographic survey.\n"
