The reported preva-\nlence of PA varies widely, ranging from 1.4\u00ad32%, due to\nvarying study design and screening criteria. However,\nautonomous aldosterone secretion may be present in more\nthan 30% of hypertensive patients, according to recent\nfindings.1 The recently investigated prevalence of PA in\nthe Chinese population is 7.1% within refractory hyper-\ntension, and within this the proportion of hypokalemia is\nPA comprises a wide spectrum of conditions ranging\nfrom a solitary unilateral nodule producing aldosterone to\nbilateral diffuse or nodular hyperplasia, with several inter-\nmediate phenotypes. Two major causes of PA are recog-\nnized: idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA), accounting\nfor 60\u00ad70% of patients with PA, and aldosterone-producing\nThe renin\u00adangiotensin system (RAS) mediates several\nclassical physiological processes, including body water\nand electrolyte homeostasis, blood pressure (BP) regula-\ntion and aldosterone generation, based on the angiotensin\nII type 1and type 2 receptors (AGTR1, AGTR2) subtype\nsystem.

Its expression product \u00ad AGTR1 \u00ad plays an integral\nrole in BP, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of hyper-\ntension. The association between AGTR1 gene polymor-\nphisms and essential hypertension has been widely studied,\nbut the results remain controversial.4 Otherwise, AGTR1\nexpression was reported repeatedly to be correlated with the\nfunctional status of adrenocortical tumors, including APA.5\nThe gene encoding AGTR2 is located on chromosome\nsingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci. For its part,\nAGTR2 mainly plays a role in cardiovascular function and\nprogrammed cell death. It has also been demonstrated that\nexpression of AGTR2 in APA tissue was lower than that in\nnormal adrenal gland tissues. Our previous research showed\nthat the rs5194 SNP in the AGTR2 gene was significantly\nassociated with the risk of APA.6 On the basis of our previ-\nous study and other relevant literature, we decided to fur-\nther investigate the associations of multi-polymorphisms in\ntwo AGTR genes with the risk of PA.\nMaterials and methods\nSubjects\nThrough screening thousands of suspicious patients from\nthe Han population from Fujian Province of China with the\naldosterone plasma renin activity ratio, our study enrolled\n202 sporadic patients who were hospitalized and diag-\nnosed with PA after endocrinal confirmatory tests, mostly\nthe saline infusion test and Captopril Challenge test.\nComputed tomography scanning of the adrenal glands and\nadrenal vein sampling were undertaken for subtype diag-\nnosis according to the latest guideline for PA. Another 188\nhealthy Chinese volunteers without hypertension or any\nadrenal disease were recruited as the control group from\nthe health examination center of the First Affiliated\nHospital of Xiamen University. The study was approved\nby the Institutional Ethical Committee (EC-ZD-002\u00b702) of\nthe hospital, and written informed consent forms were\nobtained from each participant before any examination or\ndata collection.\nSelection of SNPs loci\nBased on public SNP databases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.\ngov/SNP/ and http://www.hapmap.org/) of CHB popula-\ntions and published literature, data for SNPs in theAGTR1/\nAGTR2 genes were selected for our study. We then applied\nHaploview software version 4.2 to choose the tagSNPs,\nwhich enabled us to capture all common SNPs within the\nentire AGTR1/AGTR2 gene sequences according to r2\nlinkage disequilibrium (LD) (threshold 0.8) and a minor\nDNA extraction\nVenous blood of each individual was sampled into sterile\nanticoagulation tubes and cryopreserved. Genomic DNA\nwas isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes using the\nTIANamp Blood DNA Kit (TIANGEN Biotech, Beijing,\nChina) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nGenotyping\nThe SNPgenotyping work was performed using an improved\nmultiplex ligation detection reaction (iMLDR) technique\ndeveloped by Genesky Biotechnologies Inc. (Shanghai,\nChina). A multiplex PCR-ligase detection reaction method\nwas used in the iMLDR. For each SNP, the alleles were dis-\ntinguished by different fluorescent labels of allele-specific\noligonucleotide probe pairs. Different SNPs were further dis-\ntinguished by different extended lengths at the 3'end. A ran-\ndom sample accounting for ~5% (n=20) of the total DNA\nsamples was directly sequenced using Big Dye-terminator\n(Applied Biosystems) to confirm the results of iMLDR.\nStatistical analysis\nDemographic and clinical data between groups were com-\npared using the 2test or Student's t-test. Quantitative vari-\nables were expressed as the mean \u00b1SD. Multiple\ncomparisons were made using one-way analysis of vari-\nance (ANOVA), and Bonferroni correction was applied to\navoid false positives.\nThe allele and genotype frequencies of both groups were\ncomparedusing2 statisticsorFisher'sexacttest.Compliance\nwith Hardy\u00adWeinberg equilibrium in each group was subse-\nquently assessed using the Haploview. An expectation maxi-\nmization algorithm was used for all haplotype analysis on the\nSHEsis, a web-based program which also helped to manage\nthe calculation of LD and genetic association.7,8 Odds ratios\n(ORs) and their adjustment for relevant variables (gender,\nage, body mass index (BMI), smoking and alcohol consump-\ntion) were calculated as estimates of risk relative to disease,\nand 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained by logistic\nregression analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using\nSPSS version 13.0 (Chicago, Illinois, USA).

Based on several basic\ninvestigations the intra-adrenal RAS, which is a major\nregulator of aldosterone generation, was extensively\nfocused on in investigating the mechanism of excessive\naldosterone secretion.9,10 To date, the pathophysiological\nrole of the RAS in PA has been elucidated and compo-\nCYP11B2 and mineralocorticoid receptor have been\nreported to be widely involved in the regulation of auton-\nomous aldosterone. It is known that the activation of\nAGTR1 can trigger the synthesis and secretion of aldos-\nterone. The increased expression of AGTR1 mRNA in\nAPA has long been confirmed.11 Previous research has\nsuggested that AGTR2 may partially contribute to the\noverproduction of aldosterone in angiotensin II (AT II)-\nresponsive APA,12 which may derive from its antagonistic\neffect towards the AGTR1-mediated function of AT II\nincluding cell growth, vasoconstriction and cardiovascu-\nlar fibrosis. Otherwise, a pathological continuum between\nAPA and IHA featuring a transition from hyperplasia to a\nnodular phase has been proposed, suggesting that patho-\ngenic mechanisms common to these conditions exist.13\nOur earlier study preliminarily demonstrated that down-\nregulation of AGTR2, leading to a deficiency in counter-\nbalancing the effects of angiotensin II mediated by\nAGTR1, could finally promote adrenal zona glomerulosa\ncell proliferation and aldosterone hypersecretion.14\nAccording to a series of investigations concerning the\nconnections between AGTR1/2 and the pathology of the\nadrenal cortex, we speculate that the overexpression of\nAGTR1 and reduced expression of AGTR2 may be asso-\nciated with the pathophysiological processes of PA and\nVariation position Genetic model Genotype Frequency Adjusted p-\nvalue\nAdjusted\n*The genotypes of additive model were converted to continuous variables to calculate (0=\"GG\"or\"CC\"; 1=\"GT\"or\"CT\"; 2=\"TT\").\nTable 5.

Although such\nan assumption needs more studies for clarification,\nAGTR1 and AGTR2 could be presumed to be factors in\nassociation with the susceptibility of PA.\nThe aim of the present pilot study was to explore\nwhether genetic variants of AGTR constitute associated\nfactors for the hereditary susceptibility of PAin the Chinese\npopulation. To date, very few epidemiological studies have\nbeen published related to the predisposition to PA, mostly\nfocused on APA, and these have analyzed few SNPs. In\nthis sense, our study is novel and takes us one step further\nin finding the genetic risk of developing this disease.\nBased on the LD patterns and empirical genome-wide\ndata from the international HapMap project, we obtained a\nset of informative SNPs (tagSNPs) which are representa-\ntive of the remaining SNPs, so that the genotyping burden\ncan be reduced without much loss of power for disease\nassociation studies.15,16 In this context, eight tagSNPs\nwithin the intron of AGTR1 were selected to cover all the\ngenetic information of this region. Another two tagSNPs\nidentically shared information in their vicinity. However,\nsuch a method inevitably misses some rare SNPs associ-\nated with this disease since MAF0.05 was used to select\nthe tagging SNPs based on the limited sample size.\nhas been investigated elsewhere to study the relationship\nbetween genetic variants in RAS and assumed salt-related\nwith diastolic BP(DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP).\nIn particular, the number of T alleles was associated with\nan increased mean DBP response to low-sodium interven-\ntion.17 Considering that the mineralocorticoid aldosterone\ncan regulate the level of sodium in the body and may inter-\nact with sodium loading to induce hypertension as well as\ncardiac injury,18 PA and sodium intake probably share\nsome genetic pathways or markers in multiple environ-\nmental\u00adgenetic interactions, which may play an important\nrole in salt-sensitive hypertension and aldosterone modu-\nlation.19 Our findings that carriers of the C allele in\nwith PA raised an issue that the major allele corresponded\nto the risk allele. Such a phenomenon is not rare in genome-\nwide association studies, especially in complex disease.\nCarriers of the major allele have a higher risk of develop-\ning some less prevalent disease, indicating that the muta-\ntion makes the locus protective in terms of its own\nsusceptibility. However, it is more likely that this locus\nrepresents only a small increment in risk together with\nsome main causative variants near or far from this region\nwhich have the main genetic effect on the association. The\nunderlying rationale of this inconsistency derives from the\ncomplexity of the genetic architecture, and must be\nexplained in terms of heredity, variation and evolution. In\naddition, Gu et al.20 found that a potential interaction of\nCYP11B2-AGTR1 is involved in the etiology of hyperten-\nsion. Against the background that the pathogenesis of\nessential hypertension is undefined, the question of\nwhether secondary hypertension caused by PA follows a\nsimilar gene\u00adgene interactive model is worthy of further\nresearch. If this is the case, AGTR1 interacting with other\ngenes may constitute a disease locus of secondary hyper-\ntension caused by hyperaldosteronism.\nWith regard to rs5193, the GT genotype seemed to pro-\noverdominance model. However, such a tiny difference in\nstatistics and the insignificant difference in the distribution\nof corresponding alleles drove us to analyze in more depth,\nsince only a small proportion of loci had polymorphisms\nmaintained by heterozygote advantage.21 After stratifica-\ntion by sex, we found that a significant difference only\noccurred in the female subgroup (p=0.016), and not in\nmales (p=0.169). Knowing that females originally showed\na higher prevalence of PA than males, this result could be\ninterpreted that polymorphisms of rs5193 may rooted in\nthis sex-linked disease. Otherwise, Min Zhang et al.22\nreported that the T allele of rs5193 linking with the A allele\nof rs5194 had cardioprotective effects on essential hyper-\ntension.As we know, an excess of autonomous aldosterone\nsecretion causes great cardiovascular damage independent\nof secondary hypertension. Interestingly, our finding that\nTable 6.

Thus, we\nwonder whether the rs5193 gene polymorphism is associ-\nated with cardiovascular events caused by hypertension\nsecondary to PA, although more targeted research is\nrequired to prove this in the future.\nIn our study, no haplotype was found to be significantly\ndifferent between cases and controls. The one with most\npotential \u00ad Hap4 TATCACGC \u00ad failed to show signifi-\ncance after Bonferroni correction. However, there is con-\nsiderable controversy about adjusting the p-value after\nmultiple tests in clinically orientated studies.23 With this in\nmind, whether a truly important difference was hidden by\nthe increased likelihood of type II errors remains unknown.\nIn addition, our effort to explore any gene marker to distin-\nguish IHA and APA found no significant difference, which\nmay be mainly due to the small sample size ofAPApatients\n(n=57), despite their intrinsic similarity.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to\nexploreAGTR-associatedlociinPApathogenesis.Therefore,\nsome limitations of the study must be taken into account for\ncorrect interpretation of our data. First, as a retrospective\ncase-control study, the number of patients is relatively small\nbecause of the very low prevalence of PA, and the statistical\npower is accordingly reduced. Larger case-control studies,\nas well as independent cohorts of patients, are suggested to\nvalidate our findings. Second, more data in Chinese, espe-\ncially in other ethnic groups, are necessary in future studies\nin order to make results more representative, since all our\nsubjects are confined to the Han people of Fujian Province,\nsoutheast of China. Third, the confounding factors between\ngroups are not limited to those mentioned above. It is diffi-\ncult to adjust for other environmental factors, such as diet,\nphysical activity and metabolic level. Last but not the least,\nit should be emphasized that the genetic pathways underly-\ning this complex disease remain largely elusive due to\nunpredictable factors such as polygenic inheritance, genetic\nheterogeneity, incomplete penetrance, gene\u00adenvironment\ninteraction and others.24 Thus, the variations of AGTR may\nbe related just to risk factors, inducing factors or impact fac-\ntors, rather than directly to the disease itself.\nConclusions\nin AGTR1 may play a role in susceptibility to PA in the Han\nChinese population, with the C allele predisposing to it.\nMeanwhile, females carrying the G allele on rs5193 of\nAGTR2 may be also susceptible to PA. Due to the complexity\nof definite diagnosis of PAand our limited number of patients,\nthe present results require confirmation in larger studies.\n"
