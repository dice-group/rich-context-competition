The technique has its origins in attempts to inform military strategy during\nthe Cold War (see Rescher, 1998) and has evolved to become a quite popular method in\npolicy studies, particularly in the health field (e.g. Adler and Ziglio, 1996; Keeney et al.,\n2011). Previous logistical difficulties have diminished with the advent of internet access,\nwhich has allowed the assemblage of `virtual' panels of experts. However, review arti-\ncles have been critical of the standard of much of Delphi Group research and it has\ndeveloped an unenviable `quick and dirty' reputation. Typical problems include: panel\nrecruitment bias, poor specification of questions/tasks by the moderator, high rates of\npanel attrition, problematic consensus where it is unclear what actually constitutes con-\nsensus, and `specious consensus' where panellists conform out of sheer boredom (see\nPotentially, Delphi Group methods can assist in the communication of research\nfindings to policy-makers. The relationship between sociological research and policy-\nmaking is contested and problematical (see Bloor, 2004). Becker's famous rhetorical\nquestion `Whose side are we on?' (1967) was a call for a partisan sociology which\nchampioned the underdog against the elites, including the policy-maker elites, and\nBurawoy (2005) called for a `public sociology' that would appeal directly to the public\nover the heads of policy-makers. Harvey Moloch (1994) has ruefully pointed out that\nsociologists who wish to `speak truth to power' actually have great difficulty finding\nanyone to speak to at all. In contrast, Bulmer (1982) has described a different model of\nsociological influence, the `enlightenment model', where social scientists influence\npolicy-makers osmotically through extended informal contact, but it has to be objected\nthat, in Anglo-Saxon countries at least (France and Scandinavia might possibly form\ncontrasting cases), sociologists are rare visitors to the corridors of power. It follows\nthat, while policy-makers may be the anticipated audience for much research, many\nsociologists are inexpert in drawing out the policy implications of research findings\nand could use some expert help.\nThis paper does not seek to rehabilitate Delphi Groups as a stand-alone research\nmethod, but rather considers the possible limited role of Delphi Groups within multi-\nmethod research projects, where expert input from a Delphi Group in the end-phase of\nthe project can potentially serve a number of useful functions. There is a large literature\non the virtues and drawbacks of mixed method designs that has been widely reviewed\net al., 2003), a handbook on mixed methods has been published (Tashakkori and Teddie,\n2003), and there is a journal, the Journal of Mixed Methods Research1 devoted to mixed\nmethods studies, so only a brief recapitulation is necessary here. The most recent review\n(O'Cathain, 2010) lists four virtues of mixed methods. One of these virtues, `develop-\nment or facilitation', is a mere commonplace \u00ad the use of one method, say a postal sur-\nvey, to facilitate the recruitment of a sub-sample for another method, say semi-structured\nface-to-face interviews. A second virtue, that of `emancipation' or giving voice to the\nmarginalised or oppressed, is controversial and open to dismissal as tokenism.\nThe third claimed virtue of mixed methods is also controversial, but less readily dis-\nmissible. Where a Delphi Group is part of a mixed method design and the expert panel-\nlists of the Delphi Group have also been among the research participants in the wider\nstudy, as interviewees or subjects of ethnographic observation, the Delphi Group method\nthen becomes, in effect, a variant of that form of `methodological triangulation'(Denzin,\n1970) known (misleadingly) as `member validation'(Emerson and Pollner, 1988). While\ntriangulation \u00ad the comparison of findings on the same research topic generated by dif-\nferent methods \u00ad is often seen as a mark of good research practice, member validation is\nusually dismissed as a well-meaning but wrong-headed attempt to demonstrate the accu-\nracy of a social science account of a social activity by appeal to the judgement of those\npersons taking part in that social activity. The problems with member validation have\n72). There is a lurking positivist assumption of just a single paramount reality available\nfor sociological description. There is also the concern that collectivity members, shown\nthe sociologist's account and asked to validate it, may find it too politically sensitive and\nmay fear that it will be used as a weapon against them by others. Alternatively, members\nshown an account for validation purposes may be quite unconcerned and may only read\nthe sociologist's report in a superficial and uncritical way. Further, there is the possibility\nthat members' views may change over time \u00ad what they previously would have vali-\ndated, they now reject, or vice versa. And, finally and most importantly, there is a failure\non the part of the investigator to appreciate that the member validation exercise is not a\nneutral information-gathering medium: like all methodological processes, it shapes the\nproduct it is designed to produce. However, there is no need for a Delphi group exercise\nto be oriented towards the validation of research findings: it may still be a very useful\nexercise if it produces a critical panellist's response to preliminary findings and leads to\nthe reconsideration of earlier data, to the amendment or qualification of preliminary find-\nings, and/or to the sharpening of conclusions and recommendations. This indeed is the\nfourth (and uncontroversial) virtue of mixed method designs, that of comprehensiveness,\nwhereby a topic can be addressed more widely and completely by a range of datasets.\nThus, a Delphi Group constituted from research participants (as in the case below) may\nbe simply a useful additional dataset in a multi-method research design, without there\nbeing any ambition to conduct a member validation exercise.\nFor illustration, we report on the progress of a Delphi Group exercise where a virtual\nexpert panel was tasked to reach consensus on the policy recommendations to be drawn\nfrom a project on the effectiveness of enforcement of new international regulations on\nship emissions. A methods section briefly describes the wider study within which the\nDelphi Group was conducted and describes in more detail the composition and conduct\nof the group. Two further sections illustrate, first, the process whereby a draft recom-\nmendation of the study was modified through the Delphi process, and second, the pro-\ncess whereby a possible additional recommendation (proposed by two separate Delphi\nGroup members) was rejected. This is followed by an extended conclusion, embracing\nsome pragmatic suggestions on the conduct of Delphi Groups and an examination of the\nstrengths and weaknesses of Delphi Groups within mixed method research designs.\nHowever, first of all, some background material needs to be presented on the regula-\ntion of ship emissions for readers to make sense of the reported Delphi deliberations.\nUntil very recently, most vessels burnt a cheap residual fuel oil, a by-product of oil refin-\neries (that which is not sold for marine fuel is sold for road tar). However, the exhaust\nplume from burning that residual fuel contains pollutants \u00ad sulphur compounds (SOx),\nnitrogen compounds (NOx) and fine particulate matter \u00ad that have contributed to acidifi-\ncation and to pulmonary and coronary diseases (Winebrake et al., 2009). The UN agency,\nthe International Maritime Organization (IMO) brought into force regulations to control\nthese emissions in 2005 and 2010. Emission Control Areas (ECAs) were set up in the\nBaltic (2006), the North Sea/English Channel (2007) and the coasts of North America\n(2012). Initially, the sulphur limit on fuel in the ECAs was set at 1.5%, reducing to 1.00%\nare able to reduce the sulphur content of residual fuel oil to 1.0% (known as low sulphur\nfuel oil) by judicious blending of residual fuel oils and distillate. However, a limit of\n0.1% sulphur will eliminate the possibility of vessels burning residual fuel oil unless they\nfit expensive exhaust abatement technology \u00ad a dispensation which need not concern us\nhere. Effectively, vessels in the ECAs will be required to switch to burning much more\nexpensive distillate fuel and ship operators (at a time of over-capacity and falling freight\nrates) will find their fuel costs exceeding their crewing costs. In addition, the EU has\nintroduced, from January 2010, an additional requirement in EU ports for all ships at\nberth (where only auxiliary engines are in use) to burn fuel with 0.1% sulphur.\nThe main means of enforcing these and other IMO regulations is by `port-State con-\ntrol', that is, the equal enforcement of international shipping regulations by the port\nState, regardless of a ship's flag. Since 1982, the Paris Memorandum of Understanding\non Port State Control (2010) has established a common methodology of ship inspections\nfor foreign-flagged vessels berthing in European ports. The inspections are not exhaus-\ntive: in a frequently used phrase, port-State control is `a sample, not a survey'. Port State\nControl Officers are required to use their discretion, and officers who encounter initial\nproblems are likely to then inspect progressively more areas of the ship's operation and\nequipment, while those who do not encounter initial problems may proceed to a `light-\ntouch' inspection. Officers are empowered to detain ships with serious deficiencies until\nthose deficiencies are rectified, a sanction which can be expensive for ship operators. But\narguably a more powerful deterrent is the `naming and shaming' of ships with deficien-\ncies on industry websites, which impacts on those vessels' abilities to attract custom\nfrom charterers (note however that those industry websites currently only report vessels'\nIMOdeficiencies,nottheirEUdeficiencies\u00adseethesectionbelow,`DelphicModification\nof a Policy Recommendation'). The most widely used method of enforcing the new sul-\nphur regulations is for officers to check the vessel's previous Bunker Delivery Notes\n(which the vessel is required to retain), which record the sulphur content of the bunkered\nfuel, and for officers to check the Oil Record Book, where a switch-over to a different\nfuel must be recorded by the Chief Engineer. The European Commission has requested\nMember States to take samples of fuel, on occasion, for testing of the sulphur content.\nHowever, only Denmark, Germany, Holland and Sweden have so far equipped their\nofficers with fuel sampling kits. Testing of fuel is expensive and port-State control is not\na revenue-generating activity.\nFinally, it should be noted that, over time, the operation of port-State control appears\nto have served to increase the quality of shipping, at least in respect of those vessels trad-\ning in and out of European ports. A `culture of compliance'is said to have recently grown\nup among ship operators (Bloor, Sampson et al., 2013). However, the potential rewards\nfor non-compliance with the sulphur regulations are very substantial: currently (July\n2013), the price difference between high sulphur fuel oil outside the ECAs and the com-\npliant 1.0% low sulphur fuel oil is around $18 per tonne, and the price difference between\nhigh sulphur fuel oil and 0.1% distillate is a massive $325 per tonne. There are therefore\nconcerns that, if the fuel regulations are ineffectively policed, then this new culture of\ncompliance may disintegrate.\nMethods\nThe wider research project (funded by the UK's Economic & Social Research Council)\nwas comparative between Sweden and the UK and involved observation of 16 ship\ninspections (involving in turn extended visits to seven different Port State Control\noffices in the UK and Sweden) and 50 qualitative interviews with inspectors, regulators,\nshipping industry stakeholders (ship operator managers, shipping industry representa-\ntives, fuel experts, trade unionists and others) and environmental NGOs. A final report\nwas drafted of around 9,000 words and circulated to seven Delphi Group members; the\nreport concluded with seven policy recommendations. It will be appreciated that, in a\ndesign that had already incorporated semi-structured interviews, it would only be pos-\nsible to gauge reactions to the draft policy recommendations by additional use of either\nan electronic `real-time' focus group or an electronic Delphi Group, and with research\nparticipants having crowded diaries and other urgent commitments, a Delphi Group was\nmuch easier to convene. The Delphi Group members were drawn from the 50 interview-\nees, but they were not selected randomly. Instead, they were selected purposively as\nlikely to have a range of viewpoints, and (on the basis of their views at interview) likely\nto be sufficiently committed to the study (or the topic) to be willing to take part in the\nrather arduous Delphi Group process. The seven members comprised two regulators,\ntwo ship operator managers, one shipping industry representative, one inspector (aka\nPort State Control Officer), and one member of an environmental NGO. All seven\nagreed to take part.\nThe purposive selection of Delphi Group participants with a range of backgrounds\nincreased the likelihood of receiving contributions from Delphi Group members which\nexhibit partial disagreement with the seven policy recommendations. In this instance,\nthe Delphi Group process and the researcher's analytic response are therefore analo-\ngous to the search for `deviant cases', which is at the heart of the longstanding proce-\ndure known as `analytic induction' (Cressey, 1953; Bloor, 1978), whereby the analyst\nsearches for deviant cases that do not fit with a preliminary hypothesis and seeks to\nmodify and extend the hypothesis to accommodate the deviant cases, thereby extend-\ning and deepening the analysis. In Seale's judgement: `as a reminder to be systematic\nin the search for negative instances and to modify one's theories in the light of new\nevidence, the spirit of analytic induction seems worth preserving in qualitative work'\nThe Delphi Group process was scheduled to take place through the month of\nSeptember 2012. On Monday 3 September, the first author (acting as group moderator)\nre-emailed the draft final report with the recommendations (it had been circulated in the\nfirst place as part of the Delphi Group recruitment process), with a request that individu-\nals send their suggested changes to the recommendations back to the moderator by the\nend of the day on 5 September. This was `Round 1'. The moderator would then circulate\nthe anonymised suggestions (and the moderator's response) to the rest of the group, who\nwould then have an opportunity to respond by the end of 10 September. Those responses\nwould then lead to a further iteration of the process (`Round 2'), with the prospect of\nfurther iterations occurring to follow, in the hope of eventually arriving at consensual\nagreement with the re-drafted recommendations by the end of the month. The initial 3\nSeptember email concluded:\nYour participation in the group is based on your special expertise [...], but you are not being\nasked to participate as a representative of your organisation or company. I would therefore ask\nyou not to discuss the draft recommendations and your suggestions with colleagues. At the end\nof the Delphi Group, the final report together with the (hopefully) consensual recommendations\nwill be made publicly available. To reiterate, no reports of the project will name any of the\nDelphi Group members.\nIn the event, only four of the seven responded to the first email. Fortunately, however,\nthese four still represented a range of expertise \u00ad one regulator, one ship operator man-\nager, one inspector and one member of an environmental NGO. All four participants had\nsuggestions on modifications to at least one of the recommendations (one group member\noffered suggestions on four of the seven recommendations), and two participants inde-\npendently suggested an additional recommendation (see the section `Delphic Suggestion\nof an Additional Policy Recommendation'below). The moderator responded privately to\neach of the participants, in part in order to seek more clarity on their suggestions, and\nthen (in Round 2) circulated all the comments (with some abridgement and clarification),\nplus his responses, plus revised recommendations.\nIn response to Round 2, two of the initial participants offered further comments.\nNone of the Round 1 non-respondents commented, although they received invitations\nto do so. The two responses to Round 2 resulted in some further small changes, circu-\nlated along with the Round 2 comments and moderator's responses as Round 3. No\nfurther suggestions were received after Round 3 (sent out on 16 September). However,\nfurther information later received, in response to enquiries the moderator made in fol-\nlowing up one of the suggestions made in Round 2, led to a further small modification\nand a final version of the recommendations (Bloor, Baker et al., 2013) being sent out\nDelphic modification of a policy recommendation\nIn all, three of the seven initial recommendations dispatched to the panellists in Round 1\nunderwent some important modifications. We illustrate the Delphi process by reference\nto the second of those recommendations, which read as follows:\n2. That all EU countries inform the European Commission of the IMO number of all vessels\nfounded to be non-compliant in respect of the 0.1% sulphur port fuel regulations, with a view\nto the Commission seeking to ensure that these non-compliant cases appear on Equasis.\nWhereas the final version read as:\n2. Publication of Non-Compliant Vessels on Equasis. That all EU countries inform the\nEuropean Commission of the IMO number of all vessels found to be non-compliant in respect\nof the EU 0.1% sulphur port fuel regulations, with a view to the Commission seeking to ensure\nthat these non-compliant cases appear on Equasis. It is proposed that the Equasis record contain\nthe vessel's name, IMO number, inspection place and date, and the fact that the 0.1% EU\nat-berth provision has been violated. It should be noted that, at present, a vessel that is detained\nfor burning fuel in port that is in violation of the EU 0.1% sulphur at berth regulation, can only\nappear in THETIS and Equasis if the Port State Control Officer has recorded this regulatory\nviolation as a deficiency under IMO's ISM code.\nThis recommendation relates to the previously mentioned importance of the deterrent\neffect of `naming and shaming' non-compliant vessels on shipping industry websites\n(see, for example, the discussion in Bloor et al., 2006). Such websites (the most influen-\ntial of which is Equasis) are widely consulted by charterers, insurers and others, and\nvessels with poor compliance records will find the freight rates that they can command\nwill be severely adversely affected. Equasis obtains its information on the inspection\nrecords of vessels from the THETIS website of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding\non Port State Control. Since THETIS is the Paris MoU website (and since the Paris MoU\nincludes a number of non-EU members), it only records the results of inspections in\nrespect of IMO (and International Labour Organization) regulations, not in respect of EU\nregulations. However, since the European Commission bankrolls THETIS, it seems rea-\nsonable for the Commission to request the inclusion in THETIS of inspection records\nshowing non-compliance with EU regulations on sulphur levels. Once those inspection\nrecords have appeared in THETIS, they will automatically appear on other websites like\nEquasis.\nThe final version of Recommendation 2 incorporated suggested changes from three\npanellists. Two of the changes were minor: first, the final version incorporates a sugges-\ntion from one panellist that each recommendation should have its own sub-heading (in\nthis case, `Publication of Non-compliant Vessels on Equasis'); and second, the final ver-\nsion incorporates a full summary of all the recommended information on the vessel to be\npublished on Equasis (i.e. the vessel's name, and the place and date of inspection), as\nwell as the vessel's unique IMO number and the regulatory violation. The third change\nwas more important and concerned a suggestion from a panellist that the violation of the\nEU regulation on the sulphur level of fuel to be burnt in port could still be recorded on\nthe THETIS website as if it were a violation of an IMO regulation, if the inspector in\nquestion recorded the violation as a deficiency under the IMO's International Ship\nManagement (ISM) Code, Paragraph 1.2.3, of which states that the vessel's safe manage-\nment system should ensure `compliance with mandatory rules and regulations' (IMO,\n2002). The ISM code is a requirement for all vessels to have formally laid-down\nmanagement systems for all the standard procedures involved in vessel operation (berth-\ning, cargo-handling, etc., etc.).\nThe third suggestion was a valuable contribution to the study. Treating violation of the\nEU regulation as if it were a deficiency under the IMO's ISM code would be a powerful\nincentive to regulatory compliance: not only would it result in the naming and shaming\nof the vessel in Equasis, but (if the violation was identified as grounds for detention of\nthe vessel in port by the inspector in question) the ISM code deficiency would automati-\ncally trigger the requirement for an additional audit by the vessel's flag-State, with the\npossibility of delay and expense for the ship operator. None of the Port State Control\nOfficers interviewed in the study had suggested that the ISM code could be used in this\nmanner and, on the one occasion when an observed inspection found a vessel to be burn-\ning non-EU-compliant fuel in port, the inspector in question did not treat the violation as\na deficiency under the ISM code. However, the wording of the ISM code clearly requires\ncompliance with all mandatory rules and regulations (i.e. regional EU rules, as well as\nglobal IMO rules), and the ISM code is expressly designed to be a tool for the punish-\nment of poor ship management practices (such as the failure to provide the vessel with\ncompliant fuel). Drawing on his particular expertise, this Delphi Group member had\nbeen able to suggest a possible policy option which had not, thus far, occurred to the\ninterviewed inspectors, all of them members of a generic inspectorate grappling with the\nenforcement of a new regulatory regime. Such a development is, of course, a strength of\na multi-method research design: the additional data provided by the Delphi Group led to\na re-analysis and an extension of the findings.\nHowever, it remained unclear how this possible policy option was to be drafted. Port-\nState inspections, in common with much inspection practice in other jurisdictions, follow\na discretionary methodology, allowing surveyors latitude in the depth and foci of inspec-\ntions and in the actions required from non-compliant vessels. The relevant Paris MoU\ninstruction to surveyors states that the surveyor `should use professional judgement to\ndetermine whether to detain the ship or to allow it to sail with deficiencies which do not\npose an unreasonable threat of harm to the environment'(Paris MoU, 2010: 1). Therefore\nit would not be appropriate to have a study recommendation that Port State Control\nOfficers be instructed to treat a violation of the EU port regulations as a deficiency under\nthe ISM code. One possibility would have been to incorporate the panellist's suggestion\nwithin Recommendation 7 (`Port State Control Training'), but as the panellist had raised\nthe topic in response to Recommendation 2, it was felt more appropriate to report the\npossibility of treating the EU fuel violation as an ISM deficiency as part of\nRecommendation 2.\nDelphic suggestion of an additional policy\nrecommendation\nTwo of the four panellists independently suggested that the research report should rec-\nommend that substantial fines be levied on non-compliant ships. This issue was topical\nat the time of the operation of the Delphi Group because a draft European Commission\nDirective published at that time had stated the need for Member States to fine the opera-\ntors of non-compliant ships. In drafting the research report, the possibility of\nrecommending fines had been previously been considered, but rejected. Rejection was\nbased on the evidence collected in the course of the study on the Swedish experience of\nfining operators using non-compliant fuel. Sweden had been taking and testing fuel sam-\nples from around 200 quasi-randomly selected vessels per year, since 2006, but not a\nsingle vessel had been prosecuted between 2006 and 2010. This information had not\nbeen included in the draft report and was thus unavailable to the panellists.\nThe lead author, who conducted the Delphi Group, accordingly decided not to adopt\nthe fines suggestion in Round 2, but to state at length the reasons for not doing so. At the\nsame time, the offer was made to include a recommendation on fines in Round 3 if the\npanellists still felt this was necessary. Here is an abridged version of the moderator's\nRound 2 response:\nI should say that my colleagues on the project and I have considered the fines issue. And you\nare right of course that substantial fines do have a deterrent effect. However, I decided against\nincluding this in the recommendations because of the Swedish experience with prosecutions.\nAs you know, Sweden has been taking fuel samples as part of the enforcement of the fairway\ndues system [...] but from 2006 (the start of the Baltic ECA) until the end of 2010 there wasn't\na single prosecution [...] In each case, the [State] prosecutors decided that the higher standard\nof proof required for a successful court case had not been achieved (e.g. no proof that the\nsample tested in the laboratory was the same as that taken on the ship, no proof that the fuel\nsample had not been tampered with en route to the laboratory, etc.). I believe there could be a\nsimilar problem in the UK courts. [...] It's currently unclear how effective the US fines regime\nwill be, but we felt that in the context of the European courts the high standard of proof of non-\ncompliance that might be required could mean that relatively few cases would come to court.\nOur previous work in this research centre on Port-State Control indicated that the threat of\ndetention was the major deterrent for ship operators, because the publication of a detention on\nEquasis and other industry websites has a major impact on the vessel's future freight rates [...].\nSo the report focuses on making port-State enforcement more effective. That's why we're\nrecommending that breaches of EU port 0.1% fuel regulations be publicised on Equasis (they\naren't at the moment) and that departed vessels found on testing to have been burning non-\ncompliant fuel be inspected at the next port (they aren't at the moment).\nNevertheless, if the general feeling of the group is that we should include a recommendation on\nfines, then of course we'll do that.\nIn their responses to Round 2 of the Delphi Group, only one of the panellists returned to\nthe fines issue: he did not explicitly state that he wanted his initial suggestion on fines to\nstand. Instead, he thanked the lead author for taking his previous suggestion so seriously\nand for explaining why the recommendation had not been included in the earlier draft of\nthe report. He then copied a press report about a fine levied by an Italian court on the\noperator of a cruise ship for burning non-compliant fuel in port, while stating that `I have\nto admit, though, that this is one of the few examples I've seen'. This was taken to be\nconcurrent with the view taken in the report that few cases of non-compliance would\ncome to court and receive fines. The same panellist's response to the final Round 3\nincluded the statement: `Thanks for the new draft recommendations \u00ad they are all fine'.\nSo it would appear that this panellist at least had come round to the view that his initial\nsuggestion for a further recommendation on fines could now be disregarded.\nConclusion: Delphi Group strengths and limitations\nWe begin with two caveats. First, and self-evidently, a Delphi Group is not the only addi-\ntional qualitative method that can be introduced with advantage into a mixed method\ndesign: focus groups and semi-structured interviews are obvious alternatives. But an\nelectronic Delphi Group, allowing the remote polling of experts, does seem a particularly\nappropriate choice for a policy research project.\nA second caveat: this discussion is based on the experience of conducting one particu-\nlar Delphi Group exercise and it should be acknowledged that, with the benefit of hind-\nsight, that exercise could have been better conducted. In particular, it was a mistake not\nto explicitly request that the panellists communicate their agreement with the Round 3\nrecommendations. Although, as seen above, one panellist chose to reply endorsing the\nfinal recommendations, none of the others did so. The email accompanying Round 3 was\npoorly phrased and stated:\nI have only received one further set of comments on the suggested modifications in Round 2.\nThese comments, my response and the further suggested modifications are set out in the\nattachment. Please could I have your further suggestions by the end of Wednesday Sept 19th?\nIf I receive no further suggestions, then I will conclude the Delphi Group.\nIt is likely that the other panellists construed this email as taking the position that non-\nresponse would be taken as agreement and therefore, being in agreement, they felt no\nneed to respond. But of course non-response can also indicate drop-out \u00ad what has been\ntermed elsewhere `specious consensus' (Sackman, 1975). Good practice should require\nthat all participating panellists explicitly state their agreement before consensus is\nclaimed and the Delphi Group is concluded.\nHaving stated this caveat, it seems fitting to draw on the experience of this particular\nDelphi Group exercise to include some tentative, pragmatic suggestions on `dos and\ndon'ts' in Delphi Group conduct:\nSize: this Delphi Group exercise operated quite successfully with just four active par-\nticipants, but that is surely a minimum number. However, more important than size is\n`balance' \u00ad it was sheer luck that our four active participants represented a range of\nviewpoints, expertise and interests.\nRecruitment: given the onerous nature of the exercise, recruitment is most likely to\nbe successful among a population of research participants, who had previously shown\ncommitment to the study. However, in this instance seven research participants had\nformally agreed to serve as panellists, but in the event only four sent responses. It\nwould therefore seem prudent to recruit more panellists than are needed in order to\nallow for `no-shows'. Again, balance is critical.\nComposition: recruitment needs to be tailored to the specific task at hand, kindred to\npurposive sampling. A Delphi Group tasked to consider policy recommendations will\nneed to include some panellists with policy expertise. Balance is critical, but repre-\nsentativeness is not.\nModeration: the moderator's role extends beyond the facilitation of the timely com-\npletion of the Delphi Group and requires the exercise of discernment in responding\nto inputs from each round. Not all Delphi suggestions need to be incorporated in the\nfinal version of the recommendations. Where other data justify it, seemingly inappro-\npriate recommendations can be courteously contested.\nTiming: a virtual Delphi Group, operating by email, is the easiest commitment in the\nworld to extinguish, by the simple expedient of remaining silent. It is therefore im-\nportant that panellists realise that their commitment is not open-ended. This Delphi\nGroup was told that it would end after a month, regardless of whether or not the re-\npeated iterations had achieved consensus. The specific function of the Delphi Group,\nand the group's time-limited task, differentiate a Delphi Group from the expert Advi-\nsory Groups that often accompany large-scale research projects.\nClosure: profit by our mistake and ensure that, when sending out the final iteration\nyou ask all respondents to confirm their agreement, rather than give seeming assent\nthrough their silence.\nModesty: treat the Delphi Group simply as a useful additional data collection exercise\n(focusing on policy implications in this particular case). Panellists' agreement does\nnot equate to either public participation or member validation. Nevertheless, the very\nfact that the Delphi Group is a purposive sample, chosen for the range and depth of\ntheir expertise, ensures that the additional data they provide will have particular added\nvalue, especially where the researcher employs an analytic induction approach to the\nstudy of `deviant cases'.\nBeyond these `dos and don'ts', some general points can be made on the Delphi Group\nmethod. First, it is clear that Delphi Groups can bring certain advantages within a multi-\nmethod research design. As was illustrated by the panellist's suggestion on the use of\nIMO's International Ship Management Code to detain vessels with non-compliant fuel,\na Delphi Group, by being an additional vehicle for the presentation and collection of new\nevidence/data/arguments, can extend and deepen an analysis. The nature of the Delphi\nGroup method is such that the new evidence/data/argument that is generated is likely to\nbe particularly valuable, since it is likely to be in qualified opposition to early findings:\nthe analysis has to be inductively modified and extended (or corrected) to embrace these\nopposing additional data. The advantage being claimed here is analogous to that claimed\nby Irwin (1995) and others for the use of lay experts in an `extended peer review' of\nscientific findings. But this is an analogy only: we are not claiming here that Delphi\nGroups enhance public participation in sociological research. Delphi Groups are com-\nposed, after all, of experts not the laity, and other methods (most notably citizens' juries\n\u00ad Coote and Lenaghan, 1997; Dunkerley and Glasner, 1998) have been specially devel-\noped to involve the public in policy-making processes. Nor are we granting a privileged\nepistemological status to our expert panellists: the Delphi Group is simply acting as a\nspur to further inductive analysis.\nRelatedly, as was illustrated by the response to the panellists' suggestions about\nfines, the extension of the analysis that can occur as a result of exposure to opposing\nviewpoints need not necessarily involve the researcher in accepting antithetical argu-\nments and attempting to incorporate them into the research findings against his/her\nbetter judgement. The role of the moderator in the Delphi Group process allows for the\nreasoned exclusion of antithetical arguments, with the consent of the panellists. As the\nlate Gordon Horobin remarked, `Let a thousand flowers bloom, but don't ask me to\nwater them all'.\nFurther, the very act of compiling a set of policy recommendations for submission to a\nDelphi Group can itself act to sharpen up the presentation and accessibility of research\nfindings: the consciousness of the need to be understood by a non-sociological audience\ncan both act as a spur to clarity and as a censor of political quietism and excessive obscu-\nrantist self-reference. And, of course, the panellists in turn can make suggestions to further\nimprove presentation. A minor suggestion on presentation (the use of sub-headings for\neach separate recommendation) has already been illustrated. But additional and more sub-\nstantial suggestions were also made in respect of another recommendation (not reported\nhere) on sampling and testing fuel, which gave that recommendation more clarity.\nRelatedly again, Delphi Groups may be particularly useful when deliberating policy\nrecommendations simply because some of the panellists (at least) may be members of the\npolicy community and more expert in framing policy recommendations than researchers.\nWhile a Delphi Group may be composed with an eye to a number of different specific\nfunctions within a research design, a policy-orientated Delphi Group may be of particu-\nlar value.\nNevertheless, Delphi Groups can be, and have been, composed of members other than\npolicy experts and can deliberate on topics other than policy recommendations. For\nexample, service-users and service-providers have both been enrolled in past Delphi\nGroups. Technological advances have made light of the problem of remoteness, but the\nsome of the problems mentioned by past reviewers of Delphi Group studies remain, most\nnotably the problems of high panel attrition, and of poor specification of tasks by the\nmoderator where the focus of the Delphi Group is more diffuse than a stated set of policy\nrecommendations. The Delphi Group is not a tool suitable for all research occasions.\n"
