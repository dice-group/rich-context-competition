An important polymorphism in this gene\ncomprises the insertion (I) or deletion (D) of a 287-bp in\nintron 16 of the gene. Studies showed that the homozygous\nDD genotype is associated with increased serum ACE\nlevel9 and cardiac ACE activity.10\nIn view of its potential effect, we aimed in this study to\ndetermine the effect of ACE I/D gene polymorphism on the\nextent of functional and structural cardiac changes in\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme I/D\ngene polymorphism affects early cardiac\nresponse to professional training in\nyoung footballers\nMaha M Saber-Ayad1, Yasser S Nassar2 and Inas A Latif3\n Keywords\nACE I/D, gene polymorphism, exercise physiology, left ventricular mass, echocardiography\nPharmacology Department, Cairo University, University of Sharjah,\nCairo, Egypt\n2Critical Care Department, Cairo University, Egypt\n3Biochemistry Department, Cairo University, Egypt\nCorresponding author:\nMaha M Saber-Ayad, Pharmacology Department, Cairo University,\nEmail: msaber@sharjah.ac.ae; mahamms@gmx.net\nOriginal Article\nresponse to one year of professional football training in\nyoung Egyptian athletes.\nMethods\nSubjects\nFootball players trained for selection in the Egyptian Young\nWorld Cup National team were invited to join this study.\nDuring the follow-up year 68 out of 75 young athletes (par-\nmain training modality gave their written informed consent\nto take part in the study (according to the instructions and\nregulations of the Medical Ethics Committee in Cairo\nUniversity). The control group consisted of 100 age-, sex-,\nheight- and weight-matched, non-smoking, sedentary, third\nyear students studying at the medical school, Cairo\nUniversity. None of them exercised for more than 30 min-\nutes per week. After being given complete information\nabout the study, participants signed consent. All athletes\nand control subjects were asymptomatic Egyptians coming\nfor different parts of the country. They are free from cardiac\ndisease. None of them was known to be using anabolic ster-\noids or any other medications that may cause cardiac\nhypertrophy.\nStudy protocol\nThe study protocol was approved by the ethics Committee\nof Kasr El-Eini Medical School, Cairo University. The sub-\njects participated in 2D-echocardiographic and Doppler\nstudy at rest.\nEchocardiographic measurements\nEchocardiographic and Doppler studies were performed\nusinganEsaoteMyLab30Echomachine.Echocardiographic\nexamination was performed with the subject at rest, lying in\nleft lateral decubitus position. Both standard parasternal\nviews (long and short axis) and apical views (four-, two-\nand three-chamber) were obtained. An integrated M-mode\nand two-dimensional study was done, consistent with the\nrecommendations of the American Society of Echo\ncardiography11 and the European Association of Echo\ncardiography recommendations.12 The LV mass was\ncalculated using the formula of Devereux.13 LV wall ten-\nsion (WT) was calculated using the following formula:14\nWT (dyn/cm) = 1.33 \u00d7 systolic blood pressure \u00d7 (LV end\nsystolic diameter)/2. Measurements were quoted with body\nsurface area (BSA) calculated with the formula of Dubois\nand Dubois.15 Each measurement was made on three con-\nsecutive cardiac cycles and an average of the three values\nwas considered. The static and dynamic images were\nreviewed by another echocardiographer for the purpose of\nexcluding criteria for pathological hypertrophy in the ath-\nlete group.\nGenotyping of the ACE gene I/D\npolymorphism\nAfter obtaining informed consent for inclusion into the\nstudy from the parents, genomic DNA was extracted from\nextraction minipreps kit (Biobasic Company, Canada).\nThe I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene was determined\naccording to the method of Rigat et al.16 The sequences of\nthe sense and antisense primers were 5-CTG GAG ACC\nACA TTC GTC AGA T-3, respectively (prepared by\nAM-Egypt). PCR was performed in a final volume of 50\nl that contained 25 l master mix, 500 ng of genomic\nDNA, 12.5 pmol of each primer and 5% dimethylsulfox-\nide (DMSO). Amplification was performed using a Gene\nAmp PCR system 2400\u00adPerkin Elmer. Samples were\ndenatured for 1 min at 94\u00b0C and then cycled 30 times\n1 min at 72\u00b0C. PCR products were electrophoresed in\n1.6% agarose gel and visualized directly with ethidium\nbromide staining. The I allele was detected as a 490-bp\nband, and the D allele was detected as a 190-bp band\n(Figure 1). DMSO was included in the PCR to prevent\nunderestimation of heterozygotes and overestimation of\nthe DD genotype. A second PCR amplification was per-\nformed for each DD type with a primer pair that recog-\nnizes an insertion-specific sequence (5- TGG GAC CAC\nCCA TGC CCA TAA-3), with identical PCR conditions\nexcept for an annealing temperature of 67\u00b0C and the\nStatistical analysis\nThe allele distribution of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism\nwas tested for Hardy\u00adWeinberg equilibrium in footballer\nFigure 1.Angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion\ngenotyping (first PCR reaction).

After their recruitment, they were under a regular\ntraining program including both endurance and strength\ncomponents for 13 h/week (2 h static exercises + 11 h\ndynamic training/week).\nThe distribution of ACE gene I/D polymorphism in both\nfootballers and control groups is shown in Table 1. Different\ngenotypes as well as the distribution of either I or D alleles\nwere analyzed. There are no statistically significant differ-\nences between the two groups.\nTable 2 shows the clinical characteristics of the study\ngroup.

The footballer\ngroup showed significantly higher LV mass (p = 0.027) and\nejection fraction (EF) (p = 0.02).

Previous investigations showed\nvaried and sometimes paradoxical results regarding the\neffect of I/D gene polymorphism in response to physical\nThe ACE DD genotype is associated with increased cir-\nculating ACE levels, which are generally two times as high\nas those found for the II genotype; ID heterozygotes are\nassociated with intermediate ACE levels.9\nRegarding genotype frequency, both footballers and con-\ntrols showed similar distribution with ID genotype being the\nmost common (50% in footballers and 49% in controls), fol-\nlowed by DD genotype (38.2% and 39%) and II, which\nshowed the least frequency (11.8% and 12%). Our results\nare comparable to previous studies made in Egyptian popu-\nlations.20 Settin et al. showed different results (DD=47.5%,\nheterogeneity of the Egyptian population and the relatively\nsmall number of subjects in both investigations.\nIn contrast to our investigation, a number of studies\nshowed an association between ACE D allele and endur-\nance athletes in different populations.22,23\nThe distinction between physiological and pathological\nconditions in athlete's heart is of great importance, as the\nlatter may result in critical implications for the athlete's\nlifestyle and professional career.\nIn our study, we paid particular attention to the previ-\nously described criteria differentiating athlete's heart from\nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).24,25 Family history\nwas explored. All echocardiographic images included in\nthe study were independently interpreted by two echocardi-\nographers to obtain the measurements; criteria of HCM\nwere cautiously sought for in all cases, in particular poste-\nrior and septal wall thickness. Elite junior athletes have\ngreater absolute LV wall thickness, rarely exceeding 12mm,\nand always with chamber enlargement.26\nLV mass is significantly higher in athletes compared\nwith that of control subjects. As a combined endurance and\nstrength training, football training usually exposes the ath-\nlete to a high pressure load that leads to a marked increase\nin LV wall thickness and dimensions (both end systolic and\nend diastolic).27 Further follow-up of our study population\nwill help highlight stepwise adaptive changes that sequen-\ntially occur with continuing professional training.\nSupportive of our results, previous studies showed sig-\nnificant increase in LV wall thickness, diameter and mass in\nathletes compared with controls in both Caucasians28 and\nThe effect of ACE I/D gene polymorphism on LV\nmass in our study is obvious; there is a summative effect\nof the presence of D allele, with DD genotype carriers\nshowing the highest LV mass, II showing the least and ID\nshowing an intermediate value. Previous studies showed\nsimilar results in response to 10-week physical training in\nmale Caucasians19,30 as well as in strength-trained elite\nIt should be noted that such effect is a dynamic rather\nthan a static one. In concordance with our results, some\nstudies showed the effect of this gene polymorphism on the\nLV mass in response to exercise,19 whereas others negated\nthe association of ACE I/D gene polymorphism and LV\nmass in more than 2000 subjects from the Framingham\nHeart Study of non-athletes.18\nWT reflects the effect of the preload on the myocardium.\nIn our study the WT was significantly lower in athletes as\ncompared with controls, whereas a significant increase in\nEF in the former was noticed. Calculation of both parame-\nters depends on the end systolic diameter. Our results are\nsupported by previous studies investigated Caucasian\nOur study showed significant difference in both WT and\nEF among the three genotypes, with cumulative effect of D\nallele. Increased angiotensin II (Ang II) may lead to stiff-\nness of the cardiac muscle with resultant increase in WT.\nSupporting our results, previous studies showed that ACE\nDD and AT1R 1166 CC genotypes, concomitantly present,\nincrease the predisposition to diastolic heart failure.32\nFew studies investigated the early adaptive right-sided\nchanges occurring in athlete's heart, especially in the\nyoung. Our results showed a significant increase in PASP in\nathletes in comparison with control subjects. In addition, a\nsignificant increase in RV diameter followed.\nHigh levels of physical activity in adults are associated\nwith greater RV mass and volume independent of the asso-\nciations with LV mass due to exercise-associated RV\nMcQuillan et al. observed a wide spectrum of PASP in\nnormal subjects. They concluded that PASP varies indepen-\ndently with age, BMI, male sex, LV posterior wall thick-\nness and LV ejection fraction.34\nA recent study has shown that endurance-trained ath-\nletes have a significantly higher PASP in comparison with\nstrength-trained athletes and control subjects.35 The study\nconcluded that the upper physiologic limit of PASP in\nendurance athletes may reach up to 40mmHg. Although\nthis study was evaluating highly trained athletes, it can give\nan explanation to our unexpected results of elevated PASP.\nIn our study, footballers with DD genotype showed an\nincrease in both LV mass and PASP. These findings can be\nconsidered a physiologic consequence of long-term and\nintensive exercise conditioning. The reduced peripheral\nresistance that accompanies isotonic aerobic sports can\ndetermine venous overload and consequent LV preload,\nthus inducing greater LVEDD and LV stroke volume.36\nTherefore, the higher PASP we noticed in this study may\nbe explained by the proportional increase in LV stroke\nvolume.\nIn our study, ACE gene polymorphism showed an effect\non both sides of the heart. The effect was significant on the\nstructure and function of the right side. DD genotype\nshowed a significantly higher PASP and RV diameter com-\npared with ID and II genotypes.\nIn concordance with our results, Kanazawa et al. showed\nan association of ACE gene polymorphism with an increase\nin mean pulmonary artery pressure as well as pulmonary\nvascular resistance in response to exercise in chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease.37 Similar results were\nreported by Tk\u00e1cov\u00e1 et al.38\nThe lungs are metabolically active organs that produceAng\nII and endothelin among other peptides.39 Pulmonary vascular\ntone is under the control of both vaso-active peptides.\nIn addition to its vaso-active property, Ang II also\ninduces proliferation and inflammation of the pulmonary\nvasculature that contributes to the rise of pulmonary artery\npressure in both primary and secondary pulmonary hyper-\ntension (e.g. in patients with chronic obstructive airway\ndisease).40,41 Recently, ACE2 enzyme was shown to be\na negative regulator of the angiotensin system (counter-\nregulatory homolog of ACE). It metabolizes Ang II to a\nputative protective peptide angiotensin (1-7) and leads to\nvasodilatation and anti-proliferative effect.39 Therefore, it\nis expected to be of therapeutic benefit in treating pulmo-\nnary hypertension.40\nThe results of our study support the direct relationship\nbetween the higher levels of ACE (and subsequently Ang\nII) and the PASP, which showed a gradual rise according to\nthe number of D alleles.\nIn a recent study by Ventetuolo et al., the researchers\nshowed that RAS manipulation by using ACE inhibitors or\nangiotensin receptor blockers was associated with lower RV\nmass and smaller RV volumes among African Americans,\neven after adjustment for respective LV measures and\nspirometry. This gives indirect evidence that RAS manipu-\nlation may uniquely affect RV morphology independent of\nits effect on the LV.41 Further studies should investigate the\nassumption that Ang II affects the pulmonary vasculature\nearlier and more significantly than it does the systemic.\nThe balance between Ang II and Ang 1-7 seems to be\ndisturbed in individuals with DD genotype in favor of Ang\nII. The D allele may be in linkage disequilibrium with\nanother causative variant in ACE2 gene that decreases the\nenzyme level or activity, and suppresses the production of\nAng 1-7 in the lungs. Further studies are required to eluci-\ndate the role of this gene as a potential factor in determining\nvascular resistance.\nIn addition, the preferential effect of Ang II/ACE2 on\nthe right side of the heart may be related to the higher enzy-\nmatic activity of the pulmonary circulation as compared\nwith the systemic.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that\ninvestigated the role of ACE I/D gene polymorphism in an\nAfrican population, concerning early cardiac response to\nprofessional training. Follow-up of our study population\nmay throw light on the significance and explanation of the\nstudy results.\nLimitations\nWe conducted the study on a relatively small number of\nathletes and controls. We did not use relatively recent tech-\nniques (tissue Doppler, 3D echocardiography and magnetic\nresonance). We did not measure the volume or the function\nof the right ventricle. Investigating the genes of the renin\u00ad\nangiotensin\u00adaldosterone system included only ACE I/D\npolymorphism.\n"
