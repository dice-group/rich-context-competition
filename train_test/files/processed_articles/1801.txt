Still, France is known for its copious year-round\noutdoor markets that sell fresh local products, especially\nfruits and vegetables (Volatier and Verger, 1999).\nconducted by l'Association Sucre et Produits Sucre\n\u00b4s Consom-\nmation et Communication, revealed that fruit and vegetable\nintake was low, especially with regard to young people, labor\nworkers and individuals residing in northern parts of the\ncountry (Volatier and Verger, 1999). In an effort to combat this\ngrowing problem, l'Institut National de Pre\n\u00b4vention et d'E\n\u00b4duca-\ntion pour la Sante\n\u00b4 (INPES) and le Ministe\n`re de la Sante\n\u00b4 created\na campaign called Programme National Nutrition Sante\n\u00b4\n(PNNS). PNNS' mission is to help improve the overall health\nof the French population by stressing energy balance, while\nplacing particular focus on enhanced dietary habits to include\nmore fruits and vegetables and less fat and alcohol (Le\nProgramme National Nutrition Sante\nmends that the French eat at least five fruits and vegetables\neach day (Le Programme National Nutrition Sante\nThese recommendations have become critically imperative at a\ntime when, according to l'Institut National de la Sante\n\u00b4 et de la\nRecherche Me\n\u00b4dicale, one out of 10 children will be obese by\nthe age of 10 years.

For the United States, we used\nmonths to 85 \u00fe years (National Center for Health Statistics,\nreports that evaluates the health and dietary status of adults\nand children across the United States. This nationally\nrepresentative survey includes both in-person and telephone\ninterviews, as well as physical examinations. The diet intake\ninterview portion includes 24-h diet recalls and a food\nfrequency questionnaire.\nL'Institut National de Prevention et d'E\n\u00b4ducation pour la Sante\n\u00b4:\nNutrition Barometer Survey\nFor France, we used the 2002 Nutrition Barometer Survey\n(NBS), conducted by INPES, which comprised 3153 indivi-\nin 1996, this questionnaire examines change and progres-\nsion in behaviors, knowledge and attitudes with regard to\nfood in the French population. NBS is a nationally\nrepresentative telephone survey and includes a single 24-h\ndiet recall, a dietary history, a food frequency questionnaire\nand a 2-week food recall.\nComparable coding\nWhile there were 5575 distinct food choices available for\nthe NHANES instrument, only 635 individual food choices\nwere available for the NBS survey. Unlike NHANES, NBS\ndoes not query specific details of each food eaten or serving\nsizes. Instead, participants were asked to choose from a list of\nfoods provided by the interviewer. The NHANES 24-h recall\nelicited participant responses for all foods eaten along with\nserving sizes, thus allowing for a much larger list of food\ncodes.\nFood codes of explicit interest were identified on both\nsurveys, while primarily focusing on fruits and vegetables,\nand omitting most foods and mixtures deemed not princi-\npally fruit- or vegetable based. It must also be noted that\nvegetable sources with poor nutritional value such as French\nfries were excluded from both surveys. Accordingly, 322\nNHANES food codes were labeled as fruits and 842 food\ncodes were coded as vegetables; 47 NBS food codes were\nlabeled as fruits and 71 food codes were coded as vegetables.\nStudy population and variables\nWe restricted our analysis to respondents aged 20\u00ad74 years\nfor both surveys because we wanted to look at variables such\nas educational attainment and marital status. For the United\nStates, height and weight were measured by the interviewers,\nUS and France fruit and vegetable consumption patterns\nSL Tamers et al\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nwhereas the French survey relied on self-report. Height\nand weight were used to determine BMI, defined as\n(weight in kilograms)/(height in meters)2. Additional\nvariables of interest were gender, age and `day of\nintake'. Final study population resulted in 2126 women\nfor NBS.\nConsumption frequency\nFor this study, we included a single 24-h diet recall for\nboth NHANES and NBS. To obtain fruit and vegetable\nconsumption frequencies, we computed the number of\ntimes an individual mentioned consuming a food, summing\nup 24-h diet recall mentions of these foods for each person to\nachieve estimated daily frequencies of fruit and vegetable\nconsumption.\nOne of the authors (TA-C), a registered dietitian, further\ncollapsed the collections of selected NHANES and NBS fruit\nand vegetable food codes into smaller groups that cogni-\ntively corresponded to particular fruit and vegetable items;\nfor instance, `potato salad' became `potato'.\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analysis required the use of the software package\nSUDAAN (version 9.1) to properly account for the complex\nsampling designs used for both NHANES and NBS. Both\nsurveys were treated as stratified cluster samples. NHANES\nprovided stratum and cluster identification, whereas NBS did\nnot. Thus, it was assumed that the entire NBS sample was\nderived from a single stratum; hence, each individual in NBS\nwas treated as a separate cluster. Both surveys provided\npoststratification weights to ensure that the samples repre-\nsented the populations from which they were drawn. Due to\ndifferences in the weighting schemes, and because the two\ninstruments were carried out independently, each survey was\nanalyzed separately.\nWe analyzed mean daily consumption frequency in each\nsurvey for fruits, vegetables and their sum (overall, and by\ngender). We used two-sample t-tests to determine whether\nthe mean frequencies differed between subgroups in\nthe same populations and also to test for differences between\nthe two countries.\nWe then examined the estimated distribution of cate-\ngorized demographic and other study variables in the two\ncountries. Since there is evidence that individuals consume\ndifferently on weekends than on weekdays (Baranowski\nof `day of intake' in subsequent analyses.\nLinear regression models were used to determine if\nobserved variations in the distribution of demographic\ncovariates (that is, age, marital status and education)\nexplained part of the noted differences in fruit and/or\nvegetable consumption frequency, while controlling for\n`day of intake' (weekend/weekday) and BMI (o25, normal\nregression models were run for fruit and vegetable consump-\ntion frequency as well as the sum.\nFor each fitted model, an adjusted mean frequency of\nconsumption was estimated using the method of predictive\nmargins (Korn and Graubard, 1999) that was obtained\nby directly standardizing the predictive means from the\nregression model to the estimated joint distribution of\ncovariates in the analysis.\nResults\nDemographic and other variables in the target populations\nwere comparable, as shown in Table 1. The proportion of\nwomen is approximately 50% for both countries and\nThe distribution of BMI in the two countries is strikingly\ndifferent with 30.92% of the United States with a\npopulation. Although the French have lower mean BMI\nthan the US population, the education distribution is\nreversed; 56.87% of the US population has an education\nabove high school, which is roughly the same percentage of\nthe French population with an education below high school.\nFinally, while not a demographic variable per se, it must be\nnoted that nearly 65% of NHANES participants' 24-h diet\nrecall fell on a weekend (Friday, Saturday or Sunday); a\nmore even split between weekend and weekday was observed\nin NBS.\nWe identified significant differences in consumption\nfrequency for fruits, vegetables and their combination across\npopulations and genders. Table 2 illustrates that French\nwomen consumed the most fruits and vegetables (1.41 times\nper day fruits; 2.41 times per day vegetables), followed by\nvegetables) and American women (1.10 times per day fruits;\n2.07 times per day vegetables), whereas American men\nper day vegetables).\nWhen examining fruit intake solely (data not shown),\nnumber of mentions increased with age in both the US and\nFrench populations and between both the genders. BMI was\na predictor for the US population (Po0.01) only, while\neducation was highly significant for all four combinations,\nwith number of mentions rising with level of education.\nNumber of vegetable mentions also increased with age in US\nwomen and among the French (data not shown). BMI was a\npredictor for US women (Po0.05), and education was highly\nsignificant for US women and men.\nFinally, the predictive marginal for overall fruit and\nvegetable consumption (Table 3) increased with age in both\nthe US and French populations and between both genders.\nBMI was highly significant for US women (Po0.01),\nsignificant for French women and US men (Po0.05) and\nnot significant for French men. Marital status had a\nUS and France fruit and vegetable consumption patterns\nSL Tamers et al\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nsignificant effect for US women and men, and education was\nsignificant for all four combinations. Lastly, `day of intake'\nwas not significant except for French men.\nIn general, when controlling for covariates and demo-\ngraphic subgroups, the predictive marginal of fruit\nfrequency, vegetable frequency and the sum of both, shows\nsignificant differences between the United States and France,\nwith the French having significantly higher consumption\nfrequencies (Po0.05). Exceptions include women and men\nmen in the divorced/widowed cluster and both genders in\nthe above high school level of education group.\nDiscussion\nNumerous studies have examined dietary patterns in the\nUnited States and France separately (Volatier and Verger,\n2004). However, not only have few studies endeavored to\ncompare nutrition-related factors between these two specific\nalso, to our knowledge, none has focused exclusively on fruit\nand vegetable consumption. Consequently, little is known\nabout both common and distinct factors that influence\nintake in these two populations.\nOur results show a negative association between fruit and\nvegetable intake and BMI. There is an unmistakable\nTable 1 Sample characteristics by country\nn % s.e. n % s.e.\nGender\nAge (years)\nBody Mass Index\nMarital status\nEducation\nDay of intake\nAbbreviations: NBS, Nutrition Barometer Survey; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\n*P-value for t-test of difference between the United States and France.\nTable 2 Average consumption frequency of fruits and vegetables by\ncountry and gender\nUnited States\nFrance\nP*\nMean s.e.

Frequency of consumption among the French\nseems to be affected by the same factors that impact\nAmerican consumption frequency. Unsurprisingly, stark\ndisparities in intake by gender can be observed in both\ncountries.\nEducation, arguably a proxy for income/socioeconomic\nstatus, has been shown to be one of the strongest influences\non fruit and vegetable intake in the United States (Adler and\n2006). In France, we found this relationship holds true to a\nlesser degree. In effect, some purport that one of the most\npressing and shaping determinants of dietary habits is, in\nIn France, as in many other nations, food practices are seen\nas an important distinctive aspect between diverse popula-\ntions and are heavily molded by cultural and societal\ninfluences, which help set apart different groups (Ghadirian\ndifferences, environment and lifestyle variances often\nimpact nutrition patterns. This might occur more so in\nFrance, where food appears to be so readily ingrained\nin the population's cultural values, identification and pride\ncitizens may place more emphasis on the experience of\neating (variety, moderation and quality vs quantity), and a\nhigher priority on food-related ecological factors such as\nwhat they eat, how much they eat and how much time they\nspend eating, than their US counterparts (Rozin et al., 2003;\nRozin, 2005). The extent to which these cultural and\nenvironmental imprints are so in either country remains to\nbe seen, as relatively few epidemiologic studies have yet\nto characterize, measure and analyze such issues, owing to a\nlack of defined metrics to truly measure culture. It is our\ncontention that until such metrics are identified, we have, at\nbest, an incomplete picture of what influences fruit and\nvegetable consumption in the United States and France.\nBased on our findings, the consumption frequency of\nfruits and vegetables of the least formally educated group in\nFrance is comparable to even the most formally educated\ngroup in the United States. This detail, coupled with the\ndifferences in education distribution observed, might lead\none to think that if a more equivalent division were noted,\nand if education were as much of a driving force in France as\nit appears to be in the United States, overall differences in\nintake might be even greater.\nAmong study limitations, NBS only permitted us to\nexamine mentions of fruits and vegetables rather than\nportion sizes for foods consumed. Although this method is\nnot ideal, using the frequencies allowed for a general\ncomparison between the two countries. The NHANES 24-h\nTable 3 Predictive marginal of fruit and vegetable consumption by gender and country\nFemale Male\nUnited States\nFrance\nP* United States\nFrance\nP\nMean s.e. Mean s.e. Mean s.e.

Since the US survey had more food codes, it should\nhave favored higher fruit and vegetable frequencies when\ncompared to France; however, since the opposite was noted,\nwe believe this methodological bias did not affect our results.\nAnother limitation is the cross-sectional design used for both\nsurveys and the utilization of one 24-h diet recall for\ncomparison. As a result of this, only a single snapshot in\ntime comparing fruit and vegetable frequency for each\ncountry is provided.\nIn addition, a misclassification for overweight and obesity\nmay exist due to differing methods used to assess height and\nweight. For the United States, height and weight were\nmeasured directly by the interviewer, whereas the French\nsurvey relied solely on self-report. Still, measured and self-\nreported weights and heights have strong correlations\nto be reliable with younger adults (Kuczmarski et al., 2001),\nand is a valid measure in epidemiological studies (McAdams\net al., 2007). Since a substantial difference was discerned in\nthat roughly 31% of the US NHANES sample was found to be\nobese compared to only 8% of the NBS French participants,\nwe believe that the discrepancy is unlikely due to reporting\ndifferences.\nAs previously noted, the method in which both surveys\nwas carried out differs. NBS was a telephone survey, while\nNHANES used a face-to-face interview approach. It is possible\nthat characteristics of individuals with telephones might\nbe dissimilar in France compared to the United States.\nNonetheless, we believe there are very little variations\nbetween the two populations in this respect since 95% of\nFrench households subscribe to a fixed telephone line\n(Moreau et al., 2004), which is similar to the United States\nAnother limitation is that a large majority of the NHANES\n24-h recalls was conducted on a weekend, whereas a more\neven split between weekday and weekend was observed for\nthe NBS interviewees. This could have potentially introduced\na comparability issue in that a fair representation of fruit\nand vegetable intake between all days of the week was not\nachieved. In order to minimize this concern, we controlled\nfor `day-of-the-week'.\nIt is also true that fruit and vegetable consumption\npatterns may vary according to season; thus, the effect of\nseasonality would be important to explore. Unfortunately,\nthough the NHANES survey is carried out over the course of\nan entire year (and so the 24-h noted are approximately\nequally distributed along the year) we do not have access to\ngeographic locations by calendar time. Likewise, we do not\nhave seasonality information for the NBS, as the survey is\nonly carried out from early February to late March.\nFinally, we were unable to examine disparities in income\ndue to a lack of comparability between the two countries.\nNevertheless, we feel this study may be an important first\nstep in determining some of the influential factors that may\naffect various populations' fruit and vegetable consumption\nfrequency.\nIn summary, while both groups fall short of their\nrespective country's minimum fruit and vegetable recom-\nmendations, we find that the French consume fruits and\nvegetables more frequently than their US counterparts, even\nwhen demographic and BMI differences are taken into\naccount. Our findings underscore the need for additional\nresearch to verify these results and to investigate those\ncountry-specific underpinnings that could serve to better\nunderstand the disparities found. A variety of factors such as\nculture, public health campaigns and initiatives and other\nrelevant lifestyle factors not considered in this study could\nprovide further insight. In turn, this knowledge may be\nhelpful in promoting long-term behavior change through\nincreased fruit and vegetable intake among populations.\n"
