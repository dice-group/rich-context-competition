    "abstract": "Abstract\nEarlier work has tended to overlook the formative origins of child care policy in liberal democracies. Accordingly, this\nstudy examines mandate-seeking and parties' envisioning of child care with reference to issue salience and policy framing in\nparty manifestos in U.K. Westminster and regional elections. It reveals a significant increase in issue salience following its\nemergence as a manifesto issue in the 1980s, thereby confirming it as part of the wider rise of \"valence politics.\" The framing\ndata reveal that a \"post-feminist\" discourse of \"social investment\" has generally displaced the political framing of child care as\na gender equality issue. It is argued that this is inherently problematic and reflects parties' failure to address ongoing gender\ninequality in the labor market. Notably, the data also illustrate the way devolution is leading to the territorialization of child\ncare in the United Kingdom--no longer solely mandated in Westminster elections, policy is now contingent on the discursive\npractices of regional party politics and shaped by local socio-economic factors.\n",

As a policy issue, it spans a number of\nkey issues and debates including gender equality, the domes-\ntic division of labor, appropriate development and support\nfor children, the contemporary role of the welfare state, the\nform and functioning of the labor market, and the wider\nhealth of the economy (cf. Saraceno, 2011). Although lead-\ning studies have charted the changing political context shap-\ning child care policy development in the United Kingdom\nover recent years (Harker, 2006), the present study makes an\noriginal contribution by analyzing electoral discourse and\nthe level of attention (\"issue salience\") and use of language\n(\"policy framing\") in relation to child care in party manifes-\ntos for Westminster and \"regional\" elections.1\nIt is a transferable method suited to future comparative\nstudy of social policy developments in (quasi-)federal welfare\nregimes. Accordingly, the discourse-based process of mandate\nseeking in election programs matters to the development of\nchild care, because it constitutes the link between the repre-\nsentative process and policy development in liberal democ-\nracies. In this, manifestos serve multitude of functions: (a)\nThey provide substantive details of future government (and\nopposition) parties' policies, (b) they show how parties com-\npare in the priority they attach to child care, (c) electoral dis-\ncourse reveals areas of inter-party conflict and consensus,\nand (d) such a focus provides insights into how policy is\nshaped by party ideology and contingent on local socio-\neconomic and political factors. In this regard, it reveals the\npolitical use of language and discourse-based processes that\nunderpin the development of public policy on child care,\nthereby providing a \"discursive benchmark\" to complement\nex post analyses of policy delivery (Basl\u00e9, 2006; Meyers,\nGlaser, & Donald, 1998). In short, it is a focus that engages\nwith Sumsion and Press's (2007) prescient call\nto open up to analysis and debate the role of politics and policy\nin framing community perceptions of childcare . . .

(p. 96)\nThe current focus acknowledges the role of electoral dis-\ncourse as an important indicator of political agenda setting\n(Cobb & Ross, 1997). Moreover, as Rigby, Tarrant, and\nNeuman (2007) cogently observe, attention to discourse and\npolicy design recognizes the way that both \"institutionalize\nand legitimize particular forms of governmental involvement\nin children's lives--as well as give power and voice to some\ninterests over others--resulting in a new political context for\nfuture policy debates\" (p. 98). Such an approach also pro-\nvides insights into parties' attempts to appeal to particular\naudiences at the time of elections. In turn, this shapes wider\nvoting patterns and determines which policies are endorsed\nby the electorate.\nThe latter is explained by mandate and accountability\n1996). The former asserts that when in government, parties\nshould implement the policies that they pledged when run-\nning for office. In contrast, accountability theory asserts that\nelections are effectively \"opinion polls\" on the performance\nof the party (or parties) forming the previous administra-\ntion--and whether they delivered their manifesto policy pro-\ngram (Przeworski, Stokes, & Manin, 1999).\nTwo non-discrete contemporary factors underline the\nimportance of the foregoing theoretical underpinnings: devo-\nlution and the rise of coalition government. In the former\ncase, study of child care politics needs to be cognizant of the\ndiscursive underpinnings of distinctive territorial approaches.\nThis links to earlier pioneering study (Randall, 2000) that\nunderlined the limits for child care policy convergence\nbetween (welfare) states in multi-level systems--as well as\nscholarship on how (quasi-)federal state architecture affects\nthe design of welfare (Mahon & Brennan, 2013). Here, we\ncomplement this work by examining the impact of the plural-\nizing of electoral systems that accompanies state decentral-\nization--such that single statewide ballots are supplemented\nby regional elections. With regard to the second factor,\nwhereas the current Westminster coalition government is\nsomething of a rarity at a U.K. level, multi-party executives\nhave become a routine aspect of devolved government in the\nUnited Kingdom. Electoral discourse thus plays a key role in\nconstructing coalition agendas for government as the respec-\ntive partners seek to integrate party-specific election pledges\non child care into a single executive policy program (cf.\nIn summary, the following discussion explores the con-\ntemporary development of child care policy by (a) exploring\nchanges in the issue salience of child care since its emer-\ngence in the 1980s, (b) examining policy framing in mani-\nfesto discourse, and (c) analyzing the impact of state\ndecentralization. Accordingly, the remainder of the article is\nstructured thus: A discussion of the literature on the child\ncare policy and electoral competition is followed by an out-\nline of the research context and methodology. The findings in\nrelation to the study aims are then presented in two principal\nsections: statewide and regional elections. In the latter case,\nthe discussion is sub-divided, the first section of which deals\nwith inter-polity contrasts in issue salience and framing, and\nthe second with inter-party contrasts in issue salience and\nframing. The main findings and their implications are dis-\ncussed in the conclusion.\nElectoral Politics and the Formative\nPhase of Child Care Policy Making\nOver several decades, child care provision, including paid\nparental leave, has been an increasingly common feature of\nsocial policy in many European countries and beyond\n(Melhuish & Petrogiannis, 2006). In contrast, in the United\nKingdom, child care policies have only developed since the\nlate 1990s. Hitherto, provision was left to voluntary groups\nor the market; statutory maternity leave was limited and state\ninvolvement centered on vulnerable children and those in\nresidential care. However, structural pressure on the \"male\nbreadwinner model\" on which the welfare state was pre-\nmised--not least by the increasing prevalence of dual-earner\nhouseholds--has, albeit belatedly, prompted government\nintervention (Land, 1999). This has also been driven by EU\npolicy, notably the goal that by 2010, women's participation\nin the labor market should have reached 60%, and that child\ncare services should be available to at least a third of children\nbelow 3 years of age and 90% of children aged between 3\nand school-entry age (cf. Plantenga, Remmery, Seigel, &\nSementini, 2008). Although existing accounts chart recent\ndevelopments in government policy on child care (cf. Rahilly\n2007), limited attention has been given to the formative\nphase of policy making and its electoral underpinnings.\nWhen attention has focused on child care policy it has\nlargely examined party divisions on child care (Leitner,\n2010), internal party debates on the funding of child care\nprogrammes (Brennan, 1998), addressing opposition to par-\nties' child care policy (Eisenstein, 1981), the interplay\nbetween structural and ideational factors in establishing\nparty platforms (Sorensen, 2011), and sex discrimination and\nsetting party election programmes (Howell, 2006). Little\nattention has been given to the longitudinal study of electoral\ndiscourse and the prioritization and framing of policy pro-\nposals on child care.\nAccordingly, to address this lacuna, the following draws\non the electoral theory of \"issue salience\" (RePass, 1971;\nRobertson, 1976). This is a conceptualization whereby piv-\notal importance lies not on party issue positions but on the\nprominence and attention afforded to different issues in their\ncampaigns; ergo the more an issue is emphasized by a party\n(making it \"salient\"), the greater the likelihood it will attract\nvoters who share similar concerns. Traditionally, quantitative\nanalysis has been used to explore this (Libbrecht, Maddens,\nination takes a more holistic approach by combining this\nwith an exploration of policy framing. Frames here are \"a\nnecessary property of a text--where text is broadly con-\nceived to include discourses, patterned behaviour, and sys-\ntems of meaning, policy logics, constitutional principles, and\ndeep cultural narratives\" (Creed, Langstraat, & Scully, 2002,\nIn electoral theory, child care is a valence issue (Stokes,\n1992). In other words, it is a topic that generally unites voters\n(given its wider social benefits, few would argue against the\nregulated provision of child care). However, it is also a \"posi-\ntion issue,\" meaning that parties differ in their views on what\npublic policy should--and should not--aim to achieve, not\nleast in relation to the amount of resources and support\nextended by government. Inter alia, parties'contrasting issue\npositions reflect their ideological standpoint on the appropri-\nate balance between the market and state (Barnett & Barnett,\n1997). Traditionally, those on the Right have embraced neo-\nliberal, market-based solutions and eschewed state interven-\ntion; whereas those of the Left have advocated the harnessing\nof state power to promote social welfare (Navarro, 1998). In\nreality, party positions are rarely as polarized as this sug-\ngests, as evidenced by the literature on welfare pluralism\n(Beresford & Croft, 1983). Underlining the latter point, over\nthe past two decades, U.K. politics has been marked by the\nrise of valence politics, as the main parties have converged\ntoward the political center ground (Bara & Budge, 2001;\nBromley & Curtice, 2002). The present findings showing the\nsteep rise in issue salience over the past three-and-a-half\ndecades are significant because they confirm child care's role\nin the rise of valence politics.\nIn turn, this increase in salience is a function of the\nincreasing party politicization of child care. This refers to\nhow issues rise and fall on the political agenda, as parties\ncompete for votes on a given issue (Carter, 2006). It is allied\nto the concept of \"issue ownership\" (Petrocik, 1996)--\nwhereby parties prioritize certain policy issues, emphasize\nearlier policy successes, and attempt to highlight party com-\npetence on a given topic while dismissing rivals' records.\nThe underlying motive is to be seen as the \"owners\" of an\nissue--thereby securing electoral and reputational\nadvantage.\nBy focusing on statewide and regional elections,2 this\nstudy provides a transferable methodology that gives further\ninsights into the impact of multi-level governance on child\ncare policy making. This approach is appropriate, because\n\"devolution\"--or move to quasi-federalism in the United\nKingdom (Gamble, 2006)--is part of the wider international\ntrend of state restructuring (Doornbos, 2006). Under the\nrevised governance structures, the Scottish, Welsh, and\nNorthern Irish governments have responsibility for many\naspects of state child care policy in their territories3 (for a\ndiscussion of the policy responsibilities of the devolved leg-\nislatures and governments, see, for example, Birrell, 2008).\nMethod\nBy applying mixed research methods, the current study\nresponds to earlier calls for policy work to combine content\nand critical discourse analysis (Baker et al., 2008).\nAccordingly, issue salience is determined by content analysis\nof manifestos. This is applied by recording the number of\nincidences of key words, ideas, or meanings in party pro-\ngrams (Krippendorff & Bock, 2008) and is complemented by\nframe analysis (Sch\u00f6n & Rein, 1994). The latter is concerned\nwith how, as key political texts, manifestos enable parties to\nconstruct (or \"frame\") policy proposals on child care and\nother matters. In electoral terms, as Nelson and Oxleya\n(1997) observe, \"frames influence opinions by stressing spe-\ncific values, facts and other considerations, endowing them\nwith greater apparent relevance to the issue than they might\nappear to have under an alternative frame\" (p. 75). In this\nway, framing leads to political agenda setting (Cobb & Ross,\nthat are mandated.\nComparative analysis of framing practices in different\npolities and tiers of government is a long-established meth-\nodological practice (De Vreese, Peter, & Semetko, 2001;\nPapacharissi, 2008).4 However, it is acknowledged that man-\nifestos have limitations as a data source, not least because\nparty policy proposals are also set out in debates, speeches,\nand other documents; yet, they constitute the principal politi-\ncal texts that reflect a party's priorities and issue positions,\nthereby allowing systematic analysis over time. Accordingly,\nas noted, electronic versions of the manifestos of the leading5\nsoftware.6\nThus, in the preliminary stage of the research, the mani-\nfesto texts were divided into \"quasi-sentences\" (or \"an argu-\nment which is the verbal expression of one political idea or\ntrolled for long sentences that contain several policy propos-\nals. Individual quasi-sentences were subsequently coded\nusing a deductive coding frame (Joffe & Yardley, 2003)\nbased on key topics and themes derived from the academic\nliterature on the child care policy (see Figure 4). Thus, this\nschema incorporates a range of frames including mixed\neconomy provision, work/life balance, encouraging work-\nplace provision, regulation/child care staff training, and gen-\nder equality. Divergent views on the coding emerged in less\nthan 2% of quasi-sentences (N = 7388; resolved by discus-\nsion between coders). Issue salience was then determined by\nlogging the frequency of quasi-sentences in a database of\nparty manifestos.\n4 SAGE Open\nFigure 1. The issue salience of child care policy in the three main parties' general election manifestos 1983-2010: All-party absolute\ntotals of quasi-sentences in each election (N = 210).\nAs existing electoral studies reveal, over recent years,\nparty programs have tended to become more detailed and\nhave a greater word length. This has potential methodologi-\ncal implications for any claims of shifting salience over\ntime, not least because any change might be regarded as a\npossible function of increased manifesto length rather than\ngreater attention to child care policy by the respective par-\nties. To control for this, the present analysis uses both \"abso-\nlute\" and \"relative totals\" methodologies. The former details\nthe total number of quasi-sentences on child care; whereas\nthe latter re-calculates them as a percentage of all quasi-\nsentences in each manifesto9 (i.e., quasi-sentences on all\ntopics and issues; see Figure 2 below). Because the impact\nof increased manifesto word length on saliency is complex\nand variable,10 both approaches have advantages and short-\ncomings. Moreover, notwithstanding the overall trend\ntoward greater manifesto length, there are major fluctua-\ntions in both manifesto word totals and the number of quasi-\nsentences (for example, in two of the seven election cycles\nstudied here, the total number of quasi-sentences in the\nmanifestos studies actually decreased compared with the\npreceding ballot). Nevertheless, to control for any discrep-\nancies between the two methods, as noted, both were used in\nthe following analysis. This dual approach affirmed that the\n\"absolute totals\" method (i.e., exploring the changing totals\nof child care quasi-sentences) produced findings consistent\nwith those derived from the \"relative proportion\" method\n(thus, for example, they both reveal a significant increase in\nthe issue salience of child care over time, see Figures 1\nChild Care Policy and Westminster\nA survey of the election manifestos in the first decades after\nthe Second World War provides a clear indication of the main\npolitical parties' role in reproducing a gender-unequal soci-\nety. It also partly explains the United Kingdom's failure to\nput in place effective state child care provision seen else-\nwhere in Europe prior to the 1990s. Thus, the present mani-\nfesto analysis adds further empirical basis to Lewis's (2013)\nconclusion that civil servants and ministers \"were deter-\nmined to defend the status quo in the context of weak politi-\ncal will\" (p. 256). Against this backdrop, the history of child\ncare during the immediate post-war decades was under-\npinned by a British welfare model oriented around the male\nbreadwinner and largely concerned with poverty reduction\n(Crompton, 1999). This is evident in the manifesto discourse\nof the political Right; for example, during maternity,\nAll proper arrangements, both voluntary and state-aided, must\nbe made for the care of other young children in the family, in\norder that the energies of the male breadwinner or the kindness\nof neighbours and relations, which nevertheless must be the\nmainspring, should not be unduly burdened. (Conservative\nIt is also apparent on the Left. For example, \"Liberals oppose\nthe bringing into industry of married women with young\nchildren, but would not discourage schemes of industrial out-\nwork, to help the family budget by work done at home\"\nChild care finally emerges as a manifesto policy issue in\nWestminster elections in 1983. Notably, it is articulated as a\ngender equality initiative. The left-of-center Labour Party\n(1983) promises, \"[We will] introduce positive action pro-\ngrammes to promote women's rights and opportunities, and\nappoint a cabinet minister to promote equality between the\nsexes. [Furthermore] We will: Improve child care and other\nsocial services\" (p. 17).11 Yet, it continues to attract limited\nattention in party programs until the 1992 election (just 3.3%\nof all references were recorded before 1992). Subsequently,\nthere is a significant increase in salience; 12.7% of all refer-\nences were made in the 1992 election. There are a number of\nexplanations for this step change. One is the growing domes-\ntic and international political attention to gender equality\ndriven by the earlier round of activism associated with \"sec-\nond-wave\" feminism, a process that highlighted the domestic\ndivision of labor as an enduring source of inequality between\nthe sexes (cf. Keetley & Pettegrew, 2005). Further impetus\nwas derived from legislative developments (including the\nU.K.'s ratification, inApril 1986, of the United Nations [UN]\nConvention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against\nWomen [CEDAW]). This obliged government \"to encourage\nthe provision of the necessary supporting social services to\nenable parents to combine family obligations with work\nresponsibilities and participation in public life, in particular\nthrough promoting the establishment and development of a\nOn the back of these developments, the data reveal how\nchild care becomes an increasingly important policy issue in\nU.K. electoral politics from 1992 onward. Thus, there is a\nthreefold increase in the number of references to child care\nical (re-)prioritization confirmed by the contrasting method-\nological techniques used here. Specifically, it is revealed\nwhen absolute totals of child care quasi-sentences are exam-\nined (Figure 1)--and, it is also apparent when all parties'\nchild care references are plotted as a percentage of total\nquasi-sentences (i.e., on all topics and issues) in each elec-\ntion (Figure 2). Thus, 3.3% of references were made in the\nThe data also reveal the party dynamics behind the overall\nincrease in issue salience. In this regard, there are statisti-\ncally significant differences between parties (p  .001).12\nOver the post-1983 period, Labour can be seen as \"issue\nowners\" of child care; the party accounts for more than two\nthirds (68%) of manifesto references (this compares with\n23.3% for the Conservatives and just 8.6% for the Liberal\nDemocrats). It is only belatedly that the Conservative Party\nhas begun to challenge Labour's position. For almost two\nthirds (61.3%) of the party's references to child care were\nearlier analysis highlighting how the party has attempted to\n(re-)position itself as being more socially progressive than in\nthe past (cf. Kerr, Byrne, & Foster, 2011).

In this way,\nthe discourse underpins the development of the \"Sure Start\"\nprogram of children's centers to provide child care, early\neducation, health, and family support introduced by the party\nstark reminder of Labour's shift away from its earlier empha-\nsis on statist solutions to welfare issues (Pugh, 2011). It is\nalso reflective of the wider rise of welfare pluralism, whereby\nvoluntary and private-sector organizations complement state\nwelfare delivery (Beresford & Croft, 1983; Fyfe, Timbrell, &\nWhile noting Campbell-Barr's (2009) cogent observation\nthat \"it is neither so simple or accurate as to suggest that the\nprivate sector is more likely to focus on the business side of\nthings and the voluntary sector on the care side\" (p. 85), there\nis a statistically significant difference in the parties' use of\nthe frame (p .05).14 For the Conservatives make the major-\nity (71%) of explicit references to private-sector/for-profit\nchild care as part of a mixed economy of provision, whereas\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats predominate in advocat-\ning third-sector partnership with public-sector providers\nstrengthen parental engagement with Sure Start Children's\nCentres. Some voluntary and third-sector organisations\nalready run networks of Centres, and we will now pioneer\nmutual federations running groups of local Children's\nCentres in the community interest\" (p. 57), whereas the\nConservative Party (2010) discourse is typified by the\nfollowing:\nWe support the provision of free nursery care for pre-school\nchildren and we want that support to be provided by a diverse\nrange of providers--including the many child-minders and\nprivate . . . and independent nurseries which are currently being\nsqueezed out of the system. (p. 48)\nNotwithstanding the foregoing contrasts, there is evi-\ndence of Right\u00adLeft convergence in the second frame, \"tax\nallowance/social security payments.\" This reflects the wider\nadoption of \"social investment\" approaches to welfare by\nparties across the political spectrum in Europe and elsewhere\n(cf. Vandenbroucke, 2011). It is a policy approach that aims\nto secure future societal well-being through investing in chil-\ndren and is predicated on breaking the inter-generational\ntransmission of inequality and disadvantage. Labour accounts\nfor 42.1% of \"tax allowance/social security payments\" quasi-\nsentences, the Conservatives 36.8%, and Liberal Democrats\n21%. Examples include,\nWe will extend the exemption from tax which applies to\nworkplace nurseries to all forms of employer assistance with\nDuring the next Parliament, we will ensure that all working\nfamilies who qualify for the working tax credit will receive up to\n\u00a350 a week for each child under the age of five, irrespective of the\ntype of childcare they choose.

Figure 4 repre-\nsents these differences graphically in the form of \"framing\nprofiles.\" For each of the three regional polities, a histogram\ndisplays the percentage of the manifesto discourse on child\ncare falling under each frame. In turn, the contrasting shape,\nor \"profile,\" of each underlines the differing ways in which\npolicy is framed, or envisioned, in each territory. Key territo-\nrial differences revealed by this technique include the dispro-\nportionately strong emphasis placed on mixed economy\napproaches in Scotland, greater attention to tackling poverty\nand regulation of child care/staff training in Wales, and the\nrelative emphasis on gender equality and workplace provi-\nsion in Northern Ireland.\nOverall, across polities, the lead frame is \"mixed economy\nof provision\" (24.3% of child care quasi-sentences).\nManifestos in Scotland account for most references (46.6%),\nfollowed by Wales (40.5%) and Northern Ireland (13%;\np .001).17 Of particular significance here is the contrast with\npolicy framing in statewide Westminster elections.

Most references\nwere made in Wales (63.8% of the regional total), followed\n.001).19 The geographical contrasts in the use of this frame\nagain highlight the historically contingent way policy devel-\nops in the wake of the move to regional elections. The Welsh\nemphasis on regulation and training can be seen as the prod-\nuct of earlier official inquiries into failings in children's resi-\ndential care, which has prompted a wider series of legislative\nand policy reforms encompassing child care (such as the cre-\nation of a children's commissioner's office, and Welsh\nGovernment adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of\nthe Child; cf. Pithouse, 2011). Examples of this discourse\ninclude, \"an Early Years Taskforce will be established to\ndevelop . . . a national training framework for those working\nwith young children, together with a simplified qualifica-\nognise the need to develop the childcare workforce, provide\nmore opportunities for training and update the information\navailable on the sector\" (Welsh Liberal Democrats, 2007, p.\n29). Notwithstanding the territorialization of policy, the lim-\nited propensity of parties to frame proposals in terms of gen-\nder equality spanned in both tiers of governance; just 5.4% of\nall child care quasi-sentences came under this frame at the\nregional level.\nParty Politicization: Inter-Party Contrasts in Issue\nSalience and Framing\nIn each polity, the data reveal inter-party contrasts in issue\nsalience and the framing of child care policy. This matters\nbecause policy is now set by contrasting arrays of parties in\neach regional polity, each of which not only has its own\nvision of contemporary child care policy but also has held\ngovernment office since 1998. Notably, the issue-salience\ndata show that, across meso-polities, nationalist parties pay\ngreatest attention to child care. Thus, in Scotland, the SNP\naccounted for most references to child care (38.6%), followed\nby Scottish Liberal Democrats, Scottish Labour, and Scottish\np .05).20 For the SNP and Scottish Liberal Democrats, the\nlead frame is \"mixed economy provision\" (35.9% and 30% of\neach party's child care references, respectively; for example,\n\"the piloting of Children's Centres across Scotland . . . in a true\npublic/private voluntary partnership councils will be encour-\naged to site centres in schools in rural areas or peripheral urban\nestates,\" SNP, 1999, p. 22). In contrast, the lead frame for\nScottish Labour was \"the economy/tackling poverty\" (23%).\nIn Wales, Plaid Cymru accounted for most of the refer-\nences (40.9%) to child care, followed by Welsh Labour, the\nand 13.8%, respectively). Reflecting its emphasis on commu-\nnity engagement/development, Plaid's lead frame is \"mixed\neconomy of provision\" (36% of party quasi-sentences; for\nexample, \"A Plaid Government will prioritise universal,\naffordable, and high quality child care, provided by a range\nof deliverers, for every family in Wales,\" Plaid Cymru, 2007,\np. 38). In contrast, rival Welsh Labour (2007) places greatest\nemphasis on \"the economy/tackling poverty\" (27.4%; for\nexample, \"High quality childcare for all 2 year olds in our\nmost disadvantaged communities . . . This will assist those\nparents who are currently economically inactive to find\nemployment and, thereby, to tackle one of the roots of child\npoverty,\" p. 39). The latter reflects its strategic focus on end-\nIn Northern Ireland, the nationalist parties again predomi-\nnate; they account for more than two thirds of all references\nto child care (SDLP and Sinn Fein, each accounting for\n37.5% of the regional total).22 For both, the lead frame is\n\"tackling poverty\" (40% and 38.2% of each party's refer-\nences to child care; for example, \"the SDLP views employ-\nment as a key route out of poverty which is why we must\ndevelop affordable and sustainable childcare policies that\nwill allow many economically inactive people to return to\nIn the case of statewide parties in Scotland and Wales, the\nterritorialization of child care policy is also driven by intra-\nparty differences in both issue salience and framing (p  .05),\nin other words, contrasting policy programs advanced by the\nUnited Kingdom and \"regional\" divisions of the same party\n(e.g., between U.K. Labour, Scottish Labour, and Welsh\ndivergence has emerged from rapid and far-reaching institu-\ntional change whereby they \"have shifted significantly from\nbeing traditional, centralized parties\" (p. 88). For example,\nWelsh Labour (2007) pledged, \"We will provide targeted\nsupport to help lone parents to find and stay in work, includ-\ning support for cooperative enterprises which provide emer-\ngency childcare for women in work\" (p. 28). Scottish Labour\nmade no such commitment. Instead, it promised, \"by 2011\nwe will ensure that every early years and childcare facility\nwill be led by an Early Years professional\" (Scottish Labour\nParty, 2007, p. 18). In like fashion, the Scottish Conservatives\n(2003) pledged, \"we will encourage all employers to make\nsalary-sacrifice childcare vouchers available to their employ-\nees, and we will ensure that the public sector leads the way in\nthis provision\" (p. 21), a commitment unmatched by their\nWelsh colleagues who instead stated they would pass pri-\nmary legislation in Wales whereby \"small and medium sized\nbusinesses would be rewarded for . . . providing childcare\"\nIn the case of minority nationalist parties (MNPs), child\ncare was integral to the parties' vision of each nation. For\nexample, \"now is the time for that new direction--a time to\nbuild the kind of Wales we want--universal childcare . . .\"\n(Plaid Cymru, 2007, p. 23). child care was also expressed in\nthe context of their ideological goal of independence. For\nexample, \"We will be able to address the priorities of people\nin Scotland, from better state pensions to universal free\nchildcare . . . Independence will allow us to make Scotland a\nbetter place to live\" (SNP, 2011, p. 37). In Wales, the dis-\ncourse also emphasized Welsh medium child care (e.g., we\nwill put in place \"targets for Welsh-medium educare in every\nDiscussion\nThe present findings highlight the discursive underpinnings\nof the late-20th-century rise in child care policy in the United\nKingdom. They show a significant growth in the issue\nsalience of child care in the electoral discourse of the main\nstatewide parties in Westminster elections, thereby revealing\nit to be part of the rise of valence politics. The data also show\nthat, across parties, child care policy is latterly framed more\nin terms of social investment than as a gender equality issue.\nOne reading of this is that it augurs well; it signals the recon-\nciliation of the Wollstonecraft dilemma24 and the ushering-in\nof a \"post-feminist\" era in which policy-makers have pro-\ngressed from the male-breadwinner, hetero-normative\nassumptions of earlier decades. On this reading, it suggests a\npolicy framework that supports parents and guardians\nequally, regardless of sex, when seeking to balance child\nraising and engagement with the labor market.\nHowever, it is argued that the foregoing is eclipsed by\nanother, more worrying interpretation. For although child\ncare issues affect both male and female parents, collectively,\nwomen remain the principal carers of young children\n(Windebanke, 1996). Deep-set and enduring patterns and\nprocesses of sex inequality in the labor market (Charles,\n2003) mean that parties' failure to frame child care in the\ncontext of gender equality can be seen as a key failing. Not\nleast, it is a derogation from the obligations of international\nagreements such as CEDAW. This was highlighted in the lat-\nest UN Convention Progress Report on the United Kingdom\n(2013), which concluded that contemporary issues facing\nwomen include,\nThe continued discrimination against women in the labour\nmarket in terms of opportunities and equal pay; the reduction in\nlegal support and access to justice for women suffering\ndiscrimination; [and] welfare reforms which are pushing more\nwomen into poverty and insecurity. (p. 56)\nMoreover, it singled out the fact that \"there was no uni-\nversal childcare provision,\" in turn, questioning, \"was the\nGovernment prepared to increase infrastructure to make\naffordable childcare better available?\" (p. 56).\nThus, the current manifesto data provide further empirical\nbacking for Lister's (2006) insightful work on New Labour\npolicy and disquiet related to \"the construction of children as\n`becomings' rather than `beings'; the paid-work-focused and\nfuture-oriented model of citizenship; and the eclipse of par-\nents', and in particular, mothers' welfare . . . [and] principles\nof (gendered) social justice\" (p. 315). Moreover, the mani-\nfesto discourse reveals issues of inter-generational equity\nand how, as Jensen (2009) cogently observes, contemporary\nemphasis on social-investment \"child-centred policy ideas,\n[means that] the equality claims of adult women and atten-\ntion to their needs are side-lined in favour of those of chil-\nAfurther issue that emerges from the foregoing analysis is\nthat of territorial justice. This is the principle that unitary\nstates do not have sub-divisions of territory that are subject\nto a different set of social rights. However, as the manifesto\ndiscourse on child care illustrates, this principle is being\nrevised in the wake of devolution. This confers a unique sta-\ntus on the discursive process of framing policy proposals in\nparty manifestos. On one hand, it is the origin of differential\nchild care regimes--as regional parties set out programs (and\nterritorial rights) that are contingent on local socio-historical\nfactors and reflective of regional party politics. Yet, on the\nother, it is also the answer to concerns over territorial (in-)\njustice, because, in democratic terms at least, it is inherently\njust--owing to democratic process of elections and mandate\nseeking.\nAllied to the foregoing, existing work explains the resil-\nience of welfare regimes in terms of the \"stickiness\" of exist-\ning policy arrangements and political constituencies\nassociated with welfare institutions and policies (cf. Pierson,\n1994). According to this view, earlier rounds of policy\nchoices, such as in relation to child care, become institution-\nalized and tend to \"crowd-out\" policy alternatives.\nFurthermore, over time, welfare institutions and policies\ngenerate their own political constituencies composed of\ngroups such as service users, employees, and professionals.\nThese combine with party politics to constrain politicians'\npolicy choices and political options. However, the present\nanalysis suggests that this can be challenged by devolution\nand the pluralizing of electoral systems. This is because\n(quasi-)federalism introduces a new spatial policy dynamic\nwhereby regime resilience is also shaped by electoral dis-\ncourse, issue salience, and policy framing. As the present\nanalysis shows, in multi-level systems, earlier statewide\nmandated child care policies are revised over successive\nelection cycles as part of a discursive process, as parties\ncompete in placing policy proposals before voters.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: Research funding\nis acknowledged.\nNotes\n\nParliament.\n2.
