This study aimed to\ndescribe our experience of treatment of 36 patients with KAC.\nMethods: Thirty-six patients (30 males and 6 females, aged 19\u00ad38 years) with KAC, who had\npreviously taken a muscarinic receptor blocker and/or antibiotics, but without symptomatic relief,\nwere treated with botulinum toxin A injection combined with bladder hydrodistention.\nUrodynamic testing, and the O'Leary\u00adSant interstitial cystitis symptom index (ICSI) and problem\nindex (ICPI) were used to evaluate baseline values and improvement before and after the\ntreatment.\nResults: One month post-treatment, all patients achieved marked relief of symptoms. The\nnocturia time was markedly reduced, while bladder capacity, the interval between micturition,\nthe void volume, and the maximum flow rate were remarkably increased at 1 month. Additionally,\nthe ICSI and ICPI were significantly improved.\nConclusion: Botulinum toxin A injection along with bladder hydrodistention is effective for\nmanaging KAC.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/imr\n1College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Southern\nMedical University, Guangzhou, China\n2Department of Urology Surgery, Hospital of Traditional\nChinese Medicine of Zhongshan, Zhongshan, China\n3Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hospital of\nTraditional Chinese Medicine of Zhongshan, Zhongshan,\nChina\n4Department of Anesthesiology, Zhongshan Torch\nDevelopment Zone Hospital, Zhongshan, China\n5Center of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine for\nKidney Diseases, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical\nUniversity, Guangzhou, China\nCorresponding author:\nLianbo Wei, Center of Integrated Chinese and Western\nMedicine for Kidney Diseases, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern\nMedical University. 253 Middle Industrial Road, Guangzhou\nEmail: drweilianbo@sina.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.\nsagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n",

Additionally, deaths that\nresulted from ketamine abuse have been\n(KAC) was first described by Shahani\net al.11 They treated nine patients, and all\nof them had a history of ketamine abuse\nwith severe dysuria, increased frequency and\nurgency of urination, and gross haematuria.\nThickening of the bladder wall, low bladder\ncapacity, and negative urine bacterial cul-\ntures were found in all of the patients, as well\nas cystoscopy-confirmed cystitis. Since this\ntime, a few more case reports on KAC have\nrecreational drug has markedly increased\nin China in the recent decade,16 and an\nincreasing number of patients with KAC\nhave visited our centre. Because KAC is a\nnew disorder, treatment of KAC in a rela-\ntively large number of patients has not been\nreported. We present our experience of\ntreatment of 36 patients with KAC using\nbotulinum toxin type A injection along with\nbladder hydrodistention.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nFor this prospective study, a total of 36\nyears) with KAC were recruited at our\nhad a history of ketamine abuse ranging\nfrom 1 to 5 years. Prior to admission at our\ncentre, they had been treated in out-\npatient clinics with a muscarinic receptor\nblocker and/or antibiotics, but without\nsymptomatic relief. The research protocol\nwas approved by the Medical Research\nCommittee, the Affiliated Zhongshan\nHospital of Guangzhou University of\nChinese Medicine (approval number:\nZSZY-LLK-030). Informed written consent\nwas obtained from all of the patients.\nLaboratory tests and other examinations\nBlood and urine biochemical tests, and urine\nbacterial culture were performed in our\ndiagnostic laboratory. Ultrasonography\nand urodynamic testing were carried out to\nexamine bladder structure and function.\nTreatment and outcome assessment\nA cystoscope was advanced into the bladder\nunder subarachnoid and epidural anaesthe-\nsia. A volume of 20 mL of botulinum toxin\ninto the bladder wall through a cystoscopic\ninjection needle (40 points in the wall were\nselected and each point received 0.5 mL\nbotulinum toxin type A). The bladder was\nthen distended by filling it with saline under\na pressure of 80 cm, which was maintained\nfor 5 min while the bladder capacity was\nthen drained, the cystoscope was with-\ndrawn, and a urinary catheter was placed\nfor 3 days. Those with a positive urine\nbacterial culture were administered cefurox-\nThe O'Leary\u00adSant interstitial cystitis\nsymptom index (ICSI) and problem index\n(ICPI) were used to evaluate baseline values\nand improvement in patients. Urodynamic\ntesting results were compared before and\nafter treatment.\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are expressed as mean \u00c6 standard\ndeviation. Comparison of data before and\nafter treatment was performed using the\npaired Student's t test. P < 0.05 was con-\nsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nThe demographics and clinical characteris-\ntics of patients at the time of admission are\nshown in Table 1. The disease duration\nranged from 6\u00ad24 months. All of the\npatients ceased ketamine during the entire\nstudy period. At admission, an ultrasono-\ngraphic examination showed that the major\npathological changes included an abnormal\nbladder shape, low bladder capacity, and\nbladder wall thickening. Cystoscopy showed\nmild hyperaemia or erythematous patches in\nthe bladder. Urodynamic testing showed\noveractivity of detrusor smooth muscle and\nreduced bladder adaptability.\nPositive urine bacterial culture in two\npatients turned sterile after treatment with\ncefuroxime. Elevated blood alanine amino-\ntransferase and aspartate aminotransferase\nlevels in four of five patients decreased to\nwithin the normal range after hepatoprotec-\ntive treatment. Haematuria in all three\npatients and suprapubic pain in eight of 11\npatients disappeared 1 month post-botuli-\nnum toxin A injection and bladder hydro-\ndistention. Three patients still had\nsuprapubic pain, but it was greatly reduced.\nOther major symptoms, (e.g., increased fre-\nquency and urgency of urination, and urin-\nary incontinence) were markedly relieved as\nreflected by significant improvement in base-\nline parameters, and the O'Leary\u00adSant\ninterstitial cystitis symptom index and prob-\nlem index (Table 2).\nDiscussion\nKetamine abuse is more often seen in young\nthan in older people, which is consistent\nwith the fact that we treated young people\n(mean age of 26 years). The mechanism by\nwhich ketamine induces cystitis is unclear.\nHigh levels of ketamine metabolites (e.g.,\nnorketamine and hydroxynorketamine) are\ndetected in urine from individuals with\nketamine abuse,17 suggesting that these\nactive metabolites might be responsible for\nirritation and inflammation of the bladder.\nIn this study, we were unable to measure\nurine ketamine metabolites because of a lack\nof appropriate instruments.\nExperience in the treatment of KAC is\nsparse. Shahani showed that cessation of\nTable 1.

This\ndiscrepancy between reports probably\nreflects the fact that KAC responds differ-\nentially to ketamine cessation and pharma-\ncological therapy at different stages. In the\nearly stage, but not the later stage of disease,\nketamine cessation together with other\nmedications may resolve lower urinary\ntract symptoms.13 In our series, the disease\nduration ranged from 6\u00ad24 months, and all\npatients had taken a muscarinic receptor\nblocker and/or antibiotics, but there was no\nsymptomatic relief. Therefore, injection of\nbotulinum toxin type A and bladder hydro-\ndistention were applied to treat the patients.\nBotulinum toxin type A has been used in a\nrefractory interstitial cystitis.18\u00ad20 A dose of\n100 IU botulinum toxin type A is used in\nmost cases. However, Manning et al.18\nreported that 200 IU abobotulinum A did\nnot lead to improvement in some patients,\nand they then increased the dose to 500 IU\ntype A). Therefore, because of possible\ninefficacy at a dose of 100 IU, we selected a\ndose of 200 IU for KAC treatment. This\ndose resulted in significant relief of symp-\ntoms, and marked improvement in baseline\nparameters, and ICSI and ICPI scores.\nBotulinum toxin type A inhibits vesicular\nrelease of excitatory neurotransmitters and\nneuropeptides, such as acetylcholine, nor-\nepinephrine, and adenosine triphosphate,\nthus reducing detrusor smooth muscle over-\nactivity.21 Additionally, botulinum toxin\ntype A has anti-nociceptive effects on blad-\nder hypersensitivity.22 Despite these find-\nings, the effectiveness of botulinum toxin\ntype A in the treatment of refractory inter-\nstitial cystitis remains controversial.18\u00ad20 In\na multicentre, prospective, randomised,\ndouble-blind study, Manning et al.18\nreported that treatment with a new botu-\nlinum toxin type A formulation, abobotuli-\nnum A, did not lead to overall improvement\nin total O'Leary\u00adSant scores. Similarly, Lee\net al.19 showed that botulinum toxin A\ninjections did not benefit patients with\nulcer-type interstitial cystitis. In contrast,\nmore recently, Akiyama et al.20 demon-\nstrated that botulinum toxin A injections\nwere effective in the treatment of refractory\ninterstitial cystitis. However, they did not\ncharacterize interstitial cystitis. The reason\nfor this disparity in outcomes between\nstudies is probably that different types of\nTable 2.

The\nAmerican Urological Association suggests\nthat when hydrodistention is carried out for\ntherapeutic purposes, it must be performed\nO) and for\nless than 10 min.27 This guideline was fol-\nlowed in this study and hydrodistention was\nperformed at a pressure of 80 cm H2\nO for\n5 min. Recently, Kuo and Chancellor25 used\nbotulinum toxin type A injection followed\nby hydrodistention, similar to our strategy,\nfor treatment of patients with refractory\ninterstitial cystitis. They showed that this\ncombination method produced significantly\nbetter clinical results than hydrodistention\nalone.25 Wu et al.28 recently suggested dif-\nferent therapeutic strategies for patients\nwith KAC at different clinical stages. They\nclassified patients into three stages (I\u00adIII)\naccording to the severity of the disease, the\ndose, and the duration of ketamine abuse.\nWhile pharmacotherapy and bladder hydro-\ndistention were suitable for patients at stages\nI\u00adII, surgical intervention was proposed for\npatients at stage III who had multiorgan\ndysfunction, the longest history, and the\nhighest dose of ketamine abuse. The authors\nperformed surgical intervention in six\npatients at stage III and improvement was\nobserved in all treated subjects. However,\nsurgical intervention as an effective thera-\npeutic option for advanced KAC still needs\nto be validated in larger series.\nConclusion\nThirty-six patients with KAC refractory to\nconservative pharmacotherapy were effect-\nively treated with botulinum toxin A injec-\ntion along with bladder hydrodistention.\nThese findings are important because\nexperience of treatment for KAC in a rela-\ntively large number of patients is still lacking.\nBecause of loss to follow-up, we were unable\nto provide long-term follow-up results, which\nis a major limitation of the study. Therefore,\nlong-term follow -up is warranted in future\nstudies. Another limitation of our study is\nthat this was single-centre experience.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was funded by the Zhongshan Science\nZhongshan Bureau of Science and Technology,\nZhongshan City, China.\nReferences\n1.
