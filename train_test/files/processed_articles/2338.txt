    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\nincludes a major expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults in 2014.\nThis paper describes the Oregon Health Study, a randomized controlled\ntrial that will be able to shed some light on the likely effects of such\nexpansions. In 2008, Oregon randomly drew names from a waiting list\nfor its previously closed public insurance program. Our analysis of\nenrollment into this program found that people who signed up for the\nwaiting list and enrolled in the Oregon Medicaid program were likely to\nhave worse health than those who did not. However, actual enrollment\nwas fairly low, partly because many applicants did not meet eligibility\nstandards.\nOne of the primary components of\nthe recently enacted health re-\nform law, the Patient Protection\nis a major expansion of Medicaid,\nparticularly to low-income adults. The probable\nimpact of such an expansion on the newly\ncovered population is of obvious interest. This\narticledescribes an ongoing Medicaid expansion\nexperiment in Oregon that provides a unique\nopportunity to investigate its impact through\nrandomized evaluation.\nFor a limited time in early 2008, Oregon had a\nreservation list (a waiting list) for enrollment in\nits previously closed program that expanded\nMedicaid coverage to low-income adults. More\nbut the state did not have enough funding to\ncover them all. Between March and Octo-\ndrawn from the list, and those selected were\npermitted to apply for coverage.\nOregon's coverage expansion essentially\namounts to a randomized controlled trial of ex-\npanding public health insurance coverage for\nlow-income adults. Those not selected from\nthe list provide a control group for those who\nwere.Working closely with Oregon's Division of\nMedical Assistance Programs and the Office for\nOregon HealthPolicy and Research, welaunched\nthe Oregon Health Study--a multiprong re-\nsearch effort designed to measure the effects\nof this expansion on myriad outcomes. To our\nknowledge, the study is the first randomized\ncontrolled trial on the effects of covering the\nformerly uninsured. In this paper we describe\nthe Oregon experiment--and some of our\nplanned analyses--in more detail.\nThe parallel between the Oregon expansion\nand the new federally mandated expansion\nmakes the results of our study particularly\ntimely. Of course, the populations affected in\nOregon and nationally, as well as the enrollment\nprocess, differ in important ways. Caution is thus\nwarranted in generalizing results from our study\nto other settings.\nTwo issues discussed below are worth high-\nlighting at the outset. First, Oregon is different\nfrom the rest of the country. For instance, its\npopulation is whiter, and it has demonstrated\na particular interest in Medicaid policy innova-\ntion. Second, enrollment in the Oregon Medic-\naid expansion was voluntary. There was no\nmandate like the one for individuals to purchase\nThe People-to-People Health\nFoundation, Inc.\nHeidi Allen is a research\nscientist at the Center for\nOutcomes Research and\nEducation, Providence Health\nSystem, in Portland, Oregon.\nKatherine Baicker (kbaicker@\nhsph.harvard.edu) is a\nprofessor of health economics\nin the Department of Health\nPolicy and Management,\nSchool of Public Health,\nHarvard University, in Boston,\nMassachusetts.\nAmy Finkelstein is a\nprofessor in the Department\nof Economics at the\nMassachusetts Institute of\nTechnology, in Cambridge.\nSarah Taubman is a research\nfellow at the National Bureau\nof Economic Research, in\nCambridge.\nBill J.

Take-up of coverage was low among the\npeople selected from the list.\nLow take-up, or a relatively small portion of\nselected individuals who acquire insurance, does\nnot pose a problem for causal inference within\nthe confines of our study. However, it does sug-\ngest caution in applying our results to a manda-\ntory expansion. In that case, even with imperfect\nenforcement, we might expect substantially\nhigher take-up. Furthermore, different types of\npeople would gain coverage if there were a man-\ndate for everyone to do so.\nPrevious Research\nA large amount of scholarly research has exam-\nined the impact of insurance on health outcomes\nand the use of health care. Broadly speaking, this\nresearch fits into three main categories: obser-\nvational studies, quasi-experimental studies,\nand randomized experiments.\nObservational Studies Hundreds of obser-\nvational studies over the past several decades\nhave compared the health of and health care\nuse by insured and uninsured populations. The\nInstitute of Medicine (IOM) reviewed this liter-\nature and reported that the lack of health insur-\nance leads to thousands of preventable deaths\neach year in the United States.1 The studies col-\nlectively suggest that expanding insurance cov-\nerage is critically important to improving public\nhealth.2 Yet there remains much debate about\nthe relationship between health spending and\nSome reviewers have pointed out limitations\nin the literature from the observational stud-\nies.6,7 In particular, few of the studies effectively\ncontrolled for underlying differences in health\nstatus and other characteristics between unin-\nsured and insured patients. If the two groups\nare different in unobserved ways, whether or\nnot they have insurance might not be the cause\nof their different outcomes.\nQuasi-Experimental Studies Quasi-experi-\nmental studies rely on differences in the avail-\nability of public insurance, or other policy\nchanges, to assess thecausal effects of insurance.\nFor example, variation across time and space in\nstate Medicaid expansions allows researchers to\ntry to assess the effects of such expansions.\nThe effects have been mixed. Some studies\nhave found evidence that public health insurance\nreduces mortality among infants and children8\u00ad10\nand improves some outcomes--although not\nmortality--among the elderly.11\u00ad14 Although they\nare much more persuasive than observational\nstudies, quasi-experimental studies are not truly\nrandomized. Thus, investigators must rely on\nthe assumption that the people whose health\ninsurance was affected by environmental or pol-\nicy changes are otherwise identical to the people\nin the comparison group.\nRandomized Experiments A randomized ex-\nperiment provides a particularly compelling way\nof assessing the causal impact of health insur-\nance. The random assignment of people into\neither the treatment or the control group means\nthat the groups' characteristics do not differ sys-\ntematically, except for the variable being stud-\nied: in this case, the presence or absence of\nhealth insurance. Researchers can thus be sure\nthat the variable is causing any differences. Of\ncourse, randomized experiments have their lim-\nitations, some of which we detail below in the\ncontext of our study.\nBefore ours, there was only one randomized\nstudy of health insurance in the United States:\nthe RAND Health Insurance Experiment of the\nrandomly assigned participants to plans with\nvarying amounts for copayments and maximum\nout-of-pocket spending limits. Researchers fol-\nlowed the participants for three to five years,\ncollecting biometric health measures such as\nblood pressure.\nThe strength of the experimental design is\npartly responsible for the enduring impact of\nthe RAND study, which remains a standard refer-\nence in the health insurance literature. However,\nthe study also has two key limitations for current\npolicy analysis. First, it ended more than twenty-\nfive years ago, and health care was very different\nthen. Second, it was designed to measure the\nimpact of insurance generosity, not the impact\nof having any insurance at all. No one in the\nRAND study was assigned to a \"no coverage\"\ngroup. The maximum out-of-pocket exposure\nWhether insurance with lower cost sharing\nleads to improved health is an important ques-\ntion. But it is very different from the one that our\nstudy asks: What are the effects of having health\ninsurance?\nThe Oregon Reservation List\nOregon's Medicaid program, the Oregon Health\nPlan, has two separate parts. Oregon Health Plan\nPlus is for the categorically eligible Medicaid\npopulation, which includes groups such as\nlow-income children, pregnant women, welfare\nrecipients, and poor elderly and disabled popu-\nlations. Oregon Health Plan Standard is for poor\nadults who are financially but not categorically\neligible for the Plus program. The Standard pro-\ngram, which is the subject of our study, provides\nrelatively comprehensive benefits with no con-\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

In\nearly 2008 the state determined that it had the\nBecause Oregon's Department of Human Ser-\nvices correctly anticipated that the demand for\nthe program would far exceed the new slots, the\nagency received permission from the Centers for\nMedicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to open a\nwaiting list and randomly draw names from it to\ndetermine who would be offered the opportunity\nto enroll. This process was chosen because it\ngave everyone on the list an equal opportunity\nThanks to an aggressive outreach campaign,\nTo sign up, people had to provide their name,\ndate of birth, sex, address, telephone number,\nand preferred language of communication. En-\nrollment forms were available in English and\nSpanish. People were also asked to list the name,\nsex, and date of birth of anyone age nineteen or\nolder in the household whom they wished to add\nto the reservation list.20\nWe used this information to exclude from our\nstudy population anyone who gave an address\noutside of Oregon, was born before 1944 or after\n1989, had enrolled in the plan as of Janu-\nary 2008, gave an institutional address, or was\nsigned up by an unrelated third party. Those\nsigned up by a third party were not likely to be\neligible or to enroll. These exclusions left us with\nwaiting list were conducted monthly from March\nto October 2008. People whose names were\ndrawn were eligible to apply for Oregon Health\nPlan Standard coverage and were sent applica-\ntion materials. Everyone received a two-page ap-\nplication form; it could be accompanied by up to\neight supplemental forms.\nThe main form asked for the names of all\nhousehold members applying for coverage and\ninquired about their Oregon residence, U.S. cit-\nizenship, insurance coverage over the past six\nmonths, household income over the past two\nmonths, and assets. Documentation of identity\nand citizenship and proof of income had to be\nreturned with the completed form.21\nThose who submitted the required paperwork\nand met the eligibility criteria were enrolled in\nthe plan. All enrolled individuals had to recertify\ntheir eligibility every six months.\nThe Oregon Health Study\nFor the Oregon Health Study, which is ongoing,\nwe are collecting data from several sources to\ncompare the \"treatment group\"--in other words,\ndrawn from the waiting list--and the control\ngroup, drawn from those who were not selected\nfrom the list using the same random selection\nprocedure. We will assess the causal effects of\ncoverage expansions on a wide range of out-\ncomes, including access to and use of health\ncare, household finances and medical debt,\nhealth behaviors, physical and mental health\noutcomes, labor-market outcomes, and other\nmeasures of well-being.\nThe analysis will help us shed light not just on\nthe impacts of insurance on health and well-\nbeing, but on the channels through which health\ninsurance affects outcomes.We hope to examine\nvariations in subpopulations of particular inter-\nest, such as the elderly and those in poor health.\nData Sources\nThe Oregon Health Study will rely on three pri-\nmary data sources: mail and telephone surveys,\nin-person interviews and health screenings, and\nadministrative records. Data collection began in\nthe summer of 2008 and will continue at least\nMail And Phone Surveys We surveyed the\npeople on the waiting list by mail and phone,\ncontacting those who were selected from the list\nand those who were not.

We conducted a fol-\nlow-up survey of the same individuals a year\nlater, including additional efforts to boost re-\nsponse rates, and we achieved an effective re-\nsponse rate of slightly above 50 percent.\nIn-Person Interviews We began an inten-\nsive effort to collect data in person in Septem-\nWe targeted a randomly selected subset of the\nlarger study panel from the greater Portland\narea. Preliminary results suggest that we will\nachieve a response rate of about 70 percent.\ninterviews.\nThe in-person data collection complements\nthe mail and phone surveys in three important\nways. First, the comprehensive set of interview\nquestions will give us a much more detailed pic-\nture of individuals' health and health care expe-\nriences. Second, wewillcollect objectivephysical\nhealth measurements such as blood pressure,\nheight, and weight, as well as blood samples\nso that we can evaluate cholesterol, blood sugar,\nand measures of immune response. Such objec-\ntive physiological measures are particularly im-\nportant because insurance may affect not only\nhealth but also the likelihood of diagnosis and\nthus individuals' knowledge of their health con-\nditions. In fact, the RAND study found effects of\nhealth insurance generosity on objectively mea-\nsured blood pressure when respondents did not\nreport any changes themselves. People may be\nless likely to acquire insurance if they do not\nknow that they are sick. Third, the response rate\nof in-person contacts should be much higher\nthan that of mail and phone surveys.\nAdministrative Databases We have worked\nwith the State of Oregon to match data from the\nwaiting list with data from various administra-\ntive sources. Information on the applications\nsubmitted by people who were selected from the\nlist allows us to investigate who chose to enroll.\nData on Oregon Health Plan coverage for the\nentire list allow us to examine the impact of the\nselection off of the reservation list on public\ninsurance coverage, and how this has varied over\ntime.\nIn addition, we have matched information\nfrom the list with statewide data on hospital\ninpatient services, and we intend to include\nemergency department and mortality records\nin the future.We can use these data to investigate\nthe impact of the random selection on health\ncare use and mortality for the entire list, as well\nas to detect anydifferences inparticipationin the\nother types of data collection among those se-\nlected versus those not selected from the reser-\nvation list.\nAnalytic Approach\nThe primary analysis will compare all of those\nselected in the lottery (whether they were even-\ntually insured or not) with those not selected in\nthe lottery (again, whether they were eventually\ninsured or not). This is the \"intent to treat\" analy-\nsis common to randomized controlled trials, and\nit provides an estimate of the impact of eligibility\nto apply for Oregon Health Plan Standard that is\nnot biased by imperfect rates of enrollment.\nWe can also estimate the effect of enrolling in\ninsurance itself that is similarly unbiased, analo-\ngous to the effect of \"treatment on the treated.\"\nOf course, enrollment rates among those who\nare eligible still affect the interpretation of these\nresults: Our estimate of the impact of insurance\ncoverage applies specifically to the type of people\nwho gain coverage in response to being selected.\nCaveats And Limitations\nThe randomized allocation of health insurance\nallows us to overcome many of the difficulties\nthat observational studies face in drawing causal\ninferences about the impact of health insurance\neligibility or coverage. However, two important\ncaveats must be borne in mind in interpreting\nour analyses.\nFirst, attrition within the study population\nmay contaminate the random design, if people\ndrop out of the treatment and control groups at\ndifferent rates. This is a particular concern for\nthose surveyed by mail, whose response rates are\nlowest.\nFrom this perspective, a key advantage of ana-\nlyzing outcomes through administrative data\nsuch as hospital discharge information is that\nthese data cover all of the individuals participat-\ning in the lottery. The disadvantage of the admin-\nistrative data is that they do not span all of the\noutcomes of interest.\nHowever, we can use the administrative data to\nestimate the extent of nonresponse bias in the\nsurvey data. For example, for outcomes in the\nadministrative data that are similar to those in\nthe survey data, such as hospital utilization, we\ncan see if the effect of gaining access to insurance\nis the same for those who responded to the sur-\nvey as for those who did not.\nSecond, considerable caution must be exer-\ncised in extrapolating from our estimates of\nthe causal impact of insurance eligibility and\ncoverage to other settings, including the recent\nfederally mandated expansion of Medicaid. Our\nresults are naturally most relevant for popula-\ntions, insurance plans, health care environ-\nments, and enrollment mechanisms closest to\nthose in our study.\nIn the remainder of this paper, we therefore\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

We also\ndiscuss the health care environment. These facts\nshed light on the nature of the low-income pop-\nulation that sought insurance coverage and was\neligible for it.\nPreliminary Findings: The Study\nPopulation\nTo find out what predisposed people to sign up\nfor the waiting list and to see how representative\nour study population is, we examined data from\nthe Current Population Survey (CPS), a monthly\nnationally representative household survey of\nthe U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized popula-\nDisease Control and Prevention's (CDC's)\nBehavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System\nfrom the list.\nWe compared characteristics of the low-\nincome uninsured adult population of Oregon;\nthe low-income uninsured population of the\nUnited States; those who signed up for the wait-\ning list; and those from the list who responded to\nour initial mail and phone survey (Exhibit 1). It\nshould be noted that some people in each of\nthese groups may have been eligible for but\nnot enrolled in public insurance.\nOverall, the low-income uninsured population\nof Oregon--the target population for the waiting\nlist--is roughly comparable to that of the United\nStates as a whole. The most striking difference is\nthat the Oregon population has more whites and\nsubstantially fewer African Americans.\nIndividuals in Oregon who joined the waiting\nlist are somewhat older and appear to be sicker\nthan the overall target population. For example,\nof those who signed up, about 30 percent report\nhaving been diagnosed with high blood pres-\nsure, 11 percent with diabetes, and 17 percent\nwith asthma. Prior studies of people enrolled\nin the standard plan had very similar results.22\nThus, our survey respondents seem to be\nrepresentative of the plan's members in terms\nof their health status.\nIt is not surprising that the older and sicker\nmembers of the eligible population would be the\nones who most wanted health insurance, and\nthat they would thus be more likely to put their\nnames on the waiting list. But that finding does\nsuggest caution in extrapolating our findings on\nCharacteristics Of Low-Income Adults In The United States, Oregon, The Oregon Medicaid Waiting List, And The Authors'\nInitial Survey Of People On That List\nCharacteristic U.S. Oregon Waiting list Initial survey\nAmong the uninsured\nPercent diagnosed with diabetes 8 6 \u00ada 11\nSOURCES Current Population Surveys (CPS), 2004\u00ad6; Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 2004\u00ad7; and Oregon Health\nStudy.

Evidence from\nthe RAND experiment and other studies sug-\ngests that the benefits of health insurance are\nconcentrated among low-income individuals in\npoor health, such as those who signed up for the\nAlthough still low-income, people on the list\nreported incomes that were much higher than\nthose of the low-income uninsured populations\nof Oregon or the United States. In fact, only\n61 percent of the people in our initial survey\nreportedincomes belowthefederal povertylevel.\nThis suggests that some of those who joined\nthe waiting list may have been confused about\nthe program. Only households with incomes be-\nlow the federal poverty level are eligible for the\nStandard plan. Another possibility is that the\nincomes of this population are volatile enough\nthat people were uncertain about their future\neligibility.\nThe Health Care Environment\nAnother relevant factor in assessing the general-\nizability of results from the Oregon Health Study\nis whether the environment in which this pop-\nulation receives health care is similar to that in\nother states.\nOregon is similar to the national average in\nhow many of its hospital admissions arein public\nhospitals (just under 15 percent for both), and in\nuncompensated care as a fraction of gross hos-\npitalcharges(6.8percentforOregonand5.6per-\nThe Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sys-\ntem data also show that low-income uninsured\nOregonians have an access gap relative to their\ninsured counterparts that is similar to that in the\nrest of the country. Together, this suggests that\nthe consequences of gaining insurance coverage\nfor low-income adults may be similar in Oregon\nand in the nation overall.\nDeterminants Of Health Insurance\nTake-Up\nThe phenomenon of low take-up rates--that is,\nlow rates of participation--for social safety-net\nprograms in the United States is widespread. The\nabundant research on possible causes has fo-\ncused on the potential roles of stigma, transac-\ntion costs, and lack of information.29\nAlthough there are limited data about the take-\nup of Medicaid among adults, some evidence\nsuggests that take-up among newly eligible preg-\nnant women and children is under 35 percent\nand that only 50 percent of eligible adults with-\nThere are several reasons why we might have\nexpected higher-than-usual take-up in our set-\nting. First, members of this population ex-\npressed some interest in coverage by joining\nthe waiting list. Second, unlike standard Medic-\naid programs, Oregon Health Plan Standard did\nnot give people the option to enroll only when\nthey required medical care. People selected from\nthe list had only forty-five days to apply for in-\nsurance; after this period, they were no longer\neligible to apply.\nTake-up is particularly interesting in this set-\nting because one of the standard explanations\nfor low Medicaid take-up is that individuals who\nare not enrolled are still \"conditionally covered.\"\nIn other words, they do not sign up for coverage\nuntil they become ill or pregnant.30\nselected from the list ended up enrolled in\nOregon Health Plan Standard. Of those selected,\nThus, there are two sources of slippage in take-\nup. Almost 40 percent of those selected did not\napply, and about half of those who applied were\nineligible.\nWe explored some of the reasons for these\nslippages using two data sources. First, our mail\nand phone survey asked people who had not\nreturned their applications to indicate why. Sec-\nond, when individuals did apply but were denied\ncoverage, administrative data provided the rea-\nson for denial. Combining these sources, we can\ncompare those who applied to those who did not,\nand those who were approved to those who were\ndenied (Exhibit 2).\nOf course, an important caveat here is that\nthose who responded to our survey also appear--\nbased on administrative data--to be more likely\nto apply and enroll than those who did not re-\nspond. Therefore, our survey respondents are\nnot a random sample of those who did not enroll\nin insurance. In contrast, the administrative data\ncontains all of the people on the waiting list,\nwhether or not they applied or enrolled.\nThere are clearly still\nbarriers to enrollment,\neven among those who\nare eligible.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

They were\nthree years older than those who did not apply,\nand, among survey respondents, they were more\nlikely to report being in fair or poor health and\nhaving days impaired by poor health. Those who\nenrolled were older and in worse health than the\ngeneral waiting list population, who in turn were\nolder and sicker than the low-income uninsured\nin general.\nHaving income or assets above the limits of\neligibility was a major factor in both sources of\nslippage.

This implies a corrected take-\nup rate among the eligible applicants of 39 per-\ncent, but this is probably an underestimate.\nThose selected who did not return either sur-\nveys or applications probably had rates of ineli-\ngibility that were at least as high. Furthermore,\nalmost 10 percent of the surveys that were mailed\nwere returned because of bad addresses. A sim-\nilar share of applications may have been unde-\nliverable. These additional adjustments suggest\na true take-up rate of about 50 percent among\nselected people who were eligible and received\nan application.\nThere are clearly still barriers to enrollment,\neven among those who are eligible. Despite ef-\nforts by the state to facilitate enrollment by those\nselected, paperwork requirements seem to pose\na major hurdle. A third of those who submitted\napplications failed to return all of the necessary\ndocumentation in time (Exhibit 4). Likewise, a\nthird of those who did not apply attributed their\nfailure to not having completed the application,\nfinding the paperwork a hassle, or not having the\nappropriate documentation (Exhibit 3).\nSome of this shortfall may reflect actual ineli-\ngibility, but that is unlikely to explain all of it.\nThere are indications that people who are more\ncomfortable with paperwork or more motivated\nto get insurance coverage--for example, those\nwho signed up for the list as soon as they could\nand who provided more complete contact infor-\nmation--were both more likely to apply and\nmore likely to be approved (results not shown).\nThe imperfect take-up of Oregon Health Plan\nStandard coverage by those selected from the\nwaiting list thus appears to be attributable both\nto ineligibility and to difficulty obtaining cover-\nage for the truly eligible. This is consistent with\nfindings from other studies that document the\nbarriers posed by complicated eligibility rules. It\nalso suggests that better information and\nstreamlined processes can increase take-up.33\nUnderstanding the determinants of insurance\ntake-up helps put future results from the Oregon\nHealth Study in context. Our analysis should be\ninterpreted as estimating the effect of public\nhealth insurance on those who would obtain in-\nsurance when offered the opportunity: people\nwho are likely to be older and sicker than those\nwho would not. Caution must be exercised in\nextrapolating from our results to very different\npopulations, or to very different types of insur-\nance governed by different enrollment or eli-\ngibility rules.\nConclusion\nThe selection of names from the Oregon health\ninsurance waiting list provides an exciting op-\nportunity for research. It allows us to bring the\nstrengths of randomized experiments to the\nstudy of the causal effects of expanding public\nhealth insurance in a low-income population\nwith a wide variety of outcomes.\nBoth participation in the waiting list and take-\nup of the program were higher for people in\nworse health, who may be the most motivated\nto obtain insurance. In addition, as the evidence\nfrom the RAND experiment suggests,15 they may\nbe the most likely to benefit from insurance.\nTake-up of the coverage was fairly low, partly\nbecause not everyone on the waiting list was\ntruly eligible. That so many people with income\nabove the eligibility limit participated--and, if\nselected, applied for coverage--suggests that\nthere is substantial unmet demand for health\ninsurance among those just above the federal\npoverty level.
