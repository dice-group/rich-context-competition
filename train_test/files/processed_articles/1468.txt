The metabolic\nsyndrome (MetS), a clustering of obesity, impaired glucose\nmetabolism, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, has been shown\nto be predictive for the development of diabetes and CVD\nin this young population, particularly in the overweight or\nobese (2). MetS has appeared with increasing frequency in\nchildren and adolescents, driven by the growing pediatric\nobesity epidemic (1).\nBehavioral factors such as poor dietary habits, a sedentary\nlifestyle, and a social environment which encourages unhealthy\nbehaviors are closely correlated with the prevalence of obesi-\nty and MetS in adolescents (3). During adolescence develop-\nmental physiologic changes in body composition, lipid pro-\nfile, blood pressure, insulin secretion and number of body fat\ncells occur as a result of higher levels of sex and growth hor-\nmones. This results in increased insulin resistance that is asso-\nciated with MetS. Therefore, the convergence of hormonal\nchanges associated with adolescence and unhealthy lifestyle\nbehaviors can predispose this group to MetS and obesity and\na risk of adverse CVD events later in life (3).\nAlthough obesity in children and adolescents has been\nwidely studied, MetS has not because a consensus on pedi-\natric MetS criteria did not exist until recently (4). In order\nto fill this gap, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF)\npublished the first international definition of the pediatric\nMetS in 2007 (4), facilitating comparisons between pediatric\npopulations (5).

Data were obtained\nin Korea (n=664). The 2007 International Diabetes Federation (IDF) pediatric defini-\nCharts for assessment of obesity were utilized. The prevalence of metabolic syn-\ndrome in US and Koreans was 5.5% and 2.5%, respectively. The prevalence of\nobesity was 18.1% in US compared to 9.0% in Koreans. The prevalence of abdom-\ninal obesity, hyperglycemia, and hypertriglyceridemia were higher in the US, where-\nas that of low HDL-C levels was higher in Korea. Despite the doubled prevalence\nfor the single entities of MetS and obesity in the US, the prevalence of MetS in obese\nUS and Koreans did not differ (20.8% and 24.3%, respectively). In conclusion, there\nare differences in the prevalence of MetS, obesity, and the individual MetS risk\nfactors between the US and Korean adolescents; however, the risk of MetS among\nobese adolescents is similar in both countries.\nKey Words : Adolescents; Obesity; Metabolic Syndrome; National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey;\nUnited States; Korea; International Diabetes Federation; Growth Charts\n 2010 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial\nLicense (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use,\ndistribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\ntion. Using the IDF definition as a starting point, modifica-\ntions can be made on the basis of new information (4).\nMost studies in adolescents have been limited to Western\ncountries and infrequently included Asians (6, 7). Asians, on\naverage, have a lower body mass than Western populations\nand their traditional diets and lifestyle are not commonly asso-\nciated with obesity or CVD risk. However, the incidence of\nobese children and adolescents has been increasing in Korea,\nas has urbanization and economic development. Accompany-\ning these changes is the adoption of a westernized diet and a\ntrend toward decreased physical activity (8). As young Asian\nindividuals continue to adopt Western lifestyles, it is impor-\ntant to predict the types of population-based health conse-\nquences that might follow. Our study had three main hypo-\ntheses: 1) US adolescents have a higher prevalence of obesity\nand MetS than Korean adolescents; 2) individual abnormal-\nities of MetS differ between US and Korean adolescents; and\n3) Korean adolescents have an equal or greater prevalence of\nMetS when compared to US adolescents of the same BMI cat-\negory, since Asians have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and\nCVD at lower BMI's than European populations (9). By com-\nparing the differences in the prevalence of MetS and obesity\nin US and Korean adolescents using the latest national data-\nsets, we set out to provide guidance both to countries whose\npopulation is starting to embrace Western lifestyles and to\nWestern societies who wish to reduce the high burden of com-\nplications from these conditions.\nData source and subjects\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NH-\n(11). Both were cross-sectional nationally representative sur-\nveys of the US and Korean civilian non-institutionalized pop-\nulations, and used standardized protocols within each survey\nfor all interviews and medical examinations (10, 11). Sub-\njects selected from the US NHANES were Mexican-Ameri-\ncans, non-Hispanic Whites, and non-Hispanic Blacks and\nfrom the KNHANES were Koreans. The subjects from both\ndata sets were limited to young men and non-pregnant women\naged 12 to 19 yr who participated in the medical examina-\ntion of NHANES and KNHANES and who had fasted at\nleast 8 hr prior to the blood collection. Only subjects who\nhad all five indicators of MetS measured according to IDF\ncriteria were included in the study. Samples of 734 (414 male)\nANES, respectively, were used in the analyses, and the esti-\nmated US and Korean population represented by each sam-\nple was 25.5 million and 4.4 million, respectively. The pro-\nportion of ethnicities that comprised the entire US sample\npopulation in this study was Mexican-Americans 12.2\u00b1\nUS NHANES and Korean NHANES methodologies have\nbeen described in detail elsewhere (10, 11). Socio-demograph-\nic data were collected by personal interview.\nAnthropometric indices such as height, weight, and waist\ncircumference were also extracted from each database, and body\nmass index (BMI) was calculated from height and weight. The\ndata was obtained in a similar manner in each study. Height\nwas measured in an upright position with a stadiometer, and\nweight was measured at a standing position on a self-zero-\ning scale. Waist circumference was measured at the midpoint\nbetween the bottom of the rib cage and above the top of the\niliac crest during minimal respiration. Laboratory indices and\nblood pressure were also collected by a standard protocol, and\nthe mean of the 2nd and 3rd systolic and diastolic blood pres-\nsure (SBP and DBP) readings were used for this study.Pulse\npressure was defined as the difference between SBP and DBP.\nFor both surveys, fasting blood glucose (FBG) was measured\nindirectly by spectrophotometry after an enzymatic reaction,\nand triglycerides (TG) were indirectly determined by spec-\ntrophotometry after hydrolyzation to glycerol and two-stage\nenzymatic reactions. High density lipoprotein cholesterol\n(HDL-C) was indirectly measured by spectrophotometry after\nprecipitation with sulfated alpha-cyclodextrin and a two-stage\nenzymatic reaction. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-\nC) was calculated using the Friedewald equation (serum total\ncholesterol (TC)-(HDL-C)-TG/5) after eliminating those who\nDefinition of MetS and obesity\nBecause of the profound physiological and developmental\nchanges during puberty, the 2007 pediatric IDF definition\nof MetS (4) divided children and adolescents into the follow-\ning to this definition, the adult IDF guidelines for the MetS\nwere applied to adolescents 16 years or older, and the KSSO,\na Korean-specific criterion (13), was used for Korean waist\ncircumference (WC). In individuals aged 10-15 yr, MetS is\npresent if he or she has central adiposity (90th WC per-\ncentile or adult threshold if lower) plus at least two of the\n100 mg/dL or previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes. For\ncm for Mexican Americans and 94 cm for Whites and African\nAmericans since these were smaller than the corresponding\n90th percentiles for age. For US females of all ages, we used\nthe adult threshold of 80 cm because it was smaller than their\n90th percentile for age. For Korean males and females aged\n12-15 yr, we used the WC thresholds (sex- and age-specific\n76 J. Park, D.C. Hilmers, J.A.

Obesity was defined as a BMI 95th per-\ncentile for age and gender; adolescents with a BMI 85th\nbut <95th percentile were defined as ``overweight;'' and par-\nticipants defined as ``normal weight'' had a BMI from the 5th\nStatistical methods\nStatistical analyses were performed using SAS (version\n9.1.3, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary NC, USA) and SAS-callable\nSUDAAN (version 9.0.3, Research Triangle Institute, Research\nTriangle Park, NC, USA). In order to make a statistical com-\nparison between the two countries, selected variables from\nthe combined data was used in all analyses. Data in all statis-\ntical analyses for our study were weighted to account for the\ncomplex sampling design of both NHANES which were mul-\ntistage, stratified, unequally weighted, or clustered. Appro-\npriate statistical sampling weights from each national dataset\nwere selected as specified by the respective survey. Estimat-\ned frequencies of categorical variables and mean and standard\nerror of continuous variables between the two countries were\ncompared by the chi-square and t-test procedures of SUD-\nAAN. Each national sample weight was applied after data\nfrom the two countries were merged into a single file by cre-\nating a new variable. These statistics were presented as mean\n\u00b1standard error (SE) for continuous variables and frequency\npercentage (SE) for all categorical measures. A P value <0.05\nwas considered statistically significant.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 shows anthropometric and clinical measurements\nfor US and Korean adolescents.

The frequency of hyper-\ntriglyceridemia did not differ between the two countries in\nall weight categories.\nDISCUSSION\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the new\nIDF pediatric definitions of MetS to Korean adolescents. In\nthis study, the prevalences of MetS and obesity in US adoles-\ncents were 5.5% and 18.1%, respectively, which were appro-\nximately double the corresponding prevalences (2.5% and\n9.0%) in Korean adolescents, confirming our first hypothe-\nsis. Despite lifestyle changes such as an increase in energy\nintake and a decrease in physical activity due to rapid eco-\nnomic development and the introduction of western culture\nin Korea, the MetS and obesity in US adolescents is still a\ngreater problem than in Korean adolescents. Our study can-\nnot assert that race itself confers an additional risk beyond\ncultural and environmental factors; therefore, a comprehen-\nsive comparison investigating the relative contribution of\ngenetic, cultural, and environmental factors is needed.\nThe overall prevalence of abdominal obesity in US adoles-\ncents in our study was over four times higher (34.7%) than\nthat of Koreans (8.4%); however, the abdominal obesity preva-\nlence in US and Korean obese adolescents was much closer\n(87.7% vs. 64.9%, respectively). In both countries, the abdom-\ninal obesity prevalence was also found to be the most com-\nmon of the MetS criteria in adolescents in the highest BMI\ncategory. Therefore, obese adolescents with abdominal obe-\nsity should be an important target for intervention in both\ncountries.\nThe difference between the prevalence of abdominal obesi-\nty in US and Korean females was much greater than in males.\nAlthough the differences were not as marked, the opposite\ntrend was seen when assessing obesity by BMI criterion as a\nlarger difference existed between US and Korean males than\nfemales. This dichotomy is not easy to explain. Although fat\nand muscle mass distribution vary according to pubertal sta-\ntus and gender, neither the US NHANES nor KNHANES\nassessed pubertal status. Possible explanations are a gender-\nvariable genetic predisposition to the accumulation of viscer-\nal fat which contributes to abdominal obesity or to the use\nof inappropriate cutoff values for abdominal and overall obe-\nsity by BMI. The visceral fat contribution to total body fat\nas well as pubertal status would be informative additions to\nfuture national surveys, in order that that more detailed hy-\npotheses can be made. Current Korean growth charts include\nPrevalence of Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity 79\nP<0.001 show significant differences between the US and Korea; MetS, Metabolic Syndrome.\nn, sample size (estimated population represented in millions).\nUS\n(normal weight)\n(overweight)\n(obese)\nKorea\n(normal weight)\n(overweight)\n(obese)\nPrevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components\nNumber of metabolic abnormalities\nParameters\nWC while US growth charts do not. Increased awareness of\nthe dangers of abdominal obesity could be facilitated by add-\ning WC to the other growth charts used in the US.\nThe prevalence of hyperglycemia in US adolescents (11.8%)\nwas nearly four times higher than in Koreans (3.0%), but in\nboth countries the prevalence was the lowest for any of the\ncomponents of MetS. The higher prevalence of hyperglycemia\nin US adolescents may be associated with their higher preva-\nlence of obesity. It is known that Asian children have a much\ngreater risk for type 2 diabetes at a relatively low BMI owing\nto their greater abdominal fat distribution compared with\nCaucasian children (16). However, our study showed a lower\nprevalence of hyperglycemia in Korea than in the US in obese\nadolescents. Importantly, neither NHANES nor KNHANES\ndistinguished between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Typically,\na significant percentage of all pediatric diabetics are type 1 (17).\nHypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-C levels are often found\ntogether (18). Our study showed a higher prevalence of hyper-\ntriglyceridemia in the US but a higher prevalence of low\nHDL-C in Korea. Various risk factors for hypertriglyceride-\nmia such as diabetes, obesity, alcohol intake, and a high car-\nbohydrate diet have been reported (19). Increasing preva-\nlences of hypertriglyceridemia and obesity in the US popu-\na shift in consumption from a high fat to a high carbohydrate\ndiet (20). Although little information exists to explain the\nlow HDL-C status in Korean adolescents, we assume adult\nfactors such as obesity, low levels of physical activity, high\nintakes of carbohydrate and fat, snacks, and processed foods,\nas well as genetics are implicated (21). Obesity is related to\nmany types of lipid disorders (8, 22), which can help explain\nthe higher prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia in the US over-\nall as well as similar prevalences in the two countries among\nobese adolescents. Decreased levels of HDL-C in adolescents\nhave been associated with puberty, particularly in males who\nexperience a surge of testosterone (23). Since Tanner staging\nwas not done in either NHANES, it is difficult to determine\nwhether the HDL-C levels were affected by differences in\npubertal development in the two countries. Higher LDL-\nC:HDL-C and TC:HDL-C ratios in Korean adolescents result-\ning from lower HDL-C and higher LDL-C of Koreans sug-\ngest that they have a more unfavorable lipid profile than their\nUS counterparts. These results may indicate an elevated risk\nfor CVD among this cohort of Korean adolescents. Further\nstudy is needed to understand the differences in patterns of\ndyslipidemia between the two countries and long-term con-\nsequences.\nIn our study, the overall prevalence of high blood pressure\ndid not differ significantly between the two countries; how-\never, US adolescents had higher pulse pressures than Korean\nadolescents. Elevated pulse pressure is positively associated\nwith obesity (24); thus, higher pulse pressures in US adoles-\ncents may be related to their higher BMI relative to Korean\nadolescents. Anticipating a rise in the prevalences of CVD in\nyoung adults, Healthy People 2010 emphasized the need to\nmonitor and manage high blood pressure in adolescents (25).\nSome authors have suggested that high blood pressure in\nchildhood and adolescence correlates with insulin level and\ninsulin resistance (26) although inclusion of blood pressure\nas a component of pediatric MetS is still controversial. If a\nmeasurement of insulin levels is added to the KNHANES,\nthe relationship between insulin levels and blood pressure\nin the two countries can be assessed.\nConsensus adolescent MetS criteria have been unavailable\nuntil recently, and thus MetS prevalence estimates vary con-\nsiderably. In US adolescents aged 12-19 yr, the prevalence\nof MetS varied from 2.0-9.6% in recent NHANES studies\n(16, 20). Some studies showed that the overall prevalence of\nMetS in US adolescents was increasing over time (6, 27). On\nthe contrary, Ford et al. (5) reported that the prevalence of\nMetS in adolescents aged 12-17 was relatively stable across\nIDF definition. The prevalence of the MetS in the US was\nhigher in our study (5.5%) than in Ford et al. (5) report pos-\nsibly due to differences in the age range studied. In Korea,\nthere were two studies reporting that the overall prevalence\nCook et al. (7). The prevalence of MetS in males increased\nKNHANES while there was no increase in females (5.1%\nthe NCEP-ATP III-derived definition (28). These differences\nshould be taken into account when making comparisons with\nthese previous studies. Likewise, caution should be used when\ncomparing the prevalence of obesity in our study with previ-\nous reports due to the utilization of different age ranges or\nobesity criteria. A US report showed that the prevalence of\nCharts (29). A Korean report indicates that the prevalence\nof obesity in the10-18 yr old population increased signifi-\nKorea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nreported that the prevalence of obesity in adolescents nearly\non 1998 Korean Growth Charts. Previous studies demon-\nstrated the increasing prevalences of obesity in US (29) and\nKorean (8, 30) adolescents, and it is expected that the preva-\nlence of obesity in both countries will continue to be high\ndespite public health interventions. The trend in the preva-\nlence of adolescent MetS remains controversial (5, 7, 27, 28).\nWe expect that if the prevalence of obesity decreases in both\ncountries, prevalences of MetS will decrease as well. However,\nthe risk factors for MetS and obesity are not identical, and\n80 J. Park, D.C. Hilmers, J.A. Mendoza, et al.\nthe mechanisms underlying the development of MetS are not\nfully understood. The frequencies of adolescents having at\nleast one component of MetS in the obese, overweight, and\npectively in Korea. These findings imply that even adoles-\ncents with normal weight should not be excluded from screen-\ning for MetS.\nAs predicted by our second hypothesis, the most prevalent\nabnormality in each country was also different: abdominal\nobesity in the US and low HDL-C levels in Korea. Prevalences\nof abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia, and hypertriglyceride-\nmia were higher in the US while the prevalence of low HDL-\nC was higher in Korea. Unlike obesity, systematic public\nhealth programs to combat pediatric MetS in each country\nhave not been emphasized. Further research to gain a better\nunderstanding of the genetic and environmental factors res-\nponsible for these differences is needed, and nation-specific\nstrategies such as school-based health examinations and lipid\nscreening should be established.\nOne notable finding is that despite the higher prevalence\nof MetS and obesity in the US, the prevalence of MetS in\nobese US and Korean adolescents did not significantly differ\nabnormalities by BMI percentiles also showed no difference\nbetween the two countries. A number of studies have report-\ned high prevalences of MetS among obese adolescents in the\nagreement with our findings, these studies also reported that\nthe prevalence of MetS in obese adolescents did not largely\ndiffer between the two countries although Koreans had a lower\nBMI and obesity prevalence overall. These results imply that\nobese adolescents have a similar risk of MetS regardless of\nnationality and that the ethnic specific cut-points used in\nthis study for the MetS criteria appropriately identified the\nrisk of MetS across multiple ethnicities.\nOur study had some limitations. First, we cannot identify\nthe extent by which country-specific cut-off points for obe-\nsity and abdominal obesity affect the prevalence of MetS in\neach country. Second, while both surveys used similar anthro-\npometric and laboratory methods, each survey used its own\nreference laboratories to analyze the samples and instruments,\nwhich may contribute to differences in results between coun-\ntries. Third, only subjects who had fasted at least 8 hr prior\nto the blood collection were included in the study. Fourth,\nparticipants were excluded if any of the five components of\nMetS were not measured, which limited our sample size. Final-\nly, Tanner staging was not available which could confound\nthe results, particularly in younger adolescents.\nIn summary, our study compared MetS and its components\nin US and Korean adolescents using the 2007 IDF definition,\nthe first international pediatric criteria. As we hypothesized,\nUS adolescents had nearly twice the prevalence of both MetS\nand obesity. There were also differences in the prevalence of\nindividual abnormalities and the most prevalent abnormali-\nty in each country. The prevalence of MetS in both countries\nwas similar among obese adolescents, a finding that suggests\nthat obese adolescents, regardless of ethnicity, have a similar\nrisk for MetS and that ethnic-specific criteria for defining MetS,\nsuch as the IDF definition, may be most appropriate. Early-\nscreening and focused interventions for MetS and obesity\nshould be priorities in public health planning in both coun-\ntries. Concomitantly, further research should be undertaken\nto investigate the various genetic, cultural, and environmen-\ntal factors underlying the differences between the two coun-\ntries.\nREFERENCES\n1.
