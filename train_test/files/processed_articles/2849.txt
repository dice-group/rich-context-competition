While this stylized fact is widely accepted, the causes for the \"Great\nModeration\" are still the subject of lively debate. The jury is still out on the question\nwhether \"Good Policy\", in particular a more stabilizing monetary policy, or \"Good\nLuck\", i.e. the absence of major shocks, is the main cause of the Great Moderation.\nYet, for individual households, it is the development of volatility at the firm level\nrather than the development of aggregate volatility that matters. If firm level volatility\nincreases, households must find ways to diversify firm level risks and to shield their\nconsumption against income fluctuation. Possibilities for diversification, in turn, depend\non the relative importance of macroeconomic and idiosyncratic factors affecting\nvolatility at the firm level. Idiosyncratic volatility can be diversified in developed\nfinancial markets. Macroeconomic factors, in contrast, affect all firms in a similar\nmanner and can be diversified nationally only to the extent that some firms react\ndifferently to the same macroeconomic shock.\nIn this paper, we thus test whether evidence of a Great Moderation can be found at\nthe firm level. Earlier evidence, which mostly uses US data, has partly conflicting\nresults. In fact, the link between aggregated and firm level volatility is not clear a priori.\nOn the one hand, developments of growth volatility at the aggregate and the firm level\nmight differ if output changes are imperfectly correlated across firms and if these\ncorrelations change over time. On the other hand, aggregate growth rates of GDP can be\nseen as the averaged growth rates across all firms in an economy. This makes\ndifferences in the time series patterns of firm level and aggregated volatility unlikely.\nInstead, volatility at different levels of aggregation moves into the same direction if the\nshares of firms in aggregated output and the responses of firms to macroeconomic\ndevelopments remain relatively stable.\nIn this paper, we go beyond earlier studies by using a comprehensive panel dataset\nfor German firms. These data allow tracking individual firms for a maximum of 35\nyears (1971-2005). Our data come from the Corporate Balance Sheet Statistics and the\nFinancial Statements Data Pool provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank.\nMethodologically, we go beyond earlier literature in two regards. First, we use the\nmultifactor residual model proposed by Pesaran (2006) to isolate the idiosyncratic\ngrowth of firms' sales from macroeconomic factors. We control for observed and\nunobserved macroeconomic developments affecting all firms while allowing for a\nheterogeneous response of firms to these factors. We find that trends in firm level and\naggregate volatility are similar when looking at the unconditional volatility at the firm\nlevel. Controlling for macroeconomic developments, firm level volatility is not only\nlower but also exhibits no downward trend. If anything, there even is some evidence of\na very slow increase in idiosyncratic firm level volatility. Second, we employ panel\nregressions to analyze the determinants of firm level growth volatility. Results show\nthat higher asset growth and lower inventory-sales ratios are associated with a higher\nvolatility of firms' sales.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nSchwankungen des aggregierten Output haben in entwickelten Volkswirtschaften \u00fcber\ndie vergangenen Jahrzehnte hinweg abgenommen. Die Ursachen f\u00fcr diese ,,Great\nModeration\" werden in der Literatur strittig diskutiert. Sowohl eine bessere Geldpolitik\nals auch geringere makro\u00f6konomische Schocks und strukturelle Ver\u00e4nderungen werden\nf\u00fcr diese Entwicklung verantwortlich gemacht.\nF\u00fcr individuelle Haushalte ist hingegen eher die Entwicklung auf Firmen- als auf\nMakroebene relevant.

Inwiefern das m\u00f6glich ist, h\u00e4ngt\nwiederum von den Bestimmungsr\u00fcnden der einzelwirtschaftlichen Volatilit\u00e4t ab. Stehen\nmakro\u00f6konomische Entwicklungen hinter den Schwankungen auf Firmenebene, kann\neine Absicherung von Risiken im nationalen Rahmen nur begrenzt gelingen. Sind\nidiosynkratische, firmenspezifische Schocks ausschlaggebend, besteht hingegen die\nM\u00f6glichkeit zur Diversifizierung auf nationalen Finanzm\u00e4rkten.\nIn diesem Papier untersuchen wir, inwiefern auf Firmenebene ein R\u00fcckgang der\nVolatilit\u00e4t zu verzeichnen ist. Fr\u00fchere Evidenz, die sich vorwiegend auf die USA\nbezieht, kommt hier zu widerspr\u00fcchlichen Aussagen: Grunds\u00e4tzlich ist der\nZusammenhang zwischen der Volatilit\u00e4t auf aggregierter und auf Firmenebene nicht\neindeutig. Einerseits k\u00f6nnen sich die Entwicklungen unterscheiden, wenn die\nWachstumsraten auf Firmenebene unvollst\u00e4ndig miteinander korreliert sind und sich\ndiese Korrelationen \u00fcber die Zeit \u00e4ndern. Andererseits kann das Wachstum auf\naggregierter Ebene als der gewichtete Durchschnitt der Wachstumsraten auf Firmebene\naufgefasst werden. Bleiben die Anteile einzelner Firmen \u00fcber die Zeit hinweg konstant\nund reagieren die Firmen \u00e4hnlich auf makro\u00f6konomische Entwicklungen, sollte sich\nsomit die Entwicklung der Volatilit\u00e4t auf unterschiedlichen Aggregationsebenen nicht\nwesentlich unterscheiden.\nIn diesem Papier nutzen wir Daten f\u00fcr eine repr\u00e4sentative Gruppe deutscher Firmen.\nUnsere Daten erlauben es, eine Gruppe von rund 1.500 Unternehmen \u00fcber einen\nUnternehmensbilanzstatistik und dem Jahresabschlussdatenpool der Deutschen\nBundesbank entnommen.\nIn methodischer Hinsicht gehen wir \u00fcber fr\u00fchere Arbeiten hinaus, indem wir das\nMultifaktormodell von Pesaran (2006) nutzen, um die idiosynkratische Komponente des\nWachstums auf Firmenebene von makro\u00f6konomischen Faktoren zu isolieren. Wir\nber\u00fccksichtigen beobachtete und unbeobachtete makro\u00f6konomische Faktoren und wir\nlassen eine heterogene Reaktion der Unternehmen auf diese Faktoren zu. Unsere\nErgebnisse zeigen, dass Trends in der firmenspezifischen und der aggregierten\nVolatilit\u00e4t \u00e4hnlich sind, wenn nicht um makro\u00f6konomische Faktoren bereinigt wird.\nNachdem wir makro\u00f6konomische Faktoren herausgerechnet haben, findet sich\nallerdings kein starker Trend mehr in der firmen-spezifischen Volatilit\u00e4t: wenn\n\u00fcberhaupt, hat diese \u00fcber die Zeit hinweg leicht zugenommen. Gleichzeitig zeigen diese\nErgebnisse, dass makro\u00f6konomische Faktoren einen starken Einfluss auf die\nEntwicklungen auf Firmenebene haben. In einem zweiten Schritt untersuchen wir die\nDeterminanten der firmenspezifischen Volatilit\u00e4t.

The views\npresented in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the\nDeutsche Bundesbank. All errors and inconsistencies are solely our own responsibility.\nTo date, there is little consensus reached how firm level output volatility has evolved\nover time, let alone the causes for changes in this volatility. For the USA, Comin and\nPhilippon (2005) were the first to claim diverging patterns in firm level and aggregated\noutput volatility. According to their results, firm level output volatility has increased,\nwhereas aggregated output volatility has decreased (see also Comin and Mulani 2006).\nComin et al. (2006) confirm these general patterns in the data and show that output and\nemployment volatility display similar trends. Yet Davis et al. (2006) demonstrate that\nthe finding of an increase in firm level output volatility crucially depends on the sample\nof firms chosen. According to their results, the increase in firm level volatility is a\nfeature of large, publicly traded firms. Using information on privately-owned firms as\nwell, Davis et al. (2006) find a downward trend in firm level volatility for the US,\nmirroring the macro level development.\nEvidence on firm level volatility for non-US countries is scarce (Davis and Kahn\n2007). For France, Thesmar and Thoenig (2004) show an upward trend in firm level\nvolatility. For Germany, patterns at the firm level are similar to those found in\naggregated data, and there is no evidence of an increase in volatility (Buch et al. 2006).1\nIn this paper, we go beyond earlier studies by using a comprehensive panel dataset\nfor German firms. These data allow tracking individual firms for a maximum of 35\nyears (1971-2005). Our data come from the Financial Statements Data Pool and the\nCorporate Balance Sheet Statistics of German firms provided by the Deutsche\nBundesbank.\nMethodologically, we depart from earlier literature in two regards. First, we use the\nmultifactor residual model proposed by Pesaran (2006) to isolate the idiosyncratic\ngrowth of firms' sales from macroeconomic factors. We control for observed and\nunobserved macroeconomic developments affecting all firms while allowing for a\nheterogeneous response of firms to these factors. Our results show that differences\nbetween the unconditional volatility of firms' sales growth and the idiosyncratic,\nconditional volatility are quite substantial. Without distinguishing the micro- and the\nmacro-component, inference about trends in firm level versus aggregate volatility might\nthus be misleading. Second, we employ fixed effects panel regressions as well as the\n1 For evidence on aggregated volatility in Germany see A\u00dfmann et al. (2006) and Buch et al. (2004).\nheteroskedastic regression model proposed by Harvey (1976) to analyze the\ndeterminants of firm level growth volatility. This method has the advantage that we can\nsimultaneously estimate the determinants of the mean and the variance of firms' sales\ngrowth. Moreover, our results do not rely on arbitrary choices of choosing a time\nwindow for the computation of (rolling) volatilities.\nWhy would one expect firm level and aggregated volatility to differ? After all,\naggregate growth rates of GDP can be seen as the averaged growth rates across all firms\nin an economy. Yet, this does not automatically imply that the same trends as in the\nvolatility of GDP growth can be found in firm level data. Instead, developments of\ngrowth volatility at the aggregate level and the firm level might differ if output changes\nare imperfectly correlated across firms (Comin and Phillipon 2005). Patterns of\ncorrelation, in turn, may change due to differences in the process of deregulation across\nsectors, differences in R&D intensities, or different degrees of goods market\ncompetition. Also, advancing financial markets provide better opportunities for risk-\nsharing, which increases the ability of investors to take on risks. Depending on the\ndegree of information asymmetries at the firm level, different firms might be affected\ndifferently. These arguments suggest that studying the development of aggregated\nvolatility only may mask diverging trends at the firm level.\nDavis et al. (2006), in contrast, argue that differences in the time series patterns of\nfirm level and aggregated volatility are unlikely. They argue that volatility at different\nlevel of aggregation moves into the same direction if the shares of firms in aggregated\noutput and the responses of firms to macroeconomic developments remain relatively\nstable.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In Part 2, we provide a brief theoretical\nbackground. In Parts 3 and 4, we describe our data and our empirical model. In Part 5,\nwe use this model to decompose firms' growth rates into the idiosyncratic component\nand the component driven by macroeconomic factors, and we analyze the determinants\nof firm level growth volatility. Part 6 concludes. We find that trends in firm level and\naggregate volatility are similar when looking at the unconditional volatility at the firm\nlevel. This supports the view of Davis et al. (2006). Controlling for macroeconomic\ndevelopments, we find that firm level volatility is not only lower but also exhibits no\ndownward trend. In fact, there even is some evidence of a very slow increase in\nidiosyncratic firm level volatility, supporting the view of Comin and Phillipon (2005).\nWe also investigate the determinants of idiosyncratic volatility and find higher asset\ngrowth and lower inventory-sales ratios to be associated with a higher volatility of\nfirms' sales. Leverage has no significant impact.\n2 Theoretical Background\nIn order to understand how firm level and aggregate volatility develop \u00ad and why\ntime trends might differ \u00ad a theoretical framework which departs from the assumption\nof symmetric, homogenous firms is required. Using a standard Dixit-Stiglitz-type\nspecification of household preferences, it can be shown that firm level prices and output\ndepend on firm level and macroeconomic factors alike. As shown in Woodford (2003:\nChapter 3), the first-order condition for the optimal pricing strategy of the supplier of\ngood i is then given by:\n \n,\n,\n;\n,\n,\nit\nt\nt\nt\nI\nt\nt\nY\nP\np\ni\np [\nwhere is the first derivative of the firm i's profit function,\ni\npt\nis the price\ncharged for good i, I\nt\np is an index of the price charged in industry I to which firm i\nbelongs, t\nP is the economy-wide price index, t\nY is an index of aggregate demand, t\n[ is\na vector of exogenous macroeconomic disturbances, and it\n[ is a vector of firm-specific\ndisturbances. According to equation (1), a firm's profit maximum with the\ncorresponding prices and quantities depends on firm-specific, industry-specific, and\nmacroeconomic developments. These variables, by definition, also have an impact on\nthe volatility of firm level variables.\nEquation (1) also implies that trends in the volatility of firm-specific and\nmacroeconomic factors might differ if t\n[ and it\n[ exhibit different time trends or if the\npropagation channels between micro- and macroeconomic developments change\nsystematically over time. Focusing on the micro-economic determinants of firm level\nvolatility, we can think of four main reasons why volatility may change over time.\nFirst, the process of financial market deregulation and integration may provide better\nrisk-sharing possibilities for investors. Hence, ceteris paribus, more risky firms may be\nable to obtain external finance, thus raising the average risk and volatility of firms.\nThesmar and Thoenig (2004) find evidence for France supporting the hypothesis that\nthe financial market deregulation has contributed to an increase in firm level output\nvolatility. We will account for the importance of financial frictions by including the\nleverage ratio of firms.\nSecond, greater exposure to international competition and the deregulation of product\nmarkets may increase the elasticity of demand that firms are facing. This could change\nthe responsiveness of firms to a given shock.2\nThird, changes in the process of productivity growth away from the imitation of\nexisting technologies towards innovative research and development may increase\nvolatility. Eichengreen (2007), for instance, notes that, up until roughly the 1970s,\ngrowth in Europe was characterized by a catching up process to the technological\nfrontier whereas in later decades innovative R&D started to dominate.\nFourth, new information technologies have helped firms to improve their inventory\nmanagement. During the \"Great Moderation\", output volatility fell further than final\nsales volatility (Davis and Kahn 2007). This implies a change in the behavior of\ninventories in terms of lower volatility of inventories and/or a change in the covariance\nbetween inventories and sales. In our empirical analysis below, we will look at the\nvolatility of real sales rather than output. From a theoretical point of view, we would\nexpect inventories to be used to smoothen production when shocks to firms' sales\ndominate (Hornstein 1998). If productivity shocks dominate, in contrast, inventories are\nused to stabilize sales. Hence, we use firm level information on the inventory-sales ratio\nto account for the fact that inventories should be adjusted counter-cyclically with regard\nto fluctuations in real sales.\nOur data are not rich enough to study the importance of all of these factors. However,\nwe will show trends in the data and model the determinants of volatility as closely as\nSee Rodrik (1997) for a related argument as to why labor market volatility may increase in integrated\nmarkets.\npossible to the above hypotheses. Our focus is on isolating micro factors and macro\nfactors contributing to changes in firm level volatility.\n3 Data and Descriptive Statistics\nTo document long-run trends in firm level volatility, we exploit, for the first time, a\nnew firm level dataset that links two datasets available at the Deutsche Bundesbank: the\nCorporate Balance Sheets Statistics (Unternehmensbilanzstatistik), which covers the\n(Jahresabschlussdatenpool), which starts in 1997. (For methodological changes, see\nDeutsche Bundesbank (2005, 2006).) Earlier research was restricted to either of these\nstatistics. For example, the Corporate Balance Sheets Statistics were used to trace the\ndynamics of firms over the cycle (D\u00f6pke and Weber 2006). The Financial Statements\nData Pool was used to exploit the cross-section dimensions to analyze the link between\nThe Financial Statements Data Pool replaces the Corporate Balance Sheets Statistics\nof the Deutsche Bundesbank, as the number of corporate annual financial statements\nbeing submitted to the Bundesbank declined after the launch of the European Monetary\nUnion in 1999 and the subsequent discontinuation of the Bundesbank's rediscount\nbusiness. It has been compiled in a joint project of the Bundesbank and a number of\ncommercial banks and other financial institutions. The Financial Statements Data Pool\nis somewhat broader than the Corporate Balance Sheet Statistics. The firms represented\nabout three-quarters of the gross value added of the non-financial business sector in\nstatistical purposes, but under strict confidentiality on the premises of the Bundesbank\nonly. The data have been made anonymous, and only Bundesbank staff is allowed to\nwork with the Financial Statements Data Pool.\nThe total time series dimension of our new, linked data set covers 35 years (1971-\n2005). The unit of observation is the individual firm. Generally, our dataset contains\ninformation on all balance sheet items and financial statements. Since we are interested\nin tracking the evolution of a large number of firms over a long time horizon, we\nretrieve information on firms' sales, assets, the legal form, the industry, and some key\nfirm level control variables only. We use the following firm level variables:\no (Real) sales: Like Comin and Phillipon (2005) or Davis et al. (2006), we use real\nsales as a proxy for firm level output. For this variable, we have relatively few\ndata losses owing to incomplete and inconsistent reporting. Developments of sales\nand output differ in that the inventory growth and sales growth are imperfectly\ncorrelated. We use sales in order to avoid a possible bias arising from the fact that\nwe have only balance sheet data on inventories. Lacking information on firm level\nprices, we convert nominal variables into real variables by deflating each firm's\nsales with the industry-level price index obtained from the EU KLEMS database\n(see www.euklems.net) and taking the difference of the logarithm of real sales.\no Assets: Total assets of firms, deflated with the same price index as firms' sales, are\nused as a proxy for the size of firms. The advantage of this measure over size\nmeasures such as the stock of fixed assets, equity capital, or external debt, is that\nit is not influenced by differences in the financing structure or the asset structure\nof firms. Also, total assets are a stock measure of firm size, which is likely to\nfluctuate less over time than sales as a flow measure.\no Inventories: We include the inventory-sales ratio to capture possible effects of\ntechnological changes on the volatility of firms' sales. This also takes into account\nthat sales are an imperfect proxy of output if inventories change.\no Leverage: We compute a measure of leverage as a firm's debt divided by total\nequity. Leverage could be one measure of credit market friction. From a\ntheoretical point of view, we expect that more severe financial friction reduce\ngrowth and increase the volatility of investment (Aghion and Banerjee 2005).\nAccordingly, the expected sign of leverage would be negative.3\nperiod. The unrestricted dataset has 2.8 million firm-year observations. The average\nduration in the panel is about 13 years per firm. Since our empirical method, which will\nbe explained in more detail below, is partly based on time series regressions for each\n3 Note that information on leverage is not available for a number of firms, which reduces the size of our\nsample from about 1,750 to 1,450 firms. However, the qualitative results that are reported in the\nfollowing also hold for the larger panel.\nindividual firm, we retain only those firms which are present in the dataset for the full\nperiod. This reduces the total number of firms contained in the sample to 1,464 firms or\nIn the appendix, the distribution of the unrestricted sample (i.e. the unbalanced panel)\nby the number of firms and the volume of real sales by industry (Table 1a) and years\n(Table 1b) is given. We also provide comparative evidence of the balanced panel.\nOne particularly interesting feature of our dataset is that it contains information on\nmanufacturing and services firms. In terms of the volume of sales, services account for\nroughly 19% of sales in the balanced panel. The bulk of these sales (13%) is in the\nwholesale trade sector. In the unbalanced panel, the largest sector is wholesale trade as\nwell, accounting for about 24% of total in terms of sales. The share of the wholesale\ntrade sector is even higher in terms of the number of firms (21% in the unbalanced\npanel and 29% in the balanced panel). These numbers are out of proportion to the\nimportance of this sector for GDP since we refer to sales rather than to value added.\nNone of the remaining sectors dominates as clearly. As regards the number of firms, the\nbasic metals sector (11.6%) ranks second, and machinery and equipment (10.7%) ranks\nthird. In terms of the volume of real sales, the largest sector is petroleum products\nA comparison of the structure of the balanced panel and the unbalanced panel shows\nthat firms from manufacturing sectors are overrepresented and services firms are\nunderrepresented in the balanced panel. This is not surprising since the balanced panel\nfavors firms which had taken part in the Bundesbank's rediscount business. At the same\ntime, this makes our findings robust to structural changes (see, e.g., Parker 2007). The\ndisadvantage, of course, is that the inflow of younger and presumably riskier firms into\nthe sample as well as the exit of high volatility firms is not captured. In Section 5.3\nbelow, we discuss different sample splits, which take into account that the survivorship\nbias might differ across firms of different sectors, size, or legal status. Table 1b shows\nthe allocation of firms over the years. Here, the selection bias due to our restriction on a\nbalanced panel is less severe, as we have about 3% of all observations in each year in\nboth samples.\n3.2 Computing Firm Level Volatility\nAs a first step towards computing firm level volatility, we compute firms' growth\nrates as\n\n\n\nit\nit\nit\nit y\ny\ny\nwhere it\ng is firm i's sales growth rate, and it\ny are firm i's real sales in t. Since our\ndata contain no information on reasons for large outliers such as mergers and\nacquisitions, we drop observations which fall by more than half or more than double.\nThe same restriction is applied to the growth rate of assets. Moreover, observations are\nexcluded if leverage is larger than 100. Table 2a in the appendix shows the descriptive\nstatistics. The mean firm level growth rate for the full sample is 3.6%, which is slightly\nhigher than the growth rate of real GDP (2.2%).\nAs regards the measurement of volatility, it has become relatively standard in the\nliterature to compute growth volatility as the standard deviation in growth rates over a\nmoving 5-year or 10-year window (see, e.g., Comin and Phillipon 2006, Davis et al.\n2006). The volatility of real sales over a 10-year window is thus defined as:\n/\n,\n\u00bb\n\u00bc\n\u00ba\n\u00ab\n\u00ac\n\u00aa\n\n\u00a6\n\n\nW\nW\nV\nit\nt\ni\nit\ng\ng\nwhere it\ng measures the mean growth rate. Correspondingly, the volatility over a 5-\nyear window  \ny\nit\nV uses observations ranging from t = -4 to t = 0.\nGraph 1 (see the appendix) plots the mean, unconditional firm level volatility of sales\ngrowth against the volatility of the growth rate of GDP. The unconditional volatility has\nnot been corrected for macroeconomic influences. The median standard deviation of\nfirm level growth is about 12%, which is comparable to evidence found in earlier\nvolatility of aggregated GDP. Graph 1 shows that the time trends are quite similar and\nshare two main features. First, there has been a trend decline in volatility over time.\nSecond, volatility was temporarily higher in the period following German unification in\nthe early 1990s. These general patterns in the data are very similar when using the\nunbalanced panel of firms.\nThe information in Graph 1 alone, however, says little about time trends in the\nidiosyncratic volatility of firms' growth volatility though. We will therefore describe the\nmethodology, in the following, how we isolate microeconomic factors from\nmacroeconomic factors affecting firm level volatility.\n4 Computing Idiosyncratic Firm Level Volatility\nPrevious empirical work on the determinants of firm level volatility uses the\nvolatility of output as given by equation (3) as the dependent variable. Such regressions\nsuffer from three potential problems. First, by construction, the dependent variable is\nserially correlated. Second, the choice of the 5-year or 10-year window for the\ncomputation of volatility is somewhat arbitrary, although it is often used in the\nempirical literature. Third, using the unconditional firm level volatility does not allow\ndistinguishing idiosyncratic, firm level, from macroeconomic factors. The parallel\nevolution of firm level and aggregated volatility documented in Graph 1 could be the\nresult of similar developments at different levels of aggregation, but it could also cloud\ndiverging patterns at the firm level. Simply including observable macroeconomic\nvolatilities as regressors may not fully isolate the idiosyncratic component because only\nobserved factors are included. Also, in a pooled regression, the impact of\nmacroeconomic factors is assumed to be homogenous across firms.\nHence, in this section, we describe the multifactor residual model recently proposed\nby Pesaran (2006). This model allows us to filter observed and unobserved\nmacroeconomic factors out of the firm level data. It provides us with a measure of the\nconditional, idiosyncratic firm level real sales growth. To see the logic of the\nmultifactor residual model, assume that firm level sales growth is given by\nit\nit\ni\nt\ni\nit\nx\nd\ng H\nE\nD \n '\nwhere N\ni ,...,\n,\n1 is the number of firms and T\nt ,...,\n,\n1 the number of years.\nD and E are parameters to be estimated. Equation (4) states that firm level growth\ndepends on a 1\nu\nk vector of observable macroeconomic factors ( t\nd ) and a vector of\nobserved firm-specific regressors ( it\nx ). The errors are assumed to have a multifactor\nstructure:\nit\nt\ni\nit\nu\nf \n'\nJ\nwhere t\nu\nm vector of unobserved macroeconomic factors and it\nu the\nindividual-specific (idiosyncratic) errors, which are assumed to be distributed\nindependently of t\nd and it\nx . In Pesaran (2006), the observed and unobserved factors t\nd\nand t\nf are assumed to be covariance stationary. Generally, the unobserved factors can\nbe correlated with ( t\nd , it\nx ); the individual-specific regressors are modelled according\nto:\nit\nt\ni\nt\ni\nit\nv\nf\nd\nA\nx \n*\n '\nwhere i\nA and i\n* are factor loading matrices and it\nv those components of it\nx which\nare independent of the macroeconomic factors.\nIn most applications, the interest is in the slope coefficients i\nE in equation (4). The\nfactor loadings i\nD and i\nJ are not the main interest, but they can be estimated\nconsistently when both N and T are large. Since our panel has a time series dimension of\nT = 35, we can analyze the firm level responses to the macroeconomic factors.\nHowever, our main interest is in the variance of the idiosyncratic term it\nu . With an\nestimate of it\nu at hand, we can compute the variance of the idiosyncratic component of\nfirm level growth for each firm i. This variance can be proxied through the variance of\nthe first-stage residuals: i\nu\nT\nT\nj\nj\nT\nit\n\n\n\u00a6 \n\n^\n, which converges to  \n\u00a6 \n\n\nT\nj\nj\nT\nit\nu\nV .\n(See e.g. Gorbachev (2007) for a similar specification using household consumption\ndata.)\nThe key challenge is to isolate developments at the firm level from aggregate\ndevelopments while taking into account the fact that some of the macroeconomic\nfactors affecting all firms alike are unobserved. Hence, we isolate factors which affect\nall firms ( t\nd , t\nf ) from those firm-specific variables, which are independent from the\nmacroeconomic factors, i.e. the residual of equation (6) ( it\nv ). We perform this\ndecomposition in two steps.\nIn a first step, we run time-series regressions for sales growth of each firm in the\nsample on observed and unobserved macroeconomic factors. Following Pesaran (2006),\nthe unobserved macroeconomic factors can be proxied through the sample means of\nfirm-specific variables. We therefore take advantage of the fact that the model described\nby equations (4)-(6) is quite general as it allows the unobserved common factors t\nf to\nbe correlated with the individual-specific regressors it\nx via a multifactor structure with\nheterogeneous factor loadings over the cross-section units. We run these regressions for\neach of the firms in our balanced panel and for each of the firm level variables\nseparately and retain the residuals from these regressions.4\nIn a second step, we use the squared residuals from these time series regressions,\nwhich are the growth rates of firm level variables cleaned of the observed and\nunobserved factors, in a pooled firm level panel regression:\nit\nl\ns\nt\ni\nit\nit\nv\nu K\nG\nD\nG\nD\nG\nD\nG\nD\nD\nD \n\n\n\n\n\n'\n'\n'\nwhere is the squared residual of the first-stage regression of sales growth on\nmacroeconomic factors,\nit\nu\nl\ns\nt\ni\nG\nG\nG\nG ,\n,\n, are firm-, time-, sector-, and legal fixed effects,\nand is a set of firm-specific regressors, i.e. the first-stage residuals from equation\n(6). We use time fixed effects as a general specification of the time trend as well as a\nlinear time trend. Note that the time trend also captures the fact that firm level volatility\nis related to firm age. Typically, older and more established firms are less volatile than\nyounger firms. Taken in isolation, this should lead to a negative impact of the time trend\non volatility but, of course, the trend also captures other factors that vary systematically\nover time.\nit\nv\nTo check whether there is a time trend in the variance of the idiosyncratic,\nconditional firm level growth rates, we also use graphical as well as regression-based\nevidence. We employ equation (3) above and compute the rolling standard deviation of\n4Note that the individual-specific coefficients are consistently estimated. They are also asymptotically\nunbiased for f\no\nN for both T fixed and f\no\nT as long as the rank condition concerning the\nfactor loadings is satisfied (Pesaran 2006).\nthe idiosyncratic volatility. In addition, we use fixed effects panel regressions and the\nheteroskedastic regression model suggested by Harvey (1976) to check whether the\nsquared residuals as a proxy for the idiosyncratic volatility of firm level sales growth\nfollow a systematic process. Note that the first-stage regressions account for the\nobserved and unobserved macroeconomic factors in the mean growth of firm level\nsales. This does not preclude finding that macroeconomic factors and time trends to\nhave an impact on the idiosyncratic variance of firm level growth.\n5 Decomposing and Explaining Firm Level Volatility\nResults for the unconditional volatility of firm level sales growth reported in Graph 1\nprovide evidence of a decline in firm level volatility, which largely resembles the drop\nin macroeconomic volatility. To what extent does this decline in firm level volatility\nresult from lower volatility at the macro-level and to what extent does it reflect smaller\nidiosyncratic volatility? In this section, we report the results of the first- and second-\nstage regressions described above.\n5.1 First-Stage Regression: Decomposing Firm Level Volatility\nThe goal of the first-stage regressions is to clean the growth of firm level variables of\nobserved and unobserved macroeconomic factors. Our set of observed macroeconomic\nfactors includes domestic and foreign as well as price and quantity measures. To capture\nthe domestic macroeconomic environment, we include the growth rate of domestic\nabsorption, short-term interest rates, and domestic inflation. To capture the international\nmacroeconomic environment, we include the annual changes in the real exchange rate,\nworld demand, and raw material prices. (Details on the data definitions are given in the\nAppendix.)\nTable 2a in the appendix reports the growth rate of other macroeconomic factors, i.e.\ndomestic real absorption (mean growth rate of 1.9%), world import volume (4.0%), raw\nmaterial prices (6.7%), and the real effective exchange rate of the German economy\nagainst its 23 most important trading partners (-0.1%). An increase in this indicator\nimplies a real appreciation. The average short-term interest rate and the inflation rate\nover this period were 5.7% and 2.7%, respectively.\nWe use four means of firm-specific variables as proxies for unobserved\nmacroeconomic factors. The mean growth rate of firms' sales captures structural shifts\nin firm level growth. The growth rate of firms' assets captures changes in the size\nstructure of firms. The mean inventory-sales ratio captures changes in the importance of\ninventories due to technological progress, and mean leverage across firms captures\nchanging financial frictions. As expected, the inventory-sales ratio shows a downward\ntrend over time, reflecting improvements in inventory management. Leverage, in\ncontrast, has been increasing up until the early 1990s and falling thereafter, reflecting\nlegislative changes affecting the financing of firms in Germany as well as the increase\nin stock market valuation during the 1990s.\nTable 2b in the appendix shows the correlations between the observed macro-factors\nand the unobserved factors. All correlations are below 0.9, and most are below 0.5. We\nfind the highest correlations between GDP growth and the growth rate of domestic\nabsorption as well as between some firm level variables. Since domestic absorption is\nless correlated with the mean firm level factors than GDP growth, we use domestic\nabsorption as our domestic demand component. In addition, the changes in the real\nexchange rate and in world imports as well as the interest rate and inflation show\nrelatively high pairwise correlations. The same holds for the mean firm level variables.\nHowever, we include a full set of observed and unobserved macro-factors as these may\nstill pick up some orthogonal component of the macroeconomic environment.\nThe advantage of running the first-stage regressions firm-by-firm is that we allow for\nthe largest possible heterogeneity across firms. At the same time, results of these\nregressions are difficult to visualize. Therefore, we regress the firm level coefficients\nobtained from the time series regressions on a set of dummy variables. To account for\nthe fact that the coefficients are measured with uncertainty, we weight these\nobservations with the inverse of their standard deviation.\nThe aim of this exercise is to see whether, for instance, large and small firms react\ndifferently to the macroeconomic environment. Results reported in Table 3 (see the\nappendix) show some differences in the response of firms to macroeconomic factors.\nGenerally, larger firms grow faster than smaller firms when domestic and world market\ndemand increases and the real exchange rate appreciates. Also, an increase in raw\nmaterials prices and in the real interest rate increases the growth of large firms relative\nto that of small firms. This would be consistent with large firms being oriented more\ntowards the international market and less affected by financial constraints. Listed firms,\nin contrast, do not differ significantly from the rest of the sample. An increase in the\nreal interest rate lowers growth of firms in the sectors manufacturing, services, and\nconstruction in comparison to growth in the remaining sectors (agriculture, mining,\nenergy). Higher world import demand increases growth in the manufacturing and\nconstruction sector, while higher raw materials prices lower growth in manufacturing\nand services.\nTo assess the importance of the macroeconomic factors for firm level sales growth,\nwe also compute the partial R\u00b2s for these factors. This partial R\u00b2 indicates how much a\nparticular macroeconomic factor contributes to explaining the variance of firm level\nsales growth.\nOn average, the macroeconomic factors individually explain about 5-6% of the\nvariance in sales growth across firms (Table 2c). However, the explanatory power\nvaries widely with the highest partial R\u00b2s being in the range of 0.45 for domestic\nabsorption and 0.59 for the real exchange rate. Hence, for some of the firms in the\nsample, individual macroeconomic factors explain more than 50% of the variance in\nreal sales over time.\nGenerally, the exact specification of the first-stage regressions should not be\noveremphasized. Essentially, these regressions serve the purpose of filtering\nmacroeconomic information out of the firm level time series and to retain the\nidiosyncratic component of sales growth. In this sense, they are similar to the mean\nequations in an ARCH or GARCH setting, which serve the purpose of providing an\nestimate of the variance of the variable at hand.\nThe most interesting outcome of the first-stage regressions are perhaps the plots of\nthe residual standard deviations. Graph 2 in the appendix shows the conditional\nvolatility of firms' sales growth. As before, we use a 5-year rolling window. There are\ntwo striking observations that immediately meet the eye.\nFirst, the conditional firm level volatility is substantially lower than the\nunconditional volatility. During the turbulent 1970s, in particular, macroeconomic\nfactors accounted for more than 50% of the volatility of firm level sales growth. In\nsubsequent periods, the importance of macroeconomic factors has been less\npronounced, but the gap between the conditional and the unconditional volatility series\nwas still substantial. Hence, even though the impact of individual macroeconomic\nfactors on firm level sales growth has, on average, been small, the overall impact of the\nmacro-economy on firm level developments has been quite substantial.\nSecond, the downward trend in firm level volatility reported in Graph 1 is not visible\nonce macroeconomic factors are taken into consideration. Instead, the time profile of\nfirm level volatility is rather flat and even shows a slight upward trend. In this sense,\nour results confirm the conclusion reached by Davis et al. (2006) that (unconditional)\nfirm level and aggregate volatility can be expected to behave similarly. However, our\nfindings for the conditional volatility are also consistent with Comin and Phillipon\n(2006) who argue that the time trends of aggregate and firm level volatility differ.\n5.2 Second-Stage Regressions: Explaining the Volatility of Sales Growth\nWhich are the firm-specific factors that determine the volatility of growth at the firm\nlevel? Do size and sector effects matter? Do we find support for different hypothesis as\nto the causes of the Great Moderation at the firm level? These are questions we will\nnow turn to.\nIn Table 4 (see the appendix), we report results of firm level regressions using the\nsquared residuals of the first-stage regressions as a measure of the volatility of the\nconditional firm level growth rates of sales as a dependent variable (cf. equation (7)).\nWe use fixed-effects panel regressions with robust standard errors. In contrast to the\nfirst-stage regressions, we now estimate homogenous coefficients.\nGenerally, our model explains less than 5% of the variation in the volatility of sales\ngrowth across firms. In similar (unreported) regressions using the growth rate of firms'\nsales as a dependent variable, we obtain higher R\u00b2s ranging from 0.13 to 0.19. It does\nnot come as a surprise to find that the explanatory power of the idiosyncratic, firm level\nvolatility is relatively low, since we have stripped the variables off macroeconomic\ndevelopments and since we consider only the idiosyncratic variation in the data.\nMoreover, these results are strongly driven by the very large amount of cross-sectional\nheterogeneity, which is typical for large micro-data sets like the one at hand.\n(Gorbachev (2007), for instance, analyzes the determinants of household-level\nconsumption risk for the US and reports R\u00b2s in a similar range.)\nWe find a very consistent pattern of sales volatility to be positively related to growth\nof total assets. The estimated coefficient is about 0.03, and it is quite robust across\ndifferent specifications with regard to other control variables and the inclusion of fixed\neffects. Moreover, the impact of asset growth on firm level volatility builds up gradually\nover time. We include up to three lags of asset growth, and the first lag is significant\nthroughout. In terms of economic significance, asset growth is the most important\nvariable, with a beta coefficient of 8%. Hence, variation in sales growth across firms\naccounts for about 8% in the variation of volatility across firms.\nThe finding that faster-growing firms also have more volatile sales growth is\nconsistent with earlier findings at the firm level or industry level concerning the growth-\nvolatility nexus. It is at odds with some findings for a negative relationship between\ngrowth and volatility using aggregated data. However, it would not come as a surprise\nto find that the growth rates of firms are imperfectly correlated. Imbs (2007), for\nexample, shows that the correlation between growth and volatility depends on the level\nof aggregation of the data. He finds a positive correlation between growth and volatility\nat the industry level. One explanation is that growth rates are imperfectly correlated\nacross sectors. Our firm level data suggest a similar positive relationship.\nFirms with a high inventory-sales ratio have a low volatility of real sales. The beta\ncoefficient is \u00ad1.3%. Leverage as a measure of the financial constraints that firms are\nfacing is insignificant, in contrast. At first sight, the negative coefficient on inventories\nseems at odds with the hypothesis that improved inventory management helps firms to\nreduce the volatility of sales. According to this explanation, technological innovations\nhelp firms to reduce the desired inventory-sales ratio. A lower inventory-sales ratio, in\nturn, would weaken the destabilizing, pro-cyclical impact that inventories have for final\nsales via a positive covariance between inventories and sales (Ramey and Vine 2004).\nOur results would be consistent though with inventories serving as a buffer against\nproductivity shocks. According to this interpretation, higher inventory-sales ratios\nwould smoothen the impact of volatile production on sales.\nGenerally, however, standard models of inventory management often fail to find\nsupport in the macro-data. Prominent theories such as the production smoothing model\n(Holt et al. 1960) predict a negative correlation between inventory investment and\noverall production, which was not found in the data. (See Blinder (1986) and the\nliterature cited therein.) Rather, most macro studies find a positive correlation between\ninventory investment and GDP. Possible explanations of these findings point, inter alia,\nto the fact that inventories are still treated at a too aggregated level. In particular, a\ndistinction between inventories of inputs and the inventories of finished goods is\nwarranted. However, we lack such information in our dataset.\nTo test whether there are time trends in firm level volatility, we include a time trend\nand a unification dummy. The unification dummy and the time trend are insignificant if\nlagged dynamics are accounted for. This shows that our macroeconomic factors have\nfiltered out impacts of the unification process on firm level volatility. The time trend is\nsignificant but relatively small, thus indicating only a relatively slow increase in\nvolatility. Moreover, the beta coefficient is only 0.26%. In contrast to unconditional\nfirm level volatility and aggregated volatility, the idiosyncratic volatility of firms has\nthus been on a slow trend rise.\nIn unreported regressions, we include a full set of time-fixed effects as a more\nflexible way to capture time trends in the data. Results for the remaining control\nvariables are unchanged. We also interact the time trend with a dummy variable for\nlisted firms to test the hypothesis put forward by Davis et al. (2006) that firm level\nvolatility has increased because of an upward trend in the volatility of large, publicly\nlisted firms. However, this interaction term is insignificant.\n5.3 Robustness and Selection Issues\nTo check the robustness of our results, we split the sample along different\ndimensions, we use a heteroskedastic regression model to simultaneously model the\nmean and the variance of idiosyncratic sales growth, and we correct for the bias arising\nfrom the fact that we estimate our model on a reduced sample of firms.\nSample splits: The descriptive statistics reported in Tables 1a and 1b show\ndifferences between the full and the reduced sample. Hence, sample selection may\naffect our results since only firms which have data for the full sample are included. This\nsample selection could affect our results if the residuals from the regression of the\ndeterminants of firm level output volatility were correlated with residuals from a latent\nregression determining the survival of firms. These survival probabilities, in turn, may\nbe related to firm size, the sector in which firms are active, or access to the capital\nmarket. To account for such differences, we split the sample into manufacturing and\nservices, listed and unlisted, and small and large firms (Table 4a). The cut-off for small\nand large firms is the median level of real sales. To test whether time trends in firm\nlevel volatility have changed over time, we break down the sample further into the\nin 1985, the year which is often taken as the start of the Great Moderation period.\nPerhaps the most interesting finding is that the qualitative results for the control\nvariables are generally not affected by the different sample compositions. There are a\nfew exceptions though. In the 1970s, none of our control variables is significant.\nInstead, there has been a positive and significant upward time trend in firm level\nvolatility. Moreover, the inventory-sales ratio is insignificant for the sub-samples of\nlisted firms (although the negative sign is retained). Inventories have a negative and\nsignificant effect for services firms, which would seem surprising for services which are\nnon-storable. However, since the sector \"services\" also includes retail and wholesale\ntrade firms and since these firms carry inventories, this effect seems quite plausible.\nSelection bias: In unreported regressions, we have also estimated the volatility\nregression applying the correction for sample selection proposed by Heckman (1976).\nThe selection equation shows that large firms, firms with lower sales growth, and firms\nwith lower leverage are more likely to be in the balanced panel. The Mills ratio is\nsignificant, indicating that sample selection is indeed an issue. Results for the equation\nexplaining the volatility of firm level output show very similar results with regard to the\ncoefficient estimates and significance as regressions not accounting for the selection\nbias. More specifically, firms that grow faster, that have a higher inventory sales ratio,\nand that have lower leverage have a lower volatility. The linear time trend is again\npositive and significant.\nHeteroskedastic regression model: To check the robustness of our results for the\nvariance equation, we alternatively use a regression model with multiplicative\nheteroskedasticity as proposed by Harvey (1976). The advantage of this model is that\nwe can simultaneously specify a \"mean\" equation \u00ad explaining the growth of sales \u00ad as\nwell as a \"variance\" equation \u00ad explaining the residual variance.\nThe heteroskedastic regression model has, to the best of our knowledge, not been\napplied to an analysis of firm level volatility so far. Earlier applications use it to model\nheteroskedasticity in the residuals, yet most papers do not focus on estimates of the\nvariance equation. There are two exceptions. A recent paper by Cerqueiro et al. (2007)\nstudies banks' loan pricing decisions. Ang and Peterson (1985) estimate a capital asset\npricing model and study the determinants of rates of returns as well as the variance of\nreturns.\nThe mean equation of the heteroskedastic regression model gives the level of sales\ngrowth as a function of a set of explanatory variables X: it\nit\nit\nx\ng H\nE \n'\n~\n~ where it\nH is\nthe residual with > @ 0\n~\n| it\nit\nx\nE H and > @ ^ `\nI\nV\nH\nij\nit\nit\nit\nZ\nx\nexp\n~\n| 2 . The variance\nequation is given by I\nV\nit\nit\nZ'\n2 . The coefficients E and I can be obtained by\nmaximizing the log-likelihood function. One advantage of this methodology is that the\nparameters of the mean and of the variance equation are uncorrelated. We essentially\nestimate the same model as before but we now include dummies for the different types\nof firms (large versus small, listed versus unlisted) in lieu of a full set of firm fixed\neffects.\nResults are reported in Table 5 (see the appendix). Turning to the results of the mean\nequation first, we find that asset growth is positively correlated with the growth rate of\nfirm level sales. There is evidence that larger firms grow faster than average. Large\ninventory-sales ratios are associated with lower sales growth, indicating that inventories\ncontain mainly finished products. Since the specification of the mean equation is\ncertainly a bit ad hoc, we also use a specification using a linear time trend and the\nunification dummy only.\nThe results for the variance equation by and large confirm the findings reported\nabove considering the positive impact of higher asset growth and the positive impact of\nthe time trend. The firm size dummy is negative and significant. The negative impact of\nthe inventory-sales ratio is significant only in the specification using a very lean\nspecification of the mean equation (Column 2 of Table 5).\n6 Summary and Conclusions\nThis paper has tested whether evidence of a \"Great Moderation\" can be found in firm\nlevel data of German firms. To answer this question, we have used a unique firm level\ndataset which allows a large sample of German firms to be tracked across 35 years. Our\npaper has three main findings.\nFirst, the unconditional firm level volatility and aggregate volatility have developed\nquite similarly. This confirms Davis et al. (2006) who use US data and differs from the\nfindings of Comin and Phillipon (2005) who find diverging trends of firm level and\naggregated volatility.\nSecond, we show that inference about the evolution of firm level volatility requires\nus to take account of macroeconomic factors. Using the multifactor panel model\nproposed by Pesaran (2006), we have decomposed firm level sales growth and volatility\ninto the idiosyncratic component and the component driven by observed and\nunobserved macroeconomic developments. Results from this disaggregation show that\nthe overall time trends in unconditional firm level volatility are driven by\nmacroeconomic factors. Once we take this into account and extract the idiosyncratic\ncomponent of firm level volatility, we not only find volatility to be lower but also to\nexhibit a flat and, if anything, slightly increasing pattern.\nThird, we use different panel models to analyze the determinants of the idiosyncratic\ncomponent of firm level volatility. Faster-growing firms also exhibit a higher volatility\nof real sales growth. In this sense, higher idiosyncratic volatility could have a positive\nimpact on overall growth and thus economic welfare. If anything, the time trend in firm\nlevel volatility has been positive. However, the time trend explains only a very small\nshare of the variation in idiosyncratic volatility across firms and time.\nOur results show the importance of a stable macroeconomic environment for firm\nlevel stability. High macroeconomic volatility such as was observed during the 1970s\nhas roughly doubled firm level volatility. In later periods, the decline in firm level\nvolatility was driven largely by the decline in macroeconomic volatility. To the extent\nthat \"Good Policy\" is behind the decline in aggregate volatility, this has also contributed\nto lower volatility at the firm level. Idiosyncratic, firm level volatility exhibits no\nparticular time trend. Studying whether similar patterns can be found in other indicators\nsuch as the volatility of employment, income, and consumption, remains an important\ntopic for future research.\nFinally, our paper has implications for the potential to diversify risks across German\nfirms. Whereas a substantial part of volatility at the firm level is driven by common\nmacroeconomic factors, which limits the diversification potential across domestic firms,\nthe relative importance of idiosyncratic risks has increased over time. These risks,\nhowever, can be diversified in developed financial markets.\n7 References\nAghion, P., and A. Banerjee (2005). Volatility and Growth.

An increase indicates a real\nappreciation (European Central Bank).\nChange in raw material prices: Annual rate of change in the HWWA index of raw\nmaterial prices (overall index).\nShort-term interest rate: Average short-term interest rate (3 months, Frankfurt money\nmarket rate; Deutsche Bundesbank).\nTable 1: Distribution of Firms by Sector and Year\nThis table gives the distribution of firms in the sample by sector (Table 1a) and year (Table 1b). We\nreport the distribution of the number of firms and of the volume of real sales (in million euro). The\nbalanced panel includes all firms; the unbalanced panel includes only firms which are in the sample for\nthe full period.\n(a) Distribution of Firms by Sector\nNumber of firms Real sales\nUnbalanced Balanced Unbalanced Balanced\nNumber Percent Number Percent Mil. euro Percent Mil. euro Percent\nNon-metallic\nTransport\n(b) Distribution of Firms by Year\nNumber of firms Real sales\nUnbalanced Balanced Unbalanced Balanced\nYear Number Percent Number Percent Mil. euro Percent Mil. euro Percent\nTable 2: Descriptive Statistics and Correlation Matrix\nThis table reports descriptive statistics for the data used in the regressions.

Observations are weighted by the inverse of the first-stage regression standard errors.\nThe sectors not captured by the sector dummies are agriculture, energy, and mining. All regressions\ninclude a full set of legal fixed effects (unreported). The explanatory variables are 0-1-dummy variables.\nResiduals are adjusted for heteroskedasticity. ***, **, * = significant at the 1%, 5%, 10%-level.\nDomestic\nabsorption\nWorld\nimport\ndemand\nReal\nexchange\nrate\nRaw\nmaterial\nprices\nShort-term\ninterest rate\nInflation\nTable 4: Determinants of Firm Level Volatility of Real Sales\nThis table reports results of panel fixed effects regressions. The dependent variable is the squared residual\nof a regression of firm level real sales growth on macroeconomic factors. Asset growth, the inventory-\nsales ratio, and leverage are residuals of first-stage regressions as well. \"Year\" is a linear time trend,\n\"Unification\" dummy is a dummy variable which is set to \"One\" for the years 1991-1995 and \"Zero\"\notherwise. ***, **, * = significant at the 1%, 5%, 10%-level.\n(a) Baseline Regressions and Sample Splits by Type of Firm\nFull\nsample\nManu-\nfacturing Services Listed Unlisted Small Large\nSector dummies yes yes yes yes yes yes yes\nLegal dummies yes yes yes yes yes yes yes\nYear dummies no no no no no no no\n(b) Sample Splits by Time\nSector dummies yes yes yes yes yes yes\nLegal dummies yes yes yes yes yes yes\nYear dummies no no no no no no\nTable 5: Regression Results Heteroskedastic Regression Model\nThis table reports results of the heteroskedastic regression model proposed by Harvey (1976). The\ndependent variable is the mean firm level volatility of sales for firms in each sector. Year is a linear time\ntrend, Unification dummy is a dummy variable which is set to \"One\" for the years 1991-1995 and \"Zero\"\notherwise. ***, **, * = significant at the 1%, 5%, 10%-level.\nMean equation\nInventory\u00adsales ratio (%) \u00ad0.46***\nVariance equation\nInventory\u00adsales ratio (%) 0.23\nLeverage\nGraph 1: Unconditional Firm Level Versus Aggregated Volatility\nUnconditional firm level output volatility is the median volatility of firm level sales growth over a five-\nyear window.
