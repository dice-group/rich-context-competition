    "abstract": "Abstract\nCurrent approaches to socially distributed remembering maintain that remembering is a fluid action coordinating minds,\nbodies, and the physical and the social world to accomplish particular goals. That is, the act of remembering is always an\nactive reconstruction of the past in the present. How this act of remembering unfolds is highly dynamic and malleable and is\ncontingent on the means by which the recollection is communicated and the social and material environments in which these\nprocesses unfold. These communicative acts of remembering are always embodied, multimodal, and interactive. However,\nso far, little attention has been paid to the influence that the interplay of multiple behavioral channels have in collaborative\nremembering in small groups. The aim of this exploratory study is to demonstrate the central role that questions have as\nembodied and interactive tools for collaborative remembering in two small group multimodal interactions in natural settings.\nThis study suggests that questions acting as a reminder in multimodal activities of collaborative remembering foster the\nformation of specific types of interactional sequences with their own temporal dynamics.\n",

Conversations are\none way in which social groups develop shared memories of\nthe past (Harris, Keil, Sutton, Barnier, & McIlwain, 2011).\nFrom a multimodal and ecological perspective, analyzing\nactivities of conversational remembering in real-world con-\ntexts involves paying particular attention to the central role\nthat linguistic, embodied, and material resources have in\nshaping those activities (Bietti, 2012b; Bietti & Galiana\nCastell\u00f3, 2013). However, so far, little attention has been\npaid to the influence that the interplay of multiple behavioral\nchannels have in collaborative remembering in small groups.\nSeveral studies in cognitive psychology (e.g., Harris\nhave examined the central role that certain types of linguistic\nexpressions (e.g., disagreements and corrections) have in\nfacilitating the construction of shared memories in small\ngroups in experimental and natural settings. Nevertheless,\nlittle attention has been paid to ways in which questions\nstructure the joint activities of collaborative remembering. In\nconversations about past experiences, often questions are lin-\nguistic expressions used to make requests for information\nabout the events being jointly recalled. Levinson (2012)\nargues that \"one of the most prominent differences between\nquestions and assertions is the obligation to respond\" (p. 16).\nHence, in activities of collaborative remembering, questions\ntend to act as reminders that provide dynamicity and struc-\nture to the group interaction.\nThe aim of this exploratory study is to show the central\nrole that questions have as embodied and interactive tools for\ncollaborative remembering in two small group multimodal\ninteractions in natural settings.\nSocially Situated and Distributed\nRemembering\nIn collaborative activities in everyday life settings (e.g. din-\nner table, classrooms and workplace), the material environ-\nments for reasoning, problem solving, and creativity are\nhighly organized, and thus, they also enhance remembering\nand more general cognitive performances.

Donald argues that \"exograms\" enable\nhuman beings to manipulate complex representations by sig-\nnificantly augmenting the capacity of working memory. In\nthis way, non-biological memory storage (e.g., photographs)\ntogether with the bio-memory systems create the conditions\nfor the emergence of distributed hybrid networks formed by\nthe interwoven neural capacities and external memory\nExperimental studies in cognitive psychology (Hirst &\nEchterhoff, 2012) sustain the view that examining conversa-\ntions about past experiences is one of the most useful mecha-\nnisms for exploring how memory spreads across different\ngroups. Hirst & Echterhoff (2008) argued the unreliability\nand malleability of human memory (unlike computer mem-\nory) \"creates the opportunity for speakers to reshape both\nlisteners' memories and their own\" (Hirst & Echterhoff,\nshared, consolidated, and transformed in conversations, sev-\neral studies (Echterhoff, 2010; Echterhoff, Higgins, Kopietz,\n& Groll, 2008) have investigated how different cognitive,\nlinguistic, and interactive phenomena influence processes of\ncollective memory making.\nExperimental research in socially distributed remember-\ning in cognitive psychology (Harris et al., 2011) supports the\nview that collaboration between members of dyads may\nfacilitate recall. These studies have been largely based on an\nimportant research program in transactive memory in cogni-\ntive psychology (Wegner, Erber, & Raymond, 1991), philo-\nsophical psychology (Theiner, 2013), organizational and\ncommunication sciences (e.g., Hollingshead, 1998) as well\nas the learning sciences (Jackson & Moreland, 2009). These\nstudies suggest that the constitution of transactive memory\nsystems relies on the fact that some groups have the ability to\ndevelop an implicit distribution of cognitive labor whereby\neach member assumes responsibility for learning informa-\ntion within his or her own domain of expertise. Each group\nmember also expects others to learn information about other\nrelevant domains and assume accountability for that.\nHowever, understanding the communication and dynam-\nics is only part of the story in understanding how and when\nindividuals and groups remember the past. For example,\nnaturalistic studies from cognitive and ethnographic perspec-\ntives in cognitive science (Bietti & Galiana Castell\u00f3, 2013;\nBietti, Kok, & Cienki, 2013; Dahlb\u00e4ck, Kristiansson, &\nStjernberg, 2013) and computer science (Wu, Birnholtz,\nRichards, Baecker, & Massimi, 2008) have demonstrated\nhow the actual context in which the remembering occurs is\ncrucial in understanding the ways in which people construct\nand communicate their memories.\nQuestions as Reminders\nReminders are extremely important in sharing memories\nwithin social groups when their knowledge of the past is dis-\ntributed among group members. In conversations, reminders\nare often realized by questions aimed at seeking information\nfrom someone who is assumed to know about events that\noccurred in the past. The use of questions as reminders, such\nas \"Do you remember when. . .?\" to bring a shared past into\nthe present for the sake of a specific goal (e.g., to create a\nfeeling of connection between parents and children) makes\nevident that we are dealing with joint past experience.\nMoreover, reminders function to facilitate the recon-\nstruction of shared past experiences among members of\ngroups by means of collaborative facilitation mechanisms\n(Harris et al., 2011). They may also act as interactive com-\nmunicative devices that trigger the generation of \"new\"\nmemories. These new memories can be strategically con-\nstructed in accordance with interactional goals, such as to\nreach consensus among group members (Bietti, 2012a).\nThus, using questions as reminders has been shown to act as\nan important scaffold in joint and collaborative remember-\ning activities. The results of several studies on collaborative\nstorytelling among couples in which one spouse had been\ndiagnosed with Alzheimer Disease (AD; Hyd\u00e9n, 2011;\nHyd\u00e9n & \u00d6rulv, 2009) have shown that reminders allow the\nperson with AD \"to continue as an active participant and\nstoryteller by making further contributions to the ongoing\nThe Current Study\nIn this study, the role that questions had in activities of\nsocially distributed and situated remembering were exam-\nined in two small groups where collaborative recall was also\nsupported by external resources (e.g., pictures) the partici-\npants had brought along to the group interactions. One group\nconsisted of family members and the other of close friends.\nThe particular pragmatic function (Heritage, 2002; Stivers,\n2010) of each question acting as a reminder in the collabora-\ntive recalling activity among friends and family members\nwill be explored. Participants were all native speakers of\nSpanish.\nThe selection of questions acting as reminders will be\nbased on the coding scheme for question-response sequences\nin conversation that was developed by Stivers and Enfield\n(2010). Their coding scheme is empirically grounded in a\ncomparative project on question-response sequences in ordi-\nnary conversation in 10 languages (Stivers, Enfield, &\nLevinson, 2010). Despite the fact that data of this study are\nin Spanish, which was not 1 of 10 languages covered by this\nproject on questions-response in ordinary conversation, their\nbasic differentiation between Polar Questions, Content (Q-)\nQuestions, and Alternative Questions is in line with what has\nbeen proposed for Spanish from semantic and pragmatic per-\nspectives (e.g., Escandell-Vidal, 1999).\nFrom this coding scheme (Stivers & Enfield, 2010), the\nbasic differentiation was taken between Content (Q-word)\nQuestions (e.g., What did you eat for breakfast?), Polar\nQuestions (e.g., Did you go to the movies yesterday?), and\nAlternative Questions (e.g., Are we going for a walk or do\nyou prefer to stay at home?).\nParticular attention will be paid to the central role that\nreminders play in the formation of adjacency pairs (e.g.,\nare triggered by the obligation to response put forward by\nquestions. An adjacency pair is composed of two turns, and\neach turn has to come from a different speaker and be of a\ndifferent type of utterance. Adjacency pairs lead to the con-\nstruction of interactional spaces (Mondada, 2009).According\nto Mondada (2009), interactional spaces are actively and\nconstantly shaped and sustained by the participants' bodies,\nglances, and gestures during the interaction. Hence, these co-\nconstructed interactional spaces play a central role in guiding\nmutual attention and reciprocity.\nThe jointly and dynamic construction of interactional\nspaces creates the conditions for the emergence of alignment\nmechanisms (Pickering & Garrod, 2004) among group mem-\nbers. Alignment mechanisms are guided by cases of dialogic\nsyntax given by structural similarities between immediately\nco-present linguistic segments in a broader conversational\nIn relation to cases of dialogic syntax, several studies on\nnaturally occurring interaction in conversation analysis\net al., 1974) as well as in experimental settings in psycholin-\nguistics and cognitive psychology (Allen, Haywood,\nshown the ways in which interlocutors collaboratively and\ncooperatively co-construct utterances in conversations. This\nphenomenon may occur by simply repeating and reusing\neach others' lexical items and syntactic structures and/or\nlatching onto the other person's turn and completing it with-\nout pausing. The collaborative turn sequences are cases in\nwhich \"not only a collaboration of two speakers produces a\nsingle syntactic unit [. . .] but also in which the first speaker\nratifies its completion after its occurrence\" (Lerner, 2004,\nIn addition, the analysis will determine to what extent\nthese reminders interplay with co-verbal resources such as\nmanual gestures (e.g., pointing and metaphorical gesture),\nlaughter, and changes in gaze direction. As the participants of\nthis study were not only interacting with each other but also\nwith pictures related to the events that they were collabora-\ntively remembering, significant occurrences of pointing ges-\ntures were considered as directing-to actions (Clark, 2003)\ntoward the pictures being discussed. By directing-to, we refer\nto an action in which \"speakers try to move the addressees'\ngestures refer to the type of manual gesture that has the\npotential to engage an active cross-domain mapping--that is,\nthe cognitive process of understanding something in terms of\nChanges in the direction of gaze toward the recipients of\nquestions acting as reminders will also played an important\nrole in the analyses. This type of behavior is considered as\nembodied resource for mobilizing response reinforcing the\naccountability of recipient to respond to the reminders\ntion of the speakers' gazes in social interactions. Moreover,\nin experimental settings, it has been shown that \"the listener\ntended to respond when the speakers looked at him or her\"\npelling evidence that collaborative activities in face-to-face\ninteraction are not only driven by verbal resources.\nThese are succinct definitions of the type of questions\nused in this study.\nContent (Q-word) Questions\nContent (Q-word) questions include interrogative pronouns\nsuch as: qu\u00e9/what; cu\u00e1l/which; qui\u00e9n/who; d\u00f3nde/where;\nc\u00f3mo/how; cu\u00e1nto/how much. They can be followed by noun\nphrases, which form a syntactic constituent. These types of\nquestions are used to request information that has not been\npreviously mentioned in a communicative interaction.\nPolar Questions\nPolar questions imply an affirmative or negative reply and\ntherefore they are also called absolute yes/no questions. They\ncan be accompanied by a finite verb, a negative adverb,\nadverb of frequency, a clitic, or a subject.\nAlternative Questions\nAlternative questions offer a choice between at least two\nalternative answers. Each of the alternatives in the question\nis stressed. In Spanish, any positive polar question can be\n4 SAGE Open\nFigure 1. Questions acting as reminders.\nturned into an alternative question by adding \"o\"/or and the\nnegative tag \"no\"/not.\nAs the analysis will be focused on the key role that direct\nquestions play in triggering processes of conversational and\ncollaborative remembering in Spanish, it is important to\npoint out the distinction that Spanish grammar makes\nbetween direct and indirect interrogatives. Spanish grammar\n(among many others) makes a distinction between direct and\nindirect speech. On one hand, by direct speech we refer to\ninstances in which \"the writer or the speaker textually repro-\nduces what the speaker has directly expressed in their own\nindirect speech are cases in which \"the narrator refers to what\nthe speaker, or the other person, has said\" (RAE, 1973, p.\n516). This distinction also applies to the interrogatives, and\ntherefore we speak about direct and indirect questions. In\nother words, in direct speech the verbal communication is\nreproduced exactly. Verbs have the same subject, \"I\" and\nIn contrast, indirect questions are cases in which verbs of\nsaying and understanding (to say, ask, warn, tell, etc.) play a\ncentral role (e.g., el me pregunt\u00f3 si sab\u00eda qui\u00e9n hab\u00eda sido el\nresponsable/he asked me if I knew who was responsible).\nMoreover, in indirect questions the interrogative tone disap-\npears, as does the question mark in writing (Gili Gaya, 1961).\nMethod\nParticipants\nTwo groups of four participants were recruited for this study\nvia the researcher's social networks in Argentina. One con-\nsisted of close friends (aged 21-23), the other of family mem-\nBoth groups had gone through a shared event together (e.g.,\na vacation) and had carried along a set of pictures related to\nthat event. All were native Spanish speakers.\nProcedure and Data Collection\nThe data were collected betweenAugust and October 2011 in\nBuenos Aires. Two group conversations were recorded in the\nhomes of one of the participants of each group. Participants\nwere asked to recollect memories based on the pictures they\nhad brought along. The conversation among family members\nwas about a trip to Maui, Hawaii, that they had made together\nto attend the wedding of the parents'daughter. The conversa-\ntion among the friends was about a 2-week summer vacation\nthat they had spent together in a summer resort by the sea-\nside. The interventions of the research assistant were mini-\nmal, merely functioning to invoke continuation of the\nconversation. The conversations were recorded with two\ndigital video cameras placed in different corners of the room\n(Canon LEGRIA HF M46 and Sony Mobile HD Snap\nCoding\nThe audio and video recordings were transcribed in detail\nusing two specialized software programs (Inqscribe and\nChronoviZ). The overall length of the recordings was 14.54\nmin for the family, and 22.08 min for the friends. Video and\naudio recordings of both focus groups were coded for a wide\nrange of co-verbal behaviors, divided into three categories:\n(a) manual gestures, (b) non-manual gestures, and (c) pos-\ntural behaviors. The minimum unit of time used for coding of\nthe video and audio recording was 500 ms. For all time\npoints, a binary value was assigned to each behavior for each\nparticipant, indicating whether he or she performed that\nbehavior at that particular moment in time. Audio recordings\nwere transcribed following the Jefferson Transcription\nAnalysis\nA total number of 104 direct questions were found in the\ndata, 57 questions in the group consisting of close friends\nand 47 in the group formed by family members. The larger\nnumber of questions found in the friends data may be related\nto the fact that that group session was 7.14 min longer than\nthe family one. For both groups, the following charts show:\n(a) the percentage of questions acting as reminders, (b) the\ndistribution of questions acting as reminders among the four\nparticipants of the group and the interviewer, and (c) how\nthese reminders are distributed across the different types of\nquestions described above (Content (Q-) Questions; Polar\nQuestions and Alternative Questions).\nAs Figure 1, 84% (friends) and 74% (family) of the ques-\ntions were cases of questions acting as reminders. Within\n16% (friends) and 26% (family) under the category \"other,\"\nwe included uses of questions related to the organization of\nthe specific task (e.g., clarification questions to the inter-\nviewer) but not to the activity of collaborative remembering.\nThis finding demonstrates the importance of reminders in\nthis group interaction and provides analytical validity to the\nfocus of inquiry. Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of\nquestions acting as reminders among friends and family\nmembers. It also shows to what extent the interviewer was\ninvolved in the dynamics of the group interactions.\nFigure 3 provides information regarding the type of ques-\ntions found in the two groups interactions, based on Stivers\nand Enfield's coding scheme (Stivers & Enfield, 2010). The\nquestions acting as reminders made by the interviewer were\nexcluded from this chart.\nFor the qualitative and multimodal analysis we selected\nan interactional sequence initiated by each of the question\ntypes acting as a reminder listed in Figure 3. There were\nnot instances of alternative questions in the family data.\nHence, the section focused on the qualitative and multi-\nmodal analysis of the family interaction only includes two\nexamples instead of three. Within 11 percent (friends) and\n19 percent (family) under the category \"other\" we included\ncases of Elliptical Content Q-word and Elliptical Polar\nQuestions (e.g., \u00bfy \u00e9sta?/and this?, and \u00bfno?/right?) that\nwere related to the activity of collaborative remembering.\nHowever, as the identification of these cases of elliptical\nquestions can be quite arbitrary without a proper phono-\nlogical analysis, which is beyond the scope of this study, it\nwas decided not to select them for the qualitative and mul-\ntimodal analysis.\nThe order for presenting the examples was determined by\nthe time of the interaction itself. Multimodal annotations on\nthe transcripts and still images were made using the follow-\ning coding scheme: (a) yellow circles in the transcripts and\non the still images to indicate pointing, metaphorical ges-\ntures, facial expressions and touching the pictures; (b) red\ncircles in the transcript to indicate when a change in the\ndirection of eye-gaze occurs; (c) red arrows on the still\nimages to approximately show where the participants are\ngazing; and (d) blue circles in the transcript to indicate\ninstances of phrasal repetition across speakers.\nA chart for each of the interactional sequences analyzed\nwas included next to the still images to show the temporal\ndynamics of relevant co-verbal behaviors.\nCase 1: Friends\nContent (Q-word) questions.In this interactional sequence\n(Figure 4), the group of friends is trying to jointly identify\nwho was missing. Augusto asked the question and he asks\nwho took the picture that they are talking about.\nFrom Line 1 we note how Augusto's Content (Q-word)\nQuestion operates as a reminder within the interaction and\nestablishes a shared goal, that is, to remember who was\nmissing in the picture being used to remember what they\nwere doing in that specific situation. However, to find out\nwhich of the friends were missing in the photograph also\nentails jogging their memories as to who the author of the\npicture was. It is important to point out that Augusto refor-\nmulates the reminder in Line 1, a few lines below (L. 5), and\nthus, he makes clear that his goal is not only to remember\nwho was missing, but rather to recall who had taken the pic-\nture. Augusto's question in Line 1 makes the four partici-\npants lean forward. While leaning forward, Tommy also\ntakes the picture in question to take a closer look (pic. a).\nInterestingly, Augusto's questions acting as reminders (L. 1\nand 5) do not only provoke the participants to lean forward\nand focus their visual attention on the picture but also seem\nto trigger the formation of similar postural behaviors as they\nall try to answer the question (chin-rest, b, and Figure 5\nSubsequently, in Line 8 when Santi answers the question\nregarding who took the picture, Augusto changes the direc-\ntion he is looking toward him (L. 8, red circle, pic. b). At that\npoint, it is when Augusto, Tommy, and Santi lean back and\n18,500 ms]). What is so funny about the situation is that it\nwas Augusto who had actually taken that picture.\nThroughout the entire interactional sequence initiated by\nAugusto's reminders (L.1 and 5), it is possible to observe the\nways in which instances of dialogic syntax based on the rep-\netition of syntactic structures and lexical items constitute the\nbasis for the emergence of spiral effects that linguistically\nFigure 2. Distribution of reminders across participants. Figure 3. Type of questions acting as reminders.\n6 SAGE Open\nshape processes of socially situated and distributed remem-\nbering (e.g., \"era de d\u00eda\"/it was daylight, L. 2-3; and \u00bfqui\u00e9n\nsac\u00f3 la foto?/who took the picture, L. 5-6).\nPolar questions. The theme of the next interactional sequence\n(Figure 6) is related to the identities and descriptions of\nthe people who attended one of the parties that they had\nFigure 5. Temporal dynamics: Content (Q-word) Question (Friends).\nFigure 4. Content (Q-word) Question (Friends).\norganized at the house where they were staying during the\nsummer vacations.\nIn the first Line 1, Tommy uses a Polar Question to ask\nwhether the events depicted in the picture they are looking at,\nand jointly remembering through it, took place at the house\nwhere they were staying during the summer vacations. While\nTommy formulates the question pragmatically acting as a\nreminder, he also leans forward to take hold of the specific\npicture (pic. d). Tommy's leaning forward and attempt to the\ntake the picture are temporally coordinated with Augusto's\npointing at the photograph (pic. d, pic. e, and pic. f). This\ntemporal synchronization is reflected in the temporal dynam-\nics of co-verbal behaviors that is shown in Figure 7 (1,000\nms onward).\nFigure 6. Polar Question (Friends).\nFigure 7. Temporal dynamics: Polar Question (Friends).\n8 SAGE Open\nAlthough Tommy's question does not seem to trigger the\nformation of an adjacency pair, it does lead to the initiation\nof interactional sequence in which the four participants are\nengaged in remembering who attended the party that they are\ndescribing. In Lines 3 and 5, Augusto introduces a new\ncharacter in the reconstruction of the events. After Nacho's\nagreement in the next line, we observe how a process of lexi-\ncal alignment between Augusto and Santi (\"Mitch,\" blue\ncircles, L. 4, 6-7) operates to interactionally and linguisti-\ncally ground the shared activity of remembering together\nwho else was there with them. Interestingly, the process of\nlexical alignment between Augusto and Santi is also\nembodily manifested in a change in the direction of Santi's\nIn Line 8, Santi continues with the description of\n\"Mitch\" and introduces a new character in the events\nwhile he still looks at Augusto. It is at this point when\nTommy changes his gaze toward Santi (red circle, L. 9).\nWhile they are looking at each other (pic. e), we can notice\nthe formation of a collaborative turn sequence. Santi's\nratification of Tommy's collaborative completion appears\nin Line 12 \"Flor/Flor.\" Moreover during the time they are\nlooking at each other (pic. f), collaborative remembering\nbetween Santi and Tommy is behaviorally grounded in\ninstances of lexical alignment (e.g., \"Flor\"/Flor, and \"la\ngorda\"/the fatty).\nAlternative questions. In the following interactional sequence\n(Figure 8), one of the participants tries to find out if other\nFigure 8. Alternative Question (Friends).\nFigure 9. Temporal dynamics: Alternative Question (Friends).\nmembers of the group had made an attempt to get off with a\ngirl that was with them at a party.\nTommy's Alternative Question in Line 1 initiates the\ninteractional sequence and triggers the formation of an\nadjacency pair between Santi and himself (L. 1-2). Tommy's\nchange in gaze direction toward Santi operates as an\nembodied resource aimed at mobilizing response from the\nperson who is asked the question. At the time when Santi\nresponds to Tommy's question, Augusto and Nacho change\nthe focus of their visual attention from the picture that it is\nms]). However, Augusto and Nacho are not the only partici-\npants who reorient their behavior while Santi respond to\nTommy's Alternative Q. As we can notice, almost at the\ntime when Santi is finalizing his utterance \"no estaba\"/she\nwasn't there (red circle, L. 2), Tommy changes his focus of\nvisual attention again to the picture in which the girl who\nthey are talking about is depicted, as in an attempt to check\nif the girl was as pretty as Santi describes her. Such multi-\nple reorientations of behaviors are also reflected in (h), and\nin the temporal dynamics of co-verbal behaviors that it is\nIn Line 5, Augusto also changes his gaze direction toward\nTommy when he explains to him that he did not make an\nattempt to get off with that girl either (red circle, pic. i).\nAugusto's intervention makes Tommy and himself laugh\nThe interactional sequence triggered by Tommy's\nreminder in Line 1 is linguistically structured by the repeti-\ntion and reuse of lexical items (\"estaba\"/was there; and\n\"agarraste\"\u00ad\"no agarr\u00e9\"/you had her--I didn't have her) that\nserve to linguistically ground the shared activity of collab-\norative remembering.\nCase 2: Family\nContent (Q-word) questions.In this interactional sequence\n(Figure 10), Dolores and Diego are collaboratively remem-\nbering how they were feeling on their arrival in Maui from\nBuenos Aires. A picture of their arrival externally supports\nthis joint activity.\nIn the first line, Marta asks a question (pic. a) to the inter-\nviewer regarding whether they (family members) should\nexpect to answer questions made by the interviewer or\nFigure 10. Content (Q-word) Question (Family).\nsimply engaged in conversation among themselves. The\nanswer to this clarification question comes in Line 4.\nNonetheless, Marta's embodied request for clarification (yel-\nlow circle, L. 1), which integrates multimodal resources\n(speech, pointing, and gaze), concerning the nature of the\nactivity does not interfere with the interaction between\nDolores and Diegui. The adjacency pair opened by Dolores\nby means of the Content (Q-word) Question (L.2), acting as\na reminder, initiates a sequence of laughter between her and\nDiegui, her husband. In this case, laugher is an embodied\nlocally produced by Dolores (L.2) to foster an affiliation and\nalliance with Diegui who returns the laughter, and in doing\nso, behaviorally aligns with his wife (blue circles, L 2-10,\nDolores' and Diegui's alignment generated and mediated\nby simultaneous and sequential laughing is further supported\nby instances of linguistic alignment that are illustrated in the\nrepetition and reuse of lexical items and syntactic structures\n(blue circles, L. 2, 9, 11-13). Moreover, Dolores'gaze toward\nDiegui while formulating both questions (L.2 pic. a) operates\nas a resource for mobilizing response. Thus, Dolores makes\nmore pressure to Diego to respond to her question acting as a\nreminder regarding how he was feeling on arrival in Maui.\nIn the second element of the adjacency pair initiated by\nDolores (L.2), Diegui uses a pointing gesture (pic. b) to\nrefer to the picture that they are talking about (yellow circle,\ncommon ground (Clark, 1996) between him and Dolores, as\nwell as, among the four participants who change the direc-\ntion of eye-gaze toward the specific picture. Diegui's point-\ning gesture is a directing-to action by moving not only\nDolores but also Marta and Diego's visual attention to the\nparticular photograph (pic. b). This photograph works as an\nexternal resource for grounding collaborative remembering\nbetween Dolores and Diegui until the long pause (2.8) in the\npenultimate turn of the interactional sequence (L. 12).\nDuring that long pause, Diegui makes a facial expression\n(eyebrow-flash) showing hesitation regarding Dolores'\naccount of how they were feeling on arrival (yellow circle,\nDolores gazes Diegui (red circle, L. 12, pic. d), and thereby,\nthe picture no longer acts as an external resource for ground-\ning the remembering activity. Interestingly, after Diegui's\nfacial expression, Dolores reformulates her account. Finally,\nDiegui agrees with such reformulation (L.13).\nPolar questions. In the following interactional sequence (Fig-\nure 12), Diegui and Marta are trying to locate in chronologi-\ncal time one of the pictures that they brought in for the focus\ngroup session.\nThe interactional sequence begins with Diegui's Polar\nQuestion in Line 1. In the element of the following question-\nresponse adjacency pair (L.5-6), Marta uses a circular meta-\nphorical gesture (yellow circle, L. 6, pic. h, Figure 13\nsent the passage of time while suggesting the possibility that\nthe events that the particular photograph are depicting\noccurred the third day after arrival, not the second as she\npreviously claimed (yellow circle, L. 4, pic. f, Figure 13\n[4,500 ms]). The last question-response adjacency pair is\ncompleted by another manual gesture made by Marta (yel-\nuses a pointing gesture to refer to another picture in the photo\nalbum that seems to be thematically related to the one that\nthey were using for grounding the collaborative activity of\nshared remembering. Thus, she makes an attempt to exter-\nnally ground her arguments concerning the order of the pic-\ntures (and events) in time.\nDiegui's and Marta's collaborative behavior is also sup-\nported by instances of lexical alignment: \"foto\"/picture, \"esa\nfoto\"/that picture (blue circles, L.1-2, 8), and \"otro d\u00eda\"/\nanother day (blue circles, L.4-6). As the interactional\nsequence shows, there is a clear coordination between these\ncases of lexical alignment and the manual gestures described\nabove (pointing and metaphorical gesture).\nFigure 11. Temporal dynamics: Content (Q-word) Question (Family).\nDiscussion\nThe quantitative analysis has indicated that a significant per-\ncentage of the total number of questions formulated in both\nsessions made a pragmatic contribution: They played the role\nof reminders in the multimodal interactions between friends\nand family members. This finding shows the central role that\nquestions acting as reminders had for socially situated and\ndistributed remembering in the two groups'naturalistic inter-\nactions by providing the interactional and linguistic architec-\nture for the entire activity.\nThe aim of selecting only three types of questions (Content\n(Q-Word) Questions, Polar Questions, and Alternative\nQuestions) from the data for the subsequent qualitative anal-\nyses was to provide an in-depth view of the ways in which\nthese reminders actually work in multimodal and interac-\ntional settings. At a linguistic and conversational level,\nreminders tend to open question-response adjacency pairs\n(Stivers et al., 2010). These question-response pairs along\nwith the multiple cases syntactic and lexical alignment oper-\nated as mechanisms providing structure for the activity of\nshared remembering, as well as key elements in the jointly\nand dynamically creation of common ground among group\nmembers. However, the collaborative creation of a common\nground, on which the shared activity of conversational\nremembering was built, could not be fully understood if we\nonly considered the behavioral level. Several examples have\ndemonstrated how participants do not only mechanically\nmirror each others'behaviors. It goes further: There are cases\nin which the collaborative co-construction of utterances\nFigure 13. Temporal dynamics: Polar Question (Family).\nFigure 12. Polar Question (Family).\nwhich they seemed to be actually sharing individual memo-\nries of the events experienced together as groups. This find-\ning seems to be in accordance with the fact that instances of\nlexical and syntactic alignment in conversations seem to\nfacilitate the construction of shared situation models about\nthe events that participants in conversation are talking about\n(Pickering & Garrod, 2004). On the other hand, with the kind\nof qualitative methodology presented in this exploratory\nstudy, it is quite unlikely to demonstrate whether there are\ncausal relations between the formation of adjacency pairs\ntogether with cases of syntactic and lexical alignment and the\nsharing of representations about the events experienced\ntogether. This is a methodological limitation that future stud-\nies from experimental perspectives should strive to\novercome.\nAt the co-linguistic and multimodal level, reminders\nserved to reorient group behavior and establish shared focus\nof visual attention. Such reorientations of behaviors and new\nfocuses of visual attention indicate the joint and dynamic\nconfigurations of shared goals (e.g., Tomasello, Carpenter,\nCall, Behne, & Moll, 2005). Those shared goals included\ncases where participants were trying to remember who the\nauthor of the picture that they were talking about was\n(friends, Content (Q-word) Question) to collaborative recall\nas to how they were feeling on their arrival in Maui from\nBuenos Aires (family, Content (Q-word) Question). At this\npoint, it is important to highlight the fact that in both groups,\nfriends and family members were not only interacting with\neach other, but also with the pictures they themselves had\ntaken of the events they were remembering together.\nRegarding the interanimations of individual memories\nand the external representations supported by material envi-\nronments (e.g., to use tools to solve a specific task), several\nstrated that the successful coordination of information from\ninternal representations (e.g., in working memory) and exter-\nnal representations plays a critical role by improving prob-\nlem-solving performance in activities in which interaction\nwith external resources called for. The qualitative analyses\nhave reliably shown that the pictures did operate as artifacts\nexternally grounding the entire group dynamics. However,\nbecause of the methodological limitations of the study\ndesign, it would not be possible to claim whether the partici-\npants would have remembered less if the pictures were not\nthere.\nThe temporal dynamics of the sequential alignment of co-\nverbal behaviors among participants (Figures 5, 7, 9, 11, and\n13) in each of the interactional sequences initiated by the\nreminders suggest that behavioral and cognitive processes in\nthe group activities were not only distributed across the room\nWhen combined and integrated, the examination of the\ninterplay of conversational with co-verbal resources in the\ninteractional sequences triggered by the reminders shows\nhow socially situated and distributed remembering in the two\ngroups, that unfolded in a macro-time scale, influence inter-\nactional behavior over much shorter time-scales (the time\nneeded to formulate a question). This was reflected in the\nsignificant percentage of total questions that acted as remind-\ners. However, this is not a top-down relationship as the\nevents occurring in micro-time scales (e.g., formulating\nquestions) are precisely those kinds of actions that give shape\nto the overall high-level cognitive activity of collaborative\nremembering within the groups. Thus, and based on the qual-\nitative evidence provided, this exploratory study has demon-\nstrated that socially situated and distributed remembering in\nnatural environments has to be considered as a bi-directional\ncollaborative activity, jointly determined by high-level cog-\nnitive processes (e.g., collaboratively remembering specific\nshared experiences) as well as by more procedural and auto-\nmatic behaviors (e.g., formation of question\u00adanswer adja-\ncency pairs, simultaneous and sequential alignment of\nco-verbal behaviors).\nIt is hoped that future studies on collaborative remember-\ning in experimental settings could empirically test the central\nrole that questions acting as reminders may have on benefit-\ning shared and distributed remembering in small groups.\nThus, it would be possible to unravel the web of multiple\ninteranimations among a wide range of multimodal behav-\niors unfolding on interdependent time-scales in this kind of\neveryday but complex social activities.\n"
