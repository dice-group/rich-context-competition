We\naddress these questions through a natural experiment generated by the coincidence of the uncovering of a corruption\nscandal in Spain (the B\u00e1rcenas scandal) and the fieldwork of the European Social Survey. Given that the day at which\nsurvey interviews were conducted is as-if random, the uncovering of the scandal represents a unique opportunity to\nassess the causal effect of corruption on individuals' trust in politicians. The results indicate that: (i) the corruption\nscandal had a substantial negative effect on trust in politicians; (ii) the effect of the scandal was stronger in the days\nfollowing its disclosure; (iii) the effect of the scandal was independent from individuals' partisan preferences.\n",

Most studies iden-\ntify a positive correlation between corruption, corruption\nscandals and different forms of political discontent\nHowever, in the case of the electoral punishment of corrupt\npoliticians, the identified effects of corruption range from\nnull to moderate (Jim\u00e9nez and Ca\u00ednzos, 2006).\nWe argue that there are three reasons that could explain\nthe diverging findings between studies of political attitudes\nand political behaviour. First, due to the mutual causality\nbetween measures of corruption and attitudes, previous stud-\nies might overestimate the negative effects of corruption on\npolitical attitudes. Second, the impact of corruption on atti-\ntudes might be limited in time. After a corruption scandal is\nuncovered individuals might develop negative attitudes\ntowards politicians, but these attitudes might quickly\nrecover afterwards. Third, the attitudes of individuals who\nsympathize with the corrupt politicians might not be affected\nby their wrongdoings (Anduiza et al., 2013).\nTo assess these three possibilities, we exploit a natural\nexperiment generated by the coincidence of the uncovering\nof one of the most relevant corruption scandals to have\noccurred in Spain \u00ad the B\u00e1rcenas scandal \u00ad and the field-\nwork of the European Social Survey (ESS). The timing of\nthe survey is used as a source of exogenous variation in\ncorruption, which allows us to assess the causal effect of a\nreal-world corruption scandal on trust in politicians.\nMoreover, through this design we can assess whether the\nimpact of the scandal decays, and also whether partisanship\nmoderates the effect of the scandal.\nThe corrosive effect of corruption\non trust in politicians: Evidence\nfrom a natural experiment\nMacarena Ares1 and Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez2\n Keywords\nCorruption, natural experiment, trust in politicians, political support, scandals\n1European University Institute, San Domenico di Fiesole, Firenze, Italia\n2Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain\nCorresponding author:\nEnrique Hern\u00e1ndez, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Av. de l'Eix\nCentral, Edifici B2, Cerdanyola del Vall\u00e8s, Barcelona, 08193, Spain.\nEmail: enrique.hernandez@uab.cat\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nTheoretical framework\nCorruption scandals make the wrongdoings of politicians\nknown to the public. Confronted with these cases, individu-\nals should update their attitudes towards politicians based on\ntheir judgement of the behaviour of political authorities. This\nis the hypothesis put forward by institutional theories, which\nposit that attitudes like trust in politicians are endogenous to\nthe political system and depend on what political authorities\ndo (Mishler and Rose, 2001). Institutions that perform well\nand produce desirable outputs should garner support, while\nthe misuse of public office should lead to distrust.\nIn line with institutional theories, studies have identified\na positive correlation between corruption, corruption scan-\ndals and political discontent. Anderson and Tverdova\nuncover a negative association between aggregate meas-\nures of corruption, individual-level perceptions of corrup-\ntion and individuals' political support. Studies addressing\nthe impact of specific corruption scandals have also\nrevealed a negative effect of corruption (Bowler and Karp,\ndals is, however, not restricted to corruption. Kumlin and\nEsaiasson's (2012) comprehensive analysis of scandals in\nEurope reveals that different types of political scandals\ngenerate political discontent (see Rottinghaus, 2014 for an\noverview of the US literature).\nContrasting with the literature on political attitudes,\nstudies that analyse the electoral performance of politicians\ninvolved in corruption scandals have only identified a mod-\nest, or even null, effect of corruption on the electoral for-\ntunes of these politicians. Voters seem to forgive corrupt\npoliticians since they are usually re-elected (Golden, 2006;\nJim\u00e9nez and Ca\u00ednzos, 2006). Corruption has a mild effect\non the electoral support of corrupt politicians across differ-\nent contexts like Spain (Riera et al., 2013), Germany\nThere are three possibilities that could help explain the\ndiverging findings in studies of political attitudes and\npolitical behaviour. The first possibility is that the impact\nof corruption on attitudes like political distrust might have\nbeen overestimated. In previous studies corruption was\noften operationalized through measures of scandal recall\nor perceived corruption, either at the individual level\nthrough survey items (Bowler and Karp, 2004; Villoria\net al., 2013), or at the aggregate level with indicators like\nthe Corruption Perceptions Index, which are also gauged\nthrough cross-sectional individual-level surveys (Anderson\nand Tverdova, 2003). The findings of these studies are\nlikely to be biased due to the mutual causality between per-\nceptions of corruption, scandal recall and political trust.\nHigh perceptions of corruption, scandal recall and institu-\ntional mistrust generate a vicious circle of mutual rein-\nforcement that increases the difficulty of disentangling the\ncausal effect of corruption (Morris and Klesner, 2010).\nLongitudinal and experimental designs can overcome\nthe endogeneity problems of cross-sectional designs.\nHowever, one of the drawbacks of longitudinal studies is\nthat the measurement of attitudes is made months or even\nyears after the corruption scandal occurred (Chanley et al.,\nscandals are likely to weaken over time (see below). With\nregards to experimental designs, while they provide robust\nevidence of a causal effect of corruption on political atti-\nvalidity is limited. Since it is problematic to credibly\nmanipulate real corruption scandals, most experimental\nresearch focuses on fictitious scandals. Therefore, any evi-\ndence on the effects of real corruption scandals on repre-\nsentative samples of the population is, thus far, limited.\nWe rely on a quasi-experimental design to overcome some\nof these limitations and analyse if real-world corruption scan-\ndals can influence trust in politicians. Drawing on institu-\ntional theories, and based on the premise that corruption\nscandals signal an abuse of the power entrusted by citizens to\npolitical authorities, we expect that these scandals will under-\nmine trust in politicians. If a scandal involves high-ranking\ngovernment officials, citizens should update their trust in\npoliticians. This leads us to our first hypothesis:\n: Exposure to relevant and salient corruption scandals\nwill reduce trust in politicians\nEven if corruption scandals affect political attitudes,\nthese scandals might not entail an electoral defeat of cor-\nrupt politicians if they have only a short-term effect on atti-\ntudes that has vanished by the time elections take place.\nThe literature on media effects suggests that this might be\nthe case, since the information conveyed in the media only\nexerts a short-term influence on public opinion (Gerber et\nal., 2011). In fact, studies indicate that the effects of politi-\ncal communications decay quickly (Hill et al., 2013).\nMoreover, if we also take into account that individuals tend\nto base their political opinions on top-of-the-head consid-\nerations (Zaller, 1992), we can expect that corruption scan-\ndals should inform individuals' trust in politicians to a\ngreater extent in the weeks following their disclosure. Since\nthe coverage of scandals should be more extensive just\nafter they have been uncovered, scandal-related considera-\ntions should be more salient on individuals' minds during\nthose days. Therefore, the effect of corruption scandals on\npolitical attitudes might be only short term (but cf. Doherty\net al., 2014). This leads us to our second hypothesis:\n: The negative effect of corruption scandals on trust in\npoliticians will be stronger in the days following their\ndisclosure and will decay over time\nThe influence of corruption scandals on political atti-\ntudes and elections could also be mitigated if individuals\nAres and Hern\u00e1ndez 3\nreact differently to scandals depending on their pre-existing\nattitudes. Individuals' predispositions, like their partisan-\nship, make them react differently to political information\n(Zaller, 1992). Those who identify with the party involved\nin a scandal are likely to filter the information they receive\nand attribute lower importance to that scandal. Anduiza et\nal. (2013) have shown that partisanship moderates toler-\nance towards corruption. Individuals are likely to judge the\ncorrupt actions of politicians less severely if they are com-\nmitted by politicians of the party they support. Therefore,\npartisanship might condition how individuals react to a cor-\nruption scandal. This leads us to our final hypothesis:\n: The negative effects of corruption scandals on trust\nin politicians will be weaker among the supporters of\nthe party involved in the scandal\nThe B\u00e1rcenas case\nThe B\u00e1rcenas case is one of the most relevant corruption\nscandals occurred in Spain in the last decade. It became\nwidely known when the newspaper El Pa\u00eds leaked internal\ndocuments from the Partido Popular (PP) on 31 January\n2013. The documents leaked by El Pa\u00eds were facsimiles\nwritten by Luis B\u00e1rcenas (the treasurer of the party) which\nindicated that the party had received illegal contributions\nthat were used to pay cash bonuses to high-ranking mem-\nbers of the party, among other irregularities. After the pub-\nlication of these documents by El Pa\u00eds, news of the scandal\nwas widely covered by national and international televi-\nsions and newspapers. While news related to B\u00e1rcenas had\nalready appeared on 18 January in the newspaper El Mundo,\nthe leak by El Pa\u00eds was the first to suggest that the scandal\naffected not only the treasurer of the party, but also a large\nnumber of high-ranking members of the PP. In fact, on 4\nFebruary PP Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy admitted that\n`nothing was true, except for a few things' (referring to the\nscandal documents).\nTo have a better picture of how the B\u00e1rcenas scandal\nrapidly rose in salience on 31 January, Figure 1 summarizes\nthe relative frequencies of Google searches about the scan-\ndal. As the graph shows, the maximum peak in searches\nwas reached the day El Pa\u00eds leaked the bookkeeping docu-\nments. This is consistent with the great salience with which\nthis issue was covered in the Spanish media.1 The figure\nalso reveals that there was an increase in the number of\nsearches when El Mundo presented a piece about B\u00e1rcenas,\nbut the issue became then less salient only to peak at the\nend of January, coinciding with the disclosure by El Pa\u00eds of\nthe B\u00e1rcenas documents.\nData and methods\nThe empirical analyses draw on data from the sixth round\nof the ESS, which was fielded in Spain between 23 January\nby Legewie (2013), we capitalize on the coincidence of the\nuncovering of the B\u00e1rcenas scandal and the ESS field-\nwork.2 Our quasi-experimental identification strategy relies\non the assumption that the timing at which respondents\nwere interviewed is as-if random, so that the uncovering of\nthe B\u00e1rcenas case provides an exogenous source of varia-\ntion for levels of corruption. As such, the day at which the\ninterview was conducted assigns respondents to the treat-\nment and control groups. The sample is split so that those\nwho were interviewed before the scandal are assigned to\nthe control group and those who were interviewed in the\nweeks following the uncovering of the scandal are assigned\nto the treatment group. Therefore, the treatment variable Di\nis operationalized as follows:3\nD\nD\ni\ni\n=\n( )\n= 0 control group if subject i was interviewed\nbefor\n= 1 treatment group if\n( )\n( )\nDi\nsubject i was\ninterviewed between 31 January and\n( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn assumption of this identification strategy is that the\ntiming of the survey is exogenous, and hence independent\nof other third variables that could affect trust in politicians\n(ignorability assumption). Potential threats to this assump-\ntion come from the differential reachability of the sampled\nrespondents. If factors that determine reachability are\nrelated to political trust, there might be systematic differ-\nences in trust that are unrelated to the treatment. To assess\nthe plausibility of this assumption, we conduct balance\ntests on several pre-treatment variables.\nTable 1 summarizes the results of the balance tests for\nthe following pre-treatment covariates: years of education\ncompleted, gender, age, employment status, and having\nFigure 1. Google trends for the search `caso barcenas'.\n4 Research and Politics \nvoted for the winning party (PP) in the last election.4 Most\ncovariates are similarly distributed within the control and\ntreatment groups. The only statistically significant differ-\nence between the two groups appears for employment sta-\ntus. There are more respondents in paid work in the\ntreatment group and more respondents outside of the\nlabour market in the control group. There is also a slight\nimbalance between the treatment and control groups with\nregard to age (p-value = 0.06). Overall, these tests suggest\nthat the potential selection bias (reachability bias) exerts\nonly a minor influence on whether individuals were inter-\nviewed before or after the scandal, and provides further\nsupport for the characterization of the event as a natural\nexperiment.\nTo analyse the effect of the scandal we fit a series of\nOLS regressions in which trust in politicians is specified as\nthe dependent variable. Trust in politicians is measured in\nan 11-point scale where 0 means no trust at all and 10\nmeans absolute trust. Besides the treatment variable Di\nthe\nmodels also include controls for the pre-treatment covari-\nates summarized in Table 1 and region fixed effects. Region\nfixed effects are included to account for the fact that some\nregions are not present in the control group.\nResults\nThe effect of the corruption scandal (H1\n)\nFigure 2 summarizes the levels of trust in politicians (a\nmoving average of 2 days) during the months of January\nand February. The x-axis ranges from -10 to 30, and the\nvalue 0 corresponds to 31 January. There is a substantial\ndrop in trust in politicians on 31 January. Before the\nB\u00e1rcenas scandal the average level of trust in politicians\nin the control group is of 2.3 points. After the scandal was\nuncovered, the average trust in the treatment group is of\n1.8 points. Thus, there is a -0.5 difference between the\ntwo groups, a reduction in trust that is quite remarkable\ngiven the already low levels of trust of Spanish citizens\nbefore the scandal.\nTable 2 summarizes the results of the regression models.\nThe treatment indicator Di\nof model-1 shows that respondents\nwho were interviewed after El Pa\u00eds uncovered the B\u00e1rcenas\nscandal have, on average, lower trust in politicians. The dif-\nference is of 0.48 points and statistically significant. Model-2\nincorporates the pre-treatment covariates and region fixed\neffects. In this model the difference between those who were\nexposed to the B\u00e1rcenas scandal and those who were not is of\n-0.45 points. This difference is larger than the difference\nbetween election winners and losers, which is a common pre-\ndictor of trust in politicians. Hence, in line with our first\nhypothesis, these models indicate that the B\u00e1rcenas scandal\nhad a substantial negative impact on trust in politicians.\nChanges in the treatment effect over time (H2\n)\nTo test H2\nwe estimate a series of regression models in which\nwe progressively enlarge the treatment group by 5 days, while\nthe control group stays always the same (those interviewed\nbefore 31 January). For the first estimation, the treatment\ngroup only comprises those interviewed on the week immedi-\nately following the scandal (31 January to 6 February), for the\nsecond estimation we also add respondents interviewed in the\nnext 5 days (i.e. from 31 January and 11 February). We con-\ntinue enlarging the treatment group by 5 days at each estima-\ntion until the final date of the fieldwork (12 May) is reached.\nThis allows us to analyse if the treatment effects decay as we\nincorporate to the treatment group individuals interviewed\nfurther away from the day when the scandal was uncovered.\nThe model estimated to test this hypothesis is specified with\nthe same covariates of model-2.5\nFigure 3 summarizes how the estimate for Di\nchanges as\nindividuals interviewed at a later point in time are incorpo-\nrated to the treatment group. The trend line in Figure 3 dis-\nplays a decay of the effect over time. When we restrict the\ntreatment group to those interviewed just after the scandal\nwas uncovered, the difference in trust in politicians between\nthose who were exposed to the scandal and those who were\nnot is of 0.50 points. As we incorporate to the treatment\ngroup individuals interviewed further away from the\nTable 1.Two-sample t-tests.\nVariables Mean p-value Valid N\nTreatment Control\nEmployment status: \nAres and Hern\u00e1ndez 5\nscandal, the size of the coefficient Di\ndecreases in size. In\nfact, when those interviewed in May are incorporated to the\ntreatment group, the effect shrinks to -0.32 and is no longer\nstatistically significant. These results support the idea that\nthe scandal informed citizens' evaluations of the trustwor-\nthiness of politicians to a greater extent on the weeks that\nfollowed the publication of the B\u00e1rcenas documents.6\nTreatment effect heterogeneity (H3\n)\nTo analyse the moderating role of partisan predispositions,\nin model-3 of Table 2 we interact the treatment indicator Di\nand the election winner variable, which measures whether\nthe respondent voted for the PP in the last national elec-\ntions.7 Although partisanship (i.e. being close to PP) would\nbe a more adequate indicator of partisan predispositions,\nwe rely on the party voted for because partisanship could be\naffected by the corruption scandal. The interaction coeffi-\ncient indicates that there are no significant differences in\nthe effect of being exposed to the B\u00e1rcenas scandal between\nthose who voted for PP and those who did not. Hence, con-\ntrary to our expectations, the effects of the corruption scan-\ndal are not moderated by partisanship.\nRobustness checks\nOne of the threats to the ignorability assumption comes\nfrom the differential reachability of respondents. To assess\nthe robustness of our results against this potential bias, we\ninclude in our analyses information about the number of\ntimes an individual declined to reply to the survey after\nhaving been contacted, which serves as a proxy for respond-\nents' reachability. Our estimates are not altered by the\ninclusion of this variable in our models (Table A2, supple-\nmentary materials).8 Moreover, some Spanish regions were\nonly surveyed (reached) after treatment. Therefore, we re-\nestimate all our models including only regions with\nrespondents in both the treatment and control groups. The\nresults indicate that our conclusions are not altered when\nconsidering only these regions (Table A2, supplementary\nmaterials).\nOur identification strategy also assumes that the effect\nof having been interviewed before or after 31 January on\ntrust in politicians goes only through the treatment (condi-\ntional on covariates). This assumption could be threatened\nby other unobserved factors that might change through time\nand affect trust in politicians. To evaluate this threat, we\nsimulate 1000 placebo events that mimic our analyses of\nthe B\u00e1rcenas scandal (i.e. control group comprises 8 days\nbefore the event and treatment group comprises 28 days\nafter the event) but take place between 1 February and 14\nApril. We compare the effects of these placebo events with\nthose of the B\u00e1rcenas scandal. It is reasonable to expect that\na small proportion of the simulated events will produce\nresults that are similar to the ones obtained with the original\nevent, because some simulated events fall close to the date\nFigure 2. Change in trust in politicians at the time of the B\u00e1rcenas scandal.\n6 Research and Politics \nwhen the B\u00e1rcenas scandal was uncovered. The results of\nthe simulation add further plausibility to our causal esti-\nmate of the corruption scandal, since only 4.8% of the sim-\nulations produce a negative statistically significant effect\nsimilar to the one of the B\u00e1rcenas scandal (see appendix,\nsupplementary materials for further details). Besides the\nsimulation, we also assess the impact of the original treat-\nment Di\non alternative dependent variables that should not\nbe affected by the B\u00e1rcenas scandal, for which we do not\nfind any significant effect of the treatment (Table A5, sup-\nplementary materials).\nAs an additional robustness check, we replicate our\nanalyses using the seventh round of the ESS. Since no cor-\nruption scandal was uncovered during the first days of the\nfieldwork of the seventh round, and interviews started on\n23 January (like in the sixth round), this is an ideal way to\ntest that our findings are not driven by aspects related to the\ntiming of the fieldwork. We estimate the impact of a ficti-\nindicate that this event has no impact on trust in politicians\n(Table A6, supplementary materials). Furthermore, since\nthe fieldwork of ESS-6 in Denmark coincided with the\nfieldwork in Spain, we follow Pollock et al. (2015) and use\nDenmark as a counterfactual and test the impact of the\nB\u00e1rcenas scandal among Danes. The B\u00e1rcenas scandal had\nno impact on trust in politicians in Denmark (Table A6,\nsupplementary materials).\nFinally, we also consider alternative methods to estimate\nthe effects of the scandal. We estimate the effects through\ncoarsened exact matching and entropy balancing (Blackwell\nregression discontinuity design. The results obtained with\nthese methods lead us to the same conclusions (Tables A7,\nA8 and A9, supplementary materials).\nConclusion\nThe natural experiment exploited in this paper provided a\nunique opportunity to estimate the causal effect of a real\ncorruption scandal on trust in politicians with a great degree\nof internal and external validity. In line with institutional\ntheories, our results indicate that the corruption scandal\nTable 2. OLS regression models.

These\nresults diverge from Kumlin and Esaiasson's (2012), who\nconclude that political scandals involving only one party do\nnot influence attitudes towards the political system.\nThrough our design we also analyse the decay of the\neffect of the scandal. The results indicate that the impact\nof the corruption scandal on political trust was not long-\nlasting, since it influenced individuals' trust in politicians\nmore strongly in the weeks immediately following its dis-\nclosure. This finding might explain why corruption scan-\ndals have only a moderate or null influence on the electoral\nfortunes of corrupt politicians. This intuition seems to be\nsupported by the performance of the party involved in the\nThree years after the scandal was uncovered the PP lost\nsome support in these elections but remained the most\nvoted party.\nFinally, our results indicate that the effect of the corrup-\ntion scandal was not weaker among the supporters of the\nparty involved in the scandal. The low baseline levels of\ntrust in politicians in Spain prior to the scandal, especially\namong those who do not identify with the PP (average =\n2.1), could explain this null finding. Low levels of trust\nmight have predated the impact of the scandal for those not\nsupporting PP, since for them there was already little trust\nin politicians to be lost before the scandal.\n"
