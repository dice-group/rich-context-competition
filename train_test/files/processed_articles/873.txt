In\naddition, pharmaco-epidemiological studies can deter-\nmine whether medications increase or decrease the\nrisk of a given condition [1]. This is important in\ndementia or cognitive impairment because medica-\ntions may cause or exacerbate these conditions and\nmedications are among the most common causes of\nreversible confusional states in elderly people [5 - 7]. In\naddition, recent pharmaco-epidemiological studies\nhave suggested that certain medications, such as anti-\ninflammatory agents, may be protective against demen-\ntia or cognitive impairment [8-11]. These phenomena\ncan affect many elders given that estimates of the\nprevalence of dementia and cognitive impairment in\nHowever, few investigators have studied medica-\ntion use patterns in demented or cognitively impaired\ncommunity-dwelling elderly people. The few studies\nof medication use in demented subjects define\ndementia by clinical criteria and typically focus on\nAlzheimer's disease. In these studies, Alzheimer's\ndisease patients averaged fewer medications per\nperson and took more psychotropic medications\nthan old people who were cognitively intact [13-\n15]. Studies of medication use in cognitively impaired\npeople identify cognitive impairment in terms of\nscores below standardized cut-points on cognitive\nscreening tests. We reported that cognitively\nimpaired elderly subjects were significantly less\nlikely to use any prescription or non-prescription\n(or over-the-counter; OTC), medications than cogni-\ntively intact older people in the Duke Established\nPopulations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly\nNo studies have reported on medication use\npatterns across different levels of cognitive\nfunction (i.e. dementia, cognitive impairment but\nnot dementia and intact cognition) within a given\npopulation. In the present study we distinguished\ndementia from cognitive impairment and intact cog-\nnition in a subsample of Duke EPESE participants\nto examine medication use in these groups. The\nobjective of the study was to determine whether\npatterns of medication use among community-\ndwelling older people vary with level of cognitive\nfunction.\nMethods\nParticipants\nThe participants were selected sample members of the\nDuke EPESE [17, 18] who participated in a separate\nstudy of the incidence and prevalence of dementia in\nNorth Carolina, USA. The Duke EPESE conducted a\nand a second follow-up face-to-face interview in 1989-\nindependent dementia study was conducted after\ndementia study participants were selected by the\nfollowing criteria: (i) a two-point or greater decline\nbetween the first and second interview on the Short\nPortable Mental Status Questionnaire, a 10-item stand-\nardized cognitive screening instrument [19] or (ii) the\nneed for a proxy respondent at the second interview\nbut not the baseline interview. A 10% random sample\nof the remaining participants was also included. The\nselection procedure was intended to maximize the\npresence of persons with cognitive impairment and\ndementia and to identify a sample ofpersons who were\ncognitively intact.\nOfthe 3337 sample members of Duke EPESE seen in\nparticipants were excluded because they no longer\nlived in the interviewing catchment area, were too\nphysically ill to participate, were acutely disoriented or\nrefused. The current analysis is therefore based on 520\nparticipants.\nData collection\nData for this study came from the Duke EPESE and the\ndementia study. The Duke EPESE provided data on age,\nrace, sex and years of education [17]. The dementia\nstudy obtained separate data on current marital status,\nmedication use, cognition, basic activities of daily\nliving, eight common chronic health conditions,\nhospitalizations in the previous year and whether the\nparticipant had a regular primary-care phYSician. The\ndementia study interviewers administered a structured\nquestionnaire in the home to participants or inform-\nants, typically a close family member, to obtain the\ninformation.\nThe dementia study interviewers asked participants\nor informants to show them all prescription and OTC\nmedications taken in the past 2 weeks. OTC drugs are\nmedications that can be purchased without a prescrip-\ntion or doctor's orders (e.g. laxatives, analgesics). The\nname and dosage form of each medication taken in the\nprevious 2 weeks were recorded from the container. A\ntrained pharmacy technician assigned each medication\na unique four-digit generic code from the DPICS and\nINDPICS coding system [20] using a locally developed\ninteractive data-entry program [21]. The program\nnumerically coded each medication to indicate\nwhether it was a prescription or OTC product and\nassigned the medications to non-overlapping therapeu-\ntic medication classes based on American Hospital\nFormulary Service Drug Information [22].\nThe dementia study interviewers administered the\nConsortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's\nDisease (CERAD) neuropsychology battery to partici-\npants [23]. This test battery includes the Mini-Mental\nState Examination (MMSE) [24], a lO-item word list\nlearning, recall and recognition task, a measure of\nverbal fluency, confrontation naming (abbreviated 15-\nitem Boston naming test) and a constructional praxis\ntask. The clock drawing test, which is part of the\nCERAD clinical battery [23] was also included. Addi-\ntional information on memory, ability to perform\nactivities of daily living and change in personality was\nobtained from an informant.\nThe following criteria were used to refer a partici-\npant for a clinical dementia evaluation: a participant or\ninformant report of memory problems, an inadequate\nclock drawing, an MMSE score less than 24 for whites\nitems or less from the word list learning task [26] or the\ninterviewer's assessment that dementia was potentially\npresent. These criteria were designed to be broadly\ninclusive of potential dementia.\nDetermination of cognitive status\nDementia\nparticipants were recommended for a clinical evalua-\ntion for dementia. A geriatrician or specially trained\nclinical research nurse performed the dementia evalua-\ntion using the CERAD clinical battery, which was\ndesigned to assess Alzheimer's disease and expanded to\ninclude non-Alzheimer's disease dementias [23]. A\nneurologist, geriatrician and clinical research nurse\ndiagnosed dementia and its aetiology in 100 of the\n183 participants by clinical consensus using CERAD,\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-\nIV and modified National Institute of Neurological and\nCommunicative Disorders and Stroke- Alzheimer's\nDisease and Related Disorders Association criteria for\ndemented subjects, 69 had Alzheimer's disease, either\nalone or with additional components, 15 had vascular\ndementia, in some cases with additional factors but\nexcluding Alzheimer's disease, while 16 had other\nforms of dementia.\nCognitive impairment\nCognitive impairment, defined as abnormal responses\nto cognitive testing in persons without dementia, was\nCognitive function and medication use patterns\nascertained in the remaining 420 participants using the\nMMSE. The originally recommended and commonly\naccepted clinical cut-off point on the MMSE for\norder not to include cognitively intact elderly people\nwith little education in the cognitively impaired\nsample, we modified these cut-off points to reflect\nthe population-based age and education norms pub-\nlished by Crum et at. [29]. Once age and education\nhave been taken into account, the effect of race, while\nSince the median age for the participants fell\npro-rated the cut-off point identifying the 25th\npercentile for these two age groups, separately for\npercentile rather than a cut-off point based on the\nmean and standard deviation because the scores on the\nMMSE are not normally distributed. Using these cut-off\npoints, 117 participants were identified as cognitively\nimpaired. These cognitively impaired participants did\nnot meet criteria for dementia at the time of the study\nand constituted a group separate from the groups with\ndementia or intact cognition.\nCognitively intact\nThis was defined as no evidence for dementia or\ncognitive impairment after clinical examination or\nhaving an MMSE score above the indicated cut-off\npoints. Using this definition, 303 participants were\ncognitively intact.\nDependent variables\nWe were interested in the presence and extent of\nprescription and OTC medication use and had three\ntypes of dependent variables. First, we considered any\nuse of prescription medications versus no use and any\nuse of OTe medications versus no use. Second, we\nexamined the number of prescription or OTC medica-\ntions used. Thirdly, we examined prescription and OTe\nuse combined within major therapeutic classes.\nIndependent variables\nThe primary independent variable was cognitive status\n(dementia, cognitively impaired but not demented and\ncognitively intact). As covariates, we selected variables\nthat may be associated with medication use behaviour\nor possible confounders in order to control for them in\nthe analysis. The demographic variables were age\n(years), race (black, white), sex, education (years of\nschooling) and marital status (married, not married).\nPhysical functioning status was assessed by ability to\nindependently perform each of five activities of daily\nliving: bathing, grooming, dressing, transfer from bed\nto chair and feeding oneself [32, 33]. Subjects who\nK. E. Schmader et al.\nwere unable to perform one or more items indepen-\ndently were compared with those who could perform\nall items. Health status was assessed by the reported\npresence of each of eight common chronic health\nconditions (arthritis, cancer, diabetes, heart disease,\nhypertension, stroke, thyroid dysfunction and pulmon-\nary disorder) and by the total number of these\nconditions present. Health service use was assessed\nby two variables: hospitalization overnight in the\nprevious year and whether the participant had a\nregular primary-care physician.\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used for initial comparison\nof the cognitively intact, cognitively impaired and\ndemented. For univariate analyses, the X2 test was used\nfor categorical variables and analysis of variance\n(ANOVA) was used for continuous variables [34]. The\nassumption of normality for ANOVA was examined. For\nmultivariate analyses, logistic regression was used\nwhen the dependent variable was dichotomous (any\nmedication use versus non-use). Ordinary least-squares\nregression was used when the dependent variable was\ncontinuous (number of medications used) [35].\nThe multivariate regression models included the\ncovariates and two indicator variables that reflected\ncognitive status. The indicator variables were calcu-\nlated by orthogonal contrasts. The first indicator\ncontrasted a combined group of cognitively impaired\nand demented participants with the group of cogni-\ntively intact participants. The second variable con-\ntrasted the cognitively impaired with the demented\nparticipants. These two variables permit all compar-\nisons among the three groups to be examined. All of\nthe analyses were conducted using SAS software [36].\nResults\nParticipant characteristics by cognitive status are\npresented in Table 1. There were significant mean\nage differences between the three groups. The\ndemented group were, on average, the oldest (83\nyears) followed by the cognitively impaired (80 years)\nand cognitively intact (77 years) groups. The cogni-\ntively impaired subjects were the most likely (73.5%)\nand the cognitive intact were the least likely (52.8%) to\nbe black. Mean level of education differed significantly,\nthe demented population having on average the least\neducation (6.7 years) and the cognitively intact the\nmost education (8.8 years). Marital status followed a\nsimilar pattern, with those who were demented least\nlikely to be married 07%) and those who were\ncognitively intact the most likely to be married (38%).\nWith respect to health-related information, a signifi-\ncantly higher proportion of the demented subjects had\nimpairments in functional status.\nTable I.

There were no\nsignificant differences in hospitalization but registra-\ntion with a regular doctor was significantly less\nfrequent in the demented group than for members of\nthe other two groups.\nTable 2 provides information on medication use.\nAlthough the mean number of prescription medica-\ntions used was less in the demented group and a\nsmaller percentage of this group used any OTC\nmedications, the unadjusted analyses showed no\nstatistically significant differences between the three\ngroups in use of prescription, OTC or any medication.\nOverall, the proportion of participants using any\nmedication ranged from 87 to 93% and mean number\nof medications used ranged from 3.4 to 3.8.\nTable 3 shows the association between level of\ncognitive function and prescription medication use,\nadjusting for other factors. There were no significant\ndifferences among the demented, cognitively impaired\nand cognitively intact groups in the relative odds of\nusing any prescription medications. However, the\ndemented group took significantly fewer prescription\nmedications than the cognitively impaired group.\nTable 4 shows the adjusted associations between\nlevel of cognitive function and OTC medication use.\nThere were significant differences among the three\ngroups in the relative odds of using any OTC\nmedications, with those who were demented or\ncognitively impaired less likely to be taking such\nproducts than the cognitively intact group, and the\ndemented group less likely to do so than the\ncognitively impaired group. The combined group of\ndemented and cognitively impaired took significantly\nfewer OTC medications than the cognitively intact\ngroup.\nTable 5 shows the association between use of\nmedications by level of cognitive function and the\nmost common therapeutic classes taken by the study\nparticipants. The demented people took fewer cardio-\nvascular or analgesic medications but more central\nnervous system medications than either cognitively\nimpaired or cognitively intact people. The use of\nthese three therapeutic classes was examined in\nmultivariate analyses (Table 6). Overall, the comhined\nTable 3.

This level of use was higher than that\nreported previously for patients with dementia or\nAlzheimer's disease [13-15]. When the demented\ngroup were differentiated from the cognitively\nimpaired, demented people took significantly fewer\nprescription medications than those who were cogni-\ntively impaired. There are several possible explanations\nfor the use of fewer prescription medications by\nsubjects with dementia. People with dementia may\nnot report treatable conditions, or those conditions\nmay go unrecognized by clinicians or family members.\nSome dementia patients may be resistant to taking\nmedications or more prone to adverse drug effects. For\nwhatever reason, they may not see a physician\nregularly-an explanation supported by the signifi-\ncantly higher proportion of dementia patients who did\nnot have a regular primary-care physician in this study.\nIn terms of OTC medication use, those with\ndementia were Significantly less likely to take any\nOTC medications and took fewer OTC medications\nthan those who were cognitively impaired but not\ndemented. Dementia may prevent patients from\nperforming the functional and cognitive tasks neces-\nsary to obtain OTC medications, or they may have\nfewer conditions that are amenable to OTC medica-\ntions. Alternatively, caregivers may not be aware of\nconditions treatable by OTC medications in these\npatients or may be concerned about their adverse\neffects. However, the underlying reason for this could\nnot be ascertained from the study data.\nConsistent with previous studies, we found the most\nfrequently used therapeutic classes of medications in\ndemented people were, in rank order: cardiovascular,\nanalgesic, gastrointestinal, nutritional and central\nTable 5.

Multivariate analysis revealed\nthat demented people were significantly less likely\nthan the cognitively impaired to be taking analgesics or .\ncardiovascular medications. The analgesic result was\nthe most striking and concurs with previous studies\n[14-16). It is possible that dementia patients may\nunderreport pain or express pain in atypical ways\nand/or clinicians may undertreat pain in dementia\n[37). Another interpretation is that demented partici-\npants (the majority of whom had Alzheimer's disease)\nwere less likely to have arthritis, a leading indication\nfor analgesic medications [10). Alternatively, the\nhigher use of analgesics by those who were not\ndemented may represent a protective etIect of certain\ndiseases or the medications used to treat them. This\nexplanation is consistent with a growing literature on\nthe protective effect of anti-inflammatory medications\non the development of Alzheimer's disease and also\nwith a lower than expected prevalence of Alzhei-\nmer's disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis\nIt is important to recognize potential limitations of\nthe study. The cross-sectional study design precluded\nany conclusions about causality, making it impossible\nto tell whether dementia or cognitive impairment\ncaused or was the result of differences in medication\nuse among the groups. Also, medications were\ncategorized into broad therapeutic classes which did\nnot allow for examination of individual medications\nfor specific indications. Misclassification of cases of\ndementia or cognitive impairment is a potential\nconcern but the study employed well-established,\nreliable, valid criteria to differentiate the groups [24,\n27 - 29). Some of the cognitively impaired participants\nmay have underlying pathology that will eventually\nlead to a diagnosis of dementia and theretore represent\ngraded impairment between the groups. However, at\nthe time of the study they did not meet standardized\ncriteria for dementia. The selection process from the\nEPESE sample resulted in 520 partiCipants, which may\nhave limited our statistical power to detect significant\ndifferences in the use of medications among the three\ngroups where none was found. Finally, a study of\ncommunity-dwelling elders living in the south-eastern\nUSA may not be representative of other populations\nwhich may have different patterns of medication\nprescribing and OTC medication use.\nIn conclusion, findings from this study suggest that\ndemented community-dwelling elderly people are less\nlikely to be users of OTC, analgesic and cardiovascular\nmedication than those who are cognitively impaired\nbut not demented or those who are cognitively intact.\nFuture research is needed to examine longitudinal\nmedication use patterns and the use of specific\nmedication classes for specific diseases in larger\nsamples. Such research will be useful to confirm\nthese results and, if they are confirmed, to determine\nthe appropriateness of this variation in medication use\npatterns.\n"
