The epidemiologic characteristics of NTM diseases including mortality rate and its associated factors remain largely\nunknown. In this study, we explored the geographical area of exposure and mortality and comorbid conditions of affected\npersons to determine environment, host, and host-pathogen interactive factors.\nMethods: We analyzed mortality related to nontuberculous mycobacterial infections from 1999 through 2010 by examining\nmultiple-cause-of-death data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Among those who died with these diseases, we\nanalyzed age-adjusted mortality rates, trends, associations with demographic variables, and comorbid conditions and\ncorrelated this information with similar data for tuberculosis-related mortality during the same time.\nMeasurements and Mean Results: From 1999 through 2010, nontuberculous mycobacterial disease was reported as an\nimmediate cause of death in 2,990 people in the United States with a combined overall mean age-adjusted mortality rate of\n(R2 = 0.72, p,0.0001), but it was not significant after adjustment for age. Persons aged 55 years and older, women, those\nliving in Hawaii and Louisiana, and those of non-Hispanic, white ethnicity had higher mortality rates. Compared to\ntuberculosis-related mortality, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, HIV, interstitial lung diseases, and\ntobacco use were significantly more common in persons with nontuberculous mycobacteria-related deaths.\nConclusions: Nontuberculous mycobacteria-related death numbers are rising and are unevenly distributed. The strong\nassociation of nontuberculous mycobacterial disease with age suggests that its prevalence will increase as the United States\npopulation ages.\nCitation: Mirsaeidi M, Machado RF, Garcia JGN, Schraufnagel DE (2014) Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Disease Mortality in the United States, 1999\u00ad2010: A\nEditor: Jean Louis Herrmann, Hopital Raymond Poincare - Universite Versailles St. Quentin, France\nCopyright: \u00df 2014 Mirsaeidi et al.

[1] The organisms also vary\nwidely in their ability to cause disease. This variation has been\nlong suspected to be caused by environmental factors, but as\ninfection rates have increased with no obvious environmental\nsource host factors are believed to be more and more important in\npathogenesis of NTM infections. More specifically, host-organism\ninteraction can be caused by a specific type of environmental\nexposure, such as contact with a respirable aerosol or from a\nspecific host factor, such as stagnant mucus in a bronchiectatic\nThe increase in NTM infections in recent years is remarkable.\nThe prevalence of diseases caused by these organisms was reported\nrecent North American studies have reported a higher prevalence\ninfections caused by NTM are increasing in North America,\nespecially in people over 50 years of age. [5,6,7] In these North\nAmerican settings, the burden of nontuberculous mycobacterial\ndisease exceeds that of tuberculosis. [8] The basis for this increase\nis unclear. Some speculate that improvements in diagnostics\nsecondary to the development and widespread utilization of\ndiagnostic support tools like computerized tomography (CT) scans\nor new laboratory methods has led to the identification of more\ncases that would have otherwise been misdiagnosed or overlooked.\nAnother possibility could be less ``herd immunity'' because of\ndecreasing rates of tuberculosis and less use of the Bacille\nCalmette-Gue\n\u00b4rin (BCG) vaccine. [9,10] Also, the increase in\nnumber of immunocompromised hosts is suggested to be another\ncontributing factor. [11] It is also assumed that the rise in NTM\ninfections is congruent with the worldwide Human immunodefi-\nciency virus (HIV) epidemic as well as scientific advancements\nleading to the more widespread use of chemotherapy and organ\nEpidemiologic factors of NTM diseases are particularly\nimportant in diagnosis and management when compared to other\ndiseases. NTM diseases frequently present at various points of\ndisease severity ranging from asymptomatic to critical and at risk\nof death. In many cases, demographic, geographic, and comorbid\nhost factors may determine where one falls within this range.This\nstudy was designed to determine the trend of NTM-related\nmortality in the last decade and related comorbidities. We also\naimed to discover current national and state prevalence and\nmortality rates and to learn the demographic, geographic, and\ncomorbid conditions compared with persons suffering from\ntuberculosis. Understanding these relationships could help to\ndefine high-risk groups for death and develop strategies for\ntargeting prevention, treatment, and treatment intensity.\nMaterials and Methods\nThis study was reviewed and approved by Institutional Review\nBoard of University of Illinois at Chicago (approval number of\nStudy Design and Patient Data\nThis was a retrospective, population-based comparative study of\nmultiple causes of death data from the death certificates in USA\nranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER)\nprepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nThe death certificates provided information on characteristics of\nthe decedent, including age at death, gender, race, and conditions\nthat led to death. Death certificates show a single underlying cause\nof death (immediate cause of death), up to twenty comorbidities,\nand demographic information. Diseases and related conditions\nreported on the death certificate are coded in accordance with the\nInternational Classification of Diseases, 10th Revisions (ICD-10)\nStudy's Variables\nVariables included in the analysis were age, gender, race-\nethnicity, year of death, urbanization, place of death, cause of\ndeath, and comorbid conditions. Race-ethnicity was categorized\naccording to US census standards as non-Hispanic white,\nHispanic, Asian-Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic black (black), and\nAmerican Indian-Alaska Native (Native American). Age at death\nThe place of death was categorized as the hospital, the\ndecedent's home, hospice, and nursing home-long term care\nfacility. To find an association between the urbanization level of\nresidence and NTM-related mortality, the National Center for\nHealth Statistics (NCHS) urban-rural classification was applied.\nUrbanization was classified as 1) large central metropolitan, which are\ncounties with $1 million population that have the entire\npopulation in a major city, or contain at least 250,000 residents\nof any main city, 2) large fringe metro, which are counties with $1\nmillion residents but do not meet the central metropolitan criteria,\nthe metro criteria, and 6) noncore, which are rural counties. [17,18].\nStudy Definitions\nNTM-related mortality was defined as the immediate cause of\ndeath from pulmonary or extrapulmonary nontuberculous myco-\nbacterial infection. This included all observations that assigned any\nof the ICD A31 codes as the immediate cause of death.\nTuberculosis-related mortality was defined by an immediate cause\nStatistical Analysis\nCounts and percentages were examined as predictors using\ncrude odds ratios and were tested by x2 tests or, if applicable, exact\ntests. The crude mortality rate was not used in this study because\nof the potential misleading information resulting from comparing\nrates over the time in different age groups. Age-specific\ntuberculosis-related mortality rates and 95% confidence intervals\n(CIs) were calculated for each age group. Age-adjusted mortality\nrates were applied to measure relative mortality risk among groups\nand over time. The selected population for the computation of\nUnivariate linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate\nthe mortality from nontuberculous mycobacteria- and tuberculo-\nIn order to examine comorbid conditions, we compared NTM-\nrelated deaths with tuberculosis-related deaths from 1999 through\n2010 and computed crude odds ratio (OR) comparisons of selected\ncomorbidities. Data were suppressed by NCHS when the data\nindicating fewer than ten persons to meet the principles for\nconfidentiality limitations. Death rates were labeled as ``unreli-\nable'' when the numerator was less than 21.

The tuberculosis-related\nmortality was strikingly different. Alaska had the highest age-\ntimes more than the highest NTM-related age-adjusted rate (in\nHawaii). After Alaska, the highest age-adjusted mortality rates for\ntuberculosis occurred in the District of Colombia, California,\nTexas, Louisiana, and New Mexico (Figure 5).\nNTM-related Mortality and Place of Death\nWhen comparing NTM-related mortality by place of death, the\nmajority of deaths occurred in hospitals (55%), nursing homes or\nlong-term care facilities (12%), and in the decedents' homes (23%).\nAmong people who died from tuberculosis, significantly more\nindividuals died in hospitals (76%) and fewer died in nursing\nhomes or long term care facilities (7%), and at home (11%).

There was a significant difference\nin mortality rate of large central metropolitan between NTM and\nTo investigate the reason for the differences, we hypothesized\nthat access to a hospital might have been an important factor. We,\ntherefore, compared the frequency of place of death in NTM-\nrelated deaths by urbanization categories. The percentage of\npersons who died in hospitals with NTM as the cause of death was\n62% in large central metropolitan areas, 58% in large fringe\nmetropolitan areas, 55% in medium metropolitan areas, 80% in\nsmall metropolitan areas, 52% in micropolitan areas, and 64% in\nnon-core areas.\nNTM-related Deaths and Involved Organs\nand in 515 (17.2%) the organs involved were not specified.

Medium\nsize metro and smaller areas have more than 50% of NTM related\ndeaths. The majority of NTM related deaths occur in the hospital\nsetting although this is less likely in small (micropolitan) cities.\nAlthough, we found no meaningful difference for NTM related\nmortality as was observed difference for TB related mortality on\nurbanization.\ncohort, the median age was 66 years and 59% were women. [5] A\nrecent nationwide study in the US by Adjemian et al. showed the\nprevalence of NTM disease was increasing across all regions in the\namong patients whom covered by Federal Health Insurance\nProgram (Medicare beneficiaries). The period prevalence for this\npersons).\nOur study also demonstrates the increase in numbers of NTM-\nassociation between NTM death and age, consistent with the\nanalogous association between NTM prevalence and age. Given\nthe increasing median age in North America, the prevalence and\nmortality of the mycobacterial disease will most probably increase.\n[22] In fact, the current increase in NTM disease in North\nAmerica and the world could be explained, in part, by aging\nFigure 2. Number of NTM-related deaths stratified by age and gender United States, 1999\u00ad2010.\nFigure 3. Number of tuberculosis-related deaths stratified by age and gender United States, 1999\u00ad2010.\nNontuberculous Mycobacterial-Related Mortality\nLegend: Alaska had NTM related mortality less than 9, therefore data were suppressed to meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints.\nNontuberculous Mycobacterial-Related Mortality\nOur study also points out the strong correlations between\nNTM-related mortality with many other medical conditions. The\ncorrelation with smoking, hematologic malignancy and HIV is\nstronger than with tuberculosis. As these chronic conditions\nincrease, the risk of death from nontuberculous mycobacterial\ninfection increases. It is important to note that many of the\nassociated conditions involve mucus pooling in the airways or\ndecrease clearance. The overwhelming percentage of disease being\nconfined to the lung also favors an airway defense mechanism\ndefect as a cause of NTM-disease.\nAlthough tuberculosis-related deaths in the United States are\nsharply decreasing and NTM-related deaths are increasing, NTM-\nrelated mortality is much less than that of tuberculosis despite\nhigher prevalence of the environmental mycobacterial disease. [6]\nOne explanation for this discrepancy is that tuberculosis figures\nare more likely to be accurate due to public health reporting\nrequirements. NTM diseases are not reported to public health\ndepartments which this has led many to speculate that NTM-\ndisease is likely to be substantially underreported. Additionally,\nmissed diagnoses in mild and asymptomatic NTM subjects may\nalso decrease the number of the recorded cases. This occurs less\nlikely for tuberculosis infections due to its uniformly virulent\nnature. [24] Finally, NTM may be a chronic and uncommonly\nfatal disease, with significant morbidity but relatively low\nmortality.\nAlthough pathogen-host factors are important, there is geo-\ngraphical variation in NTM-related mortality. The southeast has\nlong been known to have a higher prevalence of NTM, which may\nbe attributed to its warmer and more humid climate. [25] Other\nstudies have shown coastal area had greater number of cases,\nraising the conjecture that these mycobacteria flourished in wetter\nclimates. [20] But our study showed that states with the drier\nweather, such as California, Arizona and New Mexico, also had\nhigh NTM-related mortality rates. Our findings are consistent by\nanother NTM study. [21] Therefore, we believe that both warm\nand dry climates may contribute to NTM disease and influence on\nmortality by different environmental factors, such as temperature,\nsoil and water conditions. Our study also suggests that living\nenvironment and possibly ethnicity contribute to NTM-related\nmortality. Our finding suggests that NTM related mortality is\ninfluenced much more by living in Hawaii than by being Asian/\nPacific islander. Some of NTM-related deaths occurred in rural\ncounties in our study. Rural communities may be associated with\nmore contact to water and soil in rural agricultural settings [26] or\nless access to health care expertise, undermining the proper\nidentification and management of NTM cases.\nNTM demonstrated a strong relationship with some comorbid\nconditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic\nrespiratory failure, bronchiectasis, HIV, interstitial lung diseases,\nrheumatoid arthritis, hematopoietic malignancies and tobacco use.\nIn comparison, tuberculosis is strongly associated with smoking,\nHIV and hematopoietic malignancies, and may cause bronchiec-\ntasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The association\nbetween aging and NTM might be explained by more prevalence\nof these chronic medical conditions in the elderly. In addition, the\nfeatures of these conditions can play an important role in the\npathogenesis of NTM diseases. For instance, bronchiectasis is a\nknown lung abnormality that makes patient susceptible to NTM.\nThe main components of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nare emphysema and chronic bronchitis, although bronchiectasis is\noften present and unrecognized. [30] The association with\nTable 2.

The role of decreased airflow and\ncough pressure in the pathogenesis of NTM disease is unknown.\nPrimary immunodeficiency is another condition that was found\nin a few individuals in NTM-related deaths group. Although\ndefense against mycobacterium invasion relies on innate and\nadaptive immunity [31], the small percentage of persons with\nknown immune deficiencies diagnosed with NTM forces us to\nconsider that structural defects of the epithelial barrier in addition\nto immune status may be a contributor. Bronchiectasis, for\nexample, is associated with primary immunodeficiency and other\nconditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis. [32,33].\nThe use of death certificate data is perhaps the most important\nlimitation of this study. Death certificates are well known to\nmisclassify variables. [34] In our study, we found that death\ncertificate records were often unclear regarding whether the\nperson died from mycobacterial disease or another cause of death.\nDue to the less severe disease presentation which is common in\nNTM, clinicians may not consider mycobacterial infections the\nimmediate causes of death or an important underlying condition\nwhen completing death certificate. It is likely that physicians do\nnot check the American Thoracic Society criteria for NTM disease\nbefore filling out the death certification. We believe that these poor\ndocumentations have a significant impact on NTM death\ncertificates database. Unfortunately, death certificates database\nfor NTM remains one of the more reliable data sources. Using\nICD codes to detect nontuberculous mycobacterial disease may\ncause missing 25% to 75% of the cases. [35] Given the severe\nnature and clinical awareness for tuberculosis, it is unlikely that\nprimary data in this arm is equally unrepresented. Physicians are\nmore aware of tuberculosis because it is communicable, and\nreportable which requires health system monitoring. Therefore, it\nis much more likely to be reported accurately. Because environ-\nmental mycobacterial disease lacks these features, especially\nvirulency, we think our data most likely represent an underesti-\nmate of true magnitude of the NTM mortality. Therefore, our\nfindings might be interpreted as minimum estimates.\nIn summary, this United States population-based study shows\nthat the number of deaths from nontuberculous mycobacterial\ndisease is rising, but this increase is largely explained by the change\nin age distribution of the US population. There is considerable\nvariation in different groups, which could be due to environment,\nhost and host-pathogen interactive factors.\n"
