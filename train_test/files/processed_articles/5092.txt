Nurses who do\nengage in policy often do so through participation in their\nemployers' policy committees or through supporting nursing\nprofessional organizations (Mechanic & Reinhard, 2002).\nProfessional nursing organizations worldwide have man-\ndates and processes for nurses to engage at some level in\npolicy development (American Nurses Association [ANA],\nNurses Association [CNA], 2012; Royal College of Nursing\n[RCN], 2012). However, despite the efforts of professional\nnursing organizations, it is still challenging to encourage\nnurses to be politically active and to engage in health policy\nissues for a variety of reasons (Vandenhouten, Malakar,\nKubsch, & Gallagher-Lepak, 2011). Cited barriers to nursing\ninvolvement in health policy include a lack of political\nawareness and understanding of the importance of being\ninvolved in nursing organizations, time to engage in policy\ndevelopment outside of nursing work, and resources to\ndevelop skills in policy participation (Boswell, Cannon, &\nto registered nurses' (RNs) perception that their role is to\nexclusively provide patient care, which leads to their inabil-\nity to see the \"big picture\" beyond the bedside regarding the\nfactors that determine how health care services are\ndistributed and how policies are generated and reformed\n(Cramer, 2002). Nurses also do not have a clear understand-\ning of how they can inform discussions of health care ser-\nvices planning and delivery and often see this as the \"decision\nmakers\" job (Hewison, 2008; Maslin-Prothero, Ed, &\nMasterson, 2002). To be successful in political engagement,\nnurses must understand both the policy process and how to\ninfluence key decision makers. Professional nursing organi-\nzations could play a key role in helping to bridge these gaps,\nso nurses, in whatever role and sector they work in, can be\nactively engaged in health policy to positively affect the pro-\nfession and the health of their country's citizens.\nWhile nurses make up the largest group of health care\nproviders in most developed countries, they often do not\nengage in health policy, political participation, or political\nsame year there were 68,000 physicians in Canada (Canadian\n1Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nCristina Catallo, Associate Professor, Daphne Cockwell School of\nNursing, Ryerson University, 350 Victoria Street, POD 470B, Toronto,\nEmail: ccatallo@ryerson.ca\nNursing Professional Organizations: What\nAre They Doing to Engage Nurses in\nHealth Policy?\nCristina Catallo1, Karen Spalding1, and Roya Haghiri-Vijeh1\n Keywords\nnursing, political engagement, political action, professional bodies, health policy\n2 SAGE Open\nratio of nurses to physicians. Comparable ratios exist in other\ndeveloped countries with 3.1 million nurses in the United\nAssociation, 2010) resulting in just over 3 to 1 ratio of nurses\nand Australian Institute of Health and Wellness, 2012). Even\nthough the number of nurses far outpaces the number of phy-\nsicians, it continues to be the medical profession that has the\ndominant voice and therefore influence when it comes to\ndecisions related to health policy and health system changes.\nThere have been many authors who have written about this\ndomination, and although not the focus of this article, it is\nimportant to highlight that if more nurses were politically\nengaged what difference they could make (Lewis, 2010;\nAs pointed out, a key mechanism for political engage-\nment of nurses is through national organizations that are\nmembers of the International Council of Nurses (ICN).\nHowever, in Canada, for example, there are approximately\nCNA. According to MacDonald, Edwards, Davies, Marck,\nand Guernsey (2012), low levels of member participation in\nnursing organizations limit the overall impact that nursing\norganizations can make on health and nursing policy issues.\nNursing professional organizations, such as the ANA, the\nCNA, the Australian College of Nurses (CAN), and the\nUnited Kingdom's Royal College of Nurses, represent nurses\non policy issues and can engage nurses to be politically\nactive at the national and international levels. For example,\nthe CNA has various forums to give nursing a voice at a\nnational level and provide \"tools\" for nurses to have an\nimpact on policy decisions, and the ANA offers RNs support\non how to be politically active and lobby the government. A\nfeature of some national- and international-level professional\nnursing associations is to make available key research evi-\ndence about promising nursing practices as well as ideas\nabout improving the health and health care system that nurses\ncould utilize in trying to influence decision makers. One way\nfor professional nursing associations to be involved is to\noffer opportunities for nursing knowledge and expertise to be\nshared with government officials and the policy community\nthrough think-tank sessions, national task groups, and sum-\nmits. This would allow nurses to contribute to the shaping of\npolicy ideas and plans for engaging policymakers. In addi-\ntion to engaging nurses to become politically active, a key\nfunction of the national and international nursing profes-\nsional organization is to develop policy products such as\nbriefing notes, position statements, and research summaries\non pressing current health care policy issues to support poli-\ncymaker decision making.\nOne strategy for nurses to engage in health and nursing\npolicy issues is through accessing a national professional\nnursing organization--often through the first point of\nentry--the organization's website. However, little is known\nabout the web-based strategies that national nursing organi-\nzations use to engage nurses in health and nursing policy\nissues. Despite a thorough search of the literature, no research\nstudies were found on this issue to inform our article. The\nmajority of articles describing political engagement among\nnurses were greater than 5 years of age, indicating a limited\namount of research on this topic. Research is needed to better\nunderstand what priority setting strategies, policy products,\nand web-based mechanisms that national nursing organiza-\ntions use on their websites to engage nurses in health and\nnursing policy issues.\nPurpose of Study\nThe purpose of this study was to examine, through the review\nof websites, how national professional nursing organizations\nengage nurses in health and nursing policy. We examined\nwebsites for the following four activities: (a) policy priority\nsetting strategies, (b) policy goals and objectives, (c) policy\nproducts, and (d) mechanisms for engaging nurses in policy\nissues.\nMethod\nDesign\nThis study utilized a \"systematic website review\" of interna-\ntional- and national-level professional nursing organizations.\nWhile there is no formalized method for a \"website review,\"\nwe chose to undertake a systematic process which we called\na \"systematic website review.\" Unique to our process was the\nuse of inclusion/exclusion criteria, two data extractors to\nindependently extract data, and a matrix to record data\nextraction.\nSampling and Procedures\nIdentification, inclusion, and data extraction from websites\ninvolved a systematic and iterative process involving two\nreviewers (C.C., R.H.V.) using a third reviewer (K.S.), if\nneeded, when disagreement arose that could not be resolved\nthrough discussion. All disagreements between the two\nreviewers were resolved through discussion. Two reviewers\n(C.C., R.H.V.) independently identified potentially relevant\ninternational- and national-level professional nursing organi-\nzations using the following Internet search engines: Google\nand Yahoo. A matrix was created to record the websites for\ninternational-level professional nursing organizations and\nnational-level professional nursing organizations in North\nAmerica (e.g., United States, Canada), Europe, and the South\nPacific (e.g., Australia and New Zealand). Using this matrix,\nthe reviewers recorded the organization website and scored\neach against the following eligibility criteria: (a) websites in\nEnglish or enough pages translated into English that data\ncould be extracted, (b) websites that were professional\nCatallo et al. 3\nnursing organizations at the international and/or national\nlevel, (c) professional nursing organizations that focused on\nthe advancement of the nursing profession as a whole as\nopposed to specific sub-specialties or topical issues in nurs-\ning, and (d) professional nursing organizations that focus on\nmore than regulatory, licensure, or union/labor issues but\nalso considered other nursing and health care issues, and/or\nnursing and health policy issues. We decided to focus on\nthose national- and international-level organizations that\nconcentrated their mandates and activities across multiple\nnursing issues that could have an impact on the profession as\na whole, as well as nursing and health policy, as opposed to\nthose organizations whose emphasis is on the advancement\nof clinical sub-specialties. While these specialty organiza-\ntions are also important, their focus varies widely and it is\nsometimes difficult to assess the impact that these sub-spe-\ncialty organizations might have on health policy reform and/\nor changes to the profession overall. Organizations that met\nthese four criteria as determined by the two reviewers were\nincluded in the website review and will be referred to as\n\"included organizations\" throughout the article.\nData Extraction\nWe created a data extraction tool for the two reviewers (C.C.,\nR.H.V.) to independently extract data from the included orga-\nnizations. A guide for data extraction is provided in Table 1.\nThe following types of information were collected using our\ndata extraction tool: (a) level of the organization (e.g., inter-\nnational, national, country name); (b) name and website of\nthe professional nursing organization; (c) organization's\nvision; (d) organization's mission; (e) organization's man-\ndate, objective, and goals; (f) specific policy goals; (g) policy\nproducts; (h) webpages focused on political activity; and (i)\nmechanisms for nurses to engage in political activities. A\nsample data extraction tool is provided in Table 2. For the\norganization's mission and vision, we sought to identify any\nstrategic planning documents or materials that discussed how\nthe organizations determined which issues they selected for\npriority and focus for policy advocacy. For the organization's\nmandate, we recorded when the website discussed any legis-\nlation governing the organization's activities or goals and\nwhether or not the organization focused on nursing issues,\npublic interest issues, or both. We defined policy products to\ninclude any document that presented a nursing or health pol-\nicy issue and a nursing response to the issue such as briefing\nnotes, fact sheets, and position statements. We extracted data\non political activities carried out by the professional nursing\norganizations and the nature of these activities such as bring-\ning awareness to a policy issue, political advocacy, and the\nengagement of nurses. Finally, we identified the types of\nmechanisms that organizations used to engage nurses in polit-\nical action such as petition signing, rallies, and presentations.\nWhile data extraction was completed, the two reviewers met\nto review each independent extraction for consistency and\nthoroughness. Using the two extraction templates, a final\nTable 1.

Data were then coded and\nentered into SPSS Version 20.0 according to the categories of\nthe data extraction tool.\nData Analysis\nDescriptive statistics using SPSS were conducted for the\norganizations to give a summary of the policy priorities,\ngoals, products, and mechanisms used by organizations for\nengaging nurses in policy issues. Qualitative information\ncontained in the data extraction templates was analyzed\nusing a constant comparison method to identify the main\nareas addressed by professional nursing organization and the\npresentation of gaps when seeking to engage nurses in nurs-\ning and health-policy-related issues.\nResults\nOur review resulted in 38 international- or national-level\nprofessional nursing organizations being selected for poten-\ntial eligibility. Using our eligibility criteria, 15 organizations\nAmong the included organizations, three organizations\nfocused on international-level nursing issues, two were at the\nNorth American level, one focused on Australia and\nrepresented our South Pacific category, and nine focused on\nEuropean-level professional nursing issues. Among the\nexcluded organizations, one from New Zealand did not pos-\nsess more than a webpage and no other information about the\norganization to support inclusion. The remaining excluded\norganizations (n = 22) were from European countries and\nwere found to be ineligible because the professional nursing\norganizations' websites lacked at least one of the following\ncharacteristics: a description of the organization and its\nactivities (n = 6), webpages presented in English (n = 9),\ncomplete translation of all webpages in English (only a few\nwebpages were presented in English and we could not evalu-\nate inclusion; n = 2), focus on nursing or health policy issues\n(main focus was on nursing regulatory or union/labor issues;\nTable 3 outlines the frequency with which included orga-\nnizations described their vision, mission, mandate, specific\npolicy goals, and products and mechanisms for nurses to\nbecome politically engaged through the organization. The\nmajority of included organizations provided a statement of\nvision, mission, and an overall mandate. Few included orga-\nnizations outlined the process used to identify nursing policy\nissues for priority, specific organizational goals related to\nnursing or health policy, policy products or mechanisms for\nRNs to become politically engaged.

Upon\nreview of policy products, ICN provides position statements,\nfact sheets, press releases, and presentations on some of its\ntopics. ICN offers opportunities for nurses to engage in net-\nworks, and one network in particular is focused on nurse poli-\nticians. The ICN website lists events such as upcoming\nconferences and their location.\nCanadian Nurses Association (CAN)/Association Des Infirmi\u00e8res\net Infirmers Du Canada.The CNA describes a mission and\nvision that includes discussion of political advocacy with a\nfocus on healthy public policy and a quality health care sys-\nincluding a goal specific to advancing health public policy at\nnational and international levels. The CNA provides a pub-\nlicly available annual report which outlines the organiza-\ntion's accomplishments in the past year, including how it has\nadvocated for public policy such as encouraging nurses to\nengage in debate during the national election, discussions on\nhealth care system transformation, NP legislation, and nurs-\ning regulation issues. The CNA devotes a section of its web-\nsite, which is named \"On the Issues,\" to outline specific\npolicy goals and describes the areas of nursing and health\ncare policy where it focuses its activities. Some of these\nactivities include a national expert commission to explore\nnursing contributions to the health care system, staffing and\npatient outcomes, emergency preparedness, interprofessional\npractice, chronic disease prevention, healthy aging, and\npharmaceutical access. The CNA has webpages focused spe-\ncifically on the organization's political action activities and\nthe process that it uses to engage health policymakers. Nurses\nare invited to be politically involved with the CNA's activi-\nties with detailed instructions for writing letters to political\nrepresentatives, working with the news media, and meeting\nwith policymakers. Policy products include CNA open let-\nters, position statements, briefing notes, research summaries,\nand fact sheets.\nAmerican Nurses Association (ANA). The vision and mission of\nthe ANA includes a discussion of policy advocacy to pro-\nmote the rights of the nurse in the workplace, the image of\nnurses, and lobbying government for changes on nursing and\nhealth-related issues. A summary of the past year's annual\nreport is provided online and discusses political advocacy\nactivities such as lobbying for the \"Affordable Care Act,\"\nrepresentation of nurses in Accountable Care Organizations\nand for reimbursement to advanced practice RNs. The ANA\nhas webpages dedicated to policy and advocacy, and these\nprovide downloadable testimonies that the ANA has pre-\nsented before congress on various topics such as the clean air\nact, Medicaid, Health Care Reform, Clean Water Act, and\nNursing Workforce Development Programs. Policy products\nthat theANAoffers include a \"policy activist tool kit\" (ANA,\n2012b). As part of this tool kit, RNs are provided with\nresources that include how to get involved in a political cam-\npaign, writing letters to the editor, how to engage politicians\nand carry out lobbying activities. From the political activist\ntool kit website, RNs can seek to sign up for the ANA's\nNurses Strategic Action Team to help nurses engage across\nthe United States.\nAustralian College of Nursing (ACN). The ACN is an organiza-\ntion which has formed after the merger of the Royal College\nof Nurses Australia (RCNA) and The College of Nurses\n(TCoN). The vision, mission, and mandates of the ACN refer\nto advancing the nursing role in health policy through advo-\ncacy. From a publically available annual report from 2011,\nthe ACN cites activities related to influencing policy devel-\nopment and formation and advocating for nursing-related\nissues (Royal Colleges of Nurses of Australia, 2011). The\nACN's ongoing policy activities include lobbying political\nleaders and decision makers, providing feedback for health\nsector consultations, and participating in a range of high-\nlevel national, states, territories, and non-government com-\nmittees significant to the nursing and health professions and\nencourages and supports its members to submit articles for\npublications. The ACN's website provides policy products\nsuch as guidelines for nurses interested in lobbying activi-\nties, position statements, fact sheets, and invites its members\nto apply to advisory committees with potential to affect pol-\nicy decisions.\nEuropean Forum of National Nursing and Midwidery Associa-\ntions (EFNNMA). The EFNNMA was created in November\nciations and World Health Organization (WHO; 2012)\nwith a signed declaration to join in action of promoting\nhealth and health care in Europe. Their aim and mission is\nto strengthen and promote the exchange of information,\nideas, and policies between national nursing/midwifery\nassociations and WHO. The EFNNMA also strives to inte-\ngrate appropriate policies, to formulate policy statements\nand recommendations on health of the population at a\nnational level, and to initiate projects of evidence-based\npractice for nurses and midwifery. The EFNNMA claims\nthat each year they focus on one theme then formulates a\nstatement on it and works with nursing and midwifery\nassociations to take forward their recommendations to\naffect the national policy and practice. The recent years'\nfocus of themes has been international code on recruitment\nof health personnel, stewardship and governance, health\nsystems, health and wealth, HIV/AIDs, maternal, child and\nadolescent health with a focus on obesity, and mental\nhealth. Areas not well described include the mechanisms\nfor nurses to engage in political activities and publically\navailable policy-related products. While we were able to\nlocate a few reports, other policy products were not dis-\nplayed on the EFNNMA website.\nCatallo et al. 7\nRoyal College of Nursing (RCN).The RCN's vision and mis-\nsion involves the interest of the diverse voice of nurses by\ninfluencing and implementing policy through lobby govern-\nment and stakeholders to improve the quality of patient's\noutcome. RCN clearly articulates a health policy focus in its\nvision, mission, and mandate. Policy products available for\ndownload include fact sheets, briefing notes, and consulta-\ntion documents. Example topics include health workforce\nissues, the future of nursing, and welfare reform. In addition\nto policy products, mechanisms for nurses to be more\ninvolved in health policy include applying to be a representa-\ntive of the organization on committees, invitations to join\ncommittees or task group, or be elected to council. The RCN\nalso encourages its members to provide consultations on cur-\nrent issues and provides its members with current news,\nevents, and campaigns.\nDiscussion\nThis website review of international- and national-level pro-\nfessional nursing organizations provides a first examination\nof organizational practices and activities undertaken to politi-\ncally engage RNs in nursing and health policy issues. Six\norganizations were identified to meet all of our criteria,\nincluding establishing clear policy goals and mandates, offer-\ning policy-related products on nursing and health-related\nissues, and implementing activities to engage nurses in pol-\nicy-related activities. Typically, professional nursing organi-\nzations provided a description of their organization's vision,\nmission, organizational mandate and goals on their website.\nProfessional nursing organization websites varied regarding\nhow well they described specific policy goals and objectives\nas part of their organizational mandate. While some organiza-\ntions provided publically available documents detailing their\norganization's activities, such as annual reports and strategic\nplans, no organization explicitly discussed how they priori-\ntized nursing or health policy decisions within their organiza-\ntion. This includes the processes undertaken by organizations\nand the decisions made for which issues would be the primary\nfocus for the organization as a representative of RNs nation-\nally and internationally. Priority setting is an important pro-\ncess for nursing professional organizations to consider as it\ninvolves activities that identify which health service issues\nshould receive priority, which nursing issues require urgent\nattention, and who as patients need immediate attention over\nothers. Our finding is consistent with other authors who iden-\ntified that there is limited research evidence on the priority\nsetting activities identified by professional nursing associa-\ntions and the factors that influence these decisions which\ncould affect how well nursing associations implement their\norganizational mandates and goals (MacDonald et al., 2012;\nMitton, Patton, Waldner, & Donaldson, 2003; Peacock,\nMitton, Bate, McCoy, & Donaldson, 2009). Likely, many\nprofessional nursing organizations undertake one or more\nprocesses to support priority setting but do not describe these\non their organization's website. An area for future research\nwould be to examine what these priority setting practices are,\nhow they affect the work of the organization and how well the\ndetermined policy priority areas reflect the organization's\nvision, mission, and mandates.\nDespite organization websites offering a limited descrip-\ntion of their priority setting activities, the six organizations\nthat met our criteria provided a number of policy products\nthat discussed their position on various nursing and policy\nissues and methods for nurses to engage in these policy\nissues. Common policy products were position statements,\nbriefing notes, fact sheets, media releases, and research evi-\ndence summaries. A common way to engage nurses was to\nprovide \"tips\" to writing letters to government representa-\ntives, lobby government on nursing issues, policy and legis-\nlation, and how to meet with government representatives.\nSome organizations presented information about confer-\nences and events for nurses to attend but these were not\nalways focused on the policy activities of the organization.\nOne organization, the ANA, provided a \"policy advocacy\"\ntool kit but this was housed on a website separate from the\norganization. Few websites provided a means for nurses to\ncollaborate on nursing and health policy issues such as\nthrough networks, coalitions, and partnerships. Our findings\nare consistent with other authors who describe similar\nattempts to advocate for nursing and health policy issues\nlimitation arising from our review is that organizations'web-\nsites may not accurately portray the intensity with which\norganizations may engage on certain nursing or health-pol-\nicy-related issues. This includes a need to understand the fac-\ntors that influence which policy products nursing\norganizations select to use and the decisions made about the\npackaging and sharing of policy products. According to\nVandenhouten et al. (2011), nursing participation in health\npolicy was influenced by psychological engagement, includ-\ning nurses who were interested in health policy issues and\nconfident that their actions might make a difference. This\ncould be an important factor for professional nursing asso-\nciations to consider when attempting to engage nurses. From\nour website review, while organizations describe their activi-\nties to advance policy issues and present the importance of\nnurses to take action, no included organization explicitly\ndescribed the specific impact on the advancement of nursing\nand health policy issues that would result from nursing\nengagement in the organization and the policy advocacy\nactivities. Greater efforts to support nursing psychological\nengagement might encourage more nursing participation in\npolicy advocacy activities. Our results also revealed that few\nnursing professional organizations evaluate how well their\npolicy advocacy activities are effective in stimulating greater\nnursing political activity. Future research to evaluate the\nimpact of the policy products and mechanisms to engage\nnurses offered by international- and national-level nursing\norganizations is needed.\n8 SAGE Open\nOur study presented a first look at international- and\nnational-level nursing professional organizational websites\nfor their policy priority setting activities, specific policy\nobjectives, products, and mechanisms for engaging nurses in\npolicy issues. However, a limitation of our study is our\nemphasis on organizations with an English-language web-\nsite. There were a number of websites from Europe which we\nhad to exclude from our review because there were not\nenough webpages in English to determine inclusion. Future\nresearch might include attempts to have individuals fluent in\nthese languages interpret the websites for inclusion and be\ninvolved in data extraction when applicable. Our study was\nalso limited by the amount of information that organizations\nchose to place on their websites. Many times organizations\ncarry out a number of activities behind the scenes that are not\ndeclared or presented on their websites.

Nurses often cite a lack of political aware-\nness, including the internal workings of the government\nand how policy decisions are made (Abood, 2007; Cramer,\n2002). Nurse leaders who work with nursing professional\norganizations and nurse educators need to cultivate greater\npolitical interest and engagement beginning with under-\ngraduate-level nursing students and continuing with prac-\nticing nurses (Deschaine & Schaffer, 2003; Duncan,\nThorne, Van Neste-Kenny, & Tate, 2012; Vandenhouten\net al., 2011). Introduction of a health policy course within\nthe nursing curriculum at the undergraduate and graduate\nlevels can help facilitate political engagement through\nbroadening student awareness of current health policy\nissues and the policy processes used to address these prob-\nlems. Professional nursing organizations can play a role in\nproviding ongoing continuing education for nurses in prac-\ntice to address knowledge gaps (Vandenhouten et al., 2011).\nEducational strategies can focus nursing awareness on the\ntypical pressures faced in a policy environment such as\nfast-paced setting, multiple competing demands, limited\ntime to make influential decisions, and a need for timely\nevidence for decision-making (Catallo & Sidani, 2014).\nWith a better understanding of the policy process and the\npolicy arena, including the pressures surrounding decision-\nmaking and multiple competing drivers, nurses can identify\nand develop a role that facilitates ongoing political engage-\nment. Some examples of areas that nurses could improve\ntheir skills include activities that support the articulation of\na current health problem using a nursing and policy lens,\nidentifying options that policymakers would deem relevant\nwithin the broader health system to address the nursing and/\nor policy problem, and describing local implementation\nconsiderations in a succinct manner, should an option be\nselected. These areas of focus are consistent with interna-\ntional initiatives such as the SUPPORT Tools for evidence-\ninformed health Policymaking (STP) series by the\nSUPportingPOlicyrelevantReviewsandTrials(SUPPORT)\nproject, an international collaboration funded by the\nEuropean Commission's sixth Framework (http://www.\nsupport-collaboration.org; Lavis, Oxman, Lewin, &\narticles describing the types of information that health poli-\ncymakers need to know, what evidence is required for\nhealth policy decision-making, and specific interventions\nsuch as development of policy briefs and policy dialogues\nwhich facilitate health-policy decision-making. The\nSUPPORT Tools material could be helpful to include as\npart of nursing education and skill development to better\nequip student and practicing nurses to articulate and\nrespond to nursing and policy-related issues. The SUPPORT\nTools can be found in the Health Research Policy and\nSystems Journal Volume 7 Supplement 1: http://www.\nhealth-policy-systems.com/supplements/7/s1\nConclusion\nThis study offers a first review of international- and national-\nlevel professional nursing organizations and how they\nengage nurses in health and nursing policy through their\npolicy priority setting strategies, policy goals and objectives,\npolicy products, and mechanisms for engaging nurses in pol-\nicy issues. This study offers promising results, in that many\nnursing organizations are actively working to address nurs-\ning and health-policy-related issues. Continued work is\nneeded to promote nursing engagement and to evaluate the\neffectiveness of the strategies used by professional nursing\norganizations to support political activity.\nAuthors' Note\nC.C. conceived of the study and obtained funding.
