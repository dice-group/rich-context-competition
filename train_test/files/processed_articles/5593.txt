    "abstract": "Abstract\nPeople's reactions to offenders and victims of crime follow different rationales. Whereas the\npunishment of the offender is primarily determined by the severity of the crime (which includes\nits foreseeable harmful consequences), the actual harm that is experienced by the victim drives\nthe need for his or her support and assistance. With the introduction of the Victim Impact\nStatement (VIS), in which victims are allowed to express the (harmful) consequences of the\ncrime on their lives, the question is raised whether allowing such victim input during criminal\nproceedings would influence the offender's sentence. The main goal of the current research is to\ndisentangle how a crime's wrongfulness and harmfulness influence people's reactions to offenders\nand victims. We show that, whereas people's perceptions of the offender (and the outcome of\nthe trial) are influenced by the severity of the crime, people's judgements related to the victim\nare more likely to be influenced by an interaction between the severity of the crime and the\nexperienced harm of the crime. That is, in this study no support was found for the argument that\nthe delivery of a VIS would lead to a violation of the proportionality principle.\n",

Proponents\nargue that any weight given to the experience of the victim in terms of `harm'would lead\nto disproportionate sentences and thus to a violation of the proportionality principle. In\nthis study, we examine this issue by disentangling which factors determine people's reac-\ntions to offenders and victims of crime. We predict that, whereas judgements relating to\nthe offender (and his or her punishment) co-vary with the severity of the crime, people's\njudgements related to the victim co-vary with both the severity of the crime and the\nexperienced harm.\nPunishment of offenders: Empirical desert and the severity\nof crime\nTheories concerning the punishment of perpetrators of crime have been widely debated\nfor centuries. Although they come in many shapes and sizes (for an overview: Tonry,\n2011), the key distinction is between the family of deontological theories, most often\nassociated with Immanuel Kant and G.F. Hegel and the utilitarian theories, the heritage\nof which can be traced to Jeremy Bentham. Whereas utilitarian theories consider the\nconsequences of punishment to be its key motivation, deontological theories view pun-\nishment as a necessity, an imperative in the light of the wrongdoing that preceded it. The\nutilitarian wonders whether punishment will deter the offender from committing crime\nin the future, or whether the existence of punishment prevents others from doing the\nsame. For the deontologist, these consequences are irrelevant, and in particular in the\nlatter case immoral, because they entail using the offender as a means to the end of crime\nprevention. What matters is the wrongfulness of the deed (that is, the actus reus) and the\nmotive and mind-state of the wrongdoer (that is, the mens rea). These different rationales\nalso translate into different dimensions upon which the question of the magnitude of\npunishment is to be decided. For utilitarians, this is proportional to the punishment's\nforward-looking, deterrent and preventative effects. For deontologists, it is proportional\nto the wrongfulness of the crime.\nFor a long time the debate has been the sole province of ethics and moral philoso-\nphy. More recently, investigators have become interested in providing empirical input:\nhow do people actually make decisions about punishment? In particular, the work of\nRobinson and Darley, and their colleagues, has sought to provide answers to this ques-\ntion. An increasing body of evidence suggests that, even though respondents might\nexplicitly allude to utilitarian theories (Carlsmith et al., 2002), their actual decisions\nand theories in use are guided by deontological notions of desert (Darley, 2009;\nRobinson and Darley, 1997, 2007). Importantly, this `empirical desert' (Robinson and\nDarley, 1997) has been shown to be based upon the severity of the crime in question\n\u00ad its wrongfulness \u00ad rather than the extent of the harm the behaviour causes (Alter\net al., 2007). Sorting out the wrongfulness and harmfulness of crime can be a tricky\nmatter, given that much of the reason crime is wrong (`mala in se') lies in the fact that\nit is harmful \u00ad either in a manifest manner (the damage to property or personal harm)\nand/or in the symbolic threat it poses to core values of our society (Duff, 2001). The\ncrime of rape is wrong to a large degree because of (the presumption of) the harm it\ncauses, and the extent to which a given crime is more severe (that is, has a higher\ndegree of wrongfulness) is correlated with the harm it is thought to cause. Nevertheless,\nwrongfulness and harmfulness can be disentangled. An illustration is the intuition that\na higher level of punishment is warranted for attempted murder (high level of wrong-\nfulness, lower level of harmfulness) than for negligent homicide (lower level of wrong-\nfulness, higher level of harmfulness), which is indeed also the rule in criminal codes in\nmost, if not all, jurisdictions (for example, Alter et al., 2007).\nThe importance of experienced harm to victims of crime\nWhereas people's reactions to offenders follow the logic of empirical desert and are\nguided by the severity of the crime committed, assistance and support to help victims\nrecover from the crime's impact are guided by the harm that actually emerges. Pemberton\n(2014) concludes that whereas the offender's actions and the proportionate reaction to\nthese actions should be measured along the dimension of wrongfulness (`the yardstick of\nwrong'), the reaction to the victim's predicament should take the experienced harmful-\nness as the point of departure (`the yardstick of harm').\nCrime's wrongfulness is in part determined by the harmfulness it usually and/or fore-\nseeably causes, but research in victimology reveals that the experienced consequences of\nsimilarly severe crimes display large variation from one case to the next (for example,\nWinkel, 2007).Although there is a clear correlation between the harm victims experience\nand the severity of the offence, pre-existing, co-occurring and aftermath factors all influ-\nence the experience of victims of crime (Ozer et al., 2003). These idiosyncratic experi-\nences of victims of crime should, as a matter of course, be mirrored in the way they are\ntreated, with emerging consequences determining the necessity of psychological and/or\nmedical treatment (NICE, 2005). A key task of psychological professionals in the after-\nmath of mass victimization events is to match support and treatment to the extent of harm\nexperienced by the victim.\nThis is not to say that third-party support and assistance will necessarily track victims'\nexperience of harm. The research surrounding the justice motive (Hafer and B\u00e8gue,\n2005; Lerner, 1980) has repeatedly demonstrated that victims' suffering can give rise to\nnegative derogating and blaming reactions, where paradoxically the extent of enduring\nsuffering can lead to a lack of support and an increase in negative reactions (Aguiar et al.,\n2008; Correia and Vala, 2003). In addition, recent research has revealed the importance\nof people's pre-existing expectations of victims' reactions: A `mismatch' between the\nobservers' expectations of the victim's suffering and a victim's emotional demeanour\nnegatively influences the observers' attitude towards the victim (Lens et al., 2014).\nWhere as a rule the (non-verbal) expression of emotions has positive effects on people's\nperceptions of the victim's credibility (also called the `Emotional Victim Effect'; Ask\nand Landstr\u00f6m, 2010; Winkel and Koppelaar, 1991), this is constrained by the extent to\nwhich the emotional reaction is viewed as a proportional response to the severity of the\nexperienced crime. Lens et al. (2014) showed that, in comparison with victims of severe\ncrimes, victims of less severe crimes who deliver a highly emotional VIS run the risk of\nbeing derogated and of being treated with less sympathy.\nMixing rationales? Victim Impact Statements\nThe reactions to offenders and victims in the aftermath of crime follow different ration-\nales. Whereas the severity of the crime (which includes its foreseeable harmful conse-\nquences) determines the punishment of the offender, the actual harm that results drives\nthe need for support and assistance of the victim. The latter is correlated to, but not\ndetermined by, the severity of the crime. In addition, people's reactions are contingent on\ntheir expectations of a reasonable response to a crime of a given severity.\nWhere the responses to offenders and victims are delivered separately, by different\nagencies and procedures, this difference in rationales can hardly be viewed as problem-\natic. However, this changes when the actual experience of harm (that is, victim-oriented\nrationale) is used to determine the sentence of the offender, beyond what the conse-\nquences the offender should have foreseen.\nThis issue has become more acute following the introduction of the so-called Victim\nImpact Statement (VIS) in various jurisdictions. Although the precise form of a VIS can\nvary from a written statement, which primarily serves a function in awarding compensa-\ntion, to an oral statement, which may influence the sentence given to the offender (also\nreferred to as a Victim Statement of Opinion), all have in common that they allow vic-\ntims the right to express the harm they have experienced as a part of the court proceed-\nuse of the VIS has proliferated across all common law jurisdictions, as well as in some\ncivil law countries such as The Netherlands (for example, Roberts, 2008).\nAs a general rule, the academic community is highly sceptical, if not outright opposed,\nto the influence of a VIS on the offender's sentence (Ashworth, 1993; Bandes, 1996;\nRoberts, 2009; Sarat, 1997). The main argument against this practice is that it is seen as\nan attempt to introduce an irrelevant issue into the sentencing of offenders. Beyond the\nharm offenders could have foreseen through their actions, it is unclear what bearing the\nidiosyncratic experience of victims of crime and their opinion on offender's wrongdoing\nshould have on the sentence (Pemberton, 2014). Any weight given to these matters in the\ndetermination of punishment would then lead to disproportionate sentences, co-varying\nwith factors irrelevant to the wrongfulness of the offender's actions.\n(Academic) proponents of the VIS (for example, Roberts and Erez, 2004; Pemberton\nand Reynaers, 2011) do not dispute this. Instead they argue, first, that there is as yet no\nevidence that a VIS leads to disproportionate and/or more severe sentences (Erez and\nRogers, 1999; Roberts, 2009); and, second, that the benefits for victims lie elsewhere.\nimprovements in their experienced treatment, perception of voice and/or control are key\nThe present research\nWhereas those opposed to the VIS argue that its use will lead to the application of the\nvictim's idiosyncratic experience of harm to a subject to which this is, or should be, irrel-\nevant (the sentence of the offender), proponents suggest that a VIS will guide the treat-\nment and experience of the victim but not have an impact on the offender's sentence.\nThe current research intends to shed light upon this matter.1 The main hypothesis driv-\ning the research is that judgements relating to the offender (and his or her punishment)\nco-vary with the severity of the crime (operationalized here as the type of crime: rape\nversus threat), whereas people's judgements related to the victim co-vary with the expe-\nrienced harm (operationalized here as the victim's emotional response in his or her VIS),\neven when they are tasked to make these judgements at the same time, as part of one\nprocedure. One rule for the goose, and one for the gander? Given that the reactions to\nvictims are also influenced by expectations based upon the severity of the crime, we\nfurthermore expect an interaction effect of the severity of the crime and the experienced\nharm on respondents' reactions to victims of crime. The following two hypotheses are\ntested in this research:\nH1: The reaction to the offender co-varies with the severity of the crime, but not with the\nvictim's experienced harm (Hypothesis 1).\nH2: The reaction to the victim co-varies with the interaction between the severity of crime and\nthe victim's experienced harm (Hypothesis 2).\nMethod\nParticipants and design\nwere randomly assigned to one of four conditions defined by a 2 (crime severity: high vs.\nlow) \u00d7 2 (experienced harm: high vs. low) factorial design.\nMaterials and procedure\nThe participants were seated at separate tables in a lecture hall. They were told to work\non the experimental task quietly and individually. The participants were given written\ninstructions informing them that they were about to read a scenario and that they subse-\nquently had to answer a number of questions. They were assured that there were no\n`right' or `wrong' answers and that the results of the experiment would be treated confi-\ndentially. A brief background section stated that a crime had taken place, that a suspect\nhad been arrested, that the criminal trial would take that place, and that the victim would\nhave the opportunity to make a VIS on the consequences of the crime. The first para-\ngraph of the VIS was the same in all scenarios: the victim stated that she had been\ncycling home after a night out with friends when she saw someone (the suspect) standing\nat the side of the road. She stated that she had recognized this person from the club she\nand her friends had been to, and, thinking that he was having trouble with his bicycle, she\nhad stopped to help him.\nCrime severit.In the high crime severity condition (that is, rape), the victim continued her\nstatement by declaring that the suspect had immediately started to touch her inappropriately.\nAfter making it clear to him that she did not want this, the suspect became violent and\neventually raped her. In the low crime severity condition (that is, threat), the victim continued\nher statement by declaring that the suspect had immediately started to swear at her and had\nthreatened to hurt her. In this scenario, the participants were told that no physical violence had\nbeen inflicted. To reduce possible confounds, in neither of the two scenarios was any addi-\ntional information about the victim, the suspect or the trial given to the participants.\nExperienced harm. Experienced harm was manipulated by assigning participants to a sce-\nnario in which the victim experienced either serious consequences or no consequences of\nthe crime, as expressed in the VIS. The content of the VIS was based on a previous study\nof victims' emotional reactions to violent crimes (Lens et al., 2010, 2013). In the high\nexperienced harm condition, participants read the following:\n`This crime has turned my whole life upside down. I can't sleep any more, I barely eat and I\nconstantly feel anxious. Anxious that this will happen to me again or that I will meet the\noffender again. I am afraid to be out on the street on my own. I constantly feel tense, restless\nand sad. I am not who I once was, I am no longer the enjoyable friend or the fun, spontaneous\ndaughter.... Why did this have to happen to me? What did I do to deserve this? I am disgusted\nby the offender! What possessed him? I did not even know him. I am so mad. Very often at the\nwrong people. Then I have to take it out on the person standing closest to me. It is just so unfair,\nI have become a completely different person.'\nIn the low experienced harm condition, participants read the same text, yet with the\nvictim stating that she had not experienced any consequences at all (beginning the VIS\nwith `This crime didn't change my life at all'). Having read the scenario, the participants\nwere asked to digest the scenario for a while and subsequently turn the page to answer a\nnumber of questions.\nDependent measures\nPerceptions and judgements of the victim\nExpectancy violation. In line with previous work (Ask and Landstr\u00f6m, 2010; Lens et al.,\n2014), the participants were asked to assess to what extent the consequences matched the\nconsequences they would expect from a rape/threat victim (1 = did not match at all, 7 =\nmatched completely).\nVeracity judgements.In line with previous work (Ask and Landstr\u00f6m, 2010; Lens\net al., 2014), the participants were asked to make a dichotomous veracity judgement,\nindicating whether or not they believed that the victim had suffered the consequences as\nindicated in the VIS, and to assign a confidence rating to the certainty of the expressed\nconsequences (1 = absolutely unsure, 7 = absolutely sure).\nAttitude towards the victim.Two items regarding the observers' attitude towards the\nvictim were adapted from a study by Aguiar and colleagues (2008). As a measure of\nvictim derogation, the participants were asked to indicate their general impression of the\nvictim on a seven-point scale, ranging from 1 (extremely negative) to 7 (extremely posi-\ntive) (with the lower range of scores indicating victim derogation). Furthermore, they\nwere asked to indicate their feelings of sympathy for the victim on a seven-point scale,\nranging from 1 (no sympathy at all) to 7 (very strong sympathy).\nBlameworthiness of the victim. As a measure of victim blaming, the participants were\nasked to rate the extent to which they found the victim was to blame (1 = no blame at\nall, 7 = full blame). Furthermore, participants had to indicate the extent to which they\nthought that the victim could have prevented the crime from occurring (1 = absolutely\nnot, 9 = absolutely).\nVictim Impact Statement.Participants were asked to make two dichotomous judge-\nments, indicating (1) whether or not they thought that the described consequences of\nthe crime (that is, experienced harm) should be taken into account when determining\nthe punishment of the offender (yes or no), and (2) whether or not they thought that the\ndescribed consequences, as stated by the victim in the VIS (that is, experienced harm),\nshould have an influence in the criminal justice proceedings (yes or no). For both judge-\nments, participants were also asked to give ratings on 9-point scales, ranging from 1\n(absolutely not) to 9 (absolutely). Finally, participants were asked to rate the extent to\nwhich they thought the VIS is a good instrument to `measure' the consequences of the\ncrime for the victim (1 = absolutely not, 9 = absolutely).\nPerceptions and judgements of the offender\nBlameworthiness of the offender. Participants were asked to rate the extent to which\nthey found the offender was to blame on a seven-point scale (1 = no blame at all, 7 =\nfull blame).\nPunishment of the offender. Participants were asked to rate the extent to which they\nthought the punishment of the offender should be severe (1 = not severe at all, 7 =\nextremely severe).\nResults\nManipulation checks2\nAs a check of the effectiveness of the `experienced harm' manipulation, participants\nwere asked to rate the extent to which the victim indicated in her VIS that the conse-\nquences of the crime were either negative or positive, ranging from 1 (completely nega-\ntive) to 7 (completely positive). An independent-samples t-test showed strong significant\nthe high experienced harm condition indicated that the consequences of the crime for the\nvictim were (completely) negative (M = 1.46, SD = 1.04), whereas participants in the low\nexperienced harm condition scored exactly in the centre of the scale (M = 4.09, SD =\n0.70), indicating that the victim suffered no consequences at all. Hence, the `experienced\nharm' manipulation was successful.\nAs a check of the effectiveness of the `crime severity'manipulation, participants were\nasked to rate the extent to which they found that the specific type of crime (that is, rape/\nTable 1.

The mean\nscores in both low crime severity conditions were more subtle, indicating that partici-\npants in these conditions have less strong expectations about a victim's reaction after\nexperiencing threat.\nVeracity judgements. A Pearson Chi-square test showed significant differences in veracity\njudgements of the suffered consequences, as indicated in the VIS, 2 (3, N = 197) =\n72.15, p < .001. Participants in the high crime severity \u00ad high experienced harm condi-\ntion scored highest on this measure (96 percent), followed by the low crime severity \u00ad\nhigh experienced harm condition (64 percent), the low crime severity \u00ad low experienced\nharm condition (24 percent), and the high crime severity \u00ad low experienced harm condi-\ntion (22 percent). Furthermore, results from an ANOVA on confidence ratings revealed\nsimilar effects, as the Crime Severity \u00d7 Experienced Harm interaction, F(1, 209) = 9.71,\np\n2 = .19, were significant, but the main effect of Crime Severity was non-significant,\nan important determinant in participants' veracity judgements.\nAttitude towards the victim.

An ANOVA on victim blaming revealed a Crime Severity\n2 = .02. There was a significant difference in victim blaming only\nbetween the high crime severity \u00ad high experienced harm condition (M = 1.50, SD =\n0.90) and the high crime severity \u00ad low experienced harm condition (M = 2.27, SD =\n1.64, all p's > .103. These low ratings indicate that victim blaming was quite unlikely for\nall groups of participants. Furthermore, an ANOVA on victim prevention revealed no\nthe victim could have prevented the occurrence of the crime.\nVictim Impact Statement. Participants in the high crime severity \u00ad low experienced harm\ncondition (48 percent), the high crime severity \u00ad high experienced harm condition (56\npercent), the low crime severity \u00ad low experienced harm condition (59 percent), and the\nlow crime severity \u00ad high experienced harm condition (60 percent) were equally hesitant\nin indicating that the VIS should have an influence on the criminal justice proceedings,\nure of this item revealed similar effects, as the Crime Severity \u00d7 Experienced Harm\nall non-significant.\nA Pearson Chi-square test showed significant differences in whether participants\nthought that the VIS should be taken into account when determining the punishment of\nhigh experienced harm condition (82 percent) scored highest on this measure, followed\nby the high crime severity \u00ad high experienced harm condition (75 percent), the low crime\nseverity \u00ad low experienced harm condition (64 percent), and the high crime severity \u00ad\nlow experienced harm condition (42 percent).

Participants in both the high\ncrime severity \u00ad low experienced harm and the high crime severity \u00ad high experienced\nharm conditions found that the punishment of the offender should be more severe than\nthe participants in both the low crime severity \u00ad low experienced harm and the low crime\nseverity \u00ad high experienced harm conditions, all t's > 8.68, all p's < .001.\nDiscussion\nOverall, we found support for the first hypothesis (H1) that people's perceptions regard-\ning the offender (and the outcome of the trial) are more likely to be influenced by the\nseverity of the crime than by the experienced harm of the crime. Only the severity of the\ncrime had an influence on the punishment of the offender: participants who read about a\nhighly severe crime think that the offender should be punished more severely than par-\nticipants who read about a crime that is less severe. However, the blameworthiness of the\noffender was influenced by both the severity of the crime and the experienced harm of\nthe crime: people who read about a victim experiencing no consequences from a highly\nsevere crime scored highest on blaming the offender, whereas participants who read\nabout a victim experiencing serious consequences from a less severe crime were least\nlikely to blame the offender. We examined the correlations between blameworthiness\nand punishment of the offender per condition and found that there was a significantly\npositive correlation in all conditions, with the exception of the high crime severity \u00ad low\nTable 2.

We do not have a clear expla-\nnation for this finding. It might be the case that people judge a victim who does not dis-\nplay (emotional) consequences from a severe crime to be in need of suppressing the\nconsequences of the crime in order to cope with the situation and therefore may even be\nharmed more than victims who do express the consequences. More research is needed to\nexamine what people take into account when making judgements about the blameworthi-\nness and punishment of the offender.\nFinally, we found support for the second hypothesis (H2) that people's judgements\nrelated to the victim are likely to be influenced by both the severity of the crime and the\nexperienced harm. First, people who read about a victim experiencing serious conse-\nquences from a severe crime were least likely to experience expectancy violation,\nwhereas participants who read about a victim experiencing no consequences from a\nsevere crime were most likely to experience expectancy violation. Thus, participants\nwho read about a severe crime had stronger expectations about the emotionality of the\nvictim than participants who read about a mildly severe crime. In addition, people tended\nto have more sympathy for victims in the high crime severity conditions than for victims\nin the low crime severity conditions, and most sympathy was felt for victims experienc-\ning serious consequences from a severe crime. This same pattern was found for the par-\nticipants' confidence in the suffering of the victim. Finally, and in line with previous\nresearch (for example, Lens et al., 2014), participants were quite unlikely to blame the\nvictim for the crime or to think that the victim could have prevented the crime.\nThe items concerning the VIS revealed that participants who read about a victim\nexperiencing serious consequences were more likely to think that the VIS should be\ntaken into account when determining the punishment of the offender than participants\nwho read about a victim not experiencing serious consequences. However, although it\nseems that `experienced harm' is an important determinant in participants' judgements\nabout whether the VIS should be taken into account in the punishment of the offender,\nwe found no differences on the more general question of whether people think that the\nVIS should have an influence on the criminal justice proceedings as such. Furthermore,\npeople who read about a victim experiencing serious consequences from a severe crime\nscored highest on judging the VIS to be a good instrument to `measure' the victim's\nactual experience, whereas participants who read about a victim experiencing no conse-\nquences from a severe crime were least likely to consider the VIS a good instrument.\nScientific and practical implications\nThe current study extends previous research in an important regard. Previous studies that\nexamined people's judgements of a criminal case mainly focused either on the effects of\ncrime severity on people's perceptions of the offender and the decisions on punishment\n(for example, Carlsmith et al., 2002; Darley et al., 2000) or on the effects of a victim's\n(non-verbal) emotional expression on people's credibility judgements and perceptions of\nthe victim (for example, Ask and Landstr\u00f6m, 2010; Bollingmo et al., 2009; Hackett\nined possible interaction effects of crime severity and the experienced harm of the crime\non people's perceptions of different participants in the criminal trial included a question\nonly about the appropriate punishment of the offender and not about blameworthiness\n(Rose et al., 2006). The results suggest that these two constructs are not judged in the\nsame manner. Furthermore, this study did not include questions about people's percep-\ntions regarding the VIS. This is especially important because of the ongoing debate\naround the acceptance \u00ad and desirability \u00ad of victim input during the trial. The desirabil-\nity of enabling victims to deliver a VIS is highly debated on conceptual as well as practi-\n2004; Roberts and Erez, 2004). Whereas proponents argue that the delivery of a VIS may\npromote accurate or effective sentencing outcomes by enabling victims to speak about\nthe experienced consequences of the crime for their lives (for example, Erez and Rogers,\n1999; Roberts and Erez, 2004), opponents argue that its delivery may lead to a violation\nof the proportionality principle, because differences in post-crime reactions by the victim\nmay lead to differences in the outcome of the trial (for example, Buruma, 2004; Luginbuhl\nand Burkhead, 1995; Myers and Arbuthnot, 1999). This study showed that the punish-\nment of the offender is influenced by the severity of the crime and not by the expression\nby the victim of the consequences (that is, experienced harm). In other words, this study\nfound no support for the argument that enabling a VIS during a trial might lead to a viola-\ntion of the proportionality principle.\nFinally, the present research highlights that people (at least partially) rely on the emo-\ntions they experience as a consequence of being confronted with the emotions of a victim\nin decision-making. Hence, the idea that people exclusively behave `logically', as often\nstated in economic and criminological studies, does not find support in the current study.\nLimitations\nSome limitations of this study should be noted. First, the sample of participants (that is,\nuniversity students) lacked personal experience of criminal cases, which may limit gen-\neralization of the present findings. It could be that professionals involved in the criminal\njustice procedure (for example, prosecutors, judges) develop more fine-grained schemas\nfor evaluating the severity and the experienced harm of the crime and thus rely less on\nstereotypical expectancies (see also Ask and Landstr\u00f6m, 2010; Lens et al., 2014). For\nexample, Wessel et al. (2006) showed that credibility ratings of court judges, unlike those\nof lay people, were not influenced by the emotions displayed by the witness. However,\nother studies demonstrated that even experienced professionals are susceptible to a vic-\ntim's post-crime reaction. Frohmann (1991), for example, suggested that a rape victim's\ndemeanour had a substantial influence on the victim's perceived credibility in the eyes of\nprosecutors. Because it remains an empirical question as to whether a more `representa-\ntive' sample would yield similar findings, we suggest that future research should focus\non other groups of participants (for example, judges, prosecutors). Second, only a written\ndepiction of the experienced harm was provided, which allowed us to exclude possible\neffects from a victim's non-verbal emotional expression. However, given that previous\nresearch has repeatedly shown effects from a victim's non-verbal emotional expression\non people's judgements of the victim (for example, Ask and Landstr\u00f6m, 2010; Nadler\n1991), it is likely that similar, if not stronger, effects would emerge when participants are\npresented with a video presentation by the victim. Finally, the experimental conditions\ncontained two (separate) dimensions of statement credibility \u00ad as operationalized by the\n19 Criteria Based Contents Analysis approach: criteria 12 (that is, description of subjec-\ntive mental states) and criteria 17 (that is, self-depreciation). These two dimensions\nmight each have different and uncontrolled influences on people's perceptions of the\ncredibility of the VIS. Future studies should contain only one of these dimensions to\ndisentangle these effects.\nConclusion\nThis article substantiates the finding that people's reactions to offenders and victims of\ncrime follow different rationales. Whereas the punishment of the offender is primarily\ndetermined by the severity of the crime (which includes its foreseeable harmful conse-\nquences), the actual harm that is experienced by the victim drives the need for his or her\nsupport and assistance. With the introduction of the Victim Impact Statement, the ques-\ntion was raised of whether allowing such victim input during the criminal proceedings\nwould influence the offender's sentence. The main goal of the current research was to\ndisentangle how a crime's wrongfulness and harmfulness influence people's reactions to\noffenders and victims.\nIn conclusion, the present research has shown that, whereas perceptions regarding the\noffender (and the outcome of the trial) are more likely to be influenced by the severity of\nthe crime (Hypothesis 1), people's judgements related to the victim are more likely to be\ninfluenced by an interaction between the severity of the crime and the experienced harm\nof the crime (Hypothesis 2). Hence, we conclude that no support was found for the argu-\nment that enabling a VIS during a trial might lead to a violation of the proportionality\nprinciple and that the debate about whether or not to allow victims to deliver a VIS dur-\ning the criminal proceedings is not as black and white as previously argued. The results\nof this study give a more nuanced view of which factors are more or less likely to be\ninfluenced by the delivery of a VIS.\nFunding\nOur research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or\nnot-for-profit sectors.\nNotes\n1. This study is based on a previous study by Lens and colleagues (2014). In a second part of\nthis study, we also measured people's ability to remember the experienced consequences as\nexpressed in the VIS. Data available upon request.\n2. When there was an inequality of variances, corrected degrees of freedom are reported for\nt-tests throughout the article.\n3. A MANOVA on the different victim items was performed, which reached the same results\nas separate ANOVAs. However, because not all items had the necessary correlation to\nperform the MANOVA, and for reasons of clarity, the separate ANOVAs are reported\nhere.\nReferences\nAguiar P, Vala J, Correia I and Pereira C (2008) Justice in our world and in that of others: Belief\nin a just world and reactions to victims.
