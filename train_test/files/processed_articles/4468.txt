The genetic component of hyper-\ntension is strong and multiple genes from diverse molecular\npathways have been linked to BP. Among these pathways,\nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is\nimportant because of its effects on salt and water homeosta-\nsis and autonomic control, as well as vascular structure and\nfunction.\nInhibiting the RAAS has long been known as one of the\nmost successful therapies for the management of hyperten-\nsion. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are\none of the RAAS inhibitors and one of the first-line agents\nfor the treatment of hypertension. However, the BPresponse\nto ACE inhibitors varies markedly among individuals and\namong different ethnic groups.1 Such variations suggest\nthat the genetic constitution of an individual may play an\nA core promoter variant of\nangiotensinogen gene and interindividual\nvariation in response to angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme inhibitors\nHuimin Yu1*, Shuguang Lin1*, Jiuchang Zhong2, Min He3, Lijun Jin1,\nYuqing Zhang4 and Guozhang Liu4\n Keywords\nHypertension, angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, genotype, pharmacogenomics, therapeutics\n1Department of Cardiology, Guangdong General Hospital, China;\nGuangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, China\n2State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital affiliated\nto Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China; Shanghai\nInstitute of Hypertension, China\n3Department of Clinical Laboratory, Guangdong Provincial Hospital of\nChinese Medicine, China\n4Division of Hypertension, Cardiovascular Institute and Fu Wai Hospital,\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences, China; Peking Union Medical\nCollege, China\n*Huimin Yu and Shuguang Lin contributed equally to this work.\nCorresponding author:\nHuimin Yu, Department of Cardiology, Guangdong General Hospital,\nGuangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangdong Cardiovascular\nOriginal Article\nimportant role in variation in the response to ACE inhibitor\ntherapy. Candidate genes for the pharmacogenomics of\nACE inhibitor therapy include genes in the RAAS pathway.\nThe angiotensinogen (AGT) gene, one of the major struc-\ntural genes in this pathway, has been associated with hyper-\npromoter region of the AGT gene, an adenine to guanine\nsubstitution six base pairs (bp) from the site of transcription\ninitiation, has been significantly associated with elevated\nplasma AGT levels, AGT gene transcription and essential\nhypertensive.3,4 Therefore, we hypothesized that this poly-\nmorphism may have the potential to predict the variation in\ntherapeutic response to ACE inhibitors treatment.\nAs we know, besides systolic blood pressure (SBP) and\ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP), BP is also characterized by\nits pulsatile and steady components.5,6 The pulsatile com-\nponent, estimated by pulse pressure (PP), represents BP\nvariation and is affected by left ventricular ejection frac-\ntion, large-artery stiffness, early pulse wave reduction, and\nheart rate.7 The steady component, estimated by mean arte-\nrial pressure (MAP), is a function of left ventricular con-\ntractility, heart rate, and vascular resistance and elasticity\naveraged over time.5,8 In this study, we aimed to investigate\nwhether the A-6G polymorphism of the AGT gene influ-\nences the SBP, DBP, PP, and MAP response to ACE inhibi-\ntors and the distribution of the polymorphism in Chinese\nessential hypertensive patients.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy population\nThe material studied comes from the Comparative Study of\nHypotensive Efficacy and the Cough Occurrence of\nImidapril versus Benazepril,9 which is a multicenter pro-\nspective trial performed in 20 centers in 12 cities in China.\nIn this study both male and female Chinese Han patients\nwho met the following criteria were included: aged 18\u00ad79\nyears; history of essential hypertension; DBP90 mm Hg\ncriteria were isolated systolic hypertension, secondary\nhypertension, or known renal artery stenosis; congestive\nheart failure, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic\nattacks or myocardial infarction within the past year; a doc-\numented history of unstable angina pectoris within the past\nsix months; clinically important cardiac arrhythmia; uncon-\ntrolled diabetes mellitus (fasting plasma glucose>10.0\nmmol/l); any clinically important abnormal laboratory\nfinding, such as glutamic\u00adpyruvic transaminase/creatinine\ntwice the upper limit of normal; a history or suspicion of\nalcohol or drug abuse; pregnant or lactating females; con-\ncomitant use of any agent that may cause an alteration of\nBP; or known hypersensitivity or contraindication to ACE\ninhibitors. The study complies with the Declaration of\nHelsinki. All procedures were reviewed and approved by\nthe institutional review board of each participating institu-\ntion, and written informed consent was obtained from all\nparticipants.\nA total of 640 patients with essential hypertension par-\nticipated in our study. All antihypertensive agents were\nwithdrawn before the start of a two-week single-blind pla-\ncebo run-in period. By use of a double-blind design at the\nend of the placebo period, a total of 570 qualified patients\nwere allocated randomly to groups receiving either 10 mg\nbenazepril or 5 mg imidapril orally once daily for three\nweeks. Thereafter patients whose BP was less than 140/90\nmm Hg continued with the same dose regimen for another\nthree weeks. In patients whose BP was not adequately con-\ntrolled (BP140/90 mm Hg), the dose of either regimen\nwas doubled for the next three weeks. Four patients in the\nbenazepril group withdrew from the study because of a\nsevere cough during the study. Thus 566 patients completed\nthe trial. The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of 509 patients\nwith complete data was successfully extracted for further\nanalysis. BP was measured by trained doctors or nurses\nusing a mercury sphygmomanometer after the patient had\nrested for at least 10 min in a seated position and was deter-\nmined as the mean of three measurements taken 1 min\napart. PP was calculated as the difference between SBP and\nDBP. MAP was calculated as (2DBP + SBP)/3.\nGenotyping\nThe sequence data were obtained from the GenBank data-\nization of the variant is numbered by reference to the\ntranscription-initiation site as defined previously. The AGT\ngene A-6G polymorphism was located at position-6 in the\npromoter region. Genotyping was performed by direct\nsequencing. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were\ndesigned using Primer3 software. The genomic DNAs from\nsubjects were amplified using 5'-AGAGGTTTTTCA\nGTCATCACC GT-3'as the forward primer and 5'-ACGG\nTGATGACTGAAAAACCTCT -3' as the reverse primer.\nPCR amplifications were carried out in a total volume of\n50 \u00b5l with a reaction mixture containing 250 ng genomic\ndeoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) and 2 U Taq\nDNA polymerase. The PCR amplification conditions\nincluded an initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min, fol-\ns, followed by a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 5 min.\nThe amplification product (489 bp) contained nucleotides\nsite mentioned above. The amplified PCR purpose frag-\nment was purified by Wizard PCR Preps DNAPurification\nResin (Promega) and then sequenced using the BIG DYE\ndideoxy-terminator chemistry (Perkin Elmer) on an ABI\n542 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were performed using SPSS statistical soft-\nware (Version 13.0; SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Allele\nfrequencies were calculated from the genotypes of all sub-\njects. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was\nassessed by chi-square analysis. Continuous data are pre-\nsented as mean\u00b1standard deviation (SD). Differences\nbetween groups were tested by chi-square-test for qualita-\ntive parameters and by one-way analysis of variance for\nquantitative parameters. Finally, stepwise multiple linear\nregression analysis was performed to investigate the possi-\nble influence of AGT genotypes on SBP, DBP, PP and MAP\nreductions in the whole study cohort; sex (where 0 indi-\ncates female and 1 indicates male), age, baseline SBP, base-\nline DBP, baseline heart rate, dose (where 0 indicates\nno-dose increase and 1 indicates dose increase), and the\nA-6G genotype (where 0 indicates AA, 1 indicates AG, and\n2 indicates GG) were included as independent variables.\nThe entry and removal criteria used were p values of 0.05\nfor variable entry and p values of 0.10 for variable removal.\nThe associations found in multivariate analyses are reported\nas multiple regression coefficients (b) (\u00b1 SD) and as stand-\nardized regression coefficients (). All tests were two-tailed\nand p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nCharacteristics of the participants\nAGT genotypes were determined for all patients.

There were also no signifi-\ncant differences among the three genotype groups in BP, PP\nor MAP before or after treatment (Table 1). But there was a\nsignificant association of AGTA\u00ad6G with BP, PP and MAP\nreductions in response to ACE inhibitors therapy after six\nweeks treatment (Table 2).

Stepwise multiple linear regression analy-\nsis was also performed to investigate the possible influence\nof the AGT genotypes on the response to therapy with ACE\ninhibitors. The results showed that the A-6G genotype was\na significant predictor of SBP and PP reductions (p=0.040\nand 0.019, respectively) (Table 3), which confirmed the\nassociation between this variant and the response to ACE\ninhibitors.\nDiscussion\nAGT is the first gene product in the RAAS physiological\ncascade. The AGT gene polymorphisms have been associ-\nated with BP-related phenotypes within different ethnic\ngroups and have been tested for their association with\nresponses to many hypertensive therapies, but the results\nhave been inconsistent.10,11 The objective of the present\nstudy was to examine the association between the A-6G\nvariant of the AGT gene and the response to therapy with\nACE inhibitors. To our knowledge, this study appears to be\nthe first prospective study to investigate the association of\nthis polymorphism with PP and MAP response to ACE\ninhibitors treatment.\nThe present study showed a lack of association of the\nA-6G polymorphism with BP in a hypertensive popula-\ntion, because the pretreatment BP was similar in the three\ngenotype groups, which may appear to be consistent with\nthe findings of Marin et al.12 However, opposite results\nwere reported by Filigheddu et al.13 and Brand-Herrmann\net al.14 In this study, the reduction in SBP and DBP after\nsix weeks of ACE inhibitor treatment was significantly\ngreater in patients carrying the GG genotype compared\nwith those carrying the AA or AG genotype. Furthermore,\nin stepwise multiple regression analysis the AGT geno-\ntype was a significant predictor of SBP response to ACE\ninhibitor treatment. The finding in this study appears rea-\nsonable. The acute BP response to ACE inhibitors is\nmainly due to vasodilation induced by reduction of the\nplasma concentration of angiotensin II.15 AGT is the pre-\ncursor of angiotensin II, and the plasma concentration of\nAGT may be reflected in differences in the rate of forma-\ntion of angiotensin II. It can be speculated that the -6G\nallele is positively correlated with the level of plasma\nAGT and the patients carrying the GG genotype have\nincreased levels of AGT which are beneficial to ACE\ninhibitors treatment, because prior studies have found that\nthe -6G allele is associated with increased risk for hyper-\ntension in the Chinese populations4 and the -6G variant\nwas associated with a higher transcriptional activity than\nis -6A variant.16 However, different results were reported\nby Inoue et al.3 and Sarzani et al.17 With regard to previ-\nous pharmacogenetic studies, there are two such studies\nthat have investigated the association of the A-6G poly-\nmorphism and the BP response to monotherapy with ACE\ninhibitors. Filigheddu et al.13 didn't find an association\nbetween the A-6G polymorphism and BP reduction in\nresponse to Fosinopril (ACE inhibitors) after four weeks\nof treatment in 191 white patients with hypertension.\nAnother study, by Marin et al.12 yielded different results.\nIn 57 white patients with hypertension treated with ACE\nTable 2.

Two explanations\nmay account for the discrepancy between the previous\nstudies and our present findings. The most likely explana-\ntion for such differences is genetic heterogeneity between\ndifferent populations. The studies by Marin et al.12 or\nFiligheddu et al.13 were conducted in white hypertensive\npopulations, whereas our study was carried out in a\nChinese hypertensive population. There are large differ-\nences in G allele frequencies between the present cohort\ndifferent allele frequency may have affected the different\nresults between Chinese and whites. This might somewhat\nreflect the racial difference. As mentioned above, another\nreason for inconsistent results among the study by Marin\net al.12 or Filigheddu et al.13 and the present findings could\nbe the differences in population characteristics, selection\ncriteria of the sample, agents used, study protocols, study\ndurations, and outcome measures. These differences are\nlikely to influence their phenotypes and may have a bear-\ning on the study results.\nPP is a predictor of cardiovascular disease, and genes\nlikely influence PP levels.18\u00ad20 Few studies thus far have\nexamined the relationship between AGT genotypes and PP.\nThe study performed by Lynch et al.20 demonstrated that\nwomen with the GG genotype had a lower PP, while men\nwith the GG genotype had a higher PP, compared with those\ncarrying an A allele in a hypertensive cohort. However, in\nthe present study, we found no significant differences in PP\nbetween individuals with different A-6G genotypes in our\nhypertensive patients and there were also no such differ-\nences in PP in the analysis stratified by sex (data not shown).\nAs we know, PP was used as a measurement of arterial stiff-\nness. Increased arterial stiffness is recognized as a risk fac-\ntor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Several\nmethods exist to measure arterial stiffness, of which PP is\nthe simplest. Although PP is not the most sensitive method\nto measure arterial stiffness, it has the advantage over other\nmethods that it has been recognized as a risk factor for car-\ndiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke.21,22 In our study, the\nreduction in PP after six weeks of ACE inhibitor treatment\nwas significantly greater in patients carrying the GG com-\npared with AA or AG genotypes, and the result of the step-\nwise multiple regression analysis also showed that the AGT\ngenotype was a significant predictor of the PP response to\nACE inhibitor treatment. As we know, components of the\nRAAS are expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells. Local\nproduction of AGT occurs in the media in response to arte-\nrial injury,23 and AGT was shown to have direct effects on\nvascular wall remodelling in vivo in a rat model.24 So, our\nresults suggest that genetic variation in AGT promoter area\nmay primarily affect arterial stiffness, and therefore PP\nunder ACE inhibitor therapy.\nMAP, which is highly correlated with either SBP or\nDBP, is the steady flow of blood through the aorta and its\nTable 3.

The present study showed a lack of association\nof the A-6G polymorphism with baseline MAP in a hyper-\ntensive population, which may appear to be consistent with\nthe findings of Bhuiyan et al.26 However, in our study, the\nreduction in MAP after six weeks of ACE inhibitors treat-\nment was significantly greater in patients carrying the GG\ncompared with AA or AG genotypes. To the best of our\nknowledge, this study has, for the first time, found that the\nA-6G polymorphism was related to the PP reduction (men-\ntioned above) and MAP reduction in response to antihyper-\ntensive drugs. We, therefore, speculated that the patients\ncarrying the GG genotype may derive extra benefits with\nthe use of ACE inhibitors.\nA limitation of our study is the relatively short therapeu-\ntic duration. However, with the significant reduction in BP\nafter six-week treatment, we had sufficient statistical power\nto confirm the relationship between A-6G variant of the\nAGT gene and interindividual variation in the response to\nACE inhibitors. Another limitation of our study is that the\npatients were only recruited from the Chinese Han popula-\ntion. Studies in other ethnic populations and in larger\ncohorts may be needed before final conclusions can been\ndrawn.\nIn conclusion, in this prospective study, positive and\ncontinuous associations were observed between the SBP,\nDBP, PP, and MAP response to ACE inhibitors and A-6G\nvariant of the AGT gene in hypertensive subjects. Our\nobservation might support the view that interindividual\nvariation in the efficacy of antihypertensive medications\nmay be influenced by genetic factors. This implies the\nadvantage of genotyping for selecting the optimal antihy-\npertensive treatment for the individual patient.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by National Natural Science\nShanghai Pujiang Talents Program of Shanghai Science\nand the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (grant\nReferences\n1.
