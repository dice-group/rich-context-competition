Sugar-sweetened soda is a primary source of\nfructose. We therefore hypothesized that sugary soda consumption was associated with albuminuria, a sensitive marker for\nkidney disease.\nMethodology/Principal Findings: Design was a cross-sectional analysis. Data were drawn from the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1999\u00ad2004. The setting was a representative United States population sample.\nParticipants included adults 20 years and older with no history of diabetes mellitus (n = 12,601); after exclusions for missing\noutcome and covariate information (n = 3,243), the analysis dataset consisted of 9,358 subjects. Exposure was consumption\nof two or more sugary soft drinks, based on 24-hour dietary recall. The main outcome measure was Albuminuria, defined by\nalbumin to creatinine ratio cutpoints of .17 mg/g (males) and .25 mg/g (females). Logistic regression adjusted for\nconfounders (diet soda, age, race-ethnicity, gender, poverty). Interactions between age, race-ethnicity, gender, and\noverweight-obesity were explored. Further analysis adjusted for potential mediators: energy intake, basal metabolic rate,\nobesity, hypertension, lipids, serum uric acid, smoking, energy expenditure, and glycohemoglobin. Alternative soda intake\ndefinitions and cola consumption were employed.\nResults: Weighted albuminuria prevalence was 11%, and 17% consumed 2+ sugary soft drinks/day. The confounder-\nadjusted odds ratio for sugary soda was 1.40 (95% confidence interval: 1.13, 1.74). Associations were modified by gender\nAdjustment for potential mediators and use of alternative definitions of albuminuria and soda consumption did not\nappreciably change results. Diet sodas were not associated with albuminuria.\nConclusions: Findings suggest that sugary soda consumption may be associated with kidney damage, although moderate\nconsumption of 1 or fewer sodas does not appear to be harmful. Additional studies are needed to assess whether HFCS\nitself, overall excess intake of sugar, or unmeasured lifestyle and confounding factors are responsible.\nCitation: Shoham DA, Durazo-Arvizu R, Kramer H, Luke A, Vupputuri S, et al.

The etiology of diabetes is\nmulti-causal, but increased energy intake and a diet rich in high-\nglycemic-index foods are two likely culprits. Trends in the U.S.\ndiet further contribute to obesity, which has recently emerged as\nan independent risk factor for kidney disease [2,3,4,5]. Trends in\ndiabetes, obesity and kidney disease have all followed the\nintroduction of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) in the American\ndiet [6,7]. In the United States, highly caloric carbonated soft\ndrinks are often sweetened with HFCS [8], which makes soda\ninexpensive to produce. While sugary sodas may be sold cheaply\nas a food item and yield a profit, they provide little satiety [9].\nKidney disease exacts an extensive human and economic price\nthrough both ESRD and greatly elevated cardiovascular disease\nrisk [10,11,12]. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is assessed in a\nnumber of ways. In epidemiologic studies, estimated glomerular\nfiltration rate (GFR) and albuminuria are most commonly used\n[13]. Albuminuria has the advantage of being a sensitive marker\nfor early kidney damage, and is prevalent in over 10% of the U.S.\nadult population [14]. In the general population, albuminuria\npredicts incident kidney failure [15] and cardiovascular disease,\nThree mechanisms may relate soda consumption to albumin-\nuria. First, as noted, the low cost of HFCS makes it profitable for\nmanufacturers and inexpensive for consumers, encouraging\nconsumption of large amounts of soda. Over-consumption of\nsugars in any form may lead to the development of subclinical\ndiabetes, which may eventually manifest as kidney damage years\nbefore clinical diagnosis and the onset of overt diabetes [19].\nObesity, also related to CKD, may be another consequence of\nhigh levels of sugary soda consumption [9]. Second, fructose itself\nmay cause kidney damage, perhaps mediated by uric acid [6].\nThird, other ingredients in soda, such as phosphorus in dark cola,\nmay lead directly to kidney damage [20].\nTherefore, we sought to determine whether sugary soft drink\nconsumption was associated with albuminuria, a sensitive marker\nof early kidney damage, in the general population.\nMethods\nData were drawn from the U.S. population-based National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1999\u00ad\n2004. The NHANES is a complex, nationally representative\nsample of the entire non-institutionalized United States popula-\ntion, now conducted in continuous bi-annual waves by the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention [21]. We included only those\nsubjects 20 years and older without self-reported history of\ndiabetes and not missing diabetes status (n = 12,601). Exclusions\nwere made for those missing albuminuria outcome (n = 1,193),\nmissing dietary recall information (n = 693), and/or missing\nexcluded, yielding an analysis dataset of 9,358 subjects with\ncomplete data (74.3% of the non-diabetic cohort age 20 and\nolder). The current study was approved by the Loyola University\nChicago Stritch School of Medicine Institutional Review Board.\nAlbuminuria, the outcome variable in the primary analyses, was\ndefined by sex-specific albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) cutpoints\nof $17 mg/g in males and $25 mg/g in females; following\nMattix and colleagues, lower sex-specific cutpoints for males were\nchosen based on their higher urinary creatinine concentrations for\nany given level of albumin excretion [22]. GFR was estimated\nusing the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease\n(MDRD) estimating equation [23]. While GFR was compared\nbetween albuminuria cases and non-cases, it was not the focus of\nthis study and was only included in secondary analyses. According\nto available information, missing subjects had +1.20 mg/L higher\nurinary albumin concentration (p,0.001 on the log scale). Missing\nsubjects were on average 1.6 years younger than non-missing\nsubjects (p,0.001) and had a body mass index that was an average\nAll analyses were weighted by mobile examination clinic (MEC)\nweights to account for the complex survey design, and analyzed\nusing STATA version 9.2 svy commands (STATA Corp., College\nStation, TX) according to NHANES analytical guidelines [24].\nSoda consumption was obtained from 24 hour dietary recall\nsweetened and diet sodas were separately dichotomized as 0\u00ad1\n(reference) vs. 2 or more drinks per day. The choice of this\ncutpoint was based on preliminary analyses, which showed the\nassociation between sugary drinks and albuminuria was similar for\nUnadjusted logistic regression was first conducted for associations\nwith albuminuria. Next, Model 1 adjusted for diet soda\nconsumption (2 or more, vs. 0\u00ad1 per day), age, non-Hispanic\nblack race or Hispanic ethnicity (reference: non-Hispanic white),\ngender, and poverty; following Martins and colleagues, we defined\npoverty as falling below twice the U.S. federal poverty guidelines\n(for a non-elderly household of 2 in the year 2000, this was an\nby self report, according to pre-set categories. A further analysis\nFigure 1. Prevalence of albuminuria among NHANES 1999\u00ad2004 non-diabetics age 20 and over, unadjusted and adjusted for age,\naccording to sugary soft drink consumption.\nSugary Soda and the Kidney\n(Model 2) included several variables assumed to be mediators of\nany association, to see if any association with soda consumption\npersisted. Model 2 included all of the variables in Model 1, plus\nhypertension, glycohemoglobin A1C, total caloric consumption,\nsmoking (current vs. former or never), obesity, total cholesterol,\nand a summary measure of physical activity (the sum of all reported\nphysical activity weighted by metabolic equivalent level or MET for\neach activity, expressed as total MET-minutes; see http://www.cdc.\ngov/nchs/data/nhanes/frequency/paqiaf_doc.pdf for more detail).\nHypertension was a dichotomous variable defined according to\nSeventh Joint National Committee guidelines as systolic blood\npressure $140, diastolic blood pressure $90, self-reported history\nof hypertension and/or use of antihypertensive medication [26].\nIn order to investigate effect measure modification of associa-\ntions, interaction terms were introduced into the model between\nconsuming 2 or more sugary sodas and indicator variables for the\nfollowing: gender (male or female); self-reported race-ethnicity by\npre-defined categories (Non-Hispanic White, reference; Non-\nHispanic Black; or Hispanic of any race); age; and by\noverweight/obesity category ($17.5 & ,25, ``low to normal\nSignificant interaction was defined at the p = 0.10 level, indicating\neffect measure modification and warranting subgroup analyses.\nBecause serum uric acid levels have been associated with fructose\nconsumption [6,27], we assessed interaction with serum uric acid\n(as a continuous variable) and with hyperuricemia (categorically\ndefined as the highest quartile of serum uric acid, 6.3 mg/dL or\nhigher). We then investigated whether any associations between\nsugary soft drinks and albuminuria differed between sugar-\nsweetened or diet colas and non-colas.\nSeveral sensitivity analyses were conducted. Because 24-hour\nrecall is an imperfect measure of caloric intake and has known\npattern of 2+ sodas per day as a function of both BMI category\nand quartile of energy intake. We calculated Pearson x2 p-values\nfor row (BMI category within energy intake quartile) and column\n(energy intake quartile within BMI categories) differences in\nproportion in sugary soda intake; if there are significant biases by\nBMI category, then x2 p-values for rows should be significant. We\nexpect column x2 p-values to be significant, since sugary soda\nconsumption should rise with increasing total daily energy intake.\nTable 1 does not indicate any systematic biases by BMI category,\nexcept for the 2nd quartile of energy intake (p = 0.035);\nnevertheless, the pattern is for greater sugary soda consumption\nto be reported among underweight and obese subjects, which is\nnot consistent with the prediction that underreporting would be\nIn order to determine that the results of Models 1 and 2 were\nnot due to macroalbuminuria, we excluded those subjects with\nused linear regression with log-transformed urinary albumin as the\ndependent variable, and soda consumption (dichotomized as\nabove) as the main exposure of interest, adjusting for age, race,\nethnicity, gender, poverty, and the reciprocal of urinary creatinine;\nwe modeled the log of albumin concentration, rather than ACR,\nas the dependent variable because the latter approach may\nintroduce spurious correlation [33]. Next, a logistic model similar\nto Model 1 was used, but rather than categorizing sugary soda\nconsumption at the cutpoint of 2+ vs. 0\u00ad1, we instead defined\nexposure as highest quintile group of sugary soda consumption (by\ngrams of sugar intake from soda). Further models adjusted for total\nenergy intake (in total kilocalories), alone or in combination with\nbasal metabolic rate (estimated using the Harris-Benedict\nequation, [34]). We then used continuous eGFR in a linear\nmodel, and dichotomized eGFR in logistic models; the dichoto-\nmous models employed both the KDOQI guideline for Stage 3\nResults\nThe study population was distributed evenly by gender and was\npredominantly non-Hispanic White (55.6%); due to oversampling,\n25.5% of the study population was African-American, and 33%\nHispanic. Summary statistics, overall and by albuminuria status,\nare reported in Table 2 (note that results reported in the tables\ntake into account the complex survey design, including over-\nsampling, and extrapolate back to the population from which they\nare drawn). The mean age of the study population was 45.1 years.\nSeventeen percent reported consuming two or more sugary sodas\nprevalence is extrapolated back to the general population).\nParticipants with albuminuria were more likely to be African-\nAmerican, obese, hypertensive, be physically inactive, or live\nbelow twice the poverty line than participants without albumin-\nuria. Mean ACR, triglyceride and total cholesterol level, BMI and\nblood pressures were higher, and mean GFR lower, in\nalbuminuria cases compared to non-cases.

However, younger participants (ages 20\u00ad29) were more\nlikely than older ones (ages 65+) to drink sugary sodas (27.5% vs.\n5.3%; p for trend,0.001), yet the younger subjects are also less\nlikely to have albuminuria. Figure 1 shows that there is no crude\nrelationship between sugary sodas and albuminuria (p for\ntrend = 0.84), while age adjustment reveals a clear, positive dose-\nresponse relationship (p for trend,0.001).\nUsing the ``basic'' Model 1, adjusting for consumption of 2 or\nmore diet sodas per day, age, race-ethnicity, gender, and living\nbelow twice the poverty level (Table 3), there was 40% increased\nodds of having albuminuria associated with consuming two or\nmore sugary sodas per day (odds ratio [OR]: 1.40; 95% confidence\nassociated with albuminuria. Model 2 (Table 3), which added\nseveral variables thought to be confounders and mediators of the\nsugary soda and albuminuria association, yielded similar results to\nThere was no interaction between sugary soda consumption\nand age (p = 0.14), black or Hispanic race-ethnicity (p = 0.88 and\n0.33, respectively), continuous serum uric acid level (p = 0.52), or\nhyperuricemia (p = 0.35).

We conducted a stratified analysis, fitting Model 1\nwithin categories of underweight, optimal weight, overweight, and\nTable 2.

Because the relationship between sugary soda consump-\ntion and albuminuria appears to be modified in a quadratic\nmanner (Figure 2), we added to the variables in Model 1 the\nfollowing: BMI, BMI-squared, and interaction terms between soda\nconsumption and continuous BMI and BMI-squared (respective p-\nvalues for interaction: 0.04 and 0.10). Due to the interaction terms,\nthere is no true main effect for sugary soda consumption in this\nmodel. The results are reported in Figure 3, which shows that the\nstrongest association between sugary soda consumption and\nalbuminuria was at the low end of BMI: at 18.7 kg/m2 (the\nmidpoint of the lowest decile of BMI), the odds ratio was 2.48\nconclude that sugary sodas are most strongly associated with\nalbuminuria at the low end of body weight.\nWe then categorized sugary soda consumption as sugary cola,\nsugary non-cola, diet cola, and diet non-cola, with the reference\nbeing all other beverages. The strongest associations appeared for\nconsuming 2 or more sugary non-colas per day (OR = 1.77;\nconsumption were not associated with albuminuria. Adjusting\nfor basal metabolic rate (BMR) yielded comparable results to\nModel 1; energy intake adjustment yielded similar results to model\nincluded in the model.

Excluding subjects\nwith macroalbuminuria had no appreciable effect on the estimates.\nWhen we fit a linear regression model with log-transformed\nurinary albumin as the outcome, we obtained results consistent\nwith Model 1: consumers of 2 or more sugary soft drinks having on\naverage 1.13 mg/L higher albumin concentration than consumers\n2+ sugary drinks were significant for gender (p = 0.03), and for\noverweight (p = 0.01) but not for obesity (p = 0.42). Furthermore,\nlog-transformed urinary albumin concentration was 1.09 mg/L\nhigher among drinkers of 2 or more sugary colas (95% CI: 1.01,\ndrinkers; neither diet colas nor non-colas were related to\nalbuminuria. Modeling continuous eGFR as a function of the\ncovariates used in Model 1 did not yield statistically significant\nassociation with sugary soda consumption (p = 0.586); there was\nalso no association when Stage 3 CKD (defined by eGFR,60 ml/\nmin/1.73 m2) was substituted as the dependent variable in model\nindicating that there may be an association between sugary soda\nand more advanced CKD.\nDiscussion\nWe have found an association between sugar-sweetened sodas\nand albuminuria, which is a marker of early kidney damage. To\nour knowledge, this is the first report of such an association. In the\nUnited States, sugary sodas are predominantly sweetened with\nhigh fructose corn syrup [9,37]. Over the past 30 years, both the\navailability of HFCS [38] and sugary soft drink consumption [8]\nhave risen markedly. The prevalences of obesity, diabetes, and\nESRD have all followed these trends; Figure 4 shows the temporal\ncorrelation of ESRD due to diabetes with calories due to high\nfructose corn syrup and soda consumption [6,7]. While ESRD\nrates prior to 1992 may have risen due to better recognition and\nexpanding treatment by renal replacement therapy, more recent\ntrends likely reflect genuine increases in kidney failure [1,39].\nBecause there are many unobserved characteristics that also\nchange over time, inferring causation from correlated trends is\nproblematic. Nevertheless, the finding of an individual-level\nassociation between sugary soda consumption and albuminuria\nare consistent with the hypothesis that HFCS is contributing to the\nkidney disease epidemic [6,7]. We note that neither diet soda nor\nmoderate intake of one serving of sugary soda was associated with\nalbuminuria in this study.\nTable 3.

It is not clear why females should be\nmore susceptible to sugary soft drinks than males. Women were\nmuch less likely to consume 2 or more sugary drinks per day,\neliminating residual confounding as an explanation. Women are\nalso more likely to under-report (and men more likely to over-\nreport) their energy intake according to perceived social norms\n[40]. Such misclassification may differentially bias results toward\nthe null, because the absolute degree of under- or over-reporting\ndiffers by gender. Biological differences, such as lower energy\nintake need among women, might also account for the interaction\nof consumption and gender. However, this interaction was not an\nFigure 2.

If subjects are already obese, and\ntheir albuminuria is due to obesity, then any additional effects of\nsugary sodas would be attenuated. Alternatively, differential\nreporting may account for the apparent lack of association among\nthe overweight and obese, as food intake is more likely to be\nunderreported as BMI increases and body image satisfaction\ndecreases [31,32]. Nevertheless, underreporting by BMI is not\nsupported by these data, as evidenced by the lack of a significant\nassociation between BMI categories and sugary soda consumption\nwithin quartiles of energy intake (Table 1).\nOur results suggest that fructose may be nephrotoxic via\npathways other than diabetes, long-term blood glucose level,\nhypertension, or obesity, because adjusting for these potential\nmediators did not eliminate the association. We caution that\nmediator-adjusted models are not causal models, and they rarely\nmeet the conditions necessary to accurately identify independent\neffects of the main exposure [41]. Nevertheless, were these factors\nto truly explain our findings, we should have seen greater\nattenuation of the odds ratio than we did. It may be that fructose\ncauses both kidney damage and obesity in parallel. Although\nfructose has not been directly linked to kidney disease, Johnson\nand Nielson have speculated that it may be directly pathogenic to\nhuman kidneys [6,7]. The results are consistent with laboratory\nstudies implicating fructose in rat models of kidney disease\n[42,43,44]. Johnson hypothesized that fructose \u00ad kidney associa-\ntions may be explained by uric acid [6]. However, adjustment for\nuricemia did not attenuate this association in our study.\nIdentification of pathways leading from albuminuria to kidney\ndamage would strengthen the case for the observed association\nbeing a causal one.\nRecent reports have shown that fructose consumption in the\nform of soft drinks increases the risk of kidney stones and gout\n[45,46], which suggest a link between soda consumption, high\nfructose corn syrup, and chronic kidney disease. Diet sodas have\nalso been associated with the development of metabolic syndrome\n[47,48], which is itself a risk factor for CKD, although we did not\nfind an association. We know of just one prior study directly\nexamining soda consumption and kidney disease. Saldana and\ncolleagues conducted a case-control study of 465 newly diagnosed\nchronic kidney disease patients in North Carolina, comparing\ntheir carbonated beverage consumption to 467 community\ncontrols [20]. They found an association between sugar-sweetened\nand diet colas with CKD, but not non-cola carbonated beverages.\nOur study differs from theirs in several respects. First, we used\nalbuminuria as the outcome variable rather than diagnosed CKD.\nAlbuminuria is a subclinical condition that may appear years\nbefore diagnosed CKD, and CKD may follow pathophysiological\npathways that do not involve albuminuria. Second, the focus of\nSaldana's analysis was on carbonated beverages and cola\nconsumption, not sugary soft drinks. They found similar odds\nratios of sugar-sweetened and diet colas with CKD, while we\nfound an association only with sugar-sweetened sodas, but not diet\ncolas or other diet sodas. Third, they asked subjects to recall\naverage adult beverage consumption prior to 1980, while\nNHANES was a cross sectional study that employed a 24-hour\nrecall instrument. Studies relying on retrospective recall may yield\nbiased results [49], although Saldana and colleagues discount the\npossibility of differential recall because data were collected before\nresearchers suspected cola consumption might be linked to kidney\ndisease. Another potential reason for the differences in findings is\nthat carbonated beverages were overwhelmingly sweetened with\nsucrose in the early 1980s [50], perhaps accounting for Saldana's\nfinding of similar associations between sugar-sweetened and diet\ncola beverages; in contrast, HFCS was in wide use when our study\nwas conducted (see Figure 4) [38]. Finally, our study used\nnationally representative data, while theirs was confined to\nhospital patients and community controls in North Carolina.\nSeveral limitations must be noted. First, this study was cross-\nsectional, precluding us from observing longitudinal associations.\nIn particular, we could not determine if the complex interaction\nbetween BMI, soda consumption, and albuminuria was confound-\ned by processes such as wasting associated with chronic disease\n[51]. Second, the NHANES surveys employ a 24 hour dietary\nrecall and did not have measurement of diet over time, which may\nhave led to underreporting of intake by obesity status. However,\n24 hour recall provides valid estimates of group-average dietary\nintake [30]. Third, we did not have a direct measurement of intake\nof HFCS, which is ubiquitous in the American diet. If HFCS is the\nsalient exposure, and non-consumers of sugary sodas have\nsignificant intake of HFCS from other sources, then we may have\nmisclassified people by using soda consumption, underestimating\nthe true effect. Fourth, albuminuria was assessed using a single\nspecimen. In a random population-based sample (including non-\ndiabetics), microalbuminuria persist in only 61% of participants\nwith a single positive result [52]. Nevertheless, albuminuria\npersistence should be non-differential with respect to soda\nconsumption, making the results reported here underestimates.\nFinally, tastes serve as markers of social class [53], suggesting that\nsoda consumption is linked to myriad lifestyle factors that have not\nbeen fully captured here. This leaves open the possibility that these\nresults are due to residual confounding, a problem generic to\nnutritional epidemiology studies. Understanding why sugary soda\ndrinkers consume these beverages, while others do not, would\nimprove both control of confounding, and potentially lead to more\nsuccessful interventions.\nIn spite of these limitations, several strengths deserve mention.\nFirst, we used nationally representative data drawn from the\nNHANES surveys, yielding population-based measures of associ-\nFigure 4.

Second, because we had over 9,000\nsubjects and over 1,000 cases, we could explore effect measure\nmodification (interactions) and estimate associations within\nsubgroups of participants. Third, the richness of the NHANES\ndataset allowed us to adjust for a host of potential confounders and\nmediators, and associations with sugary soda consumption\nremained elevated even after adjusting for these factors. We\nconducted several sensitivity analyses, including modeling the log\nof albumin excretion, use of energy intake to define soda\nconsumption, and adjustment for overall energy intake and basal\nmetabolic rate. The associations were robust to different\ndefinitions of exposure, outcome, and adjustment factors. Finally,\nwe found that the association of sugary soda consumption with\nassociation with albuminuria, which may reflect an association\nwith more advanced chronic kidney disease [35]\nIn conclusion, we have found that sugary soft drink consump-\ntion is associated with albuminuria. While these results are\nconsistent with prior knowledge, they can only suggest that HFCS\nplays a causal role in kidney disease. Longitudinal studies, with\nmeasures of HFCS and other sugar consumption, are needed to\nformally test this hypothesis. At this point in time, policy\nrecommendations regarding soda consumption or HFCS would\nbe premature. Our findings should be seen in the context of\ndisparate associations with CKD and metabolic syndrome that\nhave recently been found for colas (but not sugary non-colas) and\ndiet sodas [20,47,48]. Additional study is needed before we may\ndetermine whether these findings are due to unmeasured lifestyle\nfactors, other residual confounders, or truly causal associations.\n"
