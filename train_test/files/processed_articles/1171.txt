Design and Methods:\nThe study used 12 years of longitudinal data from\na nationally representative sample of community-\nNonlinear multilevel models used self-reported health\ncare service utilization (physician visits and hospital\nadmissions) to predict racial/ethnic differences in\ndisability (activities of daily living and mobility\nlimitations). The models also evaluated the roles of\nother predisposing (age and gender), health need\n(medical conditions and self-rated health), and en-\nabling factors (health insurance, education, income,\nand wealth). Results: Blacks and Latinos utilizing\nphysician visits and hospital admissions were associ-\nated with significantly more activity of daily living\ndisability than Whites (p , .001). Blacks utilizing\nphysician visits (p , .001) and hospital admissions\n(p , .05) and Latinos utilizing hospital admissions\n(p , .05) were associated with more mobility\ndisability than Whites. Other predisposing, health\nneed, and enabling factors did not account for these\nracial/ethnic differences. Implications: Nationally,\nhealth care use for Blacks and Latinos was associated\nwith more disabilities than for Whites after we ac-\ncounted for predisposing, health need, and enabling\nfactors. The findings suggest that improving health\ncare quality for all Americans may supersede equal\naccess to health care for reducing ethnic and racial\ndisparities in functional health.\nKey Words: Activities of daily living, Mobility,\nHealth disparities, Andersen behavioral model of\nhealth services utilization, Multilevel modeling\nAbout 20% to 30% of community-dwelling older\nadults report disability, or difficulties performing ac-\ntivities of daily living (ADLs; Adams, Hendershot, &\nMarano, 1999). Disabilities in self-care and physical\nfunctioning are associated with a loss of indepen-\ndence, an increased need for health care services, and\nsubsequently higher health care costs (Liu, Wall, &\nolder adults with these disabilities have 3 times the\nmedical expenditures of those without these disabil-\nities (Trupin, Rice, & Max, 1996). The leading cause\nof disability is chronic disease, with disease type and\nseverity varying the level of functional disability and\nthe need for health care services (Fried & Guralnik,\n1997). In a widely used behavioral model of health\nservices use, Andersen and Newman (1973) suggested\nthat economic access to health care (or enabling\nfactors) and predisposing factors (e.g., age, gender,\nand race/ethnicity) also influence disability and the\nuse of health care services.\nWe would like to acknowledge Dr. Peter Lichtenberg for his helpful\ncomments on this article.

Although disability\nrates among elders have been declining overall,\nracial/ethnic differences in disability persist (Schoeni\net al., 2005). This may be because Blacks and\nLatinos have more underlying medical problems\nthan Whites, including diabetes and heart conditions,\npoorer self-rated health (Angel & Angel, 1998;\nSchoenbaum & Waidmann, 1997), and fewer eco-\nnomic resources to pay for needed health care services\n(Gornick et al., 1996; Schoenbaum & Waidmann,\nethnic differences in disability may also result from\ndifferences in health care treatment and quality, with\nolder Blacks and Latinos disadvantaged relative to\nWhites (Ayanian, Cleary, Weissman, & Epstein, 1999;\nEscarce, Epstein, Colby, & Schwartz, 1993).\nThis study used the Andersen (Andersen &\nNewman, 1973) behavioral model of health services\nutilization to conceptualize the relationship between\nracial/ethnic differences in disability and the use of\nhealth care services, accounting for other predispos-\ning (age, gender), health need (medical conditions\nand self-rated health), and enabling (economic access\nto health care services) factors.\nHealth Care Service Utilization\nMinorities may have more economic barriers to\nhealth care and may use fewer health care services\nthan Whites (Gornick et al., 1996; Kington & Smith,\n1997). As a result of delayed care, Blacks and Latinos\nmay enter the health care system with more severe\nmedical conditions and more preventable hospital-\nizations than Whites (Ebell, Smith, Kruse, Drader-\nGourin & Podolsky, 2006; Horner, Lawler, & Hainer,\n1991), though this is contested (Blustein, Hanson, &\nShea, 1998). Some studies have argued that economic\naccess to health care services does not explain racial/\nethnic differences in health service use. For example,\nFiscella, Franks, Doescher, and Saver (2002) reported\nthat racial/ethnic differences in the use of health care\nservices persisted after the researchers accounted for\nhealth insurance type and income. Dunlop, Manheim,\nSong, and Chang (2002) reported similar results\namong an older adult population.\nCultural differences in care-seeking behaviors may\ninfluence health care service utilization. Though some\nstudies have found no racial differences in the\nwillingness to use health care services (Schnittker,\nPescosolido, & Croghan, 2005), other studies have\nshown that Black and Latino adults have more\ndistrust than Whites of medical research, clinicians,\nand a physician's judgment (Corbie-Smith, Thomas,\nWilliams, & Moody-Ayers, 1999). As a result, mi-\nnority group members may rely more than Whites on\nhospital-based and community health clinics, which\nhave been associated with lower quality care than\nprivate physicians (Henry J. Kaiser Family Founda-\ntion, 2007). Minorities may also be less likely than\nWhites to adhere to prescribed medications, which\nmay negatively influence health outcomes (Hall,\nDisparities in the Health Care System\nRacial/ethnic differences in the use of health care\nservices may not explain some disparities in the health\ncare system, however. There are notable differences in\nhealth care treatment and quality among older Black,\nLatino, and White patients. For example, older Black\npatients receive poorer management of chronic\nconditions than older Whites (Ayanian et al., 1999;\nDavis, Liu, & Gibbons, 2003). Studies examining\nhospital discharge data have found that older Blacks\nand Latinos are also less likely than Whites to receive\na wide range of medical procedures, including revas-\ncularization after coronary angiography (Ayanian,\nUdvarhelyi, Gatsonis, Pashos, & Epstein, 1993;\nHarris, Andrews, & Elixhauser, 1997; Peterson,\nWright, Daley, & Thibault, 1994), surgical resection\nfor early-stage lung cancer (Bach, Cramer, Warren, &\nBegg, 1999), bone marrow transplants for leukemia\nandlymphoma(Mitchell,Meehan,Kong,&Schulman,\n1997), beta blocker medications for heart attack, and\neyeexaminationsfordiabetes(Schneider,Zaslavsky,&\nEpstein, 2002). Additionally, these racial/ethnic dif-\nferences in treatment have not been explained by\nhospital size, type, or location; health insurance; or\ndisease severity (Giles, Anda, Casper, Escobedo, &\nOlder minority group members may also benefit less\nthan Whites do from improvements in health care\ntreatments. For example, Escarce and colleagues\n(1993) showed that older Whites have better access\nto new procedures and other specialized and high-\ntechnology services than do older Blacks.\nRacial/ethnic differences in access to quality\nphysicians and medical care may partly explain these\nindividual differences in health care treatment and\nquality. Blacks are more likely than Whites to rely on\nneighborhood health centers, outpatient hospital care,\nor emergency rooms for health care, whereas Whites\naremorelikelytohaveprivatephysicians(forareview,\nsee Mayberry, Mili, & Ofili, 2000; Walls, Rhodes, &\nKennedy, 2002). In addition to less satisfactory\npatient\u00adphysician relationships, the health care set-\ntings used predominantly by minorities are character-\nized by longer wait times, overcrowding, and less\ncontinuity of care (Derlet, Richards, & Kravitz, 2001).\nOlder Blacks, Whites, and Latinos may also have\ndifferent physicians and seek care in different\nhospitals (Bach, Pham, Schrag, Tate, & Hargraves,\n2004; Barnato, Lucas, Staiger, Wennberg, & Chandra,\nserving predominantly minority patients are less likely\nto be board certified and have less access to clinical\nresources (Bach et al., 2004). Additionally, hospitals\nserving predominantly minority patients are more\nlikely to have nursing shortages and to be inade-\nquately funded (Mannion, Davies, & Marshall, 2005).\nThe aim of this study was to adapt the Andersen\n(Andersen & Newman, 1973) behavioral model of\nhealth services utilization to examine racial/ethnic\ndifferences in the relationship between functional\ndisability and the use of health care services. Though\nresearchers have widely used this model to predict\nhealth service utilization, our application of this\nmodel extends beyond its original scope. Previous\nwork has shown greater health need, fewer enabling\nresources, and poorer health care treatment and\nquality among older minorities compared to Whites.\nBased on the literature documenting disparities in\nhealth care treatment and quality, we hypothesized\nthat older Blacks and Latinos utilizing health care\nservices would have more functional disability than\nWhites independent of other predisposing (age,\ngender), health need (medical conditions and self-\nrated health), and enabling (education, income, and\nwealth) factors. Because we lacked data to explicitly\nexamine racial/ethnic differences in the quality of\nhealth care services, we made the assumption that\nsome of the racial/ethnic differences in functional\ndisability may be associated with racial/ethnic differ-\nences in health care service treatment and quality.\nMethods\nData\nThe Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is\na nationally representative ongoing longitudinal mul-\ntistage probability survey of community-dwelling\nolder adults. The first wave of the HRS occurred in\ninterviewed subsequently every 2 years. Further details\non the HRS design and methods have been published\npreviously (see Heeringa & Connor, 1995). We ana-\nthat were prepared by the RAND Center for the\nStudy ofAging(RANDHRS).The benefitsof using the\nRAND HRS data include a collection of detailed\nhealth, socioeconomic status, and utilization informa-\ntion and the use of bracketing methods to minimize\nnonresponse for these data (RAND HRS Data, 2006).\nIn order to generalize our findings to the community-\ndwellingolderadultpopulation,weexcludedfromthis\nstudy respondents with sampling weights of zero\n(indicating they were institutionalized or deceased).\nPrevious work has suggested that attrition rates\nin the HRS are comparable to those of other panel\nsurveys (Groves & Couper, 1998) and that sample\nattrition has not significantly influenced the repre-\nsentativeness of the remaining sample based on de-\nmographic, economic, and health measures (Cao &\nHill, 2005). Data were weighted using HRS\nrespondent-level sampling weights to account for\nthe sample design in the HRS (Heeringa & Connor,\nadults in our sample after we excluded proxy inter-\nviews from respondents unable to answer survey\nquestions independently at baseline. More than 80%\nwas Latino, and 2% identified as ``other.''\nVariable Measurement\nIn this study, the main variables of interest were\nmeasured at baseline (1992) and subsequently every\n2 years except for gender, race/ethnicity, and educa-\ntion, which were fixed. This allowed us to examine\nintraindividual changes in health need, enabling\nfactors, and associated disability over the course of\nthe survey.\nDependent Variables\nAs this study was primarily interested in disabilities\nin self-care and functioning that are associated with\na loss of independence and increased health care costs\n(Clark, Stump, Hui, & Wolinsky, 1998; Liu et al.,\n1997), we measured disability by ADLs and mobility.\nRespondents were asked if they needed assistance(yes/\nno) performing any of five basic ADLs (walking across\na room, bathing, eating, dressing, and getting into and\nout of bed) and if they had some difficulty (yes/no)\nwalking one block, walking several blocks, walking\nacross a room, climbing one flight of stairs, and\nclimbing several flights of stairs. Based on responses to\nthese questions, we scored respondents on two scales\nranging from 0 to 5, with 5 indicating the most\ndisabilities on each scale. We did not examine further\ninstrumental ADLs because these questions were\nasked inconsistently over the course of the survey.\nIndependent Variables\nThe main independent variables of interest in this\nstudy were race/ethnicity and the use of health care\nservices. We measured race/ethnicity by using three\nmutually exclusive racial/ethnic classifications: (non-\nLatino) Black, Latino, and (non-Latino) White. We\nused HRS respondents from the other racial/ethnic\ngroups as controls in our analysis and do not report\ntheir results here. We measured health care service\nuse by self-reports of physician visits and hospital\nadmissions. Respondents were asked how many\ntimes they had visited a physician or had a hospital\nadmission in the past 12 months (at baseline) and\nbetween survey interviews (every 2 years). There is\nevidence that older adults underreport their use of\nhealth care services and that distributions of health\nservice use are non-normal (Roberts, Bergstralh,\nSchmidt, & Jacobsen, 1996; Wallihan, Stump, &\nCallahan, 1999). In an attempt to address this issue,\nwe log-transformed reports of service use. Through\nlog-transformations, we captured the variance in\nhealth service use over time while also drawing\noutlying data from a skewed distribution closer to\nthe bulk of the data.\nGuided by the Andersen (Andersen & Newman,\n1973) model of health services utilization, we\naccounted for other predisposing factors associated\nwith the use of health care services, including gender\n(male = 0, female = 1) and age (which was group\nmean centered at age 65 for ease of interpreta-\ntion and to restrict problems with collinearity;\nRaudenbush & Bryk, 2002). To account for health\nneed, we included self-reports (yes/no) of doctor-\ndiagnosed medical conditions including diabetes or\nhigh blood sugar; cancer or a malignant tumor of\nany kind except skin cancer; chronic lung disease\nexcept asthma, such as bronchitis or emphysema;\nheart problems (heart attack, coronary heart disease,\nangina, congestive heart failure, or other heart prob-\nlems); and stroke (Angel & Angel, 1998; Kington &\nResearchers have reported reasonable concordance\nvalues between self-reports of medical conditions\nand medical chart reviews (Bush, Miller, Golden, &\nfor self-rated health (a Likert scale ranging from 0\u00ad4,\nwhere 4 is poor health), as it is highly correlated with\nphysician-assessed health conditions and is a global\nevaluation of health status (Idler & Kasl, 1991).\nWe measured enabling factors by education (0\u00ad17\u00fe\nyears), income (logged value of total household\nincome, including earnings, pensions, and Social\nSecurity), wealth (logged value of wealth, including\nall assets minus the sum of all debt, including mort-\ngages), and health insurance (Medicare, Medicaid,\nVeterans/other governmental, employer provided,\nprivate, and no insurance).\nData Analysis\nWe used multilevel statistical modeling using\nHierarchical Linear Modeling software Version 6.02\n(HLM; Scientific Software International, Lincoln-\nwood, IL) to examine individual and aggregate levels\nof data over time and to account for the complex\nHRS sampling design and the subset analyzed.\nBasically, multilevel modeling in HLM conceives of\neach individual as having his or her own regression\nequation. Multilevel modeling in HLM has several\nbenefits. When used to examine growth curve\nmodels, HLM provides a powerful statistical tool to\ntest hypothesized models of growth or change. Also,\nbecause multiple observations are nested within each\nperson over time, the number and spacing of time\npoints can vary across cases (Raudenbush & Bryk,\n2002). HLM also handles missing data through\niterative, numerical approaches.\nMany functional disability distributions, such as\nthose used in this study, can be non-normal, reflecting\nthe higher frequency of intact functioning among the\ngeneral older adult population. As such, we considered\nalternative disability distributions in HLM. Nonlinear\nmodels that modeled Poisson distributions of the ADL\nand mobility data fit better than the linear models. We\nreport here the results of the nonlinear analyses. In\neach of the disability models, we tested a growth term\n(age2) for growth curve analysis (Raudenbush & Bryk,\n2002) and accounted for other predisposing factors\n(age and gender) to examine racial/ethnic differences\nin the relationship between the use of health care\nservices and functional disability. Next we sequen-\ntially added health need (medical conditions and self-\nrated health) and enabling (education, income, and\nwealth) factors to the disability models.\nResults\nBivariate Results\nAs shown in Table 1, there were racial/ethnic\ndifferences in medical conditions and self-rated\nhealth, with Blacks and Latinos disadvantaged\nrelative to Whites. Minority group members were\nalso more likely than Whites to have Medicaid or no\ninsurance and were less likely than Whites to have\nprivate or employer insurance. Blacks and Latinos\nalso had fewer years of education, less income, and\nless wealth than Whites. In this study, ADL and\nmobility disabilities were modestly correlated with\neach other (r = .52), self-rated health (ADL, r = .30;\nmobility, r = .51), and medical conditions (ADL,\nThere were also racial/ethnic differences in the use\nof health care services and disability over the course\nof the survey (see Table 2). Throughout much of the\nsurvey period, Latinos were less likely than Whites to\nreport a physician visit, and Blacks were more likely\nto report more frequent visits to physicians than\nWhites. In the early years of the survey, Blacks were\nmore likely than Whites to report a hospital admis-\nsion and reported more frequent hospital admis-\nsions. Minorities were also more likely than Whites\nto have ADL and mobility disabilities over the course\nof the survey.\nMultivariate Results\nThe significance of the growth term indicated that\nADL disability increased with age, and this model\nwas maintained throughout the analysis (data not\nshown).

These findings provide support\nfor our hypothesis that racial/ethnic differences in\nfunctional disability may be associated with racial/\nethnic differences in health care service treatment\nand quality. These findings were not accounted for\nby other predisposing (age and gender), health need\n(medical conditions and self-rated health), and\nenabling factors (economic access to health care),\nwhich have been shown to influence health service\nutilization (Andersen, 1995; Andersen & Newman,\nOur study findings are consistent with those of\nSchoeni and colleagues (2005), who reported persis-\ntent racial/ethnic differences in disability. These\nfindings are also consistent with those of Wolinsky\nand Johnson (1991), who reported that older\nminority group members were no less likely than\nolder Whites to utilize health care services after the\nresearchers accounted for health need and enabling\nfactors. In this study, older Blacks with enabling\nfactors conducive to accessing health care services\nwere more likely than older Whites to visit\nphysicians. These findings contrast with those of\nDunlop and associates (2002), who found that older\nBlacks and Latinos were less likely than Whites to\nutilize health care services, even after the authors\naccounted for economic access. Our findings may\ndiffer because we examined respondent-level changes\nin health need, enabling factors, and health care\nservice use over time and accounted for self-rated\nhealth in our analysis.\nSeveral potential explanations for our findings\nshould be considered. One explanation is that the\nobserved racial/ethnic differences in disability reflect\nthe severity of the medical conditions in our study\npopulation. In this study, health need better\nexplained mobility disability among Latinos. How-\never, health need did not explain the other racial/\nethnic differences in functional disability found in\nthis study. Although some studies have found that\nminority group members enter the health care system\nin worse health than Whites (Ebell et al., 1995;\nstudies have argued that disease severity does not\nexplain racial/ethnic differences in health outcomes\net al., 2002). We were unable to investigate this\npossibility directly because there are no data on the\nseverity of respondents' medical conditions in the\nHRS. Nonetheless, because we captured prevalent\nand incident cases of medical conditions over the\ncourse of 12 years and this, along with enabling\nfactors, explained the racial/ethnic variance in\nservice utilization, we believe that this explanation\nis unlikely, or at least that disease severity alone does\nnot explain the robust association between service\nuse and disability found in this study.\nAnother possible explanation for our findings is\nthat there are racial/ethnic differences in quality of\ncare. Previous work has shown that racial/ethnic\ngroups receive poorer chronic disease management\nand fewer medical procedures and treatments than\nSchneider et al., 2002). Focusing on the ways in\nwhich minority group members receive differential\ntreatment than Whites may reduce disparities in\nhealth care services. Whites are also more likely than\nminority group members to have private physicians,\nwhereas Blacks and Latinos are more likely to use\nneighborhood health centers, outpatient hospital\ncare, or emergency rooms for their health care needs\n(Derlet et al., 2001; for a review, see Mayberry et al.,\nto primary care and dealing with issues such as\novercrowding and longer wait times in emergency\nrooms may be effective strategies for reducing racial/\nethnic disparities in health care (Derlet et al., 2001;\nHasnain-Wynia et al., 2007). Older Blacks and\nLatinos may also seek care from different physicians\nand use different hospitals than Whites. Physicians\nserving predominantly White patients are more likely\nto be board certified and have access to more clinical\nresources than those physicians serving mostly\nminorities (Bach et al., 2004). Hospitals serving\npredominantly Whites are more likely to be non-\nprofit or major teaching hospitals than those serving\nTable 4.

The health care\nresources available to Whites compared to minorities\nare associated with better health outcomes. These\ndifferences in health care resources may explain the\nfindings of this study.\nThere are several limitations worth considering\nwhen interpreting the results. First, we recognize that\nhealth care service use rates are incomplete indica-\ntors of access to health services and only record the\nnumber of contacts with health professionals. We\nattempted to address this issue in this study by\napplying the Andersen (Andersen, 1995; Andersen &\nNewman, 1973) model to account for health care\naccess enabling factors, health need, and changes in\nthese important factors over the 12-year study\nperiod. Second, information on adherence to treat-\nment was not available in the HRS. Treatment\nadherence, which differs by race/ethnicity, could\nhave affected disability rates in this study. Third, we\nwere unable to examine cultural differences in care-\nseeking behaviors with the available HRS data.\nNevertheless, we found no evidence that older\nminority group members were less likely to utilize\nhealth care services than older Whites once impor-\ntant factors from the Andersen model were consid-\nered. If anything, there was evidence that economic\naccess to physicians may increase utilization of\nhealth care services among older Blacks. Addition-\nally, there is evidence that attrition is a persistent\nproblem in longitudinal studies (Groves & Couper,\n1998). The rates of attrition in the HRS are not\nunique compared to those of other panel surveys (see\nInteragency Household Survey Nonresponse Group,\n1998). To address attrition issues in this study we\nexamined a representative sample of community-\ndwelling older adults who were less at risk for\nmortality than institutionalized older adults and\nexcluded proxy interviews at baseline.\nDespite these limitations, this study provides\nimportant health policy implications. Our findings\nindicate that although improving equality in eco-\nnomic access to health care can result in substantial\nreductions in disparities in the access to and use of\nhealth care services, racial/ethnic disparities in\ndisability would remain. This suggests that improv-\ning economic access to health care services is im-\nportant, but this may not be enough; the availability\nof health insurance does not guarantee equal access\nto high-quality care. These findings are consistent\nwith clinic-based and hospital discharge reports\nsuggesting that health policies are needed that\naddress both the micro (patient/physician interac-\ntion) and macro (clinical resources/access to high-\nquality physicians and hospitals) determinants of\nhealth care quality (Smedley, Stith, & Nelson, 2002).\nFuture studies addressing racial/ethnic differences in\nindividual treatment and structural access to high-\nquality clinicians, hospitals, and other health care\nservices may effectively outline strategies for the\nreduction of disparities in the process and delivery of\nhealth care services.\nReferences\nAdams, P.
