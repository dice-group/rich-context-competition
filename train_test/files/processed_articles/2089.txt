Outcomes were assessed by\nparent or proxy-respondent report. We fit multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models to esti-\nmate associations between urinary cadmium and the outcomes.\nResults: When we compared children in the highest quartile of urinary cadmium with those in the\nlowest quartile, odds ratios adjusted for several potential confounders were 3.21 [95% confidence\nCI: 0.28, 1.61) for ADHD. There were no significant interactions with sex, but associations with\nLD and special education were somewhat stronger in males, and the trend in the ADHD analysis\nwas only evident among those with blood lead levels above the median.\nConclusions: These findings suggest that children who have higher urinary cadmium concentra-\ntions may have increased risk of both LD and special education. Importantly, we observed these\nassociations at exposure levels that were previously considered to be without adverse effects, and\nthese levels are common among U.S. children.\nKey words: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cadmium, learning disability, neurodevelop-\nment, neuropsychological development, NHANES, risk assessment, special education.

Urinary cadmium concentra-\ntion was determined by inductively coupled\nplasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and\ndetails are accessible online via the NHANES\ndetection (LOD) was 0.06 g/L, and cad-\nmium concentrations below the LOD were\nimputed as the LOD divided by the square\n(10%) had urinary cadmium concentrations\nbelow the LOD. Cadmium (Cd) concentra-\ntions were corrected for interference from tin\n(Sn) and molybdenum (Mo), because these\nelements can produce ICP-MS signals (114Sn,\nJarrett et al. 2008). Cadmium concentrations\nthat were below zero after molybdenum cor-\nrection were left-truncated and listed as zero.\nUrinary creatinine is often used to correct\nfor the variation in chemical concentration\nthat is attributable to variation in urine dilu-\ntion when exposure estimates are based on\nspot urine samples (Barr et al. 2005). Because\ncreatinine enters urine at a fairly constant rate,\nurine creatinine concentration is inversely\nproportional to urine flow rate and can be\nused to correct for differences in urine flow\nrate (Barr et al. 2005). In this study urine\ncreatinine levels were determined via a Jaff\u00e9\nrate reaction with a Beckman Synchron CX3\nClinical Analyzer (Beckman Instruments,\nAs recommended by Barr et al. (2005), we\nincluded urine creatinine concentration as an\nindependent covariate in the regression mod-\nels rather than using the ratio of cadmium\nto creatinine (creatinine standardization),\nbecause this approach should be less likely\nto produce biased effect estimates (Barr et al.\nOutcomes. Assessment of neuro\ndevelop\nmental outcomes was based on responses\nof parent, guardian, or other adult proxy\ndren < 12 years of age, LD status was assessed\nwith the following question: \"Has a repre-\nsentative from a school or health professional\never told [you] that [the child] had a learning\ndisability?\"; ADHD status was assessed as fol-\nlows: \"Has a doctor or health professional\never told [you] that [the child] had atten-\ntion deficit disorder?\" For those  12 years\nof age, the same questions were asked about\nLD and ADHD but the bracketed words\nwere replaced with: [the child] and [he/she].\nSpecial education utilization was assessed with\nthe same question regardless of the child's age:\n\"Does [the child] receive Special Education or\nEarly Intervention Services?\"\nCovariates. Data on many potential con-\nfounders were available in NHANES (CDC-\nNCHS 2010b). We considered the following\ncovariates in our analyses: age (years), sex,\nrace/ethnicity [non-Hispanic white (referent),\nnon-Hispanic black, Mexican American, other\nHispanic, other race (including multiracial)],\nmaternal age at birth of child (years), atten-\ndance at preschool/daycare (yes/no), health\ninsurance coverage (yes/no), receipt of neo-\nnatal intensive care unit or special newborn\ncare (yes/no), low birth weight (< 2,500 g;\nyes/no), poverty income ratio (the ratio of\nfamily income to the federal poverty threshold;\nratios  5 are listed as 5), education level of\nthe household reference person (highest grade\nachieved: less than 9th grade, at least 9th grade\nbut no high school diploma, high school grad-\nuate/GED (general educational development)\ndegree or equivalent, some college or associate\nof arts degree, and college graduate or above),\nblood lead level (micrograms per deciliter),\nlow hemoglobin level for age and sex (< 10th\npercentile,  10th percentile; used as a proxy\nfor iron deficiency), report of a smoker in the\nhome (yes/no), serum cotinine (nanograms\nper milliliter), prenatal smoke exposure (i.e.,\nthe child's mother smoked while pregnant;\nyes/no), and, as mentioned above, urine creati-\nnine (milligrams per deciliter). Detailed infor-\nmation on the covariates is available online\nStatistical analysis. Analyses were con-\nducted using SAS (version 9.1.3; SAS Institute\nInc., Cary, NC). We obtained national preva-\nlence estimates for the outcomes by using the\nSURVEYMEANS procedure, specifying strata,\ncluster, and weight variables to account for the\ncomplex sampling design characteristics of\neach of the three outcomes, we estimated the\nrelative odds of each outcome across quartiles\nof urinary cadmium concentration. To do this\nwe fit multivariable-adjusted logistic regres-\nsion models with the SURVEYLOGISTIC\nprocedure, again specifying strata, cluster,\n2010b). Urinary cadmium was evaluated in\nquartiles in order to allow for the detection of\nnon\nlinear dose\u00adresponse relationships, reduce\nthe potential excess influence of data from\nchildren with very high cadmium concentra-\ntions on the effect estimates, and alleviate con-\ncerns about low cadmium levels in the context\nof molybdenum correction and left truncation\nof urinary cadmium levels at zero (when cor-\nrection resulted in a cadmium concentration\nbelow zero).\nWe constructed three main models:\na) logistic regression models relating urinary\ncadmium to each outcome adjusting only for\nurinary creatinine; b) core models adjusted\nfor urinary creatinine, age, sex, blood lead,\nsmoker in the home, serum cotinine, prenatal\nsmoke exposure (mother smoked while preg-\nnant), and poverty income ratio; and c) full\nmodels also adjusted for additional covariates\nof a priori interest that predicted outcomes\n(p < 0.10) in bivariate logistic regression mod-\nels. Continuous and discrete covariates were\nmodeled as single linear terms, except for\nhemoglobin levels. Low hemoglobin levels\nare a proxy for iron deficiency (Zimmermann\n2008). Because normal hemoglobin levels vary\nby age and sex (Ahsan and Noether 2011), we\nmodeled hemoglobin in categories (< 10th\npercentile or  10th percentile for the age and\nsex of the participant).\nPrior studies have suggested an interaction\nbetween cadmium exposure and sex in rela-\ntion to LD, as well as an interaction between\ncadmium exposure and lead exposure in\nrelation to ADHD (Ely et al. 1981; Nation\nsex and cadmium\u00adlead interactions in the\nfully adjusted models by including product\ninteraction terms with cadmium modeled as\nan ordinal trend variable (coded as 0, 1, 2,\nor 3 based on the quartile of exposure) to\nobtain pvalues for each interaction. For the\n\ncadmium\u00adlead interaction, lead was also mod-\neled as an ordinal trend variable. To obtain a\nsingle (summary) effect estimate for urinary\ncadmium with each outcome, we evaluated\nthis cadmium quartile trend variable in the\nfully adjusted models. We also evaluated this\ncadmium quartile trend variable in the fully\nadjusted models (with the sex or blood lead\nterm removed) within strata defined by sex or\nblood lead level (above/below median).

In contrast, children in the\nthree highest quartiles of urinary cadmium\nconcentration had lower odds of ADHD in\nthe both the creatinine-adjusted and fully\nadjusted analyses (Table 3).

However, these\ninteractions were not significant (p = 0.71 for\n\ncadmium\u00adsex in the LD analysis, p = 0.43 for\n\ncadmium\u00adsex in the special education analy-\nsis, and p = 0.43 for cadmium\u00adlead in the\nADHD analysis), and none of the remaining\n\ncadmium\u00adsex or \ncadmium\u00adlead inter\naction\nterms were significant.\nDiscussion\nLD and special education. We observed that\nchildren in the highest quartile of urinary cad-\nmium had significantly higher odds of both\nLD and special education when compared\nwith those in the lowest quartile. A few prior\nstudies have linked cadmium exposure with\nLD, and these studies relied on hair and blood\nsamples to assess cadmium exposure. Two\ncase\u00adcontrol studies demonstrated higher hair\ncadmium concentrations in children with LD\nthird study also found higher hair cadmium\nconcentrations in children with LD, but the\ndifference was statistically significant only\nfor males (Ely et al. 1981). In that study, the\nauthors considered the sexes separately but did\nnot present the type of statistical evaluation for\ninteraction that we report here. Interestingly,\nin our study the sex\u00adcadmium interaction\nwas not significant, but the effect estimate for\nurinary cadmium was larger among males. A\nfourth study reported no association between\naccumulates in the kidney, and urinary cad-\nmium concentration is considered to be a\nmarker of cumulative exposure/body burden,\nwhereas blood cadmium is thought to be a\nbetter indicator of recent exposure (Lauwerys\net al. 1994). The different exposure metric\nused in the Lee et al. (2007) study may help\nexplain the discrepancy in our findings.\nIn addition to higher odds of LD, we\nfound that children in the highest quartile\nof urinary cadmium also had higher odds of\nFigure 1.

Special education\nis a \"catch-all\" outcome that likely involves\na variety of neurocognitive and behavioral\ndysfunctions, including LDs such as reading\ndifficulties, dyslexia, ADHD, and language/\ncommunication disorders, as well as behavior\nproblems, psychiatric conditions, and per-\nhaps some physical dysfunctions. The broad\nheterogeneous nature of both special educa-\ntion and LD as outcome measures prevents\ninferences about specific learning or cognitive\ndomains. We are not aware of prior epide-\nmiologic studies directly relating cadmium\nexposure and special education. However,\nany of the previously mentioned animal or\nhuman studies that link cadmium exposure\nto adverse neurobehavioral/neurocognitive or\ngeneral health outcomes may be relevant here,\nbecause these outcomes could lead to special\neducation placement.\nThere are data supporting the biological\nplausibility of cadmium exposure as a risk\nfactor for LD and special education place-\nment. For example, cadmium can inhibit the\ncalcium flux required for neurotransmitter\nrelease (Hirning et al. 1988; Nation et al.\n1989) and might thereby disrupt the neural\ncommunication required for synaptic network\nformation during development. Cadmium\nhas also been shown to influence the prolif-\neration and differentiation of neuroblasts in\nculture (Gulisano et al. 2009), and there is\nevidence that cadmium could indirectly affect\nthe developing brain by disrupting thyroid\nADHD. Our findings for ADHD did not\nreach statistical significance, but the direc-\ntion of the association suggests a possible\ndecreased risk of ADHD diagnosis in children\nwith urinary cadmium levels above the 25th\npercentile. There is only limited information\nfrom prior epidemiologic studies on cadmium\nexposure and ADHD/executive function. Lee\nsignificant trend\nof increasing odds of ADHD with increasing\nblood cadmium levels that was not present\nafter adjustment for persistent organic pol-\nNHANES data. As mentioned above, the dif-\nferent exposure metrics may partly explain the\ndifference in our findings, because blood cad-\nmium is a marker of recent exposure, whereas\nurine cadmium is a marker of chronic expo-\nreported a non\nsignificant trend of increasing\nproblem behavior scores at 7 years of age with\nincreasing blood cadmium levels measured\nat 2 years of age, but there were no obvious\ntrends with increasing blood cadmium in the\nattention/executive subdomains, the hyper\nactivity subdomain, or the ADHD index. The\nprospective approach is a strength of their\nstudy, but their unique population consisted\nsolely of lead-poisoned children (blood lead\nlevels of 20\u00ad44 g/dL at enrollment), and the\nresults may not be generalizable to non-lead-\npoisoned children.\nPrevious animal-based studies have dem-\nonstrated a variety of seemingly inconsistent\neffects of cadmium exposure on neurophysiol-\nogy and activity levels. These findings include,\nfor example, reduced exploratory activity\nand decreased time spent moving, but they\nalso include hyperactivity, and evidence of\nchanges in central nervous system dopamine\nand serotonin metabolism (Ali et al. 1986;\nThese two neurotransmitter systems have been\nimplicated in the etiology of ADHD (Faraone\net al. 2005). The varied direction of effects\non activity level seen in the animal literature\nmight be related to differences in the timing\nof cadmium exposure during neurodevelop-\nment, the presence of other uncontrolled vari-\nables, and/or the specific phenotype measured\nin each study. We lack detailed information\non exposure timing, which makes it diffi-\ncult to interpret the direction of the ORs for\nADHD in the context of the animal litera-\nture (Andersen and Navalta 2004). If elevated\ncadmium exposure decreased activity levels,\nthis may have made ADHD diagnosis less\nlikely. It is also possible that cadmium may\ncause other neurocognitive dysfunctions that\nserve as competing risks to ADHD diagno-\nsis (perhaps children with other diagnostic\nlabels were less likely to receive an ADHD\nlabel), and the potential influence of chance\nshould not be overlooked. Because these are\ncross-sectional data, the temporal relationship\nTable 2.

Fully adjusted ORs (95% CIs) associated with a one-quartile increase in urinary cadmium\n\nconcentration.\nStratum LD Special education ADHD\nCiesielski et al.\nbetween exposure and outcome is not dis-\ncernable, and it is possible that urinary cad-\nmium concentration tended to decrease after\nADHD diagnosis (e.g., children with ADHD\nmay be more likely to have behaviors that\ndecrease cadmium exposure, absorption, or\nexcretion). In the lead-stratified analysis, we\nfound evidence that the OR for ADHD is\n< 1 only among those with blood lead levels\nabove the median. The interaction was not\nsignificant, but there is toxicologic evidence\nthat cadmium exposure may attenuate lead-\nmediated increases in activity (Nation et al.\n1990). Further research is needed to clarify\nthese issues.\nImplications for cadmium risk assess-\nments. Previous cadmium risk assessments\nhave considered renal effects to be the most\nsensitive end point of cadmium toxicity, and\nthey identified urinary cadmium threshold\nlevels that should protect against renal damage\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the\nrisk assessments by the European Food Safety\nreference levels of 1 and 5.24 g cadmium/g\ncreatinine, respectively. When we excluded\nfrom the analyses the four study participants\nwith urinary cadmium levels above the EFSA\nreference level, the associations between uri-\nnary cadmium and LD/special education were\nstill evident (comparing the highest and lowest\nurinary cadmium quartiles: LD, OR = 3.25;\ndemonstrates associations with LD/special\neducation at urinary cadmium levels below\nboth the WHO and EFSA reference levels.\nIf these associations are replicated in other\npopulations, then neurodevelopmental toxic-\nity may be a sensitive end point to consider in\nfuture cadmium risk assessments. The EFSA\nand WHO risk assessments used toxicokinetic\nmodels to link creatinine-standardized urinary\ncadmium levels to dietary cadmium intake\nin order to estimate dietary intake standards\n2011). These toxicokinetic models were vali-\ndated in adults (Amzal et al. 2009), but they\nare probably not appropriate to use among\nchildren, because exposure routes may differ\n(Weidenhamer et al. 2011) and because urinary\ncreatinine concentration varies markedly with\nsmall increases in age among children (Barr\net al. 2005). Recent work by Weidenhamer\net al. (2011) suggests that mouthing or acci-\ndentally swallowing objects such as inexpensive\njewelry may also contribute significantly to\ncadmium exposure in childhood. The extent to\nwhich these sources contributed to cadmium\nexposure in our population is unknown, but\nfuture risk assessments should not ignore the\npotential impact of non-food-based exposures\nor that current toxicokinetic models are not\nchild specific.\nStrengths and limitations. Exposure. The\nuse of urinary cadmium as an exposure metric\nis a strength of this study. Urinary cadmium\nintegrates exposure over many years (Lauwerys\net al. 1994); thus, if brain development is sen-\nsitive to cadmium exposure in any of the time\nperiods represented by this exposure metric,\nthen this effect could be detected in our analy-\nsis. However, it is not possible to determine\netiologically relevant time windows of exposure\nor to confirm the temporal sequence of expo-\nsure and outcomes based on the available data.\nA shorter time-course exposure metric such\nas blood cadmium (Lauwerys et al. 1994), in\nthe context of a longitudinal prospective study\nthat measures exposure and outcome at several\ntime points, may be able to determine if the\nassociations are driven by exposure that occurs\nin specific developmental windows.\nOutcomes. We believe the diversity of\noutcomes evaluated is a strength of this study,\nbecause the combination of these three out-\ncomes constitutes a screen for common neu-\nrodevelopmental dysfunctions. One limitation\nof these outcome measures is that they were\nderived from parent or proxy-respondent\nreports rather than neuropsychological evalua-\ntions. The use of ADHD treatments as an out-\ncome would have likely identified only a subset\nof ADHD cases, resulting in low case num-\nbers and analyses of limited power (Froehlich\net al. 2007). Neuropsychiatric screening mea-\nsures, such as the National Institute of Mental\nHealth Diagnostic Interview Scale for Children\nthat includes assessment of criteria for ADHD\nbased on the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (CDC-\nhave been more objective, but these outcomes\nwere not present in the publicly available\nNHANES data. Although outcomes were\nclassified based on proxy-respondent reports,\nit is unlikely that outcome misclassification\nwould be differential with respect to exposure\nunless the accuracy of reporting was related to\nunmeasured factors associated with cadmium\nexposure. Typically, non\ndifferential misclassi-\nfication would be expected to bias associations\nConfounding. The extensive covariate data\navailable in NHANES, combined with the large\nsample size and high number of cases, allowed\nus to both evaluate and account for many\npotentially confounding variables. We sought\nto evaluate the association of cadmium exposure\nwith the outcomes after accounting for other\nknown correlates of the outcomes. We evalu-\nated three sets of models: a) models adjusted\nonly for creatinine, b) core models adjusted\nfor primary potential confounders, and c) full\nmodels also adjusted for additional predictors\nof a priori interest. The conclusions from all\nthree of these approaches were consistent. We\nfurther note that adjusting for iron deficiency\nusing low hemoglobin had little effect on the\nresults and does not alter the conclusions of this\nstudy (data not shown). As in any observational\nepidemiology study, we cannot rule out the\npossibility that confounding may have mean-\ningfully affected our results. Potential sources of\nconfounding in these analyses might include a\nlack of detailed information on the home envi-\nronment (Bradley 1993) and parental psycho-\nStudy design. The cross-sectional design\nof NHANES is a limitation of this study,\nbecause the temporal relationships between\nvariables are not discernable. It is possible\nthat higher cadmium exposure puts children\nat greater risk of LD/special education, but it\nis also possible that children with LD/special\neducation have behaviors or prefer foods that\nincrease their cadmium exposure. However,\nwe are unaware of evidence supporting this\nreverse causation explanation.\nThe NHANES study design does offer\nstrengths related to power and generaliz-\nability. To our knowledge, this is the largest\nstudy to evaluate associations between urinary\ncadmium and childhood learning/behavioral\nphenotypes. Because NHANES was designed\nto represent the non\ninstitutionalized U.S.\nings should be generalizable to U.S. children\nConclusions\nThe results of this study are consistent with\na growing body of evidence suggesting that\nelevated cadmium exposure may be associ-\nated with LD and special education. However,\ngiven the cross-sectional design and the nature\nof parent-reported outcomes, interpretations\nshould be cautious. Prospective epidemio-\nlogic investigations and behavioral toxicol-\nogy studies in animals could help to clarify if\nthese associations are causal and if there are\ncritical developmental windows for exposure.\nProspective studies that consider co-exposures\nsuch as lead may also help reveal why the find-\nings for LD/special education and ADHD\ndiffered. Given that the cadmium levels in this\nstudy represent typical exposure levels in U.S.\nchildren, our findings emphasize the need for\nfurther research into the potential neuro\ndevelopmental effects of cadmium exposure.\nReferences\nAgency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. 2008.
