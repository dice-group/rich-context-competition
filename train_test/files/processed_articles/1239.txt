Iron deficiency is believed to be the\nmostcommoncauseofanemiaworldwide(2),butdeficienciesof\nother vitamins, inflammation, infections, and inherited hemo-\nglobin disorders can also cause anemia (3\u00ad5).\nDepending on the cause of anemia, the consequences of the\ncondition are potentially serious and long-lasting. The conse-\nquences of iron deficiency anemia--including impaired cogni-\ntiveandmotordevelopment(6\u00ad9)andincreasedsusceptibilityto\nlead poisoning (10, 11) in young children and impaired aerobic\ncapacity and reduced work productivity (12, 13) in adults--have\nbeen widely reported, but anemia resulting from other nutritional\ndeficiencies or inflammation can also reflect harmful health con-\nditions. Among other possible causes of nutritional anemia, fo-\nlate deficiency is associated with an increased risk of neural tube\ndefects and may also be associated with adverse pregnancy out-\ncomes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and dementia,\nwhereas vitamin B-12 deficiency may be associated with an\nincreased risk of heart disease and neuropathy (14\u00ad18). Anemia\nresulting from vitamin A deficiency may be linked with impaired\nimmunity, growth, and vision (19). Anemia can also indicate\ninflammation caused by a variety of conditions, including infec-\ntion, or it may occur in chronic illnesses such as chronic renal\ndisease or endocrine disorders that can result in decreased eryth-\nEarlierdataindicatedthattheprevalenceofanemiadeclinedin\nwomen of childbearing age (21, 22). The current burden of ane-\nmia in these 2 high-risk groups in the United States is unclear. In\nthepresentstudy,weuseddatafrom2recentNationalHealthand\nlence. We also investigated between-survey changes in the prev-\nalence of several types of anemia, including anemia associated\nwith iron deficiency, folate deficiency, vitamin B-12 deficiency,\nvitamin A deficiency, high blood lead, and inflammation to as-\nsess whether these factors played a role in any observed changes\n1 From the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Cen-\nter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Nu-\ntrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity (SEC, ZM, DSF, and MEC); National\nCenter for Health Statistics (ACL and CLO) and National Center for Envi-\nronmental Health (EG), Atlanta, GA.\n2 The findings and conclusions in this manuscript are those of the authors\nand do not necessarily represent the views of the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention.\n3 Reprints not available.

Identification of a likely cause for changes in\nanemia could highlight existing public health interventions that\nhave been successful or could identify new interventions that\nmight be considered.\nThe NHANES are multistage, nationally representative sur-\nveys of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population (23, 24).\nEach participant is interviewed at home, and most participants\nalso undergo a physical evaluation in a mobile examination cen-\nter. We began with all children aged 12\u00ad59 mo and women aged\nexcluded pregnant women and women whose pregnancy status\n701), any woman with a missing value for red blood cell folate or\nC-reactive protein (CRP), and any participant with a missing\nvalue for hemoglobin, serum ferritin, erythrocyte protoporphy-\nrin, transferrin saturation, or blood lead. We were unable to\ninclude red blood cell folate or CRP in the children's analyses\nbecause they were assessed only in children 4 y during 1988\u00ad\nfor missing laboratory data were as follows: n  2026 children\nsample size for each survey was as follows: n  2786 children\nPhlebotomy refusal was the primary reason for missing labo-\nratory data among children in both surveys (AC Looker, personal\ncommunication) (25). We compared the race/ethnicity distribu-\ntion and income status of children excluded for having missing\nlaboratory values with those of included children and found that\nwhereas the race/ethnicity distribution was not significantly dif-\nferent in either survey, excluded children in both surveys were\nless likely to be of low income (family income 130% of the US\ning laboratory data were more likely to be of low income than\nwere their included counterparts (39% compared with 25%, chi-\nsquare test P  0.02). Excluded women were also more likely to\nbe of non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity than were their included\nFinally, because serum vitamin B-12 and retinol were not\nmeasured for the entirety of both surveys, we constructed a sub-\nsample of women in each survey who also had data for serum\nThis subanalysis was not possible for children because both\nindicators were assessed only in children 4 y during 1988\u00ad\nLaboratory methods\nIn both surveys, blood was collected from study participants\n1 y by venipuncture. Hemoglobin was measured as part of a\ncomplete blood count done with a Coulter S-plus Jr in 1988\u00ad\nCoulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). The laboratory methods for\nother indicators were described in detail elsewhere (26\u00ad28).\nBriefly,serumferritinwasmeasuredbyusingtheBio-RadQuan-\ntImune Ferritin immunoradiometric assay (Bio-Rad Laborato-\nries, Hercules, CA), whereas transferrin saturation was calcu-\nlated as serum iron divided by total-iron-binding capacity, as\nmeasured by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention mod-\nification of the automated Technicon AAII-25 ferrozine colori-\nmetric method (Alpkem TFA analyzer; Alpkem, Clackamas,\nOR). Free erythrocyte protoporphyrin was measured in whole\nblood by fluorescence extraction by using a modification of the\nSassa method. Red blood cell folate was measured with the\nQuantaPhase-I Folate Radioassay Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories)\nrecalibrationoftheassayforwhichappropriateadjustmentswere\nassay also measured serum vitamin B-12.

We defined iron deficiency as having an\nabnormal value for 2 of the 3 following indicators: serum\nferritin, transferrin saturation, and erythrocyte protoporphyrin\n(29). We defined iron deficiency anemia as iron deficiency plus\nanemia.\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were conducted with SAS 8.2 with SUDAAN\n(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and used sample weights to ac-\ncount for differential probabilities of selection and complex sam-\npling design. For children and women in each survey, we first\ncalculated the prevalence of total anemia. Among children, we\nthen calculated the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia, the\nprevalence of high blood lead with anemia, and the prevalence of\nthe coexistence of iron deficiency, high blood lead, and anemia.\nAmong women, we calculated the prevalence of iron deficiency\nanemia, folate deficiency with anemia, high CRP with anemia,\nhigh blood lead with anemia, and the coexistence of 2 of these\nconditions with anemia. We also calculated the prevalence of\nvitamin B-12 deficiency with anemia and the prevalence of vi-\ntamin A with anemia among women in the sub-sample.\nWe then used multiple logistic regression to compare overall\nanemiaprevalenceandtype-specificanemiaprevalencebetween\nthe surveys for children and women, controlling for race/ethnic-\nity, sex (in the children's models), and age. We further adjusted\nthe children's overall anemia model for iron deficiency and high\nblood lead and the women's overall anemia model for iron de-\nficiency, high blood lead, folate deficiency, and high CRP to\nassesstheroleofthesepotentialcausesofanemiainanyobserved\nchange in anemia prevalence.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nBecausepreliminaryanalysesandrecentlypublisheddata(36)\nindicated that the prevalence of folate deficiency declined sig-\nnificantly among women of childbearing age between the sur-\nveys, we used direct standardization to examine the possible\neffect this decline had on the prevalence of anemia between the\nFinally,toinvestigatethepossibilityofasystematicdifference\nin hemoglobin measurement between the surveys, we con-\nstructedmean-differenceplotsforhemoglobinamongwomenby\nfrom hemoglobin values at the corresponding percentile in\nmoglobin in the first survey on the x axis (38).\nRESULTS\nThe racial distribution and income status for children and\nwomen were similar between the 2 surveys, although women in\n130% of the Federal Poverty Threshold than did women in\nAmongchildren,theprevalenceofall-causeanemiadecreased\nsignificantly between the 2 surveys, falling from 8.0% to 3.6%,\nwith a corresponding adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.4 (95% CI:\n0.3, 0.7; Table 3).

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia\nremained low and unchanged between the 2 surveys in both\ngroups, and although the prevalence of folate deficiency with\nanemia did decline significantly among women, changes in the\nprevalence of folate deficiency accounted for little of the overall\ndecline in anemia. Inflammation, high blood lead, vitamin B-12\ndeficiency, and vitamin A deficiency concurrent with anemia\nwere not common in either survey.\nThe majority of anemia among children in both surveys was\nnot associated with iron deficiency or high blood lead. The ob-\nserved low prevalence of iron deficiency anemia among US\npreschool children was likely the result of concerted efforts to\nprevent iron deficiency anemia in this vulnerable age group,\nincluding iron fortification of infant formulas and establishment\nof The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,\nconcentrations have also declined significantly since the 1970s,\nlargelybecauseoftheremovalofleadfromgasolineandsoldered\nThe cause of the decline in the prevalence of anemia among\nchildren between the surveys is thus unclear, and, unfortunately,\nthe lack of data on folate, vitamin B-12, serum retinol, and CRP\namong children surveyed in this age group limited our investi-\ngation of potential causes. Others have reported the importance\nof common infections, including upper respiratory tract infec-\ntion, otitis media, and gastroenteritis as causes of anemia in\npreschool-aged children (20), but whether the frequency of these\ninfections decreased sufficiently between the surveys to contrib-\nute to the decline in all-cause anemia among children is not\nknown.\nIron deficiency anemia was the predominant type of anemia\namong women in both surveys and was most prevalent in black\nand Mexican American women. The cause of the persistently\nhigh prevalence among women in these race/ethnicity groups\nmerits further attention, but may be due to lower socioeconomic\nstatus, lower attained education, or higher parity, all of which are\nassociated with iron deficiency in women of childbearing age\n(30). Nevertheless, the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia did\nnot change significantly between the 2 surveys among all women\nor in any race/ethnicity group and thus seems unlikely to explain\nthe significant decline in the prevalence of all-cause anemia.\nWe did observe a significant decline in the prevalence of\nconcurrent folate deficiency and anemia among women, but this\ndecline appeared to be the result of concomitant, but unrelated,\ndeclines in both folate deficiency and anemia. Several authors\nhave reported multiple beneficial effects of the 1998 folic acid\nfortification of all US enriched cereal-grain products, including\na reduced prevalence of neural tube disorders (44, 45) and lower\nconcentrations of homocysteine (46, 47). No study has evaluated\nthe effect of folic acid fortification on anemia. The timing of\nter fortification) permitted us to evaluate such an association, but\nregression and standardization results failed to prove a relation.\nAnother possible cause of the observed decline in anemia was\na systematic difference in hemoglobin measurement between the\nsurveys, introduced by the use of 2 different models of Coulter\ncounter. A direct investigation, in which both instruments are\nused to measure hemoglobin on the same sera samples, was not\nlonger available. We instead used an indirect approach to assess\nthis possibility by subtracting hemoglobin values at various per-\ncentiles of the first survey from hemoglobin values at the corre-\nsponding percentiles of the second survey and then plotting this\ndifference on the y axis with hemoglobin in the first survey on the\nx axis. These results suggest that a systematic difference in he-\nmoglobin concentrations between the 2 surveys did not play a\nmajor role in the observed decline in the prevalence of anemia,\nbecause the patterns and magnitude of hemoglobin differences\nwere different for each race/ethnicity group.\nHemoglobin difference (g/dL)\nWhite Black Mexican American\nFIGURE 1. Plot of differences in hemoglobin values at various percen-\ntiles for women by race/ethnicity group. Within each race/ethnicity group,\ndifferences in each percentile (from the 1st to the 99th) were smoothed by\nusing lowess, a nonparametric technique based on estimates of the values at\neach point from a weighted regression analysis of neighboring points (38).\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nImportant health trends over the past 3 decades, specifically\nthe decline in cigarette smoking (48) and the increase in over-\nweight and obesity (49, 50), have the potential to affect anemia\nrates, but likely in a direction opposite of what we observed.\nAmong women in NHANES II, smokers had a significantly\nhighermeanhemoglobinconcentrationthandidnonsmokersand\na lower prevalence of anemia (51), but the declining smoking\na lower hemoglobin concentration and a higher prevalence of\nanemia. Similarly, overweight may be associated with an in-\ncreasedriskofirondeficiency(52),whereasahighprepregnancy\nbody mass has been found to be associated with a greater risk of\npostpartum anemia (53), but both would be consistent with an\nincrease, rather than with a decline, in anemia.\nA limitation of our study was the possibility of selection bias\nintroduced by the large number of children with missing labora-\ntory data, due primarily to phlebotomy refusal. Although the\nrace/ethnicity of children with missing laboratory data was not\nsignificantly different from included children, included children\nwere significantly more likely to be of low income, which po-\ntentially inflated the anemia estimates. However, the relative\namountofbiasbyincomeinthe2surveysappearssimilar(1988\u00ad\n44%). This finding suggests that the difference in prevalence\nbetween the surveys observed in our study was unlikely to be\nseriously affected.\nWhereas a much smaller proportion of women than children\nwere excluded because of missing laboratory values, excluded\nwomen in both surveys were more like to be of non-Hispanic\nblack race/ethnicity than were included women, perhaps leading\nto an underestimation of total anemia and/or iron deficiency\nanemia. Again, however, the relative amount of bias by race in\nincome in the excluded sample compared with 12% in the in-\ncludedwomenalsotendedtohaveahigherprevalenceofpoverty\nfor anemia, however, did not change the OR estimates, which\nmade it unlikely that this finding significantly affected our over-\nall results.\nOur restricted ability to assess inflammation was an additional\nlimitation. CRP tends to peak and diminish rapidly and thus may\nnot reflect more chronic inflammatory conditions (54). We were\nalso unable to account for other possible causes of anemia, in-\ncluding hemoglobinopathies, cancer, and aplastic anemia result-\ning from reduced red blood cell production; however, these con-\nditions were probably not common in the children and young\nadult women.\nIn summary, we observed a significant decline in the preva-\nWhereas the explanation for the decline remains unclear, the\nreduced anemia burden among US children and women is nota-\nbleinthatanemiaitselfisassociatedwithmultipleadversehealth\noutcomes, including mild-to-moderate mental retardation in\nchildren (55) and low infant birth weight and increased risk of\npreterm birth in pregnant women (56).
