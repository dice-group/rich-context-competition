Angiotensin-converting\nenzyme (ACE) is one of the major enzymes in the RAS\ncatalyzing the proteolytic conversion of the decapeptide\nangiotensin I (Ang I) to the octapeptide angiotensin II\n(Ang II, Ang 1-8).1,2 Ang II is involved in blood pressure\nand volume homeostasis as well as the development of\nhypertension, by promoting vascular smooth muscle cell\nmigration, hypertrophy and delayed hyperplasia.2 All\ncomponents of the RAS are present in human plasma\nwith renin the rate-limiting enzyme of the RAS, catalyz-\ning the conversion of pro-hormone angiotensinogen\n(10 N-terminal amino acids of the 452 amino acid-secreted\nprotein) to Ang I.3 Ang I is the substrate for the production\nof the other angiotensin metabolites. Angiotensinogen is\nQuantification of systemic\nrenin-angiotensin system peptides\nof hypertensive black and white\nAfrican men established from the\nRAS-Fingerprint\u00ae\nJM van Rooyen1, M Poglitsch2, HW Huisman1, CMC Mels1, R Kruger1,\nL Malan1, S Botha1, L Lammertyn1, L Gafane1 and AE Schutte1,3\n Keywords\nRAS-Fingerprint, renin, blacks, whites, RAS peptides\nHypertension in Africa Research Team (HART), North-West\nUniversity, Potchefstroom campus, South Africa\n2Attoquant Diagnostics, Austria\nMRC Extra Mural Unit: Hypertension and Cardiovascular Disease,\nNorth-West University, South Africa\nCorresponding author:\nJM van Rooyen, Hypertension in Africa Research Team (HART);\nSchool for Physiology, Nutrition, and Consumer Sciences, North-\nWest University, Gerrit Dekker Street, Potchefstroom Campus,\nPotchefstroom, North West Province, 2520, South Africa.\nEmail: johannes.vanrooyen@nwu.ac.za\nOriginal Article\n2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nproduced by the liver and secreted to the circulation, gen-\nerating a pool of angiotensinogen with concentrations in\nTypical baseline values for plasma renin activity (PRA)\nPRA values up to 20 (nmol/l)/h might be reached under\npathologic conditions or on treatment with RAS blockers.5,6\nConcentration and post-translational modifications of angi-\notensinogen can affect PRA.7\nHigh renin levels result in increased Ang II formation,\ncould be detrimental to the vasculature and may play a role\nin hypertension, stroke, retinal detachment, myocardial\ninfarction, heart and kidney failure, renal fibrosis, nephrop-\nathy and albuminuria.3,8,9 However, Opie and Seedat10\nsuggested that low plasma renin might also be one of the\ncontributing factors to hypertension in sub-Saharan black\npopulations and ascribed the low renin levels to be envi-\nronmental in origin. The trend toward low renin levels\nmay also be due to abnormalities such as excessive renal\nsodium reabsorption,10\u00ad12 reduction in the rate of renin\nsecretion13 and genetic abnormalities in the RAS or related\ngenes.10 It seems that not only high renin states but also\nlow renin hypertension is associated with detrimental\nend-organ damage and a worse prognosis compared to\nhypertension with normal renin levels.14,15\nA novel method of RAS analysis\nThe biochemical analysis of the RAS represents a major\nchallenge to analytical procedures, as it is well known that\nthe quantification of angiotensin peptides is associated\nwith technical issues. A novel highly sensitive liquid\nchromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS method1\nresolved the issue of peptide recovery variations during\nsample preparation by using internal standards for each\nindividual angiotensin metabolite.1 Internal standards are\nspiked to each sample before starting extraction proce-\ndures and are simultaneously detected in the final readout\nusing an MS/MS analyzer operated in-line with an ultra-\nperformance LC unit, which allows highly accurate quan-\ntification of angiotensin metabolites in tissue and plasma\nsamples. The second major obstacle in biochemical evalua-\ntion of the RAS in patients is represented by pre-analytical\nvariations. Angiotensin peptides are components of a\nrapidly flowing metabolic pathway characterized by the\nongoing formation and degradation of individual angioten-\nsin metabolites in vivo. Standard procedures are aiming\nto block all enzymes involved in this metabolism during\nblood collection. This is a valid approach if it can be\nensured that the inhibitor cocktail used contains all inhibi-\ntors necessary to block all angiotensin-processing enzymes\ninvolved in peptide metabolism, which is not achieved by\nusing commercially available protease inhibitor tubes,\nusually lacking appropriate renin or aminopeptidase inhib-\nitors. Beside the qualitative composition of these protease\ninhibitor cocktails, the blood collection process itself can\nresult in artifacts if mixing the inhibitor cocktail with the\nblood sample takes too long, which is a critical issue in\nanimal studies using mice.\nWe followed a quantitative and qualitative approach\ncomparing the systemic RAS of hypertensive black and\nwhite African men by using RAS equilibrium analysis.\nEquilibrium analysis provides a valid alternative to the\nmeasurement of circulating angiotensin levels and can\nbe measured in standard Li-heparin or serum samples.\nEquilibrium angiotensin profiles are composed of absolute\nlevels of up to 10 angiotensin metabolites determined in a\nsingle sample and therefore provide an integrated picture\nof the activation state and enzymatic properties of the\nsystemic RAS, which serves as a substrate supply for\nRAS enzymes on endothelial surfaces and in tissues.\nMethods and materials\nStudy design and participant selection\nThis is a sub-study of the South African study regarding the\nrole of Sex, Age and Ethnicity on Insulin sensitivity and\nCardiovascular function (SAfrEIC) study. This sub-study\ninvolved 23 black (n = 15) and white (n = 8) hypertensive\nmen aged 39.5\u00ad41 years, living in the North West Province\nof South Africa. Exclusion criteria for this study were:\npreviously diagnosed with diabetes (type 1 and 2), heart\ndisease (bypass surgery, myocardial infarction or angina),\nstroke, asthma or any other serious medical conditions or\nuse of any chronic medication. The inclusion criteria were:\napparently healthy men and the hypertensives included\nin this sub-study were newly diagnosed after the study\ncommenced. Newly diagnosed hypertensives who received\nmedications that could interfere with the RAS were\nexcluded in the analysis of this sub-study.\nThe Ethics Committee of the North-West University,\nPotchefstroom campus, approved this study. Before being\nrecruited, all interested participants were fully informed\nabout the objectives and procedures of this study. An inter-\npreter was available to relay the information to individuals\nin their home language. Written informed consent was\nobtained from all individuals who decided to participate.\nOrganizational procedures\nParticipants reported to the Metabolic Unit facility on the\nPotchefstroom campus of the North-West University at\n07:00 a.m. All the participants were introduced to the\nset-up and after the organizational procedures were\nexplained to them, they all signed informed consent forms.\nIndividuals received a participant sheet that guided them\nthrough the different research stations where the various\nmeasurements were performed. During the course of the\nmorning, basic health and demographic questionnaires\nwere completed, a fasting blood sample was taken and\nanthropometric measurements were performed.Afterwards\nblood pressure and pulse wave velocity measurements\nvan Rooyen et al. 3\nwere taken with a Finometer and a Complior device. When\nall questionnaires and cardiovascular measurements were\ncompleted, each participant received a small financial\ncompensation for travel purposes, as well as a breakfast.\nIn the event of an individual being newly identified with\nhypertension or diabetes, individuals were referred to their\nlocal clinic, hospital or physician. Participants received a\nshort report containing their health information.\nBiochemical analysis\nSerum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine\nand gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) were analyzed with\nthe Konelab20iTM auto-analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,\nVantaa, Finland). The serum amino-terminal pro-hormone\nB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels were deter-\nmined with an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay\n(Elecsys 2010, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).\nEquilibrium RAS-Fingerprint analysis:\nQuantification of angiotensin metabolites in\nequilibrated serum\nmin) and stored at -80\u00b0C until shipped for analysis.\nFollowing ex vivo incubation at 37\u00b0C for one hour\n(pH = 7.4), serum was stabilized and subjected to LC-MS/\nMS quantification of equilibrium angiotensin peptide\nlevels (Attoquant Diagnostics, Vienna, Austria). Briefly,\nstable-isotope-labeled internal standards for angiotensin\nadded to the samples at a concentration of 200 pg/ml each.\nFollowing C18-based solid-phase-extraction, participants\nunderwent LC-MS/MS analysis using a reverse-phase ana-\nlytical column (Acquity UPLC\u00ae C18, Waters) operating\nin line with a XEVO TQ-S triple quadrupole mass spec-\ntrometer (Waters) in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)\nmode. Two different mass transitions were measured per\npeptide, and angiotensin concentrations were calculated\nby relating endogenous peptide signals to internal standard\nsignals under consideration of the corresponding response\nfactors determined by sample specific calibration. A signal-\nto-noise ratio of 10 was considered as the quantification\nthreshold for endogenous peptide signals, resulting in indi-\ncated lower levels of quantification.\nEquilibrium RAS analysis, which has been used in this\nstudy, does not require any stabilization during sample col-\nlection, allowing standardized analysis of clinical samples.\nFollowing separation of serum using standard serum tubes,\nsamples were frozen and shipped for analysis. Following\nrapidly thawing of the serum, the peptide cascade was\nallowed to re-establish under controlled pH at 37\u00b0C.\nAngiotensinogen is present in a vast excess, resulting\nin a constant Ang I formation rate that leads to the estab-\nlishment of stable equilibrium levels of downstream\nangiotensin metabolites, which are readily formed as all\nangiotensin metabolizing enzymes are still active in the\nsample and present at huge amounts when compared to\nthe very low concentrations of angiotensins, which are in\nthe picomolar range. After reaching equilibrium, where the\nformation and the degradation rate of each individual pep-\ntide are equal, these levels can be rapidly and effectively\nstabilized and are further subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis\nas described above. The combination of equilibrium analysis\nwith LC-MS/MS analysis is compatible with frozen hepa-\nrin plasma and serum samples and can be used to access the\nbiochemical state of the RAS at the patient-specific level\nwithout pre-analytical or methodological obstacles.\nAnthropometric measurements\nBody height was measured using the Invicta Stadiometer\n(IP 1465, London, UK). Body mass was measured using\na digital scale (Precision Health Scale, A & D Company,\nJapan) in order to calculate the body mass index (BMI).16\nThe Baecke physical activity questionnaire was employed\nto obtain the Total Activity Index of each participant.\nCardiovascular measurements\nPulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured using the\nComplior SP apparatus (Artech Medical, Pantin, France).\nThe following distance was measured on the left side of\neach participant: carotid dorsalis-pedis (from the supraster-\nnal notch to the pedalis artery in the foot) distance. The\nsubtraction method was used--the distance from the\ncarotid artery to suprasternal notch was subtracted from\nthe distal measurement. The PWV was measured while the\nparticipant was in a supine position.\nA five-minute continuous measurement of cardiovascu-\nlar variables using the FinometerTM device (FMS, Finapres\nMeasurement Systems, Amsterdam, Netherlands)17,18 was\ntaken and analyzed with the Beatscope 1.1 software pro-\ngram. This device computed all cardiovascular variables\nand stored the data in computer files. The information was\nfurther integrated to obtain the systolic (SBP) and diastolic\nblood pressure (DBP), arterial Windkessel compliance\n(Cwk) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) of each\nindividual.\nStatistical analysis\nThe data were statistically analyzed by making use of the\nStatistica 13 software (StatSoft Inc, Tulsa, OK, USA).\nData are presented as mean values or median values with\nlower and upper quartiles. Because of the small sample,\nnon-parametric statistics were used. To compare two\nindependent sample groups, the Mann-Whitney U Test\nwas used to determine significance. Probability values of\np < 0.05 were regarded as significant. Spearman rank\norder correlations were also determined.\n4 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nResults\nFrom Table 1 it is evident that the white men were\noverweight compared to their black counterparts (30.1 vs.\nin the Total Activity Index if black and white participants\nare compared.

The GGT was significantly higher\np = 0.023). The creatinine clearance was significantly\nlower in the black men compared to the white men (1.52\nbe higher in the black compared to the white hypertensives\nalthough the differences were not significant.

The main\nfinding of this study is the significant lower Ang I and Ang\nII encountered in the hypertensive black African men com-\npared to their white counterparts. This result is in accord-\nance with the common notion that black individuals are\nmore prone to have low renin hypertension10\u00ad12 accompa-\nnied by a suppressed RAS than white individuals. From the\nresults of this study it is further shown that the black men\nhad stiffer blood vessels (higher c-dPWV) than whites,\nalso reported in the literature;20 lower vascular compliance\nand higher TPR compared to their white counterparts.\nFrom the Sympathetic activity and Ambulatory Blood\nPressure in Africans (SABPA) study it is also evident that\nin low-renin normotensive black participants a higher TPR\nwas reported compared to high-renin participants.21 In\nthe regression model from the mentioned study the TPR\ncontributed to the albumin-creatinine ratio, a marker of\nTable 1.

From the literature it is also evident that\nAfrican Americans exhibit larger systemic vascular resist-\nance compared to white individuals and the peripheral\nresistance may play a larger role in regulation of ambula-\ntory blood pressure.26 This is confirmed in our study at\nleast in hypertensive black men because the TPR is signifi-\ncantly higher in the black men with suppressed renin and\nlow Ang II levels compared to the white men.\nThe findings of this study should be interpreted within\nits strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge\nit is the first study in which equilibrium RAS-Fingerprint\nanalysis was employed for simultaneous biochemical\ncharacterization of the RAS peptides in a black and white\npopulation from South Africa and holds promise to under-\nstand the RAS better in different ethnic groups as well as\nin different pathologic states. The systemic RAS peptides\nand the interaction between components provide new\ntherapeutic targets1,27 for treatment of cardiovascular\ndiseases like hypertension in this population group. Our\nresults proved the compatibility of standard collected\nserum samples with patient-specific biochemical charac-\nterization of endogenous angiotensin metabolism using\nLC-MS/MS. We further support previous studies reporting\nlow-renin hypertension in black African men showing that\nequilibrium Ang I and Ang II peptide levels are signifi-\ncantly lower in the black population.28 The small sample\nsize, which is also reflected by the differences in median\nand mean values for equilibrium angiotensin peptides\n(Table 1, Figure 1), as well as the fact that aldosterone and\nsodium intake and/or excretion were not determined, are\nlimitations of the study. The BMI differences observed in\nthe two study cohorts might appear to be a confounder\nvariable of the study. Functional interactions between the\nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and obesity\nhave been established in previous studies and the local\nRAAS in adipose tissue has been discussed in terms of its\ncontribution to hypertension.29 Importantly, the systemic\nRAAS, represented by plasma-circulating components,\nwere clearly shown not to correlate with BMI,30 proving\nthat the effects observed in our study are not related to\ndifferences in the BMI of investigated cohorts although in\na large study conducted in African Americans published\nrecently,31 it was shown that visceral adiposity is associ-\nated with components of the RAAS in African Americans.\nThe observed differences between circulating RAS\ncomponents, which are reflected via equilibrium angioten-\nsin levels, point to a distinctive molecular regulation of the\nRAAS in the two study cohorts. Despite the low number of\npatients, the differences observed in equilibrium angioten-\nsin levels were highly significant indicating that profound\ndifferences in systemic RAAS biochemistry might be\npresent. This could affect the efficacy of therapeutic\napproaches targeting the RAAS that are currently employed\nto treat hypertension in South Africa.\nThe increased peripheral resistance observed in hyper-\ntensive black individuals might take over a dominant role\nin control of blood pressure in this study population, which\ncould have resulted in an underrepresentation of the circu-\nlating RAAS in the control of blood pressure.\n"
