    "abstract": "Abstract\nTranslating the purposes of education into practice is particularly challenging for those who are new or have recently entered\nacademia. By reflecting on my first years of teaching in higher education, I discuss two key aspects of my teaching practice:\nshifts in choice of teaching methods and a critique of different forms of assessment. Through the discussion, I argue that a\nteacher needs to be reflective on both these aspects and that such reflection needs to be carried out so that the student\ndevelops into a \"self-directing,\" \"self-monitoring,\" and \"self-correcting\" individual. At the end of the discussion, the relevance\nof a \"project-based learning\" approach starts to become significant in taking my pedagogical practice forward.\n",

This would\ntherefore require one not only to position and analyze shifts\nin teaching methods in relation to contemporary debates on\nthe changing nature of \"knowledge\" but also to understand\nhow one might facilitate the development of the student into\na \"self-directing,\" \"self-monitoring,\" and \"self-correcting\"\nindividual through adequate assessment methods (Gregory,\nBased on my experience in the initial years of academic\nteaching, I reflect on how I: (1) positioned and analysed\nshifts in teaching methods in relation to contemporary\ndebates on the changing nature of `knowledge' and how it\ninfluenced `learning processes'; (2) offered a critique of dif-\nferent forms of assessment that I employed. By so doing, I\ndiscuss at the end of this paper, how my initial years of teach-\ning experience has given me insight on the importance of\ndeveloping instructional methods that has parallels with a\n`Project-based learning' approach, where learners are more\nautonomous, take on increased responsibility in their learn-\nable to fit learning around their capabilities (Moursund 1998;\nTeaching Methods\nInitially, I relied on a teacher-centric method, \"lecturing,\"\nwhich focused on teachers as the \"deliverer\" of knowledge\nand the student, the \"recipient.\" To start off the discussion, I\nwill talk about a particular module in the undergraduate\ndegree in the town planning program that was looking at how\ncities were planned across Europe. As this was my first go at\nthis module (and the fact that this was my first year in teach-\ning), I started organizing the contents of the module under\ndifferent lecture headings; for instance, Week 1 would look\nat \"different systems of planning across Europe,\" Week 2 on\nthe \"planning system in the UK,\" and so on. As a result, lec-\nturing or a teacher-centric approach was seen as the \"best\nway\" in the delivery of lectures for the whole module.\nThe perceived advantages of a \"teacher-centric\" approach\nhelped strengthen my case for adopting lecturing as a key\nmethod of teaching. First, within the higher education sector,\n\"teaching\" and \"research\" are the two broad career paths, not\n1University of Dundee, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nDeepak Gopinath, Lecturer, Town and Regional Planning, School of the\nEnvironment, University of Dundee, Ground floor, Tower Building, Perth\nRoad, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland, UK.\nEmail: d.gopinath@dundee.ac.uk\nDiscourses and Practices in Teaching\nMethods and Assessment: Insights From\nan Early Career Academic\nDeepak Gopinath1\n Keywords\neducation, social sciences, academics, curriculum, educational measurement and assessment, higher education, teaching\n2 SAGE Open\n\"learning.\" So when one takes up a \"teaching\" career, there\nis an implicit assumption that he or she is capable to \"teach\"\na group of students who are there to \"learn.\" Such an assump-\ntion in some senses legitimizes a hierarchical relationship,\nwith teachers at the \"top\" and \"students\" at the bottom. As a\nresult, there is a tendency particularly in new lecturing staff\nto adopt a didactic method of teaching where students are\ntold what to learn rather than given an opportunity to learn\nfor themselves. Second, lecturing is a preferred teaching\nmethod because it are considered to be an \"efficient\" medium\nof instruction especially for large classes (Lammers &\nPersonally, I felt that it had the potential to cover substan-\ntial amount of teaching material within a relatively short\nperiod of time allotted per module in an academic calendar.\nAlthough aware that it is an \"efficient\" teaching method, I\nstarted inquiring whether lecturing is really effective. Such\nconcerns have, particularly, emerged because although lec-\nturing can be quite effective in delivering facts or \"informa-\ntion,\" it does not effectively enable a student-centered\nthinking process or bring about a change in the behavior of\nstudents because students are regarded as \"passive listeners\"\nTo find out more on how students perceived my use of\nteacher-centric methods, I used feedback forms to explore\nwhether there were what Ramaprasad (1983) refers to as\ngaps between \"actual outcomes\" and \"desired outcomes\"\n(Poulos & Mahony, 2008). I built on the standard assessment\nform that was used for evaluating my teaching observation\nand handed out feedback forms to my students. I saw this as\n\"an opportunity for learning and for encouraging an orienta-\ntion towards learning goals\" (Knight & Yorke, 2003; Poulos\ngenerally good and included a range of comments, for\ninstance, (a) Some of my students noted that I first gave them\na structure of my presentation before going into detail and\nwhich students felt were useful in following through the\nwhole lecture and (b) others felt that my voice delivery in a\ncalm and composed manner made them felt at ease while\nlistening to the lectures. On the whole, the feedback during\nthe course of the module is a useful way to understand how I\nor the \"teacher\" was delivering lectures. But I knew that\nsomething more needed to be done. I realized that I need to\nshift the focus from \"me\" to the \"students.\" As a result, I\nstarted looking for ways to develop a student-centered\napproach in addition to the standard \"lectures.\" This meant a\nre-examination of the values underpinning both teacher-\ncentered and student-centered teaching methods.\nThe purpose of education underpinned by Enlightenment\nvalues such as \"instrumental rationality\" (that the choice of\nright methods would result in the achievement of desired\noutcomes) and \"universality\" (that the same methods can be\napplied in different contexts) dominated the educational sys-\nthe adoption of teacher-centric methods. But given the nature\nof institutional arrangements required for such training, it\nhas met with the criticism of being an elitist project (O'Hagan,\nflawed assumption of the learning process underpinned by\nEnlightenment values such as \"instrumental rationality,\" that\nif the method is right then any teacher can achieve the desired\nends. Although the focus is on the choice of the \"right\" edu-\ncation methods and because the teacher is the only person\nwho can \"rightly\" use such methods in pursuing \"desirable\"\noutcomes, this system of education again points to a teacher-\ncentric approach. This would mean that irrespective of who\nthe teacher is and what the mix of students might be, if the\n\"right\" methods were followed, then desired objectives\nwould be achieved.\nHowever, there is (and has always been) an alternative\ntradition, a student-centric approach to learning. For\nonly by questioning what he or she sees or hears because\nhuman nature is neutral at birth. Although the teacher is\ninvolved in the learning process by interacting with a num-\nber of students, his or her role is one of being \"in authority\"\nrather than being \"an authority\". The teacher is merely there\nto lead students to discover what they want to know for\nthemselves.As a result, student-centric methods (that started\nto gain popularity particularly since the 1960s) do not\nassume that the learning process is \"linear\" where the\nteacher is seen as someone who can deliver quantifiable\n\"ends\" after the period of the learning experience. On the\ncontrary, education is regarded in the student-centric\napproach as a process of developing \"reflective\" learners\nwho continue to learn well after the formal teaching period\nHaving developed an understanding of the advantages of\na student-centric approach, I ended up trying two things in\nthe remainder of the module. First, I divided my lecture time\ninto two parts: The first hour was devoted to the delivery of\nlecture material, and following a 10-min break, I provided\nreading materials (mostly journal articles and/or pages from\nreports) to my students. It was made clear at the start of the\nsecond hour that students had to critically evaluate the read-\ning material within a time period of about 20 min and be\nable to summarize what they found interesting and why, and\nhow that understanding related to what was taught until\nnow.\nThere were mixed reactions to this experiment as this has\nnot been included into lecture sessions before. From my side,\nI tried as far as possible to fit the role of a facilitator (who\nwould jot down the key points on the blackboard) in a discus-\nsion rather than as a lecturer. Now I also anticipated that if I\nwould merely invite answers from the whole group of stu-\ndents, then only a few would participate and the rest would\nremain as passive listeners. So, I organized the class into four\nto five groups with each group containing three to four stu-\ndents. And I also prepared three to four different materials\nfor the reading sessions. As a result, each group had a copy\nof all the materials while each student in that group had a\ndifferent reading material.\nGopinath 3\nAfter the allotted reading time of 20 to 30 min, I drew a\ntable on the blackboard with as many columns as the number\nof groups and as many rows as the number of reading materi-\nals. I then invited discussion on each reading material that I\nhad circulated from each group (in no specific order). The\ninteresting lesson was that once the \"active\" students got\ninvolved in the discussion, the passive students possibly\nobserving the empty boxes on the table in the blackboard\nslowly started to get involved, sometimes agreeing with their\ncolleagues and, in other instances, offering alternative view-\npoints. This was a very useful exercise, and it amazed me\nhow much my students can get involved in a discussion, par-\nticularly those who were rather quiet during my lectures.\nHowever, the students were still \"passive\" in the sense that\nthey were seated and responded to the tasks within a short\ntime frame.\nBuilding on this exercise, I wondered whether I could get\nthem to talk about specific teaching content to the student\naudience as a whole, rather than me delivering the content. In\naddition to giving the students a week's preparation time, I\nprovided them with new material including land-use-related\nmaps from countries across Europe and asked them to deliver\na presentation on how town planning is carried out across\nEurope--with each group talking about particular contexts\nwith reference to both text-based as well as map-based infor-\nmation they had gathered. This was a very useful exercise in\nthat students assumed a sense of \"responsibility\" of the\nteaching content that was provided to them. I guess this was\npossible because I had asked them to assume the role of\n\"planning officers\" from different countries across Europe\nand who had to teach colleagues from elsewhere as to what\ntown planning is all about from where they come from.\nThe above examples demonstrate that I started to appreci-\nate a more student-centric approach rather than rely on a\nteacher-centric position. The adoption of a more student-\ncentric approach also signals a re-examination of the pur-\nposes of education. One of the paradigms with regard to the\npurposes of education is of the teacher as an \"expert\" and as\nsomeone who conveys \"truths\" and engages in a process of\ndelivering \"answers\" to ignorant students. The knowledge\ngained in such a process is what Plato refers to as a priori--all\nknowledge is already known and that new knowledge cannot\nbe acquired (Cooper, 2001). As a result, the methods used in\nthe learning process are \"teacher-centric.\" The other para-\ndigm with regard to the purposes of education is on the \"co-\ncreation of knowledge\" (Gregory, 2002) where both teachers\nand students are engaged in the process of constructing and\ninterpreting what they learn. It is within this paradigm under-\npinning a student-centric approach that I have started to move\ninto. In this student-centric approach, the purpose of educa-\ntion is to facilitate the development of the student into a \"self-\ndirecting,\"\"self-monitoring,\"and\"self-correcting\"individual\nTo conclude, I have now started to see shifts in my teach-\ning methods, which has been possible because I focused on\nreflecting on my teaching experience. The importance of\nreflection in teaching and learning has been captured in many\nscholarly works over the last three decades (Schon, 1983,\nthe teacher needs to recapitulate if the adopted teaching\nmethods were what he or she would have preferred if put in\nthe same learning situation (O'Reilly, 1999). I hope to build\non this \"reflective\" nature in my teaching philosophy to help\nme evaluate the effectiveness of my teaching methods in the\nfuture.\nAssessment Techniques\nIn the following section, I develop a critique of different\nforms of assessment by evaluating \"what is being examined\n(the content)\" and \"why,\" and how it relates to curriculum\nquality. This evaluation draws on a critique of assessment\nmethods from the literature and how it links to my experi-\nence of having used different forms of assessment. Thus, the\noverall question, \"How do I now see the scope and relevance\nof various forms of assessment in a range of teaching con-\ntexts?\" Rather than making a claim that one form of assess-\nment is better than the other, I have come to realize the range\nof advantages and disadvantages in different forms of assess-\nment. And it is the development of this understanding that I\nwill be discussing in the rest of the writing.\nWhen I started my job as lecturer in 2009, I gradually\nbegan to recognize that assessment is an important aspect of\neducation that affects teachers, students, and the institutional\nframeworks that offer and/or regulate the delivery and qual-\nity of education. For teachers, it offers a way of reflecting on\nthe choice and quality of their teaching styles and methods;\nfor students, assessment reflects an important yardstick of\nacademic achievement, and the pursuit of rigorous assess-\nment procedures legitimizes the qualifications awarded by\neducational institutions (Merricks, 2002). Although being\naware of these functions served by assessment methods in\ngeneral, I was also conscious of some of the challenges of\nhow students' works were examined. For instance, when\nteachers carry out an assessment of student learning, there is\nin some sense an element of subjectivity within the teachers'\njudgment--of how he or she chooses to assess a student's\nwork and why. Because subjectivity can impact the student\neither positively (motivate) or negatively (de-motivate), it is\nvital that \"assessment processes are valid, reliable and fair\"\nWith some of these challenges in mind, I was faced with\nthe task of marking coursework submissions or what can also\nbe referred to as carrying out a summative assessment.As the\nword suggests, \"summative\" assessment is carried out at the\nend of a course/module delivery. Grades, marks, and/or awards\nare the usual outputs of this assessment and are made in\nresponse to works carried out by students such as written\nexams, dissertations, or coursework projects. The key purpose\nof a summative assessment is to measure student achievement\n4 SAGE Open\nat the end of the teaching period (Merricks, 2002). This form\nof assessment is seen as a recognized and accepted measure\nof a student's ability and plays a decisive role in his or her\nprogression toward a higher degree or suitability for a par-\nticular job. For instance, in one of the first undergraduate\nmodules that I had marked, the submission requirements\nwere made available to students at the start of the module. In\naddition, the teaching outcomes of this module were also\nmade known to students at the start of the module. For exam-\nple, at the end of the course, students will be able to both\nobjectively describe (by using standard terms such as scale,\nfunction) as well as subjectively evaluate (by taking into\nconsideration the needs of communities/users) the built\nspaces we live in. However, as Ramsden (1992) rightly\npoints out, the focus for teachers is on pursuing the teaching\noutcomes, while for students, the assessment shapes the\nlearning outcome. This is something I did not give much\nthought at the time especially, in what Biggs (2003) notes, as\nto \"how students think they will be assessed\" (p. 140).\nAnother challenge in carrying out summative assessment\nis to understand the basis for assessment--norm-referenced\nor criterion-referenced. Norm-referenced assessment refers\nto comparison of students with each other and arranging\nthem in a ranking order. It is a measure of performance in\nrelation to others. Cohen, Manion, and Morrison (2004)\nexplain it as follows:\nfor example a commercially produced intelligence test or a\nnational test of reading ability that has been standardised so that,\nfor instance, we can understand a score of 100 is of a notational\n\"average\" student and that a score of 120 describes a student\nwho is notionally above average. (p. 328)\nA norm-referenced assessment is hence a qualifying or a\nselection tool and not a measure of how a student has per-\nformed. Criterion-referenced assessments on the contrary\nmeasure a student's performance against a set of pre-\ndetermined criteria. It does not compare a student's perfor-\nmance to other students but measures whether the prescribed out-\ncomes of a course have been achieved. I have enjoyed developing\nsuch pre-determined criteria and letting students know early on,\nand this has helped me in the marking of various coursework.\nThis, I think, is important because learning outcomes vary by\nmodule and so does the coursework requirements.\nA second type of assessment that I use in my teaching is\nformative assessment. This type of assessment is used by\nteachers to convey to students the \"urgent actions\" that need\nto be taken (Haines, 2004) so that relevant student skills are\nformed at the right period in the learning process. Some of\nthese \"urgent actions\" include, for instance, (a) reminding the\nstudent of the need to correctly list the sources of information\nwhen writing reports and (b) the need to develop a habit of\nwide-reading, over and above the list of books recommended\nby the tutor. For instance, as part of another module that I\nteach, my students were due to leave for fieldwork to Europe\nas part of their coursework, and a senior colleague of mine\nwho was involved in this module felt that the current group\nof students were quieter than usual and as a result was con-\ncerned whether they would make the best use of the trip by\nactively engaging with policy officials and other important\npeople. As a result, I realized that two \"urgent actions\"\nneeded to be taken: (a) First, to ensure that students were\nmore familiar with policy documents within the European\ncontext and (b) second, to remind them of the need to get into\nthe habit of asking questions as well as in striking conversa-\ntions with policy officials.\nKey policy documents were identified and individual\nchapters handed out to students in advance of the formative\nassessment. It was made clear that the assessment would not\ncount toward the final coursework and that each student had\nto explain to the whole class the topic they had been assigned\nto. During that process, I evaluated the strengths and weak-\nnesses of each individual student who made the presentation\nas well as of those who were raising questions. It was really\ninteresting to see how many students who were rather shy in\nthe usual sessions came out confidently to talk about their\nrespective topics. Since this was the first time I had used for-\nmative assessment, at the end of the session, rather than point\nout individual strengths and weaknesses, I summarized the\nkey action points. I also told them that their individual assess-\nments will be filed and will be discussed at a later formative\nassessment on an individual basis.\nNow, I have started to realize that different forms of\nassessment including summative and formative have their\nown strengths and weaknesses, and one is not intended to\nreplace the other. For instance, there are advantages in using\nsummative assessments in that it leads to an award or a cer-\ntificate and is accepted and essential for progression to fur-\nther study or a job. However, summative assessments have\ncertain weaknesses as well, for instance, that it lacks flexibil-\nity in meeting the needs of diverse learners and learning\nroutes. However, formative assessments have certain advan-\ntages: It focuses on skill development rather than attainment/\nknowledge of subject matter and allows for adapting teach-\ning to the needs of the student. Having said that, formative\nassessments have a few disadvantages, for instance, that it\nhas a degree of subjectivity involved and therefore can lead\nto bias.\nThus, one can argue that choice of assessment methods is\nan important component of our teaching strategy because\n\"what we choose to assess and how shows quite starkly what\ndefines pass and fail, identifies an individual's strengths and\nhighlights weaknesses, measures achievements and progress,\nand if undertaken correctly, facilitates further learning. In\naddition to choice of assessment methods, there is also a need\nto appreciate the varied purposes of assessment, that is, \"to\ndiscriminate between students\" at the degree level, on one\nhand, and \"to establish competence at autonomous research\nstudy\" at the doctoral level, on the other hand (Haines, 2004,\nGopinath 5\np. 9). In many ways, such an inquiry falls within my passion\nof being an \"effective\" teacher, and in the three areas,\nBernstein (1975) divides the education environment into cur-\nriculum (epistemological considerations), pedagogy (tech-\nniques used by teachers to achieve teaching objectives), and\nevaluation (setting out the standards for assessment).\nConclusion\nThis paper by contributing to existing literature on `student\ncentred' pedagogy in general, discussed some of the interest-\ning challenges when engaging with two key aspects of edu-\ncation: teaching methods and choice of assessment. At one\nlevel, key lessons were learned with regards to teaching\nmethods and assessment. Firstly, I now understand the\nadvantages of a student-centric approach over a teacher-\ncentric approach and thus am working towards more of the\nformer and less of the latter in my teaching. For instance, in\none of my undergraduate modules on property development\nthat I have modified recently, there are three parts, two of\nwhich are student-centric (student-led seminars, and interac-\ntive, discussion of ideas in studio) and one is teacher-centric\n(lectures). Secondly, I have realised the importance of more\nformative assessments in the overall assessment mix. For\ninstance, in another of my undergraduate modules on urban\ndesign, rather than having one, final summative assessment\n(as was done previously), there are now two formative\nassessments through the teaching period as well as a final\nsummative assessment.\nHaving said that, two challenges further remain. For\ninstance, I still do not fully understand how/whether aca-\ndemic success of students increased with shifts in the learn-\ning environment that occurred in my initial years of teaching\nalthough I have started to appreciate certain key characteris-\ntics of the learning process for instance, that students need to\nbe active learners and that they should be able to tailor the\nlearning experience around their strengths. This is where I\nthink drawing on the Project-based learning approach will be\nhelpful to take my pedagogical practice forward. Project-\nbased learning is an instructional method where learners by\nbeing more autonomous set out to solve real problems (Boud\nand Oktay 2011) in collaboration with others by collecting\nand sharing data/information (Duch, Groh and Allen 2001;\nDuch 2007). Assessment techniques using a PBL approach\nand in particular to understand the nature of academic suc-\ncess of students in using the approach is something I would\nlike to explore. For instance, Nowak and Plucker (1999) talk\nof setting out different scenarios (based on a number of\nincomplete, unstructured real life problems) for students to\nwork on. And then, how students respond to these scenarios\ncould be captured by what Morsund (2005) refers to as dif-\nferent levels of achievement such as `emergent', `limited',\n`developing', `capable', `strong' and `exceptional'. Such\ntypologies of levels will be helpful to capture patterns of aca-\ndemic success and can be used in shaping the learning out-\ncomes of curriculum units.\nFinally, at the end of my initial years of teaching, I am not\nentirely clear how to engage with the notion of knowledge\nthat a teacher could use in the learning process. For instance,\nBates (2005) talks of the importance of contextualizing\nknowledge, the need to \"directly\" engage in understanding\nand negotiating difference rather than rely on \"empathy\" or\n\"tolerance,\" and while evaluating student performance on\nthe basis of \"established\" or \"truths,\" to be critical as to\nwhose interests, particular knowledge forms serve. Also,\nothers such as O'Reilly (1999) argue that an effective teacher\nis one who can describe multiple dimensions of knowledge.\nFor instance, in describing a city, a teacher presents popula-\ntion data to talk about a city, uses photographs to communi-\ncate what city life might look like, or, further, takes students\nto various parts of a city so that they experience city life first-\nhand. And further, there is also discussion on how knowl-\nedge by analogy or comparison (Tuske 2008) can be used to\nbe an effective teacher, for instance by turning up on time for\nthe lectures and/or by being honest when things have not\ngone as planned. Again here, the Project-based learning\napproach provides a useful insight that knowledge is for the\nstudents to generate and that role of the teacher is merely that\nof a facilitator or a `metacognitive coach' (Gallagher and\nAs I now tread the next leg of my academic career, I\nwould like to develop further my understanding of `Project\nbased learning' and explore how it might be implemented in\nmy pedagogical practice.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBates, R.
