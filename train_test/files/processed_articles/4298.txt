Treatment for BS has\nevolved, with the development of less inva-\nsive techniques including endoscopic\nretrograde cholangiopancreatography and\ntranshepatic percutaneous drainage.6\u00ad8 Use\nof the transhepatic percutaneous approach\nis inconvenient for patients, requiring them\nto maintain percutaneous drainage tubes for\nseveral months.9 Endoscopic retrograde\ncholangiography (ERC) is considered diag-\nnostic for BS after LT, with therapeutic\nendoscopy and radiological techniques\nreplacing surgery in the majority of cases\nas first line therapy, with high success\nstandard endoscopic classification for BS\nafter LT.\nThe purpose of the present study was to\ndevelop a classification system for BS on the\nbasis of endoscopic pictures after LT, and to\nuse this system to establish an appropriate\nmanagement strategy for patients. The pro-\nposed classification system is named the\nLing classification because Ling is short for\nLinghu, the family name of the correspond-\ning author.\nPatients and methods\nThis retrospective study analysed the endo-\nscopic examinations of patients with jaun-\ndice who had undergone cadaveric or living\ndonor liver transplantation at the\nDepartment of Gastroenterology, People's\nLiberation Army General Hospital, Beijing,\n2011. Two endoscopists (E-Q.L. and Z.Q.)\nindependently recorded the characteristics\nof intrahepatic biliary and anastomotic\nstricture, and classified patients into four\ngroups according to their findings: type A,\nnormal biliary structure; type B, anasto-\nmotic stricture and normal intrahepatic bil-\niary structure; type C, narrow and stiff\nintrahepatic biliary structure or beaded\nintrahepatic biliary structure or intrahepatic\nbiliary cast without anastomotic stricture;\ntype D, narrow and stiff intrahepatic biliary\nstructure or beaded intrahepatic biliary\nstructure or intrahepatic biliary cast with\nanastomotic stricture.\nResults\nIn total, there were 93 patients (76 men and\n17 women) for whom clear pictures of ERC\nliving donor liver transplantation; 78\n(83.9%) had received cadaver organs. The\nmedian age of patients was 54 years (range,\nThe proportion of each Ling subtype in\nthe included cases is shown in Table 1;\ntypical images obtained for each subtype\nare shown in Figures 1\u00ad5.\nOf the nine patients classified as Ling A,\ntwo had repeated episodes of jaundice with\nnormal ERC results. Their symptoms were\nalleviated with endoscopic nosalbiliary\ndrainage. The remaining seven patients\nwere treated medically with ursodeoxycholic\nacid capsules 250 mg, orally, twice daily for\n1 month. The 44 patients classified as Ling B\nwere treated with balloon dilatation, stent\ndrainage, external drainage of the bile duct\nor transhepatic percutaneous drainage. In\n40 patients classified as Ling B, endoscopic\ntreatment was successful. One patient from\nthis group developed a severe infection\npostoperatively and died of multiple organ\nfailure; a further three patients with repeated\nsevere jaundice were treated either surgically\nto repair the stricture or with biliary\u00adenteric\nanastomosis, and these measures relieved\nthe symptoms. There were 22 patients clas-\nsified as Ling C, all of whom were treated\nwith endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage\n(ERBD) and cleaning with `bolt-shaped'\nmaterial. Eighteen patients were treated\nsuccessfully, two patients died of multiple\norgan failure and two patients required a\nsecond liver transplant, after which their\nsymptoms were alleviated. Of the 18 patients\nclassified as Ling D, all were treated\nwith ERBD and cleaning with `bolt-\nshaped' material. This procedure success-\nfully mitigated symptoms in 13 patients; one\npatient had lung metastases and died of\nrespiratory failure, two patients were\ntreated with biliary\u00adenteric anastomosis\nand two patients required a second liver\ntransplant.\nTable 1.

In our experi-\nence, patients with type A BS will have\nsymptomatic remission treated with drain-\nage and medical therapy: their jaundice may\nbe caused by a graft rejection reaction.\nConversely, patients with type A BS were\nalmost all treated by endoscopic transpapil-\nlary cholangiography or transhepatic percu-\ntaneous cholangiography, including balloon\ndilatation and stent drainage. No patients in\nthe present study displayed a type B stricture\nand retained normal liver function. For\npatients with type C or D BS, endoscopy\ntreatment was initially most useful,l but\nsurgical repair and retransplantation were\nnecessary for those who needed further\nendoscopic treatments or who failed endo-\nscopic treatment. Although type C and D BS\nunderwent the same treatment strategies,\nthey were separated into two classifications\nbecause of anatomical differences in their\nappearance.\nThe authors acknowledge there were a\nnumber of limitations to the present study,\nsuch as the small sample size and the lack of\nlong-term follow-up. Thus, further pro-\nspective studies are needed, to determine\nthe validity of the proposed Ling classifica-\ntion system for selecting candidates for\nappropriate treatment.\nIn conclusion, we hope that the Ling\nclassification might help in determining the\nappropriate treatment strategy for patients\nwith BS after LT. Further prospective\nstudies are needed to determine the useful-\nness of the Ling classification system.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors had no conflicts of interest to declare\nin relation to this article.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
