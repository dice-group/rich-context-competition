Though reflections about\ncognitive aging are expected to grow more pessimistic with\nthe passage of chronological time, people's life courses\nelapse in ways besides objective days, months, calendar,\nand years. Therefore, age identity may be a more telling\nindicator of dispositions toward cognitive aging than is\nchronological age per se. Subjective evaluations of age are\nan important aspect of the self with implications for well-\nbeing (Westerhof & Barrett, 2005). Using a national longi-\ntudinal sample of adults aged 55\u00ad74 years at baseline, this\narticle considers how age identity is associated with dispo-\nsitions toward cognitive aging and how the relationship dif-\nfers by gender.\nSocial psychologists in sociology see identities as \"sets\nof meanings people hold for themselves that define `what it\nmeans' to be who they are\" (Burke, 2004, p. 5). Culture\ngives definition and meaning to positions within society,\nand people place these labels and expectations on them-\nselves and on others. Of the various cultural categories from\nwhich people derive their identities, age is unique in that it\nis far more permeable than categories like race or gender,\nand because all people invariably increase in age over time,\nage identity bridges both developmental and cultural as-\nThe age-based identities generated within a social con-\ntext powerfully shape people's well-being. In modern cul-\ntures, youthfulness is a prized status, and accordingly,\nageism and negative stereotypes of aging abound in the\nUnited States (Palmore, 2003). Eschewing \"oldness\" and\npreserving a youthful identity are therefore compensatory\nstrategies people use to counteract the negative cultural\nmessages associated with aging and the realization of being\npast their own desired chronological age (Heckhausen &\nSchulz, 1998). Generally speaking, people use positive self-\nillusions as a strategy to maximize happiness and social en-\ngagement (Taylor & Brown, 1988). The consistent finding\nthat people most identify with their \"younger selves\"\nexample of self-enhancing illusions at the basis of the self-\nConsistent with these basic social psychological prem-\nises, a number of recent studies show the beneficial effects\nof young age identities. These include qualitative benefits\nsuch as efficacy in coping with medical illnesses (Boehmer,\n2007) and general life satisfaction (Westerhof & Barrett,\n2005), as well as more concrete advantages such as reduced\nrisk of disability and hypertension (Demakakos, Gjonca, &\nNazroo, 2007) and mortality (Uotinen, Rantanen, &\nSuutama, 2005). Despite a few exceptions (Boehmer;\nhas used cross-sectional data to examine the antecedents of\nage identity, identifying health status and occupancy of key\nsocial roles in the life course as its chief predictors (e.g.,\nMutran & George, 1982). This article seeks to explore\nAge Identity, Gender, and Perceptions of Decline: Does\nFeeling Older Lead to Pessimistic Dispositions About\nCognitive Aging?\nMarkus H. Schafer and Tetyana P. Shippee\nCenter on Aging and the Life Course, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana.\nObjectives. Drawing on past studies of age identity, this article examined whether feeling older was associated with\nmore pessimistic views about cognitive aging.\nMethods. Using respondents aged 55 years and older in the Midlife Development in the United States study, we esti-\nmated a series of linear regression models to predict people's dispositions toward their cognitive aging. The main com-\nparison is whether the effects of age identity on cognitive aging differ for men and women.\nResults. Beyond the effects of chronological age, older age identities were associated with more pessimistic disposi-\ntions about cognitive aging. This relationship, however, was found only among women.\nDiscussion. Age identity shapes cognitive aging dispositions, though the gendered nature of this relationship remains\nsomewhat unclear. The findings give further evidence about the far-reaching implications of age identity for successful\naging and suggest that future work can explicate how subjective aging processes may differ by gender.\nKey Words: Age identity--Cognitive aging--Cognitive decline--Gender--Subjective age.\nadditional implications of age identity for successful aging\nby using longitudinal data and focusing on how subjective\nage influences cognitive aging dispositions (hereafter CAD).\nWe expect not only that age identity is related to aspects of\nphysical well-being (Barrett, 2003; Demakakos et al.; Uotinen\net al., 2005) but that older subjective age is associated with\nmore pessimistic perspectives on cognitive functioning, net\nof the effect of chronological age.\nCognitive aging is a key component of successful aging,\nwith strong implications for quality of life and maintaining\nindependence in older age (Seeman, Lusignolo, Albert, &\nBerkman, 2001). Exploring CAD thus extends previous re-\nsearch, which has emphasized the physical health correlates\nof age identity but has given little attention to the mind. In\naddressing this limitation of past research, we draw on scale\ninstruments developed by psychologists of aging (Lachman,\nBaltes, Nesselroade, & Willis, 1982; Lachman, Bandura,\nWeaver, & Elliott, 1992) that are useful for identifying the\nself-regulatory attitudes that influence cognitive perfor-\nmance (West & Yassuda, 2004). This research tradition has\nbeen instrumental in identifying why older adults fare worse\non cognitive tasks; in addition to explanations based on\nbrain and sensory changes (Baltes & Lindenberger, 1997),\npart of the effect owes to the lower levels of perceived con-\ntrol over their cognitive abilities and negative internalized\nattributions for memory performance (Devolder & Pressley,\narea of CAD have been interested primarily in the personal-\nity attributes associated with these attitudes, such as anxiety or\nachievement orientation (e.g., Lachman et al., 1982) and--\nmore recently--in identifying the mechanisms linking\ncognitive expectations to performance (e.g., better use of\nrecall-enhancing learning strategies [Lachman, Andreoletti,\n& Pearman, 2006] and level of confidence in information\nretrieval [Touron & Hertzog, 2004]). Our core concern here,\nhowever, is with age identity and how it relates to CAD.\nWhich matters more for people's outlook on cognitive ag-\ning--an objective count of chronological years or their own\nevaluations of their age?\nIn pursuing this inquiry, we draw specific attention to\ngender differences. Identities are located at the intersection\nof a multiplicity of traits--race, gender, age, and so on\n(Howard, 2000), and as an aspect of the self, age percep-\ntions differ in important ways between men and women.\nBarrett (2005) shows that women tend to be subjectively\nolder than men because of their worse health and limited\ncontrol over their personal relationships. Women are also\nespecially prone to ageist stereotypes (Hurd, 1999) and are\nfrequently evaluated on traits associated with youthfulness\nsuch as physical beauty and sexual appeal (Barrett, 2005).\nThe importance of gender is further underscored by studies\non aging self-perceptions. Lynch (2000), for instance, devel-\noped a construct of age anxiety including six concerns--\nhealth,fearofthefuture,anduneaseoverlossofindependence,\namong other things. Overall, women were higher in age\nanxiety, though the effect was more marked among younger\nadults. Relating to cognitive aging, past research also docu-\nments that women tend to be less confident about their own\ncognitive abilities (West,Welch, & Knabb, 2002)and that older\nwomen, but not older men, are stereotyped as passive and cog-\nnitively incompetent (Canetto, Kaminski, & Felicio, 1995).\nTaken together, research on age identity and cognitive ag-\ning perceptions suggests that the salience of internalized\nage-based concerns and age-related social evaluations are\nshaped by gender. Based on the findings discussed earlier,\nthis suggests that the association between age and threats to\nwell-being (e.g., declining health, cognitive incompetence)\nis most pronounced among women. Essentially, this con-\nceptualization predicts an interactive association; we there-\nfore expect age identity's most negative effects on CAD to\nbe observed among women.\nBringing together the concepts of age identity, CAD, and\ngender is valuable because age-based expectations are im-\nportant in adult development. This has been ably docu-\nthat positive self-perceptions about growing older improve\nhealth and increase longevity. Insights from social psychol-\nogy such as the self-fulfilling prophecy posit that people's\nexpectation for their futures matter; whether one is fatalistic\nor optimistic about one's future cognitive status likely shapes\none's course of development. Indeed, negative dispositions\nabout memory abilities compromise memory performance,\nparticularly among older adults (West & Yassuda, 2004).\nData and Methods\nSample\nData are drawn from two waves of phone- and self-\nadministered questionnaire data from the National Survey\nof Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS). Ini-\nframe of all English-speaking noninstitutionalized adults\nrate for Wave 1 (W1) was 61%, producing a total sample of\nto secure their participation for Wave 2 (W2). Of the com-\nThis rate differed, however, by key attributes: Only 58% of\nBlack respondents were followed up versus 70% of non-\nBlack persons, about 71% of women remained in the study\ncompared with 68% of men, and participants who were re-\ntained had scored 1 unit higher on education. This study\nfocuses only on adults 55\u00ad74 years of age at W1, who had\nsimilar retention rates to the overall sample. Sixty-four\ncases with item-missing data from baseline or follow-up\nwere dropped from the analyses, leaving a final study sam-\nple of 496 respondents. Poststratification weights were used\nin all multivariate analyses.\nCognitive Aging Dispositions\nDispositions toward cognitive aging were assessed with a\nsix-item scale reflecting individuals'attitudes about changes\nin their ability to perform various cognitive tasks as they age\n(a = .78). The items were taken from larger subscales of the\nPersonality in IntellectualAging Context instrument (Lachman\net al., 1982) and the Memory Controllability Inventory\n(Lachman et al., 1992). They include: \"It's inevitable that\nmy intellectual functioning will decline as I get older\"; \"The\nolder I get, the harder it is to think clearly\"; \"My mental\nacuity (sharpness) is bound to decline\"; \"I don't remember\nthings as well as I used to\"; \"There's not much I can do to\nkeep my memory from going down hill\"; and \"I can under-\nstand instructions only after someone explains them to me.\"\nHigh scores correspond with more optimistic dispositions\ntoward cognitive aging. We selected these six questions out\nof a total of nine cognitive aging items in the MIDUS sur-\nvey after conducting an iterated principal factor analysis\nand identifying a one-factor solution. Reliability was also\nhighest when using this particular six-item configuration.\nAge Identity\nAge identity was measured by subtracting chronological\nage from the response to the following question: \"Many\npeople feel older or younger than they actually are. What\nWesterhof & Barrett, 2005). This results in negative values\nreflecting younger subjective ages and positive values re-\nflecting older subjective age relative to chronological age.\nAdditional Variables\nOur analyses control for a host of variables known to\nshape age identity, such as health status, familial role posi-\ntions, and participation in the work force, along with demo-\ngraphic covariates. Variables included age, race (1 = Black;\n0 = other), sex (1 = female; 0 = male), education (years of\neducation, ranging from 1 to 12), and one's occupational\nstanding (1 = has worked or is working in a white-collar\noccupation; 0 = has not worked in a white-collar occupa-\ntion). We accounted for employment status (1 = working; 0\n= unemployed), marital status (1 = married; 0 = otherwise),\nand parental status (1 = has children; 0 = does not have\nchildren). We also controlled for health indicators: physical\nhealth (self-rated, ranging from 1 to 5), disability (a nine-\nitem scale, a = .87), and negative affect (six-item scale, a =\n.82). We included a general indicator of perceived control as\nit is associated with maintenance of cognitive abilities\n(Verhaeghen, Geraerts, & Marcoen, 2000). Perceived control\nis based on a 12-item scale assessing the amount of control\nrespondents had in their life, such as \"In general I feel I am\nin charge of the situations in which I live.\" The scale had an\nintra-item reliability of .84 and was moderately correlated\nwith the CAD measure (r = .38; as well as with age [r =\n-.16] and age identity [r = -.18]). Finally, we incorporated\na sum of cognitively engaging activities measuring the\ncount of activities respondents participated in at least sev-\neral times a month. These include word games, lectures or\ncourses, and writing (e.g., letters, journals) or computer\nuse.\nAnalytic Strategy\nThe research plan is relatively straightforward. After pre-\nsenting descriptive statistics of our overall study sample, as\nwell as the differences between men and women, we esti-\nmate linear regression equations separately for men and\nwomen. A t test is used to test differences in slopes across\nthe two subsamples. The key comparison is whether the ef-\nfect of age identity on CAD differs between men and\nwomen.\nResults\nTable 1 presents means and standard deviations for the\nvariables used in the analysis. Overall, respondents reported\nage identities that were younger than their chronological age,\nwith women feeling relatively younger than men (-12.5 com-\npared with -11.5), although this difference was not signifi-\ncant. In general, men and women had similar expectations\nabout CAD. Though not displayed in a table, there was a\nmodest level of correlation between CAD and key indepen-\ndent variables (r = -.20 with age identity; r = -.15 with age).\nIn Table 2, we present linear regression models examin-\ning the effects of age identity on CAD for men and women,\nreporting both unstandardized and standardized coefficients.\nResults show that among women, age identity was a strong\npredictor of CAD, as a 1-unit increase in subjective age was\nassociated with a .15 CAD decrease. Comparing standard-\nized units, the beta coefficient for age identity was actually\nslightly larger than that of age in its objective measurement\n(.18 compared with .15). Older women and those with nega-\ntive affect were more pessimistic toward cognitive aging,\nbut those with more education and greater sense of control\ntended to be more optimistic about cognitive aging.\nInterestingly, we did not observe a statistically significant\nrelationship between age identity and CAD among men.\nSimilarly, chronological age did not predict CAD. However,\na t test of the slopes failed to reveal a statistically significant\ndifference for age identity between men and women. Other\npredictors of cognitive aging remained similar to those for\nwomen, with two exceptions: Among men, those in better\nhealth were more negative about their cognitive aging (slope\nwas significantly different than that for women, p < .05),\nand education was not a significant predictor of CAD.\nDiscussion\nThis article found that age identity has a strong influence\non CAD above and beyond individuals' chronological age,\neducational status, health, demographic factors, sense of\ncontrol, and participation in cognitively engaging activities.\nAge identity is increasingly noted as an important\ncomponent of the self, with key implications for health and\nwell-being (e.g., Demakakos et al., 2007). In short, youthful\nidentities are prized and not easily relinquished (Barrett,\nin addition to its association with physical vigor--is mental\nacuity. Not surprisingly, those with younger age identities\nwere found to be more optimistic about their ability to\nmaintain memory and other aspects of cognitive ability,\nregardless of their objective age.\nThe effect of age identity on CAD, however, is not consis-\ntent across gender lines; the standardized coefficient for age\nidentity was nearly twice as large for women and was non-\nsignificant for male respondents. Nevertheless, testing the\nslope differences failed to reveal statistically significant dif-\nferences between men and women. (Preliminary analyses\n[available upon request] with the full sample [women and\nmen] showed that the effect of age identity on CAD was\nsignificant [b = -.134; p < .05] and essentially the average of\nthe standardized effects of women and men separately.) This\nsuggests that though subjective evaluations of age seem\nmore closely tied to evaluations of mental functioning among\nTable 2.

Greater statistical power would\nenable better tests of subsample differences between men\nand women. (The heterogeneity of error variance between\nmale and female subsamples suggests that there is a rather\nmodest level of statistical power for detecting significant dif-\nferences in age identity in CAD between women and men.)\nIn addition, it is important to note that we did not observe\ndifferences in CAD between men and women at the bivari-\nate level. Likewise, bivariate comparisons failed to reveal an\nage identity difference between genders.\nFuture studies may take up the issue of gender and age\nidentity more broadly. Scholars have rightly emphasized\nthat physical appearance and its presumed age-based dete-\nrioration is a predominant aging concern among women in\nAmerican society (e.g., Barrett, 2005); however, unease\nover mental competence and memory ability may also be\nkey concerns among women as they sense themselves ag-\ning. Indeed, women are more concerned about aging in gen-\neral (Lynch, 2000) and have been found to be less confident\nabout their cognitive abilities in specific (West et al., 2002).\nFuture research can further clarify how age identity and\ngender interact to influence the pressures and uncertainties\nof aging.\nSeveral limitations of this study must be kept in mind.\nFirst, the data did not include measures of individuals' cog-\nnitive abilities (e.g., memory tests or math puzzles), thwart-\ning our ability to examine how age identity affects actual\ncognitive performance in later life. Prior research, however,\nindicates that evaluative expectations have concrete effects\non a person's future (West & Yassuda, 2004). Second, we\nwere limited in our ability to examine racial/ethnic differ-\nences in CAD due to the small number of minorities in the\nMIDUS data. Other research could examine how the rela-\ntionship between age identity and CAD varies by race/eth-\nnicity in addition to gender. Third, CAD was not measured\nat W1. This precludes the ability to include baseline CAD\nas a regressor and thereby measure change in the evalua-\ntions over 10 years. We anticipate that people with older age\nidentities would grow increasingly pessimistic about cogni-\ntive aging over time, though additional measures for the de-\npendent variable are necessary to test this assumption.\nFourth, our measure of age identity is but one among many\npossible ways to operationalize this concept. For instance,\nothers have conceptualized age identity as how one identi-\nfies with a discrete age category, such as \"middle-age\" or\n\"old\" (e.g., Mutran & George, 1982). Though it would have\nbeen desirable to broaden our analysis with the use of ad-\nditional measures, we did not have other options available\nin our data.\nDespite these limitations, our approach made several\ncontributions. First, this article has expanded the literature on\nage identity, exploring domains of life affected by age identity\nother than physical health or general well-being and present-\ning the differences by gender. Cognitive aging dispositions\nare an important aspect of aging because the maintenance of\ncognitive functioning sustains engagement in life activities\nand social relationships. Furthermore, positive expectations\nabout aging confer tangible protective benefits across a va-\nWest & Yassuda, 2004). Our results show that age identity\nstrongly shapes such dispositions, having as much or more\nof an impact than objective age, though this relationship\nwas observed only among women.\nSecond, this article used a longitudinal design, enabling\nus to prospectively examine the effects of age identity.\nThough past research has identified important antecedents\nand consequences of age identity, most prior studies have\nFinally, most life course and aging scholars privilege\nchronological age as a key indicator of developmental\nchange. Though the passage of years since one's birth is one\nway to conceptualize age and aging, there are multiple\nforms of time-based experience. This study illustrates the\nutility of age identity as an important way to capture ex-\npected change in the later life course, suggesting that future\nresearch might fruitfully explore other implications of self-\nconcept among aging individuals.\n"
