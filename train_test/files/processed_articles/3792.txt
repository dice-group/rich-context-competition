HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1), a tran-\nscription factor, plays an important protective role in\npromoting cellular adaptation to hypoxic conditions. It is\nknown that HIF-1a, the regulatable subunit of HIF-1,\nis expressed by astrocytes under severe ischaemia.\nHowever, the effect of HIF-1 on astrocytes following Glu\ntoxicity during ischaemia has not been well studied. We\ninvestigated the role of HIF-1 in protecting ischaemic\nastrocytes against Glu toxicity. Immunostaining with GFAP\n(glial fibrillary acidic protein) confirmed the morphological\nmodification of astrocytes in the presence of 1 mM Glu\nunder normoxia. Interestingly, when the astrocytes were\nexposed to severe hypoxia (0.1% O2\n), the altered cell\nmorphology was ameliorated with up-regulation of HIF-1a.\nTo ascertain HIF-1's protective role, effects of two\nbenzylindazole] and 2Me2 (2-methoxyoestradiol), were\ntested. Both the inhibitors decreased the recovery in\nastrocyte morphology and increased cell death. Given that\nischaemia increases ROS (reactive oxygen species), we examined\nthe role of GSH (reduced glutathione) in the mechanism for\nthis protection. GSH was increased under hypoxia, and this\ncorrelated with an increase in HIF-1a stabilization in the\nastrocytes. Furthermore, inhibition of GSH with BSO\n(L-butathione sulfoximine) decreased HIF-1a expression,\nsuggesting its role in the stabilization of HIF-1a. Overall, our\nresults indicate that the expression of HIF-1a under hypoxia has\na protective effect on astrocytes in maintaining cell morpho-\nlogy and viability in response to Glu toxicity.\n",

This release of the\nneurotransmitter Glu and subsequent calcium influx\nis considered to be the most significant event in the pathogenesis\nof ischaemic brain damage. Astrocytes play an important role in\nmaintaining extracellular Glu that is released from neurons below\ntoxic levels. They do so by clearing up Glu from the synaptic\nregion through excitatory amino acid transporters and converting\nthe Glu into glutamine by glutamine synthetase. Glutamine is\nthen shuttled back to neurons and is re-used for Glu synthesis\n(Lehmann et al., 2009). Astrocytes are also involved in the\nmetabolic support to neurons and provide them with nutrients\nsuch as lactate to supplement energy requirements. In addition,\nastrocytes appear to be the main source of EPO (erythropoietin)\nand GSH (reduced glutathione) in the CNS (central nervous\nsystem), having a GSH concentration twice as high that in\nneurons (Bolanos et al., 1995). There is significant evidence of\nastrocytes providing GSH and EPO to neighbouring neurons\n1 To whom correspondence should be addressed (email hshi@ku.edu).\nAbbreviations: BSO, L-butathione sulfoximine; CNS, central nervous system; DAPI, 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ENT-1,\nequilibrative nucleoside transporter 1; EPO, erythropoietin; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; Glu, glutamate; GSH, reduced glutathione; HBSS,\nHanks balanced salt solution; HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; HO-1, haem oxygenase 1; HSP, heat-shock protein; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MCB, monochlorobimane;\nMTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide; ROS, reactive oxygen species; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; YC-1, 3-(50-\nhydroxymethyl-20-furyl)-1-benzylindazole; 2Me2, 2-methoxyoestradiol.\nE 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\nagainst various stresses (Gabryel and Malecki, 2006). Previous\nstudies have shown that, in ischaemic infarcts, neurons do not\nsurvive if neighbouring astrocytes are not viable (Takano et al.,\n2009). Therefore it is important to examine how ischaemia\naffects the function and viability of astrocytes.\nUnder ischaemic conditions, HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible\nfactor-1) is expressed to promote cell survival. HIF-1 is a\nheterodimeric protein formed by a continuously expressed\nsubunit HIF-1b and an oxygen-regulated subunit HIF-1a that is\nstabilized under low oxygen levels. Activation of HIF-1 leads to\nthe transcription of various genes that contribute to the\ncellular adaptation to these conditions. Some of the genes that\nplay an important role in the protective effect of HIF-1 are\nthose that are involved in angiogenesis such as VEGF (vascular\nendothelial growth factor), erythropoiesis such as EPO and\ngenes involved in glucose metabolism such as glucose\ntransporters (Siddiq et al., 2007). It has been shown that HIF-\n1 induces high levels of EPO expression in astrocytes (Masuda\net al., 1994), making them the main source of EPO in the CNS.\nThis demonstrates that HIF-1 plays an important role not only\nin neurons but also in astrocytes. In addition, Glu release during\ncerebral ischaemia causes the formation of ROS (reactive\noxygen species) by the disruption of the mitochondrial electron\ntransport chain and the activation of NAPDH oxidases (Brennan\net al., 2009). Activation of HIF-1 has been shown to protect\nastrocytes against oxidative damage (Chu et al., 2010).\nSince astrocytes play an important role in maintaining\nbrain homoeostasis and providing neuroprotection, their\nresponse to Glu toxicity and ischaemic insult requires further\nunderstanding. The main objective of this study was to\ninvestigate the effects of Glu on the viability and morphology\nof astrocytes exposed to hypoxia and the role that HIF-1 plays\nunder these conditions. Our results demonstrate that HIF-1\nhas a protective effect on primary rat cortical astrocytes in\nterms of increasing cell viability and maintaining cell\nmorphology in response to Glu toxicity and severe oxygen\ndeprivation. Furthermore, we show that GSH may contribute\nto this protection by providing optimal conditions for HIF-1\nstabilization.\nPrimary culture of astrocytes\nAll experiments were conducted with the approval of the\nUniversity of Kansas Institutional Animal Care and Use\nCommittee. Cortical tissue were dissected from the\nSprague\u00adDawley rat (Charles River Laboratories) brains at\npostnatal day 0 (P0) to P4. The tissues were washed with\nHBSS (Hanks balanced salt solution) and trypsinized for\n50 min at 37\u00b0C. The tissues were then dissociated using a fire\npolished glass pipette in a dissociation medium (HBSS, 0.1%\nat room temperature (22\u00b0C). The cells were transferred into\nand grown in 25 cm2 flasks with DMEM (Dulbecco's modified\nEagle's medium) and 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum). After 3\u00ad4\nweeks the flasks were shaken to purify the astrocytes by\ndislodging other cell layers. Following purification, astrocytes\nwere plated on coverslips with DMEM and 10% FBS and used\nIn vitro hypoxia model\nHypoxia was induced by incubating the astrocytes in 0.1%\n(balanced with N2\n) in a hypoxia chamber (COY\nLaboratories) for 3 h. To mimic the high levels of Glu release\n0.1 and 1 mM of Glu in serum-free medium (DMEM) at 37\u00b0C for\n3 h. Control experiments were conducted at 21% O2\n.\nDrug treatments\n2Me2 (2-methoxyoestradiol; Cayman Chemical Company)\nwere used for HIF-1a inhibition studies. Prior to hypoxia\nexposure, the astrocytes were incubated with 0.1 mM of the\ninhibitors for 1 h. Preliminary experiments showed that these\nconditions were sufficient for HIF-1a inhibition during severe\nhypoxia, as shown in Figure 3. For GSH depletion, astrocytes\nwere pre-incubated with 5 mM BSO (L-butathione sulfox-\nimine; Sigma\u00adAldrich) for 12 h as described by Noda et al.\n(2001). The BSO was present for an additional 3 h during the\nhypoxia treatment to inhibit the re-synthesis of GSH.\nImmunocytochemistry\nFollowing treatments, astrocytes were washed with PBS and\nfixed with 4% PFA (paraformaldehyde) for 20 min at room\ntemperature. The cells were then permeabilized using 0.3%\nTriton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature and incubated in\ndissolved in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature.

Fluorescence images were then taken\nimmediately, directly from the culture dish. For co-local-\nization studies, the astrocytes were fixed after the MCB\ntreatment and double-stained for GFAP and HIF-1a using the\nimmunocytochemistry procedure described above. The\nintensity of the fluorescent GSH conjugate (GSH\u00adMCB) of\nsingle cells was measured from the images using ImageJ\nsoftware. Readings of whole-cell intensity were taken from\n15 cells from three different culture preparations.\nCytotoxicity assessment\nCell death was assessed by measuring the activity of LDH\n(lactate dehydrogenase) in the culture medium using an\nLDH cytotoxicity assay kit (Cayman) as described by Bonfoco\ndiphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] assay kit (Invitrogen) was\nalso used to assess cell survival and to quantify the Glu-\nmediated cytotoxicity as described by Mosmann (1983).\nImmunoblot analysis\nAstrocytes were lysed in 200 ml of RIPA buffer (Thermo Sci-\nentific) and the protease inhibitor cocktail kit (Thermo\nScientific) and scraped with the aid of a cell lifter (Biologix\nResearch Company). The lysates were centrifuged at 15300 g\nfor 10 min at 4\u00b0C, and the protein concentration of the\nsupernatants was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-\nRad). Proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE and the separated\nproteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-\nRad). After being blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat dried\nskimmed milk powder in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with\nTween), the membrane was incubated with the primary\nanti-mouse; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room\ntemperature. Immunoblots were quantified using ImageJ\nsoftware and HIF-1a levels were normalized to b-actin.\nTexture analysis\nChanges in astrocyte texture were determined using\nCellProfiler cell image analysis software as described previously\nQuantification of texture was done from fluorescence images\nfrom three different culture preparations. Five microscopic\nfields were obtained from each culture dish and readings from\nsix to eight cells were taken for further analysis.\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as means\u00a1S.D. from a minimum of three\nindependent experiments.

Astrocytes are very\nimportant for the clearance of excessive Glu from the\nextracellular space; however, high concentrations of Glu also\naffect astrocytes and can lead to their death under normal\nconditions.

Increased concentrations (0.1 and\n1 mM) caused changes in the structure of the astrocytes\n(Figure 1A). Under control conditions, astrocytes appeared\nfibrous. However, high Glu resulted in a disrupted or diffuse-\nlike structure. To quantify the GFAP-based structural/\nmorphological changes, we conducted texture analysis by\nusing CellProfiler which measures the amount of local\nvariation present (Carpenter et al., 2006).

These data are evidence that\nhypoxia protects astrocytes against Glu toxicity. As the low\nconcentrations of Glu had no effects on astrocyte\nmorphology, the following studies were carried out with\nTo further examine the protective effect of hypoxia on\nastrocyte against Glu, we measured cell death with the LDH\nassay as shown in Figure 1(C). Under normoxia, there was a\nGlu-concentration-dependent decrease trend in astrocyte\nviability. Under severe hypoxia there was a sign of recovery.\nWhen cell viability was determined with the MTT assay, we\nobserved a significant decrease in cell viability when\nastrocytes were exposed to 1 mM Glu under normoxia and\na significant recovery in astrocyte survival under hypoxia. The\ndifference in the cell viability may be due to the sensitivity of\nthe two cytotoxicity assays. The LDH assay requires a more\nsevere insult that causes damage to the cell membrane.\nThe MTT assay on the other hand works by measuring the\nmetabolic activity of the mitochondria. Nevertheless, results\nfrom both assays indicate that hypoxia reduces astrocyte\ndamage caused by Glu.\nHIF-1 protection in astrocytes\nE 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nHIF-1a is highly expressed in astrocytes under\nsevere hypoxia\nNext, we aimed to address the mechanism by which the\nastrocytes recovered from the Glu toxicity during severe\nhypoxia.

HIF-1a was also expressed in the nucleus of\nthe astrocytes following severe hypoxia treatment in the\npresence of Glu. For further confirmation, Western-blot\nanalysis demonstrated a significant increase in HIF-1a protein\nlevels under severe hypoxia, both with and without Glu\ntreatments (Figure 2B). However, with 1 mM Glu under\nsevere hypoxia there was a slight decrease in the HIF-1a\nprotein levels. This could be due to increased proteasomal\ndegradation induced by an increase in ROS (see the\nDiscussion for further explanation).\nHIF-1a inhibition attenuates the recovery of\nastrocytes from Glu toxicity under severe\nhypoxia\nTo confirm whether the recovery of the cell morphology and\ncell viability under severe hypoxia was in fact due to the\nexpression of HIF-1a, the effect of two HIF-1a inhibitors,\nYC-1 and 2Me2, were examined on astrocyte damage. Although\nthe mechanism of HIF-1a inhibition by YC-1 and 2Me2 is not fully\nunderstood, it appears as though YC-1 acts at a post-translational\ninhibits HIF-1a at the level of translation (Mabjeesh et al., 2003).\nAstrocytes were pre-treated with a 0.1 mM concentration of the\ninhibitors for 1 h and then subjected to severe hypoxia with\nthe addition of 1 mM Glu for an additional 3 h. Astrocytes\ntreated with YC-1 or 2Me2 showed much less HIF-1a expression\nin the nuclei of astrocytes under severe hypoxia in the presence of\n0 and 1 mM Glu (Figure 3A). The immunostaining also reveals\nthat the addition of either YC-1 or 2Me2 resulted in an\nattenuation of the recovery of the cell morphology when\ncompared with the controls. Western blotting confirmed that the\ninhibitors did decrease the HIF-1a protein level (Figure 3B).\nTable 1 shows the effects of the two HIF-1 inhibitors on\ncell morphology quantified by the texture analysis and cell\nviability assays. Both YC-1 and 2Me2 treatments resulted in a\nsignificant change in cell morphology and significant increase\nFigure 2 HIF-1a expression was increased in astrocytes exposed to severe hypoxia and Glu\n(A) Representative immunofluorescent images showing GFAP (red) and HIF-1a (green) labelling in astrocytes treated with 0, 0.1 and 1 mM\nGlu under N (normoxia) or SH (severe hypoxia) for 3 h.

Astrocytes treated with the HIF-1a inhibitors\nunder normoxia showed no significant effect (Table 1). The\nincrease in cell death was consistent with no recovery in\ntexture with either YC-1 or 2Me2 treatment under severe\nhypoxia. This suggests that the recovery in astrocyte\nmorphology is caused by the stabilization of HIF-1a under\nlow oxygen levels.\nGSH stabilizes HIF-1a expression\nGSH is the most abundant small molecule anti-oxidant that\nsuppresses free radical levels and protects cells against\nvarious stress conditions. Previous data from our laboratory\nhas shown that GSH increases HIF-1a expression during\noxygen deprivation (Guo et al., 2008). To determine whether\nGSH plays a role in the HIF-1a stability and protective effect\nin astrocytes, we compared GSH levels between the different\ntreatments. The cellular GSH level was measured using the\nMCB method. Fluorescence intensities of GSH-MCB were\nquantified to differentiate between the levels of GSH present\nin astrocytes treated with 0.1 and 1 mM Glu under normoxia\nversus severe hypoxia. The results showed no change in GSH\nlevels in the presence of Glu lower than 0.1 mM under\nnormoxia; however, 1 mM Glu caused a significant in-\ncrease in GSH (Figures 4A and 4B). Hypoxia increased the GSH\nlevels in astrocytes. The presence of Glu further increased the\nGSH level in astrocytes exposed to hypoxia.\nTo determine whether an increase in GSH levels con-\ntributed to the up-regulated HIF-1a expression, we fixed the\ncells after MCB treatment with or without severe hypoxia\nin the presence of Glu and then co-stained for GFAP and HIF-\n1a. The results showed a co-localization of increased GSH\nwith HIF-1a expression in astrocytes treated with both 0.1\nand 1 mM Glu (Figure 4C). This suggests that GSH might help\nstabilize HIF-1a expression in the astrocytes. To confirm the\nrole of GSH in the HIF-1a up-regulation, astrocytes were pre-\ntreated with 5 mM BSO, which decreases cellular GSH levels,\nfor 12 h and then exposed to Glu and hypoxia. This resulted\nin a significant attenuation of HIF-1a stabilization (Figure 5).\nFurthermore, inhibition of GSH and consequently HIF-1a,\ndecreased astrocyte survival and abolished the morphological\nrecovery under hypoxia (Table 2). These results are consistent\nwith the results of HIF-1a inhibition using YC-1 and 2Me2;\nindicating that HIF-1 provides protection against Glu in\nhypoxic astrocytes.\nDISCUSSION\nTo date, there are no effective neuroprotectants for human\nstroke, and the development of neuroprotective strategies is\nconsidered extremely challenging. Although many agents\nhave been tested for the treatment of ischaemic stroke, such\nas anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, anti-excitotoxic and anti-\ninflammatory drugs, they have all proved unsuccessful. One of\nthe reasons for this may be our incomplete understanding\nof the mechanisms that are responsible for cellular death.\nFurthermore, the study of cell death following cerebral\nischaemia has been primarily focused on neurons. In addition\nto neurons, ischaemia also causes damage to astrocytes\nGiffard and Swanson, 2005), which are critical in maintaining\nneuronal viability and functions under ischaemic conditions.\nTherefore targeting astrocytes can be an important strategy\nto enhance neuronal survival.\nFigure 3 YC-1 and 2Me2 attenuated the protection provided by hypoxia\nin astrocytes\n(A) Representative immunofluorescent images demonstrating the effect of YC-1\nand 2Me2 on HIF-1a (green) expression and astrocyte morphology (GFAP, red).\nAstrocytes were pre-treated with 0.1 mM YC-1 and 2Me2 followed by 1 mM Glu\nwith exposure to N (normoxia) or SH (severe hypoxia) 3 h.

Although HIF-1\nhas been shown to have a protective effect specifically in\nastrocytes in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease\n(Schubert et al., 2009), few studies have been done to\ninvestigate the effect of HIF-1a expression on astrocytes\nduring stroke.\nGiven the increase in Glu in the ischaemic brain and the\nscavenging function of astrocytes on Glu, we examined\nthe effects of Glu on the viability and morphology of\nastrocytes exposed to hypoxia. Compared with neurons,\nastrocytes are very resistant to hypoxia due to several factors.\nFirst, astrocytes have large glycogen stores (Phelps, 1972)\nthat can be metabolized to glucose and lactate and supply\nenergy during ischaemia and glucose deprivation (Swanson\nFigure 5 GSH inhibition reduces HIF-1a expression\n(A) Representative immunofluorescence images demonstrating the effect of BSO on HIF-1a (green) expression and astrocyte\nmorphology.

Secondly, astrocytes have a low energy\ndemand, unlike neurons, which have a high density of ion\nchannels and require more ATP to maintain ionic gradients.\nThus ionic deregulation occurs slowly in astrocytes (Silver\net al., 1997). Thirdly, astrocytes have a higher level of GSH, an\nimportant antioxidant, than neurons and provide GSH or\nsubstrates for GSH synthesis to neurons (Makar et al., 1994,\nChen and Swanson 2003). In our experiments, astrocytes were\nexposed to severe hypoxia (0.1% O2\n) because a milder hypoxic\n) was not sufficient to cause any significant\nchanges in HIF-1a expression (data not shown). As the results\ndemonstrated, Glu caused a concentration-dependent change\nin astrocyte morphology, which resembled a more diffuse-like\nstructure from a fibrous one, under normoxia. This was\ncorrelated with a decrease in cell viability determined by LDH\nand MTT assays. Interestingly, when the astrocytes were\ntreated with the same Glu concentrations under severe\nhypoxia there was a recovery in cell morphology and cell\nviability. Our observation is consistent with a previous study\nthat demonstrated that pre-treatment with hypoxia reduced\nOne of the remarkable observations in our study is that\nincreased GSH is not sufficient to protect astrocytes from\ndamage induced by Glu under normoxia. As shown in\nFigures 4(A) and 4(B), Glu at 1 mM significantly elevated\nthe GSH level in astrocyte under normoxia and induced\nsignificant cell damage detected by cellular texture and\nviability (Figure 1). In contrast, under hypoxic conditions\nthe increase of GSH was accompanied by improved cellular\ntexture and astrocyte viability (Figures 1 and 4). This\nprotective effect provided in the hypoxic conditions is largely\nascribed to the expression of HIF-1, since inhibiting HIF-1\nabolished the protection (Figure 3 and Table 1). Furthermore,\nstabilizing HIF-1a expression under normoxia with cobalt\nchloride appeared to have an even more significant effect in\nthe recovery of cell morphology (Supplementary Figure S1B\nhtm). Taken together, these findings strongly support that the\nactivation of HIF-1 is responsible for promoting the astrocytic\nsurvival and protection against Glu toxicity under hypoxia.\nMany factors may contribute to HIF-1-mediated protection\nin hypoxic astrocytes. First, HIF-1 up-regulates EPO (Semenza\net al., 1997), which provides cellular protection under\ndifferent stresses. Many studies have examined the effect\nof EPO on astrocytes, since they are the main source of EPO in\nthe brain. For example, EPO has been shown to protect\nastrocytes from damage in response to oxidative stress (Liu\net al., 2006) and other agents that induce apoptosis\n(Diaz et al., 2005). Secondly, HIF-1 leads to the induction of\nVEGF in astrocytes (Sinor et al., 1998). VEGF has been shown\nto play an important role in cellular protection in hypoxic\npreconditioning (Wick et al., 2002) by promoting angiogen-\nrevealed that exogenous VEGF induces astrocyte proliferation.\nIn addition, HIF-1 may promote the production of adenosine\nthat offers neuroprotective properties (Heurteaux et al.,\npresynaptic A1\nreceptor and may lead to a decrease in Ca2+\ninflux. This further decreases the release of Glu and excitation\nof the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, thus pre-\nventing cellular damage caused by the subsequent increases\nby Batti et al. (2010) has shown that the stabilization of HIF-\n1a through prolyl hydroxylase inhibition protected against\nGlu-induced damage in the hippocampus of the rat ischaemic\nbrain mainly through adenosine accumulation in response to\nhypoxia. A review article by Vangeison and Rempe (2009)\nclearly describes how hypoxia and HIF-1 can regulate various\nproteins, including connexin 43, CD73 and the ENT-1\n(equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1), which ultimately\nleads to enhanced adenosine levels. Of these, both CD73 and\nENT-1 have been shown to be regulated by HIF-1 in intestinal\nepithelia (Synnestvedt el al. 2002) and endothelial cells\nexpressed in astrocytes (Vangeison and Rempe 2009);\ntherefore it is possible that HIF-1 can regulate their activity\nand increase adenosine in astrocytes. In fact, it has been\nshown that adenosine has a direct protective effect on rat\nprimary astrocytes by reducing death induced by glucose\ndeprivation (Shin et al., 2002) and in reducing damage in\nhuman astroglioma D384 cells following oxygen deprivation\nthrough the preservation of ATP levels (Bjorklund et al.,\nFigure 6 Schematic diagram of GSH\u00adHIF-1 cross-talk in promoting cell\nsurvival during hypoxia\nHypoxia leads to HIF-1 stabilization which subsequently activates the\nexpression of various pro-survival genes. These include EPO, VEGF, HSPs, HO-\n1 and proteins that increase glucose metabolism such as glucose transporters\nand glycolytic enzymes. Genes such as those of glucose metabolism,\nHSPs and HO-1 may increase the level of GSH causing it to exert its anti-\noxidant effect and promote survival. In addition, the reducing environment\ncreated by GSH can in turn contribute to HIF-1 stabilization.\nHIF-1 protection in astrocytes\nE 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nThe results presented in this paper clearly demonstrate that\nGSH increases the HIF-1a level in astrocytes exposed to\nhypoxia. As shown in Figure 4, there was an increase in GSH\nfollowing the 3 h Glu and severe hypoxia treatment. In\naddition, BSO, which inhibits GSH synthesis, decreased HIF-1a\nexpression. Our results are consistent with previous studies\nthat have shown that altering redox status can effect HIF-1a\nexpression in other types of cells. Inhibition of GSH synthesis\nby BSO reduced HIF-1a expression in lung epithelial cells\nTreatment with N-acetylcysteine, the GSH precursor,\nincreased HIF-1a expression in lung epithelial cells (Haddad\nJin et al., 2011). Our previous results have also demonstrated\nthat HIF-1a stability favours a reducing environment in\nshowed that the induction of HIF under hypoxia is regulated\nby the redox state of GSH in HSC-2 (human oral squamous\ncells). They suggest that GSH can regulate the activation of\nHIF by directly binding to the thiol groups of regulatory\ncellular proteins. Since HIF-1a is sensitive to redox status and\ncan be degraded by increased ROS (Liu et al., 2004; Wellman\net al., 2004), it is reasonable to consider that the mechanism\nby which GSH increases HIF-1a is through the clearance of\nexcessive ROS and by promoting a suitable reducing\nenvironment that prolongs its stabilization. Our immunoblot\nresults showed that, under normoxia, there was an increase in\nHIF-1a levels when astrocytes were treated with 1 mM Glu.\nEven though this increase was not significant, it did correlate\nwith increased GSH levels. It seems as though GSH is able\nto stabilize HIF-1a and reduce its degradation when it is\nnormally expressed during hypoxia. However, during nor-\nmoxia, the oxygen levels are sufficient to maintain prolyl\nhydroxylase activity and target HIF-1a for ubiquitination.\nMeanwhile, HIF-1 may increase the level of GSH in hypoxic\nastrocytes, as shown in our results. Others have also reported\nthat HIF-1 is able to maintain GSH levels in brains of rats\nexposed to hypoxia (Shrivastava et al, 2008). In addition,\nprevious studies have shown that HIF-1 can protect\nastrocytes from ROS-induced injury (Chu et al., 2010) and\nthat GSH depletion induces astrocytic death in response to\nROS (Im et al., 2006). All these results indicate that\nmaintaining GSH levels and reducing ROS toxicity is part of\nHIF-1-mediated neuroprotection. Based on our results and\nothers, we postulate the GSH\u00adHIF-1 crosstalk in hypoxic\nastrocytes (Figure 6). Hypoxia induces accumulation of HIF-1,\nwhich subsequently switches on the expression of genes that\npromote cell survival such as glucose transporters and\nglycolytic enzymes, EPO, VEGF, HSPs (heat-shock proteins)\net al., 2008), etc. Some of the genes such as EPO and VEGF\nprovide direct cell protection against hypoxic stress. Others,\nsuch as those of glucose metabolism, HSPs and HO-1, may\nincrease the level of GSH, contributing to HIF-1 stabilization.\nIn conclusion, there are still large gaps that exist in our\nunderstanding of how astrocytes are affected during stroke.\nGiven that the release of the Glu is considered to be the\nleading cause of brain damage following stroke, we\ndetermined the effect of HIF-1a expression and stabilization\non how astrocytes respond to Glu toxicity during stroke. Our\nstudy has shown that HIF-1a expression protects astrocytes\nfrom Glu-induced damage. We also provide evidence that\nGSH plays a role in HIF-1a stabilization and promotes its\nprotective effect. Taking this fact into consideration will lead\nto a better understanding of the protective mechanisms of\nastrocytes and provide a more effective approach not only to\nstroke therapy but also other pathological conditions that\ncause, or are exacerbated by, excitotoxicity.\n"
