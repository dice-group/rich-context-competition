The \u00aerst method, clinical\nstudies, recruits samples from the patients who\nattend clinics because they have, or suspect they\nhave, a particular health problem. Constituting the\nvast preponderance of available empirical studies\non erectile dysfunction, such studies can reveal a\ngreat deal about the nature of erectile dysfunction in\nparticular patients, even with concomitant disease\nprocesses like hypertension or diabetes, because of\nthe detailed opportunities to collect carefully mon-\nitored physiological and biologically relevant tests,\nphysical examinations and case histories that permit\nthe exploration of complex etiologies and courses of\ndysfunction (cf. references 1 and 2).1,2 One must\nrealize, however, that such samples are drawn from\nthe population at large in highly biased or selective\nways that are dif\u00aecult or impossible to gauge or\nevaluate and thus they can tell us little about the\nprevalence of the problem in the population at large.\nThe second method, probability-based surveys,\nrecruits representative (cross-section) samples from\nwell-de\u00aened populations at large that are indepen-\ndently de\u00aened from the health condition of inter-\nest \u00d0 that is, both healthy and af\u00aficted persons are\nincluded in the sample in direct proportion to their\nprevalence in that population universe. A central\nproblem in these types of studies is the validity and\nreliability of identi\u00aecation of those who have the\nhealth condition and those who do not. The problem\narises because the rich array of diagnostic techni-\nques available in clinical studies are not practicable\nin most population surveys and reliance must thus\nbe placed on self-reports with their well-known\nbiases of under-reporting due to concerns about\nsocial stigmatization or due to lack of awareness\nbecause the condition is asymptomatic or undiag-\nnosed. Moreover, self-reports vary in their ability to\ntap accurately the health condition of interest since\nthese indicators may also capture other conditions.\nThere are only three population-based surveys of\nerectile dysfunction known in the literature, but\nonly two of these are based on modern probability-\nbased sampling strategies. Alfred Kinsey et al3 (cf.\nreference 4)4 reported on erectile dysfunction based\non their large and broadly selected sample, but\nKinsey himself explicitly rejected the notion that\nrandomly drawn samples could be drawn to study\nsensitive sexual phenomena and thus relied on\nvolunteer samples from an ill-de\u00aened region of\nnorthern Indiana and the Chicago area, plus addi-\ntions from other places. It is well known that\nvolunteer samples are biased in favor of those who\nare especially interested in the phenomena under\ninvestigation \u00d0 in this case, sexual behavior, and are\ntherefore likely to overestimate the incidence and\nprevalence of various behaviors and conditions\nrelated to sexuality (cf. Laumann et al5: Chapters 2,\nAppendices A and B). Estimates from Kinsey's work\ncan thus only be taken as suggestive and cannot\nreliablybeusedin systematic,over-timecomparisons.\nThe other two surveys are recent and use modern\nprobability sampling techniques. The Massachus-\nsets Male Aging Study (MMAS), consisting of 1709\nfree-living, non-institutionalized men between the\nages of 40 and 70 y living in the greater Boston area\nsiological measures, demographic information, and\nself-reported erectile functional status (cf. references\n6 to 8).a Because of the rigorous requirements for\ncollecting blood samples from the respondents early\n{ Paper for presentation in the Grand Master Lecture Series at\nthe annual meeting of the Society for the Study of Impotence,\nhttp://www.stockton-press.co.uk/ijir\nin the morning, the length of time required, and the\nusual dif\u00aeculties of recruiting male respondents, the\nsample completion rate was only 53%, raising some\nconcerns about possible biases in participation. The\nNational Health and Social Life Survey (NHSLS) is a\nwomen between the ages of 18 and 59 y living in\nhouseholds throughout the United States in 1992\n97% of the population in this age range \u00d0 roughly\n150 million Americans. It excludes people living in\ngroup quarters such as barracks, college dormitories,\nand prisons, as well as those who do not know\nEnglish well enough to be interviewed. The sample\ncompletion rate was greater than 79%. While the\ncentral focus of the MMAS was on impotence among\naging males, the NHSLS was principally directed to\na broad-ranging inquiry into US sexual practices and\nbeliefs among younger adults. As a result, it\ncollected only limited information on sexual dys-\nfunction, broadly de\u00aened, and physical health\nconditions. The two surveys thus complement one\nanother rather nicely, with the MMAS providing\nespecially detailed opportunities to investigate the\nrelevance of changing hormonal levels across ages\non erectile functioning, among other things, but\nwith a more limited capacity to generalize to the\ncountry as a whole. In contrast, the NHSLS has only\nlimited information on erectile dysfunction per se\nbut the capacity to place it in the much broader\nperspective of US demographics and sexual dys-\nfunction more broadly conceived (see, for example,\nreference 10). As we shall see, where the \u00aendings of\nthese two studies overlap, they are remarkably\nconsistent.b\nSexual dysfunction was indexed in the NHSLS\naccording to seven dichotomous response items,\neach measuring the presence of a critical symptom\nor problem during the past 12 months.c Response\nitems included: (1) lacking desire for sex; (2) arousal\ndif\u00aeculties (i.e., erection problems in men, lubrica-\ntion dif\u00aeculties in women); (3) inability achieving\nclimax or ejaculation; (4) anxiety about sexual\nperformance; (5) climaxing or ejaculating too\nrapidly; (6) physical pain during intercourse; and\n(7) not \u00aending sex pleasurable.d (The NHSLS\nmeasure of erectile dysfunction, because it asks the\nrespondent to identify a problem of at least several\nmonths duration, seems roughly equivalent to the\nMMAS's de\u00aenition of moderate to complete impo-\ntence. For the men aged 40 to 59 y in both samples,\nroughly comparable rates of self-reported erectile\ndysfunction are observed.) Table 1 provides the\nprevalence of six male dysfunction items by demo-\ngraphic characteristics, including age, marital sta-\ntus, education and race or ethnicity.e The adjusted\nodds ratios in the table take into account all the\ndemographic predictors plus controls for religious\naf\u00aeliation and residence in rural, suburban or urban\nareas. Note that, except for marital status and age,\nthe other demographic characteristics are unrelated\nto the prevalence of erectile dysfunction. For\ncomparative purposes, it is worth noting that there\nare differential distributions of the other sexual\ndysfunctions across demographic categories. It is\nalso worth noting that while erectile dysfunction is\nclearly related to age, the crude prevalence of\nerectile dysfunction among 18 to 29-year-olds stands\nat 7%, and that is likely to be under-estimated\nbecause of the strong social concerns about stigma-\ntization among younger men.\nAlso, for comparative purposes, it is worth\nknowing how the \u00aeve other dysfunctions co-exist\nwith erectile dysfunction.f The respondent was\npermitted to check as many dysfunctions as applied\nto him. One can thus compute the conditional\nprobability of having a particular dysfunction, given\nthat the man also has an erectile dysfunction.\nAccounting for the prevalence of the other dysfunc-\ntions in question, one can compute the odds of\nhaving both sexual dysfunction A and erectile\ndysfunction against the odds of having erectile\ndysfunction alone.\nOdds ratios of both sexual dysfunction A and\nerectile dysfunction vs erectile dysfunction only:\nAnxious about performance 10.53; Unable to\nExperienced pain during sex 7.46.\nRisk factors for erectile function\nA latent class analysis (LCA) was used to evaluate\nthe syndromal clustering of individual sexual\ndysfunctions or symptoms. Latent class analysis is\na statistical method well suited for grouping cate-\ngorical data into latent classes11,12 and has a number\nof medical applications, such as evaluation of\ndiagnostic systems13 \u00b1 15 and generation of epidemio-\nlogical estimates using symptom data.16,17 Latent\nclass analysis tests whether a latent variable,\nspeci\u00aeed as a set of mutually exclusive classes\naccounts for the observed covariation among man-\nifest, categorical variables. By accounting for ob-\nserved covariation among dysfunction items, LCA,\nin essence, attempts to improve on construct\nvalidity which is more problematic when using\ninformation from one survey indicator. These\ncategories, then, represent a typology of disorders\nfor sexual dysfunction found in the US population,\nindicating both prevalence and types of symptoms.\n(See the Appendix for detailed information on the\nassociation of speci\u00aec symptoms with the four\ncategories of sexual dysfunction.)\nOnly those respondents reporting at least one\npartner in the prior 12-month period were included\nEpidemiology of erectile dysfunction\nEO Laumann et al\nin the LCA. This procedure may limit the results\nbecause excluded respondents may have avoided\nsex because of sexual problems. However, this\nprocedure was necessary to ensure that each\nrespondent answered all the symptom items since\nthree items were asked only of sexually active\nrespondents. A total of 139 men were excluded on\nthis basis. These excluded men were more likely to\nbe single and have lower levels of education. We\nexpect that this will bias our estimates of prevalence\nof sexual dysfunction downward since sexually\ninactive men generally reported higher rates of\nsymptoms. With respect to erection problems, 14%\nof excluded men reported this problem in compar-\nison to a 10% prevalence among men included in\nthe analyses.\nThe results of LCA allow for analyzing risk factors\nand quality-of-life concomitants in relation to\ncategories of sexual dysfunction, rather than indivi-\ndual symptoms. These results indicate that the\nclustering of symptoms according to syndrome can\nbe represented by four categories of men. Latent\nclass analysis also estimates the size of each class as\na proportion of the total sample, a result correspond-\ning to prevalence of categories of sexual dysfunction\nin the US population. Finally, LCA identi\u00aees each\nclass's symptoms, indicating the likelihood that\nrespondents in that class will exhibit a given\nsymptom, thus providing researchers with informa-\ntion about what elements characterize each category.\nAlthough not equivalent to clinical diagnosis, this\napproach offers a statistical representation of sexual\ndysfunction.\nA large proportion of men (70% prevalence)\nconstitutes an unaffected population in the age\nrange of 18 to 59-year-old men. The remaining three\nclasses consist of premature ejaculation (21% pre-\nvalence), erectile dysfunction (5% prevalence), and\nlow sexual desire (5% prevalence). Overall, the LCA\nprocedure estimates 5% prevalence for erectile\ndysfunction, a \u00aegure that is lower than the 10%\nestimate using the single indicator. This difference\ncan be explained by the lower validity using only\nthe single indicator, which is likely to include other\ncauses of the indicator that are unrelated to erectile\ndysfunction per se. Tables 2 and 3 present multi-\nnomial logistic regressions on categories of sexual\ndysfunction. Adjusted ORs indicate the relative risk\nof experiencing a given category of sexual dysfunc-\ntion vs reporting no problems for each risk factor,\nwhile controlling for other characteristics.\nTable 2 classi\u00aees risk factors into three sets:\nhealth and lifestyle, social status, and sexual\nexperience. With regard to health and lifestyle risk\nfactors, those who experience emotional or stress-\nrelated problems are more likely to experience\nsexual dysfunctions de\u00aened in each of the cate-\ngories. Men with poor health have elevated risk for\nall three categories of sexual dysfunction. The\npresence of urinary tract symptoms appears to\nimpact premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunc-\ntion. But having ever had a sexually transmitted\ninfection, indulging currently in moderate to high\nalcohol consumption, and being circumcised, gen-\nerally do not result in increased odds of experien-\ncing sexual dysfunction.\nSocial status variables, which measure an indivi-\ndual's socioeconomic and normative position rela-\ntive to other persons, assess how sociocultural\nposition affect sexual function. Deterioration in\neconomic position, indexed by falling household\nincome, doubles the likelihood of erectile dysfunc-\ntion but has no association with the other two\ncategories of male dysfunction. Men with liberal or\n`hedonistic' attitudes about sex are approximately\n1.75 times more likely to experience premature\nejaculation; this is the only attitude complex that is\nsigni\u00aecantly associated with a sexual dysfunction.\nFinally, various aspects of sexual experience\nresult in an increased risk of sexual dysfunction.\nSexual history, indicated by having more than \u00aeve\nlifetime partners and by engaging currently in\nmasturbation practices, does not increase relative\nrisk for men. But men reporting any same-sex\nactivity are more than twice as likely to experience\npremature ejaculation and low sexual desire. Male\nvictims of adult \u00b1 child contact or forced sexual\ncontact are three times as likely to experience\nerectile dysfunction and approximately two times\nas likely to experience premature ejaculation and\nlow sexual desire than those who have not been\nvictims of adult \u00b1 child contact. Finally, men who\nhave sexually assaulted women are 3.5 times as\nlikely to report erectile dysfunction. Indeed, trau-\nmatic sexual acts continue to exert profound effects\non sexual functioning, some effects lasting many\nyears beyond the occurrence of the original event\nQuality of life concomitants\nThe experience of sexual dysfunction is highly\nassociated with a number of unsatisfying personal\nexperiences and relationships. Table 3 highlights\nthe associations of categories of sexual dysfunction\nwith emotional and physical satisfaction with\nsexual partners and with feelings of general happi-\nness. However, no causal order should be assumed\nsince quality-of-life indicators are concomitant out-\ncomes of sexual dysfunction. Men with erectile\ndysfunction and low sexual desire experience\ndiminished quality of life, but those with premature\nejaculation are not affected. Despite the obvious\nadverse effects of sexual dysfunctions for quality of\nlife, only one in ten men reporting sexual dysfunc-\ntion sought help from healthcare professionals.\nEpidemiology of erectile dysfunction\nEO Laumann et al\nComment\nLow sexual interest and erection problems are age-\ndependent disorders, possibly resulting from phy-\nsiological changes associated with the aging process.\nIndeed, the NHSLS results are consistent with those\ngenerated by the MMAS, which determined that\n9.6% of its sample experienced complete impotence\nand showed a strong age association increasing from\nThe NHSLS data indicate that emotional and\nstress-related problems generate elevated risk of\nexperiencing sexual dif\u00aeculties in all phases of the\nsexual response cycle. While we caution that the\ncausal order of this relationship is uncertain, these\nresults suggest that psychosocial disturbances affect\nsexual functioning. This does not imply that the\nimpact of poor health is negligible. In fact, the\nopposite is demonstrated since age, health pro-\nblems, and urinary tract infections result in elevated\nrisk of experiencing sexual dysfunction as well.\nRather, both physiological and psychosocial sta-\ntuses are independent factors that affect sexual\nfunctioning.\nAppendix\nTable A1 shows latent class and conditional\nprobabilities for the best-\u00aetting four-class model\nproduced by the latent class analysis. Both the\nprevalence of a category of sexual dysfunction and\nthe likelihood that a class member will exhibit a\ngiven symptom are indicated. Note that erectile\ndysfunction (ED) as a symptom is differentially\ndistributed across the latent class categories: about\n1% of those classi\u00aeed as having `no problem' report\nED, 24% of those with premature ejaculation, 97%\nof those classi\u00aeed as having ED (but notice the high\nrates for other symptoms as well), and 0% for those\nreporting low desire. Each category of dysfunction\nhas a notably different pro\u00aele of symptoms.\nThe procedures used to generate our \u00aenal latent\nclass model consisted of three stages: (1) selection\nand cross-classi\u00aecation of manifest variables (i.e.,\nthe six sexual dysfunctional symptoms), (2) genera-\ntion of the best-\u00aetting models, and (3) assignment of\nindividual cases to latent classes. We used six\nmanifest, dichotomous variables, which generated\na corresponding cross-classi\u00aecation table with\n26  64 cells. The mean frequency of men per cell\nis 19.7. We excluded one symptom, pain during\nintercourse, in the analysis. This is justi\u00aeed partly\non theoretical and partly on empirical grounds. This\nsymptom was the least prevalent in the general\npopulation (only 3%) and, by including it, would\ndrop the mean frequency per cell to 9.8, causing\nsparse data problems in the analysis.\nNext, we generated a series of latent class models.\nTypically, goodness-of-\u00aet tests utilize df calcula-\ntions that are reclaimed when conditional probabil-\nities are found to be zero or one.12,19 However, while\nthis is a convenient strategy, it is not, strictly\nspeaking, correct.20 Instead, we performed good-\nness-of-\u00aet tests that did not reclaim df.21 As shown\nin Table A2, the best-\u00aetting model is a four-class\nsolution. Here, the \u00aeve-class solution did not have\nany advantages over the four-class solution, and the\nlatter is the most parsimonious model. Finally, in\nassigning individual cases to the latent classes, the\nprocedure correctly allocated 87.1% of the men.\nTable A1 Latent classes and conditional probabilities of sexual\ndysfunctiona\nLatent No Premature Erectile Low\nclassb Problems Ejaculation Dysfunction Desire\nConditional probabilities\nAnxious about\nperformance\nTrouble maintaining\nerection\na Source: National Health and Social Life Survey.b LCA excluded\nthe pain during intercourse item for men in order to avoid sparse\ndata problems.\nTable A2 Fit statistics for latent class models of male\ndysfunction\nNumber of latent Likelihood- Index of\nclasses ratio x2 df P dissimilarity\nReferences\n1 Benet AE, Melman A.

Self-reports about sexual dysfunctions,\nespecially in face-to- face interviews, are subject to\nunderreporting biases arising from personal con-\ncerns about social stigmatization. Moreover, there\nmay be systematic biases in underreporting related\nto particular attributes of the respondents.

However,\nanalyses indicate that reporting biases due to lack\nof privacy are negligible in NHSLS data (reference 5,\ne Although Laumann et al9 discuss both male and\nfemale sexual dysfunction and draw cross-gender\ncomparisons at least with respect to prevalence, we\nshall discuss only male dysfunction here because of\nthe focus of this society's concerns on impotence.\nMuch less appears to be known clinically about\nfemale dysfunction (in comparison to what is\nknown about male dysfunction). We believe the\nopportunity to examine erectile dysfunction in the\nbroader context of the other male sexual dysfunc-\ntions should prove instructive.\nf The prevalence of `pain during intercourse' was\nso low among men (3% of all men but 14.4% among\nwomen) that it could not be reliably investigated\nwith a sample of this size and was thus dropped\nfrom the analysis of male dysfunction in the latent\nclass analysis described below. For comparative\npurposes, however, we have included pain during\nintercourse in the list of odds ratios concerning\nindividual sexual dysfunctions.\nEpidemiology of erectile dysfunction\nEO Laumann et al"
