PBL is ideally suited\nfor student-centered learning and offers the most advantage\nin a student-centered classroom (Barrows & Tamblyn, 1980;\nDriessen & Van Der Vleuten, 2000). This article explores the\nprospects and possibilities of incorporating PBL into crimi-\nnology and criminal justice education as a way to promote\nstudents' higher order thinking and problem-solving skills.\nFirst, this article discusses a variety of learning theories and\nmany corresponding instructional models. Second, this arti-\ncle provides an overview of PBL and the empirical evidence\nfor the effectiveness of problem-based instruction. Third,\nthis article offers theoretical foundations for adopting PBL in\nthe study of crime and criminal justice. Finally, for scaffold-\ning instructors striving to implement PBL, this article\ndescribes possible formats of implementation, as well as\nidentifies the challenges new PBL instructors may face dur-\ning application and provides specific suggestions.\nTheories of Learning\nThere have been many scholarly efforts to develop effective\nteaching and learning environments in many disciplines.\nThere are two main underlying traditional learning theories:\nthe behavioral and cognitive models. The behavioral models\nof learning have their origins in the research and theories of\non conditioning. Learning is the acquisition of new behavior\nthrough a rewarding or reinforcing stimulus. Behavioral psy-\nchologists focus on stimuli in the external environment and\ntheir impact on changes in human behavior (Driscoll, 2005).\nThe educator's role is to arrange the environment, so that it\nproduces behavioral changes in the desired direction.\nBehavioral instruction is appropriate for skill development\nand training. However, the behavioral models of learning\nview a learner as a passive recipient of knowledge and over-\nlook the individual's mental processes (Jonassen & Land,\nHowever, drawing on the research and theories of Bruner\nother cognitive psychologists, the cognitive models of learn-\ning view a learner as an information processor and focus on\nthe internal mental processes of learning. The learner will\nattend and respond selectively to external stimuli based on\nhis or her prior knowledge and background. The role of the\ninstructor is to organize the content for the students so that it\nwill be easier for them to learn and to build instruction that\nenhances their cognitive capacity (Driscoll, 2005).

Cognitive\npsychologists relied more on knowledge transmission and\nreception for cognitive development through lecturing.\nRooted in behavioral and cognitive models, traditional\ninstruction poses several problems for effective teaching and\nlearning (Jonassen & Land, 2000). First, traditional instruc-\ntion is based on a communication model of instruction (sub-\nmission/transmission). The assumption is that knowledge is\ntransmitted from instructors to students. What has been over-\nlooked in this model is the importance of active learning on\nthe part of the student. Second, traditional instruction focuses\non the individual as the medium of learning and overlooked\nthe social nature of the process of making meaning; students\nlearn through social interaction with other peers and their\nenvironment.\nThe primary format of teaching under traditional instruc-\ntional models is lecture-based, teacher-centered learning\n(Birzer, 2004). Instructors decide what information and skills\nstudents should learn and deliver them. It is the most effi-\ncient method of dispensing content knowledge, especially\nwhen instructors can organize difficult subjects into easily\nunderstood formats. However, when students are heteroge-\nneous in background, knowledge, or experience, a teacher-\ncentered method may not meet their different educational\ninterests and career needs (Barrows & Tamblyn, 1980).\nStudents, in this situation, tend to become passive recipients\nof information and less responsible for their own learning.\nFinally, traditional instruction has been criticized for failing\nto promote advanced knowledge acquisition while oversim-\nplifying conceptual complexity in many knowledge domains\nand focusing on memorizing facts and low-level concepts\n(McCaslin & Good, 1992; Spiro, Feltovich, Jacobson, &\nCoulson, 1991). These deficiencies in the outcomes of stu-\ndent learning result from biases in the underlying assump-\ntions upon which traditional instruction is based (Spiro et al.,\nDuring the 1990s, constructivist learning theories\nemerged for new instructional design. There are three fun-\ndamental shifts in the underlying assumptions about teach-\ning and learning (Jonassen & Land, 2000; Savery & Duffy,\n1995). First, learning is a process of making meaning that is\nbeyond simple knowledge transfer. Students should con-\nstruct their own knowledge and meaning from their learning\nand experiences. Second, making meaning is a product of\nsocial negotiation with other humans, as well as one of\ninternal negotiation. For example, students should actively\ninteract with their peers to construct their own knowledge,\nand through making sense of those interactions, they can\ncreate or modify their own knowledge. Third, learning takes\nplace in association with any social artifacts in the world, as\nwell as other humans. Students should consider the socio-\ncultural and sociohistorical settings in which learning\noccurs.\nThere have been many student-centered learning pedago-\ngies reflecting constructivist learning assumptions, such as\nPBL (Hmelo-Silver, 2004), anchored instruction (Cognition\nand Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1992), cognitive\napprenticeships (Collins, 2006; Collins, Brown, & Newman,\nbased scenarios (Schank, 1992), computer-supported collab-\norative learning (Stahl, Koschmann, & Suthers, 2006),\nproject-based learning (Krajcik & Blumenfeld, 2006;\nKrajcik, Blumenfeld, Marx, & Soloway, 1994), constructiv-\nist learning environments (Jonassen, 1999), games and simu-\nlations (Clark, Nelson, Sengupta, & D'Angelo, 2009), and\nopen learning environments (Hannafin, Land, & Oliver,\n1999). As these student-centered learning approaches pro-\nvide more flexible alternatives to the design of instruction,\nstudents are able to make their present learning relevant to\ntheir interests and needs and deepen their understanding\nThe Literature Review for PBL\nPBL refers to a student-centered curriculum that empowers\nstudents to conduct research and requires them to learn\nknowledge and skills while solving real work problems in\nrelevant and authentic contexts (Glasgow, 1997; Savery,\n2006). Given that PBL has been used in a variety of forms\nacross disciplines and educational levels, it is imperative to\nidentify some of its essential characteristics to reduce possi-\nble misapplications and achieve the anticipated learning out-\nfour key elements of PBL.1 First, ill-structured problems are\npresented to students in a way that they produce multiple\npotential causes and solutions through free inquiry.According\nto Ge and Land (2004), ill-structured problems are defined as\n\"those that we encounter in everyday life, in which one or\nseveral aspects of the situation is not well specified, the goals\nare unclear, and there is insufficient information to solve\nthem\" (p. 5). When a problem is ill-structured, it is difficult\nto reach an agreement on what specific solution is appropri-\nate, and thus there is a larger individual variability in prob-\nlem solving (Jonassen, 1997). Second, students have\nresponsibility for their own learning. They decide what to\nlearn and find appropriate information to solve the problems\nfrom various resources (libraries, online, experts, and text-\nbooks). Third, instructors act as a class facilitator in the\nlearning process. Instructors assist students in developing\nproblem-solving skills by showing them how to learn rather\nthan simply dispensing information. Fourth, authenticity\nforms the learning process of PBL. The problem should be\nrelevant to students' future careers and lives. The skills and\nactivities required of students in PBL should be those valued\nin real world.\nMany scholars have argued that PBL is an appealing\ninstructional strategy that leads to active, self-directed\nlearning of students and allows students to learn knowledge\nwhile solving problems (Birch, 1986; Bransford, Sherwood,\nGallagher, 1993). There have been a large number of prior\nstudies to examine the effectiveness of PBL. Most studies\nhave been conducted in medical schools, but relatively little\nresearch has occurred in other disciplines. For example, using\na quasi-experimental research design, Tayyeb (2013) exam-\nined the effectiveness of PBL to improve content knowledge\nand critical thinking among medical students. He found that\nthe PBL curriculum is more effective than the traditional lec-\nture-based curriculum in improving critical thinking and\nproblem-solving skills among medical students. In general,\nempirical findings in prior studies are more favorable to PBL\ncurriculum over traditional lecture-based curriculum when it\ncomes to student outcomes such as motivation, interest, stu-\ndent satisfaction, clinical performance, deeper understanding,\ncontextual learning, self-directed learning, and/or self-regu-\nlated learning at various disciplines and educational levels\n(e.g., Gallagher, Stepien, & Rosenthal, 1992; Kaufman &\nDespite the positive evidence of PBL on student learning\noutcomes, there has been no agreement on the effectiveness\nof PBL. For example, Sevening and Baron (2002) compared\nstudy outcomes between the PBL and the traditional lecture-\nbased classes using a quasi-experimental research design.\nThey found no differences between the two groups in terms\nof students' achievement gains and attitudes. In addition,\nthat there is no evidence that the PBL curriculum improved\nproblem solving, knowledge acquisition, motivation, and/or\nself-directed learning skills compared with the traditional\nlecture-based curriculum.\nA number of meta-analyses were conducted to explain\nthese mixed results and provide a synthesis of the effects of\nPBL, especially for medical education (Albanese & Mitchell,\nden Bossche, & Gijbels, 2003; Gijbels, Dochy, Van den\nBarneveld, 2009, for a summary of meta-analyses). However,\nthere were still inconsistent results on the value of the PBL\ninstruction. For example, Vernon and Blake (1993) demon-\nstrated \"the superiority of the PBL approach over more tradi-\ntional methods in several of the outcome domains examined\"\n\"no convincing evidence for the effectiveness of PBL, at\nleast not the magnitude of effectiveness that would be hoped\nfor with a major curriculum intervention\" (p. 264).\nUsing a qualitative meta-synthesis of the existing meta-\nanalyses, Strobel and Barneveld (2009) concluded that \"PBL\nwas superior when it comes to long-term retention, skill\ndevelopment, and satisfaction of students and teachers, while\ntraditional approaches were more effective for short-term\nretention as measured by standardized board exams\" (p. 44).\nAlthough the traditional learning curriculum has an advan-\ntage over the PBL curriculum when it comes to short-term\nacquisition and retention for the standardized board exams\n(multiple-choice and true/false items), knowledge acquisi-\ntion through the traditional methods is not transferred into\nlong-term memory and lasts for a very limited amount of\ntime. Most importantly, as PBL was designed to promote stu-\ndents' application of knowledge within an authentic context,\nchange their attitudes toward active learning, and promote\ntheir positive social interaction skills, the focus on short-term\nknowledge gain as the learning outcome of PBL is inappro-\npriate (Barrows, 2002). Finally, by conducting a meta-\nanalysis, Walker and Leary (2009) examined differences in\nPBL outcomes across disciplines such as allied health, busi-\nness, engineering, medical education, science, social sci-\nence, teacher education, and others (aviation, kinesiology,\nand textiles). Overall, PBL was found to be a more effective\ninstructional method in the last three disciplines than tradi-\ntional lecture-based learning.\nPBL has been used in criminal justice practice and educa-\ntion. For example, as part of efforts to support problem-ori-\nented policing (POP),2 many law enforcement agencies have\nadopted PBL at their police training academies. Although\nanecdotal evidence of the effectiveness of PBL in police\ntraining exists, there was no empirical evidence. Werth\n(2009) examined learners' perceptions of their PBL experi-\nences at the Idaho Peace Officer Standards and Training\n(POST) Academy. PBL was effective in the development of\ndecision-making, problem-solving, and collaboration skills\nas well as providing subject-matter knowledge.\nAlthough there have been scholarly efforts to incorporate\nactive learning techniques into criminal justice courses so as\nto promote higher order thinking and relevant knowledge\nrelatively new learning pedagogy. Within my knowledge,\nthere are only a few articles that introduce PBL in the crimi-\nnal justice courses. For example, as one of the four active\nlearning pedagogies such as collaborative learning, PBL,\nservice learning, and engaging undergraduate students in\nresearch, Sims (2006) provided an overview of PBL (i.e., ori-\ngins, activities, advantages, and disadvantages) for the use of\nPBL in criminal justice courses. Burke and Owen (2011)\nbriefly discussed four PBL activities that can be incorporated\ninto criminal justice courses such as discussion scenarios,\ntabletop simulations, role-playing activities, and case\nmethod. Finally, this article will expand existing literature by\nproviding theoretical frameworks to incorporate PBL into\ncriminology and criminal justice education. Also, this article\nidentifies several challenges and proposes recommendations\nfor successful implementation of PBL in criminology and\ncriminal justice classrooms.\n4 SAGE Open\nTheoretical Framework for\nIncorporating PBL Into Criminology\nand Criminal Justice\nCognitive Flexibility Theory\nCognitive flexibility theory provides a conceptual model for\ndesigning learning environments in which students can\ndevelop their cognitive flexibility; that is, the ability to\nassemble and use diverse knowledge sources to promote\ntheir understanding and decision-making in a given situation\n(Spiro, Coulson, Feltovich, & Anderson, 1988). Cognitive\nflexibility is very important for advanced knowledge acqui-\nsition in ill-structured disciplines. There are seven theoretical\nrationales: (a) avoidance of oversimplification and overregu-\nlarization of knowledge, (b) the use of multiple mental and\npedagogical representations of knowledge, (c) the centrality\nof case application, (d) conceptual knowledge as knowledge-\nin-use, (e) schema assembly from rigidity to flexibility, (f)\nnon-compartmentalization of concepts and cases, and (g)\nactive participation, tutorial guidance, and adjunct support\nfor the management of complexity.\nIn a nutshell, in ill-structured disciplines such as history,\nmedicine, law, and literary interpretation, many concepts\nfrom various disciplines are pertinent and interact contextu-\nally in the typical case of knowledge application. Instructors\nshould demonstrate the complexities and irregularities of\nadvanced knowledge acquisition, while emphasizing the\ninteractions among diverse sources of knowledge (Spiro et\nal., 1988). It is difficult to count on general principles to aid\nan understanding of the dynamics of particular cases because\nthere is great deal of variability across cases regarding which\nconcepts are relevant, and what patterns and combinations of\nknowledge are necessary to understand a case. Thus, stu-\ndents should be able to use various aspects of cross-disciplin-\nary knowledge and apply them flexibly in diverse contexts.\nIn this regard, knowledge acquisition in ill-structured disci-\nplines cannot be achieved simply by listening to instructors'\nlectures and/or reading textbooks (Land, Hannafin, & Oliver,\n2012). Instead, it requires active participation from students,\nand instructors must provide adequate guidance and support\nto promote students' active learning.\nCognitive flexibility is the foundation of PBL. The PBL\ncurriculum allows learners to focus on a problem and encour-\nages them to take multidisciplinary and integrated perspec-\ntives to understand all factors involved in finding causes and\nsolutions. It also produces more active student participation,\ninteraction, and collaboration in classrooms by involving the\nstudents in the solving of problems. Through PBL, students\ndevelop cognitive flexibility by learning how to use various\nknowledge sources for problem solving in new contexts.\nProblem-solving skills are very important for human exis-\ntence, especially in a constantly changing social environment\nthat requires people to continually engage in social\nproblems. Traditionally, literacy refers to the ability to read\nand write, but in contemporary society literacy refers more to\nthe functional ability to solve problems in cooperation with\ncolleagues (Glasgow, 1997). According to Postman and\nWeingartner (1969), a new education should set out to culti-\nvate experts in \"crap detecting,\" rather than promoting duti-\nful citizens who simply follow conventional assumptions,\nstandard practices, and cultural uniformity (p. 3). PBL is an\nimportant pedagogical tool helping students develop their\nproblem-solving abilities and educate them to become indi-\nviduals who can creatively respond to challenges within their\nprofession. Most importantly, PBL is made congruent with\nthe natural learning processes of humans and the progressive\nmechanism of our civilizations through challenge and\nresponse.3\nCriminology and Criminal Justice: Interdisciplinary\nStudies\nAccording to recent Gallup Polls, crime and the fear of crime\nrank as the most important issues in the United States (Jones,\nand is an important issue in determining public policy.\nAmerican society has higher crime rates than other industri-\nalized countries, especially in terms of violent crimes. The\ndisparity is greatest for homicide. In 2008, the homicide rate\nmuch lower in western European nations, such as Italy (1.2),\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2008). Despite\nrecent declines, Americans are still sensing an increase in\ncrime rates in their communities as well as in the whole\nIn response to high violent crime rates and the growing\nfear of crime, American society has responded punitively by\nrelying on the use of incarceration. In 2007, there were nearly\n2.3 million inmates incarcerated in jails and prisons. The\n& Sabol, 2008). This rate is significantly higher than that of\nceration rates become one of the most serious criminal jus-\ntice problems in the United States because there are many\ncollateral consequences of the prison boom, such as over-\ncrowding, the disproportionate presence of racial minorities,\ndisruption of family structure and relations, inequality, and\nlost social opportunity costs for other social services (e.g.,\neducation, medical services, and other social welfare pro-\nthere are numerous other crime and justice problems in the\nUnited States including gangs, drugs/alcohol abuse, guns,\nhigh recidivism rates, racial disparities in crime and punish-\nment, the war on drugs, racial profiling, and mental ill\noffenders.\ncrime and punishment are causally independent of one\nanother and more likely to be determined by the same kinds\nof socioeconomic factors. The sources of crime and punish-\nment are mostly invisible, and politicians and the public are\nnot easily able to discern them. It is thus important to exam-\nine the socioeconomic factors associated with crime and\ncriminal justice problems.\nIn consequence, criminology and criminal justice are an\narchetype of an advanced knowledge acquisition setting.\nVarious disciplines, such as sociology, psychology, biology,\nhistory, and law, serve as a foundation for the crime and\ncriminal justice studies. In ill-structured criminology and\ncriminal justice disciplines, instructors should emphasize the\ncomplexities and irregularities of crime and justice problems\nbecause the knowledge from such diverse fields is pertinent\nand interacts contextually in typical cases of problem solv-\ning. For example, there is a significant variation in crime\nrates over time across states or local communities in the\nUnited States. It is difficult to count on general principles to\naid an understanding of the dynamics of crimes in each state\nor local community. This is because there is a great deal of\nvariation across cities and states regarding which causes are\nrelevant and what combinations of knowledge are necessary\nto solve crimes. Crimes should be understood in the context\nof each unique application. It is, therefore, imperative to cre-\nate a new instructional model and a corresponding learning\nenvironment, so that students learn to integrate various bod-\nies of knowledge from a range of disciplines and apply them\nwith flexibility in new contexts.\nSpiro's cognitive flexibility theories provide a theoretical\nbackground that supports the use of PBL in criminology and\ncriminal justice education. In the United States, there are\nmany crime and criminal justice problems to which public\npolicymakers, criminal justice (CJ) professionals, and the\npublic need to respond. Through PBL, students learn to iden-\ntify the most important problems within the field, think of\nways to practically approach them, and propose realistic\nsolutions to address the problems. Students should integrate\nknowledge from a range of disciplines toward finding solu-\ntions because the causes of crime, and hence criminal justice\nproblems, originate within a range of other socioeconomic\nfactors. Due to the nature of ill-structured crime and criminal\njustice problems, finally, students are required to develop\ncognitive flexibility for problem solving.\nInterdisciplinary Integration Through PBL\nIn Interdisciplinary Integration: Building Criminology by\nStealing From Our Friends, Osgood (1998) emphasized the\nimportance of interdisciplinary approach to the study of\ncrime and justice as follows:\nFor every type of variable considered a potential source of\ncrime--whether it be family, community, brain chemistry,\norganizational structure, or labor market--there is some other\ngroup of scholars who take that topic as their primary focus. For\nevery aspect of the criminal justice system that we find of\ninterest, there are scholars who study comparable problems in\nother settings. I believe that one of the best ways to find new\ninsights that will help build our field is for criminologists to steal\nideas from these fields and bring them back to the rest of us.\nHe provides several suggestions to introduce knowledge\nfrom other disciplines to criminology: collaborating with\nscholars in other disciplines, keeping track of journals in\nother disciplines, attending conferences in other disciplines,\nrecruiting graduate students from other disciplines, publish-\ning papers in other disciplinary journals, and using textbooks\nfrom other disciplines relevant to crime and criminal justice.\nIn addition to his suggestions, incorporating the PBL cur-\nriculum into crime and justice studies is another way to cross\nboundaries and build bridges between criminology and crim-\ninal justice and other disciplines. According to Barrows and\nTamblyn (1980), PBL fits exceptionally well in interdisci-\nplinary disciplines. In PBL, students focus on a problem and\ntake multidisciplinary and integrated perspectives to under-\nstand all factors involved in finding causes and solutions. A\nworksheet for group projects is included in the appendix. To\nmeet this interdisciplinary goal, group projects can be used\nas the stimulus for discussion and collaboration among stu-\ndents who have different majors. While working as a group,\nstudents can use experience and knowledge from their own\ndiscipline to enhance their understanding of the problem and\ncontribute to the development of solutions. Through PBL,\nstudents can also develop cognitive flexibility by learning\nhow to use various knowledge sources for problem solving\nin new contexts. In this regard, PBL is ideally suited for\ncrime and justice issues that need to be approached from an\ninterdisciplinary perspective.\nChallenge and Response in Adopting\nPBL in Criminology and Criminal\nJustice Classroom\nTo reiterate, PBL instructors should adopt the four key ele-\nments of PBL in their course curriculums such as presenting\nill-structured crime and criminal justice problems, promot-\ning student responsibility for learning, acting as a class\nfacilitator in the learning process, and encouraging students\nto use real and authentic problems that are relevant to their\ncareers and lives. Given that PBL is an open-ended, ill-\nstructured teaching strategy, instructors are likely to experi-\nence difficulties in all aspects of PBL instruction: planning,\nimplementing, and assessing (Ertmer & Simons, 2006, n.d.).\nFor scaffolding criminal justice instructors' effort to adopt\nPBL, this article identifies several challenges instructors\nmay face when implementing PBL and provides specific\nsuggestions. To clarify our recommendations, this article\nincorporates evidence and anecdotes not only from the\n6 SAGE Open\nliterature but also from the author's experiences over the\npast many years in implementing PBL classes (i.e.,\nIntroduction to Criminal Justice, Corrections, Criminology,\nDrugs and Crime, and Research Methods).\nChallenge 1: Creating a Collaborative Classroom\nCulture of PBL\nCollaboration is essential in PBL curriculums. According to\nVygotsky (1978), students learn best when they interact with\ntheir peers rather than when they work alone. To promote a\ncooperative classroom culture, various forms of peer learn-\ning were included in my classes: group projects, mini-PBL\nunits, and writing assignments/discussions. First, group proj-\nects are utilized as the stimulus for collaboration among stu-\ndents. Students participate in a group that will be responsible\nfor a group essay and presentation. Students work together to\nidentify problems at the local, state, and national levels and\nto develop relevant solutions. Through the processes of set-\nting a mutual goal and dividing roles and work, students rec-\nognize that their grade is dependent on the performance of\nothers in the group, feel a responsibility to help others learn,\nand finally, build interdependence among them (Ertmer &\nThe second strategy is to use mini-PBL units. According\nto Stepien and Gallagher (1993), the use of \"posthole\" units\nis important in creating a cooperative environment for dis-\ncussion. The term \"postholes\" refers to small problems that\ncan be used as practice for mini-PBLunits (Ertmer & Simons,\n2006). Prior to working on a semester-long PBL project, stu-\ndents have opportunities to work on 1- to 3-day class projects\nregarding controversial topics such as mentally ill prisoners,\npolice corruption, racial profiling, the death penalty, and\novercrowding. While experiencing these mini-PBL units,\nstudents have the opportunity to practice the collaborative\nskills that are needed for the semester group project. In addi-\ntion, students draw on each other's perspectives and skills\nand take interdisciplinary approaches to understand all fac-\ntors involved in finding causes and solutions. For example,\nbeing a psychology minor, one student involved in the group\nwho is interested in the treatment of mentally ill prisoners\nintroduced the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual on Mental\nDisorders to the group and brought helpful insight on how to\ndiagnose individuals with mental disorders.\nClassroom debates are also good strategies to help stu-\ndents learn to work cooperatively (e.g., brainstorming ideas\nor conducting research to support an opinion). For example,\nthere are often controversies among students in the determi-\nnation of group project topics. Through the class debates,\nstudents reach agreement on what are important topics that\nare worthy of attention for their projects, determine what\nthey believe are the main causes for the problems, and finally\ndecide on feasible solutions.\nThird, for individual PBL writing assignments, students\nare required to identify a crime or criminal justice problem\nthey think is worthy of discussion from their readings and\ndevelop solutions that address the problem. In addition, they\npresent their assignments in class and lead a class discussion.\nPBL writing and discussions are driven by free inquiry with\nan instructor's guidance and assist students in developing\ntheir problem-solving skills. While sharing their views and\ndiscussing them with their peers, students also get the oppor-\ntunity to find others who have similar interests and recruit\ntheir partners for the group project. Most importantly, stu-\ndents become familiar with the cooperative environment and\ndevelop collaborative skills.\nAt the beginning of a semester, informal group meetings\nwith students are helpful in promoting collaborative learn-\ning. These meetings allow an instructor to learn students'\ncareer interests and expectations for the course. Students also\nlearn not only the instructor's expectations but other stu-\ndents' backgrounds and interests. It is also useful to have\nmeetings with students in the middle of the semester to deter-\nmine how much progress they are making toward their group\nprojects. Instructors can assess student perceptions and\nacceptance toward PBL implementation and if necessary\nmodify curriculums reflecting their current needs and capac-\nities. Finally, these informal meetings promote positive\nsocial interaction among students and contribute to the cre-\nation of a collaborative learning environment in which stu-\ndents share their experiences and skills.\nChallenge 2: Adjusting to Changing Roles\nIn a collaborative culture, instructors should change both\nhow and what they teach (Grant & Hill, 2006). Successful\nPBL implementation depends on the capacity of instructors\nto change the way they teach students and manage the class\n(Krajcik et al., 1994). In PBL curricula, instructors play the\nrole of a class facilitator rather than assuming the role of a\ndirector (Savery & Duffy, 1995). By developing authentic\ngroup projects, PBL instructors create students' motivation\nfor learning and engage them actively in class. Instructors\nteach students how to learn and how to solve problems,\nrather than simply conveying the information and requiring\nthem to memorize it.\nThere are several strategies to help instructors adjust to\ntheir changing roles as class facilitators. First, the use of ritu-\nals (classroom scripts for specific activities) helps instructors\nmake the transition to becoming effective class facilitators\n(Kolodner et al., 2003). Rituals make instructors feel more\ncomfortable in their roles as facilitators by keeping them\napprised of what practices are scheduled and what project\noutcomes are expected at different times in PBL processes\n(e.g., brainstorming ideas, designing research, defining a\nproblem, locating information, identifying causes, develop-\ning solutions, and preparing a presentation). Second, running\nmini-PBL units provides instructors with opportunities to\npractice facilitating roles and skills (Ertmer & Simons,\n2006). While experiencing these mini-PBL units, instructors\nbecome more comfortable in their facilitating roles in the\nPBL process. Students also can adjust to the PBL approach\nand adopt their new roles as an active learner (Stepien &\nGallagher, 1993). Third, instructors increase the understand-\ning of their facilitative roles in PBL classrooms by observing\nhow experienced PBL instructors manage their classes\n(Ertmer & Simons, 2006). It is important to develop social\nnetworks with other PBL-using instructors who can support\none another in their efforts toward successfully implement-\nIn PBL curriculums, however, students also need to adopt\nnew roles as active learners. Students are not just passive\nrecipients of knowledge from instructors. As active learners,\nthey instead must learn to decide what they learn, which\nresources they use, and how they communicate their solu-\ntions. To promote students'active learning, it is imperative to\nacknowledge their interests and skills and to reflect them in\nclass development (e.g., developing rubrics, inviting guest\nlecturers, having peer evaluations, and so on; Glasgow,\n1997). Students become more responsible for their own\nlearning by becoming involved in planning, implementing,\nand evaluating the class curriculum (Land et al., 2012).\nShifting learning responsibility to the students can pro-\nduce positive learning outcomes. First, students become\nmore motivated to learn on their own. For example, they can\nrelate their learning to their career goals and personal experi-\nences. Students are willing to share their personal experi-\nences involving crime and criminal justice systems as CJ\npractitioners and ex-offenders in classrooms. In addition,\nmany students in prior classes volunteered to invite guest\nlecturers (e.g., judges, probation officers, drug counselors,\ndomestic violence case managers, inmates, and the like) to\nincorporate real-world problems into classroom discussions.\nFor example, one student involved in the group project\n(Drugs and Crime) helped other students understand the\nproblem of drug abuse and the recovery process based on his\nor her firsthand experiences as a drug abuse counselor and\nex-drug addict.\nSecond, by assuming active roles in learning, students\nenhance their skills for self-directed and self-regulated learn-\nTekkaya, 2006). By having choices for exploration, students\nare motivated to initiate research projects, set goals, and\ndevelop planning guidelines to achieve their goals. By ana-\nlytically reflecting their needs for learning and learning how\nto meet those needs, students develop the capacity to manage\nresources, evaluate their progress, and adjust their goals.\nFinally, these self-directed or self-regulated students are\nmore likely to develop critical thinking and problem-solving\nabilities by constantly engaging themselves in CJ problems,\nthinking of ways to practically approach them, and propos-\ning realistic solutions (Brush & Saye, 2001).\nDue to their shifting learning responsibilities, however,\nstudents easily become frustrated or disoriented (Ertmer &\nSimons, 2006). For example, when students identify topics\nfor their PBL projects and assignments, they often encounter\ndifficulties in deciding what is important, interesting, and\nrelevant and in locating resources for learning. Those con-\nfusing frustrations are very intensive to students who are not\nmotivated for learning and who are accustomed to a more\nstructured classroom environment where the instructor\nassigns topics for them to explore.\nAccording to Glasgow (1997), frustration is part of prob-\nlem solving, and solutions rarely come without frustration.\nHe calls this process creative confusion. In PBL curricu-\nlums, the process of dealing with frustrations and difficul-\nties toward completing a group project is as important as the\nactual outcome. The important thing is learning how to deal\nwith frustrations. If they successfully handle these frustra-\ntion situations, students become more motivated to learn\nand also attain desirable outcomes for group projects.\nInstructors should encourage students to research what pre-\nvious research has done or engage in brainstorming with\ngroup members. Instructors can also share previous stu-\ndents' projects to help students understand how to formulate\na problem and how possible topics can be transformed into\nstrong projects.\nIn addition, many students in prior classes attempted to\nfind solutions by visiting the CJ field and interviewing prac-\ntitioners for their group projects and assignments. For the\ngroup project in the institutional corrections course, for\nexample, one group (Women and Drug) was interested in\ncrime and women's issues in the initial stage but had diffi-\nculty narrowing down the research topic and making it more\nmanageable. To overcome this difficulty, the group contacted\nmany governmental and non-governmental agencies in the\ncommunity and asked former instructors. The group\nexchanged many emails with them over the semester. Finally,\nthe members visited the Nebraska Women's Correctional\nCenter (NWCC) to find out the problems women had inside\nthe prison. In collaboration with correctional staff, they were\nable to identify drug use among female inmates and attempted\ntreatment in a women's prison in York, Nebraska. Also, they\ninvited correctional officers and female inmates as guest\nspeakers to present correctional issues in class\nChallenge 3: Identifying the Real-World Problem\nPBLclassesrevolvearoundauthenticproblems(Mergendoller\n& Thomas, 2005). To successfully implement a PBL class, it\nis thus imperative for both students and instructors to iden-\ntify good driving questions that are relevant to students'\ncareer interests, allow students to develop their own investi-\ngations, and promote students'collaboration toward problem\nsolving (Lehman, Ertmer, Keck, & Steele, n.d). In addition,\nstudents should be able to learn significant course materials\nwhile working on these problems (Checkley, 1997; Murray\nThere are several good sources that can be used to identify\ngood driving questions, for example, newspaper mass media,\n8 SAGE Open\nCJ agencies, ex-offenders and inmates, and field trips. First,\ninstructors and students should pay close attention to local\ncrime and justice issues that have appeared in the local news-\npaper and/or on television and capitalize on them for PBL\nprojects and discussion. For example, the author used local\ncrime problems for a criminology class titled \"Why does\nFort Smith in Arkansas have higher violent and property\ncrime rates than the national average and other cities?\"\nAccording to the Uniform Crime Report (UCR) data, in\n2009, the violent and property crime rates in Fort Smith were\ncantly exceed the national averages (for violent crime, 429\ndents). Another question at issue is \"Why does Fort Smith\nhave different historical crime trends compared with U.S.\nnational crime trends?\" Violent and property crime rates in\nFort Smith dramatically increased during the 1990s and\nreached the highest peak during the mid-2000s, while\nnational crime rates substantially decreased and have since\nremained fairly stable.\nStudents were required to discuss as many local socioeco-\nnomic factors as possible causes and develop solutions that\noriginate from the social and economic conditions rather\nthan simply enacting laws and punishing violators.Therefore,\nstudents investigated various statistical indicators, such as\npoverty, inequality, unemployment, immigration, popula-\ntion, divorce rates, drug problems, metal health problems,\nand CJ policies (incarceration rates), and discussed their pos-\nsible effects on changes in crime problems in Fort Smith\nusing various bodies of knowledge from a range of\ndisciplines.\nSecond, to identify crime and justice problems, instruc-\ntors and students can observe, interview, and/or correspond\nwith CJ practitioners and other key informants (e.g., ex-\noffenders, drug users, and inmates). For example, the author\ncontacted the director of the Nebraska Department of\nCorrectional Services and invited its collaboration for stu-\ndents' group projects. The director suggested several topics\nfor group projects and also provided an initial contact with\nwhom students could correspond to have questions answered\nor to obtain information. CJ practitioners provided informa-\ntion and many resources to help students in every aspect of\ntheir group projects. After the semester, the director invited\nthe instructor and students to a meeting of his agency staff to\ndiscuss students' findings and to listen to recommendations.\nDuring these corporative processes, CJ agencies can gain\nnew insights and trends in corrections from students'\nresearch.\nFinally, field visitations can be incorporated into PBL cur-\nriculums. For example, early on in the semester, students\nwere required to participate in institutional tours. Using criti-\ncal and analytical skills, they should observe the correctional\nfacility and interview inmates and practitioners. To supple-\nment these tours and observations, students are required to\nwrite about the institutional tour through the lens of the PBL\nmodel. According to Rockell (2009), it is important to\nreinforce these occasional activities with various individual\nand group assignments to enhance criminal justice students'\ncritical thinking. Through these processes, each student can\nidentify actual criminal justice problems as a stimulus for his\nor her learning experience and link these experiences to\ngroup projects.\nChallenge 4: Locating/Collecting Resources\nAccording to Ertmer and Simons (n.d.), research problems\nshould be feasible and thus must be developed with a consid-\neration of both available resources and students'current abil-\nities. If resources are limited or unavailable, no matter how\nauthentic and relevant the problem is, students cannot suc-\ncessfully complete their projects (Ward & Lee, 2002).\nImplementing PBL classes is more successful when there is\na wide range of resources available to students with their\ngroup projects and assignments.\nAccordingly, instructors should be able to identify the\nbasic resources students will need at each stage of the PBL\nprocess, and thus, it is imperative for instructors to take suf-\nficient time and effort for collaboration with external resource\npeople (e.g., librarians, other faculty, and CJ practitioners).\nFirst, instructors can communicate these needs to their school\nmedia specialist and local librarians, inviting them to their\nclass as guest speakers. They can provide students with\ninformation on how to search for their projects from various\nresources (e.g., Internet, library, journal articles, newspapers,\nmagazines, etc.). Second, given the interdisciplinary nature\nof CJ, it is a good idea for instructors to coordinate with other\nfaculty, especially in other disciplines. Also, instructors can\nprovide students with reading materials (journal articles and/\nor textbooks) from other disciplines. Finally, it is imperative\nthat instructors make a range of community resources avail-\nable to students for their group projects. With the sponsor-\nship of their professor, students can interact with CJ\npractitioners and/or community members for their projects\nwhen they get frustrated trying to identify a problem, locate\nresources, or develop solutions.\nChallenge 5: Developing Assessment Methods\nand Instruments\nIn PBL learning environments emphasizing the importance\nof group work, it is imperative to design appropriate learn-\ning-assessment methods that address both individual and\ngroup accountability (Ertmer & Simons, n.d.). Involving stu-\ndents in evaluating their learning is important rather than\nmerely relying on instructor assessment. It is also valuable to\nincorporate critique from criminal justice agencies if group\nprojects are designed in cooperation with them. Including\nvarious audiences (peer, self, and outsider) can be a strong\nmotivator for students to set higher personal standards for\ntheir projects and improve their work (Glasgow, 1997).\nThrough critiques from various audiences, students can\nappreciate the diversity of one another's perspectives,\ndevelop communication skills, and build positive social\ninteractions among themselves.\nStudents can serve as evaluators in several ways. Students\nwatch other groups' presentations and evaluate others' per-\nformances. There are also confidential peer reviews on the\nperformance of group members in the students' own group\n(including self-evaluation). Each group member evaluates\nhow well his or her group worked together and whether the\nworkload was fairly shared. To facilitate these evaluation\nprocesses, it is important to provide a rubric for peer- and/or\nself-evaluation. According to Mergendoller and Thomas\n(2005), experienced PBL instructors often develop rubrics or\nrating scales in collaboration with students, so that students\ncan promote understanding of their projects and establish\nstandards for quality outcomes.\nIn addition to these product assessments, it is important to\nestablish process assessment in PBL curriculums.According to\nDelisle (1997), \"Assessment of student performance begins the\nfirst day a PBL problem is introduced and lasts until the final\nproduct is reviewed\" (p. 37). Assessment for learning is an\nongoing process and thus needed at all stages of the PBL pro-\ncess. An individual portfolio can be used as a process-\nassessment method. A portfolio refers to the student's collec-\ntion of documents that illustrate his or her works and contribu-\ntions over the course of his or her group project (Glasgow,\n1997). Individual portfolios serve as a great resource for\ninstructors when evaluating students'performances and contri-\nbutions to their group projects during each stage of the PBL\nprocess, which is not always apparent in the final product.\nHowever, individual portfolios also provide students with\nopportunities for self-reflection and assessment. Students\nreflect on their own experiences and evaluate their own per-\nformance and contributions toward the completion of the\ngroup project. In addition, the portfolio plays a role as a self-\nbuilt structure of guidelines and methods for getting things\ndone in an orderly and logical fashion (Glasgow, 1997).\nWhile building their individual portfolios, students remind\nthemselves of what the next step is and evaluate their prog-\nress toward completing the group project. In PBL curricu-\nlums, it is important for students to develop self-directed\nlearning skills (e.g., set their goals, monitor their progress,\nidentify resources, and assess their performance; Brush &\nConclusion\nThis article attempts to introduce PBL methods into crimi-\nnology and criminal justice classrooms for more advanced\nknowledge acquisition. In introductory classes, the goal is\noften more exposure to content and the establishment of a\ngeneral knowledge of crime and criminal justice. Students\nare exposed to many of the subject areas of criminology and\nare expected to memorize and recall the pre-defined content,\nbut they are not likely to learn critical thinking and applica-\ntion skills. In upper-level classes, therefore, the goals and\nmethods of education must change for more advanced\nknowledge acquisition. Students must recognize conceptual\ncomplexity in important aspects of crime and justice prob-\nlems and apply the knowledge obtained from introductory\nclasses to application situations. As reflected in the findings\nof prior studies, while teaching through traditional methods\nis suited for the acquisition of knowledge in introductory\nclasses, PBL is an effective instructional method to foster\nhigher level thinking and problem-solving skills in upper-\nlevel classes.\nIn criminology and criminal justice education, PBL can\noffer many advantages over traditional teaching methods.\nFirst, students take on a research problem as a stimulus for\ntheir learning, identify causes of the problem, and finally\ndevelop solutions. Given multiple sources of problems, stu-\ndents consider multiple perspectives and take an interdisci-\nplinary approach to the studies of crime and criminal justice.\nThey can develop their cognitive flexibility to think holisti-\ncally to see the relevant factors related to the problem of\ninterest and discuss meaningful solutions. Through PBL pro-\ncesses, students learn to think of how to approach and pro-\npose realistic solutions practically to address crime and\njustice problems.\nSecond, by having choices and options for exploration,\nstudents learn to decide what they study, which resources\nthey use, and how they communicate their solutions. They\ncan also make their present learning relevant to future educa-\ntional and/or career needs. This self-determination leads stu-\ndents to take responsibility for their learning and can develop\nthe capacity to reflect their needs and learn to meet those\nneeds. Students become more interested, motivated, and self-\ndirected to learn and actively engage in class activities and\ndiscussions.\nThird, due to the interdisciplinary nature of the subject,\ncriminal justice studies work better through discussion and\ndebate while requiring cooperative learning. For example,\nproblem-based group projects facilitate collaborations and\ninteractions among students as well as between students and\nthe instructor. Students learn how to set short- and long-term\ngoals and to work cooperatively toward addressing the prob-\nlem. Through collaboration, they can also build positive\ninteractions between individuals and develop communica-\ntion and interaction skills, which are essential for criminal\njustice professionals. According to Dewey (1930), education\nin a democratic society should promote criticism, self-\neducation, and constant growth. PBL helps students build\nmany democratic characters in them, such as responsibility\nfor learning, teamwork, communication skills, and respect\nfor others. Finally, although the theoretical argument for the\nadoption of PBL in criminal justice classroom is compelling,\nimplementing PBL is still challenging for instructors. Future\nstudies need to explore various possible formats of PBL in\ncriminology and criminal justice classroom. It is also imper-\native to empirically examine the effectiveness of PBL in\ncriminology education.\nAppendix\nWorksheet for Group Projects\n1.

On the website for the problem-based learning (PBL) Initiative\n(http://www.pbli.org/pbl/generic_pbl.htm), Barrows identifies\nadditional characteristics of PBL and provide in detail expla-\nnation for them.\n2. Problem-oriented policing (POP) is designed to solve under-\nlying problems that give rise to crime while emphasizing the\nimportance of collaboration with many stakeholders (e.g.,\njudges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, community members).\nPOP recommends the use of the Scanning, Analysis, Response\nand Assessment(SARA) model as an analytic approach to\nproblem solving in place of an overreliance on the criminal\nlaw. The SARA model entails four steps: Scanning, Analysis,\nResponse, and Assessment. Police should proactively scan\ntheir areas of responsibility and identify a crime problem by\ndrawing on various data sources. Next, they analyze the prob-\nlem to determine its scope, nature, and underlying causes.\nFollowing the analysis, the police should develop the most\npromising responses that might solve the problem, after con-\nsidering a wide range of alternatives. After implementing\nthese responses, the police should assess them and decide\nwhether the current policy should be replaced, strengthened,\nor improved. For more information, refer to the website for the\nCenter for Problem-Oriented Policing (http://www.popcenter.\norg/).\n3. In A Study of History (1946), Toynbee analyzes the geneses,\ngrowths, breakdowns, and disintegrations of every known\nhuman civilization. He explains how civilizations emerged\nfrom primitive societies and why some flourished and still\nsurvive while others failed. Toynbee discovers a recurring\npattern of \"Challenge and Response\" in the rise and fall of\ncivilizations, which is a law of history. The rise and fall of civi-\nlizations were determined by the responses of human beings\nto difficult challenges rather than biological (race) and envi-\nronmental factors (i.e., military attack and natural disasters).\nIf civilizations responded in a creative manner to challenges,\nthey rose to power and dominance; if not, their civilizations\nbroke down and disintegrated. He emphasizes the importance\nof creative people who have the abilities to find innovative\nsolutions to social challenges.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAlbanese, M.
