Teen mothers tend to have worse socioeconomic outcomes than\nother women who delay childbearing (An, Haveman, and Wolfe 1993; Hofferth and\nHayes 1987). Despite this evidence, it is still unclear whether these negative outcomes\namong teen mothers result from the incidence of childbearing per se or from the\nsocioeconomic disadvantages these women faced before they became teen mothers.\nWhile human capital theory holds that teenage childbearing has a real causal effect on\nsocioeconomic outcomes because it directly interferes with adolescents' investment in\nhuman capital (Becker 1993), the selection view contends that teenage childbearing is\nassociated with negative outcomes because it occurs mostly among disadvantaged\nfemale adolescents (Geronimus, Korenman, and Hillemeier 1994). Indeed, the concern\nabout selection bias points out that isolating the effect of teen motherhood creates a\nconsiderable methodological challenge (Winship and Mare 1992; Winship and Morgan\n1999): If both observed and unobserved preexisting characteristics of teen mothers\naccount for the relationship between teenage childbearing and its socioeconomic\nconsequences, assertions of causality become questionable.\nA large body of research has addressed the selection bias problem by finding better\ncomparison groups for women who give birth in their teens (Cherlin 2001; Hoffman\nwithin-family fixed-effects models compare teen mothers with their sisters who gave\nbirth after their teenage years to control for unobserved family-level heterogeneity\n(Geronimus and Korenman 1992). Quasi-natural experimental approaches approximate\nrandomization procedures by treating twin births or miscarriages as comparison cases\n(Grogger and Bronars 1993; Hotz, McElroy, and Sanders 1997). Finally, instrumental\nvariables methods utilize variables that capture the exogenous component of teenage\nchildbearing to mitigate the selection bias problem (Klepinger, Lundberg, and Plotnick\n1999). Despite their intuitive appeal, all of these models have their own drawbacks. It is\nnot uncommon to find that they are grounded on somewhat strong assumptions and/or\nunrepresentative samples, with mixed results at best. Thus, evaluating the \"true\" effects\nof teenage childbearing remains an elusive goal.\nIn this article, I extend the previous literature in three distinct ways. First, I use a\npropensity score matching approach to identify the early socioeconomic effects of\nteenage childbearing. Following the counterfactual framework (Rosenbaum and Rubin\n1983; Rubin 1977), this approach matches teen mothers (\"treatment\" group) to those\nwho are not teen mothers but similar in all other preexisting observed characteristics\n(\"control\" group), based on a propensity to give birth as teens. Then it compares various\nsocioeconomic outcomes between these two groups using semi-parametric estimators.\nDemographic Research: Volume 23, Article 25\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 699\nSecond, this article addresses selection bias due to both observed and unobserved\ncovariates. Past studies employing the matching approach have focused mainly on\nselection bias due to observed covariates (Chevalier and Viitanen 2003; Levine and\nPainter 2003). Using the Rosenbaum bounds method (Rosenbaum 2002), I evaluate the\nextent to which selection bias on unobserved covariates would nullify propensity score\nmatching estimates of the effects of teenage childbearing.\nThird, I use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add\nHealth), which covers the latest cohort of adolescents who transition into young\nadulthood. This article clearly recognizes that any estimates of the effects of teenage\nchildbearing should be put in context: the U.S. teen birth rate has steadily declined since\nhave increased (Morris and Western 1999); a new welfare policy - Personal\nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Act (PRWORA) - replaced Aid to Families with\nDependent Children (AFDC) with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF);\nand the influx of immigrants, especially Hispanics, has continued to grow. Add Health\nallows reflection upon these recent changes and its large sample size facilitates\nassessing racial/ethnic differences in the socioeconomic consequences of teenage\nchildbearing. Taken together, the counterfactual approach using the Add Health data is\nexpected to provide useful insight into estimating the early socioeconomic effects of\nteen motherhood.\n2. Prior research on the socioeconomic effects of teenage\nchildbearing\n2.1 Causal vs. selection arguments\nHuman capital theory argues that teenage childbearing may have deleterious\nconsequences (Becker 1993). According to this theory, the incidence of early\nchildbearing tends to raise the opportunity costs of accumulation in human capital.\nBeing a teen mother may hinder human capital investment because it is during\nadolescence that one's education is attained. Given the high secondary school dropout\nrates of teen mothers, they are less likely to attain a college degree, which is more\nvalued in labor markets. Teenage motherhood also may keep young women from\nparticipating in the labor force due to the incompatibility between employment and\nchild rearing. Since teenagers are still at an early developmental stage of life, being a\n2 Nonetheless, the teen birth rate in the U.S. has been the highest among the developed countries (Ventura et\nLee: The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing: A propensity score matching approach\n700 http://www.demographic-research.org\nmother as a teen makes it more difficult to take the appropriate economic, social, and\npsychological responsibilities. As a result, teen mothers tend to be more dependent on\nwelfare and trapped in poverty (Furstenberg 1991).\nIn opposition to this conventional view, the selection view maintains that teenage\nchildbearing does not necessarily cause negative consequences for young mothers\n(Geronimus 1991). Because the majority of teen mothers come from impoverished\nfamilies and neighborhoods, simply postponing childbearing may not be sufficient for\ndisadvantaged young women to escape poverty. Moreover, faced with poor conditions\nand bleak prospects, they may have an incentive for early childbearing as an adaptive\nstrategy. Such behavior can be regarded as a culturally rational response to poverty\nbecause childbearing could derive socioeconomic support from extended families and\nneighborhoods (Geronimus, Korenman, and Hillemeier 1994). Since the adverse\nconsequences of teenage childbearing may be an artifact of the preexisting\nsocioeconomic disadvantages of teen mothers, this view underscores substantive\nknowledge about the ways in which teen mothers might systematically differ from other\nyoung women in order to assess the causal effects of teenage childbearing.\n2.2 Previous empirical strategies\nThese two contrasting views invoke the fundamental problem of causal inference about\nthe effects of teenage childbearing: One cannot observe the outcomes of interest\nsimultaneously for a teenager when she is a teen mother (a treated subject) and when\nshe is not (a control subject) (Holland 1986). In an experimental setup, this problem\nmay be solved by randomization through which the treatment group is identical to the\ncontrol group in all characteristics other than the treatment assignment. Any remaining\ndifferences in the outcomes between the two groups, then, are attributable to the causal\neffects of the treatment. In most social scientific studies, however, random assignment\nis not feasible. Teenage childbearing occurs nonrandomly as it is concentrated among\nthe disadvantaged subpopulation. This selection bias problem points out that one should\nestimate the causal effect of teenage childbearing for young women who experienced it\n(average treatment effect for the treated) rather than for young women as a whole\n(average treatment effect) (Dehejia and Wahba 2002; Harding 2003). Therefore, it is\ncrucial to identify a reliable comparison group that does not experience teen\nmotherhood but is similar to teen mothers in preexisting characteristics. A variety of\ninnovative approaches have sought to account for both observed and unobserved\ndifferences between teen mothers and other young women (see Hoffman (1998) for a\nreview). They include within-family fixed-effect models, instrumental variables\nmethods, and quasi-natural experimental approaches.\nDemographic Research: Volume 23, Article 25\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 701\nWithin-family fixed-effect models compare sisters whose childbearing was timed\nat different ages. Since sisters share the same family and neighborhood characteristics,\ncomparing sisters is expected to eliminate unmeasured environmental factors.\nAnalyzing data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women, Geronimus\nand Korenman (1992, 1993) show that cross-sectional studies overstate the correlation\nbetween teenage childbearing and its negative outcomes, and the effects of early\nmotherhood are minimal in most cases. In contrast, Hoffman, Foster, and Furstenberg\nprevious estimates exaggerate the negative effects of teenage childbearing, but these\neffects remain sizable. These conflicting findings bear several substantive concerns\nabout the sister comparison. Within-family fixed-effects models are based on somewhat\nsmall samples of sisters that come from relatively large families, such that external\nvalidity is difficult to adjudicate. Moreover, these models are not very powerful in\ncapturing time-varying individual differences between teen mothers and their sisters. If\nteen mothers have a lower level of achievement than their sisters, a failure to control for\nthis attribute will make the negative effects of teenage childbearing biased upward. On\nthe other hand, the assumption of shared (i.e., fixed) family background factors is\nviolated if parents divert resources away from the non-childbearing sister to the sister\nwho has a birth, biasing the negative effects downward.\nInstrumental variables methods are designed to take the endogeneity of teenage\nchildbearing into account, with attention paid to finding variables that are correlated\nwith teenage childbearing but otherwise unrelated to its socioeconomic outcomes. For\ninstance, age at menarche and various measures regarding abortion have been utilized\nas instrumental variables. Findings are mixed, with some studies showing no effects of\nteenage childbearing (Olsen and Farkas 1989; Ribar 1994) and other studies reporting\nnegative effects (Klepinger, Lundberg, and Plotnick 1999). Although these instrumental\nvariables are validated in a statistical sense, the assumption that they have no relation to\nyoung women's outcomes is difficult to test. Furthermore, the instrumental variables\nmethods are likely to estimate the local average treatment effect (Angrist and Krueger\n2001; Imbens and Angrist 1994) - i.e., an estimate for only a subset of female teenagers\nwho changed their childbearing behavior due to the early initiation of menarche or the\navailability of state abortion facilities.\nQuasi-natural experimental approaches attempt to identify better comparison\ngroups for teen mothers, such as teen mothers who had twin births or pregnant\nadolescents who had miscarriages. These comparison groups may not differ from teen\nmothers in characteristics, because twin births and miscarriages arguably occur\nrandomly. Twin studies show that teenage childbearing has modest but adverse effects\non women's subsequent outcomes for blacks and to a lesser degree, for whites (Grogger\nand Bronars 1993), while miscarriage studies find that most of the negative effects of\nLee: The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing: A propensity score matching approach\n702 http://www.demographic-research.org\nteenage childbearing are short-lived and its effects become positive when teen mothers\nfindings from both studies need to be cautiously interpreted because twin births and\nmiscarriages are rare events. Also, teen mothers with twins might benefit from\neconomies of scale compared with teen mothers with one child, resulting in an\nunderestimation of the effects of teenage childbearing (Hoffman 1998). Similarly,\nmiscarriage studies would produce biased estimates to the extent that the occurrence of\nmiscarriages is underreported, or miscarriages are correlated with unobserved\ncommunity-level factors (Fletcher and Wolfe 2009).\n3. A counterfactual approach: Propensity score matching with\nRosenbaum bounds\n3.1 A propensity score matching framework\nIn the spirit of the counterfactual analysis with observational data, this study takes a\npropensity score matching approach (Morgan and Winship 2007). One could imagine\nthat two young women are matched on the same preexisting observed characteristics,\none of whom is a teen mother and the other is not. Each unit of observation could be\nstratified into subgroups according to a specific value of covariates. However, as more\ncovariates are needed to ensure the determinants of teenage childbearing, there should\nbe an increasing number of cells that contain no comparison unit. Rosenbaum and\nRubin (1983) suggest that propensity score matching greatly reduces the high\ndimensionality of the observed covariates by constructing a propensity score, the\nprobability of receiving treatment assignment. If the true propensity score is known, a\npair of the treatment and the matched control groups would, in expectation, be balanced\non both observed and unobserved preexisting characteristics. Since this is improbable in\npractice, the predicted probabilities of receiving treatment assignment calculated from a\nlogit (or probit) model serve as the estimated propensity scores to match the treatment\nand control groups based on preexisting observed covariates.\nThe analysis takes this approach as follows. First, it estimates a logit model to\ncalculate the predicted probabilities of teen motherhood, which are used as the\npropensity scores. In this model, all observed covariates are measured prior to\noccurrence of teenage childbearing. Drawing on previous literature, I carefully select\nsociodemographic-, individual-, school-, and neighborhood-level determinants of\nteenage childbearing status (see section 4, Data and measures).\nSecond, using the propensity scores, it generates a sample consisting of teen\nmothers and their matched cases. Among young women who are not teen mothers, the\nDemographic Research: Volume 23, Article 25\nmatched cases include only those who are close enough to teen mothers in terms of the\npropensity scores.3 Among a variety of matching algorithms, I consider single-nearest-\nneighbor caliper matching with replacement (Morgan and Harding 2006).4 The caliper\nsize set in the analysis is .01, which restricts matches to have differences in the\npropensity scores within one percentage point.\nThird, it examines whether teen mothers and their matched counterparts are\nbalanced on observed covariates. I test whether the logit model from which the\npropensity scores are calculated achieves a significant reduction in absolute bias - the\nstandardized percentage mean difference in each covariate between the treatment and\ncontrol groups.5 If this propensity score estimation model is well specified, there should\nbe little difference in preexisting observed covariates between these two groups.\nFinally, it assesses differences in the socioeconomic outcomes between teen\nmothers and their matched counterparts. To minimize reverse causality, all outcome\nvariables are measured after teen birth. For the purpose of comparison, I also present\nstandard regression estimates of the effects of teenage childbearing.\nIn fact, the propensity matching approach would produce similar estimates to those\nfrom regression-based models if these models met all of the prerequisite assumptions\nand had well-supported data. However, when these conditions cannot be satisfied, the\npropensity score matching method has clear advantages over parametric approaches.\nFirst, it avoids serious mismatches between those who gave birth as teens and those\nwho were least likely to do so, by matching only similar cases. Standard regression\nmethods are likely to retain these mismatches, producing unrealistic average treatment\neffect. Second, the propensity score matching method is semi-parametric with no\nassumption of functional forms for the relationship between the treatment variable and\nthe outcomes of interest. Standard regression methods should assume a specific\nfunctional form that results in extrapolation and smoothing, which are prone to biases\ndue to serious mismatches.6 Third, the propensity score matching estimators are known\nto be more efficient and free from collinearity because only the estimated propensity\nscores are required.\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 703\n3 One might think that the control group should contain only young women who gave birth after their teenage\nyears. However, this may cause the simultaneity problem, by which outcomes affect the control group's\nchildbearing status.\n4 Switching the matching algorithms does not alter the findings reported here (the results are available upon\nrequest from the author).\n5 The absolute bias is calculated as a percentage of the mean difference divided by the average standard\ndeviation for the two groups:\n.\n/\n)\n(\n)\n(\nBias\nC\ns\nT\ns\nC\nx\nT\nx +\n-\n=\n6 On the other hand, the propensity score matching method should make an assumption about the functional\nform of the model predicting teenage childbearing status, which standard regression methods do not need to\nmake. However, as Harding (2003) suggests, this assumption can be verified by assessing whether the\nmatching procedure achieves covariate balance.\nLee: The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing: A propensity score matching approach\n704 http://www.demographic-research.org\nIt should be noted that in the propensity score matching procedure, a certain\nportion of teen mothers still may not have their counterfactuals in the matched sample if\ntheir propensity scores are too high to find their matches in the comparison group. This\ncommon support problem implies that if so, one can only estimate the causal effects of\nteenage childbearing for the subset of the treated group (Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd\n1998). I address this issue by evaluating how well the treated group overlaps with the\ncontrol group by way of the propensity score matching procedure. In addition, like\nconventional regression analysis, the propensity score matching method assumes no\nselection bias on unobserved covariates, which posits that conditional on preexisting\nobserved covariates, teenage childbearing is independent of the outcome of interest\n(Rubin 1977). However, the matching framework used here can evaluate this ignorable\ntreatment assignment assumption by incorporating a sensitivity analysis that examines\nhow large the selection bias problem would need to be to completely wipe out\npropensity score matching estimates of the effect of teenage childbearing. I demonstrate\nbelow how the sensitivity analysis can be employed in the matching framework.\n3.2 A sensitivity analysis: Use of Rosenbaum bounds\nThe counterfactual analysis of teenage childbearing may be sensitive to \"hidden bias\"\ndue to preexisting unobserved characteristics that influence both teenage childbearing\nstatus and its outcomes, even if this approach achieves a balance between teen mothers\nand their matched counterparts in terms of preexisting observed characteristics.\nPrevious studies using propensity score matching do not fully account for this\npossibility (Chevalier and Viitanen 2003; Levine and Painter 2003). For example, a\nresearcher might not know how families decide where to live. If this decision-making\nprocess matters both for the incidence of teenage childbearing and for its outcomes, the\ntrue effects of early motherhood will not be estimated correctly. The sensitivity analysis\ndeveloped by Rosenbaum (2002) addresses the strength of such an unobserved variable\nto evaluate the causal effects estimated from propensity score matching (see Appendix\nA for a formal notation).\nSuppose that a confounding unobserved covariate, U, exists that affects the odds of\nbeing assigned to the treatment, T, conditional on observed covariates, X. If U has\nnothing to do with T, then the assignment process is regarded as random. But as the\ninfluence of U on T becomes stronger, the confidence interval on the estimated effect of\nT becomes wider, and the significance level of the test of the null hypothesis of no\neffect of T on the outcome increases (i.e., the p-value goes up). In this scenario, one\ngauges the end points on the bounds for the significance level of the test of the null\nhypothesis for each assumed level of association between U and T. This enables one to\nDemographic Research: Volume 23, Article 25\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 705\nfind the case where the effect of U on the outcome is so strong that knowledge about U\nwould almost perfectly predict the level of the outcome, whether or not a unit of\nobservation received treatment assignment. In this regard, while not calibrating the\nexact size of the true effect of teenage childbearing in the presence of unobserved\nheterogeneity, the Rosenbaum bounds method provides a basis for assessing the\nselection bias problem by making explicit the extent to which the ignorable treatment\nassignment assumption underlying the propensity score matching is vulnerable (DiPrete\nA key feature of this method is to allow a researcher to benchmark the strength of\nunobserved confounding variable against that of observed variables, because many of\nthe determinants of teenage childbearing have been identified in the literature. For\ninstance, family structure is known to have a powerful effect on early motherhood and\nits outcomes (Wu and Martinson 1993). By comparing the magnitude of hidden bias\nwith that of the known observed covariates, we can examine the strength of selection\nbias due to unobserved covariate required to alter the causal inference about the effects\nof teenage childbearing.\n4. Data and measures\nThis study uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add\nHealth). Add Health is a nationally representative, multistage, stratified, school-based,\nIn-school questionnaire was administered to more than 90,000 adolescents who\nattended the sampled schools on a particular day during the period of September 1994\nto April 1995. Based on the school rosters, a random sample of about 200 students from\neach high school and feeder school pair was collected between April and December\nover-samples that included racial/ethnic minorities, physically disabled adolescents, and\na genetic sample, the Wave I data produced a total sample size of 20,745 adolescents,\ninterviewed in Wave III to investigate the influences that experiences in adolescence\nhave on young adulthood.7\n7 The age range at Wave III is from 18 to 27 with the average age of 22. That the data consist of young adults\nimplies that despite the strong correlations between early and late socioeconomic behaviors, the results\nreported here refer to the early socioeconomic effects of teen motherhood.\nLee: The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing: A propensity score matching approach\n706 http://www.demographic-research.org\nIt appears that Add Health may not be representative of all adolescents because it\nuses a school-based design and misses high school dropouts in the In-school survey. As\nUdry and Chantala (2003) demonstrate, however, annual dropout rates are very low at\nthe national level; the In-home sample was selected from the school rosters, which were\ncollected approximately a year before the Wave I In-home interviews, so the only\ndropouts missed are those who dropped out of school two years prior to the Wave I In-\nhome interviews. Indeed, a preliminary analysis (not shown) indicates that\nsociodemographic characteristics differ little by age. While missing dropouts remains a\nconcern, it does not seem to alter the results reported here.\nBecause of its strong emphasis on social contexts and its broad definition of\nhealth-related behaviors, Add Health provides valuable information well suited for this\nstudy. First, the Wave III sample contains detailed data on fertility, educational\nattainment, labor market performance, and public assistance receipt. Second, the Wave\nI sample provides a rich set of variables that are measured prior to the incidence of\nteenage childbearing.8 It also contains variables that are previously unmeasured but\nconsidered key factors of teenage childbearing and various socioeconomic outcomes.\nFor example, recent evidence shows that personality traits such as locus of control and\nself-esteem play an important role in teenage childbearing and subsequent outcomes\nFinally, Add Health allows an up-to-date assessment of the effects of teenage\nchildbearing. Timeliness is an important issue given significant contextual changes\neducation, changes in welfare policy, and the increase of Hispanics in the U.S.\nadolescent population, all of which could have influences on adolescents' fertility\nbehavior. This study does not address the direct impacts of these social changes on the\nassociation between teenage childbearing and its outcomes, but does discuss the\nimplications of the recent contextual changes and analyzes race/ethnicity-specific\nsamples alongside the whole sample.\nThe analytic sample consists of 6,825 adolescent females who were interviewed at\nWaves I and III and who had observations on teenage childbearing status, the dependent\nand explanatory variables of interest, and sampling weights. A preliminary analysis\nsuggests that there is little difference between the analytic sample and the sample before\nlistwise deletion. To account for the sampling design effects in Add Health, all analyses\nadjust standard errors for school-level clustering.\n8 There were older teenagers at risk for giving birth prior to Wave I. Since all covariates come from Wave I,\nthis might cause reverse causality between teenage childbearing and some of the covariates. I reestimated all\nmodels presented here with and without those who became mothers by Wave I. In addition, all of these\nmodels were reanalyzed by limiting the analytic sample to adolescents who did not give birth and were\nyounger than age 16 at Wave I. The results in both cases (available upon request from the author) do not alter\nthe findings shown here.\nDemographic Research: Volume 23, Article 25\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 707\nEducational Attainment: Two measures of educational attainment come from the Wave\nIII data: dropping out of high school and attending or graduating from some college (2\nyear or more). I treat GED recipients as high school graduates. Since there is little\nconsensus on whether GED recipients are considered high school dropouts or graduates\nMcCarthy 1990), I reestimated the analyses to treat GED recipients as high school\ndropouts. Also, I used attending or graduating from college (4 year or more) instead of\nsome college for another robustness check. The results (not shown) are similar to those\npresented below.\nLabor Market Outcomes: Employment status, work-related activities, full-\ntime/part-time status, and weekly wages are obtained from the Wave III data. Work-\nrelated activities include on-the-job-training as well as employment status. Weekly\nwages below the 3rd percentile in the wage distribution are set equal to the 3rd\npercentile, and weekly wages above the 97th percentile are set equal to the 97th\npercentile. Log-transformed weekly wages are used for analyses. Since there are\nrespondents who still were enrolled in post-secondary schools at Wave III, I restrict the\nsamples to respondents not in schools. I further restrict the samples to respondents who\nwere employed at Wave III for full-time/part-time status and those who worked full-\ntime for weekly wages.\nPublic Assistance Receipt: This variable identifies whether respondents were on\nwelfare at Wave III and ever on welfare. A respondent is identified as welfare-\ndependent if she received AFDC (or TANF), public assistance, welfare payments, or\nfood stamps.\nTeenage Childbearing: Teenage childbearing status is constructed from the Add Health\nlife history calendar and household roster of the Wave III sample. A young woman is\ntreated as a teen mother if she gave birth prior to age 20, given the prolongation of the\nstages of adolescence that has been observed over the last few decades in the United\nStates (Rindfuss 1991). I do not differentiate teen mothers' marital status at the time of\nchildbearing, but the results reported here do not change when married teen mothers are\nexcluded from the analytic sample.\nLee: The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing: A propensity score matching approach\n708 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic and Family Characteristics: Demographic characteristics measured\nat Wave I include age, race/ethnicity, and immigrant generation status. Race/ethnicity is\nclassified as non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and Asians.\nImmigrant generation status is defined as 1st generation if a respondent is foreign-born\nto foreign-born parents, 2nd generation if she is U.S.-born to foreign-born parents, and\n3rd or higher generation if she is U.S.-born to U.S.-born parents. Family background\nconstructed from the Wave I parental survey covers family structure, parental\neducation, and number of siblings. Family structure is categorized as two-biological\nparent families, two-parent step families, single-mother families, single-father families,\nand other families (e.g., foster families). Parental education is measured with the\nhighest level of education either of the parents obtained and categorized as less than\nhigh school, high school, some college, and college or more, with a missing indicator\non parental education.\nIndividual Characteristics: Parental monitoring, cognitive skills and personality\ntraits, religiosity, and risk behaviors are constructed from the Wave I sample. Parental\nmonitoring is measured by the total count of activities monitored by parents, such as\ncurfews, friendships, TV watching, and food and dress choices. For measures of\ncognitive skills, I use the Add Health Picture Vocabulary Test (AHPVT) and grade\npoint average (GPA). AHPVT is an abbreviated version of the Peabody Picture\nVocabulary Test with age-standardized scores for adolescents. I retain the missing cases\non AHPVT by assigning them to the sample mean value and including a missing\nindicator in the analysis. For a measure of personality traits, I utilize 9 items from the\nRotter's locus of control scale or from the Rosenberg's self-esteem scale.9 Based on\nthese items, I construct a composite measure of personality traits with 4-point Likert\nscale ( = .67). Religiosity is a composite measure with 4-point Likert scale ( = .86) of\nattendance to religious services (from once a week or more to never), the importance of\nreligion (from very important to not important at all), and the frequency of prayer (from\nat least once a day to never). Risk behaviors are measured with the questions of whether\na respondent smoked regularly and how many days per month a respondent drank\nalcohol during the past 12 months.\n9 Locus of control measures the degree of control individuals feel. According to Rotter (1966), individuals\nwho believe that outcomes are due to luck have an external locus of control while individuals who believe\nthat outcomes are due to their own efforts have an internal locus of control. Self-esteem measures perceptions\nDemographic Research: Volume 23, Article 25\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 709\nSchool and Neighborhood Characteristics: 10 School facilitates interactions of\nadolescents with teachers and peers by way of providing role models and developing\nadaptive strategies. I focus on measures of collective socialization (Coleman 1990).\nThese include 1) the school's structural characteristics, such as the percentage of white\nstudents in school, school type (private/public), and school region; and 2) school\nclimate, such as school-level expectations of going to college and earning a middle-\nclass income by age 30. Also, socioeconomic conditions of neighborhood may define\nan individual's opportunity structure and the normative climate during adolescence and\nsubsequently affect their future outcomes (Massey and Denton 1993; Wilson 1987).\nSeveral census tract-level measures are constructed including urbanity, the percent idle,\ndefined as the percentage of young people who were neither at work nor in school, and\ntotal unemployment rate.\n5. Results\n5.1. Preliminary results\nTable 1 presents descriptive statistics by teenage childbearing status. There are 1,266\nIt shows statistically significant mean differences between these two groups in a\nnumber of preexisting observed characteristics. Compared to their counterparts, teen\nmothers were more likely to be black or Hispanic, more likely to come from the 3rd+\ngeneration, less likely to reside with two-biological parents, and less likely to have\nparents with college diploma(s). Teen mothers also scored lower on cognitive skills and\npersonality traits and were more likely to smoke and drink alcohol than those who are\nnot teen mothers. The schools that teen mothers attended had more minorities, were\nmore likely to be public, had lower levels of group expectations of going to college and\nearning a middle-class income, and were more likely to be in the South than the schools\nthat their counterparts attended. Lastly, teen mothers were more likely than their\ncounterparts to reside in neighborhoods with higher percentages of the idle and total\nunemployment.\n10 As mentioned earlier, clustering allows adjusting standard errors for these contextual-level coefficients.\nSince this analysis is not interested in modeling the variance between contexts, hierarchical linear modeling is\nnot necessary.\nLee: The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing: A propensity score matching approach\n710 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 1: Descriptive statistics by teenage childbearing status: Full sample\nAll women Teen mothers Not teen mothers\nVariable Mean S.E.

Table 2 shows that compared to other young\nwomen, teen mothers tend to come from socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.\nTeen mothers are statistically different from their counterparts at the .05 level in terms\nof almost all preexisting observed covariates. These differences raise a critical question\nabout finding a better comparison group for teen mothers to estimate the causal effects\nof teenage childbearing. Figure 1 compares teen mothers and their counterparts in the\nfull sample by the predicted probabilities of teenage childbearing obtained from the\nlogit model in Table 2. Clearly, there is much discrepancy between the two groups:\nserious mismatches exist in the region where a predicted probability to give teen birth is\nhigher. Recall that standard regression methods should impose strong assumptions to\ncontrol for potential biases resulting from those mismatches. Propensity score matching\nestimates will show to what degree regression-based estimates could produce bias in\nthis respect.\nLee: The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing: A propensity score matching approach\n712 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 2: Odd ratios from logit model predicting teenage childbearing status\nCoefficient S.E.\nDemographic and family characteristics\nWhite (reference)\nImmigrant generation:\n3rd+ (reference)\nTwo-biological parent family\n(reference)\nParental education:\nCollege graduate (reference)\nIndividual characteristics\nSchool characteristics\nPercent expectations:\nDemographic Research: Volume 23, Article 25\nTable 2: (Continued)\nCoefficient S.E.\nNortheast (reference)\nNeighborhood characteristics\nNotes: Missing indicators for parental education and Add Health PVT score are included but not shown; Robust standard errors\nadjusting school-level clustering in parentheses.\nFigure 1: Predicted probability of teenage childbearing: Full sample\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 713\nLee: The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing: A propensity score matching approach\n5.2. Matching results\nI construct a matched sample based on the estimated propensity scores of teenage\nwomen who are not teen mothers but whose propensity scores are sufficiently close to\nthose of teen mothers. Figure 2 depicts the degree to which teen mothers and their\nmatched counterparts overlap with each other. Strikingly, these two groups are well\nmatched, indicating that there is little difference in the preexisting observed\nFigure 2: Predicted probability of teenage childbearing: Matched sample\n11 In Appendix B, Table B gives an additional snapshot of the covariate balance check. None of the\npreexisting covariates bears statistical differences in means between teen mothers and their matched\ncounterparts; the matched sample also achieves a significant percentage reduction in absolute bias. Although\nthree variables - father only family, parents with some college education, and Midwest - show an increase in\nmothers and those who are not teen mothers before as well as after matching. Using the outcome-specific\nmatched samples produces almost the same pattern of overlapping and covariate balance between these two\ngroups (not shown).\n714 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 23, Article 25\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 715\nTable 3 presents propensity score matching results of the socioeconomic effects of\nteenage childbearing. The first and second columns of each panel report the standard\nregression and propensity score matching estimates, respectively, for each outcome.\nThe regression estimates are obtained from logit or OLS models using the full sample,\nincluding teenage childbearing status and all covariates in Table 2 as the explanatory\nvariables. They are expressed as the simulated predicted probabilities or values\ncomputed by averaging each respondent's value on all covariates except for teenage\nchildbearing status. The matching estimates are the simple mean probabilities or values\nof each outcome in the matched sample. To make these two estimates comparable, the\nratios between the treatment and control groups for each outcome are presented in the\nfourth rows of each panel.\nAs presented in the last rows of each panel, all outcome-specific matched samples\nhave strong common support, ranging from 99.4% to 99.8%. This indicates that the\npropensity score matching method succeeds in locating almost all young women who\nare not teen mothers but share similar preexisting observed characteristics with teen\nmothers.\nTable 3: Propensity score matching estimates of the effects of teenage\nchildbearing\nRegression Matching Regression Matching\nEstimates Estimates Estimates Estimates\nA.

This propensity score\nDemographic Research: Volume 23, Article 25\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 717\nmatching estimate is less than a fourth of the logit estimate (=9.455) but still\nstatistically significant. Panel A2 shows that teen mothers are about 40% less likely to\nattend or graduate from some college than their matched counterparts (1\u00ad.606=.394),\nwhich is an estimate that is much smaller than the logit estimate but remains\nstatistically significant.\nFor labor market outcomes, the matching estimates also find the statistically\nsignificant negative effects of teenage childbearing, although the magnitudes of its\neffects are reduced compared to the logit estimates. Panels B1 through B4 show that\ncompared to their matched counterparts, teen mothers are about 15% less likely to be\nemployed, about 12% less likely to participate in work-related activities, and about 10%\nless likely to work full-time. The logit estimates for each labor market outcome are\nabout 25%, 18%, and 10%, respectively. Weekly wages do not differ between teen\nmothers and their matched control group, but it should be noted that the analytic sample\nconsists only of those who worked full-time, implying that this sample includes a select\ngroup of teen mothers.\nThe matching estimates presented in Panels C1 and C2 suggest that teen mothers\nare more likely than their matched counterparts to receive public assistance. While\nthese estimates are far smaller than the logit estimates, teen mothers are still about 2.6\ntimes and 3.5 times more likely to be currently and ever on welfare, respectively.\nOverall, the propensity score matching results show that traditional regression\nmethods tend to overestimate the negative effects of teen motherhood. Teen mothers'\nlower levels of educational and labor market performance and higher likelihood of\nreceiving public assistance result nontrivially from their preexisting disadvantages; and\nyet, there remain significant differences between teen mothers and their matched\ncounterparts in the key domains of early socioeconomic outcomes. What is worth\nmentioning is that teen motherhood has relatively smaller effects on early labor market\noutcomes than on educational attainment and public assistance receipt. This result is not\nsurprising, because the analytic samples for the labor market outcomes include a select\ngroup of teen mothers while excluding other young women enrolled in post-secondary\nschools, a group that has better economic potential. The matching results, therefore,\nsuggest that even faced with the similarly adverse conditions when growing up, young\nwomen who are not teen mothers fare better than teen mothers.12\nHowever, the matching estimates reported here do not take into account selection\nbias on unobserved preexisting characteristics, which may produce upwardly biased\nestimates. A contribution of this article is to conduct a sensitivity analysis using the\n12 I reestimated the propensity score matching model where a young woman is treated as a teen mother if she\ngave birth prior to age 18 rather than 20 (see Appendix C). It does not alter the findings reported here, with\nthe exception that the effects of teenage childbearing on the labor market outcomes become a little weaker.\nLee: The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing: A propensity score matching approach\n718 http://www.demographic-research.org\nRosenbaum bounds method to address the role of unobserved heterogeneity in drawing\na causal inference about teen motherhood and its socioeconomic consequences.\n5.3 Results from the sensitivity analysis\nTable 4 presents the Rosenbaum bounds for the causal effects of teenage childbearing.\n is the Rosenbaum bounds estimate of the magnitude of selection bias on unobserved\ncovariate - hidden bias - that would predict teenage childbearing status, expressed as an\nodds ratio (OR). p-critical denotes the p-value at which a matching estimate becomes\ninsignificant corresponding to the given magnitude of hidden bias. To give a\nsubstantive interpretation of the Rosenbaum bounds, I compare the magnitude of hidden\nbias () to that of its known equivalents. For example, parental decision-making on\nresidence may be considered an important unmeasured factor of the relationship\nbetween teen motherhood and subsequent outcomes. One could argue that parental\npreference for middle-class neighborhood has a negative effect on daughters' teenage\nchildbearing and positive effects on their socioeconomic outcomes, because it signifies\nlevels of parental investment in their children. If a researcher takes such family-level\nresidential decision-making processes into account, the effects of teenage childbearing\nmay disappear. Recall that consistent with previous research, the logit estimates from\nTable 2 confirm race/ethnicity, family structure, and parental education as among the\nstrongest predictors of teenage childbearing status (Wu and Martinson 1993; Wu and\nWolfe 2001). Then the question is how large the effect of parental residential preference\nshould be to nullify the propensity score matching estimates, compared to that of these\nknown characteristics.\nTable 4: A sensitivity analysis using the Rosenbaum bounds of the causal\neffects of teenage childbearing\n p-critical\nA. Educational Attainment\nDemographic Research: Volume 23, Article 25\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 719\nTable 4: (Continued)\n p-critical\nB. Labor Market Outcomes\nC. Public Assistance Receipt\nNotes:  is the odds ratio of differential treatment assignment due to an unobserved covariate; p-critical from the Wilcoxon signed\nrank tests.\nFirst, Panel A reports that as  approaches 1.9, the effect of teen motherhood on\ndropping out of high school becomes statistically insignificant at the .05 level (p-critical\nis .057). This means that in order to challenge the significance of the matching estimate,\nan unobserved covariate should cause the odds ratio of teen motherhood to differ\nbetween teen mothers and their matched counterparts by a factor of 1.9. A selection bias\nwith such magnitude is larger than or comparable to the estimated net effect of living in\na step (OR=1.697) or a single mother (OR=1.460) family instead of a two-biological\nparent family, or having parents with a high school (OR=1.800) or some college\nLee: The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing: A propensity score matching approach\n720 http://www.demographic-research.org\n(OR=1.616) education instead of a college diploma. To drive the effect of teenage\nchildbearing on dropping out of high school to statistical insignificance, the effect of\nparental residential preference should be stronger than these effects even after\ncontrolling for all preexisting covariates included in Table 2.\nWith regard to attending or graduating from some college, the Rosenbaum bounds\nstatistics indicates that  should be at least 2.0 (p-critical is .110) to completely alter the\neffect of teenage childbearing. The effect of parental residential preference should be\nlarger than or comparable to the estimated net effect of being non-Hispanic black\n(OR=1.886) or Hispanic (OR=1.986) instead of being non-Hispanic white, living in\nanother family structure instead of a two-biological parent family (OR=1.915), or\nhaving parents with less than high school diplomas instead of college diplomas\nSecond, the causal effects of teenage childbearing on labor market outcomes\nappear to be somewhat vulnerable to unobserved confounder, compared to educational\nattainment. Panel B suggests that to nullify the effects of teen motherhood on\nemployment status, work-related activities, and full-time/part-time status, the critical\nrespectively. The effect of teenage childbearing on weekly wages is highly vulnerable\nto hidden bias, which is consistent with the matching result shown in Table 3 that finds\nno effect. As Diprete and Gangl (2004) have pointed out, however, these results are\nworst-case scenarios. Unless family-level residential preference had a powerful effect\non both teen motherhood and the outcomes, the effect of teenage childbearing on some\nof the labor market outcomes would remain significant.\nLastly, the Rosenbaum bounds for public assistance receipt (Panel C) imply that \nto wipe out the matching estimates of the effects of teen motherhood on being currently\nand ever on welfare. Because these magnitudes are much larger than any of the effects\nof race/ethnicity, family structure, and parental education estimated from Table 2, the\neffect of an unobserved covariate needs to be very powerful.\nIn summary, the sensitivity analysis using the Rosenbaum bounds shows that\nselection bias due to unobserved covariates would have to be substantial to completely\neliminate the matching estimates of the effects of teenage childbearing on most of the\nearly socioeconomic outcomes considered in this analysis. This result also suggests that\nsince the magnitude of this sort of bias is interpreted in comparison to that of already\nknown family background factors, one should not rule out the possibility that\nunobserved heterogeneity may underlie the relationship between teen motherhood and\nits socioeconomic consequences.\nDemographic Research: Volume 23, Article 25\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 721\n5.4 Racial/ethnic differences\nGiven recent changes in the U.S. racial/ethnic composition (e.g., the increase of\nHispanics) and the conflicting findings regarding the effects of teenage childbearing by\nrace/ethnicity, an examination of racial/ethnic differences deserves attention.13 Table 5\nreports the propensity score matching estimates among non-Hispanic whites, non-\nHispanic blacks, and Hispanics. For non-Hispanic whites, the matching estimates show\nthat teen motherhood has negative effects on educational attainment, employment\nstatus, work-related activities, and public assistance receipt, but not on full-time/part-\ntime status and weekly wages. The Rosenbaum bounds suggest that the effects of teen\nmotherhood on public assistance receipt and to a lesser degree, educational attainment\nare most robust to unobserved heterogeneity, compared to employment status and work-\nrelated activities. For non-Hispanic blacks, teen motherhood has adverse consequences\non educational attainment, employment status, and public assistance receipt. For\nHispanics, teen motherhood has negative effects on educational attainment and public\nassistance receipt. Although its effects on employment status and work-related activities\nare not significant, they differ significantly from those for non-Hispanic whites and\nblacks.\nTable 5: Propensity score matching estimates of the effects of teenage\nchildbearing, by race/ethnicity\nWhite Black Hispanic\nA. Educational attainment\n13 Grogger and Bronars (1993) report that most of the adverse consequences of teen motherhood are amplified\namong blacks, whereas Klepinger, Lundberg, and Plotnick (1999) find that the negative effects of teen\nmotherhood are present for both whites and blacks.\nLee: The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing: A propensity score matching approach\n722 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 5: (Continued)\nWhite Black Hispanic\nB.

Insofar as labor market performance is concerned,\nthe findings from Hispanic teen mothers seem in favor of the selection view\n(Geronimus, Korenman, and Hillemeier 1994). Alternatively, given a large number of\nrespondents who were enrolled in post-secondary schools at Wave III (about 41% for\nnon-Hispanic whites, 42% for non-Hispanic blacks, and 38% for Hispanics), the effects\nof teenage childbearing on the labor market outcomes might be restored if these\nrespondents entered the labor market upon graduation. Since the economic returns to\ndifference in education attainment between teen mothers and their matched counterparts\nmay be carried over into the labor market across all racial/ethnic groups. New data that\ncontain older age groups would help determine which interpretation can be\nsubstantiated.\n6. Discussion and conclusion\nStudies of teenage childbearing and its socioeconomic consequences have been\nconcerned about possible omitted variables and selection biases that are critical to\nestimate the \"true\" effect of teenage childbearing. The propensity score matching\nanalysis used in this article is designed to shed new light into this line of research by 1)\nfinding a better comparison group to teen mothers with less dependence on statistical\nassumptions than standard regression approaches and a larger sample size; 2)\nemploying the Rosenbaum bounds method to assess the significance level of the\nmatching estimates of the effects of teenage childbearing in the presence of selection\nbias on unobserved covariates; and 3) providing the most up-to-date assessment of the\nearly socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing with the Add Health data.\nAs in most of the previous studies taking alternative approaches, the propensity\nscore matching results show that socioeconomic disadvantages inherent to teen mothers\naccount for a nontrivial portion of the effects of teen motherhood, suggesting that the\nselection bias problem results in an overestimation of its negative effects. However,\nwhen teen mothers are compared to their matched counterparts who are similar in every\nobserved preexisting characteristic except for teenage childbearing status, teen\nmotherhood still has modest but significant negative effects on various early\nsocioeconomic outcomes. The sensitivity analysis employing the Rosenbaum bounds\nmethod suggests that selection bias on unobserved covariates would have to be large to\nalter these propensity score matching estimates. These findings are consistent with\nsome of the earlier studies using within-family fixed-effects models (Hoffman, Foster,\nLee: The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing: A propensity score matching approach\n724 http://www.demographic-research.org\n(Klepinger, Lundberg, and Plotnick 1999), and quasi-natural experimental approaches\nfindings points out that identifying a more reliable comparison group to teen mothers\nthrough flexible modeling assumptions and well-supported data should be given a\npriority.\nSeveral limitations of this study warrant mention. First, one should recognize that\nthe propensity score matching analysis combined with the Rosenbaum bounds method\nis not a solution to resolve all complex issues regarding unobserved heterogeneity;\nrather, it need be understood as an effort to make the causal inference about teenage\nchildbearing more constructive. Second, given the nature of the data, this study speaks\nto the effects of teenage childbearing on young adults. Some studies using miscarriages\nas a source of quasi-natural experiment report that teen mothers fare better in their late\nlong-term consequences, therefore, remains an important topic for future research.\nThird, it is likely that structural changes influence the association between teenage\nchildbearing and subsequent outcomes, but this study is only suggestive of the potential\nroles of the growing economic returns to education. Research on adolescent fertility can\nbenefit from more comprehensive knowledge about teen mothers' life experiences, new\ndata with older age groups, and cohort data linking teenage childbearing to macro-level\nsocial changes.\n7.
