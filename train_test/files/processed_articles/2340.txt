In its risk assessment and\nsubsequent analyses, the California EPA estimated that health\neffects in children nationwide include over 200,000 episodes\nof childhood asthma per year (new cases and exacerbations);\nother adverse effects (California EPA, 1997).\nAlthough these studies clearly indicate that the public\nhealth burden of ETS exposure is substantial, the health risk\nassessments have multiple limitations. These national risk\nestimates use a crude surrogate of ETS exposure, based on\nsurvey data indicating whether or not individuals live with\nsmokers. This exposure metric was chosen to correspond\nwith the epidemiological studies applied in these national risk\nassessments, as quantitative measurements of ETS concen-\ntrations and exposure have not been available for all\nparticipants in these studies (Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention, 2006). Such an approach does provide\nreasonable estimates of national-scale health risks, albeit with\nsome uncertainties, but the reliability of this surrogate\nmeasure may vary across demographic subpopulations, and\nthe approach lacks sufficient resolution to identify potentially\nmeaningful community differences in exposure. The smoking\nliterature shows significant sociodemographic and geographic\nvariation of smoking prevalence and intensity (Shavers et al.,\n2006); furthermore, housing characteristics such as home\nvolume and air exchange rate significantly influence exposure\nimplications of smoking (Klepeis and Nazaroff, 2006).\nDemographic factors correlated with smoking may also be\n1. Address all correspondence to: Dr. Teresa Chahine, Harvard School of\nE-mail: tchahine@post.harvard.edu\nwww.nature.com/jes\ncorrelated with housing characteristics, influencing ETS\nconcentration patterns and potentially increasing variability\nwithin and between communities.\nThere is a growing interest in quantifying ETS exposure at\nthe community level because of its ubiquity in indoor\nenvironments and its association with multiple health outcomes\nas described above. ETS is cited as an environmental issue of\nconcern within the context of community-based cumulative\nassessment of indoor pollutants such as particulate matter (PM)\nassociated with asthma (Zartarian and Schultz, 2010). How-\never, national-scale analyses lack sufficient resolution for the\nabove-mentioned reasons and rarely are local data available on\nPrevious studies provide insight about ETS concentrations\nin indoor microenvironments and biomarkers of ETS\nexposures, but none have generated the data needed to\ncharacterize exposure systematically at a community level\nacross the United States. Studies conducted before the\nintroduction of smoking restrictions in public venues directly\nmeasured concentrations of ETS-PM using personal moni-\ntors, but the evidence from these studies cannot be used\ndirectly to construct exposure models in residential settings\nJenkins et al., 2001). Given increasing smoking restrictions in\npublic places, the majority of the exposure and risk burden\nmay shift to the residential environment, but no study to date\nhas developed broad-based and generalizable models of ETS\nexposure inside homes. Previous residential studies have\neither characterized ETS contributions to residential expo-\nsures within hypothetical simulation models or using\nmeasurements but without a nationally generalizable model\net al., 2008). It is therefore unknown how variability in\nsmoking patterns correlates with housing characteristics that\ninfluence indoor concentrations of ETS, necessary in\ndetermining variability in residential concentrations and risk.\nStudies using cotinine as a biomarker of exposure among\nchildren have demonstrated significant associations with\nparental education, race/ethnicity, income, and home size,\nbut did not yield models directly applicable to all locations at\nfine geographic resolution and had challenges in separating\npredictors of exposure from factors that could influence\nWe aim to develop a model that can be used to\nsystematically estimate residential ETS concentrations in\ndemographic and geographic subpopulations using publicly\navailable data across the United States for the purpose of\nscreening-level cumulative or comparative risk assessment.\nWe develop and apply regression models based on national\ndata sets to estimate residential cigarette smoking and air\nexchange rate patterns in order to characterize the distribu-\ntion of PM concentrations from ETS in United States\nhomes. We investigate whether household demographic and\ngeographic variables that are widely available at fine\ngeographic resolution can be used to predict (1) the\nlikelihood of residential exposure to ETS-PM and (2)\nconcentration levels of ETS-PM in exposed households.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nThe study population for the ETS model consisted of 98,329\nindividuals residing in 39,107 homes for which occupant\ninterviews were conducted in the 2007 National American\nHousing Survey (AHS) (US Department of Housing and\nUrban Development, Office of Policy Development and\nResearch, 2009). The AHS is a nationally representative\nsurvey of the housing stock in the United States. Information\ncollected during the survey included occupants' demographic\ncharacteristics, which we used to model the likelihood of\nsmoking; and housing characteristics, which we used to\nTable 1a.

Table 1a summarizes\nthe steps conducted to estimate and model variability in ETS\nconcentrations. Table 1b provides a summary of parameters\nand assumptions used to calculate the estimated ETS-PM\nemissions and equilibrium concentrations. Both the model\nsteps and parametric assumptions are described in more\ndetail below. Unless otherwise stated, all steps were\nconducted using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute).\nCPS-TUS Smoking Models\nTwo smoking models were developed for this study, using\ndata from the 2006\u00ad7 Current Population SurveyFTobacco\nUse Supplement (CPS-TUS) (US Department of Commerce,\nously been used within multilevel logistic regressions to\npredict the probability of smoking based on individual\ncharacteristics (age, sex, poverty, race/ethnicity, nativity,\neducation, occupation, employment, marital status, and\nnumber of people in the household) and area characteristics\n(state smoking laws, state taxes, percent poverty of core-\nbased statistical area); more details about the underlying\nstatistical approach are described elsewhere (Chahine, 2010).\nFor the purpose of our analyses, we needed to make\nmultiple modifications to the previous modeling framework\n(Chahine, 2010), given the focus in this analysis on\nresidential exposures as well as constraints in available data\nwithin other steps of the modeling (Table 1a). In our first\nmodel (model 1a), we used as our outcome variable smoking\nat home rather than smoking overall. The TUS asked\nrespondents whether smoking is prohibited inside the home,\npermitted in some places or at some time inside the home,\nor permitted everywhere inside the home. Subjects who\nreplied that smoking is prohibited inside the home were\nassigned a value of 0 for the outcome; all other subjects were\nassigned a value of 1. As no further detail was provided in the\nsurvey, for the purpose of this analysis we did not\ndifferentiate between subjects who were permitted to smoke\nin some places or at some time inside the home vs everywhere\ninside the home.\nIn our second model, we used TUS data on number of\ncigarettes smoked daily for home smokers, which was\npredicted using linear regression (model 1b). Occupation\nand employment, which were statistically significant pre-\ndictors previously (Chahine, 2010), were not included\nbecause insufficient information was provided on these\ncovariates in the AHS data set. Random effects at the state\nand core-based statistical area level were also not included,\ndue to insufficient geographic identifiers in the AHS data set.\nWe used a household random parameter to account for the\nnested structure of the AHS data. Dummy variables were\nadded to represent census region and metropolitan status\n(central city vs suburb). Models 1a and 1b were created using\nA total of 24% of the TUS study population did not\ncomplete the portion of the survey dedicated to rules of\nsmoking at home and work. These subjects were either\nunemployed, self-employed, or retired. Summary statistics\nwere performed to determine whether this sub-population\ndiffered from the general population in demographics and\nsmoking prevalence. A further 1% of the TUS study\npopulation did not know or refused to answer this portion\nof the questionnaire. Therefore the total sample size for\npeople were excluded due to missing values for number of\ncigarettes, resulting in a sample size of 18,265 for model 1b.\nAHS Smoking Predictions\nAs described above, we used model 1a to calculate the\npredicted probability of home smoking for each individual in\nthe AHS, according to their sociodemographic characteristics\n(age, sex, poverty, race/ethnicity, nativity, education, marital\nstatus, and number of people in the household) and\ngeographic covariates (census region and urban status). The\npredicted probability was then used to assign a binary home-\nsmoking status for each individual, to appropriately capture\nthe fact that each household either does or does not have a\nsmoker. This was done by generating a random number\nTable 1b. Parameters and model assumptions used to calculate ETS-PM emissions and equilibrium concentrations.\nParameter Assumption and central estimates used in model\nTotal daily number of cigarettes smoked by home smokers Estimated by applying model 1b for each individual in AHS 2007 data set.\nProportion of total waking hours spent at home Half of total waking hours are assumed to be spent inside the home.\nRate of cigarette consumption Cigarettes are assumed to be consumed at a constant rate during waking\nhours.\nParticulate Matter (PM) emitted per cigarette 1 \u00c2 104 mg/cigarette\nVolume of housing unit Calculated from floor area provided in AHS 2007 data set, assuming\naverage height of three meters.\nAir changes per hour Estimated using unit type, year built, floor area.\nParticle deposition loss-rate coefficient 0.1/h\nReferences for each parameter can be found in the text.\nModeling residential environmental tobacco smoke\nChahine et al.\nbetween 0 and 1 and determining whether this number was\nless than the individual's predicted probability of home\nsmoking (resulting in an assignment of a home-smoking\nstatus of 1) or greater than the predicted probability of home\nsmoking (resulting in an assignment of a home-smoking\nstatus of 0). The resulting simulated data set of home\nsmokers vs non-home smokers was then carried forward in\nthe subsequent analyses described below. This process was\nAll individuals under the age of 18 were assigned a home-\nsmoking status of zero because the underlying TUS data on\nwhich the smoking models were built included adults only.\nFor those with a home-smoking status of 1, we then\ncalculated the predicted number of cigarettes smoked daily\naccording to their sociodemographic characteristics and\ngeographic location using model 1b. Based on previous\nliterature, on average people spend approximately one third\nof their time outside of the home, one third of their time\ninside the home during waking hours, and one third of their\ntime inside the home during non-waking hours (Klepeis,\nthat our study population spends one half of its waking time\ninside home, and multiplied the predicted daily number of\ncigarettes by a factor of 0.5 to obtain the predicted daily\nnumber of cigarettes smoked at home (Table 1b). We\nassumed a constant rate of smoking; although it is possible\nthat more cigarettes are smoked outside of working hours\ngiven the increasing smoking restrictions in public places, no\ninformation was available on this and we chose to use a linear\nrate based on previous literature (Klepeis and Nazaroff,\nAir Exchange Model\nTo estimate air exchange rates for the houses in the AHS data\nset, we used a previously published regression model\ndeveloped using a residential leakage database for single-\nfamily detached homes (Chan et al., 2005). Homes were\nseparated into conventional and low income, and model\nparameters were applied to calculate normalized leakage\nbased on year built and floor area. Floor area was reported as\nan ordinal variable in the AHS, whereas year built was\nreported in interval categories. For our calculations, each\nhome was assigned the midpoint of its year-built category.\n(which fell at the 96th percentile of the AHS data), to\nmaintain consistency with the residential leakage database\nused to develop the air exchange model. Floor area was\nmissing for 7914 houses and was estimated by multiplying\nthe number of rooms in these houses by the median room size\nin the data set (25 m2). Normalized leakage was translated\ninto air changes per hour (ACH) using an equation described\nby Chan et al., 2005. An additional factor of two was applied\nfor multi-unit housing structures, based on a previous study,\nwhich analyzed all currently available data on multi-unit\nhousing structures and reported that multi-unit housing\nstructures are on average twice as leaky per unit area as\nsingle-unit homes, with little systematic variation in building\nleakage by construction type, building activity type, height,\nsize, or location within the United States (Price et al., 2006).\nAlthough our approach is quite uncertain, direct application\nof the Chan et al. model to multi-family housing was not\nappropriate and no additional data sources were available;\nwe consider the implications of this assumption within our\nanalysis.\nETS Concentration Estimation\nScreening-level estimates of residential ETS concentrations\nwere calculated using a single-zone mass-balance equation,\nassuming perfect mixing: C \u00bc (Q/V)/(a \u00fek), where:\n1. C \u00bc equilibrium concentration (mg/m3)\n2. Q \u00bc emission rate (mg/h)\n3. V \u00bcvolume of housing unit (m3)\n4. a \u00bcair exchange rate (1/h)\n5. k \u00bcdeposition rate (1/h)\nEmission and deposition parameters were selected based\non previously reported central estimates: we used 10 mg per\ncigarette for PM emissions and 0.1/h for particle deposition\nloss-rate coefficient (Klepeis and Nazaroff, 2006). These\npreviously reported central estimates were based on an\nassimilation of multiple previous studies (Klepeis et al., 2003;\nStatistical Analysis of Estimated ETS-PM Concentrations\nMultiple analyses were conducted on the resulting ETS-PM\nconcentrations to develop broadly applicable models describ-\ning the association of ETS-PM with sociodemographic and\ngeographic variables available across the United States. The\nanalyses were performed at the household level rather than\nthe individual level, because our study population is clustered\nwithin households. Given available information, we assumed\nthat all individuals within a household are exposed to the\nsame equilibrium concentrations of residential ETS, though\ntime-activity pattern differences could clearly lead to\ndifferential personal exposures.\nWe restricted the household predictors to variables\navailable both in the AHS data set and cross-tabulated in\nthe United States census by census tract. A census tract is a\nsmall statistical subdivision of a county, containing 2500\u00ad\ntracts as our geographic resolution because they were\ndesigned to be homogeneous with respect to population\ncharacteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The\nUnited States census provides summary tables for singular\nhousehold variables, and cross-tabulations of selected vari-\nables. The largest cross-tabulation of multiple householder\ndemographic variables available is as follows: householder\nrace by householder age by household income. We also\nModeling residential environmental tobacco smoke Chahine et al.\nincluded dummy variables for census region and urban/rural\nstatus.\nA logistic regression model was fit to estimate the predic-\nted probability of non-zero ETS-PM in the indoor home\nenvironment with respect to the above variables (model 2a).\nFor the subset of people with non-zero residential ETS\nconcentrations, a log-linear regression model was fit to\ndescribe the distribution of ETS-PM concentrations in the\nindoor home environment (model 2b). These regression\nmodels were fit for each of the 1000 simulated data sets, and\nwe report results representing the mean across regression\nmodel fits.\nResults\nModels 1a and 1b: Home-Smoking Prevalence and Daily\nCigarettes Smoked in CPS-TUS\nThe average prevalence of home smokers in the TUS data set\nwas 10.9%, compared with an overall smoking prevalence of\n17.7%. The difference is attributable to the fact that 39.7%\nof smokers reported having smoke-free homes. The mean\nnumber of total daily cigarettes smoked by home smokers\nwas 16.2. Examining the characteristics of the subset with\nmissing data on home-smoking rules showed similar overall\nsmoking prevalence to the overall population and no\nsignificant differences in sociodemographic covariates, except\nthat it contains more people in the 18\u00ad24 age group and\nfewer people in the never-married group than the general\nstudy population.\nModels 1a and 1b shared many common patterns\n(Tables 2 and 3). The reference population was White non-\nHispanic women aged 45\u00ad54 with a high school degree who\nare native United States citizens, currently married, have an\ntwo or more people; the reference geographic categories\nwere census region 3 (i.e., South) and Metropolitan balance\n(i.e., not a central city). Compared with the reference\npopulation, higher odds of smoking at home and higher\nnumber of daily cigarettes among home smokers were found\nin White Non-Hispanic males, native United States citizens,\nand those with lower education levels. A U-shaped pattern\nwas observed for age, peaking at age 45\u00ad54 in both models.\nLiving in a metropolitan suburb was associated with lower\nodds of home smoking, as was living in the Western United\nStates (census region 4). The effect of gender differed by race\nin both models, as indicated by statistically significant\ninteraction terms.\nSignificant effect modification was found between census\nregion and race in model 1a (Table 2). This is consistent with\nprevious findings, which showed the effect of race to differ by\ninteraction was not statistically significant in model 1b, and\nwas not retained in the final model (Table 3). Other key\ndifferences were that people living alone were more likely to\nbe home smokers but smoked fewer cigarettes relative to\nhome smokers living with two or more people; those living in\nmetropolitan central cities were also more likely to smoke but\nsmoked significantly fewer cigarettes. As indicated by the\n95% confidence intervals in Table 3, although annual\nhousehold income was one of the most significant predictors\nof home smoking, it did not predict the number of cigarettes\nTable 2.

In general, as can be seen from\nthe confidence intervals in Tables 2 and 3, most predictors\nhad weaker associations with the outcome in model 1b\ncompared with model 1a. This could be due to smaller\nsample size and a lesser effect of demographic and geographic\nfactors on smoking intensity of home smokers.\nAir Exchange and ETS-PM Simulations in AHS\nEstimated ACH ranged from 0.07\u00ad2.7. The mean estimated\nACH was 0.5/h, with a median of 0.4/h and standard\ndeviation of 0.4/h. Slight regional variations were observed,\nwith the highest air exchange rates in the Northeast (mean\nAcross all 1000 simulated datasets, the mean prevalence of\nsmoking at home in our AHS study population was 10.9%,\nsimilar to the TUS study population, with a mean number of\ncigarettes predicted for home smokers of 14.9, slightly lower\nthan the mean of 16.2 observed in the TUS. Approximately\n17% of homes had non-zero ETS concentrations. The mean\nhousehold concentration of ETS-PM in the total population\nacross individual homes and simulations was 2.8 mg/m3, with\na median of zero and a SD of 8.9. In the exposed subset, the\nmean household concentration was 16.3 mg/m3 (median\nthe maximum concentration reached over 499 mg/m3, in-\ndicating that a small percentage of the population is predicted\nto be exposed to extremely high concentrations of ETS-PM.\nFigure 1 presents box-plots of ETS-PM concentrations for\nkey covariates.\nModels 2a and 2b: Statistical Analysis of Estimated\nETS-PM Concentrations\nOdds of ETS exposure (model 2a) showed similar patterns of\nassociation with many householder covariates as was\nobserved in the underlying smoking prevalence model with\nindividual covariates (model 1a), with the exception of race\n(Table 4). Concentrations of ETS-PM in the exposed\npopulation (model 2b) showed similar patterns of association\nwith householder covariates as was observed in the under-\nlying number of cigarettes model with individual covariates\n(model 1b), with the exception of census region (Table 5).\nAlthough households in the Midwest had the highest odds of\nexposure, exposed households in the South had the highest\nmean concentrations after controlling for all covariates. This\nreflects the role of housing characteristics in determining\nETS-PM concentrations, as the lowest air exchange rates\nwere estimated in the South.\nA non-monotonic relationship was observed between\nhousehold income and ETS-PM concentration in exposed\nhomes, where households in the second lowest income\nquartile had the highest concentration (Table 5). This is a\nresult of the low-income air exchange model provided by\nChan et al. (2005) and the factor of two that we further\napplied to attached units (which are most prevalent in the\nlowest income category). R-square values for the log-linear\nregression models were on the order of 0.2, indicating that a\nsubstantial proportion of variability in ETS-PM concentra-\ntions remains unexplained by the covariates we controlled\nfor. Standard errors of the individual models (n \u00bc 1000) were\non the same order as the SD of the mean parameter estimates\n(intercept and coefficients, denoted by b) for both models\nshown in Tables 4 and 5, indicating that the model is\nappropriately characterizing uncertainty (results not shown).\nDiscussion\nOur results demonstrate that the substantial variability in\nresidential ETS concentrations, driven by variability in both\nTable 3.

These studies incorporated time-activity\npatterns and ventilation patterns but relied on a hypothetical\nsmoking population, whereas our study is a snapshot\ncharacterization of equilibrium concentrations based on para-\nmeters estimated from a national survey. Thus, although these\nstudies showed that exposure concentrations may vary within a\nhousehold depending on ventilation behavior and time-activity\npatterns of occupants, our study suggests that time-averaged\nconcentrations can vary between households depending\non smoking patterns and house type, volume, and age (all of\nwhich vary between sociodemographic and geographic\nsubpopulations).\nIn our multiple logistic and linear regression models we\nattempted to capture variability in log odds of ETS exposure\n(model 2a) and concentrations of ETS-PM in exposed\npopulations (model 2b) using covariates available across the\nUnited States from the census. Although the majority of\nestimated parameters were consistent with those of models 1a\nand 1b (e.g., U-shaped curve for age, higher exposure in\nrural locations and the Midwest), some parameters had\ndiffering relationships for ETS than for smoking. In\nparticular, race was not a significant predictor of residential\nETS exposure in model 2a. One possible explanation is that\nthe grouping of the variables was modified in order to be\nconsistent with the 2000 census. Race/ethnicity were grouped\ntogether in model 1a, to maintain integrity with the original\nsmoking model from which it was developed, which was\ndetermined based on the previous literature. However, the\n2000 census presents race without the ethnicity component.\nIn model 1a, the log odds for the black \u00adnon-Hispanic\nindicator variable was borderline significant at P \u00bc 0.046,\nwhereas the log odds for the Hispanic indicator variable was\nhighly significant at Po0.001. The association captured in\nmodel 1a may have been largely due to the ethnicity\ncomponent rather than the race component, which was not\ncaptured by the race variable in model 2a.\nOur findings can be additionally evaluated by contrasting\nthem with studies examining cotinine levels among children,\ntaken from the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES). Among children with reported smoke\nexposure at home (paralleling our model 2b), cotinine levels\nwere significantly higher with low parental education, white\nethnicity (relative to Mexican-American ethnicity), and\nhouseholds with fewer rooms, with a borderline significant\neffect of poverty and no significant difference by region or\nwhite/black race (Mannino et al., 2001). Although our\nfindings are not directly comparable given different covari-\nates, and the NHANES study includes factors influencing\nmetabolism and dosimetry, both studies reinforce the\nimportance of housing factors and more complex associa-\ntions with household income than seen in studies of smoking\npatterns.\nOne of the major uncertainties in our analysis relates to\nour modeling of air exchange rates. We applied a model\ndeveloped for single-family detached units and adapted the\nmodel to accommodate attached units. The literature on air\nexchange rates in attached housing units is scarce, and\ntheoretical understanding of factors influencing air exchange\ncould lead us to argue for either higher or lower air exchange\nrelative to detached units. On one hand, the lack of a ceiling/\nroof providing a direct pathway to the outdoors and the\nsmaller ratio of exterior wall area per unit of interior volume\nin attached homes may point to smaller air exchange rates.\nOn the other hand, larger buildings may contain more\nopportunity for leakage such as cracks and leaks; the natural\nphysical forces that move air (e.g., wind and stack effect) are\nmore pronounced in taller buildings and there may be weaker\nfinancial incentives for energy-efficient construction or retro-\nfits (Diamond et al., 1996). Our choice of multiplying by a\nfactor of two for attached units is based on a study, which\nanalyzed all available data on multi-family homes and\nreported greater leakage and a larger air exchange rate than\nsingle-family homes (Price et al., 2006). To assess the\nsensitivity of our results on this assumption, we removed\nthe factor of two and repeated our analysis. This did not\nchange the general patterns observed in model 2a and 2b\n(results not shown). In the absence of a larger body of\nknowledge on air exchange in multi-family housing, we relied\non this analysis, but additional data collection would clearly\nbe warranted.\nOur study has a number of additional limitations. First,\nlack of state and metropolitan area identifiers for over half\nthe study population in the AHS prevented us from using\nmore detailed geographic inputs in the smoking model.\nAlthough this reduced our predictive power, these inputs\nwere previously shown to have a smaller contribution to\npredicting smoking variability than individual sociodemo-\ngraphic variables (Chahine, 2010). Given our inclusion of\ngeographic information in the form of census region and\nurban status indicator variables, we believe that our model\nstill captures much of the variability in smoking that can be\npredicted with available covariates. Second, the use of a\nsimple box model to estimate ETS concentrations may not\nadequately capture indoor conditions, given the multi-com-\npartment nature of most houses. For a more sophisticated\nModeling residential environmental tobacco smoke Chahine et al.\nexposure assessment, the use of a more detailed model\naccounting for differences in smoking rules within a house,\nnumber of rooms, movement of people, and ventilation\ninformation is required. However, because our aim is to\nprovide screening-level estimates, we chose a simple box\nmodel. Third, although the previously published air exchange\nmodel used in our study established that higher leakage rates\nare found in low-income homes, the data used for such\nhomes came from a state database and the model likely does\nnot capture variability in leakage in different regions of the\nBeyond the concerns mentioned above, our study does not\ntake into account exchange between units in the same\nbuilding, which may be a substantial contributor of ETS, nor\nthe variability in air exchange rates for different units in the\nsame building (Bohac et al., 2007). Another limitation is that\nthe simulated home smoking includes adults aged 18 and\nabove only, which may result in an underestimation of\nresidential ETS exposure. Finally, our simulation method\ndoes not formally take into account, which individuals in our\ndata set live in the same homes. Although model 1a\nincorporates within-house correlations in smoking into the\nb-parameters used to estimate predicted probability of home\nsmoking, the random number generation method does not\nfurther incorporate information on individuals living in the\nsame home in the AHS data set (i.e., the likelihood that a\nsmoker will live with another smoker, beyond the demo-\ngraphic factors that predict individual behaviors).\nMore generally, the results of our ETS-PM regression\nmodels shed light on the average differences between sub-\npopulation groups as represented by household income,\nhouseholder race, and householder's age, using variables that\nare universally available at the census tract level. However,\nother factors remain which influence residential ETS\nexposure and which have not been controlled for. Therefore,\nalthough our estimates are an improvement on national\naverages, use of our model should be restricted to screening\npurposes, to identify likely exposure hot spots where more\ndetailed local data could be gathered and to inform screening-\nlevel community cumulative exposure assessments.\nDespite these limitations, this study leverages data from\nthree national data sets to provide screening estimates of\nresidential ETS exposure in demographic and geographic\nsub-populations across the United States. Although previous\nstudies used average smoking and air exchange statistics in\nETS exposure simulations, our study captures variability in\nresidential smoking patterns and housing characteristics,\nincluding factors that correlate with both smoking and air\nexchange. Our approach, although constrained in the\npredictors included, would theoretically allow for ETS\nexposure to be systematically estimated for a census tract\ngiven its location and demographic cross-tabulations.\nFuture studies should investigate correlations between ETS\nand other residential pollutants to determine whether\nsub-populations with highest ETS exposure are also more\nexposed to other indoor sources.\nAlthough no relative risks are established for health\noutcomes from ETS-PM, evidence based on ambient PM\nwith appropriate adjustments for personal exposures vs\noutdoor concentrations could allow for a screening-level\ncharacterization of risk from residential ETS-PM exposure.\nTo contextualize this risk, the annual average residential\nETS-PM concentration of 16 mg/m3 that we have estimated\nfor exposed households in the United States is higher than\nthe annual average outdoor PM2.5\nstated that exposure to indoor PM is as hazardous, if not\nmore hazardous, than exposure to outdoor PM (Nazaroff\nof the population is exposed to residential ETS-PM, and\nrelative risks may differ between the mixture of particles in\nambient PM and those in ETS-PM, the health risks may be\nof a similar order of magnitude as those from ambient PM\nfor this exposed sub-population.\nMore generally, by providing estimates of ETS-PM\nconcentration distributions for different sub-populations,\nwe allow for future risk assessments that move beyond\n``living with a smoker (yes/no)'' exposure classification.\nThese estimates are a useful starting point for communities\ninterested in characterizing cumulative health risks from\nindoor air pollutants, which are likely substantial contribu-\ntors to population disease burdens.\n"
