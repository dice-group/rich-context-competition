    "abstract": "Abstract\nA new breast cancer treatment, brachytherapy-based accelerated partial breast radiotherapy (RT), was adopted before\nlong-term effectiveness evidence, potentially increasing morbidity and costs compared with whole breast RT. The aim of\nthis study was to estimate complication rates and RT-specific and 1-year costs for a cohort of female Medicare beneficiaries\nfor complications and generalized linear models (log link, gamma distribution) for costs. Overall, 11% (n = 5296) underwent\nbrachytherapy-based RT; 9.4% had complications. Odds of any complication were higher (odds ratio [OR]: 1.62; 95%\n$4803 lower than brachytherapy (P < .0001). Multivariable analyses indicated brachytherapy yielded 76% higher RT costs\ncosts before long-term evidence proved its effectiveness. Policies should require treatment registries with reimbursement\nincentives to capture surveillance data for new technologies.\n",

Instead of a standard treat-\nment for early invasive breast cancer that includes lumpec-\ntomy with 4 to 7 weeks of whole breast RT,3,4 evidence\nsuggested that a new RT paradigm requiring twice-daily treat-\nment over 5 days could be effective by targeting only the\ntumor cavity and immediate surrounding area rather than the\nwhole breast;5,6 this new RT was called accelerated partial\nbreast RT. It utilizes more efficiently focused RT to the tumor\nbed, where most ipsilateral breast recurrences occur; it also\nreduces the time burden and inconvenience of whole breast RT\nby requiring fewer treatments over a shorter time period,3,4,7,8\nand it may minimize acute side effects such as fibrosis, asym-\nmetry, skin burns, and chronic side effects such as cardiac tox-\nicity, pulmonary fibrosis, and rare secondary malignancies.9,10\nHowever, published guidelines suggested that accelerated\npartial breast RT should be used on highly selected patients,\nthose with smaller tumors, negative lymph nodes, and low\nprobability of recurrence.11,12 Balloon brachytherapy\u00adbased\naccelerated partial breast RT for early breast cancer is an\nexample of a technology with early uptake prior to published\nlong-term effectiveness evidence.1,13-16 The treatment requires\nthe invasive surgical implantation of a balloon-like device into\nthe tumor bed after lumpectomy, making the patient suscepti-\nble to infection. A high-dose seed of radiation is inserted\nthrough a catheter into the balloon-like device twice daily for\n5 days. Early follow-up data indicated low local recurrence\nrates and good cosmetic outcomes,7,10,17 but longer follow-up\n1NYU Langone Health, New York, USA\n2MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC, USA\n3Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nHeather T.

Previous work estimating com-\nplication rates included all patients receiving balloon brachyther-\napy in large cohorts of Medicare beneficiaries,24,25 and used\nanalytic methods to try to account for selection into treatment.\nWe studied a more homogenous patient cohort with the least\nextensive invasive breast cancer, to estimate relevant complica-\ntion rates in a more guideline-appropriate cohort.\nData and Methods\nWe analyzed physician, inpatient, and outpatient Medicare fee-\nData Warehouse (CCW) for women aged 66 years and\nolder with at least 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient International\nClassification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis\ncodes for breast cancer (174.X)26 and who underwent breast-\nconserving surgery. We included women with continuous cov-\nerage by Medicare Parts A and B and who were not in a health\nmaintenance organization (HMO) during the observation\nperiod to ensure we had full claims to assess treatment and pre-\nexisting comorbidities. To select patients who had earlier stage\ndisease and would be more likely concordant with professional\nsociety selection criteria, we excluded those who had more\nextensive treatment, assuming they had more advanced breast\ncancer, because we did not have explicit stage information in\nclaims data. Therefore, we excluded those who received mas-\ntectomy, chemotherapy, or an axillary lymph node dissection\nafter a sentinel lymph node biopsy prior to RT. We categorized\nRT type using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes\nsimilar to previous work,1 using CPT/Healthcare Common\nProcedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes appropriate to dis-\ntinguish between brachytherapy-based accelerated partial\nbreast RT and whole breast RT within 16 weeks of surgery for\nwhole breast RT and within 12 weeks following surgery for\nbrachytherapy (Table 1).At the end of RT, the follow-up period\nTable 1.

Patient\nage and race were taken from the Medicare eligibility file. We\nlinked US Census tract data for information on rural residence\nand high poverty (>20%), and calculated the Klabunde comor-\nbeneficiaries undergoing RT after breast-conserving surgery\nbidity burden and have 1 year of follow-up that started at the\nend of radiation treatment. High poverty was not significant\nand was removed from our models. This study was approved\nby the lead author's institutional review board.\nComplications Analysis\nWe conducted chi-square tests of differences in complication\nrates by RT modality. Next, to evaluate the odds of a patient\nhaving a complication associated with RT, we estimated a\nmultivariable logistic model for the odds of any complica-\ntion and for the odds of each complication type separately.\nWe conducted Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests for\neach model. This chi-square test was not significant in any\nmodels, indicating no evidence of poor fit. Out of concern\nfor selection into treatment (i.e., endogeneity bias, or con-\nfounding by indication), we explored using a bivariate probit\nmodel analogous to instrumental variables analysis28-30 and\nfound our point estimates of complications were nearly iden-\ntical to the nonsimple model results. For ease of interpreta-\ntion, therefore, we present the logistic regression results.\nCost Analyses\nWe separately calculated mean RT-specific and 1-year total\ncosts for combined inpatient, outpatient, and physician ser-\nvices, adjusting for inflation using the consumer price index,\ncomparing mean costs by treatment type using a t test,\nbecause mean costs are easily interpreted and typically used\nas inputs for cost-effectiveness analyses. We also calculated\nmean cost confidence intervals (CIs). We then estimated\nmultivariable generalized linear models with a log link and\ngamma distribution to explore factors associated with costs.\nIn multivariable analyses, we accounted for whether a sub-\nject had 1 or more RT complications (e.g., infection or wound\ncomplication, seroma, fibrosis), race, rural residence, age,\nand comorbidity index. The coefficients are exponentiated\nand presented as rate ratios, indicating the relative expendi-\ntures with and without the covariate effect, or the percentage\nincrease or decrease in costs associated with each covariate.\nFinally, we estimated the economic burden to Medicare for\nreimbursing brachytherapy-based accelerated partial breast\nRT instead of standard whole breast RT in advance of pub-\nlished long-term evidence. All costs are represented as 2008\nUS$. We conducted sensitivity analyses on all multivariable\nmodels to evaluate whether death during follow-up affecting\n<2% of patients had an impact on model results.\nResults\napy-based accelerated RT (Table 2).

Yet in this early time\nperiod, balloon brachytherapy\u00adbased accelerated partial breast\nRT diffused throughout clinical care in the United States1 with\nlimited wide-scale assessment of complications or costs\nTable 2.

Based on our estimates, Medicare spent an additional\n$28.8 million on brachytherapy-based accelerated partial\nbreast RT treatment for our cohort alone, beyond what stan-\nnew radiation treatment modality increased treatment-related\ncomplications and health care costs before long-term evidence\nproved its effectiveness.\nCompared with other work in this area, we honed in on a\nfocused patient cohort, one that would be more likely recom-\nmended for brachytherapy-based RT based on professional\nsociety guidelines, because patients receiving, for example,\nchemotherapy, had more advanced cancer and may have\nbeen at differential risk for complications. Our cohort of\nnearly 48 000 Medicare beneficiaries that was tailored to be\nas homogenous as possible with regard to disease stage saw\nmuch lower rates of complications by RT modality compared\nwith other studies.24,25 Other investigators have found much\nhigher absolute rates of infectious and noninfectious compli-\ncations compared with our results.24,25 This could be due to\ntheir broader sample selection that included all use of brachy-\ntherapy RT. We also note that we were comparing complica-\ntions of a new therapy during a steep learning curve phase\nwith a tried-and-true practice in effect for nearly 30 years,\nand absolute rates of complications likely will decrease fur-\nther over time.

Minor complica-\ntions that can be handled with routine follow-up typically are\nnot billed, and therefore, they will not be apparent in claims\ndata. However, complications requiring additional treatment\nor diagnostic testing, such as re-excision, intravenous antibi-\notics, or hospitalization, should be more easily identifiable\nwithin 1 year of RT. We did not have information about the\nuse of antibiotics before, during, or after treatment, however.\nDue to the 1-year follow-up period, we excluded other long-\nterm complications such as pericarditis and pulmonary fibro-\nsis, which could be associated differentially with different\nforms of RT but are hard to measure and extremely rare in 1\nyear of follow-up. It is possible that brachytherapy-based\naccelerated partial breast RT reduces long-term side effects\nto heart and lung, while increasing short-term side effects\nthat are measured in this study. In general, using claims data\nand limiting follow-up time may underestimate the number\nof complications. Furthermore, fully informed patients may\nhave chosen treatment convenience and the risk of a short-\nterm infection or seroma, which are correctable, over a\nTable 3.

With some complications being\nextremely rare, smaller registries or single-institution studies\nsimply cannot robustly estimate complication risks. Our\nresults showed lower absolute predicted rates of complica-\ntions in a more homogenous cohort than other early\nMedicare covered broad use of this technology before\nlong-term evidence of its effectiveness was shown, yielding a\ntremendous cost. We know that nonclinical factors partially\ninfluenced the use of this new technology.1,33 For example,\nbrachytherapy-based accelerated partial breast RT comes with\nexplicit financial incentives for surgeons to become involved\nin radiation treatment, because they receive a device implanta-\ntion fee, which does not happen with traditional whole breast\nRT, and they may also have pressures from colleagues or\npatients to use new treatments.1,33 Furthermore, there was no\nconsensus about technology adoption from the medical com-\nmunity,33 making it difficult to have a \"coordinated approach\nto evidence generation.\"34 It would have been prudent for the\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services to develop addi-\ntional RT treatment registries to gather sufficient evidence of\neffectiveness prior to widespread, open dissemination, as well\nas tie reimbursement to clinical data collection.
