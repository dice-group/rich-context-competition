    "abstract": "Abstract\nAccounting professionals, business college accrediting bodies, and even accounting academics themselves acknowledge that\nthere is a disconnect between academe and the rigors and requirements of the accounting profession. Among the suggestions\nproposed in the literature to reduce this gap is the faculty internship, where accounting faculty members work within the field\nas accountants. Heretofore, individual case studies report benefits of such internships that accrue to a variety of stakeholder\ngroups beyond just the faculty intern and include the academic institution, students, and accounting profession through\nfaculty internships. This research seeks wider support for these benefits. This descriptive study involved surveying a sample\nof accounting faculty members to get their opinions about the benefits and drawbacks of faculty internships, and to determine\nthe level of use of faculty internships in accounting. In all, 128 usable responses were obtained, representing a 14.6% response\nrate. The results of this study reveal that although most faculty members acknowledge the benefits cited in the literature, too\nfew take advantage of faculty internships.\n",

Case\nstudies from a variety of disciplines describe, in detail,\nlengthy lists of benefits that accrue from such practitioner/\nacademic interaction. These studies include accounting fac-\nulty internships, which have long been encouraged by the\naccounting profession. The research reported on herein\nbuilds upon the existing faculty internship case study\nresearch by conducting a descriptive study to ascertain\nwhether the benefits described are generalizeable to account-\ning faculty. Investigating the degree to which accounting fac-\nulty internships are used and understanding some of the\nperceived benefits/drawbacks are objectives of this research.\nLiterature Review\nThe accounting profession continues to yearn for a better\nlink between itself and academia. This desire has been\nexpressed on a variety of occasions and is not new. Most\nrecently, the Pathways Commission on Higher Education, in\nits report titled \"Charting a National Strategy for the Next\nGeneration of Accountants,\" developed detailed objectives\nand implementation items aimed at building the strongest\npossible professional accounting community, including\nfocused recommendations for integrating academe and prac-\ntitioners, with specific reference to faculty internships\n(American Accounting Association, American Institute of\nCertified Public Accountants, & The Pathways Commission\non Accounting Higher Education, 2012). The Pathways\nCommission study was underwritten by the American\nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants and the American\nAccounting Association, and included constituents drawn\nfrom every facet of the accounting profession. In an earlier\nseminal piece, Accounting Education: Charting the Course\nThrough a Perilous Future, Albrecht and Sack (2000)\nemphasized the need for academic institutions to make a\ncommitment to invest in faculty development sufficient to\nensure that faculty stay engaged with the fast-paced chang-\ning world of business, including consulting, internship, resi-\ndency, or other real-world experiences. Albrecht and Sack's\nwork was the culmination of a project jointly sponsored by\ntheAmericanAccountingAssociation, theAmerican Institute\n1Ohio Northern University, Ada, USA\n2Xavier University, Cincinnati, OH, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nSusan M.

Schertzer2\nand Susan M. B. Schertzer1\n Keywords\naccounting, faculty, internship, descriptive study\n2 SAGE Open\nof Certified Public Accountants, the Institute of Management\nAccountants, and all of the \"Big\" accounting firms at the\ntime, which included Arthur Andersen, Deloitte & Touche,\nErnst & Young, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers. As\nsuch, all of the major professional accounting associations\nand practitioners endorsed the work of Albrecht and Sack.\nIn 2008, Cynthia Fornelli, executive director of the Center\nfor Audit Quality, testified before the Advisory Committee\non the Auditing Profession of the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury that quality audits require well-trained auditors. As\none way to promote the development of well-trained human\ncapital, Fornelli proposed that\neducational institutions, auditing firms, corporations, federal and\nstate regulators, and others engage in a two-fold strategy to both\nencourage cross-sabbaticals and eliminate financial or career\ndisincentives for participating in such experiences. Further, the\nCommittee recommends that university administrators place as\nhigh a value on professional sabbaticals for purposes of\npromotion and tenure for research and scholarly publication.\n(Advisory Committee on the Auditing Profession, 2008, p. V:13)\nThe information presented by these constituencies indi-\ncates that faculty internships have the strong support of\naccounting practitioners.\nThe premier accrediting body for business schools,\nAACSB International--The Association to Advance\nCollegiate Schools of Business--essentially mandates\naccounting faculty engagement in internships or similar\nexperiences in its Eligibility Procedures and Accreditation\nStandards for Accounting Accreditation for schools that\nwish to have their accounting programs accredited.\nSpecifically, Standard 36 requires that the accounting fac-\nulty as a whole must maintain a portfolio of \"relevant practi-\ncal experience\" in business and accounting, and includes in\nits definition of relevant practical experience internships\nand work in a variety of business, government, and not-for-\nClearly, the accounting profession and the AACSB recog-\nnize the importance and value of faculty internships to the\nenhancement of accounting education. In addition, extant\ncase studies report that faculty who have had an internship\nexperience feel that it enhanced their classroom performance\nand provided benefits to their institution and to the internship\nauthors all fall within the same general categories--benefits\nto faculty development, teaching quality, other areas of fac-\nulty life, the sponsoring firm, and students. Several studies\nalso describe a limited number of drawbacks that may result\nfrom a faculty internship.\nThere is strong support for the value of faculty internships\nfrom a variety of stakeholder groups. What is lacking is\ninformation regarding the benefits of internships that spans a\nbroader scope than solely in individual situations and occur-\nrences, and information on the rate of use of this means to\nbridge the practitioner\u00adacademic gap. Whereas case studies\nplace emphasis on the full contextual analysis of a limited\nnumber of events, a broader study of the issue is needed to\nferret out whether the benefits reported by the individuals\ndescribed in the case studies can be generalized to the larger\npopulation of accounting faculty as a whole. This article\ndescribes the results of a survey conducted to fill this need.\nThis study should be useful and informative to accounting\nfaculty, to the institutions who employ accounting faculty,\nand to potential internship sponsors.\nMethod\nWe conducted a descriptive study to collect data about the\nincidence of accounting faculty internships. A descriptive\nstudy does not execute causal hypothesis testing; instead, the\nobjective of a descriptive study is to provide valuable infor-\nmation about the who, what, when, where, and how of a topic\nto generate hypotheses or identify areas for future research.\nThe emphasis of a descriptive study is generally on the esti-\nmation, rather than the testing, of the prevalence, history, or\nattitudes and perceptions about a topic. In this study, we\ndescribe (a) the prevalence of faculty internships, (b) the\ncharacteristics of the schools where faculty interns teach, (c)\nthe experience of faculty interns, and (d) the benefits and\ndrawbacks of faculty internships, as perceived by those with\nactual faculty intern experience compared with those who\nhave not experienced an internship.\nSample\nWe drew our sample from the population of U.S. account-\nAccounting Faculty Directory (Hasselback, 2008). This is\nan annual compilation of faculty members from more than\n1,000 schools, including every accounting program in the\nUnited States as well as many other countries. This direc-\ntory provides information about each faculty member's\nrank, area of expertise, highest degree earned and from\nwhere, length of tenure and contact information (including\nemail address). We randomly sampled 10% of the faculty\nmembers of various rank, time in service, and area of exper-\ntise from each of the nearly 1,000 U.S. accounting pro-\ngrams reported in the directory, in an attempt to obtain a\nrepresentative sample of U.S. accounting program faculty\nmembers. This yielded a sample of 875 faculty members to\nsurvey. However, it should be noted that those faculty\nmembers with a more professional- or practice-oriented\nagenda might be more inclined to respond to our survey\nthan those with a more research-oriented agenda, due to the\nsubject nature of the survey.\nChristopher et al. 3\nSurvey\nDemographic questions included faculty member's school\nsize and accreditation status, and the faculty member's length\nof tenure, professional certification, degrees held, profes-\nsional experience, type of internship(s), and internship tasks.\nThe remainder of the survey was devoted to collecting infor-\nmation about faculty opinions concerning the various bene-\nfits and drawbacks of faculty internships mentioned in the\nliterature. In designing our survey, these benefits and draw-\nbacks were discussed among faculty members who had had\ninternships, with general consensus that those included in the\nsurvey were representative of what the faculty members had\nexperienced in their internships. Our survey was then pre-\ntested on several faculty members, including half who had\ncompleted internships and half who had not. Half of these\nfaculty were tenured, half were not tenured, and their years\nof teaching experience ranged from 2 to more than 40. All\nhad prior professional accounting work experience, from 5\nyears to more than 20. We tried to pretest a broad range of\nfaculty experience to match as closely as possible the sample\nto which we would send the survey. The survey is included as\nAppendix A.\nBenefit and drawback questions were extracted from\nnumerous published case studies (American Accounting\nAssociation, American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants, & The Pathways Commission on Accounting\nAppendix B lists each question and the source(s) of the ques-\ntions. Based on categories derived from the literature, we\nassigned each benefit into one of the following five catego-\nries: faculty development (12 items), teaching quality (8\nitems), other areas of faculty life (7 items), sponsoring firm\n(11 items), and direct benefits to students (5 items). Seven\npotential drawbacks to completing a faculty internship cited\nin the literature were also included.\nAs we were interested in knowing respondents' assess-\nments and the strength of these assessments, we constructed\neach benefit/drawback item question using a Likert-type\nscale format, where respondents indicated how closely their\nfeelings agreed with each benefit/drawback on a rating scale\nranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree). For\nease of interpretation in the final analysis, these scales were\n\"reverse scored\" so that higher scores indicate strong agree-\nment (i.e., 5 = strongly agree and 1 = strongly disagree).\nSurvey Administration\nThe survey was distributed via email and administered using\na link to the online survey software, Qualtrics. Qualtrics is a\nleading online survey software used by more than 90 of the\nnation's top business schools, as well as by Fortune 500\nAfter 3 days, we had approximately 75 usable responses,\nand 8 undelivered (5 invalid email addresses and 3 retired\nfaculty). A reminder email was sent after a week. Within\nanother week after sending the reminder email, we had\nreceived 128 usable responses. According to Sheehan and\nMcMillan (1999), the response rate for email surveys tends\nto be somewhat lower than those of traditional postal mail\nsurveys. Surveys sent by educational/nonprofit organizations\nhave an average open rate of 17.5% and an average click-\nclick-through response rate, we closed the survey.\nResults\nInstitution Demographics\nSummary.Schools of a variety of sizes are represented.\nRespondents were fairly evenly distributed among the five\nuniversity size categories specified, as well as for the five\nsize categories specified for the number of accounting\nmajors. Most of the schools have relatively small class sizes\n(more than 90% of respondents reported smaller class sizes\nof up to 50 students), and a relatively small number of\naccounting faculty members (90% having from 1 to 20\naccounting faculty).\nMost respondents worked for institutions that had some\nkind of business accreditation (79%), with 64% having gen-\neral business AACSB accreditation. No significant differ-\nences were observed when internship benefit and drawback\nresponses were compared by institutional size and by\nAACSB accreditation versus no AACSB accreditation. The\nmajority of the schools represented (77%) are open to faculty\ninternships that could be done either during the school year\nand/or in the summer.\nInstitution Size\nAlmost 25% of respondents' university size was in the range\nTwenty-five percent of respondents indicated that their\nfollowed by approximately 22% with more than 300 stu-\nBusiness accreditation.We provided respondents with four\naccreditation choices: AACSB (business), ACBSP (Associa-\ntion of Collegiate Business School Programs), Other, or\nNone. Sixty-four percent of respondents teach in\n4 SAGE Open\nFigure 2. Number of accounting students in program.\nFigure 1. Institution size.\nChristopher et al. 5\nAACSB-accredited schools, with 45% of those schools also\nhaving AACSB accounting accreditation. Eleven percent are\naccredited by ACBSP. Of those who reported \"Other,\" one\nrespondent's school is in AACSB candidacy status and one is\nconsidering AACSB, two are accredited by IACBE (Interna-\ntional Assembly for Collegiate Business Education), and\nthree reported regional general accreditation only. Overall,\n79% of respondents work for schools either having or consid-\nering some sort of business accreditation--AACSB, ACBSP,\nor IACBE (Figure 3).\nInstitutional openness to faculty internships.With respect to\ninstitutional openness to faculty internships, 88% were open\nto faculty internships, either in the summer only or in the\nsummer as well as during the academic year. Surprisingly,\nthe majority (77%) of schools open to faculty internships\nwere also open to having faculty internships take place dur-\ning the academic year.\nFaculty Respondent Demographics\nSummary of faculty respondent demographics.Most faculty\nrespondents are full-time, senior-ranking teachers holding a\ndoctoral degree and at least one professional certification\n(most often a certified public accountant [CPA]). They have\ntaught accounting for at least 20 years. It has been 10 to 20\nyears since they practiced accounting, which the majority did\nfor 10 years at most. Despite the willingness on the part of\ntheir employer institutions to allow them to complete a\nfaculty internship, the desire on the part of the accounting\nprofession and academia's premier business school accredi-\ntation body for faculty internships to take place, and the mul-\ntitude of benefits that accrue from faculty internships, only a\nhandful of these faculty members have ever completed a fac-\nulty internship.\nTitle/rank, highest degree earned, and professional certification(s)\nheld.Most faculty respondents (92%) hold a senior-level\nrank (full or associate professor), with the majority (75%) of\nthese senior-ranking faculty holding the title of full profes-\nsor. Approximately 6% hold the title of assistant professor,\nand approximately 2% hold some other title. No respondents\nreported holding the title of instructor.\nMost faculty respondents (almost 83%) have earned a\ndoctoral degree. Almost 17% hold a master's-level degree;\nless than 1% hold a baccalaureate degree only.\nAlmost all (95%) of all responding faculty members are\nCPAs. Many hold multiple certifications, including CMA\n(certified management accountant), CFE (certified fraud\nexaminer), ABV/CVA (accredited business valuator/certified\nvaluation analyst), CIA (certified internal auditor), and oth-\ners, causing the sum of the results to exceed 100%.\nFull- or part-time position, teaching experience, and profes-\nsional experience.Almost all (98%) of responding faculty\nare full-time teachers. The majority (75%) of responding\nfaculty have been teaching accounting for more than 20\nyears, with two thirds of that majority having taught for\nFigure 3.Accreditation.\n6 SAGE Open\nOf those who have worked in the accounting profession,\nmost (81%) of the responding faculty have spent 10 or fewer\nyears in professional practice, with the majority (70%) of\nthose respondents having 5 or fewer years of professional\naccounting experience. Of the remaining 19%, almost half\n(47%) have 21 or more years of professional accounting\nApproximately 13% of our respondents have never\nworked in the accounting profession, but for the 87% that\nhave, the time that has passed since they left their profes-\nsional practice in accounting varies widely. For 37%, it has\nbeen more than 20 years since they left the accounting pro-\nfession. The largest group--43%--left the profession from 6\nto 20 years ago. Nine percent left from 0 to 5 years ago, and\n11% continue to work in the profession.\nHas an internship been completed,and reasons for not completing\nan internship. The investigation of the degree to which fac-\nulty internships are used in the accounting profession is one\nof the primary purposes of this research project. As revealed\nin the literature review, both the profession and the AACSB\nare strong proponents of faculty\u00adpractitioner engagement\nthrough internships. Accordingly, the responses to this ques-\ntion can either cause us to give accounting programs a\ncongratulatory pat on the back or a wake-up call to action.\nUnfortunately, in spite of the strong support for accounting\nfaculty internships in the profession and by AACSB, only\n19% of our faculty respondents have ever completed a fac-\nulty internship.\nFigure 4 shows the variety of reasons that surfaced for the\n81% of our faculty respondents who have not completed a\nfaculty internship. The most frequently stated reason is that\nthere is no professional benefit to completing one (29%), fol-\nlowed by the employer institution prefers faculty to do\nresearch (21%). Eighteen respondents (15%) indicated that\nthey could not get sabbatical time to do an internship, and\n11% responded that they could not find a sponsoring firm.\nWithin the \"other\" category, the most-often-given\nresponse was \"have never pursued one,\" followed by \"no\ntime\" and \"no opportunity.\" Additional responses included\nvariations on \"logistics\" (desired internship was too far\naway), \"no encouragement,\" \"not an option,\" \"not aware of\nan available program,\" and--most perplexing of all--\"Why\ndo one?\" It seems clear from the nature of these responses\nthat although faculty members may agree that there are ben-\nefits to completing a faculty internship, they are not con-\nvinced that these benefits outweigh the perceived costs.\nTo better understand who might be more likely to have com-\npleted an internship, a comparison of the demographic charac-\nteristics of the respondents and their schools was conducted but\nrevealed no significant differences between those respondents\nwho completed internships and those who did not.\nFigure 4. Reasons for not completing a faculty internship.\nChristopher et al. 7\nInternship Characteristics\nSummary of internship characteristics.Accounting faculty\ninternships were primarily sponsored by CPA firms of\nvarious sizes with only 14% by industry. Most of these\norganizations (66%) did not have a formal faculty intern-\nship program in place when approached by the faculty\nmember about sponsoring an internship. The kinds of work\nperformed were rich with variety, but clustered around\nexploiting the faculty intern's teaching area or strength,\nfollowed by working on special projects, problems, and/or\nteams (Figure 5). These emphases were most likely to take\nadvantage of specialized skills possessed by the faculty\nintern, or to have the faculty intern work on projects that\nthe sponsoring organization lacked the time to complete\notherwise.\nWhen internship was completed.Most (54%) of the faculty\ninternships were full-time internships completed during the\nacademic year, followed by summer internships (42%). Only\n4% of internships were part-time internships completed dur-\ning the academic year.\nHow internship site was selected. Several factors were consid-\nered by faculty respondents in choosing their internship sites.\nRespondents were allowed to choose multiple factors. Most\nimportant was the receptiveness of the internship sponsor\n(31%), followed by the kind of work that the faculty member\nwould be able to complete (24%). The internship location\n(22%) and availability of an internship at the desired time\n(20%) were roughly equal in importance. Other consider-\nations accounted for approximately 7%.\nThe majority (69%) of accounting faculty internships\nwere sponsored by CPA firms, with 60% of those firms being\n\"Big\" (8, 6, 5, or 4, depending on when the faculty member\nhad the internship) international firms, 30% being national or\nregional firms, and 10% being local firms. Industry provided\n14% of accounting faculty internships, followed by not-for-\nprofit institutions (10%) and governmental entities (7%).\nTwo thirds of these organizations did not have a formal fac-\nulty internship program in place when they sponsored the\nrespondents' internships.\nPerceived Benefits/Drawbacks Accruing From\nFaculty Internships\nThe analysis of faculty internship benefits and drawbacks are\nshown in this section at two levels. The first level shows the\n\"overall\" benefits/drawbacks perceived by the total respon-\ndent base. Each chart in this section is organized from top to\nbottom, with the highest \"overall\" agreement at the top and\nthe lowest \"overall\" agreement on the bottom of each chart.\nThis overall order shows the relative importance of each\nbenefit/drawback as perceived by the total sample.\nIt is also of interest to analyze the differences between\nfaculty who have actually completed an internship versus\nFigure 5. What kind of work did you do in your internship.\n8 SAGE Open\nthose who have not. Thus, the second level of analysis shown\non each chart indicates the split between those respondents\nwho have had a faculty internship and those who have not.\nThe actual significance level is shown only where the differ-\nences are significant at the 90% confidence level. All others\nare not significant at the 90% level. These results support the\nassertion that faculty members acknowledge and generally\nagree on the benefits and drawbacks of internships.\nFaculty development benefits. \"Faculty development\" refers to\nprofessional development, in the academic sense. Profes-\nsional development includes all types of facilitated learning\nopportunities, comprising formal coursework, conferences,\nand informal learning opportunities situated in practice and\nmentoring. It is often intensive and collaborative. As such,\nfor faculty members, faculty development goes beyond sim-\nply making one a more effective teacher because most fac-\nulty members' job descriptions include not only teaching but\nalso intellectual contributions/research and service.\nThe items that we categorized as faculty development\nbenefits seek to capture multiple facets of a faculty mem-\nber's job description, and are listed in Figure 6, which also\nshows differences in perception between those faculty who\nhave actually experienced an internship and those who have\nnot.\nAs can be seen, these results indicate that for most of the\nlisted items, our respondents either agree or strongly agree\nthat faculty internships provide the described faculty devel-\nopment benefits. It is interesting to note that the top benefits\nperceived center on gaining \"real-world\" and relevant, prac-\ntical experience that can then be brought back to the class-\nroom. While not all are significant, these attributes were seen\nto be directionally more important to those who have com-\npleted an internship versus those who have not. In fact, the\nonly significant difference in faculty development benefits\nwas the most important one: \"engage in relevant practical\naccounting experience.\"\nImprovement in teaching quality.This category of benefits\nhones in directly on improvements in a faculty member's\nability to deliver quality instruction in the classroom. The\nresults of our survey indicate that for most of the listed items,\nour respondents either agree or strongly agree that faculty\ninternships provide the indicated improvements in teaching\nquality. Figure 7 highlights that there is the greatest disagree-\nment on the part of faculty respondents about the benefits\nthat imply that a teacher might engage in a faculty internship\nmerely for personal or self-serving reasons such as making\nthe teacher more popular with students, improving the teach-\ner's course evaluations, or enhancing students' perception\nabout the teacher's teaching quality. While there are no sig-\nnificant differences between respondents who have had a\nfaculty internship and those who have not, those who have\nhad an internship consistently rate the benefits to\nFigure 6. Benefits of faculty internship to faculty development.\nChristopher et al. 9\nbe directionally higher. Overall, there is a generally strong\nconsensus about the other benefits to teaching quality that\naccrue from a faculty internship.\nAgain, as with faculty development benefits, measures\nrelated to keeping up to date are the most important. The two\nbenefits receiving the highest agreement were \"gain up-to-\ndate experiences to take back to the classroom\" and \"teach\nbeyond the textbook.\" Benefits such as \"enhance students'\nperception that I am a better teacher,\" \"increase the popular-\nity and attractiveness of my courses to students,\" and\n\"improve my course evaluations\" received very low benefit\nscores. It is comforting to note that neither respondent group\nperceives pleasing or appealing to students to be a strong\nbenefit of an internship.\nBenefits to other areas of faculty life.These benefits to the\nfaculty intern do not fit neatly into any other category, but\nnevertheless represent improvements in the faculty intern's\nenvironment. Examples include new career opportunities,\nenhanced respect, renewed enthusiasm, and a variety of\nbenefits, which accrue to the faculty intern's school and\ncolleagues. Though agreement about the items in this cate-\ngory is not as strong as it is for the other faculty benefit\ncategories, Figure 8 shows some agreement that faculty\ninternships provide additional personal and individual\nbenefits.\nWhile there are no significant differences among the ben-\nefits shown here, there are some interesting observations to\nbe made. First of all, it is notable that respondents with no\ninternship experience directionally perceive more benefit in\n\"fostering closer relationships\" and \"encouraging internship\nopportunities for other faculty members\" than do those who\nhave actually had an internship. The only \"significant\" dif-\nference is that those who have had an internship more\nstrongly agree with the statement \"gain enhanced respect\nfrom students, colleagues, and practitioners\" than those who\nhave not had an internship.\nBenefits to the sponsoring firm.Many of these benefits\naccrue to the sponsoring firm as a result of bringing in\n\"fresh blood\" and getting closer to potential future employ-\nees: \"faculty contact for future help with projects,\" \"helps\nfuture student employees better understand the firm/\naccounting profession,\" and \"increases firm's visibility to\nstudents.\" In addition, they see benefits in getting closer to\nacademia and in finding new ways to look at problems or\nissues: \"knowledgeable, hardworking, independent staff\nmember\"; \"independent observer\"; and \"recruiter for\nfuture accounting employees.\" The sponsoring firm gets a\nviewpoint from the outside, and the accounting faculty\nintern gets a look inside. There is general agreement about\nthese benefits, with a somewhat lower degree of agreement\non the idea that sponsoring firms will realize an expanded\npool of quality accounting graduates from which to recruit.\nFigure 9 shows a summary of the indicated benefits to\ninternship sponsors.\nFigure 7. Benefits of faculty internship to teaching quality.\nFigure 8. Benefits to other areas of faculty life.\nFigure 9. Benefits to the sponsoring firm.\nChristopher et al. 11\nWhile there is overall agreement that faculty internships\nare highly beneficial to sponsoring firms, there are more sig-\nnificant differences in this benefit category between those with\ninternship experience and those without than in any other cat-\negory. Those with internship experience agree more with the\nstatement \"provides hardworking staff member who can work\nindependently with little supervision.\" Respondents with no\ninternship experience more strongly perceive that internships\n\"helpthefirmandprofessiontoinfluenceacademia\";\"enhance\ndevelopment of firm's accounting staff resulting from faculty\nintern's questions, observations, and recommendations\" and\n\"expand quality and quantity of talent pool available to the\nprofession.\" These results suggest that those with internship\nexperience see the firm's benefits to be more internally focused\ncompared with those without an internship.\nPercentage responses for \"neither agree nor disagree\"\nranged from 45% for \"higher quality accounting students to\nrecruit\" to 17% for \"faculty contact for future help with proj-\nects.\" No \"disagree\" or \"strongly disagree\" percentage\nexceeded 11% (\"expands quality, quantity of talent pool\navailable to the profession\"), with all others ranging from\nDirect benefits to students. Though improvements in faculty\ninterns' teaching quality benefits students indirectly, this\nset of items provides direct benefits to students in the form\nof vicarious exposure to the sponsoring firm, increased stu-\ndent internship opportunities, better career advising and\ncounsel, enhanced interest in the accounting profession,\nand a more practical education in general. As with other\nbenefit categories, there is general agreement among fac-\nulty respondents with respect to these benefits to students.\nFigure 10 shows a summary of perceived faculty internship\nbenefits to students.\nResponses in the \"neither agree nor disagree\" category\nwere the next largest for all student benefits, ranging from\n34% for \"enhanced interest and motivation to join the profes-\nsion\" to 12% for \"better career advising and counsel in career\nopportunities.\" Percentages for the \"disagree\" and \"strongly\ndisagree\" categories ranged from 1% to 7%.\nSummary of faculty internship benefits. With very few excep-\ntions, faculty respondents are, on average, in general agree-\nment that faculty internships provide a wide range of worthy\nbenefits to a variety of stakeholder groups. It is hard to envi-\nsion another activity that provides a better way to achieve\nsuch a wide array of benefits.\nFaculty Internship Drawbacks\nVery few drawbacks are mentioned in the literature relative\nto faculty internships. Those mentioned relate generally to\nFigure 10. Benefits of faculty internship to students.\nthe faculty intern personally, rather than to other stake-\nholder groups. These drawbacks include feeling as though\nthe faculty intern is imposing upon the internship sponsor,\nthat the faculty intern's performance evaluations will not\nadequately acknowledge the value of the faculty internship,\nthat learning from former students will be awkward, that\nthe faculty intern's workday freedoms will be imposed\nupon, and that the faculty intern will have to travel more.\nFaculty respondents are in general agreement that these\ndrawbacks do exist with only one exception--a feeling of\nawkwardness arising from having former students as teach-\ners. However, when we considered the responses to our\nquestion as to why respondents had not pursued a faculty\ninternship, the absence of mention of any of the drawbacks\nincluded in this set of items leads us to believe that even\nthough these drawbacks exist, they would be considered\nvery minor, and not so offensive as to preclude a faculty\nmember from pursuing an internship. Figure 11 shows a\ncomparison of perceived drawbacks of a faculty internship\nbetween those who had an internship to those who did not\nhave an internship.\nIn support of our assertion that these drawbacks are con-\nsidered to be rather minor, our respondents' level of agree-\nment is lower, in general, than with their level of agreement\nwith the various categories of benefits. In addition, the level\nof disagreement with the drawbacks is higher than with any\nof the benefit categories. The most important overall per-\nceived drawbacks are related to time and work schedule fac-\ntors. However, these issues seem to be more perception than\nreality. Respondents with no internship experience were sig-\nnificantly more concerned with these issues than those who\nhave had an internship.\nTo summarize, though our respondents acknowledged\nthat the list of drawbacks does exist, our survey results imply\nthat these drawbacks, even when taken as a whole, would not\nnecessarily preclude a faculty member from pursuing an\ninternship, if that were the faculty member's desire.\nConclusion\nWe performed a descriptive statistical analysis, and tabu-\nlated the combined results of all of our demographic and\nperceived benefits/drawbacks data collected on accounting\nfaculty internships based on the observations made in a vari-\nety of case studies both within and outside of the accounting\nprofession. This study suggests that all accounting faculty\nmembers acknowledge and generally agree on the benefits\nand drawbacks of internships. Results indicate that, regard-\nless of institutional size, existence of business accreditation,\nor individual faculty characteristics, there is a general con-\nsensus that faculty internships are of significant value to a\nvariety of stakeholders, and that there are negligible\nFigure 11. Drawbacks of a faculty internship.\nChristopher et al. 13\ndrawbacks associated with faculty internships. These are\nconsistent with and provide additional support for prior case\nstudies, and suggest that benefits can be gained from engag-\ning in an appropriate faculty internship, regardless of the\nfaculty member's individual situation. Faculty internships\nprovide a variety of opportunities to enhance existing skills,\ndevelop new skills, apply skills to new problems, expand\nresearch avenues, and enhance the operations of sponsoring\nfirms. With all of the perceived and acknowledged potential\nfor accounting faculty internships to add value in so many\nways, it is alarming to discover that so few of these intern-\nships have actually taken place. The results of this study\nshould serve as a wake-up call to the accounting academy\nthat a simple and effective means to bridge the perceived\ngap between accounting practitioners and academics is\nbeing grossly underutilized.\nRecommendations for Future Research\nOne of the prime benefits of this study is to reveal areas of\nfuture research that would result in greater use of faculty\ninternships to the benefit of all stakeholder groups and bridge\nthe practitioner\u00adacademic gap. Some possibilities for future\nresearch include further investigation into the reasons why\nschools do not promote and facilitate accounting faculty\ninternships more aggressively, the reasons why accounting\nfaculty members are not more enthusiastic about initiating\nand pursuing faculty internships, and methods for encourag-\ning greater use of faculty internships to enhance the value of\naccounting education and this critical link to the accounting\nprofession. The same questions may be directed toward the\naccounting profession to consider utilizing and inviting aca-\ndemics to collaborate within their organizations. In the same\nway that internship opportunities for students are established,\nare there--or shouldn't there be--similar opportunities for\nprofessors?\nAdditional research could be conducted to better under-\nstand the types of schools that place a higher value on intern-\nships. Are these the schools that are mission-designated as\n\"teaching\" schools, rather than \"research\" schools? Are they\nschools with firmly established recruiting relationships with\npublic accounting firms or other types of business?\nAnother avenue of research could investigate the nature\nof satisfaction that is derived from a faculty internship. Is it\nthat the intern gets to complete certain tasks that are attrac-\ntive, such as engaging in current problem-solving, training\nfirm employees in new theoretical methods, becoming\nskilled at implementing state-of-the-art methods; is it that a\nbreak in the routine of academia to join the \"real world\" is a\nwelcome change; or is it that the intern gets to become the\nstudent? In other words, which benefits are of the most value\nand provide the most satisfaction to interns?\nCompensation of interns and the options utilized could\nalso be explored. What types of compensation are received by\nfaculty interns? Do all faculty interns receive compensation?\nHow does the compensation received by interns compare\nwith that received from a typical consulting engagement? Are\nwould-be faculty interns engaging in consulting as opposed to\ninternships?\nFaculty internships and additional faculty\u00adpractitioner\nrelationships in other disciplines should be investigated to\nlearn how these other disciplines facilitate the process of\ncreating, implementing, and exploiting faculty internships.\nIdentifying ways to make the viability and attractiveness of\nfaculty internships more visible to stakeholder groups is\ncritical if this valuable tool is to be used as it should be to\nassist in reconnecting academia and the accounting\nprofession.\nAppendix A\nSurvey\nWhat is the size of your university?\nHow many accounting majors attend your university?\nWhat is the average enrollment size for an accounting class\nsection?\nWhat is the size of your accounting faculty?\n 1-10 accounting faculty members\n More than 40 accounting faculty members\nWhat accreditation does your business/accounting program\nhold?
