Because of its potential effects on gastric leptin\nhomeostasis, Helicobacter pylori may play a role in regulating body weight. The authors' aim in this study was to\nexamine the association between H. pylori colonization and overweight status. Nonpregnant participants in the\n  (1988\u00ad1994) aged 20 years who had had H. pylori testing\nperformed and body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2) measured were studied. Overweight was defined as\nabody mass indexgreater thanor equalto 25. On thebasis of serologic results, the participants were categorized into\nthree H. pylori status groups: H. pylori-positive and cytotoxin-associated gene A (cagA)-positive (H. pylori\u00fecagA\u00fe),\nH. pylori-positive and cagA-negative (H. pylori\u00fecagA\u00ff), and H. pylori-negative (H. pylori\u00ff). Of the 7,003 subjects\nwith complete body mass index and H. pylori data, 2,634 (weighted percentage, 22.9%) were H. pylori\u00fecagA\u00fe,\ninterval: 0.80, 1.22; p \u00bc 0.92) for the H. pylori\u00fecagA\u00ff group in comparison with H. pylori\u00ff subjects. Serum leptin\nlevels did not differ significantly between the three H. pylori groups. In this US population-based study, there was\nno significant association between H. pylori colonization, cagA\u00fe strains of H. pylori, and being overweight.\nbody mass index; body weight; cagA protein, Helicobacter pylori; Helicobacter pylori; obesity\nAbbreviations: cagA, cytotoxin-associated gene A; NHANES III,  .\nObesity is a significant and growing public health prob-\nlem in the United States (1). More than 60 percent of the US\nadult population is considered either overweight or obese (2),\nsity (3), making it the second leading cause of preventable\ndeath in the United States (4).\nLeptin is a protein secreted by fat cells that plays a role in\nthe regulation of body weight through effects on food intake\n(5). Serum leptin levels show a positive linear relation with\nbody mass index (6). Leptin is also produced by chief cells\nin the human stomach, and levels are affected by Helico-\nbacter pylori-associated gastritis (7, 8). H. pylori are gram-\nnegative bacteria that colonize the human stomach and\nincrease the risk of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer\n(9, 10). Gastric inflammation is highest with cytotoxin-\nassociated gene A (cagA) strains of H. pylori (11, 12). Much\nevidence indicates that H. pylori is an ancient colonizer of\nhumans (13, 14) that is highly prevalent in developing coun-\ntries but is disappearing in developed countries, including\nthe United States (15). This change in the microecology of\nhuman populations may have metabolic consequences and,\nin particular, could affect risk of obesity by influencing\ngastric leptin production (16). We hypothesized that coloni-\nzation with H. pylori, particularly cagA strains, is associated\nwith a decreased body mass index.

The weighted dis-\ntribution of participants was similar to that of the US\npopulation as a whole. The survey protocol was reviewed\nand approved by an institutional review board at the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, and all participants\nprovided written informed consent.\nH. pylori status was ascertained only in phase 1 of\nNHANES III. There were 8,442 participants in this phase\nof the study who were aged 20 years and were interviewed\nand examined. Pregnant women (n \u00bc 138), persons belong-\ning to the race/ethnicity category ``other'' (n \u00bc 261), and\npersons with equivocal H. pylori serologic results and neg-\native cagA assays (n \u00bc 78) were excluded. Of the remaining\nmeasurements and H. pylori testing.\nStudy design\nThe NHANES III staff conducted surveys in households,\nadministered questionnaires, and conducted standardized\nmedical examinations at mobile examination centers at a\nsingle visit. Criteria for overweight status were established\naccording to published National Heart, Lung, and Blood\nInstitute guidelines (4). Body mass index was calculated as\nweight (kg) divided by height squared (m2). H. pylori testing\nwas performed using a commercial immunoglobulin G\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Wampole Laborato-\nries, Cranbury, New Jersey). Each 96-well plate contained\nthe manufacturer's three cutoff controls (negative, high pos-\nitive, and low positive) and three positive and two negative\ncontrols provided by the testing laboratory. For each speci-\nmen, an immune status ratio was calculated by dividing the\nspecimen absorbance by the mean absorbance of the three\ncutoff controls. Specimens were considered negative if the\nimmune status ratio was 0\u00ad0.90, equivocal if the immune\nstatus ratio was 0.91\u00ad1.09, and positive if the immune status\nratio was greater than or equal to 1.10. Results were vali-\ndatedusingcodedreplicatesampleswiththelaboratorywork-\ners blinded as to status (17). Serologic testing for cagA was\ndone using a noncommercial assay developed and standard-\nized at Vanderbilt University, as previously described (12).\nFasting serum leptin levels were examined using a radio-\nimmunoassay with a polyclonal antibody raised in rabbits\nagainst highly purified recombinant human leptin (Linco\nResearch, Inc., St. Louis, Missouri) (18). The minimum de-\ntectable leptin concentration of the assay was 0.5 lg/liter,\nand intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were less\nVariable definitions\nThe primary outcome variable, overweight, was defined\nas a body mass index greater than or equal to 25, and normal\nweight was defined as a body mass index less than 25.\nH. pylori serologic test results were categorized as positive,\nnegative, or equivocal, and cagA serologic results were cat-\negorized as positive or negative. On the basis of H. pylori\nand cagA results, patients were classified into three groups:\nH. pylori-positive and cagA-positive (H. pylori\u00fecagA\u00fe),\nH. pylori-positive and cagA-negative (H. pylori\u00fecagA\u00ff),\nand H. pylori-negative (H. pylori\u00ff). The H. pylori\u00fecagA\u00fe\ngroup included all persons with a positive cagA assay regard-\nless of the results of the H. pylori assay, based on the utility\nof the cagA antigen in detecting true-positive responses in\nculture-positive persons in the face of negative or equivocal\nvalues in the H. pylori serologic assay (19). All persons in the\nH. pylori\u00ff group had negative cagA assays. Demographic\nvariables (age, sex, race/ethnicity, country of birth, geo-\ngraphic location) and lifestyle variables (years of education,\n3.50), cigarette smoking history, alcohol drinking history,\nand activity level) were considered in these analyses.\nStatistical methods\nCharacteristics of overweight and normal-weight partic-\nipants were compared using the F test (20) for categorical\nvariables and the two-sample t test for continuous variables,\nwith adjustments for the stratified sampling design of\nNHANES III. Odds ratios and 95 percent confidence in-\ntervals for the association between H. pylori and being\noverweight were estimated using multivariable logistic\nregression models with and without adjustment for other\ncovariates. The covariates included in the models were those\nsignificantly associated with overweight in the univariate\nanalyses (p  0.05). The final model was developed using\na stepwise procedure with forward selection and backward\nelimination, with both inclusion and exclusion criteria set at\nthe significance level of p  0.05.\nIn an additional exploratory analysis, we evaluated the\nassociation between H. pylori and leptin levels in 2,648\nparticipants in whom serum leptin levels had been mea-\nsured. Median leptin levels were compared between the\nthree H. pylori groups. In addition, Spearman correlation\ncoefficients for correlations between body mass index and\nleptin levels were calculated within each of the three\nH. pylori groups.\nAll analyses incorporated sampling weights that adjusted\nfor the complex survey design of NHANES III. A two-sided\np value less than or equal to 0.05 was considered statisti-\ncally significant. The software packages Stata SE 8.2 (Stata\nCorporation, College Station, Texas), and SAS 9.0 (SAS\nInstitute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) were used for data\nanalysis.\nTABLE 1.

While unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for over-\nweight status in the H. pylori\u00fecagA\u00fe group compared with\nthe H. pylori\u00ff group were greater than 1.0, this association\nwas not statistically significant after adjustment for poten-\ntially confounding variables. A similar relation was found\nfor the H. pylori\u00fecagA\u00ff group. To examine the possible\neffects of H. pylori on serum leptin levels, we compared\nserum leptin levels among the groups that differed with re-\ngard to H. pylori status. In the unadjusted analysis, serum\nleptin levels were slightly higher in the H. pylori\u00fecagA\u00fe and\nH. pylori\u00fecagA\u00ff groups than in the H. pylori\u00ff group, but\nthese differences were not clinically meaningful.\nSerum leptin, which is primarily synthesized by adipose\ntissue, regulates food intake and body weight homeostasis\n(21). Leptin is now known to be synthesized in the stomach\nas well (22), and this source may also be involved in the\nregulation of food intake and satiety (23). Gastric inflamma-\ntion, such as that induced by H. pylori (10), alters leptin\nsecretion in the stomach. The change in gastric leptin level\nresulting from H. pylori-induced inflammation may influ-\nence food intake and body mass index. Azuma et al. (8)\nreported that eradication of H. pylori is associated with de-\ncreased gastric leptin levels and subsequent weight gain,\nalthough serum leptin levels did not change. Furuta et al.\n(24) found that H. pylori eradication was associated with\nincreases in body mass index and cholesterol and triglycer-\nide levels. Our results are consistent with those of prior stud-\nies showing that H. pylori colonization does not alter serum\nleptin levels (8, 25). In addition, our findings agree with\nthose of several smaller studies that have found no associ-\nation between H. pylori colonization and risk of obesity\nOne of the strengths of this study was our use of the da-\ntabase from NHANES III, a large, national, cross-sectional\nsurvey specifically developed to accurately represent the\nadult population in the United States. In addition, we con-\ntrolled for multiple covariates that could have confounded\ninterpretation of the results. However, there were several\nlimitations of our study. Since the study was cross-sectional\nand both H. pylori colonization and overweight are chronic\nconditions, a specific causative relation between the two may\nnot necessarily be inferred. In addition, the serum samples\nthat were tested for the leptin assays were excess samples\nthat remained after the required laboratory tests for\nNHANES III had been completed; thus, selection of the\nsamples did not follow any statistical sampling strategy.\nHowever, statistical analyses directed towards the assess-\nment of biases that might have been introduced into the sub-\nset of participants with leptin measurements were negative.\nAlthough serum leptin level does not appear to be affected by\nH. pylori colonization, other gut peptide hormones that af-\nfect metabolism may play a role in the regulation of body\nweight. Ghrelin has also been implicated in the control of\nfood intake and energy homeostasis, with effects opposite\nthose of leptin (28). After H. pylori eradication, plasma\nghrelin levels have been observed to increase by 75 percent\nover pretreatment levels, suggesting that eradication may\ncontribute to increased appetite and weight gain (29). Be-\ncause ghrelin levels were not measured in NHANES III, they\ncould not be investigated in this study.\nIn summary, in this large, US population-based study, we\nfound that there was no significant relation between H. pylori\nstatus, cagA status, and being overweight, after adjusting for\nconfounding covariates. Our findings suggest that future\nstudies of relations involving H. pylori and alterations of\nmetabolism homeostasis might focus on interactions with\nother gut peptide hormones in colonized persons.\n"
