Attempts to assess the\neffectiveness of Medicaid expansions and other reforms are hampered by the lack of reliable state-level\ndata on this population. This DataWatch presents baseline statistics on the insurance status of\nsharpest increase in uninsured rates from 1987 to 1989 among middle-class children and among\nchildren ages seven to twenty-one, suggesting that expanding Medicaid will fail to reach a large\nportion of the population at greatest risk.\nIn the United States approximately twelve million children are unin-\nsured. Children who do not have health insurance have diminished\naccess to the health care system, use fewer health services, and are more\nlikely to have adverse health outcomes.1 Recent Medicaid expansions have\nbeen designed to help states to reduce the large numbers of children without\nhealth insurance. One major obstacle faced by state policymakers in assess-\ning performance of the expansions and other reforms has been the lack of\naccurate state-level data on uninsured children.\nPrevious attempts to estimate the number of uninsured children by state\nhave met with limited success. Several reports that have used the Current\nPopulation Survey (CPS) to estimate states' uninsured rates are problem-\natic.2 First, because the CPS was designed to provide national estimates,\nmany such reports yielded imprecise state estimates, especially for smaller\nstates. Second, reports that combined several years of CPS data to increase\nstate sample sizes did not measure the precision of those estimates.3\nThis DataWatch describes a methodology for pooling three years of CPS\ndata, provides more accurate baseline statistics on the uninsured child\npopulation for each state, and tests the precision of those estimates. State\nand national estimates of uninsured children by age and poverty level are\npresented. Our findings indicate that (1) the percentage of uninsured\nchildren continues to increase, (2) the percentage of middle-class (family\nincome greater than 185 percent of the federal poverty level) uninsured\nJenifer Cartland is a research analyst and Beth Yudhowsky is director in the Division of Research\non Health Policy, American Academy of Pediatrics, in Elk Grove Village, Illinois.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Since 1942 the Bureau of the Census has conducted\nthe CPS each month to estimate the number of employed and unemployed\nindividuals. Since 1980 the March survey has included a supplement that\nqueries subjects about health insurance coverage during the previous calen-\ndar year. Because of the CPS's small sample size for many states, pooling\nmultiple years of data is one strategy for computing state-level demographic\nand economic characteristics.4 Hence, to circumvent the small sample\nproblem in the current study, we employed a similar strategy, pooling three\nyears of CPS March supplement data into one data set.5\nWe attempted to identify any national trends that would indicate that\nthe pooled estimates are overestimates because they do not fully take into\naccount the effects of the Medicaid expansions implemented during the\nperiod under study. National estimates of the percentage of children who\nare uninsured were computed for each age and income group potentially\naffected by the expansions: infants, young children, and older children,\nwith family incomes less than or equal to 100 percent, 185 percent, and\nmore than 185 percent of the federal poverty level. No trends that might be\nattributable to the Medicaid expansions were apparent.\nComputing uninsured rates. In this study the uninsured population is\ndefined in the same way that the Census Bureau defines it for March\nsupplements conducted after 1987. If a child is covered by any private,\nemployer-sponsored, or public (Medicaid) insurance, whether that insur-\nanee is provided by someone inside or outside of the household, that child\nis considered insured. As a result of apparent contradictions in CPS report-\ning for children, other methods of imputing insurance status have been\ndeveloped. For example, the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI)\nconsiders a child to have private health insurance coverage if the head of\nhousehold has private insurance and the child's coverage comes from\nsomeone residing in the household.6 EBRI also considers a child insured if\nhe or she receives outside financial assistance and coverage comes from\nsomeone not in the household. In addition, all active military personnel\nand their families are excluded from EBRI's analysis. We use the Census\nBureau methods because they err on the conservative side and are consis-\ntent with commonly used estimates of insurance status. Family income is\nderived from the total family income variable computed by the Census\nBureau, which includes all sources of income.\nLimitations.

The precision of particular estimates\ncan be determined either by examining the sample size or by computing the\nstandard error, the latter being the more accurate indicator.7\nIncrease And Variation In Number Of Uninsured Children\nIn 1989 almost twelve million children in the United States were unin-\nsured (Exhibit 1). This represents an increase of 600,000 children since\n1987. Nearly two-thirds of the increase is attributable to children between\nthe ages of seven and twenty-one.

First, the number\nof uninsured children continues to climb: In only two years, the number of\nuninsured children increased by 600,000. Of these children, two-thirds are\nbetween the ages of seven and twenty-one.\nGrowing middle-class problem. Second, the percentage of middle-class\nchildren who are uninsured is increasing. The number of uninsured middle-\nin 1989. All age groups of middle-class children experienced a similar\nincrease in their uninsured rate. It seems clear that the reduced availability\nof health insurance is no longer a problem just for the poor.\nThis finding has profound policy implications. Although Medicaid has\nbeen expanded substantially, the protection it now provides helps only very\nyoung and very poor children. The income eligibility threshold signifi-\ncantly limits the relief that it can provide children of the working poor and\nmiddle class. Moreover, because of the slow phase-in of the eligibility\nexpansion (the phase-in of children through age eighteen is scheduled to be\ncompleted by 2002), scant protection is available now to older children. By\naccelerating the Medicaid expansion phase-in process, immediate relief\ncould be provided to the poorest of these older children. However, even if\nsuch an acceleration is enacted, children--infants and older children\nalike--in working poor and middle-class families would remain vulnerable.\nDramatic state variation. Finally, the extent of the insurance crisis\nvaries dramatically by state and region, revealing that the nature of the\ninsurance crisis may vary as well. For example, children in the northern and\neastern parts of the country fare better than children in the western and\nsouthern regions. This may be due to the fact that southern and western\nstates have large agricultural sectors and that agricultural workers are far less\nlikely than manufacturing workers to gain insurance through employment.8\nIn many states the percentage of uninsured middle-class children is three\ntimes higher than it is in other states. These examples indicate that the\ndepth of the insurance crisis for children appears to be related to fundamen-\ntal characteristics of states' economies. If this is the case, federal reforms\nthat aim to support states' efforts to address the problem of the uninsured\nmust consider states' unique economic challenges and policy capacities.\nWith tight federal budgets, some federal lawmakers appear to prefer that\nstates play the major role in reform. However, federal leadership is still\nrequired. Because of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act's\n(ERISA's) preemption of self-insured employers from state mandates, fed-\neral Medicaid income eligibility limits, and other federal stumbling blocks,\nstates are restricted in their capacity to address the growing problems these\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Without federal reform and support, states are un-\nlikely to hold the key to universal insurance coverage for children.\nOur findings permit each state to obtain comparable baseline informa-\ntion from which to measure progress in reducing uninsured rates among\nchildren. They also may be used to target future insurance reforms by states\nand the federal government. However, without more aggressive national\nleadership, new reforms are likely to result in the continuation of state\ndisparities in lack of health insurance coverage for children and mounting\nimpediments to adequate access to health services for this vulnerable group.\nThis study was funded in part by the corporate members of the American Academy of Pediatrics\n(AAP) Friends of Children Fund and the Bureau of Maternal and Child Health.
