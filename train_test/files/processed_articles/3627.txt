EMTs undergoing routine training took part in a simulation using\nmannequins. Parameters including compression depth, total number and rate of compressions;\noccurrence of incorrect hand position and incomplete chest recoil were collected over 16 2-min\ncycles of CPR (32 min total), with EMTs working in pairs.\nResult: The simulation study included 43 EMTs. The median duration of on-scene CPR was\n3.7 min. Fear of decrease in performance was the main obstacle to continued CPR (n \u00bc 188/254\n[74.0%]). Standards for high-quality CPR were met at each of the 16 steps of the simulation.\nCompression rate increased significantly with time. There were no significant changes in any other\nparameter.\nConclusion: Pairs of EMTs maintained high-quality CPR for 16 cycles (32 min) with no decrease in\nperformance. Our findings could provide evidence to recommend guidelines for duration of on-\nscene CPR for cardiac arrest, particularly in countries where the level and number of ambulance\ncrews are limited.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nimr.sagepub.com\n1Department of Emergency Medicine, Inje University\nCollege of Medicine and Seoul Paik Hospital, Seoul,\nRepublic of Korea\n2Department of Emergency Medicine, Ajou University\nCollege of Medicine and Ajou University Hospital, Suwon,\nRepublic of Korea\n3Department of Emergency Medicine, Samsung Medical\nCentre, Seoul, Republic of Korea\n4Department of Emergency Medicine, Dongguk University\nCollege of Medicine and Dongguk University Ilsan\nHospital, Ilsan, Republic of Korea\nCorresponding author:\nGi Woon Kim, Department of Emergency Medicine, Ajou\nUniversity Hospital, San 5, Wonchon-dong, Yeongtong-Gu,\nEmails: flyingguy0202@daum.net; flyingguy@aju.ac.kr\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page\n(https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n",

The quality of CPR is\ndetermined by six factors: compression\ndepth, compression rate, accurate location,\nfull chest recoil, minimization of interrup-\ntions, and adequate ventilation\n(Figure 1).1\u00ad4 Bystanders and emergency\nmedical technicians (EMTs) may perform\nCPR on patients with out-of-hospital car-\ndiac arrest. In the case of bystanders, the\naction of performing CPR has been empha-\nsized over its quality.5\u00ad8 EMTs, however, are\nexpected to perform high-quality CPR for a\nsufficient length of time, with the aim of\nachieving the return of spontaneous circu-\nlation (ROSC). Studies have indicated that\nCPR quality may decrease over time.9\u00ad13\nThe out-of-hospital cardiac arrest sur-\nvival rate in the Republic of Korea is\n3.3% for patients with cardiac aetiology.14\nFigure 1. Components of high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\nIn addition, the rate of prehospital ROSC\nfollowing EMT treatment is only $1%,14\npossibly due to the short duration of CPR\nprovided by EMTs at the scene (mean\nduration, 7 min).15 This is not sufficient to\nachieve prehospital ROSC, which is a major\nsurvival factor in out-of-hospital cardiac\nThe aim of the present study was twofold.\nFirst, we carried out a survey of EMTs to\ndetermine the duration of and obstacles to\nprolonged on-scene CPR. Secondly, we\nperformed a simulation study to establish\nfor how long a pair of EMTs can provide\nhigh-quality CPR.\nPatients and methods\nSurvey\nAn e-mail questionnaire comprising 27 items\nregarding EMT demographics, CPR dur-\nation at the scene and obstacles to CPR\ncontinuation was conducted with intermedi-\nate-level EMTs in Gyeonggi-do Province,\nRepublic of Korea. Gyeonggi-do Province is\nintermediate-level EMTs and 221 ambu-\nlances, which transport a mean of 14.2\npatients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest\nper day (mean total, 834 patients per day).\nThe emergency medical service in the\nRepublic of Korea is similar to an inter-\nmediate-level emergency transport service in\nthe USA, in that each ambulance is staffed\nby two or three EMTs. All EMTs can\nprovide basic life support with an automated\nexternal defibrillator (AED) and a trauma\nresuscitation kit.\nSimulation study\nStudy design. The study included EMTs with\n1 or 2 years' experience who volunteered\nwhile attending a training course for high-\nquality CPR at the Gyeonggi-do Province\nEmergency Medical Education Academy,\nSuwon, Republic of Korea. The general\npurpose of the study was explained to the\nsubjects while blinding the specific study\nprocess, data for collection and study\nresults. No ethical approval was required\nbecause the study was performed during\nroutine formal EMT education.\nLaerdal Resusci Anne Skill Station\n(Laerdal Medical, Orpington, Kent, UK)\nmannequins were prepared and connected\nto the Laerdal Skill reporting system\n(Laerdal Medical) with both storage and\nprintout functions. Compression depth and\naccuracy were shown visually. CPR was\nperformed by teams of two EMTs who\nwere briefed on a megaventricular fibrilla-\ntion scenario in which a 62-year-old man\nwith diabetes and hypertension (living in an\n18th floor apartment) called EMTs because\nof chest pain, who then arrived at the scene\nto find the man unconscious. The scenario\nwas prepared in advance and comprised 16\nsteps. Step 1 involved patient recognition\n(checking response, respiration and pulse),\nchest compressions during AED charging,\nand initial external defibrillation (followed\nimmediately by chest compressions for 2 min\nby one EMT and laryngeal mask airway\ninsertion by the other). Steps 2\u00ad16 each\ninvolved external defibrillation, followed by\n2 min uninterrupted chest compressions by\none EMT and positive-pressure ventilation\nwith a back-valve mask by the other. The\ntwo EMTs reversed roles at the end of each\nstep, so that each performed eight 2-min\ncycles of CPR for a total of 32 min\n(Figure 2).\nInvestigators acted as family members to\nsimulate a genuine out-of-hospital cardiac\narrest scenario, crying out and gesturing, in\norder to stress the EMTs, who gave pre-\npared replies to these `family members'.\nData collection. Data regarding work experi-\nence, age, height and weight of the EMTs\nwere collected. Compression depth, total\nnumber and rate of compressions, and\noccurrence of incorrect hand position and\nincomplete chest recoil were collected using\nthe Laerdal Skill reporting system. After the\nsimulation, subjects completed a survey\nregarding the point at which they felt\nfatigued and that CPR quality was affected,\nand perceived obstacles to continuation of\nCPR (both in the field and in the simulation\nsetting).\nStatistical analyses. Data were expressed as\nmean \u00c6 SD, median (interquartile range) or\nmedian (range). Between-sex differences in\nCPR performance were analysed using\nStudent's t-test or 2-test, as appropriate.\nThe general estimating equation model was\nused to adjust CPR data for age, sex, EMT\nlevel (basic or intermediate), and body mass\nindex (BMI), and between-timepoint ana-\nlyses of CPR data were made using a\nmultivariate linear regression model. CPR\ndata from the 16 cycles were grouped into\nfour stages (four cycles per stage) and tem-\nporal changes in CPR quality were analysed\nusing multivariate regression. All statistical\nanalyses were performed using SPSS\u00d5 ver-\nsion 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. P-values < 0.05 were considered\nstatistically significant.\nResults\nSurvey\nThe survey was completed by 254 EMTs.\nThe median duration of on-scene CPR was\ntwo cycles (range 0\u00ad10 cycles).

The standards of\nhigh-quality CPR (as shown in Figure 1)\nwere met at each of the 16 steps.\nCompression rate significantly increased\nwith time (P \u00bc 0.001), but there were no\nsignificant changes in any other parameter.\nThere were no changes in any parameter\nover time when data were grouped into four\nstages of four steps each (Table 2).\nData regarding CPR parameters strati-\nfied according to sex are shown in Table 3.\nCompression depth and the incidence of\nincomplete chest recoil were significantly\nFigure 2.

In\nmany parts of the USA, paramedics perform\nCPR at the scene until the patient achieves\nspontaneous ROSC;19 if ROSC is not\nachieved, health care providers terminate\nresuscitation and declare death at the\nscene.20 In many European countries, doc-\ntors travel on board ambulances and treat\ncardiac arrest patients for the required time\nbased on their judgement.21\nIn the Republic of Korea and other Asian\ncountries (including Malaysia, Japan,\nSingapore, and Taiwan), doctors do not\ntravel on board ambulances and EMTs are\nnot legally qualified to declare the death of a\npatient. EMTs may only provide basic life\nsupport, and use AEDs for rhythm analysis\nand defibrillation in patients with cardiac\narrest. Unlike in the USA and Europe, the\nprotocol in Asia allows for the provision of\nCPR at the scene for a relatively short\nperiod of time, followed by transport to\nhospital with ongoing CPR.17 The mean\nduration of on-scene CPR in the Republic of\nKorea is 7.6 min,15 which is shorter than in\nthe US, Europe, and other Asian coun-\nCPR duration of 3.7 min.\nA shorter duration of on-scene CPR\nsignificantly affects survival, as well as the\nlikelihood of good cerebral recovery.16 It is\ndifficult to provide high-quality CPR during\nTable 1.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) parameters over time, as performed by 23 pairs of EMTs\npresent study. Unlike concerns regarding\nlegal issues, adequate training and education\ncan correct this misconception. This simu-\nlation study found no such decrease in CPR\nquality over time could help to dispel this\nmyth. CPR performance parameters (com-\npression depth, compression rate, hand pos-\nition and chest recoil) satisfied the standards\nfor high-quality CPR for 32 min in the\npresent study. Our findings clearly show\nthat pairs of EMTs working together are\nfully capable of providing high-quality CPR\nfor 32 minutes. Further studies with a longer\ntime period, involving EMTs of varied\nphysical fitness levels, are required to deter-\nmine the maximum duration of CPR that\ncan be provided.\nOur findings could provide evidence to\nrecommend guidelines for duration of on-\nscene CPR for patients with cardiac arrest,\nparticularly in Asian countries where the\nlevel and number of ambulance crews are\nlimited. These data may also assist EMTs in\nthe USA and Europe, to determine whether\nto call for backup.\nThis study had several limitations. First,\nthis was a simulation study conducted on the\nfloor using mannequins. Although stress\nand distraction from a patient's family\nmembers were simulated by the actions of\ninvestigators, it was not possible to replicate\nall conditions and scenarios. Secondly,\nbecause all subjects participated in the simu-\nlation study simultaneously and were able to\nwatch each other's performance they had\nopportunities to correct their own perform-\nance and experimental bias cannot be ruled\nout. Thirdly, the fixed duration of the simu-\nlation study (32 min) meant that it was\nimpossible to determine the point at which\nperformance would deteriorate. However,\n30 min of on-scene CPR is generally con-\nsidered the maximum,29\u00ad31 and we believe\nthat our findings can effectively be applied to\nreal-world situations. Finally, this study\nused teams of two EMTs, which does not\nnecessarily reflect reality. In some countries,\nTable 2.
