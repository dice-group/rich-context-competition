Zaslavsky, Lin Ding, and John Z. Ayanian\nThe association of psychosocial stress with weight gain may have important implications for clinical practice and\nworkplace and public health interventions. To determine whether multiple domains of psychosocial stress were\nassociated with weight gain from 1995 to 2004, the authors analyzed a nationally representative longitudinal cohort\nof 1,355 men and women in the United States. Change in body mass index was assessed for multiple domains of\npsychosocial stress related to work, personal relationships, life constraints, and finances, controlling for other\nfactors associated with weight gain. All analyses were stratified by sex and weighted to account for the complex\nsurvey design. Among men with high baseline body mass index, weight gain was associated with increasing levels\nof psychosocial stress related to job-related demands (P < 0.001 for interaction with baseline body mass index),\nAmong women with high baseline body mass index, weight gain was associated with job-related demands\n(P < 0.001 for interaction with baseline body mass index), perceived constraints in life (P < 0.001), strain in\nrelations with family (P \u00bc 0.016), and difficulty paying bills (P \u00bc 0.010). Interventions to address psychosocial\nstress may limit weight gain among overweight and obese men and women.\nbody mass index; longitudinal studies; obesity; overweight; stress, psychological; weight gain\nAbbreviation: MIDUS, Midlife in the United States.\nPsychosocial stress has been implicated as a risk factor\nfor high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and cancer\n(1\u00ad7). The association between stress and long-term weight\ngain is less clear. Stress may contribute to changes in dietary\nbehaviors that lead to weight change, with various effects\nrelated to sex (8\u00ad10), baseline body mass index (11), or\ncortisol reactivity in response to stress (12, 13). These fac-\ntors may cause some people to gain more weight under\nstressful circumstances, while others may gain less weight\nor even lose weight when stressed.\nCross-sectional studies have reported only weak associ-\nations between psychosocial stress and body mass index\n(14). Three longitudinal cohort studies conducted in popu-\nlations outside the United States have produced mixed re-\nsults. Kivimaki et al. (11) used the Whitehall study,\na prospective cohort of British civil servants, to analyze\nthe prospective association between work stress and weight\nchange over 5 years. They found that greater job strain and\nlesser job control at baseline were associated with weight\ngain among men who were overweight or obese at baseline,\nbut a similar association was not observed among women.\nBrunner et al. (15) completed an additional analysis of the\nsame cohort after further follow-up. They reported that men\nwith chronic job strain, coupled with low social support\namong co-workers, were more likely to develop obesity\n(body mass index, !30 kg/m2) and central obesity (waist\ncircumference, >102 cm in men and >88 cm in women)\nthan those who had no job strain. In a Dutch cohort, Van\nStrien et al. (16) showed that men who were ``emotional\neaters'' experienced weight gain over the 6 months after\na negative life event, such as death of a family member,\ndivorce or separation from a spouse, or financial difficulties.\nKorkeila et al. (17) found an association between neuroti-\ncism and weight gain among women over 6 years in a cohort\nof Finnish twins, but this effect subsided after 15 years of\nfollow-up.\nCorrespondence to Dr. John Z.

We hypothesized, on the basis of\nprior research (11), that baseline body mass index would be\nan effect modifier of the relation between psychosocial\nstress and weight gain, and we tested for this effect in all\nstatistical models.\nStudy population\nThe Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study enrolled a\nnationally representative cohort of noninstitutionalized\nmidus.wisc.edu). This study was designed to assess psycho-\nsocial factors that influence physical and mental health for\nadults in midlife. At enrollment, participants responded to\na telephone survey and self-administered questionnaire.\nHouseholds with telephones were sampled in the cotermi-\nnous United States by random digit dialing. One English-\nspeaking adult was chosen at random in each participating\nhousehold, with oversampling of older adults and men.\nThe combined response rate at enrollment to telephone\nwere contacted and eligible for the telephone survey re-\nsponded, and 86.8% of telephone respondents completed\nthe written questionnaire) (18). A similar telephone survey\nand self-administered questionnaire were administered to\nsurviving participants in 2004.

Body mass index was calculated\nfrom self-reported height and weight. A subset of 464 sub-\njects in our sample (34%) also had height and weight mea-\nsured objectively in 2004.

Three well-validated stress scales captured\nwork experiences related to skill discretion (3 items), de-\ncision authority (6 items), and job-related demands (5 items)\n(19, 20). These scales each had strong internal reliability,\nin our cohort. Other scales captured strain in relations with\nspouse/partner (6 items: Cronbach alpha \u00bc 0.81), friends\n(21). To evaluate stress from general life experiences, we\nused a scale that evaluated perceived constraints in life (8\nwith a single question about difficulty paying bills.\nClinical and demographic covariates, selected a priori\nfrom the baseline survey, included baseline body mass\nindex, medical conditions and health status (diabetes,\nsmoking, self-rated health, and relative self-rated health\ncompared with others the same age), self-reported race/\nethnicity, income, age, and psychiatric conditions (depres-\nsion, generalized anxiety, and panic disorder as defined ac-\ncording to psychiatric scales derived from the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition,\nAppendix) (24, 25). Race/ethnicity was included in the anal-\nysis because of previously described racial and ethnic differ-\nences in body mass index in the United States (26). An\nindicator variable for quitting smoking during the follow-\nup period controlled for the likely associated weight gain.\nAll variables were entered into models as presented in Table\n1 except for baseline body mass index, which was included\nin the models after being centered on sex-specific mean\nbody mass index. The covariates had no missing data; psy-\nchosocial stress scales had less than 1% missing except\nfor work-related stress scales, which had 6.7% missing.\nSubjects with missing predictors were excluded from the\nmodels assessing those predictors.\nStatistical analysis\nThe psychosocial stress scales were constructed by cal-\nculating the mean for all responses to items in a scale, coded\nso that higher values represented greater psychosocial\nstress. Analyses of work-related stress included only re-\nspondents who were working at baseline. Analysis of\nspouse- or partner-related stress included only respondents\nwho were married or living with a partner. All analyses were\nstratified by sex, because of prior studies demonstrating that\nthe relation between stress and eating behaviors or weight\nData were weighted to adjust for probabilities of reaching\nhouseholds within each telephone exchange, sampling\nsubjects within each household, and obtaining completed\ntelephone interviews and questionnaires from designated\nsubjects (28). Poststratification weights were calculated so\nthe cohort that completed both the baseline telephone in-\nterview and written questionnaire approximated the distri-\nbution of US adults aged 25\u00ad64 years by region, residence in\na metropolitan area, sex, race, age, education, and marital\nstatus from the October 1995 Current Population Survey\nChange in body mass index was regressed on each psy-\nchosocial stress variable, controlling for the clinical and\ndemographic covariates listed above and for interactions\nbetween baseline body mass index as a continuous variable\nand the psychosocial stress scales as continuous variables.\nThese interactions assessed potential effect modification of\nthe association between psychosocial stress and weight gain\nrelated to baseline body mass index. All beta coefficients are\nunit dependent with units of kg/m2. To graphically present\nthe interaction effects for those variables found to have\nsignificant interactions, trend lines were graphed to repre-\nsent predictions from the fitted model for specified baseline\nbody mass index values, set to the mean for the body mass\nindex categories of normal weight (<25 kg/m2), overweight\ncovariates if they were significantly associated with a change\nin body mass index in more than half of the final sex-\nstratified models.\nAll analyses were conducted with SAS, version 9.1, sta-\ntistical software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina)\nto account for the complex survey design. Two-tailed\nP values are reported for all analyses.\nRESULTS\nWeighted descriptive characteristics of the study cohort at\nbaseline are presented in Table 1. Women had higher levels\nof baseline psychosocial stress than men in several domains:\nless skill discretion (P \u00bc 0.004), less decision authority\n(P < 0.001), more perceived constraints in life (P <\n0.001), and more strain in relationships with family (P <\n0.001) (Table 2). Psychosocial stress levels measured at base-\nline and follow-up were moderately correlated for each\nP < 0.001). The change in body mass index over the mean\nfollow-up period of 9.2 years was similar in women and men\nIn multivariable models including all covariates and an\ninteraction term between baseline body mass index and each\nrespective psychosocial stress scale, numerous significant\nassociations for psychosocial stress emerged (Table 3).\nWhen interactions were significant, greater psychosocial\nstress was associated with greater weight gain as baseline\nbody mass index increased (P < 0.05 for interaction term).\nThis effect was evident for financial stress for both men\nand women, for all work-related stress variables (less skill\ndiscretion, less decision authority, and higher job-related\ndemands) for men, and for job-related demands, perceived\nconstraints in life, and strain in relationships with family\nfor women. Figures 1\u00ad4 portray the significant relations\nbetween psychosocial stress and change in body mass index\nfor selected baseline body mass indexes that correspond to\nTable 1.

Men and women who were aged 55\u00ad64 years at\nenrollment experienced less weight gain compared with\nthe youngest age group. Among women, increasing baseline\nbody mass index was associated with less weight gain, and\nquitting smoking was associated with more weight gain.\nGeneralized anxiety and an income between $25,000 and\n$44,999 were associated with more weight gain for men.\nBecause generalized anxiety was a significant predictor of\nmore weight gain for men in the base models, we fitted\nadditional models without the psychosocial stress scales\nand included interaction terms between the presence of each\npsychiatric condition and baseline body mass index (in\n3 separate models for depression, generalized anxiety dis-\norder, and panic disorder for both men and women). De-\npression and generalized anxiety were highly correlated\nwithin each sex (P < 0.01), and both conditions were sig-\nnificantly associated with more weight gain among women\nand men at higher levels of baseline body mass index. There\nwas no significant association of panic disorder with change\nin body mass index for either men or women.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this nationally representative cohort of US adults fol-\nlowed longitudinally over 9 years, psychosocial stress was\nassociated with greater weight gain among both men and\nwomen with higher baseline body mass indexes if they ex-\nperienced job-related demands, had difficulty paying bills,\nor had depression or generalized anxiety disorder. Among\nwomen with higher baseline body mass indexes, perceived\nconstraints in life and strain in relations with family also\nwere associated with greater weight gain. Among men with\nhigher baseline body mass indexes, lack of skill discretion\nor decision authority at work was associated with greater\nweight gain.\nThese findings extend prior cross-sectional and longitudi-\nnal research by providing an expanded view of associations\nbetween psychosocial stress and weight gain in a nationally\nrepresentative cohort of adults in the United States. Several\nstudies have demonstrated heterogeneity in eating behaviors\nin response to stress; some people eat more when stressed\nwhile others eat less (30\u00ad32). Laboratory and observational\nstudies of stress and eating behavior have shown inconsistent\nresults when stratified by baseline weight (27). In our study,\nwith a long follow-up period and diverse measures of psy-\nchosocial stress, subjects with higher body mass indexes at\nbaseline who reported greater psychosocial stress gained\nmore weight, whereas this pattern was not evident for those\nwith lower baseline body mass indexes.\nOur results also highlight apparent sex differences in the\ninfluence of stress on weight gain. Some stressors outside of\nwork or finances, including general life constraints and\nstrain in relationships with family, were associated with\nweight gain among women but not among men, suggesting\neffects on weight from a broader range of life domains in\nwomen. Prior cross-sectional studies have shown some dif-\nferential effects by sex. These studies assessed fewer mea-\nsures of stress than our study evaluated and provided only\nlimited information about specific types of stressors that\nAnalyses from the 3 prior longitudinal studies were strat-\nified by sex.

Among women, weight gain\nwas associated with higher job demands in main effect\nTable 3.

(16) prospectively evaluated the influence\nof negative life events in a cohort in the Netherlands. Men\nclassified as highly ``emotional eaters'' gained weight for\nup to 2 years after the occurrence of a negative life event.\nNo correlation was observed for women. In a large cohort\nstudy of monozygotic and same-sex dizygotic Finnish\ntwins, Korkeila et al. (17) assessed associations of stress\nand personality type at baseline with weight gain of greater\nthan 10 kg after follow-up of 6 years and 15 years. The\nonly significant adjusted associations were between neurot-\nicism and weight gain after 6 years among older women\nand between extroversion and less weight gain among\nyounger men.\nStress appears to influence eating behaviors differently by\nsex as well. In a study of high school students aged 15\u00ad19\nyears, caloric consumption increased on days with stressful\nevents for girls but not for boys (though boys did increase\ntheir fat intake) (9). Similarly, among college students,\nwomen consumed more calories than men when exposed\nto a stressful film (8).\nOur study found an association between baseline depres-\nsion and anxiety and weight gain among men and women\nwith higher baseline body mass indexes. Prior evidence has\nlinked depression with the development of obesity, specifi-\ncally among children and adolescents (35\u00ad38). Investiga-\ntions of the relation between anxiety and weight gain have\nshown mixed results. Some studies have shown associations\nbetween anxiety at baseline and weight gain among men\nfor difficulty paying bills among US men and women. Increasing diffi-\nculty paying bills was associated with a steeper gradient of weight\ngain among obese men (A) and women (B) than for normal weight\nmen and women. Results were adjusted for baseline body mass in-\ndex; age; race; income; presence of generalized anxiety disorder,\npanic attack, or depression; smoking status; quitting smoking; pres-\nence of diabetes; self-rated health; and self-rated relative health.\nTrend lines represent predictions from the fitted model for specified\nbody mass index (BMI) values, set to the body mass index mean for\neach baseline body mass index category. In A, mean body mass\nindex values for men are 22.8 (normal weight), 27.1 (overweight),\nand 33.8 (obese) kg/m2. In B, mean body mass index values for\nfor job-related demands among US men and women. Increasing job-\nrelated demands were associated with increasing weight gain among\nobese men (A) and women (B) and less weight gain among normal\nweight men and women. Results were adjusted for baseline body\nmass index (BMI); age; race; income; presence of generalized anxiety\ndisorder, panic attack, or depression; smoking status; quitting smok-\ning; presence of diabetes; self-rated health; and self-rated relative\nhealth. Trend lines represent predictions from the fitted model for\nspecified body mass index values, set to the body mass index mean\nfor each baseline body mass index category. In A, mean body mass\n(obese) kg/m2. In B, mean body mass index values are 21.7 (normal\n(39) and women (38), yet another study found a trend to-\nward decreased likelihood of becoming overweight among\nmen and women with anxiety at baseline (40). None of these\nstudies of depression and anxiety have assessed the effect\nmodification of baseline body mass index.\nSeveral pathways have been explored in animal models to\nassess how psychosocial stress may influence weight gain.\nSocial subordination in several species of primates induces\nchronically elevated cortisol levels, and high cortisol levels\nare associated with abdominal obesity in both nonhuman\nprimates and humans (41\u00ad43). As a result, social subordi-\nnation has been examined as a model for stress-induced\neating and weight gain. Female monkeys who are socially\nsubordinate have higher levels of abdominal obesity than\nsocially dominant females (44). In an observational study\nof macaques, Wilson et al. (45) found that socially subordi-\nnate females consumed more calories and fed more fre-\nquently than socially dominant females. The subordinate\nfemales also demonstrated more anxious behavior and had\nalternations of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis with less\nnegative feedback from elevated glucocorticoid levels. Lab-\noratory studies in rats have shown that mild stress (e.g., tail\npinching or restraint) can lead to weight gain if highly palat-\nable foods are provided, but not with regular diets (46\u00ad48).\nBased in large part on animal models, a complex interplay\nof hormones such as glucocorticoids and ghrelin (that in-\ncrease appetite) and corticotrophin-releasing hormone and\nleptin (that decrease appetite) has been proposed by other\nresearchers (48\u00ad51) to be involved in the physiologic path-\nways between stress and weight gain. Endogenous opiates\ninduced by eating might also serve a role in limiting the\ndysphoric effects of stress (52). These pathways suggest\na ``comfort food'' or ``emotional eating'' paradigm that\nhas been proposed to explain stress-induced eating and\nweight gain (53, 54). The influence of stress on weight gain,\ntherefore, may depend on the intensity and duration of stress\nand the types of food that are available for consumption.\nFew mechanistic studies have assessed hormonal path-\nways that could link stress and weight in humans. Normal-\nweight women with major depression had more than twice\nthe cortisol level and intraabdominal fat as those without\ndepression (55). In a laboratory experiment with postmen-\nopausal women subjected to a stress-inducing protocol, Epel\net al. (56) discovered that women with high waist/hip ratios,\nregardless of body mass index, were more likely to display\nhigher stress-induced cortisol levels. Women with high\nwaist/hip ratios also felt more threatened under stress, and\ncontrolling for this high threat appraisal partially attenuated\nFigure 3. Adjusted change in body mass index from 1995 to 2004 for perceived constraint in life and strain in relations with family among US\nwomen. Increasing perceived constraint in life (A) and increasing strain in relations with family (B) were associated with increasing weight gain\namong obese women and less weight gain among normal weight women. Results were adjusted for baseline body mass index; age; race; income;\npresence of generalized anxiety disorder, panic attack, or depression; smoking status; quitting smoking; presence of diabetes; self-rated health;\nand self-rated relative health. Trend lines represent predictions from the fitted model for specified body mass index (BMI) values, set to the body\nmass index mean for each baseline body mass index category: 21.7 (normal weight), 27.3 (overweight), and 35.4 (obese) kg/m2.\nPsychosocial Stress and Change in Weight Among Adults 187\nthe association between waist/hip ratio and cortisol. Addi-\ntional studies have documented higher snack food consump-\ntion in women with high stress-induced cortisol levels\nOur study had several potential limitations. First, there\nwas only 1 follow-up measure of body mass index over\na mean of 9.2 years. Psychosocial stress could change over\nthis time period, though there was a moderately high degree\nof correlation between baseline and follow-up psychosocial\nstress. Second, although our study cohort was representa-\ntive of US adults, the response rate to the follow-up survey\nin our sample was 60%, and nonrespondents differed from\nrespondents on several demographic and health character-\nistics. However, models were adjusted for the variables that\ndiffered between respondents and nonrespondents, and fur-\nther bias would only arise if the relation of stress and\nweight change also differed for these 2 groups. Third, cer-\ntain medications can be associated with weight gain (57).\nHowever, the MIDUS survey did not collect specific drug\nnames, so we could not control for active use of these\nmedications. Nonetheless, in all models, we controlled for\ndiabetes, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression, con-\nditions which are commonly treated with medications that\nare associated with weight gain. The most commonly used\nmedications for depression and generalized anxiety disor-\nder, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, have mixed ef-\nfects on weight, so the net effect of these medications on\nweight gain may be limited (57). Fourth, causality cannot\nbe established in our data despite the temporal ordering of\nbaseline stress and subsequent weight gain. Fifth, weight\nand height were self-reported in this study and thus could\nbe biased. Other studies have reported a high correlation\nbetween self-reported weight and height and measured\nand overweight in our sample was consistent with reported\nnational estimates (26). Furthermore, in the subset of 464\nsubjects in our sample who had height and weight objec-\ntively measured at follow-up, the correlation between self-\nreported and measured body mass index in 2004 exceeded\n0.92 for both men and women. Finally, the number of sig-\nall in the same direction) exceeded what would be expected\nby chance, and the pattern was consistent with prior\nevidence.\nIn this nationally representative cohort, several domains\nof psychosocial stress as well as anxiety and depression\nwere associated with weight gain among men and women\nwith higher body mass indexes. Awareness of these associ-\nations may enable clinicians to help their overweight and\nobese patients avoid gaining further weight during stressful\nperiods. Stress reduction may also be an important compo-\nnent of weight-loss interventions in worksites and in clinical\n"
