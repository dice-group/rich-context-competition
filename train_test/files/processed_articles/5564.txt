There is a long and cumulative literature on the difficulties and chal-\nlenges of living with YOD. For example, younger individuals are likely to still be in employ-\nBanks, Danson, Tolson, & Borrowman, 2015; Robertson, Evans, & Horsnell, 2013) and\ncarry financial responsibilities for their families. They have to give up work (Rayment &\nformance (Richardson et al., 2016). Spouses may have to reduce their working hours to take\non a caregiving role (Shnall, 2015) or, alternatively, may have to find employment to sup-\nport the family financially (Kinney, Kart, & Reddecliff, 2011). Families struggle to find\nadvice and support in relation to pension payments, benefits, insurances and longer term\n2015; Wheeler et al., 2015), especially if they have teenage children or look after an\nageing parent (Gibson et al., 2014). They also tend to enjoy higher levels of physical fitness\nthan older people (Roach, Drummond, & Keady, 2016; Tolhurst, Bhattacharyya, &\nKingston, 2014) and seek to continue and actively pursue their interests and hobbies\nMcCann, 2015; Dementia Pathfinders, 2016; Ducharme, Kergoat, Antoine, Pasquier, &\nServices designed for older people such as day care centres for older people with dementia\ntherefore do not `fit' younger people. Being exposed to people in advanced stages of demen-\ntia can be quite disturbing for those who are at the beginning of their journey and in the\nprocess of adjusting to their diagnosis whilst still in a very active phase of life (Millenaar\net al., 2016). As expressed recently by a young person diagnosed with dementia: \"We are\ntold to give up our pre-dementia diagnosis lives and to get acquainted with age-care serv-\nices\" (Swaffer, 2018). Age therefore is a factor when designing support for younger people\ndiagnosed with dementia. Their support needs are different to the care required by older\npeople in their 80s or 90s when functional decline as a feature of normal ageing is worsened\nby dementia.\nThis study aimed to establish what was known about the range of post-diagnostic\ninterventions designed for people diagnosed with YOD and their family caregivers, which\nelements of support were perceived as most effective by people affected by YOD, and how\nage-appropriate services needed to differ from generic dementia services offered to much\nolder populations. Some findings were reported previously (Mayrhofer, Mathie, McKeown,\nBunn, & Goodman, 2017). This paper focuses on suggestions made by people diagnosed\nwith YOD and their caregivers in the two rounds of discussions held around different\napproaches to service design.\nMethods\nWe undertook a scoping review of the literature on what was known about the range of post-\ndiagnostic services and discussed these findings with four groups of people affected by YOD.\nThese discussion groups were not research study participants, but patient and public involve-\nment (PPI) contributors and are referred to as PPI discussants (INVOLVE, 2012). The pur-\npose of these discussions was to establish whether the themes presented in national and\ninternational literature reflected their experience of service provision, to highlight research\ngaps and to inform questionnaires for service providers. This approach is useful for commis-\nsioners and practitioners when assessing the relevance and applicability of evidence that may\ncome from diverse sources and settings and is synthesised over extended periods of time\n(Bunn et al., 2015). Researchers met PPI discussants via existing Alzheimer's Society support\ngroups and had a number of reflective conversations about the findings of a scoping\nreview around post-diagnostic services for younger people with dementia (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. The role of PPI discussion groups.\nMayrhofer et al. 3\nScoping of the literature\nOur approach was based on the methodological framework for scoping reviews (Arksey &\nO'Malley, 2005) in relation to identifying and selecting relevant studies, charting the data,\noptional consultation, and collating and summarizing the results.\nIdentifying and selecting relevant studies: Data collection and scoping process. To establish what was\nknown about the range of post-diagnostic services, and which components of care were\nperceived as age-appropriate and meaningful, we undertook a scoping review on service\nprovision for younger people with dementia. We searched PubMed, Cinhal, Scopus, Ebsco\nHost and Social Care Online, used Google Scholar, undertook lateral searching, hand-\nsearched dementia specific peer-reviewed journals and carried out online searches for\ngrey literature published by the National Health Service and third-sector organisations\n(March\u00adJune 2016). The main inclusion criterion was for the literature to be YOD specific.\nPapers and reports that focused on dementia more generally were excluded. Search terms\nused are shown in Box 1.\nInvolvement of people affected by YOD. To advise on how evidence about living with YOD was\ninterpreted in the literature and to understand which of the services were perceived as most\nsupportive and effective, we held two rounds of discussions with four groups of people\naffected by YOD in two disparate study sites in England. Access to existing YOD groups\nwho meet once a month was facilitated by the Alzheimer's Society. Three groups were\ncomprised of a person living with dementia and their caregiver and were consulted as\ndyads. In one group, researchers had only access to family caregivers. The YOD groups\nwere consulted as PPI contributors/discussants, also referred to as `experts by experience', to\nshape the research (INVOLVE, 2012). PPI discussants and/or their family caregivers\nreceived information sheets prior to the meeting and, as a requirement of the Alzheimer's\nSociety, signed consent forms. We used a topic guide that stated the purpose of the meeting\nand the main question for discussion and ensured that there was enough time for questions\nSmith, Rossor, & Kotting, 2017). We did not ask for personal information, except for\ndemographics such as gender, age, age at diagnosis and sub-type of dementia.\nDiscussions were iterative. The first round of discussions reflected on interim findings of\nthe scoping review. The second round discussed their views on what dementia care and\nsupport in their community might look like and what their priorities were. Two researchers\ntook notes during the discussions. Information was grouped into themes and synthesised\nacross the four PPI groups. The points raised by the groups echoed the topics of the scoping\nreview and helped the researchers shape the systematic review. We returned a third time to\nmeet with PPI discussants at the end of the study to provide feedback (Mathie et al., 2018).\nWe discussed with the groups how their involvement had shaped the research and what the\nBox 1 Search terms.\n\"Young onset\", \"early onset\", dementia, Alzheimer*, YOD, assessment, diagnosis, \"post-diagnosis\",\n\"post-diagnostic\", service*, \"service provision\", support, intervention*, \"care need*, \"dementia\ncare\", NHS, hospital, charity, \"third sector\", community (and various combinations of terms)\nway forward might be in supporting younger people with dementia and their family care-\ngivers. A written lay summary of study findings was provided to those attending the group.\nAdditional copies were left with the groups for them to disseminate to people they thought\nmight be interested in the study. We also posted printed copies to group co-ordinators for\nfurther dissemination.\nInterviews with service providers. To understand how service provision for people with YOD is\nconceptualised by organisations, we undertook face-to-face and/or telephone interviews\nwith members of staff of memory services and third-sector organisations that provided\nservices in two disparate sites. Third-sector organisations were purposively sampled local\nand national charities that had been mentioned in the two rounds of discussions with those\naffected by YOD. Interview data were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically\n(Mason, 2017) by three researchers (AM, EM and JMc) using qualitative data management\nsoftware QSR NVivo version 11 (NVivo, 2015). Interview data from memory services are\ndenoted by the key `MS'. The key `TSO' refers to information and interview data from\nthird-sector organisations.\nGeneral public and patient involvement. In addition to the discussion groups who commented on\nfindings and services, we had Public and Public Involvement (PPI) input prior to commenc-\ning the study to ensure that the overall approach was clear and relevant. An Alzheimer's\nSociety representative diagnosed with YOD commented on the funding application. Two\nmembers of the University's Patient & Public Involvement in Research Group, both of\nwhom have personal experience of family members with dementia and are regular volun-\nteers with the Alzheimer's Society, joined the study's advisory group for the duration of the\nproject. They commented on the design of the questionnaire for service providers and on the\nlay summary of findings prior to dissemination. Minor adjustments were made to the\nlay summary.\nEthics approval\nThe research protocol was reviewed and approved by the University of Hertfordshire Ethics\n(Protocol Number HSK/SF/UH/02540). The Alzheimer's Society research support office\nfacilitated access to people affected by YOD for our discussions.\nFindings: Summary of scoping review\nThe scoping review identified literature reviews of the experience of living with YOD\n(n \u00bc 12), systematic reviews (n \u00bc 5), peer-reviewed papers (n \u00bc 22), evaluations (n \u00bc 3), a\nguest editorial (n \u00bc 1) and reports published by charities and non-profit organisations\n(n \u00bc 6). The literature reviews and systematic reviews included more than 700 documents.\nRecurring, well-known and frequently reported themes related to the length of time it took\nto receive a diagnosis, to learn which support was available in the community locally and the\nneed for specific support needs (Austin, O'Neill, & Skevington, 2016; Baptista et al., 2016;\nDucharme, Kergoat, Coulombe, et al., 2014). Support needs were determined by the rela-\ntively young age at which individuals were diagnosed (Armari et al., 2013; Dementia\nPathfinders, 2016), by pre-mature and unplanned retirement (Chaplin & Davidson, 2016)\nand by different and often rarer sub-types of dementia (Chemali, Withall, & Daffner, 2010).\nMayrhofer et al. 5\nA cumulative body of literature emphasises the differences between age-appropriate support\nand dementia services for older people (Mayrhofer et al., 2017). Services were perceived as\nuseful if they provided information about specific aspects of YOD (Carter, Oyebode, &\nKoopmans, 2018), signposted to different services in the community, addressed the person\ndiagnosed with YOD and their caregiver as a dyad and were responsive to a person's/\nfamily's changing needs as the illness progressed (Westera et al., 2014).\nCommunity-based support services that were felt to be effective further along the illness\ntrajectory featured the following elements: they provided continuity, offered stimulation,\npreserved identity, dignity, personhood and agency (Carone, Tischler, & Dening, 2016;\nDucharme et al., 2016), facilitated social connectedness and prevented families from becom-\ning socially isolated (Roach & Drummond, 2014). Barriers to accessing such initiatives were\na lack of knowledge that they existed, lack of transport or if caregiver respite meant that the\nyounger person with dementia would have to spend time in a residential care home for older\npeople (Gitlin, Marx, Stanley, & Hodgson, 2015). The scoping review showed that some\nhigh-quality support was provided, but its sustainability was determined by the way services\nwere commissioned and funded. These were the findings we took to the PPI discus-\nsion groups.\nPPI contributions by people affected by YOD\nTwo rounds of discussions with four PPI groups consisting of people diagnosed with YOD\nand their caregivers were held in two sites in England in May and October 2016. Two\nresearchers attended each of the groups (AM and EM; AM and JMc). Members of\nAlzheimer's Society staff and volunteers were also in attendance. Of 31 discussants, 11\nhad a diagnosis of YOD and 20 were spousal caregivers (Table 1). Seven of 11 people\nwith YOD were males and four were females. Types of diagnoses included Alzheimer's\ndisease, vascular/mixed dementia, Lewy bodies, semantic dementia, posterior cortical atro-\nphy, Pick's disease, and cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts\nand leuko-encephalopathy (CADASIL). Three PPI discussants did not state the type of\ndementia. Two group members were older than 65 years when they received a formal diag-\nnosis, but reportedly had been symptomatic for a considerable length of time prior to being\ndiagnosed. The age range was from 48 to 70 years.\nIn the first round of discussions, a researcher presented a brief overview of the main\nthemes that emerged from the scoping review, asked whether this matched people's experi-\nence and invited comments as to people's perceptions of service use. Discussants agreed with\nthe main recurring themes presented in the literature but were keen to emphasise the sig-\nnificance of some, but not all of the findings. They stated that many community-based\nservices were provided on a short-term basis only and therefore lacked continuity of care.\nTable 1. PPI discussants.\nYOD: young onset dementia.\nSome services had long waiting lists and frequent staff changes. PPI groups brought new\ninsights to research findings about the lack of continuity of services and stressed the chal-\nlenge of having to re-orientate themselves, having to find new services and, in effect, having\nto return to their immediate post-diagnosis status. For people living with a diagnosis, this\nlack of continuity was not just a loss of a service but also a loss of contact with people whom\nthey had just met, who were like themselves and could empathise. Sustainability of services,\ncontinuity of care and local, community-based, easily accessible social networks were par-\nticularly important for these groups who found mainstream dementia services inappropri-\nate. The lack of advice and support around finances in unplanned, pre-mature retirement\nwas discussed in the scoping review, but the PPI representatives identified this as a pressing\nservice need and specific research gap that needed to be prioritised.\nIn order to shape the interview questionnaire for service providers, the second round of\ndiscussions revisited these issues and asked specific questions around which kind of\ncommunity-based support could improve or modify services. One PPI discussion group\nstated that they had been giving this considerable thought as the earlier discussion had\nprovided a platform and stimulus for thinking about what might be effective. They pro-\nposed a service model where a local branch of a charity (such as the Alzheimer's Society)\ncould act as an `anchor' and become the go-to-place for advice around which other services\nand groups could self-organise. This was seen as likely to facilitate contact with other fam-\nilies affected by YOD who are scattered in their community. The local charity could be the\nhub for building their own social networks around shared interests, similar conditions and/\nor geographical proximity, all of which was represented as likely to support continuity of\ncontact and peer support. One group mentioned the idea of `skills swapping', for example,\ndriving, offering transport to various events, or offering gender-specific support such as a\nwoman accompanying another woman to go swimming or shopping for clothes, or a man\ntaking another man to watch a game of football. Such activities presume knowing who else\nin their community is affected by YOD.\nThe groups offered a different perspective on what services should achieve. The aim was\nto become less dependent on `services' as families learn to support each other, socialise with\neach other and help each other to live as well as possible. In these discussions, the service or\ncentre could be a catalyst for self-organisation as well as a safety net for those who struggled\nto make connections. In the last PPI discussion group meeting we drew a diagram to capture\ndiscussants' thoughts and comments.\nThe rectangular shapes in Figure 2 depict a range of services offered by non-statutory\nthird-sector organisations. These include day services for people with YOD, bespoke serv-\nices, home support, various activities and group-based peer support. However, as pointed\nout in PPI discussions, a range of activities that people diagnosed with YOD would like to\ntake part in are currently unconnected (depicted in ellipse shapes).\nA recurring idea in the PPI discussions was the importance of enabling families in similar\nsituations to support each other and potentially reduce the demand for overstretched\ncommunity-based services. The value of family members being able to meet peers who\nfaced similar issues and more generally to foster a sense of social inclusion and social\nconnectedness was discussed as important, and a lack of knowledge of other families affect-\ned by YOD in their local area was seen as a significant barrier to building networks of\ninformal support. It was suggested that organisations' concerns about data protection could\nhave unintended consequences of maintaining isolation. Discussants thought that one way\nof overcoming this could be for organisations to offer an `introduction service', which\nMayrhofer et al. 7\npeople could opt in to. They also suggested the development of online resources designed to\ncontact other families affected by YOD in the community or to find events. They were\nsophisticated in their understanding of what would and would not work. Whilst the scoping\nreview had recognised the pressures on families, studies had not explored how agencies\ncould mediate peer-to-peer support with different members of the family.\nIn contrast to the needs identified in the literature, discussants talked about organically\ndeveloped community-based networks that are anchored by a core. They were pragmatic\nand recognised that the small numbers of people living with YOD in any area tended to\nwork against the sustained funding of service-led provision. PPI discussants saw third-sector\norganisations as a focal point for advice and support, but equally importantly as advocates\non their behalf to liaise with local clubs, restaurants and businesses to make their services to\nthe public more accessible and dementia friendly. Concrete and practical suggestions includ-\ned reduced rates for leisure centres for people with YOD who, though physically fit and\nactive, found themselves retired pre-maturely. They suggested organising a `slow swimming\nlane' during quiet times of the day, providing a closed-off room in a restaurant a few\nevenings per month and negotiating reduced rates for buses for families affected by\nYOD. This was seen as achievable because of the small and relatively inexpensive adjust-\nments required for the small numbers of people with YOD they would apply to. PPI groups\nhighlighted that literature had not investigated cross-cutting links between services or how\nthis might foster group-based peer support.\nFigure 2. Developing support networks at the community level.\nPPI contributors were grounded in the realities of provision, and group discussions\nenabled judgements on the relative significance of research findings. Issues such as\nproject-based commissioning, sustainability of services, continuity of care and waiting\nlists for community-based support were recognised and addressed. They were also recog-\nnised and addressed by service providers.\nInterviews with service providers\nTo determine service providers' views on the themes identified in the literature and by PPI\ncontributors we undertook face-to-face and/or telephone interviews with memory services\n(n \u00bc 3) and non-statutory service providers (n \u00bc 7) in two study sites in England. Two of the\nthree memory services worked with a multidisciplinary team that included an Alzheimer's\nSociety support worker. Teams either helped the person diagnosed with YOD and their\nfamily carer directly or referred them to community-based services for support (MS01 and\nMS06). The third memory clinic had Alzheimer's Society support staff as the `go to' person\nand link between public sector and third-sector services and the community (MS08).\nHowever, this post was project-funded and discontinued after one year.\nInterviews suggested that person-centred long-term relationships were more likely to be\nestablished if support workers remained closely involved with patients and their families in\nthe longer term and did not withdraw services once a person reached the age of 65 years. As\na clinician from a memory service observed:\nA problem from a service provider's (memory clinic) point of view is what to do when people get\nolder. A service designed for younger people with dementia must either discharge people when\nthey get to a certain age or end up being a service where people are on average not young. This is\ncompounded by the age structure of dementia \u00ad exponentially increasing with age, so most\npeople under 65 with dementia are only just under 65, that is, 60 to 64. The same goes for\nany specific age cut-off down to the age of 40 (according to Prince et al., 2014 figures). The very\nyoung are very rare, and the majority are just below the cut-off age for traditional `Old Age'\nservices. So if you cut off at 65 and actually most of your clients are over 60, then in 5 years, they\nThis is addressed in current work (Carter et al., 2018; Young Dementia UK, 2017) and is\nindicative of developments that envisage a dementia care pathway that would not regard age\n>65 years to be a criterion for service discontinuation, but endeavour to provide support\nand continuity from diagnosis to end-of-life care.\nInterviews with community-based third-sector organisations acknowledged the topics\naddressed in the literature and by PPI discussants and commented on barriers to service\ndelivery. As one organisation's representative stated, \". . .I think we've got 42 people with\nyounger onset now, and we've got a waiting list that we've had for about six months. We're\noversubscribed\" (TSO05). In contrast, one organisation's service model was based on offer-\ning personalised care on a long-term basis, \". . .sometimes up to 10 or 12 years\" (TSO10).\nThey adjusted support periodically as determined by the illness trajectory. A key component\nof this model was that staff were trained and employed on a permanent basis rather than on\nshort-term contracts. Some third-sector organisations offered activities such as walking,\ngardening, cooking, supper clubs, coffee chats and opportunities to get together socially\nMayrhofer et al. 9\nmost services depended on project-based commissioning (TSO02-TSO05 and TSO09),\nwhich in turn worked against being able to attract and retain a skilled workforce\n(TSO05) and serving geographically dispersed populations. This had an impact on the sta-\nbility and sustainability of provision and on the continuity of care.\nInterviews with service providers show that some good quality age-appropriate services\nare being offered, but often only regionally and therefore not accessible more widely for\npeople with YOD. Service providers recognised the importance of continuity, but were\nunder resourced. With the exception of one charity that offers bespoke long-term care\n(TS010), service providers did not discuss the potential to create opportunities to offer\npeer-to-peer support, or how to help families affected by YOD to find alternative sup-\nport solutions.\nDiscussion\nDiscussions with PPI contributors affected by YOD corroborated findings in national and\ninternational literature, but went beyond the consensus that details the challenges of post-\ndiagnostic services for families affected by YOD. This study demonstrated the value of\nholding discussions with people affected by dementia who can comment on the research\nfindings and provide both a commentary and a critique to existing service solutions.\nAlthough they did not articulate this as co-production, their suggestions demonstrated\nhow their experience and expertise could inform service planning. PPI contributors recog-\nnised that, because of the small numbers of people with YOD, they may not be able to\ninfluence services at the systems level, for example, diagnostic processes and services offered\nby health and social care, but they saw the potential of changing the focus, support and\nscope of community-based services through working with local charities and exist-\ning services.\nComplementary to the findings from the scoping review and third-sector organisations,\nPPI discussants provided a critical account of what is possible. They offered a framework\nagainst which service models could be designed and evaluated, for example, the ability of\nservices to create networks of support that can contribute beyond the lifetime of an activity.\nPPI contributors saw social networks as being conducive to forming a post-diagnostic\nidentity, establishing new social connections and developing and maintaining a sense of\nbelonging, an approach that has been reported as effective for people affected by YOD\ncomponents of care that were perceived as most desirable and effective, not only for the\nbenefit of the person diagnosed with YOD and their family caregiver, but also as an oppor-\ntunity for their children to meet peers with a parent in a similar situation. PPI contribution\nprovided invaluable insights on the relative importance of various solutions.\nAs assessment and diagnostic procedures improve and more people with YOD become\nknown to primary and secondary care services (Young Dementia UK, 2017), increasing\nnumbers will, inevitably, be referred back to the community. Involving families affected by\nyounger onset dementia in networks of support and co-designing locally based community\nservices might address some of the seemingly intractable challenges of sustainability, con-\ntinuity and cost effectiveness of person-centred and post-diagnostic service provision for this\nunderserved population. Long-term support becomes increasingly important when families'\nsupport needs change as the illness progresses. Continuity of care was rare, yet this was what\nPPI discussants who were diagnosed some years ago felt was lacking the most.\nAs highlighted by PPI contributors affected by YOD, a service model that develops cross-\ncutting links between service providers might foster group-based peer support, enable fam-\nilies in similar situations to support each other and support the organic development of\ncommunity-based networks. However, this is not to argue that there is no need for addi-\ntional, ongoing, funded post-diagnostic support for this group. The literature and PPI dis-\ncussion groups were unequivocal about this.\nWhat this study demonstrates is the importance and potential of involving people with\nYOD and their families at the centre of the commissioning, design and delivery of demen-\ntia care.\nStrengths and limitations of this study\nA strength of this study is that it included PPI contributors affected by younger onset\ndementia to comment on the scoping review and to help shape the questionnaires for\nthird-sector organisations locally. It is worth noting the subtle distinction between PPI\ncontributors and participants and the purpose to which information is used. The blurring\nof boundaries between the `dual role' of participant and PPI contributor has been reported\nbefore (Wilson et al., 2015), is recognised in the current body of PPI literature (Keenan\nissues within dementia research, as PPI does not require ethical consent (INVOLVE, 2016).\nThere is a need to clarify how this information is systematically collected and organised to\nensure that people with YOD have the opportunity to debate and challenge service planning\nand delivery. A limitation of this study is that PPI contributors were drawn from a pool of\npeople who attend Alzheimer Society's support groups. Individuals attending such groups\nare often highly engaged and connected, but the voices of people who do not attend such\ngroups might be heard less. Future studies may need to consider a wider recruitment strat-\negy. However, according to grey literature and the evidence in peer-reviewed literature\n(Mayrhofer et al., 2017), the issues raised by the four PPI groups in this study were expe-\nrienced across a wide range of samples of younger people living with dementia and their\nfamily caregivers.\nConclusion\nThis paper makes an important contribution to the international discourse on dementia care\nin that it departs from `needs based' reporting and adds to the emerging literature around\ninvolving families affected by YOD in the development and co-design of community-based\ndemonstrated how people with YOD can provide a critical commentary on research find-\nings, current approaches to service provision, and on priorities for future work that comple-\nments the evidence and commissioning agenda.\nPPI discussants identified the importance of local groups and peer support networks\nbased on reciprocity, but needed help in setting them up, particularly in the initial period.\nThe Dementia Engagement and Empowerment Project (http://dementiavoices.org.uk) is one\nmodel that has been instrumental in setting up regional groups, but local charities are\nneeded to help introduce families to each other locally. Research is needed to understand\nthe impact of this kind of approach and how involving people with YOD in priority setting\nand service design over time affects people's ability to maintain inclusion.\n"
