Wiley*\nDepartment of Anthropology, Program in Human Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, United States of America\n Introduction\nThe age at which a female reaches sexual maturity represents a\ncritical transition in her life history. While to a large degree the\ntiming of menarche is under genetic control [1,2,3], environmental\nsignals of resource availability or stress, among others, may\naccelerate or delay this life history shift from somatic to\nreproductive investment. Under conditions of food scarcity, it\nmay make sense to delay menarche until sufficient energy\nresources are available to support reproduction [4,5,6], while\nfamilial or local social stressors appear to accelerate menarche\nwhen social conditions are unstable and future survival is\nuncertain [7,8,9,10]. A downward secular trend in age at\nmenarche has occurred when food resources have become\nabundant and life-threatening childhood infections have dimin-\nished, such that over the course of the twentieth century age at\nmenarche declined from over age 16 yrs to below 13 yrs in\nindustrialized countries, and similar trends are evident in\nNutrient intake and storage during childhood may influence the\ntiming of menarche through hormones such as leptin and insulin,\nand growth factors such as Insulin-like Growth Factor I (IGF-I), all\nof which are involved in the regulation of growth and maturation\n[1,14,15]. Chronic energy undernutrition has been linked to later\nage at menarche [4,11,16], while overnutrition, characterized by\nhigh BMI, has been linked to earlier onset of menarche\nmenarche is contingent on the physiological template established\nin utero and the infant period, with lower birth weight and rapid\ngrowth in early childhood associated with earlier menarche\npopulation groups in the U.S., with African Americans averaging\nMexican-American girls have average ages at menarche between\nthose of Blacks and Whites [28]. This variation is not well-\nunderstood, but is likely to stem from differences in experiences\nwith the factors just outlined [29]. There may also be population\ngenetic differences that contribute to variation in age at menarche.\nWhile overall nutritional status mediates age at menarche, there\nhas been additional research relating specific dietary components\nto this outcome. Low fiber and monounsaturated fatty acid intake\nintake [30,35] each have been associated with a lower age at\nmenarche, although not consistently across studies [36,37]. The\nlatter three nutrients are common to milk and other dairy\nproducts, suggesting that the consumption of these particular foods\nmay influence the timing of sexual maturation. Milk supplemen-\ntation studies designed to assess effects on bone mineralization\namong peri-menarcheal girls have generally not found effects on\nage at menarche [38,39]. Chinese girls receiving milk supplements\nover 2 years were not more likely to reach menarche during the\nsupplementation period than girls in the control group (48.3%\ncompared with 40.1%; P = 0.09), and there were no significant\ndifferences in age at menarche between supplementation and\ncontrol groups 3 years after the supplementation ended, when over\n97% of study participants had reached menarche [40].\nTypically mammals consume milk only during infancy, which is\na period of very rapid growth and maturation, and each species'\nmilk reflects the particular growth pattern and needs of its infants.\nMilk contains calories, vitamins and minerals, and specific\nbiochemicals that enhance growth and development above and\nbeyond its nutrients and energy [41]. However, milk \u00ad indeed that\nof another species with a different life history \u00ad is now widely\nconsumed by many humans well beyond the traditional age at\nweaning. Milk comes most frequently from bovine species\n(especially cows, Bos spp.), which have a radically different juvenile\ngrowth pattern than humans, i.e. calves grow faster and to much\nlarger sizes [42,43]. The question thus arises as to whether\nconsumption of a growth-promoting substance from another\nspecies throughout childhood fundamentally alters processes of\nhuman growth and maturation.\nIGF-I is part of the protein fraction of milk, structurally similar\nto insulin, and a powerful mitogen that stimulates growth in a\nvariety of tissues. IGF-I is molecularly identical in bovine and\nhuman milk and the concentration does not vary substantially\nbetween the species' milks [44,45]. Animal protein in general and\nmilk in particular have been found to increase circulating levels of\nmilk is itself responsible for the increase in IGF-I in circulation or if\nmilk stimulates endogenous IGF-I production [46]. Debate\ncontinues over whether any IGF-I is absorbed intact or if it is\nfully digested in the gastrointestinal tract in post-weaning age\nIGF-I is associated with rapid growth [50], child height [47,51],\nand pubertal development [52,53]. Milk consumption, IGF-I\nlevels, and height have been shown to be positively correlated\namong children [47,51]. Current milk intake is not strongly\nassociated with growth in height among U.S. children age 6\u00ad\n11 yrs [54], although it is positively associated with height and\nBMI in preschool children [55,56], and height among adolescents\n[54,57]. Dairy products have not been found to have the same\nassociations with growth in height [55,56]. Many concerns have\nbeen raised about whether the use of synthetic bovine growth\nhormone (rBGH or rBST) in cows to boost milk yield increases\nIGF-I concentrations in milk and thereby accelerates growth and/\nor sexual maturation. Monsanto researchers have reported that\nthere is no difference in IGF-I concentrations in commercially\navailable conventional milk, milk labeled as from cows not treated\nwith rBGH, or organic milk, which by definition cannot be from\ncows treated with rBGH [58]. The Food and Drug Administra-\ntion's conclusion is that milk from rBGH-treated cows is safe for\nhuman consumption and that IGF-I levels are not elevated\ncompared to either human milk or non-rBGH-treated cow milk\nand IGF-I is digested and hence not directly absorbed [49].\nCurrently only a small minority of cows in the U.S. are treated\nwith rBGH and many major supermarket brands of milk are from\nfarmers who pledge not to use rBGH (Mike Schutz, personal\ncommunication; a precise accounting is not publically available).\nGiven that milk consumption is strongly encouraged and widely\npromoted for children in the United States [59,60], and milk\nnutrients and IGF-I are both associated with somatic growth and\npubertal development, it is valuable to ascertain whether milk\nduring childhood promotes earlier sexual maturation. To do so,\nthis study tests the following hypotheses: greater reported milk\nintake frequency in childhood will be associated with a lower age\nat menarche, or increased probability of early menarche, defined\nmilk or total dairy intake and reported frequency of milk\nconsumption will be associated with an increased likelihood of\nearly menarche in U.S. girls age 9\u00ad12 yrs.\nMaterials and Methods\nHealth and Examination Survey (NHANES) [61], an annual\nsurvey of health, diet, and nutritional status of the civilian non-\ninstitutionalized U.S. population. Each survey covers ,5000\nindividuals across the age spectrum, and has a complex, multistage\nanalysis, representing six cycles of data collection. STATA 10.0's\nsurvey data analysis tool was used in all analyses [62]. As per the\nNHANES analytic guidelines [63], sample weights were con-\nstructed for the six year composite sample. For women, the sample\nweight was based on those participating in the interview; for girls,\nit was based on those who completed the 24-h diet recall and\nexamination. All results presented here were based on the\nweighted samples.\nabout their age at menarche during the interview. This was reported\nin whole years, and so cannot be used as a measure of their exact\nmenarcheal age or to calculate a precise average age at menarche\nfor U.S. women. Available covariates that could potentially have\nassociations with age at menarche included: age, ethnicity,\neducation (less than high school, high school completion, post-high\nschool education, used here as a rough index of childhood\nsocioeconomic status, the only estimate available for adults in\nNHANES), and whether or not the respondent had been born in\nthe United States. For this analysis only individuals self-identifying\nas Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, and Mexican-\nAmerican were included, due to the lack of specificity and small\nsamples sizes of the other two categories (``Other Hispanic'' and\n``Other'') and research showing differences in age at menarche\namong these three groups. Although members of these groups are\ndiverse and the groupings are not biologically comparable, these are\nthe labels used in NHANES. They will be referred to in this paper as\n``ethnic groups.''\nof their milk intake at ages 5\u00ad12 years. This became a gated\nquestion in 2001; adults were first asked whether they had been\nregular milk consumers. Regular milk consumption was defined as\nat least 5 times per week. Only those who reported being regular\nor ``variable'' milk drinkers were then asked specific questions\nabout the frequency of their milk intake at 5\u00ad12 yrs. For this\nanalysis a composite variable was constructed as a measure of milk\nintake during childhood. The following scale was used: 0 = not a\nregular milk drinker or answered ``never'' or ``rarely'' to the\nquestion ``How often did you drink any type of milk (including\nmilk added to cereal) when you were a child between the ages of 5\nand 12 years old;'' 1 = sometimes or ``it varied;'' 2 = daily.\nConsumption of all dairy products during childhood was not\nassessed for adults in NHANES, so the analysis of adult women\nwill focus on milk only.\nMilk Intake and Early Menarche\nethnic groups, reported whether they were born in the U.S., and\nhad information on education. Of these 3188 reported their age at\nmenarche and within this group 2657 reported their childhood\nmilk consumption. The sample of 2657 women included for\nanalysis here did not differ in age at menarche, education, or\nfrequency of childhood milk intake from the larger set of\nNHANES women in this age group. Fewer women in the sample\nwere born outside of the United States (10% vs. 16%), and as\nnoted, the sample was restricted to the three ethnic groups. No\nadditional information is available about when a woman migrated\nto the U.S, or the country of origin (aside from Mexico). The\nsample was limited to women age 20\u00ad49 years to avoid cohort\neffects on menarche age and milk consumption and recall\ninaccuracies with advancing age. There was no association\nbetween current age among women in this sample and their\nreported age at menarche or frequency of childhood milk intake.\nFor girls in NHANES, 8\u00ad11 year-olds were asked only if they\nhad reached menarche yet while those age 12+ were also asked for\ntheir age at menarche if they had reached it. No 8 year-olds with\ninformation on covariates of interest reported attaining menarche,\nso the sample was restricted to those age 9 yrs and older. A 24-h\nrecall provided data on milk and dairy intake and participants\nwere queried about the frequency of milk intake over the past 30\ndays. Since both the amount and frequency of milk consumption\ndecline markedly during adolescence in the NHANES sample,\nolder adolescents who reported their age at menarche cannot be\nused to assess milk-menarche relationships as current intake is not\na reliable measure of pre-menarcheal intake. Therefore the sample\nwas restricted to 9\u00ad12 yr olds as milk and dairy intake (milk g,\ndairy kcal, daily vs. non-daily milk intake in the past 30 days) did\nnot vary by age within this age range.\nbelonged to one of the 3 ethnic groups, 1076 had birth weight and\nBMI information, 1048 reported their menarche status, and of\nreported their frequency of milk intake over the past 30 days. Girls\nin the sample did not differ from the whole NHANES population\nof girls in this age group with respect to their likelihood of early\nmenarche, BMI, birth weight, milk intake from the 24-h recall, or\nthe frequency with which they reported daily milk consumption.\nNHANES provides a full nutrient analysis of all foods consumed\nand total nutrient intake from the 24-h recall. For this analysis all\ntypes of fluid milk (plain and flavored milk, buttermilk, and\nreconstituted powdered milk) were aggregated to provide total\nbeverage milk intake. A summary measure of other dairy product\nintake (yogurt, cheese, and ice cream) was also calculated from the\n24-h recall. The 30-day milk consumption frequency variable was\nrecoded into a dichotomous variable (daily vs. less frequent intake),\ndue to the low number of girls who reported never or rarely\nAll results are reported as means (SE) or proportions of the\nsample. X2 tests were used to determine differences in frequencies\nacross categories, and linear regression with categorical variables\nwas used to assess mean differences among milk or dairy categories.\nFor adult women, linear regression was used to ascertain the\ncontribution of milk intake frequency at 5\u00ad12 years to variation in\nreported age at menarche, controlling for other covariates including\nethnicity, education, and whether or not the respondent was born in\nthe U.S. Cox regression was employed to assess the risk of reaching\nmenarche before age 12 using the same covariates.\nFor girls age 9\u00ad12 yrs Cox regression was also used to ascertain\nwhether frequency or amount of milk intake or total dairy kcal\naffected the probability of reaching menarche before age 12 yrs.\nCox regression allows for censored data, and so girls under age\n12 yrs who had not yet reached menarche can be included in the\nanalysis. This method of analysis has been used with other cross-\nsectional datasets, including NHANES III, to compare risk of\nmenarche among girls age 10\u00ad16 [28], and in analyses of entry\ninto menopause [64,65]. Here age is a measure of ``time at risk''\nand the data are right-censored (e.g. the 9 yr olds have not made it\nthrough the entire age period of risk). Ethnicity, birth weight, total\nkcal intake (from the 24-h recall) were used as covariates in the\nbase model Cox regression. Overweight status (BMII$85th\npercentile; less than 3% of the sample was underweight [,5th%ile\nfor BMI] and none of those girls reported early menarche, so the\nunderweight category was combined with the normal weight\npercentile, $75th percentile), percentiles based on the WHO/\nNCHS standard [66] were added to see if they mediated any\nrelationship between milk and risk of early menarche. Hazard\nratios for tertiles of milk intake (g), total dairy intake (kcal), dairy\nprotein (g), dairy calcium (mg), dairy fat (g), total fat (g) and total\ncalcium (mg), along with daily/less frequent 30-day milk intake\nand milk consumption in the past 24 h (none vs. any amount),\noverweight status, and height percentile grouping were calculated.\nResults\nSample characteristics are presented in Table 1. Most women\nreported daily milk intake from ages 5\u00ad12 yrs; only 8% reported\ndrinking it rarely or never. This varied by ethnicity and\nimmigration status. Many fewer White women reported drinking\nmilk rarely or never as children than Mexican-Americans or\nBlacks, while women born outside the U.S. were more likely to\nreport rarely/never drinking milk than those born in the U.S.\nBlack women reported earlier menarche than Whites, and had the\nhighest frequency of early menarche. Women born in the U.S. had\nearlier menarche than those born elsewhere. Education had no\nrelationship to milk consumption or age at menarche and was\ndropped as a covariate in subsequent analyses.\nRegression coefficients for predicting age at menarche (in years)\nare presented in Table 2. Mexican-Americans and Blacks had\nlower ages at menarche than Whites, and women who were born\noutside of the U.S. had higher ages at menarche than those born\nin the U.S. Differences among the groups were independent of\nmilk intake during childhood. The association between frequency\nof milk consumption during childhood and age at menarche\nsuggests a negative association, although differences between the\n``rarely/never'' group (the referent group) and the ``sometimes/\nvariable'' or daily intake groups were statistically significant only at\nAs shown in Table 2, in Cox regression there was no difference\nin the risk of menarche before 12 yrs between those reporting\ndrinking milk ``sometimes/varied'' (HR: 1.20, P,0.42) or daily\n(HR: 1.25, P,0.23) and those who rarely or never consumed milk.\nThe same pattern of ethnic group differences was found for early\nmenarche, with Blacks and Mexican-Americans almost twice as\nlikely as Whites to report early menarche. Those born in the U.S.\nhad greater odds of reaching early menarche than those born\nelsewhere.\nCharacteristics of the sample of girls age 9\u00ad12 years are in\nTable 3. Almost 19% of all girls in this age group reported that\nthey had reached menarche prior to age 12, although since many\nMilk Intake and Early Menarche\nwere still below age 12, this is not the true rate of early menarche\nin the sample. Milk grams, total dairy kcal, total kcal, total\ncalcium, and % overweight did not vary by age in the sample, with\nthe exception of the 11 yr olds, who consumed less milk and dairy\ncalcium than the 10 yr olds and less total calcium than all other\nages. Girls who reported less than daily milk consumption\nconsumed significantly less milk g, dairy calcium, and total\ncalcium than those reporting daily consumption (all P,0.001).\nThere were no significant differences in age among 3 ethnic\ngroups, while milk and total dairy consumption did vary by ethnic\ngroup with Blacks consuming the least milk g and Whites\nconsuming the most total dairy kcal. There were no ethnic\ndifferences in frequency of milk intake. Blacks were more likely to\nbe overweight than Whites but not Mexican-Americans. Over-\nweight girls reported drinking significantly less milk than those\nwith lower BMIs, although 30 day frequency of milk consumption\nand total dairy kcal and other nutrients did not vary by overweight\nstatus. Girls with height ,25th percentile drank less milk than\nthose with heights $75th percentile.\nAs shown in Table 4, after controlling for birth weight, ethnic\ngroup and total kcal, total dairy kcal, protein or calcium, and\nfrequency of milk intake over the past 30 days each had no\nassociation with the risk of menarche prior to 12 yrs in Cox\nregression. The only associations were with milk g intake from the\n24-h recall, dairy fat, and total calcium. Girls in the middle tertile\nof milk g intake had a lower risk of early menarche than those in\nthe highest tertile after controlling for birth weight, ethnicity, and\ntotal energy intake, although significance was marginal (HR: 0.6,\nP,0.06) and there was no difference in risk between the highest\nand lowest tertiles. Those in the lowest tertiles of dairy fat intake\nhad an increased risk of early menarche compared those in the\nhighest tertile (lowest tertile HR: 1.5, P,0.05; middle tertile HR:\n1.6, P,0.07 compared to the highest). A lower risk of early\nmenarche was found among girls in the middle tertile of calcium\nintake (HR: 0.6, P,0.05) than those in the highest tertile.\nControlling for milk intake, total calcium, and dairy fat in the same\nequation resulted in the same pattern (milk intake second tertile\nTable 1.

Controlling for the same\ncovariates (ethnic group, whether the woman was born in the\nU.S.), milk consumption at 5\u00ad12 yrs was similarly weakly related\nto height in this sample (b = 0.84, P,0.06) and height and age at\nmenarche were positively associated (P,0.001). These consistent\nresults suggest that inaccuracy in recall of age at menarche is not\nTable 5.

There was no difference in the risk of early\nmenarche among women reporting different frequencies of milk\nintake during childhood. Likewise, among 9\u00ad12 year old girls there\nwas no relationship between frequency of milk intake in the past\n30 days and early menarche.\nThere was a negative relationship between quantity of milk\nconsumed in the past 24 hrs and risk of early menarche for girls 9\u00ad\n12 yrs. Girls in the second tertile of milk intake had a lower risk of\nearly menarche than did those in the highest tertile. This\nassociation was strengthened after controlling for height as well\nas total calcium and dairy fat; thus milk's relationship to early\nmenarche is not mediated by associations between milk consump-\ntion and childhood height or calcium or dairy fat. Total calcium\nhad a positive effect on the risk of early menarche, while greater\ndairy fat intake was associated with a lower risk of early menarche,\nassociations that remained after controlling for overweight, height\npercentile, and total milk intake. Other studies had suggested that\ngreater intake of milk or milk-related nutrients such as calcium,\nprotein, or fat contributed to earlier menarche [30,31,32]}. In this\nstudy only greater total calcium and milk intake contributed to a\nhigher risk of early menarche in this sample from NHANES 1999\u00ad\n2004. Calcium intake was correlated with overall dairy intake\non average only 35% of total calcium intake came from dairy\nproducts.\nThe finding that greater dairy fat intake was associated with a\nlower risk of early menarche was unexpected but it was a\nconsistent and strong finding. It may be that dairy fat is strongly\ncorrelated with an unmeasured variable that is related to early\nmenarche. It was significantly higher among girls reporting daily\nmilk intake, and this may be a marker for other behaviors that are\nthemselves associated with later menarche.\nEthnic differences in age at menarche were consistent with\nother surveys [27,30] and were independent of differences in milk\nintake. Among adult women, Blacks and Mexican-Americans were\nmore likely to reach menarche early, but in the sample of girls 9\u00ad\n12 yrs only Blacks had a higher risk of early menarche than\nWhites, and this disappeared after controlling for overweight,\nsuggesting that the variation in early menarche was mediated by\nethnic differences in BMI.\ngreater height were associated with higher probabilities of early\nmenarche. Overweight girls had roughly twice the risk of early\nmenarche than those of lower BMIs; girls at or above the 75th\npercentile for height had a risk that was 1.5 times those between\nthe 25th and 75th percentiles and 5.5 times those with heights less\nthan the 25th percentile. Height and BMI percentiles were strongly\nindependently predicted risk of early menarche. Although these\nmeasures were assessed at the girl's current age, which for 18.6%\nof the sample was post-menarche, the use of broad categories\n(overweight vs. normal/underweight and 3 height groups) rather\nthan individual specific percentiles reduced the likelihood that\ntheir index changed after achieving menarche. Studies have found\nthat BMI and height are not greater for up to 4 yrs post-menarche\nfor girls with early menarche compared with those with later\nmenarche [68,69] and that BMI is affected by other pubertal\nmarkers but not menarcheal status among adolescent girls [70].\nOthers have shown that greater height and BMI are evident in\nearly menarcheal girls pre- but not post-menarche [22], that body\nfat does not change with menarcheal status among peri-\nmenarcheal girls [71], and that girls are likely to stay in their\nsame percentile of fatness as they mature [72].\nAlso consistent with some studies of older children [73,74,75], but\nnot others [38,76,77], was a negative association between milk intake\nand overweight although here the relationship was limited to milk\nintake and not to overall dairy intake, calcium, or milk consumption\nfrequency. Controlling for overweight and height did not change the\nrelationship between milk and early menarche, suggesting that\nunderlying connections between milk and body size are not\nmediating the relationship between milk and early menarche.\nPrevious analyses of NHANES data suggest that milk\nconsumption in earlier childhood is associated with both greater\nheight and BMI, after controlling for birth weight [55,56],\nalthough milk intake in the ages leading up to menarche (6\u00ad\n11 yrs) is not associated with height [54]. Rapid early growth or\ngains in BMI, especially when preceded by impaired fetal growth,\nconsumption in early childhood may contribute to accelerated\nmenarche by upregulating early growth in body size. Thus milk\nmay be related to menarche through its contributions to somatic\ngrowth and other mechanisms related to reproductive maturation.\nOr it may act via a common pathway (e.g. IGF-I, although dairy\nprotein was not related to early menarche in this study), as IGF-I is\ninvolved in both somatic growth and reproductive maturation\n[79]. IGF-I has been correlated with milk and calcium intake, but\nnot with fat intake among adolescent girls [80]. Longitudinal\nstudies that follow young children's growth, milk consumption,\nand subsequent sexual maturation and IGF-I are necessary to\nassess these relationships.\nDairy intake may be a marker for other dietary behaviors or\nrelated to physical activity, which was not evaluated here. NHANES\ndoes provide data on physical activity, but it is measured differently\nfor children ,12 yrs and 12+ yrs, and thus it could not be used for\nthis sample. If dairy intake is correlated with physical activity,\nparticularly strenuous exercise, this may contribute to changes in\nBMI and menarche. However, surveys of female adolescent athletes\nsuggest no difference in dairy intake with non-athletes [81] or lower\nintake due to concerns about weight gain [82,83].\nOther limitations of this study include the fact that NHANES is\na cross-sectional study, so causal relationships cannot be\ndetermined; the need to use current dietary data for girls, which\nmay not be an accurate marker of long term intake in childhood;\nthe use of current height and BMI, which for almost 19% of girls\nwas post-menarche; reliance on a single 24-h recall, which is\nsubject to both under- and over-reporting and which may not be\nindicative of overall dietary habits [84,85]; and the potential\ncorrelations between milk intake and other characteristics that\nmay influence age at menarche. In addition, adult data on milk\nconsumption and age at menarche are based on recall of events\nthat may be quite distant in the past (e.g. the oldest women in the\nstudy are recalling their milk intake from age 5\u00ad12 yrs, which is\n37\u00ad44 yrs prior). Other researchers have used these data to gauge\nthe relationship between childhood milk intake and fracture rates\nin post-menopausal women [86]. On the whole, studies that assess\nthe match between recall of dietary behavior in the distant past\nand reported intake from historical questionnaires have reported a\nrange of results from high to low correlations, including for milk or\ndairy products specifically [87]. Furthermore, some studies report\nthat recall diminishes with age, while others report no age effect\n[87]. Recall of menarcheal age may also be faulty for women,\nalthough one study showed that it was equally likely to be\noverestimated by 1 year as underestimated by 1 year [88].\nIn sum, cows' milk may be a unique food in the human diet in\nits capacity to alter life history trajectories as they unfold during\nchildhood. Its ability to do so appears unrelated or in addition to\nits macronutrient profile (e.g. calcium). Dairy products, in which\nMilk Intake and Early Menarche\nbioactive milk ingredients are altered or rendered inactive, may\nnot have the same effects. It may be that milk consumption, which\nevolutionarily would have been limited to very young children,\nsends physiological signals that regulate somatic growth and\ndevelopment as well as reproductive maturation, and insofar as\nsomatic growth in height or BMI is related to age at menarche,\nmilk consumption may have both immediate as well as indirect or\nlonger-term impacts on the timing of sexual maturation.\n"
