Tax planning activities by means of transfer-pricing\nor intercompany loans have received much attention as they may be used to substantially\nreduce the burden of corporate income taxes by shifting profits to countries which offer\nfavorable conditions. The corporations' search for favorable tax treatment has also led\ngovernments to pursue strategic tax policies providing special tax schemes which can be\nexploited for savings on corporate income taxes in order to attract multinationals' pro-\nductive activities. As a consequence, many corporations pay little income taxes and the\ntotal revenue from corporate income taxes is typically only a small fraction of government\nrevenue. Thus, governments will be tempted to rely on other tax instruments in order\nto raise fiscal revenue. However, it is often overlooked that the impact of tax policy on\ncorporate decisions is not necessarily confined to corporate income taxes. In fact, a re-\ncent study by Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004) documents that tax payments other than\nincome taxes such as general or specific sales taxes, import duties, property taxes, etc.,\nare usually much larger than income taxes for US multinationals. Each of those taxes\nwill typically influence corporate decisions, and, again, it might be multinationals which\nare most sensitive to those taxes as they are carrying out production and sales in several\ncountries. However, little is known about the consequences of taxes other than income\ntaxes on decisions of multinationals. Desai, Foley, Hines (2004) provide some evidence for\nthe case of U.S.multinationals pointing at a rather strong sensitivity of corporate decisions\nto differences in indirect taxes \u00ad roughly at the same degree as the sensitivity to differences\nin income taxes.\nThis paper reconsiders the empirical evidence of the impact of taxes other than income\ntaxes on corporate decisions. The focus is on multinationals' investment and location\ndecisions where the impact of corporate income taxes is well established (for a survey\nsee deMooij and Ederveen, 2003). Given the heterogeneity between the various types of\npotentially relevant taxes other than corporate income taxes the analysis uses a variety of\ntax indicators capturing sales, property, and excise taxes, import duties as well as taxes\non skilled labor.\nWhile most studies focus on the decision about the distribution of investment among\nalternative locations, it is well recognized (e.g., Devereux and Griffith, 1998) that the\ntaxes might have different effects on location choice, i.e. decisions concerned with the\nchoice to carry out production activities in a specific country. Therefore, the analysis\nbelow considers both investment and location decisions.\nThe empirical analysis employs a large panel of German multinationals. The German case\nis of particular interest as this country usually follows the exemption principle of corporate\nincome taxation. This offers some interesting comparisons with the US case studied by\nDesai, Foley, and Hines (2004), where the tax credit system might result in a relatively low\nsensitivity to corporate income taxes. Thus, one might, a priori, expect that the German\ncase shows a stronger sensitivity to corporate income taxes as compared to other taxes.\nWith regard to the level of FDI the results confirm a strong impact of the cost of capital\nbut also indicate some further significant adverse effects of sales taxes and taxes on skilled\nlabor which are of similar magnitude as the effect of the cost of capital. Apart from\ncorporate income taxes, location decisions are only found to be affected by import duties,\nwhich exert a positive impact.\nThe paper is organized as follows. The next section provides some theoretical background\non the determinants of investment and location. While we do not aim at deriving a com-\nprehensive model of how both corporation and other taxes influence corporate decisions,\nthis background allows us to generate some empirically testable predictions about the po-\ntential impact of various taxes. Based on this discussion, Section 3 develops the empirical\ninvestigation approach. The data are described in Section 4. Section 5 presents the results.\nSection 6 provides our conclusion.\n2 Theoretical Background\nForeign direct investments activities of a multinational basically involve the location deci-\nsion, e.g., the decision of where to locate production and the investment decision of how\nmuch to invest into the production at a location. Following the standard theory of invest-\nment, the latter decision may be considered as a factor input decision. The corresponding\nview here is that given output the firm adjusts its inputs in order to maximize the profits\nat a given location subject to the substitution possibilities of production. In difference\nto the traditional investment literature (e.g., Hassett and Hubbard, 2002), however, the\ninvestment decision in the context of FDI is often interpreted more broadly in the sense\nthat the decision to adjust inputs is combined with the output decision (e.g., Grubert and\nMutti, 1991). Taxes in this more general view would affect the amount of capital invested\nin the production by their impact on the choice of the input combination and the choice\nof the output level of a subsidiary.\nThe location decision is somewhat more complex. Following the seminal contribution by\nMcFadden (1974), location decisions are usually considered as a choice among alterna-\ntive locations based on the expected profits of an investment in each of these locations.\nThis comparison involves not only cost including tax payments but also sales and market\nconditions for the company's product.\nInvestment as well as location decisions might be affected by various taxes. Some first,\nuseful classification might distinguish corporate income taxes, taxes on specific goods and\nservices used as inputs including property taxes and taxes on labor, import duties, and\ngeneral sales taxes. All of these taxes may affect investment and location in a variety of\nways, depending on the details of the tax, the production technologies as well as on the\nmarket conditions under which the firm operates on its input and its output side. Given the\ncomplexity of the tax effects it seems useful to derive testable predictions from somewhat\nmore structured theoretical considerations of corporate location and investment decisions.\nLet us first consider the investment decision starting with a cost-function of company k's\nproduction in country i\nCk,i\n= C ( w\ni\n, v\ni\n, k,i\n, q\ni\n, Yk,i\n) ,\nwhere w\ni\n, v\ni\nis the effective wage rate for unskilled and skilled personnel, respectively, k,i\nmeasures the effective cost of capital, q\ni\nis the effective price of intermediate inputs, and\nYk,i\nis the level of output. Following Devereux and Griffith (1998), w\ni\n, v\ni\n, and q\ni\nare defined\nnet of corporation taxes as the cost of those inputs are assumed to be fully deductible in\ncorporate income taxation. For instance, if the gross wage rate paid is wi\nthe argument in\nthe cost function is w\ni\n) wi\n, where i\nis the statutory corporation tax rate. For\nsimplicity, we abstract from corporate debt and assume that all returns to capital are not\ndeductible in corporate income taxation. Taking account of tax depreciation the cost of\ncapital is defined as\nk,i\n (rk,i\n+ k\ni\n) ,\nwhere the double index to the discount rate rk,i\nreflects the assumption that it is subject\nto some common factors at the level of the company and at the level of the host country.\nIf the multinational has an internal capital market where one affiliate can borrow from\nthe other, the common factor at the level of the company might dominate the discount\nrate such that rk,i\n= rk\n. If the capital markets were completely separated, the common\nfactor at the level of the country would dominate the discount rate rk,i\n= ri\n. Economic\ndepreciation k\nis assumed to be equal across locations and di\ni\ndenotes the tax savings\nfrom the present value of depreciation allowances di\n.\nCapital demand is obtained from the derivative with respect to the cost of capital and will,\nbasically, depend on the same arguments as the cost function\nKk,i\n= K ( w\ni\n, v\ni\n, k,i\n, q\ni\n, Yk,i\n) \nCk,i\ni,k\n.\nMaking use of the homogeneity of degree zero in factor prices we can rewrite this expression\nto obtain\nKk,i\n= K ( wi\n, vi\n, ck,i\n, qi\n, Yk,i\nwhere ck,i\ndenotes the standard user cost of capital\nck,i\n (rk,i\n+ k\n)\ni\n.\nFollowing Devereux and Griffith (1998) the location decision will depend on the evaluation\nof profits at possible locations j=1,...,n.\nyk,i\n= 1, if k,i\n> k,j\n, j = i, and yk,i\nwhere yk,i\n= 0, 1 is a binary variable indicating whether or not the multinational holds an\naffiliate at location i, and k,i\nis the profit at location i in the view of firm k. Making use\nof the unit homogeneity of the cost function in prices, the level of profits at location i is\ndetermined by\nk,i\n) [p (Yk,i\n) Yk,i\n- C ( wi\n, vi\n, ck,i\n, qi\n, Yk,i\nNote that the profit equation as well as the capital input equation (1) include the level\nof output. Of course, the level of output is a choice variable of the company determined\nin order to maximize profits. It is usually determined by the optimality condition that\nmarginal revenue equals marginal cost\np (Yk,i\n)] -\nC ( wi\n, vi\n, ck,i\n, qi\n, Yk,i\n)\nYk,i\nwhere  (Yk,i\n) is the price elasticity of demand. The optimal level of output, hence, depends\non all of the input-prices determining marginal cost as well as on the demand conditions.\nNote that corporate income taxes exert an impact on output only via their influence on\nthe cost of capital.\nEquations (1) and (4) can be used to determine output and capital input and thus provides\na theoretical background for the analysis of the investment decision. Equation (3) defines\nthe profits. Evaluated at all possible locations together with equations (2) and (4) it can be\nused to analyze the location decision. Let us discuss how these decisions may be affected\nby taxes.\n2.1 Taxes and FDI Levels\nConditioning on a positive location decision, equations (1) and (4) will allow us to deter-\nmine the capital input at location i. We see that there are two ways in which the capital\ninput is potentially affected by taxes. The first relates to the substitution possibilities in\nproduction the second relates to the output effects.\nCorporate income taxation will increase the cost of capital relatively and, hence, will cause\na substitution away from capital. This effect is discussed and analyzed in the traditional\nliterature on investment which has emphasized that not only the tax rate but also de-\npreciation allowances matter and that the tax burden will differ for different sources of\nfinance.\nTaxes on goods and services used as inputs, in this setting might induce substitution effects\ntowards capital. However, this is, first of all, a matter of tax incidence. If the inputs or\nservices are inelastically supplied, changes in taxes would not affect the cost of production\nand, thereby, would not affect investment or location decisions. But if taxes on goods\nand services are not born by the suppliers of goods and services they might raise prices\nand hence affect the cost of production which in turn will cause factor substitution within\nthe constraints of the production possibilities. Consider the case of a land tax. If land\nis supplied inelastically one might expect that land owners will carry the full burden of\nthe tax such that the gross of tax price of land is unaffected by the tax. Then, taxes on\nland would not affect investment. However, note that property taxes often tax not only\nland but real estate including structures. Depending on the relative importance of the\nlatter those taxes might raise the cost of capital and cause substitution away from capital.\nAnother example is labor taxation. If labor is supplied inelastically, because workers do\nnot alter participation decisions or if workers are immobile, the burden of taxes on labor\nwould fall on workers. Gross wages would be unaffected by the tax. A different prediction\nwould be obtained under conditions of wage bargaining: if unions oppose to compensate\nhigher labor taxes with lower after-tax wages, tax increases might raise the cost of labor\nand induce substitution towards capital. Taxes on labor would also affect the cost of\nlabor if workers are internationally mobile and demand a competitive after-tax income.\nThis might be relevant in the case of taxes on skilled labor. Due to the relatively large\ninternational mobility of the skilled (OECD, 2002), companies might need to compensate\nthose employees for differences in personal income taxes and social security contributions\nexperienced across locations. These taxes, then, would potentially cause substitution effects\ntowards or against capital depending on the degree of capital-skill complementarity.\nWith regard to import duties we may note that for vertical FDI with important intermediate\ninput linkages between subsidiaries the consequences are similar to those of taxes on goods\nand services. If the foreign subsidiary relies on imports of intermediate inputs, these taxes\nwould affect factor demand depending on the substitution possibilities.\nFor general sales taxes no effect is expected on the input decisions if business to business\ntransactions remain untaxed.\nTaxes might, however, also exert a secondary impact on capital input as they affect the\noutput decision of the firm. Corporate income taxes as well as other taxes might raise the\ncost and, therefore, lead to lower levels of output. This, in turn would exert an adverse\nimpact on capital demand. Of course, this also depends on the substitution possibilities.\nGenerally, the output effects will be strongest with fixed input coefficients where the pro-\nducer has little possibilities to avoid taxation such that the burden falls mainly on the\nproducer.\nTaxes on goods and services used as inputs are expected to have similar effects on output\ndecisions. However, for those taxes the output effect works against possible substitution\neffects such that the total impact on capital input is ambiguous. Thus, the impact of taxes\non labor could be positive, if production in countries with high labor cost tend to be more\ncapital intensive. For taxes on skilled labor, if one is willing to assume some degree of\ncapital-skill complementarity (see, for instance, Duffy, Papageorgiou, and Perez-Sebastian,\n2004), a tax increase seems more likely to exert adverse effects on output.\nFor taxes on intermediate inputs such as import duties we should also expect some adverse\nimpact on output, because it is more costly to produce. With horizontal FDI, however,\nthe effects could be different. Here, import duties might represent the cost of entering a\nmarket from abroad providing an incentive to raise production in the protected markets.\nSince general sales taxes may affect output prices and market conditions the imposition\nof those taxes might affect the marginal revenue in equation (4) and, hence, the output\ndecision of the firm. More specifically, we might expect general sales taxes or the value\nadded tax (VAT) to reduce the demand for the subsidiary's output and, hence, exert a\ndepressing impact on capital input. A further issue in this context is the existence of\nthe destination or origin principle in sales taxation. Whether general sales and valued\nadded taxes will affect location decisions also depends on whether the product of a foreign\nsubsidiary is sold in the foreign country or exported somewhere else. Under the destination\nprinciple the output decision for production intended to be sold within the foreign country\n(horizontal FDI) might be affected adversely, as the tax reduces the demand for the goods\nand services provided and therefore exerts a downward impact on output. If it is intended\njust to produce in a foreign country and then to export to other places (vertical FDI)\ngeneral sales taxes should not matter for output under the destination principle. One\nmight even argue that the effect for multinationals could also be positive as they have\nsome advantage against local producers.\n2.2 Taxes and Location Choice\nLocation choice is affected by taxes if they affect the level of profits earned at a location.\nCorporate income taxation exerts direct and indirect effects on profits. The direct effect\nis simply the reduction of profits after taxes which make a location less attractive. The\nindirect effect is related to the impact on the cost of capital. A reduction in depreciation\nallowances, for instance, will tend to raise the unit cost and thereby further reduce the\nprofits of an investment project. Therefore, both the statutory as well as the marginal tax\nrate on investment will affect location decisions. Provided the channels of finance and the\nrate of profits are given, the effects may be combined using the effective average tax rate\nput forward by Devereux and Griffith (1998).\nAs in the above analysis of taxes and FDI, taxes on goods and services used as inputs\nwill matter only if the tax burden is not shifted to suppliers. Thus, if taxes tend to raise\ninput prices, the cost may rise and the location probability declines. Even if land taxes\nare completely born by land owners, property taxes might still exert an adverse impact on\nlocation if the tax is also imposed on structures. Depending on the relative importance of\nstructures in the tax base, those taxes might also deter location decisions. Taxes on labor\nwould affect the cost of production and, thus, location decisions, if workers are mobile,\ninternationally, and demand a competitive after-tax income, or if other conditions allow\nlabor to shift the tax burden to the employer.\nLocation decisions will also be affected by general sales taxes. Let us assume, for simplicity,\nthat business to business transactions are untaxed (the VAT case), those taxes should not\naffect the demand for capital given output. But if they reduce the marginal revenue\nfrom output they will exert a depressing impact on output; the deterioration of demand\nconditions will further contribute to a reduction in profits. Hence, they should have a\ndampening effect on the location probability. Whether sales taxes will affect location\ndecisions is again further determined by the destination and origin principle. Under the\ndestination principle the location of production intended to be sold within the foreign\ncountry (horizontal FDI) should be affected adversely, since the tax reduces the demand\nfor the goods and services provided and therefore exerts a downward impact on profits. If\nit is intended to produce in a foreign country and then to export to other places (vertical\nFDI), sales taxes should not matter for location decisions under the destination principle.\nFor vertical FDI with important intermediate input linkages between subsidiaries the con-\nsequences of taxes on imports or import duties are similar to those of taxes on goods\nand services. If the foreign subsidiary relies on imports of intermediate inputs, these taxes\nwould raise the cost of production and we would expect an adverse effect on location. With\nhorizontal FDI, however, the effects will be different. Here, import duties might represent\ncost of serving a market from abroad. This points at an incentive to locate production in\nthe protected markets.\n3 Investigation Approach\nWhile the impact of corporate income taxes is explicitly taken into account, the impact\nof other taxes is only implicit in the above specification of the investment and location\ndecisions. The above discussion clarified that additional assumptions are need in order to\nidentify tax effects. What kind of assumptions are useful, however, also depends on the\ninvestigation approach taken. Therefore, let us postpone for a moment the issue of the\nidentification of tax effects and first consider the empirical approach to investment and\nlocation decisions.\nFollowing the capital demand equation (1) a first approach would be to relate the level of\ncapital of firm k in country i to its theoretical determinants. In the cross-sectional con-\ntext, in order to distinguish company effects, indexed with k, from country-level variables,\nindexed with i, it is useful to evaluate this relationship using pooled cross-sections. A\nlinearized empirical specification is\nlog Kk,i,t\nlog wi,t\nlog vi,t\nlog qi,t\ni,t\ndi,t\ni,t\nlog Yi,k,t\n+ k\n+ t\n+ k,i,t\n.\nwhere k\nis a company-specific fixed effect and t\nis a fixed time effect. In order to control\nfor the heterogeneity among affiliates, one might further introduce industry effects at the\nlevel of the affiliate. A problem with this specification is that it contains the output on\nthe right hand side. If we believe that variation in sales reflects changes in exogenous\ndemand conditions this is useful. However, as is depicted by the optimality condition for\nthe output (4) the output itself is chosen in the light of demand and cost conditions. Thus,\nestimation based on (5) runs into difficulties due to simultaneity bias. This suggests to\nemploy a reduced form specification where output is dropped on the right hand side and\nreplaced by some general indicators of the market size, as for instance the log of GDP.\nlog Kk,i,t\nlog wi,t\nlog vi,t\nlog qi,t\ni,t\ndi,t\ni,t\nlog GDPi,t\n+ k\n+ t\n+ k,i,t\n.\nIt is important to note, however, that the parameters in this specification differ from the\nabove specification since they capture the traditional factor demand as well as the output\neffects of local conditions.\nIn comparison to the capital demand the modelling of location decision is more complex\nas it involves the evaluation of expected profits across investment alternatives. In order\nto estimate location probabilities most of the empirical literature on location decisions\nemploys some variant of the conditional logit model developed by McFadden (1974) (e.g.,\nBartik, 1985, Coughlin et al., 1992) which allows for some cross-sectional distribution of\nthe attractiveness of each location. Also Devereux and Griffith (1998) employ a nested\nconditional logit specification which captures the relationship with other decisions reflect-\ning a firm's strategy towards the international markets. However, the conditional logit\napproach is limited to the cross-sectional differences in the determinants of location and\nconflicts with the observation that many companies, every second company in the dataset\nused below, hold more than just one subsidiary abroad, the location of which are hardly\nindependent. Therefore, the analysis below follows Buettner and Ruf (2006) using a panel\ndata approach which proved useful in order to identify the effects of local characteristics\non location probability. More specifically, we study location decisions by estimating a lin-\nearized equation for the propensity of firm k to hold an investment at i, which includes a\nfull set of firm-specific location effects i,k\n, formally:\nyk,i,t\ni,k,t\n> 0, and yi,k,t\n= 0 otherwise,\n\nk,i,t\nlog wi,t\nlog vi,t\nlog qi,t\ni,t\ndi,t\ni,t\nlog GDPi,t\n+ k,i\n+ t\n+ k,i,t\n.\nwhere k,i,t\nis an error term and t\nis a fixed time effect.\nNote that the propensity to invest at location i is modelled without specific reference to\nthe group of choice alternatives j = i. However, the firm-specific location effects will cap-\nture the cross-sectional distribution of the attractiveness of each location. The estimation\nfollows Chamberlain's (1984) fixed-effects logit estimator and models the probability of\nobserving an investment of the considered firm in a specific country in a given year condi-\ntional on the observed frequency of corresponding investments in all years, i.e. conditional\non the value of n\nyk,i,t\n. Conditioning on this value removes the influence of the cross-\nsectional differences in the attractiveness of each location without further distributional\nassumptions.\nWhile the impact of corporate taxes is explicitly taken into account, the impact of other\ntaxes is only implicit in the two estimation equations. Consider first the case of taxes on\ngoods and services used as inputs. Since the prices for inputs are defined as gross prices\nthey would include taxes and, provided the tax incidence is on the demand side, differences\nin taxes would be reflected in differences in the gross prices. In order to identify tax effects\ndirectly, we might replace the gross prices of a factor input by a measure of the tax burden\nplaced on this input. But, if not only taxes but also other country-specific conditions have\nan impact on gross prices, estimation might suffer from omitted variable bias. A powerful\nassumption, therefore, is that the net-of-tax prices of the inputs are equal across countries\ndue to trade or mobility. Thus, if qi,t\ni,t\nqt\n, we could replace log qi,t\nin the two\nestimation equations by the tax rate on the input q\ni,t\nin combination with the time-fixed\neffect. The same approach might be taken in the case of skilled labor, where we would\nneed to assume that mobility is sufficient in order to ensure equal net-of-tax earnings for\nskilled workers. This would allow us to replace log vi,t\nby the tax rate on skilled labor h\ni,t\n,\nagain, in combination with the time-fixed effect. Import duties might be captured in the\nsame way as taxes on goods and services used as inputs assuming that net-of-tax import\nprices are equal across countries. Note that in all the cases where identification relies on\ntrade and mobility it is useful to introduce some distance variable if no country fixed effects\nare imposed. The conditions for the identification of the effects of general sales taxes are\nsomewhat more straighforward. So far, the estimation equations above only use GDP in\norder to capture the market conditions in the host country. This might well be augmented\nby an additional term capturing the tax burden on sales. However, whether or not an\nimpact of taxes can be identified empirically, also depends on the data available. We will\ncome back to this issue in the following data section.\nThe empirical analysis employs a micro database for FDI provided by the German Bun-\ndesbank which includes a comprehensive annual database of foreign direct investment po-\nsitions of German enterprizes held abroad. In its current version, firm-level panel data are\navailable for the period 1996 to 2003. The collection of the data is enforced by German\nlaw, which determines reporting mandates for certain international activities. For further\ndescription the interested reader might consult Buettner and Ruf (2006) and Lipponer\n(2006). In the current study, we exclude FDI in the financial sector as well as investments\nin holdings, since we are basically interested in the tax effects of the location of productive\ncapital. We also exclude firms which report zero investment or zero sales. Also branches\nor partnerships are excluded. Table 1 provides some descriptive statistics on the size and\ndistribution of FDI stocks of German multinationals.\nTax data are taken from a variety of sources. Statutory tax rates for corporate taxation are\ntaken from Devereux, Griffith, and Klemm (2002). Another variable taken from this source\nis the present value of depreciation allowances. A further variable related to corporate\nincome taxes is an indicator of whether a special tax credit is available for research and\ndevelopment. The corresponding variable (R&D Tax Credits) is taken from a recent IBFD\nsurvey and shows a value of unity in this case.\nSales Taxes & VAT, Excises, Import Duties, as well as Property Taxes are all taken from\nrevenue data and follow the usual OECD classification. The source is the OECD Revenue\nStatistics and all of these variables are expressed as percentage of GDP. Sales Taxes &\nVAT (OECD category: 5110) include all taxes levied on the production, leasing, transfer,\ndelivery or sales of goods and services. For this category it does not make any difference\nwhether the good or services are imported or produced domestically. Hence, it covers\nvalue-added taxes, sales taxes and multi-stage cumulative taxes. Excises (OECD category:\n5121) are all taxes on particular products other than general sales taxes and import or\nexport duties, respectively. This includes, in particular, taxes on energy sources. Import\nDuties (OECD category: 5123) are customs and duties to imported products. Not included\nare, however, general sales taxes or excises to imported goods (see above). Property Taxes\n(OECD category: 4000) comprises taxes on the use, ownership or transfer of property. Not\nincluded are, for example, taxes on capital gains from sales of property, or property taxes\ntaking into account personal circumstances of the taxpayer - these are classified as income\ntaxes. Of course, all these tax indicators capture only some potential determinants of input\ncost, which may or may not show up in the gross prices, depending on the tax incidence.\nWhether or not the empirical specification is able to detect the effects of these taxes\nalso hinges on the problem whether there are further conditions which cause international\ndifferences in the input prices. For excises and import duties this may not be a big problem\nif the former is mainly related to fuel prices and the latter refers to traded goods both of\nwhich might show similar pre-tax prices across countries. The approach, however, might be\nless convincing with regard to property taxes given the strong heterogeneity in the markets\nfor real estate.\nWith regard to labor taxes it seems particularly difficult to argue that gross wage differences\nare only driven by differences in the tax burden. For instance, unions or unemployment\ninsurance might exert further important effects on the gross wages. Hence, with regard to\nlabor we do not attempt to identify the impact of labor taxes, and instead use a comprehen-\nsive indicator of labor cost including gross wages as well as taxes on labor input at the level\nof the employer. The corresponding labor cost data is taken from U.S. Bureau of Labor\nStatistics. It reports hourly compensation costs for production workers in manufacturing\nincluding taxes paid by the employer and before taxes paid by the employee expressed in\nU.S. Dollars. However, controlling for the average cost of labor, the analysis below tests for\nan impact of taxes on skilled labor. Here, the assumption is that skilled labor may receive\nrather similar remuneration after taxes. This is related to the much higher mobility of\nthe skilled, in particular, within multinational corporations (expatriates). Building on this\nhypothesis, Elschner and Schwager (2005) develop an indicator of the effective average tax\nrate for skilled labor. The measurement method is comparable to the OECD (1992) Taxing\nFigure 1: Corporate Income and Skilled Labor Taxes\n-\nin %\nSkilled Labor Taxes\nin %\nStatutory Corp.\nIncome Tax Rate\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\nIR\nCH\nNO\nSW\nFI\nUK\nBE\nAU\nNL\nFR\nIT\nSP\nGE\nUS\nWages approach. The tax wedges are calculated by taking the difference between labor\ncost to the employer and a uniform level of net income of the employee. In doing so, the\nmethod combines the effects of personal income taxes, social security contributions and\nfamily cash benefits on net incomes of employees. Figure 1 shows the values for several\nEU countries plotted against the statutory corporation tax rate.\nA final source of tax data used in the empirical analysis is more similar to Desai, Foley,\nand Hines (2004). Using a large microdataset for companies (Worldscope) we calculated\nindicators based on individual income and cost statements for companies which include the\namount of (corporate) income taxes and other taxes paid. While income taxes are scaled\nwith pre-tax profits, other taxes are scaled by the total amount of sales; a third indicator is\nsimply based on the ratio of other to income taxes. The resulting indicator in each case is\nthe median of the figures reported by all companies located in a country in the respective\nyear. As is depicted in Table 2 the data points at large differences across countries and\nperiods. The mean across countries and years confirms the finding of Desai, Foley, and\nHines (2004) that other taxes usually amount to larger figures than income taxes.\nApart from tax data, the analysis uses controls for GDP, distance, and the level of corrup-\ntion in order to capture other potentially relevant determinants of investment and location.\nAs in Egger and Winner (2006) we use corruption perception data from Transparency In-\nternational. See appendix for further description.\nThe empirical analysis is concerned with the determinants of the level of PPE invested by\na German parent company in a foreign subsidiary as well as with the underlying location\ndecision for a sample of 18 countries for which sufficient data on taxes and other relevant\nlocal conditions is available over a period of 8 years (1996-2003). Consider first the de-\nterminants of the stock of PPE following specification (6). Table 3 reports corresponding\nresults. In column (1) the impact of corporation taxes is captured by the statutory cor-\nporate income tax rate and the present value of tax depreciation allowances, interacted\nwith the tax rate. While the signs match theoretical expectations, the statutory tax rate\nis insignificant. GDP exerts the usual strong positive effect, and also the corruption index\nconfirms expectations indicating that investment is lower in countries with high levels of\n(perceived) corruption. Specification (2) adds a dummy variable indicating the presence\nof special tax privileges for R&D expenditures. This specification yields some significance\nfor the statutory tax rate and also for the presence of R&D tax credits. Remarkably, both\nspecifications support a positive impact of the local lending rate. This is somewhat puz-\nzling at first sight, but we should note that multinationals may use intercompany loans in\norder to circumvent adverse lending conditions in one country (Desai, Foley, and Hines,\n2004b). One might speculate whether this gives multinationals an advantage against local\nfirms. Specification (3) to (7) report the results of estimations including various indirect\ntaxes. Sales taxes, but also excise taxes exert significant negative effects. Import duties\non the other hand exert positive effects. While the property tax rate proves insignificant,\njoint estimation (7) supports adverse effects for property taxes as well as for Sales Taxes\n& VAT. This last specification shows the best fit. In this specification, the relative size of\nthe two coefficients for the statutory tax rate and its interaction with the present value of\ndepreciation allowances conforms with the view that FDI is affected by corporate income\ntaxes via their impact on the cost of capital. In the light of the theory, the significance of\nthe sales taxes would indicate that horizontal FDI is important where the sales taxes exert\nan adverse effect on demand conditions.\nLet us briefly consider the magnitude of effects. Evaluated at the mean, the tax elasticity\nof FDI with regard to the statutory corporation tax rate is at 0.83 which is larger than the\naverage figure of 0.6 found in the literature (cf., Hines, 1999). The elasticity with regard to\nSales Taxes & VAT taxes is at about 0.73. However, it should be noted that the tax variable\nrelates to revenue data and, therefore, combines the tax code with the activities of the tax\npayers and the tax administration. This makes it difficult to compare the magnitudes.1\nNevertheless, the results support the result of Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004) that indirect\ntaxes exert effects on FDI which are as strong as those of the corporation tax.\nTable 4 reports results where, in addition, the tax burden on skilled labor is included. Note\nthat this variable is not available for the whole sample \u00ad 5 countries had to be excluded\nresulting in a considerable loss of variation in taxes. Nevertheless, the results support a\nsignificant adverse effect of this tax rate. Again, the specification including all taxes shows\nthe best fit. It also confirms the adverse effects of sales taxes. While this specification no\nlonger supports an impact of property taxes, excise taxes now show a significant effect.\n1As there are always difficulties to enforce the tax code and since agents typically adjust their activities\nin order to avoid taxation we should expect that the use of revenue data underestimates the tax rate\nelasticities.\nTaken together, the results for the level of FDI support some adverse effects not only for\nthe corporate income taxes but also for sales and value added taxes. Further significance\nis found for the taxation of skilled labor. The results for corporation income taxes are\nconsistent with the view that their impact is basically due to an increase in the cost of\ncapital. The strong result for the taxation of skilled labor points at some complementarity\nbetween capital and skilled labor. The finding for the general sales taxes might be taken\nto indicate an adverse impact of those taxes on the size of the market.\nTables 5 and 6 provide results for the location decision. While the tables display, basically,\nthe same set of determinants as in the case of the analysis of the FDI-level, it is important\nto note that a fixed effects logit estimation is reported which removes the cross-sectional\ndifferences in the locational attractiveness. This constraints our ability to detect significant\nimpacts of taxes, since the available variation is reduced. Nevertheless, the results support\na significant effect of all control variables (Distance and R&D Tax Credit are removed as\nthese variable shows only cross-sectional variation). Not only is the level of corruption\nfound to exert adverse effects on location probability, but also the local lending rate shows\nsignificant effects. The latter result is remarkable as we know from the study of corporate\nfinance decisions of multinationals (Desai, Foley, Hines, 2004b) that multinationals have\nsome advantage against local firms due to the possible substitution of local debt by means\nof intercompany loans.2 The positive coefficient suggests that this advantage might induce\nmultinationals to locate in countries with less favorable credit market conditions. Further-\nmore, we find an impact of the statutory corporation tax, while depreciation allowances\ndo not matter. Note that this is in some accordance with Devereux and Griffith (1998)\nwho argue that location decisions are not driven by the marginal tax rate but by some\ncombination of marginal and statutory tax rate. The finding is also in accordance with\nBuettner and Ruf (2006) who find that the statutory tax rate has a stronger predictive\npower for location decisions than effective tax rates. All other tax indicators prove insignif-\n2A companion paper (Buettner, Overesch, Schreiber, Wamser, 2006) shows that the local lending rate\nvariable exerts similar effects on the corporate finance of the German multinationals considered and that\nthe variation in the lending rate is a sufficient statistic for the local credit market conditions.\nicant, except for the import duties. This finding is consistent with the view that barriers\nto trade induce multinationals to locate production in the protected countries.\nAs a final empirical exercise further estimations have been carried out using the income\nand other tax variables generated from company accounts. While the results support some\nadverse effect of income taxes in addition to the statutory corporate income tax rates,\nother taxes failed to show a significant effect on both investment and location. However,\nthis might well be attributable to the rather strong variation of those tax measures within\ncountries together with a serious reduction in the samples size resulting from the lack of\ndata availability.\n6 Conclusions\nThis paper has reconsidered the empirical evidence for an impact of taxes other than\ncorporate income taxes on the level and location of FDI of German multinationals. Based\non a standard theoretical framework of investment and location decisions, the paper started\nwith a discussion of the potential impact of various taxes on input allocation, output\nas well as location decisions. The discussion emphasized the role of tax incidence for\nthe consequences of taxes other than corporate income taxes and the necessity of further\nassumptions in order to identify tax effects empirically.\nThe panel data analysis of the level of capital invested in property, plant, and equipment\nby German multinationals in 18 foreign OECD countries adds some support to the study of\nDesai, Foley, and Hines (2004) which found significant effects not only of direct but also of\nindirect taxes for the case of US multinationals. More specifically, the results show a role of\ncorporate income taxes via the cost of capital and, in fact, indicate some further significant\nadverse effects of sales taxes on the investment position. The magnitude of effects on the\nlevel of capital invested is found to be comparable to those of the corporation tax. The\nimpact of sales taxes points at some adverse demand effects of those taxes. Another tax\nvariable which proves significant is the tax on skilled labor. The results point at a negative\nimpact of similar magnitude as that of the corporate income tax. This impact of taxes\non skilled labor conforms with theoretical predictions if we assume that this type of labor\nis mobile internationally and if there is some capital-skill complementarity. Some further\nsignificance of other tax variables is detected only in single specifications but proves not\nto be robust across specifications.\nIn contrast to the analysis of the level of FDI, the analysis of location decisions reveals no\nsignificance of taxes other than corporate income taxes. Location decisions are only found\nto be affected by import duties, which, however, exert a positive impact. This is consistent\nwith the view that multinationals show a higher propensity to place production in markets\nwhich are protected from imports.\nWe cannot preclude, however, that some of the other tax variables used in the investi-\ngation failed to show significant effects not because they were irrelevant for location and\ninvestment but because there are other important determinants of cost or output market\nconditions which are not taken into account in the investigation approach. Nevertheless,\nthe results suggest that policies devoted to attract investments of multinationals already\npresent in their country should care for low cost of capital, low sales taxes, as well as low\ntaxation of skilled labor. Policies aiming at an attraction of subsidiaries of foreign multi-\nnationals should reduce corporate income tax rates. Abolition of import duties, however,\nmight exert adverse effects on the location propensity.\nDatasources and Definitions\nFirm-level data are taken from the micro-dataset of the Bundesbank, see Lipponer\nGDP in U.S. Dollars, nominal.
