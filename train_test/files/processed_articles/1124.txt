Poststratification sampling weights gener-\nated nationally representative estimates.\nResults: Overall HPV prevalence was 26.9% and as high as 14.3%\namong women with 1 lifetime partner but did not vary by geographic\nregion. High-risk types were detected in 20%; 10% were infected\nwith types in current candidate vaccines. HPV infection was indepen-\ndently associated with mixing sex with alcohol, a black partner, >3\nlifetime sex partners, being single, and illegal drug use. Having a\ncurrent sex partner and receptive oral sex were inversely associated\nwith HPV.\nConclusion: HPV prevalence was high throughout the country,\neven among women with only 1 lifetime partner, suggesting early and\nwidespread rather than targeted immunization of young women.\nOVER 50% OF SEXUALLY active adults in the United States\nacquire 1 or more of the 35 types of human papillomavirus (HPV)\nthat infect the genital tract at least once in their lifetimes.1 Invasive\ncervical cancer, which is almost exclusively associated with per-\nsistent infection with 1 or more \"high-risk\" HPV types, ranks\namong the top 10 causes of cancer mortality for women in the\nUnited States and, with breast cancer, is among the top 2 causes\nglobally.2 HPV-16 and -18 have most commonly been associated\nwith cancer of the cervix, but numerous other high-risk types also\nas probable high-risk types,3 and additional high- and low-risk\ntypes continue to be identified. These oncogenic HPV types are\nalso associated with cancer of the vulva, vagina, penis, and anus.\nTypes 6 and 11 are low-risk types and most frequently associated\nwith genital warts.\nRecent trials of an HPV-16 viruslike particle (VLP) vaccine, a\nvaccine in young adult women have shown high levels of protec-\nagainst genital warts and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia associ-\nated with these types.4\u00ad6 Phase III clinical trials with multivalent\nHPV vaccines are now under way, and an effective vaccine will\nlikely soon be available. Developing strategies for using such a\nvaccine requires empirical data on the population prevalence of\nHPV infection and the distribution of types.\nAlthough numerous studies of HPV infection in the United\nStates have been performed, virtually all have been conducted in\nsubsets of the general population. Among young college women,\nHPV prevalence has ranged from 20% to 46%,7\u00ad9 and in clinic-\nbased populations, prevalence as high as 64% has been reported.10\nRisk factors for HPV infection identified through these studies\ning sex with alcohol,8 and partner and partnership characteris-\na select segment of society, and there are questions about the\ngeneralizeability of these findings. Clearly, prevalence of sexually\ntransmitted infections (STI) differs between general population\nand clinic samples, yet studies of STI other than HPV demonstrate\nthat risk factors identified in clinic-based populations are largely\nconfirmed in general population samples. However, the use of a\nclinic-based study population overcontrols for factors associated\nwith clinic-specific care-seeking behaviors, and such studies may\nfail to identify the full spectrum of risk factors associated with any\ngiven infection.19 The sole investigations of HPV in the U.S.\ngeneral population to date estimated the prevalence of serum\nantibodies to a single type, HPV-16.20,21 In preparation for an\nimminent HPV vaccine, the International Agency for Research on\nThis research uses data from Add Health, a program project designed by\nJ.
