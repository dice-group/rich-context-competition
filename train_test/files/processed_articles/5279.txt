    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study aimed to investigate the different dimensions of well-being (namely, work engagement, job satisfaction, and\npsychological stress) and possible predictors such as personality and perceived organizational support. A cross-sectional\nsurvey design was used, with a sample of 490 ambulance personnel in the United Kingdom. Significant correlations were\nfound between the dimensions of job satisfaction, engagement, and stress. The results also supported a hierarchical\nmodel with job satisfaction, stress, and engagement loading onto one higher order factor of work well-being. Emotional\nstability and perceived organizational support were identified as significant predictors of well-being. The findings suggest\nthe importance of measuring the work-related well-being of ambulance personnel holistically and present perceived\norganizational support as a possible area for interventions to improve well-being.\n",

Studies comparing well-being across occupations\nhave highlighted ambulance services as one of six voca-\ntions with greater work-related stress, and physical and\npsychological well-being (Johnson etal., 2005). Another\nstudy by Young and Cooper (1997) also found that ambu-\nlance workers report lower job satisfaction, lower physical\nand psychological health, and greater burnout. Within the\nUnited Kingdom specifically, ambulance personnel have\nhigher rates of premature retirement compared to other\nhealthcare staff, due to poor mental and physical health\nDespite being identified as a high-risk occupation,\nthere has been relatively little research on the well-being\nof ambulance service workers (Bennett etal., 2004). The\nfirst, and latest, systematic review of the literature in this\narea was conducted by Sterud etal. (2006), regarding the\nphysical and psychological problems among ambulance\nservice staff. Sterud and colleagues found that a majority\nof the studies were related to psychopathology in ambu-\nlance personnel. In particular, most studies examined the\nprevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD;\nder Ploeg and Kleber, 2003) and the relevant coping strat-\nMarmar etal., 1999). After measures of mental health,\nstudies then focused largely on physical health of ambu-\nliterature hence largely concentrates on evaluating ambu-\nlance personnel well-being in terms of negative outcomes\nsuch as job stress or illness.\nWork-related well-being\nMelinda Soh1, Antonio Zarola1, Kat Palaiou1\nand Adrian Furnham1,2\n Keywords\nadults, anxiety, beliefs, mental illness, worry\n1University College London, UK\n2BI Norwegian Business School, Norway\nCorresponding author:\nAdrian Furnham, Research Department of Clinical, Educational and\nHealth Psychology, University College London, 26 Bedford Way,\nLondon WC1H 0AP, UK.\nEmail: a.furnham@ucl.ac.uk\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \nThis study thus aimed to investigate the predictors,\ndimensions, and factor structure of well-being in emer-\ngency ambulance personnel. The aspects of well-being\nexamined in this study include work engagement, job satis-\nfaction, and job stress, while the predictors include per-\nceived organizational support (POS) and personality.\nDimensionality of well-being\nAmong the various components of psychological well-\nbeing, affective well-being has been demonstrated to be\none of the most important indicators (Warr, 1994).\nAffective well-being is a multi-dimensional construct that\nreflects the frequency which individuals experience vari-\nous different positive and negative affects (Diener and\nLarsen, 1993). Affective well-being can be measured spe-\ncific to a domain and is frequently applied to measure\nwork-related well-being (Warr, 1990). Warr's proposed\ndimensions of affective, work-related well-being include\nenthusiasm\u00addepression (measured by engagement and\nburnout), anxiety\u00adcomfort (measured by occupational\nstress), and pleasure\u00addispleasure (measured by job\nsatisfaction).\nA confirmatory factor analysis conducted by Daniels\n(2000) also proposed a factor solution with multiple related\nbut distinct first-order dimensions (anxiety\u00adcomfort,\ndepression\u00adpleasure, bored\u00adenthusiastic, tiredness\u00advigor,\nand angry\u00adplacid) and two second-order factors that cor-\nrespond to negative and positive affects (Watson and\nTellegen, 1985) as the best fit for measuring work-related\naffective well-being. However, as Daniels' study used a\ngeneral sample population, there is a possibility that the\nstructure of well-being in ambulance personnel may be\nsimilarly multi-dimensionality and hierarchical, but not\ncompletely identical.\nWhile there are no prior studies modeling well-being in\nambulance personnel, a study by Rothmann (2002) has\nsuggested a model of well-being for the police force, an\nequally challenging vocation with its own inherent stress-\nors (Johnson et\nwith four distinct but related factors (satisfaction, occupa-\ntional stress, burnout, and engagement) loading onto a sin-\ngle higher order factor of well-being. Given the similar\nnatures of these professions, it is possible that Rothmann's\nmodel of well-being in the police force may be a better fit\nHypothesis 1. Work-related well-being in ambulance\npersonnel is best modeled by a hierarchical model with\nthree related but distinct first-order factors loading onto\na single second-order factor of well-being (shown in\nFigure 1).\nWork engagement\nThe concept of work engagement has emerged from\nresearch showing that certain employees find pleasure in\nwork despite strenuous job demands and stressors (Bakker\ntheoretical construct of work engagement, a fulfilling and\npositive work mindset. Work engagement is not momen-\ntary, but is a persistent and continuous affective and cogni-\ntive state, comprising the three dimensions: absorption\n(i.e. being focused and engrossed in work), dedication (i.e.\nbeing pride and enjoying work), and vigor (i.e. being ener-\ngetic and resilience).\nJob satisfaction\nJob satisfaction has been described (McShane, 2004) as an\nindividual's evaluation of his or her job and work context, and\nas an overall feeling toward a job and its facets (Spector,\n1997). As a construct, it has been operationalized both glob-\nally and multi-dimensionally, with the number of proposed\nFigure 1. Hypothesized model of work-related well-being.\nSoh et al. 3\ndimensions ranging from 5 to 20 depending on the measure\n(Fields, 2002). Common examples of job satisfaction dimen-\nsions include satisfaction with coworkers, promotion, and\npay. The literature on job satisfaction suggests that it may be\npositively related to job performance (Carr etal., 2003; Judge\netal., 2001) and organizational performance (Schneider etal.,\n2003). As job satisfaction reflects employee attitudes to their\noccupation, and has considerable criterion-related validity,\nthe measure has a history of being used to operationalize\nOccupational stress\nDifferent models of occupational stress have been devel-\noped over the years such as the person\u00adenvironment fit\nmodel (French etal., 1982) and the demand\u00adcontrol model\n(Fox etal., 1993). The person\u00adenvironment fit model sug-\ngests that physical and psychological stress results from an\ninappropriate person\u00adenvironment fit, while the demand\u00ad\ncontrol model explores the relationship between situational\ndemands and the freedom of the individual in meeting the\njob requirements. While both models have contributed and\ninfluenced the direction of job stress research, they focus\nmore on environment factors and individual capability,\nrather than specific stressors, and the contribution of\nindividual differences in personality, coping strategies,\nand resources (Spielberger and Vagg, 1994). Research on\noccupational stress in emergency service personnel has\nfound that ambulance workers report facing more acute\nand chronic work stress compared to controls (Young and\nPerceived organizational support\nOrganizational support theory proposes that employees\nform general beliefs regarding how much the organization\nvalues their contribution, and is it concerned about their\nwell-being (Eisenberger etal., 1986). POS has been shown\nto positively correlate to employee concern for organiza-\ntional welfare and commitment to achieving organizational\ngoals. POS was also an indirect contributor to affective\ncommitment and performance (Eisenberger etal., 2001).\nWhile the relationship between well-being and POS has\nnot been studied specifically in ambulance personnel,\nresearch by Cicognani etal. (2009) has found that a sense\nof community is significantly correlated to compassion sat-\nisfaction and well-being in ambulance personnel. A study\nby Beaton etal. (1997) also found that paramedics with\ngreater perceived social and network support from cowork-\ners had higher levels of job satisfaction and morale and\nlower appraised occupational stress:\nHypothesis 2. POS will be a significant, positive predic-\ntor of work well-being in ambulance personnel.\nPersonality\nVarious studies have shown personality to be a consistent\nand significant predictor of well-being (Diener et\nal.,\n1999). Research in this area generally suggests emotional\nstability and extraversion as significant predictors of sat-\nisfaction and well-being (Schimmack et\nmeta-analysis by Steel etal. (2008) found low emotional\nstability to be the strongest predictor of well-being, par-\nticularly of negative measures, followed by extraversion\nwhich strongly predicted positive measures in particular.\nHowever, studies disagree on how much variance in well-\nbeing personality factors account for. DeNeve and\nCooper's (1998) meta-analysis, for example, found emo-\ntional stability and extraversion to be statistically signifi-\ncant predictors, but reports less than half the amount of\nvariance accounted for.\nWith regards to the ambulance personnel specifically,\nfew studies have examined the relationship between per-\nsonality and well-being. One such study by Young and\nCooper (1997) found that \"type A\" personality, character-\nized by hostility, aggression, and a need for accomplish-\nment (Friedman and Rosenman, 1974), was a predictor of\nmental health symptoms after 6months. Another study by\nBrough (2005) also examined emotional stability and found\nthat low emotional stability was a strong, negative indictor\nof work well-being in a sample of ambulance workers from\nNew Zealand. This is supported by the inclusion of emo-\ntional stability in various evaluations of psychological\nHypothesis 3. Emotional stability will be a significant\npositive predictor of well-being in ambulance service\nstaff.\nHypothesis 4. Extraversion will be a significant positive\npredictor of well-being in ambulance service staff.\nIn the present experiment, a sample of ambulance per-\nsonnel in the United Kingdom was used to investigate the\nabove-mentioned hypotheses on emergency service staff\nwell-being. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was then\nused to explore the factor structure of well-being.\nMethod\nParticipants\nfemales) within the United Kingdom participated in the\nstudy. Participants ranged in age from 20 to 67\nyears,\nwith a mean age of 41.49 (standard deviation\n(SD)\n=\nyears. The majority of the sample was\nWhite British (94.3%). A list with the detailed demo-\ngraphics is available upon request.\n4 Health Psychology Open \nMeasures\nPerceived organizational support.Perceptions of organiza-\ntional support were measured using a short form of Eisen-\nberger and colleague's survey of perceived organizational\nsupport (SPOS; Eisenberger etal., 1986). The 5 highest\nloading items from the original 36 were chosen for the pre-\nsent experiment. The use of shorter forms of the scale that\ninclude both facets of POS (caring for employee well-being\nand valuing employee contribution) has been validated and\nproved reliable due to the original scale being unidimen-\nsional in nature and having a high internal reliability\n(Rhoades and Eisenberger, 2002). The items use a 7-point\nLikert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly\nagree. A meta-analysis of studies measuring POS found\nthat the scale had a high average internal reliability of\nStress.Psychological symptoms of stress were measured\nusing a 3-item scale developed by Patchen (perceived\nsupervisor support (PSS); 1970). Participants responded\nusing a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (less than once\na month) to 5 (two or three times a week). Patchen's 3-item\nscale has been reported to have an internal consistency of\nWork engagement.The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale\n(UWES; Schaufeli etal., 2002) was used as a measure of\nwork engagement. The three subscales of the UWES--\nvigor, dedication, and absorption--were used in the study.\nAll items were scored on a 7-point Likert scale from\nstrongly disagree to strongly agree. A previous study has\nfound Cronbach's  for the three subscales to fall range\nJob satisfaction. Job satisfaction was measured using a facet\napproach, with nine single-item scales each measuring satis-\nfaction toward a specific job aspect: physical environment,\nindependence, work hours, pay, promotion opportunities,\njob security, attention from management, supervisors, and\ncoworkers. Participants responded using a 7-point Likert\nscale that ranged from very dissatisfied to very satisfied.\nPersonality. The single-item measure of personality (SIMP;\nWoods and Hampson, 2005), a short measure of the five-\nfactor model (McCrae and Costa, 1999) was used to meas-\nure personality. The inventory uses single-item scales, each\ncorresponding to one personality factor. The SIMP was\nreported by its authors to have acceptable levels of diver-\ngent and convergent validity, reliability, and self-other\naccuracy. The measure starts with the stem \"Generally, I\ncome across as\": followed by five bipolar response scales,\neach with a description of the factor extremes on either side\nof the scale (e.g. \"Someone who is sensitive and excitable,\nand can be tense\" versus \"Someone who is relaxed,\nunemotional, rarely gets irritated, and seldom feels blue\").\nThe measure has been shown to have a convergence rang-\ning from r\n=\n.61), with longer five-factor\npersonality scales.\nDesign and data collection\nThe present experiment used a cross-sectional, quantitative\nsurvey design. Data collection for this study was carried out\nby Zeal Solutions using an online survey platform as part of\na regular assessment of employee well-being within the UK\nambulance service.\nModel fit indices\nDue to a lack of consensus in the field, multiple goodness-\nof-fit indices were used. First, a 2 goodness-of-fit statistic\nevaluating the degrees of freedom and statistical signifi-\ncance was used. As the 2 statistic is sensitive to large sam-\nple sizes, other goodness-of-fit indices were used such as\nthe root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA;\nindicates total amount of error in fit proportional to com-\nplexity), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI; compares global\nfit of the independent and hypothesized model, with sample\nsize accounted for), the Tucker\u00adLewis Index (TLI; Tucker\nand Lewis, 1973; measures relative covariation accounted\nfor), and the Normed-Fit Index (NFI; measures global\nmodel fit by comparing hypothesized model with a com-\npletely independent model). The recommended values for\nmodel fit on the RMSEA are less than .06 for a good fit (Hu\nand greater than .08 for a mediocre fit (MacCallum etal.,\nindicate an acceptable fit, while values larger than .95 sug-\nResults\nDescriptive statistics and correlational analysis\nMeans, SDs, and  correlations of each measure are dis-\nplayed in Table 1. The Cronbach's  coefficients of the\nmulti-item scales were all greater than .70, demonstrating\nmeasure reliability. Pearson correlations between the meas-\nured variables were calculated to examine the relationship\nbetween the different individual factors and dimensions of\nwell-being.\nThe three engagement factors correlated significantly to\nPSS, job satisfaction, POS, extraversion, agreeableness,\nand emotional stability. There was also a significant corre-\nlation between PSS and job satisfaction. The personality\nfactors of extraversion and emotional stability correlated\nsignificantly to PSS, while agreeableness and emotional\nstability were correlated to both POS and job satisfaction.\nFinally, POS also correlated with PSS and job satisfaction.\nSoh et al. 5\nFactor structure of work engagement measured\nby the UWES\nA confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to validate\nthe theoretical three-dimensional model of engagement in\nthe present sample and the appropriateness of using com-\nposite scores for each factor. The overall fit of the resulting\nthree-dimensional model is shown in Table 2. As seen from\nTable 2, while a three-factor model was a better fit than\nan alternative one-factor model, it was not an ideal fit\nbefore covariance was allowed. However, once errors were\nallowed to covary, there was a significant improvement in\nfit, with the 2 decreased by approximately three times, the\nRMSEA below the 1 cut-off, and CFI, TLI, and NFI statis-\ntics well above the strict .95 cut-off.\nFactor model of well-being\nIn order to test the fit of the hypothesized model (as reported\nin the introduction), SEM was used to compare the good-\nness-of-fit of the model against two alternative models dis-\nplayed in Figure 2. The first alternative model, (labeled\n\"Model 1\"; based on Daniels, 2000) involved the various\ndimensions loading onto two higher order factors, with\npsychological stress and job satisfaction loading onto the\nnegative affect factor, and engagement on the positive\naffect factor. The second model involved a one-factor\nmodel (labeled \"Model 2\") with all the components of\nwell-being loading onto a single first-order factor. The\nmeasured variables and error terms were not depicted in the\nfigures for parsimony.\nThe findings gave us a clear idea regarding which model\nhas the best fit (Table 3). As we can see in Table 3, the\nhypothesized model had a slighter better fit than the two\nalternatives (.1\nU of increase in CFI and .2\nU in NFI).\nFurthermore, when covariance was allowed, the hypothe-\nsized model still had a slighter better fit than the two alter-\nnatives (RMSEA decreased by .1U and CFI, TLI, and NFI\nincreased by .1\nU). The hypothesized model and the path\nloadings can be seen in Figure 3.\nCausal model of well-being\nFinally, SEM was used to evaluate the relationship between\npersonality and POS as predictors of work-related well-\nbeing. The full hypothesized structural equation model\ntested is shown in Figure 4. For the sake of parsimony, the\nobserved measures as well as the error terms were not dis-\nplayed in the figure. The overall model was found to be a\nNFI=.876), with a RMSEA value smaller than .08 indicat-\ning an acceptable fit, and CFI, TLI, and NFI values\napproaching or greater than the recommended .90.\nTable 4 below displays the factor loadings and parame-\nter estimates in the model. The factor loadings from the\nSEM analysis indicated that POS and emotional stability\nwere significant direct predictors of work-related well-\nbeing. Emotional stability was also found to be a predictor\nof POS and to have a mediated effect to well-being through\nHowever, the results of the SEM analysis also indicated\nthat the structural parameters representing the paths from\nextraversion to work-related well-being and POS were not\na new model was specified, with extraversion removed\nfrom the model to make it more parsimonious.

The latest model had a slightly better fit to the\nfit than the initial model by goodness-of-fit indicators such\nas the CFI, TLI, and NFI.\nDiscussion\nThe present experiment investigated the dimensions of\nwork-related well-being (job satisfaction, engagement, and\noccupational stress) in UK ambulance staff as well as the\nindividual factors that predict ambulance staff well-being.\nThe findings supported a more holistic model of well-being\nin ambulance staff that includes various positive measures\nsuch as job satisfaction and engagement as well. The find-\nings also indicated POS and emotional stability to be the\nsignificant predictors of well-being.\nMeasuring work-related well-being\nHypothesis 1 was supported by results which indicated\nthat a hierarchical model with different dimensions of\naffective well-being loading onto a single higher order\nfactor was a good fit for data representing ambulance per-\nsonnel well-being. This supported Warr's (1990) three-\ndimensional model of affective work-related well-being\nand Rothmann's (2002) suggestion of a single higher\norder well-being factor for personnel working in stressful,\nemergency response situations.\nThis model was a better fit than Daniels' (2000) pro-\nposed model of multiple dimensions loading onto two\nhigher order factors of positive and negative affects. A pos-\nsible explanation is that Daniels' study utilized a wider\nvariety of measures that more comprehensively captured\nthe dimension space of affective well-being in the work\nFigure 2. Alternative models of work-related well-being.\nTable 2.

In particular, Daniels' study included the dimen-\nsion of angry\u00adplacid, which was not measured in the pre-\nsent experiment. As this dimension was found to\nsignificantly characterize the higher order factor of nega-\ntive affect, the lack of measures for this dimension may\naccount for why a two-factor structure was not a best fit for\nthe present data. Overall, however, the present model is\nconsistent with the literature in highlighting the multi-\ndimensional nature of well-being and suggesting the appro-\npriateness of such an approach to well-being in ambulance\npersonnel.\nIndividual difference predictors of well-being\nIn support of hypothesis 2, SEM showed that POS was a\nsignificant predictor of the higher order factor of well-being\nin ambulance personnel. This result suggests that the level\nof organizational support experienced by ambulance per-\nsonnel strongly and directly influences their level of affec-\ntive well-being.\nAlthough the relationship between POS and work-\nrelated well-being has not been directly studied, this find-\ning matches the theoretical understanding of POS,\nwell-being measures such as engagement and satisfaction.\nEmployees reporting high POS feel that the organization is\nconcerned for their well-being and appreciates the contri-\nbutions that they provide (Eisenberger etal., 1986). It is\nthus understandable that employees with this belief are\nmore likely to express greater satisfaction with their organi-\nzation. Additionally, Van der Ploeg and Kleber's (2003)\nstudy of ambulance personnel found that social support at\nwork and organizational communication were the best\nTable 3.

This highlighted\nthe particular importance of the social work environment\nand the organization in contributing to the well-being of\nambulance staff.\nSEM results also supported hypothesis 3, indicating that\nemotional stability was a modest but significant predictor\nof well-being in emergency ambulance staff. Within the\nmodel, emotional stability was found to have both a direct\nand a mediated effect through POS on both factors\nof well-being. This supports existing findings where high\nlevels of emotional stability predicted greater well-being in\nthe general population (Steel etal., 2008).\nThe literature suggests that the relationship between\nemotional stability and well-being occurs because high\nemotional stability results in a lower negativity bias\n(Watson et\nal., 1987). A decreased propensity toward\nnegative cognitions and schemas may then influence well-\nbeing by increasing thoughts of satisfaction and engage-\nment with work. Emotional stability has also been\nproposed as an affective disposition determining the expe-\nrience of positive or negative affect, with emotionally sta-\nble individuals more positive and pleasant affective\nwell-being (Diener and Lucas, 1999). It is possible that\nthe mediated relationship between emotional stability and\nPOS is largely similar to the direct relationship between\nemotional stability and well-being as well. The same dis-\nposition toward negative affect and cognitions is likely to\ninfluence how much organizational support an individual\nTable 4.

Hypothesized structural model of the relationship between personality, POS, and work-related well-being.\nSoh et al. 9\nfeels they receive, and the attributions they make toward\nthe organization.\nThe results of the SEM analysis did not support hypoth-\nesis 4, as extraversion was not a significant predictor of\nwell-being in ambulance staff, and thus they were removed\nfrom the overall regression model. This contradicted previ-\nof extraversion as a significant predictor of well-being in\nthe general population. This difference may be due to the\nuse of SIMP. While this measure has an established validity\nand reliability, it may not adequately encompass the dimen-\nsion space of trait extraversion and may also lack statistical\npower. It is also possible that extraversion may not be a\nrelevant predictor of well-being in ambulance staff specifi-\ncally. Given the unique nature of the vocation (Carriere and\nBourque, 2009), it is possible that compared to the general\npopulation, a different set of traits may be essential in pre-\ndicting ambulance personnel well-being.\nLimitations and future research\nOne limitation of the present experiment was the necessary\nuse of a cross-sectional design due to limited resources and\ntime frame. While the use of advanced statistical models\nsuch as SEM allows causal relationships to be tested even\nwith a cross-sectional design, carefully controlled longitudi-\nnal designs are ultimately preferred to establish causality.\nAnother limitation was the sample and item size. While\nthe current sample size was sufficiently large for such anal-\nyses, it was smaller than previous studies with samples\nder Colff and Rothmann, 2009). The present sample may\nthus be insufficient to extract more complicated factor solu-\ntions (MacCallum etal., 1999). Additionally, the present\nexperiment utilized abbreviated measures with a smaller\nnumber of items compared to the longer forms used by pre-\nvious studies. While these abbreviated forms have consid-\nerable construct reliability and validity, the smaller number\nof items to extract may have resulted in less stable and\ncoherent latent factors compared to longer measures\nFinally, the variety of measures and lack of appropriate\nprevious samples prevent comparison of the levels of posi-\ntive well-being of ambulance personnel against other occu-\npations. Future studies may thus consider using similar\ncross-occupational samples, such as in Brough (2005) and\nJohnson et\nal. (2005), to compare the levels of positive\nwell-being in ambulance staff against other occupations.\nFurther research into individual predictors of ambulance\npersonnel well-being such as personality or demographic\nfactors should also be encouraged due to the limited num-\nber of existing studies (Sterud etal., 2006).\nImplications\nThe findings of this study have significant theoretical\nimplications for how the well-being of ambulance service\nstaff should be evaluated. The current literature has taken\nan approach targeted predominantly at treating negative\nsymptoms of physical illness and PTSD (James and Wright,\nthat a holistic approach that includes positive and affective\nFigure 5. Post-hoc model of the relationship between personality, POS, and work-related well-being.\n10 Health Psychology Open \naspects is equally applicable and relevant to understanding\nthe well-being of ambulance personnel as well. Future\nresearch should thus consider a broader approach to evalu-\nating well-being, more similar to that taken in general fields\nof organizational psychology. Additionally, this study high-\nlights a need for greater focus on individual difference pre-\ndictors such as personality or demographics.\nThe results from this experiment also have significant\npractical implications for managing well-being in ambu-\nlance personnel. First, they suggest that ambulance services\nshould ensure that they evaluate not just the negative aspects\nof staff well-being, but include positive measures such as\nengagement and job satisfaction as well. Additionally, they\nindicate that organizations should attend to important indi-\nvidual and organizational predictors of well-being. For\nexample, the finding of POS as a predictor presents a feasi-\nble area for organizational interventions to improve the\nwell-being of ambulance staff. Managers in this field should\nthus consider actions that may be taken to increase the levels\nof POS and demonstrate that the organization values the\ncontribution and welfare of their ambulance service staff.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nBakker AB, Hakanen JJ, Demerouti E, etal.
