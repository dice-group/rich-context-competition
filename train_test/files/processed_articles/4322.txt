McCue, DBA1\n Keywords\nMedicaid Expansion, ACA, health insurers, financial performance, utilization\nOriginal Research\nIntroduction\nIn January 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded\nMedicaid coverage for adults up to the age of 65 with\nincomes under 138% of the federal poverty level. (A major\nlimitation of this study is that the membership increase in\nMedicaid may also stem from the \"out of wood work effect,\"\nwhereby individuals who were previously eligible for Medi-\nCal, but were not enrolled, were found to be eligible when\nsigning up for health care insurance under the ACA. One\nanalysis estimates that at least 5% of California Medi-Cal\nmembers were previously eligible [see Gorn D, \"Medi-Cal\nEnrollment Jumps to 11.3 Million,\" CaliforniaHealthline.\nCalifornia's Medicaid program called the \"Medi-Cal\" pro-\ngram has the largest Medicaid enrollment1 in the United\nStates.2 (Total Medi-Cal enrollment grew to 11.9 million\nmembers at the beginning of 2014.) To assess the impact of\nMedicaid Expansion, this study measures the enrollment,\nutilization, and financial measures of Medicaid focused\nhealth insurers during the quarterly time periods of 2014.3,4\nStudy Data and Methods\nThe study initially identified 27 full-service health insurers\nwith Medi-Cal members in 2014. (The study excluded one\nspecialty full-service insurer that was focused on aids treat-\nment and one insurer with a senior care focus.) To assess the\ndirect impact of the Medi-Cal expansion on utilization and\nfinancial measures,5 the study identified 17 insurers with\n70% of their enrollment in the Medi-Cal program. Enrollment\nand utilization data of these insurers were collected from the\nfinancial statement database of the California's Department\nhealth insurer did not report inpatient days per thousand and\nambulatory encounter data. Therefore, the utilization analy-\nfocused plans reported encounter data and one Medi-Cal\nhealth insurer's Medicaid enrollment was below 70% in\n2012.) The study design was an \"interrupted time series\ndesign,\" whereby the quarterly financial performance and\nutilization measures during the expansion period of 2014\nwere compared with the same quarterly measures in the prior\npoints is defined as quarter over quarter basis. The major\nweaknesses of this design is the lack of a comparison group\nof health insurers that did not experience Medicaid Expansion\nin the state of California during these periods, which would\nenable the design to control for other extraneous events that\noccurred during these time periods. Given this design, the\nstudy compared over time each respective quarterly period of\nThe strength of this design is that each Medicaid focused\nhealth insurer is able to act as its own control for seasonal\neffects that may occur from enrolling and dis-enrolling\nmembers as well as managing their care.)\n1Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMichael J.

Box 980203,\nEmail: mccue@vcu.edu\nEnrollment and Utilization Results\nMedicaid focused insurers increased their total Medi-Cal\nmembers, from 5.2 million members for the last quarter of\n2013 (see Table 1). In addition to enrollment gains, Medi-Cal\nmembers'utilization patterns changed in response to Medicaid\nExpansion. The first and fourth quarters' ambulatory care\nencounters per member per month (PMPM) were reduced by\nTable 1). Non-physician to physician ambulatory encounters\nfor last three quarters of 2012 were significantly higher than\nto 2013 findings, non-physician versus physician ambulatory\nencounters for 2014 trended downward to an almost identical\n(Quarter 4). Finally, starting in the second quarter for 2012\nand 2013, inpatient days per thousand trended upward, while\nin 2014, inpatient days per thousand increased in the third\nquarter and declined slightly in the fourth quarter. However,\nstarting in the second quarter of 2014, inpatient days were\nsubstantially lower than their respective prior quarters of\nFinancial Performance Results\nThe medical loss ratio for the Medicaid focused insurers\ntrended downward (see Table 2) each quarter in 2014 and\nwas 330 basis points lower than medical loss ratio for the\n2013 fourth quarter. (Data were collected from the\nDepartment of Managed Health Care Financial Summary\ndataset on a quarterly basis. For the denominator of each\nmeasure, the study used total revenues and not premium\nrevenues as this date element is not available on the sum-\nmary quarterly data. As a result, the medical loss ratio and\nadministrative cost ratio values may be lower than medical\nloss and administrative cost ratios based on premium rev-\nenues as total revenues include not only premium revenues\nbut also other revenues such as interest income and sales\ntax revenues and grants. Profit margin was computed by\nsumming medical and administrative expenses and sub-\ntracting this summary value from total revenues. The profit\nmargin ratio was profit margin divided by total revenues.\nMedian values for each performance ratio do not sum\nacross the three financial performance ratios.) Quarterly\nfrom 91% in the first quarter to 89.9% in the last quarter,\nwhereas 2012 quarterly medical loss ratios remained\naround 92% for three out of four quarters. Quarterly\nadministrative cost ratios decreased over the four quarters\nthree out of four quarters in 2013. Quarterly administrative\ndifferent for each quarter. Quarterly profit margin ratios\ngin ratios for 2012 were less than or equal to 1% for each\nreporting period whereas quarterly profit margins for 2013\nConclusion\nFrom the first quarter to the last quarter of 2014, Medi-Cal\nmembership increased by almost 1.7 million members for\nTable 1.

Qtr = quarter; PMPM = per member per month; Encount = encounter.\n**Not median values but Total enrollment for sample.\nMedicaid focused insurers.To control their medical expenses,\nMedicaid focused insurers appear either to enroll members\nwho required less care due to their health status or were more\neffective in managing the care of these new members. This\noutcome supports preliminary studies that expected these\nnewly enrolled Medicaid members, specifically childless\nadults, under ACA to use less inpatient care over time,8,9 The\nutilization measures support these findings as well, specifi-\ncally with respect to inpatient days per thousand in the last\nquarter, which was 56 days lower than prior year's last quar-\nter. Except for the first and last quarters of 2014, ambulatory\nencounters by members appear to be similar to prior years,\nwhich suggests that these insurers continue to manage their\ncare on an outpatient basis.\nIncreased membership may have contributed to achieving\nthe effects of economics of scale due to fixed administrative\ncosts, especially in terms of compensation. As a result of the\ndeclines in the medical loss ratio and administrative cost\nratio, the Medicaid focused insurers were able to generate\nsubstantially higher profits that grew from 3.55% in the first\nstudy has several major limitations, specifically related to the\nsmaller sample size, lack of comparison group, and the gen-\neralizability of findings to only one state. Future studies\nshould expand this analysis on a national basis to assess the\nutilization and financial impact of Medicaid health insurers\nin the 30 states that expanded the Medicaid program com-\npared with remaining states that did not.\nTable 2.
