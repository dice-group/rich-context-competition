    "abstract": "Abstract The association between educational attainment and self-assessed health is well\nestablished but the mechanisms that explain this association are not fully understood yet. It is\nlikely that part of the association is spurious because (genetic and non-genetic) characteristics\nof a person's family of origin simultaneously affect one's educational attainment and one's\nadult health. In order to obtain an unbiased estimate of the association between education and\nhealth, we have to control for all relevant family factors. In practice, however, it is impossible\nto measure all relevant family factors. Sibling models are particularly appropriate in this case,\nbecause they control for the total impact of family factors, even if not all relevant aspects can\nbe measured. I use data on siblings from a US study (MIDUS) and Dutch study (NKPS) to\nassess thetotal family impact on self-assessed health and,more importantly, toassess whether\nthere is a family bias in the association between educational attainment and self-assessed\nhealth. The results suggest that there is a substantial family effect; about 20% of the variation\nin self-assessed health between siblings can be ascribed to (measured and unmeasured)\nfamily factors. Measured family factors, such as parental education and father's occupation,\ncould account only for a small part of the family effect. Furthermore, the results imply that it is\nunlikely that there is substantial bias due to family effects in the association between edu-\ncation and self-assessed health. This strengthens the conclusions from prior studies on the\nassociation between education and self-assessed health.\n",

This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com\n Keywords Education \u00c1 Self-assessed health \u00c1 Siblings \u00c1 Sibling models \u00c1\nFamily\n1 Introduction\nOne of the most persistent findings with regard to questions about social inequality and life\nchances is the educational gradient in health and mortality (Antonovsky 1967; Huisman\nC. W. S. Monden (&)\nDepartment of Sociology, Tilburg University,\ne-mail: c.w.s.monden@uvt.nl\nreport better health and have longer life expectancies than lower educated people. The\neducational gradient in health has been documented for a variety of societies and time\nperiods (Von dem Knesebeck et al. 2006). These health differences are not only observed\nbetween the highest and lowest educated groups, but health differences are found between\nall consecutive steps on the educational ladder (Erikson 2001).\nDespite the large number of studies on health inequalities, many fundamental questions\nremain concerning the nature and causes of the association between education and health\nquestions concerns the role of the family of origin. On the one hand, there is a strand of\nliterature that studies the association between the socio-economic position of the family of\norigin and adult health (Ben-Shlomo and Kuh 2002; Graham 2002; Van de Mheen et al.\n1997). Studies in this literature suggest that the socio-economic position of the family of\norigin is important for adult health. We know, on the other hand, from sociological studies,\nthat the family of origin also plays an important role in determining an individual's\neducational attainment. In this paper, these two lines of research are brought together by\nstudying the total family impact on self-assessed health and, more importantly, by\nassessing to what extent the association between education and health is biased by mea-\nsured and unmeasured family factors that affect both education and health. In doing so, two\nimportant issues are addressed that have received little attention in the literature so far.\nFirst, only a few characteristics of the family of origin have been included in studies on\nadult health. Typically information on father's socio-economic position during the\nrespondent's childhood was available (Hertzman et al. 2001; Power et al. 1998; Van de\nMheen et al. 1997). Although this is an important characteristic of the family of origin,\nmany other family factors might be important as well, such as, for example, genes, life-\nstyle, or the family's social network. Thus, the total effect of the family of origin on adult\nhealth might be much stronger than suggested by studies that can only incorporate father's\nsocial class. This lack of measured family factors raises two questions: How large is the\ntotal family impact on self-assessed health? (Or, in other words, to what extent do family\nfactors explain differences in adult self-assessed health?) And: How well do measured\ncharacteristics of the family of origin cover the total effect of the family of origin on adult\nhealth?\nThe second issue that has received little attention so far, is the question to what extent\nthe association between education and self-assessed health is biased if not all family factors\nare taken into account. A serious bias could exist if some of the family factors that\ndetermine adult health are also important for educational attainment. Part of the association\nbetween education and health could actually be the result of growing up in a particular\nfamily rather than a true effect of education on health.\nPrior studies primarily aimed at quantifying the additional importance of childhood\ncircumstances for adult self-assessed health (after controlling for the current situation).\nThey did not address the question whether education and health have important family\nfactors in common. For example, we know that parental social class strongly affects\nchildren's education attainment (Hout and Diprete 2006; Shavit and Blossfeld 1993) as\nwell as their health status in adulthood (Power et al. 1998). As a result, not taking into\naccount parental social class would overestimate the association between education and\nhealth. A bias could also result from family factors that are not measured in the sample. To\nadvance our understanding of educational differences in health, it is important to know the\nextent to which the association between education and health reflects the `unbiased effect'\nof schooling. This is especially important for explanatory studies, such as Lynch (2001),\nStronks et al. (1996) and Van Lenthe et al. (2002) that can not take all family factors into\naccount.\nOne of the reasons that the above mentioned questions have received little attention is\nthat the majority of studies analyses samples of unrelated individuals. Samples with such a\ndesign can not be used to answer questions about total family effects adequately. Instead,\nsamples are needed that contain multiple persons per family (i.e., siblings or twins). If we\nobserve two or more siblings per family, we can draw conclusions about the total family\neffect by studying the shared variation among the siblings' outcomes. Sibling analysis\nmakes it possible to assess how much of the variation in health and education is linked to\nfamily factors and to estimate the relative importance of measured and unmeasured family\nfactors. The difference between sibling data and twin data is that the latter, given a number\nof assumptions, allows splitting the total family effect into genetic and non-genetic family\ncomponents. Sibling studies have been used in various fields, for instance to assess the total\nfamily effect and `unbiased effects' of schooling for outcomes such as income (Griliches\n1979), occupational status (Hauser and Mossel 1985), cultural consumption (Van Eijck\n1996), social stratification and social orientations (Sieben 2001). So far, there has been\nlittle investigation of the total family effect for self-assessed health (but see the twin\nstudies discussed below). The current study focuses on self-assessed health, which is the\nmost frequently used health indicator in social sciences (Ferraro and Farmer 1999).\nTo sum up, I address the following questions: (1) How large is the total family effect on\nself-assessed health? (2) To what extent do measured aspects of the family's socio-eco-\nnomic status account for this total family effect? and (3) To what extent is the association\nbetween education and self-assessed health biased by measured and unmeasured family\nfactors?\n2 Theory and Prior Research\nAs the research questions of this study are explorative it does not seem informative to\nformulate precise hypotheses (e.g., a hypothesis on the exact size of the family effect on\nself-assessed health). However, building on insights from sociology and social epidemi-\nology and prior research, I will formulate a general hypothesis for each of the three\nresearch questions.\nRegarding the first research question, there is ample reason to assume that there is a\nsubstantial family effect on adult self-assessed health. One's health status at a particular\nmoment in time is not simply the result of current circumstances and behaviour, but rather\nthe result of exposure to various circumstances and behaviour over the life course (Lynch\nearly in life are shaped by the family of origin. Furthermore, there is probably a genetic\nimpact of the family. Thus, we can distinguish three mechanisms to explain how family\nfactors influence adult self-assessed health: genetic, material and cultural factors. Below\neach one is discussed briefly.\nFirst, an obviously shared family factor is genetic endowment. If self-assessed health\nhas important genetic determinants, then we would expect siblings to show considerable\nsimilarities in health. Twin studies, however, have yielded mixed evidence about the\ngenetic family component of self-assessed health. Two American studies on male twins\n(Christensen et al. 1999) and one Norwegian study (Roysamb et al. 2003) have estimated\nDo Measured and Unmeasured Family Factors Bias 323\nto what extent the resemblance in self-assessed health between twins can be attributed to\nfamily factors (genetic factors and the shared environment) on the one hand and individual\nfactors (non-shared environment) on the other. The importance of the family factors in\nthese studies varies strongly by country, sex and age. The percentage of variance that can\nbe explained by the genetic family factor ranges from 15% to well over 50% in the\ndifferent samples. In one subsample no genetic component was found (Harris et al. 1992).\nSome studies find that non-genetic family factors are associated with self-assessed health,\nwhereas others conclude that only the genetic family factor is important (Romeis et al.\n2000, 2005). Overall, these studies support the idea that family factors partly determine\nself-assessed health, although it remains an open question to what extent this family effect\ncan be attributed to genetic factors, material family factors or cultural family factors.\nThe second family factor concerns material circumstances. Several authors have argued\nthat growing up in materially less advantageous circumstances can have lasting negative\n1998; Van de Mheen et al. 1997). Crowded and poor housing, poor nutrition, low access to\n(preventive) health care as well as financial stress could have long-lasting effects on health.\nThese adverse material circumstances are strongly related to low socio-economic status.\nLongitudinal and cross-sectional studies have shown significant associations between adult\nhealth and childhood material circumstances as measured by father's socio-economic\nstatus.\nThird, the family of origin may shape lifestyles and attitudes that are relevant for health.\nImportant health related behaviours such as smoking, dietary habits and exercise are, in\npart, influenced by family culture in childhood and adolescence. Also, attitudes and beliefs\nabout health and health care may be influence by the family of origin. In sum, the above-\nmentioned genetic, material and cultural factors related to the family of origin would lead\nus the expect a low to moderate correlation between the health statuses of adult siblings.\nNext I turn to the second research question. If we find significant resemblance in self-\nassessed health and education among siblings, can `standard measures' of family factors,\nsuch as father's socio-economic position, explain the whole family effect? In the literature,\nparental social class and parental education are the most frequently used family indicators\n(Ben-Shlomo and Kuh 2002; Power et al. 1998). In addition also indicators of financial\nhardship during childhood are sometimes used (Lundberg 1993). These family factors are\nalso available in the data used for the current study. But apart from the measured family\nfactors, many potentially important family factors remain unmeasured or are only partly\npicked up by the measures of social class. Relevant aspects of the family concerning\nhousing, the neighbourhood, culture and lifestyles remain unobserved and are not (fully)\ncaptured by the standard socio-economic indicators. Again, it is impossible to formulate a\nhypothesis about exactly what proportion of the total family effect is captured by the\nmeasured factors. Therefore the following more explorative hypothesis is formulated:\nmeasured socio-economic family characteristics explain a substantial part of the total\nfamily effect on self-assessed health.\nThe final question is whether there is substantial overlap between family factors that\ndetermine adult health, on the one hand, and family factors that influence educational\nattainment on the other hand. If there is such overlap the association between education\nand health would be partly spurious. In other words, the association is biased by family\nfactors in studies that do not or can not take all possible family factors into account. It\nseems reasonable to expect at least some overlap in the relevant family factors. The\nfamily's socio-economic position is likely to affect both outcomes, albeit possibly through\ndifferent mechanisms. The health effects of the family's position may be more related to\nthe material circumstances whereas the effect on educational outcomes may be more\nrelated to cultural factors and ambition. Sociological research has shown a persistent\nassociation between parental educational level and father's occupation on children's\nthese factors are also related to adult health.\nThere might also be genetic factors that affect education and health simultaneously.\nThere is empirical evidence suggesting that some genetic factors that are related to self-\nassessed health are also related to education (Lichtenstein et al. 1993). Lichtenstein et al.\n(1993) found a correlation of r = 0.21 between the genetic family factor for self-assessed\nhealth and that for education. They also found a correlation of r = 0.26 between the factor\nfor shared family environment (i.e., non-genetic family aspects) related to self-assessed\nhealth and that related to education. This suggests that another part of the association\nbetween education and health is caused by common non-genetic family factors. Although\nthese correlations are not high, they do suggest that the effect of education on health is\npartly spurious. Therefore, I will test the hypothesis that the association between education\nand self-assessed health is upwardly biased if not controlled for measured and unmeasured\nfamily factors.\nTo sum, the expectation is that there indeed is a family effect on self-assessed health,\nwhich is partly explained by parental education and occupation, and that the pure effect of\neducation on health will be smaller, but still significant, after taking all possible family\nfactors into account.\nThere are only few data sets that include relevant information on education, health and\nfamily background for adult siblings. I use an American and Dutch data set.\nThe US data come from the MacArthur Foundation Midlife Development in the United\nStates survey (MIDUS) (Brim et al. 2004). This is a national telephone and mail survey\ncarried out in 1995\u00ad1996 under the auspices of the John and Catherine T. MacArthur\nFoundation Network on Successful Midlife Development (ICPSR 2760). A sample ranging\nin age from 25 to 74 years, was recruited from a random-digit-dial sampling frame of the\ncoterminous United States and oversampling in five metropolitan areas. One respondent\nwas selected from each eligible household. The survey was carried out in two phases: a\ntelephone interview followed by a self-administered mail questionnaire. The phase 1\nresponse rate was 70%, and the conditional phase 2 response rate was 87%, with an overall\nresponse rate of 61%. There are 4,242 cases (primary respondents) in the main sample.\nNon-twin siblings were enrolled by sending a postcard to all respondents, asking them\nto provide contact information for their siblings. Since the family study was a secondary\naim of the project, no elaborate non-response procedures were employed. While the\nnumber of eligible respondents who provided the names and addresses of their siblings was\nlow (20%), the cooperation rate for the sibling sample was high (69%). In total 951 siblings\nwere interviewed. The number of siblings from a single family ranged from one to six,\nincluding one sibling from 272 families, two from 146 families, three from 75 families,\nfour from 22 families, five from 10 families, and six from four families. I constructed all\npossible sibling-pairs and applied a family weight to give each family equal influence in\nDo Measured and Unmeasured Family Factors Bias 325\nthe analysis. Apparently sisters were more willing to give each other's addresses. This is in\nline with the finding that sister-sister relationships are stronger than brother-brother or\nmixed-sex sibling relationships (Lee et al. 1990). As a result there is an overrepresentation\nof females in the MIDUS sample.\nMIDUS includes a standard single-item question about general health: ``in general,\nwould you say your physical health is... (1) excellent, (2) very good, (3) good, (4) fair or\n(5) poor?'' Self-assessed health has repeatedly been shown to be a good indicator of\ngeneral health (Ferraro and Farmer 1999; McHorney 2000). In a longitudinal population-\nbased study Mossey and Shapiro (1982) showed that self-assessed health predicts mortality\nindependently of age, sex, ``objective health status'', life satisfaction, income and resi-\ndence. Moreover, the association of self-assessed health with mortality was stronger than\nthe association between objective health status and mortality. Many other authors have\nreported similar results for a variety of populations, countries and age-groups (Benyamini\nInformation provided by the primary respondent and siblings on their own educational\nattainment is used. Education is coded in years of completed education. The primary\nrespondent also reported the educational attainment of both parents and the father's\noccupation at the time when the respondent was an adolescent (``Tell me about the job he\nhad for the longest time during your adolescence--when you were 12\u00ad18 years old'').\nFather's occupation is converted to manual or non-manual. I use mother's education and\nfather's occupation. Finally, I use the answer to a question about the family's financial\nsituation: ``When you were growing up, was your family better off or worse off financially\nthan the average family was at that time? (1) A lot better off to (7) A lot worse off''.\nThe data I use for the Netherlands come from a large-scale study of family relations: the\nNetherlands' Kinship Panel Study (Dykstra et al. 2005). The NKPS is a nationally rep-\nresentative survey among 8,155 primary respondents aged 18\u00ad79. Residents of care-\ninstitutions, penitentiaries, homes for the elderly, and holiday homes were excluded from\nthe sample frame. The data were gathered in 2002\u00ad2004. Interviews were held with\nrespondents at home using CAPI face-to-face interviews and self-administered question-\nnaires. The overall response rate was 45%, which is low compared to the US but about\naverage for the Netherlands.\nFor each primary respondent who had living brothers or sisters, one sibling was ran-\ndomly selected to be interviewed as well. The primary respondents were asked to provide\nthe address and grant permission to contact the sibling. This permission was granted by\n60% of the respondents who had a living sibling. The response rate among the siblings was\n63%. I select siblings in the 24\u00ad75 age range to match the MIDUS sample. In total,\ninformation from 2,289 siblings is used.\nThe health question in NKPS is similar to the one in MIDUS except that the answer\ncategories differ slightly: ``(1) excellent, (2) good, (3) not bad and not good, (4) poor, or (5)\nvery poor''.\nThe primary respondent and sibling report their highest obtained diploma. This infor-\nmation is converted to total years of education. Additionally, the primary respondent was\nasked to report father's and mother's education and father's occupation when the\nrespondent was about 15 years old. The occupational title is converted to manual or non-\nmanual. NKPS also offers an indicator of parents' wealth: whether family was home owner\nor renting a house when the respondent was 15 years old. In the Netherlands, this is a good\nindicator of the family's wealth. Descriptive statistics for both samples are given in\nTo assess the total family effect, Hauser-Mossel sibling-models (Hauser and Mossel 1985;\nSieben 2001; Van Eijck 1996) are estimated. Originally, these models were designed to test\nthe effect of family background on occupational attainment, but the technique can be used\nfor any outcome.\nThe more important the family is, the higher the resemblance among brothers and sisters\nwill be. Thus, sibling resemblance can be used as an estimate for the total effect of family\nfactors (including all shared genetic, environmental, social, and cultural factors). The\nsibling model decomposes the variance in the dependent variable into a family component\n(also called `between-family') and an individual component (also called `within-family').\nThe first refers to the variance that siblings have in common, the second to individual\ndeviations from the common variance. Structural equation models make it possible to\nassess family (between-family) and individual (within-family) regression coefficients, as\ndepicted in Fig. 1. The square boxes in Fig. 1 indicate observed variables, the ovals\nindicate latent variables. The loadings of the latent variables are constrained to equal 1.\nThe individual regression coefficient represents the individual association between edu-\ncation and health, controlled for all family effects. If there is no family effect, the family\nregression coefficient and individual regression coefficient will be equal. However, if the\nfamily regression coefficient is significantly larger, in a better fitting model, than the\nindividual family regression coefficient, then this indicates a family bias in the effect of\neducation on health. By adding measured family characteristics to the model, one can\nestimate how much of the total family-effect is captured by these characteristics. This way,\nhypotheses can be tested about the nature of, at least part of, the family's influence. The\nsiblings models are estimated as structural equation models using Lisrel 8 (Jo\n\u00a8reskog and\nSo\nFive regression models are estimated. The first two models (A1 and A2) are conven-\ntional regression models in which siblings' health is regressed on age, gender, education\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics of the variables in the US sample (MIDUS) and Dutch sample (NKPS)\nUS sample Dutch sample\nMean/proportion SD Mean/proportion SD\na MIDUS range 1\u00ad7; NKPS dichotomous (0/1)\nDo Measured and Unmeasured Family Factors Bias 327\nand four measured family characteristics. Because siblings are not independent observa-\ntions, robust standard errors are used that correct for clustering within families (Rogers\n1983; Williams 2000). These models are the reference models. The coefficients for edu-\ncation can be compared to the individual regression coefficient of education in the three\nsiblings models (B1 to B3). The individual regression coefficient is set equal for both\nsiblings in these models. The first sibling model, Model B1, assumes that the individual\nand family regression coefficients of education on health are equal. This equality constraint\nis relaxed in Model B2. If Model B2 has a significantly better fit than B1, there is a family\nbias in the educational effect on self-assessed health. In Model B3, I add observed family\nfactors. How much the observed family factors contribute to the total family effect is\nindicated by the change (reduction) in the size of the family regression coefficient for\neducation between Model B2 and Model B3. It is also reflected in the increase of the\nproportion of explained variance at the family level between the two models.\n5.1 Sibling Correlations\nTable 2 shows the sibling correlations in education and self-assessed health. The results in\nthis table are in line with earlier findings on sibling resemblance in education (Hauser and\nMossel 1985; Lichtenstein et al. 1993). Four observations can be made from this table.\nFirst, sibling correlations for educational attainment are about twice as high as the sibling\ncorrelations for self-assessed health (the 95% confidence-intervals of the two correlation\ncoefficients do not overlap). This suggests that the total family impact on adult self-\nassessed health is much smaller than the family effect on educational attainment.\nFig. 1 Sibling model for the association between education and health. Square boxes indicate observed\nvariables; ovals indicate latent variables in the structural equations model. The two individual regression\ncoefficients (within-family regression) are set equal to each other\nSecond, sibling correlations tend to be higher among same-sex pairs than among mixed-\nsex pairs. This pattern holds for education as well as for self-assessed health. The corre-\nlation coefficients for education differ significantly between mixed sibling pairs and same-\nsex pairs in both samples. For health the same pattern is observed, but the correlation\ncoefficients are not significantly different at the 5% significance level. Curiously, the\nsibling correlation for self-assessed health among US male sibling pairs seems much lower\nthan the sibling correlation among female US pair and male and female Dutch sibling\npairs. Note, however, that the difference between these correlation coefficients is only\nborderline significant (at a significance level of 10%).\nThe third observation is that sibling correlation for education is higher in female pairs\nthan in male pairs. This difference is found in both samples and statistically significant in\nthe Dutch sample. This suggests that the family is more important for women's education\nthan for men's. Van Eijck (1996) showed that family background explains a larger pro-\nportion of variance in women's education compared to men in the Netherlands. However,\nthis is most likely due to the smaller variance in women's education rather than to a larger\nimpact of the family of origin (Van Eijck 1996).\nFinally, we can observe in Table 2 that, despite some difference among the subgroups\nof sibling pairs, the overall correlations in the US and the Netherlands are quite similar;\nsample, respectively. These small differences between the samples are not statistically\nsignificant.\nIn the remainder of this paper, I will analyse same-sex sibling pairs only. As mentioned\nabove, the sibling correlations are systematically lower among mixed pairs compared to\nsame-sex pairs (the differences are significant for education in both samples). The lower\nsibling correlations in mixed pairs suggests that the family is less important than the sibling\ncorrelations for male and female pairs imply. Thus, using the mixed sibling pairs raises\nimportant questions about differences between men and women in the variation in edu-\ncation and health and questions about how the family affects sons and daughters differ-\nently. As a result, mixed pairs would complicate the interpretation of the analysis. In order\nto obtain a clear picture about the impact of the family, I analyse male and female same-\nsex pairs simultaneously while taking into account age and sex. Splitting the analyses by\nsex would result in even smaller sample sizes. Working with small samples is not infor-\nmative, because it increases the chance of type I or II errors. Studies on self-assessed health\nusually find relatively small effect sizes. Therefore, splitting the analyses into several\nsubgroups would lead to imprecise estimates.\nTable 2 Age-adjusted sibling correlations of self-assessed health and education in the US sample (MIDUS)\nand Dutch sample (NKPS)\nType of sibling pair US sample Dutch sample\nN Health Education N Health Education\nDo Measured and Unmeasured Family Factors Bias 329\n5.2 Conventional Models\nTable 3 reports the outcome of conventional models (A1\u00adA2) and siblings models (B1\u00ad\nB3) regressing self-assessed health on education for the US and Dutch sample. These\nanalyses allow us to assess the total family effect on adult health and the `unbiased'\nassociation between educational attainment and self-assessed health.\nFor the US sample, the conventional models show that there is a significant association\nbetween education and self-assessed health. Respondents with more years of schooling\nreport better health than those with less education. The effect size is not particularly big. A\n10 year difference in schooling corresponds to one standard deviation difference in health.\nThe maximum educational difference is about 16 years; this difference in education cor-\nresponds to about 1.3 points on the 1\u00ad5 health scale.\nBy comparing the regression coefficients for education between Model A1 and Model\nA2, we can see whether the effect of education is overestimated in the conventional model\nif not corrected for observed family characteristics. Adding socio-economic characteristics\nof the family of origin reduces the coefficient for education by 20%, but this difference is\nnot statistically significant. Given the relatively small sample size it is not surprising that\nthe measured family factors do not reach statistical significance at the 5% level. The effects\nof mother's education and father's occupational class are both borderline significant.\nNext we turn to the sibling models. The first sibling model for the US sample constrains the\nindividual and family regression coefficients for education to be equal. As can be observed\nfrom Table 3, the regression coefficient for education in Model B1 is almost equal to that\nin Model A1. The additional information that the sibling model gives us is a decomposition\nof the variance in self-assessed health. About one-fifth of the differences in self-assessed\nhealth among the respondents can be attributed to family factors. Note that this concerns all\npossible family factors; either social, genetic, observed or unobserved. Part of this family\nvariance component is simply caused by the composition of families in terms of the\nsiblings' age, sex and educational attainment. About 13% of the family variance can be\nascribed to differences in composition. Most of the total variance consists of difference\nbetween individuals. About 9% of this remaining individual variance can be explained by\nage, sex and education.\nIn the second sibling model, the individual and family regression coefficients for\neducation are allowed to vary freely. Relaxing the constraint does not significantly improve\nthe model fit, as can been seen in the last two columns of Table 3. This suggests that,\nalthough the family coefficient for education is somewhat larger than the individual\ncoefficient, there is no substantial family bias in the association between education and\nself-assessed health.\nIn Model B3, measured family factors are included in the sibling model. Adding these\nvariables leads to a better fit compared to a model in which the effects of these variables\nare constrained to equal zero (chi-square of 81 with 32 degrees of freedom). The family\ncoefficient for education is now much smaller and an additional 12% of the family variance\nin self-assessed health can be explained, mainly by mothers education and father's class\n(due to small sample size these effects do not reach statistical significance).\nIn addition to these three sibling models, I estimated Model B3 with an equality con-\nstrain on the individual and family regression coefficients for education. All results were\nsimilar to the unconstrained model except for the educational coefficient, which became\nTable 3 Unstandardized regression coefficients (and standard errors) for same-sex sibling pairs from conventional OLS models and sibling models\nRegression coefficients Variance components Fit measures\nEducation Age Male Father's\neducation\nMother's\neducation\nFather\nmanual\nMaterial\nsituation\nFamily\nlevel\nExpl.a Individual\nlevel\nExpl.b Chi2\n(df)\nGFI\nP-value\nFamily Individual\nUS sample\nDutch sample\nDo Measured and Unmeasured Family Factors Bias 331\nTable 3 continued\nRegression coefficients Variance components Fit measures\nEducation Age Male Father's\neducation\nMother's\neducation\nFather\nmanual\nMaterial\nsituation\nFamily\nlevel\nExpl.a Individual\nlevel\nExpl.b Chi2\n(df)\nGFI\nP-value\nFamily Individual\nModel A: OLS regression with robust standard errors corrected for clustering within sibling pairs; Model B: sibling models\na Percentage of the variance at the family level that is explained by the measured family characteristics\nb Percentage of the variance at the individual level that is explained by the measured individual characteristics\n0.066 (virtually the same as in Model A1). This model has a similar fit but uses one degree\nof freedom less compared to the unconstrained model, suggesting there is hardly any\nfamily bias in the association between education and self-assessed health if standard family\nfactors are taken into account.\nThe qualitative results for the Dutch sample are quite similar to those of the US sample.\nThe educational differences in health appear to be smaller in the Netherlands, but also\namong the Dutch siblings there is a significant and positive association between self-\nassessed health and education. Again, about one-fifth (18%) of the variation in self-assessed\nhealth can be attributed to the family of origin. Education, age and sex explain less of the\ntotal variation in the Dutch sample than in the US sample. This holds true for both the family\nlevel as well as the individual level. Parental education, occupation and home ownership\naccount for a small proportion of the total family effect, namely about 6%. Comparing the\ncoefficient for education in Model A2 with the family coefficient for education in Model B3\nshows whether not taking into account the total family effect causes a bias in the effect of\neducation. The educational coefficients in all five models are very similar and do not differ\nsignificantly from one another. Thus, there is no indication that there is a family bias in the\nassociation between education and self-assessed health in the Dutch sample.\n6 Conclusions\nThe aim of this paper was (1) to estimate the total family effect on self-assessed health (2)\nto determine what proportion of the family effect is tapped by measured socio-economic\nvariables of the family of origin, and (3) to assess to what extent the association between\neducation and self-assessed health is biased if family factors are not taken into account.\nTo answer these questions, sibling data from the US and the Netherlands were used.\nOverall, the sibling models showed that there is more within-family variance than between-\nfamily variance in self-assessed health. In other words, individual differences seem to be\nmuch more important than differences between families. About 20% of the variation in\nself-assessed health is related to family factors, including all genetic, material and cultural\nfactors (both measured and unmeasured). The remaining 80% of the variation in self-\nassessed health has to be attributed to purely individual differences. The total family effect\non self-assessed health appears to be of equal magnitude in the two samples.\nStandard indicators for the family of origin, father's occupational class (manual or non-\nmanual) and parental education, appear to explain only a small part of the total family effect.\nFor the US sample one-eighth of the family variance in adult self-assessed health can be\nexplained by parental education, father's manual/non-manual class and financial well-being.\nAnother one-eighth of the family variation is due to differences in age, sex and educational\nattainment of the siblings. In the Dutch sample, only 6% of the variation at the family level\ncould be explained by measured family factors. It is important to note that in many data sets\nmore indicators of the family's socio-economic position are available and that the indicators\nused in this study can be measure in much more detail. It remains an open question whether\nusing more detailed family indicators would make a substantial difference.\nNo evidence was found for a substantial `family bias' in the association between\neducation and self-assessed health. This suggests that conventional analyses can be used to\nestimate largely `unbiased effects' of education on self-assessed health if measured indi-\ncators of the family of origin are controlled for. This strengthens the conclusions from\nprevious studies that seek to explain the association between education and self-assessed\nhealth.\nDo Measured and Unmeasured Family Factors Bias 333\nAt the same time, these results increase the need to come up with better explanations for\nthe association between education and self-assessed health. And the 20% variation due to\nfamily factors calls for new studies to better understand the family of origin effects on adult\nhealth. Such studies should use twin and sibling designs as well as longitudinal individual\ndesigns. Which factors could be responsible for the unexplained part of the family effect on\nself-assessed health? A first logical candidate seems a genetic factor (or rather: genetic\nfactors). Another candidate would be family culture, especially family habits related to\nhealth and health related behaviour. Although health related behaviour is correlated with\nthe socio-economic position of the family it is likely that families develop specific habits\nand health beliefs that are largely independent of their socio-economic position.\nThis study found higher sibling correlations for education than for adult self-assessed\nhealth, suggesting family factors are more important for educational attainment. Why\nwould shared family factors be less important for adult health? One possible explanation is\nthat during the period when educational attainment is `determined' for most people,\nbrothers and sisters live at home with (one of their) parents and the environment to which\nthey are exposed is quite similar. One's health condition, on the other hand, is shaped\ncontinuously over the life course. During adult life, siblings do not share the family home\nand environment anymore. The circumstances siblings life in become more divergent\nduring adulthood. This would explain lower sibling resemblance later in life for outcomes\nthat have important environmental, social and cultural determinants.\nSome limitations of the study need to be discussed as well. The samples were quite\nsmall and prior studies (i.e., twin studies on self-assessed health) showed mixed results.\nTherefore, more definite conclusions can only be drawn after replication of the current\nfindings. Replications for different age groups and twin registries are especially important.\nAn important limitation of the US sample is its relative small size, and low participation of\nmale siblings. Replications with larger sibling sets, should also address sex differences in\nmore detail.\nAnother limitation is that the results of this study pertain to self-assessed health only.\nFamily resemblance could differ by health indicator. I am not aware of studies showing\ndifferences in sibling (or twin) correlations for the various types of health indicators used\nin social epidemiological research. Still, it seems reasonable to expect that such differences\nexist and, hence, that one should be careful in generalizing the findings of this study.\nThe main strength of this study should also be stressed: the sibling design. This is a\nunique design that allows us to take into account the total family effect. Of course the\ndrawback of the sibling design is that the family effect can not be separated into a genetic\nand non-genetic part. However, it is important to note that a sibling design is much easier\nto implement in large scale survey studies than a twin design. Given the substantial family\nimpact on self-assessed health, using sibling studies and twin data to increase our\nknowledge on social health variations seems highly relevant. Currently, such data are only\navailable for a limited number of countries. There is a need for more and richer data sets\nbased on sibling and twin designs. Generating such data in more countries would not only\nallow us to better test the general hypotheses addressed in this study, but it would also\ncontribute to our understanding of how social variations in health emerge in different types\nof societies.\n"
