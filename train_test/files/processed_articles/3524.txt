Reaction turbines are easy to install, and the operating range is narrow and possesses\nhigher peak efficiency. On the contrary, impulse turbines have the wider operating range and lower peak efficiency.\nSome of the key parameters for Wells turbine are solidity, tip clearance, and the hub-to-tip ratio. Significant performance\nimprovement is possible by redesigning the turbines using optimization techniques. Till date, surrogate modeling and an\nautomated optimization library OPAL are commonly used in optimization of oscillating water column air turbines. In\nthis article, various types of oscillating water column turbines are reviewed, and optimization techniques applied to such\nturbines are discussed. The Wells turbine with guide vane has the maximum efficiency, whereas the axial-impulse turbine\nwith pitch-controlled guide vane has the widest operating range. Turbines with optimized geometry have better overall\nperformance than other turbines.\n",

Masuda developed navigation buoys\ninstalled with air turbine, which is later known as oscillat-\ning water column (OWC) (Masuda, 1986). Later, a large\n(80 m \u00d7 12 m) barge, named Kaimei (Miyazaki and\nMasuda, 1975), was used to test the OWCs. During the\nsame time, Salter (1974) tested a simple mechanism of\nvertical vane pivoted about a horizontal axis which can\ngenerate power using the oscillatory motion of ocean\nwaves. Since then, researchers have developed several dif-\nferent types of wave energy converters and tested in the\nlaboratory or real sea condition. Wave energy converters\nare categorized mainly based on location, size, and work-\nOne of the main issues of OWC is that it is not suitable for\nall coastal regions and requires very specific location char-\nacteristics. In spite of this, the OWCs have been studied\nmost extensively and maximum numbers of prototypes are\ndeployed into the sea.\nThe OWC, a pneumatic type wave energy device, can be\nused as a fixed or a floating type. The plants at Sakata port\nin Japan (Takahashi et al., 1992) and Vizhinjam, India\n(Ravindran et al., 1997) are examples of such plants.

Initially, the oscillation of sea surface is\nconverted to pressure energy in the air chamber and the air\nturbine converts the pressure energy into mechanical shaft\npower (this system is also known as power take off mecha-\nnism). Finally, the generator connected to the turbine con-\nverts the shaft power to usable electrical power.\nMost of the OWC systems for wave energy conversion\nused till date mainly relied on two basic types of air tur-\nbines: the Wells turbine and the impulse turbine. Unlike\nthe conventional impulse turbine, the impulse air turbine\nfor wave energy conversion is used with two rows of guide\nvanes on both sides of the rotor to make the turbine rotate\nin one direction regardless of incident airflow directions.\nHowever, the presence of guide vane on the downstream\nside of rotor introduces losses, which affect the turbine\nperformance considerably (Thakker and Dhanasekaran,\n2005). Figure 2 shows various turbines used in OWCs,\nwhich are discussed in the next section.\nSome authors reviewed the articles on OWC and air\nturbines. Setoguchi et al. (2001a) presented the review of\nimpulse turbines used for wave energy conversion.\nSetoguchi and Takao (2006) and Takao and Setoguchi\n(2012) compared different turbines including Wells and\nimpulse turbines. Falcao and Henriques (2016) extensively\nreviewed air turbines including thermodynamics of air\nchamber and control algorithms applied to OWC turbines.\nHowever, these reviews did not discuss optimization tech-\nniques applied to OWC turbines.\nOptimization works in the area of air turbines are new,\nand very few authors have applied optimization techniques\nto improve the turbine performance through systematic\ndesign optimization. This article discusses different tur-\nbine options along with the performance improvement\nachieved through optimization.\nTurbine classification\nTurbines are devices in which the rotor receives energy\nfrom the flowing fluid and convert this energy into\nmechanical energy. This mechanical energy is converted\ninto electrical power using a generator. Based on the type\nof fluid, turbines are classified as steam, hydro, or air tur-\nbines. The power generated by the turbine is derived from\nequation (1). It is noticed that power developed is a func-\ntion of pressure head and volume flow rate across the\nturbine\nBased on the rationale of energy transfer inside the tur-\nbine, two main types of turbines exist: impulse turbines\nand reaction turbines. In the case of impulse turbines, the\ntotal pressure energy of the fluid is converted to kinetic\nenergy before hitting the rotor blades, whereas in the case\nof reaction turbines, the pressure and kinetic energy both\nchange as the water flow through the rotor blades.\nThe Euler turbo-machinery equation relates the torque\nof the turbine rotor T with the change in moment of\nmomentum of the fluid across turbine rotor (Vavra, 1960)\nT rV dm r V dm\n= -\n \nFigure 1. Schematic representation of OWC.\nFigure 2. Classification of air turbines.\nwhere S refers to the surface of revolution (subscript 1\nrefers to the inlet and 2 the outlet). Applying one-dimen-\nsional approximation, the equation becomes (Dixon, 1995)\nT m rV r V\n= -\n\n( )\nwhere r and V are averaged over the inlet and outlet\nsurfaces, S1\n, respectively. For any axial flow\nmachine with mean radius r r r\n= = , we can write\nequation (3) as\nE r V V\n= -\n ( )\nEquation (4) shows that a positive torque is obtained\nonly when the tangential component of flow velocity at the\ninlet is greater than the outlet, that is, V V\n> . This is\nachieved by the flow deflection inside the rotor. In conven-\ntional turbines, the flow deflection occurs by a row of\nfixed blades upstream of the rotor. However, in the case of\nair turbines for OWCs, as the turbines need to be unidirec-\ntional for a bidirectional flow, the guide vanes are placed\non either side of the rotor. Different combinations of guide\nvanes in both reaction and impulse turbine with their per-\nformance variation are discussed in the following section.\nWells turbine\nWells turbine is an axial flow reaction turbine specifically\nused for wave energy extraction with the help of oscillat-\ning airflow. The turbine is made up of symmetric airfoil\ntype blades placed around a central hub (Figure 3) and\nrotates in one direction irrespective of the direction of the\nairflow. It has a rotational speed limited by the blade tip\nvelocity approaching toward the speed of sound. The tur-\nbine is coupled with the electrical generator and operates\nwith or without guide vanes (Raghunathan et al., 1982).\nThe Wells turbine works on the general aerodynamics\ntheory of airfoil (Gato and Falcao, 1988; Raghunathan\n90\u00b0 stagger angle. The absolute velocity of air hits the\nblade axially and the tangential velocity of the blade acts\nin a direction parallel to the plane of rotation. The relative\nvelocity W acting at an angle  (angle of attack) to the\nblade causes a lift force L perpendicular to the direction of\nW and a drag force D in the direction of W (Figure 4). This\nlift and drag force can be resolved in tangential and axial\ndirection\ntan\nsin cos\n= -\nx\n= +\ncos sin\nFor any airflow direction, the direction of tangential\nforce is always same. Therefore, the direction of the rota-\ntion of turbine always remains the same. For any real fluids,\nthe lift and drag force on the airfoil increase up to a certain\nvalue of the angle of attack () beyond which the flow sep-\narates around the airfoil. The angle at which flow separates\nfrom the airfoil is known as the stall angle. Beyond the stall\nangle, the lift force decreases and drag force increases sig-\nnificantly. As a result, tangential force on the rotor\ndecreases, leading to the decrease in efficiency. Thus, the\nangle of stall bounds the operating range of Wells turbine\nAnother main disadvantage of wells turbine is poor\nstarting characteristics and it is difficult to reach its opera-\ntional speed (Inoue et al., 1986). This phenomenon of tur-\nbine failing to reach its operational speed is known as\nFigure 3. Schematic of a Wells turbine.\nFigure 4. Principle of operation of Wells turbine (Cruz,\n40 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(1)\ncrawling (Raghunathan and Tan, 1982). Changing the hub-\nto-tip ratio and the solidity improves the starting character-\nistics of the turbine.\nParameters of Wells turbine\nSome of the main geometric parameters that affect the per-\nformance of wells turbine are solidity, hub-to-tip ratio,\naspect ratio, and tip clearance. Table 1 gives the analytical\ndescription of the parameters. The parameters are interre-\nlated. Based on the analytical solution, Raghunathan\n(1995a) has given recommended values for these parame-\nters, which are listed in Table 1. To achieve maximum effi-\nciency and wide operating range, optimum values of these\nparameters are required. This is discussed in section\n\"Optimization of air turbines.\"\nSolidity is a way to calculate the blockage of airflow\nwithin the Wells turbine and measures the mutual interac-\ntion between the blades (Cruz, 2008; Raghunathan and\nTan, 1983). With increasing solidity, blades become too\nclose to each other. As a result, blades interact with the\nboundary layer near hub leading to boundary layer separa-\ntion on the surface of the hub as well as on the blade sur-\nface near the hub (Gato et al., 1996; Watterson and\nRaghunathan, 1998). This creates end wall losses in the\nhub region. The effect of the hub-to-tip ratio is well stud-\nied (Raghunathan, 1995a), and the results indicate that\nefficiency decreases with the increasing hub-to-tip ratio.\nEffects of guide vane angle and tip clearance\n(Dhanasekaran and Govardhan, 2005; Setoguchi et al.,\nperformance of Wells turbine. Halder and Samad (2014)\ncarried out numerical analysis to study the effect of guide\nvane angle on the performance of Wells turbine. For a par-\nticular symmetrical blade profile (NACA 0021) under\nsteady-state condition, guide vane angle of 11.8\u00b0 gives\nmaximum efficiency. The efficiency is maximum for a tip\nclearance of 1% (Halder and Samad, 2015a). In addition, a\ncircumferential groove (Halder et al., 2015b) with a groove\ndepth of 3% chord length produces the highest power and\nwidest operating range. Also for a particular operating\npoint, 26% improvement in efficiency is achieved using\nGuide vanes, self-pitch control blades, biplane turbines,\nblade sweep, and duct geometry improve the performance\nand starting characteristics of the turbine (Gato and Falcao,\net al., 2000). Two stages of blades (Figure 5), both with\nsymmetric and asymmetric blade profile, were studied\n(Gato and Curran, 1996). In a contra-rotating turbine, both\nthe rows of blade rotate in different directions (Figure 6).\nLIMPET used two contra-rotating turbines each connected\nmum power output (Boake et al., 2002). One of the recent\ndevelopments in Wells turbine is to use three-dimensional\n(3D) blade where the blade thickness varies in the radial\nand NACA0025 at hub and tip, respectively, to create a\nnew 3D blade geometry. Halder and Samad (2015b) stud-\nied a blade profile created by combining NACA0015 and\nNACA0024 at the hub and tip section, respectively. Results\nindicated that the 3D blade has better performance in terms\nof peak efficiency. All the modifications discussed here are\nsummarized in Table 2 for better understanding.\nImpulse turbine\nThe main difference between a reaction turbine and an\nimpulse turbine is the way energy transfer occurs in the\nrotor. Impulse turbines are classified based on the direction\nof airflow through it: axial and radial. An impulse turbine\ncan be made bidirectional flow turbine using guide vanes\non both sides of the rotor. Airflow deflected by the guide\nTable 1.

Two-stage (biplane) Wells turbine (Mohamed,\nFigure 6. Contra-rotating Wells turbine (Mohamed, 2011).\nvanes hits the rotor blade and gives \"impulse\" to the tur-\nbine. Because of the symmetrical nature of the guide vanes\nand rotor blade, the turbine always rotates in the same\ndirection irrespective of the direction of airflow (Figure 8).\nThis type of turbine is also known as a self-rectifying tur-\nbine. Furthermore, guide vanes can be classified as fixed,\nself-pitch-controlled, and link mechanism type.\nAlthough Wells turbine was the first choice to be used\nin OWCs because of its self-rectifying characteristics, it\nhas many inherent disadvantages (Setoguchi et al., 2001a).\nAxial turbines are very popular for its simplicity and ease\nof operation in both unidirectional and bidirectional flows.\nHowever, the axial turbines produce high axial thrust\nwhich causes fatigue failure of bearings. Radial turbines\nproduce less axial thrust compared to the axial turbine. In\naddition, the torque obtained by the radial turbine is high\ndue to the radial configuration. In spite of high damping\nproduced by the radial turbine, it is favorable because of its\ntoughness and low maintenance cost (Setoguchi et al.,\nAxial impulse turbines\nTurbine with self-pitch-controlled guide vane. The most pop-\nular alternative of the Wells turbine is the axial flow\nimpulse turbine. The geometry of the rotor blades of axial\nflow impulse air turbine is just a modified version of con-\nventional steam turbine of impulse type. In the case of\nself-pitching guide vane, two sets of guide vane on either\nside of the rotor are pivoted and change direction accord-\ning to the direction of flow with the help of aerodynamic\nmoment. Guide vanes are also capable of changing orien-\ntation in the right direction for efficient operation (Figure\n9). The upstream guide vanes act as a nozzle and down-\nstream guide vanes act as a diffuser (Setoguchi et al.,\nand experimental result of an impulse turbine with self-\npitch-controlled guide vane. This is done for both steady\nflow and oscillating flow conditions. As part of the Indian\nwave energy program, an impulse turbine with self-pitch-\ncontrolled guide vane is tested in the OWC-based wave\nenergy plant at Vizhinjam (Santhakumar et al., 1998).\nLater, Setoguchi et al. (2004) carried out numerical anal-\nysis of this type of turbine to understand the performance\nwith respect to various parameters such as Reynolds\nnumber and hub-to-tip ratio. From the idea of self-pitch-\ncontrolled guide vanes, Liu et al. (2016) developed and\nstudied an impulse turbine with pitch-controlled blade.\nFor the particular turbine studied, results show that the\nrotor blade pitch angle of 5\u00b0 gives the best efficiency in a\nwave cycle. The turbine shows better performance than\nFigure 7. Three-dimensional blade (Takao et al., 2015).\nFigure 8. Schematic diagram of flow through impulse turbine.\nFigure 9.

Similar to the self-pitch-con-\ntrolled guide vanes in impulse turbine, Wells turbine can\nbe used with self-pitch-controlled blades, where the sym-\nmetrical airfoil blades change the stagger angles by them-\nselves to obtain higher torque (Figure 10; Setoguchi\nTurbine with fixed guide vane.Although the turbine with\nself-pitch-controlled guide vane operates with higher effi-\nciency over a wide range of flow rates, it has certain inher-\nent disadvantages because of the variable geometry design.\nIt requires a powerful configuration to withstand the self-\npitching mechanism for a substantial number of oscillation\ncycles per day. In addition, the turbine consists of a large\nnumber of moving parts, which leads to higher operating\nand maintenance cost. Fixed guide vane can mitigate all\nthese problems with the cost of overall performance of the\nturbine. Kim et al. (2000) carried out two-dimensional\nnumerical analysis based on full Reynolds-averaged\nNavier\u00adStokes equation to investigate the internal flow\nbehavior of an impulse turbine with fixed guide vanes.\nResults from other numerical analyses indicate that maxi-\nmum efficiency occurs for a guide vane angle of 30\u00b0\nshows that significant total pressure drop occurs in the\ndownstream guide vanes, which leads to the lower perfor-\nmance of the turbine. Thakker and Dhanasekaran (2005)\ncarried out a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis\non 3D guide vanes using the well-known vortex theory.\nExperimental results indicate that the efficiency can be\nimproved by an average of 4.5% points by incorporating\n3D guide vanes (Thakker et al., 2005). Numerical analysis\nof flow through impulse turbine (Badhurshah et al., 2014)\nshows that the flow separation occurs in the tip region near\ntrailing edge of the blade. However, with the increase in\nrotational speed, the separation points shifts toward the\nhub. A study on rotor solidity ratio recommends solidity of\nThe comparison of the starting characteristics with Wells\nturbine shows that both the types of impulse turbines\naccelerate faster than the Wells turbine (Figure 11).\nRadial impulse turbines\nSelf-rectifying radial-flow impulse turbines are studied to\ninvestigate the suitability to use as air turbine for wave\nFigure 10. Air-turbine with self-pitch-controlled blade\nFigure 11.

Radial turbine with active pitch-controlled\nguide vanes (Figure 12) has been studied thoroughly by\nmodel test under steady sinusoidal flow. The steady sinu-\nsoidal flow is expressed as\nU U U f\n= + ( )\nmax\nwhere U is the inlet air velocity, f is the frequency of air-\nflow, and  is the time step.\nThe characteristic of internal flow behavior is clarified\nwith the help of such tests. In addition, results show that\nthe performance of this turbine is much superior compared\nto the conventional fixed guide vanes radial turbine (Takao\net al., 2005). Experimental tests were carried out on a bi-\nradial impulse turbine under unidirectional steady flow\ncondition (Gato et al., 2012). As wave energy turbines are\ninstalled inside a cylindrical configuration, the flow behav-\nior near the tip of the blade and guide vanes is different\nfrom conventional turbines. Results show that the turbine\nmaximum efficiency reduces by up to 8% if the tip clear-\nance changes from 0% to 4% of the blade span (Pereiras\nA new concept of twin impulse turbine was proposed\nand model tested by Jayashankar et al. (2009) and Mala\net al. (2011). The experiment results show considerable\nimprovement in operating range. In addition, the wave to\nwire efficiency crosses 50% with this specification.\nThakker et al. (2009) provided a chart for selection of\nimpulse turbine for wave energy extraction. The chart is\nbased on experimental data. For example, it can be seen\nthat for a rated power of 400 kW, the recommended rotor\ndiameter from the chart would be 1.6 m.\nWells turbine versus impulse turbine\nOne of the main disadvantages of impulse turbine is the\naerodynamic loss. This happens due to the large inci-\ndence angle of airflow near the downstream row of guide\nvanes (Karthikeyan et al., 2013); this is inevitable as it is\nrequired for the symmetry of the guide vanes. A compari-\nson of both the turbines indicates that the impulse turbine\nhas a wider operating range than the Wells turbine.\nHowever, it comes at a cost of peak efficiency; the peak\nefficiency of impulse turbine hardly exceeds 50% (Figure\n13). For Wells turbine, the peak efficiency drops sharply\nwhen the stall occurs at a higher flow rate. To reduce the\nlosses, variable geometry of guide vanes is proposed,\nwhich is discussed in the previous section. A comparison\nof efficiency with different non-dimensional flow coef-\nficient for the two types of turbines is shown in Figure\n13. The two-dimensional flow analysis by Falc\u00e3o and\nGato (2012) indicates that the change in Reynolds num-\nber has more impact on Wells turbine efficiency com-\npared to the impulse turbine efficiency.\nPresently, there are a number of wave energy plants\noperating on the OWC technology. A list of the types of\nturbines being used and respective countries is mentioned\nin Table 3. The list is not exhaustive, as there are few other\nFigure 12. Radial turbine with pitch control guide vane (Takao et al., 2005).\n44 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(1)\nwave energy plants, which are in developing stage. It can\nbe seen that most of the prototypes and actual plants have\nused Wells turbine for operation.\nOptimization of air turbines\nOptimization is a mathematical procedure aimed at find-\ning the best solution among the whole set by efficient\nquantitative and qualitative methods. This section pre-\nsents literature that tries to understand the performance\nand behavior of various types of turbines with optimized\nconfigurations. Optimization of the full system using\nmodern computational methods can bring significant\nimprovement in performance.\nOptimization techniques are commonly used in turboma-\nchines and aerospace systems to improve performance.\nApplication of optimization is seen in wind turbines for per-\nformance improvement. However, literature related to opti-\nmization of wave energy system is limited. Unlike trial and\nerror method, optimization here refers to numerical optimi-\nzation using different algorithms. In the last decade, few\nauthors have come up with the optimized geometry of OWC\nair turbines that shows better performance compared to con-\nventional turbines. This section gives a detailed review of\noptimization methods used in OWC air turbines.\nOptimization approaches are classified into traditional\n(direct or gradient based) and heuristic methods. Heuristic\nmethods are favored in engineering optimization problems\ndue to its capability of finding the global optima in less\ncomputational time. Authors worked on optimization of\nair turbines using two main types of optimization tech-\nniques: surrogate modeling and an automated optimization\nalgorithm, OPtimization ALgorithm (OPAL). Surrogate\nmodel is an approximate model developed from hi-fidelity\ncomputational models such as CFD. On the other hand,\nOPAL is an optimization library that couples the computer-\naided design (CAD) model with the CFD code. Parameters\nof wave energy turbines are interrelated. A multi-variable\nmulti-objective optimization (MOO) is required to arrive\nat an optimized geometry for best performance.\nBadhurshah and Samad (2015) carried out multiple\nsurrogate\u00adassisted genetic algorithm\u00adbased MOO on an\nimpulse turbine to enhance the performance. The design\nvariables were number of rotor blade and guide vanes and\nthe objectives were the minimization of pressure drop and\nthe maximization of shaft power of the turbine. Response\nsurface approximation, neural network, kriging, and a\nweighted-average surrogate (WAS) were used to generate\nFigure 13.

The effi-\nciency, which is a function of the both the objectives, is\nincreased by ~11% through this investigation (Figure 14).\nAnother study by the same author (Badhurshah and Samad,\n2014) on the optimization of an impulse turbine shows that\nrelative efficiency can be improved by approximately 13%\nover the full range of the flow coefficient (Figure 15).\nMohamed (2011) developed an automated optimization\nalgorithm, where a system can be optimized using a genetic\nalgorithm and performance evaluation by CFD technique.\nThe optimization of the airfoil shape (Figure 16) leads to a\nrelative gain of 11.3% in power output and 1% increase in\noverall efficiency throughout the full operating range\n(Mohamed et al., 2011). The same algorithm applied to\nnon-symmetric airfoil blades and self-pitch control blades\n(Mohamed and Shaaban, 2014) shows significant improve-\nment in performance of the turbine.\nGomes et al. (2012) developed a two-step optimiza-\ntion method for two-dimensional blade section of an\naxial flow impulse turbine. A 3D geometry is obtained by\nstacking two-dimensional optimized sections in spanwise\ndirection. A CFD analysis of initial design and the opti-\nmized design shows almost 5% improvement in effi-\nciency. Halder and Samad (2016) determined optimal\nturbine speed for Wells turbine using surrogate-based\noptimization technique. A multiple surrogate\u00adbased\napproach is used to determine optimal turbine speed for\ndifferent flow velocities. The analysis shows that a tur-\nbine with 3% groove depth gives better performance than\na turbine with 1% tip clearance. Another study by Halder\net al. (2017) used the surrogate modeling technique to\noptimize the blade sweep angle. The optimized turbine\nblade has backward sweep at mid-section and forward\nsweep at tip section. For the optimized geometry, torque\ncoefficient increased by 28.28% and the operating range\nincreases by 18.18%. It is clearly visible that optimization\ntechniques have been used successfully to improve the\nperformance of air turbines. A complete 3D optimization\nmay be complicated and numerically expensive; however,\nit can give more accurate result than the previous ones.\nAll the design modifications done using optimization are\nsummarized in Table 4.\nConclusion\nA comprehensive review of OWC air turbines (Wells and\nimpulse turbines) is reported in this article. Previous\nreview articles on OWC air turbines discuss different\ndesign modifications and comparison with various tur-\nbines. Unlike previous review papers, this article concen-\ntrates on the optimization of air turbines used in OWCs\nalong with a discussion on parameters of the air turbine.\nIt is expected that this article will help researchers in\nOWC optimization to acquaint with the present state of\nthe art. Some of the main findings of this article are sum-\nmarized here:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Among the various parameters affecting the perfor-\nmance of Wells turbine, blade solidity and tip clear-\nance are the most important. Small tip clearance\nincreases efficiency by reducing leakage loss,\nwhereas a large tip clearance postpones stall and\nprovides wider operating range. The performance\nof Wells turbine is limited by stall, and in varying\nsea condition, a wide operating range is preferable\nover the efficiency of turbine.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Impulse turbines required guide vanes to operate on\nbidirectional airflow. Variable pitch guide vanes have\nbetter performance than fixed guide vanes in terms of\nwider operating range and higher efficiency.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Radial turbines are complex in operation and main-\ntenance, whereas the axial turbines are simple in\nFigure 14.

Optimized\ngeometry shows overall performance improvement\nin all the cases.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Most of the works on air turbine considered the tur-\nbine geometry separately. However, the perfor-\nmance of air turbine is influenced greatly by the\nhydrodynamics of the OWC. As a future research, it\nis suggested to analyze the performance of OWC\nalong with the air turbines.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nBadhurshah R and Samad A (2014) Surrogate assisted design\noptimization of an air turbine.
