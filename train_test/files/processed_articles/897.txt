This\nresearch examined patterns of food intake in Mexican Americans and their\nassociations with GBD.\nDesign: Cross-sectional.\nwho participated in the 1988\u00b194 third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III). GBD was diagnosed by ultrasound. Food intake patterns were\nidenti\u00aeed by principal components analysis based on food frequency questionnaire\nresponses. Component scores representing the level of intake of each pattern were\ncategorized into quartiles, and prevalence odds ratios (POR) were estimated relative\nto the lowest quartile along with 95% con\u00aedence intervals (CI).\nResults: There were four distinct patterns in women (vegetable, high calorie,\ntraditional, fruit) and three in men (vegetable, high calorie, traditional). After age\nadjustment, none were associated with GBD in women. However, men in the third\nthe traditional intake pattern were half as likely to have GBD as those in the lowest\nquartile.\nConclusions: These \u00aendings add to a growing literature suggesting dietary intake\npatterns can provide potentially useful and relevant information on diet\u00b1disease\nassociations.

We chose to focus on Mexican\nAmericans because prevalence of the disease is high,\nparticularly in Mexican American women; based on data\nfrom NHANES III, age-adjusted prevalence in this\npopulation is 8.9% in men and 26.7% in women, compared\n13.9% in African American men and women, respec-\ntively35. We used NHANES III data to: (i) identify food\npatterns in Mexican American women and men using\nprincipal components analysis; and (ii) examine the\nassociations of these patterns of intake with GBD.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy population\nNHANES III, a cross-sectional survey conducted from 1988\nto 1994, followed a complex four-stage probability\nsampling scheme designed to represent the entire United\nStates civilian non-institutionalized population over the\nage of 2 months36. Mexican Americans were oversampled\nto comprise nearly a third of the survey population, and\nMexican American ethnicity was self-reported. Participation\nin the survey included interviews conducted at the subjects'\nhomes in either English or Spanish, followed by a physical\nexamination, a diet and health interview, and diagnostic\ntests conducted at a mobile examination centre (MEC).\nDisease status\nIndividuals between the ages of 20 and 74 years were\ninvited to receive a gallbladder ultrasound examination at\nthe MEC using real-time ultrasonography administered by\na certi\u00aeed abdominal ultrasound technician. Cases were\nde\u00aened as subjects with gallstones if opacity was viewed\nin the gallbladder producing a distal shadow in both the\nsupine and the left decubitus positions, according to\ncommonly used criteria34. If the gallbladder was not seen\nby ultrasonography and a right upper quadrant or\nepigastric scar was observed, it was concluded that a\ncholecystectomy, or surgical removal of the gallbladder,\nhad been performed. GBD was de\u00aened as either having\ngallstones or having undergone cholecystectomy. Video-\ntapes of all ultrasound examinations were independently\nreviewed by radiologists specializing in abdominal\nultrasonography. The Kappa statistic37 was used to\nevaluate agreement between technicians' and radiologists'\ndiagnoses and was found to be 0.94.\nDietary intake and other covariates\nHousehold interviews included a food frequency ques-\ntionnaire in which respondents estimated the number of\ntimes per day, week or month that they ate each of 60 food\nitems during the previous month. Individuals were also\nasked about the type of milk they usually drank; with the\nreplacement of one generic milk item with four more\nspeci\u00aec milk items, there was a total of 63 food items from\nthe food frequency questionnaire. A list of these foods is\nprovided in the Appendix. The food list used for the\nquestionnaire is similar to those used in previous\nNHANES, with several food items added to capture the\nintake of important sources of nutrients related to cancer,\ncardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. The food list was\nadditionally modi\u00aeed to include important foods con-\nsumed by non-Hispanic whites, African Americans and\nMexican Americans, who made up the three major\nsubgroups of the NHANES III study population. Informa-\ntion on foods consumed by these subgroups was based on\ndata from NHANES II and the Hispanic Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (HHANES). Food frequency\nresponses were used to identify patterns of food intake,\nwhich were then related to GBD status.\nOther interview information was obtained prior to\nultrasound examination. Regular breakfast consumption\nwas used as a proxy for length of overnight fast, and\nattempted weight loss during the past 12 months was used\nas a proxy for history of dieting. Subjects were classi\u00aeed as\never-smokers if they reported smoking at least 100\ncigarettes during their entire lifetime. Body mass index\n(BMI) was calculated using measurements made at the\nMEC. Information on reproductive factors for women was\nobtained in a separate questionnaire administered at the\nMEC and included current pregnancy, total number of live\nborn children, birth control pill use and oral oestrogen or\nfemale hormone use.\nIdenti\u00aecation of food intake patterns\nWe used principal components analysis38 to identify eating\npatterns underlying the intake of foods in Mexican\nAmerican women and men (SAS version 6.11, SAS\nInstitute, Cary, NC). We conducted analyses in women\nand men separately. Individuals were randomly placed\ninto one of two equally sized groups, or split samples, and\nanalyses were conducted in the two split samples for each\nsex in order to con\u00aerm the reliability of results. For each\nof the four groups, we constructed a matrix of correlations\namong the frequency of consumption per month for the\n63 food items, and the correlation matrix was entered in\nthe principal components analysis.\nThe number of meaningful components to retain\nfrom the total number extracted depended chie\u00afy on the\nexamination of scree plots and on interpretability of the\ncomponents39. Four components consistently emerged in\nboth split samples of women, and three consistently\nemerged in men; thus, four components in women and\nthree in men were retained for rotation. Since orthogonal\nand oblique rotations produced similar results, we present\nthe results from the orthogonal rotation only.\nAlthough in general the same major patterns emerged in\nboth samples in women and men, slightly different sets of\nfoods loaded highly on each component across split\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

To reconcile results from the split samples for each\nsex, we identi\u00aeed sets of `de\u00aenite' and `possible' foods to\nattach to each pattern. `De\u00aenite' food items were those with\nloadings of at least 0.30 in both split samples, but whose\nloadings on other components were substantially less.\n`Possible' foods were those whose loadings were above\n0.20 for the given component in both split samples but less\nfor other components. The decision to include or exclude\nthese `possible' foods from the set of foods describing each\npattern was based on their effects on the component's\ncoef\u00aecient alpha40, used to evaluate internal consistency for\neach component retained. To \u00aenalize the set of foods to\nattach to each pattern, we \u00aerst calculated a coef\u00aecient alpha\nbased on both `de\u00aenite' and `possible' foods together. If\nremoval of a `possible' food from the set resulted in a higher\ncoef\u00aecient alpha for one or both split samples, then we\nexcluded that food from the pattern description.\nWe calculated factor scores for each pattern by taking\nthe unweighted sum of standardized frequencies of intake\nfor each food associated with the pattern. A factor score\nwas calculated for each dietary pattern for each individual\nand was taken to represent the individual's level of intake\nfor the pattern.\nOver 95% of the study participants responded to all 63\nitems in the food frequency questionnaire. Three\nindividuals who missed at least 54 items were excluded\nfrom these analyses. If individuals were missing responses\non individual foods in any given pattern of food intake\nidenti\u00aeed by principal components analysis, we imputed a\nvalue for the missing food by taking the average\nstandardized frequency of all other non-missing foods in\nthat pattern. This was necessary in 40 instances in 38\nwomen, and in 90 instances in 80 men. One man was\nexcluded from analyses on the traditional food intake\npattern because there were not enough non-missing\nresponses for other food items in that pattern to impute\nvalues for missing foods.\nData analysis\nWe categorized factor scores into quartiles and calculated\nprevalence odds ratios PORs as measures of association\nbetween each food intake pattern and GBD41. PORs and\ntheir 95%CI were estimated using unconditional logistic\nregression modelling41 and were weighted using SUDAAN\nsoftware (SUDAAN version 7.0, Research Triangle Institute,\nResearch Triangle Park, NC) to take into account the\ncomplex sampling design.\nPORs were adjusted for age by including age in the\nmodel as a continuous variable. They were further\nadjusted for other potential confounders, including regular\nbreakfast consumption, attempted weight loss last year and\nsmoking history. In women, additional variables evaluated\nas potential confounders were number of live births, ever\nuse of birth control pills, ever use of oral oestrogen or\nfemale hormones, and current pregnancy status.\nWe also investigated the effect of controlling for BMI as a\npossible intermediate in the pathway between some dietary\npatterns and GBD. Because the log odds ratio for GBD did\nnot increase in a linear fashion with increasing BMI in men,\nBMI was entered into logistic regression models as a\nand > 30kgm-2, corresponding with categories of normal\nrange BMI, grade 1 overweight, and grades 2 and 3\noverweight, respectively, as suggested by a World Health\nOrganization (WHO) Expert Committee42. We also left BMI\nas a continuous variable in models for women since the log\nodds ratio for GBD increased linearly with increasing BMI\nin women. However, because results were similar\nregardless of how BMI was coded, results are presented\nonly for the WHO method of categorization for both sexes.\nWe estimated PORs for selected individual foods from\nthe food frequency questionnaire that have been\nassociated with GBD previously. We estimated intake of\nsimple sugars from sweetened beverages and from\ndesserts. Monthly frequency of intake of sweetened\nbeverages was estimated by summing together responses\nfor regular sodas and Kool-Aid-type drinks, such as Hi-C,\nTang and Hawaiian Punch. Because including coffee and\ntea did not materially affect results, we present \u00aendings\nwithout these two beverages. Desserts included summed\nresponses for chocolate and pastries, and alcohol included\nsummed responses for beer, wine and liquor. We created\ncategories of frequency of intake per month that were\nequivalent to the following categories: never, less than\nonce a week, 1\u00b12 times per week, 2\u00b16 times per week,\nevery day and more than once a day. Categories were\nsubsequently collapsed depending on the frequency\ndistribution for each food item to ensure an adequate\nnumber of subjects within each group.\nWe conducted tests for linear trend in the log odds ratio\nof categories of intake for each food pattern by \u00aetting a\nlogistic model with age and an ordinal variable representing\nthe median factor score for each pattern quartile.\nWe performed additional analyses using more limited\ncase de\u00aenitions by: (i) excluding cholecystectomy cases,\nassuming that cases with gallstones at ultrasound were less\nlikely to alter their diets as a result of disease diagnosis or\nsymptoms; and (ii) additionally excluding gallstone cases\nwho had been told by a doctor that they had gallstones.\nThese exclusions served to limit cases to those least likely\nto be aware of their disease status and, hence, least likely\nto alter their dietary habits as a result of disease.\nResults\n2335 men \u00b1 were interviewed at home and invited to\nreceive a gallbladder ultrasound. Characteristics of the\nstudy population are shown in Table 1, and associations\nbetween various risk factors and GBD in the population\nare shown in Table 2.\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

The\ncomponents retained could explain only a small amount\nof the variation in food intake in our population; together,\nthe four patterns in women accounted for 19\u00b120% of the\ntotal variance, while the three in men accounted for about\n15%. Coef\u00aecient alphas for the retained components are\nalso shown in Table 3.\nTo give an idea of the differences in food intake across\nquartiles for each pattern, median monthly frequencies of\nintake of selected foods for each pattern are shown in Fig.\n1 for women and Fig. 2 for men. Median frequencies of\nintake for these foods ranged from zero or once a month in\nthe \u00aerst quartile, to as high as once every day in the fourth\nquartile. Mean BMI did not vary substantially by quartile\nfor any of the patterns (data not shown).\ntion on disease status. Because adjustment for other risk\nfactors and for BMI did not appreciably change odds ratio\nestimates or alter our conclusions, only age-adjusted\nPORs are presented. None of the patterns of intake\nappeared to be associated with prevalence of GBD in\nwomen (Table 4). In men, the traditional pattern was\ninversely associated with GBD prevalence: men in the\nthird and fourth quartiles of intake of this pattern were\nroughly half as likely to have GBD as those in the lowest\nquartile. Age-adjusted PORs were generally similar when\nwe used the more limited case de\u00aenitions that excluded\ncholecystectomy and diagnosed gallstones.\nIn analyses on individual foods (Table 5), alcohol was\ninversely related to GBD in both women and men;\nindividuals who drank alcohol more than twice a week\nduring the previous month were about half as likely to\nhave GBD as non-drinkers. There was an inverse\nassociation between beans and GBD in men only, and a\nweak inverse association with desserts in women only.\nTable 1 Characteristics of the Mexican American study population by sex in the\nthird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988\u00b194\nWomen Men\nCountry of birth (%)\n*Numbers may differ because of missing responses for each characteristic.

We chose to use principal components\nanalysis to examine food intake patterns, \u00aerst identifying\nfoods that are correlated with each other or occur together\nin the diets of our study participants, and then categorizing\npeople according to their level of intake of each set of\nfoods identi\u00aeed. Although principal components analysis\nhas been criticized for de\u00aening patterns that may not be\nreproducible across populations55, two patterns identi\u00aeed\nin the present study, the high-calorie and fruit/vegetable\npatterns, resembled the `western' and `prudent' patterns\nidenti\u00aeed in two recent studies conducted in two separate\nbe reasonably reproducible and valid based on dietary\ndata from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.\nAnother study looked at dietary patterns de\u00aened by\nprincipal components analysis in Mexican American\nwomen speci\u00aecally, using data from HHANES46. Again,\nthere were similarities among patterns identi\u00aeed in that\nand the present study. The `nutrient dense' and `traditional'\npatterns identi\u00aeed in the HHANES analysis corresponded\nwith the vegetable and traditional patterns identi\u00aeed in the\npresent study. Our `high-calorie' pattern appeared to be a\ncomposite of the `transitional' and `nutrient dilute' patterns\nidenti\u00aeed in that study. Other patterns identi\u00aeed were\n`protein-rich', `high-fat dairy' and `mixed dishes'. The\nseven factors extracted in the HHANES analysis explained\n59% of the total variance in frequency of consumption of\nthe food groups. In contrast, the three to four factors\nextracted in our analyses could explain only 15\u00b120%. The\ndifference in proportion of variance explained arose in\npart because we extracted fewer factors. More important,\nhowever, in the HHANES analysis, 47 foods were\nFig. 2 Median monthly frequency of intake of selected foods by\nquartile for each food intake pattern in Mexican American men: third\nTable 5 Age-adjusted prevalence odds ratios and 95%CI for\ngallbladder disease by levels of intake for speci\u00aec foods in Mexican\nAmericans, by sex: third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nWomen Men\nAlcohol\nBeans\nDesserts\n*P value for trend was obtained for each food intake pattern by including an\nordinal variable representing the median frequency for each quartile into the\nlogistic model.\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

We chose not to collapse\nfood categories because different individual food items \u00b1\nalthough it may seem to make biological or intuitive sense\nto group them together \u00b1 are consumed in different\ncontexts and in different combinations of which we may\nnot be aware a priori. Thus, rather than create groups of\npotentially dissimilar foods, we chose to use principal\ncomponents analysis to establish relationships among\nindividual food items empirically.\nWe are unaware of other studies that have systematically\ndescribed food intake patterns to evaluate GBD risk,\nalthough two studies have found that vegetarians are less\nlikely to have gallstones than non-vegetarians57,58. Other\nstudies have looked at the association of GBD with\nspeci\u00aec foods. Some have observed a positive association\nassociations for foods may be attributed to speci\u00aec factors\nin these foods, or they may represent the effect of other\nfoods with which they are consumed in the diet.\nIn our study, there was no clear association of GBD with\nsweetened beverages and desserts or with \u00aesh. We found\nan inverse association with beans in men but no trend, while\nbeans appeared to be associated with higher prevalence in\nwomen when we used a more limited case de\u00aenition. An\nexperimental study in Chilean men suggested that legume\nintake may increase biliary cholesterol saturation, thereby\ncontributing to gallstone occurrence64. Reasons for the\ndiscrepant \u00aendings regarding legumes are unknown.\nConsistent with most previous research, we found an\ninverse association between alcohol intake and\nagainst gallstone development through its association with\nreduced biliary cholesterol saturation and higher serum\nIt is possible that diet is a more important contributor to\nGBD in men than in women. While no strong risk factors\nfor GBD have emerged for men, several have been\nidenti\u00aeed in women, including BMI, oral contraceptive\nand oestrogen use, and parity. In the women in our study\npopulation, BMI and number of live births were strongly\nassociated with GBD; these, rather than diet, may be more\nimportant determinants of disease in this group.\nImportantly, in men, a strong association with tradi-\ntional intake pattern and GBD was found, while only a\nlimited, non-dose-related association was seen with\nbeans, which is a component of the traditional pattern.\nFurthermore, it is unclear if the association between the\ntraditional pattern and GBD can be attributed to a single\nspeci\u00aec component of the diet, such as \u00aebre. In this study\npopulation, the traditional food pattern was associated\nwith a lower per cent of kilocalories from total fat, but a\nhigher intake of cholesterol and \u00aebre (data not shown). It\nis notable, however, that one recent clinical trial found no\nreduction in gallstone recurrence in individuals given a\nhigh-\u00aebre, low-re\u00aened-carbohydrate diet65. In additional\nanalyses in our study population, we found no major\ndifferences in intake between those with and without\ndisease for any single nutrients of a priori interest,\nincluding total fat, cholesterol and \u00aebre (data not shown).\nSelection bias and selective over- or underreporting are\nunlikely to have produced the observed inverse associa-\ntion between the traditional intake pattern and GBD. The\nextent to which the association might be confounded by\nother potentially confounding factors such as physical\nVarious features of NHANES III made it more dif\u00aecult to\n\u00aend an association between intake patterns and disease.\nThe dietary questionnaire used in NHANES III was not\ndesigned speci\u00aecally to measure dietary patterns. Also,\naspects of the food frequency questionnaire \u00b1 for\nexample, random error arising from dif\u00aeculty in estimating\nfrequency of intake \u00b1 may have attenuated correlations\namong foods, leading to imprecise estimation of factor\nscores. The grouping of dissimilar food items in the\nNHANES III food frequency questionnaire may also have\nattenuated correlations among foods, weakening the\nfactor structure of the food items, and contributing to the\nrelatively low coef\u00aecient alphas we observed for some of\nthe components. A stronger factor structure might have\nproduced more internally consistent and precisely\nquanti\u00aeable intake patterns.\nFurthermore, dietary data were collected at the time of\ndisease ascertainment and may not re\u00afect past intake or\nintake during the relevant period of disease development.\nDifferential change in consumption patterns over time\nmay explain the failure to \u00aend an association for some\ndietary patterns. However, limiting cases to those\npresumably unaware of their gallstones did not alter our\nconclusions. Also, the proportion of non-cholecystectomy\ngallstone cases reporting abdominal pain during the\nprevious year was similar to that in the non-case population\n(data not shown), suggesting that most of them were\nindeed asymptomatic. Although it is possible that such an\napproach may limit \u00aendings to asymptomatic or less severe\ncases, we \u00aend no reason to expect differences in risk\nfactors for the development of asymptomatic as opposed\nto symptom-associated gallstones.\nWe found a traditional intake pattern to be inversely\nassociated with GBD prevalence, but only among Mexican\nAmerican men. This pattern proved at least as, if not more,\nstrongly associated with GBD as did examination of\nindividual foods. That none of the food intake patterns\nidenti\u00aeed in women were associated with GBD may\nsuggest that other lifestyle factors are more important\ndeterminants of GBD, such as BMI and reproductive\nfactors. The purpose of this research was not to uncover\naetiology but to determine if food intake patterns as a\nmeans of characterizing dietary intake are associated with\ndisease.
