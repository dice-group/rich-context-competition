To date,\nour knowledge of the post-translational modification of\nPMP22 is limited. Using the CSS-Palm 2.0 software we\npredicted that C85 (cysteine 85), a highly conserved amino\nacid located between the second and third transmem-\nbrane domains, is a potential site for palmitoylation. To\ntest this, we mutated C85S (C85 to serine) and established\nstable cells lines expressing the WT (wild-type) or the\nC85S-PMP22. In Schwann and MDCK (Madin\u00adDarby\ncanine kidney) cells mutating C85 blocked the palmitoyla-\noctadecynoic acid). While palmitoylation was not neces-\nsary for processing the newly synthesized PMP22 through\nthe secretory pathway, overexpression of C85S-PMP22 led\nto pronounced cell spreading and uneven monolayer\nthinning. To further investigate the functional significance\nof palmitoylated PMP22, we evaluated MDCK cell\nmigration in a wound-healing assay. While WT-PMP22\nexpressing cells were resistant to migration, C85S cells\ndisplayed lamellipodial protrusions and migrated at a\nsimilar rate to vector control. These findings indicate that\npalmitoylation of PMP22 at C85 is critical for the role of\nthe protein in modulating epithelial cell shape and\nmotility.\n",

In a variety\nof cell types, overexpression of PMP22 has been shown to\naffect cellular morphology and lead to membrane protrusions\nby unknown mechanisms (Brancolini et al., 1999). In\nendothelia and epithelia, PMP22 is a constituent of inter-\ncellular junctions and its expression level affects the barrier\nproperty of the monolayer (Notterpek, 2001; Roux et al.,\nextensive morphological and organisational changes of\nthe plasma membrane that occur during myelination, as\nin the absence of PMP22 the cells do not form normal myelin\nimpact these diverse cellular functions is not known but likely\ninvolves post-translational modifications of the protein.\nS-palmitoylation is a reversible, post-translational modi-\nfication in which the 16-carbon saturated lipid palmitate is\ncovalently added to cysteine residues via a thiolester linkage\n(Linder and Deschenes, 2007).

Based on BLAST searches,\nthis cysteine residue is conserved in PMP22 orthologues among\nvertebrates, including humans, mammals, chicken (Gallus\ngallus), frogs (Xenopus laevis and tropicalis) and zebrafish\n(Danio rerio) (Figure 1A), underscoring its likely importance.\nTo examine the potential palmitoylation of PMP22, we\nchose MDCK (Madin\u00adDarby canine kidney) epithelia and\nprimary rat Schwann cells, both of which are amenable to\nPMP22 overexpression and protein trafficking studies (Roux\net al., 2005). Here, we show that while palmitoylation of\nration of the newly synthesized protein, this lipid modifica-\ntion has a dramatic influence on how PMP22 affects\nepithelial cell morphology and migration.\nCell culture, cloning and establishment of stable\ncell lines\nTo make non-palmitoylated PMP22, a cDNA encoding the WT\n(wild-type) mouse protein with a human influenza HA (hae-\nmagglutinin) epitope tag sequence in the second extracellular\nloop in the pCMX vector was used as a template (Tobler et al.,\nDiagrammatic representation of PMP22 (top) with the conserved region surrounding C85 across species (A). Palm-YFP (B), parental\ncontrol (Cont), or WT and C85S-PMP22 expressing MDCK (B\u00adD) or Schwann (E) cells were metabolically labelled with the palmitate\nanalogue 17-ODYA or DMSO vehicle (B\u00adE). YFP (B) or PMP22 (C\u00adE) were immunoprecipitated from RIPA buffer-soluble (B, C, E) and\n-insoluble (D, E) extracts. Immunoprecipitates were reacted with biotin azide, and equal portions were treated with either Tris (T) or\nHN and processed for blotting. The same blot was probed sequentially for 17-ODYA (biotin) and then for Palm-YFP (GFP) or PMP22\n(HA). Palmitoylation of WT-PMP22 is detected as a broadband of biotinylated proteins near 25 kDa (arrows), which is removed by HN,\nbut not by Tris (T) treatment. Arrowheads in the MDCK and Schwann cell samples mark the migration position of the immature, Endo\nH-sensitive PMP22. Palmitoylation is absent in C85S-PMP22 expressing cultures.

Clones were fully se-\nquenced for verification. cDNA encoding WT or C85S-PMP22\nwas then subcloned into the pEFIRES-P vector (Hobbs et al.,\n1998). To create stable lines, MDCK type II cells were\ntransfected on six-well plates at approximately 50% conflu-\nence using 8 ml of LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) and 3 mg\nof DNA (WT or C85S in pEFIRES-P or empty pEFIRES-P vector)\nin a final volume of 2 ml of medium per well. After 28 h,\npuromycin was added at 4 mg/ml to kill non-transfected cells.\nThe next day, puromycin was decreased to 2 mg/ml and\nmaintained at this level for eight additional days. Resulting\ncolonies were pooled, expanded and either maintained for\nexperimental analyses or frozen in aliquots. Puromycin was\nadded to the media at 2 mg/ml for 24\u00ad48 h immediately\npreceding each experiment. Primary rat Schwann cells were\ncultured as described (Johnson et al., 2005), and transfected on\nDNA. Cells were grown in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle\n.\nConfluent cultures were split on to tissue culture dishes at 1:5\nand maintained using established procedures (Johnson et al.,\nAntibodies and fluorescent organelle markers\nHA 3F10 (Roche), anti-a-tubulin (Sigma), anti-ZO1\n(Invitrogen), anti-GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehy-\ndrogenase; EnCor Biotechnology Inc.), anti-GFP (green\nfluorescent protein; Abcam), anti-ezrin (Cell Signaling),\nanti-caveolin 1 (BD Biosciences) and anti-actin (Sigma).\nFluorescein (FITC)-conjugated organelle markers Con A\n(concavalin A-FITC) and VVL (Vicia villosa lectin-FITC) were\npurchased from Vector Laboratories, and Alexa FluorH-594-\nconjugated phalloidin, Lysotracker Red DND-99 and Hoechst\nwere obtained from Invitrogen.\nLabelling of palmitate via click chemistry\nMDCK or rat Schwann cells transiently expressing Palm-YFP\n(palmitoylatable yellow fluorescent protein) (Zacharias et al.,\nnoic acid; Cayman Chemical.

After labelling, cells were lysed in RIPA\n(radioimmunoprecipitation assay) buffer, separated into\ndetergent-soluble and -insoluble extracts, and processed for\nIP (immunoprecipitations) as described (Zoltewicz et al.,\n2009), with the following modifications. To create insoluble\nextracts, RIPA-insoluble pelleted material was first solubilized\n10% DMSO, then diluted with 0.9 ml of SDS-free RIPA, spun\nfor 10 min, and supernatants were transferred to clean tubes.\nTotal protein in lysates was measured using the BCA\n(bicinchoninic acid) kit (Pierce).

Eluates (24 ml) were transferred to fresh tubes and\nthe following reagents added individually to perform the Cu-\nbiotin azide (Invitrogen), 0.5 ml 50 mM TCEP [Tris-(2-\ncarboxyethyl)phosphine] hydrochloride (Thermo Fisher\n(Sigma). Reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h with\nintermittent mixing, and then 0.5 ml of 0.5 M EDTA added to\nterminate the reactions. Then, 7.5 ml of each reacted eluate\nwas mixed with an equal volume of 2 M Tris, pH 7.5 (control)\nor 2 M HN (hydroxylamine), pH 7.5, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for\n3 h. Samples were reduced with 5 mM DTT (dithiothreitol) at\n80\u00b0C for 5 min, and resolved on gels and blotted.\nImmunoblotting\n12% gels in Mops buffer and NuPAGE reagents (Invitrogen),\nand blotted as described (Zoltewicz et al., 2009). Blots were\nprobed sequentially for YFP with anti-GFP or for PMP22 with\nanti-HA and then for biotin with streptavidin-HRP (horseradish\nperoxidase) (Thermo Scientific). Films were digitally imaged\nand analysed as described (Rangaraju et al., 2010). For\ndeglycosylation reactions, 15 mg of total cell lysates were\ndigested with Endo H (endoglycosidase H) or PNGase F (peptide\nN-glycosidase F) (New England Biolabs) and subsequently\nprocessed for immunoblotting (Pareek et al., 1997).\nPulse-chase labelling experiments\nPulse-chase analyses were performed as described (Pareek et al.,\nwere labelled with 125 mCi/well 35S-methionine and cysteine\ncontaining media for 30 min, and then chased with unlabelled\nmedia for the indicated times. RIPA buffer-soluble extracts were\nmade from cells harvested at each time point. Protein was\nmeasured and concentrations normalized to 1 mg/ml. Then\n500 mg of each sample was incubated with HA beads overnight\nat 4\u00b0C with mixing, then beads were washed five times with RIPA\nbuffer. Immunoprecipitate yields were divided in half and either\ntreated with Endo H or G5 reaction buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% 2-\nmercaptoethanol and 0.05 M sodium citrate, pH 5.5) alone,\nresolved on gels, incubated with Amplify (GE Healthcare), dried\nand exposed to film.

For labelling non-permeabilized cells,\nthe TX-100 step was omitted. For samples double-stained with\nmouse and rat primary antibodies, the labelling was done\nsequentially, and secondary antibodies specifically adsorbed\nagainst the opposite species were used to prevent cross-\nreactivity (goat anti-mouse min6rat DyLight 488, goat anti-\nrat min6mouse DyLight 594; Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs\nInc.). Acidic compartments in live cells on coverslips were\nidentified by incubation with 1 ml/ml Lysotracker Red DND-99\n(Invitrogen) for 45 min at 37\u00b0C, fixed, and processed for\nvisualization. Samples were imaged using a Spot camera\nmounted on a Nikon E800 microscope, or with a Hamamatsu\nCCD camera and an Olympus IX81-DSU spinning disk confocal\nmicroscope. Images were processed with Spot or Slidebook\nsoftware followed by Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator CS.\nFully-confluent and uniform monolayers of MDCK cells on\ncoverslips were immunostained for ZO1 as above, and four\nseparate images were captured from similar locations on each\ncoverslip. Images were opened using ImageJ software and the\npolygon tool was used to trace the ZO1 boundaries of a group\nof approximately 100 cells, and the software calculated the\narea within the outline. The number of nuclei within the area\nwas counted, and the total area was divided by the number of\nnuclei to give the average apical area per cell. To image in the\nXZ plane, Z-stacks were collected at 0.25 mm steps with a\nLeica TCS SP2 AOBS Laser scanning spectral confocal\nmicroscope, projected and examined in section view.\nWound migration studies\nMonolayer cell wounding assays were performed on 4-well\nPermanox plastic chamberslides (Nunc, Roskilde) as described\n(Roux et al., 2005) with the following modifications. Mono-\nlayers were rinsed before and after wounding. After removal of\nmedia, a P1000 pipette tip with suction was used to make\nwounds and take away detached cells in completely confluent\nmonolayers. Wounds were imaged with a Nikon TS100 inverted\nmicroscope equipped with a Nikon DS camera immediately\nafter initial wounding and 6 and 20 h later. To ensure that\nidentical areas were imaged at the selected time points,\nmultiple positioning marks were made on the culture plates. To\ndetermine migration areas, edges of the wounds were carefully\ntraced with the polygon tool of ImageJ software. Areas at the\ntwo time points were then used to compute the percentage of\nwound closure during the test period.\nRac activity assay\nRac activity in MDCK cells was measured using the G-LISA\nabsorbance based Rac1 activation assay kit (Cytoskeleton\nInc.). MDCK cells were lysed in buffer provided by the\nmanufacturer and clarified lysates were incubated in Rac-\nGTP-binding protein-coated wells. Following washes to\nremove non-specific binding, bound Rac1-GTP was detected\nusing anti-Rac1 primary and HRP-linked secondary antibod-\nies. The read-out was obtained at wavelength 490 nm.\nStatistical analyses\nFor all experiments, means\u00a1S.D. were calculated and statis-\ntical significance determined by performing unpaired two-\ntailed t tests using GraphPad Prism software, or online\ncalculators for S.D., t test and P value.\nRESULTS\nTo investigate whether PMP22 is palmitoylated, we used CSS-\nPalm 2.0 software, which predicts the likelihood of\npalmitoylation within an input amino acid sequence (Ren et\nfavourable palmitoylation score. To test whether PMP22 is\npalmitoylated at this site, we mutated C85S, a conservative\nchange expected to preserve protein structure, and stably\nexpressed normal mouse WT or C85S-PMP22 in MDCK type II\ncells. An HA epitope tag in the second extracellular loop of\nPMP22 was added for detection, as a tag in this position\nneither affects the processing nor the trafficking of the\nprotein (Tobler et al., 1999). To detect palmitoylated proteins\nin our cell lines, we employed a non-radioactive method in\nwhich cells are metabolically labelled with the palmitic acid\n2009). ODYA is identical with palmitate except it contains\na single-terminal alkyne group which can be reacted with a\nbiotin-azide reporter via the Cu(I)-catalysed azide-alkyne\n[3+2] cycloaddition (i.e., click chemistry) (Martin and Cravatt,\nthen be rapidly detected on Western blots with streptavidin-\nHRP (Figures 1B\u00ad1E). As a positive control for palmitoylation,\nwe used Palm-YFP, which is identified with anti-GFP\nantibodies (Zacharias et al., 2002). Palm-YFP-expressing\nMDCK cells were metabolically labelled with 17-ODYA or its\nsolvent DMSO (control) and Palm-YFP was immunoprecipi-\ntated from cell lysates, followed by click-labelling and\nimmunoblotting (Figure 1B). The immunoprecipitated Palm-\nYFP displays both YFP and biotin-labelling in 17-ODYA but\nnot in DMSO-treated cells (Figure 1B, top). To demonstrate\nthat the 17-ODYA is linked via a labile thiolester bond, click-\nlabelled Palm-YFP immunoprecipitates were treated with Tris\n(T) as a control, or with HN (Charron et al., 2009; Martin and\nCravatt, 2009). HN hydrolyses thiolester bonds and leads to\nthe disappearance of the Palm-YFP label, as compared with\nS.J.

This result signifies that the 17-ODYA\nlabel is S-bonded.\nControl and WT- or C85S-PMP22 expressing MDCK cells were\nsimilarly labelled with 17-ODYA or its solvent DMSO and lysed\nin RIPA buffer for immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibod-\nies. RIPA buffer soluble (Figure 1C) and insoluble (Figure 1D)\nfractions were processed separately. Although both WT and\nC85S expressing cells immunoprecipitated PMP22, only WT-\nPMP22 showed HN-sensitive 17-ODYA labelling (Figures 1C\nand 1D). Furthermore, the majority of both WT- and C85S-\nPMP22 is detected within the RIPA buffer insoluble fraction,\nwith approximately 90% of the palmitoylated PMP22 parti-\ntioning in this pool (Figure 1D). Compared with WT-PMP22\nexpressing cells, lysates from the C85S cultures contain a\npronounced fast migrating fraction in the detergent-soluble\npool (Figures 1C, arrowhead and 1D), likely indicating altered\nprocessing of the palmitoylation-deficient PMP22.\nWe also determined whether PMP22 acquires palmitoyla-\ntion in Schwann cells which are the most robust site of\nrat Schwann cells transfected with the WT- or the C85S-\nPMP22 construct expressed the recombinant HA-tagged\nprotein (Figure 1E). Consistent with the MDCK cells, only\nWT-PMP22 is 17-ODYA-labelled, as detected with biotin-HRP.\nThe observed broad migration pattern of the recombinant\nprotein seen in these experiments is consistent with the gel\nmobility of PMP22 from sciatic nerves, and is likely due to\nheterogeneity in the carbohydrate modification of the\nprotein (Pareek et al., 1997). The mild reducing conditions\nrequired to protect the S-linked 17-ODYA label may have also\ncontributed to PMP22 migrating as a smear (Figures 1C\u00ad1E).\nTogether these results show that PMP22 acquires palmitoyla-\ntion at C85 in both epithelial and glial cells, and mutating this\ncysteine to serine abolishes the palmitoylation of the protein.\nPalmitoylation is not essential for the\nAs palmitoylation is known to affect the trafficking of mem-\nbrane proteins through the secretory pathway (Franch-Marro\nPMP22 by pulse-chase analyses using the MDCK culture model\n(Figure 2A). Our previous studies show that the majority of\nnewly synthesized PMP22 is targeted for proteasomal\ndegradation and only approximately 20% of the protein\nacquires complex carbohydrate modification which can be\ndetected by resistance to Endo H (Pareek et al., 1997;\nRangaraju et al., 2010). Indeed, at the 2 h chase time point,\nnearly all of the newly synthesized WT-PMP22 is Endo H\nresistant (,98%) (Figure 2A, arrow). In comparison, the C85S-\nPMP22 still contains a visible Endo H sensitive fraction\n(Figure 2A, arrowhead), which comprises approximately 15%\nof the total protein at 2 h. Therefore abolishing the\npalmitoylation of PMP22 slows the maturation of newly\nsynthesized protein; however, it does not block its processing\nthrough the secretory pathway.\nTo corroborate the results of the pulse-chase experiments,\nwe compared the glycosylation state of WT- and C85S-PMP22\nFigure 2 Palmitoylation of PMP22 is not required for the maturation of the protein\nParental control (cont.), WT- or C85S-PMP22 expressing MDCK cells were labelled with 35S-methionine and cysteine for 30 min and\nthen chased with unlabelled media for the indicated times (A). RIPA buffer-soluble extracts were immunoprecipitated with HA\nmatrix, divided in half and incubated with (H) or without (C) Endo H. Endo H resistant PMP22 is marked with an arrow, while the\nEndo H-sensitive PMP22 is marked with an arrowhead. To assess the glycosylation of PMP22 at steady-state, total cell lysates\n(10 mg/reaction) were incubated without enzyme (C), or with Endo H (H) or PNGase F (N) and blotted with an anti-HA antibody (B).\nLight exposure (top panel) of the film shows mature Endo H-resistant PMP22 migrating at around 25 kDa (H, arrows), while the\ndeglycosylated polypeptide resolves approximately 18 kDa (N, arrowheads). A dark exposure of the same blot (lower panel) detects\nEndo H-sensitive PMP22. Molecular mass, in kDa. Semi-quantitative analyses of five independent experiments reveal that over 80%\nof WT and C85S-PMP22 similarly achieve Endo H-resistance at steady-state (C).\nPalmitoylation of PMP22\nE 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nat steady-state (Figure 2B). Total protein lysates of WT or\nC85S-PMP22 expressing MDCK cells were treated with Endo H\nor PNGase F, which removes all N-linked carbohydrates from\nPMP22 (Pareek et al., 1997). As shown on the anti-HA Western\nblots, the majority of both WT- and C85S-PMP22 is resistant\nto Endo H digestion, and shifts to approximately 18 kDa migra-\ntion position upon PNGase F treatment (Figure 2B, arrowhead).\nA dark exposure of the same blot reveals the Endo H sensitive\nfraction in the samples, with a more prominent band in the\nC85S-PMP22, as compared with WT (Figure 2B, arrowhead).\nNonetheless, semi-quantitative analyses of five independent\nexperiments did not detect a statistically significant difference\nbetween the cell lines and indicate that over 80% of WT and\nC85S-PMP22 similarly acquire Endo H resistance at steady-\nstate (Figure 2B and 2C).\nWe also examined the trafficking of WT and C85S-PMP22\nthrough the secretory pathway using organelle markers and\nconfocal microscopy (Figure 3). As suggested by the bio-\nchemical studies (Figure 2), neither WT- nor C85S-PMP22 is\nretained in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum), which we\nidentified with the lectin, Con A (Figure 3A, green). On single\nplane confocal images, large intracellular PMP22-positive\nvacuoles (detected by HA-reactivity) are prominent in both\nWT- and C85S-PMP22 expressing cells (Figure 3A arrows).\nCells were also co-stained for PMP22 and VVL, a Golgi marker\n(Figure 3B, green). In agreement with the processing of\nPMP22 through the Golgi compartment and the resistance\nof the protein to Endo H at steady-state (Pareek et al., 1997)\n(Figure 2), some anti-HA positive structures in both WT and\nC85S-PMP22 co-localize with VVL (Figure 3B, arrows).\nAdditionally, the cultures were reacted with anti-HA antibody\nafter loading with Lysotracker Red, a dye that is taken up by\nacidic compartments such as lysosomes in living cells. Neither\nWT nor C85S-PMP22 accumulates in Lysotracker-positive\nvesicles, unless the expression of the recombinant protein is\nvery high (Figure 3C, arrows). Together these results indicate\nthat deletion of the C85 palmitoylation site in PMP22 does\nnot significantly impact the intracellular processing of the\nprotein, as compared with WT.\nWT and C85S are targeted to the plasma\nmembrane and influence the distribution of\napical membrane proteins\nMDCK cells form polarized monolayers where the targeting of\nproteins to the basolateral and apical membranes can be\nexamined (Kroepfl and Gardinier, 2001).

To\nconfirm the localization of PMP22 to the apical membrane,\nnon-permeabilized cells were first reacted with the anti-HA\nantibody and subsequently treated with detergent and\nincubated with an antibody to the apical marker GP135/\npodocalyxin (Ojakian and Schwimmer, 1994) (Figure 4B).\nUsing this approach, we detected a notable co-localization of\nwhen imaged under identical conditions, we observed\nintensified GP135-like immunoreactivity in both WT- and\nC85S-PMP22 cultures as compared with vector control\n(Figure 4C).

Ezrin-like staining appears in fine speckles\nsimilarly in WT- and C85-PMP22 cultures (Figure 4D).\nTo determine whether the palmitoylation of PMP22 affects\nthe distribution of the protein with respect to lipid-rich micro-\ndomains (Erne et al., 2002) we co-immunostained cells with\nanti-HA and anti-caveolin 1 antibodies (Figures 4E\u00ad4G). In\npermeabilized cells, WT- and C85-PMP22 are extensively co-\nlocalized with caveolin-1 yielding yellow colour on merged\nimages (Figure 4G). Furthermore, we noticed a redistribution\nof caveolin-1 between vector control and PMP22 expressing\ncells. Whereas caveolin-1 is distributed throughout the cells in\nnon-transduced and vector control cultures (Figures 4E\u00ad4G,\narrowheads), the overexpression of PMP22 leads to clustering\nof caveolin-reactive microdomains (Figures 4E\u00ad4G, arrows).\nTo corroborate the findings from the immunolocalization\nstudies, next we assessed the expression of the studied apical\nproteins in lysates of vector control, WT- and C85-PMP22\ncultures (Figure 4H). In agreement with the immunolabelling\nstudies (Figure 4C), Western blot analyses show the up-\ncompared with vector control (Figure 4H). In contrast, we\ndid not detect notable changes in the levels of ezrin, actin or\ncaveolin in response to PMP22 overexpression. Semi-\nquantitative analyses of six independent experiments dem-\nonstrate a nearly 7-fold increase in GP135 levels in WT- and\nC85-PMP22 cultures as compared with vector controls\n(Figure 4I). These results indicate that although palmitoyla-\ntion is not required for apical targeting of PMP22, the\ndistribution and levels of certain apical proteins are impacted\nby the overexpression of PMP22, with discernible differences\nbetween WT and C85S.\nFigure 4 Palmitoylation of PMP22 influences the cell surface distribution of the protein, and overexpression of WT- or C85S-PMP22\nimpact the levels of GP135 and the localization of caveolin\nNon-permeabilized MDCK cultures were immunolabelled with anti-HA antibodies to detect PMP22 on the cell surface (A, B). WT-\nPMP22 is detected in clustered puncta which are often arranged in ring-like patterns (arrows). In C85S cells, PMP22-like distribution\nis more diffuse, with some clustering (arrowheads). Anti-HA-like immunoreactivity is absent in vector only MDCK cells (A9, inset).\nEndogenous apical proteins GP135 (B, C) and ezrin (D) have similar distribution patterns between WT- and C85S-PMP22 cells, and\nshow partial co-localization with PMP22 (B). When imaged for the same exposure times, PMP22 overexpressing cells show elevated\nlevels of GP135-like staining (C), while ezrin appears unaffected (D). In permeabilized cells, intracellular PMP22 (green) is extensively\nco-localized with caveolin-1 (red) positive vesicles, which appear larger and more clustered when PMP22 is overexpressed (arrows in\nE\u00adG), as compared with non-expressing cells (arrowhead in E and vector panels).

As displayed on the single plane confocal images,\nboth WT- and C85S-PMP22 are co-localized with ZO-1 at\nintercellular junctions (Figures 5A and 5B) indicating that the\npalmitoylation state of PMP22 is not crucial for targeting\nthe protein to these sites. In agreement with our previous\noverexpression of the mouse PMP22 is associated with an\nincrease in the apical cell surface as compared with vector\ncontrols (Figures 5A, 5A9 and 5C). Notably, the apparent apical\ncell area is further increased in C85S-PMP22 cells in\ncomparison with WT (Figures 5A and 5B). To quantify this\neffect, confluent MDCK monolayers were immunostained with\nanti-ZO1 antibody and the apical areas were assessed.\nMeasurements in over 400 cells per condition revealed a\nnearly 30% increase in apical area upon overexpression of\nC85S-PMP22, as compared with vector control (Figure 5C). The\nexpanded apical area of C85S cells could be due to a flattened\nmorphology, as seen before in human WT-PMP22 cultures\n(Roux et al., 2005), or a gross increase in overall cell\ndimensions. To evaluate cell height, confluent monolayers\nstained for filamentous actin were imaged in the XZ plane\nFigure 5 Palmitoylation-deficient PMP22 is detected at intercellular junctions and is associated with an increase in apical cell area\nPermeabilized MDCK cultures were double immunolabelled with anti-HA (PMP22, red) and Z01 (green) antibodies and imaged by\nconfocal microscopy (A, B).

Control and WT-PMP22 expressing monolayers\ndisplay relatively even heights while the C85S monolayer\nshows thinning, and a rolling hill-like morphology, with peaks\nover the nuclei and valleys in between (Figure 5D, arrows).\nThus, the increased apical area of C85S cells is associated with\nmorphological changes in spreading and flattening.\nAnother important aspect of epithelial biology modulated\nby PMP22 is cell migration, which can be assessed by the\ncapacity of monolayers to heal after wounding (Roux et al.,\n2005). Epithelial cells form an actin belt along the wound\nedge and leader cells extend lamellipodia and actively draw\nthe monolayer forward to close the wound (Fenteany et al.,\nand several layers deep, flatten and spread out as lamellipo-\ndial crawling proceeds. In such a wound-migration assay,\nhuman WT-PMP22 expressing MDCK cells closed wounds\napproximately 60% slower than controls and displayed\nreduced lamellipodial protrusions (Roux et al., 2005). Using\nthe same cell migration assay, we find that when the cultures\nwere stained with the F-actin marker, phalloidin, WT-PMP22\nexpressing cells display a nearly uninterrupted actin purse-\nstring along the wound edge and only few lamellipodial\nprotrusions (Figure 6A, arrowhead). In contrast, C85S and\ncontrol cultures contain leader cells with lamellipodial\nprotrusions, as they migrate to close the wound (Figure 6A,\narrowheads). In agreement, when nuclei in wounded mono-\nlayers are visualized, WT cultures appear compact at the\nwound edge, while C85S cells spread out as effectively as\nvector controls (Figure 6B). To quantify these observed\ndifferences, we analysed MDCK cell migration 6 and 20 h\nafter wounding (Figure 6C). Consistent with the morpho-\nlogical observations, mouse WT-PMP22 expressing cultures\nare slow to migrate as compared with vector control. In\ncontrast, C85S-PMP22 cultures close wounds quite effi-\nciently, showing no slowing relative to vector control\n(Figure 6C). Rho-like GTPases which include Rac1 have been\nidentified as key regulators of epithelial architecture and cell\nmigration (Sander and Collard, 1999). As both lamellipodial\nformation and cell migration are substantially decreased in\nwounded WT monolayers (Figures 6A\u00ad6C), we hypothesized\nthat Rac1 activity may be inhibited either directly or\nindirectly by overexpressed WT-PMP22. To test this, we\nFigure 6 Palmitoylation of PMP22 slows cell migration during wound closure\nProtrusive activity and distribution of actin were examined along the wound edge 24 h postwounding (A).

Indeed, Rac 1 activity is reduced by approximately 18%\nwhen PMP22 is overexpressed, and this result is consistent\namong multiple independent experiments with WT and C85S\ncultures (Figure 6D). However, since lamellipodia morphology\nand migratory behaviour are normal when C85S-PMP22 is\noverexpressed, downstream effectors of Rac1 activity may be\ndifferentially affected by the palmitoylation of PMP22.\nTogether these results suggest that the palmitoylation state\nof PMP22 is a critical determinant in modulating the\ninteractions of the protein with molecules influencing\nepithelial cell migration.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, we show that mouse PMP22 is palmitoylated at\nfurther demonstrate that the palmitoylation state of PMP22\nimpacts the trafficking and function of the protein in MDCK\ncells. While at steady-state both WT and C85S-PMP22 acquire\n.80% resistance to Endo H digestion, by pulse-chase\nanalyses we detect slower maturation of the mutant protein\nas compared with WT. We find that in polarized epithelia WT-\nand C85S-PMP22 sort differently at the apical plasma\nmembrane and partially co-localize with GP135 and caveolin.\nThe overexpression of WT- or C85S-PMP22 similarly increases\nthe levels of GP135 and alters the localization of caveolin.\nAdditionally, WT and C85S cultures display morphological\ndifferences at confluence with C85S cells appearing apically\nexpanded and flattened. In a wound-migration assay, WT cells\nresist changing morphology or migrating, while C85S cells\nperform similarly to vector controls. Overall, these data\nindicate that while palmitoylation of PMP22 is not essential\nfor targeting the protein to the plasma membrane, it favours\nthe maintenance of a compact, stable monolayer.\nPost-translational modification is critical for the function-\ning of membrane proteins, yet for PMP22 this aspect has not\nbeen investigated in detail. Previously, we found that glyco-\nsylation at asparagine 41 was not essential for trafficking\nPMP22 to the plasma membrane; however, it had an influence\non PMP22 oligomer stability (Ryan et al., 2000). Palmitoylation\nhas recently emerged as a reversible post-translational\nmodification that can influence the trafficking of proteins\nbetween membrane compartments (Linder and Deschenes,\n2007). In polarized cells, such as neurons and myelinated glia,\nthe correct and dynamic trafficking of proteins to specific\nmembrane domains is critical for basic function (Fukata and\nFukata, 2010). While a large number of palmitoylated neuronal\nproteins have recently been identified, with regard to glial\nbiology this modification has been less studied. As lipid\nmodifications, such as palmitoylation, increase the hydropho-\nbicity of proteins, it is highly likely that palmitoylated proteins\nare abundant in myelinated glial cells. Indeed, myelin protein\nzero (P0), which constitutes approximately 50% of the total\nprotein in peripheral nerve myelin was shown to be palmi-\nBizzozero, 1996). More recently, it was reported that\npalmitoylation of P0 peptides increases the immunogenicity\nof the protein, suggesting a role in immune-mediated disorders\nof the peripheral nervous system (Beaino and Trifilieff, 2010).\nWhile we have not investigated how palmitoylation influences\nthe functioning of PMP22 in peripheral nerves, there are two\nhuman neuropathy-associated mutations (L80P, L82P) (Tyson\net al., 1997) that dramatically decrease the palmitoylation\nscore for C85 from high (likely) to low (unlikely). This data\nraises the possibility that these mutations impact nerve health\nvia a negative effect on PMP22 palmitoylation.\nBesides being a hydrophobic tetraspan membrane protein,\nand the conservation of C85 across species (Figure 1), PMP22\nhas other properties that suggest a critical role for palmitoyla-\ntion in regulating the activity of this disease-linked molecule.\nAs mentioned above, PMP22 forms homodimers and larger\noligomers (Tobler et al., 2002), which could be regulated by\nis an aggregation-prone proteasome substrate that accumu-\nlates in cytosolic aggregates when the proteasome is inhibited\nor the protein is overproduced (Fortun et al., 2006; Tobler et al.,\n1999). While the specific site(s) of ubiquitination have not\nbeen identified, accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated PMP22 is\ndetected in cells after proteasome inhibition (Fortun et al.,\n2005). As palmitoylation has been shown to prevent the\nubiquitylation of proteins (Linder and Deschenes, 2007) it is\npossible that the subcellular fate of PMP22, at least in part,\nis regulated by dynamic interactions between these two\npathways. Interestingly, our pulse-chase studies did not detect\nincreased degradation of the palmitoylation-deficient PMP22,\nbut rather showed an extended half-life of the Endo H-\nsensitive C85S protein, as compared with WT (Figure 2). This\nfinding indicates slowed trafficking and/or recycling of C85S-\nPMP22 between the early-Golgi and ER compartments, which\nare check points for PMP22 protein quality control (Pareek\nThe interpretation of the results presented in this article is\nlimited by the fact that we used the MDCK cell model, rather\nthan primary Schwann cells. The rationale for taking this\napproach stems from previous reports that have proposed an\nanalogy between the apical and basolateral domains of\nepithelial cells and compact and non-compact myelin,\nrespectively (Kroepfl and Gardinier, 2001). For instance, PLP\n(proteolipid protein), a component of compact myelin in\noligodendrocytes, is targeted apically in MDCK cells (Kroepfl\nand Gardinier, 2001). Furthermore, molecular control of\npolarization in peripheral nerve myelin has been shown to be\nsimilar to that in epithelial cells (Ozcelik et al., 2010). In\naddition, while overexpression of PMP22 can induce cell\ndeath and membrane blebbing in Schwann cells (Fabbretti\net al., 1995), in MDCK cells we found a remarkably efficient\nmaturation of the exogenous mouse protein (Figures 2 and\nS.J. Zoltewicz and others\n418 E 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n3). Using this model allowed us to detect PMP22 on the apical\nmembrane in non-permeabilized MDCK cells, which is also\nthe site for proteolipid protein targeting (Kroepfl and\nprotein components of compact myelin (Bronstein, 2000),\nthis finding further validates the use of polarized epithelia for\nstudies of myelin protein trafficking.\nA somewhat surprising finding in our studies concerns the\nefficient trafficking of palmitoylation-deficient PMP22 to the\nplasma membrane (Figures 3\u00ad5). This is in contrast with\nfindings in cultured oligodendrocytes, where palmitoylation\nregulates the sorting of proteins to specific membrane\ndomains (Schneider, 2005). In co-cultures of neurons and\noligodendrocytes, palmitoylated proteins were translocated\ninto myelin-like membranes while a palmitoylation-deficient\nPLP mutant did not target efficiently to these sites. Similarly,\nanother tetraspan protein claudin-14, was less efficiently\nlocalized to specific membrane domains when palmitoylation\nwas abolished by site-directed mutagenesis (Van Itallie, 2005).\nIn our approach, instead of using a chemical method to block\npalmitoylation in general, we used site-directed muta-\ngenesis to selectively prevent the palmitoylation of PMP22.\nWhile we did not detect pronounced differences in the\nlocalization of WT- or C85S-PMP22 in the major organelles,\nthe distribution of the exogenous proteins on the apical plasma\nmembrane is distinct. As palmitoylated proteins tend to asso-\nciate with each other and are found in lipid rafts (Zacharias et\nal., 2002), it is likely that this lipid modification influences the\ninteraction of PMP22 within the plasma membrane either by\nassociation with rafts, or with other hydrophobic or palmi-\ntoylated proteins. Differences in the distribution of WT- and\nC85S-PMP22 at the plasma membrane could also influence\nfunctionality and downstream signalling. Up-regulation of\nGP135 but not ezrin (Figure 4) suggests that PMP22 is involved\nlishes a preapical domain in single MDCK cells, and its down-\nregulation causes defects in polarization (Meder, 2005). As our\nevidence indicates that PMP22 is upstream of GP135, it may\nalso be a regulator of these processes. In addition, GP135 is the\ncanine orthologue of human podocalyxin, involved in\nformation of podocytes in the kidney, and a malignancy\nmarker in a variety of cancers (Hsu et al., 2010). PMP22 has also\nbeen implicated in cancer, raising the possibility that PMP22\ncould influence GP135/podocalyxin expression in some types\nof tumours.\nHow might the palmitoylation state of PMP22 alter the\nmorphology and migrational status of cells from a mechanistic\nperspective? Concerning cell morphology, WT cells in confluent\nmonolayers are compact whereas C85S cells are spread out and\nresist adopting a compact morphology (Figures 4\u00ad6). These\nresults suggest that palmitoylated PMP22 is involved in the\nefficient transition from a polygonal, flat morphology to a\ncompact, columnar shape at confluence. Furthermore, the\nwound-healing assay shows that C85S cells are quite able to\nspread out and migrate across the wounded area, while WT\ncells resist doing so (Figure 6). The inhibitory activity of WT-\nPMP22 on lamellipodial protrusion and cell migration, in part\nare likely driven by inhibition of Rac1 at the plasma membrane,\nyet both WT- and C85S-PMP22 similarly inhibit Rac1 activity,\nand increase the expression of GP135 (podocalyxin) an indirect\nThis finding suggests that the palmitoylation state of PMP22\nimpacts the interaction(s) of the protein with other signalling\npathways that influence the migratory behaviour of epithelia.\nBesides affecting Rac1 activity, another plausible way WT-\nPMP22 might affect these processes is through interaction\nwith occludin, a tetraspan tight junction protein recently\nshown to regulate epithelial migration (Du et al., 2010).\nOccludin knockdown decreased formation of lamellipodia at\nthe wound edge in MDCK cultures and increased the actin belt.\nEndogenous canine PMP22 is co-expressed with occludin at\napical intercellular junctions in MDCK cells (Notterpek, 2001),\nwhich raises the possibility that palmitoylated PMP22 may\naffect occludin at the junctions and interfere with its activity.\nIn summary, based on these findings it will be important to\ninvestigate whether palmitoylation affects the trafficking,\ntargeting, or function of PMP22 within Schwann cells and\nmyelin. Particularly, in light of known disease-causing PMP22\nmutations near the palmitoylation site (Tyson et al., 1997)\nadvancing the understanding of PMP22 lipid modifications\nwill likely provide insights into conditions that centre on\n"
