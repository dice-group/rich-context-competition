Unlike\nHuman cooperative breeding\nother animals, infants need care long after they have been weaned. Nevertheless, mothers\noften raise multiple children due to their short birth interval. Such a high breeding rate is\nsupported by help from others (Hrdy, 2009). That is, humans have evolved a breeding\nsystem in which group members other than the genetic parents (i.e., alloparents) frequently\nhelp the parents rear their offspring (Hrdy, 2005). One unique point in humans is that\nmultiple individuals contribute to childcare--male and female kin and non-kin ranging\nfrom juveniles to older adults (Kramer, 2010)--because human society consists of many\nunrelated group members (Hill et al., 2011). As a result, child rearing still naturally causes\nsocial interaction in modern society. In fact, Wood, Giles-Corti, Zubrick, and Bulsara\n(2013) revealed that child rearing influenced broad social interactions, community\nparticipation, and social capital in neighborhoods.\nSuch a cooperative breeding system is maintained by two psychological-proximate\nfactors. The first is the interest in infants presented by non-parent individuals. Generally,\nprimates are attracted to infants (Hrdy, 2009). However, in non-cooperative breeding\nspecies, such as Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) or chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),\nthe individuals showing the highest interest in infants are restricted in young nulliparous\nfemales (Hiraiwa, 1981; Nishida, 1983). This tendency is also seen in species showing\nalloparenting, such as Hanuman langurs (Semnopithecus entellus) (Hrdy, 1976) or Vervet\nmonkeys (Cevcopithecus aethiops) (Lancaster, 1971). On the other hand, in common\nmarmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus), which breed\ncooperatively, motivation toward parenting is not limited to young nulliparous females but\nis shown by other group members as well (Saito, Izumi, and Nakamura, 2011; Zahed,\nWith regard to studies on humans, Maestripieri and Pelka (2002) examined sex\ndifferences regarding interest in infants across the lifespan and showed that preferences for\ninfant silhouettes over those of adults decreased steadily with age in women. The authors\nexplained their findings from an evolutionary perspective: Young girls show interest in\ninfants to learn caretaking skills, as has been shown in other primates. Contrasting results\nwere yielded by observational studies. One version of such studies was the waiting room\nexperiment. In these studies, responsiveness to a live infant in the waiting room was\nNash and Feldman, 1980). In another version, passersby looking, smiling at, and talking to\nan adult and an infant (Schleidt, Schiefenhvel, Stanjek, and Krell, 1980) or simply looking\nat them (Robinson, Lockard, and Adams, 1979) were analyzed in the field. These studies\nrevealed that minors and older adults reacted more to the infant than middle-aged people\ndid, and a sex difference was observed as women showed more frequent reactions.\nAlthough methodological differences may explain the variation between the\npreference experiment and these observation studies, it is of primary importance to an\ninvestigation of responses to infant stimuli that we consider the human society and\ncooperative breeding system mentioned above. Differing from other primates, many\nunrelated people compose a community, and multiple in-group members, including non-kin\nindividuals, take part in child rearing. Furthermore, some biases concerning responsiveness\ntoward infants might be predicted as follows from the viewpoint of the Environment of\nEvolutionary Adaptedness (EEA). The EEA is conceptualized as the conditions\nencountered by ancestors that could impact their fitness, dictating the development of their\npsychological mechanisms (Tooby and Cosmides, 1990). Hunter-gatherer societies today\nHuman cooperative breeding\nare often referred to as examples, suggesting the sexual division of labor: men's major role\nin hunting and women's in gathering and childcare (Lancaster and Kaplan, 2009). It is\npossible that women are more responsive in the area of childcare because they were more\nlikely to be with the infants of their community than men. Although, as Maestripieri and\nPelka (2002) indicated, young girls should be motivated to learn caretaking skills, people in\nthe post-reproductive stage--especially women who are skilled--could afford to mind\nother infants. In fact, Ivey (2000) revealed that, in Ef\u00e9 foragers, people without dependent\noffspring were more likely to engage in alloparenting. These aspects may explain people's\nreactions to infants in observational studies.\nThe second psychological-proximate factor promoting a cooperative breeding\nsystem in humans is mothers' positive reactions toward individuals approaching their\ninfants. In non-cooperative breeding primates, mothers restrict other individuals' access to\ntheir infants to avoid abuse or kidnapping (Hrdy, 1976; Nicolson, 1987; Onishi and\nNakamichi, 2011). In contrast, mothers in species such as langurs, who have been seen\nalloparenting, are tolerant of others' eagerness to approach their infants; however, \"others\"\nmay be defined as kin individuals to whom mothers could commit their infants (Hrdy, 2005,\n2009). Mothers of marmosets also let other family members carry their infants (Box, 1977;\nMills, Windle, Baker, and Ridley, 2004). Differing from other apes, human mothers do\npermit others to approach or hold their infants (Hrdy, 2009). Since humans are engaged in\ncooperative breeding among various in-group members, it is expected that mothers will\nreceive interest from others positively, regardless of whether they are kin or non-kin.\nTherefore, we should explore the phenomenon of infants as attention catchers from the\nview point of mothers. In relation to this, no previous studies have addressed how mothers\nfeel when people approach them and their infants, instead focusing solely on people's\nreactions toward their infants.\nModern society is far different from the EEA. However, the human mind today\nshould show signs of traits adapted to the EEA, because their brains could not catch up\nwith the extremely changed environment. In the EEA, people would have lived mostly in\nsmall face-to-face communities (Cosmides and Tooby, 2013). On the other hand, in\nmodern society, people have the chance to see many unfamiliar people every day.\nTraditionally, in-group members are perceived positively (Brewer, 1979), whereas\nstrangers are perceived as out-group members who humans innately fear. This is the case\nfor strange males, who threatened children and adults in the evolutionary past\n(Hahn-Holbrook, Holbrook, and Bering, 2010). If modern mothers are receptive to\nstrangers who show positive response toward the mother and infants, it is unlikely that they\nperceive strangers according to the EEA. Instead, it is possible that they see these\nstrangers' approaches as a sign of potential help from in-group members, as a result of a\ndisparity between the EEA and modern society.\nIn order to investigate these two psychological factors reflected in people today, in\nthe present study we examine what kinds of people are attracted by infants in the field and\nhow mothers feel about these approaches by strangers toward them and their infants. In this\nstudy, we defined strangers' reactions as follows: their looking as attention, and their\nsmiling and talking as approaches. Baby schema (Kindchenschema), or infantile features\nsuggested by Lorenz (1943), attracts attention (Brosch, Sander, and Scherer, 2007; Brosch,\nSander, Pourtois, and Scherer, 2008) and leads to the perception of cuteness and motivation\ntoward caretaking (Glocker et al., 2009), according to visual stimulus-based experiments.\nHuman cooperative breeding\nTherefore, looking (representing attention), smiling (that occurs after looking, as a reaction\nto infants) (Hildebrandt and Fitzgerald, 1978; Schleidt et al., 1980), and talking (indicating\nactual interaction), are indicators of caretaking behavior.\nIn Study 1, we conducted field experiments to observe the reactions of passersby to\na mother and an infant. Although similar studies have been conducted in the U.S.\n(Robinson et al., 1979), and in Germany and Italy (Schleidt et al., 1980)--which reported\nthe presence of sex and age differences as women, minors, and older adults showed more\nfrequent reactions--no study seems to have examined this phenomenon in a non-Western\nculture. Japanese pedestrians were found to react less to a stranger with smiles, nods, and\ngreetings than Americans do (Patterson et al., 2007). Hence, this examination was needed\nto reveal whether the findings of Robinson et al. (1979) or Schleidt et al. (1980) were\nculturally universal or specific; in particular, smiling at or talking to a mother and an infant,\nas seen in the study of Schleidt et al. (1980).\nRobinson et al. (1979), who conducted observations with both mother-infant and\nfather-infant pairs, stated that a replication of their study 20 years later might yield different\nresults due to changes of opinion on traditional sex roles. However, no replication has yet\nbeen conducted in the more than 30 years since their study, with the exception of Schleidt\net al.'s (1980) study, which was undertaken independently at the same time. Although the\npresent study was conducted with only mother-infant pairs, this is a replication in a\ndifferent culture and time from previous studies.\nIn Study 2, we used questionnaires and interviews presenting a hypothetical\nscenario to mothers with infants in order to examine how they feel when a stranger\napproaches them. Cooperative breeding systems should require a mother's permission for\nan individual to approach their infant. In fact, mothers in cooperative breeding species are\ntolerant toward potential helpers to handle the infants (Hrdy, 2009). Potential helpers in\nhumans of in-group members include non-kin individuals (Kramer, 2010). In\nhunter-gatherer societies, mothers let anyone come near or hold their baby (Hrdy, 2009). If\nmothers show their tolerance to certain individuals, this would indicate that mothers\nrecognize them as potential helpers. Emotions adjust physiological, psychological, and\nbehavioral responses (Nesse, 1990); subsequently, mothers' feelings predict whether\npermissive behavior can follow.\nStudy 1: Observation\nStudy 1 was conducted to observe and examine the characteristics of those\npassersby who reacted to the mother and infant in the field experiment. We expected that\nour results would ascertain the kinds of people who are likely to take part in cooperative\nbreeding, replicating the results of prior studies (Robinson et al., 1979; Schleidt et al.,\n1980). Therefore, the first hypothesis was that female passersby would react more than\nmale passersby to the mother and infant. The second hypothesis was that minors and older\nadults would react more than middle-aged people would.\nMaterials and Methods\nConfederates\nEleven pairs of mothers (28\u00ad35 years old) and their infants (4 boys and 7 girls;\nHuman cooperative breeding\n5\u00ad25 months old) served as confederates. We recruited the confederates through\nacquaintances. Each mother confederate was instructed in advance on how to behave\nduring the experiment (See Procedure).\nThis study was approved by the psychological research ethics committees at the\nCollege of Contemporary Psychology of Rikkyo University. We obtained prior consent and\nparental consent from all confederates.\nSetting\nThe experiments were conducted at five 4\u00ad7 meter-wide sidewalk locations in\nTokyo and Saitama prefectures. These locations were selected based on confederates'\nresidences. Observations were carried out during the day on sunny or cloudy days between\nJuly and November 2012. The temperature ranged from 8\u00ad30 \u00b0C during the observations.\nParticipants\nIndividuals passing the sidewalk observation points were regarded as participants.\nParticipants were restricted to those walking in the direction with heavier traffic at the\nbeginning of each experiment. When many individuals passed the observation point\nsimultaneously, the nearest pedestrian to the confederates was designated as the participant.\nPeople who were running, wearing sunglasses, a mask, or a sun visor were excluded as\nparticipants, as were infants being held or pushed in strollers. Individuals who talked to a\nconfederate were added as participants unless they were existing participants' companions.\nProcedure\nEach pair of confederates spent 30 minutes in the experiment. Additionally, mother\nconfederates spent 30 minutes alone for the baseline measurement. The two conditions\nwere conducted in randomized order. Details of the experiments are illustrated in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Illustration of Study 1 procedure\nNote: When both the mother and the infant confederates sat on the bench, the mother sat behind the infant\nto be seen from the direction the observation was being conducted. The observer was 1.5\u00ad4 m in front of\nthe confederates in the direction of the participants passing through. She began to observe the participant\nfrom the time he or she reached 2 m before the confederates and stopped when the participant passed the\nconfederates.\nConfederates remained at the observation point beside the sidewalk. If the infant\nleft the observation point, observation was suspended, and the mother confederate\nHuman cooperative breeding\nreclaimed the infant without force. In the event that the infant left and remained at other\nlocations near the sidewalk, the observation was resumed at that location. The mother\nconfederates were instructed to behave naturally in both conditions and to maintain a free\nphysical posture, such as sitting on a bench or standing by the sidewalk. If the infant could\nnot yet walk unassisted, the confederate could choose to hold the infant in her arms or place\nhim or her in a stroller. When both the mother and the infant sat on the bench, the mother\nsat behind the infant so that it could be seen from the direction from which the observation\nwas being conducted. The confederates were allowed to read books, eat, drink, use mobile\nphones except to make a call, and play with toys that were unlikely to attract attention.\nThey were instructed to behave as usual when a participant talked to them and not to talk\nuntil they were spoken to.\nTraffic dropped remarkably during the mother-and-infant condition for one pair of\nconfederates shortly after the experiment began. Observation was suspended 15 minutes\nafter the start time and resumed at another location, where the remainder of the mother and\ninfant period and the full baseline observation were carried out.\nThe observer was 1.5\u00ad4 m in front of the confederates in the direction of\nparticipants passing through. She began to observe the participant from the time he or she\nreached 2 m before the confederates and stopped when the participant passed the\nconfederates, then recorded the content of the observation on a data sheet within 5 s.\nThe data recorded included the participants' characteristics and observed reactions\nto the confederates. Participant characteristics recorded were sex and age group. We\nestimated the age group in the following five groups from the perspective of life history,\nreferring to a 2012 children and childcare white paper (Cabinet office, Government of\nwere recorded according to three categories--looking, smiling, and talking--which were\nused by the replicated study (Schleidt et al., 1980). \"Looking\" was defined as looking at the\nconfederates for at least 2 s, referring to the study of Robinson et al. (1979), although\nlooking was treated as gazing for even less than 2 s in the study of Schleidt et al. (1980),\nwho used a video camera to record. \"Smiling\" was defined as looking and smiling.\nIn order to verify inter-rater reliability, Cohen's kappa coefficients (Cohen, 1960)\nwere calculated for three sets of observations conducted by two independent observers.\nPrior to the experiments, the observers practiced with and without a confederate (female\nundergraduate student), in particular for the accurate estimation of age group and presence\nof looking by passersby. Kappa coefficients of the three set of observations were .77 for\nage group, .62 for looking, and .82 for smiling at the confederates. Values of .61 or more\nare significant Kappa coefficient (Landis and Koch, 1977). Therefore, the estimations were\nregarded as reliable, despite the use of constructed age groups, as opposed to real ones.\nMother confederates were given a checklist and asked that when they were talked to\nduring the experiment, to check off items on the list to record what they talked about. The\nlist items were as follows: (a) about the infant confederate, (b) about the mother\nconfederate, (c) about the participant's child or grandchild, (d) greetings, and (e) other\ntopics. The mother confederates were directed to classify statements, such as \"He is cute\"\nor \"How old is he?\" as talk about the infant confederates; a topic like childcare would\npertain to the mother confederates. The checklist included space for each item to record\nwhether the mother or the infant confederate was addressed. The mother confederates were\nHuman cooperative breeding\nalso asked to record the sex of the participant who talked to them in order to identify the\nparticipant recorded by the observer.\nResults\nThe number of participants in each trial ranged from 14 to 99. In our analysis, all 11\nsets of data were integrated into the data for either the mother-and-infant condition or the\nbaseline. Although 951 people were observed across trials, 14 were excluded from the\nanalysis because of operational errors. The final total number of participants was 937 (490\nin the mother-and-infant condition and 447 in the baseline). Details of the participants and\ntheir observed reactions are shown in Table 1. Almost all the participants were judged as\nJapanese; approximately 2% appeared to be non-Japanese, but these did not exhibit any\nobserved reaction.\nTable 1.

We applied the statistical analysis only to the\nmother-and-infant condition.\nUsing the \"Anova\" function of the R-package \"car\" (Fox and Weisberg, 2011), we\napplied a likelihood ratio test. The interaction of sex and age groups had no significant\neffect on looking, 2(4) = 8.28, p = .08. In the model excluding interaction, sex did not have\npercentages of each category classified by sex and age group are illustrated in Figure 2.\nHuman cooperative breeding\nFigure 2.

A\nlikelihood ratio test indicated that there were no significant effect on sex, nor was there a significant\ninteraction on sex and age group. Age group had a significant effect.\nFor smiling, we examined the data of participants who looked at the confederates (n\n= 81). The data showed that 17 participants smiled at confederates. The interaction of sex\nand age group had no significant effect, 2(3) = 5.39, p = .15. In the model excluding\ninteraction, sex had a significant effect, 2(1) = 4.47, p < .05, indicating that women smiled\nmore often than men. However, age groups did not have a significant effect, 2(4) = 1.97, p\nTalking was observed in only six cases in the mother-and-infant condition. This\ncategory was not examined with a statistical test because of the small number of\nobservations. Table 2 shows participants' characteristics and the type of talk recorded by\nthe mother confederates. The participant in case 1 was accompanied by an infant. In case 5,\nthe participant was accompanied by three men who appeared to be in the same age group as\nthe participant (19\u00ad29). Two of the three companions (companion A and companion B)\nalso talked to the confederates. Companion A greeted the infant and talked to the mother\nconfederate about the infant and the confederate herself. Companion B talked to the mother\nconfederate about the infant and greeted the infant.\nHuman cooperative breeding\nTable 2.

The feelings\nwere rated on a scale ranging from pleasant to unpleasant. The scenarios of Study 2-1 were\ncomposed of three conditions--Alone, With-Another-Adult, and With-Own-Infant--so\nthat we could compare mothers' feelings according to the conditions and examine the\ninfluence of the infant's presence. In Study 2-2, a semi-structured interview was conducted\nwith participants independent of the questionnaire. In the interview, we asked participants\nabout their feelings in the above situations and related items and classified the answers.\nStudy 2-1: Questionnaire\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nWe distributed the questionnaire to 40 mothers living in Tokyo who had children\nrange: 29\u00ad45 years, SD: 4.27). The participants were those of an unrelated study in the area\nof developmental psychology. Participants expressed their interest in response to notices on\nbulletin boards at places frequented by children or families in Tokyo.\nThis study was approved by the psychological research ethics committees at the\nCollege of Contemporary Psychology of Rikkyo University.\nHuman cooperative breeding\nProcedure\nThere were six questions for the hypothetical scenario: 3 (condition: Alone,\nWith-Another-Adult, With-Own-Infant) \u00d7 2 (type of reaction by strangers: Smiled-At,\nTalked-To). For example, \"How do you feel about being smiled at by a stranger when you\nare out alone?\" The full form of the questionnaire is shown in Appendix 1.\nThe participant was asked to choose an answer for each question from 1\n(unpleasant) to 5 (pleasant).\nResults\nAn analysis of variance (ANOVA, using SPSS version 20) showed a significant\ncomparisons indicated that the With-Own-Infant condition scored higher than the Alone or\nWith-Another-Adult conditions at the 0.1% level; no significant difference was found\nbetween the Alone and With-Another-Adult conditions.

An additional three mothers were recruited specifically for Study\n2-2 through acquaintances. Their ages ranged from 28 to 40, and they lived in Tokyo,\nKanagawa, and Saitama prefectures.\nThis study was approved by the psychological research ethics committees at the\nCollege of Contemporary Psychology at Rikkyo University. Prior consent was obtained\nfrom the participants.\nProcedure\nThe interview was conducted in a semi-structured form in which participants talked\nfreely about each question. The interview was recorded by a SD card recorder (ZOOM H2\nHandy Recorder) and transcribed. Interviews for the eight mothers who participated in\nStudy 2-2 were conducted after Study 1.\nThe interview questions were as follows:\n(1) How do you feel about being smiled at/talked to by a stranger when you\nare out alone, with another adult, or with your infant, and why do you feel\nthat way?\n(2) Do you recognize changes in such feelings compared to the days before\nchildbirth?\n(3) For the mothers who participated in Study 1 and were talked to during the\nexperiment: How did you feel at that time, and why did you feel that\nway?\nAnalysis\nAnswers to questions (1) and (3) were classified as Negative, Neutral, or Positive,\nand answers to question (2) were classified as Change into Negative, Neutral, or Positive.\nThese classifications were performed by the first author and another independently with a\nKappa coefficient of .77; the first author's data were used.\nResults\nTable 3 shows the classifications of feelings about approaches from strangers,\nrecognized changes since childbirth, and feelings about being talked to during the\nexperiments as answered by the five mother confederates who were talked to in Study 1.\nThe numbers in parentheses on the table represent the number of answers by confederates\nof Study 1.

Regarding the Talked-To reaction, again Positive\nwas the most frequent answer only in the With-Own-Infant condition, although this\ncondition showed fewer Positive answers compared to the Smiled-At reaction.\nRegarding changes in feelings recognized since childbirth, many answers were in\nChange into Positive, but there were a few answers in Change into Negative, which\nHuman cooperative breeding\nmentioned wariness about harm to her infant.\nMost answers concerning feelings about having been talked to during the\nexperiments were classified as Positive; no answer was Negative.\nDiscussion\nThe present study was conducted on the two psychological factors which would\nmaintain a human cooperative breeding system; we examined what kinds of people reacted\nto an infant (Study 1) and how mothers felt about approaches by strangers toward\nthemselves and their infants (Study 2). For Study 1, from the perspective of the EEA and\nbased on prior studies, we predicted that women would react more than men to the mother\nand infant and that minors and older adults would react more than middle-aged people. The\nresults of Study 1 confirmed the differences in frequency of looking at the mother and\ninfant among age groups as hypothesized and, therefore, predicted the universal\ndistribution of attention toward an infant according to age regardless of culture and time.\nHowever, there was no indication of difference according to sex. The results for smiling\nwere reversed: The difference was found by sex but not by age. From Study 2, which used\na hypothetical scenario, we found that mothers are receptive to strangers' interest in their\ninfants. This could mean that they see interest as an indication of potential helpers in that of\nin-group members.\nThe results of Study 1 showed that, with respect to sex difference, there was no\nsignificant effect on looking, but there was an effect on smiling. Therefore, in this study,\nthe sex difference could occur in how to behave after attention is attracted; women tend to\nsmile more when they perceive an infant. This result is consistent with the result of facial\nmuscle activity after presentation of infant face photographs (Hildebrandt and Fitzgerald,\n1978). For talking, three of six cases were initiated by adult men. In particular, case 5\noccurred with a group composed entirely of young adult men. Although the sample size\nwas too small to be discussed, a man's approach toward an infant is worth considering.\nIn substantial contrast to caretaking behavior, Hiraiwa-Hasegawa (2005) reported\nthat the homicide rate in Japan has decreased drastically; in particular, a huge decrease has\nbeen seen in the rate of homicides committed by young men. The homicide rate in Japan is\ncurrently the lowest level in the world (UNODC, 2013). This tendency may be associated\nwith Japanese men showing more positive reactions to infants than men in other countries,\nand may be explained by a proximate factor of testosterone, since testosterone level is\nrelated to patterns of crime (Dabbs, Carr, Frady, and Riad, 1995; Dabbs, Riad, and Chance,\n2001) and parental care (Gettler, McDade, Feranil, and Kuzawa, 2011; Gray, Kahlenberg,\nRegarding the change in values over time, gender roles in Japan seem to be unclear,\nwhere childcare provided by men has become socially acceptable. Globalization and\nWesternization have encouraged egalitarian views in childrearing, leading many Japanese\nmen to value family life (Shwalb and Shwalb, 2014). Although no similar study has been\nconducted, notions around gender roles in Japan have certainly changed in the 30 years\nsince Robinson et al. (1979) and Schleidt et al. (1980) carried out their research. These\nfactors that are derived from culture and time influence the attitudes of men in present-day\nJapan.\nThe hypothesis of differences among age groups was supported in looking:\nHuman cooperative breeding\nParticipants under 12 and over 50 years old looked more often than other age groups.\nPractically, the ages of most observed participants in the under-12 age group were\nestimated to be around the age of infant confederates or a little older. Therefore, a high\nfrequency of looking in this age group would not be associated with caretaking behavior\nbut rather with friendship.\nThe essential point of Study 1 should be increased looking in the over-50 age group,\nparallel to previous studies and, therefore, a robust indication of the tendency. Robinson et\nal. (1979) interpreted the phenomenon from the perspective of kin selection: Interest in an\ninfant could increase in aged people associated with their grandchildren. This phenomenon\nseems to be consistent with the results of Feldman and Nash's (1979b) observation that\ngrandparents exhibited more interest in an infant than did people who did not yet have\ngrandchildren, and that grandmothers reacted to an infant more often than grandfathers did.\nThe grandmother hypothesis (Hawkes et al., 1998) may also lie with their interpretation.\nHowever, the explanation by kin selection for these phenomena cannot answer why older\npeople's attention is attracted to an unfamiliar and, thus, presumed non-kin infant.\nIt would be effective to consider the features of humans' life history, society, and\ncooperative breeding to comprehend the results of Study 1. Humans have a long life span,\nwhich includes a long post-reproductive stage in women (Hawkes, O'Connell, Jones,\nAlvarez, and Charnov, 1998). Their society includes many unrelated members, so some\ncognitive features cannot be explained by ancestral environments based on kinship (Hill et\nal., 2011). Multiple individuals contribute to childcare (Kramer, 2010). When considering\nthe likelihood of alloparenting, people in stages other than reproductive could afford to pay\nattention to infants who were not their own. Moreover, people who would usually be with\ninfants of their community could likely be responsive to infants; these tendencies might be\napplicable to women, as we predicted. There is a question regarding the increased looking\nof older adult men in the present study. Studies of traditional societies suggest that older\nadult men do not necessarily contribute to alloparenting, even of their grandchildren (Hrdy,\nphenomenon should be further examined in both men and women.\nAge groups did not have a significant effect on smiling in this study. As a limitation\nof the present study, the sample size was small compared to previous studies, and the\nnumber of participants in each age group varied widely. Smiling was analyzed in\nparticipants whose looking was observed, so the sample size was further reduced (to only\n17). These factors could influence the results. The present study is comparable to previous\nstudies that use the observation of passersby, where the characteristics of the sample can be\nseen as largely equivalent, excluding differences in culture and time. The present study\nshowed different results from that of Schleidt et al. (1980) with respect to the absence of a\nsignificant effect of smiling by age group. Although this discrepancy could be the result of\ndifferences across culture and time, small sample size also could also be an issue.\nThe experiments were conducted in Tokyo and surrounding areas because of the\nresidential location of confederates. This is a limitation to the representativeness of results,\nwhere results may be biased toward certain characteristics of participants and may not be\ngeneralized to the rest of Japan. Despite this, it can be said that we observed typical people\nwho live in an urban area in Japan, though we were unable to observe people who live in\nrural areas.\nStudy 2-1 indicated that the With-Own-Infant condition scored significantly higher\nHuman cooperative breeding\non the pleasantness scale for a stranger's approach than the Alone or With-Another-Adult\nconditions. Regarding the type of reaction by strangers, the Talked-To reaction scored\nsignificantly lower on the pleasantness scale than the Smiled-At one. A similar result was\nobtained from Study 2-2; the positive feeling was the mode only in the With-Own-Infant\ncondition both for the Smiled-At and the Talked-To reactions, although in the Talked-To\nreaction, positive answers were fewer than in the Smiled-At one. These findings of Studies\n2-1 and 2-2 were intended to be parallel, so we will discuss the results of the questionnaire\nand interviews based on the words and sentences used in the interviews as follows (See\nAppendix 2).\nOriginally, humans innately feared strangers, especially males, who threatened\nchildren and adults in the evolutionary past. As a result, modern adults continue to show\nnegative emotions toward them, despite the evidence that strangers are no longer dangerous\n(Hahn-Holbrook et al., 2010). Fessler, Holbrook, Pollack, and Hahn-Holbrook (2014)\nshowed contrary findings to the present study. Parents estimated a stranger to be more\nformidable than non-parents, perhaps because parental injury reduces their fitness,\nsubsequently risking the fitness of their children. The results of the present study showed a\nlittle support for the concern of mothers toward strangers. Some words implying caution\nwere used during interviews when the participants were discussing the With-Own-Infant\ncondition. Increased wariness was also mentioned in answers to questions about changes\nsince childbirth.\nAlthough it is natural that mothers pay attention to the safety of their infants, Hrdy\n(2009) described human mothers as hyper-vigilant but not hyper-possessive. Study 2\nindicated many mothers perceive strangers' approaches positively. In Study 2-2, even the\nparticipant who was the confederate in Study 1 and had been talked to by young men (case\n5) answered positively. The results of Study 2 need particular explanation, as they ignore\nprevious findings that strangers are perceived as out-group members (Hahn-Holbrook et al.,\n2010) and, usually, in-group members are perceived positively (Brewer, 1979). Many\nmothers in the present study received a stranger's approach favorably when they imagined\nthey were accompanied by their infant. One of the explanations for this phenomenon could\nbe that they perceive strangers, who show positive reactions toward them and their infants,\nas a sign of potential in-group members who can help them.\nAlthough our hypothetical scenario included the situation of being talked to by a\nstranger, the results of Study 1 showed talking to confederates rarely occurred in realistic\nsituations (similar to the study of Schleidt et al., 1980). We conducted Study 1 to replicate\nprevious studies, using a similar study design. This study focused on just one chance of\nindividuals passing through. However, there are a range of situations that can occur in real\nlife where contact with strangers is possible, such as being in a supermarket, an elevator, or\na waiting room of a clinic. The likelihood of talking to mothers and their infants could be\ndifferent in such cases. The hypothetical scenarios of Study 2 were made quite vague\n(\"when you are out\"), which were not the same as the situation of Study 1. In this case,\nmothers could imagine situations where they would be likely to be talked to by strangers.\nThis ambiguity in the hypothetical scenarios, of course, also acts as a limitation of\nStudy 2. The type of stranger, according to sex, age and so on, could influence mothers'\nacceptance of their approaches. As mentioned above, male strangers were likely to be\ndangerous in an evolutionary context (Hahn-Holbrook et al., 2010). Additionally,\nparticipants in the present study were living in Tokyo (an urban area). Therefore, for a\nHuman cooperative breeding\nresident area of the participants there could be some biases. Different results could be\nyielded in rural areas, where the meaning of a stranger would be more similar to that in the\nEEA due to the face-to-face nature of the community.\nIn conclusion, Study 1 suggests a human universal and unique distribution of\nattention toward infants with the rise in older adults. Study 2 showed that mothers received\nstrangers' approaches positively. The results of Study 1 reflect the environment where\nhumans have evolved to attend to and care for their infants. The results of Study 2,\nhowever, suggest that mothers are receptive to strangers' approaches, which would be\nunlikely to occur in the EEA. This can be explained by the tendency of modern mothers to\nperceive strangers as potential helpers. This is seen as a feature of cooperative breeding,\nwhere humans rear children with various in-group members.\n"
