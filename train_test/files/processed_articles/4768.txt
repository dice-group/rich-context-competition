At the time\nof this evaluation, the program had graduated 104 young\nleaders from five different program cohorts. By the end of\nthe current funding that was available, seven cohorts or a\ntotal of 149 participants had participated in the program.\nResources for Results, an independent evaluation firm,\nwas contracted by UWT in November 2012 to design and\nimplement an evaluation of the CITY Leaders program and\nto create an evidence base on which to assess the results of\nthe first 5 years of leadership programming. The purpose of\nthe evaluation was to\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Examine a range of outcomes for CITY Leaders\nparticipants\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Understand the contribution of various components to\nprogram outcomes\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Explore how participants' characteristics and context\naffect outcomes\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Reflect on the effectiveness of the multi-stakeholder\npartnership\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Increase understanding of what role and value gradu-\nates place on an ongoing formal CITY Leaders net-\nworking function.\nAlthough leadership development programs are abundant\nin both the United States and Canada, there is a noticeable\nabsence of evaluations that have assessed the mid- and long-\nterm outcomes and impact of these programs (Russon &\nReinelt, 2004), including the lack of appropriate measure-\nment instruments (Black & Earnest, 2009). It is anticipated\nthat this evaluation will contribute important new evidence\nregarding outcomes and learning about effective practices in\nleadership development. The evaluation was also well timed\nto coincide with two strategic reviews at UWT examining\nthe organization's priorities for youth programming and\ncapacity building into the future.\n1University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n2Resources for Results, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nWes Shera, Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work, University of\nToronto, 246 Bloor Street, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 1A1.\nEmail: wes.shera@utoronto.ca\nCITY Leaders: Building Youth\nLeadership in Toronto\nWes Shera1 and Janet M. Murray2\n Keywords\nleadership education, youth, impact, diversity\n2 SAGE Open\nCITY Leaders History\nFor well over a decade, UWT has made a sustained invest-\nment in leadership development. Guided by strong evidence\nthat organizational effectiveness depends on the availability\nof highly capable leaders, UWT launched two leadership\nprograms: The Emerging Leaders Program focused on\nsocial-sector managers and the Leaders of Today Program\nfocused on Executive Directors. At the time, however, few\nleadership development programs in Toronto focused on\nyouth, and none was designed to open doors for low-income\nand racialized youth (Erbstein, 2013). Through its youth\ndevelopment programming, UWT identified the need for\nyouth leadership development to engage diverse youth from\nacross Toronto in the social sector and to provide a \"pipe-\nline\" of young leaders to support succession planning as\nbaby boomer managers retired.\nThere was a growing awareness that the social sector\nmust work differently with youth, and extensive efforts were\nmade to engage and consult young people from Toronto's 13\npriority, \"marginalized\" neighborhoods about their learning\nneeds and program design preferences. A Learning Partners\nConsortium was organized in 2008 to engage thought leaders\nin the field of leadership development in the design and\ndevelopment of CITY Leaders. As part of this initial design\nprocess, an extensive review of the literature on the design of\nyouth leadership development programs was completed\nfirst two social service-sector cohorts went ahead in quick\nsuccession with UWT as sole funder. The core offerings of\nCITY Leaders included an intensive program of educational\nsessions, mentorship, group-based applied learning projects,\nand an online networking platform. This design has evolved\nover time through formative evaluation, curriculum review,\nand participant feedback.\nAfter the first cohort went through the program in 2008,\nCITY Leaders partnered with the FIFSW at the University of\nToronto to improve program design, co-deliver, and co-\ncertify the CITY Leaders program. In 2009, the YCF came\non board as a funder, promoting a new neighborhood cohort\nto enhance the important work that UWT was already doing\nto promote leadership capabilities and opportunities for\nracialized and African diasporic youth from Toronto's most\nmarginalized neighborhoods. Additional collaborators and\ncontributors, to both the design and delivery of the program,\nincluded the International Center for Studies in Creativity;\nThe Shambhala Institute for Authentic Leadership; The\nCentre for Social Innovation (CSI); the Schulich School of\nBusiness, York University; Laidlaw Foundation; Toronto\nCity Summit Alliance; The Ontario Council of Agencies\nServing Immigrants; Maytree Foundation; the Anti-Racism\nand Cultural Diversity Office, University of Toronto; and the\nMetcalf Foundation. In 2009, an Advisory Council was also\ncreated to ensure ongoing quality and growth of the program.\nThe Council is composed of members from the Faculty of\nSocial Work, graduates of CITY Leaders, private-sector\nadvisors, and UWT staff.\nRelevant Literature\nBuilding on the extensive literature review that was previ-\nously done during the initial design of the program, a further\nreview was completed to identify core resources on leader-\nship program design and to identify lessons learned from\nprevious efforts to evaluate leadership development pro-\ngrams (Dugan, Turman, & Torrez, 2015; Russon & Reinelt,\n2004). This review set the stage for the evaluation, laying out\nsome basic definitions, identifying design elements, noting\neffective practices, and exploring theories of change that\ncould support the design of the CITY Leaders outcomes\nevaluation.\nThe literature revealed consensus that conceptions of\nleadership in the social sector have shifted away from tradi-\ntional, top-down ideas of individual leadership, which are\nnow seen as being ineffective in our increasingly diverse and\nLeadership is now conceived of as a more flexible, collab-\norative, democratic process that can come from a range of\nlevels and locations in a community or organization.\nCollective leadership is based on the premise that leadership is\nthe product of groups rather than individuals . . . where collective\nleadership works best is in complex and messy situations that\ndon't lend themselves to easy answers--precisely the kind of\nsituations the nonprofit sector confronts every day. (Hubbard,\nEmotional and social intelligence (Goleman, 2000) and\ncritical self-reflection (Torrez & Rocco, 2015) are also\nincreasingly seen as critical to effective leadership--\nemployers seek employees who have strong social skills,\nself-discipline in work habits, cooperative abilities, and a\nmotivation for continuous learning on the job (Rosch &\nVillanueva, 2016). Much of the current leadership literature\nconcludes that the process of leadership development is more\nimportant than the actual content (Kress, 2006; Valorose,\n2015). Although leadership development necessarily aims to\ncultivate new kinds of thinking and acting in individuals,\nleadership cannot be taught in a traditional way (Ritch &\nMengel, 2009). Leadership education must create an envi-\nronment that facilitates collaboration, analysis of issues, self-\nawareness, professional skills and capacities, and exploration\nof new leadership approaches and behaviors (Doherty, 2003).\nIn terms of youth development, Max Klau (2006)\naddresses two critical questions: \"What conceptions of lead-\nership inform the work of youth leadership educators in the\nfield today? What pedagogical techniques are employed by\nprograms to teach the model of leadership they espouse?\"\n(p. 58). These questions are based on insights and research\nShera and Murray 3\nby authors such as Roach et al. (1999), who claim that many\nyouth leadership programs are derived from adult theories of\nleadership and do not take into account the everyday or natu-\nral processes and situations that enable youth, particularly\nthose in at-risk environments, to emerge as leaders. New\nforms of leadership development emphasize participation,\ndistribution of knowledge, systems thinking, teamwork, and\ncommunities of learning and practice (Browne & Campione,\nyouth leadership development should emphasize experien-\ntial learning and focus on the whole person within his or her\ncontext and not simply on one issue or problem or one set of\nskills.\nGrantmakers for Effective Organizations (GEO) in the\nUnited States conducted research into community leadership\ndevelopment that remains highly influential and relevant\ntoday (Enright, 2006). This study affirmed the direct connec-\ntion between strong organizational leadership and program\nresults and suggests that leadership development interven-\ntions can be intentionally designed to promote long-term\ncommunity impacts. They argue that leadership program\ninterventions are most effective when they are (a) collective,\n(b) contextual, and (c) continuous.\nCollective\nParticipatory leadership development strategies that build\nstrong relationships among individuals, organizations, and\nnetworks are very effective in producing long-term out-\ncomes. Relationship building is core to leadership develop-\nment, supporting peer-based observational learning, where\nparticipants learn from each other by modeling and imitating\nnew behaviors that they have observed (Bandura, 1986).\nEffective program practices in this area include activities\nsuch as peer-to-peer learning, network development, collab-\norative problem solving, building sector awareness, and col-\nlective advocacy work. Broad-based community involvement\nis also important in producing community results in social-\nsector leadership development programs (Dugan et al., 2015;\nHubbard, 2006). Active engagement of the target community\nin needs assessment, identification of core values, planning,\nimplementation, and evaluation ensure that the impacts of\nthe program affect both the youth and the communities in\nwhich they live.\nContextual\nLeadership development should be relevant and grounded in\nthe context within which its participants are working. It must\nrespond to the day-to-day problems that leaders face. For this\nreason, it is important to design leadership development pro-\ncesses that are respectful and consultative, authentically\naddressing youth issues and experience (Enright, 2006).\nYouth led processes contribute to the relevance and\neffectiveness of leadership programs. GEO suggests that\nlearning should be customized and personally relevant to\nparticipants. Effective practices in this area include building\ncollective knowledge and a process for examining pertinent\nissues facing participants' communities, increasing self-\nawareness, engaging participants in meaningful services to\nthe community, and organizing forums and learning groups\nfocused on practical problem solving based on actual cases\nfrom participants' working lives (Doherty, 2003; Dugan\nContinuous\nOften leadership programs are not designed to support people\nto apply new learning and sustain it through their ongoing\nwork with organizations and communities. New perspectives\nand behaviors are less likely to take hold when a person must\napply them alone, without peer support or consultation.\nCustomized, one-to-one coaching is increasingly being used\nin leadership programs to deepen the self-reflection compo-\nnent of leadership programs and promote behavioral change.\nEffective practices in this area include individualized coach-\ning as a follow-up strategy to provide support for ongoing\ndevelopment and monitoring of personal and professional\nchange and the use of peer groups to provide support and\nsolve complex problems and issues (Enright, 2006; Ritch &\nIn terms of insights from the limited number of systematic\nevaluations that have been conducted on leadership develop-\nment programs, a number of themes have emerged including\nthe difficulty encountered in contacting the alumni of a pro-\ngram, the importance of collecting both quantitative and\nqualitative data, the use of multiple methods to triangulate\ndata, the need to focus on capturing process and individual\ndifferences, and the need to capture both perceptual and fac-\ntual evidence related to outcomes and impact (Black &\nValorose, 2015). Of particular relevance to the current study\nis Pratt, McGuigan, and Katzev's (2000) assertion that retro-\nspective designs produce a more legitimate assessment of\nleadership program outcomes than traditional pretest\u00adpost-\ntest methodology since many programs evolve over time, a\nprocess often described as adaptive implementation (Metz &\nthat can be used to enhance the memories of those complet-\ning retrospective questionnaires such as the detailed cohort\nspecific descriptions of the program that were given to\nrespondents in the evaluation of the CITY Leaders program.\nProgram Overview\nCITY Leaders has evolved over the years in its targeting,\nobjectives, program design, and content. Much of this evolu-\ntion is the result of a consultative, continuous improvement\n4 SAGE Open\napproach that has been implemented through evaluation\nactivities and active engagement of staff and partners in pro-\ngram refinement. In 2009, UWT evaluation staff worked to\nfurther consolidate the model, developing a logic model and\nlearning objectives for CITY Leaders, increasing the connec-\ntions between program themes and content to strengthen pro-\ngram outcomes.\nCITY Leaders was designed to focus at the individual\nlevel, developing the capacity of young leaders to contribute\neffectively to the priorities of their organizations and com-\nmunities. The objectives during the first 3 years of CITY\nLeaders focused on individual-level outcomes, with more\nemphasis on personal and professional development. By\nCohort 5 in 2011, the objectives had been revised and refo-\ncused; they expressed more explicit expectations of improved\nindividual capacity to effect change at the organizational,\nsectoral, and policy levels.\nThe Cohorts\nCITY Leaders in the sectoral cohorts were diverse young\nwere already working for social service and other commu-\nnity-based organizations delivering programs and services in\nToronto's inner-city and inner-suburban neighborhoods.\nMany of these young professionals already had a solid base\nof capacity in organizational management and program\ndelivery. Many had completed a post-secondary college\ndiploma or university degree. The cohorts in the program\nsectoral cohorts since then.\nCITY Leaders in the neighborhood cohorts were selected\nfrom racialized young community volunteers and activists\nhoods. These young leaders were already actively engaged\nin organizing youth and supporting youth programming in\ntheir own communities and may already have been working\nfor a community-based agency. This group was on average\nyounger than sectoral cohort participants and had less for-\nmal education.\nOverview of Program Components\nThe basic program consisted of a set of educational modules\n(half, full, and two-day sessions) and other activities such as\nmentoring and community-based social action projects. The\nmajor components of the CITY Leaders program included\nthe following:\nOpening retreat. This component has been facilitated over a\nweekend in a residential learning environment. The empha-\nsis is on personal reflection, team building, introducing the\nidea of leadership, and creating a strong foundation and cul-\nture for peer learning.\nA program of educational sessions. Offering core and elective\nmodules in collaboration with guest instructors from a vari-\nety of high-profile community, academic, and social ser-\nvice organizations. The format for these modules varied\nfrom half-day educational sessions to 2-day intensive\nworkshops.\nCertification. By the second cohort (2009), UWT formed a\npartnership with the University of Toronto's FIFSW and\nbegan granting certificates for successful program comple-\ntion. As a result, regular attendance, completion of assign-\nments, and make-up work requirements became more\nimportant.\nCoordinators anchor the program.The UWT program staff\nplayed a proactive role in planning and organizing each ses-\nsion, identifying instructors and working together with them\nto ensure that the proposed session fitted with the identified\nlearning objectives, that the facilitation and materials were\nwell adapted to the learning styles and needs of participants,\nand that each session was coordinated with the sessions\nalready facilitated. Staff also provided an \"anchor\" relation-\nship for participants, assisting them to participate and benefit\nfrom the program.\nMentoring. The program mobilized senior professionals from\na range of sectors and professions to be matched with partici-\npants to provide customized, ongoing counseling, career\nadvice, and access to new networks.\nApplied, group learning projects.Participants collaborated to\nidentify and complete a practical project using their new\nknowledge and theory and connecting back to the commu-\nnity and/or the social sector. Financial support of CAD\n$1,000 was made available to each project team to support\nthe implementation of their project.\nOnline platform. A proprietary Internet-based social network-\ning platform was developed by UWT as an exclusive space\nfor participants to pursue discussion, share resources, facili-\ntate networking opportunities, and provide an ongoing forum\nfor formative evaluation of the program.\nClosing retreat.\ndesigned to provide closure to the CITY Leaders' program,\naffirming the learning of participants and promoting the\nlong-term relationship and networking of each cohort into\nthe future.\nGraduation. A ceremony organized and attended by funders,\npeers, and colleagues. It is at this session that participants\nmade a presentation of their community-based social\naction/advocacy projects and received feedback on their\nwork.\nShera and Murray 5\nSome of the key changes in the program over the years\nhave included improvements to outreach, recruitment, and\nselection; revision of program structure and content, resulting\nin the creation of core and elective modules; selection of more\ndiverse instructors; engagement of alumni in the program; and\nrevision of the mentorship component of the program design.\nEvaluation Methodology\nAn Advisory Group with representatives from the two core\nprogram partners worked closely with the evaluator to guide\nevaluation design and implementation. The partners were\ninterested in documenting the outcomes of CITY Leaders and\nreviewing the effectiveness of different components of the\nprogram in bringing about leadership outcomes. They were\nalso keen to assess the merit of providing further support to\nleverage the program's alumni network, to continue to pro-\nmote leadership development beyond graduation. Although\ndemographic information about participants was available,\nthere was no baseline information benchmarking participants'\nleadership knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. It was decided\nto engage 5 years of participants in a self-reported assessment\nof outcomes related to learning, personal growth, professional\ndevelopment, and community engagement (Pratt et al., 2000).\nThe evaluation design used multiple methods of inquiry, to\noptimize triangulation of the data to ensure a higher degree of\nreliability of the findings (Greene, Caracelli, & Graham,\n1. an extensive document review of the program's chro-\nnology, reports, plans, selection criteria, participant\nbiographies, demographics, and previous evaluations;\n2. an online survey of CITY Leaders Participant\nOutcomes--based on the Leadership Program\nOutcomes Measure (Black & Earnest, 2009);\n3. telephone and in-person interviews with 23 key\ninformants including past participants (graduates),\nmentors, partners, staff, and other community\nstakeholders;\n4. two additional online surveys: one for mentors and\none for instructors;\n5. a \"mini-scan\" of leadership development in Toronto,\nkey informant interviews with six managers of other\nleadership development programs and networks\nacross Toronto.\nThe online survey of program alumni was the centerpiece\nof the evaluation and essentially followed the principles and\nprocedures of the total design method developed by Dillman\n(2000). The team selected an academically validated ques-\ntionnaire that had been developed by Black (2006) to evalu-\nate the outcomes and impact of executive leadership\nprograms and was thought to be adaptable to the CITY\nLeaders program model. This questionnaire, the Leadership\nProgram Outcomes Measure (LPOM; Black & Earnest,\n2009) was selected as the core instrument to assess the\nimpact of the CITY Leaders Program on participants. Dr.\nBlack granted permission to use and modify the instrument\nfor the evaluation.\nThe questionnaire was modified only in areas where it\nwas clear that the questions did not fit with our particular\npopulation of youth and the nature of the CITY Leaders\nintervention; the community outcomes section was modified\nthe most. We also included two additional subscales, one to\nassess the components of the program and one to assess the\ndegree of learning experienced by graduates. As recom-\nmended by Dr. Black, open-ended space for participant com-\nments and reflections was added after each of the Likert-type\nscale questions. The revised questionnaire was pretested\nwith a small group of alumni who were not eligible to partici-\npate in the alumni survey. Reliability analysis was conducted\nusing Cronbach's alpha, and subscale scores had a range\nfrom .798 to .881. This verified the internal consistency of\nthe scales used to assess each of the areas of outcomes and\njustified our reporting of overall scores for each of the scales\nused in the modified questionnaire.\nThe online survey was sent out to each cohort with a pro-\ngram overview, to remind them of the process and content of\nCITY Leaders in their year (Fan & Yan, 2010). Nevertheless,\na few respondents noted that they experienced some chal-\nlenges in remembering the program, the nature of their par-\nticipation, and how they were affected. They also commented\nthat it was difficult to separate out changes in their lives and\nattribute them solely to this intervention. Many of these\nactive, engaged young people have participated in multiple\nother programs and networks during and after their involve-\nment in CITY Leaders.\nPersistence was required to motivate past participants\nto complete the online survey. UWT staff connected per-\nsonally with CITY Leaders graduates to elicit their\nA Typical CITY Leaders Year:\nrequirements: 6 core modules and a selection of 3 out of 4\nelectives.)\nCore Modules:\n1.

The\ncompletion deadline was extended, and every past par-\nticipant was telephoned. In the end, a total of 50 gradu-\nates responded out of the 114 surveyed for a return rate\nmuch less likely to achieve response rates as high as\nsurveys administered on paper. It is critical, however, to\nminimize non-response error by comparing the profile\nof survey respondents with the composition of those\nwho had completed the program.\nResults\nCITY Leaders Participant Profile\nDemographic drivers in Toronto have pushed the need for\nyouth leadership strategies that are solidly grounded in a cul-\ntural and community context. For many reasons, youth are\nengaging in civic action, organizing themselves in their own\nneighborhoods and cultural communities to tackle pressing\nproblems, and to have a say in what happens. Still others are\nshowing their commitment to change by working with organi-\nzations in their communities. These are the youth that CITY\nLeaders sought to engage in its leadership development efforts.\nCITY Leaders has also intentionally worked with culturally\ndiverse and sometimes marginalized youth from low-income\nneighborhoods, and as a consequence, has had to develop indi-\nvidual and collective leadership within a context of complex\nsystemic issues that are difficult to address. Participants come\nto the program with impressive experience. The competitive\nrecruitment, referral, and selection process sought to ensure\nthat participants entered CITY Leaders with work and orga-\nnizing experience in their own communities. Many sectoral\nparticipants had already been involved in paid positions in the\nsocial sector, some managing programs and staff.\nThe sectoral and neighborhood cohorts can be seen as\noverlapping populations; the outcomes survey revealed that\nthere was little significant variation in their responses. Each\ncohort blends a range of age, community experience, educa-\ntion, and neighborhood engagement, revealing a continuum\nof perspectives and experience in the overall participant\npopulation.\nThe Respondents\nA good cross-section of participants from all cohorts com-\npleted the outcomes survey. The demographics of the respon-\ndents were representative of the CITY Leaders graduates.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Cultural background--of those reporting (n = 46), 28\nCanadian, 11 Caribbean Canadian), eight were South/\nOutcome Survey Results\nAt the core of the survey were five multi-item Likert-type\nscale questions with a range from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a great\ndeal) designed to assess different aspects of program design,\nparticipant learning, and three different levels of program\noutcomes. These scales assessed:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Scale 1: Program Components (nine questions)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Scale 2: Learning (11 questions)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Scale 3: Personal Outcomes (nine questions)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Scale 4: Professional Outcomes (12 questions)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Scale 5: Community Outcomes (13 questions)\nTable 1 provides the overall Likert-type scores, the num-\nber of responses, the number of subscale questions, and\nCronbach's alpha for each scale.\nGraduates' Assessment of Program Components\nThe overall assessment of the extent to which various CITY\nLeader program components supported participants to learn\nwas 3.54 out of a possible 5 points, meaning that graduates\nperceived the contribution of program components as having\nan effect (some/a lot) on promoting learning and leadership.\nSome of the key themes that emerged in this area include\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Relationship building is a key strategy in promoting\nleadership development;\nTable 1. Overview of Participant Ratings of Program Components and Outcomes.\nOverall Likert Scores:\nQuestions (1-5 scale)\nAssessment of\nProgram Components\nAssessment of\nLearning\nAssessment of\nPersonal Outcomes\nLikert 4: Assessment\nof Professional\nOutcomes\nLikert 5: Assessment\nof Community\nOutcomes\nNumber of subscale\nquestions\nShera and Murray 7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Retreats were powerful, focused investments in team\nbuilding and self-knowledge;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Core program modules promoted strong conceptual\nlearning.\nThe program has been kept largely the same from a struc-\ntural and content perspective, but the two streams of neigh-\nborhood and sectoral participants had important differences\nin learning styles and interests. These differences shaped the\ndelivery of the program.\nStaff noted that it took courage for some neighborhood\ncohort participants to participate. They had had negative\nexperiences in the classroom prior to the program, so it was\ncritical for CITY Leaders to provide a safe space to learn.\nThe program team worked hard to strike a balance between\nhigh expectations of participants' performance (e.g., the\nneed for accountability in a certificate program) and the\ncritical importance of adapting the program to multiple abil-\nities and learning styles. Other themes that emerged included\nthe following:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Program instructors added great value to the program,\npromoting specialized knowledge and analysis, but\nthey were not well positioned to develop influential\nrelationships with participants.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The applied learning project appears to have affected\nparticipants unevenly and could benefit from more\nproactive facilitation.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 UWT staff \"anchor\" the program by providing an\nexcellent level of support to participants and promot-\ning their success.\nMost CITY Leaders participants were very professional as\nthey moved through the eight month program. Nevertheless,\nthe program can create emotional moments in people's lives.\nSome participants come from difficult, sometimes traumatic\npersonal circumstances, and have required the proactive sup-\nport of the CITY Leaders staff to continue in the program.\nUWT staff have quietly and faithfully provided support and\nencouragement to many participants. In some extreme cases,\nstaff have intervened to assist participants with personal cri-\nses. The fact that two of the coordinators are program gradu-\nates and the current manager has been with the program since\nits inception adds a great strength to this component of the\nprogram.\nThe most common mentorship activities for program par-\nticipants were supporting career planning, sharing knowl-\nedge about the sector they work in, providing information\nabout the current employment situation, and assisting in\naccessing new contacts and networks. Mentors, key infor-\nmants, and graduates reported that the main challenges of the\nmentorship component were related to negotiating and culti-\nvating a strong working relationship between mentors and\nmentees. These challenges included the need for clarity\nregarding the purpose of mentorships and difficulties in\ncommunicating and connecting. These respondents had a\nnumber of suggestions for the improvement of the experi-\nence, including (a) a group meeting at the beginning to estab-\nlish goals and expectations for mentorship, (b) increased\nclarity of roles and responsibilities, (c) improved participant\nscreening for readiness and commitment, and (d) regular\ncheck-ins to assess the progress of the relationship and the\nachievement of goals.\nIt has been difficult to establish a dedicated Internet-based\nnetwork for CITY Leaders graduates under the umbrella of\nUWT.At the beginning of the program, UWT had invested in\na proprietary online platform for information sharing, net-\nworking, and collaboration. This component did not work\nwell, and over time, mainstream social media (particularly\nLinkedIn) provided excellent low-cost opportunities for pro-\nfessional networking and exchange.\nGraduates' Assessment of Learning\nThe survey asked graduates to assess what they had learned\nthrough their involvement in CITY Leaders. Given that some\nhad been out of the program for 4 or 5 years, it was expected\nthat their answers would provide a more realistic assessment\nof what had been useful to them, based on their experience\nand employment since graduation. This section focuses on\nthe areas of learning that graduates assessed as making the\ngreatest contribution to their development as leaders. The\noverall assessment of learning was M = 3.43.\nRespondents (80%) reported that they had learned a lot or\na great deal about creative thinking (M = 4.0). Women were\nmore positive about the creative thinking session (females =\nand leadership styles was important for 78% of respondents\n(M = 3.98). Graduate interviews suggested that they would\nlike to increase the integration of critical self-reflection and\nexploration of leadership and leader styles throughout the\nprogram.\nDiversity and cultural fluency were reported as having a\nmoderate effect (M = 3.48), which is likely an indicator of\nprior training and life experience in this area, although some\nrespondents commented on the positive effects of working\nalongside people of different religions and cultures in the\nCity Leaders program. Some instructors felt that sector par-\nticipants became more knowledgeable and skilled, and\nneighborhood participants became more self-aware, confi-\ndent, and networked with colleagues.\nThe lowest scores for learning were given to social media\nand social enterprise; yet, some respondents noted how these\ncomponents had been well-timed and highly influential in\ntheir professional lives. The program team was observed as\ndoing an excellent job of adapting the program to the learn-\ning needs and styles of participants. Cohorts had different\npersonalities and were demanding in different ways. This\nwas a substantial challenge, since the education, age, and\nexperience levels within and between sectors varied widely.\n8 SAGE Open\nThe results raise questions about how much people already\nknew coming into the program and how much they could\nbenefit from the learning offered. Were some over-qualified\nor just seeking credentials? Did the selection process target\nthe people who could most benefit from the content offered?\nLevel 1 Outcomes: Personal Change\nThis question exploring the personal outcomes of participa-\ntion in CITY Leaders revealed that the program contributed\nto significant learning, empowerment, and leadership out-\ncomes, with an aggregate score of M = 3.38. Although the\ndistinction between \"personal\" outcomes and \"professional\"\noutcomes detailed in the next section may be somewhat arti-\nficial, this question explored how participants' self-percep-\ntion had been changed and also revealed the process by\nwhich the program promotes learning.\nAlmost three quarters of respondents (72%) reported that\n\"Exposure to new ideas and concepts led to my growth\" a lot\nor a great deal (M = 3.92). Women were significantly more\nimproved in creative thinking\" (M = 3.66). In open-ended\ncomments, they added that they had developed a more in-\ndepth analysis of social issues and a better understanding of\nhow the non-profit sector works. Many felt better able to\ncommunicate effectively and articulate thoughts and ideas.\nBecoming a part of this network changed my perspective of life\nand my approach to life; I lost myself in all of the learning and\nunlearning that CITY Leaders fosters. It took almost two years\nafter graduation for me to truly find myself, I feel fortunate to\nhave had the opportunity to unlearn all that would not serve my\nultimate purpose. . . . I didn't learn all of these lessons while in\nCITY Leaders, but I would say it was the catalyst for my\nre-examination of my life. (Graduate, Survey No. 13)\nThe research also confirmed that observational learning\namong peers is a powerful way for youth to learn and try out\nnew behaviors. The second most frequent personal outcome\nreported by 60% of respondents was that they had met \"peo-\nple whose success they could imitate\" (M = 3.74).\nI'd never had an opportunity to sit down and engage with people\ndoing this work. I thought--\"wow this is a 25 year old manager\nin the social sector without a degree in social work . . . who looks\nlike me!\" (Graduate, Interview No. 2)\nWhen I came to CITY Leaders I wanted to change the world: I\nhad thousands of ideas. Having the opportunity to meet and\nmingle with like-minded individuals allowed me to see how I\ncould go about achieving my goal. (Graduate, Interview No. 13)\nThe exploration of new ideas and behaviors within a sup-\nportive community of peers is an important starting point for\nleadership development. The program brings together\ninfluential young people who would not otherwise have\nmet. It facilitates opportunities for peer learning, role mod-\neling, collaboration, and personal growth. Peers are role\nmodels and sounding boards for more realistic goals, plans,\nand attitudes.\nThe process from beginning to end gave me opportunities to\nevaluate myself but also to have others give their honest\nfeedback about their perceptions and evaluations of me.\n(Graduate, Survey No. 36)\nI have struggled with the balance of personal life and professional\nlife--understanding which part of myself to bring to each role.\nThe CITY Leaders experience connected me to people who have\nhelped me work through this challenge. (Graduate, Survey No.\nTeam building and developing a cohesive cohort of young\nleaders have noticeably strengthened the program. Cohort\nrelationships are very important, and a broad diversity of\nprogram participants contributes greatly to creativity and\nlearning. Graduates also developed a strong perception of\nthemselves as leaders, with a much clearer idea of their own\nleadership styles. The program has helped participants to\nintegrate new perceptions and attitudes, including the notion\nof service to others and the community. Interviewees in par-\nticular expressed an understanding that they could now play\na range of roles to build leadership and promote action in\ntheir communities. CITY Leaders has increased participants'\nself-confidence, empowering them to make life-changing\ndecisions and promote community change.\nA consistent theme raised by graduates was their percep-\ntion of an increased ability to promote social change or com-\nmunity action: 60% of respondents agreed that \"CITY\nLeaders helped me to realize that I have the power to make a\ndifference\" (M = 3.70). Fifty percent of the respondents\nreported an \"improvement in self-confidence\" (M = 3.48).\nConfidence and empowerment were a huge aspect of CITY\nLeaders. As a person of colour in this society it is much harder\nto gain respect and feel empowered. CITY Leaders helped me\nrealize that I am a leader and can make positive changes.\n(Graduate, Survey No. 24)\nThe question, \"I feel more respected,\" was more likely to\nbe answered positively by the neighborhood participants (M\nOne example of life-changing decision making is that\ngraduates are going on to further training, certification, and\neducation that they might not otherwise have pursued: 29\n(58%) decided to do so, as a result of their involvement in the\nprogram. Graduates have also shifted career directions and,\nas a result, modified their training/education plans. Half of\nthe respondents noted that \"My CITY Leaders experience\nbegan a series of life-changing events for me\" (M = 3.32).\nShera and Murray 9\nAgain, women were also significantly more likely to note\nI was lacking inspiration. I was doing community work because\nI was passionate but with no support, which led to my burn out\nmoment. When I was accepted into CITY Leaders it was a\ndefining day for me because from then I knew it would change\nmy life. (Graduate, Survey No. 34)\nLevel 2 Outcomes: Professional Change\nGraduates reported the greatest level of change in the area of\ntheir professional and career development (M = 3.48).\nRelationships with peers and staff appear to have been the\nmost influential aspect of the program, leveraging profes-\nsional capacity building and advancement through observa-\ntional learning and role modeling. \"My exposure to other\npeople and ideas helped me develop professionally\" was\nreported by 80.9% of respondents to be important (M = 4.13).\nWomen were more likely to say this (females = 4.39; males\nticipants a range of opportunities to work with peers and\nmentors to explore career directions and choices. A substan-\ntial 44.7% of respondents decided to change their choice of\ncareer as a result of their involvement in CITY Leaders.\nWomen were far more likely to say that the program had\nchanged their career direction (females = 54.8%; males =\ncated that many others had clarified their career options and\nthe educational requirements of their career choices. The\nprogram shifted many graduates toward more \"applied\"\ncareer choices grounded in a commitment to community\ndevelopment.\nA prevalent theme emerging from the survey and inter-\nviews was that graduates have become more personally com-\nmitted to the social sector. Some said they were now\ninterested in pursuing management track positions with\nsocial service agencies. This theme is of particular note\nbecause this generation has relatively high-salary expecta-\ntions and talked about the difficulty of choosing between pri-\nvate and not-for-profit employment. Self-employment is\nincreasingly an attractive option for this generation in the\nface of falling investment in the sector and reduced employ-\nment opportunities. About a quarter of respondents com-\nmented on their interest in pursuing more entrepreneurial\ncareers in the \"public benefit\" sector. Participants came to\nthe program with varying degrees of job experience and\ntechnical skill. Through CITY Leaders, they improved their\nprofessional skills to varying degrees. Lower outcomes\nscores for technical capacity building appear not so much a\nnegative comment on the quality of the program content and\ndelivery, as much as a reflection of the high degree of skill\nsome participants had when they came into the program. An\nestimated 20% of participants had more than 3 years of work\nexperience in the sector and/or advanced education coming\ninto the program.\nGraduates have been able to deepen their professional\ncapacity and become more sophisticated in the way they\nwork. Respondents confirmed that they had used their new\nskills and knowledge in their working lives: 54% reported\n\"improving their skills in facilitating group decision mak-\ning\" (M = 3.57) and 47% \"became more innovative in their\napproach to problem solving\" (M = 3.47). Graduates also\nreported that they had experienced a change in perspective\nand, as a result, a change in their professional behavior. They\nhave become more collaborative and cross-sectoral in their\nday to day work, and they reported being able to go deeper in\ntheir practice, improve the clarity of their objectives, and\nstrengthen the effectiveness of their program management\nand delivery work.\nGraduates improved their analysis of key political, eco-\nnomic, social, and cultural issues in Toronto. They gained a\nbetter understanding of poverty and more realistic ideas for\nadvocacy, policy development, and social action. They also\nspoke of their increased ability to communicate and articu-\nlate their ideas and opinions more persuasively. Many\nreported having a stronger mental map of organizations,\nfunding, and other resources in Toronto's social sector, and\nmany expressed a greater understanding and awareness of\nUWT. They have integrated new ways of thinking and work-\ning into their daily professional life.\nStrong professional networks were the single strongest\noutcome: 74.5% reported that \"CITY Leaders helped me to\nbuild a better network of contacts\" (51% a great deal and an\nadditional 23.5% a lot; M = 4.11). The research verified that\ngraduates are also extending their connections well beyond\nthe CITY Leaders network.\nAs a result of my CITY Leaders experience, I have gained the\nright skills to become a better networker. Specifically, the\nproject we had to conduct, pushed me to make connections with\nprofessionals in the health industry, which has now led to me\nacquiring a board of directors position with a non-profit\norganization and may open doors for me to obtain employment\nin my field. (Graduate, Survey No. 14)\nCITY Leaders itself has become a strong professional net-\nwork bringing graduates together as colleagues, collabora-\ntors, and allies. The outcomes survey provided us with new\ninsights into the extent and impact of this networking:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 23 (50%) network only with participants from their\nown cohort\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 23 (50%) network with participants from their own\ncohort and other cohorts\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 None had lost touch with their own cohorts\nExtensive networking among past and current partici-\npants has yielded a range of benefits. Graduates have formed\nlifelong friendships and collaborations, many have gained\ncritical advice and support to assist them to find and grow in\njobs, and still others have formed professional alliances that\nhave served to deepen their ability to affect outcomes through\ntheir work. Interestingly, graduates have started to sub-con-\ntract and hire each other. Graduates are gaining professional\npower and creating a youth \"voice\" in their organizations\nand communities. Graduate interviewees spoke of becoming\nmore comfortable wielding their power, both in the commu-\nnity and in their organizations. More than two thirds of the\nsurvey respondents (68.1%) also reported they are \"now\nmore confident and better prepared to assume leadership\nroles in organizations\" (M = 3.89). They have deepened their\nleadership identities, allowing them to take on leadership\nroles with more confidence; they are more able to speak up at\nwork, ask for support and do other things that they had previ-\nously perceived as risk taking. Yet, more than that, the pro-\ngram appears to have raised the understanding of graduates\nthat there is a professional field of practice within which they\ncan play an important leadership role.\nEngaging youth to discuss critical social issues has begun\nto create a uniquely young and culturally diverse \"voice\" and\nperspective to the debate about how to solve the pressing\nchallenges of poverty, social inclusion, accessible transporta-\ntion, community safety, public health, and food security.\nSome recognized that as racialized youth, they feel excluded\nfrom the sector. This is a critical issue for the field: Opening\ndoors for these young professionals is not just about connect-\ning youth to new people, events, and opportunities. It is also\nabout changing the psychology and perceptions both of the\nsector and of youth who are seeking to engage in social\nchange. The research identified that CITY Leaders has begun\nto change the messaging (both as internal dialogue and as\nexternal reality) about participants' right/ability as racialized\nyouth in Canadian society to be a part of the social develop-\nment sector. CITY Leaders is promoting new perspectives\nabout what is possible, not only among the youth themselves\nbut also among the adults who have connected to the partici-\npants over the course of CITY Leaders.\nThis new, tested confidence has advanced graduates'\ncareers, supporting them to participate in their work and\ncommunities in a more focused and influential way. More\nthan two thirds (68.1%) noted as follows: \"I developed the\nconfidence to operate on a different level in my organization\nand/or career\" (M = 3.85). In addition, 46% noted the follow-\ning: \"I have been promoted or have moved up to a level of\nmore responsibility in my work\" (M = 3.17). Graduates noted\nthat the support, advice, connections, and opportunities they\ngained from the program have given them momentum in\ntheir careers: some are working for larger, more established\norganizations, and 46% noted that \"I increased my earning\nI was recently approached and offered a new job. I was very\nunsure about whether or not this was the right role for me. My\nCITY Leaders mentor guided me through the process and\nassured me it was a good move. I wouldn't have been able to see\nall sides of this decision without the knowledge from CITY\nLeaders, and also from the direct guidance of my mentor. I\nrecently took the job--it is a big promotion for me and\nchallenging work. I'm certain that my CITY Leaders experience,\ncertification, and relationships helped me to get the job.\n(Graduate, Survey No. 10)\nSome graduates, however, experience barriers as they\nbring their new knowledge and behaviors back to their orga-\nnizations. Sixteen graduates (34%) had encountered a lot or\na great deal of \"barriers to bringing their knowledge back to\ntheir workplace.\" More women than men reported that they\nhave \"shared the knowledge and learning from CITYLeaders\nwith my colleagues and/or management\" (females, M = 3.94;\nCITY Leaders has promoted employability. For an age\ndemographic that has very high levels of unemployment, the\nCITY Leaders graduates enjoy high-employment levels.\nOnly one of 50 respondents reported currently being unem-\nployed and one under-employed (although four did not\nanswer the question about their current employment, which\ncould mean that they are un/under-employed). The employ-\nment information confirms that these young professionals\nare making a commitment to the social sector: 54.5% are\nemployed in the social services and a significant number\n(11.4%) are employed in the health sector, which suggests a\npossible new focus for a CITY Leaders networking session.\nRespondents reported their current job titles and said that\ngraduates are moving into managerial stream positions as\nproject coordinators and program managers, on par with or\nmore advanced than other social-sector employees of similar\nage and education. Yet, many of the graduates are employed\nthrough time-limited, project-based funding through initia-\ntives funded by the YCF, Action for Neighbourhood Change,\nand the National Crime Prevention Centre.\nLevel 3 Outcomes: Community Engagement\nCommunity engagement outcomes have been much more\ncomplicated to interpret. There were lower levels of\nreported change as a result of CITY Leaders (M = 2.92).\nThis is likely related to the fact that youth participants were\nselected precisely for their prior, active involvement in\ncommunity-based organizations and in community orga-\nnizing. It appears that graduates are not necessarily more\nengaged, but rather that they are more deeply and effec-\ntively engaged. In general, neighborhood cohorts were\nmuch more likely to say that they had been affected at this\nlevel by CITY Leaders. Sectoral cohorts did not necessarily\nbecome more connected to communities but did develop a\nstronger understanding of the issues and needs, developing\na stronger ability to empathize, listen, and work more effec-\ntively. Sectoral participants did not necessarily connect to\nneighborhoods in the same way.\nA recurring theme in the research has been the increased\nsophistication of CITY Leaders graduates in their under-\nstanding and analysis of complex issues, such as poverty and\nmanaging diversity, and their enhanced political awareness.\nMore than half (56.5%) reported as follows: \"I increased my\nappreciation of cultural differences and diversity\" (M = 3.39)\nand 46.8% noted the following: \"I have a better understand-\ning of complex issues like poverty, diversity and social\nGraduates are also \"now more committed to working for\nsocial justice and change in my community/neighborhood\"\n(54.4%), (M = 3.3). Graduates also seem to also have inter-\nnalized a desire to critique how the social sector currently\nworks and to value innovation, new practices and broader\nhorizons, bringing a stronger new youth perspective to the\nsector.\nThe package of new knowledge, experience, and behav-\niors facilitated by CITY Leaders has enhanced graduates'\nability to work toward their vision for change, with 60.8%\nreporting \"I have a stronger vision for change in my com-\nbelieve that I have new skills, tools and connections to sup-\nport me to work toward that vision\" (M = 3.80). CITY\nLeaders appears to re-energize and bolster community activ-\nists, but this level of involvement may not be sustainable.\nThirty graduates (62.5%) reported that they are currently\ndoing volunteer work and are involved in a wide range of\nformal and informal volunteer positions, including after\nschool programs, youth mentoring, community boards, and\nyouth associations. Some have continued actively to support\nCITY Leaders, sitting on the Advisory Committee, facilitat-\ning workshops and assisting staff. Some have increased their\npolitical involvement as they support community organizing\nand join political parties.\nIt appears that work and school displaces volunteering to\nsome extent, but given that almost two thirds of CITYLeaders\ngraduates are volunteers, they are well ahead of the average\nrate of volunteer engagement for their peers across Canada. A\n2010 study of volunteering in Canada (V\u00e9zina & Crompton,\n34 (46%) reported that they volunteer. Greater volunteer\nengagement, however, received the lowest outcome scores:\nabout one third increased their commitment to local organiza-\ntions, 23% were more active volunteers, and 24% said that\nthey had focused their commitment by reducing the number\nof organizations at which they volunteer. More than half\n(53.2%) of respondents noted that they had increased their\nresponsibility and authority as volunteers. The neighborhood\ncluster reported a substantially higher outcome in this area\nhave broadened their reach and pursued social innovation and\nchange through networking and collaboration.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 18% have championed a new cause since joining\nCITY Leaders.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 45% became involved in groups and networks that\nreach across Toronto.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 21% have extended their involvement to the provin-\ncial or national level.\nGraduate Assessment of Overall Outcomes\nIn retrospect, alumni rated the overall change in their lives as\na result of CITY Leaders at M = 6.83 on a 10-point scale.\nWomen reported significantly higher overall scores (females\ntwo thirds (65%) of alumni felt that it was important or\nextremely important to continue to offer the CITY Leaders\nprogram. Almost all (97.9%) said that they would recom-\nmend the program to their peers and colleagues.\nI talk excessively about this program because it really did change\nmy life. I had very high expectations about this program and I\nwas blown away that they were exceeded and I really did\nbecome a creative young leader. The opportunities that I have\nbeen exposed to are invaluable. It's not just what I learned in the\nclassroom but everything I experienced as a result of my\ninvolvement with this amazingly important program. We need\nmore leaders, keep going! The world needs you! (Graduate,\nSurvey No. 3)\nAlumni Would Like CITY Leaders to Continue\nWith \"Post Graduate\" Activities\nPrevious consultations with graduates had identified a num-\nber of ways that CITY Leaders could continue to bring\nalumni together and support them in their careers. Through\nthe survey, alumni expressed varying levels of interest in a\nrange of activities:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 82% were very interested in providing \"ongoing pro-\nfessional development\" opportunities for graduates.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 62% were very interested in creating social opportuni-\nties for graduates to reflect, reconnect, and share\nwisdom.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 53% wanted to promote a \"strong network presence\nthat supports community action\" (very interested):\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 46% want to \"use technology creatively and strategi-\ncally\" to support network activities; 44% were very\ninterested in developing a member driven, collabora-\ntive structure (very interested): neighborhood (70.6%)\nSince the completion of this study, two additional\ncohorts have completed the program for a final total of 149\ngraduates. The UWT has initiated an Alumni Network,\nhosted sessions on business start-up, and navigating com-\nplex service systems. They are also planning a future cross-\ncohort retreat.\nWhat Has CITY Leaders Achieved?\nCity Leaders Has Contributed to Substantial\nChange in Participants' Lives\nCITY Leaders outcomes are significant: Alumni ratings of\nchange show that the program affected them in a range of ways\nthat have enhanced their ability to lead in organizations and\ncommunities. Deeper qualitative analysis revealed that substan-\ntial numbers of graduates experienced high degrees of change in\ntheir lives as a result of their participation in the program.\nThrough a retrospective assessment of five program\ncohorts over the past 5 years, this evaluation found that CITY\nLeaders also created outcomes that go beyond the immediate\nchanges stimulated by participation to promote \"develop-\nmental\" changes (Black & Earnest, 2009) that persist after\nthe intervention is over, complementing and building on one\nanother. The evaluation also revealed evidence of \"transfor-\nmative\" change: fundamental shifts in attitudes and behav-\niors. There is sufficient evidence to support the belief that\nthese shifts will not only be maintained but will develop fur-\nKress, 2006). Some of these complementary developmental\noutcomes include the following:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Sustained peer support and collaboration\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Strengthened confidence and identity as a leader\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Increased personal agency and self-direction\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Clarity and realism about educational and career\npathways\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Enhanced reach and professional connection to the\nsocial sector\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 New approaches, increased politicization, and\nstrengthened commitment to social change\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Enhanced professionalism and effectiveness\nA Solid Foundation Has Been Built to Promote\nBroader Change\nCITY Leaders has effected change beyond the level of the\nindividuals targeted by the program. In their open-ended\nresponses, alumni identified many ways in which they had\ncontributed to action and change through their volunteer and\npaid leadership in organizations and communities. Although\nit was beyond the scope of the evaluation to measure these\nchanges, it was possible to identify three general areas of\nonward, deepening change: sectoral strengthening, deepened\nsocial change practice, and collaborative civic activism\n(Dugan et al., 2015). Although the evidence suggests that\nsuch changes are occurring spontaneously, there is great\npotential for CITY Leaders to cultivate them more intention-\nally through work with alumni networks.\nSectoral strengthening.The CITY Leaders program is open-\ning doors for young racialized professionals (Erbstein, 2013).\nMany CITY Leaders alumni have made educational and\ncareer choices that lead them to new ways of engaging in and\nsupporting the social development sector, and they are gain-\ning more responsibility in their careers. There are indications\nthat further targeted intervention could continue to support\nthem to move into executive and civic leadership career\npathways.\nDeepened social change practice.CITY Leaders alumni are\napplying new practices in their work. They noted that they\nare better at their jobs and their community organizing,\nthrough having gained a better picture of the root causes of\nthe challenges they are working to resolve. They have greater\npotential to promote long-term systemic change because\nthey now understand the need for strategic approaches that\nCollaborative civic activism. Alumni involvement in CITY Lead-\ners has promoted their inclusion in the social development sec-\ntor. Many expressed a strengthened commitment to civic\naction and social development (Checkoway & Gutierrez,\n2006). Their increased reach means that they are now con-\nnected to leaders and networks across the Toronto region, the\nprovince, and beyond. They are moving out of work contexts\nthat are functionally \"siloed,\" cultivating new multi-sectoral\npartnerships and promoting collaborative problem solving.\nGreat potential exists to support CITY Leaders' alumni net-\nwork to become a vehicle for collaborative agenda setting, to\ncreate a legitimate, persuasive youth \"voice\" for Toronto.\nParticipant Outcomes Appear to Be Enhanced in\nDiverse Groups\nTargeting has been an important theme in this evaluation. It\nhas been difficult to draw any reliable conclusions about who\ncan benefit most from participation in the CITY Leader's\nprogram although the evaluation revealed that a diverse mix\nof youth have benefited from the program. The younger,\nleast educated and experienced participants are perceived to\nhave gained a great deal from the program, but it is hard to\ndifferentiate between what they learned as a result of the pro-\ngram and what they gained from the influence of a diverse\ngroup of other older, more experienced participants in their\ncohort. The more experienced, educated participants noted\nthat although the program content was not entirely new to\nthem, they had deepened their professional practice. Most\nnoted that participation in the program had led to enhanced\npersonal empowerment. These identified gains are congruent\nwith what has been observed in the literature (Doherty, 2003;\nFuture research, however, needs to focus on a more in-depth\nexploration of the gender differences that were found in the\nidentified impacts of this leadership program (Rhee & Sigler,\nCITY Leaders Has Created an Effective Set of\nStrategies for Leadership Development\nThis evaluation has provided a better understanding of the\ncomplex mix of interventions that contribute to engaging\nyouth and developing youth leadership. UWT has done a\nremarkable job of navigating among changing and some-\ntimes competing visions and expectations to create a chal-\nlenging, open, exciting forum for learning. The evaluation\nhas demonstrated that CITY Leaders creates safe spaces for\nyouth to model and test new leadership behaviors. It offers a\nset of overlapping and complementary interventions and\nstrategies that operate both on an individual and a collective\nlevel (Figure 1). This evaluation identified the following\ninterventions that appear to be mutually supportive in pro-\nmoting youth leadership outcomes.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Building connections that otherwise would not hap-\npen--Promoting relationships between peers, and\nwith mentors, instructors, and new networks.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Facilitating a peer community and observational\nlearning--Promoting a supportive environment of\ntrust and respect that creates new learning opportuni-\nties through role modeling and team building.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Introducing new ideas, values, and knowledge--\nIntegrating diversity, leadership, creative problem\nsolving, collaboration, and social justice into new\napproaches.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Co-creating the big picture--Facilitating a more con-\nfident, sophisticated analysis of the systemic forces\nthat produce poverty and exclusion in Toronto and\ncreating an understanding of the structure and\nresources of the social sector. This builds a more real-\nistic, youth-led, collective vision for social change.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Promoting critical self-assessment--Supporting a\nbetter assessment of each participant's personal assets\nand aptitudes, providing an understanding of personal\ndecision making and leadership styles, promoting\nself-direction in pursuing goals and opportunities, and\nbenchmarking progress.\nFigure 1. Key interventions--A package of effective strategies for building youth leadership.\nNote. CITY = Creative Institute for Toronto's Young.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Enhancing professional skills and capacity--\nEnhancing technical skills, professional knowledge,\nand access to job and career advice with a view to\nbuilding professional competence.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Providing access to new opportunities--Opening\ndoors to new contacts and hands-on learning opportu-\nnities that allow alumni to try out new ideas, skills,\nand approaches (e.g., collective learning projects,\njobs, conferences, round tables, workshops, \"experts,\"\nnetworks, and political parties).\nThis evaluation offers compelling evidence that UWT\nhas made an important investment in a generation of\nyoung leaders who will continue working together and\nwill influence the direction of the social sector in the\ndecades to come. The cohesion and influence of this group\nis likely to grow significantly in the coming years.\nFeedback from interviews and surveys, however, suggests\nthat the model currently being delivered may not be the\nmost effective configuration of these strategies.\nRespondents suggested a number of changes to the pro-\ngram including strengthening the pedagogical anchoring\nof the program to enhance the links between different\ncomponents and sessions, changing the structure and tim-\ning of the mentorship program, extending CITY Leaders\nprogramming to serve graduates, and linking the CITY\nLeaders participants more strongly to community agen-\ncies and other leadership networks. The new insights\nderived from this in-depth investigation of the CITY\nLeaders Program will hopefully be instructive to other\ngroups and organizations that are undertaking leadership\ndevelopment initiatives in their own communities.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: The United Way of\nGreater Toronto funded this study.\nReferences\nBandura, A.
