It occurs in as\nindividuals of northern European heri-\nbeing carriers of mutations in the HFE gene\nassociated with hereditary hemochroma-\ntosis.\nHereditary hemochromatosis is due to\nan abnormal absorption of iron from the in-\ntestine. As iron loading progresses, it leads\nto irreversible damage of many organs and\ntissues, resulting in hepatic fibrosis and cir-\nrhosis, endocrine dysfunction, cardiomy-\nopathy, or arthropathy.2 The classic\n\"bronzeddiabetes\"(skinpigmentation,dia-\nbetesmellitus,andcirrhosis)representsonly\na small fraction of affected individuals, usu-\nally those in whom the diagnosis has been\nundetected for many years. Hereditary he-\nmochromatosis more often presents with\nnonspecific complaints, such as joint pain,\nfatigue, and abdominal pain.3\nreditary hemochromatosis, HFE, was iden-\ntified.4 This gene codes for a transmem-\nbrane protein that is presumed to be\ninvolved in the regulation of the intracel-\nlular iron level.

The clinical di-\nagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis is established\nmuch more rarely than expected, and strong associa-\ntion between C282Y homozygosity and hereditary he-\nmochromatosis makes it tempting to suggest population-\nbased genetic screening for this mutation.1,15 However,\nseveral issues need to be clarified before the conditions\nfor screening are fulfilled. What proportion of individu-\nals with hereditary hemochromatosis on a molecular level\nwill develop serious clinical manifestations, and what is\nthe impact on heterozygotes? Examinations of the fre-\nquency of C282Y homozygotes in healthy populations\nand in other diseases have shown that the clinical pen-\netrance of this mutation is low. Some studies16,17 have iden-\ntified individuals who are homozygous for C282Y but do\nnot fulfill the clinical and biochemical criteria for hemo-\nchromatosis.\nHeterozygotes for mutations in HFE have signifi-\ncantly higher serum iron and transferrin saturation11 and\na lower frequency of iron deficiency anemia.9 Further-\nmore, new studies strongly suggest a relation between\nthe storage of iron and cardiovascular diseases. Two stud-\nies18,19 have shown that heterozygosity for mutations in\nHFE confers a significant increase in risk for cardiovas-\ncular events in men and women. However, the evidence\nfor adverse effects of being a carrier is still sparse.\nIron is a potent promotor of generation of free radi-\ncals--strong reactive ions that react with cell mem-\nbranes and cell organelles. Free radicals are believed to\nplay a role in the development of cancer and cardiovas-\ncular diseases and in aging, although there is no good\nexperimental evidence.20,21 HFE mutations thus repre-\nsent a group of common mutations that may affect the\naging processes, morbidity, and mortality possibly through\nthe accumulation of iron. Except for apolipoprotein E,22\nno longevity-associated genes have been firmly estab-\nlished, and the HFE mutations are of particular interest\nbecause of the potential for prevention of harmful ef-\nfects through venesection.\nIn this study, we genotyped 1784 individuals aged\n45 to 100 years from population-based studies for mu-\ntations in HFE to investigate whether the frequency of\nheterozygotes for mutations in HFE diminishes by age.\nIf so, this would indicate that heterozygotes for the mu-\ntations in HFE have increased mortality rates starting at\nmidlife.\nRESULTS\nA total of 599 samples were screened for mutations in\nexon 2.

However, the\nresults indicate an age-related reduction in the carrier fre-\nquency of the hemochromatosis-related C282Y muta-\ntion (Table 2). These findings are consistent with the hy-\npothesis that there may be a survival difference from\nmiddle age onward, especially for women, among carri-\ners and noncarriers of the C282Y allele. The age-related\nreduction is only minor after age 65 years--a trend that\nhas also been shown for obesity.29 Our data thus imply\nthat there is selection against carriers of C282Y and that\nthis manifests before age 65 years.\nThe observed reduction in C282Y carrier frequency\npersisted until age 95 years; however, the frequency in the\ncentenarian group is the same as that in the youngest group\nfor both men and women. There are several possible ex-\nplanations for this. Although 183 centenarians is a large\nsample,includingmostofthecentenariansinDenmarkwho\nreachedage100yearsinthestudyyear,itisnotlargeenough\nto give a reliable carrier frequency. This can be seen in the\nbroad95%confidenceintervalsinTable2;therefore,itmay\nbe a chance finding. Another possible explanation is that\nheterozygosity for C282Y has a higher mortality rate in the\nyounger groups but becomes beneficial in the oldest old\n(antagonistic pleiotropy). Furthermore, the fact that some\nbecome octogenarians or nonagenarians with a \"bad\" gene\ncould be balanced by a good composition of other rel-\nevant genes or lifestyle, making it more likely that they be-\ncome centenarians.\nThere are several limitations to our study. The ma-\njor limitation is the inability to study directly the effect\nof the C282Y allele on survival. The results suggest that\nthere is a survival difference, but more specific data on\nthe relationship of the C282Y allele to mortality rates are\nneeded before such a conclusion can be made because\nthe design used here is vulnerable to migration and as-\nsociation to twin status. However, it seems unlikely that\nmigration or twin status should be associated with HFE\nmutation status. Another limitation is that our study does\nnot give an idea of the mechanisms behind this survival\ndifference. It is tempting to suggest that the difference is\nowing to accumulation of iron, but this should be fur-\nther investigated. It is well known that heterozygotes for\nmutations in HFE have a higher iron content, but it has\nuntil now been assumed that this was without signifi-\ncant influence on morbidity and mortality rates. Our find-\ning that heterozygotes for C282Y may have reduced life\nexpectancy raises the question of whether the elevated\niron stores affect mortality and morbidity rates, al-\nthough some other effect of C282Y is possible.\nIt is well known that there is a low incidence of myo-\ncardial infarction in menstruating women. The finding that\nheterozygosity for mutations in HFE confers a significant\nincrease in risk for cardiovascular events in men and wom-\nTable 1.

In that case, iron deple-\ntion could have a large protective effect.19 However, if the\naccumulation of iron is in fact the mechanism behind this\napparently increased mortality rate among heterozygotes\nfor C282Y, then our study would probably underesti-\nmate the increased mortality rate because several indi-\nvidualswithoutthismutationmaynonethelesshavehigher-\nthan-normal stored iron levels owing to other known or\nunidentified iron-loading mutations.\nSeveral studies have demonstrated a familial aggre-\ngation of premature myocardial infarction.30 Some of this\ncan be explained by hypertension or hyperlipidemia; how-\never, in a large proportion of high-risk families, no ag-\ngregation of the known risk factors is seen. It is possible\nthat this familial aggregation is due to a gene that favors\niron absorption.31 A relevant question then is whether\nthe increased mortality can be prevented by deliberate\niron depletion by regular blood donation, by recom-\nmending a diet with a low iron content, or by warning\nagainst taking vitamins that contain iron.\n93 years and 1 aged 70 years) is not surprising because\nearlier studies have shown that the penetrance of heredi-\ntary hemochromatosis in homozygotes for C282Y is low--\nprobably less than 50%. According to the Hardy-\nWeinberg law, we should have found 6 participants\nhomozygous for C282Y, with an overall allele fre-\nquency of 6%.\nThis study shows an age-related reduction in the car-\nrier frequency of C282Y in the HFE gene, suggesting that\ncarriers have a shorter life expectancy. Our study does not\nshed light on which mechanisms are behind this shorter\nlife expectancy or whether this increased mortality can be\nprevented by, for instance, venesection. Future research\nneeds to elucidate this before a decision concerning popu-\nlation-based screening for mutations in HFE is made.\nThis study was supported by research grant NIA-PO1-\nAG08761 from the National Institute on Aging; the Danish\nNational Research Foundation, Copenhagen, Denmark; A.\nJ.
