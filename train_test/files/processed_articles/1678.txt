Pedersen1,2\n1Department of Psychology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles.\n2The Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.\nThis study examined whether depressive symptoms increase with age longitudinally, and it evaluated two\npotential sources of influence--declining health and non-health-related negative life events. Adults aged 29\u00ad93\nyears from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies\u00ad\nDepression scale three times at 3-year intervals. Analyses were performed on one twin (n = 877) and repeated on\nthe second twin (n = 909) as a nonindependent replication. Depressive symptoms increased modestly with age\nin both men and women, particularly in the older participants. Health status was correlated with depressive\nsymptoms, but new illnesses in the previous 3 years did not consistently predict increases in depressive symptoms\nlongitudinally. Negative life events in the previous 3 years predicted depressive symptoms. Notably, depressive\nsymptoms also predicted future negative life events.\nDEPRESSIVE symptoms, which are more common in late\nlife than in middle age (Kessler, Foster, Webster, &\nHouse, 1992), are associated with serious negative outcomes\nsuch as increased risk of a depressive disorder (Beekman et al.,\n1997) and increased morbidity and mortality (Bruce, Seeman,\nMerrill, & Blazer, 1994). Thus, it is important for us to under-\nstand the association between aging and depressive symptoms.\nInvestigating this critical issue can be difficult, however, be-\ncause of the need for large, population-based, longitudinal sam-\nples covering a wide range of ages. The current study\nrepresents an unusual opportunity to examine depressive\nsymptoms and aging in such a sample.\nIn cross-sectional studies, levels of depressive symptoms are\nhighest in the youngest and oldest adults, yielding a U-shaped\ncurve (Kessler et al., 1992). The higher levels of symptoms in\nolder compared with middle-aged adults thus represent the\nright-hand portion of that curve.\nWe need longitudinal data, however, to discern whether\ndepressive symptoms actually change with age or whether\ndifferences between midlife and old age represent a cohort\neffect or some sort of selection effect. We found only two\nlongitudinal studies of depressive symptoms and aging that\nincluded any middle-aged participants. Rothermund and\nBrandtsta\n\u00a8dter (2003) found modest increases over 8 years in\na sample of persons aged 54\u00ad77, and Barefoot and colleagues\n(Barefoot, Mortensen, Helms, Avlund, & Schroll, 2001) found\nincreases only for men in their sample of men and women\ninterviewed at ages 50, 60, and 80. Several longitudinal in-\nvestigations have been conducted in samples limited to older\nadults. Most have not detected changes in depressive symptoms\nover time (Dent et al., 1999; Haynie, Berg, Johansson, Gatz, &\nO'Hara (1992) found increases in depressive symptoms over 6\nyears of follow-up. Thus, existing longitudinal studies provide\nlimited support for the increase in depressive symptoms with\nage that is suggested by cross-sectional studies. Studies with\nwider age ranges and longer follow-up periods are needed.\nWe may ask whether increases in depressive symptoms in\nold age may be accounted for by the inclusion of somatic\nsymptoms on depressive symptom checklists, because many\nsomatic symptoms of depression are also commonly found in\nnondepressed older individuals who are physically ill. The\nanswer may depend on the measure used. Compared with\nyounger adults, older adults endorsed disproportionately more\nsomatic than nonsomatic items on several instruments (e.g.,\nBolla-Wilson & Bleecker, 1989) but not on the Center for\nEpidemiologic Studies\u00adDepression (CES-D) scale (e.g., Kess-\nBeyond characterizing age-related trends in depressive\nsymptoms, many authors have examined covariates to test the\nextent to which age-related patterns might be explained by\nother variables. Health status consistently predicts depressive\nsymptoms in cross-sectional studies of older adults (e.g., Kraaij,\nArensman, & Spinhoven, 2002). Longitudinal investigations,\nin contrast, have yielded mixed results. Although numerous\ninvestigators report that health at one time point predicts the\nemergence of a clinically significant level of depressive symp-\ntoms at the next (e.g., Geerlings, Beekman, Deeg, & Van\nWallace & O'Hara, 1992), studies controlling not only for\nbaseline depressive symptoms but also for baseline health status\nhave not found additional longitudinal effects of change in\nhealth on depressive symptoms (Dent et al., 1999; Henderson\net al., 1997). Therefore, although there is much evidence that\nhealth status is related to depressive symptoms in late life, it is\nnot clear whether change in health is associated with change in\ndepressive symptoms.\nThe relationship between health status and depressive\nsymptoms in late life may be reciprocal (e.g., Meeks, Murrell, &\nMehl, 2000). Recent research in mixed age samples shows\nthat both depressive disorders and depressive symptoms predict\nlater development of specific medical conditions, particularly\ncardiovascular disease (reviewed by Musselman, Evans, &\nAnother focus in the study of late life depressive symptoms\nhas been the role of negative life events. Prior research has\nyielded mixed findings. A meta-analysis of cross-sectional re-\nsearch concluded that the total number of negative life events is\nJournal of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES Copyright 2003 by The Gerontological Society of America\ncorrelated with depressive symptoms in older adults, although\nthe effect is modest (r \u00bc .15; Kraaij et al., 2002). Notably,\nhowever, several large, population-based studies in older adults\nhave found no association (e.g., Beekman et al., 1995). In\na prospective study, Glass, Kasl, and Berkman (1997) found\nthat life events predicted depressive symptoms. Life events may\nhave a time-limited effect, lasting less than 6 months (Norris &\nThe relationship between life events and depressive symp-\ntoms may also be reciprocal. Several researchers have found,\nprimarily among younger adults, that depressive status predicts\nfuture life events (e.g., Daley et al., 1997), which is consistent\nwith Hammen's (1991) stress-generation hypothesis. We found\nno studies that examined this question specifically in older\nadults.\nThus, existing empirical literature suggests that depressive\nsymptoms increase with age. There is ample evidence that\nhealth status is associated with depressive symptoms in late life,\nbut longitudinal evidence that declining health explains in-\ncreasing depressive symptoms is thus far lacking. Prior research\nalso supports the conclusion that life events may lead to\ndepressive symptoms among older adults, although the effect\nmay be weak and time limited.\nThe present study tested several hypotheses regarding age\nand depression. Our first hypothesis was that depressive\nsymptoms would increase between midlife and old age,\nlongitudinally as well as cross-sectionally, and that the increase\nwould not be fully explained by comorbid physical illness. We\nfurther hypothesized that both declining health and non-health-\nrelated negative life events would explain longitudinal in-\ncreases in depressive symptoms.\nMETHODS\nSample\nData for this study were collected as part of the Swedish\nAdoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA; Pedersen et al.,\n1991), which is a subset of the population-based Swedish\nTwin Registry (Lichtenstein et al., 2002). The base sample\nfor SATSA was composed of all pairs of twins in the registry\nwho were reared apart and matched twins who were reared to-\ngether. The 2,845 surviving individuals from these pairs were\ncontacted in 1984 by means of a mailed questionnaire.\nResponses were received from 2,018 individuals (71% response\nrate). Three additional questionnaires were mailed at 3-year\nintervals to all surviving members who had not asked to\ndiscontinue participation in the study. The latter three\nquestionnaires were used in the current study (referred to as\nTime 3. The proportion of surviving, prior-wave respondents\nwho participated at each time point was high (81% at Time\nwere received at each wave from individuals who had not\nparticipated in prior waves. Among those who responded at\nTime 1, 12% had died by the end of the study, a further 13%\ndropped out of the study, and 5% skipped Time 2 but resumed\nat Time 3; thus, 70% of the sample completed questionnaires at\nall three times (1,148). Of these respondents, 89% completed\nthe CES-D portion of the questionnaire, yielding a sample of\n1,017 individuals for longitudinal analyses. Sample sizes for\nindividual analyses were reduced somewhat by missing data on\ncovariates.\nAlthough data for the current study were gathered from\ntwins, pairs were randomly divided into two samples of\nunrelated individuals to satisfy the assumption of independent\nobservations for statistical purposes. Sample 1 is the primary\nsample for analysis. Sample 2 serves as a nonindependent\nreplication. Results are given for Sample 1. Except where\nnoted, Sample 2 results were similar. For some analyses, the\nsample was divided into middle-aged (,60 years) and older\nThe mean age of the participants was 60 years (range \u00bc 29\u00ad\nattainment was low, reflecting the socioeconomic situation in\nSweden experienced by this cohort (58% completed or attended\nelementary school; 27% went to O-level, trade, or folk school;\n8% attended academic high school; and 7% attended a univer-\nsity). All participants were Caucasian.\nBy design, half the twins in SATSA were separated early in\nlife. To determine whether rearing status might bias results, we\nperformed an analysis of variance. We found few differences.\nTwins reared apart had slightly higher illness scores at one time\nfindings were not replicated in the second sample. Twins reared\napart did not differ from twins reared together on CES-D\nscores, age, or gender.\nInstruments\nCES-D. --The CES-D is a widely used self-report measure of\ndepressive symptoms (Radloff, 1977). Respondents rate how\noften they experienced each of 20 symptoms within the past\nweek on a 0\u00ad3 scale, with four items that are reverse scored.\nReliability and validity of the scale have been demonstrated in\nmixed age and older adult samples (e.g., Beekman et al., 1997).\nItems were translated into Swedish for the SATSA project,\nand they were backtranslated by a different individual to ensure\nthe original meanings were retained. The CES-D scale has\ndemonstrated measurement invariance across older and youn-\nger participants in the SATSA data set (Gatz, Johansson,\nPedersen, Berg, & Reynolds, 1993). It is highly internally\nconsistent; Cronbach's alpha was .89 at each wave.\nHealth. --We measured health status in two ways: current\nillnesses and new illnesses. Participants were asked whether\nthey have or have had each of 38 medical conditions.\nSymptoms of angina, myocardial infarct, claudication, chronic\nbronchitis, and asthma were also assessed, and diagnostic\nalgorithms were applied to supplement the list of medical\nconditions endorsed. The current illness scale was a weighted\nsum of illnesses endorsed (or inferred by diagnostic algorithm).\nThe new illness scale was a subset of the current illness\nmeasure, including only illnesses that had not been reported at\na prior wave (including the 1984 questionnaire not otherwise\nused in the current study). Weighting was based on ratings by\na panel of seven physicians of likely disability that would result\nfrom each condition. Agreement among raters was reasonable,\nwith at least five of the seven doctors agreeing on the majority\nof items. If one or more items were missing, the entire scale\nwas considered missing, resulting in missing scores for 7% of\nindividuals who completed the CES-D scale. Older adults more\nfrequently reported most cardiovascular disorders, metabolic\ndisorders, ulcers, urinary tract disorders, and shingles, whereas\nmiddle-aged adults more frequently reported migraines.\nLife events. --Life events were measured at each wave with\na version of the Holmes and Rahe Social Readjustment Rating\nScale (Holmes & Rahe, 1967) that was modified for use with\nolder adults (Persson, 1980). For each of 14 events, participants\nrated whether it had occurred and, if it had, whether it was of\nlittle, some, or great importance. The present study included\nonly negative items, non-health-related events (to create a scale\ncomplementary to the illness scales), and items that did not\nprimarily reflect mental illness in the participant (to avoid\nconfounding life events and depressive symptom scales). The\nscale only included events not reported at the preceding wave\n(or any prior wave for death of a child, death of a spouse, and\nplacement of spouse in an institution). Responses to divorce\nand widowhood items were augmented with demographic\ninformation. The total scale score is the sum of item scores,\nweighted by mean importance ratings across the entire sample.\nMissing items were imputed by using the sample item mean.\nIf more than two items were missing, a total scale score was\nnot computed. The most frequent event reported for both\nage groups was deterioration in financial status. Most events\nthat differed in frequency were reported more often in older\nparticipants (including deterioration in financial status, death or\nillness in relatives or friends, and caregiving), supporting the\nintent of the scale, which was designed for use with older\nadults. Only divorce was more frequent in middle-aged adults.\nAnalysis\nWe tested our first hypothesis, that depressive symptoms\nwould increase with age, by using both cross-sectional (linear\nregression) and longitudinal (repeated measures analysis of\nvariance) analyses. Because we anticipated the greatest age\ndifferences in the oldest ages, we tested for quadratic (age2)\nas well as linear effects. To determine whether increases in\ndepressive symptoms could be an artifact of counting symp-\ntoms of physical illness, we tested specifically for changes in\nthree of the four CES-D subscales validated in previous work\n(e.g., Gatz, Johansson, Pedersen, Berg, & Reynolds, 1993;\nHertzog, Van Alstine, Usala, Hultsch, & Dixon, 1990). The\npsychomotor retardation subscale includes lack of motivation\nand somatic symptoms of depression. The depressed mood\nsubscale includes affective symptoms. The lack of well-being\nsubscale is a reverse-scored measure of positive affect. A fourth\nsubscale, interpersonal difficulties, was not used because of its\nweak association with the overall scale (Hertzog et al., 1990).\nWe tested for Age3Gender interactions in both cross-sectional\nand longitudinal analyses.\nBefore testing our hypothesis that declining health and other\nnegative life events would each predict change in depressive\nsymptoms over time, we first examined the combined and\nindependent effects of current illnesses and negative life events\non depressive symptoms by using a series of multivariate linear\nregression models. We then tested the hypothesis by using\nstructural equation modeling (with Mx structural equation\nmodeling software; Neale, 1999). For each variable, we first\ntested whether the longitudinal data were best represented by\na simplex pattern (specifying a transmission path, which allows\nfor stronger correlations between adjacent compared with distal\ntime points), a common factor model (correlations between\ntime points that do not follow the simplex pattern), or a model\nassuming no correlation between time points. A nonsignificant\nv2 was taken to indicate absolute model fit, whereas the\nAkaike's information criterion (AIC) statistic was used to\ndetermine the best model on the basis of both fit and parsimony.\nWe then tested a series of cross-lagged longitudinal models.\nAnalyses other than structural equation modeling used SAS\nsoftware (Version 8.02, SAS, Cary, NC).\nRESULTS\nDescription\nCES-D and current illness scores were highest for older\nparticipants and women at each time point. Life event scores\nwere also highest in the older group, particularly among older\nwomen (Table 1). Correlations between age and CES-D were\nsignificant but modest (Table 2). Current and new illnesses, as\nwell as non-health-related life events, were significantly\ncorrelated with CES-D scores.\nDo Depressive Symptoms Increase With Age?\nIn cross-sectional analyses, CES-D scores were higher in\nolder participants after gender effects were adjusted for. Linear\nage differences were significant at all three waves; that is, Time\nsignificant as well. No interaction was found between age and\ngender. Total variance explained was relatively small, that is,\nLongitudinally, there was a significant interaction between\nTherefore, we performed analyses separately by age group.\nand p , .01, but not in the middle-aged group, which is\nconsistent with the right-hand portion of the U-shaped curve\nreported in earlier studies. The mean CES-D score among older\nparticipants increased 1.6 points over 6 years. There were no\ninteractions between time and gender, indicating that rates of\nchange in depressive symptoms over time did not differ\nsignificantly between men and women.\nWe next considered age changes in subscales as a way of\ntesting whether increases in CES-D scores could be explained\nby physical illness. As would be expected, the psychomotor\nretardation subscale, which includes symptoms that could\nreflect physical illness, was higher in older respondents in\ncross-sectional analyses adjusting for sex. That is, Time 1,\nincreases were significant only among older participants at\nincreases were significant in both age groups.\nHowever, depressed mood subscale scores also increased\nanalyses indicated significant increases in the older group only,\nSample 2, depressed mood scores increased significantly with\ntime in middle-aged participants and there was a nonsignificant\ntrend in the older group (results not shown).\nLack of well-being showed no consistent age differences in\ncross-sectional or longitudinal analyses and no gender differences.\nAre Illnesses or Life Events Associated\nWith Depressive Symptoms?\nBecause depressive symptoms increased with age, we next\ntested the extent to which current illnesses and non-health-related\nnegative life events could explain the increases. In hierarchical\nlinear regression, both current illnesses and non-health-related\nevents were significant independent predictors of CES-D score at\neach wave, when sex was controlled for (Table 3 shows Wave 1).\nThe additional variance explained by life events, beyond that\npredicted by current illnesses, provides further evidence that age\ndifferences are not solely due to comorbid physical illness. As\nseen in Table 3 (Eq. 5), age remained a significant predictor\nof CES-D score after covariates were adjusted for. Thus, age\ndifferences are greatly but not completely explained by a com-\nbination of current health status and negative life events.\nDo New Illnesses or Life Events Explain Longitudinal\nChanges in Depressive Symptoms?\nThe next hypothesis was that new illnesses and non-health-\nrelated life events would each significantly predict longitudinal\nchange in depressive symptoms. In preliminary analyses, we\ndetermined that both a simplex and a common factor model fit\nthe longitudinal CES-D data in Sample 1: simplex, v2(1) \u00bc\nand AIC \u00bc \u00ff3.19. In Sample 2, however, the common factor\n1.04. Thus, the simplex model was chosen for CES-D data in\nthe multivariate model. The common factor model fit the\nnew illness data, v2(2) \u00bc 2.81, ns, whereas the simplex did not,\nSample 2. Neither model fit the life event data. Therefore, a\nmultivariate cross-lagged model was fit that combined the sim-\nplex model for CES-D data and the common factor model for\nnew illness, with life events specified as unrelated influences\nat each time point.\nTable 1.

New illnesses at Times 2 and 3 include current illnesses not reported at a prior wave or on the 1984 questionnaire.\nEstimated path coefficients for the full model (Table 4, M0)\nare included in Figure 1. A series of models was fit to test for\nsignificance of directional paths by examining loss of fit (\u00c1v2)\nwhen sets of paths were dropped from the model (Table 4).\nIn Twin 1, new illnesses did not predict depressive symptoms\nat the next time of measurement (M2 \u00ff M0), and depressive\nsymptoms did not predict new illnesses (M1\u00ffM0). The pattern\nof path coefficients indicates that (a) depressive symptoms are\nhighly stable across time points, with few new influences\nbeyond Time 1; (b) new illnesses also show stability, with a\ncommon process influencing occurrence of new illnesses; and\n(c) the only indication of an association between illness and\nCES-D score was at the first time point. In separate models in\nmiddle-aged and older participants, as in the full sample, new\nillnesses did not predict depressive symptoms and depressive\nsymptoms did not predict new illnesses. In Sample 2, in\ncontrast, new illnesses did significantly predict depressive\nsymptom scores and vice versa. Notably, as in Sample 1, the\nstrongest association between new illnesses in the past 3 years\nand CES-D score occurred at the first time point, suggesting\nthat these findings reflect, to some extent, the baseline cor-\nrelation between the measures rather than a truly prospective\neffect. This interpretation is consistent with results we obtained\nin additional cross-lagged longitudinal models we fit testing the\nrelationship between current illnesses and CES-D score (results\nnot shown). In those models, the relationship between current\nillness and CES-D score was fully explained by baseline\ncorrelation in both Samples 1 and 2, with no significant paths\nfrom illness to later CES-D score or from CES-D score to later\nillness.\nNegative life events within the past 3 years predicted cur-\nrent depressive symptoms (Table 4, M4 \u00ff M0). In addition,\ndepressive symptoms predicted negative life events at the next\ntime of measurement (M3 \u00ff M0). Results were replicated in\nTwin 2. A multigroup model showed no age group differences.\nTo aid in interpreting the finding that illness was only an\ninconsistent predictor of depressive symptoms, we tested post\nhoc whether illness would predict ``incidence'' or ``persistence''\nof clinically significant depressive symptoms. Incidence, which\nwas examined in participants with baseline CES-D scores\nbelow 16, was defined as an increase of at least 5 points in\nCES-D score to a level of 16 or greater at either Time 2 or Time\n3. Persistence, examined in participants with baseline CES-D\nscores of 16 or greater, was defined as a CES-D score of 16\nor greater at Times 2 and 3. In logistic regression analyses,\nbaseline current illness scores predicted incidence, that is,\n(CI) \u00bc (1.00, 1.14), but did not significantly predict persistence,\nanalyses, effects were small.\nDISCUSSION\nThis 6-year longitudinal study, with its large, population-\nbased sample, provides evidence of modest increases in\ndepressive symptoms with age for both men and women,\nparticularly for older participants. Increases in CES-D scores do\nnot occur only on somatic symptoms and are not entirely an\nTable 2.

Together, current health\nstatus and non-health-related life events explain most of the\nrelationship between age and depressive symptoms. Although\ncurrent illnesses predicted depressive symptoms cross-section-\nally, we found only inconsistent support for the hypothesis\nthat new illnesses increase depressive symptoms over time.\nNon-health-related negative life events, in contrast, do affect\ndepressive symptoms and depressive symptoms also affect later\nnegative life events.\nThe longitudinal increase in CES-D scores in the present\nsample demonstrates that cross-sectional results in other studies\n(e.g., Kessler et al., 1992) cannot be explained fully by cohort\neffects; rather, they represent within-person change over time.\nResults extend the findings of Wallace and O'Hara (1992) and\nRothermund and Brandtsta\nage ranges. The current findings support the right-hand portion\nof the U-shaped curvilinear relationship between CES-D score\nand age found in other studies (e.g., Kessler et al., 1992), as\nlongitudinal increases were found only in older participants.\nAge-related increases seen in the current study have not been\nconsistently detected in the few other longitudinal studies,\nperhaps because effects are modest and may not be reliably\ndetected with smaller samples or shorter follow-up periods. It\nshould be noted that the magnitude of increase in depressive\nsymptoms does not imply clinically significant increases in\ndepression among most older adults. Rather, the mean increase\nof 1.6 points over 6 years is equivalent to reporting a slightly\nincreased frequency of one or two symptoms.\nAlthough some have suggested that increasing depressive\nsymptoms with age may largely reflect comorbid physical illness\n(Bolla-Wilson & Bleeker, 1989), this is not true in the current\nstudy. Age effects remained in the cross-sectional analyses after\nillnesses were controlled for. Furthermore, age differences were\nfound on both mood and psychomotor retardation subscales.\nDespite a growing literature suggesting that the gender gap\nin levels of depressive symptoms may narrow with age (e.g.,\nBarefoot et al., 2001), neither our cross-sectional nor our\nlongitudinal results supported this conclusion. Our findings are\nconsistent with others (e.g., Kessler et al., 1992) who have\nfound higher levels of depressive symptoms among women\nthan men throughout late life.\nThe use of both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses\nenabled us to gain a more complete picture of the relationship\nbetween health status and depressive symptoms than has been\npossible in studies limited to cross-sectional samples. Con-\nsistent with existing literature, current health status was\nsignificantly associated with depressive symptoms in cross-\nsectional analyses. Longitudinal results, however, provided\nonly inconsistent support for the prediction that increases in\ndepressive symptoms would be predicted by health events, as\neffects were small and not significant in both samples. A\nconsistent finding, however, is that depressive symptoms were\nhighly stable and the relationship between depressive symp-\ntoms and health was evident at the outset. These analyses\nand results are similar to those in the report by Meeks and\nfound that baseline health predicted incidence of clinically\nsignificant depressive symptoms. Unlike Geerlings and col-\nleagues, we found that baseline illness did not predict persistent\ndepressive symptoms. However, Geerlings and associates noted\nthat health status did not predict a course marked by frequent\nfluctuations within a 3-year interval. These results raise the\nquestion of whether short-term fluctuation about a stable CES-\nD score could have occurred undetected in our study with its 3-\nyear measurement intervals. Then, lack of consistent support\nfor the hypothesis that change in illnesses would predict change\nin depressive symptoms could stem largely from high levels of\nmeasured stability of depressive symptoms.\nThe stability of depressive symptoms was particularly\nimpressive when we consider the nature of the scale, which\nassesses for symptoms over the past week. Although depressive\nsymptoms are thought to reflect a state, this study and others\n(e.g., Rothermund & Brandtsta\nindicate an underlying trait. The stability may also reflect the\ncontinuity of depressive symptoms commonly found prodromal\nto, or persistent following, a depressive episode (Fava, 1999).\nA notable finding of the current study is the lack of inter-\naction between age and health, indicating that health is not\nmore important in predicting depressive symptoms in late life\nthan it is earlier in life. Although health status has often been\ncited as a particularly prominent risk factor for depressive\nsymptoms in old age, current results indicate that health status\nassumes a larger role with age primarily as a result of the\nincreasing frequency of health problems.\nThe current results offer new insights into the relation-\nship between negative life events and depressive symptoms.\nLongitudinally, direct effects of life events did not carry over\nbeyond the 3-year measurement interval, suggesting recovery\nand supporting the findings of previous research that indicates\nshort-lived effects for life events (e.g., Norris & Murrell, 1987).\nThere may be indirect effects, however, because change in\ndepressive symptoms also predicted later life events and thus\na recursive cycle may develop in which negative events and\ndepressive states become self-perpetuating.\nThe finding that depressive symptoms predicted later life\nevents is intriguing and has not, to our knowledge, been\nTable 4.

In addition, a handful of investigators have found\nthat depressive diagnosis or depressive symptoms predict later\nstressful events in younger samples (e.g., Daley et al., 1997).\nThe current results support Hammen's (1991) stress-generation\nmodel, which predicts that some of the stressful events that\nbefall depressed individuals--in particular, events associated\nwith interpersonal conflict--are directly attributable to their\nown characteristics and behaviors and the contexts in which\nthey live. Poor social functioning, observed among individuals\nwith elevated depressive symptoms (see Fava, 1999), may\npartly explain this effect.\nLimitations of the Study\nThe original scale on which our life event measure was\nbased, the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS), has been\nthe subject of criticism (e.g., Chiriboga, 1989), although\nadjustments for the present study mitigate concerns. The SRRS\nremains a widely used self-report checklist of stressful events,\nhowever, and has repeatedly demonstrated utility in predicting\ndistress (Scully, Tosi, & Banning, 2000).\nBecause life events were reported retrospectively, it is\npossible that current depressive symptoms may have biased the\nreporting of past events. Nonetheless, the finding that depres-\nsive symptoms affect future life events was based on prospective\ndata.\nAs in any longitudinal study, selective attrition is a concern.\nAttrition analyses tested whether death or dropout from the\nstudy was predicted by CES-D score. With a link to the\nSwedish Death Register, we determined that death accounted\nfor nearly half of study attrition. Individuals who died or\ndropped out had higher baseline CES-D scores than those who\ncompleted all three times. Attrition could not be explained by\ndepressive symptom levels, however, because it was better\nFigure 1.

Other investigators have concluded\nthat such attrition may affect descriptive results but have little\nimpact on findings regarding association between variables\n(e.g., Kempen & van Sonderen, 2002). In the current study, the\nmain result of such a pattern of attrition would be to under-\nestimate age-related increases in depressive symptoms.\nSeveral findings differed between Samples 1 and 2.\nLongitudinal changes in psychomotor retardation and de-\npressed mood symptoms showed different patterns of signif-\nicance across samples. Because the magnitude of longitudinal\nchange in CES-D scores was small (1.6 points over 6 years), it\nis not surprising that effects were not consistently significant. In\nthe same way, new illnesses did not significantly predict\ndepressive symptoms longitudinally in Sample 1, but they did\nin Sample 2. Differences may reflect the small magnitude of\neffects. It is notable that, longitudinally, the non-health-related\nlife event score was a much stronger predictor of depressive\nsymptoms than was the new illness score, even in Sample 2.\nThus, lack of consistency in certain findings across samples\nhighlights the small magnitude of these particular effects.\nSome may question the use of twins. The fact that SATSA\ntwins are similar in health and sociological characteristics to\na cross section of the Swedish population of the same age\n(Pedersen et al., 2002) suggests that use of this data set to test\nnon-twin research questions is appropriate. Further, this large,\npopulation-based, longitudinal data set offers advantages over\nother longitudinal studies published to date.\nConclusions\nIn summary, we conclude that depressive symptoms increase\nslightly with age and that the increase is not merely a cohort\neffect or an artifact of measuring symptoms of comorbid\nphysical illness. Certain negative life events, which are reported\nmore frequently in late life, explain some of the increases in\ndepressive symptoms. Physical illnesses, which also become\nmore common in late life, are correlated with depressive symp-\ntoms, but new illnesses only inconsistently predict change in\ndepressive symptoms over time.\n"
