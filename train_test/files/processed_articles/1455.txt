LaVeist1,2\nBackground\nSocial support is an important determinant of health, yet\nunderstanding of its contribution to racial disparities in\nhypertension is limited. Many studies have focused on the\nrelationship between hypertension and social support, or\nrace/ethnicity and social support, but few have examined the\ninter-relationship between race/ethnicity, social support, and\nhypertension.The objective of this study was to determine\nwhether the relationship between race/ethnicity and hypertension\nvaried by level of social support.\nMethods\nData from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nthe association between hypertension and race/ethnicity by levels of\nsocial support. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure\n(BP) 140mmHg and/or diastolic BP 90mmHg or having been\nprescribed antihypertensive medication. Social support was defined\nby emotional and financial support, and marital status.\nResults\nBlack/white ORs of hypertension increased as social support\ndecreased; that is, the race difference among those without\nsocial support was larger compared to those with social support.\nContrarily, Mexican American/white ethnic differences were only\nobserved among those with social support; Mexican Americans\nwith social support had lower odds of hypertension than their white\ncounterparts.\nConclusions\nThis study observed that the relationship between race (but not\nethnicity) and hypertension varies by social support level. Results\nsuggest there may be beneficial effects of social support on\nhypertension among blacks, however, the possible impact of social\nsupport on ethnic differences in hypertension remains unclear.\nKeywords:bloodpressure;hypertension;psychosocialfactors;\nRace/ethnicity;socialsupport\noriginal contributions\nRace/Ethnicity, Hypertension, and Social Support\nrace and hypertension may be weaker among those with\nsocial support as compared to those without social support.\nConversely, because the prevalence of hypertension among\nMexican Americans is lower compared to whites,27 ethnic\n\ndifferences will be greatest among those with social support;\nthat is, the odds of hypertension should be lowest among\nMexican Americans with the most social support, thus the\nMexican-American/white odds ratio (OR) of hypertension\nshould be lowest among those with the most social support\nand should approach one as social support decreases. Hence,\nthe objective of this study is to determine whether the associa-\ntion between race (black vs. white) and hypertension, and eth-\nnicity (Mexican American vs. white) and hypertension varies\nby level of social support. Specifically, it is hypothesized that\nthe race differences in hypertension will be attenuated among\nthose with social support as compared to those without social\nsupport, and ethnic differences will be greater among those\nwith social support compared to those without social support.\nMethods\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) is an ongoing nationally representative survey\nof the health, functional, and nutritional statuses of the US\npopulation. Each sequential series of this cross-sectional sur-\nvey samples the civilian noninstitutionalized population, with\nan oversample of low-income individuals, participants aged\nbetween 12 and 19 years, adults over the age of 60 years, blacks,\nand Mexican Americans.31 This survey uses a stratified, multi-\nstage probability sampling design where data are collected\nin two phases. First, information regarding the participant's\nhealth history, health behaviors, and risk factors is obtained\nduring a home interview. Then participants are invited to take\npart in a medical examination where they receive a detailed\nphysical examination.32 Social support questions were only\nasked of participants aged 40 years, therefore, data from 2001\nto 2006 were combined, excluded those missing BP meas-\nurements and consisted of 5,593 non-Hispanic black, non-\nHispanic white (hereafter referred to as black and white), and\nMexican-American adults.\nStudy variables. Hypertension was defined as systolic BP\n140mmHg and/or diastolic BP 90mmHg or currently tak-\ning antihypertensive medication. Hypertension was measured\nfollowing NHANES protocol by calculating average BP, exclud-\ning the first measurement.32 For whites and blacks, race was\nassessed by the response to the question, \"What race do you\nconsider yourself to be?\" Mexican American respondents were\nincluded if they considered themselves Hispanic/Latino and\nbeing Mexican American represented their Hispanic origin or\nancestry. Social support was assessed by emotional support,\nfinancial support, and marital status. Emotional support was\nassessed by the following: \"Can you count on anyone to pro-\nvide you with emotional support such as talking over problems\nor helping you make a difficult decision?\" (responses were yes,\nno, \"don't need help\"). Financial support was assessed by the\nfollowing: \"If you need some extra help financially, could you\ncount on anyone to help you; for example, by paying any bills,\nhousing costs, hospital visits, or providing you with food or\nclothes?\" (responses were yes, no, \"offered help but wouldn't\naccept it\"). A categorical variable was created to represent hav-\ning both emotional and financial support (yes to both social\nsupport measures), either form of social support (yes to one,\nbut not both measures of social support), and neither form\nof social support (no to both measures). Sensitivity analyses\nwere performed to determine the effect of including those who\nrefused to respond, were uncertain of, or did not need/would\nnot accept support (n = 215) in the \"Neither\" group, and deter-\nmined these persons to be meaningful. Social support was also\nassessed by current marital status (yes/no).\nDemographic variables included age (years) and gender (1 =\nmale; 0 = female). SES was assessed using binary variables for\n$75,000), and education categories (less than high school\ngraduate, high school graduate or general equivalency diploma\nequivalent recipient, more than high school education).\nHealth-related characteristics included having health insur-\nance (1 = yes; 0 = no), diabetes (1 = yes; 0 = no), obesity (1 =\nbody mass index (BMI)  30; 0 = BMI < 30), fair/poor health\n(1 = yes; 0 = no), and physical inactivity (1 = not regularly\nphysically active; 0 = regularly physically active).\nData analysis strategy. The mean and proportional differences\nbetween race/ethnic groups for demographic, SES, and health-\nrelated characteristics were evaluated using Student's t-tests for\ncontinuous variables and 2-tests for categorical variables. The\nodds of hypertension among blacks and Mexican Americans\ncompared to whites were calculated using logistic regres-\nsion models controlling for demographic, SES, health-related\ncharacteristics (Model 1). Analyses additionally controlled\nfor emotional and financial support (Model 2), and marital\n\nstatus (Model 3) to determine the effect of these social support\nmeasures on the race/ethnic ORs of hypertension. Analyses to\ndetermine whether social support modified the effect of race/\nethnicity on hypertension were performed using multiplica-\ntive interaction terms.33 If interaction was detected, race and\nethnic differences in odds of hypertension were determined\nwithin levels of social support, that is, among those with both,\neither/or and neither/nor emotional and financial support,\nand among married and unmarried persons. Following the\nprocedure recommended by the National Center for Health\nStatistics,34 all analyses used Taylor-linearization procedures\nfor the complex multistage sampling design and a weight vari-\nable was created to account for combining multiple years of\nNHANES. P values <0.05 were considered statistically signifi-\ncant and all t-tests were two-sided. All statistical procedures\nwere performed using STATA statistical software, version 10\n(StataCorp, College Station, TX).\nResults\nTable 1 displays the distribution of select demographics and\nhealth-related characteristics by race/ethnicity.

Compared to whites,\na greater percentage of blacks were hypertensive (60.1% vs.\nand whites had a similar distribution of emotional and finan-\ncial support, whereas Mexican Americans were less likely\nto have both emotional and financial support than whites\n(P < 0.001).

However, race differences did not\nvary by marital status.\nAmong Mexican Americans, ethnic differences in hyper-\ntension were only observed among those with the most social\nsupport. Mexican Americans with both emotional and finan-\ncial support were less likely to be hypertensive than their white\ngroups, the Mexican-American/white OR of hypertension was\nnot significant, but there seems to be a downward trend. The\nethnic OR of hypertension was significant among married per-\nsons but not among unmarried persons.\nDiscussion\nThere is abundant evidence demonstrating race/ethnic dif-\nferences in hypertension.1\u00ad3,27 Social support is also a well-\nthe inter-relationships among race/ethnicity, hypertension,\nand social support have not been clearly explicated. It was\nhypothesized that race differences in the odds of hyperten-\nsion would decrease as social support increased, and ethnic\ndifferences would increase as social support increased. The\nfindings of this study indicate that race differences in hyper-\ntension were reduced among those who received both emo-\ntional and financial support compared to those who received\nneither of these, consistent with the study hypothesis.\nHowever, race differences did not vary by marital status. As\nhypothesized, Mexican Americans with both forms of social\nsupport had lower odds of hypertension than their white\ncounterparts, whereas ethnic differences were not observed\namong those with either emotional or financial support or\nthose with neither emotional nor financial support. Ethnic\ndifferences were observed among married but not unmarried\npersons. However, the interactions between neither social\nsupport and ethnicity nor marital status and ethnicity were\nsignificant.\nOther studies examining the inter-relationship of race,\nhypertension, and social support are few. One study examined\nrace differences in self-reported hypertension controlling for\nsocial support and found that social support explained only\n3% of the effect of race on hypertension,24 as in the present\nstudy (Table 2); however, they did not stratify by social sup-\nport. In contrast, another study found that the unadjusted\nTable 2| Association between race/ethnicity, social support and hypertension among adults aged 40 years,NHANES 2001\u00ad2006\nRace/ethnicity\nIncome\nEducation\nEmotionalandfinancialsupport\nCI, confidence interval; GED, general equivalency diploma; OR, odds ratio.\noriginal contributions Race/Ethnicity, Hypertension, and Social Support\nodds of hypertension were significantly greater among persons\n\nwithout social support compared to persons with social sup-\nport in black and white adults.10 After adjusting for covariates,\nthere was no relationship between social support and hyper-\ntension for whites, but social support remained a significant\npredictor among blacks. Though the methodology between\nthis study and the present study differ, they both demonstrate\nthat social support is an important factor in the relationship\nbetween race and hypertension.\nWhen examining race differences by social support, the\nblack/white OR decreased as emotional and financial sup-\nport increased. The larger race OR among those with neither\nform of social support is likely due to the decreased odds of\nhypertension among whites with neither emotional nor finan-\ncial support. Whites in the neither group had decreased odds\nof hypertension (Table 3) only when whites who responded\nthat they did not need emotional support or would not accept\nfinancial support were included in the neither group. Thus,\nwhites who responded that they did not need or would not\naccept support had lower odds of hypertension than whites\nwho reported having both forms of support. The literature\nfinds little evidence for a negative effect of social support on\nhealth,12 but there is no research on possible positive effects\nof not needing or wanting social support. To further compli-\ncate these results, it is unknown whether those persons who\nresponded that they did not need or would not accept social\nsupport actually have those resources, but do not acknowledge\nthem.\nTwo theories, main effects and buffering effects, have been\nused to describe how social support is related to health. The\nmain effects of social support find a direct beneficial effect on\nhealth by lowering BP or influencing health behaviors such as\nexercise, and sleep or eating habits.11,12 The buffering hypoth-\nesis finds that social support is beneficial to health only when\nstress threatens health, that is, social support buffers against\nthe deleterious effects of stress on health.11,12 Because lower\nodds of hypertension were associated with not needing or\nwanting social support among whites, this may suggest buff-\nering effects of social support rather than main effects. The\nmain effects theory of social support intrinsically relies on the\nnotion that health and social support are positively related. It is\nonly within the paradigm of the buffering hypothesis of social\nsupport that the results of this study can be interpreted; how-\never, because stress was not included in this study, testing the\nbuffering hypothesis could not be done.\nEven more paradoxical is the relationship between social\nsupport and hypertension among blacks. Because the\nTable 3| Interaction between measures of social support and\nEmotional and\nfinancial support Marital status\n Social support\n Both -- --\n Black race \u00d7 social support\n Black race \u00d7 both -- --\n\nMexican-American\nethnicity\n Social support\n Both -- --\n\nMexican-American\nethnicity \u00d7 social support\n\nMexican-American\nethnicity \u00d7 both\n-- --\n\nMexican-American\nethnicity \u00d7 either\n\nMexican-American\nethnicity \u00d7 neither\n\nMexican-American\nethnicity\n\nMexican-American\nethnicity \u00d7 unmarried\nAdjusted for age, gender, income, education, insurance, self-rated health, diabetes,\nobesity, and physical inactivity.

Though this is contrary to some studies,10 it may give\nsome insight into social support mechanisms. Blacks are dis-\nproportionately represented in lower SES groups and are more\nlikely to experience discrimination, be exposed to stressful sit-\nuations and live under adverse conditions.35,36 These may lead\nto experiences of chronic stress among blacks.35,36 Indeed,\nstudies have found that blacks exhibit higher levels of physi-\nologic response to stress than whites.37 If blacks experience\nstressors constantly, the buffering effects of social support may\nbe ineffective.\nContrary to other studies, Mexican Americans received less\nsocial support than whites, thus the effects of social support\non ethnic differences may be masked. Also, other factors such\nas support from family vs. friends may have yielded results\nmore similar to the literature. 29 In light of this, the relation-\nship between ethnicity and hypertension appears not to differ\nby level of social support. Studies have shown that discrimi-\nnation stress is associated with health only among Mexican\nAmericans with low levels of social support,30 indicating a\nprotective effect. Though Mexican Americans may experience\nconstant stressors such as lower SES environments and accul-\nturative stress,30 the mechanism by which Mexican Americans\ninterpret and deal with stressors (here, by social support) may\ndiffer from blacks and may not differ from whites.\nThis study advances our understanding of race/ethnic dif-\nferences in hypertension by highlighting the importance of\nsocial support on the relationship between race/ethnicity and\nhypertension. By combining emotional and financial support,\nand assessing the influence of marital status, the study uses\nmore than one measure of social support which is consistent\nwith theory that suggests that social support is obtained from\na number of sources, in a number of ways.38 Moreover, this\nstudy is one of few that uses marital status to assess the race/\nethnic differences in hypertension in a nationally representa-\ntive sample.25 The results of this study should be considered\nwithin the context of some limitations. In NHANES 2001\u00ad\nsocial support. Social support has been found to be related to\nFuture studies that include these persons in surveys that assess\nsocial support would be useful. Although both emotional and\nfinancial support were assessed, satisfaction with social sup-\nport (such as marital quality), which has been linked to health\nas well,12 could not be assessed. Family vs. friend support could\nnot be assessed using this data set, which may be important\nbecause race and ethnic differences in sources of support have\nand smoking status rendered interaction analyses insignifi-\ncant. However, because alcohol use and smoking status were\nnot related to hypertension or social support, these variables\nwere not included in the analyses. Furthermore, NHANES\noversamples only Mexican Americans among Hispanics, and\ndata on other Hispanic subgroups is not publicly available.\nIt is unknown whether these relationships are true for other\nHispanic subgroups.\nThis study observed that the relationship between race and\nhypertension varies by social support level, although this\nvariation was not seen for ethnicity. The results of this study\nsuggest there may be beneficial effects of social support on\nhypertension among blacks, but the observed decrease in\nblack/white ORs with an increase in social support may be\ndue to the relationship between social support and hyperten-\nsion among whites, rather than among blacks. The study was\nunable to determine the mechanism by which social support\nmay \nbeneficially affect health.\n01 from the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities\n(NCMHD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\nDisclosure:The authors declared no conflict of interest.\n1.
