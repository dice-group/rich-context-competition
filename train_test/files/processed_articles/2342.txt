    "abstract": "Abstract\nMuch evidence indicates that men experienced an evolutionary history of physical competition, both one-on-one and in\ncoalitions. We thus hypothesized that, compared to girls and women, boys and men will possess a greater motivational\npredisposition to be interested in sports, especially team sports. According to most scholars, advocacy groups, and the\nUnited States courts, however, this hypothesis is challenged by modest sex differences in organized school sports\nparticipation in the contemporary U.S., where females comprise 42% of high school participants and 43% of intercollegiate\nparticipants. We conducted three studies to test whether organized school sports participation data underestimate the\nactual sex difference in sports participation. Study 1 analyzed the American Time Use Survey, which interviewed 112,000\nindividuals regarding their activities during one day. Females accounted for 51% of exercise (i.e., non-competitive)\nparticipations, 24% of total sports participations, and 20% of team sports participations. These sex differences were similar\nfor older and younger age groups. Study 2 was based on systematic observations of sports and exercise at 41 public parks in\nfour states. Females accounted for 37% of exercise participations, 19% of individual sports participations, and 10% of team\nsports participations. Study 3 involved surveying colleges and universities about intramural sports, which primarily consist\nof undergraduate participation in team sports. Across 34 institutions, females accounted for 26% of registrations. Nine\ninstitutions provided historical data, and these did not indicate that the sex difference is diminishing. Therefore, although\nefforts to ensure more equitable access to sports in the U.S. (i.e., Title IX) have produced many benefits, patterns of sports\nparticipation do not challenge the hypothesis of a large sex difference in interest and participation in physical competition.\nCitation: Deaner RO, Geary DC, Puts DA, Ham SA, Kruger J, et al.

However, from an evolutionary perspective (i.e.,\nlinked to survival and reproduction), three hypotheses seem\nplausible [7]. First, sports may function as culturally invented\ncourtship rituals that reliably advertise participant quality to the\nopposite sex [8,9]. Second, sports may function as physical\ncompetitions for status, differing from unrestrained combat or\nwarfare because they reduce the risk of physical harm to\ncompetitors and more publicly and efficiently reveal the compet-\nitors' competitive qualities [7,8,10]. Third, sports may function to\nbuild skills necessary for physically-demanding activities, especially\ncombat, warfare, and hunting [2,11\u00ad13]. Although these hypoth-\neses are based on adaptive logic, none require the claim that sports\nare an adaptation per se. Instead they assume (or allow) that sports\narise as byproducts of other adaptations, including motives and\ncapacities to physically compete for mates and status, negotiate\nand enforce behavioral norms, and monitor the abilities of\npotential competitors, mates and allies.\nTo the extent that these hypotheses hold, especially the second\nand third ones, we further hypothesize that, compared to girls and\nwomen, boys and men will, on average, have a far greater inborn\nmotivational predisposition to participate in and monitor sports,\nespecially sports involving combat-relevant skills and/or team\nplay. This hypothesis follows from the following points. First, many\nlines of evidence indicate that throughout human evolutionary\nhistory and during contemporary periods, men have been\nsubstantially more likely than women to engage in contests\ninvolving extreme physical aggression [14\u00ad17], between-group\nIndeed, many sports require skills relevant for combat or hunting,\nsuch as running, tackling, and throwing or dodging projectiles\n[2,6,12]. In addition, some sports involve two teams competing\nagainst each other, with team play often requiring the differen-\ntiation of roles, coordination among teammates, and tactical\nSecond, a history of male-male aggression is revealed by\npronounced sexual dimorphism in musculature, strength [23,24],\nand speed [25,26]. Similarly, men (but not women) possess\nsecondary sexual characteristics (e.g., beards, pronounced jaws,\ndeep voices) that function to threaten rivals [27\u00ad30]. Another\nlegacy of this history is a predisposition(s) to behaviorally prepare\nfor physical contests, both individually and in groups. This is\nindicated by the fact that, in all societies that have been studied,\nboys engage in more rough-and-tumble play and play-fighting\n[31\u00ad35]. Boys are also more likely to form large same-sex groups,\nto differentiate roles within such groups, and to seek competition\nwith other groups [32,36,37]. Moreover, several kinds of evidence\nindicate that these sex-differentiated play patterns are due, at least\nin part, to boys' typically greater exposure to androgens prior to\nMuch evidence supports the hypothesis that males are more\npredisposed to be interested in sports. First, historical reviews of\nsports document that many societies had substantial female\nparticipation, but males are reported as being much more\ninvolved in most or all cases [2,6,39]. Similarly, cross-cultural\nethnographic studies of sports have focused on male sports,\napparently due to their greater prominence (e.g., [3,5,12,13]. In\nfact, a recent study found there were more male sports than female\nsports in all societies in the Human Relations Area Files\nprobability sample [40] (see also [41]). Second, studies in large\ncontemporary societies ubiquitously report greater male interest in\nparticipating, watching, and excelling in sports. Evidence comes\nfrom self-reports of interest (summarized in [16]) and from actual\nparticipation (e.g., [42\u00ad44]). Third, several studies have reported\nthat females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a disease\ncharacterized by heightened prenatal androgen exposure, are\nmore likely than unaffected females to show strong interest in\nstereotypically masculine sports [45\u00ad47].\nIt is important to emphasize that this evolutionary hypothesis is\nfully compatible with research implicating social influences on\nsports interest. For example, adolescent females often experience\ngreat pressure to eschew sports, especially stereotypically mascu-\nline sports [48\u00ad50]; this can be understood in terms of female\nmating competition, which generally emphasizes femininity\n[51,52]. Conversely, males may be rewarded for embracing\nmasculine norms in sports [53\u00ad55]; this makes sense given that, for\nmales, excelling in stereotypically masculine sports is associated\nthe particular patterns of inculcation can be expected to differ\nacross societies, an evolutionary perspective suggests that social-\nization will generally amplify inborn predispositions associated\nThe Challenge of Title IX\nDespite the evidence for a greater male than female predispo-\nsition for sports interest, a powerful challenge to this hypothesis has\nemerged in the form of surging sports participation by girls and\nwomen in some contemporary nations. The most striking example\nis in the United States, where female participation in organized\nsports has grown steadily over the past four decades. For instance,\nin 1972 females comprised 7% of high school athletes, whereas in\nThese changes occurred after the enactment in 1972 of a federal\nlaw, known as Title IX, that prohibits sexual discrimination in\neducational opportunities, including sports, and that resulted in\nthe creation of substantially more equitable opportunities and\nincentives (e.g., scholarships) for female athletes [63\u00ad65].\nMost scholars, advocacy groups, and the U.S. courts have\ninterpreted the substantial participation gains as indicating that\nfemales' sports interest is intrinsically equal to that of males and\nthat opportunities following in the wake of Title IX merely allowed\nfemales to express their interest. This ``If you build it, they will\ncome'' logic is the bedrock of current Title IX interpretation and\nexecution [63\u00ad65]. For example, The Women's Sports Foundation, the\nUnited States' most influential organization in advancing ``the\nlives of girls and women through sports and physical activity'' has\na section on its website called ``Title IX Myths and Facts'' and it\nstates:\n``MYTH: Girls are not as interested as boys in playing sports.\nFACT: The dramatic increase in girls' and women's participation\nlevel and 979% in high schools) demonstrates that it was lack of\nopportunity \u00ad not lack of interest \u00ad that kept females out of high\nschool and college athletics for so many years.'' [66].\nThe surge in female sports participation in the U.S. is certainly\nremarkable. Nevertheless, equal or nearly equal participation in\norganized school sports does not necessarily equate with equal or\nnearly equal interest in sports. One reason is that, on average, a\nparticipating male, compared to a participating female, may have\na stronger interest in or valuation of sports or may have a stronger\ndesire to be a sports spectator. Self-report studies conducted in the\nU.S. consistently support these suggestions, both for interests [67\u00ad\n70] and fandom [71\u00ad74]. However, counter interpretations have\nbeen offered [65,75,76]. A second reason that organized sports\nparticipation may be misleading is that aspiring male athletes may\nbe dismissed or ``cut'' from teams more often than their female\ncounterparts or males may participate substantially more in\nunorganized settings, in organized sports programs that are\nunaffiliated with schools, or organized sports programs that are\naffiliated with colleges and universities but are below the\nintercollegiate level (e.g., intramural sports). Similarly, female\nparticipation in organized sports might be more likely to reflect\nextrinsic motives (e.g., obtaining a scholarship) than intrinsic\ninterest. These possibilities have been suggested previously\n[77,78], but the evidence offered for them was informal or based\non unpublished studies.\nAims\nHere we tested whether, as our evolutionary hypothesis predicts,\nthe modest sex difference in organized school sports participation\nin the U.S. substantially underestimates the sex difference in sports\nparticipation of all kinds (i.e., organized and unorganized; school\naffiliated and unaffiliated). By contrast, our evolutionary hypoth-\nesis predicts no reliable sex difference in non-competitive physical\nactivity, which is hereafter called ``exercise.'' To test these\npredictions, we conducted three studies: Study 1 was based on\ntime-use surveys; Study 2 was based on observations at public\nparks; Study 3 was based on intramural registrations at colleges\nand universities.\nThese studies also allowed us to test additional predictions of the\nevolved male predispositions hypothesis. One is that the sex\ndifference in participation will be larger for team than individual\nsports. This prediction follows because team sports require both\nmotivation to engage in physical competition and motivation to\nMales Play Sports Much More than Females in U.S.\nengage in cooperative group challenges. Both kinds of motivation\nrequire only the first kind of motivation, whereas team sports\nrequire both, suggesting that the sex difference should be larger for\nteam sports.\nAnother prediction of the evolved male predispositions hypoth-\nesis is that the sex difference will remain stable over time. The\nlogic here is that once genuine opportunities were consistently\nprovided for organized female sports, usually by the 1980s or\n1990s, female participation would have been limited by female\ninterest. Female interest, in turn, would be determined by the\ninteraction between innate predispositions (e.g., due to prenatal\nandrogen exposure) and social influences that would be have been\npersistently relevant during human evolution history, such as peer\ninterest and approval [82]. By contrast, informing girls that more\ncollegiate scholarships will be available for them in 2010s than\nwere available for their mothers in the early 1990s is not expected\nto affect their sports interest. This is because such a change is\nabstract, and it only applies to a small proportion of individuals.\nWe tested the prediction of historical stability in two ways. In\nStudy 1, we addressed it indirectly, by comparing younger and\nolder age groups, under the assumption that the sex difference in\nsports interest in a given cohort will remain stable. We addressed\nthis prediction more directly in Study 3, by examining changes in\nundergraduate intramural registrations in the 2000s.\nResults\nStudy 1: American Time Use Survey\nStudy 1 analyzed data from the American Time Use Survey\n(ATUS).

As predicted, male participation rates\nfor sports were significantly and substantially higher than female\nrates, especially for team sports. In particular, females comprised\n28% of those who participated in individual sports and 20% of\nthose who participated in team sports (ps ,0.0001). There were\nsignificant sex differences in several sports, both individual and\nteam, and in every case, males participated at higher rates. In\ncontrast to sports participation, there was no substantial sex\ndifference for total exercise participation, and, in fact, females\nactually comprised 51% of exercise participants. There were\nTable 1.

As predicted, despite this variability, the sex\ndifference in participation for team and individual sports remained\nsignificant and substantial for all age groups.

Nevertheless, we explored whether these\nfactors might have affected sports and exercise participation.\nMultivariate logistic regression indicated that non-whites, com-\npared to Whites, participated more in team sports but less in\nindividual sports; in addition, those who did not complete high\nschool, compared to those graduated high school and those who\nobtained education beyond high school, participated more in team\nsports but less in individual sports (Table S1). Despite this\nvariation, within each educational and ethnic group, substantial\nsex differences remained for both individual and team sports\n(Table S2). Among ethnic groups, the smallest sex difference for\nteam sports occurred among Whites, where females comprised\n25% of participants; the smallest sex difference for individual\nsports occurred among Blacks where females comprised 31% of\nparticipants. Among educational groups, the smallest sex differ-\nences occurred among college graduates; females comprised 30%\nof participants for individual sports and 28% for team sports.\nStudy 2: Observations at Public Parks\nStudy 2 was based on systematic observations of unorganized\nsports and exercise participation at public parks in four U.S.\nlocations: Grand Rapids, Michigan; State College, Pennsylvania;\nTallahassee, Florida, and New Paltz, New York. Observations\nWe documented a total of 2,879 sports and exercise participa-\ntions (Table 4). Females accounted for a minority of participations\nfor both sports (12%) and exercise (37%), although, as predicted,\nthe sex difference was significantly greater for sports (x2 (1,\nwas significantly greater for team sports (10% female) than\nThe sex difference was significant for all frequently occurring\nsports (Table 4).

Thus, a key question is whether the sex difference in\nsports will remain strong if we examine the number of groups or\nparties, rather than individuals. For individual sports, there were\n216 parties, and 7% were female only, 2% were female biased\n(more females than males), 16% were unbiased, 5% were male\nbiased, and 70% were male only. For team sports, there were 389\nparties, and 3% were female only, 2% were female biased, 5%\nwere unbiased, 15% were male biased, and 74% were male only.\nThus, a large majority of sports parties were comprised of more\nmales than females, both for individual sports (75%; binomial test,\nA related issue is the extent to which the sex difference might be\ndue to males being more comfortable playing in larger groups (see\nparticipation decreased as party size increased. In fact, female\npercentage of participation was uncorrelated with party size, for\nfraction of participants, in parties ranging from one (10% of 52\nparticipants) to parties of six or more (11% of 1,343 participants).\nOne consequence of this pattern was that large groups comprised\nentirely of females were rare. Specifically, there were only two all-\nfemale groups with six or more individuals, whereas there were 87\nall-male groups of this size.\nObservations were made by seven researchers at 41 parks,\nallowing an examination of the consistency of sex differences\nacross locations and researchers. Some parks clearly fostered\nparticular activities. Most notably, 85% of skateboarding partic-\nipations occurred in one park, and 89% of disc golf participations\nin another park. Nonetheless, many sports, especially the popular\nteam sports of soccer and basketball, occurred in many parks, and\nthe sex difference generally occurred reliably. Most crucially, all\nseven researchers documented at least 108 team sports participa-\ntions, and all found a large, significant sex difference (Table 5).\nMoreover, the four male observers recorded essentially the same\npercentage of female participants in team sports (M = 11.9) as the\ntwo researchers (one male, one female) who were blind to the\nhypothesis of a sex difference recorded a percentage of female\nparticipants in team sports (M = 12.6) that did not differ from that\nResearchers could only broadly estimate participants' ages.\nNonetheless, these estimates indicated that the sex differences\n(Table 4) held across age groups, at least for age groups with many\nobservations (Table 6).\nStudy 3: Intramurals at Colleges and Universities\nStudy 3 involved surveys of intramural sports registrations at\ncolleges and universities in the U.S. An intramural sport is\nTable 4.

There are generally no extrinsic incentives (e.g.,\nsubstantial prizes or publicity) for intramurals, so they should\nprovide a reliable indicator of intrinsic motivation to participate.\nMost intramural registrations entail playing a series of games (e.g.,\na six game season occurring over an academic semester). Data\nThirty-four institutions provided information (see Methods) on\ntotal male and female intramural registrations, and females\naccounted for 26% of total registrations across all institutions\nand sports. This pattern held across institutions, as the median\nvalue was 28%, and the sex difference was significant at every\ninstitution (Table 7). In fact, there was not a single institution\nwhere females reached 43% of registrations, the female percentage\nof participation across all NCAA intercollegiate sports [62].\nTwenty-seven institutions provided information regarding\nregistrations for specific sports (Table 8). Fewer than 4% of\nregistrations were for individual sports, the most popular of which\nwere tennis (0.8% of all specific registrations), bowling (0.7%),\nrunning (0.5%), golf (0.4%), and racquetball (0.3%). Across these\n27 institutions, females accounted for 31% of individual sports\nregistrations, whereas they accounted for 26% of team sports\np,.0001). The greater sex difference in team than in individual\nsports occurred at 13 of the 23 institutions where individual sports\noccurred, and this difference was significant in nine cases (p,.05\nfor each). Of the 10 institutions where, contrary to our hypothesis,\nthe sex difference was greater in individual than in team sports, the\ndifference was significant in five cases.\nThe most popular team sports were football (20% of all specific\nregistrations), soccer (20%), basketball (19%), softball (16%), and\nvolleyball (13%). Females did not account for the majority of\nregistrations in any of these popular sports, although they came\nclose in volleyball (football: 16%; soccer: 29%; basketball: 20%;\nsoftball: 27%; volleyball: 48%). These patterns were fairly\nconsistent across institutions, with males being a significant\nmajority of registrants at most institutions for all popular sports,\nwith the exception of volleyball (Table 8).\nAn interesting question is whether female sports participation is\ndepressed due to the presence of male competitors. Intramural\ndata are useful for addressing this because, at most institutions,\nteam sports mainly involve single-sex competition (M = 71% of\nteams were single-sex rather than co-ed; SD = 5.5%; n = 10\ninstitutions). Eight institutions provided data on single-sex\nregistration for popular sports. In this context, females comprised\na modest percentage of participants (football: 20% of single-sex\nregistrations by females; soccer: 24%; basketball: 20%; softball:\nIntramural registrations generally involve playing in a series of\ngames over a semester. It is therefore possible that registration\nmight underestimate relative female participation because, for any\ngiven registration, females might participate more frequently. Five\ninstitutions provided information on participations per registration\nseparately for males and females. In all five cases, however, males\nparticipated at greater rates (University of Toledo: 11% greater\nmale participation per registration; University of Nevada, Las\nVegas: 17%; Boise State University: 22%; Fort Lewis College:\n44%; Southern Methodist University: 98%). In fact, if the median\ndifference in participation rate (i.e., 22%) is extrapolated to all 34\nTable 5.

However, across all\ninstitutions, females comprised 52% of undergraduates, and there\nwere more female than male undergraduates at 24 of 34\ninstitutions (Table 7). This pattern further indicates that the sex\ndifference in registrations underestimates the sex difference in\nindividual participation rates.\nA crucial question is whether the sex difference in sports\nparticipation is decreasing historically. We were able to address\nthis question because nine institutions provided at least five years\nof intramural data, some on total male and female participations\nand others on unique male and female participations (i.e., each\nindividual counts once regardless of how many sports they play\nover the entire academic year). As shown in Table 9, at all nine\ninstitutions, the percentage of female intramural registration was\nwas in the preceding years. By this measure, seven institutions\nshowed decreasing female registration and two showed increasing\nfemale registration. Similarly, correlations between year and\npercentage of female registration were negative at five institutions\nand positive at four institutions; none was significant, perhaps due\nto small size (Table 9). To increase statistical power, we used a\ngeneral linear model to incorporate data from all institutions:\npercent female registration was significantly predicted by institu-\np = .45). In fact, the parameter estimate for year was negative\n(b = -.06), indicating a very slight decrease in female registration.\nTable 7.

That males have\napparently participated and monitored sports more often than\nfemales in most or all societies supports this hypothesis, but surging\nfemale participation in organized school sports in the contempo-\nrary U.S. challenges it. The three studies reported here, however,\ndemonstrate that organized school sports participation substan-\ntially underestimates the sex difference. Specifically, females\ncomprise approximately 42% of high school athletes and 43% of\ncollegiate athletes, but they comprise only 24% of those who\nreport playing sports on a given day (Study 1), 12% of those\nplaying sports in public parks (Study 2), and 26% of those who\nregister for collegiate intramural sports (Study 3). Even these\npercentages somewhat underestimate the sex difference because\nmales play for longer durations (Study 1) and play more frequently\nper intramural registration (Study 3).\nIn addition, as predicted from our evolutionary framework, the\nsex difference in sports participation was greater for team than\nindividual sports. This result was clear in Study 1 and Study 2.\nStudy 3 also found a greater sex difference for team than for\nindividual sports, although the difference was not consistent across\ninstitutions, perhaps owing to the fact that intramurals at most\ninstitutions rarely involve individual sports.\nIn contrast to both individual and team sports, the sex difference\nin exercise was unreliable (Study 1) or modest (Study 2). The\nexercise results indicate that both males and females are motivated\nto be physically active, but that males are generally more\ninterested in pursuing this in a competitive way (see [85\u00ad89]).\nAlthough our findings contradict the popular claim that there is\nno substantial sex difference in sports interest [63\u00ad65], they are in\nagreement with previous empirical studies of sports participation.\nWhether measuring duration or frequency, these studies consis-\ntently find that males play sports, especially team sports, at least\ntwice as much females do, and often much more frequently. This is\nthe case with children in Australia [90], teens in Canada [91],\nchildren in Denmark [92], teens and adults in England [44], and\nchildren, teens and adults in Ireland [43].\nAlso paralleling the present study, when studies report non-\ncompetitive physical activity or exercise, they indicate minimal sex\nphysical activity (sports and exercise combined) in large societies\nalso report modest differences [93,94], sometimes with females\nparticipating more [95]. Finally, earlier studies of sports partici-\npation among children and teens in the U.S. (with modest, non-\nrepresentative samples) reported that males play sports more than\nPotential Limitations\nEach of our three studies has potential limitations, yet none\nseriously challenge our conclusions. One possible limitation of\nStudy 1 is that self-reports of physical activity typically show only\nlow to moderate criterion validity, especially when based on\nretrospective queries [98]. However, the methods used in time use\nsurveys, such as the ATUS, have been specifically designed to\nminimize distortions [83]. More importantly, we obtained\nconverging results in Study 2 and Study 3, and they were based\non behavioral measures. A second potential limitation of Study 1 is\nthat the size of the age group cohorts was modest given daily sports\nparticipation rates. For example, in the 20\u00ad24 age group, there\nwere 5,189 respondents, and the participation rates indicate that\nonly about 460 individuals would have reported playing sports on\nthe previous day. However, there was a highly similar sex\nregistrations.\nAnother limitation of Study 1 is that, because there were no\nATUS codes for them, we could not include the high school sports\nof water polo, lacrosse, swimming and diving, or competitive\ncheerleading [61]. Water polo and lacrosse have greater male than\nfemale participation (water polo: 47% female participation;\nlacrosse: 43%) and were probably not included in the ATUS\nbecause they are played much less than most other sports (see\nMethods for sports popularity). Thus, their inclusion seems\nunlikely to have substantially affected our results. Swimming and\ndiving, however, is a moderately popular sport and females\nconstitute 55% of participants. Therefore, the sex difference in\nindividual sport participation in the present study is likely to be\nsomewhat of an overestimate. Finally, competitive cheerleading is\nalmost exclusively done by females (98%), and is moderately\npopular. However, although it meets our technical definition of a\nsport, competitive cheerleading is unusual because it is the only\npopular ``genuine'' team sport (see Methods) whose outcome\ndepends exclusively on judging, not direct competition between\nsimultaneously competing teams. Moreover, it is the only major\nhigh school sport that is not an NCAA intercollegiate sport. Thus,\nalthough including competitive cheerleading would somewhat\ndecrease the sex difference in team sports participation, it is not\nclear that including it is desirable, at least with regards to testing\nthe evolved predispositions hypothesis.\nStudy 2 was potentially limited by the fact it was based on\nconvenience sampling, meaning that is possible that other, more\nrepresentative public parks would not show a pronounced sex\ndifference in sports participation. For several reasons, though, this\npossibility seems highly unlikely. First, we know of no bias in our\nsample, and all seven researchers independently documented a\nlarge sex difference in team sports participation. Indeed, we are\nunaware of any credible report of an area in the U.S. where\nfemales consistently play sports in public areas at rates similar to\nmales. Second, Study 1 was based on a nationally representative\nsample, and it indicated the sex difference occurred for all\neducational and ethnic groups. Similarly, Study 3 found the sex\ndifference across a broad sample of colleges and universities.\nStudy 3 might be viewed as limited because it focused on\nintramural sports, which are played mainly by undergraduates in\ntheir late teens and early 20s. In fact, this was an ideal sample for\nrigorously testing our main prediction. As revealed in Study 1,\nmost sports, especially team sports, are played by those 24 years\nand younger. In addition, because participation rates in organized\nschool sports are roughly 18 times greater in high school than in\ncollege [99], it might be more difficult to assess intrinsic motivation\nin high school students because much of their sports participation\nmight be linked to preparing for organized school competition.\nFurthermore, women seeking college degrees might be expected to\nshow greater sports interest than other women because there\napparently are reciprocal relationships between education and\nParticipation and Interest\nThe evolved male predispositions hypothesis assumes that the\nlarge sex difference in sports participation reflects a large sex\ndifference in sports interest. Is this assumption valid? It is a truism\nthat many individuals with a strong interest in sports (or other\nactivities) might not participate owing to lack of time, access to\nfacilities, or other constraints. Although constraints on females'\nsports participation must be greater than the constraints on males\nin some cases, for at least three reasons, this seems inadequate as a\ngeneral explanation for females' lower participation.\nFirst, although females, especially girls, may have less time for\nsports and leisure in most societies [103], lack of time is not a\nMales Play Sports Much More than Females in U.S.\nplausible explanation for our results. The reason is that in Study 1\nfemales spent nearly as much time as males in total physical\nactivity; the key difference was that the proportion of time females\nspent on sports, especially team sports, was much less. In\nparticular, for males 15% of their physical activities involved\nteam sports and 10% involved individual sports; for females 4%\ninvolved team sports and 5% involved individual sports. Other\nstudies also indicate that the sex difference in sports participation\npartly reflects females giving higher priority to other recreational\nSecond, that females do not play sports as much as males\nbecause they lack facilities or opportunities also seems unlikely, at\nleast as a general explanation. This is illustrated by soccer and\nbasketball, the two most frequently played team sports in the U.S.\nThese sports require minimal equipment and facilities, and on\nschool teams, female participation is almost as high as male\nparticipation [61,62]. Yet all three studies reported here find that\nmales play these sports more than three times as much as females\ndo. This pattern even held for single-sex collegiate intramurals,\nshowing that females' relatively low participation cannot be\nascribed to the presence of male competitors. Finally, if constraints\nwere a major factor, then females' self-reported desire to\nparticipate and excel in sports would be equal to males', and\nstudies consistently contradict this [67\u00ad70].\nTemporal Convergence\nThe present findings, together with questionnaire studies,\ndemonstrate that there is a substantial sex difference in sports\ninterest even in the contemporary U.S., a society where there is\nconsensus that great progress has been made in equalizing\nproponents of the ``no intrinsic differences'' view might contend\nthat it has been only 40 years since Title IX was passed, and that\nthis legislation was not effectively implemented during some of\nthese years [64]. Thus, although there is a large sex difference now\nin sports interests, this difference might be waning.\nAlthough the time depth was limited, Study 39s analysis of\ntemporal changes in intramural participation at nine institutions\ndoes not support the claim of convergence. Similarly, Study 1\ncompared older and younger groups with the ATUS and found no\nindication that younger women, who grew up with Title IX being\nbetter enforced, participate at relatively greater rates. Testing for\nchanges over time with the ATUS would also be valuable, but we\ncould not do so here because preliminary analyses indicated that,\nbecause of modest sample sizes, yearly sports participation\nestimates were highly unstable.\nAnother set of studies addressed historical convergence in a less\ndirect fashion, focusing on sex differences in willingness to train\nthat, although the number females that participate in distance\nrunning in the U.S. has grown steadily since the 1970s, so that\nthere is no longer a sex difference in participation, there are still\nroughly three times as many males that run fast relative to sex-\nspecific world class standards. For example, in a typical local 5 K\nroad race with equal male and female participation, for every\nfemale that finishes within 25% of the female world record, there\nare roughly three males that finish within 25% of the male world\nrecord. This pattern holds robustly for elite runners and non-elite\n(i.e., recreational) runners, and tests reveal no indication that the\nsex difference in the number of relatively fast performers has\ndiminished over the past few decades. Because relative running\nperformance is an equally strong predictor of training volume (e.g.,\nkilometers/week) in men and women [109], these patterns indicate\nthat the sex difference in willingness to train competitively is large\nrunners has mainly involved those who run for non-competitive\nreasons; most competitive females were already competing by the\nWe hope that other measures of sports participation and interest\ncan be identified that will allow assessments of temporal change.\nSimilarly, it should be possible to revisit this issue in the future,\nafter Title IX has had another generation or two to take effect.\nNonetheless, for now, the hypothesis that the sex difference in\nsports interest is in the process of converging must be viewed as\nlacking empirical support.\nAlternative Explanations\nAnother argument that might be raised in defense of the ``no\nintrinsic differences'' view is that the changes produced by Title\nIX\u00adchanges focused on opportunities and incentives in organized\nschool sports\u00adare insufficient to catalyze female sports interest. For\nexample, compared to boys, girls may still receive less childhood\nsports encouragement [110] or lack role models of professional\nathletes (see [111,112]). Although these and related hypotheses\ncertainly warrant attention, it is difficult to conceive of practical\nmethods for assessing them, particularly because individuals and\ntheir environments interact. In the case of sports encouragement,\nfor instance, parents may be less likely to enroll their daughters in\nsoccer leagues, but this may reflect that fewer young girls than\nboys express interest in this sort of activity [36,113].\nSimilarly, the fact that there are far fewer women than men who\nearn their livelihoods playing sports can be viewed as an effect,\nrather than a cause, of lesser female sports interest. For example,\nthe premier men's basketball league in the U.S., the National\nBasketball Association (NBA), has sponsored a women's profes-\nsional league (WNBA) since 1997, and the attendance and\nviewership is a small fraction of the NBA's and has not grown\nSports Illustrated Women (SI Women). SI Women was targeted to\nappeal to girls and women who wanted follow high-level women's\nsports in the way that Sports Illustrated caters to the interests of\nmale sports fans. However, publication of SI Women ceased in\nOther magazines focusing on elite female athletes have also failed\nto gain large readerships [115].\nFinally, in considering the argument that Title IX might not be\nsufficient to substantially spur female sports interest, it is worth\nnoting that this argument contradicts the claims of many scholars\nand the U.S. courts. The courts, in particular, have been clear that\none of Title IX's main purposes is to produce equal sports\nopportunities in schools and that doing this will, by itself, be\nsufficient to eventually produce equal sports interest [63\u00ad65].\nConclusions\nOur findings support the hypothesis of an evolved male\npredisposition for physical competition\u00adone that manifests in\ncontemporary societies as greater participation of males in sports.\nTwo points about this hypothesis must be stressed, however. First,\nas noted in the Introduction, we do not claim that sports interest is\nentirely driven by an evolutionary history of male-male compe-\ntition and the proximate effects of sex hormones. On the contrary,\nsports interest is influenced by societal gender roles, parents, peers,\nand the like, and such factors likely contribute to variation across\nscholars have shown, evolutionary theory is fully compatible with\nsubstantial cross-societal variation in human sex differences\nNonetheless, the evolved male predispositions hypothesis does\nMales Play Sports Much More than Females in U.S.\npredict that males will, on average, be more interested in physical\ncompetition, and thus sports, in all or nearly all societies. A recent\nstudy illustrated these points: it found more male than female\nsports in all societies in the Human Relations Area Files\nprobability sample, yet the sex difference was typically greater in\npatriarchal than in non-patriarchal societies [40].\nOur final point is that a greater male predisposition for sports\ninterest does not contradict most arguments made by Title IX\nproponents. Most notably, it is indisputable that, prior to Title IX,\ngirls and women in the U.S. generally had vastly inferior sports\nresources and opportunities than boys and men, that sports and\nexercise can provide substantial benefits for girls and women, that\nstrong moral arguments exist for ensuring that males and females\nenjoy equal sporting opportunities, and that Title IX has had\nmany positive effects. Nevertheless, our results do suggest that it\nmay be a mistake to base Title IX implementation on the\nassumption that males and females have, or soon will have,\ngenerally equal sports interest.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe American Time Use Survey (ATUS) is a survey of the use\nof time among the civilian, non-institutionalized population aged\n15 years and older conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor\nStatistics and the U.S Census Bureau [83]. The sample represents\na stratified random subsample drawn from a panel of households\nthat completed participation in the Current Population Survey\n(CPS), a federal survey that provides the national unemployment\nrate. A single person from each household that was selected from\nthe CPS panel was interviewed by telephone about use of personal\ntime on a single, pre-assigned reporting day. Interviewers asked\nrespondents to report all activities that were performed during the\n24-hour period beginning at 4:00 am on the day before the\ninterview and ending at 3:59 am on the day of the interview.\nRespondents were given the opportunity to report spontaneously\nrecalled activities, the times of day that activities started and ended\nor one time of day and how long that activity lasted. Verbatim\nresponses to activities reported in the interview were later coded by\ntwo interviewers into .400 categories including 25 sports and\nexercise activities described below. Households without telephones\nwere encouraged to respond by mailing them a $40 debit card that\ncould be activated if they called in to complete the survey. The\nATUS is a free public use data set [120].\ninterviews [83]. Response rates of persons selected from the CPS\npersons aged 15 years and older who were surveyed between 2003\nWhite, 13% were Black, 13% were Hispanic or Latino and 4%\nwere other race or multi-racial. Thirty percent were college\ngraduates, 17% had less than high school education, and the rest\nwere high school graduates or had some college or technical school\neducation.\nWe focused on sports with moderate to high participation rates\nin U.S. high schools. These were defined as sports that were played\nbasketball (980 K), bowling (53 K), competitive cheerleading\nfocused on high school sports rather than collegiate sports because\nhigh school sports participation is roughly 18 times greater [99].\nUnfortunately, the ATUS lexicon did not correspond with the\nhigh school sports in several ways. First, there were no ATUS\ncodes for swimming and diving, water polo, lacrosse, or\ncompetitive cheerleading [121], so these sports could not be\nassessed. Second, the ATUS had no code for tennis, although it\ndid have a code for racquet sports, which we used because it\nencompasses and largely consists of tennis. Third, the ATUS code\nfor hockey did not distinguish ice hockey and field hockey, so we\nused that code and assessed both kinds of hockey together. Fourth,\nwe used the ATUS code for running because there were no codes\nfor cross-country or track and field.\nWe defined exercise activities as ones apparently undertaken\nprimarily for physical fitness rather than competition. We selected\nthese based on their availability in the ATUS lexicon [121] and\ntheir popularity in the U.S. [93]. Exercise activities were aerobics,\nbiking, dancing, hiking, rollerblading, running, cardio, walking,\nwater sports, weightlifting/strength training, working out (unspec-\nified), and yoga. We classified running as an exercise rather than a\nsport because studies of distance running find that most runners'\nself-reported motivation and training is consistent with a non-\ncompetitive orientation [89,122]. Although respondents could self-\nreport participating in ``caving, spelunking or climbing,'' the\nprevalence of this exercise category was too low to report\nseparately for males and females.\nWe classified sports as individual sports or team sports. We\nclassified bowling, golf, gymnastics, racquet sports, and wrestling\nas individual sports despite the fact that these sports can involve\nteam competition (and generally do in U.S. high schools). We did\nso because an individual's performance in these sports depends\nalmost on entirely on their own efforts, rather than coordinated\nefforts with their teammates, a point revealed by the fact that these\nsports invariably include individual championships. By contrast, in\n``genuine'' team sports, individuals may garner awards (e.g., ``all\nstar''), but there are no individual championships. We classified\nbaseball, basketball, hockey, football, soccer, softball, and volley-\nball as team sports.\nATUS respondents were classified as having (or not having)\nparticipated in an activity on the recalled day for each of the 25\nidentified activities, for each of the three groups of activities (i.e.,\nteam sports, individual sports, and exercise), and for either\nindividual or team sports. In addition, among those who\nparticipated in an activity group, we obtained their total minutes\nof participation.\nWe used tests of equality of proportions to assess the statistical\nsignificance of sex differences. We used multivariate logistic\nregressions to assess the effects of demographic characteristics on\nparticipation in team and individual sports. All analyses were\nweighted and, for the prevalence estimates, confidence intervals\nwere computed from estimates of total variance according to\nmethods used for the Current Population Survey [123]. For\n``exempt'' by Grand Valley State's Institutional Review Board\nMales Play Sports Much More than Females in U.S.\nEach researcher was instructed to initially identify public parks\nwhere unorganized sports were often played. Each park was\nrequired to have at least one of the following: basketball court,\ntennis court, grass field or turf field. Parks might include other\nfacilities such as a running track, handball courts, horseshoe pit,\ndisc golf course, or skateboarding ramp. Researchers were\ninstructed to avoid parks with pools, lakes, or other areas allowing\naquatic sports. Because this study focused on sports, not exercise,\nresearchers were also instructed to avoid trails where people walk,\nrun, bike, or rollerblade. Parks often included distinctive areas for\npotential sports play (e.g., basketball court, softball diamond); these\nareas were considered part of the same park so as long as the\nresearcher could visually monitor all areas simultaneously and\nthere was no street dividing the areas. Parks could include the\ngrounds of public schools so long as the schools were not in session.\nUniversity gyms, sports clubs, and other non-public areas were not\nincluded.\nParks were selected based on the apparent occurrence of sports\nand researchers' convenience in visiting them, which usually\nmeant they were in the same geographical area. Each researcher\nwas asked to identify a ``circuit'' of five to twelve parks, although\nsometimes circuits were smaller due to a researcher's transporta-\ntion limitations or because there were few local parks. Researchers'\ncircuits generally did not include common parks, although EF\nmade twelve observations (45 participations) at one of ROD's\nmain parks (194 participations). Once researchers began observa-\ntions, they did not add parks to their circuits, although they\nstopped visiting parks where they repeatedly observed no sports.\nThe locations of the park circuits were fairly diverse: in Grand\nRapids, Michigan, two circuits (RD's, EF's) occurred within the\ncity, whereas another occurred in suburban towns west of the city\n(DB's); in State College, Pennsylvania, a college town, the two\ncircuits occurred within the city; in New Paltz, New York, a small\ncollege town, the circuit consisted of the single suitable public park;\nin Tallahassee, Florida, the circuit occurred within the city.\nObservers were aware of the sex difference hypothesis with the\nexception of the two observers in Pennsylvania who neither knew\nnor suspected that this study was focused on sex differences.\nAt times when sports participation seemed likely, such as early\nevenings or weekends when the weather was good, researchers\nwould deliberately visit all parks in their circuit. To avoid bias,\nresearchers did not make observations opportunistically, such as\nupon noticing sports being played when they were driving by a\npark. Researchers often completed their circuit several times per\nweek but not more than once per day. No attempt was made to\navoid repeated observation of the same individuals on different\ndays. This could not be done reliably. Furthermore, participation\nfrequency is actually a good measure for addressing the hypotheses\nof interest.\nUpon arrival at a park, the researcher would document all\ninstances of exercise or sports that were currently occurring (i.e.,\ninstantaneous time sampling [124]). Activities were counted as\noccurring if individuals were taking a brief recess related to the\nactivity (e.g., choosing teams, drinking fluids, tying shoes).\nHowever, in such cases, individuals were counted as participating\nonly if they resumed participation with three minutes of the\nresearcher's arrival. To avoid bias, researchers did not wait at\nparks for activities to be initiated.\nWe classified activities as sports or exercise based on Study 1.\nBecause of their similarities with other sports and because they met\nour definition, the following activities were also classified as sports:\nultimate frisbee (147 total participations), disc golf (129), muggle\nkickball (8). The following were also classified as exercise:\nskateboarding (65), hackeysack (12), riding scooters (6), non-\ncombative martial arts (4), and hula-hooping (1). We classified\nsports as individual sports or team sports based on Study 1.\nSome instances of sport participation involved practice rather\nthan competition. Examples include playing catch with a baseball\nor football, practicing shooting in basketball or soccer, or hitting a\ntennis ball against a backboard. We classified this kind of activity\nas sports participation, on the assumption that it is generally\nundertaken to improve one's ability to compete in a sport.\nWe classified instances of sports participation as organized or\nunorganized. We defined organized sports as those that are\ndirected by individuals besides the participants. Examples include\nhigh school sports, collegiate sports, club sports, intramural sports,\nrecreational leagues, and training sessions organized by coaches.\nResearchers did not interact with participants and so did not ask\nsports participants if there was an organizing body or agent\ndirecting their play. Instead, researchers categorized participation\nas organized if they saw evidence of any of the following: uniforms,\nreferees, judges, coaches, or formal leadership (e.g., team captains\ndirecting practice). We did not present data on organized\nparticipation in the Results section because there were relatively\nfew organized sports parties observed (83) but most were large\n(M = 19.4 individuals), meaning that random error could substan-\ntially affect the results. Overall, females accounted for 25% of\norganized sports participants.\nThe data collection protocol was designed to promote\nreliability. ROD and EF tested this by simultaneously and\nindependently collecting data on two evenings. Reliability was\nand party organized/unorganized sport classification (k = .90;\nEthics statement. This study involved surveying intramural\norganizers/administrators at colleges and universities. They\nvoluntarily reported institutional data about demographic patterns\nof participation at their institution. They provided no data\nregarding individuals, meaning that this study did not technically\ninclude ``human subjects'' and thus did not require IRB approval.\nWe requested data from institutions that play football in the\nNCAA Division I (D1) Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) or in\nNCAA Division 2 (D2). We searched the website of each\ninstitution for an individual who was identified the primary\nintramural organizer. We identified such an individual at 74 of\ncontacted these individuals by email; for D1 institutions, we did\nthis in late October and early November 2011; for D2 institutions\nwe did this in March 2012. We explained that we were conducting\na study of intramural sports participation to assess which sports are\nmost popular for men and women in different regions of the\nUnited States. We asked which sports were offered as intramurals\nat their institution, how many men and women registered or\nparticipated in each sport and in all sports combined, and whether\neach sport was offered as co-ed, single sex, or both. We requested\ndata regarding the past year and any previous years. If we received\nno response, we sent one additional request about one week later.\nOf the 74 D1 institutions, 36 responded but several did not\nprovide useful data (e.g., they did not distinguish male and female\nregistration); 19 provided data on overall sex differences in\nregistration of all kinds, single sex and co-ed together (Table 7),\nfive institutions provided data on male and female single-sex\nregistrations (University of Louisville, University of Mississippi,\nUniversity of Notre Dame, Wake Forest University, Western\nMales Play Sports Much More than Females in U.S.\nMichigan University); University of Nevada, Las Vegas provided\nboth kinds of information. Of the 73 D2 institutions, 29\nresponded; 15 provided data on overall sex differences in\nregistration of all kinds (Table 7); Millersville University provided\ndata on male and female single-sex registrations; Shippensburg\nUniversity provided data on both.\nOur primary measure of participation was registration, and one\nindividual could register for several sports each year. If we had\nfocused on unique participants, the sex difference would have been\nsubstantially smaller. However, total participations was the\nappropriate measure for the current study, which aimed to\nmeasure participation frequency, not simply its occurrence.\nAlthough institutions provided us with the absolute number of\nmale and female registrants, we focused on the percentage of\nregistrants that were female, rather than assessing what factors\nexplained absolute variation in male or female registration across\ninstitutions. It was inappropriate to make direct registration\ncomparisons across institutions because they varied widely in their\nmenu of sports offered, duration of playing season, participation\nfees, and other factors.\nSome institutions provided only total male and female\nregistrations but, in most cases, they provided information for\neach sport, sometimes more than 30 in total. Whenever\ninformation was available for each sport, we retained it so that\nwe could assess the popularity of particular sports (see Results\nabove). In addition, considering specific sports allowed us to\nremove some that did not meet the anthropological definition of\nsport provided at the outset of the paper (i.e., we excluded games\nthat did not involve physical skill). Among those excluded were\npoker, ``NCAA tournament bracket challenge'', ``chili cookoff'',\n``rock paper scissors'', and trivia games. We also removed video\ngames, despite that they might meet the definition of sport;\nincluding them would have very slightly increased the sex\ndifference reported in this study. We combined different variations\nof the same general sport (e.g., outdoor and indoor soccer). In\nclassifying sports as individual or team, we focused on each\nactivity's typical form of play so that, for example, doubles tennis\nwas classified as tennis and thus as an individual sport. Some\nintramurals were described as tournaments, meaning play usually\noccurred during one or a few days. We generally counted\ntournaments in participation unless no information was provided\non participants' sex, which was the case at Texas A&M University\nand Northwestern University. Data were generally from the 2010\u00ad\n2011 academic year, although, in a few cases, they were only from\nFall 2011. We obtained data on institutional enrollments from the\nNational Center for Education Statistics [125].\nHistorical analyses were based only on institutions that provided\nat least five years of data. Furthermore, we required that the data\nbe based on similar methods of data collection and a similar menu\nof intramural options. In particular, at one institution, the number\nof intramural registrations doubled from one year to the next,\nsuggesting that yearly comparisons would be unwarranted. Some\ninstitutions provided yearly data summaries that were not strictly\ncomparable to ones shown in Table 7, which were based on 2010\u00ad\n2011. For example, one institution apparently provided historical\ndata on unique registrations, not total registrations.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Multivariate logistic regressions predicting\nparticipation in team and individual sports, American\nTable S2 Participation rates for sports and exercise for\nmales and females across racial/ethnic groups and\n"
