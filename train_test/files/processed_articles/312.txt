In\nused to identify cases among individuals not reporting diabetes. Design-based analyses and\nBayesian models estimate the probability that prevalence of diabetes increased within four BMI\nsignificant increases in the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes (3.3\u00ad5.8%, probability 99.9%)\nwere accompanied by nonsignificant increases in undiagnosed diabetes (2.0\u00ad2.4%, 66.6%).\nThis resulted in an increase in total diabetes (5.3\u00ad8.2%, 99.9%) and a modest nonsignificant\nincrease in the proportion of cases that were diagnosed (62\u00ad70%, 62.4%). However, these trends\nvaried considerably by BMI level.

By comparison, changes in prevalence within BMI strata 35\nkg/m2 were modest and there was no increase in the percent of total cases that were diagnosed.\nCONCLUSIONS -- National surveys over the last several decades have found large increases\nin diagnosed diabetes, particularly in overweight and obese individuals, but this has been\naccompanied by large decreases in undiagnosed diabetes only among individuals with BMI 35\nkg/m2. This suggests that improvements in diabetes awareness and detection are most prominent\namong this subgroup.\nThe prevalence of diagnosed diabetes\nincreased dramatically during the\npast 40 years in the U.S. and many\nother countries around the world (1\u00ad5).\nIncreases in prevalence have been primar-\nily attributed to increases in type 2 diabe-\ntes and have been observed among both\nmen and women and across ethnic groups\nand age-groups (2,3,6). The type 2 diabe-\ntes epidemic is believed to be largely a\nby-product of a concomitant increase in\nobesity levels (7), because population in-\ncreases in diabetes have coincided with\nincreases in obesity and because weight\ngain is a key determinant of insulin resis-\nAlthough there is little debate that\nobesity is a key factor driving the diabetes\nepidemic, other factors may play an inde-\npendent role, including reductions in\nphysical activity, changes in diet compo-\nsition, environmental factors, or an in-\nbecause many diabetes surveillance data\nestimated prevalence of diabetes may be\naffected by an increase in the proportion\nthat is diagnosed.\nDespite the recent attention to the di-\nabetes epidemic, previous studies have\nnot examined whether diabetes preva-\nlence has increased similarly among lean,\noverweight, and obese persons. For ex-\nample, a higher diabetes prevalence in\nsame weight categories (as measured by\nBMI) would suggest that some environ-\nmental, cohort, or detection-related fac-\ntor above and beyond BMI is playing an\nimportant role in the growth of the diabe-\ntes epidemic. Similarly, variation in the\nratio of diagnosed to undiagnosed diabe-\ntes according to level of obesity could in-\ndicate that detection efforts are working\ndifferently in certain subgroups and po-\ntentially influencing estimates of diabetes\nprevalence.\nTo assess whether the association of\nobesity and diabetes has changed over\ntime, and whether increases in diabetes\nhave occurred similarly among obese as\namong lean individuals, we assembled\n                                                \nFrom the 1Division of Diabetes Translation, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health\nPromotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia; the 2Division of Information\nTechnology, Northrop Grumman, Atlanta, Georgia; and the 3National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and\nKidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Edward W.

In the five surveys, there were\n3,598 participants, respectively.

Race and ethnicity were\nassessed differently in the latter two sur-\nveys than in the first three surveys. There-\nfore, we categorized participants as white\nor black for NHANES I and NHANES II\nand as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, Mexican American, or other for\nWe excluded individuals older than 74\nyears because patients in that age-group\nwere not sampled in the first three surveys.\nDefinition of diabetes\nDiagnosed diabetes was defined as indi-\nviduals' positive response to the question\nof whether they had ever been told by a\ndoctor or other health professional that\nthey had diabetes.

The preva-\nlence was adjusted to account for the fact\nthat individuals with diagnosed diabetes\nwere not part of the fasting morning sam-\nple denominator (2,25). Calculation of\nSEs assumed independence between the\nmorning and examination samples. Prev-\nalence of total diabetes was determined by\nadding the prevalences of diagnosed and\nadjusted undiagnosed diabetes. Our anal-\nyses examined trends in prevalence of di-\nabetes (diagnosed, undiagnosed, and\ntotal) and the proportion of total cases\nthat were diagnosed across survey years,\ncorrespond to normal, overweight, obese\nclass I, and obese class II as suggested by\nthe National Heart Lung and Blood Insti-\ntute Expert Panel on Overweight and\nTrends in the age-adjusted estimates\nof diabetes prevalence were assessed by\nfitting a normal hierarchical Bayesian\nmodel using noninformative prior distri-\nbutions (27).

A more de-\ntailed description of the statistical ap-\nproaches used is provided in the\nRESULTS -- Table 1 describes the\ngeneral characteristics of the sample pop-\nulations across the five surveys. There\nwere only slight changes in the age distri-\nbutions; the tendency in recent surveys\nwas toward a larger proportion of\nyounger people (20\u00ad44 years) relative to\nslightly smaller proportion of women. A\nchange in the survey questionnaires\nmakes it impossible to directly compare\nchanges in the racial and ethnic profile\nacross all surveys, but an increase in the\nproportion of Mexican Americans and in-\ndividuals of other races or ethnicities is\nevident in the most recent survey.

Whereas\n25 years ago this group had the highest\npercentage of diabetes cases that went un-\ndiagnosed, it now has the highest percent-\nage of diagnosed cases. We speculate that\nbetter overall awareness among patients\nand providers about diabetes and its po-\ntential to be asymptomatic may have led\nto increased opportunistic screening of\nobese individuals in health care settings.\nMore specifically, increasing attention to\nobesity and diabetes in both the lay and\nprofessional media may have conditioned\nhealth care providers to associate extreme\nobesity with a high risk of undiagnosed\ndiabetes, making them more likely to\nquestion obese patients about symptoms\nand then to perform more testing. Despite\nthis increase in the proportion of diag-\nnosed cases among the most obese group,\nthere was no increase in the proportion\ndiagnosed in other subgroups. Roughly\n30% of the overall diabetic population is\nestimated to be undiagnosed, indicating a\ncontinuing need to improve detection of\nundiagnosed diabetes and to increase\nawareness of key diabetes risk factors.\nSecond, our finding that the preva-\nlence rates for total diabetes (i.e., diag-\nnosed and undiagnosed cases combined)\nhave remained relatively stable within\nBMI strata, even as the BMI levels of\nAmericans have increased, is consistent\nwith prior arguments that obesity is the\npredominant factor driving the growth of\nthe diabetes epidemic. This is reflected in\nobservational studies showing that the as-\nsociation of obesity and weight gain with\ndiabetes is nonlinear, with disproportion-\nate increases in diabetes incidence among\nindividuals with BMI 35 kg/m2 and\nweight gain (9,28). Similarly, in the\nals with BMI 35 kg/m2 account for only\n13.5% of the overall population but for\n36% of the diabetic population. Other\nfactors, such as levels of physical activity,\nTable 2 --Age-adjusted prevalence of diagnosed, undiagnosed, and total diabetes according to level of obesity*\nBMI level\nNHES\nNHANES\nProbability of\nDiagnosed diabetes\nUndiagnosed diabetes\nTotal diabetes (diagnosed\nand undiagnosed)\nData are percent  SE or percent. *Denominator for diagnosed diabetes and total diabetes is based on the interview sample (all participants with BMI and\nbased on the subsample who had attended the fasting morning examinations (n  3,786, 5,800, and 1,441 for the three surveys, respectively). Probabilities since\ndiabetes may differ from the sum of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes due to rounding error. All results are age adjusted to the U.S. 2000 census population.\nGregg and Associates\ndiet (e.g., variations in whole grain and\nfiber, dairy, saturated fat, and caffeine in-\ntake), or other unknown environmental\n35). However, if changes in these factors\nwere playing an important role in the di-\nabetes epidemic above and beyond their\neffects on obesity, we would expect to see\nchanges in total diabetes prevalence in\ngroups with similar BMI.\nA third implication of our findings is\nthat because much diabetes surveillance\nis based on self-report of diabetes, a si-\nmultaneous increase in obesity preva-\nlence and the detection of diabetes among\nthe most obese could complicate our in-\nterpretation of historical trend data\ntions, it is possible that the observed in-\ncreases in self-reported diagnosed\ndiabetes have slightly overestimated the\ntrue increase in total diabetes prevalence\n(1). We are also reminded that, although\nseveral studies have reported higher rates\nof diagnosed diabetes in recent decades,\nthe NHANES data are the only national\ndata examining changes in total diabetes\nprevalence (2).\nA final implication of our findings is\nthat greater detection of diabetes among\nthe most obese will result in a higher prev-\nalence of obesity among the population\nwith diagnosed diabetes. This is reflected\nin an average increase in BMI among in-\ndividuals with diagnosed diabetes from\ncontrolling obesity may become an even\ngreater focus in diabetes management and\nperhaps have implications for reducing\nthe incidence of obesity-related complica-\ntions, including hypertension, cardiovas-\ncular disease, and physical disability in\nthe population with diabetes.\nAn important caveat to our study is\nthat our analyses of total diabetes and the\nratio of diagnosed to undiagnosed take\nthe perspective of the current ADA diag-\nnostic criteria (fasting glucose level 126\nmg/dl) and assume these criteria were in\nuse throughout the surveys. In reality, di-\nagnostic standards changed considerably\nover this time, with no universal defini-\noral glucose tolerance tests in the 1980s\nand 1990s, followed by reliance on fasting\nglucose values and a lowering of the diag-\nthe ADA criteria retrospectively in these\nanalyses so that we could compare preva-\nlences of undiagnosed and total diabetes\nacross the latter three surveys. (Oral glu-\ncose tolerance test data were only avail-\nable for two surveys on subsamples of\nnately, we lack medical record validation\nof diabetes care to examine how cases\nwere truly diagnosed in the clinical setting\nor how this could have influenced our\nfindings. However, the DECODE study\nhas shown that using the ADA criteria is\nmore likely to detect obese persons than\nWorld Health Organization criteria (38).\nThus, it is conceivable that part of the\ngreater increase in proportion diagnosed\namong the obese reflects clinicians shift-\ning to the use of fasting glucose for diag-\nnostic purposes. However, we are un-\naware of data to either support or deny\nthis speculation.\nOur study has other limitations. First,\nthe analysis of trends is based on estimates\nof point prevalence. Estimates based on in-\ncidence would be an ideal way to assess\nshifts in diagnosed versus undiagnosed\ndiabetes because there is likely to be less\nvariation or confounding by differences in\ndisease duration at onset or by improved\nsurvival in recent decades. A second lim-\nitation is that we only had data on undi-\nagnosed diabetes in the most recent\nsurveys. Therefore, although we observed\nconsistent trends in diagnosed diabetes\ngeneralize only about effects on undiag-\nnosed diabetes and detection since 1976.\nThird, our analysis did not adjust for the\neffects of shifts in race and ethnicity over\nthe survey years because of changes in the\nway race and ethnicity were assessed. We\nalso lacked power to stratify our analysis\nby race and ethnicity to determine, for\nexample, whether the growth in the Mex-\nican-American population affected our\nfindings. However, when we excluded\nMexican Americans from our analyses, we\nfound essentially no difference in our\noverall findings. Finally, although our es-\ntimates come from large, nationally rep-\nresentative surveys, our estimates of\nundiagnosed diabetes, particularly in the\nmost recent survey, are based on relative-\nly small samples. More data to evaluate\nundiagnosed diabetes will be forthcom-\nFigure 1--Percentage of total diabetes cases that are diagnosed, by NHANES survey year and BMI category.\nDiabetes prevalence by obesity level\ning from the National Center for Health\nStatistics to allow further evaluation of\nundiagnosed diabetes, but other inves-\ntigators should explore these questions\nusing other currently available data, es-\npecially where glucose measurements ex-\ntend over several decades.\nIn summary, we demonstrate an in-\ncreasing prevalence of diagnosed diabetes\nthat is most prominent in overweight and\nobese persons and apparent increases in\ndiabetes detection among the most obese.\nOur findings of continued high preva-\nlence of undiagnosed cases indicates a\nneed to increase detection of diabetes\nacross the full spectrum of body weight.\nGiven the dynamic nature of the diabetes\nepidemic, along with the potential to in-\ncrease both prevention and detection of\nthe disease, continuing to track trends in\nboth diagnosed and undiagnosed diabe-\ntes will be increasingly important.\nUse of Bayesian hierarchical models\nAnalyses for this study were conducted us-\ning normal hierarchical Bayesian model\nwith noninformative prior distributions on\nmodel hyperparameters. A Bayesian ap-\nproach was preferred because inferences do\nnot depend on asymptotic assumptions.\nBayesian approaches make use of prior in-\nformation (or prior distributions) and syn-\nthesizes this information with the data\nthrough the use of Bayes theorem to pro-\nduce an updated distribution (or posterior\ndistribution). Bayesian probabilities have a\ndirect interpretation as the probability that\nthe hypotheses is true.\nOur Bayesian models have two levels.\nAt the first level, we specify a probability\ndistribution for the observed data.
