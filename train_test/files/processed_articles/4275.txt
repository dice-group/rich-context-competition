    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe drag queen cultural phenomenon has been described at length. However, the depiction of outlandish and hyperbolic\nwomanhood and taunting and formidable behavior at the core of drag queens' public persona has still to be fully accounted for.\nWe argue that these aspects of the drag queen's public appearance could best be understood in a signaling framework. Publicly\ndonning extravagant woman's costumes attracts harassment and brings financial, mating, and opportunity costs, generating the\nconditions for the transmission of honest signals. By successfully withstanding those odds, drag queen impersonators signal\nstrategic qualities to members of the gay community. Data collected among gay and straight participants support a costly signaling\nreading of the drag queen cultural phenomenon. Participants generally agree that successful drag queens typically incur costs,\nwhile gaining specific social benefits.\n",

The focus of\nour discussion is on the behavior of male impersonating female2\nrather than its opposite, female impersonating male, known as\ndrag kings, which are part of a recent phenomenon with specific\nfeatures and rationale that differ from its male counterpart (Rupp\net al., 2010). Cross-gender impersonators in the lesbian, gay,\nbisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) community are predomi-\nnantly male (Rupp et al., 2010). Drag queens explicitly distance\nthemselves from individuals who use either hormones or\nundergo gender reassignment surgery. These individuals are\nconsidered as not \"playing fair\" and are banned from participat-\ning in drag queen competitions (Berkowitz et al., 2007; Hopkins,\nIndividuals who endorse a drag queen public persona are\ngenerally in their late teens to 40s, with an average age in the\nTewksbury, 1993). The available research, based on small sam-\nple sizes, indicates that most female impersonators have\nachieved a low educational level, and their earnings are at the\nlower end of the income distribution (Berkowitz & Belgrave,\nnor when not in costume has often been noted in ethnographies\nof the drag queen scene (Friedman & Jones, 2011; Stru\n\u00a8bel-\ndescribed as \"not of the prescribed standard of gay beauty\"\n(Stru\nin the literature for becoming a drag queen include the desire of\nraising one's social standing, getting more involved in the gay\ncommunity, and starting a career in entertainment (Hopkins,\nDrag queens don their costumes primarily to perform at gay\nbars, nightclubs, and organized competitions (Berkowitz et al.,\nordinary female attires like that of transgender women but\nportray purposefully outlandish, often vulgar, and exaggerated\nTheatrics, choreographed dance, and lip-syncing to short\npopular musical numbers are part of club and bar shows\nincome thanks to spectators' tips. Only the most successful\ndrag queens can generate enough money to fully support their\nlivelihood (Berkowitz & Belgrave, 2010; Berkowitz et al.,\nimpersonators progressively build reputation and, for some,\nlocal fame, through patronizing and performing at bars and\ncabaret performances, the public wearing of drag queen attire\nis usually restricted to gay festivals or exceptional events (Taylor\n& Rupp, 2004). Of note, however, at the beginning of the fight\nfor gay rights in the 1960s, many less successful drag queens\n(aka street drags) would parade ostentatiously adorned through\nthe streets, often attracting the ire of passersby (Newton, 1972).\nThe literature depicts a typical portrait of a successful drag\nqueen's public persona made of playful rudeness (Friedman &\nunkind critical spirit (Friedman & Jones, 2011). Drag queen\nrole-play typically involves aggressive teasing and mocking of\nRupp, 2004). Boisterous displays comprising \"flesh flashing\"\nand focus on the male\u00adfemale duality of the drag queen persona\nare core components of public performances (Harris, 1995;\nFemale impersonators aggressively joke about their masculi-\nnity, at times calling attention to their tucked away penis,\nemphatically affirming that they are \"chicks with dicks\"\n2004). Their sustained involvement in public confrontations\nhas led to the characterizations of drag queens as militants,\nwarriors, and urban street fighters (Duberman, 2013; Feinberg,\nIndividuals wishing to become recognized female imperso-\nnators face many burdens. The financial expenses are signifi-\ncant. Costumes and makeup worth hundreds of dollars require\nsustained investments, seldom offset by the earnings from com-\npetitions or audience members' tips (Hopkins, 2004). Oppor-\ntunity costs are also high: successful performance depends on\nextensive rehearsal and sustained investments in self-\nSchacht, 2002). Ethnographic accounts support the idea that\nthese investments compete with maintaining more personal\nrelationships, which probably explains why female impersona-\ntors appear to face difficulty establishing enduring romantic\nrelationships (Berkowitz et al., 2007). Furthermore, costumes\nand makeup constitute potent sexual turnoffs, cutting off drag\nqueens from the available mate pool when engaged in public\ndisplay of their persona (Harris, 1995). They also face\nincreased risk of being harassed and discriminated against\ngiven the heightened social visibility to which their trade\nexposes them (Berkowitz & Belgrave, 2010; Berkowitz et al.,\nAmong the people who attempt to join the drag queen com-\nmunity, few become great successes. Amateurs have limited\nstatus recognition and are exposed to stinging criticism, mock-\nery, and gossip of their gay audiences (Berkowitz & Belgrave,\ntheir unrefined appearance and behavior (Hopkins, 2004).\nScrutiny from other drag queens is intense and competition for\nrecognition between impersonators is great (Berkowitz &\nFew paid professional opportunities are available at gay\nestablishments, intensifying rivalry (Hopkins, 2004). In some\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\ncommunities, the intense competition facilitates the emergence\nof \"drag families,\" with seniors controlling and mentoring\ncadets (Hopkins, 2004). These families do help in reducing the\ncosts of entry for beginners. However, impersonators who have\nsupport of such families generally do not garner as much\nrespect as those who succeed independently (Hopkins, 2004).\nContrasted with the intense pressure placed on amateurs,\nsuccessful impersonators end up commanding some authority\nin the gay community (Berkowitz & Belgrave, 2010; Berko-\nbegin with a low social endowment and status, gains in social\ncapital in the gay community can be significant.

These social and economic incentives make\nbecoming a drag queen an attractive venture for at-first-\nmarginalized low-status individuals in the gay community,\nwho may not have easier alternate opportunities to gain social\nacceptance and recognition.\nEmergence of the Modern-Day Social Phenomenon\nEarly descriptions in existing literary sources placed the first\nmanifestations of drag queens, akin to their modern-day instan-\ntime, gay sexual activities were illegal, systematically prose-\ncuted, and could result in capital punishment. Performances\nwere strictly restricted to audiences of gay men in meeting\nplaces called \"molly houses\" (Norton, 2016). Most of what is\nknown about these drag queens was discovered from raids on\nmolly houses and court proceedings (Norton, 2016).\nThe earliest appearances of gay female impersonators in\nAmerica recorded in the literature happened at masquerade\nballs held in New York City in the early 20th century\n(Chauncey, 1994). Such masquerades allowed individuals to\nconnect and to engage in same-sex courtship without being\ndirectly exposed to social sanctions. In the early 1930s, there\nwere several recorded instances of \"public disturbances\"\ninvolving female impersonators parading through the streets\nOut of the underground gay social networks of the early 20th\ncentury, predominately gay neighborhoods progressively\nemerged. Gay-only communities were well on their way to\nin those neighborhoods became prime locations to find same-\nsex romantic and sexual partners and to build social support\nneighborhoods provided a certain level of safety for their res-\nidents during the McCarthy era when gay people were purged\nfrom government jobs, and gay establishments were subjected\nto intense police surveillance and raiding (Loftin, 2007).\nTo avoid detection and the risks of harassment, job loss, or\narrest, gays publicly conformed to straight mannerisms.\n\"Swishes,\" feminine acting gays drawing attention from law\nenforcement, were openly despised (Loftin, 2007). The risk\nwas aggravated for gender nonconformists such as female\nIt was during this postwar period that drag queens emerged as\nsignificant players in the gay community (Arriola, 1995;\nthe violence opposing police and gay communities in both San\nIt is noteworthy that many of the female impersonators who\nCross-culturally, drag queens are now found in gay commu-\nnities throughout the Western world. Interestingly, the phe-\nnomenon has also appeared in regions where gay individuals\nface important social or legal persecution such as in Moscow\nAfrica (The Independent, 1999). Other cross-cultural examples\nsuch as the Khwaja Sira of Pakistan (Khan, 2014) or the Fa'a-\nfafine of Samoa (Vasey & Bartlett, 2007) share some simila-\nrities to the drag queen phenomenon (e.g., harassment,\nostracism, and hyperbolic displays of femininity). However,\nthose cultural manifestations have their respective specificities\nthat differentiate them from the modern-day Western drag\nqueen phenomenon. We focus solely on the latter.\nSignaling Theory as an Explanatory\nFramework for the Drag Queen\nPhenomenon\nSignaling theory has explained a wide variety of evolutionarily\npuzzling and, in appearance, extravagant behavior in animal\nspecies (Zahavi & Zahavi, 1999). The theory holds that in spe-\ncific conditions, an extraordinary (i.e., apparently nonfunctional)\nbehavior that communicates information about the sender can\nbecome evolutionarily stable if, on average, it conferred fitness\nbenefits to its sender (Maynard-Smith & Harper, 2003; Zahavi &\nZahavi, 1999). According to the handicap principal, such evo-\nlutionarily stable signal must have a specific characteristic to be\nreliable: it should be costly, rendering it hard to fake, a require-\nment if it is to be perceived as indubitable signal carrying honest\nAll signals, as opposed to signs, are manipulative, being\ndesigned to modify receivers' behavior (Dawkins & Krebs,\nan intended audience (e.g., potential mates, cooperative allies,\nand competitive adversaries). Whether or not a signal is effective\ninmanipulatingthebehaviorofothersdependsonthesignalbeing\ndetected by its intended receivers and the latter's skepticism\ntoward the honesty of the signal (Soler, Batiste, & Cronk, 2014).\nHumans use a host of costly signals to communicate honest\ninformation about themselves. For example, Meriam males\nsignal their leadership and organizational abilities by leading\nboat crews in quest for food sources in high variance in the\nenvironment, such as sea turtles, instead of foraging, which\nMoncrieff and Lienard 3\nwould be less risky while providing much greater caloric return\n(Bird et al., 2001). By organizing such turtle hunts, Meriam\nhunt leaders convey information about their abilities, skills, and\npotentials to prospective mates or cooperative partners. Bene-\nfits conferred to the signaler, such as increased mating oppor-\ntunity or social and political influence, may pay off in increased\noverall fitness (Bird et al., 2001). Other well-described\nexamples include, Ache men's signaling of cooperativeness\nby sharing more food than they receive from others (Gurven,\nAllen-Arave, Hill, & Hurtado, 2000), the purchasing of luxury\nbrands as a signal of wealth and status (Nelissen & Meijers,\n2011), and costly prorelationship acts as signals of commitment\nto romantic partners (Yamaguchi, Smith, & Ohtsubo, 2015).\nApparently irrational, extravagant, or risky behaviors, at\ntimes, also might serve a signaling function when, for instance,\ninformation about the quality of an agent is hard or costly to\nacquire or to infer in noisy environments. In these circum-\nstances, it might be beneficial for individuals to strategically\nemit indubitable signals of their qualities to potential partners.\nA risky behavior, given its inherent costs, might provide for an\nadequate honest signal. As Fessler, Tiokhin, Holbrook,\nGervais, and Snyder (2014) have shown, deliberate risk-taking\nincreases perceptions of formidability, with men engaging in\nsuch behavior typically perceived as larger, stronger, and more\nviolent than others. However, formidability is likely to be sig-\nnaled by more than just sheer strength and observable physical\nattributes. Other factors such as cues of resoluteness and size of\nsocial support also increase an agent's perceived formidability\nSignaling one's formidability in particular social environ-\nments, such as those characterized by conflict and competition,\nis likely to be beneficial for deterring potential adversaries and\nfor attracting potential allies. Gambetta (2009) found that pris-\noners often use deliberate self-harm to signal fierceness and\nfearlessness in the highly constrained social environment of cor-\nrectional facilities. Displays of self-harm are particularly com-\nmon in prison environments with high inmate turnover and\nunstable social hierarchies. Such signaling allows individuals\nwho are not naturally physically formidable to broadcast to large\naudiences a disposition for fierceness approximating extreme\nirrational impulsivity, hence affording them some protection\nfrom aggression in the closed prison world. Martinez and\nLienard (2015) in a survey of study cases in the Human\nRelations Area Files (eHRAF World Cultures, 2014) found that\ninstitutionalized public displays of deliberate self-harm are\nsystematically associated with social environments character-\nized by low social mobility and competition between marked\nand ranked social units. Participants are more likely to be young\nadult males who lack access to other more ordinary status enhan-\ncers, such as wealth, and human and social capitals.\nThe gay community has historically shared many of the char-\nacteristics of social worlds where costly signaling can emerge. It\nis a community that has been ostracized from mainstream soci-\nety and has responded by a self-imposed isolation to escape\npersecutions. In some respects, the gay community constitutes\na protected social world with its own organization, rules of\ncourtship and socialization, behavioral norms, and an exacer-\nbated mating and status competition (Bailey, Gaulin, Agyei, &\nBrown, 1995).3 Youth, physical attractiveness, and potential for\nuncommitted sex play an essential role in mate searching (Bailey\net al., 1994). An increased interest in younger partners correlates\nwith seekers' age (Kenrick et al., 1995). These mate preferences\nprobably contribute to the observed enhanced competition in the\ngay mating market. Of note, the gay community has a high\nprevalence of body dissatisfaction and eating disorders, support-\ning the view of an intensely competitive mating landscape\n(Kaminski, Chapman, Haynes, & Own, 2005; Russell & Keel,\nOn average, gay men also prefer men who describe themselves\nas masculine rather than feminine (Bailey, Kim, Hills, &\nLinsenmeier, 1997), and feminine gay men regularly report dis-\ncrimination from other gay men (Taywaditep, 2001). The drag\nqueen phenomenon gains to be understood against such general\nbackdrop of mate preferences and highly competitive mating\nmarket. The drag queen persona combines both the donning of\nparticular attires (i.e., strictly speaking, the handicap, which is,\nthe exaggerated feminine appearance) and a typical behavior\n(i.e., the stance, assertive, and provocative). The antithesis,\nnamely, the association of aggressive provocation and exagger-\nated feminine markers, constitutes the entirety of the signaling.\nAs previously mentioned, beginner drag queens are younger\nindividuals often lacking more traditional status-enhancing\nmeans such as attractiveness, education, and wealth (Berkowitz\nThere is significant evidence that by donning their costumes and\nmakeup drag queens increase their risks of being exposed to\nharassment and humiliation, violence or ostracism, loss of mat-\ning opportunities, and associated opportunity costs (Berkowitz\nnonconformist practices, impersonators might at the very same\ntime achieve some recognition, as successful performances can\nbe perceived as public displays of one's claim to possess the\nability to take on any associated challenge. Impersonators com-\nmunicate resoluteness and fearlessness, in brief, a type of social\nformidability. In competitive environments, formidable\nindividuals are able to bargain for their own welfare and attract\ncoalitional allies more easily than less formidable agents (Sell,\nTooby, & Cosmides, 2009). For low-status entrepreneurial indi-\nviduals, with little to lose, unwilling to accept the ranking\nascribed by some of their observable attributes, the potential\npayoffs of risk-taking behaviors should be very attractive.\nThus, the hyperbolic and extravagant expressions of\nwomanhood characteristic of drag queen personas call atten-\ntion to extraordinary behaviors and the associated costs that\ncome with it. Its typical confrontational attribute is a prominent\nreminder of some type of formidability. The historical record of\ndrag queens' participation as lead figures during prominent\n1960s countercultural riots supports the characteristic of pug-\nnacity associated with a drag queen persona (Arriola, 1995;\nHillman, 2011). Portraits of drag queens as militant\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\nrisk-takers are also readily documented in contemporary\nIn order to assess whether signaling theory is an appropriate\nmodel for understanding the drag queen phenomenon, we need to\naddress four main questions: (1) Do people perceive the typical\nfeatures presented in the literature on the drag queen persona? (2)\nIs the signaling dimension of the impersonation better perceived\nby gays? (3) Are gays overall more knowledgeable about the\ndrag queen cultural practice? and (4) Are the costs involved in\nimpersonating understood? These questions have not been\nexplored in the literature yet. We relied on a survey measure\ndistributed to members of the gay community and of the general\npublic to explore these matters.\nMethod\nParticipants\nWe used two participant pools: (1) a sample of members of the\ngay community recruited through online social media groups\nand (2) a general population sample reached through Amazon's\nMechanical Turk\u00ae (MTurk). The University of Nevada Las\nVegas' institutional review board approved the research. Parti-\ncipants were screened and excluded for incomplete survey\nresponses (n \u00bc 55). Not being the target of this study, individ-\nuals who perform as drag queens (n \u00bc 11) were excluded from\nthe analysis. In order to maximize the differences between the\ntwo samples of participants and to reduce the risk of potential\nnoise, bisexuals (n \u00bc 24) were also excluded from our two\nsamples.\nself-reported that they were only attracted to men (ages 18\u00ad74,\ninvited to participate through messages posted on gay social\ngroup Facebook\u00ae pages such as I'm Gay and I love it, Gay Face-\nbook, and Gay California. These social groups were chosen as\nrecruitment sources because many of their members are currently\nactive within the gay community attending gay bars and night-\nclubs on a regular basis. Furthermore, these online social groups\nallowed us to sample gay individuals from a broad range of gay\ncommunities throughout the United States. Membership of those\nentered into a drawing to win a US$50 gift card.\nIn order to compare the perceptions of gay individuals to\nthose of the general population, a second sample was recruited\nfrom the Internet using MTurk website. The sample consisted\nwhere one posts tasks to be completed for a certain compensa-\ntion. Participants recruited through MTurk are fairly represen-\ntative of the U.S. population (Buhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling,\n2011). Recruitment was limited to the United States. Eight\nparticipants who self-identified as gay and 16 that self-\nidentified as bisexual were removed from the sample, leaving\nthese participants, 50% reported being only attracted to females\nand 49% reported being only attracted to males.\nThese participants were compensated US$0.40 for their\ntime. Individuals of the first and second samples had compa-\nrable levels of education, with 71% and 62%, respectively,\nhaving completed at least some postsecondary education. The\nrespective mean ages of 29 and 34 years indicate that the\nmajority of our participants were in prime years of mate seek-\ning and sexual (and, for some, reproductive) activities.\nMaterials: Perception of Drag Queens Survey\nA great deal of the drag queen research has concentrated on\ndrag queens and their perceptions of the gay community (e.g.,\nTaylor & Rupp, 2004) or on the interaction between gays and\ndrag queens (e.g., Berkowitz et al., 2007). One exception to this\nis a recent study on hypermasculinity and drag queen stereo-\ntypes (Bishop, Kiss, Morrison, Rushe, & Specht, 2014). We\nexpanded on the objectives of this research in investigating to a\ngreater extent gays' perception of drag queens. It should be\nnoted that we are not interested in the personal experience of\ndrag queens; rather, we focus on the communicative aspect of\ntheir behavior. We are also not attempting to test a specific\nmodel; instead we use an exploratory approach to show how\nour framework can help make sense of aspects of the phenom-\nenon previously described in the literature. For the purpose of\nour research, we specifically designed a set of original survey\ninstruments. Participants evaluated 47 statements (see Table\nA1) focused on five categories (Table 1).\nProcedure\nParticipants were directed to the Qualtrics survey website after\nclicking on the hyperlink at the bottom of the online advertise-\nment. They gave their consent to participate by checking a\nradio button before accessing the survey. Participants were first\nasked three free response questions:\n(1) \"Have you ever thought of performing in drag? If so,\nwhat are some of the reasons for why you considered\nperforming?\"\n(2) \"Why do you think most drag queens perform?\"\n(3) \"What is your definition of a drag queen?\"\nTable 1. Foci of the 50 Questions.\n1. The assessment of\nthe behavior\nFor example, \"drag queens must be more\nhonest than others in the gay community\"\n2. The benefits and the\ncosts\nFor example, \"individuals who perform in\ndrag face potential ridicule or insult from\nstraight people\"\n3. The physical and\nsocial attributes\nFor example, \"drag queens, not dressed in\ndrag, are likely to be more physically\nattractive than the average individual in\ntheir gay community\"\n4. The social world of\ndrag queens\nFor example, \"there is a great deal of\ncompetition between drag queens within\nthe drag community\"\n5. The drag queen\nfunctions\nFor example, \"drag queens are essential in\nfighting for gay rights and equality\"\nMoncrieff and Lienard 5\nIn order to ensure that participants properly understood the\nconcept of drag queen, the following definition from the\nOxford dictionary (Drag queen, 2014) was provided immedi-\nately after they had answered the three previous questions: A\nhomosexual man who dresses as a woman especially to enter-\ntain people.\nParticipants were then instructed to read the following\nsentences: Take a moment to think about drag queens in\nyour community. What, do you think, are some of their\nimportant traits? Please indicate how much you agree or\ndisagree with the following statements as they pertain to\ndrag queens. Participants evaluated a series of 43 statements\nplotting their response on a 7-point Likert-type scale rang-\ning from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). State-\nments included, for example, drag queens are more\ntrustworthy than others in the gay community, and drag\nqueens must be more blunt than others in the gay commu-\nnity. By asking participants to respond in this manner, we\nwere looking for stereotypic responses. Stereotypes are cog-\nnitive structures that can be useful in understanding how\nindividuals calibrate and adapt their behavior when interact-\ning with others (Fiske & Neuberg, 1990). Some questions\nsuch as is there such a thing as a fake drag queen? allowed\nfor free response once the participant responded in the affir-\nmative. In the present case, when the participant's answer\nwas positive, he was directed to a new screen where a short\nanswer question box appeared, asking the subject, what\nwould make a fake drag queen? Given that the participants\nfrom our MTurk sample (i.e., general population) might not\nhave been familiar with the drag queen phenomenon, parti-\ncipants were instructed to answer the questions to the best\nof their knowledge. Following the survey questions, partici-\npants responded to more general questions about their invol-\nvement in the gay community, such as how often they\nattend gay nightclubs or bars, and additional general demo-\ngraphic information.\nResults\nKnowledge of the General Phenomenon\nGiven the heterogeneous covariance matrices between gay and\nstraight samples when examining the full set of variables, a\nquadratic discriminant analysis was performed to determine\nwhether the items derived from the literature discriminated\nbetween the responses of the gay and straight participants. The\nreclassification of cases was highly successful: 98.33% of the\noriginal grouped cases were correctly reclassified into their\noriginal categories and 74.17% of cross-validated cases were\ncorrectly classified (Table 2). These results indicate that the\ngay sample has a response pattern that distinguishes them from\nthe straight sample participants. In addition, Mann\u00adWhitney\nU tests indicated that there were significant differences\nbetween our straight and gay sample for 28 of the 43 variables\nStereotypic Features of the Phenomenon\nWe wanted to examine whether participants in both our sam-\nples perceive the typical attributes of the drag queen persona\nthat is described in the literature. Items with the strongest\nlevel of agreement (>70% agreement) after combining\nresponses (strongly agree to somewhat agree/strongly dis-\nagree to somewhat disagree) within the gay and the straight\nsamples were selected for further analysis leaving 18 vari-\nables (Table 4).\nDiscriminant analysis determined which of these variables\nbest predicted membership in the straight or gay sample. Pre-\nvious research found discriminant analysis to be robust when\nanalyzing skewed data (Sever, Lajovic, & Rajer, 2005). The\ncanonical variables was successful: 70% of the cases were\ncorrectly reclassified into their original categories. Table 5\nshows the independent variables, which are strongly associated\nwith discriminant function 1 (r > .3) and distinguish between\nparticipants from our straight sample and gay sample. Items\nthat did not discriminate well between the two groups included:\nIndividuals who perform in drag face potential physical assault\nfrom straight people (r \u00bc .168), Individuals who perform in\ndrag face potential ridicule or insult from straight people (r \u00bc\n.136), and Individuals while performing in drag sexually\nParticipants in the gay sample appear to have greater\nknowledge of certain aspects of the drag queen phenom-\nenon. We wanted to further explore within the gay sample\nwhat features are most clearly recognized.

One thing seems to\nbe essential though, for both our samples, having to with-\nstand affronts and offenses is a core feature of the drag\nqueen phenomenon.\nGay nightclubs and bars are places for effectively broad-\ncasting traits and dispositions to large audience. However,\nthe cost involved in endorsing a drag queen persona seems\nto be perceived widely, even by members of our nongay\nsample much less likely to be directly exposed to drag\nqueens (among our straight sample 77% indicated they had\nnever been to a gay establishment). The signal is likely to\nbe received even more strongly by the gay community,\ngiven what gay individuals know about the cost of expres-\nsing publicly one's nonconformist sexual orientation. In the\nverbal abuse or threats during their lifetime because of their\nsexual orientation and 24% were victims of physical assault\nhad been verbally assaulted or abused (Herek, 2009). To\nsum up, our data show that the cost of being a female\nimpersonator is the main factor about which most partici-\npants agree that it is a core part of adopting a drag queen\npersona.\nIs the Signaling Dimension of the Impersonation Better\nPerceived by Gays?\nWhile the general cost associated with being a drag queen is\nperceived by both samples, the results of the quadratic discri-\nminant analysis indicate that the response patterns of the two\nsamples are dissimilar, suggesting that our two pools of parti-\ncipants have distinct knowledge of the phenomenon. Review of\nthe items with the highest level of agreement within the two\npopulations shows that only 9 items reached 70% agreement\nwithin our straight sample, whereas 18 items exceeded 70%\nagreement within our gay sample indicating that our gay parti-\ncipants are much more likely to have a definite opinion than our\nstraight participants, suggesting that certain aspects of the sig-\nnal may be intended more narrowly for a gay audience.\nDiscriminant analysis of the items with the highest level of\nagreement within the two populations shows that items asso-\nciated with sociality and formidably (e.g., it is not wise to\nupset a drag queen, successful drag queens are considered\nto be local celebrities in the gay community, drag queens\ntypically have a greater social network than others in the gay\ncommunity) were the best items for discriminating between\nthe responses of our straight and gay participants. This lends\nsupport to our claim that the gay community might be the\nprime target of the drag queen signaling.\nTable 6.

Factor 2 has been reverse scored.\nMoncrieff and Lienard 9\nAre Gays Overall More Knowledgeable About the Drag\nQueen Cultural Practice?\nThe underlying structure of the stereotypic features identified\nby the factor analysis for our gay sample is consistent with a\ncostly signaling model. As previously described, the cost of\nthe behavior is clearly recognized among our gay participants.\nThose participants typically insist that drag queens do not\nconstitute interesting potential mates hence, readily acknowl-\nedge the mating costs. Undoubtedly, by donning their special\napparel and behaving outlandishly, female impersonators\nremove themselves from the mate market precisely where\nfinding partners typically takes place, gay nightclubs and\nbars. Furthermore, participants understand well that drag\nqueens increase their exposure to harassment and violence.\nThe withstanding of those costs allows for the honest actua-\nlization of the sender's formidability.\nDrag queens are also perceived to be socially formidable\nand invested individuals with influence in the gay community.\nBeing a recognized and successful drag queen means being\nwilling to engage in aggressive behavior and endorse the role\nof provocateur. Among our gay participants 73% agree that it is\nnot wise to upset a drag queen (only 5% disagreed). This state-\nment is also the most discriminant item between our gay and\nstraight participants. The involvement of drag queens in many\nearly confrontations between the gay community and police\nforces, as well as contemporary accounts of female impersona-\ntors' attitude at gay pride events, provides evidence of the role\nexpectation of provocation that comes with acting the part of a\nNote that the social might associated with formidability\nis often imposed on others. Social agents would rather have\na formidable individual on their side than against them.\nInterestingly, the results of a recent study suggest that gays\nwho score higher on a masculinity measure were more\nlikely to perceive negatively valence attributes, such as\nmelodramatic and emotional affectations, as more character-\nistic of drag queens (Bishop et al., 2014). The scale used in\nthe study evaluating masculine traits included statements\nsuch as I value power over other people and I don't mind\nphysical violence to defend what I have; the types of dis-\npositions that strongly correlate with formidability. Bishop,\nKiss, Morrison, Rushe, and Specht (2014) suggest that\nmales who endorse a strong \"masculine\" ideal may hold\nnegative views of drag queens because they violate gender\nnorms that they hold dear. However, it is plausible that gay\nindividuals scoring high in masculinity perceive female\nimpersonators as rivals competing through different means\nfor status and social recognition.\nConclusion\nThe potential benefit of social upward mobility gained from\ndisplaying specific forms of formidability seems to be a major\nfeature that makes the drag queen institution attractive to some.\nThe social ecology of the gay community resembles other\nenvironments propitious to institutionalized displays of formid-\nrespect, it is noteworthy that the timing of the radicalization of\nthe phenomenon coincides with an era when the gay commu-\nnity was once again under threat of violence and ostracism\nfrom mainstream society.\nA universal disposition for status seeking likely drives\nthe behavior of drag queens. Costly signaling allows for the\nhonest communication of information about the qualities of\nthe signaler, which eventually can lead to fitness gains. The\nsexual behavior of gay individuals is typically decoupled\nfrom reproductive fitness consequences. In this case, uni-\nversal cognitive mechanisms motivate status- and partner-\nseeking behavior regardless of any potential reproductive\nfitness payoff.\nThe competition between drag queens signaling their for-\nmidability facilitates the emergence of a hierarchy. Drag fam-\nilies are the outcome of this self-organization of groups of\ncompetitors. Drag mothers, or successful drag queens, at the\ntop of the hierarchy, benefit from their elevated social status.\nSocial influence, authority, status, and increased social capital\nare gained the higher one climbs the ladder of success. The\nmost notable drag queens may also eventually gain greater\naccess to sexual partners, however, we currently lack the data\nto ascertain that possibility.\nOur research adds to the evidence that supports a costly\nsignaling account of the emergence of the drag queen phe-\nnomenon. However, some limitations of our research will\nhave to be addressed in the future. We relied on online\nsampling for collecting our data. While our samples appear\nrelatively diverse, they may not be representative enough of\nthe gay or straight population. Furthermore, our research\nfocus was on signal receivers rather than on the signalers\nthemselves. Data on drag queen demographics, benefits\nobtained, and actual rate of violence to which they are\nexposed (compared to other members of the gay commu-\nnity) need to be collected to strengthen a costly signaling\naccount of the phenomenon. Further, experimental study of\nthe motivations for engaging in drag queen behavior is also\nrequired.\nGiven the intriguing historical legacy of the drag queen\nphenomenon, we may wonder what will be its future trajec-\ntory? Our findings leave us with additional questions. As\nacceptance of LGBTQ people from mainstream society\nincreases, thereby relaxing the costs of advertising one's sexual\norientation in public, will a drag queen persona no longer be\ncostly enough to allow social outliers to gain capital by adopt-\ning it? As costs continue to be reduced over time, will the drag\nqueen phenomenon be reinterpreted into simply a theatrical\nvestige of the gay community's former conditions? The phe-\nnomenon may indeed become more folkloric than functional. A\nsimilar trajectory was followed by the pride parades: Although\ngay pride parades were once serious platforms for demands of\npolitical and social changes, they are now large inclusive fes-\ntive parties.\n10 Evolutionary Psychology\nAppendix A\nTable A1.
