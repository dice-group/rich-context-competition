    "reduced_content": "Emotion Review\ner.sagepub.com\nThe interdisciplinary field of emotion studies ignores the his-\ntorical perspective on translation problems. In today's scientific\npublications, which are predominantly written in English, the\nterm \"emotion\" is used as if it were synonymous in all lan-\nguages, times, and contexts. Although the semantic fields of\nemotion terms are not identical in English, French, and German,\nthese three languages informed the study of emotion in 19th-\ncentury psychology, at the time when the scientific concept of\nemotion was formed. Furthermore, the French \u00e9motion and the\nEnglish emotion have become homonyms, sentiment and senti-\nment are not used in the same way, and Affekt also poses a prob-\nlem. Translation problems have masked the epistemological\nproblems that German and French psychologists in the 19th\ncentury were studying when they addressed the question of\n\"emotion\" for contemporary Anglophone psychologists and\nhistorians of emotion. Problems of translation occur on many\nlevels. Here I am particularly concerned with two aspects, one\nis the historical authors' reading of each other and writing about\nthe same topic in a different language (applying their respective\nbackgrounds to their readings); and, the second is contemporary\nscientists and historians'reading of historical and contemporary\ntexts on emotion, applying the current connotation of emotion.\nThat translation or cross-linguistic differences represent a\nproblem or a challenge for emotion studies has been addressed\nby linguists, such as Wierzbicka (Imprisoned in English, 2014),\nby Mandler (Mind and Emotion, 1975), for psychology, and by\nCassin (Vocabulaire europ\u00e9en des philosophies: dictionnaire\ndes intraduisibles, 2004), for philosophy. The German terms\nGef\u00fchl and Empfindung are part of the collection of terms which\nphilosophers in earlier times transcribed in the original language\nwithout translating them. In this article, I adopt the same strat-\negy in order to call attention to the non-Anglophone connota-\ntions that informed the scientific concept of \"emotion\" at its\ninception. The problem is particularly relevant at a moment\nwhen all scientific work has to be published in English in order\nto count. Montgomery (2013) points out that \"MostAnglophone\nresearchers are monolingual and cite only papers in English\"\n(p. 105). While for him English is beneficial to science because\nnow scientists are finally able to \"communicate directly with\neach other,\" linguists stress what is lost through the\nAnglocentrism that dominates humanist scholarship.Wierzbicka\n(2014) holds that \"every language equips its speakers with a\nparticular set of cognitive tools for seeing and interpreting the\nworld\" (p. 3).

Indeed, not only are non-English frames absent from\ncurrent accounts on emotions in psychology, but 19th-century\npsychology is invisible to scholars today, who are studying\nquestions concerning emotion and cognition that psychologists\nalready once raised (Farrell, 2014). Contemporary textbooks of\nhistories of emotion (Dixon, 2003), to give some representative\nexamples, cite Darwin and James as the relevant historical\nauthorities for emotion.\nWhat I want to point out here is that the German origins of\npsychophysiology are key for the understanding of \"emotion\"\nin scientific texts. Part of the definitional issues on the nature of\nemotion that arose in the late 19th century and are hotly debated\nagain a century later, are related to issues of translation from\nGerman to French to English, and English to French by the\n19th-century psychologists. Beginning with the work of\n1890), to put it briefly. The relevant source for the \"concept of\nemotion\" in psychology, and also in Anglophone psychology,\nwas German and French scientific psychology (Clarke &\nJacyna, 1987). In the 19th century, students from all over the\nworld flocked to Germany in order to train in the new disci-\npline of experimental psychology (Boring, 1950; Bringmann &\nTweney, 1980). At the ground of what is discussed in today's\nresearch on emotion lies the question of the German Gef\u00fchl, its\nnature and role in cognition. Wundt in particular detailed on\nmany accounts how Gef\u00fchl might be created in the brain, how\nit might influence processes of cognition, and how it might\nbeyond John Stuart Mill's associationism (Fahrenberg, 2011).\nFor reading the German scientific texts, the French meaning of\n\u00e9motion rather than the contemporary English meaning of\n\"emotion\" must be taken as the basis. \u00c9motion and emotion\nwere once used as synonyms, as can be seen in the writings of\nHume and in language dictionaries from then 1880s, however,\nthey no longer are so.\nPernau (2012) highlights that languages are no \"naturally\ngiven entities\" but are created by the historical exchanges of the\nactors that use them, adding new meanings and incorporating\nnonnative elements. Today, the conventional use of the English\n\"emotion\" in colloquial contexts immediately prompts the asso-\nciation of love and hate and, in scientific contexts, of the six\n\"basic emotions,\" happiness, sadness, fear, anger, disgust, and\nsurprise, which are often treated like a fixed entity. Much schol-\narly ink is spilled over the existence of basic emotions, defini-\ntions, classification, expression, and cultural specificity. (See\nthe discussion in the special section on Defining Emotion in\nEmotion Review, 2012.) The medical literature uses the term\nemotion often in a generic sense, connoting feeling, basic\narousal, unconscious processing, or emotional processing in the\nnervous system (Hillman, 1960). This is closer to the use that\nGerman psychophysiologists made of Gef\u00fchl and which was\ntranslated as emotion.\nHistorians who alerted to the role of language in a \"science\nof emotion\" left out the perspectives of the German psycho-\nDixon \"very nicely illustrates\" that,\n[T]he definitional criteria of the term emotion in English has changed in\nhistorical time and was, in part, originally defined by the concerns of\nscientists. However, contemporary usage of emotion by English\nspeakers doesn't always correspond to the myriad scientific\nHistorians of emotions began analyzing the shifting emotional\nencyclopedia entries (Scheer et al., 2014) but did not include\nscientific texts, nor did they consider the issue of translation\nbetween German, French, and English in the 19th century.\nLinguists seek nonethnocentric ways for analyzing language in\norder to get out of the conceptual cage that the English language\nrepresents, because it is taken as the \"standard in relation to\nwhich all other languages and cultures can be analyzed and\nthat a natural semantic metalanguage (NSM) can free us from\nconventions of speaking and framing things in the historically\nshaped conceptual vocabulary of English. Fabrega (2012, p.\n318) assumes that such a theory of arguably \"self-evident, self-\nexplanatory concepts which all natural languages build on\" rep-\nresents the key for understanding, for instance, how humans\nwere able to develop communication about their pain. Goddard\n(2014) suggests that the NSM also allows including the study of\nvocal interjections in the analysis of emotions, as they convey\nemotional meaning. The aim of the scientific work in experi-\nmental psychology in the 19th century was to go beyond the\nalleged self-evidence of Gef\u00fchl, Empfindung, feeling, thinking,\nand perceiving.\nIn the following lines, I turn to the conceptual distinctions\nmade by 19th-century psychologists. First, I show how German\npsychology in the 19th century reflected on the use of emotion\nterms such as Gef\u00fchl, Empfindung, and Affekt. Then I turn to the\nuses of \u00e9motion and emotion, and sentiment and sentiment in\nhistorical French dictionaries and in translations to illustrate the\nsemantic field and problem set that experimental psychologists\naddressed. Concluding I hope to show that the historical diagno-\nsis of contemporary psychology's ills is incomplete and even\nmisleading, when it leaves out the non-Anglophone scientific\ntexts that provided the basis for the contemporary concept of\nemotion in experimental psychology.\nWhile in the British case, as Dixon (2003) argued, a new\nterm was introduced, emotion replaced passion, in the German\ncase the terms Gef\u00fchl, Empfindung, Affect, and Leidenschaft\nremained, but the ways in which they were used in psychology\nreviewed the shifting meanings of emotion terms in philosophy,\nIn his chronology of the psychology of emotions he noted that\nGerman philosophy from Christian Wolff to Kant was the\nWassmann Forgotten Origins, Occluded Meanings 165\nSince the 17th century, several Gef\u00fchle had been described in\nconsiderable detail, but ethical considerations, questions of\nlogic, and practical considerations were always admixed in the\npsychological reflection. According to his analysis of\nGef\u00fchlspsychologie, the psychology of emotion began with\nAristotle's Nichomachean Ethics, which remained a canonical\ntext that was still highly influential in the 18th century. At the\nturn of the 19th century, Kant's Anthropologie in pragmatischer\nHinsicht (1880) and Maas's Versuch \u00fcber die Leidenschaften\nthat time, the terms Gem\u00fcth (mind), Seele (soul), Geist (spirit),\nand Bewusstsein (consciousness) were used indiscriminately.\nKant used the notion of \"Vorstellungen, die im Gem\u00fcth woh-\nnen,\" ideas that live in the mind. The distinction between\nGem\u00fcth and Geist (mind vs. spirit) was introduced by Johann\nGottlieb Fichte (1808). The romantic literature established the\nterm Gef\u00fchl, differentiating more passive and more active or\nlasting aspects of emotions. Gef\u00fchl was linked to specific ideas;\nit \"excited\" but did not yet \"move\" the Gem\u00fcth into action.\nGef\u00fchl was an excitation that remained on the surface. Gef\u00fchl\nwas part of--but not equivalent to--motivation, desire, and\naction. \"Eine Gem\u00fcthserregung, welche nicht das ganz Gem\u00fcth\nergreift, sondern an einzelne Vorstellungen gebunden, gewisser-\nmassen an der Oberfl\u00e4che desselben bleibt, eine Erregung, aber\nIn contrast to Gef\u00fchl stood Leidenschaft, which signified a last-\ning orientation of Gem\u00fcth in a particular direction--an inclina-\ntion towards one specific form of pleasure or one particular\npain, a single specific activity that the mind could not direct its\nwas the first to analyze the psychic processes of Gef\u00fchl in their\nown right and strictly from a psychological point of view.\nThe evolution of the usage of emotion terms was prefigured\nby the Latin term \"affectus,\" which signified a mighty but pass-\ning excitation, \"heftige Gem\u00fcthserregung oder ein Begehren\nvon qualitativ unbestimmter Natur,\" a strong movement of the\nmind or a desire of qualitative indistinct nature, whereas passio\nimplied the suffering condition of body or soul, which was\nterm Leidenschaft was introduced into German in the late 17th\ncentury in translation of Descartes' Passion de l'\u00e2me. Indeed,\nthe evolution of meaning of the terms Affect and Leidenschaft\nwas entirely due to Descartes, who called attention \"to the active\nsuffering could be considered an \"action\" because it required an\nacting person. De Spinoza (1981, Part III, Def. 3) used Affect as\na general term and distinguished between active and passive\nsuffering, Affecte oder Leidenschaften. This distinction disap-\npeared in German philosophy until Kant reintroduced it when\nhe theorized on the development and duration of the affection\nbecame a \"lasting inclination,\" a tendency to (re)act that was\nhard to overcome through rational deliberation, \"eine durch die\nVernunft des Subjects schwer oder gar nicht bezwingliche\nimpulse, an emotion or feeling of a pleasure or a pain \"in the\npresent,\" which did not prompt the individual to reflect on\nwhether it was right or wrong to give in to it in the heat of the\nmoment, \"das Gef\u00fchl einer Lust oder Unlust im gegenw\u00e4rtigen\nZustand, welches im Subject die Ueberlegung...nicht aufkom-\nLeidenschaften as \"diseases of the soul/mind\" (Kant, 1838, p.\n170) Krankheiten des Gem\u00fcths. The notion is retained particu-\nlarly in Affekthandlung, crime of passion. Reflection on long-\nterm outcomes is not invited when in the grip of strong emotions.\nKant's point is consistent with the French dictionaries' idea that\nsentiment is stronger than mere thought. The dictionaries\nexpressed what still holds true today: people are strongly con-\nvinced that what they \"feel\" is true, much more strongly than\nwhat they merely guess or voice an opinion about.\nNineteenth-century psychology retained solely the temporal\ndistinction in Kant's definition; namely, Affect was a \"passing\nexcitation,\" \"vorr\u00fcbergehende Gem\u00fcthsbewegung\" (Wund,\nof the psyche, dauernde Gem\u00fcthsausrichtung (Wundt, 1891,\np. 341). Psychology abandoned the pathological connotation of\nLeidenschaft; it no longer spoke of Leidenschaften as diseases\nof the mind. In this use of the term, \"scientific psychology\"\nreturned to the way Leidenschaft had been used in the romantic\nliterature in the 18th century, where it stood for both positive\nnot, however, included in the psychophysiological analysis of\nGef\u00fchl, because it was considered a special case and not part of\nthe fundamental principles of cognition.\nGef\u00fchl and Empfindung\nThe terms Gef\u00fchl and Empfindung, emotion and sensation, were\nused as follows: Empfindung was seen as the more internal, the\ninnermost self, das mehr Innerliche und Subjective, whereas\nGef\u00fchl was seen as the more objective and external, das\nAeusserliche und Objective. The sense of touch, Tastsinn, was\ncalled Gef\u00fchlssinn, feeling sense. The excitation of the senses of\nhearing and seeing were called sensations, Empfindungen.\nHowever, as Wundt pointed out, psychological language in the\n19th century inverted the meaning of Gef\u00fchl and Emfindung:\nwhat was called f\u00fchlen at the beginning of the century was\ncalled empfinden at the end of the century, and vice versa. The\nway in which psychology at the end of the 19th century used\nf\u00fchlen and empfinden would be this, \"We perceive it as green,\nwe feel it as pleasurable,\" Wir empfinden es gr\u00fcn, und wir f\u00fch-\nlen es angenehm. In his monograph about the bodily expres-\nsions of psychic states, \u00dcber die k\u00f6rperlichen \u00c4usserungen\npsychischer Zust\u00e4nde, the German neurologist Berger (1904)\nnoted the inverted use of the terms Empfindung und Gef\u00fchl that\nthe physiological and the psychological literature of his time\nwas making.\nEmpfindung designated each and every qualitative excitation\nof consciousness (conscious awareness), Erregung des\nBewusstseins, which could become part of objective ideas. For\ninstance, when taken in isolation color, warmth, and a simple\nsound were sensations, Empfindungen. The subjective reaction\nto color, warmth, or sound, however, was Gef\u00fchl. One should\nadd that \"objective\" and \"subjective\" were used in a value-free\nmanner. Objective simply meant having an object to which a\nchange of state that the brain perceived was causally attributa-\nble. For instance, when the grass turns black as the sun goes\ndown, the cause lies outside of us. When we feel a tooth ache,\nthe cause lies in us.\nGef\u00fchl was subjective because the cause of the perceived\nchange laid inside of us. In Wundt's view Gef\u00fchl was a judg-\nment with relation to us. It was a mode of thought, a quality of\nconscious awareness which was tied to central nervous process-\ning, an bestimmte centrale Gehirnvorg\u00e4nge gebundene\nGef\u00fchl expressed our inner attitude to external excitations,\nthoughts, or memories. Wundt pointed out that the emotion\nterms were used differently in different realms, scientific and\nesthetic. In particular, in the field of aesthetics the terms\nEmpfindung and Gef\u00fchl were still used indiscriminately, and in\nthe same way as they had been used in psychology at the begin-\ndomain, Empfindung designated the most ethereal sentiment,\nwhereas in the medical literature, the same term designated the\nmost primitive visceral sensation.\nThe problem is still with us today. Different connotations of\nEmpfindung are evoked in the medical disciplines and humani-\nties. This causes misunderstandings in transdisciplinary debates.\nContemporary biomedical literature (H\u00fcther, 2010) conceptual-\nizes the \"emotional-cognitive\" development as linked and clas-\nsifies brain processes in hierarchical order from bottom up,\nfrom simple to most complex: K\u00f6rperzustand, Emotion, Gef\u00fchl,\nEmpfindung, body state, emotion, feeling, sentiment.\nthe 19th-century psychophysiological literature, Empfindung\nwas situated at the bottom, on the same plane as sinnliche\nGef\u00fchle, sense feelings, followed by Affekte (Wundt, 1863,\n\"higher order emotions\" and concepts, h\u00f6here Gef\u00fchle and\nBegriffe, characterized by increasing complexity and intellec-\ntual content.\nGef\u00fchl and Affekt\nDifferent disciplines also use the term Affekt in different ways.\nleges Affekt(e) over Gef\u00fchl in contrast to the psycho-medical\nliterature. Contemporary German historians of emotion also\nprivilege the term Affekt, as do some Anglophone psychologists\nof \"affect\" instead of emotion. However, the term Affect too was\nused in contradictory ways in the psychological literature of the\n19th century. (After 1900 the German spelling was Affekt). For\ninstance, in Das menschliche Gef\u00fchlsleben, Nahlowsky (1862,\np. 214) argued that Gef\u00fchle originated in Affect, whereas Wundt\nin Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Menschen- und Thierseele (1863)\nargued that Affect originated in Gef\u00fchl, emotion. In Wundt's\ndefinition, Affect was the more complex configuration, a com-\npound of emotion (feeling), thought content, motivation, and\ntendency to act, in contrast to simple \"sensory emotion\" or\nsense feelings, sinnliche Gef\u00fchle. Finally, Carl Georg Lange\n(1887), in his monograph \u00dcber Gem\u00fcthsbewegungen, used\nAffect for simple emotion, such as a startle, and at other times\nalso for (what Wundt called) complex higher order emotions,\nsuch as anger and happiness. In Lange's account, startle, anger,\nand happiness, Schreck, Wuth, Freude were \"einfache Affecte\"\nsimple emotions. He argued that these einfache Affecte should\nbe analytically separated from the more complex emotional\nconditions \"complexe Gem\u00fcthszust\u00e4nde,\" such as envy, love,\nand admiration, Neid, Liebe, Bewunderung. The former should\nbe called Affect or Gem\u00fcthsbewegungen, the latter Gef\u00fchle.\nHere, Gef\u00fchle would correspond to sentiment. However, this\nclassification was not followed in psychology. When Wundt\n(1887) commented on the different usages of the term Affect in\nthe psychological literature in his discussion of the James\u00ad\nLange theory of emotion he held: \"What is usually taken to be\nthe relation between Gef\u00fchl and Affect is turned upside down [in\nLange's work]. The Affect is defined as the simple process,\nGef\u00fchl as the complex process composed out of several\nIn the fifth edition of Grundz\u00fcge der Physiologischen\nPsychologie (1902), Wundt and Wirth grouped the various con-\nceptions of Gef\u00fchl/emotion that were discussed at his time into\nfour main hypotheses: (a) the intellectualist hypothesis, accord-\ning to which Gef\u00fchl was a particular activity of cognizance, eine\nbesondere Beth\u00e4tigung der Erkenntnis; (b) the interactionist\nhypothesis, which causally attributed Gef\u00fchl to an interaction of\nideas, Wechselwirkung der Vorstellungen; (c) the cognitive\nhypothesis, which suggested that Gef\u00fchl was subjective\nErg\u00e4nzung, the subjective supplement (or complement) to\nobjective sensations and ideas; and (d) the sensualist hypothe-\nsis, according to which Gef\u00fchle, emotions, were the physical\nside effect of sensation or sensory excitation, physische\nNebenwirkung der Empfindungsreize. Wundt proposed a sys-\ntematic distinction, which defined Gef\u00fchl clearly from a con-\nceptual point of view based on the neuroanatomical knowledge\nof his time. In his classification the distinction between Gef\u00fchl,\nEmpfindung, and Affekt, which were conceptualized as pro-\ncesses rather than states, concerned the intellectual content, the\ntime pattern of the process (Gef\u00fchlsverlauf), the motivational\ncomponent, the object of reference, and the tendency to act that\nmight or might not be implied.\nThe distinction between Emfindung and Gef\u00fchl was central\nto the German argument. The translation of the German terms\ninto English abolishes the distinction.2 In 1900, the German\u00ad\nEnglish dictionary Encyklop\u00e4disches W\u00f6rterbuch translated the\nterm Empfindung to English as \"sentiment\" and \"sensibility,\"\nboth of which carry an intellectual and abstract connotation.\nHowever, Wundt used Empfindung to mean sensation, not senti-\nment. Sentiment was signified by Gef\u00fchl. Wundt reserved\nEmpfindung for those changes in our momentary state (feeling,\nperception) for which a causal agent could be clearly situated\noutside the body, or changes in our state like hunger, when we\nWassmann Forgotten Origins, Occluded Meanings 167\ntalk about it in an abstract way, in contrast to feeling it. The\nFrench literature used sensation as a translation for Empfindung,\nsentiment for Gef\u00fchl, and \u00e9motion for Gem\u00fcthsbewegung; it\nalso used \"vie affective\" in the sense of Gem\u00fcth (Wundt, 1891,\np. 357). The English literature used the terms sensation, feeling,\nand emotion, and also \"affective process\" and \"affective state\"\n(in the meaning of Stimmung, mood) in partly synonymous\nways; it also used the term \"idea.\" The French terms sentiment,\nemotion, and id\u00e9e and the English sentiment, emotion, and idea\nare homonyms, which gave rise to many misunderstandings\nbecause of their variable usage.\nFrench Emotion Terms\nThe French terms are important for understanding the meaning\nof the German scientific texts. The connotation of \u00e9motion and\nemotion, as it was first used in French by Montaigne (1533\u00ad\npsychophysiologists--which is not surprising, because Wundt\nread Hume and Descartes. In Les Passions de l'\u00e2me, 1649,\nDescartes used the term \u00e9motion to describe the connection\nbetween mind (soul) and body that he thought was effected\nthrough the movement of corporeal \"animal spirits\" in the\nnerves, which he thought were hollow, informing the soul situ-\nated in the pineal gland about the state of the body. French psy-\nchologists in the 19th century recommended Descartes' work to\npsychologists studying emotion and attributed the term \u00e9motion\nto Descartes. Dumas (1948) wrote that at first Descartes called\nall emotional phenomena \"passions,\" both \"what is called today\npassions, such as love, hate, ambition, desire, and also the emo-\ntions like surprise, happiness, fear\" (pp. 27\u00ad28). Later Descartes\nheld that it was better to call all of them not passions de l'\u00e2me\nbut \u00e9motions de l'\u00e2me, \"emotions of the soul,\" because of all of\nthe thoughts the soul could have, these moved the soul most\nstrongly. The International English and French Dictionary\nvere) \u00e9motion.\"\nHume spoke of \"impressions or emotions\" and he used the\nterm \"affections.\" In An Enquiry Concerning Human\nUnderstanding, Hume (1817) wrote that the \"second property\"\nwhich he observed in the human mind\n[I]s a like association of impressions or emotions. All resembling\nimpressions are connected together; and no sooner one arises, than the rest\nnaturally follow. Grief and disappointment give rise to anger, anger to\nenvy, envy to malice, and malice to grief again. In a like manner, our\ntemper, when elevated with joy, naturally throes itself into love, generosity,\ncourage, pride, and other resembling affections. (Vol. 2, p. 177)\nIn the French translation of Hume's (1748) work, \u00e9motion is\nused, in English emotion (p. 16). At that time \u00e9motion and emo-\ntion were used synonymously. Hume like Montaigne used the\nterm \u00e9motion to signify diffuse feelings that we do not have a\nproper name for and that we cannot precisely localize.\nA look at historical French dictionary entries for \u00e9motion and\nsentiment provides an approximation of the problems that the\nGerman psychophysiologists and the French, who followed\nsuit, tried to understand in the 19th century. I have assessed the\nFrench dictionaries through theARTLF project of the University\nof Chicago (http://portail.atilf.fr) which can be considered rep-\nresentative for my purpose. The dictionaries that I consulted are\nmostly those by the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, who claims normative\nstatus in terms of defining the French language. I have consulted\nillustrative purposes in a qualitative manner. The description of\n\u00e9motion and sentiment in French did not change significantly in\nthese dictionaries, even when some of the concurrent political\nevents of the times left an imprint. The entries on \u00e9motion were\nshort, those on sentiment considerably longer. Judging from the\nlength of the entries, the term sentiment was more frequently\nused than \u00e9motion. This shows also in a qualitative way in the\nGoogle Books Ngram Viewer (available online). In what fol-\nlows, I give a representative example taken from the fourth edi-\ntion of the Dictionnaire de L'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise (1762). The\nentry showed that \u00e9motion was thought to act on three levels,\nthe humors, the spirits, and the soul.\n\u00c9MOTION. s.f.

In particular, it mentioned\n\"The speech angered him, one saw the emotion on his face.\"\nAnd, \"He didn't show the least emotion. He waited for the shot\nwithout emotion.\" Emotion could show on the face and in the\npulse. It was associated with a state of fever and with having\nwalked too much.3 The addendum stated that the term was also\nused to designate a tendency in the people to rise up. Among the\nvarious meanings given for \u00e9motion in French dictionaries, his-\ntorians have been most interested in the notion of \u00e9meute, mob\naction (Frevert, 2011, p. 18). However, the other meanings of\n\u00e9motion and sentiment were much more pertinent to the scien-\ntific agenda of 19th-century psychologists, who attempted to\nunderstand the fundamental principles of brain function and\nphysiology.\nThe entry shifted slightly over time. It retained that \u00e9motion\ncould show on the face in reaction to alarming or annoying news\nuntil 1932, when the face was no longer specifically mentioned.\nThe French Revolution left a temporary trace with \"the feelings\nof the heart,\" specifically mentioning hatred and anger, and the\nnote that an orator raised high emotions in the spirits of his audi-\ndifferentiations were introduced instead; \u00e9motion could be\nlively, strong, and light. Sweet and tender \u00e9motions were men-\ntioned. Hundred years later, in 1932, the entry was considerably\nshorter. It retained the qualitative distinctions of \u00e9motion, the\nidea that \u00e9motion was expressed in speech, in the tone of voice,\nand mentioned the unflinching reaction to bad news, \"He didn't\nfeel [ressentit] the least emotion at hearing this news\" (Author\nFrench Dictionary Entries for \"Sentiment\"\nThe term \u00e9motion appealed to French psychophysiologists as a\nscientific term, because \u00e9motion was easier to disambiguate\nthan sentiment (Dumas, 1895). A parallel reading of the entries\nfor \u00e9motion and sentiment elucidates the epistemological stakes\nin the psychophysiological debate. The International English\nand French Dictionary (Smith & Hamilton, 1880) translated the\nEnglish sentiment to opinion, thought, and also sensibility,\n\"sentiment; opinion, avis.\" The entry sentiment in Dictionnaire\nde l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise (1762) was comprehensive but I can-\nnot paraphrase it here for lack of space. The description of senti-\nment in the Dictionaire critique de la langue fran\u00e7aise (Feraud,\nfeeling, and understanding that was still at stake in 19th-century\ndebates on the nature of Gef\u00fchl, emotion. Sentiment:\n1\u00b0. Sensation, Perception (Synon.) Ces mots d\u00e9signent l'impression, que\nles objets font sur l'\u00e2me; mais le sentiment va au coeur, la sensation\ns'arr\u00eate aux sens, et la perception s'adresse \u00e0 l'esprit. (F\u00e9raud, 1994, p.\nSentiment, like sensation and perception, designated \"impres-\nsions that objects make on the soul,\" but sentiment \"goes to the\nheart, sensation stops at the senses, and perception addresses the\nmind.\" The entry gave sensation and perception as synonyms\nfor \"sentiment.\" The Dictionaire critique de la langue fran\u00e7aise\nspecified that (fr) sentiment was \"more certain\" than (fr) opin-\nion, whereas thought (pens\u00e9e) belonged to (fr) conjecture,\nassumption, and was less fixed and less ascertained. Riskin\n(2002) argued that in the 18th century, French scientists fused\nsensation and sentiment. In the 19th century, medical physio-\nlogical and psychological research worked to establish the neu-\nroanatomical and conceptual distinctions between emotion,\nsensation, and perception, Gef\u00fchl, Empfindung, and\nWahrnehmung. The German psychophysiological literature dis-\ncussed judgment as an essential feature of Gef\u00fchl.\nTranslations of German Gef\u00fchl to emotion in James's work,\nas well as the English to French and French to English transla-\ntions of the terms \u00e9motion and emotion, and of sentiment\naffected how emotion was conceived in the psychological litera-\nture at the turn of the 20th century. This can be seen particularly\nwell in the works of the French psychophysiologists Dumas\nWundt's work. When Dumas (1895) translated Lange's work\nand James's article \"What Is an Emotion\" to French he used the\nterm \u00e9motion, \"Introduction \u00e0 Lange, Les \u00e9motions. \u00c9tude psy-\nchophysiologique,\" and La th\u00e9orie de l'\u00e9motion (James &\ndes sentiments, it was translated as The Psychology of the\nEmotions (1897). However, Ribot deliberately used sentiment\ninstead of \u00e9motion, which had been widely used during the\n1890s in the debate about the nature of emotion that revolved\naround the James\u00adLange theory of emotion, in order to make a\ndistinction between the more basic notion of \u00e9motion, and the\nmore complex and intellectual sense of sentiment. In Germany,\nRibot's (1903) work was published as Psychologie der Gef\u00fchle.\nConclusion\nThe contemporary discussion on the concept of emotion lets\npsychologists engage in a debate de lana caprina rixari when\nproposing to replace \"emotion\" by \"affect\" or rather use \"feel-\ning.\" The problem cannot be solved by \"simply using terms like\nemotion, sentiment, or feeling, in their general senses\" as Dixon\nsuggested (T. Dixon, personal communication, June 6, 2013);\nnor by substituting \"feeling\" for emotion, as Damasio (2001)\nrecommended, or \"affect\" for emotion as Feldman Barrett and\nBliss-Moreau (2009) proposed. I am not arguing that the English\nuse of emotion terms is poor. Rather, I try to point out that the\nword emotion has a very definite connotation in English, which\nis used in a self-evident manner by Anglophone scholars in psy-\nchology and other fields, and which does not correspond to the\nsignification or meanings of the German term Gef\u00fchl, but which\nwas nonetheless used to translate the term Gef\u00fchl and to discuss\nabout the German scientific texts in English at the turn of the\n20th century, most notably by William James and his American\ndisciples.\nEvidence for the convergence of languages in the scientific\nconcept of emotion is also given by the fact that Wundt's works\nwere not translated to English but were nonetheless read by the\nFrench psychophysiologists and by the British scientists, who\nworked out fundamental principles of brain function such as\nagendas on emotion until the mid-20th century (Dumas, 1948).\nThe authors who worked on the scientific conception of emo-\ntion, for instance, Mosso (1896, English translation [La Paura,\n1884]), Wundt, Lange, Guiseppe Sergi, A. Wright, Lehmann,\nBinet, Dumas, Ribot, Charles F\u00e9r\u00e9, Fran\u00e7ois-Franck to name a\nfew, were influenced by Kant's philosophy and the neuroana-\ntomical and physiological research that revised Bichat's con-\nception of the nervous system over the course of the 19th\ncentury. They referred to many authors, but not to the Scottish\nmoral philosopher Thomas Brown, whom Dixon (2012) desig-\nnated as the \"inventor of the emotions\" (p. 340).\nDixon held that the intellectual historian's diagnosis pro-\nvides the key to the definitional problem of emotion in contem-\nporary psychology. Brown defined emotions as being\nindefinable. \"Two hundred years later, we are still living with\nthis legacy of Thomas Brown's concept of `emotion'\" (Dixon,\ndistinction between troubling desires and passions\" and \"milder\naffections and sentiments\" is at the heart of the matter (p. 109).\nWhile Dixon showed that Brown was important for the spread\nof the term emotion in English, it is less sure that the historical\nWassmann Forgotten Origins, Occluded Meanings 169\ndiagnosis can solve the \"definitional malaise\" for psychology.\nThe distinction between troubling passions and mild sentiments\ndoes not go to the heart of scientific psychology's agenda at the\ntime when the \"concept of emotion\" was forged.\nAs I attempted to show, the interdisciplinary field of emotion\nstudies leaves out an entire body of texts that were not written in\nEnglish but nonetheless formative in the creation of the scien-\ntific concept of emotion. The complexity of the epistemological\ndiscussion of Gef\u00fchl in 19th-century psychology is occluded by\nthe focus on the English language. As we could see, the English\nterm emotion has a more narrowly defined meaning than the\nGerman Gef\u00fchl, even though the terms were taken as equivalent\nin translation. The topic of emotion, Gef\u00fchl, \u00e9motion was\ndebated internationally, and was fundamentally informed by\nGerman scientific psychology. The International English and\nFrench Dictionary (Smith & Hamilton, 1880) gave the German\nf\u00fchlen in brackets for the French translation (sentir) of the\nEnglish term feel. The items listed in the entry, such as feelings\nof warm and cold, hunger and thirst, pleasure and pain, were the\nentities that physiological psychologists discussed when they\ndebated Gef\u00fchl in the scientific literature. The questions raised\nranged from sensation, touch, and perception, to feeling well,\nand to questions concerning apperception and conscious aware-\nness (Wahrnehmung, Apperzeption and Bewusstsein in the\nGerman psychophysiological literature). Wundt addressed these\nquestions beginning in Vorlesungen (1863), when he asked\n\"Was ist das Gef\u00fchl?\" James took this up in 1884, when asking\n\"What is an emotion?\" The German texts also discussed the\nfeeling of self, the sense of self, and the distinction made by the\nbrain between \"I\" and the environment during infant develop-\nment. Furthermore, motivation, desire, and volition were\nincluded in the reflections about Gef\u00fchl; as was the relation\nbetween simple sense feelings (sinnliche Gef\u00fchle), more com-\nplex emotional composites (Gef\u00fchle or Affekte), and highly\nabstract intellectual emotions or sentiments (Wundt, 1874,\n\"basic emotions\" that are commonly associated with the term\nemotion in English today, referring to the classifications based\non facial expressions provided by Darwin (1872) and Ekman\n(Ekman & Friesen, 1975). While the English term emotion and\nthe French term \u00e9motion were used synonymously until the turn\nof the 20th century, these terms have become homonyms in the\ncontemporary literature.\nConcepts come into existence in through and across lan-\nguages, the editors of the Dictionary of Untranslatables (Cassin,\nRendall, & Apter, 2014) hold. The English translation of the\nentry for German Gef\u00fchl, does not mention \"emotion\" as a\ntranslation for Gef\u00fchl (but only English: feeling, sensation, sen-\ntiment, opinion; and French: sentiment and sensation) and it\nglosses over the distinction made between Gef\u00fchl and\nEmpfindung in German, because the editors felt that this was no\nlonger a problem for philosophy. It was a central conceptual\nproblem for psychologists though. The Dictionary of\nUntranslatables (Cassin et al., 2014) ends for the German emo-\ntion terms in the 18th century. The entry Gef\u00fchl draws on dic-\ncovers thinkers such as Kant, Christian Wolff, and Johann\nNicolaus Tetens, but leaves invisible the continuation and trans-\nformation of their thought in the physiological psychology of\nthe 19th century. The scientific concept of emotion was created\nin the confluence of Latin, French, English, and German. It is\nnot properly understood, if taken solely as an English term.\nTranslation is not just a matter of the past. It remains monnaie\ncourant for the time being, even when it does not involve a\ntranslator (but maybe Google translate), it takes place in the\nmind and brain of the writer. Europeans are still raised in their\nnative languages and cultures, and linguists rightly point to the\nlimitations of English as a universal frame. The limitations\nshow in the renewed debate on terminology, whether to use feel-\nings, or emotion, or affect, and in the renewed attempt at con-\nceptualizing \"emotion\" in more integrated and complex ways in\npsychological research. Therefore, it is timely to raise aware-\nness for the German language texts and multilingual transfor-\nmations that have informed the contemporary scientific\nvocabulary of emotion(s) in psychology.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1 The German neurobiologist H\u00fcther (2010) used this order in his\nnumerous public lectures.\n2 The Dictionary of Untranslatables (Cassin et al., 2014) explicitly\nerased the distinction Gef\u00fchl/Empfindung, which was still present in\nthe French original (Cassin, 2004) and points right to the core of the\n3 Lehmann (1892) still used \"febril,\" feverish, to describe an anxious\nstate of mind.\nReferences\nAcad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise.
