The major implication of these studies is that higher rates of crime are the\nresult of detrimental social processes that are set in motion by a sudden increase in\nextraction development followed by a heavy reliance on revenue generated from natural\nresources. As yet, however, community-level findings that postulate a relationship\nbetween natural resource revenue and crime have not been replicated cross-nationally\n(except see Collier and Hoeffler, 2004). This observation raises the following question:\nis there a cross-national correlation between revenue that is generated by natural resource\nextraction and crime? To help answer this question we study one type of crime (that is,\nhomicide rates) and natural resource rents. Homicide is one of the most valid and reliable\ncross-national crime indicators (see Neapolitan, 1997), and natural resource rents (NRR)\nare often used in development studies as an indicator of the amount of revenue generated\nby natural resources (less the cost of extracting those resources) that comes from their\nsale in the international market (Collier and Hoeffler, 2005). As a result, we test the\nhypotheses that NRR (as a percentage of gross domestic product) and homicide rates are\npositively correlated between and within countries.1\nThe present study begins by exploring the theoretical justification for the NRR\u00ad\nhomicide hypotheses. Specifically, to derive our hypotheses we rely upon two sets of\nliterature. First, we explore community-level studies that document the relationship\nbetween extraction-related economic activity and crime. Second, we examine cross-\nnational level research by drawing upon the `the natural resource curse' lens that stipu-\nlates countries with high NRR face more development-related problems than countries\nwith low NRR. Within that natural resource curse literature we pay particular attention to\nthe idea that high NRR countries may potentially harm the economy and encourage civil\nviolence. We employ a multilevel growth model to test the correlation between NRR and\nupon our findings in the context of the environmental justice literature and the potential\nfor future research.\nExploring the potential effect of resource extraction on crime cross-nationally is\nimportant for two reasons. First, policy-makers across the globe regularly make deci-\nsions about the pace and extent of resource extraction to generate NRR. Information\nabout the potential homicide\u00adNRR association might be useful to policy-makers and\naffect the kinds of economic policies they select. Second, if a relationship between NRR\nand homicide exists, then criminal justice agencies faced with implementing enforce-\nment practices may consider how to use NRR information to better advocate for and\ndistribute resources to combat crime (Archbold, 2015).\nBackground\nExtractive activities consist of the removal of raw materials from nature (for example, coal,\noil, gas, timber and minerals). These extraction efforts are often promoted by companies\nand governments, and are designed to stimulate revenue for economic development pur-\nposes. Local and national governments that are dependent on high NRR may suffer adverse\nsocial and economic consequences. For instance, Adger (2000: 361) suggests that too\nmuch reliance on NRR increases vulnerability to external shocks such as the volatility of\nraw material commodity prices. Jacquet (2014: 8321) describes four general types of prob-\nlem that occur from an over-reliance on NRR: `(1) rapid industrialization and loss of gov-\nernance,(2)unevendistributionofcostsandbenefits,(3)conflict,and(4)social-psychological\nstress and disruption.' These potential adverse outcomes have led a variety of sociologists\nand development scholars to investigate the relationship between high NRR economies\n(Perdue and Pavela, 2012) and mineral mining (Pegg, 2006). Together these wellbeing\nstudies suggest that a variety of social problems, including homicide, are likely to occur\nwhen governments and policy-makers pursue high NRR to boost economic growth.\nCommunity studies\nCarrington, Hogg and McIntosh (2011: 353) propose that communities that rely on high\nlevels of NRR experience greater levels of violence. That is, extractive economies dis-\nrupt social life in such a way that crime is more likely to occur. As a result, NRR can\nthreaten community norms and values and therefore break informal ties and harm com-\njust a matter of elevated NRR promoting crimes such as homicide. It is also a matter of\nrapid social change that may occur in areas of high NRR. For instance, as Durkheim sug-\ngested in the 19th century with his concept of anomie, rapid social change disrupts com-\nmunity organization and attenuates social bonds, creating a sense of normlessness in the\ncommunity that often leads to increases in crime (Durkheim, 2014 [1902]; see also\nMessner, 1989, for an empirical application to homicide rates).\nThe idea of social disorganization is often used to describe the condition faced by\ncommunities that undergo a rapid transition to an NRR-based economy (Ruddell et al.,\n2014). The increase in urbanization, industrialization and immigration that occurs along\nwith rapid expansion of NRR may break social bonds and threaten conventional com-\nmunity beliefs and values. This disorganization can then lead to an increase in crime and\nmakes the connection between natural resource extraction and crime, drawing directly\non concepts used in the social disorganization literature, suggesting that the loss of close-\nknit social ties can result in a loss of institutions (church groups, neighbourhood associa-\ntions, etc.) that historically provide informal control over social problems including\ncrime, drug abuse and mental illness, instead requiring formal organizations such as the\npolice and court system to address these problems. Ruddell et al. (2014) propose that\nsocial disorganization may increase during a natural resource boom, and that is what\nleads to observed increases in crime. Anecdotal observations appear to confirm Ruddell\net al.'s (2014: 4) supposition, as reports by some law enforcement officials and residents\nof high extraction communities suggest that a `violent element'is attracted to the employ-\nment opportunities brought on by rapid resource extraction that promotes social\ndisorganization. As a result of these changes, communities that quickly become reliant\non NRR are sometimes called `energy boom towns'.\nEnergy boom towns may also face rapid population growth, industrialization and fly-\nin, fly-out (FIFO) patterns of predominately male workers (Ruddell et al., 2014). This\npattern of community development disrupts the normal patterns of life in the mostly rural\nareas where extraction takes place. The new residents and FIFO workers often cause\nproblems for long-time residents, such as unemployment, increases in social-psycholog-\nical stress and substance abuse (Jacquet, 2014). The transient nature of the workforce\nthat migrates into quickly developing NRR economies may even create stress for local\nservices because those employed in the industry often work shifts around the clock, dis-\nrupting families where increases in violent crimes such as domestic abuse have been\nAs noted, the rapid growth of extraction revenue may attract people seeking various\ntypes of work that `disrupt normal patterns of interaction' (Ruddell et al., 2014: 3). Not\nsurprisingly, changes in community values also affects the way that law enforcement\nresponds to crime, reducing community service functions and increasing law enforce-\nment functions. That is, police become more focused on catching and arresting criminals\nwhile reluctantly allowing minor disorder to flourish (Archbold, 2015).\nSeveral empirical studies draw upon the social disorganization thesis to test the rela-\ntionship between NRR and crime. As previously noted, these studies generally indicate\nthat high-NRR economies also tend to have elevated levels of crime (for example,\nArchbold et al., 2014; Ruddell et al., 2014). For instance, recent research by Price et al.\n(2014) uncovers a relationship between the number of gas extraction wells (which pre-\nsumably correlate to higher levels of NRR) and crime across local communities. The\nrelationship between NRR and crime at the community level of analysis has also been\nobserved within other developed countries such as Australia and Canada (Carrington\nA few studies propose that there is no correlation between NRR and crime (Wilkinson\net al., 1982). Ruddell et al. (2014), for instance, found that although increases in NRR\nactivity were followed by increases in index crime, high-NRR communities had similar\nindex crime rates to low-NRR communities. Thus, Ruddell et al.'s results indicate that,\nin the case of homicide rates, it is the change in NRR and not the absolute level of NRR\nthat matters. In addition, Hunter, Krannich and Smith (2002) point out that, although\ncommunities that pursue high levels of NRR as an economic strategy could eventually\nrecover from elevated levels of NRR-related crime, perceptions of crime would be most\nintense for those socially disadvantaged residents living in high-NRR communities.\nIn sum, previous community-level research highlights how elevated and increasing\nNRR can foster disorganization. In turn, disorganization weakens community social\nbonds and creates individual and community-level stress that produces the right condi-\ntions for crime, including violence and homicide.\nCross-national studies\nWhereas problems associated with natural resource extraction are largely studied at the\ncommunity level, the focus of this research is cross-national. As community scholars\nnote, however, the same social processes that disrupt and disorganize communities may\nalso be at work within and across countries. When studying extraction in communities,\nFreudenburg (1992: 307) proposed that `newly industrializing nations [may also suffer\nfrom natural resource addiction because] extractive activities are seen as having the\npotential to open up entire regions to economic development'.\nCross-national literature on the problems associated with NRR as a form of develop-\nment can be broadly broken down into those studies that focus on economic growth and\nthose that focus on civil unrest and violence. In 1990,Auty suggested that some countries\nexperience the `curse of natural resources'.2 Like community-level research, the natural\nresource curse hypothesis proposes that development problems are likely to arise in\neconomies that rely heavily on NRR.3 Shortly afterAuty developed this thesis, Sachs and\nWarner used empirical data to study the effects of the resource curse, noting specifically\nthat a `surprising [feature] of modern economic growth is that economies with abundant\nnatural resources grow less rapidly than natural-resource-scarce economies' (1995: 1).\nTheir research demonstrates that developing countries with high levels of natural\nresource exports (for example oil, minerals and agriculture), expressed as a percentage\nof gross domestic product (GDP) in 1970, tended to experience slower economic growth\nover the next decade (see also Sachs and Warner 1997, 1999). Importantly, Sachs and\nMauritius) out of 19 did not experience a decline in GDP during the 1970s. The primary\nreasons that Sachs and Warner (2001) give for this general undesirable relationship is\nthat countries rich in natural resources may be harming GDP by disrupting more tradi-\ntional manufacturing growth. In other words, increases in natural resource extraction\nmay quickly elevate wages and product prices within countries, making it harder for\nmanufacturing to compete with other exports in the global marketplace. Sachs and\nWarner (2001: 833) note that, `[w]hatever the cause [for lower GDP], it is clear that we\nhave not seen strong export-led growth in resource abundant economies'.\nThe implications of these economic problems have also led scholars to think about the\nrelationship between NRR and homicide. Specifically, comparative researchers believe\nthat NRR may produce a variety of social problems, including violence (Collier and\nHoeffler, 2002). This more recent strand of research is similar to what is being proposed\nby community-level scholars \u00ad that the resource curse may create conflict and violence\n2002). Violence related to natural resources that occurs globally has garnered significant\nattention in the press, especially when related to conflicts over resources such as oil and\nminerals. In the popular press these conflicts are sometimes framed to highlight the vio-\nlence behind their production and extraction (Eligon, 2011). For example, `blood dia-\nmonds' or `conflict timber' illustrate the social harm associated with the extraction of\ncertain forms of natural resources (Mullins and Rothe 2008; Orogun, 2004; Van Solinge\n2008). Lujala, Gleditsch and Gilmore (2005) also found `a diamonds curse', indicating\nthat, in the case of secondary diamonds, there was an increase in the likelihood of ethnic\nfighting.4 For example, murders and missing persons in Colombia are all too often asso-\nciated with the capture of productive lands for the purpose of extracting palm oil (Borras\nand Franco, 2010a, 2010b). As a result, conflict over land associated with valuable natu-\nral resources may quickly lead to elevated murder rates (Myers, 1997). Moreover, as\nDowney, Bonds and Clark (2010) suggest, there are many different forms of extraction\n(for example mining and timber) that may encourage violence and murder in some\ncountries.\nThere are some additional reasons that NRR may generate violence at a cross-national\nlevel. First, some researchers describe violence as a function of `looting rebels' (Mildner\net al., 2011). That is, in nation-states with weak governments, rebels can forcibly and\nviolently take NRR as a method of funding political conflict. Collier and Hoeffler (2002:\n625) conclude that NRR generate `low opportunity costs for rebellion and make civil war\nmore likely'. Moreover, NRR reliance may challenge weak governments because law\nenforcement is strained and cannot provide protection in areas that can potentially gener-\nate high amounts of resource revenue. Thus, as Ross (2003: 25) contends, `this opens the\ndoor for criminal gangs, warlords, and rogue military officers'.\nTo date, there is only one academic study that examines the association between NRR\nand homicide rates at the cross-national level (Collier and Hoeffler, 2004). Specifically,\nCollier and Hoeffler (2004) studied deliberate killings and civil war deaths as a function\nof NRR.5 Collier and Hoeffler (2004) hypothesize that civil war deaths and homicides\nare likely to share predictors (that is, independent variables). The researchers conduct a\ncross-sectional analysis that illustrates important differences between the dependent\nvariables. Specifically, they find that both ethnic dominance and NRR are positively cor-\nrelated with the risk of civil war and that neither variable is correlated with homicide.\nNevertheless, Collier and Hoeffler (2004) conclude that this finding requires further\nempirical investigation.\nIn sum, the literature on the impact of natural resource extraction and the resultant\nrents suggests the following two hypotheses, which we test in this article.\nHypothesis 1: Annual increases in a country's natural resource rents are associated with annual\nincreases in the country's homicide rents (that is, the within-country hypothesis).\nHypothesis 2: Countries with higher average natural resource rents will have higher homicide\nrates compared with countries with lower natural resource rents (that is, the between-country\nhypothesis).\nMethods\nWe examine the cross-national correlation between NRR and homicide rates using mul-\ntilevel models for change. This procedure models one dependent variable and multiple\nindependent variables (Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal, 2008; Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002).\nMultilevel change models are particularly appropriate for examining the relationship\nbetween NRR and homicide because they allow for the simultaneous estimations of\nyear-to-year changes within individual countries (level 1) as well as between countries\n(level 2). Thus, we can assess the important question of whether NRR appear to facilitate\nhomicide over time (within country), across space (between countries), or both. As per\nconvention, we control for year in all of the statistical models.\nWe gathered data on natural resource extraction and other competing explanations of\nresource data were available over time (listed in Appendix 1). All of the variables used in\nour regression models of homicide are described below, with descriptive statistics for the\noverall sample presented in Appendix 2 and the between- and within-country variances\nlisted in Appendix 3. We now turn to the description of the variables used in our\nmodels.\nDependent variable\nOur dependent variable is the homicide rate, measured as homicides per 100,000 per-\nsons. We focus our analysis on homicide rates because community and cross-national\nstudies suggest that violence may be related to NRR and because homicide data are\nwidely acknowledged to be the most valid and reliable cross-national indicator of vio-\nlence (Neapolitan, 1997). As a result, it is possible to examine the variability in the homi-\nThe total number of homicides per country, per year was extracted from the Global\ncompiles world homicide statistics over time. Data in this report are derived from crimi-\nnal justice or public health systems and are verified through validity checks (see United\nrecorded `unlawful deaths purposefully inflicted on a person by another person' (United\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2014: 109). Because the distribution of homicide\ndata is substantially non-normal across countries over time (skewness = 2.5, kurtosis =\n7.7), we take the natural log of the variable to produce a better-fitting regression line and\nmore normally distributed regression residuals. As noted in Figure 1, the distribution of\nthe transformed homicide rate variable is relatively normal \u00ad even if slightly bimodal\nThe natural log of homicide improves model fit substantially and reduced the stand-\nard error estimates at both level 1 and level 2, allowing for a better test of the natural\nresource curse\u00adhomicide hypothesis between and within countries.\nNatural resource extraction\nWe are interested in determining whether NRR is correlated with homicide rates between\nand/or within countries. Thus, we collected data on NRR for each country over time as a\nway to estimate the extent of extraction activity in a country as well as to measure how\nmuch a particular country relies on revenue generated from the sale of natural resources.\nNRR are one common measure of extraction relative to revenue. NRR data represent the\nsurplus value or economic profits as a percentage of GDP that results from the sale of\nnon-renewable natural resources (oil, gas, coal, minerals and timber). NRR, as a portion\nof GDP, are also often used as a measure of natural resource wealth in the natural resource\ncurse literature (Collier and Hoeffler, 2005).As previously noted, as NRR increase, hom-\nicide should also increase because this form of economic development harms social life\nand leads to disruption and disorganization in communities and countries. Moreover,\nhigh NRR may promote political conflict between some countries at the national level.\nThe NRR data are also highly skewed and peaked (skewness = 2.41, kurtosis = 4.36)\nbecause some countries rely heavily on NRR and others virtually not at all. As a result,\nwe take the natural log of NRR because it helps to correct for the non-linear relationships\nthat emerge between NRR and homicide (skewness = 0.71, kurtosis = 1.78). NRR data\nare available from the World Bank (http://data.worldbank.org; see also Hamilton and\nClemens, 1998, for further discussion of NRR).\nControl variables\nSeveral variables that might have an impact on the relationship between NRR and homi-\ncide must be controlled in the statistical analysis of NRR and homicides. Based on prior\nstudies, GDP is one major variable that needs to be controlled in the analysis of homicide\nrates. GDP per capita across countries over time is collected from the World Bank and\nmeasured in thousands of US dollars per person. It is the market value of production,\nservices and sales. The relationship between GDP and homicide is mixed in the litera-\nture, which finds positive, negative and no relationship between the variables (Pridemore\nand Trent, 2010). We also control for income inequality using the Gini index. The Gini\nindex is obtained from the World Bank dataset and is frequently used as a measure of\nincome inequality in social science research (http://data.worldbank.org). Gini is noted to\nbe positively correlated with homicide rates in cross-national studies (Barber, 2006;\nWe control for three additional economic variables that were also collected from the\nWorld Bank. First, we control for the percentage of unemployed in each country each\nyear since this variable has also been linked with homicide rates (Huang, 2001). That is,\nas unemployment increases across countries, so does homicide. Second, infant mortality\nis controlled when testing the relationship between NRR and homicide. Infant mortality\nmeasures the number of infants who die before the age of 1 per 1000 live births. Infant\nmortality is an indicator of poverty that should be positively associated with homicide\nrates between and within countries. Finally, foreign direct investment (FDI) is controlled\nand is an indicator of the direct investment of equity capital and the reinvestment of earn-\nings into the economy as a proportion of GDP. Direct investment is typically not exam-\nined in homicide studies, but could drive NRR that impact on homicide rates. As a result,\nwe examine the relationship between direct investments before NRR are included in the\nanalysis to see if it is a potential mechanism that helps specify the relationship between\nNRR and homicide.\nIn addition to economic controls, we include five population indicators, one indicator\nof governance and one regional indicator. The percentage of the population in each coun-\ntry residing in an urban area is obtained from the World Bank and controlled in the analy-\nsis because increased urbanization has been linked to elevated homicide rates in some\ncross-national studies (Fischer, 1975). It is also an indicator of social disorganization\nbecause it has been argued that increases in urbanization are related to increases in crime.\nPopulation, measured in billions of residents, is also controlled in the analysis and allows\nus to assess if more populated countries or countries that grow in population also experi-\nence higher homicide rates. To account for age structure and gender we include the per-\ncentage of the population aged 0\u00ad14 years, the percentage of the population aged 15\u00ad64\nyears and the percentage of the population that is female.6 Democracy is examined as a\ncontrol variable and is measured using the report Freedom in the World, produced by\nFreedom House (https://freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-world). The database\ndocuments each country's political freedom in a `freedom index' over time, using a rat-\ning that ranges from `1' (most free) to `7' (least free). We reverse-coded the democracy\nvariable so higher values represent countries that have higher political freedom. We also\ninclude a measure of corruption, the Corruption Perception Index (CPI; Transparency\nInternational, 2016). The CPI is measured on a scale ranging from 0 (highly corrupt) to\n10 (very clean). We reverse-coded CPI so higher values represent higher levels of cor-\nruption. Finally, the region of the world in which a country is located is included only in\nthe between effects portion of the analysis, divided into the seven categories available in\nthe World Bank data (Sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia Pacific, Europe Central Asia, Latin\nAmerica Caribbean, Middle East North and North Africa, North America and South\nAmerica). This variable is entered into the analysis as a dummy variable and the refer-\nence category is Sub-Saharan Africa (see Appendix 2).\nAnalysis\nTo test the hypothesis that there is a positive correlation between NRR and homicide\n1 presents multilevel growth model estimates that test the viability of the notion that\nNRR and homicide are related.As noted, level-1 variables allow us to estimate the values\nof each variable at a specific year, and the level-2 variables average the values of the\nwe estimate three multilevel growth models for homicide rates. The first model (Model\n1) examines the relationship between a five-year lag of NRR and homicide controlling\nTable 1. Multilevel growth model coefficients of cross-national homicide rate for all countries,\nLevel 1: Within country \nLevel 2: Between countries \nRegion (vs. Sub-Saharan Africa) \nNotes: *p < .05; **p < .01; ***p < .001 (two-tailed); standard errors are in parentheses.\nonly for region and year. We estimate the five-year lag of rents for theoretical and empiri-\ncal reasons. That is, we rely on the natural resource curse literature, which notes that the\nimpact of any resource curse is delayed rather than immediate (Ross, 2003). Also impor-\ntant, as noted below, is that the five-year lag produces the best-fitting model of NRR and\nhomicide. We return to the issue of lagging NRR below, however, suggesting that, if\nsocial disruption and disorganization intensify over time, the lag in NRR produces the\nstrongest correlation and is theoretically justified. Model 2 displays results for the impact\nof the control variables on homicide. Model 3 combines Model 1 and Model 2 variables\nto show the impact of NRR on homicide while controlling for typical variables used in\ncross-national analysis.\nMissing data\nAs noted earlier, cross-national homicide data are the most available and reliable cross-\nnational crime indicator. However, it still suffers from missing data, particularly when\nemploying longitudinal analysis (Neapolitan, 1997). In order to add validity to our find-\nings we examined the distribution of missing data in the dataset for patterns and then\nemployed several modelling strategies.\nThe frequency of missing cases for each variable is reported in Appendix 4. It is clear\nthat homicide rates have a substantial number of missing values (n = 915). This is poten-\ntially problematic, but it is the reality of modelling cross-national homicide rates longi-\ntudinally. Several independent variables (that is Gini, percent unemployed, democracy\nand corruption) also have a number of missing values. The Gini index has a very large\npercentage of missing values (72.48 percent), suggesting that perhaps it should be elimi-\nnated from the models. We did not include it in the level-1 portion of the models for this\nreason; however, because the level-2 models are averaged between effects, we were able\nto keep it in level 2. Recall, level-2 coefficients are the average effects of the variable\nover the time period under study, 2000\u00ad12. Since every country in the model had a least\none value of the Gini index during that time period, there are no missing values of Gini\nat level 2. We next employed the Stata 13.1 command \u00ad misstable pattern \u00ad to the data-\nset, which produces an analysis of all the different permutations of missing values. The\nthree most common patterns of missing data in the dataset are, (1) values of all variables\nexcept missing Gini (n = 504), (2) values of all variables except missing Gini and homi-\ncide (n = 388) and (3) values of all variables except missing Gini, homicide and corrup-\ntion (n = 117). All other permutations of missing data patterns had fewer than 100 cases.\nAs noted, missing Gini values do not affect the results because it is not included in\nlevel-1 results, and missing homicide values are a common limitation to cross-national\nhomicide studies (Neapolitan, 1997). However, the majority of existing cross-national\nstudies are cross-sectional; in our longitudinal study the missing values have less of an\nimpact on the results because we are modelling change. For example, if a country is\nmissing a value for the corruption indicator for 2001, the multilevel change model will\nignore the missing value and model the corruption change for that country between 2000\nand 2002. Additionally, there are not missing values at level 2 for any of the variables\nTo further validate our results we modelled the data in three ways. First, we used\nlistwise deletion and removed any country from the analysis that had a missing value on\nany variable. We next restricted the results to cases that had no missing values of NRR.\nFinally, we used the mi suite of commands in Stata to impute all missing values of all the\nindependent variables in the analysis. The findings for the NRR variable were very simi-\nlar in each method of analysis, resulting in the coefficients having the same level of sta-\ntistical significance in each approach. We report the models from the first approach\n(listwise deletion) here.\nResults\nModel 1 (Table 1) suggests that NRR are related to homicide, but only within countries\n(level 1) and not between them (level 2). That is, within countries the correlation between\nthe natural log of NRR and the natural log of the homicide rate is .076 (p < .001; two-\ntailed). More specifically, a one unit annual change in the log of NRR is associated with\na .076 unit annual change in the log of the homicide rate. As a result, Model 1 (level 1)\nsuggests that, when examining the bivariate association between NRR and homicide\nrates, the two variables are positively correlated within (and not between) countries.\nModel 2 \u00ad the control variable model \u00ad finds that several predictors are significantly\nrelated to NRR. Increases in the percentage of the population residing in urban areas are\nassociated with increases in homicide rates (level 1). Governments that become more\ncorrupt within countries experience associated increases in homicide rates (level 1).\nIncreases in the percentage of the population aged 15\u00ad64 years are associated with\nincreases in homicide rates (level 1). Income inequality is also positively correlated with\nhomicide rates across countries (level 2) and implies that countries with high levels of\nincome inequality also tend to have higher homicide rates. Percentage unemployed, per-\ncentage 0\u00ad14 years and percentage female are all positively correlated with homicide\nrates between countries (level 2). Interestingly, GDP per capita is not significantly related\nto homicide rates either within or between countries. This is not surprising because\ncross-national studies of homicide have found negative, positive and no significant rela-\ntionship between GDP per capita and homicide rates (Pridemore and Trent, 2010), indi-\ncating that this relationship is empirically unclear.\nLevel-2 (Model 2) results for infant mortality and percentage urban are unusual.\nInfant mortality, an indicator of poverty, is negatively related to homicide rates in Model\n2 (level 2), a strange finding given that poverty should be related to homicide rates across\ncountries (Pridemore, 2008). Model 2 also suggests an odd finding for percentage urban.\nSpecifically, countries with higher percentages of population residing in urban areas\nhave lower homicide rates compared with countries with smaller urban populations. The\nremaining control variables (FDI, democracy and region) do not appear to be correlated\nwith homicide rates.\nImportantly, Model 3 (Table 1) provides support for the position that NRR continue\nto be correlated with homicide even after controlling for important factors that may influ-\nence homicide rates across countries. That is, according to Model 3 (level 1) a one unit\nannual change in the log of NRR is associated with a 0.040 unit annual change in the log\nof the homicide rate. The addition of NRR to Model 2 also helps explain the odd findings\nfor infant mortality and percentage urban (both at level 2). Specifically, infant mortality\nand percentage urban become statistically insignificant in Model 3 (level 2) when NRR\nare included in the model, suggesting the relationship in Model 2 may have been a result\nof model misspecification. In the case of infant mortality, this finding perhaps implies\nthat NRR may influence both poverty and homicide \u00ad a result that is consistent with the\nnatural resource curse literature. That is, the changes in the type of development matter\nwhen it comes to homicide rates. Importantly, then, it appears that, within countries when\nrelevant predictors of homicide are included in the model, only the type of economic\ndevelopment (natural resource rents) is related to homicide rates at level 1.\nThe results for NRR at level 2 (Model 3) are also important. The correlation between\nNRR and homicide remains non-existent at level 2 (Model 3), signifying that it is the\nchange in NRR as opposed to the level of NRR that matters. It is interesting to note that\nthese results are similar to the Ruddell et al.'s (2014) community-level findings that there\nare no differences between local communities that engage in natural resource extraction\nand those that do not, but those communities that do engage in extraction observe\nincreases in crime over time. Thus, local findings appear to be supported at the cross-\nnational level in Table 1.\nThe relationship between NRR and homicide requires some additional attention. That\nis, if NRR and homicide are correlated, how does that correlation emerge over time? As\npreviously noted, we lagged NRR to examine the relationship between NRR and homi-\ncide. Figure 2 examines that lag in more detail \u00ad seeking to identify potential patterns in\nthe relationship between NRR and homicide. An identified pattern in this relationship is\nFigure 2. Relationship between natural resource rents (lagged by 0 to 11 years) and homicide\nrates.\nimportant because it indicates whether countries may simply live with an increasing\nhomicide rate over the short term. That is, if the relationship between NRR and homicide\nbecomes weak over time, that might suggest that countries that adopt natural resource\nrelated development as a form of economic development simply need to `wait it out'.\nSince higher-extraction countries do not appear to have higher homicide rates, as indi-\ncated in Table 1, the within-country potential impact of increases in homicide rates may\nbe short lived. Next, we investigate whether NRR is likely to have a delayed impact, by\nexamining the correlation between its lag and homicide rates. The lagged analysis helps\nto determine if the potential impact of NRR on homicide is short lived (assuming such a\nrelationship does indeed exist, as Table 1 suggests).\nFigure 2 charts the level-1 coefficients for each lag of NRR on homicide in a multi-\nlevel model that controls for region, income inequality and the Gini index. The figure\nshows that the relationship between homicide rates and NRR is complex in that it\nemerges gradually over time. For example, at level 1 the relationship between that log of\nNRR and homicide \u00ad controlling for GDP, Gini and region \u00ad is not statistically signifi-\ncant until NRR is lagged by three years (coefficient = .04; p < .05). However, the associa-\ntion gradually increases so that by year 10 the association between NRR and homicide is\n.08 (p < .05). Thus, although it appears that having high levels of NRR is not a problem,\ncountries that increase their reliance on NRR appear to create a significant problem over\nthe long run with respect to increasing homicide rates. That is, it appears that the impact\nof increases in NRR matter for homicide rates in the future.\nConclusion\nCommunity- and country-level studies suggest that an overreliance on NRR may pro-\nduce crime and violence. As an extension of this position we argued that a reliance on\nNRR may disrupt and disorganize social life and lead to higher levels of homicide. We\ntested the NRR\u00adhomicide hypothesis at the country level for the years 2000 to 2012 by\nexamining the correlation between NRR and homicide rates. Our multilevel findings\nsuggest that there is a correlation between NRR and homicide rates, but that correlation\nexists only with respect to changing reliance on NRR within countries. That is, the rela-\ntionship between NRR and homicide does not appear between countries and high-\nextraction countries do not, on average, tend to have higher homicide rates. As a result,\nthe NRR\u00adhomicide hypothesis suggests that within-country trends in NRR and homi-\ncide are positively correlated over time, whereas the between-country NRR\u00adhomicide\nhypothesis was rejected. This is an interesting finding because it suggests that rapid\nincreases in NRR increase homicide, but that overall levels of NRR do not. To illustrate\nthese different patterns it is helpful to briefly examine two specific countries.\nNRR increased from 2.4 percent to 4.2 percent over the same time frame. Guatemala's\nNRR and homicide rates both almost doubled, demonstrating the within-group cross-\nnational finding at a national level; that is, rapid increases in NRR are associated with\nrapid increases in homicide rates. In contrast, in 2012, Saudi Arabia's NRR was 48.18\npercent, indicating that almost half of the entire country's GDP comes from NRR.\nHowever, in the same year, Saudi Arabia's homicide rate was 0.8, one of the lowest of\nall countries in the dataset. As we found by failing to reject the between-country hypoth-\neses, just because Saudi Arabia has a very high NRR value this does not mean that it\nwill also have a high homicide rate. The effect of NRR comes when there is a rapid\nchange in rents, not the overall value of the NRR.\nThe potential role of NRR in organizing homicide rates has implications for policy-\nmakers who might be contemplating a shift to heavy reliance on NRR for development.\nFirst, although it is often assumed that natural resource extraction is unsustainable and\nleads to economic harm and environmental destruction over the long run, we believe\nthere is an additional reason for caution. Specifically, although NRR may stimulate\nrevenue in the short run it can also lead to increases in social problems, such as homi-\ncide, over the long run. There is no evidence to suggest that countries with high extrac-\ntion rates have high homicide rates, but there is reason to suspect that social change\n\u00ad especially related to development \u00ad may contribute to changes in homicide. In some\nrespects our findings regarding NRR sum up the essential nature of developmental\nchange (that is, Durkheim, 2014 [1902]). That is, significant levels of social and eco-\nnomic change \u00ad and not the end result of that change \u00ad are what produce social prob-\nlems such as homicide.\nSecond, if there is a relationship between NRR and homicide, then social institutions\n(for example, law enforcement) are likely to require more state support in countries that\nbegin to shift their economies toward NRR-based economies (Archbold et al., 2014).\nHowever, extensively extractive economies are often viewed as overtly oppressive and\nmany have been accused of using direct and forcible control to facilitate extraction. This\nsituation is likely to raise human rights issues because state power may be directed\ntoward facilitating state violence to increase NRR rather than reducing social violence to\npromote development. Although we do not have the space in this article, future research\nshould examine whether development centred on NRR also promotes political violence,\nrather than the relatively non-political crime of homicide as it is measure in this study.\nNevertheless, it could certainly be argued that the developed countries using extracted\nresources should be paying the costs associated with combating the additional homicide\nthey create. This is even more important because countries that turn to NRR as a form of\ndevelopment are probably the least likely to adequately support state services that might\nserve to reduce violence. This particular situation could be viewed through an environ-\nmental justice lens, suggesting that environmental extraction produces harmful outcomes\nthat are most likely to be imposed on less developed countries. In the end we argue that\nthe role of natural resource extraction and the NRR\u00adhomicide hypothesis needs more\nserious consideration in cross-national studies of homicide because it may be counter-\nproductive to the development process. We hope our findings have generated more inter-\nest in such research and recommend two areas for potential future study.\nFirst, NRR are likely to vary by a country's location in the international economy\n(Wallerstein, 1974), and underdeveloped as well as some developing nations are more\nlikely to have economies linked to NRR than are developed nations. Scholars have\nargued that the majority of revenue generated from NRR does not help local economies;\nrather, because the extraction was funded by FDI, most of the profit leaves the local area\nand often the entire country (see Stiglitz, 2002: 67\u00ad73). This suggests that future research\nneeds to examine the effects of foreign capital on social disorganization and homicide.\nWe not only find that countries with higher NRR have slightly higher homicide rates\nin general, but also suggest that within highly extractive countries an association between\nNRR and homicide is most likely to exist over time. As a result, it is possible that the\neffect of NRR on crime may harm some nations and not others, and that further analysis\nof this issue is required. Unfortunately, data on homicide are least likely to be collected\nin countries that are underdeveloped and have high NRR. We are not the first researchers\nto face data problems with respect to missing data among poorer countries with respect\nto cross-national homicide rates. Thus, future studies might look to various indicators of\nviolence that better capture the impact of developmental change on homicide and vio-\nlence more generally in less economically developed countries.\nSecond, our study examines the impact of NRR on homicide over only a relatively\nshort period of time (13 years). That is, the true social impacts and cumulative nature of\nresource-based economies may not be realized for decades after the increases in NRR\noccur. Current limitations in cross-national homicide data (and control variables) do not\nallow for an expanded look at long-term cross-national homicide trends yet. However, as\ndata continue to become available this relationship should be monitored. Although there\nare considerable calls for alternative energy development and use across the globe, we\nanticipate that rates of extraction of coal, oil and gas will continue to increase for some\ntime because the demand for energy in the global economy has shown few signs of con-\ntracting in the near future.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nNotes\n1. We use the phrase `natural resource rents' (NRR) throughout the article to refer to the amount\nof revenue generated from the extraction and sale of natural resources. Other terms sometimes\nused for this in the literature include `natural resource wealth', `natural resource income' and\n`natural resource revenue'. We use the phrase `natural resource extraction' only when refer-\nring explicitly to the act of extraction.\n2. That term was later modified and is now known as `the natural resource curse' (see Frankel,\n3. Gelb (1988) also examined this idea through the study of oil-producing states. Specifically, he\nexamined how oil revenues in the 1970s helped and harmed developing oil exporters.\n4. Although there is considerable support for the relationship between natural resource wealth\nand violence, not all researchers find that relationship. For instance, Brunnschweiler and\nBulte (2009) discovered that natural resource riches do not increase violence for the 97 coun-\n5. Collier and Hoeffler (2004: 5) note that, for their variables, `there is little variation over time\n[and as a result] there is a loss of efficiency in examining within country differences'. As a\nresult, they relied on a cross-sectional analysis of homicide rates.\n6. Many cross-sectional studies of homicide rates include the percentage of males aged 15\u00ad24\nin their analyses to account for the fact that this is often seen as a group that commits a high\nlevel of crime. These data are not available for all of the countries in the analysis for all of the\nyears. Therefore we include the age structure and the percent female variables as proxies.\nReferences\nAdger WN (2000) Social and ecological resilience: Are they related?
