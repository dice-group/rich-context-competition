The degree of impair-\nment appears to be correlated with the severity of obesity such\nthat the largest individuals experience the lowest QOL (1,3\u00ad5).\nHowever, not all obese individuals experience a reduction in\nQOL and, consequently, examination of the conditions under\nwhich obesity can influence QOL is necessary.\nBinge-eating disorder (BED), an eating disorder prevalent\nin obese samples (6\u00ad8), may be one condition that influences\nthe relationship between obesity and QOL. The little research\nthat exists to date generally suggests that individuals with BED\nexperience more negative QOL outcomes and mental dys-\nfunction than noneating disordered obese individuals (9\u00ad12).\nHowever, other research has found few differences in QOL\nbetween individuals with BED and obese noneating disor-\ndered individuals (13). Given these equivocal findings, more\nresearch in this area is warranted because the ability of a BED\ndiagnosis to predict a broad range of variables that establish its\nvalidity (e.g., ability to discriminate from other disorders due\nto biological factors, QOL) and clinical utility (e.g., response to\ntreatment) will be critical to determining its nosological status\nEthnicity may be another factor that influences the relation-\nship between obesity and QOL. Rates of obesity are higher in\nethnic minority groups in the United States (14). In the eat-\ning disorder literature, a growing body of research documents\nconsiderable differences in weight-related attitudes, body size\nideals, and unhealthy weight control behaviors across diverse\nethnic groups (15\u00ad17). In addition, a small body of literature\nexists suggesting that minorities may have an optimistic view\nof health, even in the presence of significant risk factors that\nharm physical health or psychiatric disorders that decrease\nmental health functioning (18,19). For these reasons, ethnic-\nity may be an important factor that influences the relationship\nbetween BED, QOL, and obesity.\nA very small body of research has examined QOL in obese,\nethnically diverse groups in the United States and found inter-\nesting differences. Overall, research suggests that QOL is\nmore impaired for white women compared to ethnic minority\ngroups, with white women reporting significantly more overall\nimpairment than all other groups despite having a significantly\nlower BMI (4,5,20) and black males reporting significantly less\noverall impairment than all other groups despite having the\nhighest BMI (4). Additionally, physical functioning has been\nreported to be the greatest area of impairment across all ethnic\ngroups, with sexual functioning reported to be an area of sig-\nnificant impairment for black women (4).\nThe Relationship Between Quality of Life,\nBinge-Eating Disorder, and Obesity Status\nin an Ethnically Diverse Sample\nMarisol Perez1 and Cortney S. Warren2\nThis study examined the relationship between obesity status, binge-eating disorder (BED), and quality of life (QOL) in\na large, ethnically diverse community sample of adult men and women. Using data from the Collaborative Psychiatric\nEpidemiological Surveys (N = 20,013), individuals were categorized into four groups: nonobese with BED (n = 142),\nobese individuals with BED consistently reported the poorest QOL. Findings suggested that obesity status was more\nstrongly related to physical health-related QOL variables (e.g., number of physical conditions, mobility impairment)\nwhereas diagnostic status was more predictive of mental health and social functioning QOL variables (e.g., cognitive\nimpairment, social interaction impairment, time out of role). The degree to which lifetime BED diagnosis was\nassociated with impairment in social interaction differed across ethnic groups. For black individuals, the number of\nphysical health conditions was associated with BED presence moreso than weight status.\n1Department of Psychology, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA; 2Department of Psychology, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.\nCorrespondence: Marisol Perez (marisolperez@tamu.edu)\narticles\n \nTo expand on existing research, the overarching purpose of\nthis study was to examine the relationships between obesity\nstatus (i.e., obese or nonobese), diagnostic status (i.e., BED or\nnon-BED), and QOL in a large, ethnically diverse commu-\nnity sample of adult men and women. Specifically, we tested\ntwo intertwined issues: (i) whether obese and nonobese indi-\nviduals diagnosed with BED differ from obese and nonobese\nindividuals without BED on QOL, and (ii) whether the rela-\ntionship between obesity status, clinical diagnosis, and QOL\ndiffers across ethnic groups. Consistent with previous research,\nwe predicted that obese individuals would report significantly\nmore impairment on physical health-related aspects of QOL\nthan nonobese individuals and that individuals with BED\nwould report more impairment on mental health and sociali-\nzation related aspects of QOL than non-BED participants.\nAdditionally, we predicted that obese individuals with BED\nwould report the poorest QOL in both physical and men-\ntal health aspects of QOL. Consistent with a limited body of\nresearch, we also hypothesized some ethnic differences. First,\nwe expected that white individuals would report the most QOL\nimpairment and black individuals would report the least QOL\nimpairment, with Hispanics falling in the middle. Second, we\npredicted that although the relationship between obesity, BED,\nand QOL would be consistent across ethnic groups (i.e., as pre-\ndicted above), the degree of impairment would differ by ethnic\ngroup. For example, we expected obese individuals to report\nmore impairment on physical health than nonobese individu-\nals and for this to be consistent across ethnic groups. However,\nwe expected ethnic groups to differ on the degree of impair-\nment reported, with minorities reporting less QOL impair-\nment than white individuals.\nMethods and Procedures\nParticipants\nTogatheralargeenoughsampleofethnicminorityparticipants,datawere\ncompiled from the NIMH Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiological\nSurveys (CPES), which includes the National Comorbidity Survey\nReplication, the National Survey of American Life, and the National\nLatino and Asian American Study (15,18). The CPES is a nationally\nrepresentative dataset that assesses mental disorders in 20,013 men\nand women living in the United States. Given its representative nature,\nthe CPES includes a large sample of ethnic minority participants: Of\nthe sample, 38% of participants self-identified as Caucasian/European\nApproximately 57% of the sample is female.\nProcedure\nFor the original CPES studies, all individuals were interviewed using\na modified version of the World Health Organization's Composite\nInternational Diagnostic Interview (WHO-CIDI, ref. 21) to obtain\nDSM-IV diagnostic criteria information and arrive at disorder classi-\nfication. This information was used to determine BED diagnosis. The\nCPES study included 946 interviewers who were trained on cultural,\nracial, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic sensitivity; the eligibil-\nity and selection of households; and, the administration of the inter-\nview (22). Interviewers successfully completed a certification process in\nwhich they conducted mock interviews with trainers (23). The average\ninterview length ranged from 126 to 145min, with an overall response\nodology, study design, development, implementation, recruitment\nstrategies, etc., can be found in previous publications (25).\nMeasures\nAll participants that positively endorsed the screener item \"Ever have\na strong fear/concern about being too overweight,\" received the rest\nof the questions in the eating disorder module from the WHO-CIDI\ndiagnostic interview. Within the binge-eating module, participants\nwere asked if they engaged in binge eating consistent with the defi-\nnition in the DSM-IV TR (e.g., sense of loss of control over eating,\neating a large amount of food). Positive responses to both items were\nrequired for diagnosis. In addition, participants were asked if the binge\nepisodes were associated with any of the following and three positive\nendorsements were required for diagnosis: eating until uncomfort-\nably full, eating more rapidly, eating when not physically hungry, eat-\ning alone because embarrassed by amount of food eaten, and feeling\nguilty/depressed/disgusted after overeating. Binge eating had to cause\nmarked distress, could not occur during the course of another eating\ndisorder, and could not be associated with weight-related compen-\nsatory behaviors. Algorithms were created to assess BED classifica-\ntion consistent with DSM-IV TR including frequency and duration\ncriteria. All diagnostic criteria were assessed and represented in the\nmodule and algorithm. Lifetime diagnoses were ascertained using the\nindividual's retrospective report. Inter-rater  for the eating disorder\nfound in previous CPES publications (22\u00ad24) (For those interested in\nreplicating these analyses from this public dataset, please contact the\nauthors for the numerical identification code given to each variable\nwithin the dataset).\nAlthough using empirically supported measures of QOL is generally\npreferable, this was not possible while retaining a large sample of ethnic\nminorities (i.e., using the CPES dataset). Consequently, we examined\nareas of life impairment that are generally included in QOL measures\n(specific variable numbers and/or labels used from the dataset are avail-\nable upon request).\nPhysical health. Physical health-related aspects of QOL were assessed\nin two ways. First, a \"physical health rating\" item measured each par-\nticipant's self-perceived overall physical health rated on a 1\u00ad5 Likert-\ntype scale, with higher scores indicating better functioning. Second,\nto obtain a more objective assessment of physical health, a composite\nscore of the number of physical health conditions reported by each par-\nticipant was created by adding the number of conditions endorsed. A\ntotal of 13 physical conditions were examined including arthritis, ulcers,\ncancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, liver problems, kidney problems,\nstroke, asthma, lung disease, blood circulation problems, heart trouble,\nand osteoporosis.\nMental health. Mental health aspects of QOL were also assessed in two\nways. First, a \"mental health rating\" item measured self-perceived over-\nall mental functioning on a 1\u00ad5 Likert-type scale, with higher scores\nindicating better functioning. Second, a variable consisting of the num-\nber of lifetime Axis I psychiatric disorders (excluding eating pathology)\nwas created by adding the number of endorsed diagnoses from a total\nSocial support. Social support was measured using six items assess-\ning friend and family support. The items consisted of the frequency of\nphone communication with relatives and friends, the degree to which\none believes they can rely on relatives and friends when faced with a\nserious problem, and the degree to which one can openly discuss wor-\nries with relatives and friends. All items were measured on a Likert-\ntype scale and summed, with higher scores indicating poorer support.\nAdditionally, the World Health Organization Disability Assessment\nSchedule (WHO-DAS II) is a semistructured interview developed\nfor assessing functioning among patients with mental disorders and\nassessed six domains of functioning within the past 30 days: cogni-\ntive impairment, self-care, role impairment, social interaction, time\narticles\n \nout of role, and mobility. Cognitive impairment assesses an individ-\nual's ability to understand, communicate, concentrate, and learn new\ntasks. Self-care assesses an individual's ability to meet basic physical\nneeds (e.g., bathe, feed, ability to live alone at home for a few days).\nRole impairment assesses the total number of days the individual was\nunable to carry out work or normal daily activities, as well as reduc-\ntion in quality of work/activities. Social interaction assesses effec-\ntive social interaction, such as getting along with people you do not\nknow, maintaining friendships, and forming new friendships. Time\nout of role assesses an individual's ability to do everyday tasks, such\nas household responsibilities and chores. Finally, mobility assesses an\nindividual's ability to walk both in- and outdoors, stand for long peri-\nods of time and other similar activities. The WHO-DAS II has been\nextensively studied across 18 countries, including the United States,\nand has been found to have good construct and convergent valid-\nity, good internal consistency, and test\u00adretest reliability (27,28). The\nWHO-DAS II subscales are scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores\nindicating greater impairment.\nAnalytic procedure\nIn the original CPES dataset, participants were separated into six BMI\ngroups: underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese class I, obese\nclass II, and obese class III. To determine how to consolidate the groups,\na one-way ANOVA was performed with BMI groups as the predictor\non all of the dependent variables. No statistically significant differences\nemerged on any of the dependent variables in the under-, normal-, and\noverweight groups except for number of physical health conditions\n(the overweight group reported significantly more conditions than the\nnormal weight and underweight groups). However, all three groups\n(i.e., under-, normal-, and overweight) did differ significantly from\nthe obese groups on all of the dependent variables. Consequently, the\nunder-, normal-, and overweight groups were combined into one group\nlabeled the nonobese group (BMI <30) and the three obese groups were\ncombined into one group labeled the obese group (BMI 30).\nGiven that the main focus of this study was to investigate whether\noverall QOL and general functioning differed by obesity status and\nBED diagnosis, the nonobese and obese groups were further divided\nby lifetime history of BED. In sum, four groups were created: nonobese\nThe lifetime prevalence rate of BED was 1% among nonobese individu-\nals and 2.6% among obese individuals. Among those that met criteria\nfor BED diagnosis within the past 12 months, 55% were in the obese\nwith lifetime BED diagnosis and the rest were in the nonobese with\nlifetime BED diagnosis; this difference was nonsignificant 2(1) = 2.69,\nP = 0.10. Table 1 displays the ethnic distribution across the four groups.\nApproximately 33.6% of black individuals were obese, compared to\n23.8% for whites and 27.4% for Hispanics. The prevalence of BED was\n2.3% among Hispanics, 1.5% among black individuals, and 1% among\nwhite participants. Among those that met criteria for BED diagnosis\nInterestingly, for black and Hispanic participants, comorbid mental\nhealth conditions were higher in BED groups (average of two comor-\nbid mental health conditions) than non-BED groups (average 0.5\u00ad0.7;\nP < 0.001). However, on self-perception of mental health, all groups\nrated their mental health between \"good\" and \"very good\" (on average).\nAmong the white group, the BED groups reported more mental health\nconditions (average 2.5) and poorer perception of mental health than\nFor the main analyses, hierarchical regression equations were com-\nputed; one equation per QOL measure. To control for socioeconomic-\nstatus, the income-to-needs ratio variable in the dataset was entered\nfirst as a covariate. In step 2, ethnicity (coded as white, black, or His-\npanic) and the variable BED by obesity status group (coded as non-\nobese without BED, nonobese with BED, obese without BED, obese\nwith BED) were simultaneously entered into the equation. In step 3,\nthe interaction term between ethnicity and BED by obesity status was\nentered. Dependent variables were overall physical health, number of\nphysical conditions, overall mental health, number of mental health\nconditions, social support, ability to self-care, cognitive impairment,\nimpairment in mobility, time out of role, role impairment, and social\ninteraction. Because both predictors (i.e., ethnicity and BED by obesity\nstatus group) were categorical variables, both variables were dummy\ncoded into the regression equations. The contrasts for ethnicity were\nwhites vs. blacks, whites vs. Hispanics, and blacks vs. Hispanics. The\ncontrasts for the BED by obesity status group compared each group to\nanother group (no groups were combined), consisting of six contrasts.\nTable 1The distribution of ethnicity by the BED and obesity status groups\nWhite Black Hispanic Total\n% within group\nBED, binge-eating disorder.\narticles\n \nThe interaction term dummy codes consisted of the multiplication of\nethnicity and BED by obesity status group. However, not all possible\ncombinations of contrasts were computed for the interaction term. The\nmain interests were comparing BED vs. without BED groups, and obese\nvs. nonobese groups, for each ethnic group (a total of six contrasts).\nTo reduce family wise error, significance level was set at 0.001 for all\nregression equations. Table 2 displays the results from the regression\nequations.\nResults\nThe relationship between obesity,\nlifetime BED diagnosis, and QOL\nThe first objective of this study was to explore the relationship\nbetween obesity status and lifetime BED diagnosis, and QOL.\nIt was hypothesized that obese individuals would report sig-\nnificantly more impairment on physical health-related aspects\nof QOL than nonobese individuals and that individuals with\nlifetime BED diagnosis would report more impairment on\nmental health and socialization related aspects of QOL than\nnon-BED participants. The BED by obesity status variable\nsignificantly predicted all QOL indices except for social sup-\nport (see Table 2). Table 3 displays the means, s.d., and sig-\nnificant post-hoc comparisons between the BED by obesity\nstatus groups. In general, the obese with lifetime BED diag-\nnosis group reported the most impairment for both physical\nand mental health. Both obese groups regardless of lifetime\nBED diagnosis reported more impairment in physical health,\nnumber of physical conditions, and mobility. Those that\nreported a lifetime BED diagnosis regardless of weight status,\nreported more impairment in overall mental health, number of\nmental conditions, cognitive impairment, time out of role, and\nsocial interaction. Although overall physical health and social\nsupport were significantly predicted by BED by obesity status,\nnone of the post-hoc comparisons were statistically significant.\nIn general, means were in the expected direction, regardless of\nsignificance and consistent with hypotheses.\nThe impact of ethnicity on the relationship\nbetween obesity, BED, and QOL\nSignificant ethnic differences on overall physical health,\nnumber of physical conditions, number of mental health condi-\ntions, mobility, time out of role, and role impairment emerged\n(see Table 2). Contrasts revealed that the black group reported\nthe most physical conditions (M = 0.85, s.d. = 1.35) and great-\nfollowed by the white group (conditions M = 0.16, s.d. = 0.73;\nreported the least impairment (conditions M = 0.06, s.d. = 0.43;\nmost mental health conditions (M = 0.80, s.d. = 1.37) and role\nimpairment (M = 6.05, s.d. = 1.37), followed by the Hispanic\nrole M = 4.07, s.d. = 1.10). The white group reported the best\nself-perception of physical health (M = 2.63, s.d. = 0.70) but\nthe most impairment in mobility (M = 5.71, s.d. = 1.62), fol-\nlowed by the black group (health M = 2.60, s.d. = 0.74; mobility\nM = 4.33, s.d. = 1.38), and the Hispanic group, who reported\nthe worst perception of physical health (M = 2.56, s.d. = 0.78)\nThe second objective of this study was to assess whether\nthe relationship between lifetime BED diagnosis and obesity\nstatus, and QOL differed across ethnic groups. The relation-\nship between BED by obesity status across ethnic group is\nreflected by the interaction term in Table 2.

As Figure 1 shows, contrasts revealed the\nblack group significantly and consistently reported more phys-\nical conditions than any other ethnic group. In addition, the\nblack groups with BED reported more physical conditions than\nthe groups without BED. In contrast, for Hispanics, the obese\ngroup with BED reported more physical conditions than the\nother groups. This suggests that number of physical conditions\nreported by black individuals was associated with presence\nof lifetime BED diagnosis, whereas the combination of being\nobese with BED was associated with the number of physical\nconditions reported by Hispanics. With regard to social inter-\naction, Figure 2 displays how the ethnic groups differed on\nreported impairment. For Hispanic and black individuals, the\npresence of BED was clearly associated with the level of impair-\nment reported whereas this was not true for white individuals\n(for whom the obese BED group reported the most impair-\nment). In addition, the Hispanics with BED reported the most\nimpairment of any group. There were also two nonsignificant\ntrends where ethnicity influenced the relationship between\nBED by obesity status on cognitive impairment (P < 0.004),\nand mobility (P < 0.007; results not displayed).

For mobility, lifetime diagnosis of BED was associated\nwith the level of impairment reported by black individuals,\nwhereas weight status influenced the level of impairment for\nall other ethnic groups.\nDiscussion\nThe objective of this study was to expand on existing research\nby examining the relationship between obesity status, BED\ndiagnosis, and QOL in a large, ethnically diverse community\nsample of adult men and women. Results revealed that obes-\nity status was more strongly associated with impairment in\nphysical health-related QOL, whereas lifetime BED diagno-\nsis was more strongly associated with impairment in mental\nhealth and social functioning related QOL. These findings\nhave important clinical significance. For example, a relatively\nlarge percentage of obese participants with BED noted severe\ntime out of role impairment (which indicates impairment\nin the ability to complete everyday tasks such as household\nchores): Approximately 23% of obese individuals with BED,\n14% of nonobese individuals with BED, 9% of obese individu-\nals without BED, and 6% of the nonobese individuals without\nBED reported severe impairment (score of 70 or greater). In\naddition, 2% of individuals in the obese with BED group, 1%\nin the nonobese with BED group, 0.2% in the obese without\nBED, and 0.2% in the nonobese without BED reported severe\nimpairment in their ability to care for themselves. Both obesity\nand lifetime BED diagnosis increased the likelihood of experi-\nencing impairment in QOL, with the presence of both leading\nto the worst impairment. When comparing the nonobese with\nlifetime BED diagnosis and obese without BED diagnosis, the\nnonobese with lifetime BED diagnosis reported more impair-\nment across more domains of functioning. It is important to\nnote that 52% of the sample with lifetime BED diagnosis had\nnot met criteria within the past year suggesting that QOL may\ncontinue to be impaired long after the disorder remits. These\nresults from this study also lend some support to the clinical\nutility of BED when assessing QOL.\nWith regard to ethnicity, although the patterns discussed\nabove were generally consistent across ethnic groups, some\ninteresting findings emerged. The black group reported the\nmost physical conditions and the Hispanic group reported\nthe most impairment in social interaction. With regards to\nnumber of physical conditions, diagnostic status was more\ninfluential than weight status for black individuals, whereas the\nreverse tended to be true for Hispanics and whites. However,\nit is important to note that the black group had a higher per-\ncentage of individuals meeting criteria for BED within the past\n12 months than the other racial groups which could be driv-\ning these two findings. Diagnostic status was more influential\nin impairment of social interaction for the minority groups,\nwhereas weight status was more influential in the white group.\nAside from these differences, there were more similarities than\ndifferences across ethnic groups.\nAnother interesting observation was a discrepancy between\nperception of mental health and actual mental health that\nemerged among the minority groups. For black and Hispanic\nparticipants, comorbid mental health conditions were higher\nin BED groups than non-BED groups. However, on self-per-\nception of mental health, all groups rated their mental health\nbetween \"good\" and \"very good\" (on average). Among the\nwhite group, the BED groups reported more mental health\nconditions and poorer perception of mental health than the\nnon-BED groups. This finding is consistent with a recent study\nwhere more than half of black participants and one-third of\nHispanic participants who described themselves as \"slightly\"\noverweight would be classified as obese based on BMI (19).\nFurthermore, despite their weight status, 72% of blacks and\n62% of Hispanics in the sample reported their overall health\nwas good to excellent. The authors concluded that despite\nthe greater self-reported prevalence of certain risk factors for\npoor health, blacks and Hispanics had a more optimistic view\nof their overall health and weight status than was objectively\nsupported. Additionally, in the clinical treatment literature,\nresearch suggests that ethnic minority individuals are less\nlikely to attribute mild and moderate emotional problems to\nmental health, and that the perception of poor mental health\nleads to treatment seeking (19) despite general underutiliza-\ntion of treatment by many ethnic minority groups (15,20,25).\nFuture research should continue to explore the influence of\nethnicity on the relationships between perception of mental\nhealth, severity of mental health symptoms, and treatment\nseeking among minorities.\nThere are several important limitations to this study that\nshould be considered when examining these data. In this\nstudy, QOL was assessed through items asked on different\ndomains of functioning and disability instead of through a\npsychometrically evaluated instrument or an obesity-specific\nmeasure of QOL, which would have enriched the data. Data\non BED and comorbid psychiatric diagnoses were gathered\nretrospectively, making the data subject to recall bias which\nmay limit the generalizability and comparison of this study\nto past research that investigated QOL among eating disor-\ndered and obese individuals. The structured clinical interview\nused to diagnose BED implements skip rules signifying that\nindividuals have to positively endorse screener items in order\nto receive the BED module. It is unknown if screener items\nare biased where ethnic minority individuals are less likely to\nendorse items indicating that the sample in this study would\nbe an under-representation of BED (29). Additionally, despite\nthe large representative sample of ethnic minority individuals\nin this dataset, relatively few minority individuals were diag-\nnosed with BED (e.g., 40 nonobese BED and 41 obese BED\nHispanics; 38 nonobese BED, and 55 obese BED black indi-\nviduals) which may have influenced statistical power and the\nrepresentativeness of the sample. Furthermore, although Asian\nparticipants were included in the main dataset, the sample had\ntoo few obese Asian individuals with BED to assess the perti-\nnent variables on this group separately. It is also important to\nnote this study is cross-sectional in nature; although analyses\narticles\n \nwere framed with BED diagnosis and obesity as predictors and\nQOL as the dependent variable, it is possible that QOL can also\nimpact obesity and psychiatric symptoms.\nDespite these limitations, results from this study suggest that\nweight status is associated with physical health and physical func-\ntioning. However, these data also suggest that BED can be associ-\nated with QOL above and beyond obese weight status in certain\ndomains of functioning, such as social interaction, and cognitive\nimpairment. Obese individuals with BED reported the poorest\nQOL across all domains. Consequently, treatment strategies for\nBED and obesity aimed at relief of distress and dysfunction due\nto both weight-status and eating pathology may improve QOL\namong obese individuals of diverse ethnic groups (30).\n"
