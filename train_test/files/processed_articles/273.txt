The incidents were followed by two separate lineups, one for the younger\nperpetrator and one for the older perpetrator. When the test delay was short (35 min), the young and older\nwitnesses performed similarly on the lineups, but when the tests were delayed by 1 week, the older witnesses were\nsubstantially less accurate. When the target was absent from the lineups, the older witnesses made more false\nalarm errors, particularly when the faces were young. When the target was present in the lineups, correct\nidentifications by both young and older witnesses were positively correlated with a measure of source recollection\nderived from a separate face-recognition task. Older witnesses scored poorly on this measure, suggesting that\nsource-recollection deficits are partially responsible for age-related differences in performance on the lineup task.\nONE striking and ecologically valid test of memory is\nprovided by performance on a lineup test following a\nwitnessed incident. An eyewitness's decision in the lineup task\nis likely to be influenced by several variables, including the\nconditions at the time of encoding, the characteristics of the test\nsituation, the personal characteristics of the witness, and\nthe characteristics of the event (for reviews, see Memon, Vrij,\nportant factor, however, and one with clear implications for\nmemory, is the age of the eyewitness (Memon & Bartlett, 2002;\nMemon, Hope, Bartlett, & Bull, 2002; Searcy, Bartlett, &\nIn one relevant study (Searcy et al., 1999), younger (18- to\n30-year-old) and older (60- to 80-year-old) witnesses viewed\na crime video, after which they were asked to identify the per-\npetrator in a photo-identification lineup. Consistent with predic-\ntions based on standard laboratory tests of face-recognition\nmemory (Bartlett & Fulton, 1991; Bartlett, Strater, & Fulton,\nfalse choices of a lineup ``foil'' than did younger participants.\nThe age-related increase in false identifications has been repli-\ncated in several subsequent studies, many of which have also\nreported an age-related reduction in the hit rate (Searcy,\nAlthough age-related deficits in lineup performance are now\nwell established, it is important to note that, in the studies cited,\nall the lineup faces were young. Hence, the young witnesses\nwere tested with ``same-age'' faces, whereas the older witnesses\nwere tested with ``other-age'' faces. This confound is important\nin light of the finding by Bartlett and Leslie (1986) that age-\nrelated differences in face-recognition memory were reduced\nwhen older faces were used: younger participants showed an\nadvantage with younger faces, whereas older adults showed no\neffect of age of face. The same asymmetric other-age effect has\nalso been reported by Rodin (1987) and by Fulton and Bartlett\nBartlett's study, however, the other-age effect was found with\n``hits'' (correct recognitions of previously viewed faces), but\nnot with false alarms (erroneous recognitions of foil faces).\nFalse alarms were more frequent among older participants,\nregardless of age of face.\nThe possibility that an other-age effect might occur in the\ncontext of eyewitness identification was examined by Wright\nand Stroud (2002), who found that young-adult and middle-\naged viewers of target-present lineups were more accurate with\nsame-age faces than with other-age faces (i.e., middle-aged\nfaces for young viewers and young-adult faces for middle-aged\nviewers). The other-age effect, however, was not found in\ntarget-absent lineups, which is in partial agreement with Fulton\nand Bartlett (1991). Wright and Stroud, however, did not\nreplicate the Fulton and Bartlett finding of higher false-alarm\nrates among older viewers. This may be because the older par-\nticipants in the Wright and Stroud study ranged from 35 to 55\nyears old, whereas those in the Fulton and Bartlett study were all\nover 60. Nonetheless, we are left with an unanswered question:\nAre the inflated rates of false identification shown by persons\nover the age of 60 restricted to lineups of young faces? The\nquestion is important, because, from a forensic point of view,\nwe need to know whether older eyewitnesses are any more (or\nless) reliable than young adults with lineups of older faces.\nMoreover, from the standpoint of theory, it is time to answer\nthose critics who have suggested that current conceptions of\ncognitive aging are too laboratory based to permit clear predic-\ntions about real-life memory tasks, including eyewitness identifi-\ncation (see Park, 2000, for a review). Any adequate theory of the\nother-age effect must explain its occurrence, or failure to occur,\nin real-life situations such as lineup identification. With these\nconsiderations in mind, we designed a study to assess age dif-\nferences in lineup performance using both target-present and\nJournal of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES Copyright 2003 by The Gerontological Society of America\ntarget-absent lineups of both young-adult and older-adult faces\nat each of two test delays (35 min and 1 week).\nIn addition to rectifying the age confound that made it\ndifficult to interpret some previously published findings, we also\nsought to determine whether a currently influential hypothesis\nfor age differences in memory could be applied to the lineup\ntask. A number of theorists have recently argued that many\nage differences in memory occur because older people have\nmore difficulty in recalling contextual and perceptual details\nthat specify the ``source'' of retrieved information (Johnson,\nwitnesses are therefore more likely to base their memory judg-\nments on generalized feelings of familiarity (Bartlett, 1993;\nSeveral recent studies have suggested that deficient source\nmemory is a factor in age differences in face recognition, par-\nticularly age differences in false-alarm errors (Bartlett, 1993;\nevidence that false-alarm errors with entirely new faces reflect\nan age-related increase in the use of familiarity for making\nrecognition judgments. Bartlett and his associates argued that,\nbecause the set of human faces is highly homogenous, even\nnew faces will often seem familiar because of their resemblance\nto faces seen in life. Recollection of source may aid in the\nrejection of new-but-familiar-looking faces. Source recollection,\nhowever, is impaired in old age, and this may be the reason\nthat false recognitions are increased in old age (Searcy et al.,\nAlthough the source-recollection hypothesis has received\nsome support from research using standard laboratory para-\ndigms for the probing of face memory, there is as yet, to our\nknowledge, no published evidence to confirm that source\nrecollection affects performance on lineups. In pursuit of such\nevidence, we therefore examined the relation between lineup\nperformance and a laboratory task that is known to tap source\nmemory. The laboratory task was modeled on a study by\nJennings and Jacoby (1997), in which a study list of words was\nfollowed by a recognition test in which the lure (new) items\nwere repeated at different intervals (lags). They found that\nfalse-alarm rates were higher for repeated lures than for first-\ntime lures among older participants but not young adults. Thus,\ntheir older participants showed a deficit in distinguishing old\nitems from repeated-lure items. Taken together with other\nresults (Jennings & Jacoby, 1993), this finding suggests an age-\nrelated deficit in recollection of source information.\nExtending the Jennings and Jacoby method to face\nrecognition, we expected to observe a similar age deficit in\ndistinguishing old items from repeated-lure items. Our principal\nconcern, however, was with whether this deficit in recollection\nwould show correlations with lineup performance. By the\nsource-recollection hypothesis, old versus repeated-lure dis-\ncrimination and lineup performance should be positively\ncorrelated, at least in older witnesses. In contrast, old versus\nnonrepeated-lure discrimination and lineup performance may\nshow no correlation with lineup performance, or, at best, a weak\ncorrelation. Discrimination between old faces and nonrepeated\nlures is likely to be based on familiarity information, at least\nto a degree; and familiarity information, by our hypothesis, is\nlargely age invariant.\nWe considered that the source-recollection hypothesis would\nbe best tested by examining the effects of length of test delay on\nthe lineup performance of younger and older adults. There is\nevidence that age-related source-memory impairments increase\nover time (Brown, Jones, & Davis, 1995; Henkel, Johnson, &\nDeLeonardis, 1998; Schacter, Kazniak, Kihlstrom, & Valdserri,\nevidence in relation to our hypothesis that age-related deficits\nin the lineup task reflect age-related deficits in recollection, we\ncan predict that older witnesses will show larger impairments in\nlineup performance with longer test delays. Whereas delay is\na variable of great relevance to forensics, its effects in lineup\ntasks remain largely unexplored (Kassin, Tubb, Hosch, &\nMemon, 2001). The available evidence from laboratory studies\nsuggests that the effects of delay on face memory may vary\nwith the type of measure. For example, hit rates on a face-\nrecognition task may decline with delay, whereas the false-\nalarm rates may show little change (Shepherd, 1983).\nIn contrast, Sporer (1992) found a decrease in hits and an\nincrease in false alarms over various intervals up to 3 weeks.\nMoreover, in an eyewitness study, Gwyer and Clifford (1997)\nnoted little difference following a 48- or 96-hour delay on any\nof their measures of eyewitness recall or recognition. A meta-\nanalysis of 128 studies of face recognition (80% laboratory\nbased) and 960 conditions suggests there is a linear decline in\nhits to ``old'' faces after a delay and no clear effect of delay\non false alarms to ``new'' faces (Shapiro & Penrod, 1986). How-\never, because none of these studies compared young adults with\nolder adults, they do not speak to the prediction of the source-\nrecollection hypothesis that age-related deficits in lineup\nperformance become more marked with increases in test delay.\nIn summary, in this study we examined age differences\nin lineup performance with both young and older faces. We\ntested the hypothesis (which was based on laboratory studies\nsuch as that by Bartlett & Leslie, 1986) that the accuracy of\nperformance with target-present lineups will show an age-\nrelated deficit, but that the size of this deficit will be reduced\nwith older faces. Additionally, we tested three predictions from\nthe hypothesis that older witnesses' problems in lineup per-\nformance reflect age-related deficits in source recollection: first,\nolder adults will show deficits in a laboratory test of source\nmemory; second, performance on this test will be positively\ncorrelated with performance on the lineup test; and third, age-\nrelated differences in lineup performance will increase with\nlonger test delays.\nMETHODS\nParticipants\nA total of 172 participants were tested (1 participant was\nexcluded from the data analysis; see Table 1). Eighty-four\nyears) were recruited from local colleges, and 88 older partic-\nipants had responded to posters and advertisements placed in\nlocal centers, clubs, and societies. The older participants were\nthey were in good health.\nTo determine the characteristics of our older sample,\nwe asked all older adults to take the Mini-Mental State\nExamination (MMSE; Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975)\nand complete the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS; Brink\net al., 1982). The GDS agrees well with clinical diagnoses and\nsymptom checklists (Yesavage et al., 1983). Finally, the\nNational Adult Reading Test, or NART (Nelson & O'Connell,\n1978), was administered to all participants. Table 1 shows\nparticipants' mean scores on these screening measures for each\ncombination of delay and lineup type.\nDesign\nAge group (young or old), lineup presentation type (target\npresent or target absent), and delay were between-subject\nfactors. All participants viewed two lineups, one for the older\nperpetrator, the other for the younger, the ordering of which\nwas counterbalanced. For 87 of the participants, both lineups\nincluded the perpetrator; for the remaining 85 participants, the\nperpetrator was absent from both lineups. Within each age group\nand lineup-type condition, approximately half the participants\nmade their lineup judgments after a short delay of 35 min,\nwhereas the remainder made theirs after a longer delay of 1 week\n(see Table 1).\nMaterials\nEyewitness events. --The incidents consisted of two separate\nvideo clips of a young man aged 22 years (young-target con-\ndition) or an older man aged 60 years (old-target condition)\napparently breaking into a house. In both clips, the perpetrator\nfollowed the same script (which lasted for 50 s). The facial\nexposure times were also equal (43 s). In each video, the man\nrang the doorbell to establish if anyone was at home, went\nthrough the side gate round to the back of the house, entered the\nhouse through the back door, and a few seconds later emerged\nfrom the front door carrying a camera. The purpose of the\nsuccessive presentation of the same incident was to obtain\na statistically powerful within-groups comparison between par-\nticipants' ability to recognize old and young faces.\nLineups. --Four lineups were constructed: A target-present\n(TP) and a target-absent (TA) lineup for the young perpetrator\nand a TP and TA lineup for the older perpetrator. The lineup\nphotographs consisted of 20 cm 3 26 cm colored full-face head\nshots presented in a 3 3 2 array. The perpetrator's photograph\nwas taken a few days after the video so that hairstyle and other\nexternal features appeared as they did on the video. Following\nthe recommendation of Wells (1993) that all lineup members\nmust match the eyewitness's prelineup description of the\nperpetrator, 20 independent raters rated a pool of photographs\non a scale from 1 to 7 (where 7 \u00bc a good match to the\ndescription). The five faces that received the highest ratings\nwere selected as foils; a high-ranking foil was used for the\nabsent condition.\nThe lineup raters were drawn from technical and secretarial\nstaff at the University of Southampton, who ranged in age from\n20 to 50 years. The lineup for the young perpetrator contained\nfoils ranging in age from 20 to 22 years. The lineup for the\nolder perpetrator contained foils ranging in age from 55 to 65\nyears. The lineups were presented simultaneously.\nFace-source-recollection task. --The study list and test were\nconstructed from a pool of 200 facial photographs of young-\nadult females unknown to the participants. The study list\nincluded 48 faces that, on the basis of their appearance, three\nindependent raters had assigned to one of six different\noccupational categories. There were 15 faces in each of two\nlarge categories (teacher and nurse), 6 faces in each of two\nmedium categories (hairdresser and shop assistant), and 3 faces\nin each of two small categories (model and housewife). (Color\ncoding was also used to ``cue'' the derived categories to our\nparticipants both at study and at test. Thus, different\noccupations were shown on different colored backgrounds.\nUnfortunately, we did not counterbalance the assignment of\nfaces to category condition or old\u00adnew status in this study, so\nthe category size data are not presented here.)\nThe study list also included 15 faces that the raters did not\nclassify consistently, so there were 63 faces presented in all.\nThe randomly ordered recognition test comprised the 63 old\nfaces, plus 31 lures, including 3 lures from each of the six\ncategories and 13 noncategorized lures. Each lure was repeated\nat a lag of either two or four photographs, creating three test\nconditions: (a) old faces; (b) first-time-presented lures; and (c)\nrepeated lures. The participant's task was to decide whether\na face had been seen before or was new. The instructions\nstressed that even repeated-lure faces should be classified as\n``new.''\nProcedure\nParticipants were randomly assigned to the delay or\nimmediate test condition, and individual test sessions lasted\napproximately 40 min. Participants were informed they would\nbe watching two short video clips. After the video, participants\nwere presented with a large number of female faces, and they\nTable 1.

Standard deviations are given in parentheses.\naThree participants did not complete all the items of the MMSE and, as\na result, had scores that were below normal (cutoff score \u00bc 24). All three,\nhowever, had normal NART scores but had felt insulted by some of the ques-\ntions in the MMSE. We therefore decided to retain those participants in the\ndata set. The GDS scores of seven of the older participants were indicative of\n``mild'' depression. Another person, however, had a score in the ``severe'' cat-\negory, and it was decided to eliminate that person from the data set. The sta-\ntistics shown apply to the reduced data set.\nrated each face for pleasantness on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 \u00bc very\npleasant).\nThe face-rating task was untimed and took approximately\n10 min. The older participants then completed the MMSE and\ntook a 20-min break before completing the lineup and face-\nrecognition tasks (short delay group). Because the younger\nparticipants did not complete the MMSE, they received\na slightly longer break than the older adults to ensure that the\ndelay between the face-recognition and lineup tasks (35 min)\nwas the same for both groups. Those in the long delay group\nreturned after 1 week to complete the lineup and face-recog-\nnition tasks.\nEach participant either viewed two lineups with the\nperpetrators present, or two from which the perpetrators were\nabsent. The two tests were given in the same sequence as the\nvideo clip, so that participants who saw the young-man video\nfirst took the young lineup first. (Kendall's tau b correlations\nwere calculated to determine the effects, if any, of order of\nlineup presentation, young or old first, and participants' choices\nin the lineup, that is, hit, false alarm, or miss. There were no\nsignificant correlations. The order in which the lineups were\npresented may nevertheless have influenced participants' lineup\nchoices.)\nThe instructions were to look at each photograph carefully\nand to indicate whether one of the faces belonged to the person\nfrom the video. Participants were warned that hairstyle and\nclothing might not look the same and that, ``just as in a real\nlineup, the culprit may or may not be present.'' All participants\nwere then asked to indicate how certain they were (on a 1\u00ad7\nscale) that they were correct in their lineup choice. The\nprocedure was repeated for the other video. The second part\nof the faces task was then completed. (The recognition phase of\nthe face-source-recollection task took place at the very end\nof the experiment. Although all our young participants com-\npleted the study phase of the faces task, because of class\ntimetable constraints, 29 of the younger participants did not\nhave time to complete the test phase.)\nThe participants were told that they would see a list of face\nphotographs, some of which they had seen in the first testing\nsession and some of which were new. They were asked to judge\neach photograph as either ``old'' (seen in Session 1) or ``new''\n(not seen in Session 1), and they were warned that new faces\nmight be repeated in the test. It was stressed that ``if a photo in\nthis second session is repeated, you should still respond `new'\nbecause it is still a new photo in the second session.'' Older\nparticipants then completed the GDS, and all participants also\ncompleted a brief self-report questionnaire that asked them\nwhether each of the video events was a criminal act. One older\nparticipant refused to complete the faces task because of\nfatigue.\nRESULTS\nIn this section, analyses are reported for several different\naspects of lineup performance: (a) the effects of age and delay\nupon accuracy of performance summed over the two lineups;\n(b) the proportions of correct and incorrect responses in the\nyounger and older lineups considered separately and the pro-\nportions for the TP and TA conditions; and (c) the confidence\nof the participants in their lineup decisions. Finally, we con-\nsidered lineup performance in relation to measures of face-\nsource recollection.\nTotal Accuracy Scores\nBecause each participant viewed two lineups, a measure of\nperformance is the number of correct lineup judgments that a\nparticipant made, which can take the values 0 (neither correct),\n1 (one correct), or 2 (both correct), corresponding to the\nproportions correct of 0, 0.5, and 1, respectively. The mean\nproportions correct for the young and older participants (across\nthe short and long delay conditions) respectively were .43\n(SD \u00bc .38) and .25 (SD \u00bc .32). The younger participants thus\n.002 (Mann\u00adWhitney test for ordinal data).\nTable 2 shows that, in line with our predictions from the\nsource-recollection hypothesis, the effect of delay upon the\nperformance of the older adults was greater than that with\nthe young participants: that is, there appears to be a Delay 3\nAge Group interaction. Because the dependent variable con-\nsisted of categories rather than measurements, multinomial lo-\ngistic regression was used to confirm the presence of a Delay 3\nNagelkerke's R2 \u00bc .145. This interaction is robust, both in the\nProportions of Hits, False Alarms,\nand Misses With the Young and Old Lineups\nTable 3 provides a more detailed view of the data for the\nTP condition. The entries are the proportions, for each of the\ntwo lineups, of participants' choosing the perpetrator (hits),\nchoosing one of the foils (false alarms), and making no choice\n(misses).\nIt is immediately apparent from inspection of Table 3 that,\nwith the young lineup, the older participants made more false-\nalarm errors than did the younger participants. (The same\ntendency can also be discerned in the data for the older lineup,\nbut it is much less marked there.) For this reason, the hit rates\nwere corrected to allow for the false-alarm rates (see Table 3 for\nan explanation of the correction). It is clear, however, that both\nthe raw hit rates and the corrected hit rates were generally\nhigher in the young group than in the older group. (The partici-\npant-age differences in hit rates, however, are larger with the\nold lineup than with the young lineup.)\nBecause each participant made judgments with both the\nyoung and the old lineups, a separate multinomial logistic\nregression was carried out on the data from the old and young\nTable 2.

In each regression, the dependent variable was the\nchoice category (hit, false alarm, or miss) and the independent\nvariables were age group and delay. There were no reliable\nand p \u00bc .108. In the data for the young lineup, however, it is\nclear that the pattern of young participants' responses was dif-\nferent from that of the older participants: the young partici-\npants had a higher hit rate, a higher miss rate, and a lower\nfalse-alarm rate. This pattern is confirmed by a significant\nIf, for the moment, we disregard the age of the participant\nwho is viewing the young lineup, it appears from Table 3 that\nthe introduction of a delay had little effect on the distribution of\np \u00bc .253. It is also clear, however, that the delay variable had\ndifferent (and quite complex) effects upon the distributions for\nthe younger and older participants: there is a significant Age 3\n.194. An increase in delay resulted in a greater loss of accuracy\n(hits) in the older group of participants. The miss rate, in\ncontrast, increased in both groups. An increase in delay had\nopposite effects upon the false-alarm rates in the two groups: in\nyounger participants, false alarms decreased; in older partic-\nipants, they increased.\nTurning now to the data from the TA condition, we see that\nTable 4 shows that, with the young lineup, age differences in\nfalse alarms are greater in the delay condition than in the\n.093. These data confirm the prior finding (Memon & Gabbert,\nadults make more false choices in TA situations than do\nyounger adults. Beyond this, the results also show, for the first\ntime, that this age-related difference is increased with test delay.\nThe Age 3 Delay interaction is less evident in the data for the\nConfidence and Accuracy\nThe younger participants were significantly more confident\nin their decisions on younger lineups than were the older\nsame comparison for the older lineup showed a nonsignificant\ntendency for the younger participants to be more confident than\nAn examination of confidence accuracy relationships in the\nyoung participants and in the older participants showed only\none reliable correlation, namely, a positive relationship between\nyounger participants' ratings of confidence on the old lineup\nand the accuracy of their decisions on that lineup: rpb\n84, and p \u00bc .008. There was no effect of delay upon confidence\nratings.\nFace-Source-Recollection Data\nTable 5 shows the data from the face-recognition and source-\nrecollection test administered at the end of the experimental\nsessions. ``Old'' judgments in response to old faces (hits) were\nless frequent in the long delay condition than in the short delay\ncondition, but, as in much prior research (Searcy et al., 1999),\nthe hit rates did not differ significantly for young and older\nwitnesses (M \u00bc 58 and M \u00bc .55, respectively, in the short delay\ncondition, and M \u00bc .51 and M \u00bc .49, respectively, in the long\ndelay condition).

Additionally,\nconsistent with what we found in our lineup data, false-alarm\nrates for new faces were higher for older adults than younger\nadults at both test delays (M \u00bc .39 and M \u00bc .26, respectively, in\nthe short delay condition, and M\u00bc.34 and M\u00bc.20, respectively,\nin the long delay condition). False-alarm rates for new-repeat\nfaces showed a still stronger age-related increase: M \u00bc .59 and\nM\u00bc.35 for old and young adults, respectively, in the short delay\ncondition and M \u00bc .49 and M \u00bc .25 for old and young adults,\nrespectively, in the long delay condition. We conclude that lure-\nrepetition increased false alarms, but this effect was stronger\namong older adults (M differences \u00bc .20 and .15 for the short\ndelay and long delay conditions, respectively) than among\nTable 3. Summary of the Data for the TP Condition\nYoung Lineup Old Lineup\nParticipant Age and Test Delay Hits False Alarms Misses Corrected Hits Hits False Alarms Misses Corrected Hits\nYoung participants\nOlder participants\nNote: TP \u00bc target present. Data are for proportions of hits, false alarms, misses (no choice was made), and corrected hits by young adults and older adults in\nthe short and long test delay groups with young and old lineups. Corrected hits are the hit rates ``corrected'' by subtraction of the false-alarm rates. (Because the\nprior probability of choosing one of the 5 foils is five times that of choosing the perpetrator, the false-alarm rates were divided by 5 prior to subtraction.) Both\nthe ``raw'' hit rates and the corrected hit rates were generally higher in the young group than in the older group. However, the size of this age-related deficit was\nmuch larger in the long delay than in the short delay condition. The ``corrected'' proportions are unsuited to formal testing because different participants contrib-\nuted to the hits and false-alarm rates, which were combined in the correction.\nyoung adults (M differences \u00bc .09 and .05, respectively). An\nANOVA of the false-alarm rates with age and test delay as\nbetween-groups factors and lure repetition as a within-groups\nfactor showed reliable main effects for test delay, F(1,127) \u00bc\n, .001. The interaction is suggestive of an age-related deficit in\nconscious recollection (cf. Jennings & Jacoby, 1997). More-\nover, Table 5 shows that the young adults (but not the older\nadults) could distinguish old-test faces from new-repeat faces. In\nthe young adult group, hit rates for old faces and false-alarm\nrates for new-repeat faces averaged .55 and .30, respectively:\nRelations of Source Memory to Lineup Performance\nThe principal question motivating this study was whether\nrecollection of source information is specifically related to\nperformance on lineups. To address it, we examined correla-\ntions between lineup performance and two measures derived\nfrom the face-recognition test. The source-memory measure\nwas the hit rate for old faces minus the false-alarm rate for new-\nrepeat faces, whereas the general face-recognition measure was\nthe hit rate for old faces minus the false-alarm rate for entirely\nnew faces. Distinguishing old faces from new-repeat faces\nrequires source recollection, whereas distinguishing old faces\nfrom entirely new faces does not. Accuracy in the lineup task\nwas scored as 0, 1, or 2 correct identifications in the TP condi-\ntion, and as 0, 1, or 2 correct rejections in the TA condition.\nTable 6 shows the Goodman\u00adKruskal gamma correlations\nbetween lineup accuracy and both measures derived from the\nface-recognition test, with the data broken down by age group\nas well as by lineup type (TP vs. TA). Pearson correlations\nshow precisely the same pattern. Lineup accuracy was reliably\ncorrelated with source memory in the TP condition but not in\nthe TA condition, a finding that held in both the young and\nolder groups. By contrast, lineup accuracy and face memory\nwere not reliably correlated. These data indicate that accurate\nidentifications in TP lineups were linked to our participants'\nsource memory.\nPerceptions of the Perpetrator\nA self-report questionnaire asked participants what they\nthought was going on in each of the two scenarios (i.e., the\nyoung-man scenario and the older-man scenario). The young\nman's behavior was viewed as suspicious by 82% of the older\nparticipants, as compared with only 62% of the younger\nolder man's behavior was viewed as suspicious by equal\npercentages of older and younger witnesses (74% and 75%,\nrespectively). We conclude that older witnesses were relatively\nmore inclined to suspect the young man (though not the older\nman) of criminal intent in the scenario used here.\nDISCUSSION\nThe main purpose of the present study was to test the source-\nrecollection hypothesis in the context of lineup identification.\nAs predicted, age-related differences in lineup performance\nincreased when the lineup was delayed by 1 week: the over-\nall accuracy measure showed a Participant-Age 3 Delay in-\nteraction in both TP and TA conditions. Searcy and colleagues\n(2001) reported that older participants had more difficulty in\nidentifying a person they had personally encountered some\n5 weeks before the lineup test and speculated that long test\ndelays might put older eyewitnesses at a particular disadvan-\ntage. The present findings confirm their speculation, in line with\nthe view that there are age-related deficits in source recollection\nand that these deficits increase after longer test delays.\nThe source recollection hypothesis was further supported by\nperformance on the face-recognition and source-recollection\ntasks. As expected, the young adults and the older adults did\nnot differ in correct recognition of previously seen faces (i.e.,\nhit rates were age invariant). In line with our hypotheses, how-\never, the older adults produced more false alarms in response to\nnew faces, particularly in the case of repeated presentations of\nthese new faces. In fact, among the older adults, new-repeated\nfaces drew as many false alarms as hits. Following Jennings\nand Jacoby (1997), who obtained similar results with verbal\nstimuli, we believe that high false-alarm rates for repeated-new\nfaces reflect problems in conscious recollection of information\nabout context or source. Our purpose, however, was not simply\nto document further age-related deficits in recollection. Rather,\nwe wished to determine whether these deficits have any bearing\non the extent of older adults' difficulties with the lineup task.\nTo this end, we assessed the correlation between the accuracy of\nperformance in the lineup task and source memory in the face-\nrecognition task. We found that our measure of source memory\nwas reliably correlated with the accuracy of performance in the\nTable 5.

This finding was supported within each age\ngroup and confirms our hypothesis of a link between\nidentifying perpetrators in the lineup situation and source\nrecollection. Moreover, because older participants scored lower\non our face-source-recollection measure, the data suggest that\nage-related deficits in identifying perpetrators may be associ-\nated with age-related deficits in source recollection.\nIn line with expectations, our measure of general face-\nrecognition ability (old-minus-nonrepeated-lure discrimination)\nshowed weaker correlations with lineup performance than did\nour source-memory measure. This outcome is both sensible and\ntheoretically important. It is sensible in terms of the hypothesis\nthat although lineup performance is based on recollection,\ndistinguishing old from new faces in standard laboratory tasks\nis based partly on differences in familiarity (see Bartlett, Hurry,\n& Thorley, 1984). It is theoretically important in ruling out the\nsimple notion that any two measures of memory for faces are\nlikely to be correlated. Contrary to that notion, the present\nfindings suggest that source-memory abilities are specifically\nimportant for good performance with lineups. Further research\nis required to examine the relations of source recollection to\nlineup performance. One unexpected finding that has to be\naddressed is the lack of correlations between source recollec-\ntion and performance on those lineups where the target was not\npresent.\nThe source-memory component of our face-recognition task\ncorrelated with lineup performance in the TP condition but not\nin the TA condition. Perhaps the factors that govern decisions in\nTP situations are different from those that govern decisions in\nTA situations. Although cognitive factors may be responsible\nfor decisions in a TP context, social factors (e.g., demand\ncharacteristics) may have a greater effect on decisions in a TA\nDespite its limitations, however, the present study is the\nfirst to find direct support for the hypothesis that source recol-\nlection is a factor affecting lineup performance. In extending\nthis hypothesis to a real-world domain, our findings serve to\nstrengthen its status as a general theory with the power to pre-\ndict and explain performance in naturalistic settings. Our find-\nings should also encourage investigators to pursue the applied\nimplications of the theory to a greater extent than they have\ndone in the past.\nOne of the purposes of this study was to determine whether\nage differences in lineup performance reflect merely a confound\nin prior investigations that have used only young faces as\nstimulus materials. On the basis of earlier laboratory studies\n(e.g., Fulton & Bartlett, 1991) and one lineup identification\nstudy (Wright & Stroud, 2002), we had predicted that age\ndifferences in lineup performance would be reduced with old\nfaces as compared with young faces. Our expectations were\nconfirmed insofar as false identifications are concerned. Al-\nthough older eyewitnesses made more false identifications than\nyounger witnesses, this difference was larger with the young\nlineup than with the old lineup. Our results therefore differ\nfrom those of prior studies in which Age of Participant 3 Age\nof Face interactions were found in hits, but not in false alarms\nwhereas earlier studies found age differences in hits were\nreduced with older faces, we noted a trend for age differences in\nhits to be larger with the older lineup. The discrepancy with the\nfindings from Fulton and Bartlett is not surprising in light of the\nmany methodological differences between the laboratory task\nused in that study and the lineup task used in the present\ninvestigation. The discrepancy with the findings of Wright and\nStroud is perhaps more puzzling; but, as noted in the\nintroduction, their ``older'' witnesses were substantially youn-\nger than ours. In addition, one of the limitations of the typical\nlineup study is that only one or two targets are used. Moreover,\nin the current study the witnesses were presented with two\nhighly similar video events and two lineups, all within a short\nspace of time. More research on this issue is needed that uses\na larger set of faces and different scenarios to see if there are\ncircumstances in which the other-age effect is more likely to\noccur.\nFuture research should also address an unexpected finding\nfrom our after-lineup questionnaire. Our older participants were\nmore inclined to suspect the younger perpetrator of a crime than\nthey were the older perpetrator, whereas there were no age\ndifferences in how the older man was perceived. We plan to\nexamine the possibility that witnesses' attributions about the\nbehavior of a perpetrator may be more important than the age of\nthe perpetrator per se.\n"
