    "abstract": "Abstract\nSexual responses are thought to be controlled by a brain module called the sexual module. Sexual strategies of males and females\nvary to a great extent, and sexual responses of males and females may be affected by their sexual strategies. However, the current\nview of the sexual module is that of a unisex module. This might be questionable since brain modules are defined as evolved\ncognitive mechanisms to solve adaptive problems which are different for males and females. We hypothesize that the sexual\nmodule responds differently in the presence of complex (high-order) contextual cues that are related to gender-dimorphic sexual\nstrategies in males and females.\nWe conducted a priming experiment in which stimuli related to sexual strategies were disentangled from their sexual meaning.\nNonsexual priming pictures related to either economic resources or social interactions preceded a sexual-target picture in order\nto test whether the primes were able to modulate the subjective sexual response to the sexual target. In a control condition,\npriming pictures without relation to mating preferences but with similar emotional impact were presented. In males, sexual\nresponses were similar in the experimental and control conditions. In females, however, primes related to economic resources or\nsocial interactions modulated sexual arousal significantly more than the control primes. Our findings suggest that brain modules\ndedicated to process the experimental primes were functionally connected with the sexual module in females more than in males,\nmaking females' sexual responses more prone to the impact of high-order cultural cues than males' sexual responses. A gender-\ndimorphic connectivity of the sexual module may be the way in which gender-dimorphic sexual strategies are implemented in the\nhuman mind.\n",

If in these\nspecies males sometimes contribute resources to offspring,\nfemales' selection will be based in part on the ability and\nwillingness of males to invest in their offspring (Buss &\nSchmitt, 1993). Accordingly, in humans, sexual strategies are\nfound to differ between sexes to a great extent, with females\nshowing a higher preference than males for mates who possess\nresources and are willing and interested in investing\nin children, and males showing a higher preference for physi-\ncally attractive and young mates than females (Brase, 2006;\nConroy-Beam, Buss, Pham, & Shackelford, 2015; Janssen &\nBancroft, 2007; N.

Several studies showed\na functionally specialized, automatic, and adaptive processing\nof sexual stimuli (Both et al., 2008; Gillath, Mikulincer, Birn-\nbaum, & Shaver, 2007; Janssen, Everaerd, Spiering, & Janssen,\nBoth, & Brauer, 2006), which is in accordance with the concept\nof an evolved cognitive mechanism (Barrett & Kurzban, 2006;\ning, we will shortly describe how sex research currently\ndescribes at a proximate level the functioning of the sexual\nmodule and what, from an evolutionary psychology point of\nview, is missing in that model.\nConsistently, influential models of sexual stimulus process-\ning assume that an internal representation of a (potentially\nsexual) stimulus undergoes several stages of pattern recogni-\nFonteille, Cornelis, Joyal, & Moulier, 2012). Essentially, this\nprocess is seen as a stimulus-driven process (bottom-up). How-\never, any type of meaning cannot be activated unless the sti-\nmulus representation matches a memory code. So far, some\ntype of top-down processing has always been assumed when\nmeaningful stimulus processing takes place. Memory codes\ncan represent either explicit knowledge or implicit knowledge\nsuch as response tendencies. Successful matching between\nencoded stimulus representations and memory codes is also\nreferred to as stimulus appraisal. If the activated memory codes\nare \"sexual,\" sexual responses are activated. Generally, sexual\nresponses comprise motivational, emotional, and autonomic\n(genital and endocrine) aspects.\nThe current theory of a sexual module is an important\nachievement for various reasons: First, it comprises descrip-\ntions of stimulus processing that are in accordance with basic\ntheories of emotional processing (LeDoux, 1996; O\n\u00a8 hman,\nFlykt, & Lundqvist, 2000); second, it is compatible with\ndetailed neurofunctional (Georgiadis & Kringelbach, 2012;\nStoleru et al., 2012) and neuroendocrine characterizations\n(Pfaus, 2009); and third, it acknowledges its evolutionary foun-\ndation. However, the multiplicity of sex-dimorphic responses,\nbehaviors, and preferences in the realm of mating is not\naccounted for in the current characterization of the sexual mod-\nule. This appears to be a theoretical contradiction, or at least a\nmajor gap, given that a sexual module is assumed to solve\nadaptive problems of reproduction that are of course different\nfor males and females. Thus, it is questionable whether males\nand females process sexual stimuli by means of a unisex sexual\nmodule.\nTo be more specific, particularly in females, the sexual\nattractiveness of a potential mate can be altered by additional\ninformation regarding his status or his fondness for children\n1990) or by the potential risk of male\u00adfemale aggression\n(Y. Li et al., 2014). Females' attitudes toward sexual stimuli\ncan even be altered by a context of luxuriousness (Vohs,\nSengupta, & Dahl, 2014). With regard to sexual stimulus\nprocessing, these examples suggest (1) that the sexual salience\nof a stimulus can be modulated by complex contextual cues and\n(2) that this modulation can be influenced by the sexual stra-\ntegies of the observer. Neither of these assumptions is\naccounted for by the current view of the sexual module. And\nin fact, these assumptions are not easy to reconcile with the\nconceptualization of brain modules, in particular with the\nassumptions of domain specificity and encapsulation (i.e., its\nrelative imperviousness to cognitive control). If the sexual\nmodule is activated preferentially by sexual stimuli, sexual\nstimulus processing (including response generation) should run\nrelatively independently of contextual stimuli. Similarly, a\nsnake might trigger more or less the same fear response inde-\npendently of whether a person is confronted with the snake in a\nforest or in a modern shopping mall. One possibility to recon-\ncile the contextual modulation of (female) sexual responses\nwith the assumption of an evolutionary-shaped sexual module\ncould be to assume that the processing of the sexual module is\nsomehow modulated by the processing of other brain modules,\nfor instance, modules dedicated to object recognition or social\nprocessing. The impact of other brain modules on the sexual\nmodule could be realized by varying, and possibly\nsex-dimorphic, degrees of connectivity.\nIn order to better understand the functioning of the sexual\nmodule in regard to sexual strategies, we wanted to test two\nassumptions: First, that sexual responses can be modulated by\nnonsexual contextual cues, and second, that such a modulation\ncan be sex dimorphic. To this end, we disentangled cues that\nare relevant for mating preferences from sexual meaning and\ntested their impact on sexual stimuli by means of a priming\nexperiment. We used pictures depicting either abundant\nresources (economic primes positive [EP\u00fe]) or a lack of\nresources (EP\u00c0) as priming stimuli to test whether the response\nto a subsequent sexual-target picture could be modulated. Simi-\nlarly, we tested the impact of priming pictures that showed\neither opposite-sex adults who were friendly looking or care-\ntaking toward children (social primes [SP\u00fe]) or aggressive\nlooking or aggressive behaving (social primes negative [SP\u00c0])\non the response to sexual-target pictures. For females, the facial\nexpression of an adult male has been found to be a proxy for his\nfondness for children (Roney et al., 2006).\nWe expected the priming pictures to modulate the response\nto the sexual-target pictures in females more than in males\nbecause we assumed that a positive economic or social context\nwould trigger functional connections to the sexual module of\nfemales in particular. However, emotionally positively valued\ncircumstances might enhance sexual response independently\nfrom evolutionary-selected, sex-dimorphic mating preferences\nsimply because a positive mood might be more compatible\nwith a sexual response than a negative mood (Klauer & Musch,\n2003). To control for such unspecific priming effects, we addi-\ntionally used priming stimuli without the social or economic\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nmeaning of EP\u00fe/\u00c0 and SP\u00fe/\u00c0 but with similar characteristics\nin terms of emotional valence and arousal.\nMaterial and Method\nStimulus Preparation\nFor each of the four priming conditions, 21 colored images\nwere preselected by the experimenters: (1) pictures indicating\nan abundance of resources, such as expensive houses, expen-\nsive cars, and jewelery (EP\u00fe); (2) pictures indicating a short-\nage of resources, such as barracks, humble furniture, and\nbroken cars (EP\u00c0), with no persons visible in either the EP\u00fe\nor EP\u00c0 images; (3) pictures depicting either one friendly\nlooking or caretaking adult or two (male and female) friendly\nlooking or friendly behaving adults (sometimes taking care of\na child; SP\u00fe, social primes positive); and (4) pictures depict-\ning either one aggressive-looking or -shouting adult or two\nadults (male and female) fighting or aggressively shouting\n(sometimes with a child visible; SP\u00c0). None of the (21 \u00c2\n4 \u00bc) 84 images of the four priming conditions displayed any\nsexual content.\nAlthough most of the images were used equally for male and\nfemale participants in the main experiment, some images var-\nied according to the gender of the participant. In pictures in\nwhich only one adult was visible (in the SP\u00fe or the SP\u00c0\ncondition), participants were exposed to images of an\nopposite-sex adult. In some images of the SP\u00c0 condition that\ndisplayed fighting adults, one adult was depicted as the aggres-\nsor while the other appeared rather as the victim of the aggres-\nsion. In these cases, participants in the main experiment were\nexposed to images with an opposite-sex aggressor and same-\nsex victim. While all images in the EP\u00c0 condition were iden-\ntical for male and female participants, five of the EP\u00fe images\nwere different for the male and female participants (showing in\nthese cases gender-typical luxuries--e.g., shop for expensive\nclothes for women or shop for expensive clothes for men,\nrespectively). Taken together, a male and female stimulus set\nof 84 priming stimuli was used, which was largely identical\nand, in those cases where it was not identical, it was analogous.\nThirty-one males rated the 84 images of the four priming\nconditions (male set) and an additional 298 images in terms of\nvalence and arousal (Bradley, Greenwald, & Hamm, 1993). We\npreselected the 298 images with the aim that they would not be\nperceived as related to one of the four priming conditions\n(EP\u00fe, EP\u00c0, SP\u00fe, and SP\u00c0). The 298 images depicted a multi-\nplicity of topics, like animals, landscapes, and objects, but not\nhumans. Of the 298 images, we aimed to select 84 images that\nclosely matched the valence and arousal ratings of the 84 prim-\ning images in order to serve as control stimuli. However,\nbecause we did not find enough images that closely matched\nthe 84 priming stimuli, we did a second rating with 20 males\nwho rated an additional 130 images. By this, we finally gath-\nered 84 images that matched the priming stimuli. These 84\nmatched images served as control stimuli (EPC\u00fe, EPC\u00c0,\nSPC\u00fe, and SPC\u00c0). Similarly, 24 females rated the 84 images\nof the four priming conditions (female set) and an additional\n300 images (again, preselected, aiming not to relate to the four\npriming conditions) to serve as control images in terms of\nvalence and arousal. Of the 300 images, we selected 84 images\nthat closely matched the 84 priming images with regard to the\nfemale valence and arousal ratings. Two-sided paired t tests\nrevealed no significant differences between the valence and\narousal ratings of the experimental primes and corresponding\ncontrol primes. Mean valence and arousal ratings of the prim-\ning stimuli of the four experimental and the four control con-\nditions and p values are listed in Table 1.\nFinally, we preselected 15 sexual-target images. These\nimages depicted heterosexual coitus. In order to prevent any\nsocial or face processing, in these images neither faces, heads,\nnor any meaningful background was visible. The visible back-\nground was mostly blank in light grey.\nAfter the main experiment, all priming images (EP\u00fe, EP\u00c0,\nSP\u00fe, SP\u00c0, EPC\u00fe, EPC\u00c0, SPC\u00fe, SPC\u00c0, and male and female\nsets) were presented to nine additional raters (three males) in\norder to validate whether the experimental priming stimuli\nwere perceived according to the intended priming conditions\nand to exclude the possibility that the control priming stimuli\nwere perceived according to the experimental priming stimuli.\nTo this end, raters were asked to indicate whether a depicted\nimage displayed \"economic abundance\" (EP\u00fe), \"economic\nshortage\" (EP\u00c0), \"friendly looking or caretaking adults\"\n(SP\u00fe), \"aggressive looking or behaving adults\" (SP\u00c0),\n\"destruction,\" \"mourning,\" \"death,\" or \"something else.\" The\nexperimental priming images were rated in almost all cases\naccording to the stimulus category (confirming ratings per cate-\n96.1%). Similarly, control priming stimuli were rated in 92.4%\nTable 1.

Oral contracep-\ntives were used by 18 participants of Group I and 19 partici-\npants of Group II.\nRecruitment was accomplished through announcements on\nthe campus of the Kiel University (Germany) and in the com-\nmunity that asked for participation in a study on the psycho-\nlogical processing of sexual stimuli. The participants of our\nmixed student-community sample received payment or course\ncredits for their participation. We prescreened the partici-\npants by means of an inventory to verify that they were not\nmentally distressed (Lo\nBy means of a self-constructed questionnaire, we verified that\nthe participants were heterosexual (i.e., Kinsey rating of fan-\ntasy and behavior of 0 and 1; Kirk, Bailey, Dunne, & Martin,\n2000) and had no history of sexual dysfunction or any other\nsexual disorder.\nProcedure\nParticipants were assessed individually or in small groups of up\nto five individuals. Following a general introduction and com-\npletion of the questionnaires, participants were seated in front\nof a computer monitor and keyboard.\nOne experimental trial consisted of 10 priming pictures (of\nthe same stimulus condition) and a sexual-target picture pre-\nsented consecutively. Each priming picture was visible for 1.2 s\nwith no gaps in between. Five seconds after the target picture\nonset, a visual analog scale appeared on the computer screen\n(ranging from 0% to 100%) and prompted the subject to rate his\nor her actual sexual arousal by means of a mouse click on the\nvisual analog scale. Three seconds after the mouse click, the\nsexual-target picture disappeared and was followed by a fixa-\ntion dot (3 s) indicating the beginning of the following trial.\nFigure 1 shows the general design of the priming experiment.\nIn the first part, the females of Group I were exposed to the\npriming conditions EP\u00fe, EP\u00c0, SP\u00fe, and SP\u00c0 (female set). In\neach trial, 10 primes of one condition were randomly selected\n(of 21 primes), followed by one of the 15 sexual-target stimuli.\nEach condition was repeated 15 times, each time with a differ-\nent target stimulus. Correspondingly, each target picture was\nshown in every condition once. Priming conditions were\npresented in random order. In total, one subject was exposed\nto 15 Trials Per Condition \u00c2 4 Conditions \u00bc 60 trials, corre-\nexposure time and the additional time the subject needed to rate\nher actual sexual arousal after each target. In the second part,\nthe females of Group II were exposed to the priming conditions\nEPC\u00fe, EPC\u00c0, SPC\u00fe, and SPC\u00c0 (female set). The remaining\nexperimental conditions (number of trials, trial order, stimulus\nexposure times, target stimuli, and rating of sexual arousal)\nwere identical to the first part. In the third part, the males of\nGroup III were exposed to the priming conditions EP\u00fe, EP\u00c0,\nSP\u00fe, SP\u00c0, EPC\u00fe, EPC\u00c0, SPC\u00fe, and SPC\u00c0 (male set). In\norder to shorten the total duration time of the experiment in\nthe third part (given the double number of conditions in com-\nparison to the first and second parts), we made some minor\nchanges to the third part. While the total number of trials per\ncondition, the number of priming stimuli within one trial, the\npresentation time of each prime (1.2 s), and the intertrial inter-\nval (3 s) remained unchanged, the visual analog scale appeared\nimmediately with the sexual-target stimulus and disappeared\nimmediately together with the sexual target after the subject\nindicated his actual arousal with a mouse click. The male par-\nticipants in the third part were exposed to a total of 120 trials,\nexposure time and the additional time the subject needed to rate\nhis actual sexual arousal after each target. The eight priming\nconditions of Part III were presented in random order. For each\nparticipant, mean response values were calculated for each\npriming condition to which he or she was subjected.\nThe effects of the experimental conditions on the dependent\nvariable (subjective sexual arousal) were calculated by means\nof two mixed-model ANOVAs. The first mixed-model\nANOVA tested the effect of the EPs relative to the control\ncondition. It was built by entering the following factors: a\nsubject variable, gender (male vs. female) as a between-\ngroup factor, prime type (EP vs. control primes [EPC]), prime\nvalence (positive primes [\u00fe] vs. negative primes [\u00c0]), and a\ncovariable of no interest (total sexual arousal). The second\nmixed-model ANOVA tested the effect of the SPs relative to\nthe control condition. It was built by entering the following\nfactors: a subject variable, gender (male vs. female) as a\nbetween-group factor, prime type (SP vs. control primes\n[SPC]), prime valence (positive primes [\u00fe] vs. negative primes\n[\u00c0]), and a covariable of no interest (total sexual arousal).\nResults\nOver all conditions, male and female participants were\nmoderately sexually aroused by the sexual targets.

Both mixed-model ANOVAs revealed a two-way\ninteraction between prime valence and prime type, EPs'\n\u00bc 7.4, p < .01, indicating that the experimental prime condi-\ntions (EP\u00fe, SP\u00fe) were associated with an elevated sexual\nresponse relative to the corresponding control conditions\n(EPC\u00fe, SPC\u00fe). However, this effect appeared to be driven\nby an increased response of the female participants, as indi-\ncated by a three-way interaction: With regard to the EPs and the\ncorresponding control condition, the mixed-model ANOVA\nrevealed a significant 3-fold interaction among Gender \u00c2\ninspection of the corresponding means (Figure 2a) revealed\nFigure 1.

These contexts are absent in the four priming trials of the\ncontrol conditions in the lower four rows. After target onset, the participants were required to indicate their sexual arousal.

This differential responding was not seen in the male\nprobands. A similar but even more pronounced effect was\nfound with regard to the SPs: The mixed-model ANOVA\nrevealed a significant 3-fold interaction among Gender \u00c2\nAgain, the corresponding means (Figure 2b) revealed that\nfemale but not male sexual arousal was increased by SP\u00fe\nrelative to SP\u00c0 and that this effect did not happen in the control\nconditions.\nDiscussion\nWe conducted a priming study aimed at drawing inferences\nabout the functional implementation of sex-dimorphic sexual\nstrategies in the human mind. To this end, we tested whether\npriming stimuli that are nonsexual but relevant for sexual\nstrategies can alter responses to core sexual stimuli (i.e., the\nfunctioning of the sexual module). To control for unspecific\nemotional effects, we additionally used priming stimuli with-\nout any relevance for sex-dimorphic sexual strategies but with\nsimilar emotional characteristics in terms of valence and arou-\nsal. As predicted, we found that the experimental primes\n(EP\u00fe and SP\u00fe) enhanced sexual responses beyond an unspe-\ncific effect in females but not in males. Additionally, we\nfound that an emotionally positively valued context (as rep-\nresented by the EPC\u00fe and SPC\u00fe) promoted sexual\nresponses. We found that the effect of these nonspecific\nprimes was similar for males and females.\nConsistent with the predictions of the parental investment\ntheory and with many findings about sex-dimorphic mating\npreferences in humans, here we found that females' but not\nmales' sexual responses were particularly enhanced in a con-\ntext of high economic resources and social attachment. In real\nlife, contextual cues often coincide with sexual stimuli and it is\ntherefore difficult to draw clear conclusions about the way\nthese stimuli are processed. By disentangling contextual sti-\nmuli from sexual meaning and by using core sexual stimuli\nthat bear neither contextual information nor facial cues, some\ninferences about sexual processing can be drawn. Since the EP\nand SP lacked any sexual cues, it is not likely that the percep-\ntion of these stimuli activated sexual stimulus processing (i.e.,\nthe sexual module). The EP and SP will rather have activated\nother brain modules designed to process emotions like fear,\nanger, social affection, or reward including functions of pattern\nrecognition and memory recall that are required to process\nthese stimuli. Most probably, the sexual module was activated\nin our experiment the moment the sexual target appeared on the\nscreen (and the EP and SP had already disappeared). The\nenhanced sexual response of females to the core sexual-target\nstimuli (after being exposed to the SP\u00fe and EP\u00fe) cannot be\nexplained by the sexual module as it is currently described.\nFollowing the current concept of the sexual module, the\nresponse to the sexual-target stimuli would be expected to be\nsimilar in the experimental conditions and the control condi-\ntions and furthermore expected to be similar for males and\nfemales. Our data rather support the two hypotheses we made\nregarding the functioning of the sexual module: First, that the\nprocessing of the sexual module can be modulated by the out-\nput of other brain modules; and second, that this modulation\ncan be sex dimorphic. This interpretation is in accordance with\nthe view that brain modules may have inhibitory or enhancing\neffects on some other modules, thereby allowing the mind to be\nSperber, 2005). We suppose that the brain modules that were\nactivated by the EP\u00fe and SP\u00fe were functionally connected\nwith the sexual module in females more than in males and that\nthese connections provide processing resources that can be\nused for enhanced sexual responding in case of a succeeding\nsexual stimulus. The same holds for brain modules activated by\nEP\u00c0 and SP\u00c0 which could be connected by inhibiting connec-\ntions to the sexual module in females more than in males.\nFigure 2. Mean subjective sexual arousal values in the economic (a)\nand social (b) priming and control conditions of the female and male\nprobands. EP \u00bc economic primes; SP \u00bc social primes; C \u00bc control\nprimes. Error bars correspond to standard errors of mean.\n6 Evolutionary Psychology\nWith respect to the control primes, we interpret the enhancing\neffect of the EPC\u00fe and SPC\u00fe stimuli within the context of affec-\ntive priming and automatic sexual stimulus processing: Positively\nvalued primes preactivate memory codes of the sexual-target sti-\nmuli because they are affectively related (Janssen et al., 2000;\nKlauer & Musch, 2003). Although the co-occurrence of positive\naffect and subjective sexual arousal has been shown previously\n(Peterson & Janssen, 2007), we are not aware of studies to date\nthat demonstrate the enhancing effect of positive affect on sexual\narousal,asitwasfoundinthepresentstudy.Itisofinterestthatthis\nbasic effect is similar for males and females, as it could reflect a\n\"unisex\" aspect of the sexual module's functioning.\nOur data suggest that the sexual module's processing is\nmore controlled by nonsexual brain modules in females than\nin males, or, stated conversely, that sexual processing is less\ncontext-dependent and more stimulus-driven in males than in\nfemales. However, there might be contexts that would impact\nthe sexual responses of males and females differently from\nwhat was found in the current study. For instance, in the case\nof long-term mating, males might evaluate complex behavioral\naspects of their mates too. Similarly, differing impacts of con-\ntextual cues can be also expected in females, depending on\nwhether short-term mating or long-term mating is involved.\nEffects of the menstrual cycle are also possible. Both genders\npursue mixed reproductive strategies and perform cost-benefit\nanalyses regarding whether short- or long-term mating will\nmaximize their reproductive success (Davies & Shackelford,\n2008). In our study, we used sexual stimuli that lacked facial\ncues, aiming to avoid identification of a potential mate in order\nto keep things as simple as possible and to enhance the potency\nof the preceding primes. Under these circumstances, without\nany information regarding long- or short-term mating, females'\nsexual responses were found to be more context dependent.\nRoughly speaking, when everything else is equal, females'\nsexual responses tend to be more context dependent (at least\nwith respect to the context we provided with our priming sti-\nmuli). This view is in accordance with a recent two-level model\nof sexual processing that states low-level \"straightforward\n(automatic) matching between the stimulus and an adaptive\nreaction\" more in males, and high-level complex cognitive\nstimulus processing that \"involves extrapolation beyond sen-\nsory input\" more in females (Toates, 2017).\nWe only assessed subjective sexual arousal. Therefore, our\nfindings cannot be generalized to genital responses. Genital\nresponding of (heterosexual) females is puzzling, since it is\nless correlated with subjective sexual arousal (Chivers, Seto,\nLalumiere, Laan, & Grimbos, 2010) and because it is less\ngender specific as it is in males (Chivers, 2017). There is evi-\ndence supporting our notion of an increased context depen-\ndency in female genital responding. For instance, female\norgasm frequency was found to be positive related to the male\npartner's family income (Gallup, Ampel, Wedberg, & Pogos-\njan, 2014). However, there is conflicting evidence as well. In\ntwo studies, Chivers and Timmers (2012) and Timmers and\nChivers (2017) exposed their participants to auditory narratives\nof sexual interactions that varied by relationship context\n(stranger, friend, and long-term relationship). The genital\nresponses of both male and female participants were increased\nin the stranger and in the long-term relationship context relative\nto the friend context. In contrast to the present study, Chivers\nand Timmers did not vary the context independently from the\nsexual stimulus. It is therefore not possible to rule out the\npossibility that the participants imagined in case of the friend\ncontext less sexually attractive partners than in the other con-\ntexts (stranger, long-term relationship). Beside this limitation,\nChivers and Timmers findings limit the notion that males'\nsexual responding is less context depended as females'. Com-\nplex partner characteristics (e.g., the ability to provide\nresources) might be evaluated by females more than by males\nand therefore be able to modulate the sexual salience of a\npotential mate in females more than in males. Such evaluations\nreflect the sexual strategies of a person. Our findings indicate\nthat these evaluations are realized at the proximate level by a\nnetwork of varying connections between the sexual module and\nother brain modules. A certain relationship context, such as the\none of \"no relationship\" (stranger) might be a context that\npreactivates sexual meaning in males and in females because\nit fits with the sexual strategies of both males and females\n(because of the male typical strategy of indiscriminative sex\nand females' pursuit for \"good genes\" in case of an attractive\nstranger). The central aim of the present study was not to test\nwhether high-order contextual cues modulate sexual responses\nin females more than in males in general but to provide a more\ndetailed model of how sex-dimorphic mating strategies could\nbe implemented in the human mind.\nRecommendations for Future Research\nThe current paradigm could be used also to study clinical man-\nifestations of human sexuality. Prevalences of sexual dysfunc-\ntions are highly sex dimorphic with sexual dysfunctions that are\nrelated to a decreased sexual response being elevated in\nfemales, like female sexual interest/arousal disorder, genito-\npelvic pain/penetration disorder, or female orgasmic disorder.\nIn contrast, sexual dysfunctions that are related to increased\nsexual response, like premature orgasm or hypersexual disor-\nder are elevated in males (Laumann, Paik, & Rosen, 1999).\nThis sex-dimorphic distribution of hyper- and hyposexual func-\ntioning is in accordance with differences in selectivity of mates\nas predicted by the parental investment theory (note: small\ndifferences between the means of male and female sex drive\ncan lead to extended differences in outer parts of the distribu-\ntions). That is, the elevated female selectivity might be realized\nat the expense of an elevated number of females suffering from\nsexual dysfunctions that are related to decrease sexual\nresponse. In light of our findings, we would suppose that in\nhyposexual females the functional connections between brain\nmodules that process EP\u00fe and SP\u00fe and the sexual module\nwould be less active than in sexually functioning females.\nThus, after a successful replication of these preliminary find-\nings, the current paradigm could be used to study particular\nPonseti et al. 7\nmanifestations of female sexuality and thereby enhance our\nunderstanding of sexual dysfunctions.\nTo sum up. Our experimental paradigm appears to be sensitive\nfor sex-typical differences in sexual processing, with females'\nsexual responses being more context dependent than males'\nsexual responses. Our findings are in accordance with parental\ninvestment theory that predicts females' mating behavior to be\nmore selective than males. Furthermore, this study adds to the\nfindings from numerous field studies in that females have\nstronger preferences for mates who possess resources and are\nwilling to invest their resources in children. We replicated these\nfindings under restricted laboratory conditions that allowed us,\nby disentangling nonsexual and sexual meaning, to study how\nsexual strategies impact sexual responses. Our findings are\ncompatible with the concept of a core unisex sexual module.\nThe activity of this sexual module however is most likely\ninfluenced by the output of other nonsexual modules in a\nsex-dimorphic manner.\nAuthors' Note\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical\nFaculty of Kiel University. All participants gave their written\ninformed consent before participating in the experiment.\n"
