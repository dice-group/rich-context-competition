    "abstract": "Abstract\nLong-standing results in urban studies have shown correlation of population and population density to a city's pace of life,\nempirically tested by examining whether individuals in bigger cities walk faster, spend less time buying stamps, or make greater\nnumbers of telephone calls. Contemporary social media presents a new opportunity to test these hypotheses. This study\nexamines whether users of the social media platform Twitter in larger and denser American cities tweet at a faster rate than\ntheir counterparts in smaller and sparser ones. Contrary to how telephony usage and productivity scale superlinearly with city\npopulation, the total volume of tweets in cities scales sublinearly. This is similar to the economies of scale in city infrastructures\nlike gas stations. When looking at individuals, however, greater population density is associated with faster tweeting. The\ndiscrepancy between the ecological correlation and individual behavior is resolved by noting that larger cities have sublinear\ngrowth in the number of active Twitter users. This suggests that there is a more concentrated core of more active users that\nmay serve an information broadcast function for larger cities, an emerging group of \"town tweeters\" as it were.\n",

Levine and Norenzayan\n(1999) studied how pace of life measures such as the work\nspeed among postal clerks and accuracy of bank clocks varied\nbetween countries and which attributes of a location's \"person-\nality\" (including population and population density) were cor-\nrelated. Such findings demonstrate that lifestyle differs\nqualitatively and quantitatively in different locations according\nto the nature of the place. Moreover, as Gieryn (2000) argues,\n\"we make places,\" an allusion to our social construction of\nplace--partially mediated by architecture and design.\nBettencourt, Lobo, Helbing, K\u00fchnert, and West (2007)\nmore recently considered macroscopic quantities that are\nindicators of the creation of wealth and of new ideas as func-\ntions of city population size. These indicators include new\npatents, inventors, private R&D employment, \"super-cre-\native\" employment, R&D establishments, R&D employment,\ntotal wages, total bank deposits, gross domestic product\n(GDP), total electrical consumption, new AIDS cases, and\nserious crime. All were found to grow superlinearly with city\npopulation, and mathematical models of social interactions\nhave been proposed to explain these findings (Bettencourt,\nCebrian, & Pentland, 2013). However, measures of city infra-\nstructure such as number of gasoline stations and road surface\narea grow sublinearly with city population, indicating econo-\nmies of scale (Bettencourt et al., 2007).\nBeyond productivity and innovation measures, one may\nalso consider other sociological indicators of city personality\nsuch as prosocial behaviors that promote social well-being,\nincluding volunteering, giving money, donating blood, or vot-\ning. Arbesman and Christakis (2011) found that whereas\npolitical contribution rates and volumes increase per capita\nwith city population (like productivity and innovation), vot-\ning rates and organ donation rates do not seem to change with\ncity size, and census return rates decrease per capita. If the\namount of effort to add another person to a population requires\nless prosocial effort--by the person or by the collective--\nthan the previous person, then one might expect prosocial\nbehavior to decrease per capita. Arbesman and Christakis\n(2011) suggest that whether a given behavior scales superlin-\nearly, linearly, or sublinearly may depend on whether a behav-\nior is limited to interacting with nearby individuals or allows\n1University of Maine, Orono, USA\n2University of Texas at Austin, USA\n3University of Illinois at Urbana\u00adChampaign, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nDhiraj Murthy, Moody College of Communication, University of Texas at\nEmail: dhiraj.murthy@austin.utexas.edu\nPace of Life in Cities and the\nEmergence of Town Tweeters\nAlexander Jones Gross1, Dhiraj Murthy2, and Lav R.

For example, billions of tele-\nphone call records were used to determine the scaling of call\nvolume, number of calls, and number of connections with\ncity population size, finding growth faster than linear\n(Schl\u00e4pfer et al., 2014). Twitter provides an opportunity to\nexamine whether there is variation in the pace of life across\ncities through metrics derived from social media data at the\nmicroscopic level, a method generally found to be lacking in\nthe social sciences (Burrows & Savage, 2014).\nThe social media platform Twitter allows users to share\nmessages restricted to 280 characters--tweets--among an\necosystem of over 300 million monthly active users (Twitter,\n2017). As a highly active marketplace of virtually mediated\nTwitter has drawn the interest of social science researchers as\nboth a subject of study in itself as well as a rich qualitative\nand quantitative data source to discern microsocial and mac-\nrosocial, economic, political, and health interactions (e.g.,\nArceneaux & Schmitz Weiss, 2010; Burrows & Savage,\n2011). Twitter has faced monetization and user adoption\nissues recently (Lynley, 2017), but the data we have collected\nand analyzed are from 2012, which many argue was the hey-\nday of Twitter as a platform for mass information exchange\nand represents the platform's run up to its 2013 initial public\noffering. Ultimately, Twitter at that time was a good represen-\ntative of general social media phenomena (see, for example,\nOur research seeks to explore and identify tweeting trends\nacross cities by examining the behaviors of individuals\nwithin them. The goal is to identify characteristics of social\nmedia behavior and usage patterns that are connected with\npopulation. We aim to understand whether social-psycholog-\nical and community characteristics of cities identified in\nclassical pace of life studies manifest themselves in virtual\nenvironments. Twitter provides detailed data regarding usage\nbehavior that enables meaningful data-driven analysis. The\nstudy presented herein is based on a collection of tweets\ntagged with geo-data from 50 American cities. Our research\nbegins to understand some of the complex dynamics of\nTwitter use in urban America. One may wonder whether\nTwitter, a service for technological intermediation, is\ndelinked from geography and so notions of physical place\nlike user city are irrelevant to behavior (Takhteyev, Gruzd, &\nWellman, 2012). Moreover, drawing from previous work\nwhich found evidence of more frequent log ins to social\nmedia among rural rather than urban users (Gilbert,\nKarahalios, & Sandvig, 2010), we hypothesize the opposite.\nHypothesis 1 (H1): The physical phenomenon of pace of\nlife in cities manifests in tweeting behavior.\nAs we will show, although a smaller fraction of the popula-\ntion tweets in larger cities, this core of tweeters has a faster\npace. In some sense, these active tweeters may act as an\ninformation broadcast infrastructure for their city, an emerg-\ning social group of \"town tweeters\" analogous to historical\ntown criers. Others have argued that local community-based\nservices including support of \"local products and educational\nawareness\" and pace of life may be linked (Mayer & Knox,\n2009). Given the possibility of Twitter serving as an informa-\ntion broadcast infrastructure for cities, we make a further\nhypothesis on aggregate Twitter usage in cities as a function\nof population.\nHypothesis 2 (H2): Aggregate tweet volume scales sub-\nlinearly with city population, according to a power law.\nOur research validates this hypothesis. As population grows,\ntweet volume does not increase linearly. Unlike productivity,\ninnovation, or mobile telephony measures, our findings are\nreminiscent of infrastructure scaling (Um, Son, Lee, Jeong,\n& Kim, 2009) like the number of gas stations or certain pro-\nsocial behaviors such as census return rates. We further\nrefine this in H3 as follows.\nHypothesis 3 (H3): Deviations from a power-law scaling\ncan be explained, in part, by aspects of city demographics,\nculture, and/or personality.\nThe temporal tweeting behavior of regularly active individu-\nals in urban America, whom we term town tweeters, could be\naffected by socioeconomic and other aspects of a city. As\nShah, Kwak, and Holbert (2001) suggest, new media use is\nnot homogeneous and seeks to \"satisfy different goals, result-\ning in varied patterns of effects\" (p. 142). Indeed, Barab\u00e1si\n(2005) has suggested that most observable social, techno-\nlogical, and economic phenomena are driven by the dynam-\nics and interactions of individual actions and has provided a\nmathematical model that generates experimentally observed\nbursty, heavy-tailed statistics of such human activity. Others\nhave previously observed the burstiness of tweeting\n(Chalmers, Fleming, Wakeman, & Watson, 2011) and related\nsocial media activity (Zhao & Zhou, 2012). In particular, we\nhypothesize a power-law distribution for the distribution of\nintervals between tweets for individual users.\nHypothesis 4 (H4): The distribution of intervals between\ntweets for individual town tweeters is well-described by a\npower law.\nUsing formal statistical methods (Clauset, Shalizi, &\nNewman, 2009), we falsify this hypothesis and find that\npower-law behavior is not the best description of observed\nGross et al. 3\ndata. Rather, other parametric forms which have finite mean\nfor interevent intervals provide a better fit to data. The power\nlaw with exponential cutoff distribution and other distribu-\ntions typically provide satisfactory fits, rather than power\nlaw. These distributions have finite mean but also suggest\ntweeting is a bursty activity, which echoes previous work\nthat finds topics in Twitter bursty (Diao, Jiang, Zhu, & Lim,\n2012) as well as posting of tweets (Raghavan, Ver Steeg,\nThe actions and interactions of individuals are often said\nto generate city-level phenomena (Arbesman & Christakis,\n2013), such as the sublinear scaling of tweet volume with\ncity size that we observed. As we have access to Twitter data\nat the individual level, we are able to investigate the relation-\nship between tweeting behavior of individual users and a\npopulation-centric notion of how they experience their city\nenvironment, informing our next hypothesis.\nHypothesis 5 (H5): The time between tweets for indi-\nvidual users decreases as a function of their city's popula-\ntion density.\nWe verify this hypothesis. The effect is weak but strongly\nsignificant statistically. This indicates that individuals in\ndenser cities tweet more frequently, which may seem con-\ntrary to the infrastructure-like tweet volume scaling we had\nobserved. To explain this apparent contradiction between\nindividual behavior and the ecological correlation, we make\nthe following hypothesis on the number of people who tweet.\nHypothesis 6 (H6): A reduced number of people tweet in\nlarger cities.\nContrary to telephony, which is point-to-point, Twitter has\nbeen designed to facilitate multicasting: the broadcasting of\nmany to many (Murthy, 2013). Since people have limited time\n(Aral & Van Alstyne, 2011) and must allocate it to various\nactivities that may be substitute goods with tweeting rather\nthan complementary goods (Miritello et al., 2013), the general\nincrease in pace of life in larger cities may, counterintuitively,\ninhibit participation by larger fractions of the population.\nTime, Pace of Life, and Town Criers\nTime and Pace of Life\nTime has been important to classical social scientific work\nand Weber (Segre, 2000). Though Weber did not have a spe-\ncific theory of time, he did observe how pace was socially\ndescribes how Weber saw factory workers change their pace\nbased on solidarity with fellow workers or changes in institu-\ntional regulation. Unsurprisingly, scarcity of time in urban\nWestern centers is correlated with pace of life (Garhammer,\nconstant flow of strangers. City life, from his perspective,\nbreeds a rhythm of life which fosters detachment (Simmel,\n1950). Veblen argued that constructions of time are associ-\nated with social structure (Southerton & Tomlinson, 2005).\nSocietally, gauging pace of life remains important as \"being\nbusy is symbolic of a `full' and `valued' life\" in many cul-\nfamously argued that \"Every disturbance of equilibrium,\neven though it may involve greater comfort and a raising of\nthe general pace of life, provides an impulse to voluntary\npace of life is a fundamental social question.\nIndeed, Chicago School sociologist Robert E. Park (1929)\nclassically measured urbanization by newspaper circulation.\nPark argues that \"culture, since it is based firmly on communi-\ncation, is always more or less a local phenomenon.\" Park's\nthesis is that towns and villages were losing their \"independent\ncharacter\" and becoming \"satellites of the cities.\" We are more\ninterested in sublinear versus superlinear distributions rather\nthan \"independent character.\" However, Park's argument that\ncommunication is local is important. Specifically, Simmel\nemphasizes locality when he argues that \"The City is not a\nspatial entity with social consequences, but a sociological\nentity that is formed spatially\" (Simmel, Featherstone, &\nFrisby, 1997). Of course, this formation of the urban spatially\nisalsoaffectedbylocalizedsocialcommunication.Historically,\nplaces such as community clubs and neighborhood centers, for\nexample, served this purpose (Guest & Oropesa, 1984).\nTown Criers and Information Flow\nEven with the pervasiveness of information flow in Twitter,\nwe retain the need for some anchored locality in the city,\neven if that is relatively vague and blurred. With previous\nstates of relatively sparse information, the town crier quietly\ndied and disappeared from our cognitive space, replaced by\nbroadcast media. Though the current state of surplus infor-\nmation has not resurrected the town crier as such, an oppor-\ntunity for core groups of criers to virtually ring the bell and\nmake proclamations has emerged as audiences appreciate a\ncrier making noise over the rest of the crowd.\nHoshikawa (1994) argues that mass communication\nmedia has led to a \"deterioration\" away from the \"commu-\nnity bell and town crier.\" The town crier has been globally\nresurrected for ceremony. For example, Tony Appleton, town\ncrier from Romford, proclaimed \"Oyez, Oyez . . . the first-\nborn of their royal highness, the Duke and Duchess of\nCambridge\" (Wright, 2013) at the birth of Prince George on\nJuly 22, 2013. In a state of information plenitude, the crier\ncan provide a direct cognitive hook, as can be seen in\nAppleton's case. Furthermore, the town crier has an almost\nhaptic role, allowing us to be closer and perhaps touch and\nfeel the news via its embodiment in the crier.\n4 SAGE Open\nMacDougall (2011) argues that \"the tradition of the town\ncrier\" has a \"phenomenological feel\" which can be seen in\nmodern broadcast forms such as podcasting. Murdoch (2010)\nhas also drawn a line between the town crier and bloggers,\ntracing an evolution of journalism. Twitter continues in this\nline. Miragliotta (2012) argues that Twitter is important to\nthe political public sphere; Bruns, Burgess, Highfield,\nKirchhoff, and Nicolai (2011) conceive Twitter as part of a\nnetworked public sphere; and Ausserhofer and Maireder\n(2013) conceptualize a \"national public Twittersphere.\"\nUltimately, the medium exhibits pace of life as well as\nnotions of localized public life.\nIn terms of the latter, some aspects of urban life have been\nfound to foster perceptions of anonymity and disassociation.\nNew social media technologies may be encouraging geo-\ngraphically based connections. In the context of larger urban\nstudies debates, this sheds light on the argument that the\nplace itself matters and local information from the place\ntherefore should be communicated. Studies of influence and\nTwitter tend to measure influencers, \"alpha users,\" by exam-\nining the most followed or mentioned users at the national or\ninternational level (e.g.,Anger & Kittl, 2011). However, very\nactive local Twitter users may be affirming dynamics of\nlocalized public life, ringing a bell like Appleton to draw in\nthose in the local area to protests, people's assemblies, or to\nread relevant local news stories.\nThe Importance of Twitter to Urban Life\nTwitter has been important both in shaping articulations of\nthe urban but also influencing urban life socially, politi-\ncally, and economically. This was seen in the Arab Spring\nwith the platform broadcasting images of Neda Agha-\nSoltan dying in the streets of Tehran (Couldry, 2012, p. 26).\nSocial movements such as Black Lives Matter (BLM) have\nused Twitter as a public sphere for youth of color (Carney,\n2016), and previous work credited the platform as a key\nmeans of communication by localized urban black stake-\nholders (Freelon, Mcilwain, & Clark, 2016). Moreover, the\nplatform has been used to broadcast important \"hyper-\nlocal\" urban news that does not generally cross to main-\nstream outlets (Agarwal, Vaithiyanathan, Sharma, & Shroff,\n2012). The medium has been used by major U.S. city gov-\nernments to engage with citizens (Mossberger, Wu, &\nCrawford, 2013) and has been regularly used during disas-\nters in concentrated urban spaces (Kogan, Palen, &\nAnderson, 2015). In urban spaces, where individuals are\nnot necessarily interacting with each other in specific com-\nmunity places, such as community centers, farmers mar-\nkets, swap meets, or other local municipal spaces (Putnam,\n2001), Twitter has been found to help facilitate a \"net-\nworked public\" (Tierney, 2013). Moreover, in everyday\nurban life, users produce and consume locally geotagged\ntweets, which constitute \"new ways of interacting with . . .\nUltimately, the platform is viewed as fundamentally\nimportant to urban life, given its historical utility in being an\nevent-driven space where a community does not have to be\nconsistent but can be formed around particular events, ad-\nhoc issues, or happenings affecting an urban population.\nFurthermore, Twitter use is part of larger processes involving\nsocial technologies and the \"socially conscious urban citi-\nzen\" (Foth, 2012, p. x) or, more playfully, through urban\nTechnology to Mine Twitter\nIt has been said that \"we have, in Big Data, a vast new natural\nresource, as well as the means to mine it for value\" (Rometty,\n2013), and Twitter is one of the greatest such resources for\ninsight into human behavior. Unlike many other social media\nservices, Twitter provides a high level of access to its data.\nCollecting small amounts of data is straightforward and can\nbe done via off-the-shelf free software, but collecting large\namounts of data is not. Twitter has licensed several third-\nparty organizations to provide serialized access to large\namounts of filtered Twitter data, including the possibility of\nfull access to the complete Twitter message stream, termed\n\"Firehose.\"\nData Model and Collection Framework\nAs per the recommendation of previous studies using geo-\ntagged tweets (Cheng, Caverlee, Lee, & Sui, 2011; Cranshaw,\nSchwartz, Hong, & Sadeh, 2012; Kamath, Caverlee, Lee, &\nCheng, 2013), we rely on the Twitter Streaming API (appli-\ncation programming interface) to collect data. We collected\nTwitter data from major U.S. cities. In particular, we com-\nbined a list of the 45 U.S. cities with the most tweeting activ-\nity (Tweet Grader, 2012) with a list of the 50 most populated\ncities to cover a range of population sizes and geographic\nlocations. Twitter allows specification of a set of unique\nlocations using latitude\u00adlongitude bounding boxes. We cre-\nated 10 individual collection scripts, each set to capture\ntweets from five of the 50 selected cities. The distribution of\ncities to scripts was guided by geographic location, popula-\ntion, and expected tweet volume (see Appendix A). This dis-\ntribution provides some robustness to any temporary outages\nof collection scripts, as streams are designed to collect data\ncontinuously over time. This framework allowed us to col-\nthese cities. Data collected with each tweet include the time,\nuser's name, and Twitter handle, the application used to post\nthe tweet (web, Twitter for iPhone, Foursquare, etc.), loca-\ntion, user profile at time of tweet, number of friends and fol-\nlowers for the user, total number of tweets made by the user,\nand the text of the tweet itself. We store this data in a tabular\ndata format (.csv) and analyze it using data analysis tools,\nprimarily MATLAB.\nGross et al. 5\nPotential Limitations\nTwitter-based research has innate limitations, and it is impor-\ntant to be aware of how these limitations affect the quality\nand robustness of the data collected. The Twitter API may\nsometimes experience data outages. Furthermore, our local\ncollection database maintenance procedures required collec-\ntion streams to stop for varying amounts of time. Twitter also\nmakes no guarantees or estimates on the volume of tweets it\nwill forward via Streaming data collection, only indicating\nthat users should always expect to receive less than 1% of all\ntweets, and some fraction of tweets that match their query\ndependent on the strength of the chosen query filters. Since\nthe process by which Twitter selects tweets to deliver on any\nindividual stream is proprietary, it introduces unknown\nbiases into the data. Our own experiments with a trial of the\ncomplete Firehouse as well as the results of others (Kamath\net al., 2013), however, indicate that this sample is representa-\ntive. There is also a potential procedural bias when using the\nTwitter Location Stream as tweets are collected only from\nusers who use Twitter's geo-location service, which is an\nopt-in feature. There are certain small but statistically sig-\nnificant biases in the Twitter users that elect to report their\nlocation (Graham, Hale, & Gaffney, 2014; Sloan & Morgan,\n2015). Urban users often use geo-location-based apps such\nas Foursquare (Cranshaw et al., 2012; Seeburger, Foth, &\nTjondronegoro, 2012), and there is greater rate of geocoding\namong urban users than rural users (Hecht & Stephens, 2014;\nMalik, Lamba, Nakos, & Pfeffer, 2015). Notably for our\nstudy, it has been found that when controlling for other fac-\ntors, population has no effect on the number of geotagging\nusers (Malik et al., 2015). Last, though query-based tweet\nsampling rates scale with total tweets, they may be influ-\nenced by factors such as tweeting frequency, retweet rates, or\nother criteria within Twitter's API parameters.\nTweet Volume as a Function of City\nPopulation\nThe first step in our study is to look at total tweet volume\nin the various cities as a function of their population; we\nused approximately 2.5 million tweets collected between\nmetropolitan statistical area population, Figure 1 illus-\ntrates the relationship between tweeting volume and city\npopulation. Using least-squares regression, we find that\ntweeting volume grows sublinearly as a function of city\npopulation or, in other words, the per capita tweet volume\ndecreases with city population. In particular, the power-\nlaw exponent from the least-squares fit is 0.952 (see\nAppendix B for formulas for least-squares fit of power\nlaw), which is between results for infrastructure indicators\nsuch as length of electrical cables and household electrical\nconsumption in German cities, that have scaling exponents\nis similar to results for the prosocial behavior of census\nreturn rates in American cities, with scaling exponent\nscaling results are contrary to superlinear scaling results\nfor productivity, innovation, and telephony.\nThis result, by itself, validates H1 since it shows that\ngeography influences aggregate tweeting behavior of a city\npopulation. It specifically validates H2.\nExamining deviations from the scaling behavior provides\ninsight into the personality of cities (Bettencourt, Lobo,\nStrumsky, & West, 2010; Garcia-Gavilanes, Quercia, &\nJaimes, 2013). Figure 2 plots the regression residuals (see\nAppendix B for explanation of residuals). We observe that\nLos Angeles has a significant positive deviation from the\npower-law model. That is to say, there is more tweet volume\nin Los Angeles than would be expected from the population-\nbased model. Other cities that deviate positively include San\nFrancisco, Las Vegas, Boston, Austin, and Atlanta. Cities\nsuch as Washington, DC, Dallas, Tampa, Detroit, and Miami\ndeviate negatively from the power-law model. There are sev-\neral potential features of cities we can consider to explain\ndeviations from the power-law model.\nOne potential explanation for deviations could arise from\nthe role of media and entertainment in peoples' lives and\ncareers in a given city. It is plausible that cities with a strong\nmedia focus may produce greater cultural relevance of\nTwitter. Among our set of cities, New York, Los Angeles,\nChicago, San Francisco, and Boston have been deemed top\nglobal media cities (Kr\u00e4tke, 2003). Technology adoption\nrates may also be a factor in city personality: some of the\nresiduals may be explained by the time at which adoption of\nTwitter achieved critical mass in the cities and the percentage\nof users who were early adopters in the city (Toole, Cha, &\nFigure 1. Tweet volume as a function of city population size\nin urban America. A power-law fit shows sublinear scaling, with\n6 SAGE Open\nA third possibility is that Twitter usage in cities may be\ninfluenced by demographic factors such as age, race, and\nsex. In particular, survey results suggest that African\nAmericans tweet more often than others, and areas with large\npercentages of African American residents tend to have\nhigher tweet volume (Smith & Brenner, 2012). Furthermore,\nTwitter and other Internet-based social media platforms tend\nto have disproportionately young user bases.Age of city resi-\ndents might be another factor explaining deviations from the\nobserved relationship between tweet volume and population.\nWomen are more likely to be social media users (Perrin,\n2015), ceteris paribus, and individuals who have a serious\ninterest in sports and entertainment are more likely to use\nbeen suggested that Internet skill matters in Twitter adoption,\neven after controlling for age, race, and sex (Hargittai & Litt,\nPerforming an ordinary linear least-squares regression\non the power-law residuals with the following explanatory\nvariables does in fact explain some of the variation: binary\nindicator of global media city (Kr\u00e4tke, 2003); Twitter crit-\nical mass achievement time (Toole et al., 2012); fraction\nof early adopters (Toole et al., 2012); age distribution in\ntion in city (White alone, Black or African American\nalone, Asian alone, American Indian and Alaska Native\nalone, and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander\nalone); Hispanic or Latino origin percentage; and males\nper 100 females. The age, race, and sex data for each met-\nropolitan statistical area are from the 2010 U.S. census. In\nparticular, the r2 value in the multivariate linear regression\nusing all 20 features listed above is .558. The full regres-\nsion table is given in Table 1. Although all the features do\ncontribute, the most predictive feature in the presence of\nall others is the fraction of early adopters in a city, whose\nrelationship to deviations from the power-law model is\nshown in Figure 3(a)--more early adopters predict posi-\ntive deviations. Thus, we have verified H3.\nFigure 3(b) shows the relationship between the fraction of\na city population that is Black or African American only and\nthe deviations from the power-law model. Contrary to\nnational survey results (Smith & Brenner, 2012), once city\npopulation is taken into account through the power-law\nmodel, the tweet volume actually decreases as the fraction of\nBlack or African American population increases. This is\nindicative of a \"town tweeter\" effect. These observations are\nan ecological effect rather than an individual one. Figure 3(c)\nshows the relationship for the fraction of young people (those\nbetween the ages of 15 and 24 years). Here, the tweet volume\ndoes increase as the fraction of young people increases, as\nexpected.\nWe have seen that aggregated tweet volume scales sublin-\nearly with city population. Moreover, much of the remaining\nvariation is explained by factors of city personality, such as\nmedia centrality, technology adoption, and demographics. It\nFigure 2. Residuals from power-law fit.\nGross et al. 7\nis important to note that tweet volume is an aggregate quan-\ntity consisting of entire cities and their generated tweets.\nSince our data are actually disaggregated to the individual\nlevel, the next step of our study is to investigate the tweeting\ndynamics of individual users in various cities.\nIndividual Tweet Dynamics\nReturning to the roots of pace of life studies where the tem-\nporal dynamics of individuals in cities are examined\n(Bornstein & Bornstein, 1976), we now study the tweeting\nbehavior of individual urban users. This provides a comple-\nmentary view to the city-wide aggregated phenomenon we\ninvestigated in the previous section.\nThe temporal dynamics of various human activities have\npreviously been found to obey bursty, heavy-tailed statistics\nfor the time between events; models based on the prioritiza-\ntion of human attention specifically generate power-law dis-\ntributions for interevent times (Barab\u00e1si, 2005; Walraevens,\nDemoor, Maertens, & Bruneel, 2012). Specifically, the time\nbetween tweets has previously been argued to be governed\nby power-law distributions (Chalmers et al., 2011). Here, we\ndraw on formal statistical methods (Clauset et al., 2009) to\nstudy the distribution of intervals between tweets for indi-\nvidual users in urban America. Rather than looking at all 50\ncities in our data, we focus on users in nine cities with a\nrange of populations and geographic locations: New York,\nChicago, Los Angeles, Orlando, Minneapolis, Austin,\nRochester, Louisville, and Boulder, as detailed in Table 2.\nThough all tweets from a given user may not be collected,\nwe can use information about the number of tweets made by\na user to determine whether there were any uncollected\ntweets during a given interval between two collected tweets.\nFor regularly active users, we have a fairly high number of\nidentified true consecutive tweets (around 50% on average).\nFor less active users, we see a lower percentage of observed\ntrue interval tweets. Intervals in which there was exactly one\nunobserved tweet are slightly longer than expected, and tri-\nple intervals are longer still. Shorter true intervals between\ntweets may make them more likely to be observed, that is, we\nmay be collecting more tweets from regularly active users\nthan from users who tweet less often.\nIntervals Between Tweets Analysis Methodology\nWe utilize a statistical methodology developed by Clauset\net al. (2009) to determine the statistical distribution of events\n- here, the intertweet interval (ITI) of a given user. We con-\nsider regularly active users, that is, users from whom we\nhave collected at least 200 total tweets, and select 16 users\nfor each city at random from this group; in Boulder, we con-\nsider the 16 most active users since there were not enough\nregularly active users. We further restrict our ITI sample to\ndata for true intervals rather than trying to infer ITI length\nfrom recorded double intervals, triple intervals, and so on.\nFollowing Chalmers et al. (2011), we considered whether\nthe ITI distribution of a given user is governed by power-law\nstatistics. A power-law distribution has two parameters: \nwhich represents how quickly the tail of the distribution\ndecays and xmin\nwhich is a lower cutoff for data points that\ndefines where the power-law tail starts. The statistical meth-\nodology tests empirical data against power-law distributions\nwith ranges of  and xmin\nvalues, using the Kolmogorov\u00ad\nSmirnov goodness-of-fit test to find the best fitting (, xmin\n).\nA significance test is then used to determine whether this\nbest fit is plausible for the empirical data. The same basic\nmethodology is used to find the best fits for other parametric\ndistributional forms and determine their plausibility. To com-\npare various possibilities that pass the significance test\nabove, we use log likelihood ratio (LLR) tests in a pairwise\nmanner to see which distribution is a closer fit to the observed\ndata. LLR tests yield two values: the LLR statistic and a p\nvalue. The LLR statistic indicates which of the two models is\nbetter, and the p value indicates the confidence in determin-\ning which is better. For each of the 144 users (16 users in\nnine cities), we applied this method.\nIntervals Between Tweets\nStarting with our working hypothesis of power-law distribu-\ntions, we find that it is plausible for 96% of the active users\nTable 1. Full regression table.\nAmerican Indian\nalone\nFraction of early\nadopters\nCritical mass\nachievement time\n8 SAGE Open\nTable 3. Fraction of Users Best Modeled by Distribution\nFamilies.\nPower law with exponential cutoff 54.2%\nto have power-law ITI behavior. However, the LLR tests\nshow that other distributions are more likely. In particular,\nthe majority of users have better fits with power-law with\nexponential cutoff distributions, and others have better fits\nwith lognormal, Weibull, and Yule distributions. Results for\nthe 144 users are summarized in Table 3. Note that of the\nusers, 113 were individuals with more than 50 true intervals\nand were determined not to be automated \"bot\" accounts.\nGiven the variety in distributional forms that are most\nlikely for the various regularly active users, there is no \"typi-\ncal\" tweeting behavior, contrary to previous human dynam-\nfalsifies H4. Indeed, we find several natural groupings of\ntemporal tweeting behavior. The prominence of power law\nwith exponential cutoff and lognormal distributions, how-\never, seems to indicate approximate power-law behavior\nwith thinning in the tail of the distribution. To understand\nthese dynamics further, we visually examine the empirical\nITI distributions and see whether the shape of user distribu-\ntions might indicate natural groupings of similar users.\nThe first natural grouping of users includes those that\nhave power law with exponential cutoff forms, as shown in\nFigure 4(a). One possible interpretation for this group is that\nthe underlying phenomenon is such that long gaps between\ntweets become unlikely. An alternative explanation is that\nbiases in the capture of tweets may arise due to the finiteness\nof the collection period and the large gaps in tweeting behav-\nior, causing reduced true tweet interval capture.\nThe second major grouping of users we observe have\ngood power-law fit in the head, followed by a significant\nhump from the power-law line, and finishing with a cutoff\naround the same location as many of the distributions from\nthe first grouping. Examples are shown in Figure 4(b). A\nhump might arise due to periodic tweeting behavior. If a per-\nson often tweets in the morning but then is unable to tweet\nagain until midday or evening and this behavior repeated\nover the working week, a hump at 4- or 8-hr intervals would\narise. This is similar to the time it takes for someone to\nrespond to an e-mail or a phone call. The identification of\nthis pattern is significant as it signals a hybrid that is not a\nfully Poison nor power-law distribution. Such bimodal distri-\nbutions have been found in various forms of human commu-\nnication that has an \"interplay between processes of different\ntime scales\" (Wu, Zhou, Xiao, Kurths, & Schellnhuber,\n2010). This also further emphasizes the importance of time\nand gaps in time to understanding social media behaviors.\nThere is also a third grouping of ITI behavior which dif-\nfers from power-law behavior, exhibiting strong periodicity\n(as shown in Figure 4(c)). These types of users are generally\nautomated Twitter bots set to send certain messages at fixed\nintervals. For example, Minneapolis User 12's tweet inter-\nvariation. This corresponds to 10- and 20-min tweet inter-\nvals. Indeed, this user is a bot programmed to tweet weather\nupdates every 10 min; the 20-min intervals may be the side\neffect of the bot missing its regular tweeting time slot.\nTable 2.

Univariate linear regression lines are indicated in black.\nGross et al. 9\nDisaggregating Tweet Volume\nIn the previous section, we saw that the tweeting behavior of\nregularly active individual urban American Twitter users is\noften well-modeled by distributions other than power law,\ncontrary to what we would expect based on the literature\nas power law with exponential cutoff, lognormal, Weibull, or\nYule, unlike power law, have a finite first moment, which\njustifies the use of the average ITI.\nIn this section, we look at relationships between mean ITI\nand city characteristics such as population. To calculate\nmean ITI for users, we find the first and last tweets for each\nuser with at least two tweets. The difference in timestamps\nand the difference in total tweet count at the time of the\ntweets yield the mean ITI for a given user. Note that the mean\nITI metric is unaffected by potential biases in per-user tweet\nsampling rate or by problems of unobserved tweet intervals.\nWe can therefore consider a much larger pool of users. We\nexperimentally determined that for a 3-month collection\nFigure 4. ITI distributions for some regularly active users.\nNote. (a) Two selected users display power law with tail cutoff behavior. (b) Two selected users display mixed periodic and power-law tweeting behavior.\n(c) Two selected users display significant periodic tweeting behavior. Power-law lines are indicated in black. ITI = intertweet interval.\nFigure 5. Mean intertweet interval for individual users as a function of the population density in their city.\nNote. A standard linear regression line (gray dashed line) indicates that the mean ITI decreases as population density increases. Not all individuals are\nshown but rather are represented by box plots where a red mark indicates the mean. ITI = intertweet interval.\nwindow, a 10-day observation envelope is sufficient to have\na significant number of users in each city, while controlling\nthe variance in user ITIs. We limited our analysis to users\nwho were observed to have tweeted at least twice and the\ndifference in time between their first and last observed tweets\nIn the \"Tweet Volume as a Function of City Population\" sec-\ntion, we had looked at the aggregate volume of tweets for all\nusers in a city, as a function of city population. Some have\nraised the issue of whether ecological fallacies (Robinson,\ncially when interpreting results for individuals. Previous stud-\nies only had access to aggregated behavioral statistics\nbut our data can be disaggregated to the level of individual\nbehavior. In this section, we consider mean ITI at the individual\nlevel. Furthermore, in this section, we first consider population\ndensity, rather than population as in the \"Tweet Volume as a\nFunction of City Population\" section. This is because popula-\ntion density is locally experienced by people, as compared with\npopulation which is harder to experience. Note that Pan et al.\n(2013) have developed a generative model for innovation and\nproductivity indicators in cities based on social interaction,\nwhich is parameterized by population density.\nUsing metropolitan statistical area population density\ndata from the U.S. census, we look at the mean ITI for each\nindividual user. Figure 5 shows a standard linear regression\n(despite being depicted on logarithmic axes using box plots),\nwhich indicates that as the population density increases, the\nmean ITI of an individual user decreases. In other words, the\ndenser a city, the more individuals tweet. This is an individ-\nual correlation rather than an aggregated ecological correla-\ntion and is seemingly contrary to what we had observed\nabout cities as a whole in the \"Tweet Volume as a Function of\nCity Population\" section, where greater population led to\nless per capita tweeting. This verifies H5.\nWe understand this phenomenon and connect the results\nhere to results from the \"Tweet Volume as a Function of City\nPopulation\" section. Even though individual users are tweet-\ning more frequently in more populated cities, there are fewer\nof them. Figure 6 illustrates the number of users who are\ntweeting in the various cities, as functions of population and\nof population density, together with power-law fits. The\npopulation density, which is strongly sublinear.\nThough individuals in denser cities tweet more often, the\naggregate volume of tweets decreases in larger cities because\nthere are fewer people tweeting. This verifies H6 and con-\ntributes to the literature in terms of furthering our under-\nstanding of social media use in large urban environments. It\nalso renders visible differences in urban life as not all urban\npeople are the same in their social media habits or even their\nuse or adoption of social technologies.\nWe may interpret this concentrated core of tweeters within\ndenser and more populated cities as the emergence of a social\ngroup we term \"town tweeters\" that serves an information\nbroadcast function. One might also conjecture that in dense\npopulations, there may be desires to strongly affiliate with\nsome subidentity to preserve individuality and yield guide-\nlines for who is within the homophilous group. People may\nbe more drawn to specific fandoms or race/ethnicity and reli-\ngious affiliations. Microcommunities may need more syn-\nchronous communication similar to \"naturally occurring\ntalk\" among members to sustain themselves (Giles, 2006).\nOf course, these processes can be understood through a\nsocial constructivist view.\nConclusion\nWe analyzed tweeting behavior and found it to be an indica-\ntor of pace of life. The temporal dynamics of tweeting are\nbursty rather than periodic, displaying a few different kinds\nof statistical distributions. Tweeting volume per capita\ndecreases with city population size. This indicates the pres-\nence of economies of scale with Twitter, much like with city\ninfrastructure. Remaining variation unexplained by city pop-\nulation is partially explained by aspects of city demographics\nand personality. However, an individualized (rather than eco-\nlogical) look at tweeting behavior indicates that individuals\nin denser cities generally tweet more frequently. This appar-\nent contradiction is explained by the fact that there are fewer\nactive tweeters in larger cities, and, indeed, one may say that\nthis active core of users acts as a broadcast infrastructure for\na city, an emergent, concentrated group, we term \"town\ntweeters.\" This echoes the town criers in Spanish America\nwho made public announcements via repetition (sometimes\nTwitter is a sociotechnical system which affords important\nforms of local communication that we might think are over-\nshadowed in an age of information abundance. Our findings\nabout people in cities of different sizes indicate that popula-\ntion is not the only factor. People post to Twitter in some\ncities in ways that deviate from expected statistical models.\nThis tells us that the culture and demographics of a city do\nmatter. Whether urban citizens are part of strong media or\ndigital technology cultures could be influencing city-level\ndynamics on Twitter. Particular demographic factors such as\ndisproportionately young citizens or unique racial composi-\ntion also likely shape a city's aggregate tweet personality.\nAlthough tweeting is a significant aspect of Twitter, it is\nnot all that Twitter is used for. Twitter has experienced\n\"declining person-to-person communication\", with users\nopting to retweet more than reply (Liu, Kliman-Silver, &\nMislove, 2014). It is difficult to judge how these types of\nbehaviors contribute to the overall nature of Twitter's social\nnetworking among various users, groups, and geographic\nareas. Further understanding of Twitter must include analysis\nof reading behavior, especially since Twitter is often said to\nbe an important source for news.\nStudies of the motivations behindTwitter usage have divided\nits population into three types: information sharing, information\nseeking, and friendship-wise relationship (Java, Song, Finin, &\nTseng, 2009). Certain users have a high reputation that is not\nonly contingent on how often they tweet but also on whether\nwhat they tweet is perceived as valuable. Such users who are\nimportant information sources would likely be \"town tweeters.\"\nSince Twitter is more concerned with information aggregation\nand dissemination than specifically with productivity or innova-\ntion, it is interesting to note the distinct scaling behavior with\ncity size encountered in previous studies (Arbesman &\nPan et al., 2013). Twitter is perhaps a multicast communication\ninfrastructure with economies of scale, rather than an emergent\nphenomenon like innovation, as measured through patents.\nTo further understand the distinction between the conversa-\ntional point-to-point and the information-sharing broadcast pos-\nsibilities of Twitter, one might look more deeply at the amount\nof @-mention tweets and retweets. Tweets with @-mentions\nmay be more conversational, whereas retweets may lead to\nFigure 6. (a) Number of users as a function of city population; a power-law fit indicates sublinear scaling. (b) Number of users as a\nfunction of city population density; a power-law fit indicates a strong sublinear scaling.\nAppendix A\ngreater information dissemination. Individuals who are not\nheavy Twitter users may be less likely to see and use @-men-\ntions; instead, they may choose to post undirected tweets and be\nless concerned with tweet visibility by their followers.\nBeyond investigating the notion of pace of life and describ-\ning the emergence of a core set of town tweeters, this study\nalso concludes that urban American Twitter users exhibit\nbursts of activity on Twitter rather than continued engage-\nment throughout the day. This helps counter mainstream\nmedia arguments that Twitter is \"taking over our lives\"\n(Meade, 2010). Rather than indicating a Twitter stranglehold,\nbursty behavior reveals that for some users, the medium has\nbecome a \"normal\" activity and an important part of one's\nlife. Of course, what is considered to be excessive use of\nTwitter varies by sociocultural contexts and bursty distribu-\ntions may be at a time scale appropriate to their contextual-\nized use. Users without a pattern of bursty behavior use\nTwitter in a fundamentally different way, most likely because\nthey are spam-based or bots. These users could also be part of\nan increasing group who are not tweeting but are on Twitter to\nread the tweets of users they follow, particularly celebrities,\nnews outlets, professional contacts, and family/friends.\nThere is high variation in tweeting behavior, perhaps due\nto the emergence of distinct social groups within the Twitter\ncommunity. It should be noted that due to privacy concerns,\nsome have multiple Twitter accounts to create a division\nbetween their professional and personal use of the platform\n(Vitak, Blasiola, Patil, & Litt, 2015). Others become more\nengaged or even have several different active accounts in\noperation. In addition, there is an increasing trend of short-\nlived parody/comedy accounts. Other bursty behavior could\nalso be attributed to the fact that Twitter is used in lieu of\nblog posts by some users (Huston & Weiss, 2011).\nTwitter activity has continued to grow as users find some\nlevel of social gratification from tweeting, which has been\nseen to be correlated with the average number of @-replies per\nweek as well as the number of active months spent on the\nmedium (Chen, 2011). Though users adopt different tweeting\nbehaviors, the normalcy of bursty activity on Twitter suggests\nthat our online social communication in this medium adds to\nour diverse forms of social communication, rather than domi-\nnating it. Ultimately, our social behavior on Twitter sheds light\nontheclassicquestionofcitylifeandpaceoflife.Unexpectedly,\nit also indicates the continuing power of spatially anchored\n\"town tweeters\" as well. Though we do not empirically study\nnotions of community and Twitter, the presence of \"town\ntweeters\" does speak to the ways in which social media may\nbe contributing toward localized (albeit globally networked)\ninformation distributors. Simmel (1950) saw the metropolis as\nhaving a constant flow of strangers and city life breeding a\nrhythm of life which fosters detachment. Perhaps the town\ntweeters are a response to this perceived detachment.\nDistribution of City to Unique Collectors.\nCollector 1 Collector 2 Collector 3 Collector 4 Collector 5\nLos Angeles, CA Chicago, IL New York, NY Atlanta, GA San Francisco, CA\nMinneapolis, MN Denver, CO Miami, FL Orlando, FL Las Vegas, NV\nCharlotte, NC San Jose, CA Columbus, OH San Antonio, TX Pittsburgh, PA\nCincinnati, OH Cleveland, OH Sacramento, CA Detroit, MI Milwaukee, WI\nKansas City, MO Omaha, NE Oklahoma City, OK Fresno, CA Albuquerque, NM\nCollector 6 Collector 7 Collector 8 Collector 9 Collector 10\nBoston, MA Dallas, TX San Diego, CA Seattle, WA Houston, TX\nPhiladelphia, PA Portland, OR Phoenix, AZ Austin, TX Washington, DC\nIndianapolis, IN Nashville, TN Memphis, TN El Paso, TX Tampa, FL\nRichmond, VA Raleigh, NC New Orleans, LA Baltimore, MDa Louisville, KY\nBoulder, CO Rochester, NY Salt Lake City, UT Jacksonville, FL Tucson, AZ\naTweets from Baltimore, MD, were not regularly captured due to data errors and were removed from our analysis retrospectively.\nAppendix B\nStatistical Analysis in a Nutshell\nIn this appendix, we describe the basics of our statistical\nmethodology for readers that may be unfamiliar with such\nprocedures for inference from data. For more details, please\nsee, for example, Clauset et al. (2009) or any survey-level\nliterature.\nTo fit data to a power law hypothesis, we must find the\nleast-squares estimates of the presumed parametric form. In\nparticular, given a function of the form,\ny AxB\n= ,\nLeast-squares fitting of n data points gives the coefficients\nas,\nb\nn x y x y\nn x\ni\nn\ni i\ni\nn\ni\ni\nn\ni\nn\ni\ni\nn\n=\n( )- ( ) ( )\n( ) -\n= = =\n= =\n  \n\nln ln ln ln\nln \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nln\n,\nxi\na\nn y b x\nn\ni\nn\ni\ni\nn\ni\n=\n( )- ( )\n= =\n \nln ln\n,\nwhere B b\n= and A ea\n= .\nOnce data are fit to a model, we can look at the unex-\nplained variation in the data. This is done by subtracting the\npower-law model predictions from the true data. These sub-\ntracted values are called the regression residuals. If there are\nfeatures, for example, of city personality, that might explain\nthese residuals, one can perform an ordinary least-squares\nregression to investigate. This tries to find a linear combina-\ntion of the various factors to explain the variable of interest.\nAnother kind of analysis is concerned not with modeling\na relationship as a power law but modeling the statistical dis-\ntribution of some random variate according to a given para-\nmetric form, such as power-law distribution or power law\nwith exponential cutoff. That is to say, the relationship\nbetween the variate value and its probability density function\n(or probability mass function if discrete-valued) is governed\nby a power law or some other parametric form. The main text\nexplains statistical tests for such an investigation.\n"
