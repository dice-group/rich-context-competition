Lapacho has been used in traditional medicine by several South and Central American indigenous people\nto treat various types of cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antimetastatic properties of -lapachone\nand the underlying mechanisms using colon cancer cells. Methods: This research used metastatic murine colon cancer\ncell lines, colon 26 (CT26) and colon 38 (MC38). A WST assay, annexin V assay, cell cycle analysis, wound healing assay,\ninvasion assay, western blot analysis, and real-time reverse transcription\u00adpolymerase chain reaction were performed\nto examine the effects of -lapachone on metastatic phenotypes and molecular mechanisms. The effect of -lapachone\non lung metastasis was assessed in a mouse experimental metastasis model. Results: We found that the inhibition of\nproliferation of the colon cancer cell lines by -lapachone was due to the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.\n-Lapachone induced the apoptosis of CT26 cells through caspase-3, -8, and -9 activation; poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase\ncleavage; and downregulation of the Bcl-2 family in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, a low concentration\nof -lapachone decreased the cell migration and invasion by decreasing the expression of matrix metalloproteinases-2 and\n-9, and increased the expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases-1 and -2. Moreover, -lapachone treatment\nregulated the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers such as E- and N-cadherin, vimentin, -catenin, and\nSnail in CT26 cells. In the mouse experimental metastasis model, -lapachone significantly inhibited the lung metastasis of\nCT26 cells. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated the inhibitory effect of -lapachone on colorectal lung metastasis.\nThis compound may be useful for developing therapeutic agents to treat metastatic cancer.\n",

CRC patients with untreated metastatic can-\ncer have a median survival period of less than 10 months\nand a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%.3,4 In particular,\nlung metastasis is seen in 10% to 20% of patients with CRC,\nand studies have reported 5-year survival rates of 24% to\n64% in patients who have undergone resection.5,6 In the past\n1Wonkwang University, Iksan, Republic of Korea\n2Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea\n3Dong-eui Institute of Technology, Busan, Republic of Korea\nCorresponding Authors:\nJae-Young Um, Department of Pharmacology, College of Korean\nMedicine, Kyung Hee University, 26, Kyungheedae-ro, Dongdaemun-gu,\nEmail: jyum@khu.ac.kr\nSeung-Heon Hong, Department of Oriental Pharmacy, College of\nPharmacy, Wonkwang-Oriental Medicines Research Institute, Wonkwang\nE-mail: jooklim@wku.ac.kr\n-Lapachone Inhibits Lung Metastasis of\nColorectal Cancer by Inducing Apoptosis\nJi-Ye Kee, PhD1, Yo-Han Han, MS1, Jinbong Park, KMD2, Dae-Seung Kim, MS1,\nJeong-Geon Mun, BS1, Kwang Seok Ahn, PhD2, Hyun-Jung Kim, PhD3,\nJae-Young Um, PhD2, and Seung-Heon Hong, PhD1\n Keywords\n-lapachone, colorectal cancer, apoptosis, lung metastasis, CT26 cells\nwith the significant increases in the incidence rates of CRC,\nmortality rates have also continued to increase.7\nMetastasis is the spread of cancer cells from the primary\nlesion to remote organs, and abnormally fast growth of\nmetastases is the most harmful aspect of cancer.8 Metastasis\nis a complex process of cancer cells spreading from a primary\nsite and forming tumors at distant sites. It occurs through a\nmultistep process by which primary tumor cells lose cellular\nadhesion and increase cellular motility. To metastasize into\ndistant tissues, cancer cells need to acquire special properties\nthat would enable them to invade the extracellular matrix\n(ECM), migrate to and invade lymph nodes and blood ves-\nsels, and then adhere and survive in target organs.9\nMatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important extra-\ncellular proteases that can trigger the degradation of ECM\nand provide a pathway for cancer cells to migrate, invade,\nand spread to distant organs.10 Tissue inhibitors of metallo-\nproteinases (TIMPs) are endogenous inhibitors of the\nhydrolytic activities of MMPs and are consequently impor-\ntant regulators of ECM turnover, tissue remodeling, and\ncellular behavior.11,12 Therefore, the role of MMPs and\nTIMPs is important during the migration and invasion steps\nof the metastatic process.\nEpithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular\nprocess in which epithelial cells appear as mesenchymal\ncells during cancer progression and metastasis.13,14\nAdvanced tumor cells frequently exhibit marked downregu-\nlation of epithelial markers and a loss of intercellular junc-\ntions, resulting in a loss of epithelial polarity and reduced\nintercellular adhesion.15 The loss of epithelial features is\noften accompanied by increased cell motility and expres-\nsion of mesenchymal genes. EMT regulatory transcription\nfactors, including -catenin, Snail, and Slug, change the\nepithelial gene expression profile, decrease the expression\nof genes encoding epithelial cell-cell adhesion complexes\nand cytokeratins, and increase the expression of genes\nencoding mesenchymal markers.16,17 These factors are\nexpressed in various cancer types such as breast cancer,\nInduction of apoptosis or cell cycle arrest is important\nfor tumor suppression.21 Synthetic inhibitors of cyclins\nand cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) induce cell cycle\narrest and could be therefore useful as anticancer agents.22\nApoptosis is the process of programmed cell death, which\nchanges the cell morphology, induces nuclear and DNA\nfragmentation and chromatin condensation, and ultimately\nleads to cell death. Apoptotic cells are eliminated by\nphagocytes such as macrophages, without eliciting inflam-\nmation, whereas necrotic cells release products of cell\ndeath, which promote an inflammatory response.23\nTherefore, induction of cancer cell apoptosis is considered\na therapeutic method against the progression of cancer.\nVarious natural products and compounds can induce apop-\ntosis by regulating the expression of apoptotic or cell\ncycle\u00adrelated factors in cancer cells.24\nLapacho trees (Tabebuia impetiginosa, syn. T avellane-\ndae), native to South America, have been used in traditional\nmedicine by South and Central Americans for thousands of\nyears. This plant has been used to treat bacterial infections,\nfever, malaria, and stomach diseases, as well as several types\nof cancer.25 -Lapachone, a natural quinone compound, is the\nmain bioactive compound obtained from lapacho trees. It\nshows various pharmacological effects, including antibacte-\nrial, antifungal, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory activities.26-29\nIn particular, this compound has been considered one of the\nmain antitumor compounds and investigated to elucidate its\nantitumor effects and mechanisms. -Lapachone selectively\ninduces apoptotic death in various cancer cells, including\nbreast cancer, prostate cancer, and leukemia.30,31 Moreover,\n-lapachone also shows antitumor effects in human colon\ncancer cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a\nsirtuin 1\u00adforkhead box O1 or a caspase-mediated pathway,\nalong with the elevation of either quinone oxidoreductase 1\n(NQO1) or death receptor 5 levels.25 However, the antimeta-\nstatic effects of -lapachone have been rarely reported, and\nthe effect of -lapachone on colorectal metastasis has not\nbeen clarified.32,33 Therefore, we investigated the antimeta-\nstatic effect and mechanism of -lapachone action using\nmetastatic colon cancer cell lines and a mouse experimental\nmetastasis model.\nMaterials and Methods\nAntibodies and Reagents\nAnti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspase-3, and\ncaspase-8 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling\nTechnology, Inc (Danvers, MA). Caspase-9 antibody was\npurchased from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY).\nB-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) antibody was purchased from\nSanta Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (Santa Cruz, CA). Bcl-xL,\nBcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), and -tubulin antibodies\nwere purchased from Bioworld Technology (Louis Park,\nMN). -Lapachone was chemically synthesized by KT&G\nLife Science (Suwon, Korea).\nCell Culture\nThe mouse colon carcinoma cell lines colon 26 (CT26) and\ncolon 38 (MC38) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified\nEagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY)\nsupplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum\nand incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO\nincubator.\nAnimals\nBALB/c female mice (5 weeks old, 19-20 g) were pur-\nchased from Da-Mool Science (Daejeon, Korea). They\nwere housed, 6 per cage, in a laminar airflow room\nmaintained at a temperature of 22 \u00b1 1\u00b0C and a relative\nhumidity of 55 \u00b1 1% throughout the study. The research\nwas conducted in accordance with the internationally\naccepted principles for laboratory animal use and care as\nstated in the Wonkwang University guidelines\nCell Viability Assay\nCell viability was quantified using the cell proliferation\nnitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium,\nmonosodium salt] (Enzo Life Sciences). Cells were seeded\n-lapachone-containing medium was added to the wells.\nAfter the incubation, the medium was changed, followed\nby the addition of a WST-8 solution, and absorbance was\nAnnexin V Assay\nAnnexin V assay was carried out using FITC Annexin V\napoptosis detection kit I (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA).\nHarvested cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-\nbuffered saline (PBS) and then resuspended in 1\u00d7 Annexin\nsuspension (1 \u00d7 105 cells) was transferred to a 5-mL culture\ntube and labeled with 3 \u00b5L of a titrated fluorescein isothio-\ncyanate (FITC)-labeled annexin V and propidium iodide\n(PI) staining solution. The cells were vortexed and incu-\nbated for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark. The\nvolume was then adjusted to 500 \u00b5L, and the cells were\nanalyzed using a FACS-Calibur flow cytometer (BD\nBiosciences).\nWestern Blot Analysis\nous concentrations of -lapachone. The stimulated cells\nwere rinsed with PBS and then lysed in lysis buffer\n(iNtRon Biotech, Seoul, Korea) for 1 hour. The cell\nthe quantity of protein in the cytoplasmic and nuclear\nfractions was evaluated using a bicinchoninic acid protein\nassay. The supernatant was mixed with 2\u00d7 sample buffer,\nthen proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and\ntransferred to an Immobilon-P nylon membrane\n(Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked\nwith 5% skim milk for 1.5 hours and incubated for 3\nhours with primary antibodies. The bound antibodies\nwere detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated\nanti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and IgG antibodies (Dako,\nGlostrup, Denmark) using an enhanced chemilumines-\ncence system (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).\nCell Cycle Analysis\nThe cell cycle distribution was assessed using the Muse cell\ncycle kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions. CT26 cells (1 \u00d7 106 cells/well) were plated in\n6-well plates and incubated with various concentrations of\n-lapachone for 24 hours. The cells were harvested and\nfixed with 70% ice-cold ethanol at -20\u00b0C for at least 3\nhours. After washing with PBS, the cell pellets were resus-\npended in 200 \u00b5L of the cell cycle reagent and incubated for\n30 minutes at room temperature in the dark. The cells were\nanalyzed using a Muse cell analyzer, and the cell cycle\nphase distribution was quantified using the Muse analysis\nsoftware (Millipore).\nReal-Time Reverse Transcription (RT)\u00ad\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)\nTotal RNA was extracted using an RNA-spin total RNA\nextraction kit (iNtRon Biotech) according to the manufac-\nturer's directions. First-strand cDNA was prepared from an\nRNA template (2 \u00b5g) using an oligo(dT)18 primer and a\nPower cDNA synthesis kit (iNtRon Biotech). RT was per-\nutes. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using\nPower SYBR Green PCR master mix and a StepOnePlus\nreal-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,\nCA). All data were normalized to GAPDH mRNA. The\nprimer sequences are summarized in Table 1.\nWound Healing Assay\nto form a monolayer. Using a 200 \u00b5L pipet tip, a scratch of\n~1-mm width was made in triplicate. The detached cells\nwere removed, and the attached cells were incubated in\nserum-free medium containing -lapachone at the indicated\nconcentrations. The scratches were monitored at regular\nintervals over a course of 0 to 24 hours, and images were\nacquired under phase-contrast microscopy (Leica, Wetzlar,\nGermany).\nInvasion Assay\nThe invasion ability of cancer cells was estimated using a BD\nBioCoat GFR matrigel invasion chamber (BD Biosciences).\nDMEM with -lapachone (10 and 100 nM) and added to the\nupper part of the transwell chamber. For the invasion assay,\nthe lower part of the transwell was filled with DMEM con-\ntaining 10% FBS as a chemoattractant. After 24 hours of\nincubation, the membrane inserts were washed twice with\nPBS and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min-\nutes. After washing twice with PBS, the fixed cells were\ntreated with 100% methanol for 20 minutes and stained with\nGiemsa stain for 15 minutes. The inner side of the chambers\nwas wiped with a cotton swab. The membrane inserts were\ndried and observed under a microscope (Leica).\nGelatin Zymography\nActivity of MMPs was assayed by gelatin zymography\nusing a zymogram buffer kit (Koma Biotech, Seoul, Korea).\nCells (5 \u00d7 105 cells) were seeded in 6-well plates and stabi-\nlized in serum-free medium overnight. After -lapachone\ntreatment for 24 hours, the conditioned medium was col-\nlected. Samples were mixed with 2\u00d7 sample buffer and\nelectrophoresed on 8% SDS-PAGE gels containing 0.1%\ngelatin. The gels were washed with renaturing buffer for 15\nminutes and incubated in developing buffer at 37\u00b0C for 24\nhours. The gel was stained with a Coomassie blue R-250\nsolution for 30 minutes and destained with destaining buffer\nfor 30 minutes. The gelatinolytic activity of MMPs was\nphotographed using a digital imaging system.\nExperimental Lung Metastasis Model\nFor experimental lung metastasis, CT26 cells were harvested\nand resuspended in PBS. Mice were intravenously inoculated\nvein. -Lapachone and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were\nadministered by intraperitoneal injection 2 hours prior to the\ninjection of the cancer cells and then injected once every 2 days.\nThe mice were sacrificed 17 days later, and the lungs were\nremoved and fixed in Bouin's solution (Sigma, St Louis, MO).\nThe increase in lung weight and the number of tumor colonies\nin the lungs were measured to evaluate tumor metastasis.\nStatistical Analyses\nData were analyzed for statistical significance using the\nStudent's t test. P values of <.05 were considered to indicate\nstatistically significant differences. The mean and standard\ndeviation (SD) were calculated for all variables.\nResults\nEffect of -Lapachone on Viability of Colon Cancer\nCells\nThe chemical structure of -lapachone is shown in Figure\n1A. To determine whether -lapachone is cytotoxic to the\nmetastatic colon cancer cells, we evaluated their cell viabil-\nity using the WST assay. Figure 1 shows that the treatment\nwith -lapachone decreased the viability of CT26 and\nMC38 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure\n1B and C). Moreover, apoptotic morphological changes\nwere detected in -lapachone-treated CT26 cells by micro-\nscopic observation (Figure 1D).\nEffect of -Lapachone on Apoptosis of CT26 Cells\nTo determine whether the inhibition of cell proliferation\nby -lapachone was due to cell apoptosis, CT26 cells were\ntreated with -lapachone (0, 1, or 10 \u00b5M) for 9 hours, and\nthe annexin V assay was conducted. As shown in Figure\n2A, -lapachone increased both early (lower right of Figure\n2A) and late (upper right of Figure 2A) apoptosis of CT26\ncells. Because -lapachone increased the annexin\nV\u00adpositive CT26 cell population, the mechanism underly-\ning -lapachone-induced apoptosis was investigated by\nwestern blot analysis. Exposure of CT26 cells to\n-lapachone (1 \u00b5M) for 0 to 9 hours or to various concen-\nhours caused cleavage of caspases-3, -8, -9, and PARP. In\naddition, -lapachone decreased the truncation of Bcl-2\nand Bcl-xL and increased the expression level of Bax in a\ntime- and dose-dependent manner in CT26 cells in an\nintrinsic pathway (Figure 2B and C).\nEffect of -Lapachone on Cell Cycle Arrest in\nTo investigate whether -lapachone induces the cell\ncycle arrest, flow cytometry was used to analyze the\nTable 1. Sequences of Real-Time Reverse Transcription\u00adPolymerase Chain Reaction Primers.\nchanges in the cell cycle. CT26 cells were treated with\nvarious concentrations of -lapachone for 24 hours, and\nits DNA content was measured. It was found that,\non treatment with a high concentration (1 \u00b5M) of\n-lapachone, the percentage of CT26 cells entering the\nS phase was decreased and the cells were blocked in the\nG0/G1 phase (Figure 3A and B). Moreover, downregu-\nlation of the mRNA expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4\nby -lapachone was also observed in CT26 cells\n(Figure 3C).\nEffect of -Lapachone on EMT Markers in\nTo determine whether -lapachone affects the expression of\nEMT markers typical for metastatic phenotypes, mRNA\nexpression of EMT-related molecules was determined. As\nshown in Figure 4, the expression of the epithelial pheno-\ntypic marker E-cadherin was increased (Figure 4A), while\nthat of the mesenchymal phenotypic markers N-cadherin,\nvimentin, -catenin, and Snail were decreased in\n-lapachone-treated CT26 cells (Figure 4B-E).\nFigure 1. -Lapachone decreases viability of metastatic murine colon carcinoma cells.

Cells were seeded at a density of 3 \u00d7 103 cells/well in 96-well\nmicroplates and then treated with various concentrations of -lapachone for 24 and 48 hours.

After 24 hours of incubation with -lapachone, photographs were acquired by\nmicroscopy. The photographs are representative of 3 independent experiments.\nEffect of -Lapachone on Migratory and Invasive\nAbility of CT26 Cells\nMigration and invasion are the fundamental features of\nmetastasis after the EMT process. Therefore, a wound\nhealing assay was performed to determine whether\n-lapachone suppresses the migration of CT26 cells. Cell\nmovements were observed 24 hours after the treatment\nwith -lapachone. In the presence of -lapachone, the cells\nshowed a decrease in collective cell migration when\nFigure 2. -Lapachone induces apoptosis through extrinsic and intrinsic signaling pathways in CT26 cells.

(B) CT26 cells were treated with -lapachone (1 \u00b5M) for 0 to 9 hours. (C) CT26 cells were treated\nwith various concentrations of -lapachone for 9 hours and subjected to western blotting with antibodies against PARP, caspase-3, -8,\n-9, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bax.\ncompared with that of the control. The control cells\nmigrated toward the scratched region in a dose-dependent\nmanner, whereas the -lapachone (10 and 100 nM) treated\ncells did not migrate (Figure 5A). The invasive ability of\nCT26 cells was measured by the matrigel invasion assay.\ninduced significant decreases in the invasion of CT26 cells.\nTo determine the molecular mechanism of the anti-inva-\nsive ability of -lapachone, mRNA expressions of MMP-\n2/9 and their inhibitor TIMP-1/2 were measured. Activities\nof MMP-2 and MMP-9 were also determined using gelatin\nzymography. -Lapachone dose-dependently inhibited the\nactivities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Figure 5C). The real-\ntime RT-PCR results showed that -lapachone treatment\nsuppressed MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions, and increased\nTIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expressions in a dose-dependent\nmanner (Figure 5D and E).\nEffect of -Lapachone on Lung Metastasis\nof CT26 Cells in an Experimental Metastasis\nModel\nThe present study also investigated whether -lapachone\ncould inhibit spontaneous lung metastasis of colon cancer\ncells in mice. Body weight, an indicator of toxicity, was not\nchanged by the injection of -lapachone (Figure 6A). As\nshown in Figure 6B and C, the number of pulmonary tumor\nnodules significantly was increased in the lungs of the mice\nintravenously injected with CT26 cells alone. However, the\nintraperitoneal injection of -lapachone (2 or 5 mg/kg) for 2\nweeks significantly decreased the formation of tumor nod-\nules by about 50% or 55%, respectively. Compared to the\ncontrol group, the -lapachone-treated mice showed signifi-\ncantly smaller tumors (Figure 6D). Additionally, we inves-\ntigated the expression of EMT markers and MMP-2/9 in\nlung tissues to determine whether the in vivo antimetastatic\neffect of -lapachone is associated with the regulation of\nEMT-related genes and MMP-2/9. -Lapachone adminis-\ntration increased the expression of E-cadherin, whereas it\ndownregulated the expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, and\nSnail (Figure 6E). Moreover, the expressions of MMP-2\nand MMP-9 were also decreased in lung tissues of the\n-lapachone-administered group (Figure 6F). These results\nare consistent with those of the in vitro experiments.\nDiscussion\nBecause lapacho has been used by South Americans since\nold times for its improvement effects against cancer and\npain caused by diseases, researchers have focused on\nFigure 3. -Lapachone induces G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest through inhibition of cyclin D1 and CDK4 expression.

In particular, it has been dem-\nonstrated that -lapachone shows a potent anticancer effect\nagainst colon cancer.25,34 However, the antimetastatic\neffects of -lapachone have not been widely studied. Only a\nfew studies have revealed that -lapachone inhibits the\nmigratory ability of HepG2 and Hep3B human hepatocarci-\nnoma cells and reduces the spleen-to-liver tumor burden in\na metastatic pancreatic cancer mouse model by inducing the\nNQO1-mediated apoptosis.32,33 In this study, we clarified\nthat -lapachone inhibits the colorectal lung metastasis by\ninducing apoptosis and reducing metastatic phenotypes\nsuch as EMT, migration, and invasion.\nCancer is a complex disease involving changes in mul-\ntiple pathways and microenvironments. In particular, can-\ncer cells that avoid cell death and continue to proliferate\nuncontrollably help in cancer progression. Apoptosis is a\nprogrammed cell death that occurs naturally in cells and can\nbe beneficial for cancer therapy.35 Therefore, anticancer\neffects of natural products and compounds caused by induc-\ntion of apoptosis have been extensively studied.24 According\nto recent studies, -lapachone can induce apoptosis in\nhuman leukemia HL-60 cells and human prostate cancer\ncells.31 It can also promote the cell cycle arrest and caspase-\nmediated apoptosis in human colon cancer cell lines, includ-\nantiproliferative effects of -lapachone were investigated in\nthe metastatic colon cancer cell lines CT26 and MC38. We\ndemonstrated that -lapachone significantly inhibited the\nproliferation of both cell lines (Figure 1B-D), and this anti-\nproliferative effect occurred through the induction of apop-\ntosis (Figure 2).\nApoptosis occurs via 2 main pathways, extrinsic and\nintrinsic. The extrinsic pathway is a death receptor-\ndependent pathway, with death ligands involved or extra-\ncellular stimulations initiated through specific death recep-\ntors. In this pathway, caspase-8 is activated by binding of\ndeath ligands to the receptors, which subsequently activates\nFigure 4. -Lapachone regulates mRNA expression levels of EMT markers. mRNA expression levels of EMT markers were analyzed\nby real-time RT-PCR after treatment of CT26 cells with -lapachone (0-100 nM) for 24 hours. (A) Epithelial marker; E-cadherin.\n(B-E) Mesenchymal markers; N-cadherin, vimentin, -catenin, and Snail. Results are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD of 3 independent\ncaspase-3 and PARP.37 The intrinsic pathway, which is a\nmitochondria-dependent pathway, is activated by several\nsignals, including DNA damage and loss of cell survival\nfactors due to various types of cell stress. This pathway is\nmaintained by balancing the activity of pro- and anti-apop-\ntotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family. Among the Bcl-2 family\nmembers, the anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and\nBcl-xL suppress Bax, which promotes apoptosis by release\nof cytochrome c, a pro-apoptotic protein. The release of\ncytochrome c from the mitochondria activates caspase-9\nand subsequently activates caspase-3.38 In the present study,\n-lapachone induced the apoptosis of CT26 cells through\nthe cleavage of caspases-3, -8, -9, and PARP. Moreover, the\nexpression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which are anti-apoptotic\nproteins, decreased, while that of the pro-apoptotic protein\nBax increased after treatment with -lapachone (Figure 2B\nand C). These results suggest that -lapachone shows a\nstrong apoptosis induction effect through inhibition of both\nextrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in CT26 cells.\nControl of cell cycle progression is considered an effec-\ntive strategy for tumor treatment. It has been reported that\n-lapachone induces cell cycle arrest in diverse cancer\ncells.31 Our data showed that -lapachone (1 \u00b5M) treatment\nfor 24 hours induced G0/G1 phase arrest of cell cycle pro-\ngression in CT26 cells (Figure 3), which indicates that the\ncell cycle arrest is one of the mechanisms of inhibition of\nCT26 cell proliferation. However, human colon cancer cells\nstages of the S phase by -lapachone (5 \u00b5M) treatment for 4\nhours.36 In other studies, it was shown that -lapachone\ninduces the S-phase blockage in human hepatoma cells\n(HepA2), and G0/G1 phase arrest in leukemia, prostate, and\nbreast cancer cells.31,39 Additionally, it was found that low\nconcentrations of another phytochemical berberine induce\nG0/G1 arrest, while higher concentrations induce G2/M\narrest in prostate cancer cells.40 Therefore, these studies\nindicate that the mechanisms of -lapachone-mediated cell\ncycle arrest is modulated by external conditions such as the\ntreatment concentration or time.\nMetastasis has been found to be accompanied by vari-\nous physiological alterations, which contribute to the deg-\nradation of ECM, as well as invasion and migration of\ntumor cells via the blood stream or lymphatic system. This\nalso includes subsequent transport of tumor cells to other\nFigure 5. -Lapachone reduces migration and invasion ability. (A) Wound healing assay.

After the incubation, images were photographed using a\nmicroscope (100\u00d7 magnification). (B) Invasion assay.

The classical cadherins (E- and\nN-cadherin) are transmembrane adhesion glycoproteins\nlinked to the actin cytoskeleton by different types of catenin\nmolecules.19 The mobility and invasive ability of cancer\ncells increase with reduction in E-cadherin expression,\nwhich is a cell-cell adhesion molecule, and increase in the\nN-cadherin expression, which is inversely associated with\nthe expression of E-cadherin. EMT regulators, including\nthe transcriptional repressor Snail and transcriptional tar-\ngets such as vimentin and -catenin, are also associated\nwith this response.41 Our results showed that -lapachone\nat noncytotoxic concentrations increased the expression of\nthe epithelial marker E-cadherin and decreased the\nexpressions of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin,\nvimentin, -catenin, and Snail (Figure 4).\nCharacteristic changes associated with EMT enable the\nmigration and invasion of cancer cells.15 Deregulated cell-\ncell or cell-matrix adhesion and increased cell migration are\npreconditions for the progression of metastatic cancer.42\nMMPs have a crucial role in the cancer cell migration and\nto degrade the ECM in a process associated with cancer\nprogression, invasion, and metastasis, whereas their inhibi-\ntors TIMP-2 and TIMP-1 regulate these activities. Thus,\nmany studies have focused on the levels of MMPs and\nTIMPs which are involved in the metastasis process.45\nBased on these observations, we investigated the effects of\n-lapachone on the invasive ability of CT26 cells. We con-\nfirmed that -lapachone could decrease the migratory and\nFigure 6. -Lapachone inhibits colorectal lung metastasis. BALB/c mice were intravenously transplanted with 1 \u00d7 105 cells of CT26\ncancer cells into the tail vein. Then, the mice were divided into 3 groups (n = 6) and subjected to intraperitoneal injection of -\nlapachone (2 or 5 mg/kg) once every 2 days until sacrifice. The control group mice were administered the same volume of DMSO.\n(A) The body weight of the mice was monitored for assessing toxicity.

Therefore,\nfurther studies are needed to elucidate other mechanisms\nfor the antiproliferative and antimetastatic effects of\n-lapachone on CRC cells.\nConclusions\nOur study demonstrated for the first time that the antimeta-\nstatic effect of -lapachone against the metastatic colon\ncancer cell line CT26 in vitro and in vivo. -Lapachone\ninhibited the lung metastasis of colon cancer cells by induc-\ning apoptosis and suppressing metastatic phenotypes such\nas EMT, migration, and invasion. These results suggest that\n-lapachone may serve as an effective therapeutic agent for\ncolorectal lung metastasis treatment. Further studies on\n-lapachone are necessary to investigate its antimetastatic\neffects and mechanisms in various cancer cell lines and\nclinical cases.\nAuthors' Note\nAuthors Jae-Young Um and Seung-Heon Hong contributed\nequally to this work.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nwork was supported by grants from the Korea Government (MSIP)\nReferences\n1.
