Every year between five and six million deaths\nworldwide are attributed to tobacco use and exposure to second\nhand smoke [1,2]. Over five million of these deaths are attributed\ni.e., people who themselves do not smoke but breathe air polluted\nby poisonous gases from those who smoke.\nDuring the twentieth century, tobacco use rose to epidemic\nproportions, mostly due to aggressive marketing by the tobacco\nindustry. Tobacco consumption is still rising globally, largely\nbecause the industry is targeting young people and women in\nmany low- and middle-income countries [4\u00ad7]. In response to the\ngrowing epidemic, the World Health Organization sponsored the\nWHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO\nFCTC) that calls on Parties to develop scientifically-based research\nevidence to assist in tobacco control efforts. Improving the global\nknowledge base is an important step to understand the\nepidemiology of smoking and in the planning, implementation\nand evaluation of appropriate interventions targeted at vulnerable\npopulations.\nFor many low-income countries, data collected over the past\ndecade through the Global Tobacco Surveillance System [8], the\nWHO STEPS program [9] and the WHO World Health Surveys\n(WHS) [10] have formed the mainstay of tobacco surveillance\nactivities. Limited but very useful information has been drawn\nfrom these surveys. For example the data have shown that tobacco\nsmoking is not equally distributed among or within countries. The\nhighest smoking rates are seen in Europe (particularly Eastern\nEurope) and the Western Pacific region, while the lowest rates are\nseen in Africa [11]. In general, men smoke more than women both\nin overall consumption and in prevalence [5], although in a few\ncountries women smoke as much as men. Examples of these\nglobally, an estimated 41% of men over the age of 15 smoked\ncompared with almost nine percent of women [12]. Furthermore,\nsmoking rates are often highest among those with the lowest levels\nof education and among the lowest income groups [13\u00ad16]. In the\npoorest populations, purchasing tobacco uses already scarce\nresources and may have important indirect effects on health. Poor\nrural households in china are reported to spend over 10% of their\ntotal household expenditures on cigarettes [17].\nWhilst tobacco surveillance activities provide useful information\nfor the implementation of tobacco control efforts, the World\nHealth Surveys provide the opportunity to examine complex\npatterns of tobacco use and to identify the social determinants of\nsmoking. The objective of this study is to assess demographic and\nsocioeconomic determinants of current smoking in low- and\nmiddle-income countries. While there are some examples of\nstudies exploring the determinants of smoking at national level\ncommon measurement system for smoking, as well as demo-\ngraphic and socioeconomic information. Such a cross-national\nexploration of the demographic and socioeconomic determinants\nof smoking can provide useful information for policy decisions,\nespecially when focusing on low- and middle-income countries,\nwhere there is a gap in knowledge caused by limited information\nsystems.\nMethods\nEthics statement\nFace-to-face interviews were used in all 48 countries. Written\nconsent was obtained in all surveys. A standard consent form\napproved by the ethics review committee was read to the\nrespondent in the respondent's language. Once the respondent\nagreed to participate in the survey, if the respondent was literate\nthe form was provided to the respondent to read over and sign and\nwas countersigned by the interviewer. If the respondent was\nilliterate and gave consent to participate, the interviewer\nconfirmed this consent and signed on the form that the respondent\nhad been read the form, had understood the study and agreed to\nparticipate. This procedure was approved by the institutional\nreview boards. The full list of collaborating partners in the 48\ncountries where the ethical procedure is reviewed and approved is\nprovided in List S1.\nStudy population\nThe World Health Survey was conducted by the World Health\nOrganization in 2002\u00ad04 to provide valid, reliable, representative\nand comparable population data on the health status of adults,\naged 18 years and older, in 70 countries from all regions of the\nworld [19]. All samples were probabilistically selected with every\nindividual being assigned a known non-zero probability of being\nselected. The samples were nationally representative except in\nChina, Comoros, Congo, Co\n^te d'Ivoire, India, and the Russian\nFederation, where the survey was carried out in geographically\nlimited regions. The response rates were reported in two steps:\nhousehold level and individual level. The response rates at the\nhousehold level were over 70% in all 48 countries except for\nIndividual level response rates varied between 82.2 and 100% for\neach country [10]. To adjust for the population distribution\nrepresented by the UN Statistical Division (http://unstats.un.org/\nunsd/default.htm) and also non-response, post-stratification cor-\nrections were made to sampling weights [20].\nThere were only a couple of high-income countries where the\ndata for smoking were gathered in the World Health Survey,\nhence the setting of this study was 48 low- and middle-income\ncountries, in which data for current smoking were available, as\nwell as the demographic and socioeconomic factors studied.\nexcluded from the analyses due to missing data on one or more\nvariables of interest. Table S1 shows the study population and final\nsample size by country.\nData\nwere divided into 4 pooled datasets according to their sex and\ncountry income group. Country income group refers to the World\nBank's development categories as of 2005 which are based on the\nper capita Gross National Incomes (GNI) from 2003 (the year the\nsurvey was carried out) [21]. Countries from upper and lower\nmiddle-income groups were combined for this analysis.\nCurrent smoking was defined as a binary variable indicating\nwhether the respondent currently smoked any tobacco product\nsuch as cigarettes, cigars or pipes. Current smokers included\nboth daily and occasional smokers. In four countries (India,\nBangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar) data were also collected on\nthe use of smokeless tobacco. For the purpose of this analysis,\nindividuals who only used smokeless tobacco were considered\nnon-smokers.\nThe following demographic and socioeconomic factors were\ncohabiting; never married and divorced, separated or widowed),\nhighest attained educational level (in 5 groups: no education, less\nthan primary, primary completed, secondary or high school\ncompleted and college completed or above), whether the\nrespondent was employed, whether the respondent lived in a\nrural or an urban area, and country of residence. Furthermore, a\nbinary variable showing whether the respondent was the main\neconomic provider for the household was also included. To\nevaluate wealth, a dichotomous hierarchical ordered probit model\nwas used to develop an index of the long-running economic status\nof households based on owning selected assets and/or using\ncertain service [22]. The index was divided into five quintiles\nwithin each country, where quintile 1 represents the poorest\nwealth quintile and quintile 5, the richest.\nMethods of analysis\nThe overall proportion of current smokers, as well as the\nproportion by each relevant demographic and socioeconomic\ndeterminant, was calculated within each of the pooled datasets.\nMultivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association\nbetween current smoking and the potential demographic and\nsocioeconomic determinants according to sex and country income\ngroup. All analyses were weighted accounting for the individual\nsurvey sample designs. Specifically, each respondent in the country\ndatasets was given a post-stratification sampling weight. This\nweight reflected each country's population, in such a way that if\nthe sample size for two given countries are the same (but the\npopulation sizes of the countries are different), more weight is\ngiven to the country with higher population when calculating the\npooled estimates. Stata11 was used in all analyses.\nResults\nanalyses. The crude weighted prevalence of smoking was higher in\nthe middle-income country group compared with the low-income\ncountry group for both men and for women. While this difference\nwas only marginal in men (over 35% of men smoked in both\ncountry income groups), the prevalence of smoking in women in\nthe middle-income country group was over double that of the low-\nincome country group (13% compared with 6%, table 1). The\nSocial Determinants of Smoking\ncrude prevalence of current smoking in each of the countries\nincluded in the analysis can be found in Table S2.\nThe prevalence of smoking was not equal in all demographic or\nsocioeconomic groups of the population. The highest rate of\nsmoking was observed in men in the lowest wealth quintiles where\nalmost one in every two men smoked (table 1). On the other hand,\nwomen in the low-income country group who were educated or\nwealthy were among the least likely to smoke. Less than 3% of\nwomen who had completed secondary or high school smoked, and\nonly 3% of women in the highest wealth quintile smoked (table 1).\nThis was strikingly different from the pattern seen in the middle-\nincome country group where more than 10% of women smoked in\nall educational groups and in all wealth quintiles (table 1).\nUnadjusted odds ratios for each of the demographic and\nsocioeconomic factor studied can be found in Table S3. It is clear\nthat prevalence of smoking varies across the 48 different countries\nin this study and that demographic and socioeconomic character-\nistics are often closely interlinked. For this reason we used\nmultivariable logistic regression to calculate odds ratios adjusted\nfor demographic and socioeconomic factors and for country of\nresidence. In the middle-income country group, the odds of\nsmoking increased with age until about 50 years old for both men\nand women after which they began to decrease. For example, men\ncompared with those aged 18\u00ad29 after controlling for factors such\nas marital status, education, employment and wealth. Similarly,\nTable 1. Weighted average prevalence of current smoking by sex and country income group according to individual demographic\nand socioeconomic factors (data from the 2002\u00ad04 World Health Surveys of 48 low- or middle-income countries).\nMiddle income* Low income*\nMale Female Male Female\nAge\nMarital Status\nEducation\nEmployment\nMain economic provider of household\nWealth\nPlace of residence\nSocial Determinants of Smoking\nlikely to smoke than their 18\u00ad29 year old counterpart (table 2).\nWhile in the middle-income country group, the odds of smoking in\nthe oldest age groups for both men and women decreased to below\nthe levels of the reference category (18\u00ad29 years), this pattern was\nmarkedly different for women in the low-income country group,\nwhere the adjusted odds ratios were highest in the oldest age\ngroups. Women ages 50\u00ad59 were over 6 times more likely to\nsmoke compared with women ages 18\u00ad29 (table 2). The pattern\nfor men in the low-income country group was more similar to the\nmiddle-income country group except the magnitude of the effect\nwas higher and although there was a reduction after age 50 years,\nthe odds of smoking was never smaller than in the reference\ncategory (table 2).\nGenerally, divorced, separated or widowed individuals were\nmore likely to smoke than married or cohabiting individuals and\nthose who had never been married (table 2). This pattern was\nobserved in all but women in the low-income country group where\nthe differences in marital status groups were not significant. The\nprotective effect of education on smoking was apparent in men\nand in women, in both middle-income and the low-income\ncountry group. Individuals with no education were generally about\n3 times more likely to smoke than those with a college education\non higher (table 2).\nSmoking also appeared to be more prevalent in those\nemployed compared with those not working for pay, and this\nwas significant after controlling for age, education and wealth in\nall settings except women of the low-income country group.\nFurthermore, women of the middle-income country group were\nmore likely to smoke if they were the main economic provider of\nthe household (table 2). The effect of wealth was not equal in men\nand women from the middle-income or the low-income country\ngroups. Examining the pattern in men, we found that the poorest\nmen were more likely to smoke even after controlling for\nimportant factors such as age or education. This was apparent in\nboth the low- and the middle-income country groups. However,\nthe effect of wealth on the likelihood of women smoking was\napparently quite different in the middle-income country group\ncompared with the low-income country group. For example,\nwomen in the poorest quintile were twice as likely to smoke\ncompared with women in the highest wealth quintile if they lived\nin a low income country. Nevertheless, if they lived in a middle\nincome country, all wealth groups had similar rates of smoking\nand the adjusted odds ratios actually showed a decreased likely\nhood of smoking in poorer quintiles although this did not reach\nstatistical significance except for quintile 2 (table 2). Finally, in the\nmiddle-income country group urban populations were more\nlikely to smoke, while in the low-income country group there was\nno effect.\nDiscussion\nThis study used pooled data from 48 countries taking part in the\nWorld Health Surveys to analyse the demographic and socioeco-\nnomic determinants of current smoking in men and in women\nliving in low- or middle-income countries. We show that smoking\nlevels are not equal in all demographic and socioeconomic groups\nof the population, and that the distribution of smoking among the\npopulation is not always the same in low- and middle-income\ncountries. In our study, some factors were fairly stable across the\nfour datasets studied: for example, individuals were more likely to\nsmoke if they had little or no education, regardless of if they were\nmale or female, or lived in a low or a middle income country.\nNevertheless, other factors, notably age and wealth, showed a\ndifferential effect on smoking by sex or country income group.\nWhile the proportion of smokers decreased after age 50 in the\nmiddle-income country group, it remained high in the older age\ngroups in the low-income country group. Furthermore, we found\nthat wealth was inversely associated with smoking in the low-\nincome country group but to a lesser extent, or not at all, in the\nmiddle-income country group.\nThese findings suggest that tobacco control initiatives in low-\nincome countries must really be targeted at all age groups. The\nlarge proportion of smokers in older age groups is worrisome\nbecause it suggests smoking cessation is uncommon in these\npopulations and older persons are especially vulnerable to adverse\nhealth conditions associated with smoking due to comorbidities\nand weakened immune systems. That smoking was strongly\nassociated with wealth in the low-income country group was not\nentirely unexpected as the association between smoking and\npoverty has been widely observed [15\u00ad17]. Nevertheless it was\nsurprising that the effect was less pronounced or absent in the\nmiddle-income country group. Our finding suggests in these\ncountries, education is a more important determinant of smoking\nthan poverty and that preventative efforts should aim at reducing\ntobacco consumption in poorly educated groups.\nIn fact education was a key determinant of smoking after\ncontrolling for age and socioeconomic factors regardless of the\ncountry-income group. Historically, in developed nations the\ntobacco epidemic began in elite and highly educated, and then\nspread to lower socioeconomic groups [23]. This trend has been\nshown to be quite different in developing countries where the more\neducated have tended to avoid smoking initiation perhaps due to\nthe accessibility of information regarding the health risks [18].\nDisparities in health behaviours are difficult to explain due to\ncomplex and competing, underlying factors. Individuals in the\nlowest education group may differ from individuals in the highest\neducation group in terms other than education, such as socio-\ncultural characteristics, family background or current living\narrangement. For example, one study concluded that a substantial\nportion of educational disparities seen in smoking rates can be\nattributable to factors shared by siblings that contribute to\nshortened educational careers [24].\nIt may seem surprising that employment was only marginally\nassociated with smoking, but this may reflect the categorization\nused in this study. For example, our reference category ``not\nworking for pay'' is made up of people seeking employment, as\nwell as those who are not seeking employment because they are\nmaintained by their spouse and work in the home. Additionally,\nwe did not consider the type of employment and some studies have\nshown a higher prevalence of smoking people with working class\njobs [15]. We also found that women in the middle-income\ncountry group who were the main economic provider of the\nhousehold showed a moderate but significant increased risk of\nsmoking. Personal economic freedom to use ones earnings to\npurchase cigarettes would be the most obvious reasoning behind\nthis association. However, it is also possible, at least in middle-\nincome countries, that the higher odds of smoking in women who\nwere the main economic provider may be linked to the idea that\ntobacco smoking in women represents independence and\nmodernity. This gender perspective may tell us why a similar\neffect was not seen in men in these middle-income countries.\nFinally, we found that residence in urban areas was related to\nincreased likelihood of smoking in the middle-income country\ngroup. Similarly, studies in high-income countries have shown that\nindividuals living in metropolitan areas are more likely to be\ncurrent smokers than rural inhabitants [25]. The lack of an effect\nfound in the low-income country group may reflect that the urban\nSocial Determinants of Smoking\nareas themselves are less developed than in middle-income\ncountries.\nOverall, whether or not a person chooses to smoke may be\ndetermined by many factors, such as socioeconomic context, working\nconditions, where one lives, availability of tobacco products, whether\none has peers or family members who smoke, or even the level of\ncultural acceptance in smoking [26]. For example, women in\nSoutheast Asia traditionally have a very low level of smoking and in\nthis area it is not a social norm for women to smoke [6]. Furthermore,\nlow education smokers are more likely to live with other smokers and\nless likely to seek assistance to quit smoking [27].\nIn this study we used pooled data from 27 middle-income\ncountries and 21 low-income countries. It is clear that the\ndistribution of smoking within each country in the pooled datasets\nmay not be identical and this variation could influence our effect\nestimates. We did not explore the interaction effects of our study's\nindependent variables within each of the countries. It should be\nnoted, however, that we did include a country variable in our\nmultivariate model in order to control for any potential\nconfounding effect related to the individual countries. Our focus\nis to provide estimates of how smoking is distributed in the low-\nincome and the middle-income country groups and what factors\nTable 2.

It is these variations across\nsettings that will provide the nuanced evidence for policy and it is\nin these settings that decision making is made difficult by the lack\nof valid and appropriately detailed information.\nIt should be noted that we defined smoking as current smokers,\nwhich included both daily and non-daily smokers. Some studies\nsuggest that non-daily smokers have distinct socio-demographic\ncharacteristics [28] and thus their inclusion could have influenced\nour estimations. However, when we restricted the analysis to daily\nsmokers the results were very similar. We included non-daily\nsmokers to be comparable with other studies and because their\nexposure to tobacco smoke still gives them an increased risk of the\nnegative health consequences associated with smoking. However,\none limitation of this study is that we did not consider the\nfrequency and intensity of smoking.\nFurthermore, we mainly considered individual level variables.\nWe did not evaluate potential contextual effects such as\nneighbourhood, although living in the most disadvantaged areas\nhas been associated with higher odds of smoking even after\ncontrolling for individual level socioeconomic factors [29]. That\nbeing said, we did find an association between current smoking\nand residence in urban areas in the middle-income country group.\nThis finding is in line with the idea that ones living environment\nmay play an important role in whether or not a person chooses to\nsmoke. Finally, we limited our analyses to the socioeconomic\nconditions of the respondent at the time of survey without\nconsidering early life conditions. One study has shown that the\nsocioeconomic conditions an individual experiences throughout\nhis/her life course may accumulate to produce increased rates of\nsmoking uptake and reduced rates of cessation [30].\nIt is possible that a selection bias may have occurred in the\nsampling process especially in countries with lower response rate,\nalthough we are not aware of evidence to suggest that this had\noccurred. The main reason for household non-response was\ninability to locate the selected households or the households\nrefusing to participate even before a roster could be obtained.\nGiven that these factors are unlikely to be associated with the\noutcome of interest for this analysis (tobacco smoking) we do not\nbelieve non-response will have influences the overall results.\nHealth levels vary across different groups of the population and\nsuch differences can be determined socially, demographically,\neconomically or geographically. When differences are preventable\nor reversible, they represent health inequity which is considered a\nsocial injustice [31\u00ad33]. Differential exposure to known risk\nfactors, such as tobacco smoke, is clearly linked to inequity as the\nburden of disease attributed to smoking is unfairly affecting the less\neducated, less wealthy parts of society. Given that effective tobacco\ncontrol initiatives do exist, this excess morbidity and mortality is\nreducible. Unless comprehensive tobacco prevention measures are\nable to reach all areas of society the gaps will only continue to\ngrow. Here we provide composite estimations of the distribution of\ntobacco smoking in low- and middle-income countries. The\nfindings will be informative for policy makers and other decision\nmakers, allowing them to tailor future policies, and target the most\nvulnerable populations.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Study population (final unweighted sample\ncount) by sex and country, World Health Survey, 2002\u00ad\nTable S2 Weighted crude prevalence of current smok-\nHealth Surveys of 48 low-or middle-income countries).\nTable S3 Bivariable analysis of the odds of current\nsmoking by sex and country income group according to\nindividual demographic and socioeconomic factors\nlow- or middle-income countries).\nList S1 List of in-country collaborating partners.\n"
