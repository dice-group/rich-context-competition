A cross-\nsectional study of 260 baccalaureate nursing students at King Saud bin-Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi\nArabia, was done using a previously validated instrument. Students' knowledge percentage mean score (PMS) on AIDS was\n72.93 \u00b1 10.67 reflecting an average level of knowledge. There were many misconceptions about how AIDS is transmitted,\nfor example, use of same toilets and bathrooms and washing clothes together (24.9%), swimming (53.7%), and coughing and\nsneezing (49.6%). Nursing students reported an overall negative attitude toward AIDS, with a PMS of 43.48 \u00b1 9.21. The\nmajority of students agreed that AIDS patients should be isolated from other patients (83%), and should not share the room\nwith other noninfected patients (81.8%), and some reported that people living with AIDS deserve what has happened to\nthem (24.7%). After controlling for confounders, students' poor knowledge and negative attitude were associated only with\nhaving never been given nursing education as their primary university education \"Stream 2 students\" (p = .012 and p = .01,\nrespectively). These findings have implications for development of teaching strategies and curricular approaches for nursing\nto address this health care issue.\n",

Al Fozan3\n Keywords\nAIDs, nursing students, Saudi, knowledge, attitude\n2 SAGE Open\nHealth education and prevention remain the main health\ncare priorities in HIV/AIDS prevention, because of HIV/\nAIDS is still a noncurable disease and developing an AIDS\nvaccine has proven extremely complex due to virus's ability\nto mutate (Buskin, Lin, Houyuan, Tianii, & Mcgough, 2002;\nPita-frenandez, Rodriguez, & Pertega, 2004; Preston, Forti,\nthat health education intervention has a positive impact on\nstudents' knowledge and attitudes toward HIV/AIDS\n(Al-Mazrou, Abouzeid, & Al-Jeffri, 2005). Several studies\nrevealed the importance of health education to reduce stigma\nrelated to HIV/AIDS (Earl & Penney, 2003; Martin &\nalthough students were knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS,\nmany do not practice what they know (Ogbuji, 2005). Study\nin Iran (2004) showed that there were misconceptions about\nthe route of transmission such as Mosquito bites 33%, public\nswimming pools (21%). and public toilets (20%). It also con-\ncluded that although the knowledge level seems to be moder-\nately high, there was intolerant attitude toward HIV/AIDS\nNursing students are being identified as a potential risk\ngroup for the HIV/AIDS infection, for that reason awareness\nregarding HIV/AIDS in this group is very important for its\nprevention (Rondahal, Innala, & Carlsson, 2003). Literature\nindicated the lack of accurate information about HIV infec-\ntion is associated with lack of confidence in caring for clients\nwith HIV/AIDS patients. Researches indicated that nursing\nstudents are frightened of AIDS patients and often unwilling\nto care for them (Petro-Nustas, Kulwicki, & Zumout, 2002).\nNursing attitudes toward HIV/AIDS patients will heavily\ninfluence their willingness to learn about and provide health\ncare for this population (Lohrmann, Valimaki, Suominen,\nMuinonen, & Dassan, 2000; O'Sullivan, Preston, & Forti,\ncient education and more knowledge about HIV/AIDS had\nmore positive attitudes and were more willing to provide\ncare for HIV/AIDS patients.\nIn countries such as Saudi Arabia, for which Islam is the\nofficial religion, compliance to Islamic rules is thought to\noffer the best protection for Muslims from AIDS. Traditional\nMuslim approaches have tended to be conservative, and it is\ndifficult to break the silence around issues of sexual behav-\niors, especially those that deviate from religious norms\n(Ersilia, 2002). Yet, the most recent estimate of the number\nof people living with HIV/AIDS in the Middle East and\nNorth Africa is about half a million (Joint United Nations\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS and World Health Organization\nUNAIDS/WHO, 2008). Nursing plays major role in the care\nfor HIV/AIDS patients. Therefore, it is very important to\nassess the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of this group.\nThis will provide a basis for a much-needed AIDS education\nfor the students in Saudi Arabia. Few previous studies were\nconducted in the Middle East region to investigate this issue\non nursing (Hassan & Wahsheh, 2011). Thus, this study\naimed (a) to assess AIDS-related knowledge, attitudes, and\nrisk perception among Saudi female students of college of\nnursing, King Saud bin-Abdulaziz University for Health\nSciences, and (b) to identify predictors of willingness to pro-\nvide care for patients with AIDS.\nStudy Design\nA cross-sectional design was applied.\nStudy Area/Setting\nThe study was conducted in College of Nursing, King Saud\nbin-Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, National\nGuard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\nStudy Participants\nThe target population of the study was the students of College\nof Nursing (CON-R), KingAbdulaziz Medical City, National\nGuard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. CON-R admits\nfemale Saudi national mainly and awards a bachelor of sci-\nence in nursing (BSN) to two educational streams. Stream 1\nhas, as its intake, secondary school graduates and follows\nwhat is known as the conventional program. Stream 2 admits\nholders of bachelor of science degrees. These students fol-\nlow what is known as the Graduate Entry Accelerated\nProgram. This program is the first of its kind in the kingdom\nof Saudi Arabia and is designed to expedite the process of\ngraduation by recognizing these students' previous learning,\nthus, helping increase market supply of nurses faster. The\ntarget sample of the study was all female students registered\nin CON-R, and willing to participate during the academic\nto the study constituted 260 students with a response rate of\nData Collection Methods\nAll students were subjected to a self-administered question-\nnaire, previously administered to both San Franciscan\n(Diclemente, Zorn, & Temoshok, 1986) and Irish (Doyle &\nConroy, 1991) adolescents, as well as the health care provid-\ners in Nigeria (Adebap, Bangbala, & Oyedirn, 2003). A pre-\nviously validated Arabic version (Abolfotouh, 1995) of this\nquestionnaire with nursing-related modifications was used.\nThis questionnaire was composed of four parts:\n1. Students' personal data such as age, origin, academic\nlevel, previous information on AIDS, and source of\nthese information.\n2. AIDS-related knowledge: This part consisted of a\ntotal 51 statements. These statements addressed five\nbasic categories: cause of AIDS (5 statements),\nAbolfotouh et al. 3\nnature (16 statements), mode of transmission\n(15 statements), treatment/control (7 statements),\nand groups at high risk (8 statements). The correct\nresponse was scored as \"1,\" and the incorrect and\n\"Don't know\" responses as \"0.\" An overall knowl-\nedge score was calculated by summing the scores for\nstatements, thus the highest possible score was 51\npoints. Percentage mean score (PMS) was estimated\nfor each category and for the overall knowledge\nscore.\n3. Attitude of nursing students toward AIDS: This part\nconsisted of a total 19 statements, these statements\naddressed three basic categories (Abolfotouh, 1995;\n& Conroy, 1991): (a) attitudes toward people living\nwith AIDS (PLWA; 10 statements), (b) attitudes\ntoward care (4 statements), and (c) attitudes toward\nprecautionary measures (5 statements). Attitude\ntoward AIDS was measured on a 4-point Likert-type\nscale, with 4 indicating strongly agree and 1 indicat-\ning strongly disagree. The 4-point scale, rather than a\n5-point scale, was used to motivate respondents to\nindicate either a positive or a negative attitude.\nApproximately one half of the statements were\nwarded negatively to avoid a response set and were\nreverse coded for data analysis. For analysis, points\n\"1\"and \"2\" were combined to form the category\n\"positive attitude,\" while points \"3\" and \"4\" were\ncombined to form the category \"negative attitude.\"\nThe instrument was piloted with 20 students for clarity and\ncomprehensiveness. Reliability measures for internal consis-\ntency were not established prior to administration of the\ninstrument; however, Cronbach's alpha was conducted fol-\nlowing data collection for the attitude scale. Obtained alpha\ncoefficients were as follows: overall instrument ( = .88), atti-\ntude to AIDS patients ( = .83), attitude to provision of care\n( = .65), and attitude to precautionary measures ( = .76).\nEthical Issues\nThe study was described and the surveys were distributed\nduring the recess, with an attached letter giving further infor-\nmation including an explanation of rights and assurance of\nanonymity. The students were informed that their decision\nregarding participation would not affect their course grades\nor their relationships with the faculty members. Only stu-\ndents who were willing to participate in the study, after being\nfully informed of the aim of the study and methodology,\nwere included in the target sample of the study Returned\ncompleted instruments constituted consent to participate.\nStudents were asked not to write their names on the question-\nnaire form so as to be anonymous. Data were treated confi-\ndentially by the primary investigator and co-investigators.\nThe study protocol received ethical approval from the Saudi\nNational Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (Ref #\nData Analysis\nData analysis was conducted using SPSS (Windows, ver-\nsion 17.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statis-\ntics such as mean, mode, median, and standard deviation\nwere applied to summarize the data. To compare between\ncategorical data, chi-square test was used. In the case of\nvariables having more than two categories, degrees of free-\ndom are given with the chi-square statistic. For comparison\nbetween numerical data, Student's t test, and analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA) were applied. To identify the significant\npredictors for knowledge and attitudes (dependent vari-\nables) of students toward AIDS and PLWA, multiple linear\nregression models were applied, with age (in years), origin\n(urban, rural groups), academic year, stream group (SI and\nSII) and previous information (yes, no) about AIDS as inde-\npendent variables. p value of <.05 was considered as the\nlevel of significance.\nResults\nPart I: Demographic Data\nThe study included 280 nursing students, all of whom were\nmaximum 30 years).

One half of the students did not know that\nthere is at present no cure for this disease condition, and the\nmajority (73%) did not know that there is no vaccine yet for\nprevention of AIDS contraction (Table 2).\nPart III: Attitudes to AIDS\nNursing students reported an overall negative attitude toward\nwas the least favorable for precautionary measures (PMS =\nfavorable for attitude to care of AIDS patients (PMS = 67.62\nWith regard to attitude to PLWA, only one third of stu-\ndents (32.3%) positively considered AIDS patients as vic-\ntims of the society, one third (39.2%) considered HIV\ncarriers as unable to rear children, and 25.4% who agreed on\ntheir right to have their diagnosis kept as a medical secret.\nOn the other hand, the majority of students (82.7%) nega-\ntively agreed not to allow seropositive women get pregnant\n(Table 3).\nWith regard to attitude to care of AIDS patients, more\nthan one half of students (55.1%) negatively agreed that\ntreating PLWAs puts health workers at high risk. Another\nhalf (46.7%) negatively reported that they would not be\nhappy to work with a colleague who was an HIV carrier.\nWith regard to attitude to precautionary measures, the\nmajority of students negatively agreed that AIDS patients\nand/or carriers be isolated from other patients (83.0%), have\ntheir care in specialized hospitals (89.6%), and not allowed\nto share a room with noninfected patients (81.8%).\nMeanwhile, those who positively disagreed to wear gloves\nwhen touching a patient with AIDS were only 15.7% of all\nstudents.

However, after adjustment for poten-\ntial confounders, higher knowledge PMS was significantly\nhaving previous information on AIDS (p = .006; Table 5).\nWith regard to attitude, PMS of attitude to PLWA was sig-\nnificantly higher in younger age (p = .015), but this associa-\ntion disappeared after adjustment for other confounders (p =\n.18). Higher PMS of attitude to provide care to patients was\nsignificantly associated with Stream 1 (p < .001), and\nyounger age (p = .007). However, association with Stream 1\nwas the only significant association that remained after\nadjusting for other confounders (p = .004). Higher PMS of\nattitude to precautionary measures was significantly associ-\nated with Stream 1 before (p = .019) and after adjustment\n(p = .038; Table 4). Higher PMS of overall attitude to AIDS\nwas significantly associated with Stream 1 (p < .001) and\nyounger age (p = .009).

These findings were\nof great concern, because it is very likely at some time nurses\nwill be caring for people with AIDS. Students in the present\nstudy were quite knowledgeable about the basic facts regard-\ning AIDS such as; its cause and nature and the ways in which\nHIV is transmitted. This finding was consistent with the\nstudies of Lohrmann et al. (2000), Peate et al.

This problem was also addressed by previous\ninvestigators such as Tavocas, Zaferani, Enzevaei, and Tajik\n(2004); Bektas and Kulakac; and Badahdah and Sayem\n(2010). Some of the Saudi nursing students were not aware\nthat there was no cure for AIDS with medication or vaccine.\nHowever, this finding was in agreement with that of Turkish\nnursing students (Bektas & Kulakac, 2007). Perhaps the stu-\ndents were not educated enough about AIDS to be able to\ndistinguish between antiretroviral therapy and a cure for\nNegative attitudes toward PLWA can interfere with the\nquality of nursing care and can cause stress to nurses and\nIn the present study, there was a substantial negative attitude\ntoward AIDS and HIV-positive patients. This finding was in\nagreement with the U.K. (Earl & Penney, 2003) and Turkish\nstudies (Bektas & Kulakac, 2007). Yet, this finding was not\nconsistent with the findings of Halpern, Rodrigue, Boggs, and\nGreene's (1993) study, where nursing students did not have\nfears of AIDS, and did not judge individuals with AIDS in a\nnegative way as stated by Lohrmann et al. (2000). In the pres-\nent study, despite relatively high levels of knowledge about\nAIDS and its modes of transmission, levels of fear about the\ndisease and prejudicial attitudes toward AIDS and AIDS\npatients remain. Levels of fear were very high as shown by\nthe students' desire to identify and quarantine AIDS patients\nin clinical and societal settings. The majority of students\nagreed that AIDS patients should be isolated from other\npatients, and should not share the room with other nonin-\nfected patients. This tendency may be motivated by the stu-\ndents' perception that AIDS is a punishment from God.\nStudies from around the world and from the EMR region\nhave shown similar attitudes (Ayranci, 2005; Kopelman,\nOne of the structural factors that has been the target of\nAIDS prevention efforts is stigma (Heijnders & Van Der\nMeij, 2006). The findings of previous studies reported that\nthe stigmatization from nursing students was the mode of\ntransmission of AIDS virus, where students were most stig-\nmatizing toward those who contracted the disease through\ninjecting drugs and sexual transmission, and least\nTable 1.

Students in the present study saw AIDS as a\npunitive consequence of a promiscuous sex life. This explains\nthe finding of a low overall attitude toward PLWA. The\nmajority of students reported that AIDS is a threat to health\nworkers and that AIDS sufferers should be considered as vic-\ntims of the society. Moreover, some of students reported that\nPLWA deserve what has happened to them.\nThe matter of choice in treating AIDS patients remains a\nknotty and sensitive issue; caregivers are often portrayed as\nfearful, ill-informed, and discriminatory in their treatment\nof AIDS patients (Uwakwe, 2000). In the present study,\nalmost all students agreed that all patients should be treated\nirrespective of their HIV status, although one half of all\nstudents agreed that treating PLWA puts health workers at\nhigh risk.\nIt is clear that many rural nursing students have had lim-\nited experience with HIV/AIDS patients, and have rarely had\nopportunities to discuss their feelings about the disease. In\naddition, students' attitudes about caring for AIDS patients\nhave not changed over the past decade (Earl & Penney,\n2003). In the present study, no significant difference was\ndetected between students of rural and those of urban origin,\nin terms of knowledge on and attitude toward the disease. In\na Turkish study, nursing students who were sexually active\nhad a significantly higher knowledge level compared with\nthose who were sexually inactive (Bektas & Kulakac, 2007).\nHowever, the Saudi population is generally known as a con-\nservative community that observes Islamic rules, irrespec-\ntive of the origin of the individual. However, previous\ninformation was a significant predictor of the overall knowl-\nedge, even after adjusting for the possible confounders.\nHowever, this was not the case for attitude. The primary\nsource of information about AIDS for students was their\nuniversity education. The second most common source was\nthe media, constituting TV and radio. This finding was simi-\nlar to that reported on Turkish nursing students (Bektas &\nIt would be a safe assumption to assert that the relation-\nship between knowledge and attitude among students would\nappear to have followed a similar pattern to that observed\nwithin the general public (Uwakwe, 2000). In Turkish study,\nas the knowledge score increased, willingness to care for\nPLWA also increased significantly (Bektas & Kulakac,\n2007). However, in the present study, knowledge score\nshowed no significant association with any of the attitude\ncategories.\nIt is important to examine whether nursing education has\nan impact on the willingness of students to care for AIDS\npatients and on potential determinants of such willingness\n(Jemmott, Jemmot III, & Cruz-Collins, 1992). While\nUwakwe (2000) reported that willingness to provide care\nwas greater among students with greater nursing education,\nothers showed that students with more undergraduate nurs-\ning education were higher in homophobia (Jemmott et al.,\n1992). In the present study, there was a significant associa-\ntion between academic year and overall knowledge score,\nwith the 1st year students showing significantly lower score,\na finding that was in agreement with the findings on Turkish\nstudents (Bektas & Kulakac, 2007), where the total knowl-\nedge score rose significantly with increasing grade. However,\nafter adjustment for all potential variables, the association\ndid not remain significant.\nThe educational preparation of nurses providing care to\npersons with AIDS has been known to affect the attitude of\nthe nurses and the effectiveness of the care provided to people\nwith AIDS (Earl & Penney, 2003). In the present study,\nStream 1 students, who received nursing education as their\nmain and only college education, showed significantly higher\nscore of attitude to care of patients with AIDS and attitude to\nprecautionary measures as well as significantly higher overall\nattitude to AIDs. Moreover, after adjusting for potential con-\nfounders, the unwillingness to care for patients with AIDS\nwas associated only with having never been taught nursing\neducation as their primary university education.\nStudy Limitations\nOur study had some limitations. First, the study was limited\nby the relatively small sample size, especially those of\nStream 2 students, for which the primary university educa-\ntion was not nursing education. Thus, it would be important\nto increase this in the future. Second, the study used a cross-\nsectional design that did not allow for the assessment of the\ntemporality of the relationship between the levels of attitude\nand knowledge on AIDS and other predictors such as age,\nacademic year, origin, and previous information. Third, the\nbackground of Stream 2 students whose primary university\neducation was not nursing education has not been investi-\ngated in terms of the reason for enrolment in nursing college\nand experience with their previous university education\nbefore enrollment in nursing college. Further studies may\nhighlight all of these issues.\nIn conclusion, and considering the sample as a whole,\nnursing students in the present study were quite knowledge-\nable about the basic facts regarding AIDS and the ways in\nwhich HIV is transmitted. The chief areas of weakness con-\ncerned misconceptions about the transmission of HIV\nthrough casual contact and exposure to saliva of infected per-\nsons. AIDS education efforts aimed at nursing students\nshould place greater emphasis on correcting these kinds of\nmisconceptions.\nGeneral attitudes toward PLWA were negative and the\nstudents' homophobia level was high. The best weapon\nagainst fear and ignorance is education. The entire curricu-\nlum must be examined to clarify how the care of individuals\nwith any infectious disease is addressed. It has been reported\nthat nursing students taking a training course about AIDS\nsignificantly increased knowledge and developed more posi-\ntive beliefs about individuals with AIDS (Carney, Werth, &\nMartin, 1999). Special emphasis should be on the value that\nsuch patients be treated humanely.\nUnwillingness to care for patients with AIDS was associ-\nated only with having never been taught nursing education as\nthe primary university education. Selection of students of\nStream 2 for whom nursing education is not the primary uni-\nversity education should be looked at. The balance between\nthe desire to increase market supply of nurses faster, to com-\npensate for shortage of nurses, and the quality of nursing\npractice in Saudi Arabia must be investigated.\nAuthors' Note\nThis study received ethical approval from the Institutional Review\nBoard of the Saudi National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbolfotouh, M.
