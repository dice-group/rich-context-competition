    "abstract": "Abstract\nConflict is a universal phenomenon that is inevitable in human interaction. Hence, it cannot be avoided in the interaction\nbetween Christianity and African Traditional Religion. Since Christianity came in contact with the traditional religion, there\nhas always been a sharp conflict between traditionalists and Christians. This bitter conflict has led to wanton destruction of\nlives and property, and this has become a source of great worry to the writers. This work investigates the conflicts existing\nbetween the two religions since the introduction of Christianity in Igbo land. It examines the nature, pattern, rationale for the\nconflicts. The method adopted by this study is qualitative and comparative. Both oral interviews and library materials were\nused. The study validates the following: There is occasional destruction of lives and property and demolition of the people's\nartifacts and groves by Christians, and this has led to reduction in the sources of income of the people, and in the tourist sites\navailable in most Igbo towns. It also led to syncretism in the people's culture. Finally, it helped in refining some obnoxious\nbeliefs and practices of the Igbo race.\n",

The Jews had no\nroom for compromise with any new ideology, which tended to\ndeviate from the Law of Moses or the traditions of the elders.\nThe conflicts continued from the beginning of Jesus ministry\nuntil it reached a climax and ultimately led to the crucifixion\nof Jesus. Immediately after his death, his disciples started to\nspeak against the attitude of the Jews toward the new religion\nand Stephen was stoned to death. In the ancient Roman\nEmpire, this also happened between Christianity and pagan\nreligion of the Romans. The Igbo society is not an exception.\nThe wanton destruction of lives and property triggered by\nthese conflicts has resulted in the topic under review. The aim\nof the study is to investigate the conflicts existing between the\ntwo religions since the introduction of Christianity in Igbo\nland, the nature, the pattern, and the rationale of the conflicts.\nThe historical origin of the Igbo is not yet certain because\nof the different views by historians and archeologists. Isichei\nthe first human inhabitants of Igbo land must have come from\nareas further north, possibly from the Niger confluence. But\nmen have been living in Igbo nation for at least 5,000 years since\nthe dawn of human history. One of the most notable facts of the\nIgbo history is its length and continuity. (p. 3)\nShe notes further that \"Igbo began to diverge from other\nrelated languages, such as Edo and Yoruba 4,600 years ago\"\nThe Igbo language of course is the language spoken in\nNigeria by people who are located predominantly in the south-\neastern part of Nigeria. The southeastern part of Nigeria con-\nsists of five states that are known as the core Igbo-speaking\nstates. They are Imo, Enugu, Ebonyi,Anambra, and Abia. Igbo\npeople can be seen in some parts of other states. The states are\nDelta, Rivers, Bayelsa, andAkwa Ibom.According to the 2006\nCensus of Nigeria, the Igbo population is estimated to be\n1University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nChukwuma O.

They occupy the area between 5.8\u00b0 north and 6.8\u00b0 east.\nLinguistically, they belong to the new Benue\u00adCongo of\nthe Niger\u00adCongo Language family. Their occupations\ninclude trading, farming, craft making among others. In the\nIgbo language, there are so many dialects, which are mutu-\nally intelligible. Nwozuzu (2008) groups the Igbo dialect\ninto eight major dialect groups:\n (i) West Niger group of dialects\n (ii) East Niger group of dialects\n (iii) East Central group of dialects\n (iv) Cross River group of dialects\n (v) Southeastern group of dialects\n (vi) Northeastern group of dialects\n(vii) Southwestern group of dialects\n(viii) Northern group of dialects.\nIgbo Religion\nIgbo religion is traditional according to Mbiti (1970), in the\nsense that it is rooted in their culture. It is received by oral\nauthority by one generation and transmitted by the same pro-\ncess to subsequent generations and, thus, has effect of being\nwidely diffused among its adherents and of deeply coloring\ntheir consciousness. It exhibits for this very traditional pecu-\nliarity highly ontological phenomena, pertaining to the ques-\ntion of existence and being. Furthermore, within the\ntraditional life, the individual is immersed in a religious par-\nticipation, which starts before birth and continues after death,\nfor the life of an Igbo man is like a religious drama, which\nvitally links the living with the ancestors and those yet to be\nborn in a mystic continuum.\nUgwu (2014) says that the Igbo who belong of course to\nthe West African subregion,\n. . . are a truly religious people of whom it can be said as it has\nbeen said about the Hindus that they eat religiously, dress\nreligiously, sin religiously . . . religion of these natives is their\nexistence and existence is their religion.\nReligion in Igbo traditional society partakes fully of all\nthe features of world traditional religion, including its beliefs,\nsacred myths, oral qualities, strong appeal to the hearts of\nadherents, high degree of ritualization, and possession of\nnumerous participatory personages such as officiating elders,\nkings, priests, and diviners. Everyone is in fact a religious\ncarrier. There are no missionary elders to propagate the reli-\ngion, and one individual does not preach his religion to\nanother as is the case with nontraditional proselytizing reli-\ngions. The objects of Igbo religion and worship in the strict\nsense according to Ejizu (2010) in http://www.culturalnorm-\nsofIgbos.religion.acare threefold: God, nonhuman spirits,\nand the ancestors. The Igbo believe in the Supreme Being,\nwho is the controller of the world and all that are in the world.\nTheir firm belief in the Supreme Being is manifest in the\nnames they give their children as Chukwuemeka (God has\ndone much), Chukwuka (God is greater), Chukwuma (God\nknows), and so forth. It is worthy of note to observe that the\nHigh God is not represented in any carved or molded form, is\nnot assigned a shrine. He is said to have his abode above the\nsky (see Phil-Eze, 2009, and http://www.culturalnormsofIg-\nbos.religion.ac).\nIn more generalized sense, this deity is believed to be\nubiquitous and invisible. He is looked upon as the fountain of\njustice. The Igbo, apart from their belief in the great God\nconceived as transcendental and incomprehensible, also\nbelieve in a pantheon of lesser deities, such as Ala (earth\ngoddess), Ufiejik (god of agriculture), Idemili (god of\nwater), Agw (god of medicine, divination, and possession),\nand so forth. The activities of these lesser deities are closely\nassociated and interwoven with the daily life of the Igbo\npeople. These deities, they believe, protect them, control\ntheir behavior and worldview. Conversely, human beings\nhave some influences over these deities. In addition to the\nabove-mentioned gods are some personalized gods such as\nChi and the Ikenga. The Igbo believe also in the cult of the\nancestors. Every Igbo man has his own personal image or\nfigure of Chi and the Ikenga (Isichei, 1976), and everyone\nreveres the ancestral spirits (referred to as Nd nna any\n[\"Our fathers\"]). The personal god, chi, is what they call the\nguardian deity deputizing for Chukwu. Arinze (1974), in the\nsame vein sees this concept of Chi as a genius or spiritual\ndouble. The essential role of Chi concept is seen in the Igbo\nproverb, which says Onye kwe, chi ya ekwe (when one says\nyes, his personal god says yes). This assertion of the Igbo\nproverb is also emphasized by Madam Nwaku Anwaegbu\n(oral interview, 2013; see the appendix for the list of inter-\nviewees and the dates interviewed), who says that Chi is a\nforce in Igbo social behavior, which is characterized by an\nattitude of man; every being is the architect of his own for-\ntune. In spite of the fact that the Igbo believe that the indi-\nvidual is the maker of his own fortune, they also believe in\npredestination, for they also agree that one's Chi refers to\none's luck, which is associated with his destiny. In other\nwords, what the person is going to be has already been preor-\ndained before he came into the world. This destiny can be\nwritten on his palm and palmists can interpret this destiny\n(Ikenga-Metuh, 1972). Again, akara aka j, that is, \"hard\nluck,\" is a common explanation for one's ill-luck in this\nworld.\nIn addition, Igbo religion makes use of Ikenga. Ikenga is\nusually owned by every adult male who has attained man-\nhood. Chief Obiora, Stephen (oral interview, 2013) notes that\nthe possession of Ikenga comes at a time when the individual\nhas obtained a measure of independence from his father and\nis able to build his own family. This Ikenga has to be cele-\nbrated, vitalized, and consecrated before it becomes effec-\ntive. In some parts of Igbo, for instance, in Nkpor in\nIdemili-North Local Government Area (LGA) of Anambra\nOkeke et al. 3\nstate, the Ikenga is spilt during the funeral celebrations of the\nowner. Commenting generally on the traditional customs of\n. . . as could be expected, associated with the indigenous religious\nbeliefs and practices of the people of Onitsha were time\nhonoured customs handed down from their ancestors. Some of\nthese customs include: the cleansing of the town of pollution and\ndesecration, the institution of slavery, human sacrifice, killing of\ntwins, taking of oath and trial by ordeal, first and second burial\nfor the dead, long mourning period for widows, and of course\nAncestor worship. The Igbo society believes in character and\nhas very strong belief in life after death. Mbiti (1970) posits\nthat when a person dies, his soul or spirit wanders around the\nbush, until his relations perform the necessary and befitting\nburial rites. The waiting stage before the incorporation of the\ndeceased into the world of the dead is called transitional\nperiod of the deceased. The ancestors, the Igbo believe,\nwield tremendous powers of blessings and power of curse.\nAfter the interment of a fulfilled elder, and after the obse-\nquies must have been completed, the family usually the\nkpala (the first male child in the family), erects a shrine and\ncreates an okposi (f like sticks) for venerating the spirit of\nthe dead through prayers and sacrifices. The Igbo, according\nto Ilogu (1974), believe that sometimes the dead ancestor\nmay reincarnate into their agnatic families. They believe that\nthe dead ancestors do not come back in their original forms;\nrather, they become especially interested in the newborn\nchild, who they say may inherit some of the ancestors' char-\nacteristics. The ancestor becomes the tutelary spirit of the\nchild and sees to the well-being of the child. The Igbo regard\nthese ancestors as the special guardians of morality and cre-\nate shrines in their honor, as well as creating symbolic refer-\nences to their existence.\nf.The Igbo believe so much in the concept of f. An\nIgbo man uses the f as a symbol of justice, righteousness,\nand truth. Not only that, f to him symbolizes fair play,\ninnocence, trust, good luck, peace, equity, sacredness, good\nmoral conduct, good leadership, accountability, and honesty.\nParrinder (1975) avers that f performs three functions in\nIgbo land, that is, social, political, and religious but the polit-\nical and religious functions are most important in that no\nserious rite or ceremony is performed without making use of\nf. What the Bible is to the Christians, f is also to the\ntraditional Igbo people. The poor and the widow take conso-\nlation in f, especially in land cases, for without the fear of\nthe f, they will be maltreated by the rich and powerful and\nfrom the name such as fbuike (f is strength), you see\nthat the Igbo regard of very highly. f has various types,\nnamely, f ala (f for mother Earth), f mnna (f for\nthe kinsmen), f z (f for titled men), f dibia (f for\ndiviners), and so forth.\nOgu.In most parts of Igbo land, ogu is closely connected\nwith f. It is also a measure of justice and fair play. Many\nIgbo clans always use f and ogu together, for example, \"eji\nm f na ogu--I have f (justice) and ogu (innocence).\"\nOgu is more of a concept than of a physical object. It symbol-\nizes innocence (Uwalaka, 1996). Ogu also serves as a peace-\nful gadget. In Igbo land, if one is quarreling with somebody,\none can give the stalk of ogirisi leaf (uboldia; a sacred plant\nthat is used as ogu) to an elder relation of that person and\nwarn him or her to keep away from him or her or to show that\nhe or she does not want his or her association. In most Igbo\nsocieties, you do not take action against someone who\noffends you without first of all sending him ogu at least three\ntimes. This is called (manye ogu), that is, sending him a note\nof warning through his relation or a close friend. Ogu creates\nan atmosphere for peaceful settlement. The ordinary ogu and\nf have psychological effect and work on the conscience of\nevery Igbo man and woman.\nAla. Igbo people hold most sacred, the Earth (Ala) on which\nthey tread and from which they draw means of sustenance\nand vital resources such as food, crops, water, and so forth.\nAla, according to Iwe (1985), is the sustainer of all lives and\nfertility. It is on land that we build our houses. It is also to this\nland that the dead go when they die and are buried. Ala is so\nsacred that anyone who commits an abomination against it\ndoes not hope to survive. This explains why ns ala (abomi-\nnation against Ala) is dreaded because it has severe repercus-\nsions. A typical example is found in Achebe's (1958) Things\nFall Apart, where Okonkwo, the protagonist, had to flee\nfrom mfa for 7 years for committing homicide, a crime\nparticularly abhorrent to the earth (Ala). Okonkwo's homi-\ncide was not premeditated, and because of that, it is a female\nch (manslaughter) for which its penalty is relatively mild.\nMr. Nwaazuru Okoronkwo (oral interview, 2013), a retired\ncivil servant whom we interviewed, on describing the great\nposition of Ala (earth deity) says that Ala is the owner of all\nmen, living and dead. She is responsible for public morality\nand offenses against the law are against Ala. They also give\ntheir children names connected with Ala, for example, Ala\nemeka--the earth has done a lot, and so forth. From the\nabove, we can see that the indigenous Igbo man still holds\ntenaciously to the cult of Ala, and the entire spirit world is\nbelieved to have its abode under the physical earth on which\nthe people live and derive their sustenance.\nThe Igbo Worldview\nIkenga-Metuh (1972) says, \". . . people's world view is defined\nas the complex of their beliefs and attitudes concerning the\nnature, structure and interaction of beings in the universe with\nparticular reference to man\" (p. 52).According toAgwaraonye\n(2014), \"Man is at the centre of African worldview and that\nevery ontological and material activity revolves around man\nand is geared towards his welfare and happiness.\" Among the\n4 SAGE Open\nIgbo, the universe is conceived as two worlds, the visible and\ninvisible. All beings belong to either of these two worlds.\nLying at the core of this worldview is the conception of hierar-\nchy of beings, which comprises five classes according to\nIkenga-Metuh, A Supreme Being--Chi ukwu (gods, earth\ngoddess), human beings (Ndiche), totem animals such as Eke\nIdemili (the sacred python), tree gods such as Akp, j, and\nso forth and physical features such as river gods and gods of\nevil forest. Parrinder (1975), in his book West African Religion,\ndiscusses the beings under four headings: The Supreme God,\nthe Sky gods, the Mother earth, and other divinities.\nIgbo traditional worldview reveals that the journey that\nman makes in a lifetime and after his death is cyclical. This\nis known as life cycle. In contrast with Christian religion,\nthere is no idea of eschatology, when all will go to eternal\nGod for judgment as Christians have it. There are only death\nand reincarnation in a cyclical manner. Igbo people believe\nin reincarnation but it is only those who lived good lives who\nare believed to be capable of coming back to human form.\nThose who lived sinful and unprofitable or purposeless lives,\nby departing from the moral code of the clan, cannot find\nhuman bodies through which they can reincarnate but instead\nare forced to live as unenviable and formless \"spirit lives,\" in\nwhich forms of existence, according to Isichei (1976), their\ndelight is mainly to harm their more fortunate members who\nled good lives.\nChristianity in Igbo Land\nChristians believe in the life on earth now and then the escha-\ntological kingdom that is yet to come. Christianity was suc-\nThomas Birth Freeman of Methodist missionary (Ukaoha,\nmissionary work in Nigeria antedated the Egba (Abeokuta\nenterprise). It arrived in Igbo land in 1857. So, with the\nadvent of Christianity in 1857, the traditional religion had a\nserious rival. At first, the problem which Christianity pre-\nsented to the traditional religion was not regarded as a seri-\nous matter by the people because conversion to Christianity\nat the initial stage was not an easy task because Christianity\nwas a new religion and something brought to Igbo nation by\nEuropean missionaries: Rev. Schon and his associates at the\nshores of the River Niger.\nThe Igbo feared that if they become Christians, their gods\nwould bring disaster to them. Diviners and medicine men\nreported that the divinities were angry because of the new\nreligion and warned that nobody should join the missionar-\nies. Others refused to embrace the new religion because they\nthought that the missionaries wanted to destroy their culture.\nDespite these reasons and threats, Christianity began to win\nconverts in Igbo land. They had village church-school teach-\ners called church agents. These agents were very active in\nmolding the attitude of the converts, especially the young,\ntoward the traditional society. Most of them, half educated\nand in many cases utterly misguided, contributed signifi-\ncantly to open disrespect for and disregard of the society's\ntime-honored customs and religious practices.\nChurches and schools were built and youths and children\nwere made to attend schools. These children were adoles-\ncents and they were campaigners for converts. This method\nof conversion conforms to Ifemesia's (1972) assertion,\nwhich runs thus: \"The Christian missionaries were the\nobject of education and religious instruction; and converting\nthe younger people into Christianity was easier, since the\nyoung were believed not to be rooted in the ancestral ideas\nand practices as their fathers\" (p. 70). At different times and\nplaces, there were face-to-face encounter with Christians\nand traditionalists, because the early Christian missionaries\nbehaved like social revolutionaries. They plunged into the\ncondemnation and eradication of traditional religion.\nTraditional music and song, drama, and dance were totally\ndenounced as bad and immoral. Statues, images, and\nemblems of remarkable artistic work and aesthetic merit\nwere wantonly destroyed by some of the overzealous con-\nverts as idols and works of the devil. The missionaries were\nnot prepared to face traditional religion. These acts set the\nstage for conflicts, which soon ensued between the Christians\nand the traditionalists.\nMethods of Data Collection and\nAnalysis\nData for this study were collected using both primary and\nsecondary sources. The primary sources include oral inter-\nviews that were collected through face-to-face interaction\nwith the interviewees, which were aimed at eliciting first-\nhand information on their knowledge of the subject matter.\nThe interview schedule specifically targeted people with rich\nknowledge of the issue under investigation. Such people\nincluded traditionalists, missionaries, scholars of church his-\ntory, and so forth. The secondary sources included, among\nothers, materials such as textbooks, journal articles, encyclo-\npedia, and Internet materials. These secondary materials\nhelped the researchers to know the state of the art and make\na qualitative analysis of the issues involved in the topic.\nThe study further adopted the qualitative descriptive and\ncomparative methods in the analysis of data so collected. The\nqualitative method enabled the researchers to make valid\ndeductions from the secondary data, whereas the compara-\ntive method helped to make counterfactual analysis of both\nthe secondary and primary data sources as they relate to the\ntraditional and Christian ethos. Concretely, the values and\nthe ritual rites of the traditional religion of the Igbo people of\nsoutheastern Nigeria were analyzed side by side with the\nChristian values and ritual rites. Consequently, the areas of\nconflicts between the traditional religion of the Igbo and\nthose of Christianity were identified. At the end, suggestions\nthat will make for healthier relationship and coexistence\nbetween the two religions were made.\nOkeke et al. 5\nConflict Areas\nJust as in the recent times, the early Christian church had\nconflicts with religions and cultures that do not share same\ndoctrines with it. In line with this view, Boer (1976) says that\nthe early Christian had bitter conflicts with the authorities\nthat arose over how precisely to confess what the church\nbelieves about the person of Jesus Christ. It is necessary to\nhave the perception of the basic concept of the word \"con-\nflict\" before exploring the extensive area of conflicts between\nAfrican Traditional Religion and Christianity. Conflict is a\nreality. It does not exist in a vacuum or up there in the blues\nbut among humans. It is unavoidable in human interaction.\nConflict has been defined variously by different scholars\nunder different ideological, historical, and cultural influ-\nences. However, Francis (2007) defines conflict as the, \"pur-\nsuit of incompatible interests and goals by different groups.\"\nYet, a more elaborate definition was given by Phil-Eze\n(2009). He posits, \"Conflict is the expression of disagree-\nment over something important to two individuals, groups,\nstates or nations when they have different views, different\ngoals, different needs and different values and they fight over\nlimited resources to address them\" (p. 393). This study\nadopts the above two definitions of conflict.\nTotem and Sacred Animals\nAfter the advent of Christianity in Igbo nation, there was no\ntown-wide conflict between traditional religion and\nChristianity. But conflicts later started creeping in from some\nconverted Christians who felt that because they had been\nconverted to Christianity, that they were no longer bound by\nthe norms of the traditional religion. They thought that they\ncould violate with impunity, the sanctions of the traditional\nreligion. These first overzealous converts started to ignore\nand to violate what the people regarded as taboos and abomi-\nnations. In some parts of Igbo nation, there are certain ani-\nmals regarded under the traditional religion as sacred and\nare, therefore, not hunted or killed for food. Such animals are\nrespected and treated kindly by the adherents of traditional\nreligion and to harm them is a serious taboo, the violation of\nwhich is regarded as ns-ala (abomination). But in\nChristianity, according to the book of Galatians, everything\ncreated by God is pure and clean. Man has dominion over\nthem, and as such, can kill and eat them. In Anambra state\n(one of the major Igbo states in Nigeria), eke (the royal\npython) is regarded as a totem and nobody can deliberately\nkill it without incurring the ostracism of the people. If an eke\nkiller is not killed by the mob, he definitely faces social\nostracism, and when he eventually dies, he will not be given\nan honorable burial under the traditional religion. What most\nearly Christians in Anambra area did was to kill the eke\nIdemili (the sacred python belonging to Idemili deity) delib-\nerately and use them as food. Not only that, they killed and\nate this totem animal, they put its head inside match boxes\nwhich when picked up and opened by the traditional reli-\ngionists, they had to offer special sacrifices to cleanse them-\nselves from the abomination because they had seen the head\nof eke (Royal python). This brought the first physical conflict\nbetween the traditional religionists and the Christians in that\npart of Igbo nation. Chinua Achebe in his novel, Things Fall\nApart also recorded the situation when Nwoye, Okonkwo's\nson, was converted. He hunted and locked up the royal\npython in his missionary box. That action of his worsened his\nalready sour relationship with his father and the people of\nUmuofia.\nEating Fishes From Sacred Streams\nAlso in some parts of Igbo land such as Njaba LGA of Imo\nstate, Udi and Nsukka areas of Enugu state, Awka, Nkpor,\nOgidi, Aguleri, an so forth, all in Anambra state, the early\nChristian converts not only went out regularly to convert\ntheir heathen neighbors to Christianity but also showed their\ncontempt for the traditional taboos: for example, eating the\nforbidden fish from certain streams in the towns. Tradition\nhad it that the fishes were not allowed to be touched or killed,\nfor they were dedicated to the god of the stream, but the\nChristian converts caught and ate them just to show that the\ngods of the stream had no powers to harm them, because God\ncreated all things for man's use. The action pained and\nannoyed the traditional worshippers. They left the converts\nto the vengeance of the gods but the gods seemed to have\ntaken no notice. The natives started to fight for the gods by\nostracizing the Christian converts.\nOsu/Ohu (Outcasts/Slaves)\nThe Igbo osu caste system is a practice of traditional religion\nand culture. Caste system also exists in Egypt, among the\nHebrews, in China, in Japan, among the Germans, and in\nRussia, Spain, and Portugal (Ndulor, 2014). It is a taboo in\nmost Igbo communities and in fact, an abomination for a free\nborn to get married an Osu/Ohu. It is also a taboo for a free\nborn (nwa af), to sleep under the same roof with an osu.\nWhen Christianity came, the missionaries condemned human\nsacrifice and outcast system. Both Osu and Ohu and other\nconverts started to worship God together in the same church,\nfor in the sight of God, all men are equal. The traditionalists\nfrowned at it but the new Christian converts did not mind\nhaving Christian fellowship with the outcasts.\nIt is important to note that the Osu caste system officially,\nhas been abolished by the Eastern House of Assembly. It is\nno longer an abomination for a free born to marry an osu/ohu\nbecause an enterprising ohu could buy back his freedom and\ncould marry into the household of his master. King Jaja of\nOpobo was a typical example. He not only bought his free-\ndom but also went ahead to found the Opobo Kingdom where\nhe became the king. But in the present-day Igbo nation, ohu,\nin some Igbo states have their freedom but for osu, it is not\n6 SAGE Open\nyet fully practiced. No wonder Mamah, Ujumadu, Okoli,\nNkwopara, and Okutu (2016) state, \"Eastern House of\ntice through an Act of Parliament, but 60 years after, this has\nnot done the required magic . . .\" According to Sir Ogbonna\nEmmanuel (oral interview, 2016), the issue of free born and\nosu led to a bloody communal clash in Alor-Uno in Nsukka\nLGA of Enugu State in 2016. Many lives and property were\nlost. \"The propagators of the crisis are all Christians,\" said\nSir Ogbonna. Members of Alor-Uno community socially and\npolitically marginalized their brothers in the name of osu\ncaste system. Even to date, most Christian converts are not\ncourageous enough to put their Christian belief into practice\nin the equality of human beings, by marrying an Osu or Ohu,\nfor they know that the person and his family will be ostra-\ncized by all his kindred, who ironically are more of Christians.\nHealth Care\nThe health condition of the natives before the arrival of the\nmissionaries was so deplorable. And, the mortality rate in\nNigeria was appalling. There was no known cure for some\ndeadly diseases, which went wild rapidly and caused a heavy\ndeath toll among the people. Besides, there was total lack of\nknowledge concerning many of these diseases (Asadu,\n2014). In Igbo nation, methods of dealing with diseases, mis-\nfortune, and suffering were marked as areas of conflict\nbetween traditional religion and Christianity. Christians were\nopposed to almost all the methods, which the traditionalists\nused when they were ill, or when they got misfortune and\nsuffering. Before the advent of Christianity, the medicine\nmen in Igbo nation acted as counselors. Some of them acted\nnot only as doctors but as listeners to people's multifarious\nproblems. They also acted as priests and prayed for their\ncommunities. But Christian doctors are unlike medicine men\nof the traditional religion of the Igbo. The villagers of the\ndifferent Igbo communities think that diseases were cured by\nthese doctors with drugs and not by any ritual ceremony as\nthey believed.\nSorcery, Magic Charms, and Witchcraft\nIn the traditional society, when something goes wrong in the\nwelfare of the individual or his family, he immediately won-\ndered who had caused it to happen. In most cases, the indi-\nvidual would suspect that someone had used evil magic,\nsorcery, or witchcraft against him or his household, animals,\nor fields. Whereas the traditional religionists hate and fear\nthese forces, Christians do not believe that sorcerers, witches,\nand charms have any effect on people or their property.\nChristians condemned magic; they use prayers and sacra-\nment to drive away dangers and difficulties. So, according to\nNze Ugwoshie Madu (oral interview, 2015), in situations\nwhere a diviner or diba (native doctor) was consulted for\nsolutions to family problem to appease the gods, Christian\nconverts in the family insisted that prayer through their\npriests would be the solution.\nModes of Worship\nHastings (1911) has defined worship as comprising all modes\nof giving expression to the various feelings toward the divine\npower, feelings of awe, reverence, obligation, depreciation,\ngratitude, hope, and others. The Igbo people, who profess\ntraditional religion, worship the Supreme Being through\nmany minor gods or divinities. Those who profess\nChristianity, worship God directly through church services,\nprayers, songs, meditation, and through other various ser-\nvices. There are shrines erected for the worship of the lesser\ngods by the traditionalists. There is no shrine for the worship\nof the Supreme God for they believe that the Supreme God is\ninvisible and that his domain is the sky and that He is also a\ntranscendent God. For this reason, they make use of the\nminor gods and ancestors called intermediaries. For\nChristians, the worship of God is effectively performed by\nthe ordained priests and their agents, the catechist, and lay\nreaders. They regard the holy saints and angels as Gods mes-\nsengers. \"This also shows that Christianity believes in inter-\nmediaries but what and who serves as the intermediary is the\nproblem,\" says Chief Raphael Ojike (oral interview, 2016).\nChristians also oppose certain aspects of traditional wor-\nship such as human sacrifice, blood sacrifice, twin killing,\nand other fetish items used in sacrifice. Based on this\nChristian belief, new converts no longer partake in tradi-\ntional family festivals and thanksgiving.
