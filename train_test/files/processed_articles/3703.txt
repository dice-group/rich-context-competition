    "abstract": "Abstract\nBuilding on the modal and amodal completion work of Kanizsa, Carman and Welch showed that\nbinocular stereo viewing of two disparate images can give rise to a percept of 3D curved,\nnonclosed illusory contours and surfaces. Here, it is shown that binocular presentation can also\ngive rise to the percept of closed curved surfaces or volumes that appear to vary smoothly across\ndiscrete depths in binocularly fused images, although in fact only two binocular disparities are\ndiscretely defined between corresponding contour elements of the inducing elements. Surfaces are\nfilled in from one depth layer's visible contours to another layer's visible contours within virtual\ncontours that are interpolated on the basis of good contour continuation between the visible\nportions of contour. These single depth contour segments are taken not to arise from surface\nedges, as in Kanizsa's or Carman and Welch's examples, but from segments of ``rim'' where the line\nof sight just grazes a surface that continues behind and beyond the rim smoothly. When there are\ntwo or more surface-propagating contour segments, the propagated surfaces can continue away\nfrom the inferred rim, merge, and then close behind the self-occluding visible surface into an\neverywhere differentiable closed surface or volume. Illusory surfaces can possess a depth and\nperceived surface curvature that is consistent with all visible contour segments, despite the\nabsence of local disparity cues at interpolated 3D surface locations far from any visible contour.\nThese demonstrations cannot be easily explained by existing models of visual processing.

By\n``volume'' is meant a 3D interpolated closed surface, including the invisible but sensed\nbackside of a visible surface (Ekroll, Sayim, & Wagemans, 2013; Ekroll, Sayim, Van Der\nHallen, & Wagemans, 2016), and including, as well, the interpolated spatial inside that it\nencloses (Tse, 1999a, 1999b). Here, I build on this tradition, by introducing a novel class of\nstereoscopic volume completion illusions that places strong constraints on the surface and\nvolume generation processes that construct our 3D world under normal viewing conditions.\nThese demonstrations raise issues that cannot be easily explained by existing models of visual\nprocessing.\nThis work builds on and extends the insights provided by the drawing of a ``Kanizsa\ntriangle'' (Kanizsa, 1955), where a flat illusory triangle appears to float above black disks\nthat are occluded by that triangle. The key point made by Kanizsa's demonstration is that\nsurfaces are interpolated on the basis of both contour cues and cues about visual occlusion\nprovided by black ``pacmen,'' which were in fact the only elements actually present in his\ndrawing. The types of examples of amodal and modal completion given in Kanizsa (1995)\nor Carman and Welch (1992) involve open surfaces that complete modally in front of\npacmen-like inducers. The visible and illusorily completed contours of these unclosed\nKanizsa-style figures correspond to an edge in the world where the surface is taken to\njust end, like the edge of a piece of paper. The new demonstrations shown here, in contrast,\ninvolve visible and illusorily completed contours that are generally inferred to arise not\nfrom edges, but instead from portions of the ``rim,'' where the line of sight is taken to just\ngraze, tangentially, a smooth or differentiable surface. Because illusory surfaces are taken\nto continue before, behind, and beyond the visible or illusory contour arising from the rim\nof the modally completing surface, they can close into a volume that encloses space. Thus,\ncurved 3D surfaces are interpolated by the visual system to vary smoothly across depths in\nbinocularly fused images, even when only two (or more) discrete binocular disparities are\ndefined between corresponding elements of the inducing image contours. These illusory\nsurfaces are generated in the 3D space inferred to lie between the two (or more)\ndisparity-defined depths, and only arise in uniform regions where there are no disparity\ncues that could define depth upon binocular fusion. Surfaces are filled in from one depth\nlayer's visible contour fragments to another layer's visible contour fragments within virtual\ncontours that are themselves interpolated on the basis of good contour continuation (i.e.,\nthe extent to which contours connect modally or amodally as a function of the degree of\ncontour geometry, curved surfaces may be interpolated to be open or closed, in which\ncase they form volumes. Such interpolated 3D surfaces may pass through visible\ncontours along the line of sight, or at some other angle. The interpolated surface\nsolution is influenced by nonlocal cues: When there are two or more surface-propagating\ncontour segments, they can merge and possess a depth and perceived surface curvature that\nis consistent with all visible contour segments, despite the absence of local disparity cues in\nregions far from any inducing contours. Indeed, because surfaces are assumed to close\nsmoothly, there are cases where the interpolated curved closed surfaces appear to lie\ncloser or farther than the nearest or farthest depth respectively implied by binocular\ndisparity cues at visible contours.\n2 i-Perception\nHistorical Background\nThe perception of 3D surfaces can arise even in the absence of binocular disparity cues. Such\nsurfaces are constructed by the observer's own visual system when viewing the Kanizsa\ntriangle drawing, for example, which inspired the binocular cases shown in Figure 1. These\ndrawings follow Carman and Welch (1992), who were the first to show stereoscopically\ndefined curved surfaces. The Kanizsa triangle or these 3D curved versions make apparent\nthat a problem arises for visual processing of object shape, completion, and depth ordering,\nwhen only some contours of an object are visible in the image, whether because of camouflage\nFigure 1. Cross-fusion of the horizontal pairs of images permits the perception of 3D curved surfaces. (For\nan uncrossed disparity version, see Figure S1.) In order to cross-fuse two horizontally displaced images, cross\nthe eyes until four rather than two images are seen, and then alter the degree to which the eyes are crossed\nuntil just three images are visible, the middle of which will appear in 3D. For example, in (A) one could cross-\nfuse either the triangle itself, or the letter ``A'' at the bottom of (A). Doing so will result in a percept in (A) of\na 3D cone opening to the right; in (B), a convex curved version of a Kanizsa triangle; and in (C), a concave\ncurved Kanizsa triangle viewed through apparent circular ``windows.''\nor occlusion, including self-occlusion. Kanizsa's triangle demonstrated that the visual system\nsolves this problem constructively by filling in missing edges and surfaces of the occluding\ntriangle in what is known as ``modal completion,'' and connects surfaces behind occluders, in\nwhat is known as ``amodal completion,'' as occurs for the black ``pacmen,'' which appear to\nbe solid disks behind the modally completed occluding triangle. The visual system thus\ninterpolates information that is not present in the image and our conscious visual\nexperience is not of information detected by early visual processes, but is rather of\ninformation constructed on the basis of earlier detected information.\nMonocular cases of 3D surface completion, modal and amodal completion, as found in\nthe Kanizsa triangle, can be made even more compelling by placing surfaces in front of or\nbehind one another using stereopsis. The perception of 3D structure on the basis of stereopsis\nwas explained by Charles Wheatstone (1838): ``. . . the mind perceives an object of three\ndimensions by means of the two dissimilar pictures projected by it on the two retinae . . .''\n(pp. 372\u00ad373). Because each eye is displaced horizontally from the other, the two eyes' views\ndiffer. The degree of horizontal disparity between corresponding points of the two images will\nvary with the depth of the objects that project those images. This discovery led to the\nstereoscope craze of the late 1800s, followed more recently by popular fads involving\nviewmasters, magic eye books, and 3D films.\nWheatstone did not consider the generation of curved surfaces under stereopsis. Some\nexamples of such curved surfaces, following the work of Carman and Welch (1992), are\nshown in Figure 1 using crossed disparities (For an uncrossed disparity version, see Figure\nS1). In the top row (A) of Figure 1, if the eyes are crossed until three rather than two or four\nillusory triangles (or letters) are seen, a 3D cone, or perhaps semicone,1 opening to the right\nappears to float above the pacmen, and the illusory contours of the constructed shape are\napparent. In the middle row (B), a convex curved triangle is seen, whereas in the bottom row\n(C), the concave curved triangle appears to be at a greater depth from the viewer than the\nblack inducers, forcing an entirely different interpretation of the scene, namely one where\nthere are three circular windows through which one sees an amodally completing concave\ntriangle. Note that for each point on the contour of the triangle of one image, there is a\nunique matching point in the other image. There are no unmatched points between the\nimages in the two eyes, and disparities vary in an analog manner along the contour of the\ninferred triangles in Figure 1.\nOther examples of disparity-defined 3D curved surfaces exploit a phenomenon called ``da\nVinci stereopsis'' (Cao & Grossberg, 2005; Nakayama & Shimojo, 1990; Wardle & Gillam,\n2013). Leonardo da Vinci considered cases where an occluder that is entirely visible to both\neyes occludes a second more distant surface. The occluded surface has regions that are only\nvisible to one eye, and each eye can see portions of the farther surface that the other eye\ncannot see. The examples in Figure 2 involve what might be called ``reverse da Vinci\nstereopsis,'' where portions of the occluding surface or contour are only visible to one eye\nor the other. (For an uncrossed disparity version, see Figure S2.) Because a\nnoncorresponding edge is only visible to one eye, there will be ``missing edges'' in the\ninterior of a figure that do not give rise to a disparity signal, because a disparity signal\nrequires corresponding features or edges that are visible to each eye. This absence of a\n``blocking boundary'' permits an occluding surface to ``propagate'' toward edges\npotentially located at different depths. In the case of Figure 2(A) and (B), the surfaces\npropagate across the occluded background to form an occluding ``cylinder'' or ``flask,''\nrespectively. (Interestingly, if one gently rotates one's head around the axis that passes\nbetween the bridge of the nose and the inion, the perceived volume appears to deform.)\nThe example shown in Figure 2(C) is of particular interest because the only surface to\n4 i-Perception\nFigure 2. Cross-fusing the horizontal pairs of images results in the perception of (A) a 3D cylinder or half-\ncylinder ambiguously either floating in front of a rectangle or attached to it, (B) a 3D flask, (C) a ``top hat'' or\n``bowler hat'' with the shape shown in (G), (D) a ``witch's hat'' with the shape shown in (H), in (E) a ``Chinese\nhat,'' and in (F) a 3D jutting ``duckbill.'' Note that (A) and (B) are constructed from two squares and two\nvertical ellipses, whereas (C) and (D) are constructed from overlapping circles. Making the boundaries of\nthose circles explicit, as in (M) and (N), blocks surface propagation and volume completion, and only two flat\ndisks are perceived, one in front of the other. Cross-fusing (J) results for many viewers in the volumetric\nperception of the ``coat-rack peg'' depicted in (I), as does (K) from a different viewing angle. Both (J) and (K)\nare made by overlapping two disks. But making the boundaries of these disks explicit as in (L) again blocks 3D\nsurface propagation between disparity-defined depths, and only one disk floating in front of another is\nperceived. For an uncrossed disparity version of this figure, see Figure S2.\nwhich propagation could take place from the unmatched front layer is toward the back layer.\nRemarkably, most observers report being able to see a volumetric shape (i.e., a closed 3D\nsurface) in the form of a ``top hat'' or ``bowler hat'' viewed from above. The flat top hat\ninterpretation is drawn in Figure 2(G), as one of the dominant 3D percepts evoked. Note,\nhowever, when the corresponding edges of the occluder are made explicit so that there are no\nunmatched edges between the two eyes' images, as in Figure 2(N), no surface propagation is\npossible between depth layers because the visible edge has explicit disparities at every\nlocation, which blocks the possibility of interpolating or propagating that surface to\ndisparity-free regions distant from and outside the boundaries imposed by the visible disk.\nThis forces contours to be interpreted as edge rather than rim. Thus, if partial occluding\ncontours are placed in front, via reverse da Vinci stereopsis, the lack of bounding contours\nat the same perceived depth permits the disparity-free uniform regions to be interpolated\nas transitioning smoothly between layers. Several other examples of this are shown in the\nrest of Figure 2. Cross-fusing Figure 2(D) leads to the volumetric perception of a ``witch's\nhat'' like that drawn in Figure 2(H). Note that in both of these ``hat'' cases, there are\nactually only two discrete depths defined by the disparity signals between two overlapping\nblack circles. Again, making contours apparent, as in Figure 2(M), blocks surface\npropagation from occurring across depths and forces a surface edge rather than rim\ninterpretation of visible contours. Figure 2(E), in turn, looks like a ``Chinese farmer's\nhat.'' Cross-fusing Figure 2(F) leads to the illusory volumetric perception of a smoothly\nprotruding ``duck bill'' even though only two depth disparities are defined in the image.\nFigure 2(J) and (K) are also constructed using just two overlapping disks. Unlike the\nreverse da Vinci stereopsis cases shown in Figure 2(C) and (D), there are no entirely\nunmatched contours in Figure 2(J) and (K). Nonetheless, there are unmatched portions\nof the occluding front circle's contour. This is sufficient to allow the inferred surface to\npropagate away from the front layer toward the back layer, creating the impression that\none is viewing a ``hat-rack peg'' from below in Figure 2(J) and above in Figure 2(K), with\nthe approximate perceived shape depicted in Figure 2(I). Making the edges of the front\nlayer of Figure 2(K) explicit, as in Figure 2(L), blocks propagation of the interpolated\nsurface between layers, and one experiences one disk occluding another rather than a peg-\nlike volume. All these cases involve smooth interpolation of surfaces into zero-disparity\nregions between just two disparity-defined contour layers. Some further cases involving\nsmooth surface completion between three or more layers are shown in Figure S10.\nModal completion examples of volume completion using crossed disparities are shown in\nFigure 3. (For an uncrossed disparity version, see Figure S3.) In Figure 3(A), the emergent\nvolume looks like a 3D ``thimble'' protruding upward and to the left, but the image pair was\nin fact constructed using just two overlapping white disks placed at different disparity-defined\nboundaries of these two disks permits the interpolation of a virtual boundary within which\nthe thimble's volume can be interpolated between real and illusory contours all taken to arise\nfrom surface rim rather than edge. In Figure 3(B), two white disks in a different arrangement\ngive rise to the percept of a 3D closed and differentiable ``peanut shell.'' And in Figure 3(C),\nthe same shape emerges but one half lies in front of and the other half lies behind the black\ndisks. Under an overlapping disks interpretation, visible contours would arise from edges.\nBut under volumetric interpretations, contours arise from the rim, permitting surfaces to\ncontinue both in front of and behind the rim to close into a volume. The completion in front\nof the rim can be thought of as modal completion and the completion behind the rim can be\nthought of as self-amodal completion because of self-occlusion. That both processes happen\ntogether in the process of volume formation suggests that the two processes may be\n6 i-Perception\ninseparable. That the interpolated surface can curve from visible or illusory rim segment to\nrim segment can lead to the paradoxical situation that the front of the interpolated volume\ncan be perceived to lie closer to the viewer than the disparity-defined depth of the rim itself,\nwhereas the presumed back of the object can seem to lie further away than the real or illusory\ncontour inferred to arise from the rim.\nThe cases shown in Figure 4(A) to (C) show crossed disparity cases of illusory volumes\nthat modally and amodally complete over one another. For an uncrossed disparity version of\nthis figure, see Figure S4. Figure 4(A) and (B) were created by placing four white disks or\nellipses on top of black disks on a white background. But because of good contour\ncontinuation and the absence of ``blocking'' contours between the visible contours placed\nat different disparity-defined depths, the visual system interpolates gourd-like volumes\nbetween the visual surface fragments. The good contour continuity relationships allow\nmore than one interpretation, and with top-down control, one can choose to see\nmore than one set of 3D shapes occluding one another. But in all 3D interpretations,\nFigure 3. Modal completion examples of 3D surface propagation among boundaries at different disparity-\ndefined depths. All figures are constructed using only two white disks, although perceived volumes are closed\ndifferentiable surfaces where image contours are taken to arise from rim rather than edges in the world.\nCross-fusion of (A) appears to be a volumetric ``thimble,'' where (B) looks like a floating peanut shell; (C) also\nlooks like a peanut shell, but one side appears to lie behind and the other in front of the depth layer\nassociated with the black disks. For an uncrossed disparity version of this figure, see Figure S3.\nthe volumes appear to conform to one another (Albert & Tse, 2000). Figure 4(D) offers a\nversion of Figure 4(C) with added cues to transparency, which gives rise to the percept of two\nillusory translucent volumes occluding one another upon binocular fusion. Further examples\nof illusory translucent volumes are shown in Figure S10.\nFigure 4. (A) to (C) involve cross-disparity cases where 3D interpolated volumes appear to occlude one\nanother. The occlusion relationships are ambiguous, and top-down visual processing can result in different\nvolumetric shapes and occlusion relationships among the interpolated volumes perceived. (D) is identical to\n(C) except that the occluding regions are now consistent with the presence of a transparent layer, allowing\nthe formation of a translucent volume. Other examples of such stereo-defined translucent interpolated\nvolumes can be seen in Figure S10. Note that in all cases, only two depth planes are defined by disparities of\nthe occluding figural subportions that occlude the ``pacmen,'' but the visual system fills in interpolated closed\n3D differentiable surfaces (volumes) between these two depth planes. For an uncrossed disparity version of\nthis figure, see Figure S4.\n8 i-Perception\nDynamic Modally Completing Volumes\nWhen contours are taken to arise from the differentiable rim rather than nondifferentiable\nedges, interpolated surfaces can continue both in front of and behind the rim to close into a\nclosed surface or volume. If static inducers are placed into relative motion, as in Movies M1\nand M2 (fast, crossed disparity), M3 and M4 (slow, crossed disparity), and M5 and M6\n(slow, uncrossed disparity), the interpolated volumes can appear to deform in 3D to\naccommodate inducer motions. The issue of dynamic volume completion and deformation\nis taken up in greater detail in the companion paper (Tse, 2017) in this special issue of i-\nPerception on amodal completion.\nClay Modeling of 3D Percepts\nIt is not clear what kind of psychophysical data the field of vision research would have\ndemanded from Gaetano Kanizsa concerning his famous Kanizsa triangle demonstration.\nIf his goal was to prove that people see an illusory triangle complete with illusory contours,\nthen in one sense, the demo itself provides compelling data because most people see a triangle\nwhere in fact there is none. Here, I faced a similar quandary, in that those who see volumes in\nthe cases presented here find these demonstrations compelling. But, at least when using the\nstereogram viewer shown in Figure 5 (Loreo Z-GL2001-VAA Deluxe 3D Stereo Print\nViewer), not all subjects were able to fuse the two images into a binocular percept. The\n3D shapes shown in Figure 1 were presented to naive subjects using the stereogram\nviewer. All subjects were run under a Dartmouth internal review board\u00adapproved protocol\nfor human visual psychophysics, and gave consent before being asked to participate. Of nine\nsubjects who viewed the images in Figure 1, five were able to perceive a curved triangle or\ncone. The others were either not able to fuse the images appropriately or reported seeing\n``triangles'' without spontaneously reporting seeing curved triangles in 3D. This is consistent\nwith data that nearly a third of subjects have stereo vision anomalies in some domain of\nas a filter in the experiment of interest to only examine subjects capable of stereopsis. These\nfive subjects, labeled A to E in Figure 6, were from a wide range of ages (A\u00adE, ages 49, 45, 16,\n15, and 10 years old, respectively). They were then given various exemplars from Figures 3(A)\nFigure 5. The stereogram viewer used for clay modeling.\nand 4(A) to (C), and were given, for each new figure, a three-ounce container of play-dough\nand were told to, as precisely as they could, model the 3D shape of the occluding white shapes\nthat were blocking the occluded black disks, using all of the play-dough given. No further\ninstructions or corrections or feedback were given.\nAs illustrated in Figure 6, the five naive modelers generally completed figures that involved\nsmooth closed surfaces that connected the volume across depths. At the bottom of Figure 6,\nthere are letters corresponding to each individual. The rows correspond to the four models\nmade by each of the five modelers. While the models are largely similar, there are differences.\nFor example, in Row 3, corresponding to Figure 4(A), Subject E reported seeing a different\n3D shape than the other subjects, and in Row 4, corresponding to Figure 4(B), Subjects A\nand B reported seeing the two figures overlap one way, whereas the other three subjects\nreported seeing them overlap the other way in 3D. These differences likely arise from the\nfact that there are several possible 3D volume percepts in each case that are all consistent with\nthe rim relationships implied by image contours, and subjects simply reported different\ninterpretations.\nDiscussion\nWhat could account for 3D surface interpolation between visible contours at two discrete\ndepths? That the surfaces are smooth implies that ``countless'' depths (with implied\ndisparities) are represented on the basis of just two discrete depths available in the image\npair. Such interpolation of smooth surfaces into regions that themselves lack disparity\ninformation must derive from the visible contour fragments and their depth information\nbecause this is the only such information available in the stimulus. But the visible contour\nfragments and their respective depths are consistent with many possible 3D interpretations.\nSo there must be internal constructive processes that give rise to the particular 3D shape\nsolutions that are perceived. But what exactly is the nature of these internal processes?\nFigure 6. Columns refer to five individual naive subjects who modeled their percepts in play-dough. Row 1:\nFigure 4(C); Row 2: Figure 3(A); Row 3: Figure 4(A); Row 4: Figure 4(B).\nSeveral ideas have been put forth regarding surface interpolation processes in both the\npsychological and computer vision fields. Some surface completion algorithms (Sarti,\nMalladi, & Sethian, 2000) have been able to account for the flat surface perceived in the\nKanizsa triangle by viewing the problem as one of minimizing surface curvature of a\nRiemannian manifold whose metric properties are constrained to meet conditions imposed\nby image contours. The first step in almost all such algorithms is to detect image contours. This\nis followed by a step of surface evolution that is attracted to edges, and which also completes\nmissing edges and surfaces among and between visible edges following a surface smoothness\nconstraint that follows from the minimization of Riemannian curvature, as would occur for a\nsoap bubble suspended between wires at the locations and depths of the image contours.\nBut in the cases considered here (for further examples see Figures S1\u00adS12), the surfaces\ninterpolated by the visual system behave very differently than soap bubbles hanging among\nwires defined by visible contours. Unlike soap bubbles, surfaces in Figures 2 to 4 appear to\npass through visible contours along the line of sight tangentially as would occur when looking at\na smooth closed surface (e.g., a potato), rather than orthogonally to it, as in the traditional\nKanizsa triangle case. That is, in the cases demonstrated here, contours are not taken to arise\nfrom edges, where surfaces just end. Instead they are taken to arise from the rim, where the line\nof sight tangentially grazes a smooth surface that continues smoothly away from the rim, in both\nforward (toward the viewer) and backward (away from the viewer) directions. Volume formation\nmay proceed because, at the rim, surfaces continue into self-occluded space and can wrap around\nand meet other such rim surfaces, in a form of self-modal and self-amodal completion.\nRather than propagate surfaces toward visible contours, other algorithms propagate\ncurved surfaces inward from visible contours. At least one such contour curvature\npropagation algorithm (Tse, 2002) depends on the availability of contour curvature\ndiscontinuities that could have arisen from a planar cut of a 3D surface, which can then\nreveal information about the 3D cross section of a volume. But the disks used in the present\ndemos do not carry any such contour curvature discontinuity information in their contours,\nso cannot be used to infer the shape of a cross section of a volume according to this algorithm\n(unless a disk is taken to arise from a frontoparallel circular cross section).\nAn alternative idea is the idea of an ``attentional shroud'' (Cavanagh, Labianca and\nKontsevich, 1995) that places a mesh among visible contours, and which can have a\ncertain rigidity among nodes of the mesh, limiting it from collapsing into a soap bubble\nsolution. But rigidity of a default surface mesh cannot easily account for the fact that\nsometimes interpolated surfaces pass through visible contours that lie tangent to the line\nof sight (i.e., at the rim), as in Figures 3 and 4, and other times are interpolated to lie\northogonal to the line of sight as in the examples shown in Figure 1 (i.e., at a surfaces\nedge). Future theoretical work will have to explain why 3D open surfaces are interpolated\nfor the examples shown in Figure 1, but why closed surfaces or volumes are interpolated for\nthe other figures here.\nWhile speculative, the idea of an attentional shroud or 3D encompassing surface or\nmanifold could in principle be realized in something like the ``grid cells'' (Moser et al.,\n2014) known to specify a coordinate system for a 3D layout. However, to date no one has\nfound or even proposed analogous ``mesh cells'' for 3D objects or surface representations of\nobjects. If such cells exist, which would lay down a 3D mesh within visible contours of\nobjects, in a manner analogous to the laying down of a grid by grid cells within visible\nborders, a possible place to look for them might be among the recently described (Yau,\nPasupathy, Brincat, & Connor, 2013) 3D surface curvature cells in visual area V4. At this\npoint, however, the existence of such cells is purely speculative.\nCertain models have made explicit that surfaces can be completed from visible contour\nfragments within and between depths. Notable among these is the Boundary Contour System/\nFeature Contour System (BCS/FCS) model of Grossberg and Mingolla (1985) and the later\nelaboration of that theory called ``FACADE theory'' (Grossberg, 1994). These models posit\n``bipole cells'' that complete contours that are adequately coaligned based on good contour\ncontinuation in the image. If that level of completion fails, then the second stage of surface\n``diffusion'' away from the completed contour does not take place. And even if it begins,\ndiffusion can get blocked by a visible boundary (Mumford & Shah, 1989; Neumann,\narise for such models in that contour continuity can occur in the image that arises when two\noccluded volumes are in fact not connected in the world, contour continuity can occur but\nsurface completion fails for other reasons, and a volume can complete even when there are no\ncontinuity in the image is neither necessary nor sufficient for amodal or modal completion.\nMore recently, some authors (e.g., Kogo, Strecha, Van Gool, & Wagemans, 2010) have\nemphasized that depth ordering is the primary problem that must be solved, followed by\nsurface completion within the contours at a given depth. But this approach still cannot\naccount for surfaces that complete smoothly behind, between, and even in front of the\ndepth planes explicitly given by image contour disparity cues, as occurs in, say, the witch's\nhat example, in part because such models treat contours in the image as having arisen from\nedges in the world, rather than from the rim. Whereas most modeling to date has focused on\ncases where contours arise from surface edges, future modeling should attempt to construct\nsurface meshes interpolated away from contours that are taken to arise from rim.\nWhether any local portion of image contour is interpreted to arise from a surface edge or\nsurface rim cannot be decided based only on local cues. The rim interpretation, where the line\nof sight is taken to tangentially graze a differentiable surface, requires that a distal portion of\nrim exists to which the surface can link as a smooth manifold that can bend as much as 180\nin space. But if one counts the self-occluded regions of the closed surfaces perceived in many\ncases considered here, the surface inferred to pass through the rim must bend through 360 in\norder to close in on itself from the far, self-occluded side.\nOne might think that any visible contour could block surface propagation. But only\ncontours that are owned by an object or layer can block propagation. Contours that\nbelong to an occluding Object X do not block surface completion from one contour\nsegment arising from inferred rim of Object Y to another such segment at a different\ndepth plane. For example, in Figure 7, made using crossed disparities (for an uncrossed\ndisparity version of this figure, see Figure S5), the contours arising from the black rings do\nnot block a volume from forming in the 3D shape of a red-hot chili pepper that passes\nthrough the rings, even though adding contours to the circles, as in the bottom row of\nFigure 7, leads to a very different percept.\nIn conclusion, the present demonstrations extend and go beyond the insights about visual\nprocessing raised by Gaetano Kanizsa's (1955) triangle figure or the open curved surfaces\nintroduced by Carman and Welch (1992). Unlike those classes of examples, the present class\nof examples makes plain the extent to which surface interpolation can involve a 3D volume\ncompletion process, not limited to the flat surfaces found in the Kanizsa triangle. In the\npresent class of demonstrations, smooth surfaces are interpolated to span two or more\ndiscrete disparity-defined depths. That two or more discrete contour fragments at discrete\ndisparities can give rise to an analog representation of a unified and closed 3D surface is\nremarkable and is a testament to the daily creativity of the constructive processes that\nunderlie everyday 3D vision (see Koenderink, 2015 for more on this theme). It must be\ngranted, however, that no existing theoretical or computer models of visual processing can\nfully account for the 3D surfaces and volumes perceived in the present demonstrations. It can\nonly be hoped that future modeling and neurophysiological research will be able to explain\nwhy these 3D surfaces are perceived rather than the many others that are also consistent with\nthe present image cues.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: The research leading to these results received funding from National Science\nSupplementary material\nSupplementary material is available for this article online.\nFigure 7. Upon cross-fusion, the percept of a red-hot chili pepper passing through rings, as in the top row,\nis eliminated if explicit contours are added to the circles, as in the bottom row. For an uncrossed-disparity\nversion of this figure, see Figure S5.\nNote\n1. Some observers report seeing the lower left corner of the interpolated cone-like object in Figure 1(A)\nas flattened, as if one had opened a conical paper coffee drip-filter while pinching down the conical\nend. This suggests that the surface curvature information from the right-hand edge fails to propagate\ninto this region, probably because there is no disparity among local cues to shape in the two eyes'\nimages.\nReferences\nAlbert, M., & Tse, P.
