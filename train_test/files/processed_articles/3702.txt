Throughout evolutionary history, human ancestors faced\nThe parasite-stress model of human personality and societal values\nadaptive problems caused by infectious diseases' negative effects on morbidity, mortality,\nand reproductive fitness. This selection history is demonstrated by the many adaptations\nthat have evolved for defenses against these negative effects. These include mechanisms\nthat detect and neutralize parasitic infection of the body (i.e., mechanisms that comprise the\nclassical immune system), and additional mechanisms--the behavioral immune system--\nthat facilitate behavioral avoidance of parasite transmission in the first place, as well as\nmechanisms that function to manage local parasitic infections. The behavioral immune\nsystem, like the classical immune system, manifests conditionally in a predictable set of\naffective and cognitive responses to local levels of parasite stress, which have additional\nimplications for cross-national variation in human behavioral dispositions (i.e., personality\ntraits) and value systems basic to important features of human social life.\nParasite Prevalence and Worldwide Variation in Human Personality\nMany behavioral dispositions have the potential to increase individuals' exposure to\ninfectious diseases. However, the fitness costs associated with contacting disease must be\nweighed against the potential fitness benefits associated with those behavioral dispositions.\nSexual behavior offers an obvious example. Compared to \"restricted\" forms of sexual\nbehavior (e.g., monogamous mating), \"unrestricted\" sexual behavior is associated with\ngreater exposure to socially transmitted diseases. But unrestricted sexual behavior can con-\nfer reproductive benefits as well (Thornhill and Gangestad, 2008). Consequently, there are\nadaptive advantages associated with context-dependent phenotypic plasticity in the domain\nof sexual behavior, with a more restricted approach to mating occurring under ecological\nconditions in which the threat of parasite transmission is greater, and a more unrestricted\napproach occurring when the threat of parasite transmission is reduced. Worldwide data on\nhuman populations support this hypothesis: in countries with a higher prevalence of\ninfectious diseases, people report a dispositional tendency toward greater sexual restricted-\nness, and these cultures are defined also by more conservative and traditional values, both\nsexual and otherwise (Schaller and Murray, 2008; Thornhill, Fincher, and Aran, 2009).\nThis cross-national positive relationship between prevalence of infectious disease and\nsexual restrictiveness is stronger for women than for men.\nThis same logic applies to other human behavioral tendencies. A dispositional tenden-\ncy toward gregariousness with a diversity of people and extraversion is associated with\nspecific kinds of interpersonal benefits--e.g., larger social networks, including mating\npools--but also implies greater exposure to infectious diseases (Nettle, 2005). To the extent\nthat there evolved a capacity for contingent plasticity in dispositional tendencies toward\nextraversion, it follows that human populations are likely to be characterized by extraver-\nsion primarily under ecological conditions of low parasite prevalence, whereas a more\nintroverted personality style is more likely to emerge when the prevalence of parasites is\nhigh. This prediction has been supported by cross-national data describing the personality\ntraits of tens of thousands of people in dozens of countries worldwide (Schaller and\nSimilarly, specific kinds of fitness benefits may accrue to individuals who are curious,\nadventurous, and generally \"open\" to unfamiliar experiences and new ideas. For several\nreasons, however, dispositional openness also may be associated with increased risk of\nparasite transmission. Individuals who are curious and adventurous may be more likely to\nviolate rituals and norms (such as those pertaining to hygiene and food preparation; e.g.,\nThe parasite-stress model of human personality and societal values\nSherman and Billing, 1999) that serve as buffers against contact with local parasites. In\naddition, dispositional openness, in ways similar to extraversion, is associated with increas-\ned contact with out-group members and other unfamiliar peoples who may be hosts to\nnovel parasites to which the immune defenses of one's self, one's family, and one's fellow\ngroup members are not adapted. Host\u00adparasite coevolutionary races are localized on a\ngeographical scale. Thus, defenses of both the classical and behavioral immune systems are\nmost suited to local infectious diseases, but not those outside one's in-group or typical\nsocial milieu (Fincher and Thornhill, 2008; also, Tanaka, Kumm, and Feldman, 2002). In\nshort, neophobia reduces risk of parasite-based morbidity and mortality, whereas neophilia\nincreases risk of contracting infectious diseases. To the extent that there is contingent\nplasticity in dispositional tendencies toward openness, it follows that human populations\nare expected to have higher levels of dispositional openness (neophilia) within ecologies\ncharacterized by low parasite prevalence, and will have lower levels of openness\n(neophobia) within ecologies characterized by higher prevalence of parasites. Empirical\nevidence across many countries of the world also supports this prediction (Schaller and\nParasite Prevalence and Worldwide Variation in Societal Values\nThe prevalence of parasites in the local ecology not only has implications for human\npersonality, but also--perhaps more profoundly--for the cultural value systems and\npolitical ideologies that define human societies.\nTo the extent that value systems encourage adherence to existing traditions and norms,\nand place constraints on individuals' inclinations to deviate from those norms through\nunwillingness to accept new ideas and ways that arise within or outside the group, these\nvalue systems provide a buffer against parasite transmission. To the extent that value\nsystems encourage xenophobic responses to unfamiliar peoples, these value systems limit\nexposure to novel parasites harbored by out-groups (Fincher, Thornhill, Murray, and\nSchaller, 2008; Navarrete and Fessler, 2006). To the extent that value systems encourage\nphilopatry, and impose limits on the dispersal from natal locales, they also limit exposure to\nnovel parasites (Fincher et al., 2008). The relative benefits of these value systems--as\nopposed to value systems encouraging individualism, dispersal, innovation and\nxenophilia--would be especially great under ecological conditions in which infectious\nparasites are especially prevalent. The implication is that these value systems, and their\nmanifest behavioral patterns, are likely to be especially common in populations character-\nized by a high prevalence of infectious diseases. This prediction has been supported\nempirically across multiple studies, using a variety of empirical indicators of social values.\nOne study focused specifically on dispersal. Across a large sample of traditional societies\nin the ethnographic record, geographic dispersal (measured as home range size) was related\nnegatively with parasite prevalence (Fincher and Thornhill, 2008). Another study examined\nmultiple measures of \"collectivism\" and \"individualism.\" Collectivistic value systems are\ndefined, in part, by ethnocentric attitudes, adherence to existing traditions, behavioral con-\nformity, and neophobia; individualistic values are defined by higher levels of intergroup\ncontact, encouragement of innovation, tolerance for idiosyncratic behavior, and neophilia\n(Gelfand, Bhawuk, Nishii, and Bechtold, 2004; Triandis, 1995). Across a worldwide\nsample of contemporary countries, parasite prevalence was strongly, negatively associated\nwith two different measures of individualism, and strongly, positively associated with two\nThe parasite-stress model of human personality and societal values\nadditional measures of collectivism (Fincher et al., 2008).\nThese effects generalize to political ideologies and associated political systems as\nwell. Autocracy, the antipole of democracy, arises, in part, from societal values promoting\nwidespread obedience to authority, conformity and neophobia. In contrast, democratic\nideologies and political structures are associated with more individualistic value systems\nand the specific behaviors associated with them (e.g., greater trust of, altruism toward, and\ninteraction with out-groups) (Thornhill et al., 2009). According to the parasite-stress model,\nvariation among contemporary nations' political structures is therefore expected to corres-\npond to ecological variation in parasite prevalence. Recent evidence indicates that this is\nso. In analyses involving most of the world's countries, parasite prevalence was inversely\ncorrelated with four different measures of democratization (Thornhill et al., 2009).\nFor similar reasons, parasite prevalence also is expected to predict other forms of\npolitical liberalism. For example, democratization is accompanied by the liberation of\nwomen from the tradition of masculine social control, which manifests in an increase in\nwomen's civil rights and political representation (Inglehart, 2003; Wejnert, 2005; Welzel,\n2007). It follows from the parasite-stress model that this form of liberalism should be more\npronounced within populations that have a relatively low prevalence of parasites. It is.\nAcross many countries of the world, parasite prevalence correlates negatively with national\nindicators of gender equality (Gangestad, Haselton, and Buss, 2006; Thornhill et al., 2009).\nRobustness of these Cross-national Relationships\nThese empirical findings provide provocative and wide-ranging support for the\nparasite-stress model of human sociality. Furthermore, additional findings have largely\nruled out alternative explanations for these significant relationships between parasite\nprevalence and cross-national differences in personality and values.\nFor example, previous research has assessed and statistically controlled for a wide\nvariety of potential confounding variables. These include variables pertaining to economic\ndevelopment (e.g., gross domestic product per capita, income inequity), climate (e.g., mean\nannual temperature), social demographics (e.g., population density), and non-disease-\nrelated threats to human welfare. The predictive effects of parasite prevalence have\npersisted even when these variables are controlled, thus rendering many potential\nalternative explanations untenable (for details, see Fincher et al., 2008; Fincher and\nAdditional analyses have addressed the possibility that the magnitude and/or\nsignificance of the cross-national results might be artificially inflated by statistical non-\nindependence. Although a considerable amount of cross-cultural research indicates that\ngeopolitical boundaries (i.e., national borders) can serve as useful proxies for cultural\nboundaries (e.g., Schwartz, 2004), it can be argued that the personality styles and societal\nnorms of geographically proximal nations may not be truly independent--that they may be\ndescriptively similar not merely because of similar ecologies, but also because of shared\nRoss and Homer, 1976). One way to test whether there is a predictive relationship between\nparasite prevalence and cultural outcomes, and to assure that this relationship is not merely\nan artifact of statistical non-independence, is to compute parasite-prevalence, personality\ntraits, and societal value scores for larger culturally-distinct world regions (e.g., the six\nworld cultural regions identified by Murdock, 1949), and to treat those cultural regions\nThe parasite-stress model of human personality and societal values\n(rather than nations) as the unit of statistical analysis. Fincher et al. (2008) reported exactly\nsuch analyses, and found that parasite prevalence still predicted cultural differences in\nindividualism and collectivism. Although not previously reported, analogous analyses have\nbeen done on the other trait and value variables too, and in all cases these world-region\nanalyses have produced results replicating the nation-level effects. For example, in analyses\ntreating Murdock's six world regions as the unit of analysis, the mean historical prevalence\nof parasites within a region (computed from nation-level scores reported by Murray and\nSchaller, 2010) strongly predicts mean contemporary levels of extraversion, openness, and\ndemocratization (rs exceed -0.75 in magnitude, ps < 0.05, one-tailed). These results are\ninconsistent with any alternative explanation based on statistical non-independence of\nnation-level data.\nThe implication is that national differences in personality and values are predicted by\nparasite prevalence, and that these relations cannot easily be attributed to alternative causal\nexplanations. Nevertheless, some additional conceptual and empirical limitations remain\nunaddressed by previous research.\nZoonotic Versus Non-Zoonotic Diseases as Differential Predictors of Human Variation\nOne limitation results from the fact that these previous investigations employed\nrelatively crude measures of pathogen prevalence. One measure (employed by Fincher et\nal., 2008, and Schaller and Murray, 2008) estimated overall parasite prevalence (number of\ncases of disease) on the basis of data pertaining to a diverse set of nine human infectious\ndiseases represented in epidemiological atlases that refer back to the early 1900s. A second\nmeasure (employed by Fincher et al., 2008, and Thornhill et al., 2009) estimated overall\nparasite prevalence (number of cases) on the basis of data pertaining to a diverse set of 22\nhuman infectious diseases, obtained in 2007 from an online database of contemporary\nhuman infectious diseases (GIDEON, see below). Statistical analyses attest to the reliability\nand validity of these measures (e.g., Fincher et al., 2008; Murray and Schaller, 2010;\nThornhill et al., 2009), but these measures are only indicators of overall parasite\nprevalence. These measures fail to discriminate between conceptually distinct categories of\nparasites defined by different modes of transmission.\nParasitologists and epidemiologists classify human diseases into three distinct cate-\ngories based on their modes of transmission: zoonotic, multihost, and human-specific\n(Smith, Sax, Gaines, Guenier, and Gu\u00e9gan, 2007). Zoonotic parasites develop and\nreproduce entirely in non-human hosts (e.g., livestock, wildlife) and can infect humans as\nwell, but are not transmitted directly from human to human. Multihost parasites can use\nboth non-human and human hosts to complete their life cycle, and may be transmitted\ndirectly from human to human as well as through inter-species transmission. Human-\nspecific parasites are transmitted only from human to human (although ancestrally they\noften have had a zoonotic transmission origin; see Pearce-Duvet, 2006).\nThese categorical distinctions matter in the present theoretical context. The cross-\nnational differences discussed above--differences in personality traits and societal\nvalues--are predicted by a parasite-stress model of human sociality that emphasizes\nespecially the potential infection risks associated with interactions with conspecifics. The\nrisks associated with unrestricted sociosexuality and extraversion, for instance, refer\nspecifically to the risk of human-to-human transmission. The infection risks associated with\nopenness are not quite so specific, but many of the specific forms of behavior associated\nThe parasite-stress model of human personality and societal values\nwith openness (e.g., increased contact with out-group members) do imply a higher risk of\nhuman-to-human transmission. The same logic applies to the societal value dimensions of\nindividualism and collectivism (given that collectivism is defined, in part, by ethnocentrism\nand philopatry) as well as to democratization and liberalism in general (given that socially\nand politically liberal attitudes are also defined, in part, by a greater tolerance for, liking of,\nand contact with unfamiliar peoples).\nThe implication is clear. According to the parasite-stress model of human sociality,\nworldwide differences in the domains of human personality and societal values are unlikely\nto correlate with the presence of zoonotic parasites (which cannot be transmitted from\nhuman to human), but should correlate strongly with the presence of non-zoonotic parasites\n(which have the capacity for human-to-human transmission). Empirical evidence consistent\nwith this prediction would provide unique and novel support for the parasite-stress model\nof human sociality.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe unit of analysis used throughout the current investigation is that of a geopolitical\nregion. In most cases, these regions are nations. In some cases, these regions are geograph-\nically separate colonies or territories (e.g., Guam), or culturally distinct regions within a\ncountry (e.g., Hong Kong). For the sake of expository efficiency, the term \"country\" will\nhereafter refer to all units of analysis.\nGiven that previous results (described above) have shown already that parasite\nprevalence predicts cultural outcomes regardless of whether country or broader cultural\nregion is treated as the unit of analysis, we do not report cultural-region-level analyses here.\nFurthermore, our objective is to test whether these previously documented effects are\ndifferentially predicted from the prevalence of zoonotic versus non-zoonotic parasites. This\nobjective requires analyses with sufficient statistical power to test for differential effects.\nNation-level analyses satisfy this requirement; world-region-level analyses do not.\nThree Indices of Parasite Richness: Zoonotic, Multihost, Human-Specific\nFor each of 227 countries, we computed three indices of parasite richness, based on\nthe presence or absence of every human infectious disease cataloged in the GIDEON data-\nbase. GIDEON is a frequently updated, subscription-based online database of human\ninfectious diseases available to the medical community and researchers. GIDEON data\nhave been used extensively in prior research on the global distribution of infectious dis-\neases (e.g., Guernier, Hochberg, and Guegan, 2004; Smith et al., 2007; Thornhill et al.,\nWe classified each human infectious disease as either zoonotic, multihost, or human-\nspecific, according to Smith et al.'s (2007) classification scheme, with updates based on\nmore recent epidemiological information in GIDEON and in other sources. These updates\nare as follows. Ten new diseases have been added to the GIDEON database since Smith et\nal. was published. Thirty-five diseases have changed names since Smith et al.'s paper. Four\ndiseases were reclassified by us, because of error by Smith et al. and/or recent information\nabout transmission provided by GIDEON or other sources. Data on the number of each of\nthe three disease types per country are available from the corresponding author upon\nrequest. This classification has 154 diseases as zoonotic (e.g., rabies, plague, hantavirus),\nThe parasite-stress model of human personality and societal values\n40 diseases as multihost (e.g., leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, Dengue fever), and 117\ndiseases as human-specific (e.g., measles, cholera, filariasis). For each country, we com-\nputed separately the sums of all zoonotic diseases, multihost diseases, and human-specific\ndiseases that GIDEON listed as having a presence within that country. These three sums\nrepresented three distinct indices of parasite richness. Across all countries, the mean\nThese parasite indices do not distinguish between certain aspects of disease trans-\nmission--e.g., vector-borne vs. those that require direct contact--nor need they. Whether a\ndisease transmitted between people is carried through the air by way of a mosquito or by\nexpelled mucus droplets is not relevant to our main hypothesis about differences between\nnonzoonotic and zoonotic influences. Similarly, the taxon of the disease--e.g., fungi, viral,\nhelminth, etc.--is not relevant to this hypothesis.\nWe should note that these measures of parasite richness are only indirect measures of\nthe severity of stress that parasites impose on human populations. Nevertheless, there is\nabundant evidence that parasite richness covaries substantially with parasite severity\n(Fincher et al., 2009; Fincher and Thornhill, 2008); consequently, these measures of\nparasite richness can be used to test hypotheses derived from the parasite-stress model of\nhuman sociality.\nMeasures of Human Personality Traits\nFemale Sociosexual Orientation. The Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI;\nSimpson and Gangestad, 1991) is a self-report instrument commonly used to assess a\nbehavioral disposition toward unrestricted sexuality (e.g., willingness to engage in sexual\nrelations in the absence of a long-term commitment). Based on data collected from 14,059\nadults worldwide, Schmitt (2005) reported sex-specific mean SOI scores for nearly 50\ncountries. Using this data, Schaller and Murray (2008) found that parasite prevalence\npredicted both male and female mean SOI scores, although only the relation with female\nSOI scores remained statistically significant after controlling for additional variables (also\nsee similar results in Thornhill et al., 2009). Consequently, our analyses here focus\nexclusively on mean female SOI (high SOI scores indicate a more unrestricted approach to\nsexual behavior).\nExtraversion. The NEO-PI-R questionnaire is the most widely employed and well-\nvalidated instrument available for assessing the five fundamental trait dimensions that\naccount for most of the variability in human personality (see McCrae, 2002). Extraversion\nis one of these dimensions. Two different investigations have employed the NEO-PI-R\nquestionnaire to assess and describe worldwide differences in extraversion. McCrae (2002)\nsummarized results from several dozen independent investigations that used the NEO-PI-R\nquestionnaire to assess the self-reported personality traits in about 30 different countries.\nSeparately, McCrae et al. (2005) used the NEO-PI-R questionnaire and an observer-report\nmethodology to assess the personality traits of 11,985 individuals living in about 50\ndifferent countries. Both investigations produced average extraversion scores for each\ncountry included in their analyses. Schaller and Murray (2008) found that parasite\nprevalence significantly and negatively predicted both measures of extraversion.\nOpenness to Experience.Openness to experience is also one of the five fundamental\nThe parasite-stress model of human personality and societal values\ntrait dimensions assessed by the NEO-PI-R questionnaire. McCrae (2002) and McCrae et\nal. (2005) reported mean openness scores for each country included in their analyses.\nSchaller and Murray (2008) found that parasite prevalence significantly and negatively\npredicted measures of openness from both studies.\nMeasures of Societal Values\nIndividualistic and Collectivistic Values. The values unidimension of\nindividualism/collectivism has been a major research focus in cross-cultural psychology, as\nit is widely felt to describe important cultural differences across countries of the world\n(e.g., Gelfand et al., 2004). Fincher et al. (2008) reported significant correlations between\nparasite prevalence and four different numerical indicators of the extent to which a country\nis characterized by collectivistic or individualistic values. Two different (but highly\noverlapping) measures of individualism were taken from Hofstede (2001) and Suh, Diener,\nOishi, and Triandis (1998); two different (but highly overlapping) measures of collectivism\nwere taken from Gelfand et al. (2004) and Kashima and Kashima (1998). (A complete\ndescription of these measures can be found in Fincher et al., 2008.) As an additional\nindicator of collectivistic values, we conducted analyses on the strength of \"family ties\"\nwithin each country--measured as a numerical composite variable of multiple self-report\nitems included in the World Values Survey. Allegiance to extended family is a defining\nfeature of collectivistic value systems (Alesina and Giuliano, 2007; Gelfand et al., 2004),\nand the family ties variable correlates very highly with other measures of individual-\nism/collectivism (for evidence and further discussion, see Thornhill et al., 2009). See Table\n2 for sample sizes (number of countries) associated with the five value systems of\nindividualism/collectivism.\nDemocratization.Thornhill et al. (2009) reported significant correlations between\npathogen prevalence and four measures commonly employed by scholars to describe the\nnature of political systems across the globe. Two measures were developed by Vanhanen\n(2003) on the basis of quantifiable data. One is Vanhanen's Index of Democracy, which\nreflects the extent to which people in a country participate in elections, as well as the extent\nto which there exists opportunities allowing competition for political power and opposition\nto heads of states. Vanhanen's other measure, the Resource Distribution index, assesses the\nmean level to which five valuable resources (e.g., money, property ownership, educational\nopportunities) are distributed widely and equitably across the people in the country.\nVanhanen's two indices are highly positively correlated. Both indices are scored such that\nhigher values reflect higher levels of democratization within a country. Two additional\nmeasures of democratization assess the extent to which people of a country have various\npolitical rights and civil liberties, and are based on subjective judgments of political\nscientists, legal scholars and other experts. The Human Freedom Index, obtained from the\nWorld Christian Encyclopedia (Barrett, Kurian, and Johnson, 2001), offers a composite\nscore of several variables related to political rights and civil liberties. Higher scores\ncorrespond to greater levels of individual freedom. The organization Freedom House\n(www.freedomhouse.org) provides two ratings reflecting restrictions on individual\nfreedoms--one rating assessing restrictions on political rights, and another rating assessing\nrestrictions on civil liberties (see Karatnycky, 1998 for a discussion of rating methods). The\ntwo Freedom House ratings are highly correlated (r = 0.94). Higher ratings correspond to\nhigher restrictions. Therefore, for our analyses, we summed the Freedom House ratings into\nThe parasite-stress model of human personality and societal values\na single index reflecting restrictions on democratization rights.\nWe also included a fifth measure of democratization not presented in prior analyses.\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU; www.eiu.com) computed a cross-national\nDemocracy Index based on 60 indicators assessing five defining components of democrat-\nization (electoral process and political pluralism, civil liberties, the functioning of the\ngovernment, political participation, and political culture). We employed the EIU\nDemocracy Index for 2008; higher scores reflect higher levels of democratization. See\nTable 3 for sample sizes associated with the democratization variables.\nGender Equality.An index of gender equality for 93 countries is provided by the\nGender Empowerment Measure, reported in the United Nations Human Development\nReport (http://hdrstats.undp.org/indicators/280) in 2007. This index provides a composite\nmeasure of gender equality in political and economic participation, and in power over\neconomic resources. High scores indicate higher levels of gender equality within a country.\nThornhill et al. (2009) found that this measure of gender equality correlated positively with\ndemocratization and correlated negatively with both collectivism and parasite prevalence\nResults\nFor each outcome variable, we computed correlations (Pearson rs) with each of the\nthree parasite-richness indices (zoonotics and each of the two non-zoonotic indices). In\naddition, because the three indices of parasite richness were positively intercorrelated (rs\nranged from 0.56 to 0.66), we conducted additional regression analyses to more rigorously\nassess the unique predictive effects associated with each index.\nCorrelations Between Parasite Richness Indices and Personality Traits\nFemale Sociosexual Orientation. Across 45 countries, female SOI was correlated\nnegatively with indices of both human-specific parasite richness (r = -0.38, p = 0.01) and\nmultihost parasite richness (r = -0.47, p < 0.001). The relation with zoonotic parasite\nrichness was negligible and non-significant (r = -0.12, p = 0.44). When all three parasite-\nrichness indices were entered simultaneously as predictors of female SOI in a follow-up\nregression analysis, only the multihost index remained a statistically significant predictor (p\nExtraversion. Table 1 reports correlations between each parasite richness index and\nthe two measures of extraversion. A clear pattern is evident: extraversion was predicted\nmost strongly by human-specific parasite richness, somewhat less strongly by multihost\nparasite richness, and least strongly by zoonotic parasite richness. In follow-up regression\nanalyses that included all three parasite-richness indices as simultaneous predictors of each\nextraversion measure, only the human-specific indices remained a statistically significant\npredictor (for the McCrae, 2002, and McCrae et al., 2005 measures of extraversion, ps =\n0.02 and 0.001, respectively). There were negligible unique effects associated with the\nother two indices (ps > 0.18).\nOpenness to Experience. A similar pattern emerged in the correlations between the\nparasite-richness indices and the two measures of openness, although the correlations\ninvolving the human-specific and multihost indices were not substantially different in\nmagnitude (see Table 1). In follow-up regression analyses that included all three parasite-\nThe parasite-stress model of human personality and societal values\nrichness indices as simultaneous predictors of each openness measure, none of the three\nindices was a significant predictor (all ps > 0.20). Given the uninformative results of these\nregression analyses, an additional set of regression analyses was created in which the\nhuman-specific and multihost parasite-richness indices were summed to create a broader\nindex of non-zoonotic parasite richness; this non-zoonotic index was entered along with the\nzoonotic index as predictors of openness. The results revealed that the non-zoonotic index\nwas a significant predictor of the McCrae et al.

In contrast,\nzoonotic parasite richness exerted no predictive effect whatsoever (beta's = 0.00 and 0.04,\nTable 1.

Each of the two individualism measures correlated\nsubstantially negatively with both human-specific and multihost parasite richness; in\ncontrast, they correlated only weakly with zoonotic parasite richness (see Table 2).\nAnalogously, each of the two collectivism measures, as well as the measure of family ties,\nshowed moderate to strong positive correlations with both human-specific and multihost\nparasite richness, and weaker correlations with zoonotic parasite richness. Follow-up\nregression analyses included all three parasite richness indices as predictors. The results\nrevealed that the predictive effects associated with human-specific parasite richness\nremained significant on two of the five outcome measures (the Suh et al. individualism\nmeasure, and the family ties measure; both ps < 0.001), and marginally significant on two\nother measures (the Hofstede individual measure, and the Gelfand collectivism measure; ps\n= 0.09 and 0.12, respectively). The predictive effects of multihost parasite richness\nremained significant on three of the five outcomes measures (both individualism measures,\nas well as the Kashima and Kashima pronoun-drop measure of collectivism; all ps < 0.001)\nand marginally significant on one additional measure (the Gelfand collectivism measure; p\nThe parasite-stress model of human personality and societal values\n= 0.10). In contrast, the modest relations with zoonotic parasite richness actually reversed\nin sign when controlling for shared variance with the other parasite-richness measures. For\nthe two individualism measures, the reversal in sign actually resulted in significant positive\nrelations with zoonotic parasite richness (both ps < 0.002), in direct contrast with the\nsignificant negative relations with human-specific and multihost parasite richness.\nAdditional regression analyses that included the zoonotic index and the non-zoonotic\ncomposite index as predictors revealed a clear distinction: non-zoonotic parasite richness\nwas a unique negative predictor of individualism (both ps < 0.001), and a unique positive\npredictor of collectivism and family ties (all three ps < 0.001); zoonotic parasite richness\nhad no consistent unique effect, and any effect at all (on the two individualism measures)\nwas exactly opposite to that indicated by the correlations in Table 2.\nTable 2.

Human-specific parasite\nrichness had the strongest correlations, followed by multihost parasite richness; all these\ncorrelations were statistically significant. In contrast, zoonotic parasite richness had\nrelatively weaker relations with democratization measures. In follow-up regression\nanalyses, with all three parasite richness indices entered simultaneously as predictors,\nhuman-specific parasite richness remained a robust and statistically significant predictor of\nall five outcome measures (all ps < 0.001). These regression analyses revealed a unique\neffect of multihost parasite richness on one of the five democratization measures\n(Vanhanen's resource distribution measure; p = 0.05). These same analyses revealed that\nany apparent effect of zoonotic parasite richness disappeared entirely or, if anything,\nreversed in sign. Zoonotic parasite richness was significantly positively, rather than\nnegatively, correlated with the EIU democracy index, and with both of Vanhanen's indices,\nThe parasite-stress model of human personality and societal values\nwhen controlling for shared variance with the other parasite richness indices; ps < 0.005.\nTable 3.

The relation with zoonotic parasite richness was\nnegligible and non-significant (r = -0.09, p = 0.37). In a follow-up regression analysis with\nall three parasite richness indices simultaneously entered as predictors of gender equality,\nonly the human-specific index remained a statistically significant predictor (p < 0.001).\nAncillary Analyses: Zoonotics, Non-Zoonotics and Livestock. The preceding analyses\nsuggest that relations linking parasite prevalence to human personality and societal values\n(documented in previous publications) are attributable primarily to the prevalence of non-\nzoonotic parasites (human-specific and multihost parasites). Compared to the effects of\nnon-zoonotic parasite richness, any effects associated with zoonotic parasite richness were\nnegligible.\nBefore conclusively ruling out the contribution of zoonotic parasites to these world-\nwide differences in personality and values, it is important to consider an alternative explan-\nation, based on differential measurement error. It is possible that epidemiologists and health\nagencies are especially attentive to diseases that are transmitted from human to human,\nwhereas the presence of zoonotic parasites may be relatively poorly recorded. If so, then\nsimply for reasons of differential measurement error, zoonotic parasite richness would be\nexpected to correlate less strongly than non-zoonotics with any outcome variable.\nThe plausibility of this alternative explanation is undermined by evidence that many\nzoonotic diseases are monitored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and\nThe parasite-stress model of human personality and societal values\nother relevant agencies worldwide, as zoonotics are thought to be an important source of\nemerging human infectious diseases (e.g., bird flu; Greger, 2007; Jones et al., 2008). Some\nzoonotics, however, may escape surveillance by these agencies (e.g., Maudlin, Eisler and\nWelburn, 2009). One way to address this alternative explanation empirically is to show that\nthe zoonotic parasite-richness index is measured with sufficient fidelity to predict addition-\nal outcome variables to which it is conceptually related--such as the presence of livestock\nwithin a country. Many zoonotic diseases are contracted from livestock, and so we should\nobserve an especially strong relationship between livestock and zoonotic parasite\nrichness--but only if the index of zoonotic parasite richness is measured with a high degree\nof validity and reliability.\nFor 205 countries, we computed the total number of avian and mammalian livestock\nover the period from 2000 to 2004 (data obtained from the Global Livestock Atlas of the\nWorld Agricultural Information Center; http://www.fao.org/index_en.htm). To correct for\nskew and kurtosis, this value was log-transformed prior to analyses. Correlations with the\nthree parasite richness indices were as follows: human-specific, r = 0.31; multihost, r =\nparasite-richness indices simultaneously entered as predictors, only zoonotic parasite rich-\nness remained significantly, positively related to the total number of livestock (p < 0.001).\nThese results reveal that the zoonotic parasite-richness index is measured with suffi-\ncient accuracy to be a uniquely powerful predictor in domains of conceptual relevance.\nDifferential measurement error, therefore, is unlikely to account for the fact that non-\nzoonotic parasite richness predicted cross-national variability in human personality and\nsocietal values to a much greater extent than did zoonotic disease richness. The data for\neach of the analyses in this article are available upon request from the corresponding\nauthor.\nDiscussion\nAlthough there is a substantial body of evidence linking the prevalence of human\ninfectious diseases to human social behavior, prior investigations have been limited by the\nfact that (a) previous indices of human parasite prevalence represented only a small fraction\nof the hundreds of infectious diseases that affect human health, and (b) these indices failed\nto distinguish between different disease categories defined by the mode of transmission. To\naddress these limitations, in this study we employed data bearing on more than 300 differ-\nent human infectious diseases, we computed separate indices assessing the prevalence of\nthree functionally distinct categories of these diseases (human-specific, multihost,\nzoonotic), and we examined the extent to which each index uniquely predicted cross-\nnational differences in personality traits and societal values. The results were striking.\nBoth human-specific and multihost parasite richness predicted uniquely cross-national\ndifferences in personality traits and social values. Zoonotic parasite richness contributed\nlittle, if at all, to previously documented cross-national relationships between parasite\nprevalence and sociality. Thus, to the extent that worldwide variation in sociality is\npredicted by parasite prevalence, this variation appears to be attributable almost entirely to\nthe prevalence of non-zoonotic diseases.\nSeveral cross-national differences were especially strongly predicted by human-\nspecific parasite richness. For example, only human-specific parasite richness (but not\nmultihost parasite richness) uniquely predicted differences in extraversion. This highly\nThe parasite-stress model of human personality and societal values\nspecific effect fits the functional logic that informs the parasite-stress model of sociality,\ngiven that extraversion is defined by behavioral interactions with other humans, but has\nlittle bearing on the broader range of behaviors that may expose individuals to inter-species\npathogen transmission. Cross-national differences in democratization and gender equality\nalso were more strongly predicted by human-specific rather than multihost parasite rich-\nness. This effect may reflect the fact that one fundamental consequence of democratic,\negalitarian ideologies is increased proximity to and behavioral contact between a wider\nrange of peoples.\nIn contrast, human-specific and multihost parasite richness were approximately equal-\nly predictive of openness to experience, and of individualistic/collectivistic values. These\nfindings also conform to the functional logic of the parasite-stress model, as both openness\nand individualism/collectivism have consequences for a broad range of behaviors, includ-\ning behaviors with implications for interpersonal contact (e.g., approach versus avoidance\nof unfamiliar peoples), as well as behaviors with implications for inter-species transmission\nof pathogens (e.g., violation versus conformity to cultural norms pertaining to hygiene).\nIntriguingly, there was also one cross-national difference that was predicted especially\nstrongly by multihost (compared to human-specific) parasite richness: female sociosexual\norientation. This is the only finding observed here that is not immediately interpretable\nwithin our functional framework.\nMore generally, interpretation of the sociosexuality findings is complicated by a com-\nplex set of causal relations involving social value systems, sexual behavior, and parasite\ntransmission. We have seen that as prevalence of non-zoonotic diseases declines, there is\ngreater liberalization of social attitudes and values in general, and of sexual attitudes in\nparticular. In turn, sexual liberalization facilitates transmission of sexually transmitted para-\nsites, and is correlated positively with the prevalence, diversity and virulence of sexually\ntransmitted parasites (Barber, 2008; Celentano, Sifakis, Go, and Davis, 2008; Ewald,\n1994). One implication of our results is that female sexual liberalization accompanies a\nreduction in non-zoonotic (especially multihost) diseases, in spite of the fact that this sexual\nliberalization produces an increase in the threat posed specifically by sexually transmitted\ndiseases. In order to more completely untangle this complicated set of causal relations, it\nmay be necessary to develop even more nuanced parasite-stress measures (e.g., country-\nlevel measures specific to sexually transmitted parasites that assess temporal changes in\nprevalence, variety and virulence).\nIn contrast to the effects of non-zoonotic disease richness, we found that (when\ncontrolling for shared variance with non-zoonotic disease richness) zoonotic disease\nrichness actually related positively with several democracy measures. The direction of this\nrelation is in the direction opposite that expected if zoonosis causes human social\npsychology and behavior. We can only speculate as to the reason for this positive relation.\nOne possibility is that this relation may reflect the broader trade policies and associated\nopenness to agricultural importation in democratic countries compared to autocratic\ncountries.\nThe dependent variables that we used span several prior decades. Value systems and\nparasite stress tend to be regionally stable in general (Fincher et al., 2008; Murray and\nSchaller, 2010; Thornhill et al., 2009). In large part, the stability of parasite stress is stable\nbecause of parasites' adaptation to ecological factors such as temperature and rainfall\n(Guernier et al., 2004). When parasite stress declines dramatically as a result of increased\nThe parasite-stress model of human personality and societal values\nhygienic and medical infrastructure and technology in a region, there is evidence that\nvalues also show the changes predicted by the parasite-stress theory of sociality (see below\non the social revolution in the West). Also, our research shows that the contemporary\nparasite measures we used have the same patterns of covariation across dependent\nvariables, regardless of when the dependent variables were tabulated by prior researchers.\nMost broadly, our results have many implications for future research exploring rela-\ntions between infectious diseases and human sociality. For instance, in addition to investi-\ngations that have tested the parasite-stress model of sociality on cross-national data, there\nare additional studies that have identified correlates of parasite stress across small-scale\nsocieties (Low, 1990; Quinlan, 2007). The results of these studies are--like previous cross-\nnational inquiries--limited by the fact that parasite-stress measures did not distinguish be-\ntween functionally distinct categories of disease (e.g., human-specific, multihost, zoonotic).\nTherefore, just as our analytic methods allowed a more nuanced interpretation of cross-\nnational results, interpretation of the small-scale society results also is likely to benefit from\na similar analytic approach. As well, an important, broad implication of our findings is that\ninvestigations into the interactions between parasites and sociality in organisms outside of\nhumans will benefit from considering the distinction between infectious agents that are\ntransmitted between conspecifics versus those that are not.\nThere are additional implications for processes operating at other levels. It has been\nargued that ontogenetic infection experiences or lack thereof may be proximate causes that\ntrack individuals into collectivism or individualism, respectively, and that other cues of\nlocal contagion risk during ontogeny also may be proximate causes (Fincher et al., 2008;\nThornhill et al., 2009). Cross-national consequences of parasite prevalence may result from\neven more subtle ontogenetic processes operating on individuals. For instance, research on\nnon-human mammals reveals that maternal exposure to parasites has effects on offspring\nsocial behavior (e.g., Curno, Behnke, McElligott, Reader, and Barnard, 2008), implying\nepigenetic consequences on individuals' social development. Given our results, one might\nspeculate that these effects are more pronounced under conditions of maternal exposure to\nnon-zoonotic, rather than zoonotic, pathogens. A separate line of research on human cogni-\ntion reveals that the perceived threat posed by infectious diseases has consequences for\nprejudicial attitudes and other forms of social cognition (e.g., when the threat of disease is\nmore salient, people express more xenophobic attitudes and less extraverted behavioral\ninclinations; Faulkner, Schaller, Park, and Duncan, 2004; Mortensen, Becker, Ackerman,\nNeuberg, and Kenrick, in press). These effects also may be specific to the perceived threat\nof non-zoonotic, rather than zoonotic, diseases.\nThere are also implications for predicting effects of public health policy on societal\nchange. Thornhill et al. (2009) noted that the predictions of the parasite-stress model are\nconsistent with the marked increase in the liberalization of social values that began to occur\nin the West in the 1960s and 1970s (e.g., civil rights, women's rights, gay and lesbian\nrights, anti-authoritarianism, etc.). In the West, but not outside of it, infectious-disease\nprevalence was reduced dramatically a generation or two earlier as a result of widespread\navailability of antibiotics, child vaccination programs, food- and water-safety practices,\nincreased sanitation and vector control (see Thornhill et al., 2009 for documentation).\nNotably, these public health programs were especially successful in combating non-zoo-\nnotic rather than zoonotic diseases. This observation, buttressed by the results reported\nhere, suggests that public health initiatives are most likely to have additional consequences\nThe parasite-stress model of human personality and societal values\nfor societies (e.g., promotion of civil liberties and egalitarian value systems) to the extent\nthat those initiatives are effective in reducing the prevalence of non-zoonotic, rather than\nzoonotic, diseases.\nOur proximate model for how humans get their value system and personality is based\non condition-dependent psychology. This implies the presence of both low and high\ninfectious-disease stress in the deep-time past generations of humans. Hence, we are not\nsaying that humans are primarily individualistic, nor are they basically collectivistic.\nFundamentally, they are both, and which track is taken depends on ontogenetic experiences\npertaining to parasite stress in the local ecological setting. The conditionality is not negated\nby evidence of genetic differences in value systems across countries (Chiao and Blizinsky,\n2010). The literature on alternative reproductive tactics in animals reveals that adaptive\nconditionality, i.e., adaptive phenotypic plasticity, typically is a part of genetically distinct\nadaptations across populations and species (Oliveira et al., 2008).\nConclusion\nThe parasite-stress model of human sociality provides an evolutionarily informed\nexplanation of why specific human populations inhabiting different parts of the planet\n(northern Europe versus southern Europe, for instance) are often described by different\ntraits, different values, and different cultural norms. More strikingly perhaps, it also helps\nexplain why some populations inhabiting different parts of the planet (e.g., equatorial South\nAmerica and southeast Asia) actually have many cultural traits in common. Thus, in\naddition to prototypically cultural processes that are sometimes used to explain common-\nalities among nations (e.g., cultural transmission processes), our research implies that many\nimportant cultural commonalities--just like many cultural differences--are attributable\npartially to evolved processes through which universal psychological tendencies are evoked\nin response to features in the natural ecology (Gangestad et al., 2006). Further, this work\nsuggests that, among those ecological features, the prevalence of disease-causing parasites\nexerts a particularly important influence on human psychology and culture. And finally, as\nwe show here, the parasites that seem to have mattered most to cultural outcomes are not\nthe zoonotic diseases. Rather, as predicted by the parasite-stress model of human sociality,\nthe parasites that have mattered most are those with non-zoonotic modes of transmission.\n"
