One sample (n = 1 179) consisted of individuals from the sibling pair data. A second\nsample (n = 4 648) consisted of individuals that were not part of the paired data. Regression models were constructed\nto establish if there was a relationship between breastfeeding and two measures of weight distribution: WHtR and\nbody mass index (BMI). Controls for parental socioeconomic status, maternal smoking, race, sex, age, birth weight,\nmaternal BMI, genetic ancestry, and a genetic risk score (GRS) for obesity were included. In addition, a behavioral risk\nscore (BRS) was constructed to control for other residual confounding factors.\nResults: A significant, inverse relationship between breastfeeding and adult WHtR persisted in models constructed\nfrom the sibling pair sample (P = 0.002) and unrelated sample (P <0.0001). This association remained significant with\nthe inclusion of ancestry principal components, GRS, and a measure of maternal obesity.\nConclusions: The moderate association between breastfeeding and weight distribution persists into adulthood while\ncontrolling for potential confounders. This paper also provides evidence that the WHtR may be a superior outcome\nmeasure to BMI in studies investigating breastfeeding and obesity.\n",

McQueen4\n Keywords: Breastfeeding, Obesity, Residual Confounding, Waist-to-Height Ratio\nBackground\nThe prevalence of obesity and overweight has increased\nsignificantly over the past two decades. Among non-\nHispanic white men, the prevalence of obesity increased\n2010 [1]. Recent estimates place the number of over-\nweight at one billion worldwide, of which 300 million\nare classified as obese [2]. As such, the obesity epidemic\nhas become one of the most pressing public health is-\nsues facing global populations.\nIncreases in obesity prevalence have been linked to an\nincreasingly sedentary lifestyle and consumption of a\nlow quality diet, but these factors alone do not com-\npletely explain the nature of the epidemic, nor the fact\nthat some are more prone to becoming obese and\nretaining weight than others [3, 4]. One of the most\nimportant early developmental factors of interest is\nbreastfeeding. A recent study from a sample of over-\nweight adolescents revealed that breastfeeding of an in-\nfant is associated with lower incidence of obesity and\ncomplications related to metabolic syndrome in the off-\nspring [5]. Other studies have revealed that longer dur-\nation of breastfeeding of an infant may be protective\nagainst obesity in childhood or reduce the risk of being\noverweight in childhood [6\u00ad9]. Researchers have identi-\nfied several physiological links between breastfeeding\nand body size of the offspring. In addition to fatty acids,\nvitamins, and minerals, breast milk also contains a di-\nverse population of bacteria that colonize the intestinal\ntract of the infant and may have protective benefits\nagainst weight gain throughout life [10]. Breastfeeding\nduration may also delay the introduction of solid foods\nfor the infant, which has been linked to childhood obes-\nity in some cohorts [11]. However, other studies have\nfound this not to be predictive of obesity [10].\n* Correspondence: Adam.Bohr@Colorado.edu\nUSA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2015 Bohr et al.

One reason\nis that the evidence comes solely from observational\nstudies, as randomized trials for breastfeeding would be\nunethical [12]. The observational studies that do exist\nhave potentially serious problems with selection bias\n(e.g., those that are most likely to breastfeed may also be\nthe most likely to lead a lifestyle that is related to a\nhealthy body mass index (BMI)) and residual confound-\ning, as breastfeeding is strongly associated with import-\nant characteristics of mothers. [6, 12\u00ad14] Nevertheless,\nrecent studies have attempted to reduce residual con-\nfounding and selection bias by using sibling pairs that\nwere discordant for breastfeeding [15, 16]. They found\nthat the relationship between breastfeeding and BMI ob-\nserved in between-families analyses was no longer sig-\nnificant in the within-family analysis.\nThis study builds upon earlier work by using an emer-\nging indicator of weight distribution, the waist-to-height\nratio (WHtR), as the primary outcome variable to test\nthis association [17, 18]. There is evidence that the\nWHtR may be a more accurate diagnostic tool for\nobesity-related chronic diseases than the more trad-\nitional BMI because it more accurately characterizes adi-\nposity [18]. It is known that visceral fat is more\nmetabolic and inflammatory than adipose tissue in other\nsubcutaneous regions [19, 20]. This concept is also sup-\nported by a meta-analysis performed by Ashwell et al.\n(2012) which showed that the WHtR consistently dis-\ncriminated better for co-morbidities associated with\nobesity than BMI and waist circumference [17]. Further,\nin the context of early developmental factors, using\nheight in combination with waist circumference may re-\nsult in a more sensitive measure to detect early develop-\nmental factors associated with obesity. This is because\npoor fetal nutrition is associated with both short stature\nand overweight status [18]. We also perform analyses\nusing BMI to allow for comparisons between previously\nconducted studies of breastfeeding and measures of\nbody mass. Finally, on a subset of the overall sample, we\nutilize genome-wide association data to incorporate a\ngenetic risk score (GRS) for BMI as well as measures of\ngenetic ancestry.\nMethods\nParticipants\nThe study utilized a sample of individuals from the Na-\ntional Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add\nHealth) [21]. Add Health is a longitudinal study that in-\nvestigates how social and environmental factors may in-\nfluence health. It has followed a cohort of individuals\nthrough four waves of interviewing and testing since its\nAdd Health study consisted of 20 792 participants.\nHowever, a substantial amount of this sample was not\npart of the Wave 1 parent interviews or measured for\nwaist circumference and height at Wave 4. In addition,\ngenome-wide association data is available on the sibling\npair (SP) sample only. Therefore, we analyzed a sub-\nsample of 1 179 respondents with genome-wide data\nfrom the SP sample as well as 4 648 respondents from\nthe unrelated (UN) sample. Also, to ensure that the re-\nlatedness of the siblings was not impacting the associa-\ntions observed in the SP sample, we randomly selected\none participant from each sibling pair resulting in a third\nsample of 856 respondents and performed analyses on\nthis sample. Variables from all four waves of interviews\nand measurements from the Add Health Study were\nused. In an effort to retain the largest possible sample\nsize, missingness was allowed for two covariates in the\nanalysis: birth weight and parental smoking.\nData\nThe specific Add Health variable code names used in\nthis study are listed in the supplementary information\nsection to this paper (Additional file 2: Table S1). The\nprimary variables of interest in this study were breast-\nfeeding, WHtR, and BMI. Breastfeeding data were ex-\ntracted from the in-home parent interviews conducted\nduring Wave 1 (baseline). The options provided for the\nbreastfeeding question were \"Never Breastfed\", \"0\u00ad3\nmoved any cases of missingness for breastfeeding from\nour analyses. In an effort to reduce any potential recall\nbias that may exist in the reporting of duration of\nbreastfeeding, we opted to analyze breastfeeding only as\na dichotomous variable. Individuals that were never\nbreastfed were coded as \"0\" while those that were breast-\nfed were coded as \"1\".\nHeight (cm) and waist circumference (cm) were ex-\ntracted from the Add Health Wave 4 anthropometric\nmeasurements. Waist circumference was measured to\nthe nearest 0.5 cm at the superior border of the iliac\ncrest. [21] The WHtR metric was calculated by dividing\nwaist circumference by height. BMI values were also\ntaken from Wave 4 data. As with breastfeeding, we re-\nmoved any cases from our analyses that were missing\nfor WHtR and BMI.\nTo control for behavioral differences between indi-\nviduals, we utilized risk scores constructed from a\nvariety of indicators. The risk scores were calculated\nusing the R package, pcaMethods, and allowed for\nmissing data [22]. For this study, the behavioral risk\nscores (BRS) are the first three principal components\nderived from a cluster of items regarding diet, sleep,\nand exercise. The BRS components were validated\nusing both Wave 4 WHtR and BMI. The specific Add\nHealth variables used and details on how the risk\nscores were constructed can be found in the supple-\nmentary information (Additional file 1 and Additional\nA genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated for each in-\ndividual in the SP data set. Genome-wide association\nstudies have identified 31 single nucleotide polymor-\nphisms (SNPs) in individuals of European descent and 8\nSNPs in individuals of African American descent that\nare associated with BMI [23, 24]. These SNPs were used\nto compute risks scores, and analyses were conducted\ntesting the association of these risk scores with BMI,\nobesity, WHtR, and change in BMI over time. A more in\ndepth description of these risk scores and their construc-\ntion using the SP sample can be found in Domingue et\nal. [25]. To develop our measure of genetic ancestry, we\nused KING to identify clusters of individuals based upon\ngenetic similarity [26]. KING uses multidimensional\nscaling (MDS) with Euclidean distance to generate prin-\ncipal coordinates (PCs) that can be used to identify\npopulation substructure. A full description of the\nderivation of the ancestry PCs can be found in McQueen\nIn addition to the calculated risk scores, we used the\nfollowing controls: birth weight (lb.); parental SES; par-\nental smoking; maternal obesity; gender; age; and race.\nBirth weights for the subjects were obtained from the\nWave 1 in-home parent interviews. Because low birth\nweight is hypothesized to be associated with higher\nWHtR in adulthood, birth weight was assessed as a cat-\negorical variable that compared low birth weight sub-\njects to normal birth weight subjects. Low birth weight\nstatus was assigned to subjects that weighed less than 2\n500 g (5.5 lb.). As stated above, this variable allowed for\nmissingness and was analyzed as a factor, with low birth\nweight and missing birth weight compared to the refer-\nent category, normal birth weight.\nSelf-reported parental smoking status was also ex-\ntracted from the Wave 1 in-home parent interviews and\nanalyzed as a factor, allowing for missingness, with \"yes\"\nfor smoking and missingness for smoking compared to\nthe referent group of nonsmoking. For a measure of ma-\nternal obesity, we used the question \"Is the biological\nmother obese?\" from the Wave 1 in-home parent inter-\nview. This variable was dichotomous, and a response of\n\"no\" was coded as \"0\" while \"yes\" was coded as \"1\". Self-\nreported race was analyzed as a factor, comparing His-\npanic, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic Asian/Na-\ntive American to the referent group non-Hispanic\nAfrican American. Parental SES was assessed with self-\nreported household income at Wave 1 of the study and\nwas analyzed as a dichotomous variable. We coded those\nthat reported income less than the median income from\nthat reported income of greater than the median as high\nSES (\"1\").\nDescriptive statistics in total and stratified by breast-\nfeeding status for sex, race, parental smoking, low birth\nweight occurrence, parental SES, maternal obesity, BMI,\nand WHtR for the two samples can be found in Tables 1\nand 2. The average age of the participants at Wave 4\nBreastfeeding initiation was 49.2 % in our UN sample\nand 39.4 % in our SP sample. In reviewing the descrip-\ntive statistics for this study, it is worth commenting on\ncertain elements of the sample. Rates of breastfeeding\nthe initiation rates in our samples would be between\nthese two rates. In addition, there are some racial dispar-\nities in the initiation of breastfeeding. African Americans\ncomprise 18.4 % of the individuals in the UN sample but\nonly 11.68 % of the individuals that were breastfed. This\ndisparity was observed in the SP sample as well. This is\nconsistent with previous literature that has demon-\nstrated a lower rate of breastfeeding initiation in African\nAmericans, while there are not large discrepancies be-\ntween non-Hispanic white or Hispanics [29]. In addition,\nit may explain some of the difference in breastfeeding\nrates between our two samples, as the SP sample was\n34.18 % African American and the UN sample was\n18.42 % African American. Finally, there were differ-\nences in the rates of low birth weight between the two\nare likely attributed to the oversampling of African\nAmericans.\nStatistical analysis\nUnrelated sample (UN)\nOLS regression models were used to investigate the rela-\ntionship between breastfeeding and measures of weight\ndistribution. For both WHtR and BMI, breastfeeding\nwas the primary predictor variable of interest. As noted\nabove, breastfeeding was analyzed as a dichotomous\nvariable (ever breastfed coded as \"1\", never breastfed\ncoded as \"0\") in these models. Models constructed from\nthe UN data included all covariates with the exception\nof the genetic risk scores and ancestry principal compo-\nnents. We also tested for a maternal obesity and breast-\nfeeding interaction to assess whether or not the\nassociation between breastfeeding and weight distribu-\ntion was dependent on the weight status of the mother.\nThis interaction term was not significant in any of our\nanalyses and therefore excluded from the final models.\nAdditionally, we tested for an interaction between\nbreastfeeding and the genetic risk score that was also\nnot significant and excluded from the final models.\nFinally, we used the Add Health Wave 1 sample weights\nfor all models in the UN sample. The statistical power\nfor these models was as follows: WHtR Outcome, (1 -\nIn addition to the linear models, we also constructed\nlogistic regression models to further investigate the de-\ncrease in risk of obesity associated with breastfeeding in\nboth samples. For this analysis, we created a dichotom-\nous variable to indicate obesity status (BMI  30). All\nanalyses and calculations were done using R version\nSibling Pair Sample (SP)\nOLS regression models were also constructed from the\nSP sample. These models included all of the covariates\nthat were tested in the UN sample and tested the out-\ncomes WHtR, BMI, and BMI  30. In addition, these\nmodels included the PCs for genetic ancestry and the\nGRS as controls. The statistical power for these models\nSubset of Sibling Pair Sample (SSP)\nFinally, OLS regression models were also constructed\nfrom a subset of the SP sample. One participant was\nrandomly selected from each of the sibling pairs, and the\nOLS models described for the SP sample were also con-\nstructed from this subset. The statistical power for these\nmodels was as follows: WHtR Outcome, (1 - ) = 0.093;\nResults\nPrimary outcomes and exposures\nThe results of the multiple linear regression models\nfrom the UN and SP samples are presented in Tables 3\nand 4. In our UN sample, breastfeeding was associated\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics for participants from the add health study, 1994-2008.

All other fac-\ntors being equal, breastfeeding was associated with a de-\ncrease in predicted adult WHtR of 0.012 and in\npredicted adult BMI of 0.548. We observed a consistent\neffect in the SP sample, as breastfeeding was associated\nwith a decrease in both WHtR and BMI. Once again, all\nother factors being equal, breastfeeding was associated\nwith a decrease in predicted adult WHtR of 0.020 and\npredicted adult BMI of 1.049. As anticipated, the GRS is\na highly significant predictor of body weight measures in\nall models constructed from the SP sample. The third\nprincipal component for ancestry was a significant pre-\ndictor of both WHtR and BMI in the SP sample while\nthe fifth principal component was predictive of BMI\nonly. All three principal components of the BRS were\nsignificant predictors of body weight measures in our\nUN sample, but only the first principal component\nremained significant with the inclusion of the GRS in\nthe SP sample.\nThe results from the logistic regression model are pre-\nsented in Table 5 and include calculated odds ratios,\n95 % confidence intervals, and P values. Consistent with\nthe results of the linear models, breastfeeding was asso-\nciated with a decreased risk of obesity in the UN sample\ntors being equal, having been breastfed was associated\nwith a 0.854 odds of obesity compared to those that\nwere not breastfed.

Consistent\nwith the results from both the UN sample and full SP\nsample, breastfeeding was associated with a decrease in\nTable 2 Descriptive statistics for participants from the Add Health Study, 1994\u00ad2008.

In addition, the results of the logistic regression\npredicting BMI  30 showed a significant association\nWith all other factors being equal, those that were not\nbreastfed were 1.43 times more likely to be obese than\nthose that were breastfed.\nOther covariates\nLow birth weight was associated with decreased BMI in\nour UN sample but was not a significant predictor in\nany other models. Parental smoking was a significant\npredictor of both BMI, WHtR, and BMI  30 in the UN\nsample, but was not significant in the SP sample. Several\nof our racial categories were significant predictors of\nBMI in the UN sample. Reporting non-Hispanic white\nor non-Hispanic Asian/Native American was associated\nwith a decrease in predicted BMI when compared with\nthe referent group, non-Hispanic African American.\nHowever, this effect was only seen for those reporting\nwhite for the WHtR outcome. Of particular note, race\nwas not a significant predictor in any of models from\nthe SP sample or the subset from the SP sample. Our\nmeasure of parental SES was inversely related to WHtR\nand BMI in the UN sample and was trending in the SP\nsample. Parental SES was also a significant predictor of\nWHtR and was trending for BMI in the subset of the SP\nsample. Our variable for maternal obesity was a strong\npositive predictor of BMI, WHtR, and BMI  30 in all\nsamples.\nDiscussion\nPrevious research has linked a variety of early childhood\nfactors to the health status of adults [31]. A great deal of\nrecent interest has focused on breastfeeding as an im-\nportant determinant of health status into adulthood, and\nour study contributes to this body of work in several im-\nportant ways. Few studies investigating the role breast-\nfeeding use the WHtR as an outcome as opposed to\nBMI, and to our knowledge none have done so with\nadults. This is important because, while there are de-\nbates about the value of the BMI in epidemiologic re-\nsearch, the WHtR has been shown to be a superior\nindicator of physical composition as it describes the dis-\ntribution of weight. [17\u00ad20] As such the inclusion of this\nmeasure enhances our understanding of the role of\nbreastfeeding for the health of populations.\nWaist-to-height ratio outcome* Body mass index outcome**\nb SE P value b SE P value\nBirthweight >2500 g Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference\nParent nonsmoker Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference\nNon-Hispanic African American Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference\nb (Coefficient) SE (Standard Error)\nSecond, the Add Health study has several features that\nenhance the validity of our findings. For example, BMI\nand WHtR were both measured in the field by trained\ntechnicians rather than self-reported. The design of the\nAdd Health study allows for opportunity to make true\npopulation inferences not only about prevalence and in-\ncidence but more importantly about key associational\nparameters such as breastfeeding and adult health. The\nrichness of these data allow us to include detailed and\ncomprehensive measures of behavioral and environ-\nmental risks, such as SES, diet, and exercise, that may\nconfound the association. In addition, our regression\nmodels had controls in place for race, parental SES,\nparental smoking, maternal obesity, and low birth\nweight. Finally, controlling for maternal obesity pro-\nvides additional support that the association between\nbreastfeeding and weight distribution is not dependent\non family factors.\nFinally, we were able to establish a consistent effect of\nbreastfeeding on both WHtR and BMI in both Add\nHealth subsamples. This finding was robust in the SP\ndata set that included genetic risk factors for BMI/obes-\nity as well as measures of genetic ancestry. We further\ntested this finding on a subset of the SP sample, demon-\nstrating that this association was not due to the related-\nness of the subjects. To our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy to assess the role of breastfeeding on weight distri-\nbution using measured genetic factors that could influ-\nence the risk of obesity. The robustness of the\nassociation between breastfeeding and measures of\nweight status controlling for genetics is novel and\nprovides additional support for the association be-\ntween breastfeeding and weight distribution that has\nbeen reported elsewhere.\nThere are many characteristics of breastfeeding that\nmay help to explain how feeding practice early in life\nWaist-to-height ratio outcome* Body mass index outcome**\nb SE P value b SE P value\nBirthweight >2500 g Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference\nParent nonsmoker Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference\nNon-Hispanic African American Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference\nb (Coefficient) SE (Standard Error)\ncan influence weight distribution and possibly have pro-\ntective benefits against obesity in adulthood. To begin,\nbreastfeeding appears to result in lower overall energy\nintake than formula feeding in the early postnatal period\nand is associated with an infant's ability to self-regulate\nmilk intake [32, 33]. These findings take on greater sig-\nnificance when one considers the effect that early weight\ngain can have on weight status in later childhood and\neven adulthood. There is evidence that overweight status\nin childhood has an impact on the risk of being over-\nweight in adulthood [33]. In addition, rapid weight gain\nin infancy is related to being overweight later in child-\nA recent study that is most comparable to the current\nstudy was conducted by Rousseaux et al. [35]. The study\nused multivariate analysis to test for relationships with\nmeasures of body composition including WHtR. It\nfound no significant associations between breastfeeding\nand measures of body composition. However, a nonsig-\nnificant trend towards a protective benefit was identified\non the highest percentiles of abdominal adiposity. The\ntwo studies differed in the age of the participants in\naddition to a large difference in mean WHtR, which\ncould account for the disparity in the findings. Given\nthat HELENA is a cohort study, future research is war-\nranted to test for the association in adulthood.\nA previous study that is in conflict with the current\nstudy was a randomized control trial conducted in\nBelarus. This trial was a breastfeeding promotion inter-\nvention, and found that the intervention increased the\nduration of breastfeeding but did not influence weight\nor adiposity at roughly 6.5 years old [12]. However, the\nstudy was conducted in Belarus, a country that does not\nhave a comparable prevalence of obesity to the United\nStates. Therefore, the results may not be generalizable to\nthe cohort used in the current study. In addition, this\nstudy influenced only duration of breastfeeding and not\ninitiation. The current study compared individuals that\nwere breastfed to those that were not breastfed. It may\nbe possible that while long duration of breastfeeding\ndoesn't add any additional risk reduction benefit, breast-\nfeeding in early infancy may convey a significant benefit\nvs. individuals that were never breastfed at all.\nAnother study that contrasted with ours and used the\nAdd Health sample was conducted by Evenhouse and\nReilly. It found no differences in BMI between sibling\npairs discordant for breastfeeding [15]. Utilizing a\nwithin-family discordant sibling model is an efficient ap-\nproach to control for family-level effects including gen-\netic ancestry, race, and SES. However, there are other\ndifferences between the two studies that could account\nfor the contrasting findings. First, within-family analyses\nTable 5 Results of logistic regression predicting BMI  30: Unrelated and sibling pair sample, Add Health Study, 1994\u00ad2008\nUnrelated sample Sibling pair sample*\nBirthweight >2500 g Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference\nParent nonsmoker Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference\nNon-Hispanic African American Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference\nOR (Odds Ratio), 95 % CI (95 % Confidence Interval)\n*The analyses for the paired sample also controlled for genetic ancestry which is not displayed in the above table\nusing discordant sibling pairs can be limited by within-\nfamily variation in breastfeeding. As noted in Evanhouse\nand Reilly, there were 523 sibling pairs discordant for\nbreastfeeding duration and only 288 pairs discordant for\nbreastfeeding (one sibling breastfed, the other did not).\nGiven the relatively high correlation of BMI within\nsibling pairs (heritability estimates range from 60 to\n80 %), it is possible that a discordant sibling pair\nstudy was underpowered to detect an association due\nto breastfeeding [36, 37]. Additionally, the present\nstudy used the participants BMI and WHtR at Wave\n4 as opposed to Wave 1, which would have reduced\nour sample size for pairs discordant for breastfeeding\ninitiation to 62 and substantially reduced our statis-\ntical power to detect any differences between siblings\ndiscordant for breastfeeding. Finally, we observed that\nWHtR may be a more sensitive measure of body\nweight compared to BMI as it relates to the associ-\nation with breastfeeding.\nLimitations\nOne of the primary criticisms of breastfeeding studies in\ngeneral is related to residual confounding and recall bias.\nIn this study, we were not able to control for maternal\ndiet, which is often implicated in early infant weight gain\nand childhood obesity. In addition, the information on\nbreastfeeding duration was via self-report from the\nmothers. On average, mothers would have been asked\nabout breastfeeding duration approximately 12\u00ad15 years\nafter the breastfeeding took place. It is unclear as to\nwhether recall biases may exist in this regard. However,\nthere aren't any reasons to expect systematic differences\nin recall for those individuals who have overweight chil-\ndren vs. those that do not. In addition, we analyzed\nTable 6 Results of regression models predicting waist-to-height ratio, body mass index, and obesity from randomly selected subset\nWaist-to-height ratio outcome* Body mass index outcome** Body mass index  30 outcome***\nb SE P value b SE P value OR 95 % CI P value\nBirthweight >2500 g Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference\nParent nonsmoker Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference\nNon-Hispanic African American Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference\nb (Coefficient) SE (Standard Error) OR (Odds Ratio) 95 % CI (95 % Confidence Interval)\n*** This analysis also controlled for genetic ancestry which is not displayed in the above table\nbreastfeeding strictly as an ever/never variable. While\nthis has the detrimental effect of not discriminating be-\ntween infants that were breastfed for a day and those\nthat were breastfed for two years, it may have minimized\nsome of the recall bias. Also, our control for maternal\nobesity was a self-reported measure at the time of the\nquestionnaire. While this isn't an ideal measure of ma-\nternal obesity at the time of the child's birth, the rate of\nobesity in the UN sample (18.46 %) is consistent with\nand we feel that the mother's weight status at the time\nof the parental survey may serve as an appropriate proxy\nfor her status during and after pregnancy. Finally, we did\nnot have information on whether or not the reported\nbreastfeeding duration was exclusive or partial, and it is\npossible that the relationship between weight distribu-\ntion and breastfeeding status could be affected by\nwhether or not the breastfeeding was supplemented with\nsolid food.\nThe genetic risk score consisted of 31 SNPs that had\nbeen validated using a sample of both black and white\nyoung adults from the Add Health Study [25]. As such,\nthese SNPs were used to construct the genetic risk score\nin the current study. Genome-wide association studies\nhave identified 90+ SNPs that are associated with body\nmass/obesity. However, for the purposes of this study,\nwe were not focused on developing an optimal set of\nSNPs to predict body mass/obesity. Rather, our analysis\nwas focused on an established set of SNPs that suffi-\nciently accounts for the genetic risk of obesity [39\u00ad42].\nWhile additional SNPs (90+ or including genome-wide\nSNPs) would result in a slightly better genetic risk score\nprediction, we are confident that adding the very small\neffects of these additional SNPs would not impact our\nprimary analytic aim: relating breastfeeding to WHtR.\nAdditionally, the measures of genetic ancestry were in-\ncluded to adjust our analyses for potential genetic (as\nopposed to racial/ethnic) differences on the genome-\nwide scale.\nFinally, the analysis was limited due to the availability\nof the genetic measures in the sibling pair sample. We\ntested for whether or not the relationship we observed\nbetween breastfeeding and measures of weight status in\nthe sibling sample was an artifact of the relatedness of\nthe participants. We randomly sampled one sibling from\neach pair and conducted the analyses on these partici-\npants. In all follow-up analyses, we observed the consist-\nent, significant relationship between breastfeeding and\nmeasures of weight status. While other methods may be\nmore efficient in the context of biologically related indi-\nviduals (i.e., mixed effects regression) we were not inter-\nested in studying the family-level effects in these\nanalyses. Furthermore, there are a limited number of sib-\nling pairs discordant for breastfeeding, which diminishes\nour ability to assess any family-level impact on the asso-\nciation of interest.\nConclusion\nOverall, we contend that our collective attention to race,\nSES, GRS, maternal obesity, and BRS would broadly\nserve as correlates of various lifestyle and body weight\nindicators. Residual confounding undoubtedly remains\nin these analyses. However, there would have to be sub-\nstantial unmeasured confounding influence to be able to\nexplain enough of the relationship between breastfeeding\nand weight distribution to completely ameliorate the as-\nsociations observed in this study.\nIn conclusion, the results of the current study demon-\nstrated that breastfeeding is inversely related to the\nWHtR in adulthood. While many studies have reported\na relationship between breastfeeding duration and\nweight in childhood, few others have reported this asso-\nciation in a young adult population. Also the current\nstudy provided evidence that WHtR may be a more sen-\nsitive outcome variable than BMI for studies that investi-\ngate the association between breastfeeding and weight\ndistribution or status. Finally, the current study demon-\nstrated both the utility of using genetic factors under-\nlying obesity as well as evaluating the robustness of the\nbreastfeeding association controlling for these factors.\nWe encourage future studies to investigate the mecha-\nnisms that may be responsible for the role of breastfeed-\ning on weight distribution.\nData availability statement\nAll data used in this study is publicly available at the Add\nHealth website: www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth.\nSupplementary information\nSupplementary information is available at BMC Public\nHealth's website.\nAdditional files\nAdditional file 1: Supplementary information.
