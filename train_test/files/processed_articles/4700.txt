    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe common stereotype of the inexpressive Asian, holding all emotions at bay, continues in our expectations of how Asian\ncouples relate in intimate relationships. There is also a widely held belief that Asian marriages embrace more covenant-\noriented commitments, compromising individual freedom and expression for the sake of harmony and integration of the\ncouple. The current study attempted to test these stereotypes among Koreans living in the United States and Native Koreans.\nResults indicated that the dominant culture significantly shapes the expression and importance of alexithymia among Koreans,\nbut when Koreans are a minority group, traditional beliefs may exert an even greater influence on the covenantal aspects of\nthe couple relationship. Most interestingly, couples with only one Korean member had very different results than the other\ngroups; most notably in a strong significant negative relationship between emotional intelligence and relationship satisfaction.\n",

From the Asian perspective, this rings hollow.\nIn particular, the Korean culture rests on a foundation of\n\"jeong.\" Jeong is a very difficult concept to translate but it\nstresses the emotional connections within intimate relation-\nships and is a central concern for Koreans, permeating one's\nprivate life (Kalton, 1994). This paper aims to explore the\ngap between stereotypes of Korean emotional experiences\nversus felt emotional experiences within the context of inti-\nmate relationships. In addition, we examined how emotional\nfactors may shift as a function of minority statues within\nanother culture.\nSome studies have demonstrated a negative relationship\nbetween alexithymia and intimate relationships. For exam-\nindividuals from clinical and student populations and\nassessed how alexithymia was linked to specific interper-\nsonal problems. They found that alexithymia was related to\ninterpersonal distance and nonassertive social functioning.\nIn addition, Humphreys, Woof, and Parker (2008) found that\nhigher levels of alexithymia predicted lower relationship sat-\nisfaction. Montebarocci, Codispoti, Baldaro, and Rossi\n(2003) found that alexithymia was positively related to dis-\ncomfort in intimacy. Finally, Hesse and Floyd (2008) found\nthat alexithymia was negatively related to affectionate expe-\nrience, happiness, nonverbal immediacy cues, affectionate\ncommunication, and closeness in intimate relationships.\nAccordingly, the Western idea of successful intimate rela-\ntionships includes both intense emotional experiences\nbetween partners and high emotional intelligence (EI). It has\nbeen assumed that non-Western cultures would also display\na strong positive relationship between relationship satisfac-\ntion and intense emotional awareness and encounters\nbetween the partners. However, there is virtually no data on\nnon-Western cultures to support such generalizations.\nAlthough alexithymia and EI are independent constructs,\nthere is a significant negative relationship between the two\nconstructs in the West. For instance, Parker, Taylor, and\nBagby (2001) compared EI scores with alexithymia levels\nand found that a significant negative relationship exists\nbetween the two constructs. However, it is possible that in\ncultures where harmonious social interactions and the subtle\nexpression of emotions are highly valued, the inability to\n1Howard University, Washington, DC, USA\n2Sahmyook University, Seoul, South Korea\nCorresponding Author:\nVictoria Lee, Howard University, University Counseling Service, 6th and\nEmail: Victoria.e.lee@howard.edu\nRelationship Satisfaction in Native\nKoreans and Korean Americans as a\nFunction of Alexithymia, Emotional\nIntelligence, and Marital Vows Orientation\nVictoria Lee1, Linda Berg-Cross1, and Kyung Hyun Suh2\n Keywords\nalexithymia, emotional intelligence, relationship satisfaction, marital vows orientation, Korean American couples\n2 SAGE Open\nexperience simple full-blown emotions and overtly express\nthem can serve as a facilitating factor in social interactions.\nTherefore, in Asian culture, the relationship between the two\nfactors may not be negatively correlated as reported by\nresearchers studying Western couples.\nAnother factor that may play a role in this complex link\nbetween culture and intimate relationships is the individuals'\nattitudes and values about marriage. Bromley and Bushing\n(1988) stated that two distinct types of social relationships\nexist; \"tribal\" (covenantal) and \"industrial\" (contractual),\nreflecting the difference in social relationships among col-\nlectivistic and individualistic cultures. Thus, the lack of emo-\ntional expression in a spouse may be tolerated less by an\nindividual who values self-actualization (contractual type)\nthan in a spouse who values vow-taking (covenantal type).\nAlso, individuals who see the dyad as the primary unit may\ninhibit emotional displays, which could disrupt the harmony\nwithin the relationship.\nMethod\nMeasures\nAll native Koreans were given scales that had been translated\nand back-translated. In addition to the demographic form,\nthe scales administered included the Toronto Alexithymia\nScale (Taylor et al., 1997), Assessing Emotions Scale\n(Schutte et al., 1998), Dyadic Adjustment Scale (Spanier,\n1976), and Marital Vows Scale (Ripley, Worthington,\nParticipants\nThirty-six Korean American couples had a mean age of 32\nand a mean relationship length of 7.89 years. The 45 married\nNative Korean couples had a mean age of 31 and a mean\nrelationship length of 11.1 years. The 9 Mixed-Culture cou-\nples consisted of 9 Korean American females, 8 Caucasian\nmales, and 1 African American male. These 9 couples had a\nyears.\nResults\nKorean American Couples\nOverall, EI was negatively correlated with alexithymia, r =\n-.37, p = .00. This indicated that individuals with higher EI\ntended to have lower alexithymia. Although the direction of\nthe relationship was similar to previously found results, the\ncorrelation appeared weaker, although not significantly\nweaker, than reported in previous research, r(24) = -.65\n(Schutte et al., 1998). EI was negatively correlated with dif-\nficulty identifying feelings, r = -.28, p = .02; difficulty\ndescribing feelings, r = -.39, p = .00; and externally oriented\nthinking, r = -.27, p = .02. EI was significantly correlated\nwith relationship satisfaction, r = .23, p = .05. Relationship\nsatisfaction was negatively correlated with alexithymia, r =\ndifficulty describing feeling, r = -.31, p = .01; and externally\noriented thinking, r =-.25, p =.03. Relationship satisfaction\nwas also significantly correlated with marital values, r = .41,\nNative Korean Couples\nOverall, EI was negatively correlated with alexithymia, r =\n-.58, p = .00. This finding was similar to previous research,\nlated with all three factors of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale\n(TAS-20): difficulty identifying feelings, r = -.48, p = .00;\ndifficulty describing feelings, r = -.51, p = .00; and exter-\nnally oriented thinking, r = -.48, p = .00.\nEI was significantly correlated with relationship satisfac-\ntion, r = .52, p = .00.

Relationship satisfaction was also signifi-\ncantly correlated with marital values, r = .30, p = .00. This\nindicates that individuals with more covenantal values\ntoward marriage reported being more satisfied in their\nrelationship.\nMixed-Culture Couples\nOverall, EI was negatively correlated with relationship satis-\nfaction, r = -.58, p = .00. No other significant relationships\nwere found among the variables.\nBetween-Group Analyses\nAn ANOVA indicated that the three groups had significantly\nDunnett's C post hoc test indicated that Native Korean cou-\nindicated the three groups differed significantly with regard\nHSD (Honestly Significant Difference) post hoc analysis\n(test of homogeneity of variance was significant only for this\nvariable) indicated that both Korean American (M = 125.42,\n9.65) were more emotionally intelligent than Native Korean\nAdjustment Scale indicated differences among the groups on\nC post hoc analysis indicated that Korean American couples\ntionship than the Native Korean couples (M = 104.96, SD =\n20.70).

Both were positively cor-\nrelated and statistically significant but the correlation\nbetween the two factors in Native Korean couples was sig-\nnificantly stronger (.23 vs. .52). Higher EI was a stronger\npredictor of relationship satisfaction in Native Korean cou-\nples than in Korean American couples.\nWhen Korean American couples were compared with\nMixed-Culture couples, the strength of the relationship\nbetween EI and relationship satisfaction was significantly\ndifferent as well, z = 3.14, p = .00. The direction of the rela-\ntionship was opposite for the two groups and both relation-\nships were statistically significant (.23 vs. -.58). Higher EI\nwas a predictor of lower relationship satisfaction in Mixed-\nCulture couples but in Korean Americans, higher EI pre-\ndicted higher relationship satisfaction. Similarly, Native\nKorean couples were also significantly different from Mixed-\nDiscussion\nKorean Americans\nThe Korean American couples' EI was inversely correlated\nwith alexithymia. Contrary to what we expected, the findings\non Korean Americans were similar to previous research. This\nfinding suggests that the relationship between EI and alexi-\nthymia generalizes across geographical/ethnic cultural\nboundaries.\nWithin Korean Americans, higher levels of alexithymia\nand lower EI predicted less relationship satisfaction. These\ntwo findings replicate previous research and suggest that an\nindividual's inability to get in touch with and communicate\nfeelings may result in not getting their needs met with their\npartners. This finding confirmed that within romantic rela-\ntionships, emotional factors are just as important in Korean\nAmerican couples as has been reported in EuropeanAmerican\ncouples. Perhaps, emotional control is more important for\nAsians in public and formal settings whereas more expres-\nsive, high-level emotional processing is valued among\nKorean Americans motivated to have positive intimate rela-\ntionships with their partner.\nIn regard to views about marriage, Korean Americans\nwith more covenantal views of marriage reported higher\nrelationship satisfaction than those who endorsed more con-\ntractual views of marriage. This suggests that viewing the\nrelationship as a whole rather than stressing individual\nhappiness promotes higher relationship satisfaction among\nKorean Americans. Perhaps, the emphasis on the dyad leads\nto a more tolerant attitude toward what is perceived as their\npartner's faults or interpersonal differences. Also, it is likely\nthat those who hold covenantal views on marriage have\nviews more consistent with collectivism or traditions. In\nturn, these individuals are more likely to put in the effort to\n\"make things work.\" This would lower the likelihood of mar-\nital distress and motivate the individuals to avoid the stigma\nof divorce within the community. Furthermore, when indi-\nviduals put in a great deal of effort to make things work, but\nfeel unsatisfied in their relationship, they will experience\ncognitive dissonance. To reduce this cognitive dissonance,\nthey may rationalize away many negative attitudes toward\ntheir partner to feel more satisfied in their relationships. The\noverall findings appear similar to previous research on\nEuropean Americans.\nNative Korean Couples\nThe Native Korean sample, which included 45 married\ncouples currently living in the Seoul metropolitan area in\nSouth Korea, yielded surprising results. It was hypothe-\nsized that emotional factors would have less of an impact or\ndifferentially impact the relationship satisfaction of Korean\ncouples living in Korea when compared with the previous\nfindings. On the contrary, results indicated similar findings\nto the previous research. Three of the four significant rela-\ntionships among the factors replicated the previous research.\nThis suggests that these emotional factors do have a similar\nimpact on intimate relationship beyond Western cultural\nboundaries.\nEI and alexithymia were negatively correlated, which\nindicates that individuals who are more emotionally intelli-\ngent tended to have lower levels of alexithymia. The direc-\ntion of the relationship was the same as previous research\nand the strength of the relationship was similar to previous\nresearch (Schutte et al., 1998). The results indicated that\nindividuals with higher EI tended to be more satisfied in their\nrelationships. This finding was also similar to previous find-\nings (Brackett, Warner, & Bosco, 2005; Smith, Ciarrochi, &\nstrong relationship between EI and relationship satisfaction\nfound among Native Koreans compared with Korean\nAmericans, suggests that contrary to Western stereotypes,\nemotional values and sensitivities are vibrant and forceful\namong a significant group of Native Koreans. On this one\nmeasure, emotional processing appears to permeate their cul-\ntural cognitive style. Also, individuals with higher levels of\nalexithymia tended to be less satisfied in their relationship,\nwhich is also consistent with previous research. It appears\nthat emotional functioning is important in intimate relation-\nships even in a culture where emotional restraint is valued\nfor the benefit of group harmony. What is most surprising is\nthat these results held true even though the group, as a whole,\n4 SAGE Open\nhad higher alexithymia levels than the Mixed-Culture cou-\nples and lower EI compared with other two groups.\nCovenantal views of marriage were linked to higher rela-\ntionship satisfaction in this group. More emphasis on the\ndyad seems to promote higher satisfaction.\nMixed-Culture Couples\nNo significant relationship between alexithymia and EI was\nfound among the Mixed-Culture sample. Their relationship\nbetween alexithymia and EI is moderated by some still\nunknown variables. Furthermore, the small sample size may\nhave contributed to the nonsignificant finding.\nOdder still is that EI and relationship satisfaction were\nnegatively correlated in the Mixed-Culture couples. This\nfinding is opposite to what was previously found (Schutte et\nal., 2001). Possibly, in Mixed-Culture relationships, the cul-\ntural differences are more pronounced for the emotionally\nintelligent partner, who is sensitive and aware of the nuances\nof cultural and emotional communications, but this aware-\nness is not necessarily related to acceptance. Indeed, high-EI\nindividuals may be hypersensitive to differences in commu-\nnication, rituals, values, and lifestyle.\nDiscussion\nSimilar to previous research, EI predicted the magnitude of\nrelationship satisfaction among individuals. However, the\ndegree and the direction of influence varied across groups.\nHigher EI was a significantly stronger predictor of relation-\nship satisfaction among Native Koreans compared with\nKorean Americans, most likely as a function of minority/\nmajority culture status. Possibly, minority couples (Korean\nAmericans) with high EI are sensitized to the stereotyped\nexpectations projected from the majority culture and/or\nintroject negative stereotypes about their inability to use EI;\nboth factors which could weaken the relationship between EI\nand relationship satisfaction. In addition, as a minority, eco-\nnomic success and worries may be contributing more to rela-\ntionship satisfaction and eroding some of the impact of EI.\nThe significantly stronger relationship found in Native\nKoreans between EI and relationship satisfaction should help\nrecast Western notions of the fabric of successful intimate\nrelationships among Asians.\nSurprisingly, in Mixed-Culture couples, an inverse rela-\ntionship was found between EI and relationship satisfaction.\nAlthough the sample size was small, the relationship was\nvery strong. When the relationship between EI and relation-\nship satisfaction was compared between Mixed-Culture cou-\nples and the other groups, higher EI was a predictor of lower\nrelationship satisfaction in Mixed-Culture couples; but it\npredicted higher relationship satisfaction in the other groups.\nThe most likely reason for this initially surprising finding is\nthat individuals from different ethnic backgrounds inevitably\nexperience cultural conflicts and difficulties with disparate\ncommunication styles. The higher their EI, the more likely\nthese conflicts and differences are to appear on one's radar\nscreen and prove to be an irritant. Perhaps lack of emotional\ninsight is protective in such situations and serves to reduce\nconflict. It may be a case where ignorance truly is bliss.\nOnly a few studies have examined Mixed-Culture cou-\nples and the findings are inconsistent. Some findings sug-\ngest they may be at more risk of relational dysfunction.\nexperience of individuals in interracial relationships. The\ncouples examined were African American\u00adEuropean\nAmerican. The results indicated that African American\npartners experienced more emotional sensitivity to the\nreactions of others regarding their relationship. Presumably,\nthis insight was more a burden than a blessing to the rela-\ntionship--again showing that EI may be of mixed value to\na relationship, depending on the most frequent emotional\ncues in the environment.\nFurthermore, these findings suggest that Mixed-Culture\ncouples are more at risk of relational dysfunction. Indeed,\nresearch indicates that 66% of interracial marriages end up\ndivorced (Gaines & Brennan, 2001), which is higher than the\nnational average.\nAnother difference found in the present study concerns\nthe couples' values orientation toward marriage. Analyses of\neach group revealed that having a covenantal view toward\nmarriage was predictive of relationship satisfaction in\nKorean\u00adKorean couples, irrespective of their country of resi-\ndence. The relationship between marital values orientation\nand relationship satisfaction was not found among Mixed-\nCulture couples. The most parsimonious explanation for this\nis that among Korean\u00adKorean couples, the more culturally\nconsistent, traditional views toward marriage are linked to an\nindividual's cultural/racial identity. Mixed couples, with a\nmore diverse ethnic identity have a harder time linking philo-\nsophical assumptions about marriage with their own rela-\ntionship satisfaction.\nUnlike EI, results indicated that the impact of alexithymia\non relationship satisfaction was pretty consistent across\nNative Koreans and Korean Americans. This pattern was not\nreplicated in the Mixed-Culture couples. Native Korean cou-\nples were found to be more alexithymic than Mixed-Culture\ncouples but no differences were found among Korean\u00ad\nKorean couples living in the United States and in Korea. This\nfinding is consistent with previous research (Dion, 1996; Le\nthis case Koreans, regardless of their country of residence,\nhave a higher level of alexithymia as measured by the current\nassessment.\nAnother surprising finding is that, in their orientation\ntoward marriage, Korean Americans tend to have more cov-\nenantal views about marriage than Koreans living in Korea.\nPossibly, identification with the stereotypes of marriage from\ntheir country of origin is a protective mechanism for those\nliving in a country as a minority.\nLee et al. 5\nIn summary, Koreans living in their country of origin con-\nfirm some Western stereotypes (e.g., alexithymia) and defy\nother stereotypes (e.g., underappreciating the strong Korean\nconnection between relationship satisfaction and EI) com-\npared with Korean Americans. Thus, a recently immigrated\ncouple from Korea may be less traditional than a Korean\nAmerican couple. If clinicians do not take such factors into\nconsideration, they may make an inaccurate conceptualiza-\ntion and risk damaging the therapeutic alliance.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBrackett, M.
