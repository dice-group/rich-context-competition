Excess body\nfat is associated with increased cardiometabolic risks in the\ngeneral population and in people with type 2 diabetes (2\u00ad4). BMI,\ncalculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared, has been\nused commonly to assess overall obesity in clinical settings and\npublic health surveys. However, because BMI does not measure\nbody fat directly and poorly distinguishes between fat mass and\nlean or bone mass, the use of BMI as an index of body fat for\na person may be inaccurate.\nDual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is one of the most\nwidely accepted methods to directly assess total and regional\nbody fat and fat-free mass (FFM), which includes lean soft issues\nand bone mineral (5). This technique is noninvasive and easily\napplicable to persons with and without diseases, and it yields\naccurate and reliable results (6). Percentage body fat (PBF),\nwhich is calculated as total body fat (TBF) divided by total mass\nmultiplied by 100, is a direct measure of a person's relative body\nfat. There exist significant differences in body fat across sex, age,\nand race-ethnicity (7).\nPrevious National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) studies have mainly assessed the distributions of\nanthropometric data (ie, weight, height, waist circumference, and\nskinfold thickness) and used BMI as an approximate index for\nrelative body fat. Although bioelectrical impedance analysis\n(BIA) was used to estimate body composition in the United States\nmay be inaccurate because it is not a direct method for the as-\nsessment of body composition (9, 10). Moreover, estimates of the\npercentile cutoffs of body composition may provide a reference\nfor the US population. To the best of our knowledge, there are no\npopulation-based quantitative estimates of means and percentile\ncutoffs of directly measured PBF, TBF, and FFM with DXA\namong adults in the United States thus far. The objectives of this\nstudy were 1) to analyze the DXA data from the NHANES\nand FFM by sex, age, race-ethnicity, and BMI and 2) to estimate\nsex-, age-, and race-ethnicity\u00adspecific percentile cutoffs of PBF,\nTBF, and FFM.\nMETHODS\nStudy design and population\nrecruited through the use of a complex, stratified, multistage\nprobability design to represent the noninstitutionalized civilian\nUS population.

Details about the plan and operation of the survey have\nbeen published (11). In the present study, we limited the anal-\nyses to men and nonpregnant women aged 20 y who had\ncomplete or imputed data on PBF, TBF, and FFM (n = 13,066).\nThe final sample represents adults aged 20 y in the United\nStates.\nDXA\nDetailed descriptions about the DXA data have been published\n(12, 13). In brief, whole-body DXA scans were administered in\nthe NHANES mobile examination center to eligible participants\nthe following conditions were excluded from the DXA exami-\nnation: 1) pregnancy assured by positive urine pregnancy test\nand/or by self-report at the time of the DXA examination, 2)\nself-reported history of radiographic contrast material (barium)\nuse in past 7 d, 3) self-reported nuclear medicine studies in the\nheight (.6 ft 5 in or 196 cm) in excess of the DXA table limit.\nThe DXA scans provided bone and soft tissue measurements for\nthe total body and regions (both arms and both legs, the trunk,\nand the head), including total mass (g), bone mineral content (g),\nbone area (cm2), bone mineral density (g/cm2), fat mass (g), and\nlean mass (g). Total PBF was calculated as TBF mass divided by\nWhole-body DXA scans were acquired with the use of\na Hologic QDR-4500A fan-beam densitometer (Hologic Inc,\nBedford, MA) with the Hologic DOC software (version 8.26:a3).\nThe participants wore paper gowns and were in a supine position\non the tabletop with their feet in a neutral position and hands flat\nby their sides. The DXA examinations were administered by\ncertified radiology technologists. The participants were scanned\nwith an X-ray source that used fan-beam scan geometry. The\nradiation exposure from DXA is extremely low (,10 lSv).\nHologic Discovery software (version 12.1) was used to analyze\nthe scans.\nQuality assurance and quality control of DXA scans\nA high-level quality control was maintained during the entire\nprocess of the DXA data collection and scan analysis. Staff from\nthe National Center for Health Statistics and the NHANES data\ncollection contractors monitored the acquisition performance of\nradiology technologists by in-person observations in the field.\nThe technologists were trained annually to reinforce correct\ntechniques and appropriate protocol. In addition, technologist\nperformance codes were recorded and tracked by the NHANES\nquality control center at the Department of Radiology of the\nUniversity of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Each participant\nand phantom scan was reviewed and analyzed by the UCSF with\nthe use of standard radiologic techniques and study-specific\nprotocols developed for NHANES. Expert review was conducted\nby the UCSF on all analyzed participant scans to verify the\naccuracy and consistency of the results.\nMultiple imputations\nBecause the validity of the DXA data were influenced by age,\nweight, and height, invalid and missing data could not be con-\nsidered a random subset of the original sample. To avoid bias due\nto nonrandom missing data, multiple imputations of the DXA\ndata were performed. With the exception of pregnant women and\nthose with amputations other than fingers or toes, all participants\nwith invalid or missing data were included in the multiple im-\nputation process.\nSAS-callable imputation and variance estimation software\n(IVEware), developed by the Survey Methodology Program at\nthe Institute of Survey Research, University of Michigan, was\nused to impute NHANES DXA data. The IVEware module\nIMPUTE performs multiple imputations of missing values with\nthe use of the sequential regression imputation method. Five\ncomplete records that contained valid and/or imputed values were\ncreated for each survey participant to allow the assessment of\nvariability due to imputation.

Race-ethnicity was self-reported and was classified\nas non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,\nand other race-ethnicity. Weight (kg) and height (cm) were\nmeasured with the use of standardized protocol and instruments\n(12).

The combined estimate of PBF, TBF, and FFM from all 5\nanalyses was the mean of the 5 individual estimates (15, 16).

Our results clearly showed that women had, on average,\n'12% higher PBF, 5 kg greater TBF, and 18 kg less FFM than\nmen, and the differences persisted across 4 BMI categories.\nThere were relatively small, but statistically significant, differ-\nences in PBF, TBF, and FFM by race-ethnicity and age group.\nWhole-body DXA scans were not administered in the\nNHANES mobile examination center until in 1999.

Similar to previous findings in children, young\nadults, and adults (8, 9, 17\u00ad20), women in this study generally\nhad greater estimated mean PBF and TBF than men. Our esti-\nmates, with a large population-based sample and DXA, conform\nto previous results with smaller samples or less accurate methods\nand provide reliable quantitative estimates of the difference in\nPBF and TBF between men and women. BMI has been used\nwidely to define overall obesity in both pediatric and adult\npopulations because of its simplicity, clinical availability, strong\nassociation with health risks and consequences, and high cor-\nrelation with PBF (14, 21, 22), although it has been considered\nan inaccurate measure of body fat. To date, the universal cutoffs\nobesity in both men and women (14). A recent study has shown\nthat BMI corresponds adequately well with PBF by sex and age\nsubgroups (22). However, in agreement with previous findings\n(7, 8), our results suggest that a man and a woman may have\na similar BMI but his or her relative or absolute body fat may\ndiffer appreciably.\nNote that the differences in PBF and TBF across age and race-\nethnic groups were more pronounced among men and women\nwith a BMI ,25 than among those with a BMI 25. Our results\nare consistent with the findings of a previous study (23) in which\nthe researchers showed that mean values of PBF in the normal\nand overweight BMI groups were higher in older women than in\nyounger women. Decrease in muscle density and increase in the\naccumulation of body fat mass with age (24, 25) may partially\nexplain the differences in PBF between the younger and older\nadults.\nConsistent with other reports (8, 17\u00ad19), our results that non-\nHispanic blacks had smaller mean PBF than non-Hispanic whites\nacross all BMI categories in both men and women suggest that\nracial-ethnic variations in body composition may exist. However,\nin comparison with differences in PBF between men and women\n(12%), differences in PBF between non-Hispanic whites and non-\nHispanic blacks across each category of BMI ('1.4\u00ad3.2%) were\nrelatively small in this study. It is unclear whether such small,\nalbeit statistically significant, racial-ethnic differences in PBF\nmay have clinical or public health significance in the diagnosis,\nassessment, prediction, and prevention of obesity-related dis-\norders. Future research is warranted to assess the sex and ethnic\nvariations in the association between PBF and cardiometabolic\nrisks.\nThe estimated percentile cutoffs of PBF, TBF, and FFM at\ncommonly used percentiles by race-ethnicity and age in men and\nwomen may provide a useful reference in clinical settings and\npublic health services. The equations provided in this article\ncould be used to estimate a person's relative and absolute body fat\naccording to his or her sex, age, race-ethnicity, body weight,\nheight, BMI, and triceps skinfold thickness. Our equations are\nsimple and have a predictive validity that is similar to or better\nthan the equations generated in previous studies (26\u00ad29). To date,\nthere is no agreement about the optimal cutoff of PBF for\noverweight and obesity. Our data suggest that the cutoffs of PBF\ncorresponded approximately to the mean PBF in the BMI cat-\ncentile for men (32%) and women (45%) corresponded\napproximately to the mean PBF in the BMI category of 30234.\nThe cutoffs of PBF at the 90th percentile for men (36%) and\nwomen (48%) corresponded approximately to the mean PBF in\nthe BMI category of 35. Future studies may be needed to\ndetermine sex-specific cutoffs of PBF in relation to car-\ndiometabolic risk factors, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular\ndisease morbidity and mortality.\nInterpretation of our results is subject to 2 limitations. First,\nalthough DXA has been validated by the 4-compartment model\nand has been considered a reliable, accurate, and convenient\nmethod for the assessment of body composition, it has not been\nestablished as a \"gold standard\" for PBF because of variations\nwith different manufacturers and beam configurations (30). Thus,\ncaution is warranted when our results are compared with the\nfindings of other studies. Second, multiply imputed data for\nparticipants with missing or invalid body-composition data\n(weighted %: 18.2%) may not perfectly represent the actual\nvalues. However, a large number of variables, including de-\nmographic, socioeconomic, and geographic variables, body\nmeasurements, health status, dietary intake, use of medications,\nblood test results, and variables related to the NHANES design,\nwere included in the imputation models (15); therefore, the effect\nof imputed data on the validity of the body composition estimates\ncould be minimal.\nEquations for the estimation of percentage body fat (PBF), total body fat (TBF), and fat-free mass (FFM) according to\ndemographic characteristics and anthropometric measures\nEquation R2\n(if African American) + 0.97 (if Mexican American) +\nor FFM ' weight (kg) \u00ad TBF\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nIn conclusion, by using DXA data from a nationally repre-\nsentative sample, we described the distributions and showed the\ndifferences in body composition by sex, age, race-ethnicity, and\nBMI categories. Our results highlighted the large sex differences\nand relatively small differences in PBF, TBF, and FFM by age and\nrace-ethnicity across different BMI categories. Because direct\nmeasurement of body composition with the use of DXA is ex-\npensive, the estimated percentiles of PBF, TBF, and FFM in\nconjunction with the estimation equations according to de-\nmographic characteristics and simple anthropometric measures\ncould be helpful to clinicians and researchers when they assess\nthe relative and absolute body fat of their patients or study\nparticipants.\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--CL, ESF, GZ, LSB, and\nWHG: study concept and design; CL and ESF: acquisition of data; CL,\nESF, GZ, LSB, and WHG: analysis and interpretation of data; CL: draft\nof manuscript; CL, ESF, GZ, LSB, and WHG: critical revision of the man-\nuscript for important intellectual content; CL and ESF: statistical analysis;\nESF and LSB: administrative, technical, or material support; and ESF: study\nsupervision.
