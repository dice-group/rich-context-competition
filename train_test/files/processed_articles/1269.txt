We analyzed\nthe association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D\n(25OHD) and BP to determine whether low 25OHD ex-\nplains any of the increased BP in blacks.\nMethods: The Third US National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III) is a cross-sectional\nsurvey representative of the US civilian population during\naged 20 years with measurements of BP and 25OHD,\nafter excluding those on hypertensive medication.\nResults: Adjusted mean serum 25OHD was lowest in\nnon-Hispanic blacks (49 nmol/L), intermediate in Mexican\nAmericans (68 nmol/L), and highest in non-Hispanic\nwhites (79 nmol/L). When participants were divided into\n25OHD quintiles, mean (standard error) systolic BP was\nhighest quintile (25OHD 85.7 nmol/L) compared with\nthe lowest (25OHD 40.4 nmol/L), adjusting for age, sex,\nethnicity, and physical activity. Further adjustment for\nbody mass index (BMI) weakened the inverse association\nbetween 25OHD and BP, which remained significant for\nsystolic BP (P  .05). The inverse association between\n25OHD and systolic BP was stronger in participants aged\n50 years than younger (P  .021). Ethnic differences in\n25OHD explained about half of the increased hypertension\nprevalence in non-Hispanic blacks compared with whites.\nConclusions: Vitamin D status, which is amenable to\nintervention by safely increasing sun exposure or vitamin\nD supplementation, was associated inversely with BP in a\nlarge sample representative of the US population.

The\ncurrent article analyzes a larger sample of NHANES III\nparticipants (both fasting and nonfasting) to increase sta-\ntistical power, after excluding those on treatment for hy-\npertension to avoid possible bias from treatment effects.\nThe specific aims are to examine: (1) whether vitamin D is\ninversely related to both systolic and diastolic BP; and, if\nso, (2) whether ethnic differences in vitamin D status\nexplain any ethnic difference in BP.\nMethods\nThe NHANES III is a cross-sectional survey representa-\ntive of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population\nHealth Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention. A stratified, multistage sampling design was\nused to recruit participants from household clusters, with\noversampling of non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Amer-\nicans. After an initial interview at home, participants vis-\nited mobile centers, where they had an extensive physical\nexamination. Full details of all survey methods, including\nsampling, interview, examination, laboratory measure-\nment of blood samples, ethical approval, and informed\nconsent, have been published.17\nStudy Population\ntake part in the survey. Of these 18,825 were interviewed\nat home, 16,573 of whom attended mobile examination\ncenters. In the home interview, information was collected\non a wide range of variables including: age, sex, ethnicity\n(self-assigned as either non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, Mexican American, other), past history of ever\nbeing told by a physician or other health professional of\nhaving hypertension, and the number of times a range of\ncommon physical activities was undertaken in leisure time\nduring the previous month.17 Metabolic equivalents\n(MET) were assigned for each physical activity, and par-\nticipants aged 60 years were classified as doing moder-\nate or vigorous activities if the MET for any activity was\nyears were similarly classified if the MET for any activity\nAt the mobile examination centers, participants were\ndressed in underpants, disposable light clothing, and slip-\npers while being weighed on electronic scales in kilo-\ngrams, to two decimal places. Height was measured with\na fixed stadiometer to the nearest millimeter.17 Body mass\nindex (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms di-\nvided by the square of height in meters. The date of the\nexamination, by calendar month, was used to account for\nseasonal variation in sun exposure.\nBlood pressure was measured at the mobile examina-\ntion centers by physicians with mercury sphygmomanom-\neters using a standard protocol.17 Up to three measurements\nwere collected from each participant while in the sitting\nposition, and if more than two measurements were col-\nlected, the last two were averaged. Systolic BP was de-\nfined as the point at which the first Korotkoff sound was\nheard; the diastolic BP was the level of mercury 2 mm\nbelow where the last sound was heard. Hypertension was\nPulse pressure was calculated as the difference between\nsystolic and diastolic pressures.19\nBlood samples collected during the examination were\ncentrifuged, aliquoted, and frozen to 70\u00b0C on site, and\nshipped on dry ice to central laboratories where they were\nmeasured by a radioimmunoassay kit after extraction with\nacetonitrile (DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN) by the National\nCenter for Environmental Health, CDC, Atlanta, GA.

PROC\nREGRESS was used to calculate adjusted means and\nregression coefficients, whereas PROC CROSSTAB was\nused to calculate adjusted relative risks.\nResults\nAdjusted mean serum 25OHD concentrations varied be-\ntween categories of demographic and lifestyle variables\n(Table 1). Vitamin D was higher in men than in women\nand declined with increasing age. With regard to ethnicity,\nvitamin D was lowest in non-Hispanic blacks, intermedi-\nate in Mexican Americans, and highest in non-Hispanic\nwhites. Mean level of 25OHD decreased with increasing\nBMI quintile. Vitamin D concentrations were lowest in\nparticipants who did no leisure-time physical activity dur-\ning the previous month, compared with those who were\nphysically active, and increased in a stepwise fashion with\nincreasing frequency of activity. The expected seasonal\nvariation in 25OHD was also present, with levels being\nlowest in January to April and highest in July to October,\nafter adjusting for covariates. Mean serum 25OHD was\nsimilar for participants who had ever been told by a\nphysician they had hypertension, but were not on current\nantihypertensive medication, and those who had never\nbeen told they have hypertension, indicating that this vari-\nable was not related to vitamin D status. Hence, it was not\nadjusted for in further analyses.\nMean BP varied inversely with vitamin D status, with\nsystolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure each being signifi-\ncantly (P  .05) lower in the highest quintile of serum\n25OHD (85.7 nmol/L) compared with the lowest quin-\ntile (40.4 nmol/L) after adjusting for age, sex, ethnic-\nity, and leisure-time physical activity (Table 2).\nHowever, further adjustment for BMI attenuated BP dif-\nferences; therefore, only systolic BP and pulse pressure\nvaried significantly (P  .05) between vitamin D quintiles\n(Table 2). In contrast, adding serum calcium to the model\nhad little effect on the BP differences between vitamin D\nquintiles, indicating that the inverse association between\nserum 25OHD and BP is independent of serum calcium.\nMean serum 25OHD levels did not vary (P  .09) be-\nnmol/L), adjusting for age, sex, and ethnicity, indicating\nthat cases and controls had overlapping 25OHD distribu-\ntions.\nPossible effect modification of the relationship between\nBP and serum 25OHD was examined with multiple re-\ngression analyses using BP as a continuous variable. In-\nverse associations between BP and 25OHD existed in\nall ethnic groups.

Regression\nmodels were run with serum 25OHD and a product term of\n25OHD times a dummy variable for age (50 years  1,\ninversely associated with both systolic and diastolic BP\nbut not with pulse pressure (P  .56). In addition, there\nwere significant (P  .05) negative age interactions for\nsystolic BP and pulse pressure, indicating that these two\nmeasures of BP decreased more with increasing 25OHD in\npeople 50 years of age compared with younger partici-\npants. Calculations based on these coefficients indicate\nTable 1.

Within\neach gender, non-Hispanic blacks had higher age-adjusted\nsystolic and diastolic BPs than Mexican Americans and\nnon-Hispanic whites, whereas Mexican Americans had\nBPs similar to non-Hispanic whites, except for a higher\nsystolic BP in women. Mean pulse pressure was also\nhigher in non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans\ncompared with non-Hispanic whites.\nThe contribution of ethnic differences in vitamin D\nstatus to the ethnic variations in systolic BP is shown in\nFigs. 1 and 2. The mean difference in systolic BP was 3.5\nmm Hg among non-Hispanic blacks and 1.4 mm Hg\namong Mexican Americans compared with non-Hispanic\nwhites, after adjusting for age and sex. When quintile of\nvitamin D or BMI was added to the model, the mean\ndifference in systolic BP among non-Hispanic blacks de-\ncreased more for 25OHD (to 2.1 mm Hg) than for BMI (to\n2.7 mm Hg), indicating that ethnic variations in vitamin D\nexplained more of the increased systolic BP in non-His-\npanic blacks (about one-third) than ethnic differences in\nBMI, which explained about one-fifth. When both vitamin\nD and BMI were adjusted for, the mean difference (1.9\nmm Hg) was similar to adjusting for vitamin D alone,\nindicating that their effects were not additive. The same\npattern was seen for diastolic BP and pulse pressure (data\nnot shown). In contrast, the addition of vitamin D and BMI\nto the model had similar effects on the difference in BP\nbetween Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites,\nand their effects were additive, as there was only a very\nTable 2.

Although the differences\nwe observed in BP between vitamin D quintiles are small,\nthe random measurement error arising from measuring BP\nat a single interview, and from a single measurement of\nvitamin D status using a blood sample collected at the\nsame interview, is likely to have resulted in attenuation of\nthe observed association between these two variables.20\nFIG. 2.

The reduced serum 25OHD level for\nparticipants in the high BMI quintiles (Table 1) is proba-\nbly due to sequestering of vitamin D within the increased\nfat mass of obese people.24 However, there is also evi-\ndence that low vitamin D status, by causing parathyroid\nhormone (PTH) excess and calcium influx into adipocytes,\nmay promote weight gain.25\nIn addition to the possibility of random measurement\nerror weakening the observed inverse association between\nserum 25OHD and BP, other limitations of this study\ninclude its cross-sectional design, which cannot separate\ncause and effect, and the possibility of other lifestyle\nvariables (in addition to physical activity and obesity)\nassociated with vitamin D status, confounding the associ-\nation between vitamin D and BP.\nAlthough our findings are consistent with previous\nstudies of ultraviolet B radiation and BP,7,8 they contrast\nwith some previous observational studies of dietary vita-\nmin D, which provides only part of the supply to humans.\nThe oral vitamin D studies have shown inconsistent re-\nsults, with an inverse association being observed between\nsystolic BP and oral intake of vitamin D in Iowa womens26\nbut not in a recent analysis of three US cohorts.27 Supple-\nmentation with a vitamin D analog (-calcidol) has been\nshown to lower BP in patients with impaired glucose\ntolerance in Sweden,28 but supplementation with vitamin\ndid not lower BP in elderly men and women in\nEngland.29 The likely explanation for the failure of the\nlatter study to lower BP may be insufficient change of\nvitamin D in the treated group. For example, the English\nnmol/L.29 In contrast, 25OHD levels more than doubled\nGerman study, which observed a significant reduction in\nboth systolic BP and pulse rate.30\nAge- and gender-adjusted mean BPs were higher in\nnon-Hispanic blacks than in Mexican Americans and non-\nHispanic whites, consistent with results from the first\nethnic differences in vitamin D status explained about half\nof the increased prevalence of hypertension in non-His-\npanic blacks, compared with non-Hispanic whites, sup-\nports the previous suggestion that low vitamin D levels in\nnon-Hispanic blacks may be a factor in their increased\nhypertension prevalence.10,11 Ethnic differences in BMI\nalso made a small contribution to the increased risk of\nhypertension in both non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican\nAmericans compared with non-Hispanic whites. Other\nlifestyle factors not analyzed in this article, such as low\nintake of potassium and high intake of sodium, may\ncontribute to the increased BP levels in non-Hispanic\nblacks,31 whereas the contribution of genetic factors to\nethnic differences is probably modest compared with the\nrole of lifestyle.32\nIn summary, we have found increased systolic BP in\npeople with low serum 25OHD levels in a representative\nUS sample. This finding may have public health signifi-\ncance, as vitamin D levels can easily, and cheaply, be\nincreased by a modest increase in sun exposure or vitamin\nD supplementation. However, first it needs to be con-\nfirmed by large, well-designed intervention studies.\n"
