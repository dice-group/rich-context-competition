The four communities are grantees of the\nCommunity  ,\na national initiative of the Robert Wood Johnson\nFoundation that fosters local partnerships to improve\nlong-term care and supportive-services systems in order\nto meet the current and future needs of older adults.\nDesign and Methods: We examined community partner-\nship approaches to governance and management, as\nwell as evidence of the partnerships' influence in their\ncommunities, by using the conceptual framework of the\ncommunity health partnerships typology developed by\nShannon M. Mitchell and Stephen Shortell. Results:\nAddressing governance and management issues was\ncritical to the early evolution of community partnerships\nfor older adults. Early partnership experiences, particu-\nlarly with regard to local funders and media, provide\nevidence of emerging centrality (importance and in-\nfluence in the community), which forecasts sustainability.\nObservation over a longer period is needed in order to\nsee whether early successes will be sustained, particu-\nlarly once original grant funding ends. Implications:\nCommunity partnerships for older adults can become\ninfluential positive forces but must invest in adequate\ngovernance and management structures early on.\nKey Words: Community partnerships,\nPartnership governance, Partnership management,\nPartnership sustainability, Long-term care systems\nCommunity Partnerships for Older Adults\n(CPFOA), a national program of the Robert Wood\nJohnson Foundation, was created in order to improve\nlong-term care and supportive-services systems for\nolder adults through local community-based partner-\nships. CPFOA seeks to strengthen local service-delivery\ninfrastructure for the coming age boom by supporting\npartnerships that typically include older adults, health\nand social service providers, Area Agencies on Aging,\ngovernment and business leaders, and local funders.\nResearchers expect that the work undertaken by these\npartnerships will expand social capital and increase\ncommunities' sense of collective efficacy (Bolda, Lowe,\nMaddox, & Patnaik, 2005). CPFOA partnerships are\ndesigned to illustrate how collaborative efforts in\ndiverse communities can generate social capital in\norder to improve access to affordable quality care for\nolder adults through sensitive response to the needs of\ndiverse populations, good ideas about care that can be\nimproved through the cooperation of diverse service\nSeveral of the examples in this article were first presented at ``A\nFramework for Learning With and About Community Partnerships,''\na Presidential Symposium at the 57th Annual Scientific Meeting of The\nGerontological Society of America, November 21, 2004, in Washington,\nDC.

Participation in partnerships, in fact,\nconstitutes an important initial experience of organ-\nizations in finding commonalities in community values,\nin identifying new community leadership, and in\nexperiencing the enhanced effectiveness of organiza-\ntions that choose to emphasize commitment to shared\ncommunity objectives. Grantee communities also have\ncommitted to national dissemination of their experi-\nences in order to help other communities across the\ncountry develop and expand partnerships working on\nbehalf of older adults.\nIn 2004, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\nawarded 8 community partnerships with 4-year im-\nimplementation of community strategic plans that\nhad been prepared in an earlier planning cycle. The\neight communities were: Atlanta, GA; Boston, MA;\nBroome County, NY; El Paso, TX; Harris County, TX;\nMaui, HI; Milwaukee County, WI; and San Francisco,\nCA. Each community brought to the national program\na unique sociodemographic and historical context, and\neach community had developed its own goals and\nobjectives through a local planning process. Neverthe-\nless, all grantees had a common goal of sustaining their\nefforts beyond the grant period.\nThe National Program Office at the Muskie School\nof Public Service, University of Southern Maine,\nprovides program direction. The Duke University\nLong-Term Care Resources Program oversees technical\nassistance to grantees and facilitates cross-site dissem-\nination through teaching and learning, in which\ngrantees are encouraged to take progressively increas-\ning responsibility for sharing expertise and learning\namong themselves and with other communities. The\nprogram uses various approaches in order to foster\nteaching and learning. These include frequent tele-\nconferences; annual in-person meetings of all grantees;\nan interactive Web site through which grantees can\nengage in virtual discussion and post resources for\none another; an electronic resource center\n(www.cpfoa.org), where experience is codified for the\nbenefit of others; and ad hoc grantee gatherings at\nmeetings of national associations, such as The Geron-\ntological Society of America, the National Association\nof Area Agencies on Aging, and the American Society\non Aging/National Council on the Aging.\nConceptual Framework\nEarly on, CPFOA introduced grantee partnerships to\na conceptual framework of community health part-\nnerships developed by Mitchell and Shortell (2000).\nAfter an exhaustive literature review, Mitchell and\nShortell concluded that (a) despite the growing\npopularity of community health partnerships, they\noften fail to achieve measurable results or sustain\nthemselves; and (b) problems related to governance and\nmanagement frequently contribute to their failure.\nernance of community partnerships ``as being primarily\nconcerned with positioning the partnership relative to\nthe external environment within which it operates.''\nGovernance includes establishing a partnership's stra-\ntegic priorities, determining membership composition,\nobtaining necessary resources, and providing account-\nability to the community. Mitchell and Shortell de-\nscribed management as being concerned primarily with\nexecution or implementation of the direction estab-\nlished by the governance body of a partnership.\nManagement functions include managing communica-\ntion, conflict, external links, and change over time.\nA significant challenge for community partnerships\nis understanding that the ``right'' governance and\nmanagement structures are not universal. They are\nhighly contextual and must fit the history, social dy-\nnamics, politics, and resources of a given community.\nIn a community that enjoys a long tradition of suc-\ncessful collaboration in the context of informal gov-\nernance structures, a more formal structure may fail\nbecause it does not honor tradition. However, if that\ncommunity partnership were trying to address a more\ndifficult and controversial problem than it ever had in\nthe past, it may need to adopt a more formal structure\nthat is easily understood in the community and\nenhances accountability.\nIf a partnership adopts effective governance and\nmanagement structures appropriate to its local context,\nit is more likely to attain centrality, which Mitchell and\na partnership ``becomes institutionalized and pivotal to\nthe life of the community.'' Centrality, in turn, is a likely\npredictor of sustainability. As applied to CPFOA grant-\nees, the expectation is that as a partnership becomes\ncentral to its community on aging issues, its visibility\nand influence rise and more stakeholders want to be\nassociated with the partnership, further adding to its\ninfluence and expanding the sense of collective efficacy in\nthe community. Furthermore, it is expected that local\nfunders and decision makers will pay increasing at-\ntention to the partnership as a vehicle for effective\ncollaboration as the partnership's centrality increases.\nThis article describes how four CPFOA grantees,\nlike community health partnerships before them, have\nstruggled with issues of governance and management\nand have responded by adopting governance and\nmanagement structures unique to their local needs.\nWe should note that this is not a comprehensive case\nstudy, but rather a brief analysis of early experiences\nof selected CPFOA grantees. At this early phase of\nthe grant cycle, each partnership can point to early\nindicators of centrality, suggesting that sustainability is\nan attainable goal.\nOverview of Four Grantees\nCPFOA implementation grantees shared certain\nmandatory characteristics in order to be selected by\nthe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. They each re-\npresented broad community partnerships that included\nolder adults, social service and health providers, gov-\nernment agencies, advocacy organizations, and other\nlocal stakeholders in long-term care and supportive\nservices. They had each demonstrated success working\nin partnership prior to becoming grantees, and their\ncommunities each had in place adequate community-\nbased services infrastructure that served as a foundation\nfor greater partnership efforts. Each grantee had to\nselect a fiscal agent to accept and manage grant funds\nfor the partnership, and each partnership had to\ndesignate a core leadership group.\nBeyond these requirements, CPFOA was designed to\nencourage unique local partnerships that responded to\nthe needs of their communities. The result was a group\nof grantees with a variety of approaches to governance\nand management. We have drawn examples from four\ndiverse grantee communities in order to illustrate the\nrange. Representatives from the four partnerships\n(Boston, Harris County, Milwaukee County, and El\nPaso) presented their early experiences in a Presidential\nSymposium at the 57th Annual Scientific Meeting of\nThe Gerontological Society of America, November 21,\n2004, in Washington, DC. We have based this article on\nthat panel discussion (``A Framework for Learning\nWith and About Community Partnerships'') and on\nadditional information gathered by the CPFOA Na-\ntional Program Office through site visits, technical\nassistance teleconferences, reports and materials sub-\nmitted by partnerships, grantee extranet postings, and\nindividual conversations with partnership leaders.\nA Diverse Group of Communities\nTable 1 provides an overview of the four community\npartnerships and illustrates the unique characteristics\nof each.\nBoston is one of the nation's oldest cities, with\na formal social services infrastructure dating back to\ncolonial alms houses. This city of 16 distinct neigh-\nborhoods is well known for its lively politics and fierce\ncompetition among provider agencies. The city is\nculturally diverse, with more than half of its population\nidentifying with one of several minority groups. The\ncity is small geographically (48.4 square miles) and has\nan extensive public transportation system that makes it\nrelatively easy to live in the city without a car. Harris\nCounty is huge by comparison, encompassing the city\nof Houston (the nation's fourth largest city) and 40\nadditional municipalities in a geographic area the size\nof Rhode Island with relatively little public trans-\nportation infrastructure. Harris County also enjoys rich\nethnic and cultural diversity, particularly among\nyounger residents. Most of the county's older residents\nare White. Social service agencies operate largely\nindependently of one another, with little history of\nformal partnership. Nearly 700 miles to the west is El\nPaso, a relatively poor and geographically isolated\nborder city with Mexico to the south and New Mexico\nto the north. El Paso's SALSA partnership (Successful\nAging through Long-term Strategic Alliances) reflects\nthe demographics of the area, where two thirds of older\nadults are Hispanic/Latino, and an unknown number\nare Mexican immigrants with questionable legal status.\nHaving operated for many years in what partnership\nleaders describe as a ``culture of need,'' El Paso\ncommunity organizations have a long history of\ninformal collaboration to stretch thin resources. In\nMilwaukee County, the county government plays\na much more active role in the financing and delivery\nof services than do the local governments in the other\nthree partnerships. Milwaukee is Wisconsin's largest\nand most diverse urban county, comprising the city of\nMilwaukee and 18 suburban municipalities. The\ncounty has for many years led and participated in\nmultiple collaborative efforts and has naturally evolved\nto a decentralized model of partnership in which the\nlocus of control depends on the specific activity. Like\nBoston, the city of Milwaukee is often characterized\nas a collection of distinct neighborhoods, and politics\nare often rough and tumble.\nGoverning a Community Partnership\nOne of the functions of governance is to establish the\nsize and composition of the partnership, which includes\ndetermining the type of organizations and individuals\ndesired for membership, defining the obligations and\nbenefits of membership, and potentially creating mem-\nbership tiers in order to accommodate different levels\nof interest and contribution. CPFOA experience to date\nsuggests that addressing size and composition issues\nclearly and openly can help partnerships avoid or over-\ncome conflict and equity concerns. In Harris County's\nCare for Elders partnership (in Houston), early tensions\nsurfaced about the widely varying levels of cash and in-\nkind commitments made across members. The partner-\nship's primary governance document--its operating\nguidelines--addressed the issue directly by specifying\nlevels of membership corresponding to contributions\nmade and whether an organization had a founding role\nin the partnership. Level of membership in turn\ndetermines member's formal position in a multileveled\ngovernance structure that includes the fiscal agent's\nboard of directors, the partnership governing council,\nand multiple workgroups. The Care for Elders partner-\nship also recognized that an original composition\nrestriction (i.e., that members have nonprofit status)\nexcluded many of the government, media, and housing-\nsector partners it had desired. Therefore, the partner-\nship altered the composition rules in order to encourage\nbroader participation. Care for Elders also wanted to\nincrease participation among individual older adults\nand caregivers. It created a separate consumer advisory\ncouncil and empowered it to appoint four of its\nmembers to the overall governing council. The\noperating guidelines (as opposed to a formal charter\nand bylaws) articulated each of these structures in part\nbecause Care for Elders does not have its own legal\ncorporate status and the partnership's fiscal agent is\na member of the partnership in its own right. Having\noperating guidelines satisfied the need for clear\ndefinition of the partnership's composition and scope\nwithout requiring the fiscal agent to alter dramatically\nthe fiscal agent's own governance documents.\nEl Paso's SALSA partnership also addressed compo-\nsition of membership early in its evolution. With a long\nhistory of informal collaboration among key partners,\nTable 1. Characteristics of Four Community Partnerships for Older Adults Grantees\nBoston Partnership for Older\nAdults (BPOA)\nCare for Elders Milwaukee County's Connecting\nCaring Communities Partnership\nSuccessful Aging through\nLong-Term Strategic\nAlliances Partnership (SALSA)\nLocation City of Boston, MA Harris County, TX Milwaukee County, WI El Paso County, TX\nIllustrative\nmembership\nBPOA has more than 100 organizations\nand 200 individuals, representing\nmajor medical centers, several\nmunicipal departments, including the\nBoston Police Department, several\nstate agencies, key social service\nagencies, representatives from district\nattorneys and attorneys general offices,\nolder adults, care partners, advocacy,\nand special interest organizations,\ncommunity health centers, and\nprivate businesses.\nCare for Elders comprises 87\npartners, with individual\nand organizational members\nacross public, nonprofit,\nand private agencies, funding\norganizations, health care\nsystems, advocacy, and special\ninterest organizations, academic\ninstitutions, business, media,\nand long-term-care\nservice providers.\nMilwaukee's Connecting Caring\nCommunities Partnership has more\nthan 125 representatives of social\nservices, health care systems, private\nindustry, the public sector (county\nand state government entities,\nincluding schools, the police\ndepartment, and district attorneys),\nacademic institutions, advocacy and\nspecial interest associations, faith-based\norganizations, and older adults and\ntheir caregivers.\nSALSA has more than 40 members\nrepresenting 24 organizations,\nincluding city, county, and state\nagencies; educational institutions;\nconsumers; local foundations;\nnonprofit and for-profit providers\nof health, mental health, housing,\nand social services; advocacy and\nspecial interest associations; and\nfaith-based organizations.\nPartnership\nvision\n. . . a comprehensive and accessible\nsystem of community support for\nBoston's older adults.\n. . . for Harris County to be a\ncommunity where older adults\nare understood, valued,\nrespected, and given every\nopportunity to choose the\nsetting and conditions in\nwhich they age.\n. . . that stakeholders will work together\nto improve the care and services\navailable to older adults, resulting in a\ncommunity where older people are\nable to draw upon and contribute to\nthe resources of their neighbor-hoods\nand the community. When older\npeople need long-term care, it will be\navailable, accessible, afford-able, and\nof high quality.\n. . . to build an easily accessible,\nintegrated, and responsive\nlong-term-care and\nsupportive-services system.\nImplementation\nof goals, as of\nGoals address four broad substantive\npriority areas: health care, housing\nand homelessness, social services\nand mental and cognitive health.\nSpecific goals encompass: centralized\naccess to information; data collection\nand analysis; advocacy; business\npartnerships; public education;\nworkforce development; accessible\ntransportation; and coordinated and\ntargeted funding.\nGoal is to improve access,\navailability, affordability,\nand quality in local\nlong-term-care services\nand systems.\nGoals are: to increase awareness about\nlong-term care within Milwaukee\nCounty, specifically, awareness\nresources, access points, relevance to\neveryone, and how it is paid for. To\nfoster new models of collaboration\namong older adult service providers\nand long-term-care stakeholders to\n(a) improve caregiver retention rates\nand (b) develop the capacity of\nagencies to efficiently and effectively\nmeet the needs of older adults. To\nimprove the elder-friendliness of the\nLayton Boulevard neighborhood,\ncreating a visible Corridor of Aging\nexcellence. To ensure that Sherman\nPark's older adults feel safe in, and\nconnected to, their neighborhood.\nGoals are: to establish a ``no-wrong\ndoor'' system of access; to\nincrease the prevention\ncomponent of long-term-care\nand supportive-service\nproviders; and to leverage\npublic and private resources\nto enhance choices for\nconsumers, particularly for\nself-directed care.\nGovernance\napproach\nFormal: Board of Directors makes\ndecisions in accordance with\nbylaws.\nFormal: Governing Council\nmakes decisions in\naccordance with\noperating guidelines.\nInformal: Core Leadership Group of\noriginal partners meets bimonthly\nto monitor progress and foster\ncoordination.\nInformal: Executive Committee of\noriginal partners plus funders\noperates by consensus.\nFiscal agent Veronica B. Smith Multi-Service\nSenior Center\nSheltering Arms Senior\nServices\nMilwaukee County Department on\nAging (Area Agency on Aging)\nRio Grande Area Agency on Aging\nSALSA did not experience the membership tensions\nthat were evident in Harris County's Care for Elders\npartnership. However, SALSA did recognize that it\nwould need to broaden its membership composition in\norder to reach the large numbers of Hispanics/Latinos\nin their partnership area. The issue was not one of\ncultural identity. The fiscal agent and several partners\nwere social service agencies led and staffed largely by\nHispanics/Latinos. However, social service agencies\nare viewed by some as closely associated with the\ngovernment and therefore potentially dangerous to\npeople with questionable legal status. In order to\naddress this outreach barrier, SALSA has specifically\ntargeted for membership the faith community and\nother segments of El Paso's informal network that have\nbetter access to consumers not otherwise connected to\nmore formal social service agencies.\nAnother important governance function is account-\nability, defined as the processes adopted by a partner-\nship that justify its existence and actions to the\ncommunity. In long-term care and supportive services,\naccountability is usually established by laws governing\nthe creation of nonprofit corporations. However,\nbecause CPFOA partnerships are not incorporated as\nfreestanding entities, accountability has been divisive,\nparticularly with regard to the role and accountability\nof each partnership's fiscal agent. Boston originally\nconceived its Partnership for Older Adults as a coalition\nof several existing and overlapping groups, with the\ncity's Commission on Affairs of the Elderly acting as\nfiscal agent. Boston is not a city, however, where\norganizations and citizens take readily to dominant\ngovernment structures (the Boston Tea Party comes to\nmind). Furthermore, as the city's designated Area\nAgency on Aging, the Commission plays an important\nrole in establishing aging policy for the city and\nallocating Older Americans Act funds to social service\norganizations. After a fractious debate about whether\nthe Commission, in its dominant position based at City\nHall, could be held accountable by partnership mem-\nbers, a decision was made to have a city-affiliated yet\nfreestanding Senior Center with 501(c)(3) nonprofit\nstatus act as the fiscal agent. This maintained the tie\nto the city and respected the Commission's role as\na founding member while putting the fiscal agent more\nat par with the other social service agencies that\ncomprise the majority of members of the Boston\nPartnership for Older Adults (BPOA).\nHarris County's Care for Elders partnership had\na similar challenge when some members became\nsuspicious of the intentions of the fiscal agent, a 100-\nyear-old social service agency with a history and goals\nof its own. At the same time, the fiscal agent's board of\ndirectors had become concerned about whether acting\nas fiscal agent required it to sublimate its individual\nagency prerogatives to those of the partnership in\na way that other members had not been required to do.\nTo whom was the board accountable--to its traditional\nconstituency, or to the much broader community\nreflected in the partnership? A creative solution was\ncrafted in which the partnership created its own gov-\nerning council. The chair of the governing council has\na seat on the fiscal agent's board, tying the two together\nfor accountability, yet enabling the fiscal agent to\ncomfortably delegate partnership governance functions\nto the council.\nCommunity Partnership Management\nA governance document provides a solid foundation\nfor a partnership, but it is only words on paper until\nmanagers execute its provisions. Tending to day-to-day\ndetails of partnership implementation can be particu-\nlarly challenging because activities are often spread\nacross multiple member organizations that are con-\ntributing in-kind services. Individual member agencies\ngenerally view partnership tasks as discretionary\nactivities that come after their ``real'' work (such as\ndelivering meals, investigating abuse complaints, or\nanswering a telephone information line). Communica-\ntion also is more challenging, because it must span\nmultiple organizations and individuals.\nThe Boston Partnership for Older Adults learned\nthat conflict could best be prevented or managed by\nproviding neutral staff resources to workgroups, rather\nthan relying on in-kind staffing from member agencies.\nIn order to make clear the intent to provide neutral\nstaff accessible by all members, the staff moved from\ntheir original location in City Hall to office space not\nassociated with any individual member organization.\nMilwaukee County's Connecting Caring Communi-\nties partnership uses a similar mechanism in order to\nensure that work will be done in an unbiased manner,\nalthough it contracts for professional facilitators rather\nthan dedicating staff to support its multiple project\nsteering committees. The contracted facilitators are\nresponsible for ensuring good communication among\nsteering committee members, preparing agendas,\nkeeping meetings on task, documenting meetings,\nand conducting research and other tasks outside of\nmeetings.\nAs a partnership gains credibility in the community\nand association with it becomes positive to funders,\npolicy makers, and others, it becomes important to\nmanage external communication about the partnership.\nFor example, BPOA bylaws specify that approval of the\nexecutive director and the Public Relations Committee\nare required before anyone represents the Partnership\nat a public event.\nAnother management function is providing the\nappropriate structures and coordination mechanisms\nthat enable a partnership to achieve its goals. Again, this\nhas proved to be an important issue for CPFOA grantees.\nHow can a partnership's work be broken into manage-\nable parts (especially if it is the work of a large\npartnership with diverse interests), yet not become\nfragmented and compartmentalized? BPOA answered\nthis question by creating 13 issue-focused workgroups,\neach of which has a chair who also sits on the\nPartnership's board of directors. This ensures high-level\nstrategic coordination across workgroup activities. At\nthe operational level, the chairs also sit on a program and\nplanning council that meets with BPOA staff to discuss\nday-to-day integration and coordination of work.\nMilwaukee County's Connecting Caring Communi-\nties, with its tradition of decentralized partnership\nactivity, has taken a different approach. Like BPOA,\nConnecting Caring Communities has multiple work-\ngroups overseeing different parts of the partnership's\nwork plan. But unlike BPOA, Connecting Caring\nCommunities did not see a need to create an additional\nforum to address operational coordination. Strategic\ncoordination is addressed within the partnership's core\nleadership group, which meets every other month, and\noperational coordination is left to the workgroups'\ndiscretion.\nToward Sustainability: Early Evidence\nof Centrality\nAs was discussed earlier, centrality refers to the state\nof a partnership becoming a pivotal institutional force\nin the life of a community. Each of the partnerships\ncontinues to evolve, but each can also point to early\nindicators of centrality within their communities.\nIn El Paso, SALSA has been recognized by the media\nas a source for public affairs programming and news\nrelated to older adults. The partnership manages\na weekly column, Viva 3rd Age, in the local newspaper.\nThe column is an excellent communication vehicle for\nreaching a mass audience, and it gives SALSA\nwidespread exposure in the community. Viva 3rd Age\nalso acts to sustain interest among members and to\nattract new members to SALSA, which is viewed as\nhaving expertise. SALSA also hosts a weekly show on\nthe local public radio station. As an indication that\nstate agencies view SALSA as an important local\nresource, the adult protective agency contacted the\npartnership to help respond to a serious breakdown of\nthe adult protective services system. SALSA was able to\nrespond by drawing on its members to quickly establish\na Neighbors Helping Neighbors initiative in El Paso.\nBPOA established itself as a source of credible\nquantitative data on older people in Boston with\nBoston (Boston Partnership for Older Adults, 2003).\nThis report is a compendium of information synthe-\nsized from existing data collected by partners and\nbuttressed by the results of a survey conducted by\nMathematica Policy Research, Inc. (Black & Brown,\n2004), as part of the Robert Wood Johnson Founda-\ntion's national evaluation of CPFOA. BPOA has had\nsubstantial media attention as a result of the report and\nhas since been sought after by local mass media as\na source of objective information when issues related to\nolder adults are in the news. The report also resulted in\ncontact from two local foundations. One sought out\nBPOA after receiving several funding requests that cited\nThat foundation had considered pulling out of\ngrantmaking for older adults but recommitted itself\nto the population after BPOA met with the founda-\ntion's trustees and demonstrated the need. Another\nlocal foundation decided it would use BPOA's strategic\nplan as a guidepost for elder grantmaking. The report\nalso prompted a contact from a local health mainte-\nnance organization seeking advice on a request for\nproposals it was issuing for initiatives that would\nprevent or delay institutionalization. The health main-\ntenance organization asked BPOA to help narrow the\nfocus of the request for proposals based on the findings\nMilwaukee County's Connecting Caring Communi-\nties also reports having been buttressed in its efforts by\nlocal foundations, which have begun insisting that\norganizations seeking funding tie their requests into the\npartnership's strategic plan. Like BPOA, Connecting\nCaring Communities received positive attention after\npublishing Now at 60 What I See (Milwaukee County,\n2003), a report on aging in Milwaukee County that,\nlike in Boston, took advantage of the survey data from\nthe national evaluation of CPFOA.\nHarris County's Care for Elders issued a similar\nreport, Meeting the Long-Term Care Challenge: A\nStrategic Plan for Addressing the Needs of Older\nAdults and Family Caregivers in Harris County (Care\nfor Elders, 2004). The report has become a frequently\ncited source on the status of aging in Harris County\nand is now routinely referred to as ``the Blue Book.''\nThe report created opportunities for dialogue with the\nHouston City Council and local foundations, some of\nwhich now want to access the data in order to inform\ntheir grantmaking. Care for Elders has gained sufficient\ninfluence in the community to convince five separate\ninformation and referral sources in the Houston area to\ncontribute to a single electronic database of resources\nfor older adults.\nLessons Learned\nLooking across the experiences of CPFOA grantees\nin this early phase of their work, we see some\nimportant lessons emerging.\nLocal Context Matters.--Partnerships are experienc-\ning similar difficulties and sharing ideas, but their\nsolutions are unique to their individual environments.\nCare for Elders and BPOA both saw a need to clarify\ngovernance and the role of the fiscal agent, for\nexample, but one community chose to adopt operating\nguidelines in order to codify procedures for member-\nship, decision making, resource allocation, leadership\nroles, and partnership relationship to the host agency,\nwhereas the other chose to adopt a new fiscal agent and\na formal partnership governance structure that includes\na board, officers, and bylaws.\nIf Attention is not Paid Early on to Governance and\nManagement, Progress will Stall.--This was perhaps\nsurprising to both the partnerships and the National\nProgram Office, because a criterion for funding was\nthat partnerships have prior experience working\ntogether as well as some demonstrated outcomes. In\nretrospect, with new resources from the Robert Wood\nJohnson Foundation, many of the partnerships took on\ngoals of unprecedented complexity and some contro-\nversy, and they found that their existing governance\nand management structures were no longer adequate.\nAlthough the ensuing development work was initially\nfrustrating to many involved, it was a necessary\ninvestment in partnership building.\nCommunities Value and Use Information from One\nAnother and Adapt it to Local Context.--For example,\nonce one partnership used national evaluation data in\norder to produce a local report, several other partner-\nships followed suit. Communities shared methods and\ndrafts during this process.\nData are not Simply an Important Partnership\nPlanning Tool.--When presented effectively (as in the\ncommunity strategic plans and reports produced by\npartnerships), data are key tools for achieving central-\nity and giving partnerships visibility, credibility, and\nentre\n\u00b4 e with policy makers, the media, researchers, and\nfunders.\nEmerging Centrality can be Traced Directly to\nSome Early Planning Activities.--Several communities\nreport that local foundations now look to the\ncommunity strategic plans for long-term care and\nsupportive-services systems improvements that were\ncreated by partnerships in order to inform their\ngrantmaking. A planning process with broad partici-\npation by older adults, service providers, government\nagencies, community leaders, and other stakeholders\ngives partnerships credibility in the community.\nResource Issues can be Divisive to Partnerships but\ncan also Help Clarify Accountability Mechanisms.--\nFor many CPFOA grantees, the Robert Wood Johnson\nFoundation grant represents the largest infusion of\nexternal resources ever controlled by the partnership.\nIn some communities, the response to substantial new\nresources was mistrust--particularly of fiscal agents,\nbut also of other partnership members. Partnerships\nappear to have successfully channeled the mistrust into\nclarification of governance and management structures.\nPower Imbalances Exist in all Partnerships and\nShould be Acknowledged and Addressed.--Being the\nfiscal agent for a partnership is one example of one\nmember having greater potential influence than another,\nand the size and role of individual partners in the\ncommunity affect the influence a member has in the\npartnership. Grantees have used relatively simple\napproaches in order to ensure that power imbalances\ndo not get in the way of partnership activities. For\nexample, providing dedicated partnership staff gives\nmembers some comfort that activities will not be\ndominated by in-kind staff from larger partners.\nConclusions\nAlthough these four community partnerships can\npoint to emerging importance and influence in their\ncommunities, it is too early to predict sustainability. It\nremains to be seen whether any of these partnerships\nwill be able to maintain current levels of activity and\nincrease their centrality after the Robert Wood Johnson\nFoundation grant funding ends. But the experiences of\nthese communities to date underscore that governance\nand management need to be grappled with explicitly\nand early if a partnership is to become a sustainable\nforce in the life of its community.\nReferences\nBlack, W., & Brown, R.
