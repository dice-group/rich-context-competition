Studies on Muslims and the media have suggested that there is a largely\nnegative discourse about Muslims in Western countries. As a result, the `othering'\nprocesses that occur in the media may impact how Muslim citizens experience their\nindividual attachments to society. We use excerpts from focus group interviews with\nSomalis in the Netherlands1 to investigate how they look upon, counter or internalize\nmedia discourses that seem to depict them in a negative way, particularly because they\nare Muslims. The findings indicate that discriminative discourses create a plurality of\noutcomes for our participants. Whereas all perceive a negative debate, some discur-\nsively `join' a global Muslim community as a result, while others try their best to avoid\nassociation with a worldwide Muslim alliance and emphasize within-group variances.\nThough the opposing reactions might seem contradictory, we argue that both\nresponses counter the same problems: `othering' and victimization. Thereby we give\nvoice to Somalis who are not often heard, while at the same time adding to the\ntheoretical understanding of `othering' processes.\n",

Hall (1992) argues that a particular `discourse' on Muslims is dominant in\na large part of the western media. Huntington's (1996) statement that there is a\n`clash of civilisations' and that it would be impossible to bridge the supposedly\ndangerous gap, caused another revival of this thinking. This negative discourse\nwas further strengthened worldwide after 11 September. A discourse developed\nin which some political actors, members of anti-immigrant or right wing groups,\nlegitimised by intellectuals and selected `worried' citizens increasingly interpreted\nthe aggressive character of Al-Qaida and ISIS as something that is related to\ncultural and religious rules in Muslim areas.

Whereas racist exclusionary reasoning starts from biological characteris-\ntics, `islamophobic' exclusion starts with assumptions around religion, and the\nroots are similar.\nThe debate intensified in several West European countries as a result of local\nevents. In the Netherlands, the violent death of Dutch filmmaker, Theo van Gogh,\nin 2004 accelerated changing emotional and political attitudes to Muslims\nreligious affiliations have become `core issues' in Dutch public and political\ndebates, with a strong focus on Islamic groups--the Moroccans and Turks in\nparticular (Coenders et al., 2008: 272). Simultaneously, loyalty to, and identifica-\ntion with, the Netherlands has, more and more, come to be seen as an essential\ncomponent of integration (Ersanilli and Koopmans, 2010).\nThrough negative categorisation and a continuous problem-focused approach,\nMuslims are--individually and collectively--portrayed as a tangible threat to the\n`western' way of life, and commonly associated with oppression, religious fanati-\nalso present in the discussion, the appeal to fear (possible terrorism) easily attracts\nthe attention of the public. This very visible discourse creates rigid boundaries\nbetween `us' and `them', and generally constructs an image of Muslim citizens\n2003). In this manner, media contribute directly and indirectly to the distribution\nof negative perceptions of immigrants and (ethnic) minorities (Scheufele and\net al. (2009) found that attitudes towards Muslims have deteriorated significantly\nin the last two decades. Van der Valk (2012) gives an overview of public and\nislamophobic political expressions in the Netherlands, including violent incidents\ntowards mosques and discrimination against Muslims. It seems likely that the kind\nof reporting has impact on how minorities are perceived by the general public. On\nthe other hand, the views of the public might also be reflected in the media. It is not\nclear where this starts, but altogether a vicious circle can develop.\nAlthough the debate on Muslims might have impact on social opinions and\ninteractions, media outlets often fail to take the voices of their Muslim audience\ninto account. Koomen and Van Heelsum (2013) confirm that, while Muslim organ-\nizations in Europe do attempt to provide a counter-voice in the debate, often `more\nis said about Muslims by non-Muslims than by Muslims themselves'.3 They show\nmade claims or statements on subjects related to Muslims or Islam in newspapers\narticles are themselves Muslims, compared to 32% in the United Kingdom.\nRepresentatives of Muslim organisations may react by sending letters to news-\npapers and joining discussions in television talk shows. But for moderate Muslim\norganisational leaders it is not as easy to be heard in the debate as it is for non-\nMuslims. In addition, not everyone desires to be positioned as a public target. One\nconsequence of these developments is that Muslim minorities are assigned identities\nthat do not necessarily correspond with their own perceptions, as they are subjected\nto a discourse that often simplifies any ethnic, linguistic and cultural differences\n(Aly, 2007; Hopkins, 2011). As they are labelled and categorized as certain groups\nand actors, they must increasingly defend their position in society by proving where\ntheir loyalties lie. As a result, the constant `othering' processes that occur in\nWestern media can have an impact on how Muslim citizens perceive their own\nidentities and senses of belonging (Gu\nIn this article, we will examine how Somalis in the Netherlands respond to\ndiscriminative discourses in the media, in order to contribute to a greater under-\nstanding of the relationship between media coverage and Muslim minorities'\nexperiences of belonging. Maliepaard (2012) found that a considerable number\nof Muslims in the Netherlands consider Dutch people to be excessively negative\nabout Islam. Yet there has been little qualitative research on how Dutch Muslims\ninterpret or counter discriminative discourses. Here we use excerpts from focus\ngroup interviews with Dutch Somalis to examine how these participants `belong'\nin a space and time in which belonging for Muslims living in the West is often\n`discounted, denied, symbolically retracted and pushed out of reach' (Skrbis et al.,\nBelonging and the effect of `othering'\nWhile the notion of belonging has generated many different perspectives and\napproaches, most scholars concur it should be regarded as processual, dynamic\nand situational. According to the definition put forth by Anthias (2008), it is `about\nexperiences of being part of the social fabric and the ways in which social bonds\nand ties are manifested in practices, experiences and emotions of inclusion' (8). It\nentails feeling `at home', on account of emotional attachments to both a physical\nspace and the larger imagined community space (Antonsich, 2010). Investigations\ninto belonging often focus on migrants and their experiences, as these show how it\nis possible to belong in many different ways and on different scales (Wright, 2015).\nMeasuring migrants' level of `belonging', Valentine et al. (2009) have argued, has\nbecome an important determinant of integration. Additionally, migrants' stories\nalso highlight how belonging is constructed in relation to people's particular inter-\nsectional social location, depending on a background of class, gender, religion,\ning has often been coupled--and at times equated--with the term `identity', the\ntwo notions do have a different emphasis. Whereas identity is best understood as a\nset of claims or narratives about oneself, and involves `presentation and labelling,\nmyths of origin and myths of destiny with associated strategies and identifications'\n(Anthias, 2008: 8), belonging is about experiences and emotional attachments\nIt is generally the recognition and acceptance of a particular self-identity by a\nwider community that helps to build a sense of belonging (Valentine et al., 2009).\nHowever, various studies indicate that questions of belonging regularly materialize\nbecause people feel that they `cannot gain access, participate or be included within\nthe dominant society' (Anthias, 2008: 8). It is the experience of being different, or\nstrangers, that causes a feeling of `not belonging' (Noble, 2005; Wood and Waite,\n2011). Understanding belonging as the emotional experiences of inclusion thus also\nrequires a focus on what may be the opposite of belonging, that is to say, the\nemotional experiences of exclusion (Wright, 2015). Media play a particular role\nin such negotiations of social power between majority and minority. Sharify-Funk\n(2009) discovered that Canadian Muslims feel they have to construct their identities\nin contrast, or in opposition, to conventional media images and messages. Gu\n\u00a8 ney\n(2010) found that `othering' processes in the British media have a fragmenting\neffect on Muslim youth in the UK who, as a result, have diminishing feelings of\nattachment to Britain and increasing empathy with the struggles of Muslims\nworldwide.\nThough the second generation is probably more vocal in their protest and more\neager to defend itself than the first generation, this does not automatically mean\nthat all second-generation youngsters weakly identify with the country in which\nthey live. As Van Heelsum and Koomen (2016) show, both religious, ethnic and\nnational identification of the second generation (Moroccan) Muslims in five\nEuropean countries gets affected by the negative tone of the debate in the\npapers, but the second generation take their `right' to be Dutch or French,\nBelgian, German or Swiss as more natural compared to the first generation.\nIndividuals may react to stigmatization and exclusion by emphasizing both\ntheir ethnic and religious backgrounds. Yet Gordon Allport, in his seminal\nwork on prejudice and responses to victimization (1954), argued that there are 12\ndevices individuals can use to protect themselves, which roughly fall into two\ncategories:\nIn the first instance the victim blames the outer causes of his handicap; in the second\nhe tends, if not actually to blame himself, at least to take the responsibility upon\nNumerous authors followed up on Allport and broadened his reasoning\n(see Dovidio et al., 2005 for an overview). James Jones (2005) provides a list of\nadditions and developments in the field and recently Lamont and Mizrachi (2012),\nwho brought together considerable research in several countries about responses to\nstigmatization in a special issue of Ethnic and Racial Studies, distinguish between\nthree modalities of response. The subjects who feel addressed unfairly can some-\ntimes negotiate, for instance by actively and openly discussing the problem and\nmaking others aware that their actions make them uncomfortable or by under-\ntaking political action. Others prefer a conflict-deflecting strategy--believing that it\nis the best to ignore, forgive and walk away, even though that might lead to\ngrowing feeling of frustration. A third group favours a mixed strategy (Fleming\nIn research that specifically relates to Muslim migrants in Europe, strengthening\nof in-group ties is mentioned as a defence mechanism (Karimshah et al., 2014; Sirin\nConversely, other studies show that discriminative discourses lead minorities to\ndistance themselves from members of their in-group. British Muslims have actively\nasserted themselves in exposing the existing discourses by challenging the secularist,\nliberal and feminist assumptions (Modood, 2005). In a study on young Somali\nwomen in London, Phoenix (2011) found that in the climate of the `War on\nTerror', these women deconstruct their devalued social position as Muslims by\ndistancing themselves from more recent migrants from Somalia and by pointing\nout that Muslim `Asians' (such as Pakistani) are much more affected by negative\ndiscourses than they are. Stigmatization can thus also lead to the creation of new\nIn the Netherlands, Somalis make up a relatively new and distinct\nMuslim population, next to the already established Moroccan and Turkish\ncommunities. Somalis might be victims of double discrimination--being\nboth Muslim and black. While they also constitute a small Muslim minority,\nthey are found to internalize their faith strongly and experience it as an\nimportant part of their identity (Griffiths, 2002; Moors et al., 2009; Nijenhuis\ndiscriminative discourses on how they consider themselves to be positioned in\nsociety, in the context of living in the Netherlands as a Muslim refugee of colour\nmore generally.\nSomalis in the Netherlands\nThe Somali presence in the Netherlands largely came about as a result of the 1991\nrevolution in Somalia. A coalition of armed forces overthrew then-president Siad\nBarre, after which the Islamic Court Union (ICU) rose to power (Hoene and\nwar that continues to this day. Subsequently, numerous Somalis fled their home\ncountry to take refuge, first in neighbouring countries, and later also in Western\nValentine et al., 2009). The largest Somali communities outside Africa are to be\nfound in Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy and the UK (UNHCR, 2014; Van den\nNetherlands (according to the website Dutch Statistical Office www.cbs.nl visited\non 15 March 2015). Somalis were then one of the four largest refugee groups in the\nNetherlands (Dourleijn and Dagevos, 2011). Dutch Somalis are not a homogenous\ncommunity. Although many Dutch Somalis tend to live in areas with a high per-\ncentage of immigrants (such as in cities like Rotterdam or Amsterdam) due\nto refugee placement, Somalis are more dispersed than other immigrants\n(Van Heelsum, 2011). While the earliest wave of Somalis consisted mostly of\neducated individuals from high socio-economic classes who were able to flee\ntheir war-torn country, the latest influx of Somali refugees are less educated, as\ntheir education has been disrupted by the prolonged war in Somalia (Moors et al.,\nin the Netherlands generally hold relatively unfavourable socio-economic pos-\nitions. About one-third of the Dutch Somali workforce is unemployed, and\nnearly half receive social benefits (Dourleijn and Dagevos, 2011; Klaver et al.,\nunemployment levels of most immigrant groups, including the second generation,\nare systematically higher than those of Dutch (Lamberts et al., 2013). Dutch\nSomalis also do not fare well in the education system. They tend to end up on\nthe lower levels and move upward less than Dutch children. According to the study\nby Moors et al. (2009) these issues, in combination with experiences of\nracism, mean that many Somalis regard their position in the Netherlands as\nsubstandard. Several studies further indicate that Dutch Somalis generally view\ntheir Muslim and Somali identity as more important to them than their\nAfter 2001, the Somali population in the Netherlands reduced in size for a\nperiod of time due to `secondary migration' to countries like the UK. Research\non the phenomenon provided various explanations that were centred on social,\neconomic and political motives (Moors et al., 2009; Van Den Reek and Hussein,\njob opportunities available to them in the UK, whilst others were encouraged by\nfamily members to join them. Importantly, the political climate after 9/11 was also\nSomalis felt that people in the Netherlands had started to show a decrease in\ntolerance towards Muslims and found that the UK had more room for cultural\ndifference. We will examine whether such sentiments still apply to our participants\nand what role they believe the media play in them.\nThere are many additional factors that influence the position of minorities in\nDutch society in particular ways. Other research, for instance, has focused on the\neffect of the shift from a multiculturalist to an assimilationist policy (Entzinger,\n2006; Vasta, 2007) or on the negative effects of the long asylum procedure (Pels and\nDe Gruijter, 2005: 58). The context of structural discrimination in the country\nmore generally is highly relevant (Andriessen et al., 2014, 2015; Lamberts et al.,\n2013). As the Open Society Foundation (2015) concluded after studying Somalis in\nSweden, Finland, the UK and the Netherlands, `Discrimination in employment,\neducation and housing contribute towards socio-economic exclusion which in turn\nfurther undermines the sense of belonging and identity with the wider society.' (27).\nThe earlier-mentioned ideas about feelings of superiority among Western\nEuropeans and the existing fear of `the other' seem to lie behind these attitudes.\nOur objective, however, is to examine how Dutch Somalis look upon, counter or\ninternalize media discourses that depict them as typical Muslims. What role does\nmedia coverage play in their overall sense of belonging? By understanding how\nDutch Somalis negotiate the friction `between self-invention and external defin-\nition' (Phoenix, 2011: 315), we will show that negative media discourses on\nMuslims have a plurality of effects on Somalis in the Netherlands and their sense\nof belonging. First, however, we will contextualize their position in the\nNetherlands.\nSomalis in Dutch media\nResearch on media reporting of Somalis in the Amsterdam local newspaper Het\nParool established that the main category found in relation to Somalis was `piracy',\nconsisting of news about Somali pirates and the contribution of Dutch marines to\nplace, however, came reports on terrorism at an international level. A particular\nterrorist group that Somalis are associated with is Al-Shabaab.\nAl-Shabaab (`the youth' in Arabic) was established around 2006, when radical\nyoung militia splintered off the Islamic Courts' Union as a result of the Ethiopian\narmy's invasion of Somalia (Vidino et al., 2010). While Ethiopia was already\nregarded as Somalia's historical enemy, many Somalis also perceived the country\nas acting as a proxy for the United States. According to Vidino et al. (2010), the\nresulting mixture of anti-Ethiopian, anti-American, anti-western, nationalist and\nIslamist sentiments, `both within the African country and in the diaspora' (220),\nwas the setting in which Al-Shabaab emerged. Since then, the organization has\nestablished itself as one of the most feared terrorist organizations in Africa, carrying\nout a coordinated series of (suicide) attacks on government offices, consulates and\nallegiance to Al-Qaeda, a terrorist grouping with a long active history in Somalia\nwhose presence has worried western forces for years (Riedel, 2007; CNN Wire Staff,\n2012). Western media have covered these developments extensively, but especially\nturned their attention to Al-Shabaab after the 2013 Westgate attack in Nairobi.\nNumerous news stories covered the attack that resulted in 67 deaths and scores\ninjured, many of whom were western expats living in Kenya.\nAl-Shabaab's growth from a localized terror group to one with a sophisticated\ninternational PR operation used to recruit people from the Somali diaspora has\nbecome a major concern for both neighbouring and Western governments in recent\nyears. According to Vidino et al. (2010), some Somali diaspora members are drawn\nto Al-Shabaab because of the greater ideological context, as they see the conflict in\nSomalia as part of the imminent clash between Islam and the West. They report\nfound to be somehow connected to Al-Shabaab, either suspected of having tra-\nvelled to Somalia to fight or having been arrested for terrorist-related offences\nSecurity Service, AIVD, has over the years also kept a close eye on Somalia as a\njihadi destination and on Dutch Somali citizens who might be interested in fighting\nthere (AIVD, 2010). It is feared that Dutch Somalis will be sensitive to radical\ninterpretations of Islam, due to their general low socio-economic position in Dutch\nsociety and possible experiences of discrimination (Moors and Jacobs, 2009). In\nour study, the backdrop of news stories on terrorism and Al-Shabaab will therefore\nbe of importance, as it is a specific part of the debate on Muslims that our partici-\npants feel associated with.\nAs mentioned earlier, the overarching purpose of this article is to examine the\nrelationship between media discourses and experiences of belonging. After the\nabove overview of literature, we can now employ two more specific sub-questions:\n(1) Do Dutch Somalis experience the current debate to be as excluding as the\nliterature would suggest? (2) To what extent does the debate affect Dutch\nSomalis' sense of belonging? In the first section of the results we will thus discuss\nhow participants reflected on the Dutch media debate, while in the second section\nwe will demonstrate how the participants believed this impacted on their personal\nsense of belonging in the Netherlands.\nMethod\nIn this article we draw on three focus group discussions held with 20 participants\nfrom the city of Delft.6 These three focus groups consisted of young Dutch Somali\nmen and women aged 18 to 30, most of whom had spent the largest part of their lives\nin the Netherlands. Participants were recruited through the network of one of the\nauthors and by approaching community centres where Somalis are known to social-\nise. We focused on one city within the country (Delft), as this helped facilitate the\ngathering of useful resources and connections. The focus group approach allowed\nconversation with several individuals at a time, which also encouraged participation\nfrom people who felt reluctant to be interviewed on their own (Kitzinger, 1995: 299).\nWhile the sample size is limited, and not representative, the results give insight in the\nway in which `othering' works in the lives of this group.\nThe bulk of the discussions were held in Dutch, with sometime a few words in\nSomali, and on average the focus group meetings lasted three hours.7 Culturally\nsensitive key factors such as age and gender were taken into account to place the\nparticipants within the different focus groups. This structure allowed participants\nto express their views as freely as possible on a range of topics. The meetings were\nmeant to be conversational, so rigid questioning was avoided. Participants were\nassessed on whether they encountered any negative representations of Muslims or\nof Somalis in the media, and on how they identified themselves and their position in\nDutch society. They were encouraged to challenge each other, which resulted in a\nplurality of opinions and perceptions. Most participants in the study were pleased\nto have an opportunity to voice their feelings and stated that they hoped that the\nstudy will provide a better insight into the Somali community in the Netherlands.\nAfter transcribing the interview, we analysed the data in order to answer the two\nsub-questions. We classify `belonging' into three types, from a `high' to a `low'\nsense of belonging.\nMedia discourses: On being `others'\nWe will now consider the results related to the first sub-question, namely: Do\nDutch Somalis experience the current debate to be as excluding as the literature\nwould suggest?\nThe Dutch Somali participants in our study described themselves as heavy con-\nsumers of news. The most popular media among them was the Internet, though the\nmajority answered that they also read at least one newspaper a day. More than half\nof the participants preferred to read free national weekday newspapers such as\nSpits and Metro. The recurrent news on Muslims since 11 September was some-\nthing all participants had noticed. Several respondents referred to this trend as\n`Muslim shaming'--a stream of constant bad imagery of Muslim communities\nand Islam. While some argued that negative media attention had primarily been\ngiven to the Moroccan and Turkish communities, others indicated that the negative\nframing of Muslims in Dutch media involved Somalis as much as any other ethnic\nMuslim community. They argued that news segments, articles and TV continually\nsuggest how different the west and Muslims are from each other. One woman\nasserted the following:\nDo you know how many times I read in newspapers about what a bad thing a Muslim\nperson has done? I only know that because the article is persistent in letting their\nreaders know that he is a Muslim. The same treatment is never applied to any other\nreligion. (Female, aged 29)\nAs her statement shows, respondents believed that the approach of the media to\nMuslims was different. Most participants downplayed the prominence of Somalis\nin such stories. But nearly all expressed having observed negative, albeit infrequent,\nmedia portrayals of Somalis. According to them, newspapers' stories usually\nappear very one-sided and frequently frame Somalis in a narrow box that depicts\nthem as violent and barbaric. According to one female participant, aged 22, as\nnewspapers always depict Muslim communities negatively, it should come as no\nsurprise that the same is happening to the Somali community: `We are Muslims,\nright? That usually will be enough to get you a bad headline.' Naturally, having\ndifferent feelings towards their community they strongly felt that Dutch media do\nnot fairly depict Somalis. Discourse that reduced them to simplistic categories such\nas `criminals' and `terrorists' was found to be inaccurate and insulting.\nLabelling Somalis as `terrorists' bothered participants in particular. At the time\nof the focus group discussions it had been little over a year since the Westgate\nattack in Nairobi and several other incidents worldwide that had involved\nAl-Shabaab. As such, the participants had noticed an increase in news stories\nabout the organization. They strongly opposed the way certain news stories\nassociated Al-Shabaab's terrorist activities with the wider Dutch Somali commu-\nnity. Several people, such as the following woman, complained about the lack of\nknowledge people in the Netherlands had about Dutch Somalis:\nPeople don't know much about us as a community, so instead of getting to know us\nthey just call us whatever helps them to identify and categorize us as a group. (Female,\nEven if participants found that newspapers were accurate in describing what\nAl-Shabaab was, they disagreed about treating them as fellow Muslims. Several\nparticipants argued something in line with one young man's statement: `I would\nnever classify Al-Shabaab as Muslim. What they are doing is not in the name of\nIslam.' Participants stressed that the behaviour of Al-Shabaab members was quite\nfar from what people within the Somali community would ever associate with:\nHow can they compare me with what a member of Al-Shabaab in Somalia does?\nI have never seen Somalia; what they fight for and what I consider important are\nworlds apart. It makes me frustrated that people generalise so easily without thinking\nof how others may feel. (Female, aged 25)\nBy emphasizing the difference between Somalis in the Netherlands and affiliates of\nAl-Shabaab, participants effectively distanced themselves from this stigmatized\ngroup. By doing so, they simultaneously aimed to deconstruct the link between\nIslam and terrorism: their distancing from Al-Shabaab helped create a discursive\nboundary of who should and who should not be considered part of their commu-\nnity. This suggests that one way of dealing with negative media imagery is to\nconstruct a particular group identity that is inherently opposite to media portrayals\nThe narratives in this section confirm that Muslim citizens are commonly con-\ncoverage on Muslims to be largely negative, and believed that `western' and\n`Muslim' values are generalized and put down in the debate in a dichotomizing\nway. Terrorism, it furthermore appeared, is dubbed in the media as an inherently\n`Muslim' phenomenon. For the participants in our study, this means that the dis-\ncourse used in the media is an example of the ways in which Muslim citizens are\nexcluded from society. Considering that media discourses are often not in line with\nhow people perceive themselves and their community--which the debate on\nAl-Shabaab showed--Dutch Somalis must sometimes construct their Muslim\nand Somali identity in opposition to commonplace media messages. The next sec-\ntion will examine how the focus group participants discuss the impact of media\ncharacterizations on them and their sense of belonging.\nCountering media representation\nThe second sub-question, on what the media debate on Muslims meant for the par-\nticipants' personal sense of belonging, was a complex matter for most of the indi-\nviduals. While the majority said they considered themselves Somali first, then\nMuslim, and lastly Dutch, most said they generally felt safer in the Netherlands\nthan in Somalia. However, many indicated that, to truly feel to `belong' in the\nNetherlands, one has to be completely accepted on many different levels. In add-\nition, individuals emphasized different matters that were of significance to them.\nTo operationalise the concept `belonging' we have classified three dimensions\nfrom a `high' to a `low' sense of belonging. As we explained earlier, a strong sense\nof belonging means to experience a clear feeling of inclusion and to hold emotional\nattachments to both a physical and imaginative space (Anthias, 2008). A low sense\nof `belonging' indicates an absence of these feelings and a focus on experiences of\nexclusion (Wright, 2015). The dimensions that we have distinguished are not static,\nbut roughly belong to one of three sentiments that individuals hold in response to\nmedia messages. First, there were those individuals who emphasized their belong-\ning despite media messages; second, people who argued that their sense of belong-\ning fluctuated; and third, participants who indicated an absence of experiencing\nbelonging. We will argue that the three dimensions all exhibit different mechanisms\nof coping with the negative discourse in the media.\nExplicit belonging in spite of media messages\nIn comparison to the rest, the participants clustered in this group actively asserted\ntheir membership in the Netherlands, despite discriminatory discourses. While they\nagreed that there is a negative media discourse on Muslims, they asserted that they\ndid not feel personally affected, for a number of different reasons.\nSome of these participants simply did not believe that negative depictions of\nMuslims affected them as Somalis, or that there were recurrent negative depictions\nof Somalis. Like many of the other participants, they regarded Al-Shabaab as a\nterror organisation that had nothing to do with them. When asked to what extent\nmedia reports have an impact on other Somalis feeling `at home' in the\nNetherlands, these participants did not believe that media had such a big influence.\nInstead, some counter-positioned themselves by stressing how much they person-\nally belonged in the Netherlands, despite media discourses. According to one\nyoung woman:\nFor me Holland is home, I can't picture myself anywhere else. I have never been to\nSomalia, so I can't really say much about it. But I feel more Dutch when I am with my\naunties and uncles. I celebrate the national holidays, my friends are Dutch and I am\naccustomed to this life. Negative things will be said about my community, but in all\nhonesty stuff like that doesn't affect me at all. I suppose I am more Dutch than I ever\nthought and I am fine with that. (Female, aged 22)\nAs the above quote indicates, this particular participant defined her `Dutchness' by\nher proximity to (ethnically) Dutch people and her willingness to participate in the\n`Dutch way of life'.\nOther participants stated that they do not pay attention to negative representa-\ntion in newspapers, simply because they do not feel these depictions are true. They\nfound news stories about young Somali people who seemingly aligned themselves\nwith Al-Shabaab ideology hard to believe. One woman argued:\nI don't know about young people joining Al-Shabaab, I don't know anyone within my\ncommunity that has. I really do think it's something that has been made up by the\nmedia. (Female, aged 22)\nThe latter statement illustrates the discrepancy between what people believe to be\naccurate about their community and what they find in the media.\nSeveral participants made clear that more nuanced coverage on Muslims does\nexist. Nonetheless, they complained that this coverage is rather niche, being\neither broadcast late in the evening or appearing in media that does not have a\nbroad reach.\nBy stressing both the irrelevance and inaccuracy of news segments, these focus\ngroup participants disengaged from the debate that signifies Muslims as `others'.\nThis type of response de-victimizes their unfavourable position and challenges the\nClaiming a sense of inclusion despite media message is furthermore a powerful\nway to emphasize one's right `to belong' and thus to counter exclusion.\nFluctuating belonging: Intersections of class, religion and ethnic hierarchies\nThe second group comprised individuals who showed a `fluctuating' sense of\nbelonging. They talked about feeling estranged from Dutch society at times, yet\nfeeling `at home' at other times. Participants had a number of different arguments\nto explain their point of view.\nJust as the first group, the individuals clustered in this group saw noticeable\nnegative depictions in newspapers about Muslims and about Somalis. They criti-\ncized the association to Al-Shabaab and believed that this attention would worsen\nany negative opinions of Somalis. Nevertheless, these participants generally\nasserted that withdrawing from society on the basis of this would not be a sensible\nsolution for themselves or for other Somalis. In addition, while negative depictions\nin the media do affect them, they argued that this was not to a greater extent than\nother factors of exclusion. As we explained earlier, Somalis in the Netherlands\ngenerally hold a poor socio-economic position as they face high unemployment\nNijenhuis and Van Liempt, 2014). The participants in this cluster elaborated on\nthese issues. They expressed resentment towards Dutch society in regard to their\nperceived low position on the labour market and the general consensus that the\nDutch education system is very tough for minorities. As Van Liempt (2011a,\n2011b) also found, there was still a lingering perception that the UK might be a\nbetter place for Somalis in this regard. One female participant argued that her\nrelatives in England all seemed to go to universities while she felt stuck in MBO\n(the Dutch MBO level is equivalent to US community college level; it is two levels\nlower than university). Her inability to find a decent job was a source of\nfrustration:\nI try so hard to find a job that suits my qualifications, but I don't seem to succeed.\nMy Dutch friend, who had lower results at school then me, had no problem finding\none after we finished. It's not like I am not happy for her, it is just that I can't help\nmyself thinking that she got lucky because she is Dutch. I am not just thinking that\nout of spite, I actually came across this article on Facebook that said that people who\napply for work get discriminated on the basis of their foreign name. Can you imagine?\nMy surname is Mohammed! (Female, aged 24)\nThe above statement echoes what many of these participants believed: while they\nmight not be singled out personally, they do feel that the general public treats\nMuslims differently. There were more parts of their identity that are regularly\nquestioned, they explained. For instance, they felt that their place in society is\noften challenged due to their obviously different skin colour. According to one\nparticipant:\nI would never feel comfortable to go around claiming that I am Dutch. . . Dutch\npeople will always look at you funny and ask `But no seriously, what are you?\nWhat part of Africa were you born?' And [even when] I tell them that I was born here,\nthey will still continue to ask `what I am' as if I don't understand the question, until\nI have enough and just tell them that I am Somali. (Male, aged 18)\nWhat they are `not', or how they differ in relation to Dutch people, thus heavily\ninfluenced the way these participants spoke about their place in Dutch society. This,\nas was made clear, had to do with the persistent awareness of being `different'.\nOne female participant gave the example of a highly publicized incident concerning\npopular right-wing politician Geert Wilders. Wilders spoke at a congregation for his\nparty and asked his supporters the rhetorical question if `we' (presumably Dutch\nsociety) wanted `more or fewer Moroccans'. A moment ensued where a large group\nof people repeatedly shouted `fewer, fewer, fewer!' While the incident was highly\ncontroversial and deemed unacceptable by other politicians, the participant who\nbrought it up argued that she nonetheless felt addressed by this episode.\nShe explained that, while Moroccans might have been the target of the speech, she\n`read between the lines' and felt that it was implied that there should generally be\nfewer Muslims in the Netherlands, and therefore also fewer Somalis. For her, such\nproclamations only continued to hinder a sentiment of feeling `Dutch'. As she\nexplained, `I was once again reminded of being ``the other'' in the situation.'\nThe anecdote above indicates that the continuing portrayal of Muslims as\n`others' discourages a feeling of being part of society. By being a platform where\nnegative opinions about Muslims can take place, media outlets play a role in\nprocesses of exclusion. For these participants, however, such occurrences did not\nautomatically mean that they always felt excluded from Dutch society. The reality\ncan be complicated: especially those who grew up in the Netherlands can feel\nemotionally invested in the country. One young man explained:\nMy cousin who has left Holland for another country teases our Dutch customs, which\nin all honesty annoys me. I become very defensive when someone says something\nnegative about us Dutch. I see it this way, I am allowed to bash them, and you are\nnot. (Male, aged 18)\nThis fragment shows how someone can experience strong ties to Dutch habits and\nculture at certain moments. At the same time, the desire to be seen as fully\nDutch--not only by one's cousin, but also by other Dutch people--may lead to a\nfeeling of frustration. These participants also regarded their position in Dutch society\nin a more positive light in relation to the much more targeted Moroccan population.\nThey believed that most Dutch people associate Muslims with Moroccans\n(or Turks), and felt that their relatively unfamiliar position aided them in a way:\nWe don't get talked about in the media as much as the Moroccans, who are more of a\ntarget group in Holland than we are. . . I suppose because not many know much about\nus we feel that the public is more welcoming and kinder to us Somalis. (Female,\nWithin a context where both groups suffer discrimination in the labour market\nand in the educational system, comparing oneself with a worse victim provides\na positive self-image (Lamont et al., 2012). Research suggest that, due to crim-\ninalized images of Moroccan youth in the media, both native Dutch and other\nmajor immigrant groups--including Dutch Somalis--place Moroccans on the\nbottom of the ethnic hierarchy in the Netherlands (Moors et al., 2009; Nijenhuis\nand Van Liempt, 2014). Our study furthermore indicates that participants\ncompare circumstances to position themselves hierarchically above Moroccans,\nwhose sense of belonging is also regularly challenged (Hagendoorn, 1995;\nIn comparison to the people clustered in the other groups, the participants in\nthis second group experienced a complex sense of belonging. They feel addressed\nby the negative debate, but also experienced shifting feelings of belonging due to\nfactors such as unemployment, low educational success, exclusion on the basis of\ntheir skin colour and the general different treatment of Muslims. All these issues\nhinder truly feeling `at home' or `accepted'. Simultaneously, these individuals did\nconsider themselves part of Dutch society and negotiated their low social position\nby comparing themselves to more `severe' victims, such as the Moroccan popula-\ntion. Their experiences demonstrate that belonging is a highly situational and\ndynamic process, and underlines that people's sense of inclusion/exclusion\ncannot be analysed without taking into account their social location (Valentine\nExpressing a low sense of belonging\nFor a few participants, the negative media debate seemed to cause a lot of resent-\nment and concern. While the other respondents also believed the media presented\ndichotomizing stories, these participants felt more concerned with how bad ima-\ngery of Muslim communities and Islam affected them as individuals and as a\ncommunity. In contrast to the participants in the other groups, they also made\nfewer distinctions between Somalis and other Muslim communities in the\nNetherlands. Because of their strong religious affiliation, they reasoned, if one\nMuslim is attacked, Muslims as a whole are attacked. For these participants,\nrepeated negative discourses on Muslims were a clear indication that the Dutch\nwere hostile towards them. For some, this was reason to actively disengage.\nAccording to one participant:\nWhen your culture gets mocked in the newspapers, day after day, you get fed up. You\nwant to defend yourself by arming yourself with more knowledge, so that you can\nfight the discrimination that they throw at you. (Male, aged 26)\nThe participants clustered in this group agreed that a person cannot feel at home in\na place where he/she is constantly looked down upon and criticised. For them, the\nmedia had a large role in perpetuating these negative feelings. Some male\nparticipants explained that other specific events in their life had also made them\nreconsider their place in Dutch society. One such occurrence was when Dutch\nauthorities started to profile the Somali community at airports. They shared anec-\ndotes of how they were held for hours at an airport, only to find out that airport\nsecurity wanted to know why they went to Kenya or Somalia. This group viewed\nbeing stopped and searched as a blatant form of racism. They confessed feeling\nanger and resentment, mostly because they felt discriminated against and targeted\nas Muslims by the Dutch authorities.\nSignificantly, some participants also stated that negative images of Somalis as\nMuslim extremists could lead to problems within the Somali community. One\nparticipant explained that if the media constantly produces negative stories regard-\ning Dutch Somalis, then it will have an impact, not only on how the general public\nviews them, but also on how Somalis view themselves:\nThe Dutch will be apprehensive about us as they will see us as a threat to their society\nand their values. And then we have those within the Somali community who will feel\npowerless to counteract and instead become what they initially opposed. (Female,\nSeveral participants feared that teenagers would be particularly influenced by what\nis written in the media. According to them, the younger Somali generation already\nstruggles with their identity as they have to navigate between their Dutch and\nSomali backgrounds. Simultaneously, their religion is misconstrued in the media.\nA number of participants thus worried that young people who feel increasingly\nisolated, partly as a result of the false representation of their community and reli-\ngion, would turn to dangerous types of information to get a positive sense of\nbelonging. According to one woman:\nWe have older generations who don't know what to do with their children and\nyounger generations who don't feel at home anywhere. We seek out ways to belong\nand in this day and age it's all about the internet. [Young] people don't know much\nabout religion and instead of going to the mosque and getting the proper Islamic\neducation; young boys and girls go on these internet forums and get the wrong infor-\nmation. Information that is harmful to their minds, because they become radicalised\nand everyone becomes their enemy in a path where they want to find themselves.\nJacobs, 2009) have suggested that there is a link between experiences of isolation\nand discrimination, a negatively charged discourse on Islam, and sensitivity to\nradical forms of Islam. Such findings coupled with the arguments by our partici-\npants suggest that exclusion--through the media and other mechanisms--can\ncause considerable emotional damage. One participant affirmed the emotional\nstrain, explaining that the more negative reporting on Muslims and Islam he\nexperienced, the more disillusioned by Dutch society he felt:\nIf someone asked me if I felt at home in Holland, I would say no. I don't even see\nmyself living here permanently. My parents brought me here, but I am surely not\ngoing to die here. I honestly believe that my values are incompatible with Holland or\nany Western country. Eventually all of us Somalis will have to leave; the Dutch are\nbecoming intolerant towards the Muslims. So it's either conform or be deviant, at this\npoint I believe I need to be true to myself. (Male, aged 22)\nThe narratives in this last section indicate that, for some of the individuals who\nparticipated in this study, the media has a negative impact on feelings of belonging.\nIn contrast to the other groups, these participants explained not only that they\nperceive the debate as excluding, but also that they want to distance themselves\nfrom mainstream Dutch society as a result. The difference with the other respondents\ncan largely be explained by the fact that these participants respond to the negative\ndiscourse through asserting their religious, and not their Somali, background. As\nsuch, their stories illustrate that people may strengthen particular in-group ties in the\nface of the perceived discrimination and exclusion of their group (Allport, 1954;\nthese participants are arguably the most critical of the negative discourse, they\nappear to challenge the dichotomous style found in the media the least, as they\nhave seemingly adopted this way of thinking to a large extent themselves (Aly, 2007).\nConclusion\nOver the last two decades, an increase in the number of news items on Muslims has\noccurred in West European countries (Vanparys et al., 2013). The Netherlands was\nin the past known as tolerant, particularly to religious newcomers, but as Lucassen\nand Lucassen (2015) describe, a `strange death of Dutch tolerance' seems to have\noccurred. As we have shown above, academic work has confirmed a stronger focus\non anti-Islamism and anti-Muslim sentiments, at first driven by global conflicts but\nfurther magnified through a reasoning of assumed divergences on the basis of\ndiscourse' that Said described in 1978 reappeared. Just like racism and xenopho-\nbia--exclusion based on physical characteristic or nationality--this recent anti-\nIslamism or islamophobia--exclusion based on religious characteristics--is\nrooted in a tendency to exclude supposed outsiders, i.e. `othering'. In this article,\nwe have focused on how the media influences the way minority groups relate to\ntheir respective societies. To explore this relationship, we have examined whether\nmedia discourses on Muslims impact on the way Dutch Somalis understand their\nsense of `belonging' in the Netherlands.\nWe have assessed the relationship between media discourses and experiences of\nbelonging by trying to answer two sub-questions: are media discourses indeed\nregarded as exclusionary by our Dutch Somali participants, and if so, what is\nthe effect on their experiences of belonging? Using our empirical data, we have\nshown that participants were concerned by the discourse. They unanimously stated\nthat news stories too often approach Muslim citizens as `Others' and regularly\nassociate them and their religion with fanaticism or terrorism. Dutch Somali par-\nticipants regarded this discourse as degrading and not in line with how they per-\nceive their own community. Our findings thus confirm that the current debate is\npredominantly experienced as negative and excluding in nature (Cottle, 2000;\nHowever, our data also showed that a negatively experienced media debate does\nnot affect everyone in the same way. A large group upheld attachments to both\ntheir Dutch and Somali backgrounds, and regard belonging as a situational matter\nthat is affected by media discourses as well as by other factors. This confirmed the\ndynamic, intersectional nature of belonging and underlined the importance of\nand Waite, 2011; Yuval-Davis, 2006). Interestingly, our data also uncovered that\nopposing reactions can ensue in regard to the negative discourse: we found\ninstances of both the denial of victimization and the strengthening of in-group\nties (Allport, 1954). Within the former group, the participants stressed belonging\nin the Netherlands despite the negative discourse, and downplayed their Muslim\nbackground by favoring their `Dutchness'. In contrast, participants within the\nlatter group strongly affirmed their group's distinctiveness and emphasized that\nreporting in the media displays how being Dutch and being Muslim are incompat-\nible. The variation in responses means that, while the debate is generally considered\nas excluding in nature, experiences of belonging are affected in various ways.\nWhereas all participants perceive a negative debate, some figuratively and discur-\nsively `join' a global Muslim community as result of this and classify themselves as\na group despite many within-group differences. Others try their best to avoid asso-\nciation with a worldwide Muslim alliance and emphasize within-group variances,\nsuch as with the Moroccans (creating new ethnic hierarchies in the process).\nWhile this might seem contradictory, we have argued that these conflicting reac-\ntions are not as opposed as they seem to be. In the theoretical section, we outlined\nAllport's conception that people commonly respond to exclusion by either oppos-\ning the group that supposedly discriminates, or by finding a way to narrow the gap\nbetween the two conflicting groups (Allport, 1954). The results of our study illus-\ntrate both of these mechanisms, as they clearly show how the conflicting reactions\naim to counter the same problems: `othering' and victimization. This perspective,\nwe found, has thus far not been discussed sufficiently in studies of Muslims and the\nmedia. Many studies focus on the opposition to exclusion, or follow Allport's basic\nidea in treating the two responses as being largely independent from one another.\nIn contrast, we aim to show that there is added value in treating them together and\nin light of each other. The strengthening of in-group ties revealed that questions of\nbelonging assume salience when people feel that they are not truly included in\nsociety; consolidating in-group bonds can be used as a defensive response\n\u00a8 ney, 2010). In many ways, our study therefore supports other\nresearch on minority stigmatization that posits that exclusion often leads to\nincreased group solidarity and the affirmation of ethnic or religious bonds\n(Gu\n2008). On the other hand, we have also argued that constructing oneself as unaf-\nfected by debates in the media and distancing oneself from the in-group (in this\ncase, Muslims and sometimes other Somalis) may seem counter-intuitive, but that\nthis enables people to dissociate themselves from simplistic coverage of their iden-\nthat signify them as `others' gives participants the opportunity to challenge the\nboundaries that are used within this medium (and beyond), and by claiming rec-\nognition, they find possibilities to belong (Lamont et al., 2012). By taking into\nconsideration the varying responses to the same problem, our qualitative analysis\nwas able to highlight the many complex ways people are able to maneuver around\nan excluding discourse and come to grips with belonging.\nThe variety of ways with which minority subjects can negotiate unequally dis-\ntributed social power means that there is no straight answer to how Dutch Somalis\ninterpret media discourses on Muslims. Yet the use of the concept of belonging in\nthis case helps us to see that there is a complex relationship between excluding\nforces and `feeling part of the social fabric' (Anthias, 2008: 8). Our research find-\nings illustrate that, while media discourses impose boundaries from the `outside',\nthese boundaries can be either reproduced or reconstructed from the `inside'.\nConsidering that the `othering' of Muslims in the media is unlikely to cease in\nthe near future, upcoming scholarship could take into account some more of the\nsocial consequences that excluding processes in the media can bring about. Racist,\nxenophobic and islamophobic reasoning in the public sphere, can lead to justifica-\ntion of discriminatory and violent acts in other social fields which, in the end, can\neven undermine more general human rights. It is becoming increasingly urgent to\nstand up against such developments.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication\nof this article.\nNotes\n1. We focus on grown-up Somalis between 18 and 30 years old in the Netherlands. At the\nSomalis in the Netherlands. Most of these Somalis are recent refugees arrived after 1996\nand were born in Somalia. A second generation born in the Netherlands (30% of the\ntotal) is growing up. Of all, 99.7% of Somalis are Muslims. The young adults in this study\nmostly arrived as kids and grew up in The Netherlands.\n2. The difference between an Islamic and a western world only exists in terms of discourses.\nThe cold war between East and West was replaced by contradictions between religious/\ntraditional Muslim and former Christians who are supposed to have become modern and\nprogressive (rich countries in Western Europe + the USA and Canada). In reality parts\nof Europe might be very similar to the Middle East, and the differences within the Middle\nEast are huge. Israel can be classified on the modern side and on the religious side,\ndepending on one's political views. And with the establishment of Al Jazeera-English\nthe dividing line between `western' and Middle Eastern media has become less clear.\n3. Koomen and Van Heelsum (2013) compared the opinions of Muslim populations and\ntheir leaders in Germany, The Netherlands, Switzerland, France, Belgium and the UK,\nto the tone of the debate in these countries. Depending on the country, only 15% to 32%\nof the actors were Muslims in the newspapers. Their research shows that Muslim leaders\nof organizations often feel they have to defend Muslims in the debate.\n4. On behalf of The Open Society Foundation Nijenhuis and Van Liempt examined 74 news\nitems containing `Somalia', `Somalis' and `Somali' between 14 October 2012 and 14 April\n5. The figures are combined numbers of records from the UK (around 100), Denmark (2)\n6. There were four focus group discussions held for this research. In this article, however, we\nhave left out one discussion with Somali men and women between the ages of 35\u00ad65.\nTheir exposure to coverage on Somalis in The Netherlands differed heavily from the\nyounger participants, who primarily use Dutch media sources. In contrast, the older\ngeneration preferred to use or consult media from their own country of origin more often.\n7.
