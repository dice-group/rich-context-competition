A convenience\nsample of 120 households selected in the Gaza Strip was administered using two self-reported instruments: WHOQOL-\nBREF (WHO Quality of Life-BREF) adapted to the Palestinian context, and items adapted from the Teacher Involvement\nof Parents (TIP) Questionnaire. The quantitative results showed interactions between different domains of quality of life--\nnamely, basic needs (B = .361, p < .01) and psychological distress (B = .307, p < .05)--while perceptions of education had\na statistically significant effect on school satisfaction. Three main themes emerged from the qualitative survey: economic\nconstraints, constraints on the school environment, and issues with the curriculum. The ongoing disruption of general\neconomic, environmental, health, and living conditions affects the domain of education, contributing to further undermining\nopportunities for improvements in subjective well-being and familial quality of life.\n",

In fact, the community fre-\nquently views education as a means of providing hope and a\nbetter future for the youth. In addition, providing education\nin response to conflict and to promote early recovery may be\nconsidered a key element of humanitarian aid, along with\nfood and water, shelter, and health (Machel, 2001). The\nimportance of education in war-affected areas is emphasized\nin the 2011 Education for All (EFA) Global Monitoring\nReport, The Hidden Crisis: Armed Conflict and Education\n(United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization [UNESCO], 2011). According to this report,\nwars in poor regions are one of the obstacles to strengthening\nthe role of education systems in preventing poverty and\nenhancing QoL in civilian populations. In war-affected\nregions, it is estimated that 28 million school-aged children\nare unable to attend primary school, accounting for 42% of\nthe world's out-of-school children. The countries in which\nthey live are often characterized by protracted internal politi-\ncal violence, in turn associated with exploitation, juvenile\nlabor, imprisonment, and overall abuse (Barakat, Connolly,\nHardman, & Sundaram, 2013). Frequently, schools, teachers,\nand pupils are considered to be combatants and therefore tar-\ngeted (UNESCO, 2011). Few studies have examined the\nfield of education in emergencies and post-conflict transition\nscenarios. It is therefore crucial to conduct further research\non the link between the reconstruction and enhancement of\nthe educational system, and the contribution of education to\n1University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy\n2Remedial Education Center, Jabalia, oPt, Gaza Strip\nCorresponding Author:\nGuido Veronese, Fellow Researcher in Clinical Psychology, Family\nPsychotherapist ad Trauma intervention specialist, Department of Human\nSciences \"R.

There are a small number of country-based\ncase studies that set out to conceptualize the \"impact of edu-\ncation\" on protective and risk factors for subjective well-\nGiven the complexity of the phenomenon, it seems crucial\nto explore the ecological dimensions affecting people's QoL,\nviewing education as a factor that is closely connected with\nthe environmental, socio-relational, and individual domains\nof well-being (Boothby, Strang, & Wessels, 2006; Thabet,\nVeronese, Castiglioni, Barola, & Said, 2012).\nArecent work based on data from focus group discussions\nwith different groups of Palestinians on the determinants of\nQoL (literally translated into Arabic as \"Jawdatal-hayat\")\nfound that participants' perceptions could be grouped into\nfour domains: the financial situation, the consequences of\nongoing military occupation for people's lives, the internal\nPalestinian context (e.g., lack of basic needs), and family\nissues (Giacaman et al., 2007). More focused cross-sectional\nquantitative studies of representative samples of households\nin the Gaza Strip found that, generally speaking, Palestinian\nscores on QoL measures (physical, psychological and envi-\nronmental) were lower than in other countries (Abu-Rmeileh\nsized military occupation, war, and constraints imposed by\nmilitary violence as local determinants of QoL (Giacaman\ntwo \"macro\" dimensions of QoL: a first factor called per-\nsonal well-being (composed of both objective and subjective\naspects) and a second called political well-being (composed\nof both micro- and macro-contextual dimensions) including\nthe role of education as a form of resistance that promotes\nBased on the viewpoint that education is an important\ncomponent and determinant of QoL, we set out to explore\nthe following variables: on the one hand, parental satisfac-\ntion with schools and education (education; Khamis, 2013),\nand on the other, multiple domains of QoL, namely, (dis)\nsatisfaction with living environment (environment), safety\nand security (human security; Giacaman et al., 2007), stress-\nful living conditions (psychological distress; Thabet, Abed,\nfamily relationships (family; Thabet, Ibraheem, Shivram,\nWorking within from the perspectives on QoL just out-\nlined, our mixed-method study had the aim of exploring how\nfamilies' perceptions of education might be influenced by the\navailability of resources promoting well-being and the ability\nto cope with political and military violence. We hypothesized\nthat education would be a factor in well-being that was influ-\nenced by and circularly influenced the other QoL domains. In\nother words, we expected that education could not be isolated\nfrom other determinants of QoL and health. The study com-\nprised both quantitative and qualitative components, and the\nresults were analyzed and compared to construct a broader\npicture of families' perceptions of education, school, and\nchildhood in the Gaza Strip.\nThe Study Context\nPalestinians commonly experience direct and indirect expo-\nsure to violence, especially those living in the Gaza Strip;\npolitical violence has led to restrictions being imposed on the\nmovement of Palestinian goods and people across borders\nand within the Palestine territories: These restrictions have\nseriously compromised the welfare of households, giving\nrise to a loss of income, decreased quantity and quality of\nfood, and a lack of access to health care (Mataria et al., 2009;\nSince 2000, poverty has risen dramatically, with more\nthan 38.8% of Palestinians currently living below the pov-\nerty line (less than US$2/person/day; Palestinian Central\nJune 2012 saw the beginning of the sixth year of the\nintensified blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip by Israel.\nThe 5-year closure had and currently continues to have\ndisastrous effects on the lives of the 1.6 million of people\ninhabiting these 365 square kilometers of land, in every\nrespect: social, economic, political, educational, and in\nterms of human security (Safadi & Easton, 2014). The mea-\nsures applied to restrict the movement of people and goods\nleave the Palestinian population trapped in a vast, unhealthy\njail (Abu-Rmeileh et al., 2009). It is genuinely difficult to\ntravel outside the Strip; the restrictions have negative conse-\nquences: they prevent the inhabitants of Gaza from traveling\nabroad for training or study purposes or from keeping down\na job in Israel, and they also reinforce the distance and sepa-\nration from the Palestinian community in the West Bank\nOperation \"Cast Lead\" was initiated in December 2009.\nOfficially justified as a response to the firing of rockets from\nthe Strip under the leadership of Hamas, it worsened a situ-\nation that was already highly unstable. During the 23 days of\nthe Israeli military offensive, over 1,380 Palestinians were\nkilled, including more than 300 children and civilians\nthe Israeli Air Force (IAF) launched an airstrike that tar-\ngeted and killed the acting chief of Hamas' armed wing,\nAhmed Al Jabari, marking the start of the Israeli military\naction (\"Operation Defensive Pillar\") that lasted for 8 days.\nEarly accounts indicate that 174 Palestinians were killed,\nincluding at least 43 children and 11 women. According to\nthe Ministry of Health, 1,399 Palestinians were also injured.\nSix Israelis (4 civilians and 2 soldiers) were killed and 224\nunits were destroyed or sustained major damage, while\nanother 1,700 houses suffered minor damage. At the height\nof the conflict, approximately 12,000 individuals in Gaza\nCity and the governorate of Northern Gaza fled their homes\nVeronese et al. 3\nand sought refuge in emergency shelters set up in 14 United\nNations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and 2 govern-\nment schools.

We completed our survey in the run up to\nFinally, the most recent episode in the conflict was the\ndevastating Israeli attack named Operation Protective Edge\nUNRWA, were bombed or damaged, with the full extent of\ndamage still unknown according to the latest report by the\nU.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n(OCHA, United Nations Office for the Coordination of\nHumanitarian Affairs occupied Palestinian territory, 2014).\nCurrently, most of the school buildings are in bad repair\nand in need of maintenance; usually there are no play-\ngrounds or classrooms equipped for extra-curricular activi-\nties. Extreme overcrowding in schools and the double shift\nsystem have negative consequences for the quality of educa-\ntion: the school day is shortened, there is neither time nor\nstaff for after-school activities, and it is impossible for\nteachers to adequately follow up all their students (Jabr,\n2009). Furthermore, the restrictions on movement do not\nallow the school staff to attend training courses or work-\nshops outside Gaza and therefore to keep the educational\nsystem abreast of developments in educational science.\nWithin this overall framework, little or no support is pro-\nvided to children with disabilities or learning difficulties;\nthere is effectively no policy of inclusion in force. As a\nresult, in many cases children with difficulties are with-\ndrawn from school and kept at home.\nAlthough the Palestinians are nonetheless considered to\nbe one of the most educated Arab peoples--and this is the\ntrend also in the Gaza Strip with a literacy rate of 96% in\n2010--the lack of opportunity to study abroad and the high\nunemployment rate make parents very pessimistic with\nregard to their children's future careers.\nMethod\nParticipants\nA convenience sample of 120 individuals was randomly\nselected at a private school managed by a well-established\nlocal non-governmental organization (NGO) and located\nin the Jabalya area. We chose to conduct our pilot study\nwith participants recruited at a private school in which it\nwas possible to select a stratified socio-economic sample.\nSpecifically, the NGO running the private school involved\nin our research was able to balance higher and middle-\nincome families with very poor families who were eligible\nfor an internationally funded sponsorship program enabling\nchildren from low-income populations to attend a high\nquality educational program. This choice allowed us to\npilot our research design with a non-representative but\ndemographically well-balanced sample.\nSixty married couples with school-aged children com-\npleted a questionnaire designed to collect information about\nparents' own levels of QoL and their satisfaction with the\neducational system. Specifically, 60 fathers (M\nage\nage\nrange = 18-55) participated in the survey. The selected fam-\nilies had five children on average (M = 4.6). More specifi-\ncally, women aged 18 to 25 years had a mean of 3.5 children,\nto 45 years 5.2 children. The percentage of school-aged\nage\nprivate schools, 33% UNRWA schools, and 21% public\nschools.

Researchers use this sampling method if potential\ninformants are rare or limited to a very small subgroup of\nthe population. This type of sampling technique is based\non chain referral. After collecting data from an initial\ninformant, the researcher asks this participant to help iden-\ntify people with similar characteristics and so on (Babbie,\nInstruments and Procedures\nWHO Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF). The QoL of the\nparents was measured using items from the WHOQOL-\nBREF (Skevington, Sartorius, & Amir, 2004). This instru-\nment was developed as a means of assessing health and\nwell-being that goes beyond objective descriptions of fatal\nand non-fatal health outcomes and includes individuals' sub-\njective, affective, and cognitive appraisals of states of health.\nIt has facilitated cross-cultural comparisons of QoL (World\nHealth Organization [WHO], 1993). The WHOQOL-Bref\ninstrument aims to assess individuals' perceptions in the\ncontext of their culture and value systems and of their per-\nsonal goals, standards, and concerns (WHO, 1993). The\ninstrument consists of 26 questions measuring--by aggre-\ngating respondents' answers to the different questions and\napplying an appropriate rescaling strategy--the broad\ndomains of physical health, psychological health, social rela-\ntionships, and environment. A set of questions related to the\nPalestinian context has been added to the instrument and\n4 SAGE Open\nvalidated by the Institute of Community and Public Health of\nBirzeit University (Abu-Rmeileh et al., 2009; Mataria et al.,\n2009). On the basis of these additional questions, Giacaman\nand colleagues (Mataria et al., 2009) identified the main\nclusters of determinants of QoL, as well as the outcomes of\nQoL, in Palestinian samples (West Bank and Gaza Strip).\nTranslation, adaptation, and validation of the resulting Pales-\ntinian QoL instrument (PQoL) were carried out in 2005 by\nRita Giacaman with a team from the Institute of Public\nHealth at Birzeit University (Giacaman et al., 2007). The\nPQoL questions are grouped into five domains (physical,\npsychological, social, environmental, and war) using the\nalgorithm proposed by the WHOQOL team, with each\ndomain earning scores from 0 to 100 and higher scores indi-\ncating better QoL. The fifth domain relates to war-like con-\nditions and the influence of the Israeli occupation on\nPalestinian QoL and is a context-specific addition to the ear-\nlier WHO instrument as mentioned above. In line with the\nresearch aims of the current study, selected items from the\nPQoL were grouped into the following dimensions: basic\nhuman security (3 items;  = .721), psychological distress (4\nTeacher Involvement of Parents (TIP) Questionnaire.Finally,\nto assess the satisfaction of parents' with their involvement\nby the schools, items adapted from the TIP Questionnaire\n(Hoover-Dempsey, Walker, Jones, & Reed, 2002) were\nadministered. More specifically, participants completed\neight items from the Beliefs About Parental Involvement\nsubscale (answers provided on a 5-point Likert-type scale;\nThe present study adopted a mixed-method approach pri-\nmarily because this kind of research design lends itself to\nconnecting micro, meso, and macro levels of explanation of\nCreswell, 2009). Indeed, comprehension of a complex phe-\nnomenon such as parents' school satisfaction encompasses\nan array of factors affecting the family's evaluation of school\ncontexts and involves different levels of explanation: from\nthe micro-system level (e.g., demographic variables such as\ngender, age, and socio-economic status; Pepe & Addimando,\n2014) to the meso-system (e.g., network of relationships,\nsocial support) and, finally, the macro-system (e.g., the envi-\nronmental and economic situation).\nThe data analysis comprised two steps: first, the quantita-\ntive measures and demographic information about partici-\npants were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression\ntechniques to identify the main determinants of school satis-\nfaction; then, the quantitative results were cross-validated\nand integrated with the qualitative findings via thematic\ncontent analysis of the in-depth interview transcripts. This\nkind of mixed-method strategy is known as complementary\nanalysis (Bazeley & Kemp, 2012), and it is usually used to\ncomplete, enhance, and detail a significant whole, with each\npiece of quantitative and qualitative information contribut-\ning to building up a total representation.\nMore specifically, in the quantitative analysis, hierarchi-\ncal multiple regression (see Cohen & Cohen, 2003; Stanovich\n& Cunningham, 2004, for methodological procedures) was\nused to explore the impact of specific measures of well-being\non school satisfaction when the effect of gender, age, and\nfamily income were controlled for. To this end, the enter\nmethod was used to add the independent variables step by\nstep in the desired order: demographic variables (age, gen-\nder, and family income) were entered first, the PQoL mea-\nsures (basic needs, social support, human security,\npsychological distress, and family support) were entered\nnext at Step 2, and, finally, interaction terms were evaluated\nat Step 3 (All Quantitative Measures \u00d7 Gender). The regres-\nsion model was assessed at each step for statistically signifi-\ncant variation in the coefficient of determination (R2).\nUnstandardized beta weights (B) were also used to assess the\nvariables added to the regression model (Meier, Brudney, &\nBohte, 2012). All data were checked for potential violation\nof regression assumptions (i.e., homoscedasticity, multivari-\nate normality; see Petrocelli, 2003, for further detail) and\nMahalanobis distances (at p > .001) were calculated to iden-\ntify and skip multivariate outliers.\nThe interviews with the families were conducted follow-\ning an ethnographic procedure (see above for details of the\nsnowball sampling recruitment method): The participants\nwere asked to speak about their living conditions and their\nchildren's experience at school in a context characterized by\nongoing conflict and occupation. To analyze the qualitative\ndata, thematic content analysis was applied (see Braun &\nClarke, 2006 for background on this methodological proce-\ndure) to the interview transcripts to inductively identify com-\nmon themes regarding parents'perceptions and evaluation of\nschool-related issues. To this end, the authors first transcribed\nall the interviews, then, within a single unit of text (i.e., an\ninterview), similar themes were grouped together, collapsed\nand labeled according to their explicit meanings (this process\nwas repeated for all the interviews), and, finally, the occur-\nrences of the categories thus identified were counted to\nassess which themes were more salient within the texts.\nResults\nIn Table 1, we present descriptive statistics regarding QoL in\nPalestinian families.\nWith regard to demographic variables, gender was posi-\ntively correlated with satisfaction with education (r = .310,\np < .01): specifically, women were more satisfied with edu-\ncation than men, while number of children was negatively\ncorrelated with basic needs (r = -.390, p < .01), social sup-\nport (r = -.281, p < .05), and satisfaction with the educa-\ntional context (r = -.246, p < .01). In addition, parents' level\nof education was positively correlated with basic needs\nVeronese et al. 5\nhuman security (r = .216, p < .01), and negatively with psy-\nchological distress (r = -.186, p < .05) and number of chil-\ndren (r = -.300, p < .05).

Social support is positively cor-\nrelated with basic needs (r = .463, p < .01) and sense of secu-\nrity and safety (r = .247, p < .01), whereas environmental\nconditions are negatively correlated with psychological dis-\ntress (r = -.318, p < .01). Finally, the dimension of education\nis positively correlated with basic needs (r = .250, p < .01)\nand social support (r = .294, p < .01); in other words, the\nmore families were satisfied with their living conditions and\nfelt that they had a good relational network supporting them,\nthe more they felt satisfied with the education system. When\nthe effect of satisfaction with basic needs were controlled\nfor, first-order positive correlations were confirmed between\nsocial support (r = .259, p < .01) and human security\ndimensions.\nThree-step multiple regression analyses were conducted\nto assess the influence of selected quantitative variables\n(determinants) on the dependent variable satisfaction with\neducation (see Table 3).\nshowed statistically significant effects, whereas age did not.\ngender was still statistically significant (B = 3.31, p < .001)\nwhereas age and income were not. On the contrary, basic\nneeds (B = .361, p < .01) and psychological distress (B =\n.307, p < .05) had a statistically significant effect on school\nsatisfaction, while other quantitative measures (social sup-\nport, human security, family support) did not. At Step 2, a\nhighly statistically significant variation of R2 (r2 = .125),\ntion of R2 was not statistically significant (r2 = -.025), F(1,\nmultiplicative terms (QOL_variables \u00d7 Gender) in the\nregression equation did not explain significantly more vari-\nance with respect to Step 2. Finally, all the multiplicative\nthat none of them had an effect that was statistically signifi-\ncant enough to justify their inclusion in the model.\nDiscussion\nAnalysis of the main themes in the qualitative data may be\nused to qualify our discussion of the picture that emerged\nfrom the quantitative regression analysis, in which satisfac-\ntion of basic needs (based on family income) along with\ndegree of psychological distress (a negative correlate of\nbasic need fulfillment) displayed statistically significant\neffects on school satisfaction. The thematic content analysis\nrences) identified, in the words of the participating parents,\nthree main categories of relevant themes (please note that\ntwo or more themes could feature in a single interview): eco-\nnomic constraints (58%), constraints on school environment\n(41%), and teaching curriculum issues (38%).\nEconomic constraints. The economic domain emerged as the\nmain factor limiting access to adequate education and school-\nnomic resources, lack of water and electricity, family\nfinancial circumstances, unemployment, and dependence on\ninternational aid were all factors making access to higher\neducation, in particular, increasingly difficult and uncertain\n(Ziadni et al., 2011). This issue was cited by 58% of inter-\nviewees. With regard to educational opportunities for chil-\ndren, access to high quality schools is severely limited due to\nfamily poverty. Despite strong awareness that future of the\nyounger generations hinges on educational opportunities,\nsevere economic limitations mean that parents are unable to\nguarantee good careers to their children (Khamis, 2013).\nI didn't re-enroll my son at the Salaam school because my\nfinancial situation is very bad and I wanted to enroll him at the\nUNRWA school but, again, I'm not able to do that because I\ndon't have his certificate.

(F.A.F., 42 years, housewife)\nThe number of children per family plays a key role in\ndiminishing education opportunities: considering that the\nlowest income families have the highest numbers of chil-\ndren, it is easy to infer the difficulties encountered by these\nfamilies in trying to ensure an adequate level of education for\nall their offspring (Thabet et al., 2009). Nonetheless, the\nmajority of parents explicitly mention the importance of edu-\ncation for personal and societal development:\nEducation is important because it makes society develop;\neducated people deal well with other people and better than\nuneducated ones. (O.A., 38 years, housewife)\nIt is really important for our children, especially for women:\nthey will be able teach their children. Moreover, it is the basis\nfor life and it builds society. It is especially important for\nPalestinians because of the situation we are living in. It is easier\nto deal with educated than with un-educated people.

The conditions of the school are gener-\nally cited (41% of respondents) by the parents as a major\nsource of problems: Overcrowding appears to be the leading\nissue in the eyes of families. Overcrowded classrooms under-\nmine the school environment and affect the work of teachers\nwho are forced to follow up on too many students.

(A.W.,\nThere are crowded classrooms, this means that students' right to\neducation is not respected; this also means that most of them are\nprevented from following the lessons. Moreover, the schools are\nfar from our homes, the families need transport for their children\nand sometimes their financial situation doesn't allow them to\nprovide for this. (D.S., 39, housewife).\nSchool curriculum issues.\nTeaching methods, curriculum\nissues and poor teacher behavior were cited by 38% of\nrespondents. The families reported low-quality school curri-\ncula as a consequence of disimprovements in the social wel-\nfare system. Despite the Palestinian Authority's traditional\ncommitment to providing 100% scholarization, lack of\nresources and lack of political self-determination drastically\nreduce the means available to ensure high-standard school\ncurricula and methods (Giacaman et al., 2009). The deterio-\nration in the higher education system has also undermined\nthe training of teachers and administrators, negatively influ-\nencing school teaching programs and educational methods.\nIn this regard, two major sources of complaint emerged: (a)\nthe teaching program and (b) teachers' level of training and\nprofessionalism. In the first case, parents frequently used\nterms such as too difficult and too vast to refer to the school\ncurriculum, which has not been developed or fitted to suit the\noverall context in the Gaza Strip. In addition, working with\nseverely curtailed economic and financial resources forces\nschools to reduce the number and the variety of extra-curric-\nular activities and the families seemed to identify this as a\nfurther lack (Veronese, Castiglioni, & Said, 2010).\nThe curriculum is difficult and it is not suitable for the students'\nages. Moreover, schools do not give students the chance to\ndecide what to study in the future; at school, students do not\nstudy subjects in depth, but just superficially. Moreover, at\nschool the students do not get to put into practice the notions that\nthey have learnt. (J.A., 31 years, general worker)\nThere are no summer camps, no activities and the teachers are\nreally bad with the students: that's why children don't like going\nto school. (M.D., 31 years, housewife)\nThere is no educational material, no activities, no entertainment.\n(A.W., 44 years, doctor)\nWith regard to teachers' professionalism, parents expressed\nconcern with both teacher quality and school organization.\nThis category encompassed a wide array of school dimen-\nsions: from teachers' lack of interest to poor school\u00adparent\ncommunication to rudeness on the part of teachers and in a\nsmall number of cases corporal punishment at school.\nThe quality of education is not good because some teachers are\nbad. (F.A.F., 43 years, housewife)\nThere is a bad communication between parents and teachers and\nstudents. The teachers are not good; the quality of education is\nnot good.

Moreover, when we went to the school, we discovered\nthat our son had not been doing his homework for a long time\nand the teachers had not informed us about this. I spoke with\nthem about the uncorrected answers, they said \"it is only a small\nthing and we are human and we can make mistakes,\" but in the\nend I think that the teachers are not professional. (A.G., 33\nyears, office worker)\nOnce my daughter's teacher said bad words to her. Moreover,\nwhen we went to the school we could not find the person in\ncharge of running it. (A.M., 42 years, engineer)\nIn sum, this last theme reflects the quantitative result\nshowing that social support as a determinant of QoL is\npositively correlated with socio-economic status (Massad\net al., 2011). In fact, higher socio-economic status can\nalso ensure better social opportunities for children at\nschool; parents view the higher standards of teaching in\nprivate schools as a crucial opportunity for their children,\ncompared with the poor social environment provided by\npublic schools.\nConclusion\nAlthough Palestinians continue to be among the best-\neducated peoples in war and poverty affected zones (H\u00f8igilt,\nof general economic, environmental, health, and living con-\nditions also affects the education domain, contributing to\nfurther undermining opportunities for improvements in\nsubjective well-being and familial QoL (Batniji, 2013;\nHammoudeh, Hogan, & Giacaman, 2013). Families are\nforced into a paradox: on the one hand, they identify educa-\ntion as the one of the few opportunities for their children to\ncope with adversity and daily suffering; on the other, they\nsee excellent educational opportunities as an extremely\nremote prospect for the children of Gaza (Khamis, 2013).\nFrom another perspective, vindication of the right to good\neducation opportunities shifts the difficulties of Palestinian\nfamilies from a \"humanitarian\" to a human security and\nhuman development framework (Barber, 2013; Ziadni\n8 SAGE Open\nLimitations\nLike other studies in this area of research, the present work\nhas some limitations that should be taken into account in\ninterpreting its findings. First, the research was conducted\nwith a convenience sample recruited in a specific area of\nJabalya and does not reflect the heterogeneity of the\nPalestinian milieu. This, along with the relatively small\nsample recruited for this pilot study, precluded us from con-\nducting more sophisticated statistical analyses and means\nthat caution is required in generalizing the findings to other\npopulations. In particular, our non-representative though\ndemographically well-balanced sample may have caused\nbias in terms of the overrepresentation of certain socio-eco-\nnomic sectors within Palestinian society. Second, percep-\ntions of QoL, satisfaction with education, levels of\ninvolvement, and participants' socio-economic status (i.e.,\nincome, quality of neighborhood) may be interrelated and,\nconsequently, the findings may be affected by an interactive\nconfounding factor. Third, we tested for linear associations\nbetween selected determinants and QoL; however, some\nstudies have identified a curvilinear relationship between\nenvironmental characteristics and the different domains of\nsatisfaction. Further studies should be conducted, especially\nfrom a cross-cultural perspective, with a view to developing\na more in-depth understanding of the potential differences\namong determinants as well as differences in how they may\ninteract to affect QoL.\nImplications\nEducational intervention and empowerment should adopt\nmore \"ease\"-oriented perspectives, acting on the ecology of\nsuffering and restoring competence and dignity to Palestinian\ncitizens who are experiencing ongoing occupation and\nchronic political and military violence. In conclusion, the\npolitical dimension of well-being could provide practical\nguidance for international aid system and national policy\nagendas, as well as for human rights governmental and non-\ngovernmental agencies.\nDespite the limitations of this pilot study, field experience\nand international research on education in contexts of politi-\ncal violence confirm our findings (Brown, 2011; Novelli &\nLopes Cardozo, 2008). We consider it crucial to continue to\nfocus on well-being and community-driven interventions,\nwhile developing more sophisticated and culturally sensitive\nmeasures supported by qualitative surveys.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: The first author's\nwork was funded by the FSE (Fondo Sociale Europeo) \"Dote\nRicercatore,\" a program of the Lombardy Region.\nReferences\nAbu-Rmeileh, N.
