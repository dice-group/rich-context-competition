    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Current US surveillance data provide estimates of diabetes using laboratory tests at\nthe national level as well as self-reported data at the state level. Self-reported diabetes prevalence\nmay be biased because respondents may not be aware of their risk status. Our objective was to\nestimate the prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes by state.\nMethods: We estimated undiagnosed diabetes prevalence as a function of a set of health system\nand sociodemographic variables using a logistic regression in the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (2003-2006). We applied this relationship to identical variables from the\nBehavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2003-2007) to estimate state-level prevalence of\nundiagnosed diabetes by age group and sex. We assumed that those who report being diagnosed\nwith diabetes in both surveys are truly diabetic.\nResults: The prevalence of diabetes in the U.S. was 13.7% among men and 11.7% among women\n 30 years. Age-standardized diabetes prevalence was highest in Mississippi, West Virginia,\nfor women). Vermont, Minnesota, Montana, and Colorado had the lowest prevalence (11.0 to\n12.2% for men and 7.3 to 8.4% for women). Men in all states had higher diabetes prevalence than\nwomen. The absolute prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes, as a percent of total population, was\nhighest in New Mexico, Texas, Florida, and California (3.5 to 3.7 percentage points) and lowest in\nMontana, Oklahoma, Oregon, Alaska, Vermont, Utah, Washington, and Hawaii (2.1 to 3 percentage\npoints). Among those with no established diabetes diagnosis, being obese, being Hispanic, not\nhaving insurance and being  60 years old were significantly associated with a higher risk of having\nundiagnosed diabetes.\nConclusion: Diabetes prevalence is highest in the Southern and Appalachian states and lowest in\nthe Midwest and the Northeast. Better diabetes diagnosis is needed in a number of states.\nThis article is available from: http://www.pophealthmetrics.com/content/7/1/16\n\u00a9 2009 Danaei et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBackground\nDiabetes Mellitus is the sixth leading cause of death in the\nUnited States (U.S.), accounting for approximately\n70,000 annual deaths. Age-standardized adult diabetes\ndeath rates across U.S. states ranged from approximately 2\nWest Virginia and the District of Columbia (D.C.) [1].\nThere may be two reasons for this large variation: First,\nthere may be variation in diabetes prevalence across states\ndue to differences in risk factors for diabetes. For example,\nthe prevalence of obesity in a number of Southern states\nis almost 60% higher than Colorado, where obesity is\nlowest [2]. Second, there may be differences across states\nin diagnosis and treatment of diabetes or of cardiovascu-\nlar risks among diabetics. Reliable information on diag-\nnosed and undiagnosed diabetes prevalence at the state\nlevel is important because states are important adminis-\ntrative units for funding and implementing programs that\ninfluence diagnosis and treatment.\nCurrently, the only source of information on diabetes\nprevalence at the state level is the Behavioral Risk Factor\nSurveillance System (BRFSS), a state-representative tele-\nphone survey. However, the BRFSS data are based on self-\nreports and do not provide estimates of undiagnosed dia-\nbetes. The National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES) uses laboratory measurements and\nprovides estimates of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabe-\ntes, but is representative only at the national level. In this\nstudy, we combined data from NHANES and BRFSS to\nestimate diabetes prevalence and diagnosis at the state\nlevel. Our results provide information for state diabetes\nprevention and control programs, and our methods can\nbe used for regular low-cost monitoring of diabetes at the\nstate level.\nMethods\nData Sources\nNHANES uses a complex multistage stratified clustered\nprobability design to measure health and nutrition char-\nacteristics of a nationally representative sample of the\ncivilian non-institutionalized population aged two\nmonths and older. NHANES includes an in-person inter-\nview and a subsequent physical examination and meas-\nurement component in a mobile examination clinic\n(MEC) or at home for those unable to visit the MEC. We\nresponse rates for the medical examination after the\nEach interviewed participant was randomly assigned to\neither a morning or afternoon/evening MEC session. Sub-\njects  20 years old assigned to the morning session were\nasked to fast for 8 to 24 hours, with the exception of those\non insulin or those who were excluded for other safety\nreasons. The NHANES MEC and fasting sample weights\naccount for exclusion, non-response, and inappropriate\nfasting time. Additional information on NHANES design\nand methods, including on diabetes measurement, is\navailable elsewhere [3,4] and online http://www.cdc.gov/\nnchs/nhanes.htm.\nThe BRFSS is an annual cross-sectional telephone health\nsurvey. Currently, the survey is conducted in all 50 states\nand the District of Columbia using random-digit dialing\nto obtain a state-representative sample of the civilian,\nnon-institutionalized population aged 18 and over. In\n2003, the response rate among eligible subjects who\nanswered the phone was 77%. Additional information on\nthe design is available elsewhere [5,6] and online http://\nwww.cdc.gov/brfss.\nWe included adults aged 30 and older in NHANES and\nBRFSS who had answered the self-reported diabetes ques-\ntion, which asked if they had ever been told by a health\nprofessional that they had diabetes. The response rate for\nthis question was more than 99.8% in both surveys. We\ndid not include younger participants because diabetes\nprevalence is relatively low in these ages.\nStatistical Analysis\nConsistent with previous analyses [4], we defined total\ndiabetes as either having answered yes to the diabetes\ndiagnosis question: \"Other than during pregnancy, have\nyou ever been told by a doctor or health professional that\nyou have diabetes or sugar diabetes?\" or having a fasting\nplasma glucose (FPG) level of  126 mg/dL. We used FPG\nbecause it is used to define diabetes by the American Dia-\nbetes Association [7].\nWe used data from NHANES, which is representative at\nthe national but not at the state level, to characterize the\nrelationship between undiagnosed diabetes status\n(defined as FPG  126 mg/dL) and a set of health system,\nsociodemographic, and risk factor variables listed in Table\n1 using a logistic regression. These variables were selected\na priori based on their potential association with diabetes\nprevalence. We excluded education from the primary list\nof predictors as including it did not improve the fit of the\nmodel. In addition, 50.2% of observations in NHANES\nwere missing either smoking or insurance status or both.\nWe used a missing indicator to include these observations\nin the regression model. The regression incorporated\nappropriate sampling weights.\nWe estimated the individual-level probability of having\npants who had answered \"yes\" to the diabetes diagnosis\nquestion were, by definition, assigned a probability of 1.0\nfor having diabetes. Second, the probability of having\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTable 1: Description of the outcome and explanatory variables from NHANES and BRFSS and the corresponding odds ratios (OR) and\nVariable Reason for inclusion in analysis Possible values OR (95% CI)\nOutcome (dependent) variables for the regression\nUndiagnosed diabetes\n(available in NHANES; predicted in\nOutcome variable to estimate undiagnosed\ndiabetes\n- -\nExplanatory (independent) variables\nSex Predictor of diabetes, possibly because of\ndifferences in lifestyle and health care\ndeterminants\nRace * Predictor of diabetes and health care access Non-Hispanic white 1.0 -\nDoctor visit (have you seen a doctor in\nthe past year?) \nInsurance status\n(do you currently have health insurance?)\nBMI (kg/m2)  Determinant of diabetes and indicator for\nselected lifestyle factors such as diet and\nphysical activity\nSmoking (do you now smoke cigarettes?)

Estimates of diabetes prevalence and\ndiabetes diagnosis by age, sex, and state were obtained\nfrom the BRFSS using appropriate sample weights. The\ndifference between total diabetes and self-reported diabe-\ntes is undiagnosed diabetes. In separate analyses, we used\nlinear regressions to model the relationship between FPG\nas a continuous variable and self-reported diabetes diag-\nnosis, medication use, and the health system, sociodemo-\ngraphic, and risk factor variables in Table 1 (results for\ncontinuous FPG analysis are available from authors by\nrequest). We used STATA version 10 for all analyses (Stata-\nCorp Texas). We present the results in two age groups: 30-\nResults\nThe national prevalence of diabetes among US adults  30\nwere undiagnosed, a percentage that has changed little\nRegression results\nAmong those who answered \"no\" to having been diag-\nnosed with diabetes, being male and being older was asso-\nciated with a higher probability of having diabetes (Table\n1). The effect of age on diabetes risk was largest in those\nold, consistent with the available evidence on the age\nassociation of blood glucose [8]. Overweight and obesity\nwere associated with higher prevalence of undiagnosed\ndiabetes, with obese participants (body mass index, BMI\nodds of having undiagnosed diabetes compared to nor-\nmal weight. After controlling for all other factors, Hispan-\nundiagnosed diabetes compared to whites, and the unin-\npared to insured subjects.\nWe evaluated the performance of the prediction model\nusing both internal and external validations. For internal\nvalidation, we applied the regression coefficients to\nused in estimating the regression model) to predict diabe-\ntes prevalence. The differences between the predicted and\nactual diabetes prevalence for different age, sex, and race\ngroups were on average 0.5 percentage points and at most\n8.4 percentage points. The Pearson correlation coefficient\nfor the observed and predicted diabetes prevalence for dif-\nferent age, sex, and race groups was 0.98. For external val-\nidation, we applied the coefficients of regressions\nbles in pooled data from two previous rounds of NHANES\nferences for individual age, sex, and race groups were at\nthe extreme slightly worse than those in the internal vali-\ndation; specifically, the 60- to 69-year-old males from\n\"other race\" had a 20 percentage point discrepancy. This\nmay, however, be because the composition of this race\nchanged between the two surveys. The Pearson correlation\ncoefficient for the observed and predicted diabetes preva-\nlence for different age, sex, and race groups was 0.93. On\naverage, the predicted prevalence was 0.1 percentage\npoints higher than the actual prevalence (versus 0.5 lower\npercentage points in the internal validation).\nNational-level prevalence of diabetes and undiagnosed\ndiabetes\nThe predicted national prevalence of diabetes in 2003-\ngroup whose predicted and measured prevalences were\nsignificantly different was the uninsured, who had an\nState-level prevalence of diabetes and undiagnosed\ndiabetes\nthe Midwest and the Northeast, including Vermont, Min-\nnesota, Montana, and Colorado, with age-standardized\nprevalence was highest in the primarily Southern and\nAppalachian states, including Mississippi, West Virginia,\nLouisiana, Texas, South Carolina, Alabama, and Georgia,\nwhere age-standardized diabetes prevalence was 15.8% to\n103% higher for women than the states with lowest prev-\nalence.

We included the parameter and stochastic uncertainty of the modeling using a multiple imputation approach in which we imputed the\nprevalence of diabetes for individuals who did not report having diabetes 10 times, drawing from a multivariate Normal distribution of the\ncoefficients and drawing randomly from the posterior binomial distribution of revalence. We estimated the standard error of the national\nprevalence of diabetes using these 10 imputed values for each sex. The standard error was 0.8% for men and 0.4% for women, which is almost 10\ntimes larger than the standard error estimated using sampling uncertainty only.\nTable 2: Estimated prevalence (sampling standard error)* of total diabetes by state, age, sex, race and insurance status (Figures show\nactual prevalence; age-standardized figures available from authors).

One-third\nof diabetes cases were undiagnosed in participants who\ndid not have insurance compared to one-fourth among\ninsured Americans.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the\ntotal prevalence of diabetes and the proportion of diabe-\ntes that is undiagnosed at the state level. The Southern and\nAppalachian states had the highest diabetes prevalence,\nwith Mississippi faring the worst. The Northern plains, the\nNortheast and the Midwest had the lowest prevalence.\nPrevalence of undiagnosed diabetes also varied across\nstates, with Southern states and California having the\nhighest prevalence.

These findings are important for the development\nand implementation of adequate state programs to pre-\nvent, diagnose, and control diabetes.\nThis analysis has a number of limitations: First, although\nour regression models included important sociodemo-\ngraphic, lifestyle, and health system determinants of dia-\nbetes risk and diagnosis, there are other factors that affect\ndiabetes, such as diet and quality of care [9,10]. For\ninstance, we were unable to include family history of dia-\nbetes, physical activity, alcohol use and specific dietary\nrisk factors of diabetes [11-14] in the model because\nBRFSS does not include a sufficiently detailed dietary\nquestionnaire or any questions on family history of diabe-\ntes and because the questions used to measure alcohol use\nOklahoma 2%\nPennsylvania 2%\nSouth Dakota 2%\n* The standard error of prevalence reported here reflects the sampling variability in the predicted diabetes prevalence but does not incorporate\nuncertainty in the prediction model (parameter uncertainty and stochastic uncertainty) and thus is an underestimate for the true standard error of\nprevalence. See footnote to Table 2 for an example of how the inclusion of these sources would affect standard errors.\nTable 3: Estimated prevalence (sampling standard error)* of undiagnosed diabetes by state, age, sex, race, and insurance (Figures\nshow actual prevalence; age-standardized figures available from authors). (Continued)\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nand physical activity are different from those used in\nNHANES. The effects of some such factors may be cap-\ntured by the variables in our model (e.g., self-reported dia-\nbetes, BMI, smoking, insurance status, visit to a doctor,\netc.). If the unexplained effects vary systematically across\nstates, the model may underestimate cross-state variation\nin diabetes prevalence, making our results conservative.\nSecond, we conducted our analysis using FPG because of\nits availability for the most recent rounds of NHANES and\nbecause it is used by the American Diabetes Association to\ndefine diabetes. Other definitions of diabetes, e.g., based\non glucose tolerance test, may have led to slightly different\nestimates. Third, BRFSS response rate varies across states.\nThis may affect the state comparisons if the determinants\nof non-response are associated with diabetes prevalence.\nThe single best way to reduce uncertainty in our analysis\nwould be the addition of a validation component to\nBRFSS, which includes measured blood glucose for a ran-\ndom sample of interviewees. Finally, because 50.2% of\nobservations in NHANES were missing either smoking or\ninsurance status, we used a missing indicator in our\nregression models to include these observations. Drop-\nping these observations would decrease the precision of\nour regression coefficients but would not affect the predic-\ntions of diabetes prevalence by states materially.\nDespite uncertainties, our results currently provide the\nonly estimates of total diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes\nin U.S. states, and should provide motivation, guidance,\nand benchmarks for designing, implementing, and evalu-\nating diabetes prevention and control programs at the\nstate level. Further, our methods allow states to combine\nthe relatively low-cost BRFSS telephone survey with\nNHANES to regularly monitor the prevalence of diabetes\nand progress in diabetes diagnosis.\nIncreasing the coverage of lifestyle, e.g., physical activity\nand pharmacological interventions for diabetes, should\nbe a priority in states with high diabetes prevalence. Some\nstates also need to improve diagnosis, especially among\nmen, because early diagnosis and intensive glycemic con-\ntrol reduces the future incidence of microvascular compli-\ncations [15,16]. Further, diabetes diagnosis will facilitate\ninterventions that lower blood pressure and cholesterol,\nand hence the risk of cardiovascular disease, among dia-\nbetics [17,18]. The states with the highest estimated diabe-\ntes prevalence in our analysis also have the highest levels\nof blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk [19,20].\nThis geographical distribution of cardiovascular risks and\ndiabetes points to the need for lifestyle and health care\ninterventions that reduce blood pressure and other cardi-\novascular risks in high-diabetes states.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nGD, CJM and ME designed the study.
