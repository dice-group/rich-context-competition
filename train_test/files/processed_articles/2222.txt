Teo1*, HwaJung Choi2, Marcia Valenstein3\n1 Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America, 2 Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor,\nMichigan, United States of America, 3 Department of Veterans Affairs, HSR&D Center for Clinical Management Research Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America\n Introduction\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is an illness of major clinical\nand public health significance. Lifetime prevalence of MDD in the\nUnited States is estimated at 16%, and the vast majority of\nepisodes are characterized by at least moderate clinical severity\nand role impairment. [1] Also common in those with medical\nillnesses, depression increases risk for and worsens outcomes\namong those with coronary artery disease, [2] stroke, [3] and\ncancer. [4] Worldwide, major depressive disorder is a leading\nsource of morbidity, and by 2030 it is projected to be the number\none contributor to the global burden of disease. [5].\nThe association between mental health and social relationships\nhas long been of interest. On a conceptual level, social\nrelationships may influence mental health outcomes through\nmultiple mechanisms including influence on health-related\nbehaviors, engagement in social activities, transfer and exchange\nof social support, and access to material resources. [6,7] On an\nempirical level, social isolation and negative social interactions are\nassociated with depression [8,9] and suicide. [10] Prospective\ncommunity studies have found perceived marital dissatisfaction\nand negative marital quality at baseline are risk factors for an\nincident major depressive episode. [11,12] Meta-analyses have\nshown that interventions addressing social relationships, including\ncouples therapy and peer support may be effective in reducing\nStill, the state of research on social relationships and mental\nhealth leaves a number of crucial issues unresolved. Most studies\nuse cross-sectional data, [8,9,15] leaving investigators unable to\ndetermine the direction of causality between social relationships\nand mental health. Of the available longitudinal studies, many\nhave focused on clinical populations [16] or been geographically\nrestricted with modest sample sizes, [17] limiting generalization to\nthe broader community. Finally, differing dimensions of social\nrelationships are often not examined within the same study,\nincluding questions regarding with whom, how often, and in what\nway do people interact with others. This prevents direct\ncomparisons of the relative importance of specific features of\nsocial relationships on depression.\nThis study assessed evidence for association of social relation-\nships with depression in a prospective cohort. Our primary goal\nwas to assess in a community population the role of both\nqualitative and quantitative aspects of social relationships in the\nsubsequent development of major depression. We hypothesized\nthat both poor quality of social relationships and social isolation\nwould increase the risk of major depression ten years later. We also\nconducted secondary analyses to explore: 1) the relative impact of\nnegative versus positive aspects of social relationships (strain versus\nsupport); 2) the relative impact of the quality of relationships with\nspouse, family, and friends; and 3) interactions between relation-\nship quality and social isolation on the subsequent development of\nmajor depression.\nMethods\nSample\nParticipants were from the Midlife in the United States\n(MIDUS) survey, a national longitudinal cohort study focused on\nthe role of behavioral, psychological, and social factors in\nunderstanding physical and mental health. The sample was\ncomprised of individuals selected by random digit dialing\n(RDD), with several geographical oversamples, siblings of individ-\nuals from the RDD sample, and a national RDD sample of twins.\nAll eligible participants were non-institutionalized, English-speak-\ning adults age 25\u00ad75 at baseline. The baseline assessment, Wave 1,\ninterview, administered by trained lay interviewers, and a written\nquestionnaire.\nFor our analyses, we included individuals who participated in\nboth waves. After adjusting for mortality, the overall response rate\ncontinued study participation into Wave 2 tended to endorse more\npositive health-related variables, [18] a common phenomenon in\nlongitudinal surveys. We further restricted our sample to those\nwho had a valid response to the primary outcome variable (past-\nyear major depressive episode at Wave 2) and were not missing all\nitems that composed the primary predictor variable of relationship\nquality (n = 4,642). Primary analyses were conducted with those\nparticipants who had a spouse or partner at baseline (n = 3,500)\nwith additional analyses additionally including the unpartnered\n(n = 4,642). Sample sizes for particular analyses vary due to\ndifferences in the number of evaluable responses. Detailed\ninformation on the MIDUS sample and study methods are\navailable online (http://www.midus.wisc.edu/) and in print. [19].\nMeasures\nPast year major depression. Past-year major depressive\nepisode, assessed at ten-year follow-up, was the primary outcome\nvariable in this study. The diagnosis of major depressive episode\nwas based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview\nShort Form (CIDI-SF). For major depressive episodes, the CIDI-\nSF has a sensitivity of 89.6%, specificity of 93.9%, and overall\nagreement of 93.2% when compared to the full CIDI in a sample\nsimilar to this study. [20] Epidemiological studies employing the\nfull CIDI have yielded prevalence rates of major depression similar\nto those in studies using clinical interviews such as the Structured\nClinical Interview for DSM-III-R. [21] Numerous trials have\ndocumented good test-retest reliability and clinical validity of the\nQuality of social relationships. In our primary analyses,\nwe assessed the overall baseline quality of social relationships,\nincluding items measuring social support and strain. In secondary\nanalyses, we used measures of the negative aspects of relationships\n(social strain) and the positive aspects of relationships (social\nsupport) separately. In additional secondary analyses, we assessed\noverall relationship quality for three different types of social\nrelationships: spouse or partner, family members (excluding\nspouse/partner), and friends.\nPositive, or supportive, aspects of social relations were based on\na four-item scale about participants' spouse or partner (Cronbach's\na = .86), family (Cronbach's a = .83), and friends (Cronbach's\na = .88). [9,24] Scale items were: ``How much does your spouse or\npartner really care about you?''; ``How much does he or she\nunderstand the way you feel about things?''; ``How much can you\nrely on him or her for help if you have a serious problem?''; and\n``How much can you open up to him or her if you need to talk\nabout your worries?'' ``To measure the combined effects of these\nthree types of social relationships\u00adspouse/partner, family, and\nfriends\u00adwe constructed a composite scale of all items on social\nsupport (Cronbach's a = .84). Four response options were avail-\nable: 1 = ''a lot,'' 2 = ''some'' 3 = ''a little,'' and 4 = ''not at all.''\nThe scale score was the mean of individual items. The score range\nwas from one to four, with a higher score indicating less social\nsupport.\nNegative, or straining, aspects to social relations also consisted\nof four items about participants' spouse or partner (Cronbach's\na = .80), family (Cronbach's a = .78), and friends (Cronbach's\na = .79). [9,24] Scale items were: ``How often does your spouse or\npartner make too many demands on you?''; ``How often does he or\nshe criticize you?''; ``How often does he or she let you down when\nyou are counting on him or her?''; and ``How often does he or she\nget on your nerves?'' To measure the combined effects of\nrelationships with spouse/partner, family, and friends, we\nconstructed a composite scale of all items on social strain\n(Cronbach's a = .83). Response options and score range paralleled\nthat of the positive interactions scale. Responses were reverse-\ncoded, with a higher score indicating more social strain.\nTo measure overall relationship quality for the three different\ntypes of social relationships (spouse or partner, family members,\nand friends), we constructed composite, eight-item scales that\ncombined the positive and negative dimensions of social relation-\nships. Reliability was again good (Cronbach's a for spouse or\npartner = .87; friend = .77; family = .82). Lastly, we constructed a\ncomposite scale of overall quality for all three types of social\nrelationships\u00adspouse/partner, family, and friends (Cronbach's\na = .87). On these four-point scales, a higher score indicates lower\noverall quality. Scale scores were the mean of all items.\nSocial isolation. Social isolation was assessed by determining\nat baseline whether someone lived with a marital or romantic\npartner and the frequency of their contact with non-cohabitating\nfamily, friends, and neighbors. Participants were asked, ``Are you\ncurrently living with someone in a steady, marriage-like relation-\nship?'' They were also asked: 1) ``How often are you in contact\nwith any members of your family, that is, any of your brothers,\nsisters, parents, or children who do not live with you, including\nvisits, phone calls, letters, or electronic mail messages?''; 2) ``How\noften are you in contact with any of your friends \u00ad including visits,\nphone calls, letters, or electronic mail messages?''; and 3) ``How\noften do you have a real conversation or get together socially with\nany of your neighbors?'' For the first two items, eight response\noptions were available, ranging from 1 = ``several times a day'' to\n8 = ``never or hardly ever.'' For the item about contact with\nneighbors, the six response options varied from 1 = ``almost every\nday'' to 6 = ``never or hardly ever.'' In all cases, a higher score\nindicates more social isolation.\nCovariates. Covariates were selected for inclusion based on\ntheir known association with depression or social relationships and\nall variables were assessed at baseline. Similar to recent studies,\n[17] we included sex, age, ethnicity, education level, household\nSocial Relationships and Depression\nincome, physical and mental health, major depressive disorder,\ngeneralized anxiety disorder, and alcohol misuse. Physical health\nwas assessed using the single item, ``In general, would you say your\nphysical health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?''\nMental and emotional health was assessed similarly. Major\ndepressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder diagnoses\nwere based on the CIDI-SF scales, which determined past 12-\nmonth prevalence. Alcohol misuse was assessed with a five-item\nalcohol screening test (e.g., ``Did you ever, during the past 12\nmonths, have such a strong desire or urge to use alcohol that you\ncould not resist it or could not think of anything else?''), and if they\nanswered ``yes'' to one or more items they were classified as having\nalcohol misuse. Variables were dichotomized when distribution of\nthe data precluded analysis as continuous variables. All covariates\nwere analyzed at baseline.\nData Analyses\nIn our primary analyses, multivariable logistic regression was\nused to examine the association between the overall quality of\nsocial relationships, social isolation, and subsequent depression. A\ndichotomous measure of major depression was used because of\nsample skewness and the potential increase in clinical relevance\n(diagnosis rather than symptoms). Results are presented as odds\nratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The regression\nmodels were adjusted for the effects of the covariates described\nabove. We provide predicted probabilities of depression given\ndiffering levels of quality in relationships by evaluating at\nindividual level risk values. Because our sample included a\nsubpopulation of siblings and twins, we obtained robust standard\nerrors by clustering error structure at the household level. We also\nconducted analyses with only the population-based (i.e., RDD)\nsample and found effect sizes similar to those reported herein.\nHowever, due to substantially reduced power, many of the results\ndid not reach statistical significance in this reduced sample.\nSpecification checks suggested the logit function was a linear\ncombination of the predictors. Regression diagnostics indicated\ngood discrimination and calibration of our model. We conducted\nan a priori power estimate, assuming a total sample size of 4,900\nand 450 participants with social isolation or poor quality social\nrelationships. With these parameters, we estimated a power of\nover 99% power to detect a doubling (from 8% to 16%).\nSample data were weighted using Current Population Survey\n(CPS) data derived from the Census Bureau to ensure that the\nsample was nationally representative in terms of age and gender\ndistributions in 2005. As no sampling was conducted for Wave 2,\nonly population-based adjustments were used. Details on the\nconstruction of the post-stratification weights are available in the\nsupporting information (Text S1 and Tables S1, S2, S3). All\nanalyses reported herein are based on the weighted data. In\naddition to reflecting true household clusters, standardized errors\nalso reflect variance in weights. [25].\nWe also conducted four sensitivity analyses. First, to account for\nmissing responses, we employed multiple imputation using\nswitching regression, an iterative multivariable regression tech-\nnique. We used internal imputation for missing responses in\nindividual items in the scales of social relationship quality (,3%\nmissing) and covariates (,5% missing). There were no notable\ndifferences between results from the imputed and non-imputed\ndatasets, and here we report results from the latter. Second, for\nanalyses on participants with a spouse or partner, we added an\nadditional covariate for change in partnership status to the\nmultivariable models, which produced very similar effect sizes and\nno significant differences. Third, we repeated all analyses using\nunweighted data, with no significant differences in results detected.\nFourth, we conducted analyses on the subsample of participants\nwithout major depression at baseline and report relevant results\nbelow.\nSignificance level for all tests was set at p,.05 (95% CI\nexcluding one) and tests were two-tailed. Data were analyzed using\nStata version 12 (Stata Corp.).\nResults\nCharacteristic of Participants\nTable 1 provides baseline characteristics of the 4,642 study\nparticipants. Women comprised just slightly more than half of the\nsample and 92% were white. Five hundred fifty-nine participants\n(12.3%) had a major depressive episode at baseline. The mean\nscore on the overall quality of social relationships was 1.82.\nParticipants more commonly reported strain rather than lack of\nsupport in their social relationships. The majority did not have\nmarkers of social isolation.\nRelationship between Quality of Social Relationships and\nDepression\nWe first examined whether the overall of quality of social\nrelationships at baseline predicted occurrence of major depressive\nepisodes at follow-up. Across all types of social relationships, poor\nquality in core relationships was associated with a significantly\nhigher risk of depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.65; 95%\nCI, 1.86\u00ad3.76), even after accounting for the predictive power of\nbaseline major depression and other covariates.

Again we found that overall poor quality in relationships\nwas a significant predictor of depression. Additionally, sensitivity\nanalysis among participants who did not have a major depressive\nepisode at baseline (n = 4,083) also showed significant results.\nRelationship between Quality of Different Types of Social\nRelationships and Depression\nThe type of social relationship also affected depression risk\n(Table 3). In this secondary analysis, poor overall quality of\nrelationship with one's spouse/partner (AOR, 1.47; 95% CI,\nsignificantly and independently increased risk of depression. In\ncontrast, the overall quality of relationships with friends did not\nindependently predict subsequent depression (AOR, 1.21; 95%\nSimilarly, in sensitivity analysis where participants without a\nspouse or partner were included, poor quality of relationships with\nfamily members but not friends significantly increased risk of\ndepression.

In models for overall quality of relationships with family,\nfriends, and spouse/partner, there were no interactions found.\nDiscussion\nImportance of Considering of Social Relationships in\nMental Health\nThis observational study of a large nationally representative\ncommunity cohort demonstrates that the quality of social\nrelationships\u00adeven after accounting for baseline depression and\nother important potential confounders\u00adpredicts future depression.\nResults were similar when analyses were restricted to those\nparticipants without major depression at baseline, which suggests\nthat the predictive power of social relationship quality is not\nexplained by depression's influence on self-report of one's social\nrelationships. Remarkably, this effect appears to be very durable,\npredicting development of clinically significant depression ten\nyears later. This long-term effect extends earlier studies that have\ndemonstrated that negative social interactions predict negative\naffect three months later [26] and that perceived social support\npredicts depression outcome up to three years later. [16].\nBoth the negative and positive qualities of the relationship were\nindependently predictive of depression, with the effect of negative\naspects being modestly stronger. Prior cross-sectional studies have\npointed out the detrimental effect of negative social interactions,\n[9,27] though the bulk of the literature focuses on the positive\naspects of social support. We reinforce here the importance of\nsocial strain\u00adnot just support\u00adwhen considering mental health. In\naddition, our data suggest the value of evaluating overall quality of\nsocial relationships as a risk factor for depression.\nWhen assessing the quality of social relationships, it also appears\nworthwhile to consider which type of social relationship has strain\nor lacks support. Specifically, our data suggests that having\nproblems especially with one's spouse and less so with other family\nmembers\u00adbut not friends\u00adeach exert an independent effect on\ndepression risk. This extends and corroborates earlier cross-\nsectional research that showed not getting along with one's spouse\nwas related to more psychiatric disorders than not getting along\nwith relatives or friends. [15] Health care providers should\nremember that patients' relationships with their loved ones likely\nplay a central role in their medical care, [28] whereas weaker\nsocial ties tend to impact other aspects of life. [29].\nWe did not find support for our hypothesis, that frequency of\nsocial contact would impact the likelihood of future depression.\nMoreover, our analyses on interactions indicated that even if\nparticipants had little contact with their family or friends, this\nsocial isolation did not moderate the effect of quality of social\nrelationships on subsequent depression risk. Though objective\nsocial isolation\u00adsocial network characteristics such as few or\ninfrequently contacted social relationships\u00adhas been associated\nwith mental illness, the association appears to be weak. [8] Our\nresults thus support the argument that subjective components of\nsocial relationships are more critical to one's health than objective\ncharacteristics of one's social network. This is a robust finding that\nhas been observed not only for mental health outcomes [17,30]\nbut also for cardiovascular disease, [31], disability, [32] and\nWe estimate that one in seven adults who have social\nrelationships in the bottom decile of relationship quality will\ndevelop major depression years later, whereas, just one in fifteen of\nthose with the highest quality of social relationships will develop\ndepression, suggesting substantial benefits at the population-level if\npeople can learn how to improve the quality of their social\nrelationships. This sort of effect size is clinically meaningful and\ncan be illustrated by comparing it to other research on risk factors\nfor major health outcomes. Specifically, data from the famous\nFramingham study indicate the following: to achieve a similar\nreduction in ten-year risk of a myocardial infarction from 15% to\n7%, a 60-year-old non-smoker with a systolic blood pressure of\n120 mm not on pharmacotherapy for hypertension would have to\nhave his total cholesterol decrease from 300 mg/dL to 200 mg/dL\nand HDL cholesterol increase from 40 mg/dL to 60 mg/dL. [34].\nImplications for Interventions\nSocial relationships may be a critical target for public health\nofficials and clinicians alike: the magnitude of effect is sizable, the\nprevalence of poor quality social relationships is high, and the\npopulation-level morbidity of major depressive disorder is among\nthe highest of any condition. Asking patients about their subjective\nperceptions of their social relationships should be a priority.\nIncluding questions in the clinical encounter about, for instance,\nhow much others care and understand the patient, as well as how\nmuch others' criticize and let the patient down should be\nconsidered evidence-based, much like inquiring about past\ndepressive episodes.\nFurthermore, treatments that focus on ameliorating one's social\nrelationships may be a particularly helpful for depression. One\ntreatment strategy is via individual psychotherapy that modifies\npatients' emotional or cognitive perceptions about their interper-\nsonal relationships. Two time-limited, evidence-based psychother-\napies, cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy, are\neffective treatments for depression and can be used to directly\ntarget problems with social relationships. Indeed, a large meta-\nanalysis found cognitive therapy approaches to be the most\nefficacious for lonely subjects. [35] Interpersonal psychotherapy\u00ad\nwhich can focus on areas such as conflicts in one's social\nrelationships\u00adis efficacious as both acute and maintenance\ntreatment for depression, [36] though dissemination remains\nlow. [37] Public health officials and policy makers should consider\nsupporting broader investigation and uptake of these treatments.\nGiven our results showing the strength of spouse/partner\nrelationship quality as a predictor for depression, the broader\nuse of couples therapy might also be considered. Couples therapy\u00ad\nin which both partners attend sessions led by a therapist with the\naim of promoting supportive aspects of their relationship and\nreducing patterns of negative interaction\u00adhas been shown to be\neffective for mild to moderate depression. [14] It may also be\nworthwhile investigating its potential as a preventive treatment for\nmajor depression.\nLimitations\nSeveral limitations of this study deserve mention. First,\nconfounding by unmeasured variables is a threat in any\nobservational study, perhaps even more so in studies like this that\nexamines social determinants of health. However, we have utilized\nadvanced statistical methods to address potential confounding and\noffer conservative estimates of confidence intervals. Third, though\nthis study was longitudinal it only contains two timepoints for\nanalysis. As a consequence, it is possible that in the long interim\ninterval participants' quality of social relationships varied.\nHowever, prior research has indicated that negative social\ninteractions, at least in older adults, is quite stable over years.\n[38] Fourth, these analyses lack the granularity in data to\ndistinguish between incident and recurrent major depression,\nthough given the age of participants and the known epidemiology\nof depression, it is likely that many cases were recurrent.\nTherefore, we are unable to report whether social relationship\nSocial Relationships and Depression\nquality is more or less of a predictor for first-episode or recurrent\ndepression. Finally, several measures relied on participants' recall\nof over the prior year, a lengthy period of time.\nConclusion\nIn summary, this study suggests that social relationships may be\nan important area to target among adults at risk for clinical\ndepression. The mantra that quality is more important than\nquantity appears true in the effect of social relationships on\ndepression. The magnitude of effect of social relationship quality\non risk for depression is comparable with the effect of well-\nestablished biological risk factors for cardiovascular disease.\nInterventions for individuals with low quality of social relation-\nships, and therefore high risk for future major depressive episodes,\nmerit more investigation and dissemination.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Cross-Classification of Unweighted MIDUS Wave 2\nSample.\nTable S2 Cross-Classification of CPS Sample in 2005.\nTable S3 Post-stratification Weights Using Age Strata and\nGender.\nText S1 Procedure for Creating Post-Stratification\nWeights for the Study Sample.
