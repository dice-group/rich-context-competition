Currently, approxi-\nmately two-thirds of American adults are overweight or\nobese (3). Obesity increases the risks of a number of dis-\neases and health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease,\nhypertension, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer\ndeaths in the U.S. are related to the condition (6).

Previous studies have shown that the asso-\nciation between SES and obesity may vary by populations,\nby gender, and by age (8\u00ad10). In general, in industrialized\ncountries, low-SES groups are more likely to be obese than\ntheir high-SES counterparts, whereas in developing coun-\nThe costs of publication of this article were defrayed, in part, by the payment of page\ncharges.

However, to our knowledge, few studies\nhave systematically examined whether the relationship be-\ntween obesity and SES has changed over time; in other\nwords, whether the disparity in obesity across SES groups\nhas changed. If the relationship has changed, are there\ndifferences across sociodemographic (e.g., gender and eth-\nnic) groups? The present study attempts to answer these\nquestions.\nResearch on the secular trend in the disparity of obesity\nacross different SES groups is of special importance for\nseveral reasons. First, it can help increase our understanding\nof the underlying causes of the rising obesity epidemic in\nthe U.S. Second, it can help predict future trends in obesity\nprevalence across SES groups. Finally, such research find-\nings can guide the development of effective programs and\npolicies for the prevention and management of obesity in\ndifferent SES groups. It can help set priorities for future\nresearch and interventions, and for government policy to\nreduce obesity. In the present study, using successive na-\ntional representative survey data that were collected over\nthe past 4 decades in the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Surveys (NHANES), we examined the secular\nchanges in the relationship between obesity and SES in the\nU.S. We also examined whether the changes in the associ-\nations varied across gender and ethnic groups.\nResearch Methods and Procedures\nData\nThe NHANES include a series of cross-sectional surveys\nthat have provided nationally representative information on\nthe nutrition and health status of the U.S. civilian popula-\ntion. The National Center for Health Statistics conducted\ncontinuous survey, and the data are now available for the\nrounds of NHANES used a stratified, multistage probability\ncluster sampling design. Detailed descriptions of the sample\ndesign, interviewing procedures, and physical examinations\nconducted have been published elsewhere (17\u00ad20).\nIn each survey, standardized protocols were used for all\ninterviews and examinations. Data on weight and height\nwere collected for each individual through direct physical\nexamination in a mobile examination center. In NHANES I\nand II, race-ethnic group was classified as white, black, and\n\"other\" based on observation. In NHANES III, subjects\nwere classified as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,\nMexican American, and other ethnic groups, based on self-\nsubjects were classified into non-Hispanic white, non-His-\npanic black, Mexican American, other race (including mul-\ntiracial), and other Hispanic.\nMeasures\nDefinitions of Overweight and Obesity. BMI [weight\n(kilograms)/height (meters squared)] was calculated for\neach individual based on measured weight and height. Ac-\ncording to the World Health Organization's recommenda-\ntion, individuals with a BMI 30 were considered obese\n(5). Pregnant women were excluded from our analysis.\nSES. Most commonly used variables to measure SES\nwere education, income, and occupational status. Each SES\nmeasure had its own strengths and limitations when the\nrelationship between SES and health outcomes was studied.\nMany researchers suggested that education is the most sta-\nble and robust indicator of SES (21\u00ad23).\nWe selected education level of the subjects as the primary\nmeasure of SES because: education is the only available\nlikely to be affected by a subject's body weight status,\nwhereas people's income might be affected; and education\nis more comparable across time than income or occupation.\nIn addition, education had little missing data, compared\nwith income. We coded the education level as follows: low\neducation (less than high school, meaning ninth grade or\nless), medium education (high school, meaning 10th to 12th\ngrades), and high education (college or higher) to indicate\nlow, medium, and high SES. Note that our findings regard-\ning the trends in the association between SES and obesity\nwere similar if income was used as the indicator of SES in\nanalysis using the NHANES I to III data (data not shown).\nConfounding Variables. Previous studies suggest that\nobesity is associated with demographic characteristics such\nas gender, age, and race/ethnicity (24,25). Meanwhile, SES\nmay also be correlated with gender, age, and ethnicity.\nThus, these variables are potential confounders, and it is\nnecessary to control for them when studying the relationship\nbetween SES and obesity. When studying the difference\nacross ethnic groups, because of small sample sizes and\nlimited information about subjects with Hispanic origin\navailable in NHANES I and II, we recoded race/ethnicity\ninto three groups (white, black, and other) to make the\nanalysis comparable across surveys. In this report, we fo-\ncused on the comparison between white and black.\nBecause there were two gender groups, three ethnic\ngroups, and three SES levels, 18 gender-race-education\ngroups were created in our analysis. If we would have\nstratified the subjects further into four age groups, the\nsample size for each gender-race-age-SES group would\nhave been too small. Therefore, we reported prevalence\nAssociation between Obesity and Education, Zhang and Wang\nonly in gender-ethnic-SES groups. However, we did control\nfor age in our regression analysis.\nStatistical Analysis\nOur analysis of the NHANES I, II, and III data was\nconducted using Stata (version 7; Stata Press, College Sta-\nusing SUDAAN. All analyses took into account the com-\nplex survey design and unequal probabilities of sample\nselection in NHANES. First, we examined the absolute and\nrelative differences in the prevalence of overweight and\nobesity among the low-, medium-, and high-SES groups in\ndifferent gender-ethnic groups over time. Next, we con-\nducted logistic regression to examine the association be-\ntween obesity and SES (two dummy variables to code low\nand high SES were used; the medium-SES group was used\nas the reference) and overweight and SES. Odds ratios\n(ORs) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were esti-\nmated. The results for overweight were similar to those for\nobesity; thus, they were not presented. Finally, using mul-\ntiple linear regression analysis, we examined the relation-\nship between BMI and SES. All regression analyses were\nconducted separately for men and women, and age was\ncontrolled. Race/ethnicity was also controlled when analy-\nsis was conducted for combined ethnic groups in men and\nwomen. Statistical tests were conducted at the p  0.05\nsignificance level.\nResults\nSocial Demographic Characteristics and Anthropometric\nMeasures\nThe social-demographic characteristics and anthropomet-\nric measures of adults across NHANES are presented in\nbecame slightly older; mean age increased 3.4 years. There\nwas also a remarkable change in the population composi-\ntion: The proportion of white people continued to decrease,\nand the proportion of \"other race\" adults, including His-\npanic, increased significantly after NHANES II. Proportions\nof individuals in different education categories also changed\nacross surveys. More people had a high educational level\n(college or higher), and fewer people had a medium educa-\ntional level (high school). In NHANES I and II, 50% of\nthe individuals were in the medium educational level, but by\n50% were in the higher education level. With more mi-\nnority individuals moving into the high-education group,\nthe association between SES and obesity in the whole\npopulation was likely to be weakened because minority\ngroups tended to have a higher prevalence of obesity than\nwhites. Neither men's nor women's height changed over the\nperiod, but their weight increased considerably: Men's\nmean weight increased by 7.5 kg (or, in relative terms,\n9.5%), whereas women's mean weight increased by 10.6 kg\nTable 1.

Consistently, men's and wom-\nen's mean BMI increased: approximately by 2 points among\nmen and 4 points among women.\nSecular Trends in the Disparity of Obesity across SES\nGroups: The Absolute and Relative Differences in the\nPrevalence across SES Groups\nTo examine the secular trends in the disparity of obesity\nacross SES groups, we calculated the absolute and relative\ndifference in prevalence among the three SES groups in\neach survey period for each sex-ethnic group (Tables 2 and\n3). Similar to what other researchers have reported previ-\nously, our analysis showed that the prevalence of obesity\nincreased significantly over the last 4 decades in all gender-\nethnic-SES groups. Among the three SES groups, the high-\neducation group had the highest rate of increase in the\nprevalence of obesity. For example, the prevalence of obe-\nsity in black men with high education increased by a strik-\n2000, whereas the prevalence of obesity in black men with\nmedium education increased only 40% during the same\nperiod. In white women, the prevalence of obesity in the\nhigh-education group quadrupled, whereas the rate in the\nlow-education group had only a 66% increase. The same\npattern can be found also in white men and black women.\nPrevalence of obesity in low-educated black women was\nquite stable across time, but the rate among the more highly\neducated almost tripled.\nClearly, the difference in the prevalence between the low-\nand high-SES groups became smaller over time, more dra-\nmatically so among women than men. For example, among\nwomen, the absolute difference in obesity prevalence be-\ntween the low- and high-SES groups dropped from 18 to 8\npercentage points, or, in relative terms, 71% to 21%.\nAmong men, it dropped from 5 to 3 percentage points, or,\nWe also observed remarkable ethnic differences in the\ntrends. In white women, the absolute difference in preva-\nlence of obesity between those with low education and those\nwith medium education was reduced 44%, whereas the\nrelative difference was reduced 62%, between NHANES I\nsignificant difference existed among SES groups, except for\nthe difference between the low- and high-SES groups in\nwhite women. In black women, the magnitude of the rela-\ntive and absolute differences in the prevalence declined\ncompared with the three previous waves of NHANES, but\nthe direction of the association was changed. In NHANES I\nto III, African-American women with lower SES had a\nmedium-SES group had the highest prevalence.\nThe trends in disparity among men were mixed. In white\nmen, the absolute difference between the prevalence of\nobesity in two SES groups was stable across surveys,\nwhereas the relative difference decreased. In black men, the\ndisparity in obesity between the medium- and the high-SES\ngroups tended to decline across time, whereas the disparity\nbetween the low-to-medium and the low-to-high SES\ngroups had no clear pattern.\nSecular Trends in the Association between Obesity and\nSES\nOur logistic regression analysis indicated that the associ-\nation between SES and obesity was attenuated over time,\nespecially among women. ORs tended to converge to 1\nacross surveys in most gender-race groups (see Figure 1 and\nTable 4, in which medium SES was the reference group). In\nwhite women, ORs for obesity in those with low education\nto 2000, whereas ORs for obesity in those with high edu-\nIt is worth noting the reducing statistical significance of\nORs across time, especially in women. For example, in\nwhite women, ORs for obesity in high- or low-education\ngroups were all statistically significantly different from 1 in\nNHANES I and II but became insignificant in NHANES III\nThere were remarkable differences between men and\nwomen and across ethnic groups. In black women, the OR\nfor the low-SES group was reducing to 1 across surveys.\nHowever, no clear reducing trend was observed for the\nhigh-SES group. In men, the reference group had a higher\nrisk of obesity than the other two SES groups. There was a\nrising trend for ORs in low- and high-education groups\nacross surveys. In white men, the OR in those with low\nNHANES I and II, the ORs in white men with high educa-\ntion were significantly less than 1. But in NHANES III and\nsignificantly different from 1. A similar pattern was ob-\nserved in black men, but with less statistical power.\nSecular Trends in the Relationship between BMI and\nSES\nIn general, the findings of our multiple linear regressions\n(Table 5) were consistent with those of the logistic regres-\nsion analysis. We observed mixed patterns in the association\nfor men but a clearly weakened one for women. For women,\nthe overall association between SES and BMI changed from\nsignificant in the 1970s (a reverse association) to insignif-\nmedium-SES women, low-SES women's BMI was 1.5\npoints higher (p  0.05), whereas that of the high-SES\ngroup was 1.2 points lower (p  0.05). The figures were\nAssociation between Obesity and Education, Zhang and Wang\nthe differences was significant. In fact, the change had\nalready started in NHANES III for the low-SES group when\nthe difference between the low- and medium-SES groups\nbecame insignificant (p  0.05). The patterns were similar\nfor white and black women.\nTable 2.

In women, a clear declining trend was ob-\nserved, which indicates that SES had become a less\npowerful predictor of BMI. In men, the partial R2 de-\ncreased in the first three waves of NHANES, but picked\nblack men's partial R2.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study that has system-\natically examined the trends in the association between SES\nusing national representative data with measured anthropo-\nmetric measures. Overall, our findings show a dispropor-\ntionate increase in the prevalence of obesity in the high-SES\ngroup and a weakened association between SES and obesity\nin most gender and ethnic groups. There are considerable\nvariations in the changes in the associations across gender\nand ethnic groups. The trend is clearer for women than for\nmen. These findings provide a new perspective to under-\nstand the causes of the dramatic increase in obesity in the\nU.S. Although a positive energy balance (i.e., energy in-\ntake  energy expenditure) over a prolonged period must be\nthe fundamental biological basis for the development of\nobesity, it is crucial to understand how individual factors\nand social-environmental factors may lead to an energy\nimbalance. SES is an important individual characteristic\nthat influences an individual's access to resources, knowl-\nedge of nutrition and health, food choices, and physical\nactivity at work and in leisure time (26). Extensive literature\nhas documented the higher rates of obesity and overweight\namong low-SES groups (3,4,9), but we have noticed a\nsignificant \"catch-up\" in the prevalence of obesity in the\nhigh-SES group.\nThe timing of the changes in the relationship between\nSES and obesity coincided with the increase in the preva-\nlence of obesity. Before NHANES III, the relationship\nbetween SES and obesity was relatively stable, which was\nconsistent with findings from previous studies (27,28).\nHowever, distinct changes in the relationship between SES\nand obesity were observed between NHANES II and III.\nDuring this period, the prevalence of obesity increased\ndramatically.\nThe declining disparity of obesity across SES groups and\na weakened relationship between SES and BMI indicate that\nindividual characteristics may not be the dominant factor\nthat has contributed to the dramatic increase in obesity over\nthe past 2 decades. The trends we observed suggest that\nsome social-environmental factors might have a more pro-\nfound effect in influencing an individual's body weight\nstatus than an individual's characteristics such as SES. We\nsuspect that some societal environmental changes affecting\nall SES groups have contributed to a gradual positive energy\nbalance and weight gain among American adults; thus, the\nassociation between obesity and an individual's SES is\nweakened. However, different gender and ethnic groups\nmay have different susceptibilities and may have adopted\nFigure 1: Secular trends in the association between SES and obesity among U.S. adults 1971 to 2000: ORs.\nAssociation between Obesity and Education, Zhang and Wang\ndifferent behaviors to face these changes, which helps ex-\nplain the differences in the trends we observed among\ndifferent population groups.\nEnvironmental changes/factors could increase people's\nenergy intake and decrease people's energy expenditure.\nFirst, with regard to energy intake, the revolution in the\nmass preparation of food could be a key factor that leads to\nsignificant increase in food consumption in the United\nStates (29). The average time of food consumption has been\nlowered so that people have more food options and can eat\nmore frequently. Because \"people who have had the most\nability to take advantage of the technical changes should\nhave had the biggest gains in weight,\" women could be most\nsignificantly affected by the revolution in food preparation.\nThis may help explain why the disparity of obesity across\nSES was more weakened in women than in men because the\nrevolution reduces the differences between rich and poor\nwomen in food preparation and consumption.\nSecond, it is argued that the U.S. government's agricul-\nture policy, which subsidizes farmers to produce grains and\nmeats and provide them to the domestic market at low\nprices, has contributed to people's excessive intake of food\nand to the current obesity epidemic (30). Another factor that\nrecently has drawn much attention because it affects almost\neveryone is the increase in portion sizes of food served in\nrestaurants and of processed food packages. For example,\nthe portion sizes of fast foods such as French fries and\nburgers and sugar-sweetened soft drinks all have increased\ndramatically. Take soda as an example: Coca-Cola moved\nfrom the svelte 8-ounce bottle of soda in the 1970s to the\n20-ounce bottle of today. Because the prices of raw mate-\nrials are so low, many food industry companies are able to\nprovide larger portion sizes without increasing the price per\nunit of food; in fact, this helps them increase their profit\n(30). However, the increase in portion sizes has promoted\noverconsumption of energy (31,32). Moreover, ubiquitous\nadvertisements for energy-dense foods, low prices of un-\nhealthy foods, large portion sizes, and food preparation\npractices at home can affect all SES groups and, thus,\npromote weight gain (33).\nThe other side of the energy equation is energy expendi-\nture. Over the past 2 to 3 decades, many social, economic,\nTable 4.

Technological development and the expansion of\nglobal trade have facilitated more sedentary lifestyles in all\nSES groups in the U.S. (35). One good example that dem-\nonstrates the many impacts of new technologies on people's\ndaily lives is the development of personal computers and the\nbooming of the information technology industry. The infor-\nmation technology advances influence people's occupations\nand their daily activities by fostering more sedentary activ-\nities and reducing job- and leisure-related energy expendi-\nture. Meanwhile, the transfer of labor-intensive industries to\ndeveloping countries no doubt has reduced the number of\nworkers who are employed in these high-energy-expending\nTable 5.

Finally, people are less\nlikely to engage in outdoor activities due to concerns about\ncrime or due to the lack of sidewalks and recreation facil-\nities in the communities, and they spend more time on\nsedentary activities such as watching TV and playing video\ngames.\nAll of these changes may be playing a more dominant\nrole in influencing people's weight status than individual-\nlevel characteristics such as SES (although broad social-\nenvironmental factors related to obesity still need to work\nthrough an individual's behaviors). Thus, the association\nbetween SES and obesity has been diminishing in an \"obe-\nsogenic\" environment.\nOur findings suggest that population-based and environ-\nmental approaches should be developed for the prevention\nand management of obesity, whereas individually based\napproaches, as suggested by many previous studies, proba-\nbly will not be very effective. Not only low-SES groups but\nalso higher SES groups should be targeted in these efforts\n(36). Despite previous calls for action and large amounts of\nresources spent by individuals to reduce weight (37), the\nprevalence of obesity and overweight has increased in all\nSES groups. The disproportionate increase in the prevalence\nof obesity and overweight in high-SES groups indicates that\neven if people are aware of the importance of maintaining a\nhealthy body weight, having a healthy diet, and engaging in\nregular physical activity, they are still gaining weight. It is\nsocietal changes that have contributed to the increase in\nobesity. Without developing effective strategies to modify\nthe current obesogenic environment in the U.S., it is likely\nthat the obesity epidemic will continue, which implies that\nthere will be a greater burden of obesity-associated chronic\ndisease such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes to\ncontend with in the future.\n"
