Pre-\nviously, increased inflammation and coagulation have been\nrelated to functional decline and earlier mortality indepen-\ndent of associations with demographics and specific dis-\neases (1\u00ad10). Because endothelial dysfunction has been\nlinked to a number of diseases associated with aging, type 2\nAlzheimer's and vascular dementia (14), metastatic malig-\nnancies (15), and severe hip and knee osteoarthritis (16), we\nsought to determine if a marker of endothelial dysfunction,\nas indicated in this case by vascular cell adhesion molecule\n(VCAM), might impact functional decline and mortality\nindependent of inflammation and coagulation.\nVCAM is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on\nthe surface of activated endothelial cells and vascular\nsmooth muscle cells (17). VCAM recruits leukocytes to\nareas of inflammation by promoting adhesion of circulating\ninflammatory cells to endothelium (reviewed in 18). Ex-\npression of VCAM is typically promoted by inflammatory\nmolecules, including tumor-necrosis factor alpha and inter-\nleukin-1 beta (reviewed in 17,18). When endothelial cells\nare activated by inflammatory cytokines, soluble VCAM\n(s-VCAM) is generated via proteolytic cleavage at or near\nthe site where the protein inserts into the endothelial cell\nmembrane (17,19). The proportion of the membrane-bound\nform released as s-VCAM from activated cells is estimated\nto be as much as 20% of total cellular VCAM (19). s-\nVCAM can induce T-cell chemotaxis, contributing to sy-\nRelations of a Marker of Endothelial Activation\n(s-VCAM) to Function and Mortality in Community-\nDwelling Older Adults\nKim M.

We wished to determine if a marker of endothelial dysfunction/activation soluble vascular cell\nadhesion molecule (s-VCAM)--was related to functional status and mortality in community-dwelling older adults\nindependent of the known effects of markers of inflammation and coagulation.\nMethods. Data came from the third and fourth in-person waves of the Duke Established Populations for Epidemio-\nlogic Studies of the Elderly. Participants (aged  71 years) had participated in a blood draw (N = 1,551) from which\nconcentrations of s-VCAM, interleukin-6, and d-dimer were determined. Information was gathered in-person on\ndemographics, health behaviors, chronic health conditions, and functional status (Katz, Rosow\u00adBreslau, Nagi). Death\nwas determined through the National Death Index. Multivariable regression analysis was used to examine the adjusted\nassociation of s-VCAM with functional status; Cox proportional hazards models ascertained hazard of mortality.\nResults. Controlled analyses indicated that cross-sectionally, but not longitudinally (4 years later), greater s-VCAM\nconcentrations were associated with poorer function as measured by the Katz and Rosow\u00adBreslau scales (p < .05 for\nboth), independent of interleukin-6 and d-dimer. In controlled analyses, s-VCAM (p = .002), d-dimer (p = .008), and\ninterleukin-6 (p = .01) were independently related to 4-year mortality; 1 SD increase in log concentration conferred 1.2-,\n1.1-, and 1.2-fold increases in mortality, respectively. The greatest hazard of mortality was observed within the first year\nafter measurement. s-VCAM concentrations were not predictive of 15-year mortality.\nConclusions. Independent of inflammation and coagulation markers, endothelial dysfunction serves as a marker of,\nand potentially contributes causally to, poor function and death in community-dwelling older adults.\nKey Words: S-VCAM--d-dimer--IL-6.\nDecision Editor: Luigi Ferrucci, MD, PhD\nnovial inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (20) and\nrecruit eosinophils to lungs in animal models of asthma\n(21). Given these pathologic roles of s-VCAM and the as-\nsociation of elevated s-VCAM with abundant endothelial\nactivation, detection of elevated concentrations of s-VCAM\nis commonly equated with endothelial dysfunction (17,18).\nOur group has previously demonstrated relations for both\ninflammation, as indicated by interleukin-6 (IL-6), and\ncoagulation, as indicated by d-dimer, with functional decline\nand mortality (3,4,9,22). Given these relations, we wished\nto determine the associations of s-VCAM with function and\nmortality, independent of the impacts of IL-6 and d-dimer.\nWe hypothesized that concentrations of s-VCAM, a marker\nof endothelial dysfunction and activation, would be related\nto functional status and mortality independent of disease\nstate, demographics, and markers of inflammation and\ncoagulation in a sample of community-dwelling older adults.\nMethods\nParticipant Population\nThe National Institute on Aging\u00adfunded Duke Estab-\nlished Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly\nhas been described previously (3,23).\nMeasures\nDemographic information (self-reported age, sex, race,\nand education) was collected at enrollment (1986). At the\ncurrent study, height and weight were measured, and body\nmass index (kg/m2) was calculated. Other information\ngathered at the same time included the following.\nBlood collection subsample.--Blood was collected in\nethylenediaminetetraacetic acid\u00adcontaining tubes, centri-\nfuged, and plasma was stored at -70\u00b0C in 0.5-mL aliquots.\nhad a successful blood sample obtained (3). Of the 1,727,\ns-VCAM could be measured for 1,551. This sample of\n1,551 constitutes the analysis sample for the present study.\nFunctional status.--Assessments of functional status\nscales. Katz reports on five activities of daily living: bath-\ning, dressing, transferring from bed to chair, toileting, and\neating. The abbreviated Rosow\u00adBreslau assesses partici-\npants' abilities to do heavy house work, walk up a flight of\nstairs, and walk a half mile. The Nagi scale assesses fine and\ngross motor activity, including abilities to extend the arms\nabove the shoulders, manipulate small objects, stoop or\nkneel, carry a 10-pound item, and push a large object. Items\nwere scored dichotomously, with higher scores indicating\npoorer function. Function was reassessed during an in-person\nCognitive status and depression.--Cognitive status was\nassessed in terms of errors on the Short Portable Mental\nStatus Questionnaire (27). Depression was assessed with a\nmodified version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies--\nDepression scale (28), in which the original 4-point scale\nfor each item was dichotomized (condition present versus\nabsent). A score of 9 on this abbreviated measure has been\nfound to be equivalent to a score of 16 on the original (29).\nHigher scores indicated more cognitive impairment or\ndepression.\nSelf-rated health.--Self-rated health was assessed with\nthe question \"Overall, how would you rate your health.\"\nFour responses were possible: \"excellent,\" \"good,\" \"fair,\"\nand \"poor.\"\nChronic conditions.--The presence of five chronic\nmedical problems (cancer, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, and\nhypertension) was assessed with the question \"Did a doctor\never tell you that you had . . .\"\nSleep.--Sleep problems were assessed by asking partici-\npants how often they had difficulty falling asleep. Three\nresponses were possible: \"rarely or never,\" \"sometimes,\"\nand \"most of the time or always.\"\nSmoking and alcohol.--Smoking status was determined\nby asking whether the participant currently smoked ciga-\nrettes. Alcohol use was assessed with a question on whether\nindividuals consumed two or more drinks of beer, wine, or\nliquor each week.\nBiomarker Analyses\nConcentrations of IL-6, d-dimer, and s-VCAM were\nmeasured by enzyme-linked immunoassays (Quantikine,\nR&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; Dimertest Tripwell EIA\nkit, American Diagnostical, Greenwich, CT; and R&D Sys-\ntems, Minneapolis, MN, respectively). Analyses of IL-6 and\nd-dimer concentrations and characteristics were reported\npreviously (3,4), whereas subsequent analyses of s-VCAM\nwere possible for 1,551 individuals with sufficient plasma\nremaining after the initial biomarker analyses were com-\npleted (30). Computed from raw s-VCAM data, the intraas-\nsay coefficient of variation, calculated as the mean\ncoefficient of variation for 57 samples run in duplicate, was\n3.91%. The interassay coefficient of variations for low,\nmedium, and high concentrations were 7.8%, 3.1%, and\n0.14%, respectively; these were determined from the low,\nmedium, and high concentration standards across 20 plates.\nMortality Assessments\nMortality was assessed via a combination of family state-\nments and National Death Index searches (31).\nStatistical Analyses\nHandling missing data.--When data were missing, we\nimputed the mode for categorical variables, the median for\nordinal variables, and the mean for continuous variables.\nThe maximum number of missing values for a single variable\nwas 52 for baseline function assessed with the Nagi scale.\nAnalysis.--Biomarker variables (s-VCAM, IL-6, and\nd-dimer) were log-transformed to approximate a normal\ndistribution prior to modeling. Standardized z scores ([raw\ndata \u00ad population mean]/standard deviation) were created\nfor log-transformed biomarker concentrations to allow\ncomparison among the three biomarker parameter esti-\nmates. The impact on physical function outcomes (Katz,\nRosow\u00adBreslau, and Nagi scores) was assessed with Pearson\ncorrelations and, to account for covariates as described\nsubsequently, with general linear modeling by ordinary\nleast squares (regression) procedures. Cox-proportional\nhazards modeling was used for determining predictors of\nassumptions of this model, both the proportionality and the\nlinearity assumptions were tested for the variables of inter-\nest. Analyses were controlled for age, sex, race, education,\nbody mass index, cognitive status, depression, self-rated\nhealth, cancer, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, hypertension,\nsleeping difficulties, smoking, and alcohol use. To evaluate\nfor potential s-VCAM by demographic or health factor in-\nteractions and to control for type I error, chunks of interac-\ntions were tested using multivariable tests including VCAM\nby x, where x was the vector of all covariates entered into\nthe model for each outcome. If the overall test was positive,\nthen, each two-way interaction was tested individually (32).\nResults\nCross-Sectional and Longitudinal (4-Year) Association\nof Biomarkers With Functional Status\nTable 1 shows characteristics of the 1,551 participants for\nwhom s-VCAM data were available. Cross-sectionally,\ngreater s-VCAM concentrations (log s-VCAM) were related\nto poorer function regardless of measure (Table 2: rKatz = .14,\n.0001). After controlling for previously identified demo-\ngraphic and health predictors of current function (age, sex,\nrace, education, body mass index, cognitive status, depres-\nsion, self-rated health, cancer, heart attack, stroke, diabetes,\nhypertension, sleeping difficulties, smoking, and alcohol\nuse), greater s-VCAM concentrations (log s-VCAM) were\nindependently related to poorer function as measured by the\nnot the Nagi (p = .07). Further, when controlling for IL-6\nand d-dimer, s-VCAM remained an independent predictor\nof cross-sectional function as measured by the Katz and\nRosow\u00adBreslau scales (p < .02 for both; Table 2). Although\ns-VCAM was significantly correlated with IL-6 (r = .13,\nlevels that generally raise concerns about collinearity-\ninduced problems with model estimation. For Nagi- and\nRosow-Breslau\u00adassessed function, there were no signifi-\ncant s-VCAM interactions for the individual demographic\n(age, race, and gender) or health factors; for Katz-assessed\nfunction, the only significant s-VCAM interaction was for\nLongitudinally, in controlled analyses with or without\nd-dimer and IL-6, s-VCAM was not related to functional\nstatus 4 years later, as assessed by Katz, Rosow\u00adBreslau,\nor Nagi scales (p > .05 for all). However, 4 years after the\nticipants were deceased, implying a potential survivor bias\nconfounding the relation of s-VCAM with function.\nAssociation of Biomarkers With 4- and 15-Year Mortality\nIn fully controlled analyses, s-VCAM was independently\nrelated to 4-year mortality; this relationship was indepen-\ndent of previously identified demographic and health pre-\ndictors of mortality, including d-dimer and IL-6 (p < .05;\nTable 1.

Specifically, with the controlled vari-\nables held constant, over the 4-year period, the relative risk\nof death was 20% greater for those with a 1 SD increase in\nlog s-VCAM concentration (Figure 1; Table 3). For 4-year\nmortality, there were no significant s-VCAM interactions\nfor demographic or health factors.\nThe Cox proportional hazards assume proportionality,\nthat is, for the events being modeled, the hazards ratio is\nconstant over time (33). Here, the test of proportionality\nwas rejected (p = .007). Relative to the hazard for the\nmedian s-VCAM concentration, the hazard for greater\ns-VCAM concentrations was larger during Year 1 than in\nany subsequent year after measurement (Figure 2). At base-\nline, participants differing by a 1 SD increase in the log of\ns-VCAM concentration had 2.75 times the mortality risk.\nThis decreased to 1.7 times at 3 months, 1.5 times at\n4 years, there was no increased risk of mortality with asso-\nciated with greater s-VCAM concentrations (Figure 2).\nWhen 15-year mortality for those alive at 4 years was\nassessed, and with previously identified demographic and\nhealth predictors of mortality controlled, concentrations\nof s-VCAM, IL-6, and d-dimer were not related to mortality\nDiscussion\nHere, function, as measured with the Katz and Rosow\u00ad\nBreslau measures, was related to s-VCAM independent of\nthe relations for d-dimer and IL-6. Also, as previously dem-\nonstrated, d-dimer and IL-6 concentrations were related to\nfunction, independent of one another (9). Most remarkably,\nin a sample of community-dwelling adults 71 years of age\nand older, s-VCAM, d-dimer, and IL-6 concentrations were\nindependently related to mortality within 4 years, even after\nfunctional status and demographic and health status predic-\ntors of mortality had been taken into account.\nPrevious work has implicated s-VCAM as a marker of\nendothelial dysfunction associated with reduced survival.\ns-VCAM concentrations have been associated with disease-\nassociated mortality in metastatic gastric cancer (15) and\nsickle-cell disease (18) as well as cardiovascular mortality\nin coronary artery disease (34) and type 2 diabetes (35).\nAlthough markers of inflammation and coagulation have\nbeen associated previously with declining function and\nmortality (3\u00ad10,22), to our knowledge, this is the first inves-\ntigation linking s-VCAM concentrations to all-cause mor-\ntality in a general (not disease-specific) older population\nwhile controlling for the presence of multiple comorbidities\nthat might account for such an association.\nEndothelial dysfunction and decreases in endothelium-\ndependent dilation have been associated with aging, in the\nabsence of overt disease (36,37). Mechanisms have been\nattributed to decreases in nitric oxide availability, endothelial\nnitric oxide synthase expression, and tetrahydrobiopterin\nTable 2.

High s-VCAM was associated with increased mortality. Adjusted survival over time is shown for low and high baseline s-VCAM plasma concentrations\n(divided at the sample mean).

This observation highlights several noteworthy\nconclusions related to mortality predictions. First, it is\nimportant to verify the assumption of proportionality to\nensure that predictive capability of a marker at a later time\nis not due to effects of the marker at initial or early times.\nSecond, the change in the hazards over time suggests that\neither s-VCAM concentrations change dynamically or the\nrelation between s-VCAM concentrations and mortality is\nmutable. The concentrations of IL-6 and d-dimer are stable\nwithin an individual over at least 36 days (38), but these\nconcentrations, as well as those of s-VCAM, would be\nexpected to change with the changing health status of an\nindividual and therefore predict more proximal events.\nThird, it is important, but unknown whether additional pre-\ndictive capability might be derived from serial longitudinal\nmeasurements of s-VCAM, d-dimer, or IL-6 over time.\nLimitations\nBecause the participants are a subsample of individuals\nwho survived 6 years after initial enrollment and who had\nblood collected, there is a question whether they are repre-\nsentatives of the population of community-dwelling adults\n71 years and older. As previously reported, those without a\nblood draw were typically older and sicker suggesting a\npossible ceiling effect on the generalizability of the findings\n(4). Also, whereas the long-term follow-up is a strength of\nthe Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of\nthe Elderly cohort, the lack of shorter follow-up intervals\nfor a more granular assessment of the temporal course of\nfunction and the relatively small number of deaths within\nthe first year make it difficult to determine with precision\nthe time-dependent effect of s-VCAM concentrations on\nfunction and mortality. Further, causal inferences regarding\nthe impact of greater s-VCAM concentrations on function\nand mortality should be interpreted with caution. However,\nthe consistency of these findings with prior findings of\ngreater concentrations of s-VCAM in disease populations\nFurther, the strength of the associations between s-VCAM,\nfunction, and mortality, despite adjustment for multiple\npotential confounders, supports our hypothesis that endo-\nthelial dysfunction is related to functional decline and\ncontributes to death in older community-dwelling adults.\nNonetheless, additional investigations designed to prospec-\ntively follow s-VCAM concentrations, function, and mor-\ntality with greater granularity over time are necessary to\nrefine an understanding of the time interval over which\ns-VCAM can provide informative predictions of mortality\nand to determine if s-VCAM is causally related to (a bio-\nmarker) or merely a risk indicator of declining function and\nmortality.\nIn summary, in this cohort of community-dwelling older\nadults, greater blood concentrations of s-VCAM were re-\nlated to poorer function and to short-term (1 year) mortality\nindependent of comorbidities, inflammation, and coagulation\nmarkers. These findings imply that endothelial dysfunction\nis potentially a causal contributor to functional decline and\ndeath in elders.\nfunding\nand Education Foundation/Association of Subspecialty Professors Junior\nCareer Development Award in Geriatric Medicine funded via Atlantic\nPhilanthropies, American College of Rheumatology\u00adResearch and Educa-\ntion Foundation, John A.
