    "abstract": "Abstract\nTo explore the evolution of political-science research on race, Walton et al., have done a systematic review of more than\na century of publications appearing in the discipline's oldest and most prestigious journals: Political Science Quarterly and the\nAmerican Political Science Review, respectively. Walton and his colleagues uncover \"dual traditions\" of race scholarship: an\n\"African American Politics\" (AAP) paradigm emphasizing empowerment and Blacks' cultural distinctiveness, and a \"Race\nRelations Politics\" (RRP) approach that focuses on Blacks' socio-political status vis-\u00e0-vis Whites. Using computer-assisted\ntext analyses, we introduce a measure of racial dialogue that is informed by theory and has suitable empirical properties.\nWe replicate and extend Walton's research by adding a third periodical (the Journal of Politics) and demonstrating that,\nwhile race conversations are becoming more frequent over time, the dialogues taking place in mainstream journals\ntypically fit Walton's RRP (rather than AAP) tradition. Following our analyses, we offer guidelines for researchers seeking\nto apply our measure to alternative contexts.\n",

How scholars\nperceive African-American political life is investigated in\nChapter 4). Empowerment, in their formulation, is about\nsymbolism: when Blacks move politically--or when moves\nare made against them--what do race scholars observe (and,\nby extension, write about)? To answer these questions, the\nauthors examine over 100 years of publications in the disci-\npline's oldest and most prestigious journals, Political\nScience Quarterly (PSQ) and the American Political Science\nReview (APSR), respectively, and they uncover a scholarly\nviewpoint split into two camps: a side that treasures Black\nempowerment; and one that does not. They name the side\nthat treasures empowerment \"African American Politics\"\n(AAP); the other side of the coin is dubbed \"Race Relations\nPolitics\" (RRP). Walton et al. (1995) acknowledge that RRP\nauthors making Black\u00adWhite comparisons can do so on\nbehalf of racial subjugation or acquiescence--for instance,\nby holding Whites up as standard bearers, blaming Blacks\nfor delayed racial progress (or overemphasizing the impor-\ntance of White benevolence in ameliorating race problems),\nadvocating strategies for uplift that do not upset the status\nquo (and might even reinforce hierarchies), and so on.\nLikewise, Walton (1997) reminds readers that conversations\nabout empowerment are often linked to demands for Black\nliberation: publications in the AAP tradition can celebrate\nBlack life, point out the inadequacy of mainstream efforts\nfor racial progress, and champion strategies that advance the\nSay our name (and say it right)!

We generalize from the\nauthors' meta-study, making the process by which publica-\ntions are deemed AAP or RRP transparent for readers.\nSpecifically, we characterize political-science race research\nas a process by which authors \"say Blacks' name\" (making\nAfrican Americans prevalent in the document) and \"say\nBlacks' name right\" (by striking a favorable tone when dis-\ncussing this group of citizens). Combined, prevalence and\ntone help us to analyze the centrality of race to our disci-\npline's discourse. By building an instrument that gets at\nwhat Walton and his colleagues observe, we re-analyze\ntheir corpus of text in novel ways and apply our instrument\nto current articles in top-tier political science journals. This\nreplication-and-extension confirms not only that ours and\nWalton's operationalizations are empirically comparable\nbut also that the former can serve as a proxy for the\nlatter when reviewing the race literature. Consistent with\nMcClerking and Walton (2010), we discovered that race\nconversations are becoming more frequent over time, but\nthe dialogues taking place in mainstream journals typically\nfit Walton's RRP (rather than AAP) paradigm.\nSaying Blacks' name, and saying their\nname right\nWalton et al. lay a rich foundation for studying the evolution\nsummarize the logic of Walton's \"dual traditions\" argument:\nTwo major research veins have appeared in the study of\nAfrican American politics--a race-relations [politics]\nliterature, which focuses on African Americans' place in\nAmerican political culture vis-\u00e0-vis Whites, and an African-\nAmerican politics literature whose emphasis is more on\npolitical empowerment and cultural distinctiveness.\nWalton's concept of interest is the centrality of conversa-\ntions about race. Implied in this notion of centrality are\nconsiderations of both the prevalence and tone of racial dia-\nlogue: authors can prioritize or de-emphasize discussing\nrace, and those conversations can be uplifting or denigrat-\ning in connotation. Beyond merely mentioning Blacks by\nname, papers from the AAP tradition also say the right\nthings about African Americans by characterizing them in a\ncomplimentary manner. Centrality is perhaps too narrow to\nencompass the full scope of empowerment and its accom-\npanying challenges. But the concept is adequate for explor-\ning how/why some scholars mention African Americans\n\"vis-\u00e0-vis Whites\" in their writing while others promote the\nedification of Black life.\nTo assess prevalence, Walton et al. ask: when race is\nbeing discussed, are the political empowerment and/or cul-\ntural distinctiveness of African Americans a central feature\nof the publication? To capture more variation, prevalence is\nbest conceived of as a continuum. Therefore, we ask: when\nrace is being talked about in a publication, how central a\ntopic is political empowerment and/or cultural distinctive-\nness? Documents can refer exclusively toAfrican-American\nempowerment, they could never mention it, or they may fall\nanywhere between these extremes. We operationalize the\nprevalence component of our centrality index as the per-\ncentage of a document's in-group racial references\ncentrality tone\nin group\nin group out group\n= \u00d7\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevalence is typically measured by tallying documents'\nreferences to the in-group (\"Blacks\" and its various syno-\nnyms). The rationale is that larger tallies signal a stronger\ncommitment among authors to having race dialogues\n2007). The denominator, often implied by this approach, is\na paper's total word count. We propose a more relevant\ndenominator. The portion of the formula in square brackets\ncalculates the percentage of in-group mentions relative to\nother race words, defined here as allusions to both the in-\ngroup and out-group (derivations of the term \"Whites\").\nFor example, a paper with six in-group mentions out of 100\ntotal words is referring to Blacks 6% of the time. Assuming\nthe document contains 10 race words, it is more useful to\nknow that African Americans make up 60% of the racial\ndialogue and 40% of that conversation is about Whites.\nOne weakness of our prevalence measure is that it can\nyield false positives. Papers that mentionAfricanAmericans\nfrequently, while making few references to Whites, could\nbe discussing racial subjugation rather than uplift. The\nauthors' prevalence score could still classify the document\nas AAP, but a study about subjugation would be incompat-\nible with that scholarly tradition;3 therefore, we address this\nissue by considering a document's \"tone.\" Linguistic psy-\nchologists infer tone by comparing the frequency of posi-\ntive-affect and negative-affect words (Kahn et al., 2007;\nFollowing this precedent, we conceive of centrality as a\nfunction of prevalence, weighted by tone. The weighting\nvariable (located to the left of the square brackets) is struc-\ntured so that higher values suggest a tone that is more\nfavorable toward Blacks. Our centrality index, therefore,\ngenerates a \"weighted percentage\" in which papers focus-\ning primarily on Blacks (i.e. earning higher marks for prev-\nalence), while criticizing this racial group (receiving lower\nvalues for tone), get reduced centrality scores.\nAnalysis and discussion\nWalton replication\nWe collect data from JSTOR, an online archive of\nMcClerking and Block 3\nperiod analyzed by Walton et al., and we include the same\n54 publications the authors analyzed.4 Linguistic Inquiry\nand Word Count (LIWC), an automated text-mining pro-\ngram, scans documents for patterns in word use, punctua-\ntion, etc. (Pennebaker et al., 2015b). LIWC extracts tone\nmetrics by matching a document's text to a pre-compiled\n\"dictionary\" of terms representing positive and negative\nemotions (Pennebaker et al., 2015a).5 We re-scale tone to\nrange from zero to one, with higher values indicating an\nupbeat writing style, and texts with lower values feature\nwords connoting anxiety, sadness, or hostility. As noted\nearlier, prevalence gauges the in-group racial references in\na paper. LIWC's default dictionaries do not follow race\nwords, so we customized our own search routine (Appendix\n2). We multiply prevalence and tone to create our index of\ncentrality. The average centrality score is 28.43, with a\nSo a typical article among the 54 is less than one-third of\nthe way up the scale, and only 3.70% of those papers are\nabove 50% on this measure.\nWe adopt the authors' typology for distinguishing RRP\nand AAP papers, and readers should consult the reference\nlists in Walton et al. (1995: Appendix 1) for details. As\nFigure 1 shows, publications with centrality scores at the\nhigher end of the scale are likely to fall within the AAP\ntradition, and papers scoring at the lower end are often clas-\nsified as RRP. The horizontal axis divides scores into cut-\npoints: the lower threshold ranges from the minimum value\nto 15%, which is approximately one standard deviation\nthreshold contains values that are at least a standard devia-\nmiddle threshold captures scores between 15% and 42%.\nThe vertical axis records the proportion of publications\nmeeting these thresholds, while grey (black) bars distin-\nguish RRP (AAP) papers. If \"greater than 42%\" of the\nweighted race words refer to Blacks, then nearly 8 of 10\narticles fulfilling these criteria are AAP, and less than one-\nquarter of these documents are RRP. The inverse of this\npattern emerges when the cut-point is \"less than 15%:\"\npapers areAAP. It makes sense that articles with the highest\ncentrality scores meet the AAP standard, and that publica-\ntions with lower scores are overrepresented in the RRP cat-\negory. More importantly, while noting the limits of his\nconcedes that RRP and AAP papers can overlap. Our con-\ntinuous measure addresses this challenge by allowing for\nfiner gradations of centrality levels.\nScholarly attention paid to Blacks often reflects water-\nshed racial events. Given the timeframe covered here, there\nis no event more pertinent than the Modern Civil Rights\nMovement--hereafter referred to simply as the \"Civil\nRights Movement\"--which is viewed by many historians\nFollowing McClerking and Philpot (2008), we classify arti-\ncles published before 1956 as appearing before the height\nof the Civil Rights Movement, and the papers coming after-\nward should be shaped by these events. Like Walton (1997:\nTable 4.3), we trace racial discourse over time and across\njournals. Figure 2 contains separate scatterplots for each\njournal. The vertical axes record the average centrality\nlevel, while horizontal axes track the decades covered\nEach dot signifies a mean score for that particular decade,\nand its size is proportionate to the number of papers pub-\nlished during that period. Vertical dashed lines distinguish\narticles written before and after 1956. Mean-difference\ntests show that centrality levels in the APSR tend not to\nin the \"before\" (mean = 35.37%) and \"after\" (mean =\n27.60%) scores in the PSQ, but the difference is non-signif-\nchange much over time, papers about race become more\nnumerous after the Civil Rights Movement. As the size dis-\nparity in the dots before and after 1956 illustrate, the aver-\nage frequency of race papers per decade rises from 4.38 to\nExtension analyses\nAside from its distribution resembling that of Walton's, our\nindex exhibits construct validity (Cronbach and Meehl,\n1955) because centrality correlates in predictable ways\nwith other variables. We now assess centrality's robustness\nby: (a) expanding our viewpoint with articles from a third\nFigure 1. Across-tradition differences in the centrality scores\nof papers meeting various thresholds.\nNote: Bars represent the proportion of publications meeting centrality-\nscore thresholds, sorted by scholarly tradition.\n4 Research and Politics \ngeneral-interest journal; and (b) extending the time span\nPolitics (JOP) is a leading periodical whose editors and\nreviewers serve as research \"gatekeepers\" (Mohammadreza\net al., 2003). JOP is published by the Southern Political\nScienceAssociation. Given the widely-documented connec-\ntion between southern politics and racial identity6 adding\nJOP helps us to compare race discourse across mainstream\njournals of similar pedigree while also exploring such dia-\nlogue in an outlet that is known for showcasing identity-\nbased research (for a similar justification, see McClerking\nand Walton 2010). We supplemented JSTOR searches with\nscans of journals' online archives (Appendix 2) to locate\nfrom PSQ, and 101 from JOP. This new dataset merges the\n\"replication\" and \"extension\" stages of data collection and\ncontainsatotalsampleof205papers(TableA1inAppendix).\nCentrality levels in the extension dataset concentrate\nalong the bottom two-fifths of the scale. These scores have\na mean of 21.73%, and minimum and maximum scores of\nthe papers appearing in Walton's study, articles from our\nupdated collection tend to get lower scores (F = 10.14,\np < 0.01). But the variability in these scores are similar\nacross datasets: the standard deviations for the replication\nand an equality of variance test shows that these difference\nillustrate the distribution of centrality scores in the exten-\nsion dataset using kernel density plots. The horizontal\naxis contains placeholders for every possible score that\npublications can earn, while the vertical axis records how\nfrequently such scores appear in the data. Most publica-\ntions fall within the 13% to 35% range. Documents that get\ncentrality scores of 40% or higher are rare, as are papers\nscoring 10% or lower. The look of these distributions var-\nies; this is particularly true for the bimodal appearance of\nthe JOP scores. That said racial dialogues are empirically\nFigure 2. Centrality scores across decades, according to frequency, and by journal (part 1).\nNotes: Data points are mean centrality scores, sorted by decade, and weighted by the number of publications. We split the x-axis at 1956 to com-\npare patterns before and after the Civil Rights Movement.\nFigure 3.

Mean-difference tests confirm that\nthe centrality scores of papers appearing in the APSR\nble (F = 1.83, p > 0.10), and equality-of-variance tests show\nthat the standard deviations for these journals (12.30%,\nThe organization of information in Figure 4 is similar to\nthat of Figure 2, and the results across both sets of analyses are\nlargely consistent. Using bivariate correlation to explore\nchanges in average centrality levels by decade and between\njournals, we see that there is no statistically-significant time\ntrend in the centrality scores of papers from the APSR\n(r = 0.22, p > 0.05).Yet, centrality decreased significantly over\np = 0.06), which suggests that publications befitting Walton's\nRRP tradition are becoming increasingly more common in\nthese journals. Judging from the fluctuations in the sizes of the\ndots, we see that, regardless of journal, the number of articles\nfocusing on race has been increasing (APSR: r = 0.72, p <\ndialogues about race in these top-tier journals have become\nmore frequent (measured as the number of publications),\nwhile the focus on Blacks within these dialogues (operational-\nized by our centrality index) has declined in two of the three\njournals analyzed here.\nThe above findings are clearer when we explore central-\nity scores and publication frequencies across racial periods.\nMean difference tests of publication frequencies demon-\nstrate that, compared to the pre-Civil Rights Movement era,\nafter 1956. Although references to African Americans in the\ntext of articles appearing in the APSR (F = 2.8, p > 0.05) and\nJOP (F = 0.62, p > 0.05) did not change much after the Civil\nRights Movement, the centrality of racial dialogue in PSQ\narticles swelled significantly (F = 6.01, p < 0.05).Additional\nanalyses (not shown) comparing racial dialogues before and\nafter 2008 suggest an \"Obama effect.\" While it is not the\nreveals that articles written after Obama declared his presi-\ndential candidacy get higher centrality scores than those\npublished before 2008. Moreover, race papers are signifi-\ndence of an Obama-induced increase in the frequency of\nrace papers being published in the APSR (F = 0.09, p >\n0.10). We explore these and related patterns in Figure A1 of\nthe Appendix.8\nConclusion\nPolitical-science discourse draws its inspiration from real-\nworld events. Walton and his colleagues argue that the key\nvariable in the study of race politics research is the cen-\ntrality of empowering and/or culturally-distinctive dia-\nlogues within broader conversations about group relations.\nIn their comprehensive literature review, the authors\nexplore the distribution of racial centrality, as well as its\ncorrelates, in publications from two flagship journals.\nFollowing this lead, we introduce a theoretically-grounded\nmeasure of racial centrality. Our analyses capture some\naspects of what Walton et al. (1995) discuss, and,\ngiven the necessity of replication (King 1995), it is\nFigure 4. Centrality scores across decades, according to frequency, and by journal (part 2).\nNote: Data points are mean centrality scores, sorted by decade, and weighted by the number of publications.\n6 Research and Politics \nencouraging--but hardly surprising--that Walton's work\nnot only stands the test of time but also holds up to rigor-\nous re-examination. We hope that others will expand upon\nthe work Walton started, for our approach lends itself to\nan exploration of race dialogue in other political science\njournals, and, ultimately, to comparative analyses (not\nunlike Wilson, 1985) that chronicle discourse in other\nsocial-science and humanities disciplines. Although we\nfocus on African Americans here, we recognize that\ninsights from our work might inform analyses of the evo-\nlution of ethnic (e.g. Latino and Asian), gender, and sexu-\nality politics scholarship.\nEconomists distinguish between \"positive\" and \"nor-\nmative\" research, characterizing the former as data-driven\nand the latter as value-based. RRP papers are often con-\nsidered to be positive political science, while AAP publi-\ncations are billed as normative works. Admittedly, the\ndistinction between positive and normative is unclear,\nreflecting social hierarchies and academic norms (see\nCaplin and Schotte, 2008). Students of Black politics will\nagree that the work of eminent scholars like Mack Jones,\nRon Walters, Jewel Prestage, Nick Nelson and Linda Faye\nWilliams, are just as much about advancing knowledge as\nthey are about racial advocacy. By revisiting Walton's\nwork, we hope to enliven the ongoing conversation about\nrace in American politics, and we invite others to join in.\n"
