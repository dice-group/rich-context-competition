    "abstract": "Abstract. Characteristics of perception and cognition in our daily lives can be elucidated through\nstudying misdirection, a technique used by magicians to manipulate attention. Recent findings on the\neffects of social misdirection induced by joint attention have been disputed, and differences between\ndeceived (failed to detect the magic trick) and undeceived (detected the magic trick) groups remain\nunclear. To examine how social misdirection affects deceived and undeceived groups, we showed\nparticipants movie clips of the \"cups & balls,\" a classic magic trick, and measured participants' eye\npositions (i.e. where participants looked while viewing the clips) using an eye tracker. We found that the\nundeceived group looked less at the magician's face than the deceived group. These results indicate\nthat deceived individuals have difficulty trying not to allocate attention to the face. We conclude that\nsocial misdirection captures attention, influencing the emergence of deception.\n",

Only recently have psychologists focused on magicians' tech-\nniques, such as misdirection, to examine characteristics of attention, thought and memory (e.g. Kuhn\n& Martinez, 2011). Successful magic tricks require diverting audiences' attention toward a distracting\nact, keeping observers from being aware of how the trick works, while simultaneously performing\nwhat would be an otherwise obvious act (Lamont & Wiseman, 1999).\nIn investigations of misdirection used to manipulate visual attention, effects of social misdirec-\ntion, which is induced by joint attention using gaze direction as a social cue, have been hotly disputed.\nAlthough Kuhn and Land (2006) showed that social misdirection provided by gaze cues strength-\nens misdirection for successful magic tricks, Cui, Otero-Millan, Macknik, King, and Martinez-Conde\n(2011) and Rieiro, Martinez-Conde, and Macknik (2013) recently demonstrated that social misdirec-\ntion has less of an impact on misdirection. These results surprised magicians and psychologists alike,\nwho had often believed that social misdirection was essential for deploying successful tricks.\nHowever, studies indicating that social misdirection has less of an effect did not clearly identify\ndifferences between participants who could detect the magic trick (\"undeceived\" individuals) and\nthose who failed to detect the trick (\"deceived\" individuals). Due to social misdirection affecting\nvisual attention, we perceive an illusory event as an event even if it does not actually take place (Kuhn\n& Land, 2006). This suggests that misdirection as a social cue prevents participants from seeing an\nevent, which results in participants being deceived (Kuhn, Tatler, & Cole, 2009). If deceived and unde-\nceived participants can be influenced differently by social misdirection, whether or not an individual\nis deceived might reflect attention modulation by a social cue (e.g. gaze). Nevertheless, it remains\nunclear whether social misdirection enhances the effect of misdirection for a successful magic trick.\nThe present study examined how social misdirection might affect deceived and undeceived par-\nticipant groups by measuring participants' eye positions. While Kuhn and Tatler (2005) showed that\ngaze position had nothing to do with the detection of magic tricks when participants were misdirected,\nthe misdirected positions were identical (i.e. to the right) in their experiment. We were not only inter-\nested in social misdirection (i.e. the magician's gaze) but also the influence of different misdirected\npositions.\nThe effects of social misdirection on magic tricks:\nHow deceived and undeceived groups differ\nthe \"cups & balls\" trick watched 12, randomly presented movie clips, as shown in Figure 1 (see also\nsupplemental Videos 1 and 2). In each clip, a magician placed down and shuffled three cups on a table\nbefore a superimposed screen was presented; here, we asked participants under which of the three cups\na ball was placed. When participants responded by pressing a key to indicate the cup under which they\nthought the ball was hidden, the clip restarted to show the magician raising one of the cups to reveal\nthe ball underneath. In all clips, the magician looked toward misdirected positions in order to deceive\nthe participant as to the ball's location, helping to induce misdirection as to where participants should\nlook. There were six misdirected positions across two misdirection conditions: one was a misdirection\nwith-trick condition, and one was a without-trick condition. The magician performed the misdirection\nusing one ball in the without-trick condition but used one ball and an extra ball in the with-trick condi-\ntion in which the extra ball was hidden under one of the cups in advance. In our experiment, the magic\ntrick took place only in the with-trick condition. When the misdirection was performed, participants\nwere misdirected toward the extra ball from the wrong cup while the original ball (which participants\nwere to focus upon) was dropped under the table by tilting a cup. Thus, it was critical for participants\nto notice the tilted cup and the original ball dropping. After watching all 12 video clips, participants\nfilled out a questionnaire regarding whether they detected the magic trick, the video presented where\nparticipants knew the nature of the trick, and how the trick was performed. During the presentation of\neach clip, eye position was recorded with a Tobii X120 eye-tracker (120 Hz) at a viewing distance of\n60 cm with a chin-rest. We calculated the ratio of fixation time in each of three areas of interest (AOI)\nFigure 1. Summary of the experimental conditions. There were six misdirected positions where a magician raised\none of three cups. In positions 1, 2, and 3, the misdirection was performed where the cup originally was placed.\nIn positions 4, 5, and 6, the misdirection was performed where the cup was pushed ahead to the corner of the\ntable mat.\nFigure 2. (A) The ratio of fixation time among the undeceived and deceived groups in each area of interest (AOI).\n(B) AOIs overlaid onto a sample picture in misdirected positions 13. Blue, red and yellow rectangles represent\nface, misdirection and trick AOIs, respectively. In misdirected positions 46, AOIs for the misdirected positions\nwere moved further ahead and to the side of the table mat.\nThe effects of social misdirection on magic tricks 145\nduring the magician's misdirection over a 33.5 s period: one set of AOIs was for the misdirected and\nNine participants noticed the trick (\"undeceived\" group), and the other 11 did not (\"deceived\"\ngroup). A MANOVA [2 (misdirection)  6 (misdirected position)  2 (group)] for the three AOIs\nrevealed significant main effects of position (F\np\n(F\np\n5 .11) but no effect of misdirection nor an interaction (p  .05). There-\nfore, we separated analyses into a position  AOI ANOVA and group  AOI ANOVA. The former\nanalysis showed a significant interaction between position and AOI (F\np\n.38), suggesting that misdirection in positions 1, 2 and 3 were viewed significantly longer than 4, 5\nand 6 (p  .001), whereas there was no significant difference among positions 1, 2, 3 and 4, 5, 6. The\nlatter analysis showed a significant interaction between group and AOI (F\np\n.40), suggesting that the misdirectionAOI was viewed significantly longer than the trick and faceAOIs\n(p  .0001). Additionally, the undeceived group looked less at the magician's face than the deceived\ngroup (p  .0001), whereas there was no significant difference in fixation between groups in the mis-\ndirection and trick AOIs (Figures 2 and 3).\nResults showed that the deceived group looked at the magician's face more than the undeceived\ngroup, suggesting that participants in the former group were deceived by the magic trick. This might\nhave been due to social misdirection provided by the direction of the magician's face. A face presented\nin a social situation (e.g. video clip) and not in isolation often draws an observer's attention before the\nobserver directs his/her eye movement to the object of interest (e.g. what the face in the video is attend-\ning to; Castelhano, Wieth, & Henderson, 2007). When viewing a magic trick, the magician as a social\ncue (e.g. his/her gaze) spontaneously triggers an observer's attention in order to prevent the observer\nfrom seeing what the magician is manipulating (Kuhn et al., 2009). We conclude that deceived partici-\npants tend to look at the magician's face, thereby inducing social misdirection that implies something\nis present when nothing is there.\nDeception by social misdirection is natural because this technique utilises social attention. Social\nattention, especially gaze direction, has a strong effect on the process of aligning attention (Nuku &\nBekkering, 2008). However, the present study still included undeceived participants; thus, the type of\nsocial attention might matter. Whether and how social misdirection affects audiences during a magic\ntrick are important research controversies warranting further investigation.\n"
