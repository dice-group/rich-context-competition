The association of diabetes\nmellitus and hypertension with CKD across the adult lifespan is not well established.\nMethods: Data from NHANES 1999\u00ad2004 were used to determine the association of risk factors\n69, and 70 years). Stage 3 or 4 CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15\n\u00ad 1.51), respectively, for undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (p-trend = 0.369). The prevalence ratios of\nalbuminuria associated with hypertension and diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus were\nlower at older age (each p < 0.05).\nConclusion: Among US adults, diabetes mellitus and hypertension are associated with CKD and\nalbuminuria regardless of age. However, the associations were stronger at younger ages.\nBackground\nChronic kidney disease (CKD), defined by the presence of\nalbuminuria or reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR),\nis common, and increasing, among adults in the United\nStates and worldwide. [1-3] The incidence and prevalence\nof CKD increase markedly at older age.[2,4] For example,\nin the Framingham Heart Study, the risk of developing\nage.[4] Additionally, the prevalence of stage 1 or 2 and\nstage 3 or 4 CKD among US adults has been reported to\n\u00a9 2009 Islam et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nAlthough the incidence and prevalence of CKD increases\nwith age, several reports have suggested that the relative\nrisk of adverse outcomes including end-stage renal disease\n(ESRD) and mortality associated with CKD are attenuated\nat older age.[5,6] While these studies have provided\nimportant insight on outcomes among patients with\nestablished CKD, few data are available on the impor-\ntance and differential impact of risk factors for CKD across\nthe full adult lifespan. Similar to the age-related associa-\ntion of CKD with ESRD and mortality, the relationship\nbetween CKD and major risk factors may differ by age. To\ndetermine the association of risk factors for stage 3 or 4\nCKD and albuminuria by age grouping, we analyzed data\nfrom the National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-\ntension and diabetes mellitus are important risk factors\nfor CKD regardless of age but, similar to patterns observed\nfor outcomes among adults with CKD, these associations\nwould be stronger for younger adults.\nMethods\nsentative survey of the non-institutionalized civilian pop-\nulation of the United States.[7] Briefly, this study employs\na multi-stage stratified probability sample based on selec-\ntion of counties, blocks, households, and persons within\nhouseholds. Mexican-Americans, non-Hispanic blacks,\nand older adults were over-sampled in order to improve\nthe precision of estimates for these groups. NHANES\nical evaluation and blood sample collection in a mobile\nexamination center. Overall, 15,332 participants com-\npleted the medical evaluation and study interview. Partic-\nipants without serum creatinine measurements, estimated\nwere excluded from the analysis of stage 3 or 4 CKD,\nresulting in a sample size of 12,518 participants. For the\nanalysis of albuminuria, individuals missing urinary albu-\nmin or urinary creatinine measurements and pregnant or\nmenstruating women were excluded, resulting in a total\nsample size of 12,778 participants. Women and non-His-\npanic blacks were more likely than men and non-His-\npanic whites to be missing serum creatinine while older\nparticipants and non-Hispanic blacks were more likely\nthan younger individuals and non-Hispanic whites to be\nmissing urinary albumin or urinary creatinine data.\nOf relevance to the current analysis, variables collected\nduring the in-home interview were age, race-ethnicity,\ngender, cigarette smoking, a previous diagnosis of diabe-\ntes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction\nor stroke) and pharmacologic treatment for hypertension,\nhigh cholesterol, or diabetes mellitus. Self-report of a\nprior diagnosis of diabetes mellitus with current use of an\noral hypoglycemic agent or insulin was used to define\ndiagnosed diabetes mellitus. Body mass index (BMI) was\ncalculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in\nmeters squared; obesity was defined as BMI 30 kg/m2.\nThree blood pressure measurements were obtained using\na standard protocol and hypertension was defined as an\naverage systolic or diastolic blood pressure 140 mmHg\nor 90 mmHg, respectively, or current use of blood pres-\nsure lowering medication.[8]\nTotal cholesterol was measured with the Hitachi 704 Ana-\nlyzer; high cholesterol was defined as total cholesterol\n240 mg/dL or pharmacologic lipid lowering treatment. A\nassigned to attend a morning study visit to the mobile\nexamination center after an overnight fast. For partici-\npants who attended the morning study visit, glucose was\nmeasured on previously frozen plasma. Among partici-\npants without diagnosed diabetes mellitus who attended\na morning study visit and fasted 8 hours or longer (N =\nthe albuminuria analyses), undiagnosed diabetes mellitus\nwas defined as plasma glucose 126 mg/dL.\nSerum creatinine was measured using the modified\nkinetic method of Jaffe (Hitachi 917 analyzer). Serum cre-\natinine concentrations were calibrated to the assays used\nfor the development of the Modification of Diet in Renal\nDisease (MDRD) study equation.[9] The simplified\nMDRD study equation was used to calculate eGFR.[10]\nwere considered to have stage 3 or 4 CKD.[11] Urinary\nalbumin was measured using a solid-phase fluorescence\nimmunoassay; urinary creatinine was measured using\nmodified kinetic method of Jaffe (Beckman Coulter Syn-\nchron AS/Astra Analyzer). Albuminuria was defined as a\nurinary albumin to urinary creatinine ratio = 30 mg/g.[11]\nThe results were markedly consistent when gender specific\ncut-points (urinary albumin to urinary creatinine ratio =\n30 mg/g for women and = 20 mg/g for men) were used to\ndefine albuminuria and therefore are not presented.[12]\nthe National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention Institutional Review\nBoard.

Characteristics of the\npopulation were calculated, stratified by age grouping for\nparticipants with and without stage 3 or 4 CKD and with\nand without albuminuria, separately. The statistical signif-\nicance of differences in the means and prevalence esti-\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nmates for participants with and without stage 3 or 4 CKD,\nand with and without albuminuria, was determined using\nlinear and logistic regression models, respectively, after\nadjustment for age, modeled as a continuous variable.\nPrevalence ratios of stage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria,\nseparately, associated with non-Hispanic black race-eth-\nnicity, female gender, cigarette smoking, obesity, hyper-\ntension, high cholesterol, diagnosed and undiagnosed\ndiabetes mellitus, and a history of cardiovascular disease\nwere calculated for each age grouping, separately, using\nlog-binomial regression models. All regression models\nincluded age, race-ethnicity, gender, hypertension and\ndiagnosed diabetes mellitus. Undiagnosed diabetes melli-\ntus was not included in all regression models as fasting\nplasma glucose was measured only on a sub-sample of\nNHANES participants. The statistical significance of the\nlinear trends across age group was assessed by including\nan interaction term (e.g., age group*hypertension) in the\nregression model. For these models, each person within\nan age grouping was assigned the median age for that\nSample weights that account for the complex survey\ndesign of NHANES including unequal probabilities of\nselection, over-sampling, and non-response were applied\nfor all analyses using SUDAAN (Version 9.1; Research Tri-\nangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). Standard\nerrors were estimated using the Taylor series linearization\nmethod.\nResults\nRisk factors for stage 3\u00ad4 chronic kidney disease by age\ngrouping\nStage 3 or 4 CKD was progressively more common at\nrespectively.

Within each age grouping, the differ-\nence in the prevalence of cigarette smoking was not signif-\nicantly different among participants with and without\nbut not their counterparts 20 to 49 years, obesity, hyper-\ntension, high cholesterol, and a history of cardiovascular\ndisease were more common among those with compared\nto without stage 3 or 4 CKD. Within each age group, the\nprevalence of diagnosed diabetes mellitus was higher\namong participants with stage 3 or 4 CKD. Although undi-\nagnosed diabetes mellitus was more common among\nadults with stage 3 or 4 CKD within each age group, this\nwas not statistically significant after age-adjustment.\nNo patterns were present across age groups in the preva-\nlence ratio of stage 3 or 4 CKD associated with gender,\nrace-ethnicity, cigarette smoking, obesity, or high choles-\nterol [Additional file 2]. After adjustment for age, race-eth-\nnicity, gender, and diagnosed diabetes mellitus, the\nprevalence ratio of stage 3 or 4 CKD associated with\nhypertension was lower at older age (p-trend = 0.038).\nSimilarly, after adjustment for age, race-ethnicity, gender,\nhypertension, and diagnosed diabetes mellitus, the preva-\nlence ratio of stage 3 or 4 CKD was lower at older age for\ncardiovascular disease (p-trend = 0.018). Although not\nstatistically significant, a trend towards lower prevalence\nratios of stage 3 or 4 CKD at older age were present at\nolder age for diagnosed (p-trend = 0.067) and undiag-\nnosed diabetes mellitus (p-trend = 0.369).\nRisk factors for albuminuria by age grouping\nSimilar to stage 3 or 4 CKD, albuminuria was more com-\nand 26.3%, respectively, among individuals with hyper-\ntension or diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes mellitus\nout diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes mellitus or hyper-\ntension.\nAlthough not statistically significant for all age groups,\ncigarette smoking and a history of cardiovascular disease\nwere more common among participants with albuminu-\nria within each age grouping [Additional file 3]. In con-\ntrast, among adults = 70 years of age, high cholesterol was\nless common among those with albuminuria. Among all\nage groups, the prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and\ndiagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus was higher\namong those with, compared to without, albuminuria.\nAlthough no patterns in the prevalence ratio of albuminu-\nria associated with black race-ethnicity, cigarette smoking,\nand cardiovascular disease were present across age group,\nprogressively weaker associations of albuminuria with\nfemale gender, obesity, and high cholesterol at older age\ngroups were present [Additional file 4]. After adjustment\nfor age, race-ethnicity, gender, and diagnosed diabetes\nmellitus, the prevalence ratio of albuminuria associated\nwith hypertension was progressively lower in the older\nage groupings (p = 0.019). Similar patterns of lower prev-\nalence ratios of albuminuria at older age groupings were\npresent for diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nDiscussion\nIn the current study, associations were present between\ndiagnosed diabetes mellitus and stage 3 or 4 CKD for all\nage groups. Additionally, although not statistically signif-\nicant among the youngest age group, associations were\npresent between hypertension and stage 3 or 4 CKD.\nHowever, for both hypertension and diagnosed diabetes,\nthese associations were stronger among younger adults.\nAlso associations between hypertension and diagnosed or\nundiagnosed diabetes mellitus with albuminuria were\npresent across the adult lifespan but were stronger for\nyounger adults. Also, a substantial proportion of adults =\n70 years of age who were free of diabetes mellitus and\nhypertension had stage 3 or 4 CKD or albuminuria.\nRecent studies have investigated differences in ESRD and\nmortality across age grouping among patients with stage 3\nthrough 5 CKD not on dialysis.[5,6] In a study of over 2\nmillion US veterans, the relative risk of mortality associ-\nated with lower eGFR was substantially higher for\nyounger, compared to older, adults.[5] In a separate anal-\n1.73 m2 not on dialysis, the crude rates and multivariable-\nadjusted hazard ratios of ESRD within each eGFR strata\nwas lower at older age.[13] Also, in a study from South-\nampton and South-West Hampshire, United Kingdom,\nthe standardized mortality ratio of mortality was lower at\nolder age for adults with persistent elevated serum creati-\nnine (1.7 mg/dL for six months or longer).[14]\nWhile several studies have investigated risk factors for\nCKD and albuminuria, few data are available on these\nassociations by age group. In an analysis of the Cardiovas-\ncular Health Study, an observational study of community-\ndwelling adults 65 years of age at baseline, hypertension\nand cigarette smoking were associated with a decline in\nrenal function among individuals who were free of diabe-\ntes mellitus.[15] In the Coronary Artery Risk Develop-\nment in Young Adults study, a study of adults 18 to 28\nyears of age at baseline, glucose levels and change in systo-\nlic blood pressure were associated with elevated serum\ncreatinine after 15 years of follow-up among both men\nand women. Also, among 2122 Bogalusa Heart Study par-\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure was associated with\nan increased risk of albuminuria.[16] The current study\nextends these previous studies by demonstrating the\nimportance of hypertension and diabetes mellitus as risk\nfactors for stage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria across the\nfull adult lifespan from age 20 through 80 years in a large\nnationally representative sample of US adults.\nThe weaker association of hypertension and diabetes mel-\nlitus with stage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria at older age\nand high prevalence of these conditions among older\nadults without hypertension or diabetes mellitus suggests\nthat other factors may contribute to the high prevalence of\nkidney disease in older adults. For example, nephrotoxic\nagents that adults are exposed to over their life course may\nexplain the higher rate of kidney disease as people age.\nPrevious studies have reported environmental exposures\nincluding lead and cadmium are more common at older\nage and are associated with the development of kidney\ndisease.[17,18] Also, older adults have higher rates of\nexposure to potentially nephrotoxic medications (e.g.,\nacetaminophen) and medical tests (e.g., angiograms) that\nmay increase their risk of kidney disease. [19-21] Addi-\ntionally, local obstructive processes are more common in\nolder adults and may play a role in the development of\nCKD and albuminuria.[22] Atherosclerosis is another\npossible factor contributing to the high burden of stage 3\nor 4 CKD and albuminuria among older adults. Athero-\nsclerosis is very common among older adults and can\naffect the renal vasculature resulting directly in renal dam-\nage.[23,24]. Also, the presence of more severe atheroscle-\nrosis may be a marker for developing heart failure\nresulting in decreased renal perfusion. A study by Shlipak\nand colleagues found, after multivariable adjustment,\namong adults  65 years of age without a history of clini-\ncal cardiovascular disease, an ankle-brachial index <0.9\nwas associated with a 1.61 times higher risk of a rapid\nyear.[25]. Additionally, participants in their study with a\ncommon carotid intima-medial thickness  1.19 and\nand 1.41 times more likely to have a rapid decline in\neGFR, respectively. The current study did not have data on\nsub-clinical atherosclerosis, precluding investigation of\nincreased levels of this risk factor on the development of\nstage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria.\nAs prevalence ratios depend on the baseline disease risk\n(i.e., the risk of disease in the unexposed group), the\nattenuation of prevalence ratios at older age may be a sta-\ntistical anomaly resulting from the high prevalence of\nstage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria among older adults.\nHowever, the absolute difference in the prevalence of\nhypertension and diabetes mellitus for those with and\nwithout stage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria was also larger\namong younger versus older adults. The consistency of\nlarger associations of hypertension and diabetes mellitus\nwith stage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria among younger\nadults, (i.e., using absolute differences or prevalence\nratios) highlights the importance of these risk factors\namong younger adults. Furthermore, the age-dependent\nassociation between hypertension and diabetes with CKD\nsuggests that it may be a different physiologic condition\nwhen present in younger versus older adults. Future stud-\nies are needed to evaluate these differences by age.\nThe results of the current study demonstrate the impor-\ntance of hypertension and diabetes mellitus on kidney\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ndisease in young adults. However, its important to recog-\nnize the low prevalence of stage 3 or 4 CKD among adults\n< 50 years of age with hypertension or diabetes mellitus.\nWhile a previous analysis showed population-wide\nscreening for albuminuria was not cost-effective, there\nwas a clear beneficial cost-effectiveness ratio for screening\nadults with hypertension or diabetes mellitus regardless of\ntheir age.[26] Also, a scientific advisory statement from\nthe American Heart Association, developed in conjunc-\ntion with the National Kidney Foundation, recommended\nmeasuring serum creatinine, to screen for stage 3 or 4\nCKD, for all adults with hypertension or diabetes mellitus\nincluding those under 50 years of age.[27]\nLimitations and Strengths\nstudy participants under 50 years of age with stage 3 or 4\nCKD is a major limitation of the current analysis. As such,\nadequate statistical power was not available to detect\nsmall associations of risk factors with stage 3 or 4 CKD in\nthis age group. An additional limitation is the cross-sec-\nstudied established risk factors for stage 3 or 4 CKD, cau-\ntion should be taken when inferring causality based on\nthe results of the current study. Also, as with any large-\nthe MDRD study equation to estimate GFR and determine\nthe presence of stage 3 or 4 CKD. Rule and colleagues\nreported that the MDRD underestimates GFR in healthy\nindividuals. [28] The differential impact of the MDRD\nstudy equation on classifying CKD by age group warrants\nfurther study. Finally, we relied on fasting plasma glucose\nand not an oral glucose tolerance test to define the pres-\nence of diabetes mellitus. Therefore, we may have under-\nestimated the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes\nmellitus in our sample. However, it is unlikely that this\noccurred differentially by age grouping.\nOne of the major strengths of the current study was its\nlarge sample which permitted us to perform analyses for\nthree separate age categories. In addition, NHANES 1999\u00ad\n2004 provides data that represents the non-institutional-\nized civilian US population that were collected following\nstandardized protocols and data were available to analyze\nstage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria, separately. Few epide-\nmiologic data are available on the presence of albuminu-\nria among older adults. The consistency of the trends of\nlower prevalence ratios for both stage 3 or 4 CKD and\nalbuminuria at older age is noteworthy.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, hypertension and diabetes mellitus are\nassociated with stage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria across\nthe full adult age range. Importantly, this association was\nstatistically significantly stronger at younger age group-\nings. The low overall prevalence of stage 3 or 4 CKD\namong adults <50 years of age may mask the increased\nrisk of CKD among individuals with hypertension or dia-\nbetes mellitus. Further research is needed to better define\nthe differential impact of risk factors for the development\nof stage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria by age group. Addi-\ntionally, studies aimed at the identification of novel risk\nfactors for stage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria, especially\namong older adults, are warranted.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nTMI assisted with the conduct of the statistical analysis\nand conducted the initial drafting of, and revisions to, the\nmanuscript.
