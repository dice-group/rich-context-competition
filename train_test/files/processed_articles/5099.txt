Based on a review of literature, it was hypothesized that some sociodemographic factors would be\nassociated with the experience of male perpetrated physical, psychological, and sexual intimate violence in Ghana. To\nexamine this hypothesis, data were collected from a convenience but nonreferral sample of 443 women, using a structured\ninstrument. Descriptive statistics showed that 27%, 62%, and 34% of the sample, respectively, had experienced past-\nyear physical, psychological, and sexual violence. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed, using some 15\nsociodemographic factors as predictors. The analyses showed that women in rural settings had 1.71 and 2.20 times the\nodds of experiencing psychological and physical violence, respectively; women who were younger than their husbands had\n2.67 and 5.71 times the odds of experiencing psychological and sexual violence, respectively; women whose husbands were\nunemployed had 2.41 and 2.58 times the odds of experiencing psychological and physical violence, respectively; women\nwhose husbands had nonmarital sexual partners had 2.10 and 2.33 times the odds of experiencing psychological and physical\nviolence, respectively; women who rated their health as good had 2.10 and 2.39 times the odds of experiencing psychological\nand sexual violence, respectively; and women whose husbands did not appreciate them had 2.22 and 2.57 times the odds\nof experiencing physical and sexual violence, respectively. Low education and polygamous marriage were also related to\npsychological violence. Policy and practice implications of the findings are discussed.\n",

Recent large-scale multi-\ncountry studies have confirmed this by reporting higher\nprevalence rates of physical, psychological, and sexual vio-\nlence among women (Abramsky et al., 2011; Garcia-Moreno,\nJansen, Ellsberg, Heise, & Watts, 2006; Graham, Bernards,\nH. Johnson, Ollus, & Nevala, 2008). The growing consensus\nis that IPV against women is a public health problem that\nshould be tackled (Loseke, Gelles, & Cavanaugh, 2005;\nWHO, 2002). Past scholarship has offered various explana-\ntions for the occurrence of IPV against women, including the\nview that IPV is a behavior learned during childhood\nStraus, Gelles, & Steinmetz, 1980), or that it is the result of\nMunroe, Rehman, & Herron, 2000) or that it is due to the\ninfluence of alcohol and other substances (Field, Caetano, &\nSwan, Tate, & Klein, 2006). However, feminist scholarship\nargues that male perpetrated IPV is a characteristic of strong\npatriarchal attitudes/beliefs held among men that leads to\nsubjugation and violence against women (VAW; Dobash &\nStark, 2007). In Ghana, for instance, scholars have noted the\ncultural predisposition of men and boys to dominate (Mann\nquest to maintain control over wives, which has sometimes\n1Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland and\nLabrador, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nPaul Alhassan Issahaku, Memorial University of Newfoundland,\n230 Prince Philip Dr., St. John's College, St. John's,\nNewfoundland and Labrador, A1C 3S7, Canada.\nEmail: pissahaku@yahoo.com\nCorrelates of Intimate Partner\nViolence in Ghana\nPaul Alhassan Issahaku1\n Keywords\nintimate partner violence, correlates of partner violence, Ghana, woman being younger than the partner, partner having\nnonmarital partners\n2 SAGE Open\nIPV is a problem in Ghana, registering a high prevalence\n(Coker-Appiah & Cusack, 1999; Ghana Statistical Service\nFor example, in a national survey 33% of women reported\npartner physical and sexual violence (Coker-Appiah &\nhealth survey (DHS) found that 58% and 42.8% of women\nhave suffered physical and sexual violence, respectively, by\na current or former husband (GSS, 2009). Furthermore,\ncases among Ghanaian couples, indicating that in this society\nIPV can sometimes lead to fatalities.\nThis article contributes to existing literature by investigat-\ning correlates of male perpetrated IPV in Ghana. Although\nthe seriousness of the issue has necessitated passage of legis-\nlation criminalizing domestic violence (Republic of Ghana,\n2007), we currently do not know, scientifically, what factors\nare associated with IPV in Ghana, information that will\ninform policies and programs to address the issue. The article\nuses data from the administrative northern region of Ghana\nto bridge the existing gap.\nLiterature Review\nUnlike earlier literature which explained male perpetrated\npartner violence as a behavior learned through experience\nand exposure (Straus et al., 1980), or the result of personality\nDutton & van Ginkel, 1997), or a psychiatric problem (West,\nRoy, & Nichols, 1978), or simply the exercise of male power\nand control--masculinity (Jewkes et al., 2002; M. P. Johnson,\nrent scholarship is on identifying factors that correlate with\nIPV so as to identify pragmatic policy and practice interven-\ntions to combat violence. Correlates of male perpetrated IPV\nare described as factors that are associated with increased\nrisk of perpetration or victimization. Several such factors\nhave been identified in studies conducted across different\nnational and geographic contexts. The following is a brief\nreview of the literature on correlates of male perpetrated IPV.\nCorrelates of Male Perpetrated IPV\nSeveral sociodemographic characteristics have been identi-\nfied as correlates that are associated with the risk of IPV vic-\ntimization among women. Depending on the social context,\nsome factors are more prominent than others as risk markers\nfor IPV perpetration/victimization, although some correlates\nare common to most studies perhaps because these contexts\nare fundamentally similar.\nAlcohol use. Literature examining the association between alco-\nhol use and male perpetrated IPV is growing. Studies in North\nAmerica and other parts of the world have found a significant\nrelationship between alcohol consumption and IPV perpetra-\ntion/victimization. Several studies in the United States of\nAmerica (U.S.) identify alcohol drinking as a key correlate of\nIPV (Fals-Stewart, 2003; Fals-Stewart, Leonard, & Birchler,\ninvestigating aggressive behavior, alcohol use, impulsivity, and\nattitudes to domestic violence using a probability sample of\nalcohol use also reported perpetrating domestic violence and\nthose alcohol users were 3.2 times more likely to perpetrate\nIPV. In two samples of U.S. men entering domestic violence or\nalcoholism treatment, Fals-Stewart (2003) and Fals-Stewart\net al. (2005) have found that alcohol use is associated with\nhigher odds of frequency and severity of partner violence. Sim-\nilarly, in another U.S. study, Snow et al. (2006) found that\n\"problem drinking\" was strongly related to perpetration of\nphysical violence (r = .17) and to psychological violence (r =\n.23), suggesting that more drinking is associated with more\nperpetration of violence. Outside of the United States,\nAbramsky et al. (2011) have found a link between alcohol use\nand IPV against women. In their analysis of data drawn from\n49, Abramsky et al. identified problem drinking as a key cor-\nrelate of IPV. According to the researchers, \"In all sites odds of\nIPV were higher in relationships where one or both partners\nhad problems with alcohol . . . \" (p. 13). In another study\ninvolving 13 countries, Graham et al. (2011) found that aggres-\nsion toward a partner was more severe when either the male\npartner or both had been drinking prior to the incident.Accord-\ning to Graham et al. (2011) although alcohol may not be the\ncause of IPV, it can worsen the violent incident. However, not\nall alcohol users perpetrate IPV and men and women who use\nalcohol do not commit violence in equal measure (Giancola\nThompson & Kingree, 2006). Therefore, it is not clear what in\nalcohol predisposes users to aggressive behavior.\nAge and age disparity between couples. Current literature sug-\ngests that there is an association between age and IPV against\nwomen. First, some research has shown that there is an\nincreased risk of violence in older couples (Luke, Schuler,\nMai, Thien, & Minh, 2007; Vakili, Nadrian, Fathipoor,\nstudy of couple attitudes and marital violence involving a\nsample of 465 women in Viet Nam found that there was an\nincreased likelihood of older men hitting their wives and an\nincreased likelihood of older women being hit by their part-\nners. Vakili et al. (2010) also found a significant positive cor-\nrelation between age of woman and IPV when they analyzed\ndata from a sample of 702 women drawn from an Iranian\ncounty. Similarly, in an African American female subsample,\na U.S. study (Lacey, West, Matusko, & Jackson, 2016) found\nof severe partner physical violence. Other studies show that\nIssahaku 3\nage disparity is related to IPV, especially, that women are at\nheightened risk of IPV victimization if they are younger (in\nmost cases, less than 30 years; Faramarzi, Esmailzadeh, &\nwomen in Iran (Faramarzi et al., 2005) found that younger\nwomen (20 years) had 2.23 times the odds of experiencing\nIPV compared with older women. Similarly, in his analysis\nof data from 500 women in various parts of Bangladesh,\nwere at increased risk of sexual violence during pregnancy,\nmenstruation, and the neonatal state. However, a 10-country\nstudy (Abramsky et al., 2011) produced mixed results on the\nrelationship between age and IPV. Abramsky et al. found a\nstrong association between younger age of women and\nincreased risk of IPV across the sites. But they also report\nthat older age of the woman was also associated with\nincreased risk of IPV. The findings on the effect of age and\nage disparity on IPV are not conclusive.Although we can say\nthat both younger and older women are faced with increased\nrisk of IPV, the same is not suggested about IPV perpetration\namong younger and older men. Luke et al. suggest that per-\nhaps because older men and women have been exposed to\nthe potential of violence for longer periods in their relation-\nships, they are more likely to report having hit or been hit.\nCurrent employment status.Employment status of either or\nboth of the couple is an important correlate of IPV, with most\nstudies indicating that unemployment is significantly related\nto IPV. For example, Vakili et al. (2010) found that women\nwho were not currently employed had a higher mean reported\nIPV and women whose partners were currently not employed\nalso had a higher mean reported IPV. In addition, Faramarzi\nand colleagues (2005) found that women who reported not\ncurrently employed had 2.75 times the odds of experiencing\nIPV. Similarly, a Lagos, Nigeria, study involving 400 women\n(Onigbogi, Odeyemi, & Onigbogi, 2015) found that women\nwhose partners were unemployed had 5.89 times the odds of\nexperiencing sexual violence. Furthermore, in their study of\nfound that among men who reported perpetrating IPV there\nwas a significant association between a spouse's unemploy-\nment status and physical, psychological, and sexual IPV.\nFindings of a U.S. study using a sample of 848 couples (Cun-\nradi, Todd, Duke, & Ames, 2009) support the fact that unem-\nployment of either or both partners increases the risk of IPV.\nHowever, as Naved and Persson (2005) have found in a Ban-\ngladeshi sample of 2,702 women, sometimes women who\nare employed (earning an income) are also at risk of IPV.\nResidential setting.Studies on correlates of IPV have found\nthat the setting in which the couple resides, rural versus\nurban, makes a difference in the experience and/or perpetra-\ntion of IPV. Some studies find that women in rural settings\nare at a higher risk of IPV or that men in rural areas have a\nhigher likelihood of perpetrating partner violence. The work\nof Vakili et al. (2010) is important on this point. Vakili et al.\nfound that women in rural residence showed a higher mean\nof reported IPV compared with women in urban residence.\nThis finding corroborates what was reported by Haj-Yahia\n(2000). In an analysis of data from two surveys involving\nfound that, across these surveys, residing in a rural setting\nwas consistently significantly related to the risk of experi-\nencing physical, psychological, and sexual abuse. However,\nperhaps the effect of residence on IPV is context dependent.\nThis is because a study conducted in Chebu, the Philippines\n(Hindin & Adair, 2002) found that women in rural settings\nare less likely to experience IPV compared with women in\nurban areas. This suggests that the effect of residential set-\nting on IPV varies from context to context.\nOther correlates. A number of other factors have been identi-\nfied as correlating with IPV in the literature. Four of these\nthat are of interest to the present study include level of (for-\nmal) education, type of marriage (polygamous vs. monoga-\nmous marriage), presence of nonmarital sexual partners, and\nnumber of children in the marriage. Higher formal educa-\ntional attainment is generally found to be a protective factor\nthat increased formal education of both partners or of the\nmale partner is associated with a decreased risk of IPV\nagainst women. Type of marriage correlates with IPV such\nthat women in polygamous marriage are shown to have a\nhigher risk of IPV victimization (Abramsky et al., 2011;\nOnigbogi et al., 2015). Similar to a polygamous context,\nresearch has shown that women whose partners have other\nnonmarital sexual partners are at increased risk of IPV\ninvestigating the relationship between number of children\nand partner violence indicate that an increase in number of\nchildren is associated with increased risk of IPV (Acevedo,\nbogi et al., 2015). For example, after controlling for other\nfactors, a U.S. study using a mixed sample (57.9% women;\nAcevedo et al., 2013) found that participants who had two or\nmore children had 2.21 times the odds of reporting IPV com-\npared with those who had only one child. Although not found\nin many studies, perhaps because they are not regarded as\nimportant factors, polygamous marriage, presence of non-\nmarital sexual partners, and increased number of children are\nimportant considerations for a study in a context like Ghana\nwhere, among many cultural groups, these are almost the\nnorm rather than the exception.\nFocus of the Present Study\nAlthough some work has been done on domestic violence\nin Ghana and the issue has received legislative attention, no\n4 SAGE Open\nresearch has explored correlates of male perpetrated IPV in\nthe country. The present study therefore contributes to\nexisting scholarship by investigating factors associated\nwith IPV in Ghana. Based on what has been found in the\nliterature, it was hypothesized that some sociodemographic\nfactors, including age, employment status, type of mar-\nriage, alcohol use, residential setting, and level of formal\neducation, among others, will be significantly associated\nwith physical, psychological, and sexual IPV experience\namong women. The study used data from a survey with\nwomen in Northern Ghana to examine the stated hypothe-\nsis, making it possible to see how the Ghanaian situation\ncompares with what has been found in the literature.\nStudy Context\nThe research was carried out in the administrative northern\nregion of Ghana. Ghana, formerly the Gold Coast, is a coastal\ncountry in West African which shares borders with Togo, Cote\nd'Ivoire, and Burkina Faso. The population of Ghana is esti-\nmated to be over 24 million, of which 51% is female (GSS,\n2012). The research was carried out in northern region, one of\nthe administrative regions within the larger geographic area\nknown as northern Ghana. Northern region lies in a semiarid\nsavanna zone, with rain-fed single-season agriculture as the\nmain economic activity. The region, with an estimated popula-\ntotal land mass, is the largest of the ten administrative jurisdic-\ntions of the country, and is divided into 20 local government\nareas--district assemblies. Custom and tradition in northern\nregion place a high premium on marriage and the family insti-\ntution in which women are subordinated to men. For example,\nalthough young men and women look forward to marriage and\nfamily life, it is the man who should initiate the process, pay\nthe bride price and bring the woman to his father's compound,\nand act as head and breadwinner (Nukunya, 2003). In addi-\ntion, men have permission to take an additional wife whereas\nthe woman is expected to commit to one husband (Mahama,\n2004). Again, in matters of inheritance and ascension to chief-\ntaincy positions--traditional leadership--men (sons and\nnephews) rank ahead of women. This unequal placement of\nwomen in relation to men in this society provides an important\nlens to look at men's controlling behavior and violence toward\nwomen. (A more detailed description of the study context has\nbeen provided in another article by Issahaku [2015].)\nMethod\nParticipants\nFour hundred and forty-three (443) women participated in\nthe study. These were recruited from outpatient popula-\ntions at six district hospitals, using targeted sampling\napproaches. As explained by Singleton and Straits (2005),\nalthough targeted sampling is a nonprobability sampling\napproach it is not necessarily purposive or convenience\nsampling because it captures a cross-section of the popula-\ntion of interest at strategic locations. Established ethical\nguidelines suggested that institutional settings that provide\nservices to women are safe grounds to recruit women into\nresearch on a sensitive topic such as VAW (WHO, 2001).\nThis guided the choice of district health facilities as recruit-\nment sites. Furthermore, the Research Ethics Board of the\nUniversity of Toronto advised that to ensure privacy and\nconfidentiality, participants be contacted at health centers\nwith daily outpatient populations large enough to provide\nanonymity. Information received from the regional direc-\ntorate of health services indicated that these facilities\nrecord an average daily outpatient department (OPD)\nattendance of more than 300 people. Women, who visit\nthese facilities for their own health care needs or as care-\ngivers to sick children and relatives, constitute a substan-\ntial proportion of the OPD populations. (Participants of\nthis study were not at the health centers to receive treat-\nment as victims of IPV. These facilities are not violence\nsupport service centers and do not assess for violence as\npart of the routine care.) At the selected hospitals, women\nin the OPD population who were within the age range of\n18 to 49 years and in intimate relationships were eligible to\nparticipate in this study. (Most studies on IPV focus on\nwomen of this age range because that is the period during\nwhich many women are in active marital unions [see\nJohnson, 2006].) Posters designed to advertise the study at\nrecruitment sites were not used because it was feared that\ndoing so could attract the attention of men and possibly\njeopardize the participation of some women. With this lim-\nited publicity, the rule of thumb was that a woman should\nbe approached in such a way that no intruder would know\nwhat was being discussed. Any woman willing to partici-\npate following a solicitation in face-to-face contact was\nincluded in the sample. Recruitment was done concur-\nrently with data collection. Data collectors did a more\ndetailed introduction of this study, emphasizing its purpose\nand why they were the people being contacted as part of\nthe informed consent process. The consent process high-\nlighted the overall importance of this study, the unique\ncontribution of the information they would provide, as\nwell as the potential risks and benefits to individual par-\nticipants. It also highlighted the voluntary nature of par-\nticipation and the right to decline participation or to\nwithdraw from the interview at any time without conse-\nquence. At the convenience of participants, instrument\nadministration happened immediately following consent\nor at a later time. All interviews took place in confidential\nOPD spaces designated for that purpose by management of\nthe health centers. In all, 600 women were approached to\nparticipate in this study. Out of this number, 443 women\nagreed, resulting in a 74% response rate. (These details\nhave been provided elsewhere [Issahaku, 2015].)\nIssahaku 5\nMeasures\nParticipant sociodemographic characteristics alongside mea-\nsures of physical, psychological, and sexual violence were\nthe important measures for the study. Sociodemographic\nmeasures were treated as the independent/predictor vari-\nables, whereas the physical, psychological, and sexual vio-\nlence measures were the dependent variables.\nParticipant characteristics.The following characteristics of\nparticipants and their partners were taken: age relative to\nhusband's--participants were asked whether they were\nyounger than the husband (yes/no); type of marriage (polyg-\namous/monogamous); number of years of marriage; number\nof children in the marriage; years of education (participant's\nand partner's); woman and her partner's current employment\nstatus (employed/not employed); whether husband is a chief\n(yes/no); whether husband drinks alcohol (yes/no); couple's\nresidence (rural/urban); participant's assessment of her cur-\nrent health status (good/poor); whether husband has nonmar-\nital sexual partners (yes/no); whether husband appreciates\n(commends) her for her contributions (yes/no); whether par-\nticipant belongs to any associations (yes/no); and partici-\npant's religious affiliation (Christian, Muslim, Other).\nMeasures of partner violence.The WHO's VAW instrument\n(see Ellsberg & Heise, 2005), which has been validated for\nwider use in developing countries and was part of Ghana's\nstudy, the section on violence during pregnancy in the origi-\nnal instrument was eliminated since the focus was on vio-\nlence without reference to any event in the life cycle.\nMoreover, three questions were added to the psychological\nviolence subscale, making it seven items in all for the present\nstudy. The three items included refuse to eat your food, refuse\nto communicate with you, and refuse to perform your family\nmember's funeral. These questions were added to the scale\nbecause of the author's understanding of the culture and ways\nwhere men use different forms of psychological abuse against\nwomen. (Other researchers have made similar modifications\nto the psychological violence subscale for cultural relevance\nadaptation, the violence instrument had 16 items in all.\nPast-year physical violence was a six-item Yes or No scale\nmeasuring physically assaultive acts such as slapping you or\nthrowing something at you that could hurt, push you or shove\nyou or pull your hair, hit you with fist or something that could\nhurt you, kick you or drag you or beat you up, choke you or\nburn you on purpose, and threat to use or actual use of weap-\nons against you. Past-year psychological violence was a\nseven-item Yes or No scale measuring men's actions that are\npotentially psychologically injurious. Examples include the\nfollowing: insult you or make you feel bad about yourself;\nbelittle or humiliate you in public; scare or intimidate you on\npurpose; threaten to hurt you or someone dear to you, refuse\nto communicate with you; refuse to eat your food; and refuse\nto perform your family member's funeral. Past-year sexual\nviolence was a three-item Yes or No scale. They included the\nfollowing: forced you to have sexual intercourse, made you\nengage in nonconsensual sex due to fear, and forced you to\nperform something sexual that feels degrading. Reliability\nanalysis showed Cronbach's alphas of .72 (N = 6), .74 (N = 7),\nand .61 (N = 3), respectively, for the physical, psychological,\nand sexual violence subscales.\nData Collection\nData were collected as part of the author's doctoral disserta-\ntion research. The major medium of data collection was face-\nto-face interviews. Assistants interpreted the English\ninstrument in structured interviews for women who did not\nhave English proficiency. The four main local languages\nused in these interviews were Dagbanli, Twi, Hausa, and\nGonja. On average, interviews lasted for 45 min. The data\ncollection team of 12 female assistants consisted of practic-\ning nurses, high school teachers, and upper-year university\nstudents. Data collectors were trained in VAW research based\non the WHO's (2001) guidelines. They were also given an\norientation on solution-focused brief counseling to help par-\nticipants deal with emotions during the interviews and to\nrefer participants who needed further help. Participant safety\nwas taken care of by ensuring, among other things, the pri-\nvacy and confidentiality of the interviews and ensuring that\nexperienced nurse practitioners were on standby to offer\nemotional support to participants. Participants who could\nread and write in English were allowed the choice of inde-\npendently completing the questionnaire.At each of the health\ncenters, an experienced female nurse practitioner was on\nstandby to provide support. Each participant received GHS 2\n(two Ghana Cedis) as appreciation of their time and help\nwith the study. Protocols for this study went through full\nreview by the University of Toronto Research Ethics Board.\nData Analysis and Results\nData were analyzed using the statistical package for the social\nsciences (SPSS) Version 20. Frequency distribution, bivariate\nchi-square, and multivariate logistic regression analyses were\nperformed to make sense of the data. Frequency distribution\nanalysis (see Table 1) showed the following: 46% came from\nrural areas, 67% identified as younger than their partners, 35%\nidentified their marriage as polygamous, and 70% were cur-\nrently employed. Other characteristics include the following:\nnumber of children was 2.55 (SD = 1.87), mean years of educa-\ntion for participants was 7.89 (SD = 7.67), mean years of part-\nMuslim, 17% rated their general health as poor, 19% reported\ntheir partners take alcohol, 20% reported their partners have\nnonmarital sexual partners, 22% reported their partners were\n6 SAGE Open\nnot currently employed, 25% reported they belong to an asso-\nciation, 11% indicated their partner is chief, and 27% reported\ntheir partners do not appreciate. Frequency distribution of the\nviolence measures showed that 69% of the sample (N = 443)\nhad experienced past-year IPV, 62% had experienced psycho-\nlogical violence, 27% had experience physical violence, and\n34% had experienced sexual violence (Table 1).\nBivariate relationships.Table 2 presents cross-tabulations for\nthe bivariate analyses. As can be seen, all the demographic\nvariables were significantly related to at least one of the vio-\nlence measures at the alpha level of .05 or lower as follows:\nType of residence was significantly associated with psycho-\nWoman's age relative to her partner's was significantly associ-\nsignificantly associated with physical violence (\u00b2 = 16.74, p <\nmembership was significantly associated with psychological\nband employment status was significantly associated with\n< .001).

The religious affiliation\nvariable was dichotomized into Christian and Muslim/\nOther. Other assumptions of the logistic regression analy-\nses were met as follows: the outcome variables were\ndichotomous, statistically independent, mutually exclu-\nsive and collectively exhaustive, and the sample size (N \n400) was large enough to produce meaningful regression\ncoefficients.\nPredictive models.Separate logistic regression models were\nused to assess how the 15 variables predicted IPV. These pre-\ndictors were type of residence, type of marriage, whether\nwoman is younger than partner, religious affiliation, whether\nwoman belongs to an association, woman employment, part-\nner employment, whether partner is chief, partner alcohol use,\nwhether partner has nonmarital sexual partners, woman's\nassessed health, whether partner appreciates, partner educa-\ntion, woman education, and number of children.

In all three models, the relationship between alcohol use\nand violence was not significant.\nDiscussion\nResults of this study corroborate previous research on IPV\namong women. Consistent with findings of studies in con-\ntexts similar to the Ghanaian society there were high rates of\nphysical, psychological, and sexual IPV in this study. For\nexample, similar to findings in multicountry studies which\nshow that prevalence rates of IPV among women range from\nin the present study were 69% overall, 62% psychological\nviolence, 34% sexual violence, and 27% physical violence.\nThese are also comparable with results of Vakili et al.'s\n43.7% of the sample, reported psychological, sexual, and\nphysical IPV, respectively. It is possible that IPV was under-\nreported in our sample, giving that domestic violence is a\nsensitive subject and coupled with the social norm in the\nGhanaian society which enjoins individuals not to discuss\nthe family's secret with outsiders.\nConsistent with previous research on correlates of IPV,\nour findings show that some factors do influence the risk of\nIPV victimization among, with rural residence, woman being\nyounger than partner, partner having nonmarital sexual part-\nners, partner not appreciating the woman, woman assessing\nher health as good, partner not currently employed, polyga-\nmous marriage, and partner having only elementary or no\neducation increasing the risk of IPV. Our finding that women\nin rural settings are at a higher risk of IPV compared with\nwomen in urban residence confirms the work of other\net al., 2010). The finding that women in rural residence were\n1.71 times and 2.20 times more likely to experience physical\nand psychological violence, respectively, corroborates Vakili\net al.'s (2010) reported higher mean violence among rural\nwomen. It is not known for sure what links rural residence to\nthe risk of IPV. Perhaps isolation and the strength or other-\nwise of patriarchal traditions may help in understanding the\nlink. It is possible that women in rural communities are more\neasily isolated by their husbands than those in urban cities.\nThis is because most rural communities do not have social\nand recreational centers and, perhaps there are only a few\nfriends for the woman to hang out with, making it possible\nfor men to easily confine and have their way with their wives.\nMoreover, as Nukunya (2003) has noted of Ghana, perhaps\npatriarchal tradition, which legitimizes a husband's author-\nity, is much stronger in the rural society. However, the work\nof Hindin and Adair (2002) which more IPV among women\nin urban settings contradicts our position. Indeed, Hindin and\nAddair reported that women in the remotest of rural settings\nwere the least at risk of IPV. This suggests that IPV among\nwomen may not be unique to any residential setting.\nOur finding that younger women are at increased risk of\nIPV is consistent with previous research (Faramarzi et al.,\nof these cultures, age comes with power and privilege and,\nespecially in a patriarchal society where men occupy a posi-\ntion of privilege, the younger age of the woman relative to\npartner aggravates her vulnerability. Therefore, consonant\nwith Faramarzi et al. (2005) who report that younger women\nwere 2.23 times more likely to experience IPV, we found that\nencing psychological and sexual violence, respectively.\nHowever, other studies have shown that both younger and\nolder women are at risk of IPV (Abramsky et al., 2011; Lacey,\nwomen who are younger than their partners may be especially\nvulnerable to IPV, what the literature suggests, generally, is\nthat IPV risk among women does not respect a woman's age\nrelative to her partner's. In societies such as Ghana, age is a\ntool in the system of social-gender stratification based on\njudgments of maturity, responsibility, and cultural role sig-\nRosaldo, 1974), in which case a man is always \"older\" than a\nwoman because of the privilege attached to his sense of judg-\nment and social roles. As a result, perhaps women in general\nand married women in particular are always under the disci-\nplinary authority of the man, including his use of violence.\nOur findings that women whose partners were currently\nnot employed and women whose partners had nonmarital\nsexual partners had higher odds of experiencing violence\nconfirm previous research. The finding that women whose\nof experiencing psychological and physical violence, respec-\ntively, adds to the Nigerian study (Onigbogi et al., 2015) in\nwhich women whose husbands were unemployed had almost\nsix times the odds of experiencing sexual violence. Perhaps\nthe association between male unemployment and IPV is\nexplained by the concept of \"male identity crisis\" (Bradley,\nized by feelings of vulnerability, loss of control, loss of\nmeaning, and loss of status arising from an imminent inabil-\nity to fulfill the role of breadwinner (Ehrenreich, 1995;\nMohammed, 2004). Under such circumstances \"of threat-\nened egotism\" (Baumeister, Smart, & Boden, 1996, p. 5),\nmen may use violence at the least provocation. Luke et al.\n(2007) discussed this issue in terms of men's possession of\nlittle resources or low status in their Vietnamese study.\nAlthough not significant in our study, other studies show that\nunemployed women are at increased risk of IPV (Cunradi\nconsistent with what has been reported by others (Abramsky\nour findings that (a) women whose partners had nonmarital\nexperience psychological and physical violence, respec-\ntively, and (b) women in polygamous marriage had 1.73\ntimes the odds of experiencing psychological violence. A\ncontext of nonmarital sexual partnerships is similar to polyg-\namous marriage perhaps only that nonmarital partners do not\nreside in the conjugal home. Women in these contexts usu-\nally view each other rivals (Benneh, 1994; Kuenyehia &\nwomen whose partners have other sexual partners may be\nchallenging their husbands over the issue and get physically\nbeaten. Women in this context may also face psychological\nviolence in the form of insults, negative comparisons, belit-\ntlement, and cessation of communication.\nOther correlates found in the study, including the effect of\neducation, woman's assessed health, and whether or not partner\nappreciates the woman are an important contribution to the lit-\nerature. Our finding that women whose partners had only ele-\nmentary or no education were at increased risk of IPV is\nconsistent with research which reports that increased educa-\ntional achievement is associated with decreased risk of violence\n(Abramsky et al., 2011; Ishida, Stupp, Melian, Serbanescu, &\neducation and IPV suggests that men with higher educational\nattainment are perhaps more accepting of egalitarian values and\nrespect women's rights to personal safety from harm. In addi-\ntion, perhaps men who have attained a level of formal education\nunderstand the negative implications of IPV and are also aware\noflawswhichprotectwomenagainstdomesticviolence.Unique\nto our study, and puzzling, are the findings that women who\nassessed their health as good and women whose partner did not\nappreciate them were at increased risk of IPV. The effect of\nwoman's health on IPV in our study can be likened to the obser-\nvation in other studies that when women control resources and\ndecision making they are at increased risk of violence (Hindin\n& Adair, 2002). Because health is wealth and wealth is strength\nperhaps women who assess their health as good act tough, chal-\nlenge conservative male perceptions of women as the weaker\nsex, and appear threatening to men who use violence to feel in\ncontrol. It is also possible that in the social context of our study\nmen selectively beat or sexually abuse healthy women to avoid\nresponsibility for any serious repercussions. Our finding that if\na partner does not appreciate the woman she is at increased risk\nof IPV is also consistent with the finding that even when women\nare working and contributing income to support the family they\nare still at risk of violence (Abramsky et al., 2011; Naved &\nPersson, 2005). Indeed, dual-earner families are now the norm\nrather than the exception (Bradley, 1999). Hence, in addition to\ntheir child care and homecare work, most women are out there\nworking to contribute income to their families.As a result, non-\nappreciation of the woman is in itself violence and to follow it\nup with physical and sexual violence is double jeopardy which\nwe can hardly explain. However, if men in this society have the\nopportunity to establish sexual liaison with other women then,\nperhaps it is understandable why they can afford not to appreci-\nate their wives.\nLimitations of the study should be taken into account\nwhen interpreting the results. The sample employed in this\nstudy was regional, nonrandomly selected, and characterized\nby a volunteer bias. In addition, the measures used in the\nstudy were self-reports which are characterized by a response\nbias and where underreporting is highly likely. Another limi-\ntation is that we did not introduce any control variables in the\nanalyses. The noted limitations notwithstanding, however,\n443 is a reasonably large sample and recruiting from public\nplaces which attract a cross-section of the general population\nof women ensured that some diversity was reflected in the\ndata. Therefore, given that there has been no prior empirical\ninvestigation of correlates of IPV in Ghana, the study makes\nan important contribution to the literature and has implica-\ntions for policy and practice in the country.\nConclusion and Implications\nIPV victimization is a serious issue among women in Ghana,\nwith nearly seven in 10 women experiencing violence at some\npoint in their marriage. This corroborates and adds to findings\nof research in other contexts (Garcia-Moreno et al., 2006;\nsome sociodemographic factors and IPV found in this study is\nalso consistent with and adds to existing literature. Although\nnot exclusive to them, women in rural areas, women who are\nyounger than their partner, who assess their health as good,\nwhose partners have other sexual relationships, and whose\npartners do not appreciate them are particularly vulnerable to\nIPV victimization. In a patriarchal society like Ghana where\nmen \"construct women as legitimate vehicles for the reconfir-\nmation of male powerfulness through beatings . . .\" (Jewkes\n(in rural areas), strong/healthy women, and women challeng-\ning men over their extramarital escapades are at increased risk\nof violence. For similar reasons, the risk of violence is higher\nfor women whose husbands have only elementary or no edu-\ncation or whose husbands are unemployed. If postsecondary\neducation and a white-collar job enhance a man's social\nstanding, then with neither of these he will have to assert his\nplace in relation to the woman by some other means which,\nunfortunately in this case, is violence.\nFindings of this study have implications for policy and\npractice in Ghana. A number of such implications are outlined\nhere for serious consideration by government, civil society\norganizations (CSOs), and nongovernmental organizations\n(NGOs) who are stakeholders and partners in promoting fam-\nily and community well-being. To begin, the age at which\nyoung people establish marriage relationships needs a critical\nreview. Maturity in terms of self-discipline, personal responsi-\nbility, and accountability for behavior should be factored into\nthe definition of legal age of marriage. If maturity comes with\neducation and young people need up to 18 years to finish high\nschool and enter college, then it makes sense to raise the age of\nmarriage to 21/22 years. However, although Ghana's law puts\nthe age of maturity at 18 years, it is not uncommon to find 16-\nto 17-year-old girls in marriage. Indeed, in areas where polyg-\namy is practiced it is possible to find a girl married to a\npolygamous man who is old enough to be her father. What is\nseriously required, therefore, is concerted education and\nawareness about the harmful implications of marrying teenage\ngirls or giving teenage daughters into marriage. Second, the\nfinding that women in rural Ghana are at increased risk of IPV\nsuggests that within the broader framework of tackling vio-\nlence, rural areas be given special attention. In this regard, it is\nrecommended that (a) disparity in access to quality education\nand educational attainment between rural and urban Ghana be\nbridged, (b) education and awareness about the problem and\nabout laws protecting women against violence be targeted to\nrural communities, and (c) perhaps the provision of woman-\nfriendly recreational facilities in rural communities will give\nwomen safe spaces to break from the routine interactions of\nviolence with their husbands. The CSOs and NGOs who\nalready have a strong presence and influence in rural Ghana\ncan partner government and village elders in the education and\nawareness drives and in providing safe spaces for women. A\nthird policy intervention suggested by this study is education\nand awareness about the economic and social costs of polyg-\namy and extramarital partnerships. Polygamy and extramarital\npartnerships are not lawful in Ghana, but they are not also out-\nlawed. Indeed, as Islam permits men to have multiple marital\npartners, Ghana cannot outlaw these practices. However, we\nthink that perhaps when men become acutely aware of the eco-\nnomic and social costs of multiple partnerships they will\nengage less in them and that will reduce the associated risk of\nviolence. As we have suggested elsewhere (Issahaku, 2016),\ntraditional and religious leaders who occupy positions of influ-\nence, including chiefs and their elders-in-council, Imams,\nPriests, and Pastors would, in partnership with government,\nCSOs, and NGOs, play an important role in the education and\nawareness on the harm of multiple and extramarital partner-\nships. Finally, if women who assess their health as good are at\nincreased risk of IPV then, as we have suggested elsewhere\n(Issahaku, 2015), we reiterate the need to encourage routine\nvisits to health clinics among women. At these clinics, in\naddition to routine health checks, women would be assessed\nand given support for violence and emotional difficulties. A\nuniversal health insurance coverage would significantly\nremove barriers to routine visits to health centers among\nwomen.\nFindings of this study also have implications for future\nresearch in Ghana, two of which are the following. First,\nthere is need for a larger scale study employing random sam-\npling techniques to further investigate factors associated\nwith IPV in the country. This would fill one of the limitations\nof the present study. Second, and perhaps more important,\nfuture research should try to explain/theorize the relationship\nbetween IPV and the identified correlates through qualitative\ndesigns. This would enhance understanding of the mecha-\nnism between these factors so that appropriate strategies\nwould be developed to disrupt the relationship.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAbramsky, T., Watts, C.
