Most individuals check their faces\nin the mirror every morning and take opportunities to view themselves throughout the day. Self-face\nis an important aspect of self-representation. Indeed, numerous studies have shown that individuals\nare highly sensitive to stimuli relevant to the self. For instance, the self-reference effect, a well-known\nphenomenon, indicates that information related to oneself is better recalled than other information\n(Rogers, Kuiper, & Kirker, 1977). For instance, Rogers et al. (1977) asked participants to rate adjec-\ntives (e.g., \"confident\") and then tested their memory on these adjectives. They reported that those\nwords which were rated whether it described the participants themselves were recalled better than did\nthose which were rated whether it was meaningful.\nRecent studies in neuroscience have also shown that self-referential processing has dissociable\nstructures from the processing of other information within the brain (e.g., Kelley et al., 2002; Keyes,\nBrady, Reilly, & Foxe, 2010; Whitfield-Gabrieli et al., 2011), indicating that knowledge about the self\nis unique. Furthermore, self-advantage has also been observed in face recognition. People respond\nfaster to their own faces than to the faces of others (Keenan et al., 1999; Keyes & Brady, 2000; Tong\n& Nakayama, 1999), which also may reflect processing differences between the self-face and other-\nface. Ma and Han (2010, 2012) suggested that the faster response time in processing the self-face was\nrelated to implicitly associated positive attributes of self, and positive items are known to be processed\nfaster than are negative items (e.g., Feyereisen, Malet, & Martin, 1986; Osgood & Hoosain, 1983;\nWe see our faces every day in mirrors, and usually search for ourselves first when viewing a pho-\ntograph of a group. However, many people complain that their faces look different, and often worse, in\nphotographs. One possible explanation is that a photograph shows a person how others see them, while\nthe mirror image shows the reverse. Other explanations include that a camera lens distorts images of\nfaces by rendering them two-dimensional and static, while mirror images show three-dimensional and\ndynamic representations. There is empirical support for the latter theory, with faces in videos being\nrated as more flattering than faces in static images (Post, Haberman, Iwaki, & Whitney, 2012). These\ntheories, however, do not explain why some individuals tend to judge the image of others as more\na Pion publication\nWhy am I not photogenic? Differences in face memory for\nthe self and others\nfavorable than the images of themselves. Therefore, we proposed the following: self-face memory is\nperceived as more beautiful than the real face, whereas other-face memory is more consistent with that\nof the real face. In other words, when an individual compares their memorized self-face with their face\nin a photograph, the latter is judged less attractive.\nThere is empirical evidence that supports this contention: for instance, research shows that self-\nreferential stimuli hold more attention than do other-face stimuli (Devue, Van der Stigchel, Br\u00e9dart, &\nTheeuwes, 2009; Turk et al., 2013), which influences self-reference memory. Previous studies of false\nmemories have demonstrated that divided attention reduces false recognition of semantically related\nwords (Dewhurst, Barry, Swannell, Holmes, & Bathurst, 2007); thus, too much attention may gener-\nate associated false memories during recognition. Self-focused attention and self-consciousness have\nalso been linked to memory distortions of self-referential information (Djikic, Perterson, & Zelazo,\n2005; Walter, 2007). In summary, attention likely increases the certainty of the \"made-up mind\" and\ntherefore induces a false memory about the self-face.\nFurthermore, Ma and Han (2010, 2012) proposed the implicit positive association theory of self-\nadvantage during face recognition, which suggests that people implicitly associate positive informa-\ntion with the self-face. In other words, people tend to have a positive representation of the self, which\nmay create an overestimation of their own beauty in their memory. Indeed, individuals tend to overes-\ntimate their abilities when asked to compare themselves to another group, as demonstrated in studies\nIn the present study, we first examined the hypothesis that people would remember their faces as\nmore attractive than they would perceive their faces in photographs, whereas their memories of others'\nfaces would be more consistent with the others' real faces. Specifically, we predicted that participants\nwould most likely select a photograph that had not been modified for their friends, but would be more\nlikely to choose a photograph of themselves that has more attractive features. To test this hypothesis,\nwe asked participants to select the real face from a set of photographs of themselves or of their class-\nmates. In Experiment 1, we altered (magnified or shrunk) the size of the eyes, while in Experiment 2,\nwe magnified or shrunk the mouths. We then examined gender differences and the influence of mirror-\nreversed pictures in self-face recognition in Experiment 3.\nResearch has indicated that the eye region has the greater influence on judgments of face beauty than\nThornhill & Gangestad, 1999). Thus, in the first experiment, we adjusted the size of the eyes in photo-\ngraphs to manipulate the perceived beauty of the face. Generally, large eyes are viewed as more attrac-\ntive, especially in women (Cunningham, 1986). Therefore, we predicted that the participants would\nselect more pictures with magnified eyes for themselves than for their classmates.\nMethods\nParticipants\nTen Keio University students (7 females, mean age 5 20.7 years) from the same class participated\nin the experiment. The class was held once per week and had been held for three months before the\nexperiment. The participants were from the same department; thus, they regularly met or encountered\neach other outside the classroom and knew each other relatively well. All participants provided written\nconsent for us to take, process, and reproduce their photographs before participating in the experiment.\nMaterials\nWe took photographs of the participants' faces inside the classroom several weeks before the experi-\nment. For each participant, nine photographs were taken from three angles (i.e., front, left-front side,\nand right-front side), and in front of three different backgrounds (i.e., a white wall, a blackboard, and a\nmonitor). Photographs were edited with Adobe Photoshop CS5.1 using the \"liquefy\" filter. Eyes in the\nphotographs were magnified or shrunk about 5%, 15%, or 20% (i.e.,  3 levels). Thus, seven pictures\nwere made from each photograph, including the unmodified one. We called the seven pictures one set.\nAn example is given in Figure 1 (these pictures were made from a photo of the experimenter and were\nnot used in the experiment). In total, 90 sets of face pictures from the 10 participants were used in the\nexperiment.\nDifferences in face memory for the self and others 178\nProcedure\nParticipants were assessed individually. Before the face recognition task began, participants self-\nreported how photogenic they perceived themselves to be (\"I am not photogenic\") on a Likert-scale\nfrom 1 (strongly agree) to 7 (strongly disagree). In each trial of the face recognition task, four pictures\nrandomly selected from each set were lined up on a 22-inch widescreen monitor (resolution: 1680 \n1050 pixels). The participants were asked to use the mouse to select the photograph that was most like\nthe real face of the subject in the pictures. There were a total of 27 trials, including 9 trials of the self-\nface and 18 trials of the other-face (two sets of each classmate were randomly used). Proportions of the\npresented faces at each modified level were controlled so that they were equal between the self-face\nand the other-face. The trials were presented in random order, and the pictures of the faces lined up on\nthe monitor in a random order. The experiment lasted approximately 10 minutes for each participant.\nResults\nThe selection rates for each type of face picture chosen by the students are given in Figure 2. Angular\ntransformations were applied for analysis. First, we conducted a 2  6 analysis1 of variance (ANOVA:\ntype of face  modification level) to examine the rates of selection. We found a significant main effect\np\n5 0.82), and a significant interaction between\np\np\n5 0.16). For post-hoc analysis, Fisher's LSD test\nwas used to compare the proportion of selections from each condition. The proportion of the self-\nface and the other-face selections were significantly different for the unmodified face (p  0.01)\nand the 5% magnified eyes (p  0.05). The participants were more likely to choose the unmodified\nfaces for their classmates, but selected faces with slightly larger eyes for themselves. Moreover, for\nthe self-face, the selection of the unmodified faces and faces with 5% magnified eyes was signifi-\ncantly higher than other modification levels (p's  0.05), but these two did not differ from each other\n(p 5 0.64). For other faces, the selection of the unmodified faces was greater than all other modifica-\nFurthermore, the participants spent more time on self-face trial (M 5 12.1 s, SD 5 5.5 s) than on\nattention to the self-face than to other faces. Finally, the mean score for the `not photogenic' question\nwas 3.4 (SD 5 1.5). This value was not correlated with selection or reaction time.\nOur proposed hypothesis--that people remember their own faces as being more attractive than\ntheir real face and remember others' faces in a less biased fashion--was supported by the results of\n1No participants selected faces with 20% shrunk eyes (i.e., \u00ad3 level), thus only six modification levels\nwere used in the ANOVA.\nFigure 1. Examples of stimuli used in Experiment 1. The photographs were modified by magnifying or shrinking\nthe eye region by 5%, 15%, or 20%. The participants were asked to select the picture that seemed most like their\nreal face or their classmates' real face. From left to right: (a) face with eye area 10% smaller, (b) unmodified face,\n(c) face with eye area 10% larger. Photographs were taken by the author.\nExperiment 1. For the other-face condition, about 55% of the selections were of unmodified faces,\nwhile the percentage of selections of faces with 5% magnified eyes was 20%, and the selection of\nfaces with 5% shrunken eyes was 17%. This indicates that the participants were able to recognize their\nclassmates' real faces from static photographs in the majority of the trials. However, in the case of the\nself-face, selection of unmodified faces decreased to 35%, and selection of faces with 5% magnified\neyes increased to 32%. Thus, it seems that individuals perceive their eyes as larger than in reality. In\nother words, they perceive their faces as being more attractive. The differences that emerged in face\nrecognition between the self-face and the other-face appear to indicate that memories of the self-face\nand the other-face are distinct. This will be further discussed in the General Discussion.\nAs mentioned previously, empirical results have indicated that people pay more attention to the\nself-face than to the other-face (Devue et al., 2009; Turk et al., 2013). Our findings provide additional\nsupport for this difference in attention as time spent on recognition of the self-face was longer than that\nof the other-face, possibly indicating that the participants studied their own face more carefully than\ntheir classmates' faces. However, the additional attention on the self-face resulted in less accurate face\nrecognition. It may be that excessive attention increased false memory about the self-face.\nOn the other hand, participants may have simply overestimated the size of their facial features,\nrather than their beauty. This may have been the result of viewing their own faces at closer distances.\nFurthermore, it is not clear if memory distortion of the self-face is limited to the eyes or also occurs for\nother parts of the face. Therefore, we manipulated the size of the mouth instead of the eyes in Experi-\nThe mouth region is also an important determinant of facial attractiveness (e.g., Cunningham, 1986;\nKwart et al., 2012; Russell, 2003). For example, small chins are positively correlated with attractive-\nness (Cunningham, 1986; Cunningham, Roberts, & Wu, 1995). Moreover, in traditional Asian cul-\ntures, a small mouth, thin lips, and a small smile are considered highly attractive (Cunningham et al.,\n1995; Dalby, 1983). In Experiment 2, we modified the size of mouth similar to the method used in\nExperiment 1, and once again, we asked participants to select the photograph that looked most like the\nreal face (self or other).\nThe same participants who took part in Experiment 1 took part in Experiment 2. They returned to the\ntesting place approximately two months after the first experiment. Using the original photographs,\nFigure 2.

The procedure was the same as that used in Experiment 1.\nThe selection rates of each type of face picture by the participants are depicted in Figure 3. As in\nExperiment 1, we observed significant differences between memory of the self- and other-faces. The\nresults of a 2  7 ANOVA (type of face  modification level) revealed a significant main effect\np\np\n5 0.67). Most importantly, the interaction between type of face and modification level\np\n5 0.29). Results of post-hoc tests (Fisher's LSD\ntest) showed that selection rates for of the 5% shrunken mouth and unmodified mouth were signifi-\ncantly different between the self- and other-faces (p  0.05, p  0.01, respectively). Participants\nchose the unmodified faces of their classmates more often than they did their own; instead, they tended\nto select faces with the 5% shrunken mouth as their own. Furthermore, for the self-face, selections of\nthe 5% shrunken mouth were significantly higher than any other modification level (p's  0.05). For\nother faces, selections of the unmodified mouth were significantly more than those with other levels\nof modification (p's  0.01). The main effect for type of face showed that the selections for the other-\nface were more than the selections for the self-face, which was a result of angular transformation (the\ntotal selections for all modification levels should be 100% for the self- and other-faces). In addition,\nas in Experiment 1, reaction time in the self-face condition (M 5 9.3 s, SD 5 2.1 s) was significantly\nThe results from Experiment 2 replicated the findings of Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, the unmodi-\nfied faces of classmates were selected in 43% of trials, the unmodified self-faces were selected only\n25% of the time. Moreover, the 5% shrunk mouth photographs were selected for 35% of the self-face\ntrials. We reached two conclusions from the results of Experiment 2: first, individuals do not sim-\nply overestimate the size of their facial features (they underestimated the size of their mouths), and\nsecond, memory distortion of the self-face occurs with other parts of the face.\nPrevious studies have reported gender biases in face recognition. For example, female participants\nrecognized female faces better than male faces (e.g., Cross, Cross, & Daly, 1971; Lewin & Herlitz,\nFigure 3. The rates of selection of the self-face and other-face for each condition in Experiment 2. Error bars\nrepresent standard deviations. Selections of each modification level were compared between the self-face and the\nof beauty may also differ between men and women (e.g., big eyes may be viewed to be attractive for\nthe female face, but not for the male face). Therefore, there are reasons to expect gender differences\nin the bias of self-face recognition. We were unable to examine gender difference in Experiments 1\nand 2 due to the small number of male participants. In Experiment 3, we increased the number male\nparticipants and balanced genders of the other-faces. In addition, we also examined whether a mirror-\nreversed self-face (as one sees in mirror) influenced the self-face recognition bias.\nMethods\nTwenty-two participants (12 females, mean age 5 22.9 years) from Keio University took part in this\nexperiment. They were from the same department as the participants in Experiments 1 and 2, but none\nof them had taken part in the previous two experiments. The participants in this experiment knew each\nother, but were not as well known to each other as the participants in Experiments 1 and 2. Therefore,\nin the present experiment, we defined \"others\" as known people rather than familiar people.\nThe face photographs used in Experiment 1 were also used in this experiment. In addition, we took\nphotographs of four other male students in the same department, which resulted in photographs of\nseven men and seven women. All photographs were edited in Adobe Photoshop CS5 as in Experiment 1\n(eyes magnified or shrunk by 3 levels). These prepared pictures were used in the other-face condi-\ntion. For the self-face condition, face photographs were taken and edited just before the experiment.\nThe self-face pictures were only used with the matched participant. In addition, pictures of mirror-\nreversed self-faces were made of each participant with the same software.\nParticipants performed the experiment individually. Before the task, participants were shown an A-4\nsheet of face photographs used as other-faces were printed (one unedited picture for each person) and\nwere asked to indicate the individuals they did not know. Only pictures of known people were used in\nthe face recognition task.\nFor each participant, nine face photographs were taken, and the experimenter edited the pictures\nwhile the participants waited for about 25 minutes. When the edit was complete, participants returned\nto the experiment room and performed the same face recognition task described in Experiment 1\ntwice. Normal and mirror-reversed pictures of self-face were used in the first and the second session,\nrespectively. There were 36 trials in each session, including 18 self-face and 18 other-face trials. The\nother-face photographs were randomly chosen from known people and proportion of gender was con-\ntrolled. The experiment lasted approximately 1 hour for each participant, including the waiting period.\nResults\nThe rates that men and women selected each type of face picture are given in Figure 4. We applied\na mix-designed 2  2  7 ANOVA (gender of participants  type of faces  modification level)\nto examine gender differences. An angular transformation was applied for the analyses. We found\nsignificant main effects of gender, type of faces, and modification level (F(1, 20) 5 6.52, p  0.05,\np\np\np\ntively), and a significant two-way interaction between type of face and modification level (F(6, 120) 5\np\n5 0.19).

The significant main effect of gender was a result of the angular transforma-\ntion (the total number of selections by men and women was equal before transformation, but, after\ntransformation, the total number of selections by women was more than the total number of selections\nby men). Post-hoc comparisons (Fisher's LSD test) showed that the participants selected more pictures\nwith 5% magnified eyes (p  0.01) and fewer pictures with 15% magnified eyes (p  0.01) for the\nself-face than for the other-face. In addition, we also examined if the gender of other-face influenced\nfacial memory. A mixed-designed 2  2  7 ANOVA (gender of participant  gender of other-face \nDifferences in face memory for the self and others 182\nmodification level) revealed only a significant main effect of modification level (F(6, 120) 5 39.66,\np\n5 0.66) but no any significant interaction. In summary, neither the gender of participants\nnor the gender of other-face interacted with other factors (i.e., type of faces, modification level).\nFurthermore, we applied the same ANOVA (gender of participant  type of faces  modification\nlevel) to the results of the mirror-reversed session (Figure 5) and found almost the same results as the\nfirst session. Specifically, we found main effect of type of faces and main effect modification level,\nand a significant two-way interaction between type of faces and modification level (F(1, 20) 5 60.37,\np\np\np\nrespectively). Moreover, we added the factor of session into the above ANOVA to examine the effect\nof session (normal vs. mirror-reversed); neither the main effect of session nor any interaction between\nsession and other factors was significant, revealing that mirror-reversed pictures did not influence face\nrecognition. In fact, none of the participants reported noticing that mirror-reversed pictures were pre-\nsented in the second session when asked after the experiment.\nIn this experiment, we examined influences of gender and mirror-reversed pictures on the observed\nbias in self-face recognition; neither gender nor mirror-reversed pictures affected recognition of the\nFigure 4.

Although some previous studies have reported gender biases in face recogni-\n2007; Wright & Sladden, 2003) and features influencing beauty might differ between women and men,\nwe did not observe any gender difference in the memory distortion in self-face memory. Both women\nand men selected more pictures with 5% magnified eyes for themselves than for other people, and the\ngender of the other-face did not influence recognition.\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, there is possibility that because we view our faces in a mirror\nand faces are flipped horizontally in photographs, they appear different. We examined this and found\nthat the answer was \"not true.\" None of the participants noticed the presentation of mirror-reversed\npictures, and showing mirror-reversed pictures did not influence their recognition. This is probably\nbecause people are very familiar with their self-face in both mirrors and photographs. As shown in\na previous study, people's ability to recognize whether their own face is mirror-reversed or not is no\nbetter than their ability to recognize others' mirror-reversed faces (Br\u00e9dart, 2003). Although the dif-\nference between the dynamic face in the mirror and the static face in a photograph might influence\nattractiveness, left and right reversal does not.\nThe results from Experiment 3 differ from those of Experiment 1 in two ways. First, selections on\nunmodified pictures were equal for self- and the other-faces in this experiment, but less for self than\nother in Experiment 1. Second, the selection of pictures with 15% magnified eyes was less for self than\nfor others in this experiment, but was the same in Experiment 1. These differences may have arisen\ndue to the differences in participants and procedures. In Experiment 1, all the participants were in the\nsame small-class lecture and were very familiar with each other. In contrast, the participants in Experi-\nment 3 were from the same department but in different years; they knew each other, but were not that\nfamiliar with the others in the photographs, resulting in poorer performance in face recognition of the\nother-faces. Furthermore, photographs of the self-face were taken just before the experimental task in\nExperiment 3, possibly resulting in better accuracy in self-face recognition than in Experiment 1. How-\never, the result that significantly more faces with 15% magnified eyes was selected for other people\nthan selected for self was still somewhat surprising. This suggests that people may be more generous\nwith unfamiliar people. Future research should be conducted on this issue.\nTo confirm that the size of eyes and mouth influences attractiveness for both Japanese men and women,\nwe asked students who did not know the participants of Experiments 1, 2, and 3 to select the most\nattractive face from pictures with different sizes of eyes or mouths.\nMethods\nParticipants\nTwenty students from the University of Tokyo and the Chuo University participated in Experiment 4.\nTen students (5 females, mean age 5 22.5) participated in the investigation on attractiveness of faces\nwith different sized eyes, and the others (5 females, mean age 5 26.0) participated in the investigation\non attractiveness of different sized mouths. None of these participants knew the participants of the\nprevious experiments and were na\u00efve to the purpose of the experiment.\nMaterials and Procedure\nThe other-face photographs in Experiment 3 were used. All photographs were edited in Adobe Pho-\ntoshop CS5 as in Experiment 1 (eyes magnified or shrunk by 3 levels) and Experiment 2 (mouths\nmagnified or shrunk by 3 levels). In each trial, seven pictures with different sized eyes (the first\ninvestigation) or mouth (the second investigation) were randomly presented on a monitor, and partici-\npants were asked to select the most attractive one using a mouse. For each other-face subject, three sets\nof photographs were used randomly. Each participant did 42 trials (3 sets  14 subjects).\nResults\nThe proportions of face selections of pictures of women and men with different sized eyes are given\nin Figure 6(a).

The results clearly showed that large eyes and small mouths were viewed\nas more attractive, especially in women, in Japanese culture. Therefore, when people selected pictures\nwith larger eyes or smaller mouths for the self-face, they were remembering their own faces as more\nattractive than their real face.\n6 General Discussion\nThe results from Experiment 1 and 2 provided clear evidence that there are differences in face memory\nfor the self and others. Specifically, participants were able to recognize the unmodified faces of their\nclassmates, but tended to choose the modified pictures (with larger eyes and smaller mouths) of their\nown faces. As confirmed in Experiment 4, larger eyes and smaller mouths are considered to be more\nattractive in Asian cultures; therefore, these results may be interpreted to mean that people think of\nthemselves as more attractive than they really are. This may also provide an explanation for why\nmany individuals think they are not photogenic: when people see their photographs--an unmodified\nview--they compare it to their memorized face, and the resulting incongruence is attributed to a poor\nphotograph or being \"not photogenic.\"\nHerein, we have proposed several possible reasons for the memory distortions of the self-face. The\nmemory distortions we observed may be the result of over-attention to the self-face. Indeed, previous\nwork has indicated that self-reference stimuli, including faces, hold attention more than other stimuli\n(e.g., Devue et al., 2009; Turk et al., 2013). After the experiments, the participants reported that the\nself-face trials were easier to do than the other-face trials, but they took longer during these trials.\nAlthough the participants made more cautious decisions during the self-face trials, their recognitions\nwere less accurate. Therefore, it may be that too much attention and overexposure to the self-face\nFigure 6. The rates of selection of the most attractive face from pictures with different sizes of eyes (a) or different\nsizes of mouth (b) for women and men. Error bars represent standard deviations.\nmay result in the subjective expectation of being more attractive. In addition, as reported by prior\nresearchers, people implicitly associate positive information to the self-face (Ma & Han, 2010, 2012).\nThus, during the long retention interval of the self-face, positive information (e.g., beauty, attractive-\nness) associated with the self may unconsciously distort an individual's self-representation and lead\nto inaccurate face recognition. In addition, the positive biases of self-face recognition might not be\nspecific for self-face recognition; it might also apply to the faces of people to whom we are strongly\nattached. Future research should be conducted on this issue.\nFurthermore, previous research has demonstrated that holistic processing leads to better face\nrecognition than featural processing (e.g., Schooler & Engstler-Schooler, 1990; Schooler, 2002). In\nresearch examining self-face processing relative to familiar face processing, featural processes have\nbeen demonstrated to contribute to the self-face recognition (e.g., Greenberg & Goshen-Gottstein,\nthe recognition of self-, friend-, and stranger-faces, and concluded that the representation of one's own\nface emphasizes both global and local information. From the results of these studies we infer that the\nfeatural processing of the eyes (or the mouth) in this study was influenced by positive beliefs about self.\nWe also examined the interaction between gender and bias in self-face memory, but did not observe\nany gender differences. Both women and men chose slightly magnified eyes for the self-face more\noften than for others. As shown in Figure 6(a), although large eyes were preferred more in women than\nmen, this feature was correlated with attractiveness for both genders. In conclusion, both females and\nmales remember their own faces as being more attractive than their real face.\nWe also examined the influence of mirror-reversed pictures on self-face recognition and found that\nthe photograph selections were not influenced by mirror-reversals self-faces. The participants reported\nnot noticing the difference in the mirror-reversed photographs. Clearly, mirror-reversal is not the rea-\nson of why faces look different in photographs and mirrors.\nIn conclusion, we found a bias in self-face recognition. Participants selected the more attractive,\nmodified pictures for the self-face condition than for the other-face condition. This phenomenon did\nnot differ across gender and indicated a memory distortion (i.e., overevaluation) of the self-face and\noffered some insight about how people think about the self.\nReferences\nBr\u00e9dart, S.
