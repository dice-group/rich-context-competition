IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that has been shown to increase with age.\nMethods. Plasma IL-6 was measured by ELISA in 1,727 community-dwelling elderly subjects whose blood was\ndrawn during the third in-person survey of the Duke Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly\n(EPESE). Demographics, functional status (disability), and disease states were determined. Correlations of these fac-\ntors with IL-6 were analyzed with Spearman's Rho while differences between groups were assessed by Wilcoxon test.\nResults. IL-6 levels were higher with age (p = .0001) even in this older population (>70 years). There was a positive\ncorrelation between IL-6 and functional disability for each of the functional status measures (p = .0001), as well as a\ncorrelation between self-rated health and IL-6. Significantly higher median levels of IL-6 were found in subjects re-\nporting prevalent cancer, heart attack, and high blood pressure, but not diabetes or arthritis. The association between\nage and functional status with high IL-6 remained when all other variables were controlled, in multivariable analysis.\nConclusions. This association between increased plasma IL-6 levels and functional status suggests that dysregula-\ntion of IL-6 may be related to the functional disability seen with aging, and that IL-6 may be useful as a component of\nan overall marker of health.\nrT\"'HERE is a growing body of evidence that a network of\nA cytokines plays an important role in the regulation of a\nvariety of physiologic functions (1,2). IL-6 is one such cy-\ntokine that has been shown to be multifunctional in nature\nbut whose main.role appears to be the induction of the\nacute inflammatory response and the induction of B-lym-\nphocyte proliferation and differentiation (3,4). It also ap-\npears to play a role in the regulation of protease inhibitors\nand modulation of bone resorption (5).\nUnder usual circumstances, in the absence of an inflam-\nmatory condition, expression of IL-6 appears to be tightly\nregulated, with very little IL-6 detectable in plasma. IL-6\nhas been reported to be elevated in a number of age-related\ndiseases such as B-cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma,\nAlzheimer's disease, and osteoporosis (6). However, a\nnumber of studies have now demonstrated that, with in-\ncreasing age in both animals and humans (7-14), IL-6 in-\ncreased to measurable levels even in the absence of signifi-\ncant disease. This has led to the suggestion that IL-6 is \"a\ncytokine for gerontologists\" (15), which may be related to\nsome of the manifestations of aging in addition to the\nemergence of some age-related diseases. These previous\nstudies, however, involved small numbers of subjects and\nhave precluded further exploration of possible factors asso-\nciated with the emergence of detectable IL-6 in elderly in-\ndividuals, or disorders caused by or resulting from it.\nIn this study, we had the opportunity to measure IL-6 lev-\nels in more than 1,700 subjects in a community-based popu-\nlation of diverse racial and gender composition, as part of\nthe Duke Established Populations for Epidemiologic Stud-\nies of the Elderly (EPESE), concomitant with extensive col-\nlection of survey information on demographic, social,\nhealth, and functional conditions (16-18). This has allowed\nmore detailed analysis of the relationship between the level\nof IL-6 with age, sex, race, self-reported medical condi-\ntions, and functional status in the largest community-based\nsample of this type. We confirm the finding that IL-6 contin-\nues to increase with age even in people over 70, and is asso-\nciated with some specific disease states. We demonstrate for\nthe first time a specific association with measures of func-\ntional status (i.e., personal self-care activities). These obser-\nvations have implications for our understanding of the role\nof such cytokines in aging and the diseases of old age.\nMETHODS\nSubject Population\nOur subjects were from the Duke component of the\nNIA-funded study of the Established Populations for Epi-\ndemiologic Studies of the Elderly. The populations of both\nthe overall four-site study and the Duke study have been\ndescribed in detail (16-19). Briefly, the Duke study en-\n1986, selected on the basis of random household sampling\nin a five-county area, including and adjacent to Durham,\nNorth Carolina. The sample was selected specifically to\nallow for comparison by racial groups. The initial in-person\nsurvey included extensive information in many spheres in-\neluding: cognitive and functional status, nutrition, depres-\nsion, life satisfaction, exercise, social interactions and func-\ntioning, presence of chronic health conditions, and drug and\nmedical care use. In each following year, either a telephone\nor in-person follow-up survey was conducted. At the third\nin-person survey in 1992, or year 6 of the study, blood sam-\nples were drawn for a variety of routine hematologic and\nblood chemistry determinations. In addition, a separate\nsample was drawn for a substudy of inflammatory and co-\nagulation factors. IL-6 measurements were performed from\nthis sample. This survey collected information on the same\nspheres as the initial in-person survey, using several scales\nmeasuring functional health status, defined as the level at\nwhich a person performs the tasks and roles of daily life\n(20). Information from several scales indicating levels of\nfunctional status are reported because they measure differ-\nent aspects of function, thus in aggregate providing a com-\nprehensive view. The Katz ADL (activities of daily living)\nmeasures activities such as bathing, toileting, dressing, eat-\ning, and grooming; the Rosow-Breslau Scale measures\ndoing heavy housework, walking up a flight of stairs, and\nwalking one-half mile; and the Nagi Scale measures ability\nto extend arms above shoulder level, manipulate small ob-\njects, stoop, crouch or kneel, and push a large object (20).\nThe Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADL)\nassesses ability to do more integrative functions such as\nusing the telephone, traveling, shopping, and doing house-\nwork (21). In addition, self-reports of disease status, and\nquestions pertaining to life satisfaction and self-rated health\nwere recorded as previously described in detail (19).\nAt the time of the blood draw, 2,569 interviews were\nconducted with the living members of the cohort (or their\nproxies), all of whom were at least 70 years of age. Among\nthose interviewed, 67% had a successful blood draw\n(1,727) and are the subjects of this report. Those not having\nblood drawn were either unable to give consent, generally\nbecause of cognitive dysfunction (269), or refused to have\nblood drawn, were unavailable, or technically could not be\ndrawn (573). There were significant differences (p < .05)\namong the three groups: blood drawn, unable to consent,\nand refusers respectively as follows (means): age (71.6,\nable to give consent were significantly more functionally\nand cognitively impaired, whereas those not having blood\ndrawn for other reasons were somewhat older, slightly\nmore cognitively impaired, and more functionally impaired\nthan the sample studied. This could have imposed some de-\ngree of a ceiling on the relationships reported here.\nLaboratory Methods for Measurement of IL-6\nBlood was collected in EDTA-containing vacutainer\ntubes, placed on ice and taken to the laboratory, where it\nwas centrifuged immediately to separate the plasma, which\nwas promptly frozen at -70 \u00b0C in 0.5 ml aliquots. Plasma\nIL-6 was measured by ELISA; the minimal detectable level\nwas .35 pg/ml (Quantikine, R&D systems, Minneapolis,\nMN) (22). The laboratory performing the IL-6 assays was\nblinded to functional and health status of the subjects. We\nhave previously used this assay to conduct a pilot study of\nthe variability of plasma IL-6 over time in elderly subjects,\nand it showed a high degree of reliability and reproducibil-\nity (23). For example, that analysis demonstrated that the\nintraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for one measure-\nment of IL-6 in 8 blood samples from an individual over a\nperiod of 36 days was .87, indicating that a single sample\nfrom a subject is quite representative of that individual's\nIL-6 level over an extended period of time.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe relationship of IL-6 with demographic variables,\nhealth behaviors, functioning, hypertension, depression,\nsmoking, and self-report disease was assessed. In an initial\nanalysis, those with a valid blood draw were compared with\nthose unable to give consent and those who refused blood\ndrawn or were unavailable across the demographic and func-\ntional variables as defined above. Differences between the\nthree groups were tested by analysis of variance (ANOVA).\nAll analyses were performed using the Statistical Analysis\nSystem (SAS).\nIn the next set of analyses, the relationship of IL-6 with the\nindependent variables of interest was assessed. In this data\nset, IL-6 demonstrated a heavily right skewed distribution\nassess the significance, we therefore used methods not sensi-\ntive to outliers and skew: Spearman's Rho for continuous\nvariables and Friedman's or Wilcoxon's test for discrete vari-\nables, and parametric techniques for the log of IL-6 (a linear\ntransformation which brought about near normality of the\nIL-6 distribution). Discrete levels for each of the continuous\nindicators were defined. For each level of each of these inde-\npendent variables, three statistics were calculated: percent\nabove 5 pg/ml (approximately highest 10% and the approxi-\nmate breakpoint in the cumulative distribution curves -- See\nFigure 1), median, and mean log (IL-6). For the median val-\nIL6 Level (pg/ml)\nFigure 1. Distribution of IL-6 values.\nues presented, tests of significance were performed by the\nWilcoxon or Friedman's test. Goodness-of-fit chi-square was\nused to assess the relationship of high IL-6 and group mem-\nbership, and differences between log values between groups\nwere assessed by ANOVA.\nBased on these results, we derived multivariable esti-\nmates of the effect of health, function, and demographic\nvariables on IL-6. Two models were tested. First, to assess\nwhich factors were related to extreme levels of IL-6 (IL-6\n> 5 pg/ml), a forward stepwise logistic regression was per-\nformed relating extreme IL-6 to the predictors of interest.\nSecond, since IL-6 showed such extreme skew, we analyzed\nthe normalized IL-6 (log transformed) and related the log of\nIL-6 to the predictors of interest by a forward stepwise re-\ngression. In all models, the demographic variables age, sex,\nand race were forced into the final regression equation.\nRESULTS\nFigure 1 demonstrates the distribution of Plasma IL-6\nlevels in the entire population studied. As can be seen, IL-6\nwas detectable in most subjects. The mean and median val-\nues for the entire population were 2.98 pg/ml and 1.7\npg/ml, respectively. The values are not uniformly dis-\npg/ml. Values above 10 pg/ml ranged as high as 201 pg/ml\nin a few instances. Because the small number of subjects\nwith extremely high values (or outliers) can disproportion-\nately influence mean values, especially when relatively\nsmall numbers of subjects fall in a particular comparison\ngroup, median values are utilized for statistical compar-\nisons between groups; and in order to normalize the distri-\nbution, a log transformation of IL-6 was performed.\nThere is no significant difference in IL-6 values among\nthe various sex and racial groups. This is indicated in Table\n1 where, regardless of whether assessing mean and median\nvalues or percentage levels > 5 pg/ml, non-Blacks and\nTable 1.

As\nthis table shows, age was strongly correlated with IL-6 lev-\nels, both when assessing the median for the three age groups\nand the percentage of values > 5 pg/ml. In additional analy-\nses, the Spearman correlation between age and IL-6 is .13\n(p = < .0001). The age relationship holds for both males and\nfemales in this elderly subject sample (p = < .0001). More-\nover, age correlates with increasing IL-6 levels for both\nracial groups of both sexes (p = < .0001) (Figure 2). The\nfinal demographic variable assessed, urban/rural status, was\nnot associated with increasing IL-6 levels.\nTable 2 shows the bivariate analysis of relationships be-\ntween IL-6 and the measures of health status. The strongest\nbivariate correlations were with the measures of functional\nstatus. Regardless of whether functional status was assessed\nby the Katz ADL, Rosow-Breslau Scale, or Nagi Scale, or\nby measure of instrumental ADLs, poor functional status\nwas associated with progressively increasing IL-6 levels\n(p = < .0001). Assessing general measures of health status,\nIL-6 levels were correlated with self-rated health, rising\nprogressively from the best rated health states through the\npoorest assessed health. There was also an association, but\na much weaker one, with life satisfaction.\nAmong the health conditions that were assessed in the\nEPESE (Table 3), a history of cancer overall was not asso-\nciated with high IL-6 values, though the number with levels\n> 5 pg/ml was higher. This relationship may be clouded by\nthe fact that this represents a history of cancer at any time\nand thus the activity of the cancer is uncertain. No individ-\nual cancer type was associated with elevated levels of IL-6,\nalthough in several, the number of cases is quite small (p >\n0.4 in all cases). On the other hand, a history of current\ncigarette smoking was associated with elevated IL-6 levels\nas was a history of heart attack. A history of high blood\npressure was associated while stroke and diabetes were not.\nInterestingly, a history of arthritis was not associated with\nelevated IL-6 levels nor was a history of broken bone. A\nhistory of a broken hip was weakly associated. In order to\naddress the issue of active vs inactive disease, the relation-\nship of IL-6 levels with the report of disease occurring\nAge Group\nRace & Sex Qroup: 1-WhKs Mala 2-Black Male\n3-White Female 4-Black Female\nFigure 2.

Although the\ncase numbers are smaller, there is again no relationship for\ncancer, stroke, and broken bones and only weak relation-\nships for hip fracture and heart attack.\nTable 5 shows the multivariate analysis for both IL-6 > 5\npg/ml and for IL-6 levels. When controlling for all other\nvariables, age remains independently associated with in-\ncreased IL-6 values in both analyses. Current cigarette\nsmoking is consistently an independent predictor of ele-\nvated IL-6 as is functional status by both Nagi and Katz as-\nsessment. Cancer and high blood pressure show indepen-\ndent relationships, but these associations are weaker than\nthose for age or functional status. In models for IL-6 values\n> 5 pg/ml, female sex was negatively associated with IL-6\ndespite not having been associated in the bivariate analyses.\nThis occurred because age acted as a confounder. Thus\nwomen tended to have lower IL-6 levels but also tended to\nbe older (associated with higher IL-6 levels). Only when\nage was controlled is the sex effect noted. The other demo-\ngraphic variables, race and rural status, are shown but were\nTable 3.

The consistency of\nthis elevation for both sexes and across racial lines, and the\nconsistency of the level of elevation with previous studies,\nsuggest that a primary aberration in IL-6 production may\nplay a prominent role in the increased values. This is con-\nsistent with recent work in mice where the administration\nof dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or dietary restriction,\nresulting in enhanced longevity, also reversed the increase\nof IL-6 seen during aging (8,9).\nPrevious studies using small numbers of subjects have\nshown increased levels of IL-6 in elderly, compared with\nyounger subjects, in whom IL-6 is generally not detectable\n(12-15). This increase in IL-6 with age has been shown\nboth for plasma levels as well as mononuclear cell produc-\ntion, and in humans as well as mice and primates (8,9,15).\nThis has led to suggestions that a dysregulation of IL-6 ex-\npression occurs with age, predisposing individuals to a\nnumber of age-associated diseases with which IL-6 activa-\ntion may play a role. These include cancer, in particular\nB-cell neoplasms, and disorders of bone resorption (5,6).\nThese studies, however, have involved too few subjects in\nthe elderly age range to allow for robust analysis of such\npossible relationships and, in particular, to assess the inde-\npendent relationship of age vs other disease states and dis-\norders of aging in order to provide the clues to the nature of\nthe IL-6 relationship. Our study, comprising a large number\nof older subjects, provides support for the concept that even\nin older age groups (> 70), IL-6 levels are associated with\nincreasing age, even apart from a number of age-associated\ndiseases and disorders.\nWe report for the first time a relationship of measures of\nfunction (as well as self-rated health) with elevated IL-6\nlevels. That these measures of function are related to IL-6\nindependently, and to a much greater degree than any of the\nindividual diseases, suggests a primary dysregulation. This\nis, of course, limited by the fact that specific disease infor-\nmation is based on self-report only. Our findings suggest\nalso that IL-6 and potentially related cytokine networks\nmay play an important role in how older persons feel and\nfunction. It has been pointed out previously that some of\nthe phenomena that IL-6 and related cytokines, such as\nIL-1, produce may include fatigue, mediated through ef-\nfects on the pituitary/adrenal axis (24,25). This has led to\nthe hypothesis that a variety of stressors (or in this case,\naging per se) could trigger IL-1 or IL-6 production which\ncould then produce fatigue -- or even chronic fatigue syn-\ndrome (26). It would be reasonable to speculate that in\nolder persons with increased IL-6 levels, feelings of fatigue\nor decreased energy could result in lower self-ratings of\nhealth and a lower sense of life satisfaction. This might per-\nhaps also decrease their ability to perform functionally. The\nlatter might be mediated by decreased motivation or by ac-\ntual changes in hormonal and other biological factors that\ncould directly reduce energy levels. In a subsequent study,\nwe plan to assess the relationship of IL-6 and other inflam-\nmatory markers in this population with psychologic factors\nand other biochemical markers.\nWe had hypothesized that increased IL-6 would be asso-\nciated with diseases common in old age as a marker of on-\ngoing subclinical inflammation. Previous studies in several\ncancers had indicated increased IL-6 production by mono-\ncytes in head and neck cancer (27) and elevated serum IL-6\nlevels in Hodgkins disease and other malignancies (28). We\nwere surprised, therefore, to see the relative lack of overall\nassociation with disorders such as cancer and arthritis\nwhich might logically have fallen into that category. Can-\ncer, however, was associated with some of the very ele-\nvated values in the sample, suggesting that with active dis-\nease, the level may be increased and that the numbers of\nspecific cancers, e.g. lymphomas, myeloma, head and neck,\nwith which etiologic associations have been postulated,\nmay simply have been too small to detect independent as-\nsociations. The lack of a relationship with self-report of\narthritis is also unexplained. Previous studies in arthritis\nhave shown an increase (29) or normal levels (30) of serum\nIL-6. Our results are consistent with the latter report. How-\never, our data are limited in that we did not have measures\nof the specific type or severity of disease. Thus, it is likely\nthat most of the arthritis reported in our sample is os-\nteoarthritis which, because of the age range of the subjects,\nmay represent largely \"burned out\" disease which is not\nproducing a major stimulus to the inflammatory response.\nMoreover, our data on specific diseases are limited in that\nthey are obtained by self-report and may not as accurately\nrepresent disease status as a clinical exam.\nThere were positive associations with smoking and\nsmoking-related disorders such as heart attack and hyper-\ntension, and to a lesser extent, stroke. It is possible that\nsuch relationships are mediated through the now generally\nTable 5. Final Multivariable Estimates\nA.

Such interactions\nmay also play a role in affecting functional status. In a pre-\nvious study of a subcohort drawn from the EPESE for the\nMacArthur study of successful aging, we demonstrated sig-\nnificant relationships between indicators of subclinical al-\ntered inflammatory and coagulation status (reduced A/G\nratio and elevated D-dimer levels), and functional decline\n(measured by ADL and IADL), particularly in elderly\nBlack women (32). In future analyses of the full EPESE co-\nhort, we will be able to explore the relationship of func-\ntional decline and alterations of coagulation status as\nmarked by levels of circulating fibrin D-dimers.\nOn the basis of studies in mice, it has been suggested that\nIL-6 is involved in bone resorption and thus might play a\nrole in osteoporosis etiology. Recent human studies have\nconfirmed elevated levels after menopause, but a lack of cor-\nrelation with bone density (33). In that study, the authors also\nfailed to find a relationship between age and IL-6 in the post-\nmenopausal women. It is likely that this was due to the small\nsample size, as our study clearly shows a relationship of age\nwith IL-6 even in women long post-menopausal. In another\nrecent study, there was also a strong age relationship over the\n20- through 90-year range with no specific influence of\nmenopausal status (34). However, there was no correlation\nwith markers of bone turnover and no correlation with osteo-\nporosis (35). Consistent with these reports, we did not find an\nindependent relationship of IL-6 with hip fracture or other\nfractures cross-sectionally. However, we did not have data on\nbone mineral density or estimates of osteoporosis diagnoses.\nMoreover, since plasma levels represent the sum of IL-6 pro-\nduced from a wide range of sources, it is certainly possible\nthat IL-6 levels are much higher in the microenvironment of\nbone in osteoporosis or arthritis, or neoplastic tissue in the\ncase of cancer, and play important roles in the pathogenesis\nof such diseases without elevating the plasma IL-6.\nThis study has a number of limitations. It must be empha-\nsized that this is a report of cross-sectional data. IL-6 levels\nand age, functional status and other variables were simulta-\nneously determined. Thus, we cannot be certain of any\ncause-and-effect relationship between the associations\nnoted. Moreover, while the independent associations re-\nported are strongly statistically significant, the order of mag-\nnitude of the absolute differences in IL-6 with age or func-\ntional status is modest and must represent only a portion of\nthe variance. The elevated levels of IL-6 reported are gener-\nally not at the levels seen in active clinical disease. In fact,\nas an epidemiologic study, the associations reported should\nbe taken as suggesting clues to possible biological and phys-\niologic relationships, with stronger evidence of causality to\ncome from future longitudinal studies.\nIn summary, IL-6 levels appear to be associated indepen-\ndently with aging and functional status. This large-scale\nstudy of older persons identifies these associations and\nshows that the presence of proinflammatory cytokines can\nbe demonstrated in a large proportion of this population.\nThe pathophysiologic correlates of IL-6 activation and the\nconsequences of that activation are being explored in man\n(2,6). Because functional status has been shown to correlate\nstrongly with subsequent survival, it is possible that IL-6\nmay be a good marker of such outcomes as well (36). Sub-\nsequent follow-up of this population should allow us to as-\nsess this prospectively.\nOur studies suggest that cytokines such as IL-6 may be\nplaying an important role in mediating the aging process\nand relationships between that process and functional out-\ncomes. Our demonstration of these associations suggests\nthe potential of using IL-6 as an intermediate outcome\nmarker in studies of interventions to alter age-related bio-\nlogic function. The use of anti-IL-6 antibodies, and other\napproaches to inhibit the activity of this cytokine have been\nsuggested for therapeutic use (37,38). It would be of great\ninterest in future trials to determine if inhibition of this cy-\ntokine can slow or reverse the functional decline associated\nwith aging and age-related diseases.\n"
