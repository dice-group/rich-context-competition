We also examined whether these associations were modified by race/\nethnicity. Associations were tested in linear and logistic regression models adjusting for sociodemographics, reproductive factors,\ncardiovascular risk factors, and medications. Women were on average aged 60 years and 255 women reported a history of an\nadverse pregnancy outcome. In fully adjusted models, history of PTB was associated with higher BP (systolic: b=6.40; SE, 1.62\nassociated with lower intima-media thickness, but not after excluding women with prevalent hypertension. There were no\nsignificant associations with other subclinical vascular measures.\nConclusions---Findings suggest that history of PTB is associated with higher BP and mean arterial pressure in late midlife. Adverse\npregnancy outcomes were not significantly related to subclinical cardiovascular disease when excluding women with prevalent\nhypertension.

Also, most are conducted in racially/ethnically homo-\ngeneous populations.18 Although racial/ethnic disparities\nexist in rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes and CVD,19,20\nracial differences in the association between adverse preg-\nnancy outcomes and future risk of CVD has not been fully\nexplored.16,21 Furthermore, while the risk of CVD increases\nsubstantially after menopause,22 few studies have examined\nwhether adverse pregnancy outcomes earlier in life influence\nNoninvasive measures of subclinical vascular disease\nincluding ultrasound assessment of carotid intima-media\nthickness (IMT) and plaque burden and pulse wave velocity\n(PWV) measures of arterial stiffness are surrogate markers of\narteriosclerosis and predictors of future cardiovascular\nevents.25,26 No studies have examined the impact of adverse\npregnancy outcomes on subclinical CVD in late midlife, when\nsubclinical disease significantly progresses.27 Elevated blood\npressure (BP) is a critical risk factor for subclinical CVD in\nmidlife.28 Recent data suggest that adverse pregnancy\noutcomes are associated with subsequent elevations in BP,\nand that BP may mediate associations between adverse\npregnancy outcomes and future CVD.24,29 Yet, prior studies\ndid not consider whether these associations persist after\nwomen transition through menopause. Therefore, the purpose\nof the present analysis was to assess associations of adverse\npregnancy outcomes (ie, PTB, small-for-gestational-age infant,\nstillbirth) with BP, mean arterial pressure, and various indices\nof subclinical CVD in a large cohort of multiethnic women in\nlate midlife. In doing so, we also sought to examine whether\nBP may be a potential pathway linking adverse pregnancy\noutcomes to subclinical CVD in late midlife. A secondary aim\nwas to determine whether associations between adverse\npregnancy outcomes and subclinical CVD were modified by\nrace/ethnicity. A better understanding of the relationship\nbetween adverse pregnancy outcomes and cardiovascular\nhealth may lead to early identification of women at excess risk\nfor CVD later in life.\nMethods\nTransparency and Reproducibility\nSWAN (Study of   provides\naccess to public use data sets that extend through the tenth\nannual follow-up visit. Some, but not all, of the data used for\nthis manuscript are contained in the SWAN public use data\nsets.30 Investigators who require assistance accessing the\npublic use data set may contact the SWAN Coordinating\nCenter.\nStudy Participants\nSWAN is an ongoing longitudinal, multiethnic study of the\nbiological and psychosocial changes that occur during the\nmenopause transition. Details of the study design and\nrecruitment have been described elsewhere.31 Briefly,\nearly perimenopausal women aged 42 to 52 years were\nenrolled at 1 of 7 research sites in Detroit, MI; Boston, MA;\nChicago, IL; Oakland, CA; Los Angeles, CA; Newark, NJ; and\nPittsburgh, PA. Baseline eligibility criteria for SWAN included:\n(1) an intact uterus and at least 1 ovary; (2) menstrual\nbleeding within the prior 3 months; (3) no current pregnancy\nor breastfeeding; and (4) no usage of reproductive hormones\nwithin the prior 3 months. Each site enrolled non-Hispanic\nwhite women and women who self-identified as 1 of 4 other\npredetermined racial/ethnic groups (black women in Detroit,\nBoston, Chicago, and Pittsburgh; Japanese women in Los\nAngeles; Chinese women in Oakland; and Hispanic women in\nNewark). Participants were assessed through a standardized\nClinical Perspective\nWhat Is New?\n\u00b7 In a multiethnic population-based study of women in late\nmidlife, history of a preterm birth was significantly associ-\nated with higher blood pressure (BP) and mean arterial\npressure, extending previous findings in premenopausal\nwomen.\n\u00b7 Even when excluding women with a history of hypertensive\ndisorders of pregnancy, a prior preterm birth was associated\nwith more adverse BP indices.\n\u00b7 History of adverse pregnancy outcomes (preterm birth,\nsmall for gestational age, stillbirth) were not significantly\nrelated to subclinical cardiovascular disease when excluding\nwomen with prevalent hypertension.\nWhat Are the Clinical Implications?\n\u00b7 Findings suggest that women with a history of preterm\nbirth exhibited a 6.4-mm Hg higher systolic BP and a 3.2-\nmm Hg higher diastolic BP compared with women with all\nterm births. These data are clinically significant given that\na 2-mm Hg increment in systolic BP has been associated\nwith a 7% increase in mortality from coronary artery\ndisease and a 10% increase in mortality from stroke.\n\u00b7 Pregnancy history may help identify women who would\nbenefit from cardiovascular risk assessment and modifica-\ntion. Proper monitoring and management of BP is warranted\nfor women with a preterm birth.\nPregnancy Outcomes and Late Midlife Blood Pressure Cort\nes et al\nhttp://jaha.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nLos Angeles) assessed subclinical CVD using carotid ultra-\nsound and PWV tests at visit 12 or visit 13.\nEligible women for the current analyses were those with at\nleast 1 birth and who underwent a carotid scan or PWV\nhistory questionnaire. Of these, 1854 provided information on\n1 or more births (n=395 nulliparous). After excluding women\nwithout subclinical cardiovascular assessment at visits 12 or\n13 (n=609) and those for whom small-for-gestational-age\nbirth could not be determined because of missing birth weight\nanalysis. The institutional review boards at each study site\napproved the SWAN protocols. Each participant provided\nwritten informed consent.\nExposure Variables\nThe primary exposure variables were reported history of PTB,\nterm small-for-gestational-age birth, and stillbirth. History of\nadverse pregnancy outcomes were assessed using a detailed\ninterviewer-administered pregnancy history questionnaire at\nSWAN visit 13 that collected information on number of births,\nbirth outcomes (livebirth versus stillbirth), gestational age at\ndelivery, and birth weight for each delivery. Interviews were\nconducted in the clinic/office, over the telephone, or in the\nrespondent's home. Reported history of PTB was defined as a\nprior delivery at <37 completed weeks of gestation. A term\nsmall-for-gestational-age birth (birthweight <10th percentile\nfor 37 weeks' gestational age) was determined using the\nWorld Health Organization weight percentile calculator,32\nwhich uses a customized standard based on the sample mean\nbirthweight at 40 weeks' gestation.33 A history of stillbirth\nwas considered as any pregnancy loss at 20 weeks'\ngestation. Studies have shown high sensitivity (>0.90) and\npredictive validity for maternal recall of preterm delivery,\nsmall-for-gestational-age birth, and pregnancy loss.34,35\nWomen were categorized as having no adverse pregnancy\noutcomes, a single PTB, a term small-for-gestational-age birth,\na stillbirth, or multiple (>1) adverse pregnancy outcomes.\nWomen with a preterm small-for-gestational-age birth (n=4),\nwhich was defined as birthweight <10th percentile for\n<37 weeks' gestational age, were included in the multiple\nadverse pregnancy outcome group.\nOutcome Variables\nBlood pressure\nBP measures in this analysis were collected at the time the\ncarotid ultrasound was performed. BP was measured accord-\ning to a standardized protocol, with readings taken on the\nright arm, with the respondent seated and feet flat on the\nfloor for at least 5 minutes before measurement.27 The\nappropriate cuff size was determined based on arm circum-\nference. A standard mercury sphygmomanometer was used to\nrecord systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) at the first and\nfifth phase Korotkoff sounds. Respondents had not smoked or\nconsumed any caffeinated beverages within 30 minutes of BP\nmeasurement. The average of 2 sequential BP values, with a\nminimum 2-minute rest period between measures, was\nrecorded. Using the average of these 2 sequential BP values,\nwe calculated mean arterial pressure with a standard\nBrachial-ankle PWV\nBrachial-ankle PWV (baPWV) was measured using the VP1000\nsystem (Omron Healthcare), a noninvasive automated wave-\nform analyzer. This device provides measures of baPWV, a\nmeasure of mixed central and peripheral PWV, on both the\nright and left sides, and the average of the 2 sides was used\nfor our study. baPWV is the distance in centimeters between\nthe brachial and ankle arterial recording sites divided by the\ntime delay in seconds between the foot of the waveforms\ndetected at the respective arterial sites. The distance or path\nlength for brachial/ankle arterial sites was calculated based\non a height-based algorithm.37 The intra- and inter-technician\nreliability was excellent with an intraclass correlation coeffi-\ncient >0.93 for all sites. baPWV data were collected at visit 12\nat the Pittsburgh site. Pittsburgh participants who did not\nhave the baPWV test at visit 12 were tested at visit 13.\nbaPWV was performed at visit 13 at other participating sites.\nAs a result, baPWV data were available for 956 participants in\nthis analysis.\nCarotid ultrasound scan\nBilateral ultrasound carotid images were obtained using a\nTerason t3000 Ultrasound System (Teratech Corp) equipped\nwith a variable frequency 5- to 12-MHz linear array trans-\nducer. On each side, 2 digitized images were obtained of the\ndistal common carotid artery, 1 cm proximal to the carotid\nbulb. From each of these 4 images, using the Artery\nMeasurement System semiautomated edge detection soft-\nware,38 IMT measures were obtained by electronically tracing\nand measuring the distance between the lumen-intima and\nthe media-adventitia interfaces of the near and far walls of the\ncommon carotid artery. One measurement was generated for\neach pixel over the area, for a total of %140 measures for\neach image. The mean of the average readings of all 4 images\nwere used in the analyses. Carotid scan images were read\ncentrally at the SWAN Ultrasound Reading Center (University\nof Pittsburgh Ultrasound Research Lab).\nThe presence and extent of plaque were evaluated in each\nof 5 segments of the left and right carotid artery (distal and\nPregnancy Outcomes and Late Midlife Blood Pressure Cort\nes et al\nhttp://jaha.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nproximal common carotid artery, carotid bulb, and proximal\ninternal and external carotid arteries).39 Consistent with the\nMannheim and American Society of Echocardiography con-\nsensus statements,40,41 plaque was defined as a distinct area\nprotruding into the vessel lumen that was at least 50% thicker\nthan the adjacent IMT and summarized as the presence or\nabsence of any plaque. Additionally, for each of the bilateral\ncarotid segments, the degree of plaque was graded between 0\n(no observable plaque) to 3 (plaque covering 50% of the\nvessel diameter). The grades from all segments of the\ncombined left and right carotid artery were summed to create\nthe plaque index (possible range: 0\u00ad30).42 Sonographers at\neach study site were trained by the University of Pittsburgh\nUltrasound Research Laboratory and monitored during the\nstudy period for reliability. Reproducibility for mean common\ncarotid artery IMT measures was excellent, with an intraclass\ncorrelation coefficient between sonographers of 0.72 to 0.95,\nand between readers >0.87. The plaque index was found to be\na valid and reproducible measure of carotid atherosclerosis in\na number of populations (intraclass correlation coefficient,\nCovariates\nSelf-reported history of preeclampsia (high BP and protein-\nuria), gestational hypertension, and gestational diabetes\nmellitus (no diabetes mellitus prepregnancy) were also\nassessed at visit 13 using the detailed pregnancy history\nquestionnaire. Previous studies have shown that maternal\nrecall of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy has low\nsensitivity (yet high specificity, >90%) for all hypertensive\ndisorders.15,45 Studies have shown greater sensitivity and\npredictive validity for maternal recall of PTB, small-for-\ngestational age birth, and pregnancy loss.34,35,46 Therefore,\nrelying on what is known about maternal self-report, the\nprimary exposures of interest in this analysis are PTB, small-\nfor-gestational age birth, and stillbirth (pregnancy loss at\n20 weeks). Because of the small sample of women with a\nreported history gestational diabetes mellitus, we did not\nconsider it as a separate exposure. To address these\nlimitations, sensitivity analyses were performed (as described\nin the Statistical Analysis) excluding women with a reported\nhistory of preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and gesta-\ntional diabetes mellitus.\nDemographic and socioeconomic characteristics including\nrace/ethnicity and education were assessed by self-report at\nSWAN baseline. All other covariates were assessed at the\ntime the carotid ultrasound was performed (corresponding to\nvisit 12 or 13). Information on maternal age at first and last\nbirth was assessed at visit 13 using the pregnancy history\nquestionnaire for all women. Menopause status at the time of\nthe carotid ultrasound measure was determined based on\nreports about frequency and regularity of menstrual bleeding\nand use of hormone therapy, as previously described.47\nCurrent hormone use, including menopausal hormone therapy\nand oral contraceptives, was based on reported use since last\nSWAN visit.\nFinancial strain (ie, difficulty in paying for basics) was self-\nreported and data from the visit corresponding to the carotid\nultrasound was used in this analysis. Smoking (current/past,\nnever), alcohol use, physical activity, and medication use (ie,\nantihypertensive, antidiabetics, lipid-lowering) were drawn\nfrom the visit concurrent with the carotid ultrasound. Physical\nactivity was assessed using modified Baecke Scores of\nHabitual Physical Activity, with higher scores indicating more\nphysical activity.48 Body mass index was calculated as weight\nin kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2).\nDiabetes mellitus was defined as fasting glucose levels\n126 mg/dL on 2 consecutive visits or any reported use of\ninsulin/antidiabetic agents. Hypertension was defined as\nantihypertensive treatment.\nBlood was drawn in the morning following a 12-hour fast.\nSamples were frozen (\u00c080\u00b0C) and sent on dry ice to the\nMedical Research Laboratories (Lexington). The homeostatic\nmodel assessment index was calculated from fasting insulin\nand glucose as (insulin [mU/L]9glucose [mmole/L per\n22.5]).49 Triglycerides were analyzed by enzymatic methods\non a Hitachi 747 analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics)\nand high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was isolated using\nheparin-2M manganese chloride.50 Low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald equation.51\nStatistical Analysis\nVariables were examined for distributions and outliers and\ntransformation of data was applied as needed. To compare\nCVD risk factors across pregnancy outcome groups (no\nadverse pregnancy outcome, PTB, term small-for-gestational-\nage birth, and more than 1 adverse outcome), ANOVA or\nKruskal\u00adWallis tests were performed for continuous data and\nchi-square or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Post\nhoc analyses using the Dunnett test were conducted with the\nno adverse pregnancy outcome group as the reference group.\nAssociations between each adverse pregnancy outcome\nand each subclinical CVD measure were examined using\nmultiple linear (BP indices, baPWV, IMT) and logistic regres-\nsion (carotid plaque presence, plaque index) models. Models\nwere first adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, site, financial\nstrain, and age at first birth, with additional adjustments for\ncovariates associated with adverse pregnancy categories and\nsubclinical CVD measures at P<0.1. In analyses for baPWV,\nIMT, and plaque, models were next adjusted for SBP.\nPregnancy Outcomes and Late Midlife Blood Pressure Cort\nes et al\nhttp://jaha.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nSubsequent models adjusted for other traditional CVD risk\nfactors (ie, body mass index, physical activity, smoking status,\nhomeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, and\nhigh- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Additional\nmodels adjusted for current use of antihypertensive, antidi-\nabetic, and lipid-lowering medications. Sensitivity analyses\nwere also performed: (1) excluding women with prevalent\nhypertension (n=654), as defined earlier; (2) excluding women\nwith a reported history of preeclampsia, gestational hyper-\ntension, or gestational diabetes mellitus (n=172); and (3)\nexcluding women who were premenopausal/perimenopausal\nat the time of carotid ultrasound (n=74). Interactions between\nadverse pregnancy outcomes and race/ethnicity were exam-\nined by entering the appropriate cross product terms into\nmultivariable models, and stratified analyses were performed\nfor significant interactions. Residual analyses and model\ndiagnostics were evaluated for evidence of collinearity in all\nmodels.\nResults\nA total of 255 women (21%) reported a history of an adverse\npregnancy outcome: 114 PTB, 59 term small-for-gestational-\nage birth, 22 stillbirth, and 60 multiple adverse pregnancy\noutcomes (of which 44 had a PTB) (Table 1). At the time of the\ncarotid scan visit, the women were an average age of\nwere postmenopausal. Post hoc analyses revealed that,\ncompared with women who reported having no adverse\npregnancy outcome, women who reported multiple adverse\npregnancy outcomes were younger at first birth (22 years\nreport a history of preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, or\ngestational diabetes mellitus compared with those without a\nreported adverse pregnancy outcome (26% versus 12%;\nP<0.001). Rates of diabetes mellitus and hypertension at\nlate midlife differed by adverse outcome group, with the\nlowest rates in the no adverse outcome group (Table 2).\nMean\u00c6SD SBP and DBP at late midlife was highest for the\nmultiple adverse outcome group (SBP: 131\u00c619 mm Hg; DBP:\nof an adverse pregnancy outcome, with those reporting a prior\nPTB or term small-for-gestational-age birth having higher\nbaPWV than women with no adverse outcome. IMT was higher\nfor the term for-gestational-age and multiple adverse outcome\ngroups.\nIn multiple linear regression analyses, a reported history of\nPTB or multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes was significantly\nassociated with higher BP indices (Table 3). PTB remained\nsignificantly associated with all BP indices after excluding\nwomen with hypertension. Reported history of PTB or term\nsmall-for-gestational-age birth was associated with higher\nbaPWV in models adjusting for sociodemographics and age at\nfirst birth, but not in models adjusting for SBP (Table 4). We\nfurther adjusted for other CVD risk factors and medications,\nwhich did not significantly impact findings. Sensitivity anal-\nyses (excluding women with a reported history of preeclamp-\nsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus,\nwith exclusion of premenopausal/perimenopausal women)\ndid not show any significant change in b coefficients (data not\nshown), although the association between PTB and baPWV\napproached significance when women with prevalent hyper-\ntension were excluded (P=0.09). No significant interactions\nwere present between race/ethnicity and any adverse\npregnancy outcomes for either BP or baPWV.\nTable 5 presents results for the associations between\nadverse pregnancy outcomes and IMT. Reported history of\nPTB was associated with lower IMT in fully adjusted models.\nThere was a significant interaction between history of PTB and\nrace/ethnicity (P=0.006) in relation to IMT. Because of the\nsmall sample size of Hispanic and Chinese women, these\nanalyses were limited to women who identified as black or\nwhite. In the fully adjusted models stratified by race/ethnicity,\nPTB was associated with lower IMT in black women but not in\nwhite women. When sensitivity analyses were performed\nexcluding women with hypertension, PTB was not significantly\nassociated with IMT and there was no significant interaction\nbetween history of PTB and race/ethnicity. Although term\nsmall-for-gestational-age birth and multiple adverse preg-\nnancy outcomes were associated with a higher IMT in\nunadjusted analyses, the association was attenuated when\ncontrolling for sociodemographic factors and age at first birth.\nReported history of an adverse pregnancy outcome was not\nassociated with carotid plaque presence or index, and these\nfindings were not modified by race/ethnicity.\nDiscussion\nThis is the first study in a racially diverse cohort of women in\nlate midlife (aged 60 years) to assess the impact of PTB, term\nsmall-for-gestational-age birth, and stillbirth on various indices\nof BP and subclinical CVD. History of a PTB was associated\nwith higher indices of BP (SBP, DBP, and mean arterial\npressure) but lower IMT in late midlife. For baPWV, the\nassociation was attenuated after adjusting for SBP. There was\na significant interaction between PTB and race/ethnicity in\nrelation to IMT, with PTB being associated with lower IMT in\nblack women, but no significant relationship was found\nin white women. Moreover, there was no significant associ-\nation between PTB and IMT when excluding women with\nhypertension or those taking antihypertensive treatment.\nHaving multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes (a recurrent\noutcome or a combination of PTB, term small-for-gestational-\nPregnancy Outcomes and Late Midlife Blood Pressure Cort\nes et al\nhttp://jaha.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nage birth, stillbirth) was associated with higher BP indices in\nfully adjusted models, but not after excluding women with\nprevalent hypertension. These associations did not differ by\nrace/ethnicity.\nThis study was able to examine whether previous associ-\nations noted between PTB and BP19,27,52 remain significant in\nlate midlife, when women transition through menopause and\nrisk of CVD increases.25 Consistent with prior analyses, we\nfound that history of PTB was positively related to BP even\nwhen excluding women with prevalent hypertension and\npreeclampsia, gestational hypertension, or gestational dia-\nbetes mellitus.52,53 In fully adjusted models, we observed that\nwomen with a prior PTB exhibited 6.4 mm Hg higher SBP and\n3.2 mm Hg higher DBP compared with women with all term\nbirths, a stronger association than that seen in previous\nstudies,19,27,52 perhaps because of the older age of women in\nour sample. These data are clinically significant given that a\n2-mm Hg increment in SBP has been associated with a 7%\nTable 1.

Our findings may further suggest\nthat as women age, BP increases more rapidly among those\nwith a history of PTB. Similarly, a history of multiple adverse\npregnancy outcomes was associated with higher BP indices.\nWe found a 7.3-mm Hg higher SBP in women with multiple\nadverse pregnancy outcomes, suggesting that there may be a\ndose-response relationship between number of adverse\npregnancy outcomes and SBP in late midlife. However, the\nassociation was attenuated after excluding women with\nprevalent hypertension, perhaps attributable to a small\nsample size (75% of women in this group had hypertension).\nThe most commonly reported adverse outcome in this group\nwas PTB. Accordingly, history of PTB may help identify women\nat risk for higher BP in midlife and who may benefit from\nmonitoring BP indices during the menopause transition.\nAlthough we were unable to differentiate between sponta-\nneous (caused by premature rupture of membranes, prema-\nture labor, or cervical insufficiency) or medically indicated\nPTB, the exclusion of women with hypertensive disorders of\npregnancy, gestational diabetes mellitus, and preterm small-\nfor-gestational age births from this PTB group (the leading\nindications for medically inducted PTB), suggest that there is a\ncommon link between PTB and future maternal BP other than\nhypertension during pregnancy and this may extend to\nspontaneous PTB. Future studies with these clinical features,\nhowever, are needed to answer this important question.\nConsistent with a previous study of subclinical CVD among\nwomen 4 to 12 years after pregnancy,52 our study found no\nsignificant association between PTB and baPWV after adjust-\ning for SBP. One possibility is that baPWV, a combined\nmeasure of central and peripheral arterial stiffness,58 may be\na less accurate measure of arterial stiffness than carotid-\nfemoral PWV.59 Although flow-mediated dilation of the\nbrachial artery is a consistent noninvasive measure predictive\nof long-term cardiovascular events,60 this measure was only\navailable in a subsample of women in our sample (n=376), of\nwhich %75 reported an adverse pregnancy outcome.\nTable 3.

Furthermore, there was no longer an interaction\nwith race/ethnicity in these models. An assessment of IMT\nprogression in a larger sample of women without hypertension\nwould better characterize the impact of PTB on carotid\nremodeling in midlife.\nAlthough not significant, it is important to note that a\nreported history of term small-for-gestational-age birth and\nmultiple adverse pregnancy outcomes was positively associ-\nated with IMT. Recent studies have also found a significant\nassociation between small-for-gestational-age birth and\nBP,24,27 although our data did not support this finding.\nHowever, our analysis had a smaller sample size, which may\nhave impaired our ability to robustly detect differences\nbetween groups. It is also possible that sociodemographic\ncharacteristics not fully explained in our data underlie the\nassociation between small-for-gestational-age birth and BP.\nWomen with a history of term small-for-gestational-age birth\nand multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes had higher body\nmass index and insulin resistance, suggesting that these\npregnancy outcomes may lead to greater IMT through an\nassociation with metabolic factors.\nIn this analysis, we did not find an association between\nhistory of adverse pregnancy outcomes and carotid plaque, a\nfinding consistent with related work among other samples of\nwomen.66 With less than half of our sample having any carotid\nplaque, sample size to examine this association was some-\nwhat limited. Future work with samples of older women,\nwomen who are more likely to show plaque,67 can further\ninvestigate the association between adverse pregnancy\noutcome and carotid plaque.\nStudy Limitations\nThere are several limitations to consider in this analysis. First,\nalthough the accuracy of maternal recall of preterm, small-\nreported history may still be a limitation. In addition, self-report\nof preeclampsia and gestational hypertension may have been a\nlimitation given the low sensitivity15,46 of maternal recall of\nhypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Furthermore, our sample\nsize of women with a term small-for-gestational-age birth or\nmay have limited our ability to detect an association between\nterm small-for gestation age birth and stillbirth with subclinical\nCVD. It is also possible that these adverse pregnancy outcomes\nmay be related to CVD through another physiologic pathway (ie,\nsocioeconomic drivers, body mass index, glucose dysregula-\ntion). In addition, data on prepregnancy CVD risk were not\navailable, limiting our ability to determine whether differences\nin BP, lipid profile, or vascular measures were present before\nadverse pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, although we\nexcluded women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy,\ngestational diabetes mellitus, and preterm small-for gestational\nage from our models, we were unable to differentiate between\nspontaneous PTB and medically indicated PTB, which may have\nvarying effects on maternal CVD risk. Future studies with\nclinical features of PTB are necessary to understand the impact\nof spontaneous versus medically indicated PTB on CVD in later\nlife. Comparison between PTB subtypes is also necessary. For\nexample, is there an association between early PTB (delivery\n<34 weeks) or very small-for-gestational-age birth (birthweight\n<5th percentile for gestational age) and subclinical CVD in\nmidlife? Previous reports support the potential for such\nconclusions regarding the magnitude of excess CVD risk in\nwomen in late midlife based on these measures of subclinical\nCVD alone. While the indices of subclinical CVD used in this\nstudy are good predictors of CVD,70\u00ad72 additional research is\nnecessary to assess the impact of adverse pregnancy outcomes\non endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation. Future\nstudies with larger sample sizes may have the power to not\nonly explore adverse pregnancy outcomes further but to\nexamine severity of adverse pregnancy outcomes in relation\nto BP and subclinical CVD.\nStudy Strengths\nStrengths of this analysis include the relatively large sample of\nracially diverse women as well as the direct assessment of\nphysical and vascular measures at late midlife. Our study\nprovides information on the association between adverse\npregnancy outcomes, BP, and subclinical CVD at late midlife,\nwhen absolute CVD risk increases.25 This study was able to\nexamine whether the negative impact of adverse pregnancy\noutcomes on various indices of BP and subclinical CVD persist\nwith aging. Furthermore, we examined the impact of having\nmultiple prior adverse pregnancy outcomes, which has not been\nstudied extensively and may pose a risk for later-life CVD.\nAlthough the American Heart Association now recognizes\nhypertensive disorders of pregnancy and gestational diabetes\nmellitus as a risk factor for future CVD and stroke,73 our\nfindings suggest that history of PTB may be added to this\ngroup of pregnancy risk factors. With stillbirths and small-for-\ngestational-age births accounting for 1% and 10% of births in\nthe United States, respectively,2 additional studies about the\nassociation between these adverse pregnancy outcomes and\nCVD is necessary for early risk stratification and prevention.\nAlthough one of the strengths of this analysis was its focus on\nlate midlife, when the overwhelming majority of women are\npostmenopausal, perhaps group differences may be detected\nin late perimenopause, when progression rates of subclinical\nPregnancy Outcomes and Late Midlife Blood Pressure Cort\nes et al\nhttp://jaha.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nCVD is greatest.31 Therefore, future research across the\nmenopause transition may be important to determine the\nimpact of adverse pregnancy outcomes on progression of BP\nand subclinical CVD.\nConclusions\nOur study shows that reported history of PTB is associated\nwith higher BP indices in late midlife independent of prevalent\nhypertension and history of hypertensive disorders of preg-\nnancy. A history of PTB was associated with lower IMT in\nblack women and not white women, potentially because of the\ngreater rate of hypertension in this group, as suggested by the\nattenuation of this association when excluding women with\nprevalent hypertension. With black women having excess\nrates of PTB, hypertension, and CVD,74\u00ad77 there is a critical\nneed to better understand racial/ethnic differences in the\nassociation between pregnancy-related factors and progres-\nsion of CVD. These findings suggest that history of PTB may\nhelp identify women with heightened BP in late midlife, a\nmajor contributor to CVD morbidity and mortality. In addition,\nthis analysis demonstrates the importance of monitoring BP\nindices among women with a history of PTB.\n"
