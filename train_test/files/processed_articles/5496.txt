    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: This study investigated the protective effect of FK506 in podocytes and the correlation of TRPC6 with\npodocyte injury repair.\nMethods: MPC5 were cultured in vitro, parallel with the control group, an Ang II stimulation group, and an FK506\nintervention group. The apoptosis rate with flow cytometry also detected TRPC6 mRNA and protein expression by RT-\nPCR and Western blot, and then observed the distribution of TRPC6 with indirect immunofluorescence labeling under\nconfocal microscope.\nResults: The activities of podocytes significantly increased after FK506 intervention for 24 hours and 48 hours when\ncompared with the Ang II stimulation group, and the apoptosis rate was markedly lower than that of the Ang II stimulation\ngroup, while in contrast to TRPC6 mRNA and protein expression.\nConclusion: FK506 can directly act on the podocytes to inhibit Ang II-induced damage on podocyte structures and\nreduce the apoptosis rate of podocytes, which may be related to stabilizing TRPC6 expression and distribution in\npodocytes by FK506, thus maintaining the structure and function integrity of the slit diaphragm and playing a role in\nprotecting podocytes and antiproteinuria.\n",

The discovery of TRPC6 opens up a\nnew field for us to investigate podocyte injury, repair and\nprevention at the molecular level. TRPC6 combines with\nnephrin, podocin and CD2AP molecules to form a signal-\ning complex that maintains the structure and function integ-\nrity of the SD, while playing an important role in the\nmechanisms of podocyte injury and repair. FK506 is a new\ngeneration of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) used in the treat-\nment of kidney diseases and graft rejection by inhibiting\nthe activation of T cells, the proliferation of dependent B\ncells on Th helper cells, and the expression of lymphokines\nsuch as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-3 and -interferon, and IL-2R,\nto induce immune inhibitory effects.2 A large number of\nclinical studies demonstrated that FK506 significantly\nreduced renal tissue damage and proteinuria in various kid-\nney diseases, and the in vitro studies3,4 also confirmed that\ncommon distribution existed between FK506 ligand FKBP\nand TRPC6, and bound with TRPC channel protein by the\nLeu-Pro (LP) dipeptide, thus we inferred that FK506 may\ninteract with TRPC6. The application of FK506 to observe\nits effect on TRPC6 expression and distribution in the dam-\naged glomerular podocytes has not been reported. In this\nstudy, an angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced podocyte injury\nmodel was used to observe the effect of TRPC6 in the pro-\ncess of Ang II-induced apoptosis of mouse podocytes and\nthe effect of FK506 intervention on TRPC6 expression and\nInfluence of tacrolimus on podocyte\ninjury inducted by angiotensin II\nYu Shengyou, Yu Li, Hao Zhihong and Ma Yuanyuan\n Keywords\nTacrolimus, podocyte, proteinuria, TRPC6, apoptosis\nDepartment of Pediatric, Guangzhou First People's Hospital,\nGuangzhou Medical University, China\nCorresponding author:\nYu Li, Department of Pediatric, Guangzhou First People's Hospital,\nOriginal Article\ndistribution, to investigate the protective effect of FK506\non podocytes and the correlation of TRPC6 with podocyte\ninjury repair.\nMaterials and methods\nA mouse podocyte cell line (MPC5) was donated by\nProfessor Jie Ding in the Pediatric Department of Peking\nUniversity First Hospital and authorized by Professor\nPeter Mundel of the United States. Podocytes were cul-\ntured at 37\u00b0C in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)\nbovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone Company) in a 5% CO2\nincubation box. The experiments were divided into three\ngroups: the control group: culture with RPMI 1640\nmedium containing 0.02% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO);\nthe Ang II stimulation group: Ang II (10\u00ad6 mol/l) was\nadded to stimulate the podocytes; the FK506 intervention\ngroup: Ang II and FK506 (5 g /ml) was added and dis-\nsolved in 0.02% DMSO to interact with the podocytes at\nthe same time.\nFlow cytometry\nThe cells were digested with ethylenediaminetetraacetic\nacid (EDTA)-free trypsin, cells were collected, centrifuged\nand 500 l buffer was added, then the suspended cells were\ntransferred into a streaming tube, and 5 l propidium\niodide (PI) and 5 l Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate\n(FITC) were simultaneously added to keep a light-resistant\nreaction for 10 minutes, and further analyzed by flow\ncytometry.\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nAccording to the operating instructions of RNAgents Total\nRNA Isolation System (Promega Corporation), total cel-\nlular RNAwas extracted, subjected to reverse transcription\n(RT) and real-time PCR reaction as required by the 7500\nFast Real-Time PCR System operation, in which the melt-\ning curve chart was used for quantitative PCR, the speci-\nficity of the PCR product was tested by agarose gel\nelectrophoresis, and the objective gene was quantitatively\nanalyzed by the double standard curve method.\nWestern blot\nThe internal control glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydro-\ngenase (GAPDH) and TRPC6 protein expression were\nrespectively detected, then each objective protein expres-\nsion was divided by the internal control (GAPDH) then the\nobtained value represented the relative objective protein\ncontent in each sample after the calibration by internal\ncontrol (GAPDH). This value was further used for the\ncomparison between the samples.\nImmunofluorescence staining to check TRPC6\ndistribution in podocytes\nThe cells were seeded nearly full in a cover glass, fixed\nwith ice cold acetone, and incubated by primary and sec-\nondary antibodies, then images was taken by using\ncopy with FITC (green) channel at the excitation wave-\nlength of 488 nm, and further analyzed by computer.\nStatistical methods\nAll the data were treated with SPSS 17.0 statistical soft-\nware for statistical evaluation, and the calculated results\nwere expressed with x s\n-\u00b1 and the statistical evaluation\nwas performed using one-way analysis of variance\n(ANOVA) (more than two groups), or least significant dif-\nference (LSD)-t (variances assumed), values of p < 0.05\nwere considered as statistically significance.\nThe results\nMorphological changes of podocytes after\npuromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) damage and\nThe cells were observed and photographed under inverted\nmicroscope, and the relative area of podocytes was calcu-\nlated by ImageJ and SPSS.

TRPC6 at different time\npoints after FK506 intervention was distributed more uni-\nformly in the cell membrane, and the distribution remark-\nably improved in the whole cells more than before, and\ntended to be normal (Figure 4).\nDiscussion\nTRPC6 is a non-selective transient receptor potential cation\nchannel positioned in the cell membrane. SD in podocytes\nconstitutes the last barrier of glomerular filtration, and\nplays an important role in maintaining the hematuria barrier\nand preventing leakage of high molecular weight protein.5\nHowever, podocytes are highly differentiated cells, and\nonce damaged they are hard to repair, so the pathological\nchanges of many kidney diseases show as foot processes\nfusion and loss, podocytes injury and exfoliation. This\nstudy observed the effect of FK506 on the morphology,\nactivity, and apoptosis rate of podocytes, and TRPC6\nexpression and distribution after podocyte damage, and\ninvestigated the protective effect of FK506 in podocytes\nand the correlation of TRPC6 with podocyte injury repair.\nFigure 2. The apoptosis rate of podocytes detected by flow cytometry in the control group, Ang II stimulation group and FK506\nintervention group at different time points.\nA propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V apoptosis kit with double staining was used to detect the apoptosis rate subjected to flow cytometric\nanalysis, in which the X axis is Annexin V(+) and the Y axis is PI (+), Q1 is PI (+), Annexin (\u00adV); Q2 is PI (+), Annexin (+V), the late apoptosis or\ndead cells; Q3 is PI (\u00ad), Annexin V (\u00ad), the normal living cell; Q4 is Annexin V (+), PI (\u00ad), the early apoptosis cells. The apoptosis rate of podocytes is\nshown in (a), (d), (g): the control group at eight hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, respectively; (b), (e), (h): Ang II group at eight hours, 24 hours, 48 hours,\nrespectively; (c), (f), (i): FK506 group at eight hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, respectively. Ang: angiotensin.\n264 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(2)\nAng II has been widely used in mechanism research of\npodocyte disease. It can induce foot process effacement of\npodocytes and lead to cytoskeletal damage and abnormal\nmolecular expression and distribution of podocytes.6\u00ad12 In\nthis study, we established podocyte injury models using\nAng II in this part of the study by referring to the previous\nwork of our group.13,14 The experimental results demon-\nstrated that the Ang II stimulation group showed foot pro-\ncess retraction at eight hours, and the cell area is reduced\nto 38.9% of the control group; the foot process signifi-\ncantly was reduced at 24 hours' stimulation, and the cell\narea declined to 5% of the control group; after stimulation\nfor 48 hours, the cell area declined to 4.5% of the control\ngroup, and part of the podocytes showed foot process\neffacement and loss of intercellular junctions. After Ang II\nstimulation for 24 hours and 48 hours, the cell activities of\npodocytes significantly decreased and the apoptosis rate\nobviously increased; after FK506 intervention for 24 hours\nand 48 hours, the cell activities of podocytes increased and\nthe apoptosis rate significantly decreased. Accordingly,\nAng II stimulation can result in glomerular podocyte mor-\nphology changes, increased apoptosis, decreased podocyte\nnumbers, and the damaged structural integrity of the SD,\nthen the damage of the SD structure would inevitably\naffect the function of the filtration barrier and finally lead\nto the occurrence of proteinuria. FK506 improved the cell\nmorphology, apoptosis, and podocyte number stability\nthrough inhibition of Ang II damage, and maintained the\nSD structure integrity of the podocytes, protected kidney\ntissue, and played an important role in anti-proteinuria.\nOur study found that FK506 could inhibit Ang II dam-\nage on podocytes to improve cell morphology, reduce\napoptosis and stabilize the number of podocytes, whereas\nits molecular mechanism is still not clear. In 2005, Winn's\nresearch group15 found that the TRPC6 mutation is the\nvirulence gene, which caused familial focal segmental glo-\nmerulosclerosis (FSGS), and this mutation resulted in an\nSD dysfunction and proteinuria, eventually developed into\nglomerulosclerosis and renal failure. Reiser's research\ngroup16 found that in patients suffering from nonhereditary\nproteinuric renal disease, such as non-familial FSGS,\nmembranous glomerulonephritis, minimal change nephri-\ntis, TRPC6 mRNA and protein expression were higher\nthan those of the normal control group. Accordingly,\nTRPC6 mutation or its increased expression is closely\nrelated to genetic and acquired kidney diseases. Ichimura\net al.17 applied cytochalasin D as the cytoskeleton-crack-\ning agent in in vitro differentiation and maturation of\nmouse podocyte MPC5, and found that TRPC6 protein\nexpression after application of cytochalasin D significantly\nincreased in comparison with the control group, which\nsuggested that increased TRPC6 expression correlated\nwith podocyte injury. Our study observed that, after Ang II\nstimulation for 24 hours and 48 hours, TRPC6 mRNA and\nprotein expression were higher than those of the control\ngroup, which was consistent with the literature that Ang II\ncan stimulate podocytes and induce abnormal intracellular\nTRPC6 transcription, translation and protein transloca-\ntion.18 At the same time, our experimental results also\ndemonstrated that TRPC6 was highly expressed with\nmRNA and protein at the same time points, and the peak\nvalues are consistent with each other, which indicated that\nthe effect of Ang II on TRPC6 expression in podocytes\naffects mRNA transcription and protein translation at the\nsame level. Our research confirmed that TRPC6 overex-\npression can activate the RhoA pathway; RhoA promotes\nthe formation of contractile actin-myosin and the stress\nfibers on the cell body, and their inappropriate activation\nmay further cause structure disorder of foot process.19 The\nin vivo study showed that TRPC6 mutations would even-\ntually cause Ca2+ dysfunction and result in glomerular dis-\nthe intracellular calcium overload by inhibiting TRPC6\nexpression in podocytes, thereby reducing the podocyte\napoptosis and stabilizing the number of podocytes, and\nfurther protect the podocytes and decrease proteinuria\nFigure 3.
