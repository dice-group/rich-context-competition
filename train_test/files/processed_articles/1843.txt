Jarvis1\n1Health Behaviour Unit, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom and 2Cancer\nEpidemiology and Prevention Division, The Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Warsaw, Poland\n Introduction\nSmoking prevalence is a vital marker of progress in tobacco\ncontrol (1). Its assessment involves national surveys of self-\nreported cigarette smoking status. Two threats to the accuracy\nof prevalence estimates are (a) misreporting of smoking status\nand (b) the failure to include non-cigarette tobacco smoking. It\nis widely assumed that the level of misreporting is so low that\nit will not lead to significant distortion. However, when\nsuccess or failure of tobacco control measures is typically\nmeasured by changes of a few percentage points, even low\nerror rates can be important, if they differ over time or across\ncountries. We present data from three countries in which we\ncompare smoking prevalence assessed by cotinine measure-\nment with estimates based on standard self-report measures of\ncigarette smoking.\nSaliva or serum cotinine concentration is a quantitative marker\nof nicotine intake (2). A concentration of 15 ng/mL in saliva or\nserum is a conservative cut point for detecting active smoking\n(2, 3). Using cotinine to check smoking status, there is evidence\nthat self-report is unreliable in specific populations where there is\npressure not to admit smoking, such as patients with respiratory\nResearch on the use of cotinine to verify self-reported\nsmoking status in population surveys is limited. A large study\nin Finland reported that male smoking prevalence would need\nto be adjusted from 32% to 34% because of elevated serum\ncotinine concentrations in putative nonsmokers (11). Another\nstudy in the United States found that only 1.4% of self-reported\nnonsmokers had serum cotinines higher than 15 ng/mL (12),\nwhich would suggest an upward revision in prevalence\nestimates of <1%. A review of earlier studies suggested that\nonly a small percentage of self-declared nonsmokers had\nelevated cotinine levels in population surveys (13). The\nprevailing view is that the problem of misreporting is not\nsufficiently large to warrant routine biochemical verification in\npopulation surveys (14).\nThe problem of misclassification of smoking status may be\ndifferent in different countries. To address this, we have\nanalyzed data from the 2003 Health Survey for England and\nfrom the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination\ncotinine measures. We also added saliva cotinine measurement\nto the 2004 national survey on smoking behaviors in Poland, a\ncountry with a much higher smoking prevalence (15).\nThe headline smoking prevalence figures are based on\ncigarettes only; however, cigar and pipe smoking also carry\nhealth risks and result in nicotine absorption (16, 17); therefore,\nwe examined how far increased prevalence figures derived\nfrom cotinine concentrations could be attributed to exclusion\nof pipe and cigar smoking versus underreporting of any\ntobacco smoking.\nGrant support: Cancer Research United Kingdom.

The Health Survey for England is an annual\nhousehold survey that includes a representative sample of\nadults aged 16 and above. Data collection involves an initial\ninterview at home followed by a visit from a research nurse\nabout 1 week later. Smoking behavior in those aged 16 and\nabove was ascertained at the initial interview and again at the\nnurse visit. A saliva sample for cotinine was collected at the\nnurse visit in a random subsample.3\ninterviewed, and 11,408 participated at the nurse visit.\nRespondents were asked if they used cigarettes, pipes, or\ncigars ``. . . at all these days.'' This standard question was used\nto determine whether they were current cigarette smokers or\ncurrent tobacco smokers. Ex-smokers were defined as those\nwho reported being ex\u00adregular cigarette smokers at interview\nand who also denied any current tobacco use at the nurse visit.\nIn one sixth of participants, additional measures were taken,\nincluding a saliva sample that was analyzed for cotinine by\nrapid gas-liquid chromatography with nitrogen detection (18).\nOne nonsmoking Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) user\nwas excluded from the analysis. There were 1,613 usable saliva\nsamples.\nwere female; 64% were married or cohabiting; 57% had the\nequivalent of ``O'' level education (post-16 qualification) or\nabove; 44% were from manual occupational groups.

Respondents\nwere interviewed in their homes and then invited to attend a\nMobile Examination Center (MEC) for objective measures\nabout 2 weeks later. Smoking behavior in those aged 20 and\nabove was ascertained in detail at the initial interview using\nstandard questions for determining national prevalence. At the\nMEC visit, a serum sample for cotinine was taken, and\nrespondents were asked about the use of cigarettes and other\ntobacco products and NRT over the past 5 days. Self-reported\nsmoking for the whole sample was based on responses\nat initial interview. Among respondents who provided a\ncotinine sample, self-reported smoking was derived from\ncigarette, pipe, or cigar use at the MEC. Users of smokeless\ntobacco products and NRT were excluded from the analyses.\nEx-smokers were those who reported being ex\u00adcigarette\nsmokers at interview and who also denied any smoking in\nthe past 5 days at the MEC. There were 5,411 respondents in\n53% were female, and 69% had high school education or\nabove. A total of 5,027 people attended the MEC, providing\n4,687 usable serum samples. Cotinine was analyzed by means\nof high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass\nspectrometry.\nPoland. Data were obtained from an annual survey on\nsmoking behaviors and attitudes that is based on a representa-\ntive random sample of households. The survey was conducted\nby the Cancer Centre and Institute of Oncology in collaboration\nwith the public opinion research center (TNS OBOP).\nabove. The sample was obtained from the Postcode Address\nand Inhabitants Register (PESEL) that is available for the\ngeneral Polish population at the Central Statistical Office.\nSampling was based on a random-route method, with random\nselection of ``starting point'' addresses and then, according to\npredefined procedures, selection of other addresses. Sampling\ninhabitants, towns with more than 100,000 inhabitants) in all\nthe biggest administrative units (voivodeships). In selected\nhouseholds, 15-year-old and older inhabitants were randomly\nselected from within the household to participate.\nRespondents were asked, ``Have you ever smoked at least 100\ncigarettes, pipes, cigars, etc. in your lifetime? Yes/No.'' Those\nwho answered yes were asked, ``Do you smoke now? Yes/No.''\nThese questions defined whether they were classified as\nsmokers, ex-smokers, or never smokers. Pipe and cigar smoking\nis extremely rare, and thus, separate figures are not given for\ncigarette versus total tobacco smoking. Respondents were\ninvited to provide a saliva sample, and 388 agreed and provided\na sample volume sufficient for analysis. Cotinine was assayed\nusing the method previously described for the English sample.\nThe sample consisted of 59% women. The mean age was\npartner; 23% completed only primary education; 29% com-\npleted vocational or ``gymnasium'' education; 32% had\ncompleted secondary education; and 15% completed postsec-\nondary or university education; 33% were in employment or\nself-employed. The corresponding figures for those that\nprovided a saliva specimen were very similar: 54% female;\npartner; 22% completed primary education; 27% completed\ngymnasium or secondary education; 15% completed post\u00ad\nsecondary education; and 33% were in employment or self-\nemployed.\nStatistical Analyses.

In the English sample, cigarette smoking preva-\nex-smokers. The current self-reported tobacco smoking prev-\nalence, including pipes and cigars, was 26.0%. In the sample\nfrom whom saliva specimens were obtained, cigarette smok-\ning prevalence was identical at 24.7%; ex-smokers were 24.7%,\nand self-reported current tobacco smokers comprised 26.2%\n(Table 1).\nOf the self-reported ex- or never smokers, 2.7% had cotinine\nconcentrations above the smoking cut point of 15 ng/mL (1.9%\nof those who said they had never smoked and 4.4% of\n``ex-smokers''). However, 3.2% of those who reported being\ntobacco smokers had cotinine concentrations below 15 ng/mL.\nThis resulted in 27.5% being classified as ``inhaling tobacco\nsmokers'' according to their saliva cotinine concentrations\n(Table 1). The prevalence of any tobacco smoking, defined\nas the percentage of self-reported smokers plus those with\na saliva cotinine concentration z15 ng/mL, was 28.8%. The\nmean cotinine concentration in self-declared nonsmokers with\ncotinine concentrations of at least 15 ng/mL was 128 ng/mL\nUnited States. In the U.S. sample, the prevalence of self-\nreported cigarette smoking was 21.7% (Table 1) and was\nslightly higher (22.8%) for respondents among whom cotinine\nwas measured. Self-reported total smoking, including pipes\nand cigars, was 22.8%, and in the subsample with cotinine\nassays, it was slightly higher at 24.2%; 1.3% of nonsmokers\nhad cotinine concentrations above 15 ng/mL (2.4% of self-\nreported ex-smokers and 0.7% of self-reported never smokers).\nThe mean cotinine concentration in these nonsmokers was\nhad cotinine <15 ng/mL, so the prevalence of adults with\ncotinines above this threshold (excluding snuffers, chewers,\nand NRT users from consideration) was 23.4%.

Thus, 41.8% were classified as smokers by cotinine, and\nthe prevalence of smoking defined in terms of self-report or an\nelevated cotinine was 43.6%. In the self-declared nonsmokers\nwith cotinines above the smoking cut point, the mean cotinine\nDiscussion\nSelf-reported cigarette smoking prevalence underestimated\ntrue tobacco smoking prevalence minimally in the U.S. sample\nbut by 4% in the Polish sample. Those who were misclassified\nhad cotinine concentrations indicative of substantial levels of\nactive smoking, which could not be due to passive exposure. In\nEngland, about half of the underestimation of smoking\nprevalence was attributable to pipe and cigar smoking and the\nrest to misreporting. In Poland, the underestimate seemed to be\nmostly based on misreporting, although it is possible that the\nrequirement to have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their\nlifetime may have misclassified some adolescent smokers. In\ntheory, some nonsmokers may have been using NRT, but\nincidence is very low in Poland,4 and the misreporting rate was\nalmost as high for self-declared never smokers as ex-smokers.\nA failure of self-report to accurately capture smoking status\nis just one of a number of serious threats to the validity of\nnational prevalence surveys and comparisons made using\nthese. We have not considered the role played by different age\nranges canvassed in different countries, different questions, nor\nthe fact that some countries only present daily smoking figures.\nIn conclusion, our data indicate that headline figures for\ncigarette smoking prevalence in England and Poland under-\nestimate the rate of active tobacco smoking. The degree of\nunderestimation was greater in Poland than in England. Our\nfindings indicate the need for an urgent review of methods of\nestimating smoking prevalence that takes into consideration all\nforms of tobacco smoking and correction using a biochemical\nmarker. Such a review should also examine other issues such\nas the definition of a smoker and the age range canvassed.\nReferences\n2. Benowitz NL. Biomarkers of environmental tobacco smoke exposure.\n3.
