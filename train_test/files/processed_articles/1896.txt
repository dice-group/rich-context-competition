In contrast, obese hypertensive patients\nwere not found to be more likely than normal/under-\nweight patients to adhere to lifestyle modification\nrecommendations. In addition, adherence rates for\nsodium and alcohol consumption reduction were higher\nthan that for either exercise or weight control. In\nconclusion, more aggressive approaches should be\ntaken by physicians to educate obese patients about\nthe benefits of lifestyle modifications and to improve\nadherence to enhance the effects of antihypertensive\nmedications.\nKeywords: adherence; obesity; lifestyle modifications; physical activity\nIntroduction\nThe JNC 7 and JNC 6 reports repeatedly stress the\nbeneficial effects of nonpharmacological interven-\ntions for hypertension.1,2 As compared to the\nadherence to pharmacological treatments, the ad-\nherence to nonpharmacological treatments is lower\namong hypertensive patients.3\u00ad5 Although it is\nrecommended that physicians provide advice and\nconsultations regarding lifestyle modifications as\npart of hypertension management, as suggested by\nthe JNC reports, low-to-moderate adherence is\nobserved in hypertensive patients.6,7\nIt was shown that the blood pressure (BP) levels of\npatients influenced physicians' prescriptions of life-\nstyle modifications.6 It is unknown, however, whether\na patient's weight status is incorporated in his or her\nphysician's decision of recommending lifestyle modi-\nfications. In addition, despite the known benefits of\nweight control/loss in BP control and management of\nother chronic conditions and diseases, it is unclear\nhow weight status of a patient influences adherence.\nCertain patient characteristics, such as age,8,9 pre-\nsence of chronic conditions, education,9 ethnicity,\nand income level10 were found to be associated with\nadherence to lifestyle modifications. However,\nwhether weight status of a patient was a factor\npredictive of adherence is not fully understood.\nAlthough one tends to believe that overweight and\nobese patients would be more likely to be active\nin improving health, seeking medical care, and\nadhering to treatment regimens, it was shown\nthat overweight men reported deficits in care as\nCorrespondence: Dr KT Xu, Department of Family & Community\nMedicine, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health\nE-mail: Ke.Xu@ttuhsc.edu\nwww.nature.com/jhh\ncompared with average weight men.11 Also, a higher\nbody mass index (BMI) increased the likelihood\nof delay and avoidance of care.12 In seeking prev-\nention, morbidly obese women were less likely\nthan normal weight women to undergo cancer\nscreenings.13 Among hypertension patients, results\nfrom cluster analyses indicated that obesity and\nnonadherence to medications were clustered with\nnonadherence to lifestyle modifications.14 Unfortu-\nnately, no previous studies of chronic disease\nmanagement investigated the independent effect of\npatients' weight status on adherence to lifestyle\nmodifications.\nThe objective of this study was to investigate how\nweight status affected physicians' recommendations\nof lifestyle modifications to hypertensive patients and\npatients' adherence after they received the recom-\nmendations. The following hypotheses were tested:\n1. Overweight and obese hypertensive patients are\nmore likely than normal weight patients to\nreceive recommendations of lifestyle modifica-\ntions, given the hypertension stages and comor-\nbidities; and\n2. Adherence rates for lifestyle modifications are\nhigher among overweight and obese patients.\nMethods\nData\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination\nsurvey was part of the NHANES series starting in\nthe 1960s. The NHANES data were collected by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThe NHANES survey design was a stratified, multi-\nstage probability sample of the civilian noninstitutio-\noversampled low-income persons, adolescents 12\u00ad19\nyears, persons 60 years of age or older, African\nAmericans and Mexican Americans. In addition to\ninterviews, health examinations were conducted\nthrough mobile examination centres, which had on\nstaff one physician, one dentist, two dietary inter-\nviewers, three certified medical technologists, five\nhealth technicians, one phlebotomist, two inter-\nviewers and one computer data manager. Home\nexaminations were given to subjects who were unable\nor unwilling to visit the mobile examination centres.\nLaboratory results were obtained from analyses of\nblood, urine, hair, air, tuberculosis skin test, and\nhousehold dust specimens collected at the mobile\nexamination centres or in the home. There were 9965\nHypertension and weight status\nFor the purpose of the current study, an adult\nsubject (18 \u00fe years) was included in the sample if\n(1) his or her systolic blood pressure (SBP) from\nthe examination was 120 mmHg or higher or\ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 80 mmHg or\nhigher, or (2) he or she was taking antihypertensive\nmedications. Three or four BP determinations were\ntaken for each subject in the mobile examination\ncentre or home following standardized protocols.\nThe average readings of the SBP and DBP were used\nin the current study to determine a subject's\nhypertension stage. Subjects who satisfied the\ninclusion criteria were grouped into prehyper-\nthe following text, the definition of hypertension\nincludes prehypertension.\nA hypertensive patient's BP may be under control\nif he or she is taking medications. To incorporate the\neffects of antihypertensive medications, the final\ncategorization of hypertension status was the inter-\naction of hypertension stage (prehypertension,\nStages I and II) and whether a patient took\nantihypertensives (see the header column of\nTable 1). It should be noted that it is possible for\npatients who took antihypertensives to have normal\nBP. Normal BP with antihypertensives was added as\nan additional category.\nSubjects' weight status was determined by their\nBMI. Body measurements were obtained in the\nmobile examination centres following the Anthro-\npometric Standardization Reference manual.16\nUsing the classification by CDC, subjects were\ngrouped into underweight (BMIo18.5 kg/m2), nor-\nm2).17 Because the underweight group had too small\na sample size to provide accurate estimates, the\ncurrent study combined the first two groups as the\nnormal/underweight category.\nPhysicians' recommendations and patients' adherence\nIn NHANES, subjects were asked `Have you ever\nbeen told by a doctor or other health professional\nthat you had hypertension, also called high blood\npressure?' If the answer was `Yes', then they were\nfurther asked whether physicians had recom-\nmended lifestyle modifications (LMs). LMs in-\ncluded weight control, reduction of sodium intake,\nmore exercise and reduction of alcohol intake.\nPatients' adherence to the recommended LMs\nwere obtained from subjects who received recom-\nmendations of LMs from physicians. They were\nasked (for hypertension) `Are you now controlling\nyour weight or losing weight', `Are you now cutting\ndown on salt or sodium in your diet', `Are you now\nexercising more', and `Are you now cutting down on\nyour alcohol consumption,' respectively. Conse-\nquently, adherence was defined as responses of\n`yes' to these questions.\nEffects of obesity on BP management\n \nJournal of Human Hypertension\nControl variables\nIn addition to weight status and hypertension stage,\nother factors (eg, comorbidities) may have affected\nphysicians' recommendations of LMs. Several con-\ntrol variables in addition to weight status and\nhypertension status were included in the analyses\nof the recommendations of LMs. Included self-\nreported comorbidities were dyslipidaemia, heart\ndiseases, diabetes mellitus, and kidney diseases.\nFurthermore, patients' age and gender were\ncontrolled for. In addition, it has been shown that\nin predicting adherence, race/ethnicity, educational\nachievement and income level were significant.18\u00ad20\nIn analysing adherence, race/ethnicity, education\nand income level were also included as control\nvariables.\nStatistical analyses\nTo address how weight status affected physicians'\nrecommendations of LMs, multivariate logistic\nregressions were used to determine whether physi-\ncians took into consideration a patient's weight\nstatus in recommending each of the four LMs,\ncontrolling for hypertension stage, comorbidities,\nage and gender of the subject. As discussed earlier,\nbecause only patients who were aware of their\nhypertension responded to the questions of recom-\nmendations of LMs, only a subsample of patients\n(n \u00bc 1368) were included in the multivariate\nanalyses. The comparisons between patients\nwho were and were not aware of their hypertension\nwere made.\nTo examine whether weight status was associated\nwith adherence to each LM, a second set of multi-\nvariate logistic regressions were performed, control-\nling for hypertension stage, comorbidities, age,\ngender, race/ethnicity, education and income. The\nadherence analyses were performed among only\npatients whose physicians recommended LMs,\nbecause adherence could not be defined if patients\ndid not receive recommendations from physicians.\nThe complex sampling design, primary sampling\nunits, strata and person weight in NHANES were\nincorporated in all analyses to provide natio-\nnally representative estimates for the adult hyper-\ntensive subpopulation. Statistical software STATAs\n(College Station, TX, USA) was used to perform all\nanalyses.\nResults\nof hypertension (including prehypertension),\nrepresenting 57.0% of the US adult population in\nabout 53.9% were prehypertensive and were not\ntaking antihypertensive medications and about\n19.5% were Stages I and II hypertension but not\ntaking antihypertensives. About 4.1 and 10.3% were\npatients who were taking antihypertensives and had\nnormal BP and prehypertension, respectively. Ap-\nproximately 12.4% were taking antihypertensives\nand had Stages I and II hypertension. Among the\nhypertensive adults, 30.3% were normal/under-\nobese. The crosstabulation of hypertension stage\nand weight status of the hypertensive adult popula-\ntion is shown in Table 1. The general observation\nwas that as compared with normal/underweight\npatients, overweight and obese patients were more\nlikely to be on antihypertensive medications and\nmore likely to have Stages I and II hypertension.\nTable 2 reports the composition of the full\nhypertensive adult sample and the sample of those\nwho were aware of their hypertension to be used in\nthe multivariate analyses. As compared with the full\nsample, patients who were aware of their hyperten-\nsion were more likely to be overweight or obese,\nTable 1 Hypertension stage and weight status\nNormal/underweight\nOverweight\nN % N % N %\nWeight categories in the full\nSample size and population proportions that are nationally representative are shown. Complex sampling design of NHANES was incorporated to\nEffects of obesity on BP management\n \nJournal of Human Hypertension\nmore likely to have chronic comorbidities and older.\nAll subjects who were not aware of their hyperten-\nsion were not on antihypertensives (n \u00bc 1693) and\n70.9% of them had prehypertension.\nTable 3 shows the descriptive statistics and\nmultivariate analyses of physicians' recommenda-\ntions of LMs. Over half of the subjects aware of their\nhypertension were told by their physicians to\ncontrol weight. About two-thirds were told to\nreduce sodium consumption and to exercise more.\nApproximately 28.1% were told to reduce alcohol\nconsumption. As compared to normal/underweight\nsubjects, obese subjects were 9.0 times (Po0.01) as\nlikely to receive advice on weight control, 1.7 times\n(P \u00bc 0.04) as likely to be told by physicians to reduce\nsodium intake, and more than three times (Po0.01)\nas likely to be advised to increase exercise levels.\nThe odds of receiving advice on weight control was\ncompared to normal/underweight subjects. Weight\nstatus was not found to be associated with recom-\nmendations of alcohol intake reduction.\nOverall, patients on antihypertensives were sig-\nnificantly more likely than those who were not on\nantihypertensives to receive all four recommenda-\ntions from their physicians. Hypertension stage\namong patients who were not on antihypertensives\ndid not seem to affect the probabilities of receiving\nthe LM recommendations from their physicians.\nOn the patients' side, a different pattern emerged\nin regard to the effect of weight status on the\nadherence to LMs (Table 4). Among the four LMs,\nthe adherence rate for sodium reduction was the\nhighest, 86.0%, whereas that for more exercise was\nthe lowest, 60.1%. Neither weight status nor\nhypertension status significantly influenced the\nadherence. That is, overweight/obese patients were\nnot more likely to adhere to LM recommendations.\nAlthough not shown in Table 4, a few demo-\ngraphic and health characteristics were found to be\nassociated with adherence. Controlling for weight\nstatus and hypertension stage, females were found\nto be more likely than males to adhere to sodium\nwere more likely than non-Hispanic whites to\nadhere to recommendations of exercise (OR \u00bc 2.61,\nP \u00bc 0.025). Subjects with heart diseases were more\nlikely than those without heart diseases to adhere to\nrecommendations of weight control (OR \u00bc 2.42,\nP \u00bc 0.013). Patients with dyslipidaemia were less\nlikely to reduce sodium intake (OR \u00bc 0.69,\nP \u00bc 0.031). Diabetic patients were more likely to\nDiscussion\nThis study examined the effects of weight status on\nwhether adult hypertensive patients received re-\ncommendations of lifestyle modifications from their\nphysicians and on their adherence. Because over-\nweight and obese patients are at higher risks for\nelevated BP, we would expect physicians to be more\nlikely to recommend LMs to overweight and obese\npatients than to normal weight patients, given the\nsame hypertension stage. For the same reason, we\nwould expect overweight and obese patients to be\nmore likely than their normal weight counterparts to\nadhere to the LM regimens to control BP. Our results\nindicated that physicians indeed were more aggres-\nsive in recommending LMs for obese patients. In\ncontrast, obese hypertensive patients were not\nTable 2 Sample description\nFull sample Subjects aware of\nhypertension\nWeight status\nHypertension stage\nComorbidities\nGender\nAge (years)\nRace/ethnicity\nEducation\nFederal poverty level (FPL)\nFamily income at or\nbelow FPL\nSample size and population proportions that are nationally represen-\ntative are shown.

Summary of the new findings from the\ncurrent study is shown in Table 5.\nOn the patients' side, the current study showed\nthat adherence to sodium and alcohol consumption\nreduction were greater than that to either exercise or\nweight control. One possible explanation for the\ndivergence in the adherence rates is that sodium and\nalcohol consumption reduction require less time\nand effort than weight control and exercise. The\nargument of `ease of execution' has multiple facets\nin addition to time consumption: the cost, complex-\nity of regimen, behavioural incentives and specifi-\ncity. Several previous studies have shed some light\non these regards. One study noted that cost and\ntransportation contributed to nonadherence to\nweight control and exercise.21 In addition, patients'\nhealth beliefs may have played an important role.\nFor example, one study demonstrated that greater\nperceived seriousness of diabetes was associated\nwith greater reduction in BMI at 1 year.22 Also, a\nsimple recommendation of exercise may not be\nsufficient to induce behavioural changes because\nexercise or weight control may be too broad or\nambiguous a concept for patients to follow. For\ninstance, in examining exercise in multiple short\nbouts vs one continuous bout in a randomized trial,\nresearchers found that adherence was significantly\ngreater among subjects who exercised in multiple\nshort bouts per day.23\nOne possible explanation for the nonsignificant\neffect of weight status in predicting adherence is\nthat the actual weight status derived from BMI is not\na good measure in explaining adherence behaviours.\nIt may be that how a patient perceives his or her\nweight status rather than the objective BMI deter-\nmines adherence behaviour. We performed the same\nanalyses shown in Table 4, substituting perceived\nweight status for the objectively measured BMI. The\nsubjects were asked `Do you consider yourself now\nto be overweight, underweight, or about the right\nweight?' Similar results were obtained using the two\ndifferent measurements of weight status.\nThe estimated prevalence rate (including pre-\nhypertension) was 57.0% among US adults. In\ncontrast, a previous study using the same data\ncalculated a prevalence rate of 28.7%, in which\nonly Stages I and II hypertension were included.24\nAlso, because the LM recommendation and adher-\nence data were only available among patients who\nwere aware of their hypertension, we were unable to\nidentify the patterns among subjects who were not\naware of their hypertension. As Table 2 shows, the\nvast majority of the subjects who were unaware of\ntheir hypertension had prehypertension and were\nnot using antihypertensives. Consequently, the\nresults from our multivariate analyses were probably\nmore applicable to patients who were on antihyper-\ntensives and those with Stages I and II hypertension.\nIt should be noted that due to the retrospective\nnature of the study, we were unable to include some\nfactors that may affect adherence, for example, the\ntype of exercise recommended by physicians, the\nlevel of alcohol consumption regarded as desirable\nand whether the subject consulted with a dietitian.\nFurthermore, self-reported adherence measures\nwere used. Consequently, the measures were subject\nto possible recall failure and biases associated with\ncertain patient characteristics. Also, for some sub-\njects, BMI may not reflect the true adiposity in the\nclassification of weight status.\nIn summary, the current study demonstrated that\nalthough physicians took into consideration pa-\ntients' weight status in their recommendations of\nlifestyle modifications in hypertension manage-\nment, patients' adherence did not follow this\npattern. In particular, obese patients who probably\nwould benefit most from weight control and exercise\nwere not more likely to adhere than normal/under-\nweight patients. More aggressive approaches should\nbe taken by the physicians to educate obese patients\nabout the benefits of lifestyle modifications in\nTable 5 Summary of the findings\nPrevious studies founda\n1.
