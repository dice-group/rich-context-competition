The\ndiscrepancies between parental reporting and the medi-\ncal records in this study may be attributed to 2 factors--\ninaccurate recall and incomplete medical records. Al-\nthough the medical record is intended to be the complete\nsource of a child's health care services use history, medi-\ncal records may not have complete information for care\nprovided at all sites. This may be due to children seeking\ncare at other health care facilities or with other physi-\ncians, and the documentation of this care not being sent\nto the child's primary care physician to be included in the\nmedical record.3 Also ED visits may not be included in the\nmedical record owing to separate information systems that\nexist within the same health care institution.\nOne hypothesis of our study is that maternal recall is\ngreater for hospitalizations than it is for ED use. Our find-\nings show substantial agreement was found for hospi-\ntalizations since birth at both the 2- to 4-month and the\n30- to 33-month surveys while s calculated for ED vis-\nits since birth at the 2- to 4-month survey also showed\nsubstantial agreement but not at the 30- to 33-month sur-\nvey. These results suggest that parents have greater re-\ncall of hospitalizations than ED visits, likely because of\nthe increased acuity of a hospitalization as well as the\ntrauma of the child not being at home.21 Based on pre-\nvious studies, it is reasonable to assume that recall de-\npends on the seriousness of an event,10 supporting our\nhypothesis.\nWe were interested in examining if mothers had greater\nrecall of acute health care events when their child was 2\nto 4 months old than when their child was 30 to 33\nmonths old. Analyses showed that beyond chance agree-\nment decreased with increasing age of the child. Other\nstudies suggest that recall depends on the recency of an\nhospitalizations and ED visits), the greater the parental\nreporting and recall relative to the medical record. Moth-\ners in our sample seem to be likely to remember the more\nacute and recent health care event when the child was\nan infant. Other studies on parental recall of hospital-\nizations similarly suggest that acute health care events\nin an infant are imprinted in the parent's memory while\ntime may blur the details and events, and they may be\nconfused with other episodes of health care use.1,19\nOlder mothers in our study had greater recall of hos-\npitalizations than did younger mothers when their chil-\ndren were infants. This finding is contrary to those of Pless\nand Pless10 who found that younger mothers rather than\nolder mothers recalled more accurately. In our study,\nmothers with higher incomes and more children also had\ngreater recall of recent hospitalizations than mothers for\nwhom this was their first child. This finding is also con-\ntrary to the findings from Pless and Pless10 who found\nthat mothers with fewer children had better recall of hos-\npitalizations. No differences in recall were seen by ma-\nternal characteristics for ED use and hospitalizations re-\nWe hypothesized that mothers in the study reporting\ndepressive symptoms overreport acute health care use\nmore often than mothers without depressive symp-\ntoms. Recent studies have shown that maternal depres-\nsive symptoms are significantly associated with chil-\ndren's acute health care use.27-31 Bartlett et al27 reported\nthat mothers with depressive symptoms were 30% more\nlikely to report ED use than mothers without depressive\nsymptoms. Similarly, Minkovitz et al29 demonstrated that\nmaternal depressive symptoms at 2 to 4 months were as-\nsociated with a 1.4 increased odds of ED visits in the pre-\nceding year among toddlers. Guttmann et al31 reported\nthat maternal depressive symptoms were significantly as-\nsociated with the risk of hospitalization in children aged\nevated depressive symptoms in mothers were related to\nboth missed pediatric outpatient visits and greater use\nof pediatric ED services. Chung et al30 found that moth-\ners with persistent depressive symptoms were nearly 3\ntimes as likely to have their child hospitalized in the first\nyear of life than mothers without depressive symptoms.\nSixteen percent of mothers in our study reported hav-\ning depressive symptoms at 2 to 4 months and at 30 to\n33 months. Beyond chance agreement was similar for\nmothers with and without depressive symptoms at both\ntime points. Analysis of the frequency of children's hos-\npitalizations at both surveys indicated no differential re-\nporting of acute health care use by depressive symp-\ntoms. Similar analysis of frequency of ED visits by\ndepressive symptoms at both surveys suggests more com-\nplete reporting by mothers than the medical records. This\nis consistent with children likely receiving ED care at mul-\ntiple sites and incomplete primary care records.\nDespite the large sample size and the availability of re-\npeated measurements of health care use from interviews\nand medical records, the study has a few limitations that\nmay not make the results generalizable. Families in this\nsample participated in the study for approximately 3 years\nand had the same source of primary care for 30 months.\nThus, mothers in this study are more likely to be aware of\nhealth care use, and their children may have more com-\nplete medical records than mothers whose children do not\nhave a consistent source of medical care. Additionally, an\nevaluation of the severity of the health conditions for the\nhospitalizations and ED visits was not conducted to de-\ntermine if maternal recall of their children's hospitaliza-\ntions and ED visits differed by acuity of the conditions.\nAlso, we were unable to do a more refined analysis of the\nduration of recall as to when specifically hospitalizations\nand ED visits occurred.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results of our study suggest that maternal reporting\nis a complete source of information of event occurrence\nfrom household surveys and that maternal reporting does\nnot differ substantially from the information available from\nthe medical records especially for acute health care events\noccurring when the child is an infant. Accuracy of infor-\nmation on acute health care events may be affected by du-\nrationofrecallandmaternalagebutlesssobyparity,house-\nhold income, and maternal depressive symptoms.\nCorrespondence: Cynthia S.

Strobino, PhD\nBackground: National household surveys often rely on\nparents' recall to assess children's use of health care ser-\nvices. However, little is known about the accuracy of pa-\nrental reporting of hospitalizations and emergency de-\npartment (ED) use.\nObjectives: To assess the agreement between maternal\nreported and medical record acute health care data for chil-\ndren younger than 3 years and to determine if agreement\nbetween the 2 varies by maternal characteristics.\nDesign and Methods: Data were obtained from the\nnational evaluation of the Healthy Steps for Young Chil-\ndren for 2937 families who completed parent inter-\ndren's medical records were abstracted. Services assessed\nincluded hospitalizations and ED visits since birth (2-4\nmonths). Absolute and beyond chance agreements were\ncalculated. Results were stratified by maternal age (20,\n$50000), and the presence or absence of maternal de-\npressive symptoms.\nResults: Absolute agreement was high for hospitaliza-\ntions (90%) at both time points. It was high for ED use\n(90%) only at 2 to 4 months. Beyond chance agree-\nment was higher for hospitalizations than for ED use at\ndeclined with increased duration of recall and younger\nmaternal age. No differences were found by other ma-\nternal characteristics.\nConclusions: Mothers have good recall for acute health\ncare events during the first 3 years of their children's lives.\nThis finding suggests that mothers are a good source of\ninformation regarding children's acute health care use.\na common outcome mea-\nsure in children's health\nservices research.1 - 3\nKnowledge about inpa-\ntient hospitalizations and emergency de-\npartment (ED) visits informs researchers\nand policy makers about access to health\ncare, quality of care, and health care use\nexpenditures.2 Overuse of acute health care\noften reflects limited access to primary\ncare, inefficient use of health care dol-\nlars, and, thus, wasted resources.2,3 Spe-\ncifically, use of the ED for nonurgent care4,5\nand ambulatory-care-sensitive hospital-\nizations6,7 are 2 indicators of reduced ac-\ncess to primary care. Thus, accurate in-\nformation about acute health care use is\nimportant.\nUse may be measured through admin-\nistrative records, medical record audits, or\nsurveys. Administrative data sources of-\nten are restricted to single payers or insti-\ntutions and may not reflect usage experi-\nence of children with changing insurance\nand multiple sites of care.3 Although medi-\ncal records are often considered the \"gold\nstandard\" for measurement of health care\nuse,1,8,9 there are several potential prob-\nlems. They include the cost and time as-\nsociated with abstracting medical rec-\nords, especially in large studies; the use of\nmultiple service providers by some pa-\ntients necessitating access to records from\nmultiple sources; and the reality that some\nvisits, especially visits to specialists and to\nEDs, may not be reported in the primary\nSurveydataabouthealthcareuseareless\nexpensivetoobtainandarelikelytobemore\ninclusive of all sources of health care use.\nQuestions arise, however, as to whether\nthese self-reports are accurate.1,10 The qual-\nity of this information depends on the abil-\nity to remember and to report accurately.\nMany population-based surveys includ-\ning the National Health Interview Sur-\nvey, National Survey of American Fami-\nFor editorial comment\nAuthor Affiliation: Department\nof Population and Family\nHealth Sciences, The Johns\nHopkins Bloomberg School of\nPublic Health, Baltimore, Md.\n\u00a92005 American Medical Association.

Because surveys\ncollecting health information on the child depend on the\nability of a parent to recall and report on a wide range of\nmedical conditions with which they may have little fa-\nmiliarity, the quality of those reports is uncertain.8 Many\npediatric studies are solely based on parents' retrospec-\nStudies of the validity of parental reports of their chil-\ndren's use of health care have mixed results. For immu-\nnization histories, results suggest that mothers are inad-\nequate informants,13-18 while studies on recall of children's\nbirth weight found good recall.19,20 Good recall was also\nfound for receipt of mental health services,21 receipt of\nchronic care services,8 and occurrence of otitis media.11\nMany previous studies of maternal recall, however, ex-\namined only a single event such as birth weight,19,20 vac-\nedge, there are no recent studies that have examined\nparental reporting of their children's acute health care use.\nMost prior literature regarding agreement between self-\nreport and medical records for health care use has fo-\ncused on senior citizens.22,23 However, findings from stud-\nies that have examined recall in elderly populations may\nnot pertain to children. Children are different because\nthey are dependent on adults for their health care use,\nand adults are the proxy respondents used to collect chil-\ndren's health care use data.3 Moreover, children tend to\nhave fewer acute health care events than adults.3\nIn general, prior research has shown that reporting ac-\ncuracy is affected by the characteristics of the child, acu-\nity of the illness, type of health care service, and respon-\ndifferences (underreporting or overreporting) in recall\nbased on seriousness of health events, income, ages of\nthe parent and child, number of siblings, gender, edu-\ncational attainment of the parents, duration of recall, type\nof service used, and the relation of the respondent to the\nindex subject. Kosa et al12 found that the younger the age\nof the child, the more accurate the health care service re-\nport by the parents. Daly et al11 found that the more se-\nvere the health condition, the more accurate were pa-\nrental reports of the details of health care service\nexperiences. Research also suggests that the frequency\nof child health care service encounters as well as their\nrecency positively affects reporting accuracy.14,19 Hawe\net al16 found that parents with lower educational levels\nand parents with more children in the household tend\nto provide less accurate reports of child health care ser-\nvice encounters.\nPrior studies, however, have not examined whether\nmaternal mental health influences the accuracy of re-\nporting of children's acute health care services use. Ma-\nternal depressive symptoms have been documented to\nhave negative influences on parenting practices includ-\ning health care seeking for their children.26-31 It is pos-\nsible that poor maternal mental health could lead to over-\nreporting of a child's receipt of acute health care services,\nthus, accounting for the observed findings. A meta analy-\nsis by Richters32 determined that depressed mothers re-\nliably report on their children's behavior problems; how-\never, they did not examine the influence of maternal\nmental health on reporting on children's acute health care\nuse. Determining the accuracy of maternal reporting is\nneeded to understand the previously reported associa-\ntions between maternal depressive symptoms and chil-\nThe objective of this article is to assess the agreement\nbetween maternal reports and medical records for chil-\ndren from birth to 3 years of age for hospitalizations and\nED use. The study also examines whether agreement var-\nies with the type of acute care (hospitalizations vs ED vis-\nits), period of recall, or maternal demographic and health\ncharacteristics. We hypothesized that (1) maternal report-\ning for acute health care use is as complete a source of in-\nformation as medical record data; (2) maternal recall is\nmore complete for hospitalizations than it is for ED use;\n(3) mothers have greater recall of acute health care events\nwhen their child is 2 to 4 months old than when their child\nis 30 to 33 months old; and (4) mothers reporting depres-\nsive symptoms overreport acute health care use relative\nto mothers without depressive symptoms.\nThis study relied on data collected for the National\nEvaluation of Healthy Steps for Young Children.
