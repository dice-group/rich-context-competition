The objectives of this study were to estimate the national\nseroprevalence and evaluate predictors of HPV-11 seropositivity.\nStudy Design: We tested serum samples for HPV-11 antibodies\nand analyzed questionnaire data from the second phase of the\nSeroprevalence estimates were weighted to represent the US pop-\nulation.\nResults: Overall seroprevalence of HPV-11 infection was 4.7%.\nSeroprevalence was significantly higher among females (5.7%) than\namong males (3.6%). Independent predictors of HPV-11 seropositivity\nincluded sex, race/ethnicity, lifetime number of sex partners, educa-\ntion, and HPV-16 seropositivity.\nConclusion: This study represents the most comprehensive picture\nof HPV-11 infection in the United States to date, and provides baseline\ndata on the prevalence of HPV-11 before availability of the quadriva-\nlent HPV vaccine.\nHUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUSES (HPVs) are a heterogeneous\ngroup of nonenveloped DNA viruses that infect the skin and\nmucous membranes of human hosts. To date, at least 100 geneti-\ncally distinct HPV types have been identified, over 40 of which\ninfect the genital areas.1 HPV infection is ubiquitous, and genital\nHPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the\nUnited States.2,3 However, quantifying the prevalence of genital\nHPVs nationally has been difficult because the majority of HPV\ninfections are asymptomatic4\u00ad6 and most infections clear within 2\nyears of infection.7,8 Although not all infected individuals develop\ndetectable levels of antibodies to HPV, serologic measurements\ncan be used to evaluate cumulative exposure to HPV at the\npopulation level.8,9\nThe global incidence and prevalence of oncogenic HPV types\nhave been well described in several studies, mostly in the\ncontext of cervical cancer, over 70% of which is associated with\nincluding a population-based investigation of HPV-16 sero-\nprevalence in the United States.9,11\u00ad18 Less is known about the\nseroepidemiology of nononcogenic HPV types 6 and 11, which\ntogether are responsible for over 90% of anogenital warts\nnearly all cases of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP), a\nrare but life-threatening disease,18,21\u00ad23 and are responsible for\nthe majority of nononcogenic HPV-related morbidity and asso-\nciated health care costs.24 \u00ad28 Data on the proportional distribu-\ntion of types 6 and 11 in genital warts as well as RRP are\nlimited because many studies used methods that did not distin-\nguish between these 2 closely related types that occur with high\nprevalence in both conditions. Data from a few investigations\nhave demonstrated that HPV-11 accounts for 8\u00ad30% of genital\nwarts worldwide.19,29 \u00ad31 In the juvenile-onset form of RRP, in\nwhich vertical transmission from infected mother to child is the\nciated with a more aggressive clinical course.23\nA prophylactic HPV vaccine directed against HPV types 6,\n11, 16, and 18 has been shown in clinical trials to have high\nefficacy in females for prevention of infections and clinical\nvaccine was approved by the FDA in June 2006 for use in\nyoung women between the ages of 9 and 26 years.33 If appro-\npriately implemented, the current recommendation to routinely\nvaccinate 11- to 12-year-old adolescent girls35 could have a\nsubstantial impact on vaccine type HPV-related clinical out-\ncomes.\nThe objective of this study was to determine the seropreva-\nlence of HPV-11 infection in the general US population of ages\n6 to 59 years. Additionally, the study aimed to describe patterns\nof HPV-11 seropositivity, and presumably infection, in various\nsubpopulations and to characterize associated risk factors. Re-\nsults were obtained from a national seroepidemiologic survey of\nHPV-11 infection performed on surplus serum samples from the\nsecond phase of the third National Health and Nutrition Exam-\nCorrespondence: Susan Hariri, PhD, Centers for Disease Control and\nshariri@cdc.gov.\nDisclaimer: The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the\nauthors and do not necessarily represent the views of the funding agency.\nFrom the *National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and\nTB Prevention, and National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne\nand Enteric Diseases, Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases,\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia\nCopyright \u00a9 2008, American Sexually Transmitted Diseases Association\nAll rights reserved.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy Population and Design\nNHANES are cross-sectional national surveys conducted by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention, conducted as period surveys until 1994\nand redesigned as a continuous annual survey since 1999.\nNHANES are designed to provide national estimates on the health\nand nutritional status of the US civilian noninstitutionalized pop-\nulation. Consenting participants have household interviews and\nphysical examinations and phlebotomy in mobile examination\ncenters. The surveys use a stratified multistage probability cluster\ndesign to select a representative sample of the US civilian nonin-\nstitutionalized population aged 2 months or older in 50 states.\nphases. Children aged 5, adults aged 60, Mexican Americans,\nand non-Hispanic African Americans were sampled at a higher\nrate compared to other demographic groups to allow sufficient\nsizes for analysis of the groups. Poverty index was calculated\naccording to the US Census definition by dividing total family\nincome by the poverty threshold after adjusting for family size at\nthe time of interview. Persons residing in a county in a metropol-\nitan area were classified as \"urban\" while all others were defined\nas \"nonurban.\" Limited sexual history information was asked of\nyears provided more detailed sexual behavior information.

Surplus serum\nsamples were available for 8102 participants, which comprised\n85% of the total interviewed and 91% of those examined.\nLaboratory Methods\nWe used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to\ndetect HPV-11 IgG antibodies in serum samples. Viruslike parti-\ncles (VLPs) were produced by expression of an HPV-11 L1\nrecombinant baculovirus in insect cells (gift from Dr. Robert Rose,\nTABLE 1.

These sera were then used as\nindividual high positive and negative controls and also to prepare\npools of high positive, low positive, and negative serum controls to\nstandardize the ELISA. Five individual controls and 3 pooled\ncontrols were used on each plate. Quality control assessment\nincluded monitor of day-to-day and plate-to-plate variation using\nLevy-Jennings plots. Results for individual control serum samples\nthat were run throughout the course of the NHANES III analysis\nwere used in receiver operating characteristic analysis to determine\nthe ELISA cutoff value for discrimination between positive and\nnegative samples.\nStatistical Analysis\nSUDAAN software version 9.0 was used for all statistical\nanalyses to incorporate the sampling weights and account for\nthe nonrandom cluster design in calculating the variance esti-\nmates based on a Taylor series approximation. All seropreva-\nlence estimates were weighted to represent the total US civilian\nnoninstitutionalized population and to account for oversam-\npling and nonresponse to the household interview and physical\nexamination. We estimated HPV-11 seroprevalence overall and\nby various demographic categories. Bivariate significance tests\nfor association were based on a Wald 2 statistic. The confi-\ndence intervals for the prevalence estimates were calculated on\nthe basis of the log transformation with standard errors of the\nlog prevalence calculated using the  method.39 Critical values\nused for the confidence intervals were based on the t-distribu-\ntion with the degrees of freedom as number of strata minus the\nnumber of primary sampling units, which in most cases was a\ntotal of 23 degrees of freedom. No adjustments for multiple\ncomparisons were made to P values.\nThe association of age with HPV-11 was examined in bivariate\nlogistic regression with age as a 6-level categorical variable (6\u00ad11,\nmidpoints versus the  coefficients of that category from the\nmodels showed a nonlinear association in both sexes. We inves-\ntigated the presence of an upward linear trend in females less than\n39 years old and a downward linear trend among females older\nthan 40 years, using age as a continuous variable in separate\nlogistic regression models as suggested by the data. Likewise, we\nexamined presence of an increasing linear trend in males up to 49\nyears. A trend was considered statistically significant if the \ncoefficient of age in the model was nonzero at P 0.05 using the\nSatterthwaite adjusted F test.\nWe used logistic regression analysis to identify independent\npredictors of HPV-11 seropositivity in participants 17 to 59 years\nold.40 Any variable with a statistically significant Wald 2 statistic\nat P  0.10 on bivariate analysis was included in the initial\nmodels. Age was modeled as a continuous variable and evaluated\nfor the possibility of a nonlinear association with HPV-11 sero-\nprevalence. Using a backward elimination strategy, parameters\ndetermined to be statistically significant with the Satterthwaite\nadjusted F-test P  0.05 were retained in the main effects model.\nData-based confounding was assessed for variables that were\ndropped in the backwards elimination steps. If a dropped variable\nwas responsible for a change of 20% in the  parameter estimate\nof the main effects variables, the variable was retained in the\nmodel to adjust for confounding irrespective of statistical signifi-\ncance. Finally, all pairwise interactions between variables in the\nfinal model after assessing for confounding were evaluated. Pair-\nwise interactions significant with a Satterthwaite adjusted F-test\nResults\noverall seroprevalence of HPV-11 among persons 6 to 59 years in\nwas significantly higher in female (5.7%) than in male participants\n(3.6%) overall (P  0.04) and remained higher in females across\nall age and race categories (Table 1). Overall, HPV-11 seropreva-\nlence was highest among females in the 30- to 39-year age group\n(6.3%), whereas it peaked among males in the 40- to 49-year age\ngroup (5.7%). There was a significant increasing trend in sero-\nprevalence for females 6 to 39 years and males 6 to 49 years\nfollowed by nonsignificant declines through age 59 in both males\nand females (Fig. 1). Seroprevalence also differed significantly by\nself-identified racial category. Overall, prevalence was highest\namong non-Hispanic African Americans (8.8%), more than double\nthe prevalence in Mexican Americans (4.3%) and non-Hispanic\nwhites (3.8%). A similar proportional trend was observed among\nracial categories when stratified by sex with African Americans\nAge, years\n% Seroprevalence\nMales\nFemales\nFig. 1. Weighted seroprevalence of\nHPV-11 among males and females by age\nhaving high rates of infection in both males and females. The\nprevalence of HPV-11 was much higher in African American\nfemales (12.6%) than African American males (4.5%). Geographic\nanalysis of seropositivity did not reveal any regional differences.\nHowever, urban residents were significantly more likely to be\nseropositive (5.7%) than those living in nonurban areas (3.7%)\nnationwide, particularly among males. The overall seroprevalence\nof HPV-11 was significantly higher among people living below\npoverty level (6.6%) compared to those living at or above poverty\n(4.3%) and the trend remained the same when stratified by sex.\nHPV-16 seropositivity was also significantly associated with\nHPV-11 seropositivity and the pattern was the same in both males\nand females. Overall, a total of 171 participants tested positive for\nboth infections, which represents 1.2% of the entire population\nBehavioral characteristics significantly associated with HPV-11\nseropositivity included age at first sexual intercourse, lifetime\nnumber of sexual partners, and ever use of cocaine and marijuana\n(Table 2). Five male and 10 female respondents with no reported\nhistory of sexual intercourse were found to be HPV-11 seroposi-\ntive. Almost all (n  14) of these 15 individuals were also\nseropositive for another sexually transmitted infection, herpes sim-\nplex virus 2 (HSV-2). One female was of missing HSV-2 status\nand could not be evaluated. The seroepidemiology of HSV-2 in\nthis population has been described in detail elsewhere.41\nIn the multiple logistic regression model, statistically signif-\nicant predictors of HPV-11 infection included female gender,\nAfrican American race, increasing number of lifetime sexual\npartners, less than high school education, and HPV-16 coinfec-\nTABLE 2.

Urban residence and drug use did not remain\nsignificant in the final model. Socioeconomic status as mea-\nsured by living below or above the poverty level marginally\nconfounded the association between HPV-11 and race, but the\ndifference was not statistically significant and did not affect any\nof the estimates. Therefore, poverty level was not included in\nthe model. We found no other confounding or effect modifica-\ntion, and thus no other variables were included in the model.\nDiscussion\nThis study is the first to describe the seroprevalence and distri-\nbution of HPV-11 infection in the United States. Our results\nindicate that the odds of HPV-11 seropositivity were over 2 times\nhigher among females compared to males. This observed sex\ndifference is not surprising given inherent immunologic and ana-\ntomical differences between males and females that are well\nknown to result in differential susceptibility to most sexually\ntransmitted infections.42 Results of a study of genital warts among\nthat \"women were three times more likely to report having a\nhistory of genital warts than men,\" supporting our findings.43\nMoreover, seroprevalences of other genital HPVs have also been\nreported to be significantly higher in females compared to\nbeen reported to have similar sex distributions. However, the\nresults from this study are not directly comparable to the reported\nprevalence of anogenital warts, particularly data derived from\ngenital warts claims submitted by privately insured patients who\nmay not be representative of the general US population. Our\nresults indicate that HPV-11 seroprevalence is much higher in both\nmale and female non-Hispanic African Americans, a racial cate-\ngory that is likely underrepresented in the insurance claim data.\nAlthough our data suggest that the prevalence of HPV-11 is only\nslightly lower among people who reported never having sex com-\npared to those who reported ever having sex (4.4% vs. 5.5%,\nrespectively), these results must be interpreted with caution. Only\n15 respondents seropositive for HPV-11 reported never having had\nsex. This small number leads to an unstable and therefore unin-\nterpretable estimate. Moreover, upon closer examination of the 15\nrespondents, we found that at least 14 were herpes simplex virus\ntype 2 seropositive. Presence of 2 different sexually transmitted\ninfections in this group may be an indication that the respondents\neither did not understand the sexual history questions or did not\nfeel comfortable answering questions related to sexual history.\nThere was a significant trend for increasing HPV-11 seropreva-\nlence up to 39 years of age in females and 49 years in males.\nThereafter, HPV-11 appeared to decline although the downward\ntrend was not found to be significant. This observed pattern sug-\ngests that the risk of HPV-11 infection begins as a person becomes\nsexually active and increases through the third decade in females\nand the fourth decade in males, after which it appears to gradually\ndecline. Although we did not find significant decreases in sero-\nprevalence in either males or females, the observed decrease may\neither represent a cohort effect such that older persons may have\nbeen less likely to be exposed to HPV-11 or a loss of antibodies to\nthe virus over time.\nAs expected, we found the overall prevalence of HPV-11 (4.7%)\nto be lower than that previously reported for HPV-16 in the same\npopulation (13%).9 However, results of this study suggest that\nHPV-11 is a common sexually transmitted infection.\nOther factors that were found to be independently associated\nwith HPV-11 in the current study include nonwhite race (espe-\ncially non-Hispanic African American race) and number of life-\ntime sex partners. About the latter, the data indicate that HPV-11\nseroprevalence increases commensurate with increasing number of\nlifetime sex partners.\nThis study has some limitations. First, sexual behavior and\nother risk factors are self-reported and thus subject to reporting\nbias, including underreporting of risk factors. Second, use of\nserologic testing may underestimate infection with HPV-11\ngiven the low rate of seroconversion after natural infection. In\naddition, while type-specific VLPs were used in the ELISA,\ncross-reactivity between closely related types, particularly\nHPV-6, cannot be excluded. Despite limitations, however, se-\nrology is currently the best approach to ascertaining exposure in\nthe population. Finally, due to lack of HPV-6 VLPs required for\ntesting specimens, we were unable to evaluate the seropreva-\nlence of HPV-6 in this population.\nThe results of this study represent the most comprehensive\npicture of HPV-11 infection in the United States to date. Impor-\ntantly, this study provides baseline data on the prevalence of\nHPV-11 before availability of a prophylactic vaccine against HPV\nation of the impact of this vaccine on this common infection.\nReferences\n1.
