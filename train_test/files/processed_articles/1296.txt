The model was applied to 6,265 NHANES III adults aged 45\u00ad74 years. The prevalence\nof risk factors in NHANES III, fielded in 1988\u00ad1994, better represents today's adults.\nRESULTS -- For all NHANES III adults aged 45\u00ad74 years, a diagnosis of diabetes accounted\n1994. For people with diabetes, diabetes alone was responsible for 43.4% of hospitalizations,\n52.1% of nursing home admissions, and 47% of deaths. Adjusting for related cardiovascular\nconditions, which may provide more accurate estimates of attributable risks for people with\nCONCLUSIONS -- Risks of institutionalization and death attributable to diabetes are large.\nEfforts to translate recent trials of primary prevention into practice and continued efforts to\nprevent complications of diabetes could have a substantial impact on hospitalizations, nursing\nhome admissions, and deaths and their societal costs.\nThe prevalence of diabetes, 8.7% in\nsurvival due to better treatment has\ncontributed to higher prevalence, the\nsharpest increase has occurred among\npeople aged 30\u00ad39 years, indicating that\nincidence is also rising. Growing numbers\nof people are thus at risk of diabetes com-\nplications, particularly cardiovascular\ndisease (2), and the disability and death\nthat accompany them. Recent trials (3\u00ad9)\nhave shown that diabetes complications\ncan be prevented or delayed by new inter-\nventions for hyperglycemia, hyperten-\nsion, and hyperlipidemia. Other trials in\nhigh-risk populations have suggested that\nlifestyle interventions may delay or pre-\nAs background for prevention and\ncontrol efforts, this report presents new\nestimates of all-cause hospitalizations,\nnursing home admissions, and deaths at-\ntributable to diabetes. We used a method-\nology based on the first and third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nveys (NHANES), two of the surveys that\nprovide data for national health goals and\nclinical guidelines. Epidemiological\nmethodologists note that cohort studies\nare more reliable than cross-sectional data\nfor establishing the existence and magni-\ntude of etiologic relationships (13\u00ad14).\nWe used the NHANES I Epidemiologic\nFollowup Study (NHEFS), a cohort study\nthat tracked outcomes over 2 decades\nmodel that projects diabetes outcomes.\nWe applied the simulation model to\nbetter represents today's adults (e.g.,\nmore obesity, fewer smokers). Our meth-\nodology allowed us to make estimates for\ndiabetes alone and for diabetes together\nwith major cardiovascular risk factors\nthat cluster with diabetes. The estimates\ncontribute to a more complete picture of\ndiabetes' impact on the population as a\nwhole and on people with diabetes.\nMETHODS -- The NHANES, large\nnational surveys conducted by the Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics, collect\nhealth information for representative\nsamples of noninstitutionalized Ameri-\ncans.

Deaths were confirmed by death\ncertificate. The simulation model is ap-\nyears to estimate the attributable risks of\ndiabetes.\nThe simulation model has four com-\nponents: the cohort dataset, which con-\ntains baseline information about\nmortality submodel, which projects all-\ncause mortality; and the hospitalization\nand nursing home submodels, which\nproject admissions. Each submodel uses\nseparate regressions, estimated from\nolder than 74. The multivariable regres-\nsions relate admissions and mortality to\nall clinical risk factors shown by multiple\nstudies to be statistically significantly re-\nlated to disease and/or death (Table 1).\nThe effects of diabetes in the model are\nthus its net effects after adjustment for the\neffects of all other risk factors. Diabetes is\na statistically significant determinant of all\nthree outcomes.\nNHANES I defined diabetes as\npresent if an adult reported having re-\nceived a doctor's diagnosis of diabetes\n(fasting blood glucose was not measured).\nType 2 diabetes, which accounts for 90\u00ad\n95% of diabetes, was not distinguished\nfrom type 1.

In addition to eliminating diabetes\n(scenario 1), scenario 2 set the means of\nsystolic blood pressure, total cholesterol,\nand rates of heart attack, heart failure, and\nstroke in diabetic people equal to those in\npeople without diabetes. Since diabetes\nclusters with these risk factors, scenario 2\nmay more closely approximate the true\nattributable risks of diabetes. In people\nwith diabetes, percentages of hospitaliza-\ntions and deaths attributable to diabetes\nincreased by 8 to 10 percentage points to\ndiovascular conditions were equalized.\nThe attributable percentage of nursing\nhome admissions increased 5 percentage\npoints.\nCONCLUSIONS -- We have pre-\nsented new estimates of the risks of hos-\npitalization, nursing home admission,\nand all-cause mortality attributable to di-\nabetes based on the NHANES I Epidemi-\nologic Follow-up Study and NHANES III.\nFor the population aged 45\u00ad74 years as a\nwhole, diagnosed diabetes accounted for\n12.3% of nursing home admissions, and\n10.3% of deaths. The percentages were\nlower for older people than middle-aged\npeople, but absolute reductions in event\nrates were similar or greater because of\ntheir higher rates. Nursing home admis-\nsions, disproportionately an experience\nof old age, showed the greatest effect of\ndiabetes.\nFor people with diabetes, the percent-\nages were naturally much larger: 43% of\nhospital admissions, 52% of nursing\nhome admissions, and 47% of deaths due\nto diabetes. The percentages remained\nlarge in the 10th year, and absolute reduc-\ntions were larger for all age-sex groups\nand all outcomes than in year 1. The at-\ntenuated effects in the overall population\nat year 10 are explained by higher mortal-\nity among diabetic people due to their\nhigher rates of other chronic conditions.\nAdjusting for factors that cluster with\ndiabetes and are part of the metabolic syn-\ndrome (higher blood pressure and choles-\nterol, higher rates of heart attack, heart\nfailure, and stroke) increased the risks at-\ntributable to diabetes by 8 to 10 percent-\nage points for hospitalizations and deaths\nbut less for nursing home admissions.\nThese adjustments corrected for condi-\ntions associated with diabetes that were\ndiagnosed at baseline in NHANES III\nadults.\nBesides showing substantial health\nbenefits from controlling or preventing\ndiabetes, these estimates represent medi-\ncal resources that would not be used if\ndiabetes were prevented. Studies (19\u00ad24)\nshow that people with diabetes have\nhigher medical costs than nondiabetic\npeople. Most analyzed data for enrollees\nin a single managed care plan and mea-\nsured services as a step toward estimating\ncosts. The hospitalization and nursing\nhome estimates that underlie the cost es-\ntimates of the ADA are closest to those\npresented here (25). The ADA used an\nattributable-risk methodology, for the\nU.S. population, and defined diabetes\nbased on a doctor's diagnosis.\nThe methodology used in this report\nhas several advantages. It used two linked\nnationally representative datasets rather\nthan multiple datasets as the ADA did to\nestimate effects of diabetes on outcomes.\nIn estimating diabetes' effects, the meth-\nodology controlled not only for age, sex,\nand race but for numerous patient-level\ncharacteristics, including other risk fac-\nTable 4--Attributable risks of diabetes and diabetes plus cardiovascular conditions at year 1\nAll people People with diabetes\nRate % change Rate % change\n(2) Diabetes  0, cardiovascular\nconditions equalized*\nNursing home admissions per 1,000 people\n(2) Diabetes  0, cardiovascular\nconditions equalized*\n(2) Diabetes  0, cardiovascular\nconditions equalized*\n*In addition to setting diabetes equal to zero for all people with diabetes, blood pressure, cholesterol, and\nprevalence of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke are adjusted so that their means equal those for people\nwithout diabetes.\nRussell and Associates\ntors for cardiovascular disease. The data\nused for the projection equations were\nprospective and traced outcomes over 2\ndecades, providing a stronger basis for\ncorrectly measuring causal relationships\nthan cross-sectional data.\nThe estimates presented here agree in\nmagnitude with the ADA estimates, lend-\ning strength to their findings and suggest-\ning that diabetes itself is driving cross-\nsectional differences in costs. The ADA\nreported that hospital days attributable to\ndiabetes accounted for 9% of all hospital\ndays and nursing home days for 15% of all\nnursing home days, similar to the 8.6 and\n12.3% of admissions estimated here for\nestimated after adjustment for related car-\ndiovascular conditions. Overall, the ADA\nreported that diabetic people had more\nthan double the hospital inpatient and\nnursing home costs of nondiabetic peo-\nple, which implies that diabetes accounts\nfor 50% of the costs of diabetic people\nin these settings. Our estimates are for ad-\nmissions, not costs, but are in general\nagreement. In particular, our estimates for\ndiabetes plus related cardiovascular con-\ntions and 57.1% of nursing home\nadmissions.\nOur estimates have potential limita-\ntions. First, since our study measures the\nimpact of all diabetes, without differenti-\nating between types 1 and 2, it overstates\nthe impact of eliminating type 2; how-\never, the overstatement is modest since\ntes. Second, current treatment is more ef-\nand 1980s; hence, our baseline estimates\nmay overstate the current impact of dia-\nbetes. Finally, national trends in hospital\nadmissions during NHEFS follow-up sug-\ngested that our hospitalization projec-\ntions might be high. Hospitalization rates\nmeasured by the National Hospital Dis-\nthe early 1980s then fell until the early\nrose again for people aged 65 years\n(26). Rates for NHANES III adults should\nbe lower than NHDS rates because they\nwere drawn from the noninstitutionalized\npopulation; since they were able to travel\nto an examination site, they may have\nbeen even healthier than the general non-\ninstitutionalized population. To check\nthat our projected admission rates were\nreasonable, we compared year 1 projec-\nsame age-sex groups. As they should be,\nour projections were uniformly lower,\nOur results support the extensive\nwork documenting diabetes' adverse ef-\nfects by estimating its impact on hospital-\nizations, nursing home admissions, and\nmortality in a representative sample of\nolder U.S. adults. They suggest that efforts\nto generalize the Diabetes Prevention Pro-\ngram, for example through the \"Small\nSteps, Big Rewards\" campaign sponsored\nby the National Institutes of Health and\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention, could have a substantial impact\non diabetes-related outcomes. If diabetes\ncould be prevented completely, we esti-\nmate that rates of hospitalization, nursing\nhome admission, and death would fall by\nabout half for people spared diabetes, and\nthe beneficial effects would be sustained\nover 10 years. Our study offers another\ninsight into the value of efforts to prevent\nand control diabetes.\n"
