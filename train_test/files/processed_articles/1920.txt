This was true only for those\nwith fully independent ADL at baseline. Notably, once the\nfunctional status of the elderly declined from baseline and\nthey became dependent on others, the status of living alone\nwas no longer a significant predictor of the rate of future\ndecline. On the other hand, elderly who had a spouse,\nchildren or other relatives as caregivers were more likely to\nexperience a faster recovery and lower likelihood of death,\ncompared to those who were cared by unrelated live-in\ncaregivers. In addition, Chinese elderly with health insur-\nance had a lower likelihood of death than their counterparts\nlacking health insurance, among those with ADL at the\ndependent baseline.\nConclusions Although there has been a change in family\nstructure and living arrangements, the majority of Chinese\nelderly still rely on traditional forms of family support,\nespecially after acquiring dependency status. As the elderly\nhave different functional levels, healthcare policies in\nChina should consider the need for both community and\nfamily support systems.\n",

Populations in many countries including\nChina are aging, and change in family structure and living\narrangements of the elderly is apparent. Some studies [1, 2]\nbased on sampling data from censuses in China indicated\nthat Chinese families are turning from a traditional to a\nmodern structure. For example, an increase in people living\nalone, empty-nest households, and nuclear family house-\nholds has been observed, while multi-generational family\nhouseholds have decreased. In addition, growing indepen-\ndence of married couples from their older relatives,\ndemocratization of the family relationships, and socializa-\ntion of family functions have occurred, due to economic\ndevelopment, urbanization, and other sociological factors\nD.

These recent changes in critical demographic factors\nin China have therefore generated concern for improving the\nhealth status and living circumstances of the elderly.\nStudies conducted in western countries have shown that\nhousehold structure can affect the incidence of decline in\nfunctional status of the elderly. For example, a study\nconducted among urban, non-institutionalized individuals\nat least 65 years of age showed that elderly who lived with\nchildren and without spouses had worse health outcomes,\ncompared to elderly living alone [4]. Another study showed\nthat people who lived with a partner had lower morbidity\nrates than did people who lived alone; after controlling for\nthe effects of different living arrangements, the risks for all\nobjective measures of illness of the `never married', wid-\nowed and divorced were 40\u00ad70% less than the risks for\npeople who lived with a partner [5]. A more recent, pro-\nspective study of women with no severe impairment at a\nbaseline level suggested that those living alone were less\nlikely to experience a decline in functional status than were\nthose living with spouses or other people [6].\nAlthough a few studies have focused on changes in\nfamily support networks for the elderly in China [7], little\nis known regarding how the marital status, living\narrangements and healthcare issues may affect changes in\ntheir functional status. Understanding the influence of these\nfactors is likely to be useful in promoting family support\nnetworks and improving health of the elderly. The purpose\nof the current study is to determine whether changes in\nactivities of daily living (ADL) of Chinese elderly pos-\nsessing different baseline ADL levels can be explained\nby marital status, living arrangements and nature of\ncaregivers.\nMethods\nDatabase\nThe Chinese Longitudinal Health Longevity Study\nThe current study used the third and fourth waves (2002\nand 2005, respectively) of the CLHLS. The CLHLS was\nconducted in randomly selected 50% of the counties and\ncities in 22 provinces. The 22 surveyed provinces were:\nLiaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Beijing, Tianjing,\nShanxi, Shaanxi, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui,\nFujian, Jiangxi, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guang-\ndong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Chongqing, which have a\ntotal population of 985 million and represent 85% of the\ntotal population in China.\nThe CLHLS survey tried to interview all centenarians\nfrom the above counties and cities who voluntarily agreed\nto participate in the study. Starting with the third wave of\nthe CLHLS in 2002, for each centenarian, the surveyed\nelderly included subjects in an age range of 65\u00ad79, one\noctogenarian (i.e., 80\u00ad89 years of age) and one nonage-\nnarian (i.e., 90\u00ad99 years of age) of a pre-designated age\nand gender who lived nearby. ``Nearby'' was loosely\ndefined as the same street, village, town, city, or county.\nThe predefined age and gender used to identify approxi-\nmately equal numbers of male and female in each age\ngroup were randomly determined, based on the code\nnumbers of the centenarians. One goal of the CLHLS was\nto have comparable numbers of male and female of each\nThe CLHLS in 2002 comprised a total sample size of\nwere aged 100 years and above. The follow-up survey\nwere interviewed in the follow-up, and for 4,111 deceased\nsubjects whose families were interviewed. The population\neligible for our study was defined as subject's C65 years of\nage who were interviewed during the follow-up periods in\ninterviewees and 3,822 deceased interviewees.\nAn extensive questionnaire (containing 92 questions\npertaining to 180 items) was used in the CLHLS. Data were\ncollected on demographic factors, socioeconomic factors,\nliving arrangements, and health indicators, such as the\nADL and the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) etc.\nFor the CLHLS, an enumerator and either a doctor, nurse,\nor medical student conducted an interview and performed a\nbasic health examination at the interviewee's home [9, 10].\nMeasures\nThe six basic activities in the ADL consist of eating,\ndressing, indoor mobility, bathing, using the toilet, and\ncontinence. While considering the ADL measurement\nmethod proposed by Katz [11], the following measurement\ncriteria were developed for the present study. The degrees\nof function in ADL were categorized as: fully independent\n(FI; i.e., no assistance required); relatively independent\n(RI; i.e., requiring assistance for only one or two activi-\nties); relatively dependent (RD; i.e., requiring assistance in\nthree or four activities); and fully dependent (FD; i.e.,\nrequiring assistance in five or six activities). In addition,\nthe change in ADL was also analyzed among the deceased\ninterviewees as one of the severe forms of decline in\nphysical functions.\nExposure variables were measured at baseline (i.e., in\n2002), except for the frequency of serious illness in the past\n2 years among the surviving interviewees (e.g., in 2005).\nMarital status was transformed into a dichotomous\nvariable, indicating married versus single (i.e., widowed,\ndivorced, separated or never married). Living arrangements\nwere identified through the marital status of the individual,\nthe household size, and the co-residence members. Thus,\nthe potential types of living arrangements were ``living in a\nnursing home'', ``living alone'', ``living with spouse only''\n(specified by a household size of two, a married status, and\nthe co-resident member being the spouse), and ``living with\nothers'' (defined by a household size C3 individuals). For\nthe variable of living arrangements, the term, ``others'' was\ndefined as a spouse, children, grandchildren, or other rel-\natives. In our study, the category of an elderly person living\nwith a child or children younger than 18 years of age was\ndeleted, because the limited number of subjects that fell\ninto that category made the particular living arrangement\ndifficult to evaluate.\nOur study included the following healthcare questions:\n(1) who (spouse, children, relatives, live-in caregivers, and/\nor others) usually takes care of you when you are ill? (2)\nCan you obtain adequate medical service when you are ill?\n(yes or no). (3) ``Who pays your medical bills for you?''\n(i.e., having health insurance, family, relatives or others).\nThis question was asked to identify whether a subject had\nhealth insurance or not.\nFor accuracy in investigating the role of the factors of\nmarital status, living arrangements, and healthcare issues\non changes in categories of ADL, we eliminated con-\nfounding factors including demographic, socioeconomic\nand health factors. Health factors included cognitive ability\nand frequency of serious illness within the past 2 years.\nDemographic and socioeconomic factors included gender,\nage, residence, education, occupation, and household\nincome. The number of years of schooling was used to\nrepresent the educational level of the elderly subjects.\nWe pre-processed the data on years of schooling into the\nfollowing categories, according to their distribution: ``no\neducation'' (i.e., illiteracy), 1\u00ad4 years of schooling, and\nC5 years of schooling. We divided occupational data into\nagricultural or non-agricultural, according to the subjects'\noccupations before they were 60 years of age. This division\nwas made because nearly two-thirds of the current popu-\nlation of elderly people in China were involved in farming\nand agricultural production. Household income was pre-\nprocessed into the following three categories according to\nRMB per capita per year, and [3,001 RMB per capita per\nyear.\nThe international standard of the MMSE questionnaire\nused in this study to measure cognitive ability was trans-\nlated into Chinese [9]. The same parameters used in the\nMMSE international standard were applied here; thus, a\nscore of 0\u00ad30 was possible (i.e., the lower the score, the\nmore severe was the cognitive impairment). The frequency\nof serious illness requiring hospitalization or that which\ncaused the subject to be bedridden at home within the past\n2 years was calculated for the year 2005. We pre-processed\nan extended period of time that for which a subject was\nbedridden at home as a score of 24, representing 24 months\n(2 years). The distribution of frequency of serious illness\nrequiring hospitalization ranged from 0 to 16. Thus, fre-\nquency of serious illness and period of being bedridden at\nhome were quantitative variables in the analyses.\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses including a v2 test or Kruskal\u00adWallis H\ntest were conducted to analyze the change in ADL and\neither the exposure variables (marital status, living\narrangements, and availability of healthcare) or the main\nconfounding variables (i.e., demographic, socioeconomic\nand health factors). Multinomial logistic regression analy-\nsis was run using different categories of ADL (including\ndead) as a dependent variable. Three multinomial logistic\nregression models were used to test the influence of marital\nstatus, living arrangements, and availability of healthcare\non changes in ADL from the different baselines for elderly\nsubjects in China. The first model estimated the relative\nrisk factors of progressing from FI to RI, RD, FD, and\ndying among those at FI baseline. The second and third\nmodels incorporated the relative factors of progressing\nthose from RI or RD and FD to FI or FI and RI, RD and\nFD, and dying among those at RI or RD and FD baseline,\nrespectively. Due to a limited number of cases in some\ncategories, those who were RD and FD were combined in\nthe analysis; for the same reason, FI and RI were also\ncombined when the onset of ADL at RD and FD baselines.\nAnalyses were performed with SPSS Version 16.0 statis-\ntical software.\nResults\nOur total study sample was 11,921 elderly people, Of these,\nelderly subjects with household income less than 1,200\nwere single (with 1 case missing). The average age of male\naddition, among the 4,174 elderly who were currently\nCharacteristics of the study population according to the\npresented in Table 1. Regarding changes in ADL from\nAmong subjects who were FI at baseline, significant\ncorrelations with changes in ADL were found with all\ncategories of demographic variables, socioeconomic fac-\ntors, the exposure variables (with the exception of having\nhealth insurance) and factors of health status. However, for\nthose who were RI at baseline, there were no statistically\nsignificant correlations between changes in ADL and\ngender, education or occupation. For those who were RD\nor FD at baseline, no significant correlations between\nchanges in ADL were found with gender and occupation.\nIn summary, only among subjects who were FI at baseline,\nmales were more than the females with statistical signifi-\ncance in maintaining independence in ADL. Among the\nthe younger age range among the elderly population, who\nhad obtained a higher level of education or who lived in\nrural areas of China had the highest likelihood of main-\ntaining independence in ADL when comparing with their\nrespective counterparts--the older age range among the\nelderly population, who had lower education or who lived\nin urban areas.\nOn the other hand, among socioeconomic factors, sig-\nnificant correlations were observed between household\nincomes and change in ADL from all baseline categories.\nA significant association between occupation and ADL\nchange from baseline were observed only in subjects cat-\negorized as FI at baseline. A trend in those with lower\nsocioeconomic status possessing a greater likelihood of\nmaintaining ADL independence was observed. Regarding\nhealth factors, both the frequency of serious illness within\nthe past 2 years and the MMSE scores were associated with\nsignificant changes in ADL. Among the exposure factors,\nsignificant changes in ADL from all baseline categories of\nADL were correlated with marital status, living arrange-\nments, the type of caregiver when the subject was ill, or\nadequate of medical service. In terms of health insurance,\nhaving health insurance resulted in maintenance of inde-\npendence in ADL in subjects who were RI, or RD and FD\nat baseline. These findings indicate that almost all of the\nexposure factors influenced change in ADL status accord-\ning to different ADL levels at baseline.\nTable 2 includes three multinomial logistic regression\nmodels to test the influence of residence, education,\nhousehold income, occupation, marital status, living\narrangements, and availability of healthcare on changes in\nADL from the different baselines for elderly subjects in\nChina, after adjusting for age and gender. The first model\nestimated the relative risk factors of progressing from FI to\nRI, RD, FD, and dying among the onset of ADL at FI\nbaseline (We indicated them as RI/FI, RD/FI, FD/FI and\nDead/FI). The second model estimated the relative factors\nof progressing from RI to FI, RD or FD, and dying among\nthe onset of ADL at RI baseline (We indicated them as FI/\nRI, RD ? FD/RI and Dead/RI). The third model estimated\nthe relative factors of progressing from RD or FD to FI or\nRI and dying among the onset of ADL at RD or FD\nbaseline (We indicated them as FI ? RI/RD ? FD and\nDead/RD ? FD).\nTable 2 shows that, after adjusting for age and gender,\nthose who lived in urban areas had a higher risk of ADL\nlived in rural areas.

Notably, once\nthe elderly showed dependency in ADL function, living\nalone was no longer a significant predictor of future ADL\nstatus. For those who were RD or FD at baseline, after\nadjusting for main confounding variables, elderly who\nwere cared for by children and other relatives during illness\nwere 4.4 times more likely to experience a change in ADL\nfrom RD or FD to RI or FI, compared to those with\nunrelated live-in caregivers. In addition, among those who\nwere RD or FD at baseline, the elderly who were cared for\nby a spouse, or by children and other relatives during ill-\nness, or who had health insurance had a lower likelihood of\nrespectively). Other factors did not significantly affect the\nchange in ADL.\nDiscussion\nGiven the paucity of previous research conducted on the\nimpact of marital status, living arrangements, and health-\ncare availability on change in ADL among Chinese elderly,\nthe current study may have important implications for\npolicy-making regarding community and family support\nsystems. Specifically, we found that Chinese elderly who\nare married are less likely to experience ADL decline and\nhave a lower risk of death, compared to their single\ncounterparts. Among those who were FI at baseline, the\nChinese elderly who lived alone were less likely to expe-\nrience ADL decline compared to those who lived with their\nspouse, or lived with children and/or other people\n(including a spouse). Another study of Chinese people\nC55 years of age showed similar results; the elderly who\nlived with people other than a spouse had a significantly\nhigher risk of decline in functional status than did elderly\nwho lived alone or with only their spouse [12].\nThe following reasons might explain these findings.\nFirst, a recent survey conducted in China found that more\nelderly people who were financially and physically inde-\npendent preferred to live either alone or with their spouse.\nThis trend was especially true for urban elderly with high\nlevels of education and who had held white-collar jobs\nbefore they reached 60 years of age [2, 13]. Most of these\nsubjects enjoyed a full life. Thus, continuing to live alone\nor with just their spouse seemed to be beneficial in main-\ntaining ADL, compared to other elderly people who lived\nwith children or others.\nSecondly, public pensions in China currently are\nreserved for only a small proportion of the elderly popula-\ntion [14\u00ad16]. Therefore, in both urban and rural areas, many\nelderly people provide their adult offspring with housing,\nhousework, or care of grandchildren in return for financial\nand other material support. The degree to which an adult\noffspring would provide financial support to their elderly\nparents is dependent on the parents' need [14]. Such family\nsupport compensates for insufficient access to public\nresources. For elderly who live with others, including off-\nspring, the long-term intergenerational exchange may result\nin physical fatigue, leading to a decline in physical\nfunctioning.\nThird, according to our data, the average age of married\nelderly in China is lower than that of single elderly, and the\nmajority of married elderly in China are male, while the\nmajority of those who live alone are female. From our data,\nwe surmise that married male elderly in China were less\nlikely to experience deteriorating function in ADL and had\na lower likelihood of death compared to those who are\nsingle. On the other hand, elderly women living alone in\nChina were less likely to experience ADL decline. Similar\nstudies in Japan and western countries [17, 18] indicated\nthat males who lived alone had higher health risks, while\nwomen who lived alone had significantly lower mortality\nrates. In sum, further study is required to examine the\nbenefits of marriage with regard to maintenance of ADL\nindependence by gender and age in China.\nFinally, living alone allows elderly people to learn to\nmaintain a high level of independence, a phenomenon\nreferred to as a ``biologically conditioned reflex'' [19].\nAccording to our analyses, compared to those who live\nwith others, elderly people who live alone are more inde-\npendent in not only the six basic ADL activities (eating,\ndressing, indoor mobility, bathing, using the toilet, and\ncontinence), but also in instrumental ADL activities, such\nas walking outside, shopping, preparing meals, or cleaning.\nOur study revealed that once an elderly person becomes\nfunctionally dependent on others, the status of living alone\nis not a significant predictor of further functional decline.\nAfter adjusting for confounding factors in those who are\nRD or FD at baseline, the elderly who were cared for by\nchildren and other relatives during illness were 4.4 times\nmore likely to experience a change in ADL from RD or FD\nto RI or FI, compared to those with unrelated live-in\ncaregivers. In addition, the elderly who were cared for by a\nspouse, or children and other relatives had a lower likeli-\nhood of death, compared to those with unrelated live-in\ncaregivers. These findings imply that currently, the\nmajority of elderly in China still rely on traditional forms\nof family support. Compared to the past, a greater pro-\nportion of modern-day elderly people in China are single or\nlive with just their spouse [2], but once the elderly become\nfunctionally dependent, they usually move to live with\ntheir adult offspring and other people [20, 21]. According\nto traditional confucian-based family values in China, the\nhappiest elderly are those surrounded by as many descen-\ndants as possible, especially during the last stages of their\nlives. Spouses, children, and other relatives who play the\nrole of caregivers when an elderly relative becomes ill is\nconsidered to be common [13]. Moreover, compared to\nhaving an unrelated, live-in caregiver, having spouses,\nchildren, and other relatives who play the role of caregivers\nwill better protect the elderly from psychological isolation\nand will provide sick elderly people with adequate medical\nservices. However, according to the studies, even after the\nintroduction of long-term health care insurance in 2000 in\nJapan, the potential supply of offspring caregivers present\nvaried substantially by gender, marital status, and oppor-\ntunity costs of children [22]. Judging by this result found in\nJapanese studies, this study also implies that professional\ntraining for live-in caregivers is required due to the rapidly\nincreasing proportion of the aged within the population in\nChina, partially as a consequence of the one-child policy.\nOur study also indicated that among those who were\nRD or FD at baseline, Chinese elderly with health\ninsurance had a lower likelihood of death. Unfortunately,\nin recent decades, the elderly in China have experienced\ninadequate medical service or treatment due to reforms in\nthe medical care system. From 1949 (establishment of\nnew China) until the end of the first decade of the twenty\nfirst century, the healthcare system in China has experi-\nenced the elimination of private medical facilities, the\nrural cooperative medical system (i.e., the presence of\n``barefoot'' doctors), and the public and private healthcare\nsystems. Since the economic reform that occurred in the\n1980s, public and private healthcare systems have\nemerged once again. However, the quality of healthcare\npractice has deteriorated due to poor management and\nless government regulation of the medical market [23,\n24]. Most elderly people in China have experienced\ninequality in healthcare, because of their low socioeco-\nnomic status and the low quality and availability of health\npeople in this study had health insurance and most of\nthem live in urban areas of China; about one-third had a\nhousehold income of less than 1,200 RMB per capita per\nyear, and most of them live in rural areas of China.\nHowever, in this study, residing in rural areas, and\nhaving lower education or lower household income appear\nto be a protective factor against dependency on others for\nassistance with ADL. On the other hand, residing in urban\nareas or having higher education helped protect against\nprogressing ADL from RI, RD or FD to dying compared\nwith their counterparts (see Tables 1, 2). In addition,\nelderly who experienced inadequate medical service when\nill or lacking health insurance were found to have a lower\nlikelihood of ADL decline (see Table 2). This could be\nexplained by the ``select bias'' [10], selecting for those with\na lower socioeconomic status, lower availability of health\ninsurance, more difficult life experiences, and higher\nmortality at younger ages in rural regions of China. As a\nresult, the selected elderly in rural areas might be with\nstronger survival skills than those in urban areas in China.\nIn addition, due to a massive shift from rural to urban\nareas among the younger population, a large proportion of\nthe elderly population remains with their grandchildren in\nrural villages [25, 26]. Number of adult offspring willing to\ntake on care-giving responsibilities for aging parents is\ndeclining in modern China. As a result, the elderly in China\nare once again facing disadvantages in healthcare and\nassistance. All of these factors suggest that health insurance\nfor the elderly should be established and that adequate\nmedical service or treatment for the Chinese elderly should\nbe provided as soon as possible.\nThe present study has several methodological limita-\ntions. Some factors of measurement were not sensitive\nenough to detect a functionally independent status of the\nelderly. For example, those considered to be married\nincluded those currently married and living together as well\nas those currently married and living separately. It would\nbe better to distinguish the difference between these two\ngroups. However, there were only 295 (6.3% of all married\nsubjects) elderly subjects who were currently married and\nliving separated. In addition, the living arrangements in the\npresent study were only categorized as living in a nursing\nhome, living alone, living with just a spouse, and living\nwith ``others'' (``others'' was defined as a spouse, children,\ngrandchildren, or other relatives). Future studies should\ninclude more detailed classifications of marital status and\nliving arrangements. Future studies should also assess how\nchanges from different baselines of ADL can be explained\nby the differences between those who experienced physical\ndecline and changed their living situation from a small\nfamily to a large family, and those who experienced a\ndecline in functional status, but did not change their family\nstructure within their household.

We con-\nclude that within the surveyed time period, the majority of\nelderly people in China still relied on a traditional type of\nfamily support. As the elderly have different functional\nlevels, healthcare policies in China should consider both\ncommunity and family support systems.\n"
