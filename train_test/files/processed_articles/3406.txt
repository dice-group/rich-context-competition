Together, these data illustrate that\nmoral choices are conditional on the social nature of the moral dyad: Even under the same moral constraints, a target's gender and\na decider's gender can shift an individual's choice to be more or less altruistic, suggesting that gender bias and harm considerations\nplay a significant role in moral cognition.\n",

This is exemplified\nby ``women and children first''--a historical maritime code\nof conduct stating that when there is a life-threatening situation,\nthose who are more vulnerable should be saved first (Kipling,\n1907). Dovetailing with this, classic research on gender stereo-\ntyping demonstrates that both implicit judgments (Banaji &\nMoss-Racusin, Dovidio, Brescoll, Graham, & Handelsman,\n2012) are affected by gender bias--that is, associating males\nwith strength and power and females with nurturance and help-\nlessness. This reliance on using a target's features to infer over-\narching personality traits (Asch, 1946) has proven to be\npowerful in influencing one's judgments (Hamilton & Sher-\nFrom this work, theorists have further posited that a target's\nfeatures may affect endorsements of harm violation (Gray,\nWaytz, & Young, 2012), which fits with the evidence that\nharming behavior in particular is susceptible to shifting social\ncues that signal distinct morally appropriate behavior. Research\nexploring the interaction between harming and helping demon-\nstrates that how readily an individual harms another appears to\nbe a function of the social context in which the harm is\nembedded. For example, features that make harm perceptually\nsalient decrease the likelihood of engaging in harmful beha-\nvior. This has been observed in various classes of moral\ndilemmas and with different manipulations, including pushing\na person onto train tracks versus pulling a lever to reroute the\ntrain (Greene, Sommerville, Nystrom, Darley, & Cohen,\n2001), showing more versus less skin when administering elec-\ntric shocks (Gray, Knobe, Sheskin, Bloom, & Barrett, 2011),\nobserving someone's face rather than just their hand\nrespond to pain (FeldmanHall, Dalgleish, Evans, & Mobbs,\n2015), and discharging a toy gun into another's face versus\nwitnessing such an action occurring (Cushman, Gray, Gaffey,\nEven after the harm has occurred, social context can further\ninfluence how one engages with a distressed target. For\ninstance, a target's identity is known to effect the level of sym-\npathy or punishment that is bestowed (Cikara, Bruneau, &\nto a target's pain is moderated by their relationship with the dis-\ntressed individual (Cikara, Botvinick, & Fiske, 2011). Given\nhow robustly social context can dictate harm perception, a lin-\ngering question is whether a target's gender contributes to the\n1 Department of Psychology, New York University, New York, NY, USA\n2 Medical Research Council, Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge, UK\n3 School of Psychology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK\n4 Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nOriel FeldmanHall, Department of Psychology, New York University,\nEmail: oriel.feldmanhall@nyu.edu\nSocial Psychological and\nPersonality Science\nReprints and permission:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nspps.sagepub.com\nsocial framework of a moral dilemma, and thus the willingness\nto harm another. If this were the case, a target's gender--and\nthe social biases that associate males with strength and females\nwith helplessness--may modulate the endorsement of harm,\nresulting in divergent altruistic behavior. In other words, these\ngender biases may influence females receiving greater chival-\nrous treatment (i.e., more protection from harm at the expense\nof self-gain) than their male counterparts. To test this, under\nboth real and hypothetical contexts, and across different classes\nof moral dilemmas, we first explore whether a target's gender\ninfluences the propensity to harm another.\nWe also wanted to investigate possible psychological\nmechanisms motivating an individual to harm another for\nself-gain. There is evidence that distinct patterns of moral judg-\nments result from varying sensitivities to fairness and harm\nconcerns (Haidt & Graham, 2007b). These two orientations are\nconsidered to be the most dominant foundations for moral\ndecision-making, each capturing distinct perspectives: treat\nothers fairly and help others in need (Gilligan & Attanucci,\n1988). Theorists argue that individuals navigate moral chal-\nlenges either by relying predominately on their sensitivity to\nharm and care considerations or through a well-developed cal-\nculus sensitive to justice and fairness concerns (Gilligan, 1982;\nKohlberg & Hersh, 1977). A wealth of research now highlights\nthat humans are highly attuned to both fairness (Fehr &\nSchmidt, 1999) and harm considerations (Cushman et al.,\nagnostic as to whether altruistic motivations would be better\nexplained by the general tendency to endorse harm and care\nconsiderations or fairness and justice considerations. Thus, our\nsecond aim was to examine how a target's gender and an indi-\nvidual's considerations of harm and fairness interact to influ-\nence costly altruism--that is, helping or harming another at a\ncost to oneself.\nTo ask these questions, we probed behavior in two different\ntypes of moral dilemmas. First, we tested whether a target's\ngender would have an effect on responses in the classic Trolley\nhypothesizing that if a target's gender is instrumental for fram-\ning a moral scenario and shaping perceptions of harm, then\neven under hypothetical conditions where one must simulate\nthe tensions, individuals should more readily agree to push a\nman--compared to a woman--in front of the trolley. In Study\n2, we explored the effects of a target's gender on moral beha-\nvior during real dyadic interactions between an intentional\ndecider and a distressed target (Gray, Young, & Waytz,\n2012). This dyadic paradigm--known as the Pain versus Gain\n(PvG) task (FeldmanHall et al., 2012)--requires participants to\nmake decisions about how much money they would pay to\nreduce or prevent painful electric shocks from reaching a target\n(a confederate). This allowed us to test if participants exhibit\ndifferential patterns of altruistic behavior based on the target's\ngender (i.e., paying more money to prevent harm from reaching\na female compared to a male target). If gender and the accom-\npanying biases--such as associating females with helpless-\nness--contribute to the social framing of a moral dilemma,\nthen participants who engage with a female target may display\ngreater prosocial tendencies (i.e., more money paid out and less\npain administered). Drawing on the classic work of Kohlberg\nas the rich literature on moral trade-offs (Tetlock, Kristel,\nElson, Green, & Lerner, 2000) and sacred values (Graham &\nHaidt, 2011), we further theorized that any observed differ-\nences in moral behavior would likely be a function of the inter-\naction between a target's gender and a participant's individual\ntrait differences in harm and fairness sensitivity. More specifi-\ncally, increasing altruistic tendencies toward females may be\nrelated to how strongly participants identify with and value\nharm or fairness concepts.\nParticipants\n11.2) were recruited from the United States using the online\nlabor market Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT; Buhrmester,\nKwang, & Gosling, 2011; Horton, Rand, & Zeckhauser,\nparticipated anonymously over the Internet and were not\nallowed to take part in more than one experimental session. All\nparticipants provided written informed consent, and the study\nwas approved by Columbia University's ethics committee.\nMethod\nParticipants in Study 1A were presented with the classic variant\nof the Trolley Dilemma, the Footbridge Dilemma (Foot, 1978),\nand queried whether they would push a male or female bystan-\nder onto the tracks. Participants in Study 1B were randomly\nselected to read one of the three versions of the dilemma, where\neach vignette described a man, woman, or gender-neutral\nbystander on the bridge. The participant was then asked how\nwilling they were to ``push the [man/woman/person] onto the\npath of the oncoming trolley,'' indicating on a 10-point analo-\ngue scale willingness to push (WTP). The aim was to determine\nwhether there are observable gender biases during philosophical\nmoral dilemmas, with the key variable being how readily a male\nor female bystander is pushed onto the tracks (i.e., harmed).\nResults and Discussion\nIn Study 1A, 88% of participants reported that they would push\nZ2 \u00bc .57; Figure 1A), illustrating that participants significantly\nendorsed the preservation of a female over a male bystander's\nwelfare. Adding in participant's gender as a factor revealed no\nsignificant effect ( p > .6). During debriefing, participants sug-\ngested possible motivations for their responses explaining that\n``in a utilitarian situation, I value women and children over\nmen'' and ``[pushing] a man is the moral thing to do, women\nare fragile and it would be morally wrong.''\nIn Study 1B, we manipulated gender and again explored par-\nticipants' WTP. We submitted WTP to a 3 (bystander gender)\n\u00c2 2 (participant gender) analysis of variance (ANOVA), where\nvariables were coded as follows: \u00c01 \u00bc female, 0 \u00bc unspecified\ngender, 1 \u00bc male. Results revealed a main effect of the bystan-\nsuch that participants were overall more willing to push a man\n(mean WTP \u00bc 3.3, SD + 2.4, 10 \u00bc very willing) or a bystander\nwith an unspecified gender (mean WTP \u00bc 4.3, SD + 3.1) than\na woman (mean WTP \u00bc 3.0, SD + 2.4). We also observed a\nmain effect of the participant's gender, such that female parti-\ncipants were overall less willing to push (mean WTP \u00bc 3.2, SD\nvious research illustrating women are more sensitive to causing\nharm then men (Friesdorf, Conway, & Gawronski, 2015). The\nBystander \u00c2 Participant interaction did not survive signifi-\ncance (p > .1).\nTogether, this reveals that participants were less willing to\npush a woman than a man off the footbridge, suggesting that\neven within the hypothetical domain where the tensions are not\nas easily simulated (FeldmanHall et al., 2012), individuals take\na target's gender into account when contemplating harmful\nactions. We further observed that female participants were\noverall less willing to harm another, replicating previous work\nthat not only are males sacrificed more often than females in\nclassic trolley dilemmas but also that females are less likely\nto harm others (Eckel & Grossman, 2001; Skulmowski, Bunge,\nParticipants\nIn Study 2, 57 adults were recruited from the UK Medical\nResearch Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit volunteer\nwas based on previous similar work (FeldmanHall et al.,\n2012). In order to avoid priming moral attitudes and to minimize\nexplicit moral reasoning during task performance, we recruited\nparticipants under the pretense of participating in an economic\ndecision-making study. All participants provided written\ninformed consent, and the study was approved by Cambridge\nUniversity's Psychology Research Ethics Committee. An inde-\n14.06) rated the attractiveness, approachability, and feelings\ntoward both targets, finding that the male was significantly more\nattractive, approachable, and positive than the female target (all\nps < .001, see Supplemental Material for details).\nMethod\nIn the PvG task, participants (deciders) were presented with a\nseries of 20 trials, each requiring a moral decision: benefit one-\nself financially or prevent harm to another. At the start of the\nexperiment, deciders were given \u00a320 and told that any money\nleft at the end of the task would be multiplied up to 10-fold,\ngiving them as much as \u00a3200. On each trial, \u00a31 was at stake,\nand the choice was how much, if any, of the \u00a31 to give up in\norder to prevent a painful but harmless electric shock from\nreaching the target on that trial. The more money paid out on\na given trial, the lower the shock level inflicted on the target\nFigure 1. Behavior in footbridge dilemma. (A) When faced with either pushing a male or female bystander, participants overwhelmingly choose\nto sacrifice a male bystander. (B) A main effect of willingness to push was observed illustrating greatest willingness to push a bystander whose\ngender was not identified and least for a female bystander. A main effect of participant's gender on willingness to push was also observed, with\nfemale participants less willing to push compared to male participants.\n544 Social Psychological and Personality Science 7(6)\n(index of costly altruism): Paying the full \u00a31 would remove the\nshock altogether, while paying nothing would mean the target\nexperienced the highest shock level on that trial. The key beha-\nvioral variable was how much money (\u00a30\u00ad\u00a320) deciders\nretained across the 20 trials, with larger amounts indicating that\npersonal gain was prioritized over the target's pain. Effectively,\nthe more money the decider paid, the lower the shock level the\ntarget received on a given trial. Consequently, to stop all of the\nshocks across all 20 trials, deciders would need to spend all \u00a320\n(see Supplemental Material for full task details).\nDeciders were also required to view the administration of\nthe shocks. This allowed us to manipulate the target's gender\nby broadcasting a video of either a male target (Condition 1)\nor female target (Condition 2) responding to the shock\n(Figure 2A; we used this between-group design to control for\nthe possibility of demand characteristics). Since the shocks\nwere real, videos were prerated by an independent group to\nbe matched across condition, such that both male and female\ntargets elicited similar body and facial pain expressions that\nwere directly yoked to the analogue scale presented to partici-\npants. To ensure that other potential factors besides a target's\ngender were not driving behavior, we checked (using 8-point\nLikert-type scales in a subset of our participants during\npostexperimental questionnaires) that targets were matched\non multiple dimensions including their familiarity, all indepen-\nMoral Foundations Sacredness Scale (MFSS)\nTo explore potential moderating effects of harm and fairness\nconsiderations, we administered the MFSS (Graham & Haidt,\n2011) after the PvG, which provides an index of the willingness\nto earn money at the expense of multiple moral considerations.\nThe MFSS proposes that there are certain psychological foun-\ndations on which individuals build their moral systems and are\norganized along five dimensions (Graham & Haidt, 2011).\nSince the harm and fairness scales are believed to be most rel-\nevant to everyday life (Haidt & Graham, 2007a), and because\nthere is a long-standing debate over which of these two dimen-\nsions best predicts moral behavior (Gilligan, 1982; Kohlberg &\nFigure 2.

(D) The\nrelationship between money kept and a decider's gender as a function of trait harm sensitivity. Variables were standardized before being entered\ninto the regression. Regressions were graphed using the method of simple slopes (Aiken & West, 1991), where high harm sensitivity \u00bc 1 SD\nabove the mean; low harm sensitivity \u00bc 1 SD below the mean. Error bars represent 1 SE.\nHersh, 1977), we used these constructs as predictors of costly\naltruism. The scale measures how much money an individual\nis willing to receive to violate moral norms within each of the\nfoundations (see Supplemental Material for more details),\nencapsulating whether or not a person is motivated (at the\nexpense of money) to care for someone (harm) or is willing\nto immorally profit off others (fairness).\nResults\nDuring the PvG task, deciders interacting with a female target\nkept significantly less money and thus gave significantly lower\nure 2B. This replicates the findings from Studies 1A and 1B in\nthe real domain and under a different class of moral challenge,\nillustrating that harm endorsement is attenuated for female tar-\ngets. Together, this suggests that a target's gender can power-\nfully shift the perception of harm and lead to an increase in\ncostly altruism (see Supplemental Material for further analysis\nincluding the influence of the decider's gender on money kept\nas well as results of Study 4 replicating these findings in an\nonline version of the PvG task).\nExploring deciders' trait sensitivity to harm and fairness\nconsiderations (Graham & Haidt, 2011) revealed that female\ndeciders reported significantly greater sensitivity to harm than\nmale deciders, female mean harm sensitivity \u00bc 30.4, SD + 5.1,\nmale mean harm sensitivity \u00bc 26.2, SD + 5.8; independent t-\nobserve a difference in deciders' trait fairness levels, female\nmean fairness sensitivity \u00bc 25.0, SD + 9.7, male mean fairness\np \u00bc 0.38. To examine whether these individual trait differences\nin moral orientations moderate the relationship between altru-\nism and a target's and decider's gender, we performed multiple\nregression analyses (Table 1). Money kept/shock delivered\n(index of costly altruism) was the dependent variable. The\npredictors at the first step (Model 1) were target's gender,\ndecider's gender, and deciders' individual trait harm scores (all\nz-scored). At the second step (Model 2), we entered each of the\nproduct terms of these variables, and at the third step (Model\n3), we entered the three-way interaction term. Significant mod-\neration is indicated by the fit of the model improving with each\nsubsequent step (Aiken & West, 1991). We also ran this same\nregression with deciders' fairness scores.\nWe found a significant moderating role of harm sensitivity\non both the effects of a target's gender and a decider's gender\nsignificant interactions using the method of simple slopes\n(Aiken & West, 1991). We found that higher levels of trait\nharm sensitivity predicted greater altruism for female targets\nbut not male targets (Figure 2C). That is, deciders high in harm\nsensitivity interacting with a female target kept significantly\nless money, thus preserving the female target's physical wel-\nfare. We also found that trait levels of harm sensitivity played\na moderating role on a decider's gender and their subsequent\nchoice to preserve the welfare of the target: Male deciders with\nlow levels of trait harm sensitivity were significantly more self-\nish than males deciders with high levels of trait harm sensitivity\n(Figure 2D). This finding did not hold for female deciders, as\nfemales exhibited the same altruistic behavior regardless of\ntheir levels of trait harm sensitivity. Furthermore, there was\nno clear interaction relationship between an decider's gender,\na target's gender, and trait harm sensitivity, Model 3:\nWhile we found that fairness considerations influenced\nthat fairness considerations had a moderating role on gender\nDr2 \u00bc .08, r2 \u00bc total .31. Together, these results demonstrate\na strong relationship between a decider's sensitivity to harm\nconsiderations and the target's gender on altruistic choice as\nwell as a strong relationship between a decider's gender and\ntheir sensitivity to harm on altruistic choice.\nGiven that we observed a target's gender can bias one's readi-\nness to engage in harmful actions and that a decider's\nTable 1.

One explanation is\nthat females typically evoke more positive attitudes than males\n(Fazio & Olson, 2003) and are thus more likely to reap greater\nprosocial treatment. However, our post-task questionnaires\nprobing attitudes toward the target significantly favored the\nmale target, indicating that positive feelings for females are\nunlikely to be underlying the observed effect. An alternative\nexplanation is rooted in the interaction between harm endorse-\nment and adherence to societal norms, with the idea that it is\nmore socially unacceptable to harm a female than a male\nsibility that individuals find it more emotionally aversive to\nharm a female, which in turn could enhance altruistic behavior\nin the PvG task (Cushman et al., 2012; Miller, Hannikainen, &\nwhether these motivations might underlie an individual's reluc-\ntance to harm a female target for monetary gain.\nParticipants and Methods\nA total of 352 participants were recruited for Studies 3A\u00ad3C,\nsee Supplemental Material for details. Study 3A was a hypothe-\ntical analogue of the PvG task--where target's gender was ran-\ndomly manipulated to be female, male, or gender neutral (a\nbetween-subject design). Participants were queried about how\nmuch money most volunteers would keep and probed about\nsocietal perceptions of (1) harm, (2) pain tolerance, and (3) the\nchivalrous notion that men should protect women. Study 3B\npresented a subset of the same questions in Study 3A, except\nthat questions pertained to both males and females (a within-\nsubjects design). Study 3C randomly presented one of the three\nversions of the hypothetical PvG, and probed emotional aver-\nsion to the dilemma. See Supplemental Material for full list\nof questions and descriptive statistics from analyses in Studies\n3A\u00ad3C; answers were recorded on 10-point Likert-type scales.\nResults\nWhen probed about what other volunteers would do in the\nhypothetical analogue of the PvG, participants in Study 3A\nreported most volunteers would keep significantly less money\nwhen engaging with a female than a male or gender-neutral tar-\nceptions of pain tolerance revealed that women are believed to\nhave a significantly lower pain tolerance than either men or a\nperson whose gender was unspecified, ANOVA: F(2, 148) \u00bc\ning commonly held social norms that dictate how fair it is to\nharm a (man/woman/person); harming females was perceived\nas significantly more unfair than harming either a man or a\nWhen queried about who should be saved first on a sinking\nship, only one participant reported that men should be saved\nof participants responded that there should either be no order or\nthat women should be saved first (Figure 3A).

Specifically, we observed that according to social\nnorms, it is significantly (1) more morally unacceptable\nto harm a female for money, paired samples t-test: t(49) \u00bc\nto harm a female, paired samples t-test: t(49) \u00bc \u00c05.03,\np < .001, Cohen's d \u00bc .34: Figure 3C; and men have a signif-\nicantly greater tolerance to pain, paired samples t-test: t(49) \u00bc\nIn Study 3C, we tested whether harm inflicted on males and\nfemales elicits different levels of emotional aversion. Partici-\npants responded to three questions relating to their own emo-\ntional aversion and level of emotional intensity after reading\nthe hypothetical PvG scenario. Across conditions (male/\nfemale/gender neutral), we found no differences in the level of\nemotional aversion or level of emotional intensity (all ps > .1).\nThat is, participants reported similar high levels of emotional\naversion to reading about a male, female, and gender-neutral\ntarget in the PvG dilemma (see Supplemental Material for\ndetails).\nAcross these three studies, we investigate possible motiva-\ntions supporting the finding that a target's gender can bias an\nindividual's willingness to engage in harmful actions. The find-\nings suggest that social norms regarding gender and harm con-\nsiderations likely account for greater harming behavior toward\na male than a female target. Moreover, there are widely held\nsocietal perceptions that females are less tolerant to pain, that\nit is unacceptable to harm females for personal gain, and that\nsociety endorses chivalrous behavior. Surprisingly, we found\nno differences in emotional aversion to reading about harming\nmales versus females. These findings confirm perceptions of\ngender bias, and that these biases interact with harm considera-\ntions, helping to disambiguate why males are harmed more dur-\ning the PvG task. While it is equally emotionally aversive to\nhurt any individual--regardless of their gender--that society\nperceives harming women as more morally unacceptable, sug-\ngests that gender bias and harm considerations play a large role\nin shaping moral action.\nGeneral Discussion\nHere we illustrate that across different types of moral dilem-\nmas, and under both hypothetical and real contexts, moral\nchoices to harm another are conditional on the social nature\nof the moral dyad and are thus relatively context dependent.\nSpecifically, we show that moral behavior is modulated by the\ngender of the target individual, such that females are more\nreadily protected from harm and are more often the recipients\nof costly altruism compared to their male counterparts. When\nasked to respond to a utilitarian-based moral dilemma, partici-\npants overwhelming responded that they would push a man--\nrather than a woman--in front of an oncoming trolley. When\nwe tested this effect in a different class of moral challenge\nwhere self-benefit and another's welfare are juxtaposed, we\nfound that even under the same moral constraints where all\ncomponents of the moral task were held constant, a target's\ngender can shift an individual's choice to be more or less\naltruistic, providing converging evidence that gender bias plays\na significant role in moral behavior.\nResearch demonstrates that increasing the salience of harm\nhas profound effects on moral behavior (Cushman et al., 2012;\nGreene et al., 2001), and the data presented here illustrate that\nthe gender of the target is a critical feature that can shift the\nendorsement of harm and influence the altruistic response. One\nexplanation for this is that beliefs about female and male char-\nacteristics bias how an individual perceives harming a target.\nMost people have widely shared beliefs and expectations about\nthe traits and behaviors of males and females (i.e., Social Role\nTheory; Eagly, 1987). Males are typically associated with traits\nlike aggression and dominance (Moss-Racusin et al., 2012;\nSheltzer & Smith, 2014), and females are characteristically\nassociated with traits such as nurturance and submission (Bro-\nverman, Vogel, Broverma, Clarkson, & Rosenkra, 1972; Cejka\nbeliefs are easily and automatically activated (Banaji & Hardin,\n1996b). For instance, individuals who were preconsciously\nprimed with stereotypic characteristics like ``sensitive'' and\n``logical'' (for female and male, respectively) were faster at\nidentifying the gender of male or female names (Blair &\nBanaji, 1996). If females are canonically construed as sensitive\nand needing nurturance, then inflicting harm on a stereotypi-\ncally weak target may be perceived as more salient and aver-\nsive than harming a target associated with strength and\ncompetence.\nAn alternative explanation suggests that people feel more\npositively about women than they do about men (Eagly,\n1994). Our data, however, indicate that the male target was\nrated as more attractive, approachable, and positive compared\nto the female target. Thus, it seems unlikely that positive feel-\nings for the female target influenced costly altruism. In fact, in\nlight of the research linking attractiveness to increased helping\n(Benson, Karabenick, & Lerner, 1976), our findings that the\nfemale was helped more--despite being rated as less attractive\nand approachable--further supports and heightens the\nobserved effect.\nRegardless of an individual's attractiveness and approach-\nability, it is well documented that attitudes are shaped by impli-\ncit and explicit biases stemming from widespread cultural\n& Greenwald, 2002). Evidence of gender typical behaviors,\nsuch as females greater involvement in care-taking and com-\nmunal behaviors, and males in more agentic and competitive\nbehaviors (Gardner & Gabriel, 2004), illustrates that these atti-\ntudes can shape how males and females behave, including their\nengagement in prosocial behavior (Eagly, 2009). Although\nmuch more limited, some research has explored the other side\nof the social dyad; that is, whether gender stereotypes act as\nsocial norms influencing how targets are treated (Wood &\n548 Social Psychological and Personality Science 7(6)\nEagly, 2009). For example, women typically receive more help\nthan their male counterparts (Eagly & Crowley, 1986), and in\nthe Dictator game--where one can choose to forgo money in\norder to be fair--female players are allocated more money than\nmale players (Saad & Gill, 2001). That we found that a target's\ngender can also shape costly altruism, dovetails not only with\nmale and female stereotypical characteristics, but also the\nnotion that these gender biases have downstream effects on\nbehavior. Indeed, we found there is a societally held notion that\nmoral chivalry governs how morally unacceptable it is to harm\na female. Social norms regarding pain tolerance and the notion\nthat women should be protected from harm further confirmed\nthat there is a societal belief that it is more morally unaccepta-\nble to harm a female than a male. Together, this suggests that\nthese societal expectations about males and females and their\nrelative gender role differences play a fundamental role in\nshaping the perceptions and framework of dyadic moral\ndecisions.\nWe further observed that these behavioral patterns are mod-\nerated by the strength of the decider's preference for harm--\nbut not fairness--orientations, which suggests that concern for\nanother's well-being is a more salient motivator than concern\nfor fairness. We also reveal that male deciders' trait sensitivity\nto harm predicts altruistic behavior, while we found no support\nthat female deciders' sensitivity to harm motivates altruistic\nchoice. Although at first glance this appears to counter the clas-\nsic theory that females are more motivated by harm than their\nmale counterparts (Gilligan, 1982; Gilligan & Attanucci,\n1988), our data indicate that female deciders report overall\nhigher harm sensitivity and have lower group variance than\ntheir male counterparts. Thus, it is possible that females may\nbe more constant in their endorsement of harm considerations\nwhen navigating moral challenges, which is consistent with the\nbroader theory that females are strongly motivated by harm and\nders' altruistic behavior was predicted by their trait levels of\nharm sensitivity also fits with research illustrating that not only\ndo males exhibit greater heterogeneity in delinquency involve-\nment, but that they also engage in more antisocial behavior than\nHere we show that both hypothetical and real moral choices\nare influenced by the dyadic nature of the moral challenge. Even\nwhen all other social and contextual factors are held constant, a\ntarget's gender can shift a decider's choice to be more or less\naltruistic, suggesting that gender plays a significant role in how\nreadily one violates the harm principle. In addition, these beha-\nvioral patterns are moderated by an individual's sensitivity to\nharm but not fairness concerns. Together, these results illustrate\nthat moral choices are not objectively implemented but instead\nare flexibly deployed relative to the individual's moral orienta-\ntions and the social context in which they are made.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work\nwas funded by the UK Medical Research Council and Columbia\nUniversity.\nSupplemental Material\nThe online data supplements are available at http://spps.sagepub.com/\nsupplemental.\nReferences\nAiken, L., & West, S.
