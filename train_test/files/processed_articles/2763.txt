These encouraging declines\nare consistent with previous analyses and recent trends in\nyouth violence (3,4). The declines might indicate increased\nimplementation and beneficial effects of evidence-based\nprevention strategies that reach young persons (2,5). A\nnumber of primary prevention strategies have been shown\nto reduce the risk for and occurrence of youth violence,\nincluding school-based programs that build communication\nand problem-solving skills and family approaches that help\ncaregivers set age-appropriate rules, monitor youth activities\nand relationships, and address other risk factors (e.g., child-\nhood conduct problems and delinquency) (2).\nThe ED is an important implementation setting for preven-\ntion, in part because a large proportion of patients will experi-\nence a subsequent assault-related injury or premature death\nwithin a few years of a treated injury (6,7). For example, one\nstudy compared persons aged 14\u00ad24 years who sought treat-\nment in the ED and reported substance use in the 6 months\nbefore the visit. Of the young persons who were seen initially\nfor an assault-related injury, 36.7% were seen again for an\nassault-related injury within 24 months, compared with 22.4%\nof the young persons initially seen for other conditions (e.g.,\nunintentional injury or illness) (6).\nThe implementation of brief ED interventions to reduce\nthe continuation and escalation of violence is growing (8).\nThese programs vary in design and duration but typically\nidentify youths in the ED when they are examined for a\nviolence-related injury. The programs are implemented\nby trained staff members (e.g., medical personnel, com-\nmunity service providers, and program outreach workers)\nwho provide immediate and follow-up services to increase\nrisk awareness, conflict resolution skills, and connection to\ncommunity support (e.g., academic or vocational supports\nand mental health treatment). Research has shown that these\nprograms have significant benefits, including sustained reduc-\ntions in perpetration and victimization of peer violence (9).\nEvaluation of a specific program found that participants were\n70% less likely than nonparticipating youths to be arrested\nfor any offense during the 6 months after the program (10).\nThe findings of this report are subject to at least four limita-\ntions. First, injury rates are likely underestimates of the actual\nprevalence because data are limited to persons treated in EDs\nand do not include those who had injuries treated in other\nhealth care facilities (e.g., physician's office or urgent care\ncenter) or those for whom no treatment was needed or sought.\nSecond, data were coded by trained personnel based on narra-\ntives abstracted from patients' medical records, for which details\n \nUS Department of Health and Human Services/ \nSummary\nWhat is already known about this topic?\nPersons aged 10\u00ad24 years account for a substantial proportion\nof nonfatal assault injuries treated in emergency departments\n(EDs) in the United States.\nWhat is added by this report?\nThe 2015 rate for nonfatal injuries among persons aged\ninjury rates declined among both males and females and all age\ngroups examined. Despite these findings, assault injuries\ncontinue to occur often, with 485,610 young persons treated in\nEDs for assault-related injuries in 2015.\nWhat are the implications for public health practice?\nPrimary prevention strategies that build communication and\nproblem-solving skills and address risk factors for violence\namong young persons can stop violence before it starts.\nExpansion of these strategies and additional interventions\nfocused on injured young persons while they are receiving ED\ntreatment to connect to immediate and ongoing community\nsupport might decrease the risk for reinjury or fatality. CDC's\ntechnical package to prevent youth violence helps communities\nand states prioritize strategies with the best available evidence.\nof the injuries and circumstances varied. Inaccuracies in the\nabstraction and coding process might have occurred. Third,\ndifferences by race and ethnicity could not be examined because\nof the high prevalence of missing race/ethnicity data (20.3%).\nFinally, data are based on information in the ED record and are\nnot linked to other data sources (e.g., police reports or school\ndisciplinary reports) that might provide additional information\nabout the circumstances related to the injury or the relationship\nbetween the perpetrator and victim.\nAlthough the number of young persons treated for nonfatal\nassault injuries in EDs is declining, and this trend is promising,\nthese injuries remain common and costly. In 2015, approxi-\nmately 485,610 young persons were treated for assault-related\ninjuries, and associated medical and lost productivity costs\nwere approximately $3.4 billion (1).These injuries continue to\noccur most often among males and among young adults aged\n20\u00ad24 years, highlighting the groups that need to be reached\nwith continued and enhanced prevention strategies. Violence\namong young persons is preventable with the implementation\nof evidence-based policies and programs that significantly\nreduce the risk for injuries and associated risk factors. CDC's\nA Comprehensive Technical Package for the Prevention of Youth\nViolence and Associated Risk Behaviors (https://www.cdc.gov/\nviolenceprevention/pdf/yv-technicalpackage.pdf) can help\nstates and communities focus their collaborative action on\nstrategies supported by the best available evidence (2).\nConflict of Interest\nNo conflicts of interest were reported.\n1Division of Violence Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and\nControl, CDC; 2Division of Analysis, Research, and Practice Integration,\nNational Center for Injury Prevention and Control, CDC.\nCorresponding author: Corinne F.
