Eligibility assessment was per-\nformed independently by two investigators (JS, YMH),\nusing pre-designed eligibility forms, with all questions\nresolved by consensus with other authors.\nSearch strategy and databases\nThis updated systematic review and meta-analysis is\nreported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items\nfor Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)\nstatement. We selected relevant studies published between\nMedline, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure\n(CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical\nDatabase, and Wanfang databases. All potentially relevant\narticles including reference lists of retrieved papers were\ninvestigated as full text in English. For ambiguous or\nmissing information, we contacted the authors where pos-\nsible. We used the following combined text and MeSH\nterms: \"Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors,\"\n\"Angiotensin II receptor blockers,\" \"Renin-angiotensin\nsystem,\" \"Meta analysis,\" \"Diabetes mellitus,\" and\n\"Kidney disease\". We also did a manual search, using the\nreference lists of published articles. In the next step, the\ntitle and then the abstract of papers were examined.\nDuplicated articles were excluded, and then potentially\neligible studies were retrieved for perusal in full text. The\nextracted data included first author name or study title,\nyear of publication date, country of origin, number char-\nacteristics of participants, details of intervention, outcome\nmeasures, intervention durations, adverse events, and rel-\native risk ratio (RR) with the corresponding 95% confi-\ndence interval (CI). All articles were read by two\nindependent reviewers (XNS, XZH), who archived data\nfrom the articles according to a standardized data extrac-\ntion form. Disagreements were resolved in all cases by\ndiscussion among our team members.\nQuality assessment\nThe methodological quality of systematic reviews and\nmeta-analyses was assessed by the Assessment of Multiple\nSystematic Reviews (AMSTAR) guidelines.20,21 This form\nof assessment has good inter-rater reliability, validity, and\nresponsibility, and has been widely applied for measuring\nthe methodological quality of systematic reviews.22 Based\non the recommendations of the Canadian Agency for\nDrugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), those with\nscore <4 were considered as low quality, 5\u00ad8 were consid-\nered as moderate, and 9\u00ad11 as high quality.23 Two inde-\npendent reviewers (JS, YMH) appraised the quality of the\nincluded reviews using AMSTAR scores. Each article was\ngiven an AMSTAR total score, based on the number of\nAMSTAR criteria that were fulfilled.24,25 A third reviewer\n(HLZ) served to resolve disputes.\nOutcome measures\nOutcomes were risks of all-cause mortality, ESRD, hyper-\nkalemia (defined as plasma potassium in excess of 5.5\nmmol/l), cough and headache.\nSynthesis of data\nDichotomous outcome data from individual trials were\nanalyzed by using RR measure and corresponding 95% CI.\nData were pooled using the random-effects model when\nthe heterogeneity was significant and the fixed effect\nmodel when the included studies showed homogeneity.\nWe assessed the p value of the Chi-square test to determine\nheterogeneity and I2 to measure for inconsistency.\nHeterogeneity was assessed using the Chi-square test, with\nvalues greater than 50% regarded as being indicative of\nmoderate-to-high heterogeneity and were calculated by\nusing a random-effects meta-analysis model;26 otherwise,\nwe used the fixed-effects meta-analysis model.27 The pos-\nsibility of publication bias was quantified using the Begg's\nShen et al. 3\nto show no bias. This was followed by confirmation with\nperforming a visual inspection of Begg funnel plots in\nwhich RRs were plotted against their standard errors (SEs).\nResults\nDescription of the included studies\nThe study selection process that resulted from our meta-anal-\nysis is shown in Supplementary Material, Figure 1.Atotal of\n295 articles were initially identified. Eventually, eight meta-\nwere conducted in China, three in Australia, one in England,\none in New Zealand, and one in Thailand. Diabetes includ-\ning diabetic kidney disease was found in seven studies and\nfive studies concerned kidney disease including diabetic kid-\nney disease. Four studies compared ARBs with placebo, and\nseven studies comparedACEis with control using other anti-\nhypertensive agents. The age of the participants ranged from\n18\u00ad80 years. The duration of studies ranged from six months\nto nine years. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the meta-\nanalyses included in the analysis.\nRisk of bias within studies\nAs shown in Supplementary Material, Table 1, the range in\nthe total AMSTAR score for the eight meta-analyses was\ntion (SD)) was 8.5 (0.77). Study quality in general was\ngood: five of eight of studies had an AMSTAR score of 9,\nand the other three had an AMSTAR score of 7\u00ad8. Based on\nthe recommendations of the CADTH, five studies were con-\nsidered high quality, and three considered moderate quality.\nPublication bias was quantified using the Begg's and\nEgger's test, p>0.05 was considered to be no bias. The\nevidence for publication bias.\nPrimary outcomes\nAll-cause mortality.Seven studies reported all-cause mor-\ntality (Supplementary Material, Table 2). Treatment with\nACEis/ARBs significantly reduced all-cause mortality\nfore, the fixed-effects model was used for statistical analy-\nsis (Supplementary Material, Figure 2(a)), the symmetric\nfunnel plot suggested no significant publication bias (Sup-\nplementary Material, Figure 2(b)). Specifically, the level\nof death protection was significant by ACEis (RR: 0.85,\npublication bias was found in the symmetric funnel plot\n(Figure 1(b)).\nFigure 1.

Prevalent in\npatients with diabetes or kidney disease is comorbidity\nwith hypertension. ACEis and ARBs have been recom-\nmended for clinical treatment.43,44 Previous studies have\ndemonstrated that ACEis and ARBs protect against the\nprogression to renal failure in patients with kidney dis-\nease.44\u00ad46 In this updated meta-analysis, both ACEis and\nARBs are protective for the development of ESRD in peo-\nple with diabetes and kidney disease. Furthermore, ACEis\nare generally superior to ARBs in minimizing the risks of\nall-cause mortality and hyperkalemia. A major concern for\nthe use of ACEis relate to the occurrence of cough. A pos-\nsible rationale for the additional benefit of ACEis in con-\ntrast to ARBs on death protection may relate to\nbradykinin levels to stimulate glucose metabolism49 and\ntrigger cough. In cases where the cough is intolerable,\nARBs fit patients at risk of renal failure.\nThere are several potential limitations of this study.\nFirst, our results are subject to limitations inherent to any\nmeta-analysis based on pooling data from different meta-\nanalyses. Meta-analyses of ACEis and ARBs were not\nequivalent. Second, there is the possibility of overlap trials\nbetween the included meta-analyses. Third, substantial\ndifferences exist in the doses of the used drugs, duration of\nintervention, period of follow-up, and study population. It\nFigure 5.
