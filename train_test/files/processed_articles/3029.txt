Participants without\ndiabetes in the lowest compared with the highest serum\nfolate tertile had more than twice the risk of CVD mor-\ntality after adjustment for age and sex (relative risk\nThis increased risk for participants in the lowest tertile\nwas attenuated after adjustment for CVD risk factors\nwere not significantly associated with total mortality,\nalthough the age- and sex-adjusted risk was increased\nfor participants in the lowest compared with highest\nparticipants with diabetes were unstable because of the\nsmall sample size (n=52).\nConclusion: These data suggest that low serum folate\nconcentrations are associated with an increased risk of\nCVD mortality among adults who do not have diabetes.\nLOW SERUM folate concentra-\ntions have been linked to ca-\nrotid artery stenosis,1 pre-\nsumably through folate's role\nin homocysteine metabo-\nlism, and by association to an increased\nrisk of atherosclerosis. Homocysteine is\nformed during the metabolism of methio-\nnine, an essential amino acid released dur-\ning protein digestion.2-5 Remethylation of\nhomocysteine to methionine occurs\nthrough 2 pathways, one of which re-\nquires folate as a methyl donor and vita-\nas a cofactor.2-5 Thus, low serum\nfolate concentrations could lead to el-\nevated homocysteine concentrations. In-\ndeed, several studies6-10 have shown that\nserum folate concentrations are inversely\nrelated to homocysteine concentrations in\nhealthy individuals. Elevated homocyste-\nine levels have been associated with an in-\ncreased risk of cardiovascular disease\n(CVD), as summarized in recent review ar-\nticles.2,3,11 A number of potential mecha-\nnisms through which homocysteine may\nbe atherogenic have been proposed; ho-\nmocysteine may exert a direct toxic ef-\nfect on endothelial cells, promote oxida-\ntion of low-density lipoprotein, increase\nDNA synthesis in and promote the pro-\nliferation of smooth muscle cells, or\nNevertheless, results from prospec-\ntive cohort studies of serum folate and\nCVD have been inconsistent; some found\na significant association,13-15 whereas oth-\nlationship. We used data from a nation-\nally representative sample of US adults who\nwere followed up for a median of 14 years\nto test whether serum folate concentra-\ntions were associated with risk of CVD\nmortality independent of established CVD\nrisk factors. We also tested whether age,14\nFrom the National Center for\nHealth Statistics, Centers for\nDisease Control and\nPrevention, Hyattsville Md.\nDr Loria is now with the\nNational Heart, Lung, and\nBlood Institute, Bethesda, Md.\nDr Feldman is now with the\nCenter for Health Affairs,\nProject HOPE, Bethesda, Md.\n\u00a92000 American Medical Association.

Participants\nwith diabetes who were in the lowest tertile were more\nlikely to be current smokers, have less than a high school\neducation, and drink fewer alcoholic beverages per week\ncompared with participants in other tertiles (P.05). Par-\nticipants without diabetes in the lowest tertile were\nyounger compared with participants in other tertiles,\nwhereas participants in the highest tertile were less likely\nto be current smokers (P.05). Other established CVD\nrisk factors were not significantly associated with serum\nfolate tertile in either group.\npants with diabetes had died, 12 of them from CVD. The\nRR of dying from CVD or all causes for participants in the\nlowest vs highest serum folate tertile appeared to be higher\namong participants with diabetes compared with those\nwithout diabetes (data not shown). Risk estimates for this\ngroup are not presented because they were unstable, due\nto the small number of participants with diabetes (n=52).\nAmong participants without diabetes, 122 died dur-\ning follow-up, 49 from CVD (Table 2). Participants with-\nout diabetes in the lowest compared with the highest ter-\ntile had more than twice the risk of CVD mortality after\nadjustment for age and sex (RR, 2.64; 95% confidence\npants in the lowest tertile was slightly attenuated after\nadjustment for CVD risk factors (RR, 2.28; 95% CI,\nparticipants without diabetes in the middle compared with\nfolate tertiles were not significantly associated with to-\ntal mortality, although the age- and sex-adjusted risk was\nincreased for participants in the lowest compared with\nCOMMENT\nAfter following up participants in this probability sample\nof the US population for 12 to 16 years, we found a sig-\nnificant association between serum folate tertile and CVD\nmortality that differed by whether the participant had dia-\nbetes at baseline. Participants without diabetes at base-\nline who had concentrations in the lowest but not the\nmiddle tertile compared with those in the highest tertile\nhad more than a 2-fold increased risk of dying from CVD.\nWe found a similar pattern in risk of dying from any cause,\nalthough the magnitude of the risk was not as high as\nthat for CVD mortality, suggesting that death from CVD\naccounts for most of the increased total mortality risk.\nAlthough risk estimates associated with the lowest ter-\nMETHODS\nThis study used data from the NHANES II Mortality Study,\na prospective study of participants examined in the Second\nNationalHealthandNutritionExaminationSurvey(NHANES\ngraphic, medical history, nutritional, clinical, and labora-\ntory data on a multistage probability sample of the civilian,\nof age were oversampled 4 to 1.21 The examination response\nrate was 73%.21 The vital status of NHANES II participants\nwho were 30 to 75 years of age at their examination was as-\nof follow-up. Vital status was assessed by searching the Na-\ntional Death Index and the Social Security Administration\nDeath Master File.22 Cause of death was obtained from the\nNational Center for Health Statistics Multiple Cause of Death\nfile or death certificates and coded according to the Interna-\ntional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9).22 De-\ncedents withunderlying causes ofdeathfromICD-9code390\nto 459 were defined as having died from CVD.\nBlood was drawn from participants at baseline in mobile ex-\namination centers. Serum samples were shipped on dry ice\ntotheCentersforDiseaseControlandPreventionandstored\nat -20\u00b0C until analyzed.23,24 Two different assays were used\nto measure serum folate concentrations in NHANES II.23,24\nA microbiologic method23 was used during the first half of\nthesurvey,whereasaradioassay(Quanta-Countfolateradio-\nassay kit; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, Calif) was used\nduring the second half because of quality control problems\nwith the microbiologic method.23 Previous analysis showed\nthattheassaymethodswerenotcomparablethroughoutthe\nfullrangeoffolateconcentrations.24 Amorerecentmethodo-\nlogicstudy25 recommendedtheuseofassay-specificreference\nrangesforevaluatingfolatedata.Forthisreason,weusedassay-\nspecific tertile cut points to categorize folate status (9.5 and\ndioassay, respectively).\nRed blood cell folate concentrations were also mea-\nsured in NHANES II, using the same 2 assays as serum fo-\nlate.23,24 Although red blood cell folate may be a better in-\ndicator of long-term folate status, we do not present risk\nestimates because a large percentage (26%) of the 899 eli-\ngible participants were missing these data. Serum B12\ncon-\ncentrations were also measured; however, we do not pre-\nsent these data because a nonpurified porcine intrinsic factor\nwas used as a binder (E. Gunter, e-mail communication,\nApril 1, 1999), making it susceptible to generating false el-\nevations in subjects who were cobalamin deficient.26,27\nBlood pressure was measured twice in the sitting po-\nsition by a physician using a mercury sphygmomanom-\neter.28 The average of the 2 blood pressure readings was used\nin our analyses.

Serum folate tertiles were derived from all eligible participants, including those with cardiovascular disease at\nbaseline, using cut points dependent on laboratory method (microbiologic: 9.5 and 16.8 nmol/L; radioassay: 10.6 and 16.8 nmol/L). NHANES II indicates Second\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\nTo convert serum total cholesterol from millimoles per liter to milligrams per deciliter, divide by 0.0259.\nTertiles differed from each other (P.05).\nBurchard reagent.29 Diabetes status was positive if a par-\nticipant reported having been told by a physician that he\nor she had diabetes, was using insulin at baseline, had a\n2-hour post\u00adoral glucose challenge plasma glucose level\na fasting plasma glucose level (with no challenge) greater\nthan or equal to 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL). At baseline, CVD\nwas defined as having a history of physician-reported heart\nattack or stroke or symptoms of angina, as determined by\na modified Rose questionnaire. Participants were asked to\nrate their recreational physical activity as much, moder-\nate, or little or no activity.\nSerum folate concentrations were measured on a 10% ran-\ndom sample of NHANES II participants.30 Serum folate data\nwere missing for 11% of the eligible 899 NHANES II Mor-\ntality Study participants primarily because of disruptions\ncaused by the change in assays. There were few differ-\nences in the distributions of selected baseline characteris-\ntics among participants with missing compared with avail-\nable serum folate data (data not shown). However, serum\ntotal cholesterol levels were significantly higher (P=.05)\namong participants with missing data compared with those\nwith available data. An additional 2% of participants were\nmissing data for established CVD risk factors. Finally, an-\nother 10.5% were excluded because they had a history of\nCVD at baseline. After all exclusions, there were 689 par-\nticipants for the main analyses.\nRelative risks (RRs) of CVD and total mortality were esti-\nmated using Cox proportional hazards models. Person-\nyears of follow-up for each participant were calculated from\nbaseline examination to the date of death or December 31,\n1992. The proportional hazards assumption was met as\njudged by including time-dependent variables in initial Cox\nmodels. The RR estimates were initially adjusted for age\n(years) and sex. Multivariate models also included race (Af-\nrican American vs other), education level (12 vs 12\nyears), smoking status (current vs past and never smok-\ners), leisure-time activity level (light, moderate, heavy), al-\ncohol consumption (weekly frequency of beer, wine, and\nliquor consumption), diabetes status (yes, no), serum to-\ntal cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, and body mass\nindex. All analyses were run using SUDAAN31 and sample\nweights to account for the complex sample design,21\nexcept those involving time-dependent variables, which\nwere run without weights using the Statistical Analysis\nInteractions between serum folate concentration and\nselected covariates were assessed by including interaction\nterms in preliminary multivariate models. There were no\nsignificant interactions with age, sex, race, or alcohol con-\nsumption. In contrast, the associations between serum fo-\nlate tertile and CVD and total mortality differed by whether\nthe participant had diabetes at baseline (P=.04 and P=.03,\nrespectively). For this reason, we performed analyses strati-\nfied by diabetes status.\n\u00a92000 American Medical Association.

This RR\nwas lower than that estimated for participants without\ndiabetes in our study using essentially the same cut-\npoint (microbiologic) as our lowest serum tertile. An-\nother study found a 70% increased risk of dying from coro-\nnary heart disease (CHD) among participants with serum\nfolate concentrations below 6.8 nmol/L compared with\nthose above 13.6 nmol/L (microbiologic).13 Three other\nstudies used a combination of CHD incidence and mor-\ntality as their end points. Two of these studies16,18 used\nlower cut points for their low serum folate group and\nshorter follow-up periods than ours, but neither found\na significantly increased CHD risk. The third study,14 based\non data from the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up\nStudy, found a more than 2-fold increased CHD risk\namong persons 35 to 55 years of age with serum folate\nconcentrations less than 9.9 nmol/L compared with those\nabove 21.8 nmol/L (microbiologic). Finally, plasma\nfolate concentrations were inversely associated with\ncarotid artery stenosis in a cross-sectional study.1\nOne limitation of this study is that our measure of fo-\nlate status is based on a single serum folate concentration.\nSerum folate is labile and may not be indicative of long-\nterm folate status, because it is sensitive to fluctuations in\nrecent intake and metabolism,4,5 potentially leading to mis-\nclassification of some individuals. Such misclassification\ncould have weakened the associations found in this study.\nIn addition, 2 different laboratory methods were used in\nNHANESIItomeasureserumfolateconcentration.Weused\nassay-specific cut points for tertiles to reduce potential mis-\nclassification error arising from the use of 2 methods.\nAnother limitation is the relatively small sample size.\nWhen combined with the large SEs resulting from the\ncomplex sample design, the small sample may have con-\ntributed instability to risk estimates and could account\nfor the borderline significance among participants with-\nout diabetes after adjustment for CVD risk factors. When\nwe repeated the analysis to include baseline CVD cases,\nwe found almost identical results that were statistically\nsignificant with a larger sample size and more statistical\nclusion of baseline CVD cases, who may have changed\ntheir dietary or other health behaviors as a result of their\ndisease, could introduce a bias, apparently no bias was\nintroduced, because the results did not materially change.\nThe small sample also prohibited stratification by smok-\ning status, so we cannot exclude the possibility of re-\nsidual confounding by cigarette smoking. In addition, the\nassessment of CVD used to exclude participants at base-\nline was based on self-report, which could have biased\nour findings in either direction. Finally, mortality was\nprobably underascertained in the NHANES II Mortality\nStudy because of the passive methods used,22 resulting\nin misclassification of some participants. Because se-\nrum folate concentration was unlikely to be related to\nsuch misclassification, risk estimates were probably un-\naffected; however, the statistical power may have been\nreduced.33 Such a reduction in power could account for\nthe borderline significant risk associated with the low-\nest tertile among participants without diabetes.\nNonetheless, the RR of CVD mortality associated\nwith low serum folate concentrations among partici-\npants without diabetes was greater than 2 in this study,\nwhich used a nationally representative sample, con-\ntrolled for established CVD risk factors, and had a rela-\ntively long follow-up period. Our finding that the risk\nassociated with serum folate and CVD mortality differs\nby diabetes status needs to be confirmed in larger stud-\nies in which risks can be reliably estimated among adults\nwith diabetes. Among participants without diabetes, se-\nrum folate concentrations below 9.5 or 10.6 nmol/L, us-\ning microbiologic and radioassay methods, respec-\ntively, compared with those above 16.8 nmol/L were\nassociated with a more than 2-fold increased risk of dy-\ning from CVD. Our cut points for the lowest tertile are\nconsistent with estimates of serum folate concentra-\ntions needed to prevent an elevation of homocysteine from\nlogic assay and radioassay, respectively. Although the cut\npoints used in this study were statistically derived, they\nsuggest that a considerable proportion of the adult US\ncentrations that might have increased their risk of dying\nfrom CVD. Given this relatively large proportion poten-\ntially at risk, clinical trials are needed to confirm that low\nfolate status does confer increased CVD risk and to es-\ntablish adequate intake and serum concentrations for pre-\nventing CVD. If the folate-CVD relationship can be con-\nfirmed, then we will need to assess whether recent efforts\nto fortify the US food supply with folic acid have in-\ncreased folate intakes and serum concentrations enough\nto decrease the proportion at risk of CVD.\nTable 2.
