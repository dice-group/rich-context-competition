Conditional cash transfer is an evidence-based approach to reduce stimulant use and optimize\nHIV/AIDS prevention, but questions remain regarding implementation in resource-limited settings. We conducted\nformative qualitative research to enhance acceptability of a conditional cash transfer intervention aimed at reducing\namphetamine-type substance use and HIV risk among female entertainment/sex workers and inform implementation\nas part of a large cluster randomized trial. We conducted in-depth interviews with 30 female entertainment/sex\nworkers. Interviews were digitally recorded and conducted and transcribed in Khmer. English transcripts were read\nfor emerging themes and an initial coding scheme was developed. Data were coded using open and axial coding to\nclarify and consolidate initial themes. While most participants expressed enthusiasm for the intervention, financial\nand transportation issues emerged as key barriers to participation. The proposed incentive of USD$1 per screen was\nregarded as unacceptable and participants identified a need for transportation assistance. Participants also expressed\nconcerns about directly observed urine specimen collection. Finally, while most participants found the 4-week aftercare\nprogram acceptable, the need for enjoyable as well as educational content was emphasized. Revisions to the protocol\ntaking these data into account were made to optimize the acceptability of the intervention and the implementation of\nthe trial. Findings identified key concerns and preferences that were taken into account in the final trial protocol. In\nparticular, financial and transportation issues were identified as critical barriers to participation, with the potential to\nimpact both intervention uptake and trial feasibility. Results demonstrate the value of formative qualitative research\nfor clinical trial planning and implementation, particularly in settings where little is known about acceptability of\ninterventions or willingness to participate.\n",

A key driver of the epidemic is transactional\nsex work. In epidemiological studies, prevalence among\nfemale sex workers, referred to in Cambodia as female enter-\ntainment and sex workers (FESW), has ranged from 15.5%\nuse illicit drugs, principally amphetamine-type stimulants\n(ATS) which are associated with increased risk of HIV and\nother sexually transmitted infections (STI) in this setting\ntions in Cambodia currently target ATS use among FESW,\nand there is a need for novel approaches which target ATS\nuse as a driver of the epidemic in FESW in Cambodia and\nother resource-limited settings.\nConditional cash transfer (CCT) programs provide tangi-\nble rewards as positive reinforcement for the achievement of\nspecific behavioral goals and have been used to impact a\nrange of health outcomes including infant mortality, child\nhealth and nutrition, tuberculosis, immunization, and HIV\nbeen shown to mitigate the negative effects of structural fac-\ntors, such as food insecurity and poverty, on health outcomes\n(Forde et al., 2011). In the drug treatment field, an extensive\nliterature has examined the efficacy of contingency manage-\nment, an evidence-based form of CCT where individuals\nreceive escalating financial reinforcement for abstinence.\nFounded on behavioral economics, contingency manage-\nment yields clinically meaningful, short-term reductions in\nstimulant use and has been utilized to promote HIV-related\nhealth behavior change among drug users (Crawford and\nprograms for stimulant users have shown that these short-\nterm reductions in stimulant use promote enhanced retention\nin other drug treatments and better overall treatment out-\nThe Cambodia Integrated HIV and Drug Prevention\nImplementation (CIPI) program includes the following inter-\nvention components: (1) a 12-week, CCT intervention where\nwomen complete thrice-weekly urine screening visits and\nreceive small financial incentives for ATS abstinence fol-\nlowed by (2) a four-session cognitive-behavioral aftercare\ngroup for those who attend at least half (>18) of the CCT\nurine screening visits. The CIPI program also includes a\nmicrofinance opportunity consisting of financial literacy\ntraining and the possibility to apply for small business loans\nfor women who do not use ATS or those who complete the\nCCT plus aftercare intervention with confirmed abstinence.\nCIPI is utilizing an implementation science approach to\nevaluate this evidence-based intervention to reduce ATS and\nHIV risk among FESW using a cluster randomized stepped-\nwedge trial design. The trial involves the sequential rollout in\n10 Cambodian provinces of a 16-week program that com-\nbines the 12-week CCT program with a 4-week group-based\nPrevious research shows that formative research can sup-\nport intervention development and clinical trial design and\nimplementation through improved understanding of the\nmechanisms and effects of interventions by exploring the\nattitudes of target groups, identifying barriers to trial partici-\npation and intervention uptake, improving ethical informed\nconsent, and informing intervention design and evaluation\nods, with their capacity to identify and describe beliefs and\npractices, are especially useful in providing specific, con-\ncrete understandings of particular groups or settings and in\nexploring complex beliefs and attitudes about the acceptabil-\nity and feasibility of particular programs or interventions.\nThese attributes mean that qualitative methods are well\nsuited to formative research designed to inform more effec-\ntive interventions and enhance evaluations of their efficacy.\nHowever, studies reporting the impact of qualitative data in\ninforming interventions and shaping implementation in the\ncontext of clinical trials remain rare. The goal of this qualita-\ntive study was to inform the content, implementation, and\nevaluation of the proposed intervention by assessing accept-\nability and feasibility among ATS-using FESW, focusing on\nbarriers and facilitators to engagement in CCT and percep-\ntions of potential aftercare components.\nMethods\nAdaptation of the CCT and cognitive-behavioral aftercare\nintervention was informed by the Assessment, Decision,\nAdministration, Production, Topical experts, Integration,\nTraining, and Testing (ADAPT-ITT) model for modifying or\ntailoring evidence-based HIV interventions for new target\npopulations while remaining consistent to the core elements\nand internal logic of the prototype work (Wingood and\nDiClemente, 2008). Consistent with the ADAPT-ITT model,\nthe process of adaptation was iterative and the development\nphase for the trial was informed by qualitative research with\nthe target population, FESW who use ATS. This article\ndescribes the processes and results of the formative phase of\nthe adaptation of the intervention, including consultation on\nkey elements, activities, attributes, and delivery methods.\nDuring 2013, we conducted in-depth interviews with\nFESW (n=30) in five provinces. Eligibility criteria were that\nparticipants were aged at least 18years, biologically female,\nunderstood spoken Khmer, used SMARTgirl (SG) services\noperated by our Cambodian partner FHI360, and reported\nboth ATS use and at least two sexual partners in the last\nmonth. SG is the most widely disseminated HIV prevention\nDixon et al. 3\nprogram in Cambodia aimed at FESW. It was implemented\nnationally in 2009 as a social marketing health promotion\nprogram aimed at women working in the high-risk entertain-\nment sector. SG uses a \"club\" recruitment system and tar-\ngeted communication tools to promote use of health\ninformation and referrals for HIV testing, STI, and reproduc-\ntive health services. In each locale where SG is implemented,\nlocal non-governmental organizations (NGO) are the facili-\nof access and trust, participants for the study were recruited\nthrough neighbourhood- and venue-based outreach by SG\nprogram staff. Following verbal informed consent, women\nwere interviewed at SG program offices in each province.\nInterviews were conducted in Khmer by trained interviewers\nand took between 30 minutes and 2 hours to complete.\nParticipants were remunerated with a USD$3 phone card and\nprovided with transportation assistance.\nInterviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verba-\ntim in Khmer. Transcripts were checked for accuracy against\nthe original recordings before being translated into English\nby a certified translator. Following the general tenets and\nprinciples of grounded theory (Strauss and Corbin, 1990),\nwe analyzed the data using an inductive approach. Interview\nnarratives were scrutinized and emerging themes discussed\nand refined to develop an initial coding scheme. Data were\nformally coded using both open and axial coding to clarify\nand consolidate initial themes (Ezzy, 2002). The Cambodian\nNational Ethics Committee and the University of California\nSan Francisco Institutional Review Board provided ethical\napproval for the study.\nResults\nParticipants'accounts identified three key barriers and facili-\ntators to CCT: the amount of financial remuneration for the\nmultiple visits, the need for transportation assistance to\nattend the visits, and issues regarding urine toxicology\nscreening. Women also provided feedback on potential com-\nponents of the aftercare program.\nCCT intervention\nCCT interventions provide opportunities for behavioral\nchange by incentivizing, enabling, and empowering par-\nticipants and have been shown to be effective in increas-\ning healthy behaviors among vulnerable populations in\nlow- and middle-income countries (Baird et al., 2012). As\nwell as providing a source of short-term income, CCT\nprograms can facilitate the first and often most difficult\nsteps toward lasting health and lifestyle changes. CCT or\nthe use of financial incentives may also help to reduce\nbarriers to healthcare among marginalized populations by\naddressing indirect and opportunity costs (Ranganathan\nOur previous research identified occupational functional-\nity as an important determinant of ATS use among sex work-\ners in Cambodia (Maher et al., 2011). ATS was described as\na \"power drug\" (thnam kam-lang) which allowed women to\nwork long hours and increase their income by seeing more\nclients but increased their risk of STI (Couture et al., 2012).\nBy providing women with income support to compensate for\nreduced working hours, CCT interventions have the potential\nto mitigate occupational ATS use.\nWhile the idea of an intervention that paid women to\nreduce or refrain from using drugs was initially met with sur-\nprise, participants understood the concept and the potential\nfor cash incentives to reduce the occupational use of ATS.\nHowever, there were concerns that not all FESW would par-\nticipate in such a program, particularly those who were\n\"addicted,\" raising the potential for selection bias:\n[Do you think this amount [USD$84] can have an impact on\ntheir decision to reduce their drug abuse within 12 weeks?] It\ncan. Yes, but only those who are not so addicted can get it. But\nif they are so addicted it is difficult. (Chorvy, 22-year-old\nwoman)\nI think that for some it is possible. For others, I dare not say.\n[Why?] For those who are so addicted, I dare not say. In my area,\neven their child was sold at 700 or 800 dollars and they did not\nuse the money to run any business but to buy drugs. (Haratey,\nOur original proposal for the intervention was a 12-week\nprogram in which participants, who were required to attend\nthree urine screens weekly, would receive USD$1 cash if they\ntested negative for recent ATS use. Women who provided\nthree negative screens in 1\nweek would receive weekly\nand 9\u00ad12, respectively. The total maximum amount over the\n12-week program was USD$84. Almost all women felt\nstrongly that USD$1 per visit was too small to be attractive to\nFESW. Because many women could earn substantially more\nfrom sex work, participants felt that the proposed incentive\nwas likely to attract only very poor FESW:\n[T]his amount of money [$USD 1] could not be enough for them\nto eat, just like how much is one box of rice? One box of rice\ncosts six thousand [riel] already, three thousand riel each and\nhow about paying for motorbike-taxi and water fee? So it could\nnot be enough for them. (Chorphum, 30-year-old woman)\nMost participants felt that the minimum acceptable\namount per visit would be USD$2\u00adUSD$3 per day. This\nwould mean that women could potentially earn US$14\u00ad\nUS$18 per week with the bonuses:\nAbout two or three dollars they could buy something to eat.\nDon't give them too much as they may buy drugs. (Leahkhena,\n4 Methodological Innovations\nHowever, some women felt that women should receive\nUS$5 or more per visit:\nMaybe five dollars or they would think that this would waste\ntheir time ... They think it wastes their time for sleep and wastes\ntheir time for travel. But for me, I don't think so. I think that [it's\nnot] a waste of time because we travel for our health. (Sophary,\nSome participants felt that for women who were moti-\nvated to stop using ATS, the escalating schedule of weekly\nbonuses made the program more acceptable:\nI believe they want it because not only this one dollar. If in this\none week the results for the three tests are negative, they can get\nfive dollars. (Viriya, 23-year-old woman)\nOne dollar is not much but it's just that we think we will get\nmuch more in the future. As you said one dollar is little but when\nwe stop it for a long time, we get 84 dollars then we feel happy.\nIn short, this one dollar could not [make them] reduce it, but\nwhat's most important is the bonus ... Yes, I think the bonus\ncould. (Sohpa, 32-year-old woman)\nThe data indicated that the proposed incentive of US$1\nper negative urine toxicology result would be unlikely to\nattract a representative sample of FESW. Along with heavy\nATS users, participants suggested that younger women and\nwomen working in entertainment venues would also require\nhigher incentives to participate. FESW felt strongly that if\nthe incentive was set too low, the cost of participation would\nbe higher for women who continue to use ATS as this group\nwould earn less (because they will test positive for ATS) but\nstill need to pay for their transport costs and commit the same\namount of time attending urine screening. From a trial per-\nspective, this could potentially lead to differential attrition\nwith FESW who continue to use ATS being more likely to be\nlost to follow-up. In response to these data, we raised the\nbase incentive to USD$2 for each negative urine screen and\nthe weekly bonuses to USD$8, USD$10, and USD$12 for\nHowever, most women also indicated that they would not\nbe prepared to attend the CCT program if their transportation\ncosts were not covered:\n[What do you think about this one dollar?] Think that it is little.\nYes, this amount will be all spent for motorbike-taxi to come to\nmeet you. This is for a near place but how about the place so far\naway? If you come to pick me up back and forth it will be okay.\n(Phavy, 20-year-old woman)\n[I]f I am far away, I refuse it. I'd say that one dollar is impossible.\n[So how much would be possible?] Two dollars. [Two dollars\nincluding the travel expense?] Yes. It's also good for two dollars.\nI'm afraid that if we give just one dollar, they would criticize it.\n(Phany, 19-year-old woman)\nThese data suggested that the proposed incentive payment\nof USD$1 would not be sufficient to incentivize women to\nreduce their ATS use and cover the costs of their transporta-\ntion to the program:\nWe just get one dollar after the test. If it [ATS] is found, the\nmoney is not given and if it is not found, we get only one dollar\nwhich is even not enough for motorbike-taxi. (Ratana, 20-year-\nold woman)\nIn response, we revised the trial protocol to include either\nUSD$2 travel reimbursement for those who arranged their\nown transportation or the option of being transported to visits\nby outreach staff who then received the USD$2.\nUrine toxicology screening\nThe majority of participants expressed concerns about speci-\nmen provision. Almost all women indicated they would be\nunwilling to provide a specimen under direct observation as\nrequired by the original draft protocol. Women suggested\nseveral alternatives, including using a curtain or a modesty\nscreen below the waist:\nWe need some concealment as well and women shall not be so\nnude shamelessly ... If they ask to take our urine they have a can\nto store urine. In short, for the test if they don't get in we go to\nthe bathroom alone. [And if the female staff stands in front of\nthe room, is it okay?] If she stands in front of the room that's\nokay. (Srey Neang, 27-year-old woman)\nLet's say, [I] feel shy when someone enters the bathroom with\nme, feel shy. [For instance, if you get in, I turn my face, don't\nlook at you, how do you feel?] No problem for that. [But if you\nget in, for example, the whole curtain is placed to hide you in\nthe bathroom, but I just stand outside of the curtain in the same\nbathroom, how does it feel?] No problem if nothing can be\nseen as it is hidden with the curtain. (Chorvy, 22-year-old\nwoman)\nWhile a solution to this privacy issue would have been to\nuse tamper-resistant (heat-coded) specimen collection con-\ntainers, the project budget did not allow for this. However, in\nresponse to the data, we obviated the need for direct observa-\ntion during specimen collection using a Specimen Validity\nTest on each sample to check for adulteration prior to\ntesting.\nWomen were also asked about preferences for the loca-\ntion and timing of urine toxicology screening. In relation to\nthe location, because the interviewees were recruited by, and\nfamiliar with, their local SG club, almost all participants\nnominated this as the most acceptable location for urine\nscreening:\nI think it is good at the [SMARTgirl] club. Coming to the club\nmay help us release stress, feeling refreshed. [Why?] I once\ncame here and had fun and had blood test something like this.\n(Phany, 19-year-old woman)\nDixon et al. 5\n[Where should we come for a test?] It's okay to come to our\nclub, let's go. [SMARTgirl Club?] Yes, we have a meeting room\nas normal like before. (Leahkhena, 29-year-old woman)\nViews about the most suitable times for specimen collec-\ntion were mixed. Approximately half the women felt that the\nmost acceptable time to present for urine screening was in\nthe morning:\nComing in the morning is better perhaps around eight or nine\no'clock as we are afraid that in the daytime women would be\nbusy. (Chakriya, 25-year-old woman)\nThe other half of the sample felt that the afternoon and, in\nparticular, the early afternoon was the most acceptable time:\nWe work at night, we feel sleepy ... If we make the appointment\nbefore 2pm, we feel rather exhausted. (Rumdoul, 23-year-old\nwoman)\nIn response, we amended the trial protocol to provide for\nurine testing on a drop-in basis between 8\na.m. and 5\np.m.\ndaily. Participants can choose between two schedules:\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday; or Tuesday, Thursday, and\nSaturday. Given the clear preference for SG clubs, we pro-\nceeded with our original plan to conduct urine screening at\nthese locations. In some provinces, once the trial was under-\nway, it became apparent that women who anticipated posi-\ntive results often failed to present for testing (~10%\u00ad15%).\nIn these cases, SG outreach workers conducted home visits\nto collect the specimen.\nAftercare program\nParticipants were asked what they would like to see featured\nin the weekly aftercare sessions. Women expressed a desire\nto receive information or education about drug use and sex-\nual/reproductive health:\nThe topic on education about reduction of addictive substances.\n[What else? What other activities?] And education about\nwomen's health, birth spacing and blood testing for HIV [and]\nsexually transmitted diseases. (Haratey, 24-year-old woman)\nHowever, there were some concerns that not all FESW\nwould be interested in this type of educational content:\n[Do you think if they raise a topic about the reasons why women\nstart to use drugs for discussion in our after-care group?] Some\ndon't like to listen. [Why?] Because of feeling bored ... [So\nwhat do you think it is good or not if we include it?] Maybe it is\nnot possible because they don't listen to it. (Chamnan, 27-year-\nold woman)\nParticipants also identified a need for practical skills and\nstrategies to avoid using ATS with friends, partners, and cli-\nI think that if we can stop it we have to say no, [we have to be\nable to] answer that we don't want. (Phavy, 20-year-old woman)\nRefusal skills were identified as particularly important in\nthe context of relationships with partners and clients who use\nBecause I think that first they want to say it too but don't dare to.\nSo when they get that help and motivation, they dare to say it,\ndare to say no with guests. Dare to say no to drug use. \"If you\nwant to do that [have sex] with me, I can, but if you want to use\n[drugs], do so alone.\" [Do you think this skill is useful for\nthem?] I think it's useful for them. It helps them to be brave ...\nThey dare to say [no], dare to object to it without being afraid.\n(Haratey, 24-year-old woman)\nSome women emphasized the need for strategies for deal-\ning with stress and/or anger in the aftercare component:\nAs for my feeling, sometimes I also feel bad-tempered ... when\nwe don't use it, we feel like this. [So if I teach them how to\nmanage anger, do you think it is important for our program in the\nfourth month or not?] It's important because most of them get\nmore and more angry. (Chorphum, 30-year-old woman)\nWhile there was some receptivity to the idea of including\nmeditation exercises in the aftercare component, many par-\nticipants felt this would be unsuitable for most women, par-\nticularly those still using ATS:\nSome may get bored. [Why?] Because they can't stay still. They\nsmoke drugs, let's say, today you come to examine their urine,\nthey smoked drugs last night, but the drugs' effects are not gone\nimmediately. Its effect may somewhat remain. When it is quiet,\nthey get bored. (Ratana, 20-year-old woman)\nThere were also some concerns that meditation was too\ntraditional, especially for younger women:\nIt's [meditation] too traditional. [So what should we do to avoid\nbeing too traditional?] As I said, we do it like having fun in the\nprogram such as lucky draw for prizes or buffet and then we talk\nto them ... I think that it's me who has to concentrate my feeling.\nIf you tell me to concentrate my feeling I can't do it because it's\nmy feeling. It may explode and I will die. I bang my head against\nthe wall [laughter]. (Morokoth, 18-year-old woman)\nWhile this may indicate a lack of understanding of the\ngoals of meditation, several women expressed a fear of\n\"thinking too much\" (kit chreon). This is consistent with\nKhmer cultural beliefs which associate \"thinking too much\"\nwith poor health outcomes (Frye and D'Avanzo, 1994;\n[B]ut for users when using it and being asked to do this\n[meditation] it's their brain problem, they would think a lot ...\nDoing meditation is the best way but mostly for non-users, good\nfor non-users, users could not do this. It is the best way for\n6 Methodological Innovations\nnon-users, but it is very difficult for users when staying quiet,\nthey tend to think a lot. Thinking a lot may lead to brain damage.\n(Sohpa, 32-year-old woman)\nWhile women felt it might be possible to meditate in a\ngroup while attending the aftercare program, an overwhelm-\ning majority doubted that these skills would be practiced out-\nside the group, often citing practical constraints such as\nfinding time or room to meditate in cramped living\nconditions:\nBecause no one does meditation, just watch over the children all\nthe time ... If there is no gathering and after they return to their\nhomes, they will not do it ... They do it or anything only in front\nof you. And then no one could take exercise [home] as everyone\nthinks of only making his or her living. (Rumdoul, 23-year-old\nwoman)\nWhile just over half the sample indicated that they per-\nsonally would be prepared to do meditation, almost all par-\nticipants voiced concerns that others might find it too boring.\nHowever, this apparent bias against meditation may be\nexplained by the fact that most participants understood medi-\ntation in a religious sense, as opposed to the meditation exer-\ncises envisaged in the original protocol. Many participants\nalso articulated a desire to learn stress relief techniques\nwhich informed our decision to incorporate brief meditation\nexercises into the aftercare program.\nImportantly, most women identified entertainment and\n\"having fun\" as an indispensable component of the aftercare\nprogram and suggested many activities:\nI request you to start the meeting once per week such as program\nfor exercises or dances or comedies. Just play what we call Leak\nKanseng game, we feel exhausted. This means that we stop this\nand we don't think about it. We can play any entertainment\ngame. (Chakriya, 25-year-old woman)\nLet's say, there are a lot [of games we could play] such as hitting\nclay pots, Lot Anteak [Cambodian version of jump rope]. Boh\nAngkunh [knocking down large seeds] is also good. (Srey\nNeang, 27-year-old woman)\nA key part of having fun was having lucky draws and\nprizes. This was seen as particularly important given that\nwomen would not be incentivized to attend the aftercare pro-\ngram. Many women had previous exposure to lucky draws as\nparticipants in SG programs:\nI think it's good. It's like the SMARTgirl too. Because we can\nget [an] understanding of it when we come and there is also a\nlucky draw for prizes. (Rumdoul, 23-year-old woman)\nThere should any lucky draw for small prizes. We should some\nitems like ice bucket ... ice bucket and fan. Before the big prize\nwas bicycle. Like small blankets. We give them prizes. They\nmay feel happy when they win any prize. (Phany, 19-year-old\nwoman)\nIn relation to content of the aftercare program, what some\nwomen dismissed as \"boring,\" others insisted was essential.\nThe divergence of preferences highlighted the necessity for\nbalance between enjoyable and entertaining activities and\nmore educational and evidence-based components of the\nprogram. Based on the input of FESW, the final aftercare\nprogram included the following overarching domains: social\nsupport for reducing stimulant use and related harms, cog-\nnitive-behavioral recovery skills, culturally appropriate\nexperiential group exercises (e.g. role plays), as well as brief\nmeditation and relaxation training (Center for Substance\nAbuse Treatment, 2006). We also included a \"lucky draw\"\nwhereby women draw one ticket from a prize bowl following\neach group session. For each four session aftercare group,\nprize bowls with 110 total tickets for the \"lucky draw\"\ntickets for applause and positive affirmations from the group\n(Carrico et al., submitted).\nConclusion\nOur results informed the development of the protocol for a\ncluster randomized stepped-wedge trial with Cambodian\nFESW who use ATS. Findings also provided key insights\ninto the concerns and preferences of FESW that shaped the\nadaptation of the CCT intervention and the content of the\naftercare program. In particular, our qualitative observations\nidentified the role of poverty and transportation difficulties\nas key barriers to engagement and participation, with the\npotential to impact uptake of the intervention and the feasi-\nbility of the proposed trial.\nWhile the CCT concept had broad appeal, women had\nstrong views regarding the amount of the incentive and pro-\nvided explicit feedback on the \"value\" of their time and living\ncosts. Participants were quick to point out that the maximum\nincentive of USD$84 initially proposed compared extremely\npoorly with most FESW earnings. In response, we modified\nthe protocol to allow for a USD$2 incentive for each negative\nurine screen plus weekly bonuses of USD$8, USD$10, and\nfor a total of USD$120. Our data also identified a need\nfor financial assistance with transport, which was absent in\nthe original trial protocol. In response, we offered women the\nchoice between receiving a USD$2 payment to cover the\ncosts of arranging their own transport or being transported by\nSG Outreach Workers who were reimbursed USD$2.\nFindings also informed pragmatic aspects of the trial such\nas scheduling. We decided to provide women with a choice\nbetween attending for urine screening on Monday,\nWednesday, and Friday or Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday\nat any time between 8a.m. and 5p.m. with no appointment\nnecessary. Direct observation during specimen collection\nwas unacceptable to the majority of women interviewed. In\nresponse, we removed the need for this using a Specimen\nValidity Test on each sample to check for adulteration before\ntesting for ATS. Finally, input from our participants informed\nDixon et al. 7\nthe adaptation of the aftercare program to make it \"fun\" and\nenjoyable for women while including four key components:\n(1) group exercises; (2) recovery skills training; (3) medita-\ntion and relaxation training; and (4) a lucky draw as positive\nreinforcement for attendance.\nImportantly, CIPI is the first trial assessing the impact of\na CCT intervention in reducing drug use and HIV risk to be\nconducted in Asia. In resource-limited settings like\nCambodia, CCT interventions represent a time-limited,\npotentially scalable approach to reducing ATS use and opti-\nmizing HIV/AIDS prevention efforts. The data presented\nhere indicate that CCT interventions are highly acceptable in\nthis setting, where women report widespread occupational\nATS use in order to cope with the conditions of sex work,\nincluding long working hours, multiple clients, and extended\nsexual transactions (Maher et al., 2011). The choice of a CCT\nintervention appears particularly apposite in the Cambodian\ncontext where there are currently limited options for drug\ntreatment. CCT may help FESW to engender lasting changes\nby providing them with a minimum or base income while\nattempting to reduce or abstain from ATS use and, poten-\ntially, by incentivizing them to sustain these changes in the\nlonger term.\nIndeed, the second component of the CIPI project involves\na microfinance intervention for women who are ATS-free.\nMicrofinance programs have been shown to increase wom-\nen's empowerment as well as reduce gender inequality, vio-\nlence, and improve health (Hamad and Fernald, 2012; Kim\nassociation with economic benefits. Women who are ATS-\nfree will be offered the intervention, combining financial lit-\neracy education and referral to a Cambodian microloan\nprogram. By integrating the CCT intervention with a sup-\nportive aftercare program, CIPI aims to assist women to\nachieve clinically meaningful reductions in their ATS use\nthat are necessary to benefit from the subsequent microfi-\nnance intervention. However, becauseATS use assists FESW\nwith seeing more clients, it is possible that our intervention\nmay not adequately offset the lost earnings due to the rela-\ntively modest amount of the cash incentives.\nFurther research is needed to examine whether and how\nbehavioral interventions targeting ATS use can be paired\nwith structural interventions such as microfinance that\naddress poverty as a driver of ATS use and HIV risk in this\npopulation (Gupta et al., 2008). However, as highlighted\nhere, in the short-term, FESW will need to be incentivized at\na level which outweighs the occupational drive to use ATS.\nThis issue--getting the dose or the amount of the incentive\nright--is crucial to the uptake of CCT interventions and the\nsuccess of trials designed to evaluate their impact.\nOur results illustrate the value of formative research\ndesigned to facilitate consultation with potential participants\nin order to provide affected community input into the devel-\nopment of both interventions and trial protocols. The rela-\ntively inexpensive changes implemented as a result of our\nfindings have the potential to increase the acceptability of the\nstudy and the intervention to prospective participants.\nPreliminary data from the trial indicate the intervention is\nfeasible and acceptable to Cambodian FESW who use ATS.\nProcess indicators from the first six provinces in this ongoing\nstepped-wedge cluster randomized trial demonstrate strong\nating CCT and completing a median of 25 of the 36 possible\nurine screening visits. Similarly, 79 of the 84 participants\neligible for aftercare (94%) attended at least one aftercare\ngroup session and 57 (68%) completed three or more group\nsessions (Carrico et al., in press).\nOur results are particularly timely, given the growing\ninterest in strategies to improve the recruitment of partici-\npants to clinical trials (Mapstone et al., 2007) and health\nresearch more broadly (Robinson et al., 2007). Suboptimal\naccrual reduces power to detect significant effects, increases\ncosts, and may result in trial failure. Despite Good Clinical\nPractice (GCP) guidelines which recommend that investiga-\ntors should be able to demonstrate potential for recruiting the\nrequired number of participants within the agreed recruit-\nsponsored by the UK Medical Research Council and the\nHealth Technology Assessment Program achieved their orig-\ninal recruitment target and 55% did not reach a revised target\n(McDonald et al., 2006). Inadequate enrollment thus reduces\nthe power of trials to detect effective interventions and may\ndelay the public health impact of a positive trial (Institute of\nMedicine, 2008). Interventions to improve recruitment to\nclinical trials have been systematically reviewed (Caldwell\net al., 2010), including two Cochrane reviews (Mapstone\nous strategies remain unclear, with most studies examined\nbased on small samples and/or recruitment to hypothetical\net al., 2010), trial accrual is also impacted by the intervention\nunder study as well as the target population.\nWhile the importance of using qualitative research for\ncommunity consultation and pre-trial engagement of target\npopulations has been previously demonstrated in preparatory\nwork for candidate vaginal microbicide trials inAfrica (Shagi\nassessed the acceptability of proposed interventions and\nstudy protocols from the perspective of potential partici-\npants. Formative qualitative research with people who inject\ndrugs conducted as part of a hepatitis C virus vaccine prepar-\nedness study informed the development of study protocols,\nresulting in changes to the amount of participant reimburse-\nment (from AUD$30 to AUD$50), changes in the type of\nreimbursement (from store vouchers to cash), and a decision\nto reduce the amount of blood collected at screening (from\nsix tubes to one). These changes were relatively minor and\nof minimal cost, yet had the potential to increase the accept-\nability of the study to prospective participants and therefore\nmaximize recruitment and retention (Maher et al., 2010;\nhere add to this literature by demonstrating the value of\n8 Methodological Innovations\nformative qualitative research in adapting interventions,\nas well as trial protocols, to make them more acceptable to\npotential participants.\nOur results confirm the value of integrating formative\nqualitative research into the process of clinical trial devel-\nopment. Field trials and large-scale cluster randomized tri-\nals are particularly resource-intensive, and in this context,\nformative qualitative research represents a sound invest-\nment. In settings like Cambodia, where little is known\nabout the acceptability of proposed interventions or indeed\nclinical trial participation itself, formative qualitative\nresearch has the potential to yield even greater benefits.\nAs the results presented here indicate, had the CIPI trial\nproceeded to recruit FESW into a trial where they were\nincentivized USD$1 for a urine screening visit, this may\nhave resulted in sub-optimal recruitment leading to insuf-\nficient power to show an effect of the intervention. Under-\nincentivizing CIPI participants also had the potential to\nresult in sampling bias with only impoverished FESW\nenrolling in the trial, leading to non-generalizable findings\n(Maher and Page, 2015). Formative qualitative research\nclearly has the capacity to identify, from the perspective of\npotential intervention recipients and research participants,\nwhat is appropriate remuneration and why and to reveal\npreviously unconsidered barriers (e.g. lack of transporta-\ntion, directly observed urine screening) and facilitators\n(e.g. \"fun\" content) of participation, with the potential to\nimpact both the acceptability of interventions and their\nimplementation in the trial context.\nThese issues are particularly important, given the growing\ninterest in implementation science or the study of methods\nfor improving the uptake, implementation, and translation of\nresearch findings into routine practice (Padian et al., 2011).\nGiven the historical preference and priority for discovery-\ndriven research over implementation science, qualitative\nresearch is a powerful ally in shifting the focus away from\nthe discovery of \"what\" to elucidating the \"how\" (El-Sadr\nmethods to meaningfully involve affected populations in\nplanning, designing, and developing both interventions and\ntheir implementation and evaluation has the potential to\nincrease trust and acceptability, improve recruitment and\nretention, and provides an effective foundation for engage-\nment in future public health responses.\n"
