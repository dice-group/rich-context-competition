Patients were treated with 2.5 or 5 mg rosuvastatin orally, once daily, to achieve the\ntarget LDL-C level specified in Japanese guidelines. Changes in total cholesterol, HDL-C, TG, LDL-\nC, LDL-C/HDL-C and non-HDL-C at 3 and 6 months were prospectively analysed. Safety was\nevaluated by examining changes in hepatorenal function, glucose metabolism and creatine kinase.\nResults: Out of 49 patients, all lipid parameters other than TG were significantly improved at\n3 and 6 months. At 3 months, 83.3% of patients had achieved the target LDL-C level. Among\nnonlipid parameters, no changes were observed except for estimated glomerular filtration rate,\nwhich was improved by \u00fe 5.2% and \u00fe 9.6% at 3 and 6 months, respectively.\nConclusions: Low-dose rosuvastatin was effective in improving hypo-HDL cholesterolaemia and\nmay have renoprotective effects.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nimr.sagepub.com\n1Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology, Department\nof Internal Medicine, St Marianna University School of\nMedicine Yokohama City Seibu Hospital, Yokohama, Japan\n2Division of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Department of\nInternal Medicine, National Hospital Organization\nYokohama Medical Centre, Yokohama, Japan\n3Division of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Department of\nInternal Medicine, Saiseikai Yokohamashi Tobu Hospital,\nYokohama, Japan\n4Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology, Department\nof Internal Medicine, St Marianna University School of\nMedicine, Kawasaki, Japan\nCorresponding author:\nDr Takuyuki Katabami, Division of Metabolism and\nEndocrinology, St Marianna University School of Medicine\nYokohama City Seibu Hospital, 1197-1 Yasashi-cho, Asahi-\nEmail: t2kataba@marianna-u.ac.jp\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page\n(http://www.uk.sagepub.com/aboutus/openaccess.htm).\n",

Type 2\ndiabetes \u00ad which accounts for the majority\nof diabetes cases and is usually accompa-\nnied by obesity \u00ad is often associated with\ndyslipidaemia, including hypo high-density\nlipoprotein (HDL) cholesterolaemia, hyper\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholestero-\nlaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia.1,2 Many\npatients with type 2 diabetes, therefore, are\nat heightened risk of cardiovascular disease\nbecause of concomitant dyslipidaemia,\nwhich is also associated with insulin resist-\nance. Consequently, these patients require\nactive intervention for correction of dysli-\npidaemia in addition to treatment for\ndiabetes. Specifically, low HDL-cholesterol\n(C) and high LDL-C levels have been\nreported to be independent risk factors\nfor developing cardiovascular disease,3\u00ad5\ntherefore, patients with diabetes and both\nof these risk factors require careful and\nstrict management of LDL-C and HDL-C\nlevels, in addition to adequate control of\nblood glucose.6\nStatins have been reported to improve\nhyper-LDL cholesterolaemia and hypertri-\nglyceridaemia, to increase HDL-C, and to\nreduce the risk for cardiovascular disease in\npatients with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidae-\nmia.7 Meta-analyses using the PubMed and\nLIVALO\u00d5 (pitavastatin) effectiveness and\nsafety (LIVES) Study databases have also\nshown that various statins can increase\nHDL-C.8,9 A statin-induced increase in\nHDL-C is usually accompanied by a\ndecrease in LDL-C and may be primarily\nexplained by a cholesterol ester transfer\nprotein-mediated mechanism.8 In addition,\nthere may be different mechanisms involved\nin the effects of different statins. For exam-\nple, atorvastatin has been shown to increase\nHDL-C in a dose-independent manner,\nwhereas rosuvastatin was more effective in\nincreasing HDL-C at lower doses.8,10\nClinical studies that exclusively include\npatients with diabetes and hypo-HDL cho-\nlesterolaemia may reveal the mechanisms\ninvolved in statin-mediated HDL-C\nincrease, however, no such studies are cur-\nrently reported. There are also currently no\nreports on the differences in clinical charac-\nteristics between patients who respond to\nstatin therapy and those who do not, nor are\nthere studies on the prediction of statin\nresponse.\nThe present study was conducted to\nevaluate the efficacy of rosuvastatin (which\nis a potent hydrophilic statin routinely used\nin Japan, that decreases LDL-C and also\nmarkedly increases HDL-C10) in patients\nwith type 2 diabetes and hypo-HDL choles-\nterolaemia. Treatment with rosuvastatin\naimed to achieve the target LDL-C levels\nspecified in the Japan Atherosclerosis\nSociety guidelines for the diagnosis and\nprevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular\nition, lipid improvement, safety and factors\nthat affected changes in HDL-C at 3 and\n6 months were evaluated.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nPatients diagnosed by an investigator (T.K.,\nM.M., S.K., T.M., M.U., S.T., M.H., T.I.,\nA.O. or Y.T.) as having type 2 diabetes, who\nalso had levels of HDL-C <40 mg/dl and\ntriglyceride (TG) <400 mg/dl, and were\nunder regular treatment at the following\ninstitutes in Yokohama, Japan: St Marianna\nUniversity School of Medicine Yokohama\nCity Seibu Hospital; National Hospital\nOrganization Yokohama Medical Centre;\nSaiseikai Yokohamashi Tobu Hospital; St\nMarianna University School of Medicine,\nwere enrolled into this prospective interven-\ntion study. Regardless of LDL-C value,\npatients with HDL-C <40 mg/dl and TG\n<400 mg/dl who were under treatment with\nlipid-lowering drugs other than rosvastatin\nwere included. Patients with HDL-C\npreviously untreated with lipid-lowering\ndrugs, with LDL-C !120 mg/dl, were also\nincluded. Patients meeting any of the fol-\nlowing criteria were excluded from the\nstudy: familial hypercholesterolaemia; his-\ntory of hypersensitivity to statins; active\nhepatic disease; renal dysfunction; serum\ncreatine kinase (CK) >1000 IU/l; receiving\ncyclosporine therapy; gravidity or potential\ngravidity; evidence or family history of\nhypothyroidism or hereditary muscular dis-\norder (muscular dystrophy, etc.); history of\ndrug-induced muscle disorder; drug misuse\nor alcoholism; patients who, in the opinion\nof the investigator, were not appropriate for\nthe study. Patients who were already receiv-\ning other statin therapies did not undergo\nany washout or transition phase before they\nstarted on rosuvastatin.\nThe study protocol was approved by each\ninstitutional ethical review board (author-\nUniversity School of Medicine Yokohama\nCity Seibu Hospital and St Marianna\nNational Hospital Organization Yokohama\nYokohama City Tobu Hospital). Written\ninformed consent was obtained from each\npatient.\nStudy design and evaluation\nPatients were treated with 2.5 or 5 mg\nrosuvastatin orally, once daily, to achieve\nthe target LDL-C levels of <120 mg/dl for\nprimary prevention category III or <100 mg/\ndl for secondary prevention, in accordance\nwith the Japan Atherosclerosis Society\nguidelines for the diagnosis and prevention\nof atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases in\nparameters were measured immediately\nprior to the start of rosuvastatin treatment.\nChanges in blood lipid parameters (total\ncholesterol, HDL-C and TG), proportion of\npatients who achieved the treatment goal,\nand factors that affected the change in HDL-\nC at 3 and 6 months following the start of\ntreatment with rosuvastatin were analysed.\nIn principle, changes in nonstudy drugs\n(including dose change), or in therapies\nthat may affect lipid parameters, were not\npermitted during the study. Dosage increase\nand/or switching of antidiabetics were per-\nmitted for patients with glycosylated\nhaemoglobin (HbA1c\n) levels >8.0%, if the\nattending physician judged it necessary.\nThe LDL-C level was calculated using the\nFriedewald formula;12 the LDL-C/HDL-C\nratio was calculated by dividing the calcu-\nlated LDL-C level by HDL-C, and the non-\nHDL-C level was calculated by subtracting\nHDL-C from total cholesterol.\nSafety was evaluated by analysing\nchanges in HbA1c\nestimated glomerular fil-\ntration rate (eGFR), aspartate aminotrans-\nferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase\n(ALT), g-glutamyl transferase (g-GT), CK\nand blood urea nitrogen (BUN). HbA1c\nlevels were expressed in units specified\nby the National Glycohemoglobin\nStandardization Program (NGSP),13 which\nis the international standard (see below).\nMeasurement\nBlood samples (10 ml) were taken from the\nan overnight fast. Samples were immediately\ntemperature, and analysed in each hos-\npital by Mitsubishi Kagaku Bio-Clinical\nLaboratories, Inc., Tokyo, Japan. TG,\ntotal cholesterol and HDL-C were measured\nenzymatically using Determiner L TG II\n(Kyowa Medex, Tokyo, Japan), Dia Auto\nT-Cho (Dia Reagents, Tokyo, Japan) and\nCholestest HDL (Daiichi Pure Chemicals,\nTokyo, Japan), respectively, by means of an\nautoanalyser (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan)\naccording to the manufacturers' instruc-\ntions. LDL-C was estimated using the\nFriedewald formula (LDL-C \u00bc total\ncholesterol\u00c0HDL-C\u00c0TG \u00c2 0.2) unless the\nFor patients with current TG levels\n>400 mg/dl, LDL-C was measured using\nthe N-geneous assay (Daiichi Pure\nChemicals) according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions.\nBlood glucose was measured using Sica\nLiquid Glu (Kanto Kagaku, Tokyo, Japan)\naccording to the manufacturer's instruc-\ntions. HbA1c\nwas determined by a latex\ncohesion method (Determiner HbA1c\n,\nKyowa Medex, Tokyo, Japan), calibrated\nagainst a Japanese Clinical Laboratory Use\nCertified Reference Material (JCCRM), and\ndesignated as HbA1c\n(Japanese Diabetes\nSociety [JDS]). HbA1c\n(NGSP) was calcu-\nlated from HbA1c\nusing the formula:\nEstimated GFR was calculated from\nserum creatinine (Cr) concentration using\nthe revised equation: eGFR (ml/\nCr and BUN were determined using enzyme\nimmunoassays (Iatro-LQ AST, ALT, g-GT,\nCK Rate, CRE and UN Rate; Mitsubishi\nKagaku Bio-Clinical Laboratories). Patients\nwere assessed for chronic kidney disease\nusing the definitions and staging system\nprovided in the Japanese Clinical Practice\nGuidebook for Diagnosis and Treatment of\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as mean \u00c6 SD. Paired\nt-test was used to compare numerical data\nbefore and after treatment with rosuvastatin\nwithin the patient group; McNemar's test\nwas used to compare the proportion of\npatients who achieved the target LDL-C\nlevel before and after treatment with rosu-\nvastatin. Pearson's correlation coefficient\nand stepwise multiple regression analysis\nwere performed to determine factors con-\ntributing to the change in HDL-C. Pearson's\ncorrelation coefficient was also used to ana-\nlyse factors contributing to the change in\neGFR. Statistical analyses were performed\nusing JMP\u00d5 software, version 7.0.2 for\nWindows\u00d5 (SAS Institute, Japan).

No such correlation was observed\nat 6 months.\nDiscussion\nThis is the first report describing a prospect-\nive intervention study in which the effects of\na potent statin were studied exclusively in\npatients with type 2 diabetes, concomitant\nhypo-HDL-cholesterolaemia and hyper-\nLDL-cholesterolaemia. In the present\nstudy, the mean initial dose of rosuvastatin\ntreatment aimed to achieve target LDL-C\nlevels. Despite these low doses, improve-\nments in HDL-C levels were observed at 3\nLDL-C levels are considered to be con-\ntrolled under 70 mg/dl, however, patients\nwith lower HDL-C levels have a higher risk\nof coronary artery disease than those with\nhigher HDL-C levels.16 Intensive LDC-C-\nlowering therapy with rosuvastatin has been\nshown to result in significant regression of\ncoronary plaque volume in patients with\nstable coronary artery disease.17 In that\nsame study, there was a significant, but\nweak, correlation between the percentage\nchange in total atheroma volume and HDL-\nC, as well as in the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio.17\nThese results indicate that lowering LDL-C\nand elevating HDL-C might be beneficial to\nprevent cardiovascular disease events.\nData in the present study suggest that\nrosuvastatin may increase HDL-C in\npatients with diabetes who are more likely\nto develop hypo-HDL cholesterolaemia.\nOther reports have shown that rosuvastatin\ncan increase HDL-C and decrease LDL-C in\na dose-dependent manner,18,19 suggesting\nthat it may be more effective at higher\ndoses than at the low dose used in the\npresent study. A high LDL-C/HDL-C ratio\nhas been reported as a risk factor for\ncardiovascular events20 and therefore\nrequires appropriate control. In the present\nstudy the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio decreased by\nbut was not well controlled (mean ratios,\nfurther rosuvastatin dose increase would be\nnecessary to prevent cardiovascular events.\nPotential factors that may affect the\nHDL-C-increasing effect of rosuvastatin in\npatients with type 2 diabetes were examined.\nHDL-C at 3 months was negatively corre-\nlated with baseline TG, suggesting that\nstatins may increase HDL-C less effectively\nin patients with higher TG. It has long been\nknown that patients with type 2 diabetes\nFigure 1. Achievement rate for low-density lipo-\nprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target levels set by the\nJapan Atherosclerosis Society guidelines for the\ndiagnosis and prevention of atherosclerotic cardio-\npatients with type 2 diabetes and hypo high-density\nlipoprotein cholesterolaemia (n \u00bc 49). Achievement\nrate significantly increased from a baseline level of\nmonths (*P < 0.01 versus baseline; McNemar's test).\nhave hypertriglyceridaemia and hypo-HDL\ncholesterolaemia concurrently. In the pre-\nsent study, patients with TG <400 mg/dl\nwere enrolled, with a primary aim of\nimproving LDL-C levels. The relationship\nbetween TG and HDL-C in lipid metabol-\nism, and the fact that hypo-HDL cholester-\nolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia are\nindependent risk factors for cardiovascular\nevents, support the importance of active TG\ncontrol.\nMultiple regression analysis in the pre-\nsent study suggested that the increase in\nHDL-C, in response to treatment with\nrosuvastatin, was smaller in patients with\nhigher TG, higher HbA1c\nand older age at\nbaseline, compared with other patients.\nInsulin resistance in patients with type 2\ndiabetes is known to reduce the effect of\ninsulin, which results in a decrease in lipo-\nprotein lipase activity and an increase in\nvery-low-density lipoprotein synthesis, des-\npite high blood insulin concentrations.21\nThese mechanisms may contribute to a\nless-marked increase in HDL-C in patients\nwho have a higher HbA1c\nor poor glycaemic\ncontrol at baseline.\nIn the present study, TG was shown to\nhave a statistically significant correlation\nwith HDL-C at 3 months in both simple\ncorrelation analysis and multiple regression\nanalysis; however, no such correlation was\nshown at 6 months. This may be in part\nbecause fewer patients were followed up at 6\npatients, respectively). It may be necessary,\nnonetheless, to control HDL-C by selecting\nand adjusting dietary therapy, exercise\ntherapy and pharmacotherapy (including\nstatins) for individuals with the above-\nmentioned risk factors (increased age, high\nTG levels and high HbA1c\nlevels).\nNephropathy is one of the most import-\nant complications of diabetes.22 The previ-\nously reported renoprotective effects of\nrosuvastatin23,24 were supported in the pre-\nsent study by the improvements in eGFR\nobserved at both 3 and 6 months, despite\ninclusion of fewer patients at the 6 month\nfollow-up. Since patients with type 2\ndiabetes often have hypo-HDL cholestero-\nlaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia concur-\nrently, many patients have high LDL-C/\nHDL-C ratios despite having not very high\ntotal cholesterol levels. It is noteworthy that\nlow-dose rosuvastatin not only improved\nthe lipid parameters, but also improved\neGFR in these patients, who are at height-\nented risk of cardiovascular events. To\nfurther examine this renoprotective effect,\nadditional analyses were performed in an\nattempt to identify a factor or factors that\nmay have contributed to the improvement of\neGFR in response to treatment with rosu-\nvastatin. A significant negative correlation\nwas demonstrated between the change in\neGFR and the change in LDL-C at 6\nare known to have lipid metabolism, anti-\ninflammatory and antioxidant effects,25 the\nsignificant negative correlation observed in\nthe present study may be due to the pleio-\ntropic effects of rosuvastatin, based on these\nmechanisms. In the present study, urine\nprotein levels were not measured in all\npatients, therefore further studies are\nrequired to verify the renoprotective effect\nof rosuvastatin in patients with type 2\ndiabetes and hypo high-density lipoprotein\ncholesterolaemia.\nWhile rosuvastatin had no effect on glu-\ncose metabolism parameters (such as fasting\nblood glucose or HbA1c\n) in the present\nstudy, large-scale meta-analyses have\nreported that the use of statins induced\ndiabetes, although infrequently, and were\nassociated with an increased number of new\ncases.26,27 It was concluded, however, that\nconventional statin therapy should not be\nchanged, because the benefits for prevention\nof cardiovascular events overweigh the glu-\ncose metabolism-related risks.26,27 In Japan,\nno conclusion has been drawn regarding the\neffect of statins on glucose metabolism in the\nwas not sig-\nnificantly affected after long-term (6-month)\ntreatment with rosuvastatin in the present\nstudy. Given the benefits of statins for\nprevention of cardiovascular events, it may\nbe crucial to continue statin therapy in\npatients with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidae-\nmia, while monitoring glucose metabolism-\nrelated parameters, including HbA1c\n.\nAlthough all statins (including rosuvastatin)\nmay induce various side-effects,30 no adverse\neffects were observed following rosuvastatin\ntherapy, throughout the study period, in the\npresent analysis.\nThe results of the present study may be\nlimited by the fact that there is no alternative\nstudy arm for comparison. In addition, the\nperiod of the study was relatively short at\n6 months and the patient numbers were\nrelatively low, especially at the 6-month\ntimepoint.\nIn conclusion, this small-scale 6-month\nstudy showed that low-dose rosuvastatin\nmarkedly decreased LDL-C and improved\nwith type 2 diabetes and hypo high-density\nlipoprotein cholesterolaemia. Rosuvastatin\ntreatment appeared to be useful in improv-\ning hypo-HDL cholesterolaemia, in add-\nition to other lipid parameters, in these\npatients. Although the effects of statins on\nglucose metabolism are yet to be established\nin Japan,28,29 low-dose rosuvastatin \u00ad a\nhydrophilic statin \u00ad had no effect on glucose\nmetabolism in the present study. In add-\nition, low-dose rosuvastatin improved\neGFR, a measure of renal function.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\n"
