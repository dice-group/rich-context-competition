Chronic diseases have a tendency to occur simultaneously and where there are two or more such\nconditions, this is termed as `multimorbidity'. Multimorbidity is associated with adverse health outcomes, but\nlimited research has been undertaken in LMICs. Therefore, this study examines the prevalence and correlates of\nmultimorbidity as well as the associations between multimorbidity and self-rated health, activities of daily living\n(ADLs), quality of life, and depression across six LMICs.\nMethods: Data was obtained from the WHO's Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) Wave-1 (2007/10). This\nwas a cross-sectional population based survey performed in LMICs, namely China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, and\nSouth Africa, including 42,236 adults aged 18 years and older. Multimorbidity was measured as the simultaneous\npresence of two or more of eight chronic conditions including angina pectoris, arthritis, asthma, chronic lung disease,\ndiabetes mellitus, hypertension, stroke, and vision impairment. Associations with four health outcomes were examined,\nnamely ADL limitation, self-rated health, depression, and a quality of life index. Random-intercept multilevel regression\nmodels were used on pooled data from the six countries.\nResults: The prevalence of morbidity and multimorbidity was 54.2 % and 21.9 %, respectively, in the pooled sample of\nsix countries. Russia had the highest prevalence of multimorbidity (34.7 %) whereas China had the lowest (20.3 %). The\nlikelihood of multimorbidity was higher in older age groups and was lower in those with higher socioeconomic status.\nIn the pooled sample, the prevalence of 1+ ADL limitation was 14 %, depression 5.7 %, self-rated poor health 11.6 %,\nand mean quality of life score was 54.4. Substantial cross-country variations were seen in the four health outcome\nmeasures. The prevalence of 1+ ADL limitation, poor self-rated health, and depression increased whereas quality of life\ndeclined markedly with an increase in number of diseases.\nConclusions: Findings highlight the challenge of multimorbidity in LMICs, particularly among the lower\nsocioeconomic groups, and the pressing need for reorientation of health care resources considering the distribution of\nmultimorbidity and its adverse effect on health outcomes.\n",

This is causing changes in the\ndisease burden profiles of LMICs, with chronic non-\ncommunicable diseases (NCDs) becoming more com-\nmon and growing public health challenge [2\u00ad5]. As a\nresult of increasing longevity, multiple comorbid condi-\ntions, commonly referred to as `multimorbidity', have\nalso become progressively more common among older\nadults [6\u00ad8]. Evidence from both high- and low-income\ncountries indicates that older adults are at much higher\nrisk for multiple chronic diseases [9\u00ad14]. At the same\ntime, several recent studies have provided evidence that\nyounger adults also have substantial prevalence of\nSocioeconomic status (SES) has been found to be\nstrongly associated with the prevalence of multimorbidity,\nregardless of whether SES is measured through education\ndeprivation [24]. In a review of 26 studies on multimor-\nbidity focused on East-Mediterranean countries, Boutayab\net al. [25] show that low income, low level of education,\nand unemployment are associated with higher prevalence\nof multimorbidity.\nMultimorbidity has been associated with adverse health\noutcomes, such as reduced physical function [26, 27], poor\nquality of life [28], poor self-rated health (SRH) [29, 30],\nincreased use of inpatient and ambulatory care [13, 31],\nand mortality [10]. More than two decades ago, Verbrugge\net al. [32] demonstrated the exponential increase in dis-\nability with increasing numbers of chronic diseases. Multi-\nmorbidity also raises the complexities of clinical treatment\nand patient management, and is consequently associated\nwith higher medical care costs owing to the need for long-\nterm care [17, 33]. The adverse impact of multimorbidity\non other health domains is further exacerbated by socio-\neconomic deprivation and poorly prepared medical care\nStudies investigating the prevalence and determinants\nof multimorbidity have primarily focused on high-\nincome countries (HICs). Multimorbidity studies in\nLMICs are limited in geographical scope, the number of\ndiseases studied and the effects of multimorbidity (abso-\nlute number of diseases or disease combinations) on\nhealth outcomes such as physical functioning, quality of\nexisting studies on multimorbidity prevalence from\nLMICs, Khanam et al. [12] estimated the prevalence of\nmultimorbidity to be 53.8 % among the older adult\npopulation of Bangladesh. Alaba and Chola [22] ana-\nlyzed the adult (aged 18+) population of South Africa\nand reported 4 % to have multimorbidity, with over 70\n% of these adults being women. The large and growing\nburden of NCDs in LMICs, particularly when coupled\nwith limitations in resources and competing public\nhealth priorities points, to the need to understand the\nIn the present study, data from the World Health\nOrganization's multi-country Study on global AGEing\nand adult health (WHO SAGE) Wave 1 was used to in-\nvestigate two main objectives: 1) to explore the preva-\nlence and SES correlates of multimorbidity in adults,\nand 2) to examine the associations between multimor-\nbidity and four main health outcomes: self-rated overall\ngeneral health, depression, physical functioning, and\nsubjective well-being.\nHypotheses\nThis study aims to test the following hypotheses:\n1) LMICs will exhibit a negative association between\nhigher SES and multimorbidity, similar to the evidence\nfrom HICs and some developing countries, and 2) mul-\ntimorbidity will have positive associations with other\nhealth-related outcomes, namely lower SRH, depres-\nsion, limitation in activities of daily living (ADLs), and\npoorer quality of life.\nData sources\nSAGE is a longitudinal ageing and health study with\nnationally representative samples of adults from six\ncountries: China, Ghana, India, Mexico, the Russian\nFederation, and South Africa. These countries are at dif-\nferent stages of the demographic and epidemiological\ntransitions but are (with the exception of Russia) experien-\ncing a rapid rise in the older adult population [41]. SAGE\nis designed as a multi-wave panel study representative of\nthe population aged 50 and older, with a smaller cohort of\nrespondents aged 18\u00ad49 for comparative purposes. All\nsampling plans use multistage clustered design samples\ndrawn from an updated frame. Each household and indi-\nvidual is assigned a known non-zero probability of being\nselected [42]. Household and individual weights were\npost-stratified to weight up to population distributions by\nage and sex in each country. Detailed description of study\nand sample design is provided elsewhere [42, 43].\nMethods\nChronic conditions and multimorbidity\nMultimorbidity is defined as the simultaneous presence of\ntwo or more chronic physical health conditions. For this\nanalysis, eight chronic health conditions were included,\nnamely angina pectoris, arthritis, asthma, chronic lung\ndisease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stroke, and low\nvisual acuity.\nOf these eight conditions, diabetes mellitus and stroke\nwere assessed through a question about ever being\ndiagnosed with the disease by a health professional. The\nspecific question was, \"Have you ever been told by a\nhealth professional/doctor that you have (disease name)?\"\nThe prevalence of angina pectoris, arthritis, asthma, and\nchronic lung disease was derived from a set of symptom-\nbased questions, combined with a diagnostic algorithm.\nThe symptomatic questions and algorithm for each of the\ndiseases are presented in the supplementary material\n(Additional file 1). Additionally, the use of treatment/\nmedication received in the 12 months prior to interview\nwas indicative of a diagnosis and was included in preva-\nlence estimates for each disease. Prevalence of angina,\narthritis, and asthma was based on symptom-reporting\nand diagnostic algorithm, adjusted for treatment/medica-\ntion received in the 12 months prior to interview.\nThe assessment of hypertension and visual acuity was\nbased on direct physical examination undertaken at the\ntime of interview. The prevalence of hypertension was\nbased on measured blood pressure (systolic and dia-\nstolic) taken with the respondent in a seated position.\nAn average of the second and third of three total read-\nings was used as the outcome. In accordance with\nWHO/ISH guidelines for the management of hyperten-\nsion [44], the limit for high systolic blood pressure was\n140 mm/hg or above, and for diastolic blood pressure 90\nmm/hg or above. An individual was considered to be\nhypertensive if average systolic or diastolic blood pres-\nsure readings exceeded either of these thresholds or they\nreported current treatment for hypertension.\nVisual acuity was measured for both near and distance\nvision in each eye using a tumbling \"E\" logMAR chart\n[45]. Measured near and distance visual acuity was classi-\nfied into normal vision (0.32\u00ad1.6 decimal) and low vision\nlow vision if they had either low near or distance vision in\nboth eyes.\nHealth outcomes\nSelf-rated health (SRH)\nThe specific question used to assess overall general SRH\nwas, \"In general, how would you rate your health today?\"\nA five-point response scale was used: very good, good,\nmoderate, bad, and very bad. For this analysis, bad and\nvery bad health responses were combined as `poor\nhealth' and remaining categories combined into `good\nhealth' to generate a dichotomous health variable. Poor\nSRH is the outcome used in the analysis.\nPhysical functioning: activities of daily living (ADL)\nLimitation in ADL was used to assess physical function-\ning. The questions were based on self- reported difficulty\nin engaging in activities during the last 30 days, using a\nfive-point response scale ranging from none to extreme\ndifficulty. The ADL measure included in SAGE was\nbased on WHODAS 2.0 and has been validated in LMICs\nby WHO and collaborating agencies [47]. WHODAS 2.0\nis validated cross-culturally through a systematic research\nstudy. The cross-cultural applicability research study used\nvarious qualitative methods to explore the nature and\npractice of health status assessment in different cultures.\nThe study included linguistic analysis of health-related ter-\nminology, key informant interviews, focus groups, and\nquasi-quantitative methods such as pile sorting and con-\ncept mapping (carried out in tandem). Information was\ngathered on the conceptualization of disability and on im-\nportant areas of day-to-day functioning.\nIn this study, severe and extreme difficulties were\ncombined to represent limitation in a particular activity.\nWe have used an extended set of ADL that included sit-\nting for long periods, walking 100 m, standing up, stand-\ning for long periods, climbing one flight of stairs,\nstooping/kneeling/crouching, picking up things with fin-\ngers, extending arms above shoulders, concentrating for\n10 min, walking a long distance (1 km), bathing, getting\ndressed, carrying things, moving around inside home,\ngetting up from lying down, and getting to and using the\ntoilet. For the analysis, a dichotomous variable was cre-\nated, which took value 1 if the respondent noted a limi-\ntation in one or more of the above ADLs (1+ ADL) and\n0 otherwise.\nQuality of life\nThe 8-item WHO Quality of Life (WHOQoL) instru-\nment was used to quantify quality of life and included\ntwo questions in each of four broad domains: physical,\npsychological, social, and environmental [48]. Quality of\nlife was assessed by asking respondents to rate their sat-\nisfaction with different domains of their lives, such as\nwith money, health, and relationships, as well as rating\ntheir overall life satisfaction, using a five-point response\nscale, ranging from very satisfied to very dissatisfied. A\ncomposite score was created by summing the responses\nacross the different questions and rescaling the result\nfrom 0\u00ad100 where a higher score indicated better quality\nof life.\nMental health\nDepression was used as a measure of mental health. De-\npression was assessed through a set of symptomatic\nquestions based on the World Mental Health Survey\nversion of the Composite International Diagnostic Inter-\nview [49]. Diagnosis of major depressive episode was de-\nrived from an algorithm that accounted for reporting\nsymptoms of depression during the past 12 months [50].\nThe detailed symptomatic questions and algorithm are\nprovided in the supplementary material (Additional file 1).\nPrevalence was based on the result of the diagnostic algo-\nrithm, adjusting for treatment received.\nIndicators of socioeconomic status and control variables\nYears of schooling and household wealth quintile were\nused to represent SES. For analytical convenience, the\nhighest number of years of education completed was\ngrouped into four categories: no formal schooling, 1\u00ad5\nyears, 6\u00ad9 years, and 10 or more years of schooling. In\naddition to education, household wealth was used as an\nalternate measure of SES. A wealth index was derived\nfrom the household ownership of durable goods, dwell-\ning characteristics (type of floors, walls and cooking\nstove), and access to services such as improved water,\nsanitation, and cooking fuel. The detailed list of items is\ngiven in the supplementary material (Additional file 1).\nThe results were recoded into dichotomous variables\ntaking the value of 0 if the household did not possess or\nhave access to the good or service, and 1 if it did. A pure\nrandom effect model was used to estimate assets per\nhousehold, then an `asset ladder' was generated for each\ncountry [51]. Using a Bayesian post-estimation (empir-\nical Bayes) method, households were arranged on the\nasset ladder, where the raw continuous income estimates\nwere transformed in the final step into quintiles.\nTwo sets of control variables, demographic factors and\nhealth risk factors, were included in this study. The\nwomen), and marital status (currently married/cohabiting\nor all other). The health risk variables consisted of tobacco\nuse [current users (daily or non-daily) or non-user]; alco-\nhol consumption [current user (consumed 1\u00ad4 days/week\nin the last 12 months) or non-user]; physical activity (ac-\nminutes of moderate activity per week] or otherwise in-\nactive); high risk waist-to-hip ratio (cutoff point: 0.90 for\nmen and 0.85 for women); and obesity classification\nStatistical methods\nA two-stage statistical analysis was undertaken; first, the\ncorrelates of any morbidity and multimorbidity (2+\nchronic diseases) were examined using a multinomial\nlogit model. Second, the association between multimor-\nbidity and the four primary health outcomes were exam-\nined: 1+ ADL, presence of depression, poor SRH, and\nlow WHOQoL score. Of the four health outcomes, three\nwere binary variables, 1+ ADL limitation, depression,\nand poor SRH; therefore, logit models were used to\nexamine the association of morbidity with these indica-\ntors. Linear regression was used to investigate associa-\ntions with the WHOQoL index. All regressions were run\non the pooled data from the six countries and therefore\nestimated in a multilevel framework. Random intercept\nmultilevel (three-level) models were used, where country\nwas the highest level, state/province of residence the\nsecond level, and individuals the first level. All analyses\nwere carried out in STATA 12.0. The estimates were\nconsidered significant if P <0.10.\nEthical approval\nSAGE was approved by the World Health Organization's\nEthical Review Committee. Additionally, partner organi-\nzations in each country implementing SAGE obtained\nethical clearance through their respective institutional\nreview bodies.\nInformed consent\nWritten informed consent was obtained from all study\nparticipants.\nResults\nSample characteristics\nSAGE Wave 1 in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia,\nand South Africa. Table 1 presents the percentage distri-\nbution of socioeconomic and demographic characteris-\ntics of the study population from each country. Among\nthe countries, the Russian Federation had the highest\npercentage of population aged 70 years and above (12.5\n%) compared to less than 10 % for the other countries.\nThe proportion living in rural areas ranged from 19 % in\nRussia to 75 % in India. The percentage of population with\nno formal schooling was highest in India (36.2 %) followed\nby Ghana (32.7 %) and lowest for Russia (0.3 %). The per-\ncentage of population with 10+ years of schooling was\nhighest in Russia (87 %) compared to less than 30 % for\nPrevalence of multimorbidity and the primary health\noutcome measures\nTable 2 shows the prevalence of having any single chronic\ndisease, multimorbidity (2+ chronic diseases), 1+ ADL\nlimitation, depression, poor SRH, and low mean WHO-\nQoL index based on the pooled sample of the six SAGE\ncountries. Overall, the prevalence of morbidity \u00ad de-\nfined as the presence of at least one of the eight chronic\ndiseases \u00ad was 54.2 %. The prevalence of having at least\none chronic disease was highest in South Africa (69.4 %)\nThe overall prevalence of multimorbidity was 21.9 %.\nAmong the six countries, Russia had the highest preva-\nlence of multimorbidity (34.7 %) and the lowest was ob-\nserved in China (20.3 %); the remaining four countries had\na multimorbidity prevalence of approximately 22 %.\nThe prevalence of any single condition and of multi-\nmorbidity increased with each progressively older age\ngroup; 87 % of the population in the oldest age group\n(70+) had at least one chronic disease and 60.7 % had\nmultimorbidity. Similarly, the prevalence of single mor-\nbidity and multimorbidity was consistently higher in\nthose with lower levels of education and wealth, and\nlower in those with higher education and wealth\n(Table 2). For example, prevalence of multimorbidity\nadults with no formal schooling compared to 16.0 % and\nschooling.\nOverall, 14 % of respondents had 1+ ADL limitation,\n5.7 % had depression, 11.6 % reported poor SRH, and\nthe mean WHOQoL score was 54.4 (on the scale of 0 to\n100). Poorer health outcomes were generally more\nprevalent at older ages, in women, in rural dwellers, at\nlower SES, and with larger numbers of comorbid condi-\ntions. While considerable cross-country variations were\nobserved in the prevalence of 1+ ADL, depression, poor\nSRH, and low mean WHOQoL scores, the overall pat-\nterns were consistent.\nTable 2 also shows the prevalence of the four health out-\ncomes among adults with different numbers of chronic\nconditions. With increasing numbers of chronic condi-\ntions, each of the four health outcome measures became\nworse. For instance, the percentage of adults with 1+ ADL\nincreased eight-fold (from 7.1 % to 58.7 %), depression\nprevalence increased by nine-fold (3.2 % to 27 %), poor\nSRH increased six-fold (from 5.8 % to 50 %), and the mean\nno chronic diseases compared to those with four or more\nconditions, respectively.\nAssociations between SES and multimorbidity\nBoth measures of SES were negatively associated with\n1+ ADL, depression, and poor SRH, while positively\nTable 1 Percent distribution of selected socio-demographic characteristics, by country and for the pooled sample, WHO SAGE\nChina Ghana India Mexico Russia South Africa All countries, total (pooled) Men (pooled) Women (pooled)\nAge Group\nSex\nResidence\nMarital status\nYears of schooling\nWealth quintile\nResults are weighted using pooled sampling weights\nassociated with WHOQoL score (Table 2). For ex-\nample, 33.6 % of respondents with no formal education\nhad 1+ ADL compared to 6.3 % in those with 10+ years\nof schooling. The prevalence of depression was 12 % in\nthe no formal schooling group versus 3.7 % in 10+\nyears schooling group, while poor SRH was 18.6 % in\nthe no formal schooling group versus 5.2 % in the 10+\nyears of schooling group. Mean WHOQoL index score\nwas worse (51.0) for respondents with no formal\nschooling compared to 57.5 for those with 10+ years of\nschooling. A similar pattern was observed for house-\nhold wealth quintiles.\nTable 2 Prevalence of any morbidity, multimorbidity, and four health outcome measures by background characteristics, WHO-SAGE\nBackground variables Any morbidity,\nMultimorbidity,\nDepression,\nPoor self-rated health,\nAge group\nSex\nResidence\nYears of schooling\nWealth quintile\nCountry\nNumber of diseases\nPercentage estimates are weighted by the pooled country weight. Higher WHOQoL score indicates better quality of life (on a scale of 0 to 100)\nFigure 1 presents the prevalence of multimorbidity by\nyears of schooling completed and household wealth\nquintiles, and by country. Years of schooling completed\nshowed a pronounced negative association with the\nprevalence of multimorbidity for all countries, with the\nlargest differences observed in Mexico and Russia. Small\ndifferences were seen in the prevalence of multimorbid-\nity across wealth quintiles in all countries except Russia.\nCorrelates of chronic disease and multimorbidity\nTable 3 presents the estimates of multilevel multinomial\nlogistic regression models used to examine the associ-\nation of socioeconomic, demographic, and health risk\nfactors with multimorbidity. The dependent variable had\nthree categories: no disease, one disease, and 2+ diseases\n(multimorbidity). The `no disease' category was consid-\nered as the reference group in the multinomial logit re-\ngression model. Table 3 shows that the relative risks of\nboth one disease and multimorbidity (2+ diseases) in-\ncreased at each higher age group compared to no disease.\nFor example, compared to the 18\u00ad49 age group, adults in\nthe 70+ age group were four times (RRR = 4.04) more\nlikely to have one disease, and almost 18 times (RRR =\n17.9) more likely to have multimorbidity relative to no\ndisease. Compared with men, women were significantly\nmore likely (RRR = 1.26) to have multimorbidity than no\ndisease. Adults living in rural areas were less likely than\nurban dwellers (RRR = 0.95) to have multimorbidity rela-\ntive to no disease. Measures of SES, based on years of\nschooling and wealth quintiles, were negatively associated\nwith both multimorbidity and having one disease. Further-\nmore, all health risk factors, except tobacco consumption,\nwere significantly associated with higher prevalence of\nboth one disease and multimorbidity.\nADL limitations, poor self-rated health (SRH), depression,\nand quality of life by number of diseases\nFigure 2 shows the patterns of the four health outcomes,\nby number of chronic conditions and country. Across all\nfigures, there is a consistent pattern of poor health out-\ncomes with an increasing number of chronic conditions.\nThere is, however, variation by country and domains.\nThe ADL limitations increased sharply and consistently\nacross all six countries with increasing number of dis-\neases; the largest increase was observed in India and the\nlowest in South Africa. Compared to adults with one or\ntwo chronic diseases, the level of depression was sub-\nstantially higher among adults with three or more\nchronic diseases. WHOQoL declined steadily (quality of\nlife worsened) and prevalence of poor SRH increased\nwith the number of conditions for all six countries.\nAssociation of multimorbidity with the four health\noutcome measures\nThe effects of multimorbidity on ADL, depression, SRH,\nand WHOQoL are presented in Table 4. The table\nshows both adjusted (for control variables) and un-\nadjusted estimates for each of the health outcomes. The\ncount of chronic diseases has a statistically significant\nnegative effect on all four health outcomes. Each health\noutcome showed poorer results as the number of\nchronic diseases increased. For ADL limitations, depres-\nsion and poor SRH, the adjusted and unadjusted odds\nwere similar. Those with three chronic diseases were\nmore than four times as likely to have 1+ ADL, depres-\nsion, and poor SRH as adults with no diseases. Com-\npared with adults with no disease, those with four or\nmore diseases were almost seven times more likely to\npoor SRH (OR = 7.38). The WHOQoL index was an\naverage of eight points lower (adjusted  = -8.93) for\nadults with three chronic diseases compared to adults\nwith no diseases.\nTable 5 presents the regression analyses for the associ-\nation of individual diseases and disease pairs on each of\nthe subjective health outcomes. In Table 5, the results of\nModel 1 show the effects of individual chronic diseases\non subjective health outcomes, after adjusting for the ef-\nfects of other diseases and the control variables. Model 2\npresents the main effects as well as the interactions of\nthe chronic disease pairs. Results from Model 1 show\nthat all diseases, except hypertension, had statistically\nPrevalecne(%)\nYears of schooling\nChina\nGhana\nIndia\nMexico\nRussia\nSouth Africa\nWealth Quintiles\nChina\nGhana\nIndia\nMexico\nRussia\nSouth Africa\nFig. 1 Prevalence of multimorbidity, by socioeconomic status measures and country, WHO SAGE Wave 1 (2007/10)\nsignificant negative effects on the subjective health out-\ncomes. For example, adults with arthritis were more\nthan two times as likely to have 1+ ADL and depression,\nand 1.8 times more likely to report poor SRH. The effect\non WHOQoL was also negative; the mean score was\nthree points lower among adults with arthritis. The\nother chronic diseases, including angina, lung diseases,\nlow vision, diabetes, and stroke showed similar negative\neffects on subjective health outcomes.\nResults of Model 2 reveal that the main effects on the\ndifferent subjective health outcomes for all the condi-\ntions except hypertension were significant and negative.\nSubjective health measures were worse for adults with\nchronic diseases. The `main effects' indicate the effect of\neach disease on a person suffering from none of the\nother conditions. The interaction estimates for the pairs\nof diseases showed a mixed pattern. While only a few of\nthe interactions were significant, some of the disease\npair interaction terms were positive, and some were\nnegative. A positive interaction (odds ratio greater than\none in logit models of 1+ ADL, depression, and poor\nSRH and negative coefficients in linear regressions for\nWHOQoL) shows that the combined effect of two dis-\neases was more than the additive effect of each one of\nthem individually; while a negative interaction (odds ra-\ntio less than one in logit models of 1+ ADL, depression,\nand poor SRH and positive coefficients in linear regres-\nsions for WHOQoL) indicates that the effect of the two\ndiseases was less than the additive effect of each of them\nindividually. The positive interactions show synergistic\neffects of the pair of diseases and the negative interac-\ntions show antagonistic effects.\nRegression results for 1+ ADL showed that the inter-\nactions of nine disease pairs were statistically significant:\nhypertension-angina, hypertension-diabetes, arthritis-\nangina, arthritis-lung diseases, arthritis-asthma, arthritis-\nTable 3 Multilevel multinomial logit model estimates\nexamining the correlates of multimorbidity\nVariable One disease versus\nno disease (95 % CI)\nMultimorbidity versus\nno disease (95 % CI)\nAge\nSex\nMale R\nResidence\nUrban R\nMarital status\nNever married R\nCurrently\nmarried/cohabiting\nYears of schooling\nNo formal schooling R\nWealth quintile\nLowest R\nWaist-hip ratio\nLow risk R\nBody mass index\nNot obese R\nPhysical activity\nActive R\nDaily tobacco\nconsumption\nNo R\nAlcohol consumption\nNo R\nTable 3 Multilevel multinomial logit model estimates\nexamining the correlates of multimorbidity (Continued)\nRandom part\nCountry level variance\nCovariance\nProvince level variance\nCovariance\nthrough MCMC algorithm available in MLWin\nlow vision, angina-chronic lung diseases, angina-\nasthma, and low vision-diabetes. Of these nine, the\nhypertension-diabetes was synergistic. For depression,\nthe interactions of six disease pairs were statistically sig-\nnificant: hypertension-angina, arthritis-angina, arthritis-\nchronic lung diseases, angina-diabetes, chronic lung\ndiseases-asthma, and low vision-diabetes; but no syner-\ngistic interactions emerged. For poor SRH, interactions\nwith nine disease pairs were statistically significant:\nhypertension-asthma, arthritis-angina, arthritis-lung dis-\neases, arthritis-asthma, angina-chronic lung disease,\nangina-low vision, chronic lung diseases-diabetes, asthma-\ndiabetes, and low vision-diabetes. Of these significant\ninteractions, only the hypertension-asthma pairing was\nsynergistically associated with poor SRH. Similarly, for\nWHOQoL, interactions with seven disease pairs were sig-\nnificant: hypertension-asthma, arthritis-angina, arthritis-\nchronic lung disease, arthritis-asthma, arthritis-diabetes,\nangina-chronic lung diseases, and low vision-diabetes. The\npairing of hypertension-asthma showed synergistic inter-\nactions with the WHOQoL results.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, the prevalence and correlates of multimor-\nbidity (encompassing eight chronic diseases \u00ad angina\npectoris, arthritis, asthma, chronic lung disease, diabetes\nmellitus, hypertension, stroke, and low visual acuity)\namong adults in six LMICs was assessed. The impact of\nmultimorbidity on four health outcome measures (ADL,\ndepression, SRH, and quality of life) was examined.\nThe results show that more than half of the sample\nhad at least one chronic disease and around one-fifth\nhad multimorbidity. Among the six countries, Russia\nhad the highest prevalence of multimorbidity (35 %) and\nChina had the lowest (20 %). Ghana, India, Mexico, and\nSouth Africa had similar levels of multimorbidity, at\naround 22%. Further, it may be noted here that the high\nprevalence of measured hypertension in all six SAGE\ncountries (ranging between 24 % in India to 51 % in\nSouth Africa) contributes substantially to the overall\nprevalence of multimorbidity. A comparative assessment\nof the multimorbidity with inclusion and exclusion of\nhypertension demonstrates that, with the exclusion of\nhypertension, the prevalence of multimorbidity is re-\nmarkably lower (21 % in Russia and 9 % in China) than\nthat with the inclusion of hypertension in multimorbid-\nity measure (Table 1 in Additional file 1).\nThe prevalence of multimorbidity was lower at higher\nlevels of education in all six countries, demonstrating\noverall correlation of low SES with multimorbidity.\nHousehold wealth was negatively associated with multi-\nmorbidity for China and Russia, whereas the other four\ncountries did not show a consistent pattern.

Such patterns may arise on account of bet-\nter access to health care and awareness about prevention\nand control of NCD risk factors among the wealthier\nstratum in high- and middle-income countries on one\nhand, while on the other hand, the wealthier stratum in\nlower income countries look to have higher levels of\nhealth risks like high BMI, high waist-hip ratio, choles-\nterol, and reduced physical activity [52\u00ad55]. Hosseinpoor\net al. [56] have shown that the magnitude and direction\nof socioeconomic inequalities showed different patterns\nacross risk factors such as sex and country income\ngroup. The adoption of risky health behaviors tends to\ntransition from higher to lower socioeconomic groups as\ncountries grow richer [57]. Analysis of cross-sectional\ncorrelates of multimorbidity suggests that multimorbid-\nity is higher among older adults, women, and those with\nlower educational levels. These results are consistent\nThese six LMICs studied are home to a large propor-\ntion (42 %) of the world's older population: a population\nat risk of the NCDs included in this study [60\u00ad63].\nChina faces a steep increase in chronic NCDs [64, 65].\nIndia has to deal with an ongoing high burden from in-\nfectious and parasitic diseases as well as a rapidly rising\nburden from chronic diseases [66]. Mexico has seen a 52\n% rise (from 23 % to 75 %) in the proportion of deaths\nfrom NCDs over the last 50 years [67], with NCDs now\nthe leading cause of death and disease, representing 43\n% of deaths and 51 % of disability-adjusted life years\n[68].

Estimates are obtained through\nMCMC algorithm available in MLWin; there are total 28 pairs of eight diseases, but we excluded seven interactions with stroke due to the small number\nof observations\ndeal with the issue [69]. In Russia, in the face of high\nadult mortality, expectancy began to decline in the mid-\nmainly due to mortality from preventable causes, includ-\ning chronic diseases and related risk factors and a lack\nof comprehensive disease prevention programs for\nNCDs [70\u00ad73]. South Africa is in the midst of a health\ntransition characterized by a quadruple burden of com-\nmunicable, non-communicable, and perinatal and mater-\nnal diseases, and interpersonal violence [74, 75]. The\ngrowing burden of NCDs requires concerted action from\neach of the governments in these countries.\nOverall, the data reported herein indicate that multimor-\nbidity has a significant impact on older adult physical and\nmental health outcomes in LMICs. The results confirm\nthe negative effect of multimorbidity on quality of life,\nphysical functioning, and mental health in LMICs, as has\nies from HICs have further documented the synergistic ef-\nfects of multimorbidity and socioeconomic deprivation\n[17, 78]; however, in contrast, no significant synergistic ef-\nfects of number of diseases and socioeconomic\ndeprivation were observed from this analysis (results are\nnot presented).\nThe published literature suggests interactions between\ndiseases should be considered to estimate contributions\nto health outcomes [80]; therefore, regression models\nwere used in this study to estimate the effects of individ-\nual chronic diseases and disease pairs (interactions) on\nthe four health outcome measures. The estimates re-\nvealed a significant and negative independent effect of\neach of the chronic diseases on ADL limitation, depres-\nsion, poor SRH, and quality of life. The assessment of\ninteraction effects of chronic disease pairs can help in-\nform strategies for the prevention, control, and treat-\nment of chronic diseases. Among disease pairs, the\ninteraction of hypertension with most other NCDs was\nmore than their additive effect on ADL limitation, SRH,\nand quality of life. No significant synergistic interaction\nwas found for depression. These results contribute data\nfrom LMICs to the emerging evidence base on the na-\n81]. Results also showed significant antagonistic interac-\ntions for all measures of health; interaction effects of\ntwo chronic diseases is equal to or lower than the com-\nbined effects of each of the individual diseases, rather\nthan simple additive effects. These data possibly lend\nsupport to evidence that suggests that an individual's\nlevel of functioning is reflected not by a simple sum of\nfunctioning across domains, but by the impact of dis-\neases on the maximally affected domain and the number\nof domains affected [82].\nThe finding that multimorbidity is associated with ad-\nverse health outcomes has critical health care implications\nfor people with multimorbidity in LMICs. Persons with\nmultimorbidity need more inpatient and ambulatory care\n[83\u00ad85]. However, patients with multimorbidity also are\nat higher risk of iatrogenic disease and fragmentation of\ncare because the treatment in such cases is often fo-\ncused on one chronic condition [86]. Most clinical evi-\ndence and guidelines are created by individual disease\nand rarely account for multimorbidity [87, 88]. Given\nthese results, the management of multimorbidity will\nsurely become a considerable challenge for health sys-\ntems worldwide [89] and requires an integrated people-\ncentered service delivery approach with strengthening\nof primary health care systems [90]. The challenge is\nmore pressing for LMICs, with health care systems\noften ill-equipped and largely focused on acute illnesses\nand maternal and child health care [5, 91].\nNoting the potential bias introduced by disease preva-\nlence derived from self-reported physician diagnosis\n[92\u00ad95], this study incorporated a number of alternate\nmethods of estimating disease \u00ad using a mixture of self-\nreported diagnosis, validated symptom reporting-based\ndiagnostic algorithms, and objective health measure-\nments. This makes the findings that multimorbidity is\nalso strongly associated with poor health outcomes in\nLMICs all the more striking and of major importance in\npublic health and policy terms.\nThe findings from this study should be viewed in\nlight of important limitations. First, we have used a\ncount of chronic conditions as a measure of multimor-\nbidity, which implies that each of the diseases has\nequivalent impact on an individual. In reality, the ef-\nfects of multimorbidity on various domains of health\nare likely to depend on disease severity, the unique\ncombination of diseases, and access to treatment and\nsupport. Second, we have modelled main effects of dis-\neases with interaction terms between disease dyads\n(Table 5) to assess the effects of each disease pair on\neach of the four health outcomes. Here, we did not ad-\ndress the interaction of three and higher order interac-\ntions due to data limitations (insufficient observations).\nA third possible limitation relates to the measurement\nof hypertension in this study. The classification of\nhypertension based on an average of three measure-\nments at the interval of 1 minute may have contributed\nto overestimation of hypertension prevalence compared\nto what may arise from measurement based on regular\n24 h monitoring. Finally, the number of diseases in-\ncluded in this analysis was limited to those included in\nthe SAGE study and, as such, may be missing some\nhigher burden conditions, such as dementia and can-\ncers, which could have resulted in an underestimation\nof the prevalence and impacts of multimorbidity [96].\nHowever, a number of studies have analyzed multimor-\nbidity using a smaller number of diseases, usually less\ngardless, the prevalence found herein is striking and the\nreality likely to be even more confronting if all health\nconditions captured.\nConclusions\nThe findings provide novel epidemiological evidence of\nthe impact of multimorbidity on selected health out-\ncome measures for six LMICs which have not previously\nbeen explored in such detail. Understandably, to date,\nLMICs have focused on infectious disease, malnutrition,\nand childhood health. However, these results indicate\nthat there is a growing need to provide effective services\nfor older adults to counter the impact of chronic multi-\nmorbidity on physical and mental health. In particular,\nthe high prevalence of ADL limitations indicates the\nneed for services for older adults. More research is re-\nquired to assess the gaps in the community resources\nfor providing services that maintain quality of life in the\nface of declining health.\nAdditional file\nAdditional file 1: Symptoms and algorithms.
