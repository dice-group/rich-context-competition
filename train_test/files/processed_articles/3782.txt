Outcomes in HFREF patients have drastically\nimproved during the past two decades through strategies\nthat have targeted RAAS activation.1\u00ad4 Plasma renin activ-\nity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone levels are biomarkers\nthat quantitatively reflect RAAS activation and might be\nused for risk stratification in HFREF. Indeed, previous\nstudies have linked higher levels of RAAS activation to\nmore advanced disease stages and worse outcomes both in\nacute and chronic HFREF.5\u00ad9 Most of these studies have\nfocused on PRA as renin is the rate-limiting step of the\nRAAS, and a more reliable reflection of RAAS activation\ncompared to serum aldosterone.10,11 However, these\nPlasma renin activity in patients with\nheart failure and reduced ejection\nfraction on optimal medical therapy\nPetra Nijst1,2, Frederik H Verbrugge1, Pieter Martens1,2,\nPhilippe B Bertrand1,2, Matthias Dupont1, Gary S Francis3,\nWH Wilson Tang4 and Wilfried Mullens1,5\n Keywords\nAldosterone, biomarkers, renin, renin-angiotensin system, systolic heart failure\nDepartment of Cardiology, Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg, Belgium\nDoctoral School for Medicine and Life Sciences, Hasselt University,\nBelgium\n3Cardiovascular Division, University of Minnesota Health Heart Care, USA\nDepartment of Cardiovascular Medicine, Heart and Vascular Institute,\nCleveland Clinic, USA\nBiomedical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine and Life Sciences,\nHasselt University, Belgium\nCorresponding author:\nWilfried Mullens, Department of Cardiology, Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg,\nEmail: wilfried.mullens@zol.be\nOriginal Article\n2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nstudies largely predate the current era of HFREF treatment\nin which angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-\ni), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), beta-blockers and\nmineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) are guide-\nline-recommended therapies. Indeed, nowadays cardiolo-\ngist uptitrate ACE-i/ARB and beta-blockers to the highest\nachievable dose without intolerable side effects (e.g. sys-\ntolic blood pressure <90 mmHg, symptomatic orthostatic\nhypotension, decline in renal function, hyperkalemia).12\nMoreover, whether RAAS activation during decongestive\ntherapy has prognostic significance remains unclear.13\nTherefore, the objective of this study is to describe the\nextent of RAAS activation, and its prognostic impact in\nwell-characterized HFREF populations on optimal medi-\ncal therapy.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThis prospective cohort study was carried out in a single\ntertiary care center (Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg, Genk,\nstudy complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and the\ninstitutional review board approved the study protocol. All\nparticipants provided written informed consent before any\nstudy-specific intervention was performed.\nStudy population\nPatients were eligible for study inclusion if 18 years of\nage and able to give informed consent. Healthy volunteers\nwere recruited through general announcements and had (1)\nno history of cardiac or renal disease, (2) a normal clinical\nexamination, and (3) normal cardiac function on transtho-\nracic echocardiography.\nPatients with acute decompensated HFREF had (1) the\npresence of 3 signs or symptoms of volume overload\n(edema, jugular venous distention, orthopnea, rales or pul-\nmonary vascular congestion on chest X-ray); (2) plasma\nN-terminal of the prohormone of B-type natriuretic pep-\ntide (NT-proBNP) levels >1000 ng/l; (3) a left ventricular\nejection fraction (LVEF) 45%; and (4) a clinical diagno-\nsis of HF with evidence of impaired LVEF 40% within\nsix months before inclusion (5) on optimal medical ther-\napy according to current guideline recommendations or12,14\n(6) were hospitalized with an anticipated treatment strat-\negy of intravenous loop diuretics. Exclusion criteria were\n(1) administration of intravenous diuretics before study\ninclusion; (2) mechanical ventilation; (3) inotropic or\nvasopressor support; (4) concurrent diagnosis of an acute\ncoronary syndrome; (5) renal replacement therapy; or (6)\nventricular assist devices, including the use of an intra-\naortic balloon pump, at any time during the index hospi-\ntalization. During and after index hospitalization\nneurohumoral blockers were uptitrated to the highest pos-\nsible dose without side effects according to guideline rec-\nommendations (defined as optimal dose) and at the\ndiscretion of the treating cardiologist.15\nAmbulatory patients with chronic HFREF had (1) a\nclinical diagnosis of HF with evidence of impaired LVEF\n40% within six months before inclusion; (2) no hospital\nadmission for worsening HF signs or symptoms within six\nmonths before inclusion; (3) stable New York Heart\nAssociation (NYHA) functional class I\u00adIII for 3 months;\n(4) unchanged pharmacological therapy with ACE-i, ARB,\nbeta-blockers, MRA and diuretics during the last three\nmonths prior to inclusion; (5) optimal medical therapy\naccording to current guideline recommendations.12,14\nStudy endpoint\nCardiovascular mortality and HF readmissions (defined as\nhospitalizations because of signs or symptoms of conges-\ntion or low cardiac output that warranted treatment with\nparenteral drugs) were prospectively registered in all study\npatients from inclusion up till three years after which they\nwere censored.\nLaboratory measurements\nVenous blood samples were obtained at the moment of\nstudy inclusion with the patient in the supine position after\nan adaptation period of 30 minutes. Plasma NT-proBNP\nlevels were measured by the Roche Diagnostics Assay\n(Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). PRA was determined\nusing the Gamma-coat*radio immunoassay (DiaSorin,\nSallugia, Italy). Plasma aldosterone levels were assessed\nby the Aldosterone Maia radioimmunoassay (Adaltis,\nRome, Italy).\nWithin the subpopulation of acute decompensated\nHFREF sequential venous blood samples were obtained\nbefore the start of intravenous therapy (baseline), after\nthree days of decongestive therapy, and during ambulatory\nfollow-up approximately six weeks after discharge.\nTreating physicians were blinded to test results and treat-\nment during hospitalization was at their own discretion.\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables are expressed as mean\u00b1standard\ndeviation, if normally distributed, or otherwise by median\n(interquartile range). Normality was assessed by the\nShapiro-Wilk statistic. Categorical data are expressed as\npercentages and compared with the Pearson \u00b2-test. One-\nway analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing or the Kruskal-\nWallis H test were used as indicated. Repeated measures\nwithin the acute decompensated HFREF group were com-\npared using the paired Student's t-test or the Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank test as appropriate. To establish associations\nNijst et al. 3\nbetween PRA and anticipated factors, a multivariable lin-\near regression model was constructed after the logarithmic\ntransformation of PRA to correct for the non-normal distri-\nbution. Variables with a p value <0.100 in univariable\nregression analyses were included in a standard multivari-\nable model. Cumulative survival rates were calculated\naccording to the Kaplan\u00adMeier method with the log-rank\ntest used for comparison among tertiles of PRA. Statistical\nsignificance was always set at a two-tailed probability\nlevel of <0.05. All statistics were performed using SAS\nJMP Pro (version 11.2 for Windows).\nResults\nStudy population\nSeventy-six healthy volunteers, 72 patients with acute\ndecompensated HFREF and 78 ambulatory chronic\nHFREF patients were included.

The primary findings of this study are\n(1) significant PRA is present in ambulatory chronic\nHFREF patients without signs and symptoms of conges-\ntion, while PRA seems depressed during episodes of acute\ndecompensated HFREF with clear signs of volume over-\nload; (2) PRA levels correlate significantly to worse out-\ncomes only in patients with acute decompensated HFREF\nbefore initiation of decongestive treatment; and (3)\ntreatment with neurohormonal blockers significantly influ-\nence neurohormonal levels.\nTo better appreciate the study results, a brief review of the\nRAAS is useful. Renin, an enzyme released by juxtaglo-\nmerular cells of the renal afferent arteriole, starts a cascade\nin which angiotensinogen is cleaved first into angiotensin\nI, which is further metabolized to angiotensin II (Ang II)\nby ACE. Ang II causes systemic and renal arteriolar vaso-\nconstriction, promotes renal tubular sodium and water\nreabsorption, and is a potent stimulator of aldosterone\nrelease from the adrenal glands. Upon an acute drop of the\ncardiac output, RAAS activation helps to preserve organ\nperfusion in general and the glomerular filtration rate in\nparticular.16\u00ad18 Renin is released from the afferent arteriole\nin response to three main stimuli: (1) decreased arterial\nblood pressure sensed by baroreceptor cells in the afferent\narteriolar vessel wall, (2) decreased chloride concentra-\ntions in macula densa cells lining the renal tubules at the\nend of Henle's loop, and (3) sympathetic nerve system\nactivation.19,20 As a result, renin release is physiologically\ninhibited by normal or elevated systemic blood pressure\nand a diet high in salt.21\u00ad23 Persistent and excessive RAAS\nactivation causes adverse ventricular remodeling and con-\ntributes to fluid retention with signs and symptoms of\nHigh PRA in ambulatory chronic HFREF\nMore than two decades ago, before the standard use of\nneurohormonal blockers in HFREF, Francis et al. com-\npared neurohormonal activation--including PRA--in\nhealthy volunteers vs asymptomatic HFREF patients vs\nFigure 2.

This is in contrast to our\nfindings in a contemporary cohort of HFREF patients,\nwhere the most pronounced PRA rise was observed in\nambulatory chronic HFREF patients without signs and\nsymptoms of congestion but well treated with ACE-i,\nARB, beta-blockers and MRA.\nIndeed, ACE-i and ARB tend to lower aldosterone con-\ncentrations, but increase PRA, while beta-blockers might\nFigure 3.

Overall, patients with ambulatory chronic HF had\nsignificantly higher levels of PRA compared to acute\ndecompensated HF patients while exhibiting a much lower\nrisk. Thus, the association between PRA and outcome\nseems to apply only to the higher-risk groups of HF\npatients. Therefore, most probably the PRA and serum\naldosterone levels do not reflect disease-related (harmful)\nRAAS activation and are not a reliable surrogate for down-\nstream receptor activation.48,49 Interestingly, the RAAS\nconsists of two main axes: the classical ACE/Ang II and\nthe counteracting ACE2/angiotensin 1 to 7 (Ang 1\u00ad7)\naxis.50 ACE2, a homolog of ACE, degrades Ang II into\nAng 1\u00ad7. Ang 1\u00ad7 exerts a wide array of actions, many of\nwhich are opposite to those attributed to Ang II (vasodila-\ntion, decrease in fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy,\ninhibition of aldosterone secretion etc.).50,51 In our study\nwe measured PRA, the rate-limiting step of the RAAS sys-\ntem and common to both axes and serum aldosterone.\nHowever, we did not measure Ang II, Ang 1\u00ad7 or other\nproducts of intermediate steps of the complex RAAS. It\nhas been shown that in response to ACE-i, PRA rises but\nplasma levels of Ang 1\u00ad7 also increase. A high percentage\nof ambulatory chronic HF patients, but also acute decom-\npensated patients were on ACE-i as well as MRA.\nTherefore, it may be a logical hypothesis that the increased\nrenin activity due to efficient blockade of the classical\nACE/Ang II axis leads to stimulation of the counteracting\nand beneficial axis of the RAAS (ACE2/Ang 1\u00ad7), which\nmay be partly responsible for the beneficial effects of this\ntherapy in HF patients. This could be an interesting topic\nfor further research for the development of new targets for\nHF therapies.\nPRA in acute HFREF\nAs neurohormonal activation is often perceived as the key\ndriver in HFREF disease progression, it may seem odd that\nPRA and serum aldosterone levels are significantly lower\nin patients with signs and symptoms of congestion.\nFurthermore, this contradicts former observations in med-\nication-naive HFREF patients.7 Yet, most chronic HFREF\npatients in the current study were on maximally tolerated\ndosages of neurohormonal blockers and also have rather\nlow blood pressure. Both are powerful predictors of PRA\nlevels in our overall population (Table 2). In contrast, most\npatients with acute decompensated HFREF present with\nelevated rather than low arterial blood pressure, a finding\nalso present in the current study.52 Intriguingly, this might\nindicate that the RAAS in advanced HFREF treated with\nneurohormonal blockers remains appropriately responsive\nto hemodynamic changes including blood pressure and\nvolume overload. Also, the most important increase in\nRAAS activation during the treatment of acute HFREF is\nseen in the first days of hospitalization, which seem to be\nlinked to decongestive therapy (reduction in plasma vol-\nume as well as intensified diuretic therapy) and introduc-\ntion and/or uptitration of neurohormonal blockers.\nTherefore, one might speculate that PRA could be a poten-\ntial surrogate for effective circulatory volume assessment.\nPrognostic value of PRA\nPRA levels correlate significantly to worse outcomes\nonly in patients with acute decompensated HFREF\nbefore decongestive treatment. High levels of neurohor-\nmones in stable HFREF patients are not predictive for\nrehospitalization due to water and salt retention or death.\nAlso, the relation of high PRA levels and negative out-\ncome in acute decompensated HFREF might not be\ndriven by higher neurohormonal activation but rather\nreflect more advanced disease in this subgroup, reflect-\ning volume overload and low pressure, both known to be\nrelated to worse outcome.50,51 In conclusion, it seems\nthat the association between an RAAS biomarker and\nadverse outcomes applies only to the setting and not to\nits absolute value.\nStudy limitations\nFirst, we recruited and compared two groups of HFREF\npatients. Although we were able to characterize these\ngroups in detail, it is uncertain to what extent observed\ndifferences in RAAS activation were due to heterogeneity\nbetween groups. The fact that all patients were recruited\nfrom a single institution, the limited sample size and event\nrates makes findings hypothesis-generating and ask for\nseparate confirmation. Second, patients with urgent need\nfor administration of loop diuretics, inotropic/vasodilator\nor mechanical support were not included in this study.\nThus, our data do not apply to severely decompensated\nHF patients or patients in cardiogenic shock. Third, all\npatients were put in a semi-supine position for an adapta-\ntion period before a venous blood sample was drawn.\nHowever, besides physical activity, PRA also depends on\nmany other variables such as circadian rhythm, sodium\nintake, and presence/absence of disease states that could\nnot be accounted for in this cohort study.53\n8 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nConclusion\nPRA is decreased in a state of acute decompensation com-\npared to ambulatory chronic HFREF. An increase in PRA\nactivity is observed in the majority of patients during\ndecongestive treatment and neurohormonal blocker upti-\ntration. However, increased PRAis associated with adverse\noutcomes only in the setting of acute decompensated\nHFREF before initiation of decongestive treatment.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nNone declared.\nFunding\nP.
