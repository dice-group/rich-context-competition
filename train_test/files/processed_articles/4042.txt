Traditional explanations of sex differences in human\nmortality rates are based only on proximate mechanistic factors (e.g., Rogers, Hummer, and\nNam, 2000). In recent decades, evolutionary researchers proposed that these differences\nresult from the interaction of genetic heritage shaped by sexual selection with conditions in\nthe social and developmental environment (e.g., Wilson and Daly, 1993). Sex differences\nin human mortality rates arise from genetic, physiological, behavioral, and social causes\nMale mating competition and mortality\nthat are best understood when integrated in an evolutionary life history framework (Kruger\nMales of most species allocate less effort to parental investment than females.\nFemales are more discriminating in mate choice because of their greater costs in\nreproduction. Thus, male reproductive success is strongly related to the ability to compete\nfor mating opportunities, whether by winning fights with other males, competing for social\nstatus or territory, or by presenting displays preferred by females (Darwin, 1871; Trivers,\n1972). Males who succeed in mating competitions have more offspring, and this shapes\ntraits that enhance mating outcomes. This occurs even for traits that may also lead to\nphysiological and behavioral differences that make males more prone to injury, sickness\nand early death.\nPotentially lethal violence is a facet of human male mating competition. This\nincludes both within and between group conflicts (Chagnon, 1988). Violence may result\nfrom competition over access to and control of resources, as well as position in the status\nhierarchy (Buss and Shackelford, 1997). Men can successfully use violence to elevate their\nsocial status and gain respect from others (Campbell, 1993; Chagnon, 1992; Hill and\nHurtado, 1996). Greater male mortality rates also arise from greater non-violent risk taking,\nleading to higher numbers of accidents, especially in young adulthood when males are\nSex differences shaped by sexual selection interact with the environment to yield a\npattern with some consistency, but also with expected variations due to differential\nenvironmental conditions (Kruger and Nesse, 2006, 2007). The relationship between male\nmortality rates and factors related to the shape of the distribution of male reproductive\nsuccess across species is likely mirrored by variation within our own species. This paper\nexamines the relationship between three socio-demographic factors related to the degree of\nvariation and skew in male reproductive success and the degree of excess male mortality,\nthe degree to which male mortality rates exceed those for females in the same population.\nMale mortality rates are expected to be higher in nations where indicators of social\nconditions suggest a higher intensity of male mating competition.\nPolygyny\nPolygyny is the most common mammalian mating system, probably because of the\nprevalence of female specialization in infant nutritional provisioning and care and male\npolygynous species, a few males will have many offspring while many others will have\nnone. This creates powerful selection pressure for traits that lead to success in mating\ncompetition. The results include elaborate ornaments (such as the peacock's tail) and\narmaments (such as a deer's antlers), all with substantial costs. Recently, Clutton-Brock\nand Isvaran (2007) have shown that across vertebrate species, the longevity gap between\nmales and females is highest among polygynous species. An archetypal example of\npolygyny is the elephant seal, where the disproportionately large males compete intensely\nfor large harems of females and most males die before reproducing. The variance in\nestimated lifetime reproductive success among males is over four times that of females (Le\nThe intense male competition for reproductive access in polygynous species selects\nfor strategies that enhance competitive success at the cost of longevity (Kirkwood and\nMale mating competition and mortality\ncorrespond with greater male-male competition and risky male behavior (Plavcan, 2000;\nPlavcan and van Schaik, 1997; Plavcan, van Schaik, and Kappeler, 1995), larger size and\narmor of males, and exaggerated male mortality rates compared to females (Leutenegger\nand Kelly, 1977). There is a strong correlation between sexual size dimorphism and excess\nmale mortality across mammalian taxa, especially when accounting for phylogenetic\nHumans are far less polygynous than most other primates, but the variation in male\nreproductive success is still substantially higher than that for females. A few males gain a\ndisproportionately high number of matings, creating a positively skewed distribution of\nmale reproductive success that makes mating competition a potent selection force in\nhumans (Betzig, 1986). Biologists note that increased sexual dimorphism, where males are\nlarger than females, is directly and positively related to the level of male mating\ncompetition (see Bribiescas, 2006). Human females are on average 80% as large as males\n(Clutton-Brock, 1985), suggesting humans are at least mildly polygynous. Polygyny occurs\nin the vast majority of cultures (84%) documented by anthropologists (Ember, Ember, and\nHuman populations vary in their degree of polygyny, corresponding with factors\nsuch as high male mortality in war and high pathogen stress (Ember et al., 2007). Polygyny\nis most abundant where males are heterogeneous in the quality of their territories and in\nhuman societies when there is substantial inequality in resources and social status\n(Borgerhoff Mulder, 1990; Orians, 1969). The degree of polygyny likely reflects the\nintensity of male mating competition. Higher levels of competition would be associated\nwith higher male mortality rates.\nSocio-economic inequality\nSexual selection helps to explain some sex differences in psychology and behavior,\nincluding stronger male tendencies for risk-taking, competitiveness, and sensitivity to\nsocial hierarchy (Cronin, 1991). Human male parental investment is relatively high\namongst mammals (especially primates), and paternal investment in offspring may enhance\noffspring survival (Hill and Hurtado, 1996) and reproductive success (Geary, 2005). Thus\nwomen prefer males with high socio-economic status as marriage partners, as these men\nhave an abundance of acquired resources and high potential for investment (Buss, 1989).\nMeasures of male social status and economic power directly relate to reproductive success\nacross a wide variety of societies (see Hopcroft, 2006). During recent human evolution,\nmales who did not have substantial resources or status may have been unable to establish\nlong-term relationships. Over the course of human genetic and cultural co-evolution,\nvariance in male wealth and power increased through sociopolitical arrangements and inter-\nWhere there is greater variation and skew in male social status and resource control,\nthere will be greater competition for positions of power and status, leading to higher male\nmortality rates. Relative socioeconomic position has a stronger influence on mortality rates\nfor males than for females (Bopp and Minder, 2003; Kruger and Nesse, 2006; Martikainen,\nMakela, Koskinen, and Valkonene, 2001). Increases in the uncertainly of economic\nopportunities and variability in males social status and resource control within populations\nare also associated with elevated male mortality rates (Kruger and Nesse, 2007). Thus, the\nMale mating competition and mortality\ndegree of the economic disparity between the elite and impoverished may be directly\nrelated to the degree of excess male mortality across human populations.\nOperational sex ratio\nThe operational sex ratio (OSR) was originally defined as the average ratio of\nsexually active males to sexually receptive females in a population (Emlen and Oring,\n1977). Across species, a male biased OSR is associated with polyandry and a female biased\nOSR is associated with polygyny (Emlen and Oring, 1977). Darwin (1871) realized that the\nsex ratio of a species was usually even between males and females, the influential factors\nhe described were later incorporated into the formal mathematical models of D\u00fcsing (1884)\nand Fisher (1930). This numerical equilibrium occurs on an evolutionary time scale,\nspecific human populations may have imbalanced sex ratios (Darwin, 1871).\nFisher (1958) noted that the rare sex is more valuable in any marriage market and is\nable to be more selective of partners. The more plentiful sex faces greater intrasexual\ncompetition in securing a potential mate. When the OSR is male biased, available men\noutnumber available women and the enhanced power of female choice increases the level\nof male social status and resource provisioning potential necessary for obtaining partners\n(Pederson, 1991). In these populations, men with lower socio-economic status have an\nespecially difficult time getting married (Pollet and Nettle, 2007). The degree of male bias\nin a population may be directly related to the intensity of male competition for social status,\nresources, and reproductive partners. Thus, populations with higher OSRs may also exhibit\nhigher Male:Female Mortality Ratios (M:F MRs). In human populations, the OSR may be\noperationalized as the ratio of reproductively viable males to reproductively viable females\nin a population.\nHypotheses\nThis study examines the relationship between three socio-demographic factors that\nmay be related to the degree of variation and skew in male reproductive success. Each\nfactor comprises a unique aspect presumably related to the intensity of male mating\ncompetition. Consistent with patterns observed across species, the degree of excess male\nmortality in humans should follow the intensity of male mating competition.\nHypothesis 1: The prevalence of polygyny will be directly associated with the\nMale:Female Mortality Ratio (M:F MR).\nHypothesis 2: The degree of economic inequality will be directly associated with\nthe M:F MR.\nHypothesis 3: The degree of male bias (relative female scarcity) in a population will\nbe directly associated with the M:F MR.\nMethod\nKanazawa and Still (1999) created a polygyny index based on anthropological\nclassifications of cultural groups within nations weighted by their proportion in the nation's\npopulation. The cultural group classifications are taken from the Encyclopedia of World\n= monogamy is the rule but some polygyny occurs; 2 = polygyny is the rule or cultural\nMale mating competition and mortality\nideal but is limited in practice; and 3 = polygyny is the rule and is widespread. This index\nprovides summary scores for 101 nations, 84 of which are also represented in the World\nHealth Organization's Mortality Database (http://www3.who.int/whosis), used to calculate\nthe Male:Female Mortality Ratio (M:F MR).\nThe standard measure for the degree of economic inequality in a population is the\nGini coefficient (Gini, 1921), which is based on the degree of departure of the Lorenz curve\nrepresenting the proportion of the total income by the proportion of income cumulatively\nearned by the bottom x% of the population from the line representing total income equality.\nGini coefficients for most nations are available from the USA's Central Intelligence\nAgency's World Factbook (https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/).\nThe Operational Sex Ratio (OSR) was calculated as the ratio of males to females in\na nation in the 15-44 year age range. These data are available from the United Nations'\nDemographic Yearbook (http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2.htm).\nData for polygyny, economic inequality, the OSR, and mortality rates are simultaneously\navailable for 70 countries. The predictors were allowed to enter stepwise in a linear\nregression model to determine if they each make a unique contribution to the variance in\nthe degree of excess male mortality across nations.\nResults\nThe degree of economic inequality and degree to which polygyny was widespread\nwere directly and significantly related to the Male:Female Mortality Ratio (M:F MR, see\nTable 1). These two predictors were also related to each other, sharing 17% of their\nvariance. The ratio of males to females in a nation in the 15-44 year age range was not\nsignificantly related to the Male:Female Mortality Ratio and was inversely related to the\ndegree of economic inequality. The bivariate distributions of nations are represented in\nFigures 1 and 2; the predicted relationships for economic inequality and polygyny were not\ndriven by outliers. There were many nations where monogamy is the rule and is\nwidespread.\nTable 1. Correlations among the Male:Female Mortality Ratio (M:F MR) and factors\npresumably related to male mating competition.\nPolygyny Gini OSR M SD\nMale mating competition and mortality\nFigure 1.

These two predictors collectively accounted for 53%\nof the variance in sex differences in mortality rates across nations.\nMale mating competition and mortality\nFigure 2. National M:F MR by degree of polygyny.\nDiscussion\nStudy results support the argument that socio-demographic factors arguably related\nto the intensity of male mating competition influence the extent to which male mortality\nrates are elevated above female mortality rates. The degree of polygyny directly represents\nthe level of variation and skew in male mating success, differentials in male socio-\neconomic status are associated with reproductive success and larger differentials may\nintensify male competition for partners and raise the standards (including those related to\nresource provisioning) for which men are considered suitable for marriage. These findings\nreplicate similar associations seen across species between male mortality patterns and\nvariance in reproductive success. Results did not support a relationship between excess\nmale mortality and a relative abundance of men in the population.\nAlthough the causal framework for excess male mortality incorporates multiple\ninteracting levels of complexity from genetics to population parameters, the intensity of\nmale mating competition may be the most crucial factor influencing the variation observed.\nAlthough polygyny and economic inequality are defined independently and explain unique\nportions of the variance in the degree of excess male mortality, they likely co-vary as\ndifferentials in male socio-economic status and resource control underlie many polygynous\nhuman mating systems. Future studies could examine meditational pathways between\nsocial and environmental conditions, physiology and molecular biomarkers, psychology\nMale mating competition and mortality\nand behavior, and mortality incidence.\nIt is possible that the operational sex ratio (OSR) is in part an artifact of higher male\nmortality rates. In a cross-national comparison, nations with relatively high mortality rates\nwould see a substantial demographic impact of excess male mortality. In effect, excess\nmale mortality would decrease the OSR, thus attenuating this relationship. Within nations\nwith relatively lower mortality rates, localized OSRs have exhibit the predicted relationship\nwith the M:F MR. In the USA, where regional differences in the OSR are largely driven by\neconomic migration (Gwin, 2007), the OSR has a direct positive relationship with the level\nof excess male mortality (Kruger and Nesse, 2005).\nThese analyses are limited by the currently availability of data. The indicators are\nrather crude compared to more detailed and/or sophisticated measurements, which may not\nbe available at this time. The polygyny indicator is ordinal at best, as it is based on\nclassifications of the degree to which polygyny is accepted and considered widespread,\nrather than the actual degree of variation and skew in quantitative assessments of men's\naccess to mating partners. Population estimates many not be accurate, and even when valid\ncensus counts are available these numbers may not truly represent the numbers of men and\nwomen who are active in the mating market.\nDespite these limitations, the magnitude of associations are substantial, suggesting\nthat even crude and approximate indicators are sufficient to reveal the hypothesized\nrelationships. The strength of the association between socio-economic factors and mortality\npatterns would likely be considerably stronger if more accurate and precise quantitative\nrepresentations of these constructs were available. Replications of these results will be\nlikely when additional data becomes available.\nThe psychological salience and perception of the economic gradient may mediate\nthe relationships with behavior, health, and mortality. Assessments of attitudes and\nperceptions could reveal the accuracy of popular beliefs. Market driven mass media may\nfoster unrealistic expectations for the level of socio-economic achievement necessary for\nreaching common goals such as marital success and raising a family.\nThe relationship between social inequality and adverse health outcomes, even for\nthose in upper socio-economic ranges, is increasingly recognized (e.g., Wilkinson and\nPickett, 2009). The dramatic social and health benefits associated with relative egalitarian\nsocieties (see Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009) may be substantial incentives for social\nleveling. However, despite the potential benefits of economic leveling interventions, any\neffort to substantially reduce variations in wealth and resource control will likely face\nconsiderable political opposition. Paradoxically, opposition to such redistributions will be\nespecially prevalent from men. Due to the long association of male status and reproductive\nsuccess in our evolutionary history, men are both more sensitive to their position in the\nsocial hierarchy as well as to perceived threats to their relative status. The fragility of\nsocialist utopias such as the Paris Commune of 1871 and other communities intentionally\nsuppressing status differentials reveals the difficulty in sustainably implementing such\nsocial structures. Edward O. Wilson once remarked that \"Karl Marx was right, socialism\nworks; it is just that he had the wrong species\" (Novacek, 2001). In sum, this study\ncontributes to the growing body of literature demonstrating the substantial benefits that the\nevolutionary framework offers for understanding social patterns and important social\nissues.\nMale mating competition and mortality\nReferences\nBetzig, L.
