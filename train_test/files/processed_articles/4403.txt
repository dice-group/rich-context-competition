Eighteen SFA schools across England and 18 control schools, matched on prior achievement and\ndemographics, were included in this quasi-experimental study. The results of hierarchical linear modeling analysis reveal a\nstatistically significant positive school-level effect for SFA schools compared with control schools on standardized reading\nmeasures of word-level and decoding skills, and there were directionally positive but nonsignificant school-level effects on\nmeasures of comprehension and fluency. Practical and policy implications of these findings are discussed, particularly as they\nrelate to recent English government policies encouraging schools to implement research-proven approaches.\n",

Consequently, there is a need\nfor proven-programs designed to address these inequalities.\nEarly Literacy\nOne of the keys to later educational attainment is early liter-\nacy acquisition. Strong literacy achievement can lead to chil-\ndren being able to access the whole curriculum, and the\nearlier they do so the more beneficial it is. In contrast, early\nliteracy problems can hinder children's knowledge and\ndevelopment, with long-term consequences for their\neducational outcomes (Lesnick, George, Smithgall, &\nFor many years, research on beginning reading has sup-\nported the use of explicit, systematic phonics instruction\n(National Reading Panel, 2000). In particular, the Rose\n(2006) Review called for phonics to be taught systematically\nin schools. Synthetic or systematic phonics involves teaching\nthe discrete sounds that letters make, to help children blend\nor \"sound out\" new words.\nThe importance placed on synthetic phonics in England is\nreflected in current policy. For example, following the Rose\nReview, the English Primary Framework and the associated\nphonics resources Letters and Sounds (Department for\nEducation and Skills, 2007) emphasize synthetic phonics\npractices. Letters and Sounds outlines systematic phonics\nteaching in daily, briskly paced lessons to facilitate early lit-\neracy acquisition. In 2011, a national phonics assessment to\nbe administered at the end of Year 1 (when children are typi-\ncally 6 years old) was piloted and then rolled out nationwide\nin 2012. The government's intention was to incentivize\nschools to better support pupils to master basic phonics skills\nin Year 1.

For example, they have instituted a policy of\nallocating a \"pupil premium\" to schools based on the number\nof children who are eligible for free school meals due to pov-\nerty. Schools are encouraged to adopt proven practices with\nthis additional funding. A systematic review of reading pro-\ngrams suggested that the most successful programs were\nthose that included a broad curriculum that included system-\natic phonics instruction as well as teaching in vocabulary and\ncomprehension (Slavin, Lake, Chambers, Cheung, & Davis,\nof effectiveness. One of the few programs listed in the top\ncategory was the Success for All (SFA) program, based\nmainly on evidence from evaluations conducted in the United\nStates.\nSFA\nSFA is a whole-school reform program, started in the United\nStates in 1987. The program's design is based on a model\nthat posits that substantially enhancing success in high-\npoverty schools depends on a multidimensional intervention\napproach. This includes providing extensive professional\ndevelopment, effective teaching strategies, emphasizing\ncooperative learning, and school-wide structures focusing on\nschool leadership, parent involvement, and attendance,\nwhich are expected to jointly enhance reading performance\nand other outcomes (see Slavin, Madden, Chambers, &\nHaxby, 2009, for a complete description). SFA began to be\nused in the United Kingdom in 1997, and it now serves more\nthan 100 schools in England, Scotland, and Wales. One pre-\nvious small-scale study found positive effects of SFA in the\nUnited Kingdom (Hopkins, Youngman, Harris, &\nWordsworth, 1999), although another study found positive\noutcomes in Year 1, but mixed outcomes in Year 2 (Tymms\n& Merrell, 2001). However, in a policy context demanding\nmore rigorous evidence for interventions intended for use in\nthe United Kingdom, there remained a need for a large-scale\nevaluation of the approach in the schools as they exist today.\nThe theory of action behind SFA emphasizes prevention\nand early, intensive intervention, to keep pupils on the path\nto success throughout their time in primary school and\nbeyond. Prevention includes approaches used in Nursery and\nReception intended to build children's background knowl-\nedge, vocabulary, and phonemic awareness using strategies\nemphasizing cooperative learning, theme-based activities,\nand stories. It then focuses on proven teaching methods for\nbeginning reading in Reception and Year 1 and for reading\nand writing in Year 2 and beyond. Early intervention includes\ntutoring and outreach to parents to solve children's problems\nbefore they become serious.\nA strong emphasis within teaching in SFA is the use of\ncooperative learning. The cooperative learning strategies\nemployed have children learning in mixed-ability pairs or\ngroups of four, in which positive interdependence and indi-\nvidual accountability are key. This means that teams are\nrewarded for each team member's learning. Each pupil is\nheld accountable for his or her own learning and for helping\ngroup mates learn as well. Research has long suggested that\ncooperative learning has many benefits across the curricu-\nlum, including in literacy development (Law, 2008; Slavin,\nshown to increase student motivation, and the brisk pacing\nand in-built routines ensure that time is used effectively by\nboth students and teachers. It is designed to give students\nopportunities to try out their understandings in a safe envi-\nronment, to receive immediate feedback, and to \"learn by\nteaching\" in describing their current state of knowledge to a\npeer. From Year 1 onward, pupils are taught in classes\nregrouped so that all are at one reading level, though they\nmay be from different year levels. Groupings are changed\neach term in light of pupils' performance. A daily 90-min\nbeginning reading program called Reading Roots introduces\nsynthetic phonics and builds further vocabulary, fluency, and\ncomprehension skills, in line with the recommendations of\nthe Rose (2006) Review and the U.S. National Reading Panel\n(2000). Reading Roots uses phonetic readers, which children\nread to each other in pairs, as well as real children's litera-\nture, vocabulary development, and comprehension activities.\nEmbedded video introduces letter sounds, sound blending,\nvocabulary comprehension skills, and writing. Children\nwork in pairs and small groups to help each other master the\ncontent.\nAfter the Year 1 reading level, children enter Reading\nWings, where they work in four-member cooperative groups\nto help each other apply and extend their phonics skills and\nbuild comprehension, fluency, and vocabulary. Pupils learn\nand apply metacognitive skills such as clarification, summa-\nrization, and graphic organizers to gain skill in comprehend-\ning texts of increasing sophistication. Pupils also learn a\nwriting process approach in which they help each other plan,\ndraft, revise, edit, and \"publish\" compositions in various\ngenres.\nThe SFA teaching elements are sufficient to enable most\nchildren to succeed in reading, but some children need more\nthan this. The schools provide tutoring for children who are\nstruggling in reading, and reach out to parents to help with\nhome literacy, attendance, behavior, and other issues of\nimportance in children's overall development.\nEach SFA school has a facilitator on its staff, an experi-\nenced teacher who works with the staff members to help\nensure that all program elements are being implemented with\nhigh quality and coordinated with each other. Extensive\nTracey et al. 3\nContinuing Professional Development (CPD) is provided to\neach school by SFA-UK, a U.K. registered charity. This\nincludes initial training and coaching visits to the school over\ntime.\nSFA rose to prominence through the whole-school reform\nmovement in the United States. Research on whole-school\nreform has highlighted the difficulties involved in the scale-\nup of programs across schools, and in particular, their repli-\ncability, Rowan, Camburn, and Barnes (2004) have indicated\nthat SFA has been particularly successful in replicating its\nprogram due to its \"bureaucratic approach\" to program\nimplementation. However, other studies have also indicated\nthat a more pragmatic approach facilitated SFA's rapid\nexpansion across schools, not least due to the practice of\n\"collaborating with schools in a knowledge-producing enter-\nSFA is also in evidence in its introduction and implementa-\ntion in the United Kingdom.\nAlthough the United Kingdom has not traditionally fol-\nlowed the whole-school reform movement begun in the\nUnited States, the scale-up and replication of programs is, as\nindicated above, increasingly becoming an issue. This is\npartly a response to the Allen (2011) Report but has been\nreinforced by the establishment of the Education Endowment\nFoundation (http://educationendowment-foundation.org.uk/)\nand the establishment of the What Works evidence centers\nfor social policy.\nAlthough its basic structure is the same as its U.S. ver-\nsion, SFA has been substantially adapted to the language,\nculture, and standards of England, Scotland, and Wales. It is\naligned with the Letters and Sounds requirements of\nEngland's Department for Education and emphasizes the\nsame curricular elements, focusing on systematic instruction\nin phonemic awareness and phonics, as well as vocabulary\nand comprehension. It has a fast-paced and structured\napproach to teaching, intended to ensure that pupils have\nsolid reading skills by the end of Key Stage 1 (when they are\n7 years old).\nThe adaptation has, however, also brought its own con-\ncessions to adjust to local circumstances. For example, the\nfamily services aspect of SFA has proved to be underutilized\nin the United Kingdom, with the emphasis being on within-\nschool practices. Consequently, this evaluation focuses on\nthe school-based components of the program.\nPrevious Research on SFA\nMore than 40 empirical studies have shown positive effects\nof SFA on a variety of measures of student attainment (Quint\nMadden, 2011). The cumulative evidence from these studies\nshows positive effects of SFA on a variety of measures of\nstudent achievement, as well as on assignments to special\neducation, retentions, and other outcomes (Borman, Hewes,\nIn particular, a large cluster randomized controlled trial\nin the United States involved a 3-year longitudinal sample\nof children who participated in the SFA or control condi-\ntion from kindergarten through the second grade (Borman\net al., 2007). Hierarchical linear model (HLM) analysis\nrevealed statistically significant school-level effects of\nassignment to SFA on literacy outcomes. In addition, a\nsynthesis of 23 studies of SFA found a mean effect size of\nlowest 25% of their classes at pretest (Slavin et al., 2011).\nThese studies of SFA tend to focus on the early years of\nlearning to read, building on the evidence that early liter-\nacy acquisition can reduce educational inequalities\n(Lesnick et al., 2010). Studies on the later grades in pri-\nmary/elementary schools by Hanselman and Borman\n(2013) suggest that these gains may not be sustained.\nAlthough Hanselman and Borman suggest that early expo-\nsure may be the key to later gains and these findings may\nbe more a factor of the high levels of student turnover in\nhigh-poverty schools.\nAs noted earlier, the first major evaluation of the adapted\nprogram in the United Kingdom found positive impacts on\nliteracy outcomes (Hopkins et al., 1999). Tymms and Merrell\n(2001) found positive effects in Year 1 and mixed effects at\nthe end of Year 2. Using outcome estimates from the most\nrigorous studies with U.K. cost estimates, the Dartington\nSocial Research Unit estimated that each pound invested in\nSFA yields \u00a314.78 pounds of benefits to the individuals and\nsociety (http://dartington.org.uk/projects/investing-in-chil-\ndren). However, earlier U.K. studies involved a small num-\nber of schools, allowing for the possibility that school\ncharacteristics could explain observed differences. In addi-\ntion, these studies began in the 1990s, whereas this study\nplaces schools within the more recent and changing educa-\ntional context in England.\nThe study reported here is the first large-scale, compre-\nhensive evaluation of SFA in England in the early years of\nschooling.\nMethod\nResearch Design\nThis quasi-experimental study involved 20 schools already\nimplementing SFA and 20 schools matched to the SFA\nschools in terms of prior attainment and demographics, to\nprovide a comparison cohort. As the intervention affects the\nwhole school, a long-term evaluation was considered to be\nthe most appropriate approach to gain an assessment of the\nimpact on students' reading achievement over time. The\nlarge number of schools involved in the study enables the use\nof appropriate statistical methods for clustered (school-level)\ndesigns, with adequate statistical power to detect true differ-\nences. It also allows for an evaluation of the program as it is\nactually used in England as opposed to a small study that\n4 SAGE Open\nmight provide more implementation support than a typical\nscenario.\nSample\nSchools were recruited in Spring 2008 by researchers from\nthe Institute for Effective Education (IEE) at the University\nof York, using lists provided by SFA-UK. Once 20 SFA\nschools were recruited, researchers started to recruit control\nschools whose overall characteristics matched those of the\nSFA schools. Key matching characteristics were\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 percentage of children achieving Level 4 or above on\nthe Key Stage 2 (KS2) literacy SATs, for the 3 years\nprior to the intervention school adopting SFA;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 percentage of pupils in receipt of (or eligible for) free\nschool meals (FSM); and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 percentage of pupils with English as an Additional\nLanguage (EAL).\nAll schools (control and intervention) agreed to allow for\nindividual testing of their children and to allow observers\naccess to SFA/literacy classes of the appropriate year group.\nIn fall 2008, these were the children entering Reception\nclasses. Children were pretested in September 2008 and then\nwere posttested in June\u00adJuly 2009 at the end of Reception,\nand then at the end of Year 1 and Year 2. Control schools\nwere provided with a financial reward of \u00a32,000 per year for\nparticipating in the study to compensate for the potential dis-\nruption to the school during the assessment period.\nIn addition to receiving head teacher consent, parental\ninformation and opt-out forms were sent to the schools to be\ndistributed to all children entering Reception that September.\nAll children in Reception who had permission to participate\nwere then individually pre- and posttested. Each year, teach-\ners were to continue with their normal classroom practices--\nwhether that was SFA or any other method for teaching\nliteracy (e.g., Letters and Sounds, Jolly Phonics, Read Write\nInc.). The SFA schools had been involved with SFA for\nbetween 1 and 8 years. Trainers from SFA-UK made their\nnormal implementation visits to each school throughout the\nyear.\nTable 1 shows the characteristics of the original 40 schools\nrecruited and of the final sample of (36) schools by the end\nvariables on which they were matched and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 the percentage of children achieving Level 4 or above\non the KS2 maths and science SATs, for the 3 years\nprior to the intervention school adopting SFA;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 the percentage of pupils with statements of Special\nEducational Needs (SEN);\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 the enrollment figures; and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 the overall level of absences reported within the con-\ntrol compared with the intervention schools.\nOver the years, four schools dropped out of the study, two\ncontrol and two experimental. The experimental and control\nschools involved in the original baseline were well matched\non all characteristics except (significantly) the percentage of\nchildren with EAL and in receipt of FSM, despite these being\nkey matching criteria. This can be explained by the fact that,\nduring recruitment, researchers used school-provided data as\nthe matching criteria, which was inevitably flawed as recruit-\nment occurred prior to children entering Reception classes\nand schools appear to have varied in providing school-level\ndata and the anticipated profile of their September 2008\nintake. Researchers therefore obtained official data regarding\nfrom the (then) DCSF (now the Department for Education\n[DfE]). In both cases, however, the intervention schools had\nhigher levels of pupils in each category (45% vs. 22% and\n44% vs. 33%, respectively). In addition, nonstatistically sig-\nnificant differences can be seen in the pretest measure of\nreceptive vocabulary on starting school (the British Picture\nVocabulary Scale [BPVS]), the proportion of pupils within\nschools with Special Educational Needs supported by out-\nside agencies, and in the KS2 SATs results for the 3 years\nbefore take-up of SFA, again, with the advantage being in\nfavor of the control schools.\nHowever, because of attrition, by the end of the study,\nthere remained a significantly higher percentage of children\nwith EAL in the SFA schools (46% vs. 24% for the control\nschools). SFAschools also had nonsignificantly higher levels\nof children eligible for FSM (43% vs. 36%).\nThe sample includes schools from a range of regional\ncontexts throughout England representing the national reach\nof the program, with a relatively high percentage of children\neligible for FSM (approximately 40%).\nMeasures\nThe pretest, undertaken on entry to Reception (September\n2008), was the British Picture Vocabulary Scale\u00adSecond\nEdition (BPVS-II). This is a measure of receptive vocabulary\nand is an English adaptation of the Peabody Picture\nVocabulary Scale. Children are told a word and then asked to\npoint to one of four pictures that represents that word. The\nBPVS-II was normed on a national sample of children in the\nUnited Kingdom and has a Cronbach's alpha of .93 and a\nsplit-half reliability of .86 (Dunn, Dunn, Whetton, & Burley,\nDuring June/July 2011, the same children at the end of\nYear 2 were posttested using the Word Identification and\nWord Attack scales of the Woodcock Reading Mastery\nTests\u00adRevised (WRMT). The Word Identification scale mea-\nsures the child's ability to read isolated words and the Word\nAttack scale assesses children's ability to decode and \"sound\nout\" nonsense words. The WRMT was normed on a U.S.\nnational sample of children and the internal reliability coef-\nficients for the two scales used were .97 and .87, respectively\nTracey et al. 5\nIn addition, testers administered the York Assessment of\nReading Comprehension (YARC), a standardized measure of\naccuracy, reading rate, and comprehension. The YARC was\nnormed on a U.K. national sample of children. The reliability\ncoefficients for the three subtests for Year 2 children were\ntrained, and supervised by the researchers at the IEE.\nAssessors were not made aware of schools' treatment\nconditions.\nIntervention schools were visited by SFA consultants and\nresearchers to assess implementation fidelity and control\nschools were visited by researchers to observe general liter-\nacy practices and assess to what extent key elements of the\nSFA program (in particular cooperative learning) were being\npracticed.\nAs noted previously, four schools left the study, two inter-\nvention and two control schools, making assessment of those\nchildren impossible. This was primarily due to changes in\nhead teacher or in the direction of the school. Given the lon-\ngitudinal nature of the study, a number of children left due to\nthe high rate of movement between schools often found in\nvulnerable communities. As this was a longitudinal study\nand the analyses completed at the school level, subjects were\nnot replaced with new students.\nAnalyses\nThis quasi-experimental cluster evaluation was analyzed\nusing a HLM with school as the unit of analysis (Raudenbush\n& Bryk, 2002). All multilevel models were estimated using\nthe HLM software's restricted maximum likelihood (REML)\nestimation procedure (Raudenbush, Bryk, Cheong, &\nCongdon, 2000). Pretests (the BPVS) were used as covari-\nates. This multilevel approach is the optimal design for\nschool-based interventions. It addresses the effects of stu-\ndents being clustered within schools, and it is well aligned\nwith the theory of how this educational intervention works:\nas a coordinated, systemic initiative delivered by school-\nlevel elements acting in concert. Multilevel analysis greatly\nreduces statistical power, requiring many more schools than\nTable 1.

One\nintervention and three control schools in the original cohort of 40 schools were lower schools (i.e., took pupils up to age 9) during the 3-year period\nwhen the average KS2 English SATs were calculated for this study so we do not have results for the specified time frame. During the posttest period, this\nwas one intervention and two control schools.\ncOne intervention and two control schools were lower schools at the beginning of the study, so enrollment figures, percentage of SEN pupils at School\nAction or School Action Plus, and overall absence data were not available from the published Performance Tables.\ndA pupil identified by the teacher as having special educational needs with additional resources and interventions to address those provided within the\nschool.\neAs with School Action (detailed above) but where additional advice or support is provided by outside specialists.\n6 SAGE Open\nwould be needed in individual-level analysis, but individual-\nlevel tests of statistical significance, which assume that the\noutcome for an individual is independent of that for any\nother student, are inappropriate for evaluations of school-\nlevel interventions.\nUsing HLM, one may simultaneously model both stu-\ndent- and school-level sources of variability in the outcome\n(Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). Specifically, we developed\ntwo-level hierarchical models that nested students within\nschools. The fully specified Level 1, or within-school model,\nnested students within schools. The linear model for this\nlevel of the analysis is written as\nY r\nij j ij\n= +\n\n,\nwhich represents the summer posttest achievement for student\ni in school j regressed on the Level 1 residual variance, r\nij\n.\nAt Level 2 of the model, we estimated SFA treatment\neffects on the mean posttest achievement outcome in school\nj. We included a school-level covariate, the school mean\nBPVS pretest score, to help reduce the unexplained variance\nin the outcome and to improve the power and precision of\nour treatment effect estimates. The fully specified Level 2\nmodel is written as\n   \nu\n= + Mean BPVS Pretest + SFA +\n( ) ( ) ,\nwhere the mean posttest intercept for school j, 0j\nis regressed\non the school-level mean BPVS score, the SFA treatment\nindicator, plus a residual, u\n.\nResults\nEmpirical Analyses of Reading Achievement\nFor each of the achievement posttest outcomes, a series of\nmultilevel models were specified. The analyses for the\nWRMT subtests are shown in Table 2 and those for the\nYARC are shown in Table 3. These show a school-level sig-\nnificant effect on the WRMT Word Identification (Effect\np < .01). On the three YARC scales, effects were direction-\nally positive but not statistically significant, with effect sizes\nas follows: Rate (ES = +0.11, ns), Comprehension (ES =\ntested for the random effects of the BPVS pretest at the stu-\ndent level across schools but found no significant effects.\nImplementation Observations\nObservations were designed to enable researchers to assess\nthe fidelity with which the SFA program was being imple-\nmented and to determine whether critical components of the\nSFA instructional process were being implemented in control\nschools. They included factors relating to literacy instruc-\ntion, cooperative learning, and assessment. These observa-\ntions were in addition to the regular, routine visits by SFA\nadvisors. There were 19 items on the implementation check-\nlist in total: 14 related to teacher behaviors (e.g., \"Teacher\nmodels phonics skills correctly\") and 5 to pupil behaviors\n(e.g., \"Children read the texts fairly accurately, self-\ncorrecting if errors are made\"). Each item was rated on a\nscale from 0 (observed none of the time) to 3 (present virtu-\nally all of the time), with an option for \"Unobserved.\" During\nwere visited once and 8 were visited twice during the school\nyear. Nine out of 18 control schools were visited once each\nduring the school year. The visits were carried out by two\nresearchers who initially co-observed lessons at two schools\nto enhance the consistency of evaluator ratings.\nFor both the intervention and control schools, where pos-\nsible, observers attempted to observe more than one class or\nliteracy group within each school, covering a range of ability\nlevels within Year 2. At most SFA schools, this involved two\nTable 2.

Within SFA schools, teachers usually\ntaught groups of students from different year levels but all at\none reading level. Students changed classes at reading time\nto make this possible as the SFA model prescribes. In control\nschools, teachers generally taught several reading groups\nwithin the year-level class they taught all day.\nPhonics. In all the schools visited who had a phonics lesson\nobserved, researchers saw some form of instruction in syn-\nthetic phonics in use--teaching letter sounds and then blend-\ning these sounds together to read whole words. Letters and\nSounds (Department for Education and Skills, 2007) was the\nmost widely used system in control schools, although other\nprograms were also mentioned by teachers or recognized by\nobservers, including Jolly Phonics and Read Write Inc.\nCooperative learning.A key feature of the SFA program is\ncooperative learning. Partner work was observed in many\ncontrol as well as intervention schools. At its most limited,\nthis involved sharing of resources within pairs. At its most\nsophisticated, it involved partner reading--a strategy\nobserved in most SFA schools, whereby children work\ntogether and take turns reading and summarizing text. The\nmost popular form of partner work in both control and inter-\nvention schools involved partner talk, the sharing of ideas,\nformalized in the SFA schools by such strategies as \"Think-\nPair-Share.\" In most SFA schools and some control schools,\nthe partnerships were formally assigned by the teacher, who\ndirected children to work together in specific pairs.\nCooperative teaching strategies and pupil behaviors were\nmuch less frequently observed in control than SFA schools.\nFor instance, almost a half of SFA classes scored 3 (i.e.,\n\"present almost all the time\") on the rating \"Teacher has\npupils working in heterogeneous partners or teams\"\ncompared with only one instance in the control schools.\nAlmost a third of classes in SFA schools scored 3 on \"Pupils\ndisplay cooperative behaviors in group work,\" but no control\nclasses were rated 3. Although control classes might be orga-\nnized to sit in groups, or sometimes even perform tasks in\ngroups, cooperative learning behaviors were rare.\nSFA implementation fidelity. It is important to note that there\nwas variation in implementation of the SFA program among\nthe intervention schools. Project researchers rated the imple-\nmentation of the SFA Year 2 teachers on a scale of 0 to 3,\nwith 0 being \"No fidelity to the program or cooperative\nlearning in place\" and a score of 3 meaning \"materials and\nroutines are followed with fidelity and cooperative learning\nis embedded within the school culture.\" Given the nature of\nSFA, with its cross-class, cross-year reading classes grouped\nby reading level, this is an important indicator of overall\nfidelity to the program. An average fidelity score was calcu-\nlated across reading classes within schools and, where more\nthan one visit was made, an average was then obtained across\nvisits. This resulted in an implementation fidelity score for\neach school on a scale of 0 to 3, with 0 being very weak\nimplementation fidelity and 3 being very high. Scores were\ncalculated at a school level because the nature of the SFA\nprogram means that children are likely to be moved through\na number of groups during the year. In most, although not all\ncases, implementation fidelity was very similar within any\none school.\nOf the 18 intervention schools, 10 schools received a rat-\ning of 3, 7 were rated 2, and 1 was rated 1. Where more than\none class was observed, scores have been averaged and\nrounded to the nearest whole number to enable comparison.\nA similar pattern of ratings was recorded by SFA advisors,\nwith the caveat that they are not directly comparable because\nthe advisors were rating SFA implementation throughout the\nschool whereas the research study focused on classes\nTable 3.

Additional issues elicited\nfrom informal interviews after observations in SFA schools\nincluded the following:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Lessons in some schools were reduced from 90 min\nper day, 5 days a week to less than 90 min a day and/\nor less than 5 days a week.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Other reading schemes were used within the class-\nroom within the designated literacy time in a few\nschools, thereby diluting the \"whole program\"\napproach advocated by SFA.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Sometimes the organization of the schools did not\nfacilitate the mixing of year groups within a school.\nThis latter point was compounded by the fact that the Year\n2 children were due to take the end of Key Stage 1 SATs dur-\ning the summer of 2011. This meant that sometimes the\nmixed year group approach advocated by SFA was not fol-\nlowed through at this stage because of the importance to\nschools of ensuring that children reached their required\n\"competences\" and the felt need to provide additional coach-\ning to Year 2 children who were less likely to meet those\nrequirements.\nSFA implementation outcomes. As indicated above, the major-\nity of the SFA schools had a medium or high implementation\nrating (17 schools). Additional analysis was therefore con-\nducted to compare the outcomes of these two groups. How-\never, no significant differences on both pre- and posttests\nwere found between the two groups.\nDiscussion\nThese results indicate educationally significant results for\nthe word-level reading assessments. There are positive effect\nsizes for all the assessments undertaken but only the effects\nfor the Word Identification and Word Attack subtests of the\nWRMT were statistically significant. There may have been\nadditional beneficial outcomes of the SFA program that we\ndid not measure. For example, one teacher indicated that\nbehavior tended to improve with the cooperative learning\nframework.\nThese outcomes of this evaluation of SFA are noteworthy\nfor several reasons. First, we were able to obtain the coopera-\ntion of a sufficient number of SFA and control schools to\nprovide an acceptable level of statistical power to detect\nschool-level effects within a multilevel model framework.\nSFA and control samples were reasonably well matched on a\nvariety of baseline characteristics, including many demo-\ngraphics and the BPVS pretest scores.\nSecond, there were positive effect sizes demonstrated for\nthe intervention schools on the beginning reading skills of\nword identification and decoding. Despite the strong focus\non phonics and decoding in English schools in recent years,\nSFA schools still greatly improved phonics and word-level\noutcomes in comparison with control schools.\nThird, the treatment fidelity and SFA implementation\nquality seemed reasonably good. There were similarities\nbetween the intervention and control schools in that they all\nwere using some form of synthetic phonics instruction, yet\ncooperative learning strategies were generally absent within\ncontrol schools.\nThe pattern of the Year 2 treatment effects appears to be\nconsistent with the previous U.S. studies, the SFA program\ntheory, and more general research and theory on the develop-\nment of young children's emergent literacy skills. We found\neffects of both statistical and educational significance. The\nlogic model behind the program is consistent with more gen-\neral theories of how young children develop as emergent\nreaders (Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998). Specifically, power-\nful decoding strategies and phonemic awareness, as stressed\nby the SFA Reception and Year 1 program, are key building\nblocks upon which children can develop a broader range of\nskills. However, comprehension results, although generally\npositive, were not statistically significant and this is worthy\nof further research. The largest cluster randomized evalua-\ntion of SFA in the United States, by Borman et al. (2007),\nfound positive effects of SFA in word-level outcomes in kin-\ndergarten and first grade, but comprehension effects did not\nappear until second and third grades. If the current evalua-\ntion were continued for another year, it might also find sig-\nnificant comprehension effects as Borman et al. (2007) did.\nThis aside, implementation was not perfect and this has\nalways been an issue with large-scale program evaluation.\nThere was variability in the level of implementation among\nSFA schools, although the majority of schools implemented\nthe program with at least moderate fidelity (10 out of 18).\nYet, they did not always do so for 90 min, 5 days a week.\nThis has implications for the transferability of programs\nfrom U.S. to U.K. settings and for the implementation of pro-\ngrams per se. Yet, the nature of the SFA program, involving\nas it does small group teaching, with these groups regularly\nchanging during the school year, presented its own research\nproblems.\nIn addition, although on many variables the imple-menta-\ntion and control schools demonstrated similar profiles, the\nschool matches were not ideal. Researchers were originally\nreliant on largely school-provided data but official data col-\nlected later, and not available at the time of initial recruit-\nment, suggests that on key variables, such as the proportion\nof children with EAL and the proportion in receipt of FSM,\nthe intervention and control schools had significant differ-\nences. This raises issues around the difficulties of recruiting\nschools that are already struggling to research studies. In\neach case, these differences did not favor the SFA schools,\nyet the fact that SFA schools had produced less favorable\nKS2 SATs results in English in the 3 years prior to starting\nthe SFA program than their matched control schools suggests\nTracey et al. 9\nthat they were more open to change than perhaps their simi-\nlarly performing peers at the time (i.e., not the control school\ngroup).\nThe findings of this experiment are important for policy\nand practice. Overall, this study responds to the doubts that\nhave been raised about the viability and appropriateness of\nlarge-scale evaluations in school settings (Cook & Payne,\n2002). As a large, lengthy field evaluation, rather than a rela-\ntively small, brief experiment, the results of this study have\nstrong external validity and relevance for policy and prac-\ntice. This project ties together two central themes of educa-\ntional research and policy: the scale-up, or replication, of\nschool-based interventions and the development of high-\nquality evidence of their causal effects. These outcomes have\nestablished that large-scale quasi-experiments involving rep-\nlicable school-based interventions are possible in the United\nKingdom, while highlighting some of the difficulties in\ndoing so, in particular with regard to recruitment and imple-\nmentation. It also suggests that there is a need for more ran-\ndomized controlled trials to assess the impact of programs\nwithin U.K. schools.\nAs government policies now provide schools in England\nmore autonomy and less top-down prescription, more schools\nshould have opportunities to choose among effective and\nreplicable interventions to provide educators with tools capa-\nble of narrowing the achievement gap between high and low\nincome populations. With the movement toward evidence-\nbased education in England, hopefully more programs such\nas SFA will be created, evaluated, and disseminated to help\nthem do so, alongside more research on the barriers to imple-\nmentation and collaboration with schools to provide more\neffective strategies to reduce inequalities.\nAuthors' Note\nAny opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not neces-\nsarily represent Bowland Trust positions or policies.\n"
