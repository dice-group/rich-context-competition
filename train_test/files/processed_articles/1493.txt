Carnemolla, BS\nBackground: A history of atopic respiratory conditions has been linked to an increased risk of stroke.\nWhat remains unclear is whether positive allergy skin testing is associated with an increased risk of\nstroke. The primary goal of this study was to determine whether positive allergy skin testing is associ-\nated with an increased risk of fatal stroke. A secondary goal is to determine whether having both posi-\ntive allergy skin testing and an atopic respiratory condition is associated with a particularly high risk of\nstroke death.\nMethods: An analysis was performed of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II Mor-\ntality Cohort.\nResults: Controlling for age, gender, race, alcohol use, smoking status, diabetes, hypertension, and\nbody mass index, patients with positive allergy skin testing had a hazard ratio for stroke mortality of\nlergy testing and an atopic respiratory condition had a hazard ratio for stroke mortality of 2.31 (95%\nConclusions: Individuals with both positive allergy skin testing and an atopic respiratory condition\nhave more than a 2-fold increased risk of fatal stroke. This novel risk factor has substantial implica-\ntions for a large segment of the population not previously considered at risk.

Progress has been made in identifying the risk\nfactors that are responsible for stroke, but our un-\nderstanding remains incomplete. Even the most\ncomplex multivariate models including major risk\nfactors such as smoking and diabetes as well as\nmore minor risk factors fail to fully predict who is\nat risk for stroke.3\nIn an effort to expand the understanding of\nstroke risk factors, researchers have investigated the\nlink between stroke and a number of chronic dis-\neases. One promising area of investigation has been\nresearch examining the relationship between atopic\nrespiratory conditions and stroke. Asthma, a disease\nstrongly tied to atopy, was associated with a 50%\nincrease in combined fatal and nonfatal stroke risk.4\nBuilding on the notion that atopy may be a risk\nfactor for stroke, we found that a history of physi-\ncian-diagnosed hay fever was associated with more\nthan a 70% increase in combined fatal and nonfatal\nstroke risk.5 Because hay fever may have some mis-\nclassification as an indicator of atopic sensitivity, it\nis unclear whether the relationship between atopic\nrespiratory conditions and stroke exists with a more\nsystematic measure of atopy such as allergy skin\ntesting. To clarify this issue, we examined the risk\nof stroke mortality in patients with positive allergy\nskin testing in a nationally representative cohort.\nWe then subdivided the group of patients with\npositive allergy skin testing into those with a his-\nThis article was externally peer reviewed.\nFrom the Department of Family Medicine, Medical Uni-\nversity of South Carolina, Charleston.\nthe Health Resources and Services Administration.\nConflict of interest: none declared.\nCorresponding author: Eric M.

The\nNHANES II was conducted in the United States\nnoninstitutionalized United States civilians, with an\nage range of 6 months to 74 years, recruited at 64\nsampling sites. The survey included a physical ex-\namination, numerous laboratory studies, allergy\nskin testing, and an extensive questionnaire about\nlifestyle, diet, and medical history. A thorough de-\nscription of the NHANES II survey and sampling\nprocedure has been described previously.6\nThe NHANES II Mortality Study was a pro-\nspective cohort study comprising 9252 adults be-\ntween the ages of 30 and 75 and done at the time of\nthe original NHANES II study.7 Deaths were cap-\ntured by linking information from the National\nDeath Index to matching personal identifiers in the\nNHANES II. Based on previous studies, more than\n90% of all deaths can be identified by using this\nmethod.8,9 In our study, we followed patients 45\nyears of age and older from 1976 through Decem-\nyounger than 45 years of age because the patho-\nphysiology of strokes in that population differs sig-\nnificantly from those older than age 45.

Those who did not report a history of\npositive allergy skin testing underwent allergy skin\ntesting and were included in the positive allergy\nskin testing group if they had a positive allergy\nresponse to one or more of the tested allergens.\nAllergy testing was performed using a traditional\n\"skin prick test\" administered in a sterile fashion\nwith a 25 gauge, 3/8-inch needle. The allergens\nTable 1.

We\nused the International Classification of Disease\ntality.\nControl Variables\nSeveral control variables have been identified as risk\nfactors for stroke mortality and thus may be potential\ncofounders of any relationship between positive al-\nlergy skin testing and stroke mortality.12\u00ad17 Control\nvariables in our study included age, sex, race, body\nmass index (body weight in kg/height in m2), hyper-\nlipidemia (defined as low-density lipoproteins 160\nmg/dL), diabetes, hypertension, and smoking. Age\nand body mass index were treated as continuous vari-\nables. Sex, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension,\nand smoking were treated as categorical variables.\nHyperlipidemia was defined as a low-density lipopro-\ntein level 160 mg/dL, and patients were categorized\nas either being hyperlipidemic or nonhyperlipidemic.\nDiabetes was determined by self-report and patients\nwere categorized as either diabetic or nondiabetic.\nHypertension and smoking were also categorized by\nself-report and patients were categorized as either\nhypertensive or normotensive and as either a current\nsmoker or current nonsmoker, respectively.\nAnalysis\nBecause of the complex sampling design of the\nNHANES II, we used the statistical packages\nSUDAAN (SUDAAN Statistical Software Center,\nResearch Triangle Park, NC) and SAS (SAS Inc.,\nCary, NC) to perform all analyses. We excluded\nparticipants with a history of stroke or coronary\nvascular disease because of their extremely high risk\nof death from recurrent stroke.17 We used 2 anal-\nysis to examine the bivariate relationships between\nparticipants with positive allergy skin testing and\nthose with negative allergy skin testing for each of\nthe categorical control variables. T tests were com-\nputed to examine the relationship between partici-\npants with positive allergy skin testing and those\nwith negative allergy skin testing for each of the\ncontinuous control variables. We used a Cox pro-\nportional hazards regression to model time to\nstroke mortality, adjusting for age only. We used\nage as a covariate (1) because the prevalence of\npositive allergy skin testing decreases with age and\n(2) because stroke prevalence increases with\nage.18,19 For example, in our current dataset, if we\n74, the incidence of stroke increases by more than\n850%, whereas the incidence of positive allergy\nskin testing decreases by 25%. Because of this re-\nlationship, if we fail to adjust for age we confound\nany relationship that may exist between positive\nallergy skin testing and stroke. After completing\nthe preliminary regression we performed a fully\nadjusted regression with age, sex, race, body mass\nindex, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and hyper-\nlipidemia as covariates. Because we were using a\nCox proportional hazards analysis, we conducted a\nSchoenfeld's test to determine whether the hazards\nwere proportional.20 After performing our primary\nanalysis examining the relationship between posi-\ntive allergy skin testing and risk of fatal stroke, we\nperformed 2 further survival analyses using the\nsame cohort. In the first analysis we performed a\nCox proportional hazards analysis comparing the\nrisk of fatal stroke for individuals with a reported\nhistory of respiratory atopy versus those without a\nhistory of respiratory atopy. We did not include\nallergy skin testing in this analysis. In the second\nanalysis we performed a Cox proportional hazards\nanalysis comparing the risk of fatal stroke for indi-\nviduals with both a history of respiratory atopy and\npositive allergy skin testing versus the remainder of\nthe cohort.\nResults\nOur cohort consisted of a unweighted sample of\nat baseline with a mean follow-up of 11.2 years and\nfollow-up, with 30 stroke deaths (weighted,\nallergy skin testing and 89 stroke deaths (weighted,\ntive allergy skin testing. Participants with positive\nallergy skin testing comprised 23.0% of the cohort.\nIn bivariate relationships, age and alcohol use were\nsignificantly different between the group with pos-\nitive allergy skin testing and the group with nega-\ntive allergy skin testing. Individuals with positive\nallergy skin testing were approximately 1 year\nyounger than those with negative allergy skin test-\ning and a higher percentage consumed alcohol\n(66.1% in the group with positive allergy skin test-\ning versus 59.0% in the group with negative allergy\nskin testing).\nIn a survival analysis adjusting for age, patients\nwith positive allergy skin testing had a hazard ratio\n2.25) versus those with negative allergy skin testing.\nA statistically significant relationship between pos-\nitive allergy testing and risk of stroke mortality was\nfound in a fully adjusted model (HR, 1.56; 95% CI,\nvariables (Table 2). In a survival analysis adjusting\nfor age, patients with a self-reported history of\nrespiratory atopy had an HR for stroke mortality of\nhistory of respiratory atopy. In a fully adjusted\nmodel, patients with a self-reported history of re-\nspiratory atopy had an HR for stroke mortality of\nconfounding variables (Table 2). In a survival anal-\nysis of individuals with both positive allergy skin\ntesting and a history of respiratory atopy, we found\n4.37) versus the remainder of the cohort, control-\nling for age. In a fully adjusted model, patients with\nboth positive allergy skin testing and a history of\nrespiratory atopy had an HR for stroke mortality of\nconfounding variables (Table 2).\nSchoenfeld testing indicated that the hazards\nwere proportional in all of the survival analyses that\nwere performed.\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study support previous works\nsuggesting a relationship between atopic respira-\ntory conditions and increased stroke risk. The cur-\nrent findings indicate that individuals with a history\nof both respiratory atopy and positive allergy skin\ntesting could have more than a 2-fold increased risk\nof fatal stroke. It is significant that individuals who\nhave both respiratory atopy and positive allergy\nskin testing are at much higher risk than those with\neither a history of respiratory atopy or positive\nallergy skin testing alone. Given that 23% of our\ncohort had positive allergy skin testing to one or\nmore common allergens, this study's findings may\nhave broad public health implications regarding\nwho may be at increased risk of stroke death.\nWhy might atopic respiratory conditions be a\nrisk factor for future stroke? One potential expla-\nnation is that atopic respiratory conditions could\nexacerbate sleep apnea by increasing airway resis-\ntance through swelling of the respiratory mucosa.21\nThis may be important because sleep apnea is a\nnoteworthy risk factor for stroke.22\nAnother possibility is that atopic respiratory\nconditions may increase the risk of stroke by in-\nTable 2.

We also suspect\nthat atopic respiratory conditions contribute to the\nso-called \"upper airway resistance syndrome,\"\nwhich can cause increased blood pressure during\nsleep in otherwise normotensive individuals.25 We\nbelieve it is important to emphasize that patients\ncan have upper airway resistance syndrome without\nmeeting the formal definition of sleep apnea.26\nDuring the past 2 decades, increasing evidence\nhas linked variations in the expression of inflamma-\ntory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10,\nand 5-lipoxygenase, to stroke.27\u00ad32 Atopic respira-\ntory conditions have also been linked to similar\nGiven these relationships, inflammation may be a\ncritical link between atopic respiratory conditions\nand stroke.\nThis study has a few limitations of note. Stroke\ndeath was determined using death certificates\nrather than through direct imaging; however, be-\ncause the attending physician is responsible for\ndeath certificate completion, he or she would pre-\nsumably know how the patient died. In addition,\nparticipants who reported a history of positive al-\nlergy skin testing did not undergo allergy skin test-\ning but were included in the allergy group. Because\nrepeating previously positive skin allergy testing\nwas not performed in the NHANES II, we in-\ncluded in the positive allergy skin testing group\nthose individuals who stated that they had a previ-\nous positive skin test despite the lack of indepen-\ndent confirmatory testing. It is possible that this\ncould overestimate the true number of individuals\nwith positive allergy skin testing, but because mis-\nrepresentation of a previous positive skin test is not\nlikely to be related to future stroke, we do not feel\nthat this would have influenced our results. In ad-\ndition, we hoped to investigate the relationship\nbetween allergies and stroke type (ischemic versus\nhemorrhagic), but we lacked sufficient power to\nperform this analysis. Finally, we were unable to\ndetermine how the use of antihistamines to treat\nrespiratory atopy may be related to the risk of\nstroke because the NHANES II did not clearly\ndelineate antihistamines from other allergy medi-\ncations such as decongestants.\nConclusions\nHaving both a history of respiratory atopy and\npositive allergy skin testing seems to be a risk factor\nfor stroke mortality. This relatively novel risk fac-\ntor has substantial implications for a large segment\nof the population not previously considered to be at\nrisk. We believe additional research is merited to\nfurther explore these findings and determine\nwhether allergy medications such as antihistamines\nmodify stroke risk in those with an atopic respira-\ntory condition.\nReferences\n2.
