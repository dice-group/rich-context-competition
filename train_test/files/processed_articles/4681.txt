Among primates, enhanced facial redness\nis associated with increased testosterone levels in male rhesus macaques (Rhodes et al.,\n1997) and with increased testosterone levels and dominance rank in male mandrills\n(Setchell and Dixson, 2001; Setchell et al., 2008). Male mandrills avoid conflict with other\nmales with brighter red faces, suggesting that redness also signals aggression and fighting\nability (Setchell and Wickings, 2005). Rhesus macaques of both sexes have been shown to\nattend and present preferentially to redder opposite sex faces (Waitt et al., 2003; Waitt,\nGerald, Little and Kraiselburd, 2006) and female mandrills prefer to mate with redder\nmales, irrespective of dominance rank (Setchell, 2005). Evidence that primate trichromatic\ncolor vision is optimized for perceiving changes in skin blood perfusion and oxygenation in\nconspecifics suggests that skin redness provides important cues to social and sexual status\nand changes in emotional state (Changizi, Zhang and Shimojo, 2006).\nIn humans too, facial skin redness is determined by perfusion with oxygenated\nblood, is sexually dimorphic (men are redder than women; Edwards and Duntley, 1939;\nFrost, 1994), and is strongly androgen-dependent in men (Edwards and Duntley, 1939;\nEdwards, Hamilton, Duntley and Hubert, 1941; Jeghers, 1944). Increased skin blood\nperfusion is associated with health: it is enhanced by physical training (Johnson, 1998) and\nreduced in patients with hypertension (Panza, Quyyimi, Brush and Epstein, 1990), diabetes\n(Charkoudian, 2003) and in smokers (Richardson 1987). Skin redness associated with\nincreased blood perfusion and oxygenation enhances the healthy appearance of faces, even\nin dark-skinned people (Stephen et al., 2009a).\nRed also has behavioral and psychological effects in humans, consistent with it\nbeing a signal of dominance and aggression: wearing red enhances the probability of\nwinning in individual combat sports (Barton and Hill, 2005; Hagemann, Strauss and\nGreenlees, Leyland, Thelwell and Filby, 2008), and virtual combats (Ilie, Ioan, Zagrean and\nMoldovan, 2008). Attributions of increased dominance are even made to abstract shapes\nwhen these are colored red rather than blue (Little and Hill, 2007). Subjects show physical\navoidance reactions to red stimuli, moving their body away from red-covered IQ test\nbooklets more than from green- or grey-covered booklets (Elliot, Maier, Binser, Friedman\nand Pekrun, 2009) and perform worse on cognitive tests after exposure to red than to other\ncolors (Elliot, Maier, Moller, Friedman and Meinhardt, 2007).\nAnger increases the blood flow to faces in Caucasian and Chinese samples\nevidence that the association of red with anger, danger, strength, activity and aggression is\nconsistent across cultural boundaries (Adams and Osgood, 1973; Hupka, Zaleski, Otto,\nReidl and Tarabrina, 1997). Hence, a wide range of evidence suggests that redness is\nassociated with testosterone, health, physical dominance and anger, and is perceived as\nsuch in a range of stimuli. We hypothesize therefore that increased skin redness will\nenhance the dominant and aggressive appearance of men's faces.\nWe also investigate the relationship between redness and attractiveness, since\nincreased blood coloration enhances apparent health (Stephen et al., 2009a), attractiveness\nis linked to apparent health (Jones, Little, Burt and Perrett, 2004) and previous research\nRedness in men's faces\nsuggests a role for blood color in attractiveness (Re, Whitehead, Xiao and Perrett, 2011).\nResearch on facial shape suggests that trade-offs exist between dominance or masculinity\nand attractiveness. Dominant face shape has been suggested as an honest signal of male\nquality (Mueller and Mazur, 1998), and might therefore be expected to be considered\nattractive by women. Indeed, military officers with more dominant facial features were\nfound to have more offspring if they also achieved high military rank (but did not have\nmore children if they remained low rank; Mueller and Mazur, 1998). Teenage boys with\nmore dominant faces report sexual activity at a younger age and report more copulation\nopportunities than those with less dominant faces (Mazur, Halpern and Udry, 1994). Men\ndisplaying more dominant behaviors are considered more attractive by women (Sadalla,\nKenrick and Vershure, 1987). Interestingly, images of male faces manipulated to appear as\nthough they have been more influenced by testosterone during puberty appear more\ndominant but not more attractive to women (Swaddle and Reierson, 2002). In many species\nfemales prefer less dominant males, possibly because dominance is associated with\naggression and low investment by males (Qvarnstrom and Forsgren, 1998). In humans,\nmasculine facial features are weakly associated with increased attractiveness (DeBruine et\nal., 2006), though this is subject to individual and menstrual cycle variation (DeBruine et\nal., 2009). In particular, female preferences shift towards less masculine faces during\nphases of the menstrual cycle when they are at low risk of conception. Recent theoretical\nwork has suggested that male masculinity may have evolved more in response to male-\nmale competition than to female choice (Puts, 2010). Puts (2010) points out that the high\ndegree of sexual dimorphism in muscle mass (similar to the dimorphism seen in gorillas;\nZihlman and MacFarland, 2000), and ability to control access to females predict that male-\nmale contest competition is more important in the evolution of masculine traits than female\nchoice. This prediction is supported by the finding that male sex-typicality on a number of\ntraits, including beard growth (Neave and Shields, 2008), masculine voice (Puts, Gaulin\nand Verdolini, 2006), masculine face (DeBruine et al., 2006) and brawny build (Frederick\nand Haselton, 2007), increase ratings of dominance more than they do attractiveness (Puts,\n2010). It should be noted that women are able to control mating to an extent, for example\nby extra-pair copulations, and consequently are predicted to favor males with healthy\nappearance (Puts, 2010), which is enhanced by a slight increase in redness caused by\nIn this study, we examine whether red skin coloration is, like facial shape, perceived\nas an indicator of dominance and attractiveness. We also test for an association of skin\nredness with aggressiveness, and predict a similar trade-off between attractiveness and\ndominance or aggression as has been found for facial shape. Based on the comparative,\nphysiological, behavioral and psychological evidence discussed above, we predict\nassociations between skin redness and perceived dominance, aggression and attractiveness.\nWe further predict that the association between redness and attractiveness will be limited\nby the negative implications of dominance and aggression, in a similar way to that found\nfor facial shape.\nRedness in men's faces\nMaterials and Methods\nThis work was approved by the Anthropology Department Ethics Committee,\nDurham University and UTREC at the University of St Andrews. All participants gave\nprior, informed consent in writing.\nFemale participants were allowed to manipulate the redness of the skin on color-\ncalibrated images of men's faces in order to maximize the aggressiveness, dominance and\nattractiveness of those faces, in separate trials.\nSkin portions of color-calibrated (Hong, Luo and Rhodes, 2001), male Caucasian\nfacial images were transformed (Burt and Perrett, 1995) along the CIELab a* (redness) axis\n(see Figure 1a). Female Caucasian participants were presented with facial images on a\ncalibrated CRT monitor, and were asked to manipulate their color to \"make the face as\naggressive as possible\", \"make the face as dominant as possible\" or \"make the face as\nattractive as possible\".\n(a) Photography. 21 male Caucasian participants (aged 18-22) were photographed,\nwithout skin make-up and with neutral expressions, in a booth painted Munsell N5 grey,\nilluminated with three Verivide F20 T12/D65 daylight simulation bulbs in high-frequency\nfixtures (Verivide, UK), to reduce the effects of flicker. The booth was located in a room\nwith no other lighting. A Munsell N5 painted board was placed over the shoulders and a\nGretagMacbeth Mini ColorChecker color chart was included in the frame. Images were\ncolor corrected after Stephen et al. (2009b).\nMatlab was used to calculate mean CIELab values across skin pixels for each face\nimage (defining initial CIELab face color), by converting RGB values to CIELab via the\nXYZ color space.\n(b) Image manipulation. Face-shaped masks were produced in Matlab, one representing\naverage face color +8 units of a*, and one representing average face color -8 units of a*.\nEach face image (n = 21) was manipulated by the difference in color between the two\nmasks (Burt and Perrett, 1995), producing thirteen images in equal steps from -16 to +16\nunits of a* from the original face color. Hair, eyes, clothing and background remained\nconstant (Figure 1a).\n(c) Experimentation. Participants were 45 Caucasian women (aged 18-25). Participants\nwere presented with the stimuli, one face at a time, in random order on a CRT monitor\n(color calibrated using a ColorVision Spyder 2Pro). A computer program allowed\nparticipants to manipulate the color of the facial skin along the CIELab a* (redness) color\naxis by moving the mouse horizontally across the screen. The starting point of the\ntransform was randomized and looped (so that holding the mouse cursor over the middle of\nthe screen did not always display the mid-point of the transform), and the direction of color\nchange (i.e. whether moving the mouse left increased and right decreased redness or vice\nversa) was randomized for each trial. They were asked to \"make the face as AGGRESSIVE\nas possible\", \"make the face as DOMINANT as possible\" or \"make the face as\nATTRACTIVE as possible\". Dominance, aggression and attractiveness were not defined\nfor the participants. Each participant saw each of the 21 faces once for each condition.\nTrials were grouped into blocks. For example, participants saw all aggressive trials in one\nRedness in men's faces\nblock. Face order within blocks was randomized and the order of the blocks themselves\nwas randomized.\n(d) Statistical Methods. Mean color changes applied to each face were calculated (by face\ndataset). One-sample t-tests (H0\n: no color change) were used to evaluate the overall color\nchanges. To test for the effects of initial face color on the amount of redness (a*) change\napplied to optimize aggressive, dominant or attractive appearance, Pearson's correlation\nwas used. To test for the difference between the trial conditions (aggression, dominance\nand attractiveness), general linear mixed modeling was performed (DV = redness change\napplied; fixed factor = trial condition; to control for variation between participants, subject\nID was included as a random factor). Tukey's HSD post-hoc tests were used to determine\nthe differences between the three conditions.\nFigure 1a: Untransformed face photograph and high and low endpoints of the redness (a*) transform. Figure\n1b: Amount of redness change applied (a* mean+SE) is greatest to optimize aggressive appearance (grey\nrhombi) is greater than for dominance (black squares) is greater than for attractiveness (white triangles).\nResults\nParticipants increased the redness of faces to optimize apparent aggression (a*\nThe redness change was negatively related to the initial redness of the faces for aggression,\ndominance and attractiveness, showing that more redness was added to faces initially low\nin red (Fig 1b, Table 1). Redness change (a*) was greater for initially lighter (higher L*)\nfaces, in the aggression and attractiveness trials, though these effects were weaker than the\neffects of initial face redness (a*).\nThe trial condition (aggression, dominance or attractiveness) affected the amount of\nthe most for aggression, then dominance and least for attractiveness. All differences are\nRedness in men's faces\nTable 1. Statistical summary of the correlation analyses relating initial face lightness (L*),\nredness (a*) and yellowness (b*) to redness change applied to optimize aggressive,\ndominant and attractive appearance.\nTrial condition\nColor dimension Aggression Dominance Attractiveness\nDiscussion\nWe have shown that increased redness (a*), while holding lightness (L*) and yellowness\n(b*) constant, enhances the appearance of dominance, aggression and attractiveness in\nmen's faces viewed by female participants. Participants increase redness more to maximize\naggressive than dominant appearance, and more to maximize dominant than attractive\nappearance.\nOur finding that apparent facial dominance and aggression are enhanced by\nincreased skin redness is consonant with non-human primate studies that show associations\nbetween facial skin redness and social dominance (e.g., Setchell and Dixson, 2001). It also\nsupports the explanation of color-related performance biases in humans that invokes an\nunconscious reaction associating red with dominance (Barton and Hill, 2005; Elliot et al.,\nWe find that facial skin redness enhances attractiveness, supporting the findings of\na forced choice study by Re et al. (2011), but very high levels of redness increase perceived\naggression to the detriment of attractiveness. These differences may reflect a trade-off\nbetween the benefits to females of choosing a healthy, dominant male and the costs of\nassociating with an aggressive partner. Redness has associations with anger, both in faces\n(Drummond and Quah, 2001) and in abstract word association tasks (Hupka et al., 1997).\nIn addition to health, dominance and aggression, facial redness is also associated with\nembarrassment. The fact that facial redness is associated with a range of social and\nemotional states does not mean that it is not associated with each individually; it need not\nbe the case that facial redness is associated with only one, or only a limited number of,\nsocial and emotional states.\nFacial redness is associated with high levels of testosterone and high dominance\nrank in non-human primates such as rhesus macaques (Rhodes et al., 1997) and mandrills\n(Setchell and Dixson, 2001). While dominance represents success in male-male\ncompetition, it is not always the case that female choice will favor the most dominant males\nmost masculine males (Perrett et al., 1998; reviewed in DeBruine et al., 2006). Indeed,\nrecent theoretical work has suggested that, in humans, male masculinity and sexual\ndimorphism may have evolved in response to male-male contest competition rather than in\nRedness in men's faces\nDominance, moreover, is likely to explain only a portion of variance in\nattractiveness, with factors such as symmetry (Gangestad, Thornhill and Yeo, 1994;\nGrammer and Thornhill, 1994; Mealey, Bridgstock and Townsend, 1999; Penton-Voak et\nplaying a role. Recent work has suggested that cues to current health, such as skin\ncarotenoid levels, impact more strongly on men's attractiveness than does masculinity\n(Scott, Pound, Stephen and Penton-Voak, 2010; Stephen et al., 2012). Given that recent\ntheoretical work suggests that male masculinity may have evolved more in response to\nselection from male-male competition than by female choice (Puts, 2010), further work\nexploring men's perception of the redness of other men's faces as aggressive and dominant\nwould be desirable.\nPhysiological flushing responses to anger have been found in Chinese and\nCaucasian samples (Drummond and Quah, 2001). It has also been shown that skin color\nimpacts similarly on perceptions of health in black African and Caucasian UK samples,\nwith participants choosing similar levels of skin redness and yellowness adjustment to\nenhance perceived attractiveness (Stephen et al., 2009a; Stephen, Coetzee and Perrett,\n2011). Affective attributions of red as strong and active have also been found to be\nconsistent across a number of cultures (Adams and Osgood, 1973), suggesting that our\nresults may generalize across cultures. Whilst the role of cultural influences in facilitating\nresponses to red needs to be more fully investigated, such influences are not necessarily\nalternatives to a biological interpretation, but may interact with them. For example, the use\nof red as a warning signal in many contexts may itself reflect a predisposition as well as\nserving to reinforce that predisposition. Further cross-cultural work should therefore\nexamine impacts of skin redness on perceptions of aggression, dominance and\nattractiveness in different cultures.\n"
