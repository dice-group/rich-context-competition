Once people miss an\nopportunity to recover, they take a long time to get back\ninto society. However, some people will avoid going to a\nclinic to see a psychologist because of the stigma associ-\nated with these illnesses, and sometimes their condition has\nbecome rather severe by the time they get to the clinic.\nTherefore, preventive interventions and self-management\nare important for addressing these problems. Self-\nmanagement is based on operant conditioning, which aims\nto relieve stress people are incurring by rewarding them for\nactions they take to improve their condition. There is also a\ntechnique known as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),\nwhich is a proven method for recovering from depression\nIntegrating self-management and CBT enables patients to\ndeal with their disease on a daily basis at low cost.\nOne of the goals of CBT is to enable people to regulate\ntheir behavior. The idea behind this form of therapy is to\nenable patients to activate and/or deactivate their actions,\nthat is, their behavior. A fundamental factor in behavioral\nactivation is getting people to continuously do things that\nwill bring better results to them. It aims to help them\nincrease their activities with positive reinforcement rather\nthan decrease their activities with negative reinforcement.\nHowever, simply helping people to increase their activities\nwill not solve the problem. For people who have difficulty\nin activating their behavior or are too active, it is better to\nsupport them in a gentler manner by, for example, encour-\naging them to try small tasks or take short rest periods. This\nis the key idea behind behavioral regulation.\nComputerized cognitive behavioral therapy\nMany researchers have confirmed evidence of the effect of\ncomputerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CCBT), and it\nis used in treating several mental diseases (Bardram et al.,\nDesigning behavioral self-regulation\napplication for preventive personal\nmental healthcare\nMari Hirano1,2, Kanako Ogura1, Mizuho Kitahara1,3,\nDaisuke Sakamoto1,4 and Haruhiko Shimoyama1\n Keywords\nbehavioral self-regulation, cognitive behavioral therapy, computerized cognitive behavioral therapy, mental healthcare,\nself-monitoring\n1The University of Tokyo, Japan\n2Tokyo Kasei University, Japan\n3Intage Technosphere Inc., Japan\n4Hokkaido University, Japan\nCorresponding author:\nMari Hirano, Faculty of Humanities, Tokyo Kasei University, 1-18-1\nEmail: hiranomarih@gmail.com\nIntervention Study\n2 Health Psychology Open \neffective way to improve the state of mind of those with\nmild to moderate depression, dysphoria, and anxiety disor-\nfor Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United\nKingdom recommends CCBT for these mental illnesses. In\nrecent years, many uses of CCBT that utilize more conveni-\nent mobile applications have been developed (e.g. Birney\ntinuous extensions of target-specific programs to address\nillnesses such as eating disorders (Nitsch et al., 2016),\nsocial anxiety disorders (Miloff et al., 2015), posttraumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD) (Kuhn et al., 2014), or fibromyalgia\n(De la Vega et al., 2016). Gamification of clinical tech-\nniques such as attention-bias modification training (Dennis\nand O'Toole, 2014) has also been developed, and the pos-\nsibilities that various treatment methods show have been\nexpanded. However, using these methods for treatment\nposes various risks. These risks have been discussed, and\nsummaries of the ethical issues they involve have been\nSelf-monitoring applications\nMatthews et al. reported that a self-monitoring method on a\nmobile phone was more effective than the paper-based meth-\nods that have been reported, and that it helped users to under-\nstand self-awareness (Matthews and Doherty, 2011). Other\napproaches have been reported, such as a real-time monitor-\ning application for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\n(ADHD) children when symptoms appear (Gringras et al.,\n2006), and monitoring symptoms of bipolar disorders that\nhave been shown to be effective compared to the paper-based\napproach (Bauer et al., 2006). As for self-assessment and\nscreening, there are specialized applications for bipolar disor-\ntal illness including depression and anxiety disorder (Donker\net al., 2009), behavioral problems of young men (Diamond\nApplications for patients with major depressive disor-\nders, bipolar disorders, and schizophrenia use voice-based\ninput and graphs to display the data to reduce the monitor-\ning workload for self-assessment (Chinman et al., 2007).\nRecently, possibilities have been examined for effectively\nusing wearable systems for self-monitoring (Lanata et al.,\nBehavioral regulation applications\nApplications for behavioral activation have been developed\nmainly in the context of physical health promotion (Payne\net al., 2015). In such circumstances, MONARCA is one of\nthe famous self-monitoring applications for psychological\ntreatment, but it addresses behavioral activation (Bardram\net al., 2012). \"BeWell\" aims to activate behavior by graphi-\ncally showing physical exertion feedback to the user, for\nsuch factors as sleeping and physical conditions (Lane\net al., 2011). There are other applications that automati-\ncally correct physical exertion data of depressed patients\nfrom a mobile phone and give feedback to activate behav-\nior (Burns et al., 2011). These applications use games to\nencourage users to do such things such as raising a virtual\npet or take long walks (Lin et al., 2006) or eat healthily\nand regularly (Pollak et al., 2010). One application that\nhas been reported is the \"Positive Activity Jackpot,\"\nwhich helps depressed people to become more activated\nby scheduling pleasant events they can participate in and\nusing augmented reality technology (Edwards-Stewart,\n2012). These applications and services encourage behav-\nioral activation and regulation. When they are used, how-\never, it is important to not only activate behavior but also\nto manage the behavior quantity and quality by adjusting\nthe user's physical and mental conditions. For example,\nwhen users overexert themselves (i.e. by becoming too\nactivated), behavior deactivation is preferable to behavior\nactivation. This suggests there is a real need for a system\nthat has the capability to understand users' physical and\nmental conditions by self-monitoring them and giving\nthem feedback with which they can regulate their\nbehavior.\nThis research work has mainly focused on supporting\npatients and clinician interaction; they assumed that system\nusers were ill and needed to visit a clinic. On the other\nhand, prevention is also an important issue to be addressed\nin mental healthcare (Cuijpers et al., 2005). We therefore\nfocused on personal mental healthcare, assuming that our\nsystem's users would be not only people who were men-\ntally ill but also people who were in good mental health. We\nwanted our system to enable users to use it anytime and\nanywhere--at their home, office, or wherever--to check\ntheir mental health. We also wanted it to be personal, that\nis, one they could use on the web with the device of their\npreference (personal computer, mobile device, etc.).\nIn accordance with our objectives, we here present the\npersonal mental healthcare application we propose, which\nwe call \"SABORI\" (self-monitoring application for behav-\nioral observation and regulation by interaction), which inte-\ngrates self-monitoring and behavioral self-regulation. This\narticle discusses the possibilities for applying it to people\nfor whom field trials have not motivated their interest in\nmental healthcare and further developing it for preventive\nmental health applications.\nMaterials and methods\nWe conducted a field trial to understand how the applica-\ntion supports people to prevent them from incurring men-\ntal illness and how well its interactive design works. Note\nthat this field trial was performed under close supervision\nby clinical psychologists and that it received ethical\nHirano et al. 3\npermission.1 Participants were told that they could stop\nusing the application anytime if they wanted.\nParticipants\nWe used an open participation process, in which we\nrecruited participants through our website, paper flyers, and\nemails. In total, 98 volunteers participated in the field trial,\noffice workers and 31 were university students. None of\nthem had any prior associations or experience with our lab,\ngroup, or project. They used the SABORI application on\ntheir personal computer and whatever mobile device they\nhad (e.g. a smartphone).\nBefore starting the trial, each participant was asked to\nanswer a Kessler Psychological Distress Scale question-\na simple 10-item screening scale for psychological distress\n(range: 10\u00ad50). We performed this non-mandatory test\nbefore (pre-test) and after (post-test) the trial to investigate\nthe improvement in the psychological state that had been\nobtained with the application. The obtained results showed\nthat 83 of the participants answered the questionnaire\nbefore the trial (pre-test), and that 23 of them (28%) were\nrecognized as having mild depression (threshold score is 25\nin K10), but the others were in good health. For quantitative\nanalysis, we mainly analyzed the following: (1) the mood\nscore that was collected by the self-monitoring and (2) the\nK10 score before and 30days after the trial. For qualitative\nanalysis, we asked participants to answer a free-form ques-\ntionnaire on-site or online; 29 of them answered it. The\nquestionnaire items were about the participants' impres-\nsions of the application, its points they had found useful or\nnot useful, its points they had enjoyed, and its functions\nthey preferred.\nSABORI system\nAll the feedback, suggestions, interfaces, interactions, and\ntokens for the application (including gamification function-\nality) were designed by psychotherapists who had com-\npleted CBT training. This application was created for\nJapanese; all figures in this article include Japanese text\nwith English captions. The application was deployed on a\nweb server, and it was itself a web application. The users\nused it on whatever device they preferred, such as a per-\nsonal computer or a mobile device. The application was\nimplemented by adopting a responsive method to display\nthe appropriate design on various devices.\nSelf-monitoring (morning).We designed two questionnaires\nto determine the user's psychological state; they were used\nfor self-monitoring (Figure 1). The first questionnaire was\nfor the mood score, which comprised three items: (1)\ndepressed feeling, represented on the \"depressed--cheer-\nful\" axis, (2) anxious feeling, represented on the \"anx-\nious--relaxed\" axis, and (3) frantic feeling, represented on\nthe \"angry--calm\" axis. Each axis has a 0\u00ad100 point scale,\nand the mood score sum (maximum 300) was used for the\nanalysis of the field trial.\nThe second questionnaire aimed to collect self-monitor-\ning data focusing on \"busyness, physical condition, and\nmental condition.\" This 14-item questionnaire was used for\ngiving feedback and suggestions and was only displayed in\nthe morning (Figure 1, left). For a good starting point, the\nfirst item was about the weather condition. The details of\nthe other 13 items were as follows: (1) five items about\nbusyness (Yes/No) (e.g. \"Do you have some plans today?\"),\n(2) five items about physical condition (Yes/So-so/No)\n(e.g. \"Did you sleep well?\"), and (3) three items about men-\ntal condition (Yes/So-so/No) (e.g. \"Are you thinking posi-\ntively?\"). Since answering the same questions every day is\nboring for the user, there were variations (having the same\nmeaning) for each item. The application selected one of the\nvariations randomly.\nFeedback and suggestions. On the basis of the self-moni-\ntoring data collected in the morning, the application gave\nfeedback and suggestions. Usually, the feedback and sug-\ngestions given by a computer program are non-individual-\nized; all users get the same tasks many times. However,\nfeedback and suggestions for behavioral regulation should\nbe different because they are based on the users' mental\nstate, so the application needs to have functionality to\ngive feedback/suggestions on a case-by-case basis. In a\nface-to-face interview, a therapist is able to give appropri-\nate suggestions by talking with the patient individually.\nHowever, our application is able to present variations in\nfeedback/suggestions by analyzing the results obtained in\nself-monitoring.\nFor suggestions, we first listed four types for behavioral\nregulation (Table 1). The application selected two of them\nusing the weighting of the scores for busyness, physical\ncondition, and mental condition. There were three weight-\ning levels for the physical and mental conditions (good,\nFigure 1. Self-monitoring interface.\n4 Health Psychology Open \nmoderate, and bad) and there were nine patterns for combi-\nnations of them (Table 2). Additionally, the busyness score\nhad two levels (heavy and light), so there were 18 patterns\nin total. Each pattern had three suggested actions, so the\napplication had 54 suggested actions in total.\nAfter users got the feedback comment based on the anal-\nysis of the self-monitoring results (e.g. \"You need a rest\ntoday.\"), then the application selected two of the three\nactions that are considered as appropriate patterns for users.\nFinally, the user chose one action as that suggested for the\nday from the presented actions.\nSelf-monitoring (evening).When the user logged into the\napplication in the evening, a different interface was dis-\nplayed if the user had completed the self-monitoring in the\nmorning. At this time, the virtual agent in the kimono first\nasked the user whether he or she had completed the sug-\ngested action. There were three answer options: (1) \"Yes,\"\n(2) \"Only partially,\" and (3) \"No.\" Once users had selected\nan option, a reward item was given to them. Finally, the\nusers were asked to work out their mood score using the\nsame questionnaire that was used in the morning.\nReview. We designed a couple of graphs to show self-mon-\nitoring data. Figure 2 shows an example graph of the appli-\ncation. The graph on the left represents the three elements\nof the mood score, and that on the right shows the busyness\nand physical conditions. We used six graphs to show mood\nscore, busyness, and physical condition (three graphs) in a\nweek and a month view (two types). The highest and lowest\nscores of each condition were highlighted to support the\nuser to understand self-awareness.\nResults\nUsage frequency\nWe analyzed the 30-day login history, which started from\nthe first login day of the user. The average number of logins\nwas 9.35 times and the median was 5 times. During the\nA total of 27 participants logged into the application only\nonce. The average number of logins was 12.52 times\n(excluding participants who logged in only once). By look-\ning at the login interval (the number of days between two\nconsecutive logins, one being the minimum), we analyzed\nparticipants who were logged in at least two times, and the\naverage was 2.50days. This means that not the long login\ninterval but the dropout causes the low frequency of login\ntimes.\nCompletion rate of suggested action\nNext, we analyzed the collected data to ascertain how\nmany suggested actions had been completed in the trial.\nThere were 797 time\u00adday data sets for the 73 participants\nwho reported both mood scores in the morning/evening\nand whether they had completed the suggested actions. We\nprepared 54 actions for the suggestions, but two actions\nwere never presented to the participants. Among the 52\nactions for whom the actions had been presented at least\nonce, 4 had never been chosen by the participants, so 48 of\nthem were included in the analysis. First, we calculated the\ncompletion rate (completed times/presented times). The\noverall completion rate was sufficiently high, the average\nTable 1.

On the\nother hand, there were six actions with a completion rate of\n40percent or less. Next, we calculated the completion rate\nfor individuals. The overall completion rate was suffi-\nciently high as well; 57 of the participants completed\npercent or more of the actions, and the median was\nLooking at the suggestion distribution types, we found\nthat though the deactivate action (DA) was frequently\nselected, the other suggestions were selected nearly as\noften. These included suggestions for improving heath both\n\"mentally and physically\" and suggestions pertaining to the\nuse of \"activating and deactivating action\" functions. These\nindicate that participants activated and deactivated actions\non the same basis, and that the application well guided\nthem with respect to their behavior.\nMood improvement by completing suggested\naction\nFirst, we calculated the differences in mood scores between\nmorning and evening for each set of 797 time\u00adday data. We\nthen averaged the different scores for individuals who had\ncompleted the action and those who had not. For the former\ncase, the mood score increased daily, the average change\n=\ncase, the mood score decreased, and the average was -2.8\n=\n23.2). We analyzed the relationship\nbetween doing the suggested action and mood improve-\nment. We used HLM 7.01 (http://www.ssicentral.com/\nhlm/) and the hierarchical linear model for this analysis\n(details are presented in Appendix 1). The results showed\nthat the estimate of the mood improvement difference\nbetween a completed case and a not completed case was\n13.4 points, and the difference was significant (standard\nbled us to deduce that the user's mood in the evening was\nimproved as a result of doing the action suggested in the\nmorning.\nMood improvement after 30-day trial\nTo consider the long-term changes in mood associated with\nusing the application continuously, we first compared the\nK10 scores obtained in the pre-test with those obtained in\nthe post-test. We received both pre- and post-test K10 data\nfrom 31 participants. Table 4 compares the results obtained\nfrom participants who took both tests and those who only\ntook the pre-test. There was a significant difference in the\nnumber of logins between the two groups, so caution should\nbe taken when interpreting the results.\nIn the K10 questionnaire, a lower score is better and rep-\nresents mental well-being; if the participant's mental health\nimproves, the score will decrease. We conducted an analysis\nincluding participants who only took the pre-test and logged\ninto the application at least two times. In this test, we consid-\nered only 67 participants for purposes of accuracy. In this\nsituation, hierarchical linear models (Appendix 1) can be\nused to include the data from participants who did not take\nthe post-test. As a result, we were able to confirm that there\nresults suggest that the mental state of participants tended to\nget better the longer they used the application continuously.\nWe also found that a correlation occurred between the\nParticipants with a high K10 score at the pre-test tended to\nshow good improvement. Finally, we analyzed the mood\nimprovement in individual participants. The participants\nfor this analysis were those who took both the pre- and\npost-tests, so this was a within-subject design analysis.\nThere were two groups for the analysis; one was a group of\nparticipants who were recognized as having mild depres-\nresults showed that the average score of the depressed\nhand, we found no significant differences between the\nresults of the pre- and post-test in the non-depression group\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this study was to obtain knowledge that will\nenable further development to be pursued on preventive\nmental healthcare application through field trials of the\nSABORI system. We will discuss these points below.\nFigure 2. Graph representation in weekly style.\nTable 3. Types of suggestion and completion rate.\nType No. selected Completion\nrate (%)\n6 Health Psychology Open \nHere, we will provide a brief summary of the field trial\nresults. The participants used the application frequently and\ncompleted the suggested actions at a sufficiently high rate.\nTheir mood scores significantly improved if they carried\nout the suggested actions. The K10 scores of the depression\ngroup significantly improved after using our application for\n30days. Judging from the overall results obtained, we feel\nthat our application has very good possibilities to make sig-\nnificant contributions to managing personal mental health\nmanagement even though we did not compare it with any\ncontrol groups.\nMood improvement\nThe results we obtained that suggested the users'mood was\nimproved when they performed the actions suggested\nallowed us to deduce that our behavioral self-regulation\nsystem was able to at least to a certain degree help users to\nimprove their state of mind.\nIn comparing the K10 scores, we got for the participants\nbetween the pre- and post-tests, a period of time that lasted\ndays, and we found that there was no significant\nimprovement for the people in the non-depression group.\nThe post-test results we obtained for them were signifi-\ncantly lower than the pre-test results we obtained for the\ndepression group. In this trial, however, we did not prepare\nany control group. Thus, we cannot deny the possibility that\nparticipants had recovered naturally. Ideally, a follow-up\nstudy should be performed on the incidence of mental dis-\nease to strictly verify the preventive effect.\nUtilization\nOne of the biggest issues in CCBT personal mental health-\ncare application is the dropout rate.Asurvey by Kaltenthaler\npercent of participants drop out\nduring the session (Kaltenthaler et al., 2008). According to\nextensive meta-analysis, only 17\npercent of users com-\npleted all CCBT treatment modules (Karyotaki et al., 2015).\nParticipants dropped out due to multiple factors, for exam-\nple, they felt that they could not be rewarded sufficiently or\nthey felt clinicians would not recommend them as use\ncases. In any case, the CCBT dropout rate was higher than\nthat of face-to-face psychological therapy. In our work, we\napplication only once, which is in the range of the usual\nCCBT dropout rate. This was not a bad result and in fact\nwas slightly higher than we had expected. As mentioned\nbeforehand, in face-to-face therapy therapeutic alliance\nhelps to maintain adherence to treatment (Lambert, 1992).\nIt has also been confirmed that a therapeutic alliance was\nformed between people and an embodied conversational\nagent (Bickmore et al., 2010). Such an alliance could have\nbeen formed in the SABORI system between a user and a\nvirtual agent in the same way as had been reported in previ-\nous work.\nThe SABORI application targets people who are not\nmotivated by mental healthcare because the latter aims to\nprevent them from becoming victims of depression or anxi-\nety. Therefore, it is difficult to compare the dropout rate in\nthis study with other therapeutic applications. The thera-\npeutic applications that have been described need high\nusage frequency to provide sufficient intervention; in con-\ntrast, our approach does not necessarily need high usage\nfrequency. At this point, we cannot discuss whether the uti-\nlization rates we obtained in this study were sufficiently\nhigh by comparing them with those obtained in previous\nresearch. This is because there have been few studies on\npreventive mental health application, and thus, it is neces-\nsary to take long-term considerations into account.\nLimitations and further problems\nSince we did not prepare any control groups, we were not\nable to confirm the effects produced when the user did not\nuse our application. Our findings were as follows: (1) the\nmental condition of depressed users was improved after the\n30-day trial and (2) the mental condition of users who were\nrecognized as being well by the pre-test was stable after the\n30-day trial. The results suggested that the application has\nvalid possibilities for being able to help regulate mildly\ndepressive moods, but that it needs more trials and analysis\nto validate the validity of its concept. By the same token, we\ndid not analyze users who did not start to use the application\nand why they did not choose to do so. Neither did we study\nhow many and what types of users would like to use it con-\ntinuously. Although we used an open participation process,\nthere were 27 users who logged into the application only\nTable 4. K10 results (Welch's method).\nWithout post-test With post-test p-value\nSD: standard deviation.\nHirano et al. 7\nonce. This indicates that we need to conduct a study on how\nwe can make the application suitable for public use using it\non a widespread basis.\nThe application did not compel participants to complete\nthe suggested actions. Furthermore, since it was based on\nthe participants' decision on whether or not they would try\nto perform the suggested action, confounding variables\nmight be the result. For example, they might try to perform\nthe suggested action if they thought their mood would be\nimproved. Further trials and analysis will be necessary to\nclarify these points. It will also be necessary to focus on\ndata that were missing in the post-test. Almost all the par-\nticipants who did not take the post-test stopped using the\napplication after less than 30\ndays. The low number of\nusage cases reported suggests the strong possibility that the\nusers' mood was not improved as much as it would have\nbeen if they had taken a longtime use test. However, this\napplication did not aim to provide a treatment environment;\nit aimed to give users an opportunity to execute self-man-\nagement. It is natural that when users dropped out early, it\nwas because they did not want to continue using the appli-\ncation because we did not force them to use it. Finally, we\ndid not conduct any follow-ups. The effect of longtime\nusage beyond the 30-day trial needs to be evaluated before\nthe application can be made more widely available.\nConclusion\nWe presented a personal preventive mental healthcare\napplication that we call SABORI, which aimed to give\nusers the chance to manage their mental health by monitor-\ning their mental/physical conditions and regulating their\nbehavior by performing actions suggested by the applica-\ntion. The application, as well as a field trial conducted on\nand discussions about it, enabled us to obtain knowledge\nabout further development and problems on preventive\nmental healthcare application.\n"
