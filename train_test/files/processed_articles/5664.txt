Palliative\ncare, including symptom management, prolongs the survival\ntime of advanced NSCLC patients.6 Integrative treatment is\ngenerally used to increase the quality of life and alleviate\nsymptoms. However, in the treatment of advanced NSCLC,\nintegrative treatment is also able to enhance the immune sys-\ntem and prolong the survival time7,8 and can be used as main-\ntenance therapy.9 The American College of Chest Physicians\nhas published evidence-based clinical practice guidelines\n(3rd edition) for the diagnosis and management of lung can-\ncer in complementary and integrative medicine.10\nThe theories of traditional Korean medicine (KM) view\nhuman physiology as a network of interdependent organ\nsystems; thus, health is defined as a stable balance among\nthese networks where the metabolism of each organ system\nis in harmony with that of the other systems. KM therapies\nfocus on restoring homeostasis by synchronizing the net-\nworks of the metabolic pathways, thus creating favorable\nphysical environments in which the immune system can\nfunction properly. Recently, scientific evidence supporting\nthe efficacy of KM has been found in both preliminary and\nclinical studies on cancer care. Based on the results of those\nstudies, KM is useful in the management of cancer symp-\ntoms and can increase survival. In addition, KM treatment\ncan be effectively integrated into conventional therapy.11\nWheel Balance Cancer Therapy (WBCT), which is based\non KM, is an integrative cancer treatment program at the\nEast West Cancer Center (EWCC), which is one of the major\nintegrative cancer centers in Korea. Conventional modes of\ncancer treatments mostly target tumors whereas WBCT is an\nindirect approach that targets the physiological environment\nto induce cancer regression and tumor dormancy.\nWBCT can be administered either as inpatient or outpa-\ntient care. However, in this study, we needed to evaluate the\nimplementation of WBCT, so we investigated only patients\nwho had been treated on an inpatient basis. WBCT includes\nan anticancer diet, metabolism activation, anti-angiogenic\nand immune-enhancing herbal therapy, meditation, and\nexercise.12 For the anticancer diet, patients are given a per-\nsonal diet plan and are advised to consume green vegetables\nand fruit juice twice a day, which is served at the EWCC.\nFor metabolism activation, patients received acupuncture,\nmoxibustion, hydrotherapy (herbal steam baths), herbal hot\npack therapy, and pharmacopuncture (herbal acupuncture)\ntreatments. For antiangiogenic agents and immunotherapy,\nantiangiogenic and immune-system-stimulating agents,\nincluding anticancer capsules (HangAm-Plus [HAP])13-15\nand immune-enhancing capsules (MyunYuk-Plus\n[MYP]),16,17 are orally administered daily. HAP and MYP,\nwhich were developed at the EWCC and consist of herbal\nmedicines, have been used for about 20 years at the EWCC\nfor the treatment of patients with solid tumors. Under a phy-\nsician's supervision, patients are given advice on improving\nthe conditions of their minds and bodies through medita-\ntion, controlled breathing, yoga, and qi-gong. WBCT is\nusually, but not always, given concurrently with conven-\ntional therapy at the EWCC.\nAlthough WBCT is an integrative cancer intervention\nused at the EWCC of Daejeon University, Korea, no studies\nhave been done to identify its possible benefits as a sole\ntherapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the possi-\nbilities of using the WBCT of the EWCC as an alternative\napproach to the treatment of patients with advanced\nPatients and Methods\nEligibility and Chart Review\nThis study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee,\nOctober 3, 2013, patients were enrolled in the study at their\nfirst visit to the EWCC. The eligibility criteria were as fol-\nlows: (1) diagnosis of lung cancer; (2) treatment with only\nWBCT without ongoing conventional therapy in the hospi-\ntal; (3) presence of historically confirmed NSCLC; (4)\ntreatment with WBCT for more than 14 days; (5) Eastern\nCooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status\nDuring this period, 713 patients who had a diagnosis of\nlung cancer visited the EWCC. Because the purpose of this\nresearch was to investigate the effectiveness of WBCT alone,\nwithout any other treatment, 664 patients who underwent\nsimultaneous conventional therapy or who had no record con-\ncerning use of conventional therapy were excluded. Because\nthis research had NSCLC as its focus, patients with SCLC or\nno record of tumor classification were excluded.\nWBCT is a holistic total cancer care program that is\ncomposed of herbal medications, an anticancer diet, exer-\ncise, acupuncture, moxibustion, and so on. In our opinion,\nWBCT should be continued for at least 14 days if it is to\nhave an effect on the cancer patients, so we analyzed only\npatients who underwent WBCT without ongoing conven-\ntional therapy in the hospital for more than 14 days. Thus, 4\npatients who underwent WBCT for fewer than 14 days and\n2 patients who took no WBCT were excluded. We also\nexcluded 4 patients who had ECOG PS scores of 4 and one\npatient whose diagnosis date was uncertain. Finally, 33\npatients were included in this research (Figure 1).\nTreatment: Wheel Balance Cancer Therapy\nA physician completes a physical examination of each\npatient during treatment. A physical examination includes\nan electrocardiogram, laboratory studies (common blood\ncount and differential blood count, as well as liver and renal\nfunction tests), and radiology tests. Based on the results, all\npatients in the study received only WBCT in the hospital for\nWhen a patient visits the EWCC, an oncologist exam-\nines the patient and teaches him or her how to eat, exercise,\nand meditate; prescribes herbal medicine; and develops an\nintervention plan for that patient. A nurse and a specialist\nhelps the patient exercise and implement the intervention\nplan in the hospital.12 The details of the WBCT program are\npresented in Table 1.\nWe suggest that patients continue to be treated with WBCT\nafter hospital discharge and teach them to care for themselves\nthrough diet, excise, and meditation. Some continue to follow\nthe regimen, but for personal reasons, some do not. Although\nwe do not have data, one of the reasons for their not continuing\nwith the regimen outside the hospital might be an economic\none, that is, the lack of coverage by medical insurance. In this\nstudy, we investigated only inpatient WBCT.\nEvaluation and Statistical Analysis\nEvaluation and statistical analyses were performed as fol-\nlows: basic characteristics that were investigated included\ngender, age, ECOG PS, histopathology, whether the patient\nunderwent conventional treatment and if so, treatment dura-\ntherapy, cancer stage, and metastases. The overall survival\n(OS) rate and the hazard ratio (HR) were calculated from\nthe date of diagnosis to the date of death as recorded on the\nchart or the date of the last follow-up of a patient who was\nexpected to expire within a month according to an expert's\nopinion. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate the\nOS and the median OS according to age, ECOG PS, previ-\nous conventional treatment, WBCT treatment duration, and\nhistological tumor type. The analysis of the median survival\nwas performed by using PASW Statistics version 17.0\n(SPSS, Chicago, IL). For safety and assessment of toxicity,\nwe measured the liver function and the renal function\nthrough a blood test. Adverse events were assessed by using\nthe Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events\nResults\nPatient Characteristics\nIn total, of the 713 lung cancer patients who visited EWCC,\n33 met our eligibility criteria and were selected (Table 2).\nFigure 1. Patient eligibility.\npatients (24.2%) had received a surgical resection of the\ntumor, 18 (54.5%) patients had received prior chemother-\npatients (15.2%) never received any conventional treat-\nment. Histological examination confirmed an adenocarci-\nnoma in 24 patients (72.7%) and a squamous cell carcinoma\n(SCC) in 7 patients (21.2%). Tumors had metastasized to\nthe bone in 13 patients, the liver in 9 patients, the other lung\nin 8 patients, and the brain in 7 patients. Three patients had\nno metastasis in different organs, but because of their age\nand physical condition, they had not undergone conven-\ntional therapy.\nTreatment Outcomes\nWe investigated the survival rate according to age, duration\nof WBCT, history of prior chemotherapy, histopathology,\nand ECOG PS. For the analyses of the OS, we used the\nKaplan-Meier method,20 and correlations among the 2\ngroups were established by using the HR (Table 3).\nWe used the aforementioned method to determine statis-\ntically the median OS rate, the 1-year survival rate, and the\n2-year survival rate for all patients. The median survival of\nthe ends of years 1 and 2, respectively (Figure 2).\nWe analyzed the median OS rate according to the age of\nthe patient. For that, we divided the patients into 2 groups,\nyears of age or older (N = 18). The median OS rates of the\npatients in the former and the latter groups were 45.2 (95%\nrespectively. However, the survival outcomes of the 2\ngroups were not significantly different by the log-rank test\nWe also analyzed the median OS rate according to the\nduration of WBCT treatment for the 2 groups, one that\nunderwent WBCT for 14 days or longer but less than 28\ndays (N = 16) and the other that underwent WBCT for 28\ndays or longer (N = 17).

In the blood tests, we checked neutrophil\ncount, liver function, and renal function, including aspartate\naminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),\nalkaline phosphatase (ALP), -glutamyl transferase (GGT),\nand creatinine (Cr). We also evaluated the outcomes by\nThe adverse events encountered during this research are\nlisted in Table 4. The 4 patients who had elevated ALP also\nshowed bone metastases; however, during the stay in the\nhospital, the ALP levels of those patients did not increase\nfurther. Five patients had elevated GGT levels when they\nentered the hospital, and those levels did not increase fur-\nther while the patients remained hospitalized. One patient\nhad an elevated Cr level, which did not increase further\nwhile the patient remained hospitalized. No severe adverse\nevents were encountered.\nDiscussion\nRecently, various integrative cancer therapies have been\ntried. As WBCT is also one of those therapies, the effective-\nness of WBCT compared with conventional therapy for\nNSCLC patients,21 case reports on WBCT,12 and survival\noutcomes after WBCT intervention13-17 have been investi-\ngated. This research is the first to investigate and report the\nresults of the survival times of patients with advanced\nNSCLC who were treated only with WBCT without any\nother concurrent treatment.\nFor this research, we reviewed the records of 773 patients\nwho visited the EWCC during a 10-year period and selected\n33 patients who had advanced NSCLC and who had been\ntreated with WBCT without concurrent conventional ther-\napy. WBCT includes interventions that inhibit the growth of\ncancer cells, reduce the patient's stress, alleviate the\npatient's symptoms, and enhance the patient's body condi-\ntion. The combined effect of these interventions is thought\nto help the patients themselves to overcome the cancer.\nThus, WBCT is a total care system, not one treatment.\nMany studies have investigated individual complementary\ntreatment methods, but this study of WBCT investigated the\neffect of integrative therapy that included a variety of com-\nplementary and alternative treatments.\nTable 2.

Instead, such\npatients receive systemic therapy to prolong their survival\ntime. Two hospitals in the United Kingdom investigated\n(during a 2-year period) patients with advanced NSCLC\nwho had received multiple lines of systemic therapy. After\nthe first-line systemic therapy, 50 out of 110 patients\nreceived the second-line systemic therapy, of which 10\npatients received the third-line and 2 patients received the\nfourth-line systemic therapy.22 Thus, approximately 45%\nof the patients who received the first-line therapy subse-\nquently received therapy again because of recurrent or\nprogressive NSCLC.\nFigure 3.

In 2 different\nsecond-line therapy phase III studies of EGFR TKIs, the\nmedian OS rates with erlotinib treatment were 8.2 months30\nand 7.9 months.33 For anaplastic lymphoma kinase\u00adpositive\npatients, crizotinib is superior for chemotherapy.34 The\nmedian OS rate with crizotinib treatment was 20.3 months.35\nIn a phase II study of docetaxel plus bevacizumab combina-\ntion therapy, the median OS rate was 21.6 months.36 In a\nstudy of recurrent or advanced NSCLC patients who received\nthe triplet cisplatin, docetaxel, and irinotecan, the median OS\nrate was 14.3 months, but this combination has been proven\nto be too toxic to be used for patient treatment (Table 5).37\nIn a study conducted in China, treatment of advanced\nNSCLC in dementia patients with traditional Chinese medi-\ncine (TCM) alone was found to be superior to chemother-\napy alone in elevating the quality of life and prolonging\nsurvival time.38 Another study39 investigated the effect of\nanother TCM therapy, Guben Xiaoliu Capsule (GCX), in\ntreating patients with advanced NSCLC. In terms of the\nimmediate effect, the integrative group (chemotherapy plus\nGCX, 16.7%) was apparently superior to the TCM alone\ngroup (GCX only). However, the median OS rate was 15\nmonths in the TCM alone group, 12 months in the integra-\ntive group, and 9 months in the chemotherapy alone group.\nThe TCM alone group also showed reduced toxicity.\nFurthermore, in the United States, 193 patients with\ncolon cancer were treated at a clinic of Chinese medicine\nand by using conventional therapy. They were treated with\nherbal medicine as Chinese medicine or Pan-Asian medi-\ncine plus vitamins, both of which were combined with con-\nventional therapy and integrative treatment including diet\nand exercise. The combined treatment reduced the risk of\ndeath for patients with stage 4 colon cancer by 75% com-\npared with that for patients with stage 4 colon cancer treated\nwith conventional therapy alone.40\nTable 4.

Four of these patients were over 70\nyears of age, and 1 patient had a private reason for visiting\nthe EWCC. Thirteen patients could not receive additional\nconventional therapy because of an ECOG PS = 3. We\ntreated these advanced NSCLC patients with WBCT. The\nsurvival time was longer for patients under the age of 65\nthan it was for patients 65 years of age or older (HR = 1.156,\nP = .828) and for patients with ECOG PS 0 to 2 than it was\nThus, younger patients (<65 years of age) and patients with\nECOG PS 0 to 2 treated with WBCT had longer median OS\nthan the more elderly patients (65 years of age) and those\nwith ECOG PS = 3. However, the difference in the median\nOS rate according to age was not statistically significant.\nOf the 28 patients who had undergone prior chemother-\napy, 22 patients received more than the third line of therapy\n(maximum = seventh line). The chemotherapy regimens\nincluded cisplatin, docetaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine,\npaclitaxel, and carboplatin. The median OS rate of the\npatients who underwent conventional treatment including\nsystemic therapy was 45.2 months as compared with 3.9\nmonths for patients who had undergone no conventional\ntreatment. Of the 5 patients who had never undergone con-\nventional therapy, 4 patients had ECOG PS 3 and were over\n70 years of age; their general condition was poor, and treat-\nment was limited, so their survival time was shorter than\nthat of the other patients.\nIn the aforementioned studies, the median OS rate for\nchemotherapy with cytotoxic agents was 7.0 to 10.1 months.\nThe median OS with combination therapy with a target\nmonths with TCM alone or combination therapy with KM.\nThe median OS of patients with advanced NSCLC treated\nwith WBCT was 31.1 months, that is, longer than in the\npreviously mentioned cases.\nWBCT is an integrative cancer treatment program at the\nEWCC. While the exact metabolic pathway of WBCT has\nnot yet been identified, WBCT is thought to suppress can-\ncer by inhibiting angiogenesis and enhancing immunity13-17\nand to alleviate clinical symptoms by using KM therapy\nsuch as herbal medication, acupuncture, moxibustion, and\nso on. The median OS rate of patients who had undergone\nprior chemotherapy was 45.2 months; WBCT is thought to\nbe a tumor-dormancy-inducing therapy for patients who\nresist conventional regimens.41 Tumor dormancy is known\nto contribute to homeostatic controls, such as anti-\nangiogenesis, despite active proliferation and immuno-\nlogical conditions.42\nFor patients with advanced NSCLC, because of old age,\nthe adverse effects of chemotherapy, the lack of tolerance to\nchemotherapy regimens, the failure of many lines of ther-\napy, and private reasons, some cancer patients cannot\nundergo conventional systemic therapy. Cytotoxic therapy\nis important for reducing tumor size, but adverse events can\naffect the patients' condition and survival. In addition to\nsurvival, alleviating symptoms and elevating quality of life\nare important to patients.6,43 Our study suggests that WBCT\nmay be a good alternative therapeutic approach for treating\npatients with advanced NSCLC. Blood tests, including neu-\ntrophil count, liver function, and renal function, revealed no\nsevere adverse events.\nHowever, this study has several limitations. WBCT was\npracticed only at the EWCC and only for a limited time\ncer patients were selected, was too long, and the records\nthat were available had many limitations. Thus, many\npatients were excluded. Of the 713 patients with lung can-\ncer that were initially evaluated from this time period, only\n33 met the eligibility criteria and were included in this\nstudy. In addition, because of the retrospective observa-\ntional nature of this study, not all the dates of death were\nknown exactly, so some statistical analyses were based on\nthe last follow-up. Because the assumption that all censored\nsurvival times occurred immediately after their censoring\ntimes may not be reasonable, the survival estimates may be\nsomewhat biased. This study included patients who had\nbeen treated at various times over a 10-year period, during\nwhich time standard therapy and survival times changed for\nthe better. Thus, selecting patients with exactly the same\nconditions from all the patients in that 10-year period was\ndifficult. The records for the safety assessment were limited\nbecause of the long period of time from which patients were\nselected.\nIn the future, we need to investigate advanced conven-\ntional therapy and the impact of wealth. Conventional ther-\napy is improving, and newly developed agents are being\nadded. We will continue our analysis by comparing the\nresults achieved with WBCT against those achieved by using\nthe new agents. Furthermore, we know that the efficacy of\nWBCT treatment depends on the duration of the treatment\nand that some patients might not continue the treatment for\nfinancial reasons, such as the lack of money or the lack of\ncoverage by medical insurance. Thus, further studies address-\ning the impacts of economic status, medical insurance cover-\nage, the duration of treatment, and other biases are needed if\nthe efficacy of WBCT is to be firmly established.\nConclusion\nWhen advanced NSCLC patients were treated with WBCT,\nthis therapy significantly prolonged the survival time for\nthose who had previously undergone conventional treat-\nment and those who had ECOG PS <3. In the future, more\ncontrolled clinical trials with larger samples and with com-\nparisons to other treatments are needed.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\n1.
