These\nfindings have led some physicians to advocate a lower PSA\nthreshold of 2.5 ng/mL (4,5). A lower threshold inevitably means\nthat more men would be labeled as abnormal, have a prostate\nbiopsy, and be treated for prostate cancer. However, because clin-\nically insignificant disease (also known as pseudodisease) is a\nwell-known problem in prostate cancer (6), others are concerned\nthat a lower PSA threshold will lead to more overdiagnosis and\nhave urged caution in pursuing a diagnosis of prostate cancer in\nmen who have a PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL or lower (7).\nAlthough some data on the number of men who would be\nidentified as abnormal with various PSA thresholds are available\nfrom invitational studies of prostate cancer screening (8,9),\npopulation-based data on the distribution of PSA levels among\nmen in the United States have not been previously available.\nAffiliations of authors: VA Outcomes Group, Department of Veterans Affairs\nMedical Center, White River Junction, VT; Center for the Evaluative Clinical\nSciences, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH.\nCorrespondence to: H.

To put these numbers in\nperspective, we attempted to estimate the true burden of clini-\ncally important disease using the risk of prostate cancer death.\nMETHODS\nDistribution of PSA Levels\nData on the distribution of PSA levels for American men were\nobtained from the National Center for Health Statistics' most\nhave been conducted periodically since the 1970s, involve house-\nhold interviews and standardized medical examinations that\ninclude a variety of blood tests (10). The sampling design, data\ncollection methods, and weighting approach of NHANES have\ndata are based on a randomly selected, nationally representative\nsample of approximately 11000 people of all ages. This survey\nwas the first NHANES to include a PSA test for men aged 40\nyears or older as part of the medical examination.\nFigure 1 shows the selection process recommended by\nNHANES that we used to identify a representative PSA screen-\neligible population of men aged 40 years or older (23). Men\nwho had a history of prostate cancer were excluded, as were\nthose who had an examination or condition that might spuri-\nously elevate PSA level (i.e., prostate biopsy or cystoscopy dur-\ning the previous month, rectal examination during the previous\nweek, or current inflammation or infection of the prostate). We\nalso excluded men who had missing data for any of these eligi-\nbility criteria or for their PSA level. Our final sample included\n10-year Risk of Prostate Cancer Death\nData on the risk of prostate cancer death for American men\nwere obtained by using DevCan 5.2 software from the National\nCancer Institute (13). DevCan allows users to calculate the age-\nspecific chance of developing or dying from specific cancers for\na given time frame. These probabilities are based on cancer inci-\ndence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results\n(SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute, mortality data\nfrom the National Center for Health Statistics, and population\nestimates from the U.S. Bureau of the Census. We chose a\n10-year time frame to examine the risk of dying from prostate\ncancer because it is an intermediate interval (i.e., somewhere\nbetween an annual and a lifetime risk) during which annual\nscreening could plausibly affect clinical diagnosis and mortality.\nWe obtained the 10-year risk of death due to prostate cancer for\nmen at each year of age and then averaged these 10-year risks\nwithin each decade of life. For example, to obtain the 10-year\nrisk of death due to prostate cancer for men in their 40s, we first\ndetermined the 10-year risk of death for men at each year of age\nand so on) and then averaged the 10-year risks for men aged 40\nyears, men aged 41 years, and so on through men aged 49 years.\nBecause prostate cancer mortality has declined somewhat\nsince the introduction of PSA screening, it is possible that some\nof the decline is due to PSA screening itself. If so, 10-year risks\nbased on current mortality data would underestimate the 10-year\nrisks expected in the absence of screening. To avoid this problem,\n(i.e., before the advent of PSA screening). In addition, because\nthe risk data are based on the entire U.S. population (a small\nfraction of which already has clinically evident prostate cancer),\nthey may actually overstate the risk of death in the screen-eligible\npopulation reported here.\nStatistical Analysis\nage group, we first calculated the number and proportion of\nmen whose PSA level exceeded the following threshold values:\nWe then compared the number of men whose PSAlevel exceeded\neach of those threshold values with the number of men who were\nexpected to die of prostate cancer in the next 10 years without\nundergoing PSA testing.\nTo make national estimates from the NHANES sample, all\nanalyses incorporated the sampling variable (WTMEC2YR)\nwhich weights the sample up to the 2000 census as well as ac-\ncounting for differential probability of selection across subjects\nand nonresponse. The analyses also incorporated design effects\nvariables (variable names: SDMVPSU and SDMVSTRA) to\naccount for the survey's complex multistage sampling strategy\nwhen calculating 95% confidence intervals.

Among\nmen typically thought of as being of screening age (i.e., 40\u00ad69\nyears old), approximately 1.5 million would have a PSA level\ngreater than 4.0 ng/mL. Lowering the threshold to 2.5 ng/mL\nwould label an additional 1.8 million men as abnormal. For men\naged 70 years or older, the corresponding numbers are approxi-\nTable 1 also shows the number of men who are expected to\ndie from prostate cancer.

For each\nage group, even at the highest PSA threshold (i.e., 10 ng/mL),\nconsiderably more men are labeled abnormal than are expected\nto die from the disease in the next 10 years.\nFigure 3 and Table 2 illustrate the effect of PSA threshold on\nthe proportion of screen-eligible men who, if screened, would\nbe labeled as abnormal. For example, among men aged 50\u00ad59\nhave a PSA level greater than 4.0 ng/mL, and 1.6% have a PSA\nlevel greater than 10.0 ng/mL. To put these proportions in\ncontext, only 0.3% of men aged 50\u00ad59 years are expected to die\nfrom prostate cancer in the next 10 years. Among men aged\na PSA level greater than 10.0 ng/mL, but only 0.9% of men in\nthis age group are expected to die from prostate cancer in\nthe next 10 years. Almost half of men age 70 years or older\nhave a PSA level greater than 2.5 ng/mL, yet even in this\nage group, the 10-year risk of death from prostate cancer is less\nDISCUSSION\nThe PSA test was developed as an assay for an immunologic\nmarker that corresponded well with clinical stage in patients\nknown to have prostate cancer (14) and was subsequently found\nto be able to identify prostate cancer in men not known to have\nthe disease (15). However, PSA screening was widely adopted\nin the United States before there was any evidence of its effec-\ntiveness in reducing prostate cancer mortality. Although many\nadjustments have been suggested to define abnormal (e.g., PSA\ndensity, PSA velocity, age-specific PSA norms, free PSA) (16),\nthe PSA threshold used in the seminal article that advocated PSA\nscreening (15)--4.0 ng/mL--remains, for practical reasons, the\nstandard to define abnormal. This threshold value was selected\nnot on the basis of a randomized trial but arbitrarily (2).\nAlthough there is still no evidence that screening reduces pros-\ntate cancer mortality, there are now calls (4,5) to lower the PSA\nthreshold to 2.5 ng/mL simply because more prostate cancer\nwould be found.\nJust because a lower PSA threshold allows more prostate\ncancer to be detected does not mean it is a better threshold than\nthe current one. The logic behind the call for a PSA threshold\nTable 2.

But the same logic\ncould be extended to argue that any PSA level is abnormal and\nthat all men should have a prostate biopsy, given the finding that\nmore than 10% of those with PSA levels less than 2.5 ng/mL\nnonetheless have prostate cancer (1).\nThere are several limitations to our analysis. Our data are\nonly as good as our data sources. NHANES and DEVCAN are\namong the most credible nationally representative sources for in-\nformation on the distribution of laboratory tests and cancer mor-\ntality. Nevertheless, both have missing data and may not be\nperfect estimates. In addition, the PSA data from NHANES is\nlimited by the small number of younger men with elevated PSA\nlevels. To deal with this uncertainty, we provided confidence in-\ntervals in Table 2. Nevertheless, these data make it possible to\nexamine the likely effect of lowering the PSA threshold.\nIf all men were screened using the current threshold of\nbe labeled abnormal. Lowering the PSA threshold to 2.5 ng/mL\nwould more than double this number, such that approximately\nbeled abnormal and face negative consequences of the test\nresult (i.e., biopsy or a cycle of repeated testing and anxiety as\nlong as the uncertainty about whether or not they have prostate\ncancer persists).

If all of these men underwent radical prostatec-\nimpotent, approximately 40000 men would be expected to have\nmen would be expected to die from the procedure alone (18).\nThe problem is that although it is easy to diagnose more prostate\ncancer, it is not easy to know who has clinically important\ndisease.\nThe overdiagnosis of prostate cancer reflects the fact that the\ncellular abnormality that pathologists call prostate cancer is far\ntoo prevalent to be consistently clinically important. How much\nprostate cancer is found seems to be directly related to how hard\nit is looked for. Consider the prostate biopsy process: because\ngenerally there is no obvious lump to remove, urologists sample\ncells from different portions of the organ. Historically, six needle\nbiopsy samples were taken; now, many urologists are advocat-\ning taking 12 or more biopsy samples--noting that the more\nsamples that are taken, the more cancer is found (19). Some\nresearchers have even advocated the use of \"saturation biopsy\"\n(a procedure involving from 32 to 38 needle biopsy samples)\nbecause this procedure has demonstrated that microscopic can-\ncers can still be found in men who have had been cancer free on\nthree or more prior biopsy procedures (20). Furthermore, when\npathologists systematically searched the prostate glands removed\nfrom older men who were not known to have the disease, they\nfound that at least half had microscopic evidence of prostate\nIn the absence of data on the effectiveness of screening, we\nbelieve that it would be inappropriate to select the PSA thresh-\nold simply to maximize how much prostate cancer is found.\nThe choice of a threshold should be equally informed by how\nmany men would be drawn unnecessarily into the process of\nprostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. That is, the PSAthresh-\nold should be selected to target the number of men who are\nexpected to develop clinically important disease. In other words,\ngiven that the effectiveness of the PSA screening test is not\nknown, the threshold selected should not result in many more\nmen labeled abnormal than could conceivably benefit from\nearly detection.\nTo apply this principle, we considered the risk of prostate can-\ncer death over 10 years--a time period during which annual PSA\nscreening could plausibly affect mortality. Because more than\ntwo-thirds of men diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer in\nthe SEER data ultimately die of the disease (22), the risk of death\nalso captures most men who develop symptomatic metastatic\ndisease--a group of men who certainly warrant the label of hav-\ning \"clinically important\" disease. Using the 10-year risk of death\nas the standard for clinically important disease, we found that\nroughly 10 times more men had an abnormal PSA level using the\ncurrent PSA threshold of 4.0 ng/mL than would be expected to\ndie from the disease in the next 10 years. Our results, from a\npopulation of screen-eligible men (i.e. those without symptoms\nof prostate cancer), suggest that raising the threshold--perhaps\nto 10 ng/mL--would identify a number of men that more closely\napproximates the number at risk for prostate cancer death. Fur-\nthermore, because screening always has benefits and harms, it is\npossible that raising the PSA threshold would enhance the net\neffect of PSA screening by identifying the people at highest risk\nof clinically significant disease and thereby limiting the number\nof healthy people harmed. Although it is possible that a higher\nPSA threshold could cause some cases of clinically important\ndisease to be missed (some of which may benefit from earlier\ntherapy), it is incumbent on those who would argue for keeping\nthe current PSA threshold of 4 ng/mL to demonstrate that\nfinding such cases outweighs the inevitable harms of involving\nmillions of men in the screening process.\nWe recognize that many clinicians will find the suggestion of\nhigher PSA thresholds both radical and difficult to accept. Ide-\nally, randomized trials that test a variety of thresholds should be\nperformed to inform the choice of threshold. However, no such\ntrials are in progress. In the meantime, it does not make sense to\nadopt a PSA threshold that causes the number of men identified\nas abnormal to move yet further away from the number of men\nwho are destined to develop clinically important disease. We\nbelieve that lowering the PSA threshold to 2.5 ng/mL would be\na mistake.\nREFERENCES\n(1) Thompson IM, Pauler DK, Goodman PJ, Tangen CM, Lucia MS,\nParnes HL, et al.
