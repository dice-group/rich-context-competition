It has been speculated that\nthrough abnormal fat distribution (central adiposity),\nobesity is a major factor in the pathological progres-\nsion concluding in CVD.1 \u00b1 3 The association between\nadiposity and CVD is traditionally assessed by anthro-\npometric parameters such as the body mass index\n(BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). BMI is a\nheight-independent measure of weight, often used as\na measure of body size and the degree of fatness, the\nuse of which is contentious due to its correlation with\nfatness being not consistent across populations.4\nAlthough WHR measures central fat deposition, it is\nan imperfect measure of visceral fat mass, particularly\nin lean individuals.5 Some studies have shown that\nwaist circumference may be a better predictor of CVD\nthan BMI and WHR.6 \u00b1 8 Waist circumference is a\nsurrogate of total body and abdominal fat accumula-\ntion, not accounted for by either BMI or WHR.8\nWaist circumference is a better correlate of the\nvisceral adipose tissue than BMI or WHR.8 Visceral\nadipose tissue is associated with the constellation of\nfactors comprising the insulin resistance syndrome,\nwhich includes hyperinsulinaemia, glucose intoler-\nance, hypertension, hyperglyceridaemia and high\nlevels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C).9\nSome have postulated that the action of central\nadiposity on CVD is through lipoprotein moities-\napolipoprotein B (ApoB) and apolipoprotein A-I\n(ApoAI) by atherogenic and thrombotic mechan-\nisms.10 \u00b1 14 ApoAI is the activator of lecithin (choles-\nterol acyltransferase) which esteri\u00aees plasma\ncholesterol that mobilizes residual cholesterol from\ncells.15,16 ApoB aids in the delivery of cholesterol to\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that ApoB,\nApoAI and triglyceride (TG) are independent risk\nand TGs (triglycerols) are seen as another possible\naspect of the syndrome linking obesity with CVD.\nAlthough an elevated ratio of ApoB and ApoAI\n(ApoBaApoAI) has been found to be a powerful\n*Correspondence: Dr Ike S.

Tradition-\nally, many studies investigating the association\nbetween lipoproteins and CVD are often restricted to\ntheir parent cholesterol (LDL-C and high-density\nlipoprotein, HDL-C), although more and more studies\nare now looking at TGs, apolipoproteins and their\nmolecular variants as potential risk factors for CVD.\nThe objectives of this investigation were twofold:\nFirstly, examine and compare the relationship\nbetween ApoBaApoAI and central fat distribution\n(de\u00aened by waist circumference) in a biracial US\npopulation sample, and secondly, to determine if the\nrelationships between ApoBaApoAI and waist cir-\ncumference were affected by other variables including\nage, BMI, plasma glucose, insulin, serum TG and total\ncholesterol.\nMethods\nData from the third US National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III) were used in this\ninvestigation. NHANES III was a multistage prob-\nability sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian US\npopulation groups, examined in two phases between\nOnly subjects aged 17 \u00b1 90 y, who participated in\nglucose analysis after an overnight fast, were eligible\nfor this investigation. Pregnant women and those on\ninsulin or hypoglycaemic agents were excluded from\nanalyses. This study was also restricted to individuals\nfor whom anthropometric variables, including age,\nweight, height, waist and hip were obtained, and\nalso to those who were assayed for total cholesterol,\nfasting insulin, serum ApoB, serum ApoAI and serum\nTG. Waist measurement was made at the natural waist\nor at the midpoint between the bottom of the rib cage\nand the top of the iliac crest, for each subject at\nminimal respiration to the nearest 0.1 cm. Detailed\nmethods used in measuring cholesterol, TG, HDL-C\nand LDL-C cholesterol have been described else-\nwhere.19,24 Brie\u00afy, ApoB and ApoAI were measured\nby radial immunodiffusion in the \u00aerst 8.2% of the\nspecimens and by rate immunonephelometry for the\nremaining.19 Based on the above criteria, a total of\neligible for this investigation.\nStatistical methods\nStatistical programs available in SPSS for Windows\nwere utilized for these analyses.25 Means and standard\ndeviations for ApoBaApoAI and descriptive variables\nwere computed and compared across race and gender.\nWe used empirical waist cut-points ( ! 94.00 cm for\nmen and ! 80.00 cm for women) based on the study\nby Lean et al,26 to compare mean values of\nApoBaApoAI across race and gender. Our justi\u00aeca-\ntion to use these cut points was due to the high degree\nof agreement between the above waist circumference\nvalues and BMI (BMI ! 25 kgam2) with speci\u00aecity\nand sensitivity of 97.5% and 96%, respectively. With\nthe above cut points, Lean et al26 also found that waist\ncircumference identi\u00aeed subjects with high WHR\nand 96% speci\u00aecity and sensitivity, respectively. The\nabove BMI cut points are consistent with the World\nHealth Organization (WHO) recommendation, and the\nWHR is within the range suggested by the US\nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA) for Americans.\nand the USDA recommends a WHR of 0.95 for men\nand 0.80 for women, for determining risk of\nTo obtain normality, TG values were log10\ntrans-\nformed, prior to analyses.

Gender and race speci\u00aec\nmultiple regression analysis with ApoBaApoAI as the\ndependent variable and waist girth as the independent\nvariable, was used to determine the association\nbetween ApoBaApoAI and waist circumference\nadjusted for age, BMI, plasma glucose, insulin, TG\nand total cholesterol. The customary P-values of 0.05\nwere used to specify statistical signi\u00aecance.\nResults\nTable 1 describes the anthropometric and clinical\ncharacteristics of the study participants.

Overall,\nthe total cholesterol values for Blacks and Whites\nwere slightly elevated, but within clinically acceptable\nvalues.

In the univariate correlation analysis, waist\ncircumference was positively correlated with\nApoBaApoAI, ApoB, TG, LDL, glucose, insulin and\ntotal cholesterol in Black and White men and women\n(P ` 0.05). Also, waist circumference was inversely\ncorrelated with ApoAI and serum HDL-C cholesterol\nin Blacks and Whites (P ` 0.01).\nDue to the strong degrees of correlation for TG and\ninsulin, with waist circumference in the univariate\nanalyses, we adjusted for each, to determine their\nindependent effect on the association between waist\ngirth and ApoBaApoAI. When adjusted for TG, waist\ncircumference was positively correlated with\nApoBaApoAI, ApoB, LDL-C (except in Black\nwomen), plasma glucose and insulin in Blacks and\nWhites (P ` 0.01). Comparing the univariate models\nwith TG-adjusted models, there were decreases in the\nvalues of ApoBaApoAI regression coef\u00aecients by\nmen, Black women and White women, respectively.\nFurther analyses were carried out, which adjusted for\nfasting insulin. Again, waist girth was independently\nrelated with ApoBaApoAI in Black men, White men,\nBlack women and White women (P ` 0.05). Com-\npared with TG adjusted analyses, serum LDL-C (in\nBlack men and Black women), plasma glucose (in\nBlack men) and ApoAI (in Black women) were no\nlonger signi\u00aecant, while total cholesterol (in White\nmen and White women) and ApoB (in Black women),\nbecame signi\u00aecant in insulin adjusted analyses\n(P ` 0.05).

Similar results of the inde-\npendent correlation between ApoBaApoAI and waist\ncircumference were observed (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nAlthough obesity is one known factor in insulin\nresistance syndrome,29 \u00b1 31 its independent role in\nCVD is not well understood. To investigate the role\nof obesity, several investigators have de\u00aened different\nforms of adiposity and their separate relationship to\nCVD. Traditionally, BMI and WHR are the most\ncommonly used indices in the literature. Recent\ninvestigations show, however, that waist circumfer-\nence as an absolute and aggregate measure of total fat\ndistribution, is a better risk factor for CVDs than\nWHR or BMI. In fact, an analysis by Chan et al 32\nshows that one can achieve a better discrimination of\nCVD risks using waist girth, rather than using WHR\nor BMI\nThe present investigation uses population-based to\nprovide information about the relationship between\ncentral fat distribution, de\u00aened by waist circumfer-\nence and the ratio of two important apolipoproteins\nthat are known to be independent risk factors for\nCVD. The mean values of ApoB for Black and\nWhite men and women, were less than the cut\npoints suggested (ApoB ! 120 mgadl) to be asso-\nciated with increased risk of CVD.33 When we used\nthis cut point in our analyses, the prevalence rates of\nfor Black men, White men, Black women, and White\nwomen, respectively. Based on the suggested34 value\nof ` 120 mgadl, the prevalence rates of ApoAI were\nBlack women and White women, respectively. These\nindividuals may be regarded as having abnormal\nApoB and ApoAI and at risk for CVD.33,34\nAlthough abdominal adiposity has been hypothe-\nsized to increase TG and TG is widely regarded as an\nimportant factor in the enhanced and reduced produc-\ntion of small LDL-C and HDL-C, respectively,35 \u00b1 37\nthere are few studies that have adjusted for TG.\nand ApoAI, to our knowledge there are no investiga-\ntions using ApoBaApoAI, that adjusted for TG. Due\nto the strong degrees of correlation of TG and insulin\nwith ApoBaApoAI in univariate analyses and because\nhypertriglyceridaemia is frequently accompanied by a\nstate of insulin resistance,40 we adjusted for TG and\ninsulin, to account for their possible confounding\neffect.\nAlthough our data are cross-sectional and causality\ncannot be established, we have shown that\nApoBaApoAI is positively correlated with abdominal\nfat distribution in a biracial population sample, inde-\npendent of age. We have also shown that the correla-\ntion persists, even after adjusting for TG or insulin. In\nshowed that increasing waist circumference was asso-\nciated with increased ApoB, TG, serum LDL-C,\nplasma glucose, insulin and total cholesterol concen-\ntrations, and decreased concentrations of ApoAI and\nserum HDL-C. We have also shown that TG and total\ncholesterol were independently associated with\nApoBaApoAI, and were stronger predictors of\nApoBaApoAI in all four groups than waist girth,\nBMI, glucose and insulin. For reasons yet to be\nde\u00aened, the correlation between waist girth and\nApoBaApoAI was weaker and the association lacking\namong White men and Black women compared to\nBlack men and White women.\nConclusion\nAdditional studies are needed to de\u00aene lifestyle\nchanges appropriate for reduction ApoBaApoAI\nlevels in these populations. The result of this study\nsuggests the need to investigate ApoBaApoAI as\nanother possible facet in the complexity of the so-\ncalled insulin resistance syndrome.\n"
