    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe penal code of Ghana condemns suicide attempt. The present study sought to explore the views of the police on persons\nwho attempt suicide and the law criminalizing the act. Qualitative in-depth interviews were used to explore the views of 18\nofficers of the Ghana Police Service. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis technique. Findings showed that the police\nofficers profiled suicide attempters as needy, enigmatic, ignorant, and blameworthy. Majority (n = 14) of them disagreed with the\nlaw and suggested a repeal, whereas only four of them agreed with the law. Regardless of their positions on criminalization,\nthey showed an inclination to help, rather than arrest, when confronted with such persons in line of their duty. Educating the\npolice on suicidal behavior may help to deepen their understanding and help improve the way they handle suicidal persons.\nThis may also strengthen police suicide prevention gatekeeping obligations.\n",

As reported generally across the African continent\nand most low- and middle-income countries (LAMICs),\nthere are no official statistics on the epidemiology and bur-\nden of suicide in Ghana (Hjelmeland et al., 2008; Knizek,\nAkotia, & Hjelmeland, 2011; Quarshie, Osafo, Akotia, &\ntistical evidence shows that about 1,556 people (i.e., roughly\nfive people in a day) die by suicide yearly in Ghana (Citifm\nOnline, 2012). Although these statistics and estimates may\nappear staggering (and arguably crude), they are undoubt-\nedly a fair reflection of the reality and burden of the phenom-\nenon of suicide in Ghana (Knizek, Akotia, & Hjelmeland,\nWHO (2014) encourages member countries across the\nworld to place high premium on suicide prevention irrespec-\ntive of a country's current position in terms of suicide rate or\nsuicide prevention activities; and in Africa, there is an urgent\nneed to prioritize suicide prevention (Burrows & Schlebusch,\n2009). Thus, the clarion call to suicide prevention is now a\nglobal imperative targeted at reducing the rate of suicide in\nrecommendations to achieve this target according to the\nprograms such as timely and effective evidence-based inter-\nventions, treatment and support, and decriminalization of\nsuicide attempts.Asuicide attempt here refers to engagement\nin a potentially self-destructive behavior which does not\nresult in death but in which there is at least some intent to die\n(Mars, Burrows, Hjelmeland, & Gunnell, 2014; Nock &\nSuicide attempts are 20 times more frequent than \"com-\n1University of Ghana, Legon, Ghana\n2University of Leeds, UK\n3Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, UK\n4Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway\n5Centre for Suicide and Violence Research (CSVR), Accra, Ghana\nCorresponding Author:\nJoseph Osafo, Department of Psychology, School of Social Sciences,\nUniversity of Ghana, Legon, Ghana.\nEmail: josaforo@gmail.com\nPolice Views of Suicidal Persons and the\nLaw Criminalizing Attempted Suicide in\nGhana: A Qualitative Study With Policy\nImplications\nJoseph Osafo1,5, Charity S.

More significantly, prior suicide attempt is\nknown to be the single strongest predictor and risk of death\nby suicide in the general population (Hawton, Rodham, &\nThe implication is that persons who have attempted suicide\nin the past are at higher risk of death by suicide in the future\nthan individuals without any prior suicide attempts.\nTherefore, identifying these at-risk individuals and groups to\nprovide them with follow-up care and support has been\nunderscored as a key element of any comprehensive strategy\nWHO (2014) admonishes thus, \"all countries should review\ntheir legal provisions in relation to suicide to ensure they do\nnot deter people from seeking help\" (p. 51).\nHowever, Ghana is still one of the WHO member coun-\ntries with laws against suicide attempt (Adinkrah, 2016;\nCode of Ghana (Act 29 of Ghana, Section 57; Subsection II,\n1960) provides that \"whoever attempts to commit suicide\nshall be guilty of a misdemeanour.\" Hence, a person who\nattempts suicide is subject to arrest and prosecution, and is\nmade to face criminal sanctions upon conviction (Adinkrah,\nKahn & Lester, 2013). This penal code was promulgated\nbased on the British Common Law (Adinkrah, 2016;\nbeen repealed--since 1961--in England and Wales, so that\nsuicide attempt is no longer seen as a criminal offense in\nthese countries, but rather treated as a health problem requir-\ning professional psychological and/or psychiatric attention\nSeeking to understand the legal position of any country in\nrelation to suicide (specifically, decriminalizing attempted sui-\ncide) requires customized, contextually relevant and culturally\nDhawan, & Sagar, 2014). In Ghana, the burgeoning research\nefforts aimed at understanding the attitudes of people toward\nthe act that criminalizes attempted suicide have thus far\nfocused on the views and attitudes of various stakeholders\n(e.g., media, university students, nurses, psychologists, non-\ngovernmental organizations, and researchers) (see Adinkrah,\nOsafo, Knizek, Akotia, & Hjelmeland, 2012). Various argu-\nments for and against the (potential merits and demerits of)\ndecriminalization of attempted suicide in Ghana have been\ncomprehensively discussed elsewhere (e.g., see Adinkrah,\n2013). This study is aimed at extending these studies to include\nthe police in Ghana.\nThe police have a long-standing history regarding social\nand community intervention with individuals experiencing\nmental health problems, even though the extent of their\ninvolvement and the posture of their interactions have\nchanged across time (Matheson et al., 2005; Spence &\nMillott, 2016). The involvement of the police with citizens\nexperiencing mental health problems (including people in\nsuicidal crisis) is explained based on two legal principles\n1992). The first is the police power function principle, that is,\nthe duty of the police to protect the safety and welfare of the\ncitizenry by removing dangerous people from the commu-\nnity. This responsibility demands that the police apprehend\nsuspects who break the law irrespective of the suspects'men-\ntal health condition (Engel & Silver, 2001; Teplin & Pruett,\n1992). The second principle is parens patriae. This principle\nprovides that it is the duty of the police to assist citizens who\nare in need or unable to help themselves. The principle of\nparens patriae most often informs police decision, discre-\ntion, and arrest behavior in cases where a mentally disturbed\nsuspect is involved in a misdemeanor, or criminal situations\ninvolving mentally disordered persons, usually posing a\nthreat to themselves or to community members (Engel &\nStatistical Service, 2016) with a police\u00adpopulation ratio of\n1:784, as against the United Nations's (UN) policing bench-\nPolice Service Act of Ghana (1970) states that \"it shall be the\nduties of the Police Force to prevent and detect crime, to\napprehend offenders and to maintain public order and safety\nof persons and properties\" (Act 350 of Ghana, Section 1).\nThus, with suicides and suicide attempts criminalized in\nGhana, police officers frequently come into contact with sui-\ncidal persons and sometimes their significant others, mainly,\nbecause they (the police) are often the first emergency service\nto be called upon when a person is suspected to be at risk of\n(or even dead by) suicide, and they regularly help to handle\nsuicide and other mental health\u00adrelated crises within the com-\nmunity (Lester & Pitts, 1991; Marzano, Smith, Long, Kisby,\nSpence & Millott, 2016). This implies that the police (apart\nfrom maintaining and enforcing law and order) double as\nfrontline mental health workers within the community setting\nOmoaregba, James, Igbinowanhia, & Akhiwu, 2015; Teplin\n& Pruett, 1992). Furthermore, in the current Mental Health\nment in mental health is indicated at the level of diversion.\nThey are the first point of potential diversion of the mentally\nill to relevant centers for attention and help. Therefore, in the\nbid to expand the burgeoning evidence (e.g., Adinkrah,\nOsafo, Akotia, Andoh-Arthur, Boakye, & Quarshie, 2017;\nOsafo, Akotia, & Boakye, 2016) and training programs (e.g.,\nOsafo et al. 3\nfor media personnel, judges and lawyers, health profession-\nals, police officers, etc.) to push for the decriminalization of\nattempted suicide in Ghana, the present study finds it impera-\ntive to explore the views of personnel of the Ghana Police\nService on suicidal persons and the law criminalizing suicide\nattempts in the country. Such a study can further our under-\nstanding of the gatekeeping role of the police in suicide pre-\nvention,aswellascontributingtothedebateondecriminalizing\nattempted suicide in Ghana.\nMethod\nThe Ghana Police Service is segmented into 12 administrative\nregions: Accra, Tema, Ashanti, Eastern, Brong Ahafo, Volta,\nWestern, Central, Northern, Upper East, Upper West, and rail-\nways, ports, and harbor regions. The Marine Police Unit\n(MPU) has recently been created to handle security and polic-\ning matters that emanate from the country's steadily develop-\ning offshore oil and gas industry (Brookman-Amissah,\nWemegah, & Okyere, 2014). Accra, the capital of Ghana, was\nthe site for this study. The purposive and convenient sampling\ntechniques were used to select 18 personnel of the Ghana\nPolice Service (see characteristics in Table 1). Police officers\nwho were informed about the study by their superiors in their\nrespective stations and registered their interest were\napproached. The informants were aged between 25 and 50\nyears, with an average age of 40.2 years; they were ranked\nfrom corporal through chief inspector, with an average polic-\ning experience of 15.3 years. The informants were taken\nthrough one-to-one semistructured qualitative interviews.\nAmong other relevant questions, informants were asked,\n\"What is your view on the law criminalizing suicide attempts\nin Ghana?\"; \"What is your opinion on why people attempt sui-\ncide in Ghana?\" Each informant was approached in his or her\noffice and interviewed in English because all of them preferred\nto have the conversation in that medium. Averagely, each\ninterview lasted 45 min. All the interviews were audiotaped\nfor transcription and analysis.\nThematic analysis, \"a method for identifying, analysing\nand reporting patterns (themes) within data\" (Braun &\ndata. From listening to the audiotaped interviews vis-\u00e0-vis\nthe transcripts to correct any errors of omission, typos, and\nmisprints in the transcripts, we began the analysis of the data\nby noting and agreeing on initial codes that were closely\nrelated and relevant to the research question. Each of the\nresearchers iteratively read the transcripts independently to\nmap out themes related to the initial codes noted. To ensure a\nstrong connection between the mapped out working themes\nand the data, we analyzed and teased out the themes which\nwere closely and sufficiently supported by the evidence con-\ntained in the interviews (Braun & Clarke, 2006; Buetow,\nworking themes was conducted by iteratively reading the\ntranscripts as well as making reference to relevant literature\nand research team consensus. Compelling excerpts of the\npolice views contained in the transcripts were culled to sup-\nport the representation and discussion of the working themes.\nThe protocol and ethical position of the study were\napproved and cleared by the Ethics Committee for the\nHumanities (ECH) of the University of Ghana, Legon, and\npermission to access participants was granted by the Greater\nAccra Regional Headquarters of the Ghana Police Service.\nEach of the informants signed an actual consent form prior to\nparticipation.\nFindings\nThe data analysis showed three superordinate themes: profil-\ning suicidal persons, police position on the law, and gate-\nkeeping posture.\nProfiling Suicidal Persons\nPrior to examining the position of the police on the law crim-\ninalizing attempted suicide, it was imperative to explore how\nthe police viewed or profiled suicidal persons as offenders of\nthe law against attempted suicide in Ghana. Offender profil-\ning involves offering an account of the characteristics of an\noffender based on the nature of the crime committed (Canter,\n2004). The theme, profiling suicidal persons, thus examines\nthe views of the police regarding suicidal persons based on\ntheir (police) experiences of handling suicide-related cases\nin their line of duty. In this study, the police profiled suicidal\npersons by drawing upon four psychosocial circumstances\nTable 1. Showing Sample Characteristics of Participants.\nCharacteristic Frequency (n) % (n = 18)\nSex\nAge\nRank\nReligion\nMarital status\n4 SAGE Open\nand characteristics they adduced to suicidal behavior: needy,\nenigmatic, ignorant, and blameworthy.\nNeedy. Some police personnel (n = 10) profiled suicidal per-\nsons as individuals in need of help. Drawing on facts gath-\nered from previous suicide-related crime investigations, the\npolice reported that persons experiencing suicidal crisis are\npushed by their unmet psychological, social, and/or material\nneeds to engage in suicide. When these needs are expressed\nby the individual but remain unmet or unrecognized by sig-\nnificant others, the result is an enduring psychological pain\n(psychache) as asserted by Shneidman (1993). A police offi-\ncer illustrated this as follows:\nThey [suicidal persons] are people who are in need, they need to\nbe helped. You need to have time, listen to them and then you\nwill know the cause, the reason behind their attempt to commit\nsuicide. When you listen to them you might be of help but if you\njust look at the face value and dismiss it, it's not the right way.\nThe opinion above points to the fact that persons experienc-\ning suicidal crisis are usually in need, requiring help of some\nsort, and the need can be identified by a potential helper who\ngenuinely listens to and empathizes with the suicidal person.\nImplicitly, the opinion further highlights as unhelpful atti-\ntude of condemnation and trivialization usually shown by\nsignificant others toward persons experiencing suicidal cri-\nsis. For example, in Ghana, families tend to sharply condemn\na member who attempts suicide, instead of making empathic\nefforts to understand the reasons for the behavior and/or pro-\nvide support (Asare-Doku, 2016). This is owed to the fact\nthat families view suicidal behavior as a social injury and as\nsuch families become more concerned with protecting their\nsocial image and status against stigma and shame (Osafo,\nOsafo, Hjelmeland, Akotia, & Knizek, 2011). A shameful\nbehavior is perceived contagious because the self is defined\nin reference to others (Gyekye, 1995). Consequently, a strong\ndisavowal of suicidal behavior is a commonplace in most\nGhanaian communities (Osafo, 2016a). Thus, the expressed\nneeds of suicidal persons remain unnoticed and unaddressed,\nthereby pushing them further into attempting suicide.\nAnother police officer shared a case as follows: \"Last year, a\nhouseboy just hanged himself. When we investigated the\nincident, we found that the guy was suffering, financially\"\n(Male, 36 years). In Ghana, a houseboy is usually a young\nadult male from a rural area with little or no formal educa-\ntion, who is hired by a middle- or higher-class urban family\nto perform, usually, multiple roles within the household: a\nwatchman, gardener, cook, driver, steward, and/or gate-\nkeeper (Tsikata, 2011). Houseboys (like other domestic\nworkers in Ghana) receive paltry salaries, which are some-\ntimes not paid consistently at the elapse of time (Tsikata,\n2009). However, a houseboy usually has dependents (e.g.,\nwife and children or extended relations) to provide for.\nGenerally, domestic workers in Ghana are categorized within\nthe informal sector of the economy, and thus lack any explicit\nlabor and employment legislation or institution providing\nThe implication is that a domestic worker lacks any legiti-\nmate right to negotiate for pay increase or improvement in\nthe general conditions of work, even in the face of the harsh\neconomic realities across the country. Coroner investigations\nin the aftermath of suicide involve some kind of sociological\nand psychological autopsies--soliciting the views of signifi-\ncant others regarding the palpable life situation and behavior\nof the deceased days/months before the suicide (Scourfield,\nFincham, Langer, & Shiner, 2012). In the above case in\npoint, it is plausible that the financial problem of the deceased\nmight have been reported to the investigators because while\nalive the deceased (directly or indirectly) expressed his\nfinancial needs to significant others, but received no help.\nConsequently, the houseboy in the case in point might have\nequated his financial difficulties to a lack of achievement or\na loss of his ability to provide for his dependents (or even\nhimself), presupposing a gross infraction of the social expec-\ntation of masculinity. In Ghana, one of the indices of a suc-\ncessful masculinity is a demonstration of the ability to take\ncare of others, and inability to do this invokes social dishonor\nfor a man (Adomako Ampofo & Boateng, 2007). Hence,\nconsistent with previous observation of suicidality among\nthe houseboy in the above case might have killed himself to\navoid any such dishonor to loss of masculinity and dignity of\nmanliness. Thus, people who attempt suicide are, sometimes,\npersons whose expressed needs are not recognized or remain\nunattended to by significant others.\nEnigmatic.The police officers (n = 7) further profiled sui-\ncidal persons as enigmatic--mysterious and elusive persons\nwhose behaviors are difficult to understand and also predict.\nAccording to the police officers, a person experiencing sui-\ncidal crisis shows no visible eccentric behavior or any sign of\nsuicidal intention, thereby making it very difficult (if not\nimpossible) for significant others to identify to offer any\nneeded timely help or intervention. A police officer reported,\nRecently, a police inspector hanged himself. It was very, very\nshocking, because I saw him personally the night before he\nkilled himself. So we were all like, how? Somebody who\nappeared to be very strong, and active. . . . We were all surprised\nand traumatized because we did not suspect him to be like that.\nThe shock and surprise as indicated by this participant are\npredicated on the absence of warning signs of suicidal crisis\nand recent interaction with the deceased. Perhaps clear indi-\ncation of an impending suicidal crisis would have prepared\nthis participant and others to perhaps provide support for the\nOsafo et al. 5\ndeceased. Implicit in the quote is an expectation that the\ndeceased should have shared his crisis with others to enlist\ntheir support (Osafo et al., 2011). Accordingly, another offi-\ncer remarked, \"to every problem there is a solution, so peo-\nple should be open to confide in friends, relatives and share\ntheir problems. The best way to solve a problem is not to\ncommit suicide\" (Female, 31 years). An assumption implic-\nitly held by this participant is that suicidal persons are obliged\nto seek early help from their close relatives, because such\nsocial supports are available. Her recommendation appears\nheavily laden with values and moral imperatives within her\nsociocultural context. But in light of the widespread condem-\nnation and stigma toward suicidal persons in Ghana\nthe utility of such suggestion might be questionable.\nIgnorant.The police officers in this study (n = 9) reported\nthat some people experiencing suicidal crisis go on to attempt\nsuicide or kill themselves mainly because they are na\u00efve as to\nthe availability of expert workable alternative solutions to\nthe unmet needs fueling their crisis. As opined by an officer,\nThey [suicidal persons] lack knowledge. When people don't\nhave enough education or enough ideas about something then\nthey turn around to do what they understand. Yes, because\npeople don't have knowledge on how to control or manage the\nstress and troubles they are going through, they feel that the best\nway is to take their lives, after all, \"all die be die.\" (Male, 43\nyears)\nThis participant views a suicidal person as bereft of insight in\nexistential struggles, and that such ignorance is often the\ncause for suicidality. As he implied, a well-thought-through\nsolution to crisis in life should lead to a resolve to pursue life\nand living than dying. He makes reference to a pervasive folk\nknowledge (owuo biara y owuo or \"all die be die\") to illus-\ntrate the apathy toward healthy lifestyle, and thus a manifes-\ntation of the ignorance he was expounding. There is evidence\nelsewhere in Ghana that illustrates, for example, that such\nkinds of folk knowledge which belittles personal efforts in\nimproving health attitudes are easily adopted by people at\nrisk of HIV/AIDS to neutralize campaign efforts, programs,\nand messages aimed at promoting safer sex and reducing\nHIV infection in Ghana (Awusabo-Asare, Abane, Badasu, &\nAnarfi, 1999). Such mundane understandings provide the\nlexica for the understanding and expression of suicidal (and\nother mental health) crises and the frame of reference for\nmanaging them (Konradsen, van der Hoek, & Peiris, 2006;\nMarecek, 1998). In general, his view that suicidal persons\nare ignorant may be explained by lay understandings of sui-\ncide in societies where mental health knowledge and services\nare less developed and expert knowledge is absent from the\ndominant social discourse on health issues (Marecek, 1998).\nIn addition, another police officer (female, 31 years)\nreported, \"most people who attempt or commit suicide don't\neven know that it's against the laws of Ghana and God. So,\nit's all about information and knowledge that they [suicidal\npersons] don't have.\" This opinion underscored two facts: (a)\nas observed in previous studies (e.g., Adinkrah, 2012b,\n2016), most Ghanaians are not aware of the country's anti-\nsuicide law; and (b) although Ghana may be described as a\nreligious country by behavior and practices (see Gilani,\nShahid, & Zuettel, 2012), people who attempt or commit sui-\ncide do not seem to know that the act is a religious transgres-\nsion. Perhaps she is asserting that awareness of these\nproscriptive imperatives would have deterred the suicidal\nperson. Such kind of ignorance, as she espouses, reflects lack\nof information about the prohibitive normative structures\nagainst the act. Such view reflects a superficial, informa-\ntional knowledge gap more than the lack of generalized\ninsight for living intimated earlier by the male participant\n(male, 43 years). Generally, as observed in other LAMICs\nwith antisuicide laws, illiteracy is high and most people do\nnot know that suicidal behavior is a punishable crime (Latha\nBlameworthy.\nresponses by four of the police officers (n = 4) as to what\nmotivates people to attempt/commit suicide revealed that\n\"completed\" and attempted suicides are consequential to the\nblameworthy conducts of suicidal persons. According to\nthese police officers, some people experience suicidal crisis\nbecause of certain self-defeating lifestyle choices they have\nmade and habits they have formed over time. In a police offi-\ncer's opinion,\nThere is no influence from anywhere . . . If you choose to be an\nalcohol man [sic] and you take alcohol and get very drunk, then\nyou cannot control your brain. So whatever comes into your\nmind you will do it. So, it depends on the choice of the individual\nhimself. (Male, 39 years)\nIn the above quote, the police officer appeared to suggest that\nthe precursors and agency in suicidal behavior lie entirely\nwithin the individual. The power to refrain from attempting/\ncommitting suicide belongs to and is wielded entirely by the\nindividual, unless the individual willingly relinquishes that\ncontrol or personal sense of agency through the adoption of a\nself-defeating habit or lifestyle: alcoholism. Alcoholism has\nbeen implicated as having a significant influence on the sui-\ncidal process, especially among men in Sub-Saharan Africa\n(Kizza, Hjelmeland, Kinyanda, & Knizek, 2012; Knizek,\nKinyanda, Owens, & Hjelmeland, 2011; Ovuga, Boardman,\n& Wasserman, 2007). People with chronic alcoholism tend\nto lose their sense of personal control during suicidal crisis\nand go on to kill themselves following a suicidal motivation\n(Kizza, Hjelmeland, et al., 2012; Kizza, Knizek, Kinyanda,\nAlthough all the police officers in this study considered\nattempted suicide as a criminal offense, generally those who\n6 SAGE Open\nprofiled suicidal persons as needy, enigmatic, and ignorant\nappeared to base the culpability of the suicidal person on fac-\ntors beyond the control of the individual suicidal person\n(e.g., economic and financial difficulties, intense social\nstigma, etc.). Hence, such persons need to be helped rather\nthan punished. However, police officers who profiled sui-\ncidal persons as blameworthy considered such persons as\nentirely culpable of the offense, requiring arrest, conviction,\nand punishment by the law.\nPolice Position on the Law\nThis superordinate theme relates to the police officers'\nresponses to the question, \"What is your view on the law\ncriminalizing attempted suicide in Ghana?\" All the police\nofficers in this study indicated their awareness of the existing\nlaw criminalizing attempted suicide in Ghana and showed\nfair understanding of the reasoning behind its promulgation.\nMajority (n = 14) of the police officers disagreed with the\nlaw and suggested a repeal, whereas a few (n = 4) of them\nagreed with the law and thus suggested it should be main-\ntained. Drawing on how they profiled suicidal persons and\ntheir understanding of the rationale behind the law, the police\nofficers provided reasons for or against the law criminalizing\nattempted suicide in Ghana.\nReasons for maintaining the law. Police officers who, largely,\nprofiled suicidal persons as blameworthy agreed with the law\ncriminalizing attempted suicide in Ghana, and therefore sug-\ngested that the law should be maintained because of its deter-\nrent effect and on grounds of protecting lives.\nDeterrent effect.Here, police officers argued that main-\ntaining the law and sanctioning perpetrators would serve to\ndeter others from attempting suicide. For instance, \"I agree\nwith the law because when you are caught and punished for\nattempted suicide, it will deter others who will also have\nthe idea or perceive to do it\" (male, 38 years). The probable\nassumption undergirding this reasoning is that sometimes\npeople learn by imitating the behaviors of others based on\nthe (positive social) consequences following the imitated\nbehavior (Bandura & Walters, 1977). So, generally, a person\nwould refrain from modeling the behavior of a significant\nother if the behavior is followed by punishment or unpleas-\nant consequences.\nProtecting lives. Police officers who provided this reason\nfor the keeping of the law took an ethical position of judging\nattempted suicide in the light of rules governing human life.\nFor example,\nIt is a crime to kill, whether you attempt to kill someone or you\nattempt to kill yourself. You don't have the right to kill. So if you\nattempt killing yourself and the law gets you, you will be\npunished. (Female, 25 years)\nThe police officer of the above opinion essentially equated\n\"completed\" suicide/attempted suicide to murder/attempted mur-\nderwithinthepurviewofthelaw.Bothactsinvolvedtaking(oran\nattempt at taking) human life, which is forbidden by the law.\nReasons for a repeal of the law. Predominantly, police officers\nwho profiled suicidal persons as needy, enigmatic, and igno-\nrant disagreed with the law. According to these officers, the\nlaw criminalizing attempted suicide in Ghana should be\nrepealed because the law prevents reporting of suicide and it\nis inefficient in providing support.\nThe law prevents reporting of suicide.Police officers who\nadvanced this reason for disagreeing with the law reflected on\nthe general inhibitory effect of the law and the considerable\nstigma associated with suicidal behavior in Ghana. As narrated\nby an officer, \"people don't report it because it is a disgrace to\nthe family and also because of the police. Therefore, most times\nwhen it happens people try to say somebody else killed the per-\nson\" (male, 41 years). Fear of marring the family social image\n(Osafo, 2016b) converges with prosecution from the police to\ninhibit people from reporting suicidal behavior and perhaps\nalso seek early help. Data that could be helpful to inform sui-\ncide prevention programs may thus be hampered. Another par-\nticipant also explains the dynamics of fear of the law and how\nit further blocks the evidence for eventual prosecution:\nSuicide attempt is about evidence. People would come and\nreport suicidal persons but they will not lead you to get the\nevidence because they know when you get the evidence you will\nbe able to prosecute the person . . . (Male, 39 years)\nHere, the participant espouses that fear to follow through\nwith evidence for prosecution is a challenge to the antisui-\ncide law. The law thus becomes a \"white elephant\" because\nfear of prosecution robs the police of the details of cases\nreported as evidence. Generally, Ghanaians show an intense\nhesitation to involving the police in family affairs, possibly\nbecause of the fear of stigma, abuse of power, or incarcera-\ntion of family members (Boateng & Lee, 2014).\nThe law is insensitive. The argument here is that the anti-\nsuicide law is insensitive to the mental health needs of sui-\ncidal persons. For instance,\nI don't think anybody will just wake up and try to end his or her\nown life. If somebody wants to commit suicide and you\ncompound it by sentencing the person then what are you doing?\nI think those who attempt suicide should not be treated like that.\nWe should find a way of counseling them . . . As a society, we\nhave to provide the needs for the person to come out of his\nproblems. (Male, 48 years)\nThe above opinion alluded to the fact that suicidal behavior\nis caused by some unmet needs or malaise in the life of\nOsafo et al. 7\nsuicidal persons. Again, the antisuicide law of Ghana is only\npunitive, as it does not provide for, even, the chance for men-\ntal health assessment, apart from police investigation toward\nthe establishment of criminal evidence tenable in court.\nGiven that Ghana's prisons are in deplorable state and less\nsupportive of inmates, a person convicted on the grounds of\nattempted suicide may return from jail with worse mental\nhealth outcomes. In place of the unsupportive antisuicide\nlaw, the police argued that society must devise ways to\naddress the unmet needs which motivate suicidal behavior in\nthe first place. In the view of another police officer,\nPeople do not even understand why they should be prosecuted\nfor attempting to take their own lives. Sometimes they ask,\n\"when I had problems I got nobody to help me but when I tried\nto kill myself (but not someone else) the government has come\nin to arrest me?\" So, personally I think it [the law] should be\namended in a way to meet the needs of people who are going\nthrough suicidal tendencies. (Female, 38 years)\nIn the above quote, the participant highlights an inherent\nparadox the public finds in the antisuicide law: The law is\ndormant when people are experiencing distress but suddenly\nsprings up when an incident occurs, transforming a person in\ncrisis into a criminal. This appears to inform his view for\ncalling for a reform of the law.\nGatekeeping Posturing\nThis theme highlights the implicit attitudes of the police offi-\ncers in this study toward the enforcement of the antisuicide\nlaw when they receive information about suicide attempt.\nAlmost all the police officers in this study, regardless of how\nthey profiled suicidal persons and their position on the antisui-\ncide law, appeared to have an implicit attitude of either hope\ninspiration or diversion as illustrated in the following quotes:\nWe've been encountering people who have become suicidal\nevery now and then, especially, people who try to commit\nsuicide . . . We talk to them in our own small ways about\nalternative ways of managing their difficulties, although we are\nnot professional counselors . . . Personally, I've been using the\nWord of God because the Bible says that the Word of God heals,\nso I speak the Word of God to them so that they will be healed.\nI once handled a case of suicide attempt. What happened was that,\nwhen the man attempted suicide the first time, I counseled him,\nand I invited his relatives to the station and we arranged for him to\nsee a psychologist also for help.After that we discharged him to his\nfamily. But after some time, like three months, he made another\nattempt. This time when the case came to me, I sent him to court\nand he was sentenced to six months in prison. (Male, 41 years)\nBoth quotes above have one common thing: The police offi-\ncers, at the encounter of an attempted suicide case (at least in\nthe first instance), tried to informally \"fix the situation\"\nwithout effecting any arrest or the full enforcement of the\nlaw. In the first quote, the police officer appeared not to apply\nthe law at all, whereas in the second quote, the police officer\nengaged in diversion until a recurrence of the suicide attempt.\nProsecuting and jailing the suicidal person in the second\nquote indicate the frustration experienced by police officers\nwho handle repeat attempters and the lack of expert knowl-\nedge and understanding of suicidal behavior on the part of\nthe police.\nDiscussion\nThree key findings emerged from this study. First, the police\nin this study profiled suicidal persons differently (persons\nwho are needy, enigmatic, ignorant, and blameworthy).\nSecond, the study reveals that contrasting views on the law\ncriminalizing suicide attempt (law be repealed vs. law be\nmaintained) existed among the police. The third key finding\nshows a common inclination of the police toward \"helping\"\ninstead of \"arresting\" suicide attempters in spite of the con-\ntrasting views about suicidal persons and the laws criminal-\nizing the act.\nAll the police in this study viewed suicide attempt as a\nbreach of the law. However, majority of the police officers (n\n= 14) reflect and draw on their understanding of the psycho-\nlogical and sociocultural precursors of suicidal crises to pro-\nfile suicidal persons as needy, enigmatic, and ignorant\noffenders of the law. The import of these profiles is that sui-\ncidal persons cannot be held responsible for their offense\nbecause they are motivated by unmet needs and factors\nbeyond their control. These police officers, therefore, appear\nsympathetic and supportive of suicidal persons. As observed\nin previous studies (e.g., Latha & Geetha, 2004), a person\ndriven to attempt suicide by factors beyond his or her control\n(e.g., financial difficulties, poverty/unemployment, endoge-\nnous biological causes, love problems, setbacks in marriage,\nand family or other such reasons) may be implicated under\nthe antisuicide law but cannot be held accountable for the\nsuicidal behavior. Thus, guided by the parens patriae prin-\nciple of policing, the majority of the police in the present\nstudy try to informally help to ameliorate the suicidal crisis\nof an offender by attempting to help the suicidal person.\nHence, these police officers refrain from arresting suicide\nattempters. However, the few police officers in this study\nwho viewed the suicidal persons as blameworthy found the\nsuicidal person culpable for incarceration. The blameworthy\noffender is perceived as entirely responsible for the act and\nconsidered dangerous to other members of the community.\nIn this case, the police power function principle informs the\npolice decision to arrest, prosecute, and punish the suicidal\nperson to ensure the greater safety of the rest of the commu-\nnity. This blameworthy position may be problematic because\nthe presence of mental illness and distress in suicidality have\nbeen established. Consequently, suicidal crisis may represent\na cry for help as well as a means of, or communicating,\n8 SAGE Open\ndistress to significant others for help (Latha & Geetha, 2004;\nWHO, 2014). Incarceration will only amount to worsening\nthe person's mental health state.\nThe finding that majority of the police officers in this\nstudy disagreed with Ghana's antisuicide law supports previ-\nous evidence (i.e., Hjelmeland et al., 2014) on the subject\nmatter in Ghana where some of the participating police offi-\ncers in the study agreed with the antisuicide law, whereas a\ngreater number of them disagreed with the law and called for\na repeal. In the present study, the argument for keeping the\nantisuicide law is anchored in utilitarian arguments for pun-\nishing to ensure the greater good for the greatest number of\npeople (Carlsmith, Darley, & Robinson, 2002; Mensah-\nBonsu, 2001). It must serve the purpose of punishing the per-\nceived criminal nature of suicidality, as they implied, and\neventually reduce the occurrence of the act in the country. It\nis worthy of note that although the sanctity of human life\ndemands that life must be respected and as such the law must\ndeal with anyone who willfully takes (or attempts to take)\nlife, criminal law serves no purpose in the mental health\ndate, no data or study has shown any clear cause\u00adeffect rela-\ntionship or correlation between any antisuicide law and\ndeterrent of suicidal behavior (WHO, 2014). What is clear is\nthat people experiencing suicidal crisis are rather deterred\nfrom seeking help, keep their suicidal intentions secret, stig-\nsuicidal crisis need to be helped but not punished. The\n(potential) benefits of repealing the antisuicide law may far\noutstrip those (if any) associated with the keeping of the anti-\nsuicide law (WHO, 2014). For example, people in suicidal\ncrisis are likely to seek early help which may provide us with\ndata for designing prevention and intervention schemes. This\nresonates with the observation in the present study where\nmajority (77.8%) of the police officers indicated that the\nantisuicide law of Ghana prevents reporting of suicide and it\nis insensitive to the needs of the suicidal person. As admon-\nIt is possible that decriminalization will increase the reporting of\nsuicides once fear of legal recriminations is eliminated. This allows\nfor more accurate estimates of the true extent of the issue. When\nsuicide is considered a criminal act, suicide attempts are often\nhidden and suicide deaths are unreported, thus giving the false\nimpression that suicidal behaviours are less prevalent. (p. 51)\nTherefore, the conviction is that decriminalizing attempted\nsuicide, potentially, would (among other benefits) embolden\npeople experiencing suicidal crisis to seek professional help,\nas the social stigma would be reduced considerably (if not\neliminated).\nAlthough the police in this study perceive suicide attempt\nas a threat to both the suicidal person and (at least, the social\nimage of) the community in which it occurs, the police\nimplicit attitude of hope inspiration and diversion highlights\nthe application of the parens patriae principle. In this\ninstance, the police perceive suicidal persons as citizens who\nare in need and unable to help themselves, but not as crimi-\nnals to be arrested, put before the law court, and punished.\nThus, the principle of parens patriae influences and informs\nthe discretion of the police to, informally, offer help to meet\nthe needs of suicidal persons. This observation is consistent\nreason for this gatekeeping posturing manifested through\nhope inspiration and diversion relates to the practical reali-\nties of policing. The police spend relatively less of their time\non criminal law enforcement duties (Green, 1997). They\nspend the greater chunk of their time and resources on regu-\nlatory issues and cases, including traffic control and activi-\nties broadly described as peacekeeping. In this vein, criminal\noffenses involving mental health problems (e.g., suicidal\nbehaviors) do not provoke serious application of the criminal\nlaw or regulatory control. Rather, police officers judge such\ncases as analogous to public nuisance, requiring the police\nofficer to make efforts to fix the situation by helping to ame-\nliorate the crisis of the suicidal person (Green, 1997; Teplin\nConclusion and Implications\nSuicidal behavior is viewed by the police in this study as an\ninfraction of the law but not a crime punishable by criminal\nlaw. Thus, majority of the police in this study disagree with\nthe antisuicide law of Ghana, calling for a repeal to encour-\nage the reporting of suicide and to help meet the needs of\nsuicidal persons. Thus, the police attempt to help, rather than\narrest and prosecute, attempters of suicide in Ghana.\nContemporary principles of law and punishment have wit-\nnessed a paradigm shift from deterrent to reformation (Latha\n& Geetha, 2004); therefore, the time has come for the legis-\nlature of Ghana to consider repealing the country's antisui-\ncide law, Section 57, Subsection II, of Act 29, The Criminal\nBased on the findings of this study, a couple of useful\nimplications for practice, policy, and research can be iden-\ntified. Regarding practice, the expression of frustration in\nthe handling of suicide persons as revealed in some of the\nvoices in the study points to inadequate evidence-based\nexpert knowledge about suicide and suicidal persons. This\ncalls for increased suicide literacy and training aimed at\nequipping the police in the handling of suicidal persons in\nthe line of their professional duties. While training of\npolice, may enhance their awareness of the needs of sui-\ncide attempters and sharpen police's responsiveness in\ndealing with such persons, it may also help foster collabo-\nration with suicide researchers in the timely release of sui-\ncide information for purposes of intervention and treatment\nOsafo et al. 9\nSpence & Millott, 2016) shows that police education and\ntraining related to suicide and mental health are helpful in\nimproving police attitudes and confidence, and increasing\ntheir skills and knowledge in handling suicidal persons.\nThus, suicidologists (and other allied professionals) in\nGhana may consider organizing gatekeeper training work-\nshops for the police in this regard. A recent study in Ghana,\nfor instance, has revealed a double-edged role of the police\nin matters relating to suicide. On one hand, the police can\nbe key allies for helping people bereaved by suicide, while\non the other hand, their presence can induce fear leading to\nfurther invulnerabilities (Andoh-Arthur, Hjelmeland,\nKnizek, & Osafo, 2016). However, effective training of the\npolice in proscriptive and resource poor contexts, as rec-\nommended in the study above, potentially may help\nenhance police gatekeeping roles in two ways: for research\npurposes regarding access to data and suicidal persons, and\nfor suicide prevention purposes regarding diversion of sui-\ncidal persons into the mental health system (Andoh-Arthur\nPolice Council and the Ghana Police Service may consider\nincluding in the curriculum for training police personnel\nelective courses on handling persons with mental problems\n(including suicidal persons) who break the law. The\ncourses should be mandatory and that periodic training on\nintervention and de-escalation should be part of their cur-\nriculum. Police officers, within this framework, could be\ntherefore patient and empathic in the handling of attempt\nsurvivors. The police service stands to benefit, a great deal,\nfrom this in terms of good exchange between persons in\nsuicidal crisis and police personnel who double as gate-\nkeepers in suicide prevention (Marzano et al., 2016;\nThis study could not sample a larger number of police\nofficers to participate in the study mainly because of the\nbusy nature of the work of the officers. As qualitative\nresearchers, we do not discount the use of large sample in\nresearch (Sandelowski, 2001). However, our focus in this\nexploratory study (which is part of a larger study, N = 500)\nwas aimed at understanding the views of a hard-to-reach\nbut powerful professional group whose views and actions\nhave significant implications for the law on suicide\nattempts. We are convinced that the findings of this study\nrepresent a fair reflection of the views of the police on sui-\ncidal persons and the antisuicide law in this study and\nwould be useful in training them as gatekeepers in suicide\nprevention. Future studies aimed at expanding the evi-\ndence base to push for the decriminalization of suicidal\nbehavior in Ghana may consider soliciting the views of\nother gatekeepers and persons who have primary contact\nwith suicidal persons and the law in Ghana. These include\nmedical doctors, prisons officers, lawyers, judges, and\nmembers of Parliament.\n"
