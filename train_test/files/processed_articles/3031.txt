How-\never, debate continues regarding its specific character-\nistics, impact, and diagnostic criteria. The current study\nwas conducted to increase understanding of atypical de-\npression diagnosed using only the reversed vegetative\nsymptoms of hypersomnia and hyperphagia.\nof the depressed sample; 39.0% when weighted to ap-\nproximate the national population]) was identified within\nthe US National Comorbidity Survey, which assessed psy-\nchiatric disorders among a nationally representative\nsample using the Composite International Diagnostic In-\nterview. The atypical group was identified based on DSM-\nIII-R criteria for a major depressive episode, in addition\nto atypical features of hypersomnia and hyperphagia.\nComparison groups were those with nonatypical depres-\nsion (n=532) and individuals without a psychiatric dis-\nResults: Compared with nonatypical depression, atypi-\ncal depression was associated with a greater percentage\nof women and an earlier age of onset. The atypical group\nalso reported higher rates of most depressive symp-\ntoms, suicidal thoughts and attempts, psychiatric co-\nmorbidity (panic disorder, social phobia, and drug de-\npendence), disability and restricted activity days, use of\nsome health care services, paternal depression, and child-\nhood neglect and sexual abuse (P.05). Compared with\npeople without psychiatric disorders, the atypical group\nreported higher rates of disability and restricted activity\ndays, use of all mental health care services, parental de-\npression, and childhood abuse (P.001).\nConclusions: This analysis of a nationally represen-\ntative US sample suggests that overeating and over-\nsleeping can be used to identify an atypical depression\nsubgroup that is distinct from other depressed patients\nin terms of demographics, psychiatric comorbidities,\nand abuse history. Findings also suggest that atypical\ndepression is associated with increased distress, sui-\ncidal ideation, and disability compared with nonatypi-\ncal depression.\nWEST AND Dally1 pro-\nposed the term\natypical depression\nto describe a type of\ndepression that was\nunique in its symptom profile and re-\nsponse to drug treatment. Subsequent\nstudies have consistently found that pa-\ntients with atypical depression demon-\nstrate relative unresponsiveness to tricy-\nclic antidepressants, but tend to respond\nwell to monoamine oxidase inhibitors.2-5\nIn addition to these differences in treat-\nment response, patients with atypical de-\npression have been shown to differ from\nother depressed patients in terms of psy-\nchiatric symptom patterns,6-10 biological\nspite this substantial body of evidence in-\ndicating that atypical depression is a valid\nspecifier of mood disorders, debate in the\nliterature continues regarding its specific\ncharacteristics and diagnostic crite-\nria.20-22 Partly as a result of these defini-\ntional inconsistencies, physicians may have\ndifficulty recognizing atypical depres-\nsion, and consequently, they may fre-\nquently initiate ineffective pharmacologi-\ncal treatments.23,24 Thus, further research\nis needed on the characteristics and diag-\nnostic criteria of atypical depression.\nThe Columbia criteria, which were\ndeveloped by a group of researchers at Co-\nlumbia University, New York, NY, are\ncommonly used for diagnosing atypical de-\npression.17 According to this diagnostic\nsystem, an episode of major depression is\nclassified as atypical by the presence of\nmood reactivity in addition to any 2 of the\nFrom MEDTAP International,\nInc, Bethesda, Md (Drs Matza\nand Revicki); the Department of\nPsychiatry and Behavioral\nSciences, Duke University\nMedical Center, Durham, NC\n(Dr Davidson); and the New\nYork State Psychiatric Institute,\nNew York, NY (Dr Stewart).\n\u00a92003 American Medical Association.

This diagnostic approach has been used to ef-\nfectively identify an atypical depression group in\nnumerous clinical studies,25-29 and it was incorporated as\na specifier of a major depressive episode of major de-\npressive disorder and bipolar mood disorder in the no-\nmenclature of the DSM-IV.30 However, other research-\ners have questioned the Columbia criteria, particularly\nwith regard to the central role of mood reactivity.8,20-22\nThe current study used a different diagnostic ap-\nproach that emphasizes reversed vegetative symptoms for\nidentification of atypical depression. The reversed veg-\netative approach identifies atypical depression based on\nhypersomnia and hyperphagia, in contrast to the insom-\nnia and weight loss commonly found in melancholic de-\npression. Some empirical research has suggested that this\nrelatively simple approach can reliably identify an atypi-\ncal depression group, although it does not consider mood\nreactivity. For example, one study of depression sub-\ntypes compared demographics, symptom profile, and\ntreatment response between reversed vegetative pa-\ntients with mood reactivity and those without mood re-\nactivity.22 Few differences were found between the groups,\nsuggesting that mood reactivity was not necessary for the\nidentification of an atypical group in that sample. Further\nsupport for the reversed vegetative approach is provided\nby research that has diagnosed atypical depression solely\non the basis of these symptoms. These studies have gen-\nerally identified groups with the expected atypical charac-\nteristics such as earlier age of onset, greater proportion of\nwomen, and more comorbid anxiety symptoms com-\npared with other depressed patients.6,7,10 In addition, re-\nsultsofaclinicaltrialsuggestthatreversedvegetativesymp-\ntoms may be important for guiding treatment strategies.\nThat study found that a monoamine oxidase inhibitor was\nmore effective than placebo for treating atypical depres-\nsion with reversed vegetative symptoms, but also found no\ndrug-placebo differences for depression without reversed\nvegetative symptoms.31 If the reversed vegetative diagnos-\ntic approach can identify atypical depression with reason-\nable accuracy, its relative simplicity may be a significant\nadvantage in primary care settings, where atypical depres-\nsion is frequently unrecognized and thus at risk for inef-\nThe present study identified a group of atypical\ndepressed participants in a national survey sample on\nthe basis of the reversed vegetative symptoms of hyper-\nsomnia and hyperphagia. This atypical depression\ngroup was compared with a nonatypical depression\ngroup and a comparison group of individuals without a\npsychiatric disorder. A range of variables was examined\nin these analyses, including psychiatric comorbidities,\nsuicidal thoughts and behavior, use of health care ser-\nvices, disability days, and history of abuse. It was hy-\npothesized that the current atypical depression group\nwould demonstrate features similar to those of atypical\ngroups in previous studies, thus providing additional vali-\ndation for the reversed vegetative diagnostic approach.\nIn addition, analyses were expected to provide in-\ncreased understanding of the characteristics and conse-\nquences of atypical depression.\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nThe sample was selected from the US National Comorbidity\nSurvey (NCS),32 a nationally representative household survey\nStates, along with a supplemental sample of students living in\ncampus group housing. The NCS was administered to 8098 re-\nin face-to-face interviews occurring in the participants' homes,\naveraging more than 2 hours in length. The response rate was\n82.4%. The sample distributions on demographic variables such\nas age, sex, race, marital status, and socioeconomic status were\nsimilar to population distributions reported by the US Census\nBureau. The data in all analyses were weighted to adjust for se-\nlection rates, response rates, and sociodemographic discrep-\nancies between the final sample and the US population. Char-\nacteristics of the full sample as well as additional description\nof the NCS design and weighting procedures are reported\nAs previously reported, the NCS interview was adminis-\ntered in 2 parts.34 Part 1, which included diagnostic assess-\nment, was administered to the full sample of 8098 partici-\npants. Part 2 was designed to assess the consequences of\npsychiatric disorders. It included assessment of risk factors and\nuse of health care services, and it was administered to 5877 re-\nspondents selected from the total sample.\nThe DSM-III-R diagnoses35 were assigned on the basis of re-\nsponses to a modified version of the Composite International\nDiagnostic Interview (CIDI 1.0),36 which was administered as\npart of the NCS. The CIDI is a structured diagnostic interview\nthat was designed to be used by trained interviewers who are\nnot clinicians. The CIDI diagnoses examined in this study have\ndemonstrated adequate reliability and validity in the World\nHealth Organization CIDI field trials37 and an NCS clinical re-\nappraisal study of the CIDI.38\nFor this report, analyses included only the NCS respon-\ndents who met DSM-III-R35 criteria for a major depressive epi-\nsode during the year before completing the survey (n=836) and\nthe respondents who had never had a psychiatric disorder\n(n=4071). The participants within the depression group were\nthen classified as having atypical or nonatypical depression on\nthe basis of their responses to questions concerning specific\nsymptoms. The NCS only assessed depressive symptoms of the\nrespondents' self-defined worst lifetime episode. Because pat-\nterns of atypical features tend to be stable across depressive epi-\nsodes,39-41 symptoms of this single depressive episode were con-\nsidered to be adequate for classification purposes.\ndepressed sample; 39.0% when weighted to reflect the na-\ntional population]) was identified according to the presence of\nhypersomnia and hyperphagia. Subjects were considered to have\nexperienced hypersomnia if their depressive episode included\n\"a period of 2 weeks or longer when nearly every day you were\nsleeping too much.\" Subjects were considered to have experi-\nenced hyperphagia if they endorsed either of the following 2\nitems: \"at least 2 weeks when you had an increase in appetite\"\nor \"a period when you gained 2 pounds a week or 10 pounds\naltogether.\"\nSubjects who had a major depressive episode, but did not\nmeet these criteria for atypical depression, were placed in the\nnonatypical depression comparison group (n=532). This group\nis fairly heterogeneous with regard to the depressive vegeta-\n\u00a92003 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\ntive symptoms. The majority of this group (53.1%) had mel-\nancholic features of undersleeping (eg, early morning awak-\nening) and undereating (eg, weight loss). The remainder of\nthis group reported the following combinations of vegetative\nsymptoms: 7.8% possible atypical (overeating or oversleep-\ning), 10.3% possible melancholic (undereating or under-\nsleeping), 26.7% mixed (overeating/undersleeping or over-\nsleeping/undereating), and 2.2% nonvegetative (no vegetative\nsymptoms reported).\nThe NCS was a broad survey that assessed a wide range of char-\nacteristics related to mental health. The present study used a\nsubset of these characteristics to compare the atypical depres-\nsion group with the nonatypical depression and the no disor-\nders groups. Six types of characteristics were selected: (1) de-\nmographics, (2) comorbid psychiatric disorders, (3) depressive\nsymptoms, (4) use of health care services, (5) history of abuse\nand parental depression, and (6) disability days and restricted\nactivity days. Specific variables within these categories are de-\nscribed in the following paragraphs.\nDemographic Characteristics\nSex, ethnicity (white, African American, Latino, or other), level\ntus (currently married, divorced/separated, or never married)\nwere examined. The respondents' age and their age of onset of\nthe first depressive episode were also examined.\nPsychiatric Comorbidities\nThe atypical and nonatypical groups were compared in terms\nof their comorbidity with other DSM-III-R disorders as as-\nsessed by means of the CIDI. These analyses examined preva-\nlence of the following diagnoses within the year before com-\npleting the survey: dysthymia, manic episode, panic disorder,\nagoraphobia, simple phobia, social phobia, generalized anxi-\nety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, drug dependence,\nand alcohol dependence.\nDepression-Related Symptoms\nThe atypical and nonatypical groups were compared with re-\nspect to a number of depressive symptoms to provide a more\nthorough picture of atypical depression. These symptoms in-\nclude periods of 2 weeks or more with decreased energy, an-\nhedonia, feelings of worthlessness, and difficulty concentrat-\ning. In addition, suicidality was assessed with items asking\nwhether respondents had ever attempted suicide, thought about\ncommitting suicide, or had a period of 2 weeks or more when\nthey felt like they wanted to die.\nUse of Health Care Services\nSeveral items were selected from the NCS to compare the use of\nhealth care services of subjects with atypical depression, non-\natypical depression, and no psychiatric diagnoses. These yes-\nor-no items asked whether the respondent had seen various types\nof health care professionals or received various types of treat-\nments for \"emotions, nerves, or use of alcohol or drugs.\" For the\ncurrent study, items were selected that assessed whether respon-\ndents had ever been admitted for a night in the hospital, seen any\nhealth care professional, or been to the hospital emergency de-\npartment. Additional items were selected to assess use of health\ncare services within the year before the survey. These questions\nasked whether respondents had seen a general practitioner, a psy-\nchiatrist, a psychologist, a social worker, or a counselor; taken\nany prescription or antidepressant medication; and felt that they\nmight need to see a professional.\nHistory of Abuse and Parental Depression\nFive items were selected from the NCS to compare rates of abuse\nhistory and parental depression of subjects with atypical de-\npression, nonatypical depression, and no psychiatric diag-\nnoses. Three items asked whether respondents were ever \"physi-\ncally abused,\" \"seriously neglected,\" or \"sexually molested\" as\na child. Two items asked whether the respondent's natural\nmother or father \"ever have periods lasting 2 weeks or more\nwhen she/he was depressed, down in the dumps, or blue most\nof the time?\" A composite variable was then created from these\nquestions to assess whether either parent had a history of de-\npression.\nDisability Days and Restricted Activity Days\nA series of 4 questions assessed disability days and restricted\nactivity days, quantifying respondents' decreases in activity level\nduring the 30 days before completing the survey. Disability days\nwere defined as the number of days respondents were \"totally\nunable to carry out normal activities,\" including work and lei-\nsure activities. Restricted activity days were defined as the num-\nber of days respondents were \"able to work and carry out your\nnormal activities, but had to cut down on what you did or did\nnot get as much done as usual.\" For each question, a fol-\nlow-up item queried, \"How many of these days were due to your\nemotions, nerves, mental health, or use of alcohol or drugs?\"\nThe present analyses were conducted using respondents from\nthe NCS sample who fit into the following 3 study groups: atypi-\ncal depression, nonatypical depression, and no psychiatric dis-\norders. Analyses of items that appeared in Part 1 of the NCS\n(demographics, psychiatric comorbidities, and depression-\nrelated symptoms) were conducted on a sample of 4907 par-\nticipants from the total NCS sample who fit into the following\natypical depression, and 4071 with no disorder. Analyses of items\nthat appeared in Part 2 of the NCS (use of health care services\nand disability and restricted activity days) were conducted on\nnonatypical depression, and 1969 with no disorder.\nDescriptive statistics were calculated. For continuous vari-\nables, means and SDs are reported. For categorical variables, per-\ncentages for each study group are reported. To assess whether\nthe atypical depression group differed from each of the 2 com-\nparison groups with respect to the demographic variables of sex,\nrace, education, and marital status, 2 analyses were performed.\nSeparate sets of logistic regressions were used to compare\nthe atypical depression group with the nonatypical depression\nand no disorders groups for dichotomous dependent vari-\nables. These analyses examined group differences in comor-\nbidity, depressive symptoms, use of health care services, abuse\nhistory, and parental history of depression while controlling\nfor sex, race (white or nonwhite), and education (12 or 12\nyears). Each equation contained a dichotomous depression vari-\nable as a predictor (coded as 1 for atypical depression and 0\nfor the comparison group). Odds ratios (ORs), 95% confi-\ndence intervals (CIs), and significance levels are reported.

For example, some\ncases of atypical depression may be a form of traumatic\nstress reaction, with symptoms that are distinct from post-\ntraumatic stress disorder. Because the NCS assessed per-\nsonal history with general retrospective questions, how-\never, current findings should be interpreted with caution,\nand further research is needed to draw conclusions about\netiology.\nA limitation of the current study involves the diag-\nnostic criteria used to identify the atypical depression\ngroup. The atypical depression group was identified\naccording to the 2 reversed vegetative symptoms,\nhypersomnia and hyperphagia. Although some previous\nstudies have used this reversed vegetative diagnostic\napproach,6,7,39 the DSM-IV and most clinical studies use\nthe relatively complex Columbia criteria,17 which\ninclude 3 additional symptoms: mood reactivity, leaden\nparalysis, and rejection sensitivity. Because the NCS did\nnot assess these 3 symptoms, it is not possible to evalu-\nate the consistency between the present study's atypical\ngroup and a group identified according to the DSM-IV\ncriteria for depression with atypical features. It is likely\nthat the reversed vegetative classification system\nresulted in a number of false-positive (ie, subjects in the\natypical depression group who would not meet DSM-IV\ncriteria) and false-negative findings (ie, subjects not\nincluded in the atypical depression group who would\nmeet DSM-IV criteria). Despite this diagnostic limita-\ntion, however, the current results suggest 2 justifica-\ntions for using the reversed vegetative criteria when it is\nnot possible to evaluate all 5 atypical features in the\nColumbia criteria. First, the atypical depression group\nin the present study is similar in several respects to\natypical groups defined in previous samples using the\nColumbia criteria, suggesting substantial overlap\nbetween patients identified with the 2 approaches. Sec-\nond, the reversed vegetative approach identified a clini-\ncally meaningful group with increased distress, comor-\nbidity, disability, and suicidal risk compared with other\npeople with depression.\nBoth the Columbia criteria and the reversed vegeta-\ntive approach have strengths. The Columbia system has\na history of careful empirical development,17 and it may\nhave greater diagnostic precision because it assesses subtle\nemotional symptoms. In clinical settings, however, this\ndiagnostic complexity is likely to be an advantage only\nfor practitioners who are adequately trained to inter-\nview patients about psychiatric characteristics such as\nmood reactivity and rejection sensitivity. In contrast, the\nrelative simplicity of the reversed vegetative approach may\nbe a significant advantage in primary care medical set-\ntings, where atypical depression is frequently unrecog-\nnized.23,24 Compared with the Columbia criteria's subtle\nemotional characteristics, the 2 reversed vegetative symp-\ntoms are objectively defined and easy to identify. If these\nrelatively simple features can truly identify atypical de-\npression with reasonable accuracy as suggested by cur-\nrent findings, inclusion of these features in mental health\nscreenings may improve the recognition and treatment\nof atypical depression in clinical settings.\nThe current study has 2 additional limitations as-\nsociated with the NCS assessment procedures. First, di-\nagnoses made with the fully structured interview used\nin the NCS may not be consistent with clinical assess-\nments,49 and therefore, results should be interpreted with\ncaution. Second, the NCS data set does not include suf-\nficient information to examine the overlap between atypi-\ncal depression and the full range of bipolar disorders. The\nNCS includes diagnosis of manic episodes, and a small\nproportion of the depressed sample in the current study\nmet criteria for bipolar I disorder (weighted percent-\nages: 9.6% had a manic episode in past year; 10.4%,\nlifetime). Several studies suggest, however, that atypical\nfeatures may be associated with bipolar II disor-\npomanic episodes, it is not possible to identify partici-\npants who meet bipolar II criteria.\nAtypical Depression\nNonatypical Depression\nNo Disorder\nMean No. of Days During the Past Month\nA\nAtypical Depression\nNonatypical Depression\nNo Disorder\nMean No. of Days During the Past Month\nB\nFigure 2.

These in-\ncreased risks, including relatively high suicide rates, un-\nderscore the importance of recognizing and effectively\ntreating patients with atypical depression. Based on the\ncurrent findings, a diagnostic approach involving only\nthe 2 reversed vegetative symptoms appear to be a rea-\nsonably accurate screening strategy for identifying the\natypical subgroup among depressed patients who pre-\nsent in general practice settings.\nThis study was supported by Organon, West Orange,\nWe thank Christine Thompson for statistical pro-\ngramming and Robyn Amos, Emmanuel Holder, Melissa\nKuehn, and Jodi Shorr for production assistance.
