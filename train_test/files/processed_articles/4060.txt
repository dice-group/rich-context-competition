The phenotypic traits that women are attracted to when they are\nin the most fertile part of the cycle tend to differ from the traits they are attracted to when\nless fertile. For example, during the fertile phase, women are more attracted to masculine\nfaces (Penton-Voak and Perrett, 2000: Penton-Voak et al., 1999), masculine bodies (Little,\ndominance behaviors (Gangestad, Garver-Apgar, Simpson, and Cousins, 2007), and the\nscent of symmetrical men (Havlicek, Roberts, and Flegr, 2005; Thornhill et al., 2003).\nTaken as a whole, the evidence suggests that when women are in the fertile part of their\nMate value and cyclic preferences\ncycle they are more attracted to phenotypic characteristics associated with masculine traits\nindicating long-term health (Rhodes, Chan, Zebrowitz, and Simmons, 2003) and greater\nreproductive success (Mueller and Mazur, 1998; Pawlowski, Dunbar, and Lipowicz, 2000).\nGangestad and his colleagues have proposed that the fluctuation in preferences\nacross the menstrual cycle may promote the use of a mixed mating strategy in which a\nwoman pursues both a long-term relationship and, on occasion, short-term extra pair\nrelationships (Gangestad and Thornhill, 1998; Gangestad, Thornhill and Garver-Apgara,\n2010). When employing a mixed mating strategy, women place more emphasis on cues\nassociated with genetic quality with short-term mate than with the long-term mate because\nthe short-term mate has the opportunity to contribute genetic material but limited time to\ncontribute resources. Although the mixed mating strategy provides many women with\naccess to high quality genetic material (than she might have been able to obtain in a long-\nterm relationship), the strategy is also associated with costs such as aggression and\nabandonment from the long-term mate (e.g., Cousins and Gangestad, 2007). Consequently,\nwomen employing a mixed strategy should pursue high genetic value short-term mates\nwhen they are fertile to accrue genetic benefits and eschew short-term mating when they\nare less fertile to avoid the costs (Gangestad, Garver-Apgar, Simpson, and Cousins, 2007).\nThe effect of the fluctuations in mate preferences across the menstrual cycle may\nmotivate women to mate with men who have higher quality genes than her partners when\nshe is fertile. That is, the phenotypic markers of genetic quality become more attractive\nwhen she is in the fertile phase of her cycle and most likely to benefit from the high quality\ngenes. The reduced interest in phenotypic markers of genetic quality during the infertile\nphase would reduce the likelihood of infidelity during the time when the potential costs out\nweight the benefits. Taken together, these hormonally induced changes in preferences\nwould allow a woman to obtain high quality genes while maintaining the benefits of a long-\nterm relationship (Penton-Voak et al., 1999). Consistent with this reasoning, a number of\nstudies have already found that women demonstrate more interest in extra pair partners\nwhen they are fertile (Bellis and Baker, 1990; Gangestad, Thornhill, and Garver, 2002;\nMate Value and Cyclic Preferences\nInherent in Gangestad and his colleague's reasoning about cyclic changes in mate\npreferences is the proposition that the mixed mating strategy would be most adaptive for\nwomen who are unable to obtain mates that are high in both genetic quality and resources.\nWomen who can attract both high genetic quality and resource rich males for long-term\nrelationship have less need to acquire high quality genetic material through short-term\nmating. For this type of woman, the costs incurred from infidelity are less likely to\noutweigh the genetic benefits. An individual difference that is likely to play a pivotal role\nin woman's ability to attract high quality mates is mate value (Fisher, Cox, Bennett, and\nGarvik, 2008). Although there are a variety of different definitions of mate value, most\nconceptualizations suggest that mate value is determined by observable characteristics that\nindicate the persons quality as a sexual partner (Kirsner, Figueredo, and Jacobs, 2003) and\nability to increase the reproductive success of mates (Sugiyama, 2005; Waynforth, 2001).\nNot surprisingly, research has already demonstrated that a woman's mate value influences\nmany male behaviors and emotions, e.g., mate retention behaviors (Jones, Figueredo,\nDickey, and Jacobs, 2007; Miner, Starratt, and Shackelford, 2009) and jealousy (Phillips,\nMate value and cyclic preferences\n2010). Further, numerous studies have found a woman's perceived attractiveness influences\nher mate preferences (e.g., Feinberg et al., 2012; Little and Mannion, 2006; Penton-Voak\nIt seems very probable that women who are low in mate value will have more\ndifficulty in attracting long-term mates that possess both genetic quality and resources than\nwomen high in mate value. Hence, for low mate value females it may be adaptive to pursue\na mixed strategy forming long-term relationships with lower genetic quality males and\npursuing high genetic quality males for extra pair couplings. For these women, this is the\nbest way to obtain the benefits of a long-term relationship and obtain high quality genetic\nmaterial. Alternatively, females high in mate value who are more able to obtain long-term\nmates with both genetic quality and resources would benefit less from a employing a mixed\nmating strategy. Consistent with this reasoning physically attractive women express higher\nstandards for both indicators of genetic quality and indicators of investment than less\nIf cycle changes in mate preference at least partially motivate a mixed mating\nstrategy then the strength of the fluctuations in mate preferences across the menstrual cycle\nmay vary depending on mate value. Females low in mate value who benefit from pursuing\na mixed mating strategy may experience stronger fluctuation than females high in mate\nvalue who benefit less from pursuing a mixed strategy. With a low mate value woman, an\nincrease in attraction to cues of genetic quality when fertile would motivate her to pursue\nher best mating strategy. In other words, she would be motivated to mate with men who\nhave higher quality genetic material than her partners when she can obtain the benefit of\nthe high quality genes. On the other hand, high mate value women who have the ability to\nobtain long-term mates that possess both cues of genetic quality and resources may have\nless fluctuation in their mate preferences. Consistent with this reasoning, Feinberg et al.\n(2006) has already found that women indicate a stronger preference for masculine voices\nduring the fertile part of the cycle and that this shift is weaker for feminine women (women\nwith above average concentrations of E3G hormone) than for less feminine women (below\naverage concentrations of E3G hormone).\nCurrent Research\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the moderating influence of mate value\nand fertility status on women's preferences for male traits associated with genetic quality.\nBased on past findings, the researcher expected that women in the fertile part of their cycle\nwould indicate a stronger preference for traits associated with genetic quality than during\nthe non-fertile part of their cycle. In addition, the researcher hypothesized that the woman's\nmate value would moderate this relationship. Specifically, the cycle changes in preferences\nfor characteristics associated with high quality genetic material would be stronger for\nwomen low in mate value. That is, a low mate value woman during the non-fertile part of\nher cycle would experience an actual reduction in desire for traits associated with genetic\nquality. To test these predictions, college age female participants completed two measures\nof mate value and a self-report measure designed to assess fertility status. Following this,\nthe experimenter measured the participants' responses to a male trait related to genetic\nquality (muscles). Muscularity was chosen because it acts as a genetic quality cue.\nMuscularity is associated with high levels of testosterone (Storer et al., 2003; Wang et al.,\n2000; for a review, see Bhasin, 2003) that may signal a more robust immune system. In\nMate value and cyclic preferences\naddition, muscularity indicates that the male can afford a costly trait, i.e., muscularity\nrequires high-energy demands in terms of calories (Frederick and Haselton, 2007). Further,\nnumerous studies have indicated that muscularity is a partially inherited trait with\nMethodological strategy\nMost of the research examining female mate preferences has focused on explicit\nratings of the attractiveness of stimuli (notable exceptions to are Rosen and Lopez's [2009]\nwork on attentional bias and Johnston, Miles, and MacRae's [2008] work on facial\nperception). Typically, researchers have varied characteristics of a potential mate (e.g.\nvoices, faces) and then collected overt ratings or behavioral measures of attraction. Yet for\nthe most part, the complex evolved psychological mechanisms that direct mate preferences\nare believed to operate automatically and wield their influence without consciousness\nawareness (Buss, 2005; Cosmides and Tooby, 1995). Given the hidden nature of many of\nthese mechanisms, persons may have difficulty providing accurate information and their\nexplicit ratings may be particularly susceptible to a variety of self-report biases produced\nby the woman's social environment (Sprecher and Regan, 2002). For example, in the\ncurrent study, it is possible that overt ratings of the male characteristic made by the\nparticipants simply represent strategic shifts in self-reports. Women low in mate value\ncompared to women high in mate value may consciously lower their expectations about\npotential mates because they realize that they will be unable to obtain mates with certain\nhigh value traits. To overcome this type of self-report bias and to tap into the hidden\npsychological mechanisms governing mate preferences, the present research employed an\nimplicit association measure of desirability in addition to the traditional self-report\nmeasure. Implicit responses were measured because they occur without conscious control\nor conscious cognitive effort (Greenwald and Banaji, 1995; Rudman, 2004; Wilson,\nLindsey, and Schooler, 2000) and, therefore, factors in the social environment are much\nless likely to influence implicit responses (Greenwald, Poehlman, Uhlmann, and Banaji,\n2009). If women in the study were accurately stating their preferences for the male trait\nthen the hypothesized pattern of preferences should occur with both the explicit and\nimplicit measures.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nParticipants were 147 women recruited from a large urban university in the\nsouthwestern United States. The study employed an electronic signup procedure operated\nby the psychology department to recruit participants who reported that they were normally\novulating (e.g., not using oral contraceptives). The study offered no monetary\ncompensation to the participants but did give the participants the opportunity to earn class\ncredit. The average age of the participants was 20 and the range of ages was 18 years to 32\nyears of age. Sixty-two percent of the participants were of European descent, 20% were of\nHispanic descent, 16% were of Asian descent, and 2% were from other groups. The\nexperimenter dropped six participants from the study because they were unable to provide\naccurate information about their menstrual cycles.\nMate value and cyclic preferences\nStimulus Material\nIn order to present a trait related to male physical strength, a large pool of\nphotographs depicting a male's flexed arm and shoulder against a neutral background were\ncollected from open sources on the Internet. The stimulus pictures were all of arms from\nmales of European descent. The experimenter excluded photographs depicting male arms\nthat were extremely developed or underdeveloped. In a pilot study, ten female participants\nrated each of the arms depicted in the photographs on three scales with endpoints of 1\n(weak) and 7(strong), 1 (poorly built) and 7 (well built), and 1 (puny) and 7 (muscular).\nEight photographs that depicted arms that were judged as strong (M = 6.41), well built (M\n= 6.51), and muscular (M = 6.71) and eight photographs that depicted arms judged as weak\nProcedure\nWhen the participant arrived at the experimental room, the experimenter informed\nher that the purpose of the study was to measure impressions about a number of different\nphysical characteristics. In the study, the participants would be required to perform a\nreaction time task that focused on a specific physical characteristic and then make a number\nof ratings of the physical characteristic. The experimenter reassured the participant that her\nresponses would be completely confidential and asked her to sit at a computer that\npresented the experimental materials. The computer sequentially presented the participant\nwith all of the experimental materials.\nImplicit measure\nFollowing the introduction, participants completed an implicit measure designed to\nassess their positive associations with muscular male arms. The current study employed the\nmost commonly used implicit measure, the Implicit Association Test, developed by\nGreenwald and his colleagues (Greenwald, McGhee, and Schwartz, 1998). The Implicit\nAssociations Test rests upon the assumption that it is easier to make the same behavioral\nresponse (a key press) to concepts that are strongly associated in memory than to concepts\nweakly associated in memory. Typically, the implicit associations test presents positive and\nnegative words (pictures) and representations of the object. If a person responds quicker\nwhen positive words and the object require the same behavioral response, then the test\nassumes that he/she implicitly associates positive affect with the object. There is\nconsiderable evidence that supports the validity of the Implicit Associations Test (see\nGreenwald, Poehlman, Uhlmann, and Banaji, 2009 for a review).\nDuring each trial, the Implicit Associations Test presented a single image or word at\nthe center of a computer screen. The word presented at the center of the screen was either a\npositive word (e.g., splendid, noble, worthy), a negative word (e.g., awful, vile, rotten), or\none of 16 photographs depicting either a muscular or non-muscular male arm. Each time a\nword or image appeared the participant was required to press a computer key to classify the\nword or image. The Implicit Associations Test had two phases. In the first phase,\nparticipants completed 40 trials in which they had to press the z key if the word was\npositive (e.g., splendid) or if there was a picture depicting a muscular male arm.\nAlternatively, if the word at the center of the screen was negative (e.g. awful) or there was\na non-muscular male arm, they were instructed to press the 2 key on the keyboard's number\nMate value and cyclic preferences\npad. Prior to the first phase, participants completed three practice blocks. Participants\ncompleted twenty practice trials to learn the concept dimension (muscular/non-muscular),\ncategorizing the photographs, by pressing either the z or 2 keys, 20 trials to learn the\nattribute dimension (positive/negative), and 20 trials to practice categorizing both the words\nand photographs.\nIn the second phase, the Implicit Associations Test reverses the keys used to\nclassify positive and negative words. In this phase, the participants completed 40 trials in\nwhich they had to press the z key if the word was negative or if there was a photograph of a\nmuscular male arm and to press the 2 key if the word was positive or a picture of non-\nmuscular male arm. Prior to the second phase, participants completed two practice blocks.\nParticipants completed 20 practice trials to learn to switch the concept dimension\n(muscular/non-muscular) and 20 trials to practice categorizing both words and\nphotographs. The order of key positions was counterbalanced for each phase. The Implicit\nAssociations Test determines the strength of the positive or negative associations with the\nphotographs by examining the difference in latencies between the two phases. That is, were\nparticipants quicker when pressing the same key for positive words/muscular arms and\nnegative words/non-muscular arms or were they quicker when this was reversed (negative\nwords/muscular arms and positive words/non-muscular arms)?\nMenstrual cycle survey\nFollowing the implicit measure, the study used a procedure developed by\nLukaszewski and Roney (2009) to obtain menstrual cycle information. This procedure\nasked each participant to answer three questions: (a) the first day of her last menstrual\nbleeding, (b) to estimate the number of days until her expected next episode of bleeding,\nand (c) estimate duration of her typical cycle. If the participant's information is accurate,\nthe reported cycle day should be equal to the typical cycle length minus the number of days\nuntil the next anticipated cycle. If the participant's cycle day estimate was more than five\ndays from what the formula would predict it was assumed that the participant was\nproviding inaccurate information and she was dropped from further consideration in the\nstudy.\nParticipants were considered in the high fertility part of the cycle during the five\ndays prior to ovulation and the day of ovulation because these are the days in which\nconception is most likely to occur (Wilcox, Weinberg, and Baird, 1998; Wilcox, Duncan,\nWeinberg, Trussell, and Baird, 2001). To estimate the day of ovulation, a backward\ncounting method was used in which ovulation was determined by counting back 14 days\nfrom the onset of the next menstrual cycle. Counting backward from the beginning of the\nnext menstrual cycle provides estimates that are more accurate because the luteal phase is\nless variable than the follicular phase (Baird et al., 1995; Fehring Schneider, and Raviele,\n2006). For example, this method defines days 9\u00ad14 as the high fertility part of the cycle in\na 28-day menstrual cycle. The method adds or subtracts days for women with longer or\nshorter cycles. For example, a woman with a 30-day cycle would be defined as fertile in\ndays 10-15. Days outside of the six-day fertility window are defined as the low fertility part\nof the cycle (see R\u00f6der, Brewer, and Fink [2009] and Schwarz and Hassebrauck [2008] for\nsimilar procedures). In the current study, 31 women were identified as being in the fertile\npart of their cycle.\nMate value and cyclic preferences\nMeasurement of mate value\nParticipants completed two measures of mate value. The first measure was the\nmulti-dimensional measure of mate value inventory (MVI) developed by Kirsner,\nFigueredo, and Jacobs (2003). The Mate Value Inventory requires the participant to\nindicate the extent to which 17 attributes apply to herself on seven point scales with end\npoints of 1 (extremely low on this trait) and 7 (extremely high on this trait). Each of the\nattributes presented in the scale relate to a characteristic that would be of interest to a\nromantic partner, e.g., intelligent, healthy, attractive face, and faithfulness. The scale has\nbeen used extensively to measure mate value (e.g., Jones et al., 2007) and has demonstrated\nacceptable inter-item reliability in past research (\u00b7 = .78, Jones et al., 2007 and \u00b7 = .83,\nFisher, Cox, Bennett, and Garvik, 2008). In the current study the inter-item reliability was\n.79. The second measure was the Self-Perceived Mating Success Scale (SPMS) was\ndeveloped by Landolt, Lalumi\u00e9re, and Quinsey (1995). The Self-Perceived Mating Success\nScale requires the participant to indicate the extent to which she agrees with eight\nstatements about herself on seven point scales with end-points of 1 (disagree) and 7 (agree).\nEach of the statements describes how members of the opposite sex react to her (e.g.,\nmembers of the opposite sex notice me, I receive sexual invitations from members of the\nopposite sex, and members of the opposite sex are attracted to me). This scale has also been\nwidely used to measure mate value (e.g., Penke, and Denissen, 2008; Massar, Buunk and\nDechesne, 2009) and has demonstrated adequate inter-item reliability (\u00b7 = 0.83, Landolt,\nLalumi\u00e9re, and Quinsey, 1995). In the current study the inter-item reliability was .81.\nMeasuring female mate value can potentially be difficult because mate value may\nvary across the menstrual cycle. For example, Beaulieu (2007) found that women during\nthe high fertile phase might place more emphasis on physical appearance in mate value\nassessments. To minimize this problem the two mate-value measures were administered\nwhen the woman was in the non-fertile part of her cycle. To accomplish this, women who\nwere in the fertile part of the cycle during the experimental session were re-contacted when\nthey were in the non-fertile part of their cycles and asked to fill out the mate value\nmeasures. In addition, they were asked to indicate their day in their monthly cycle and\nwhen their most recent menstruation had occurred. This information was used to verify the\naccuracy of their original estimates.\nExplicit measures\nAfter completing the menstrual cycle and mate value questionnaires, the\nparticipants were asked to give explicit self-reports about the arms depicted in the\nphotographs. Each of the 16 photographs was presented to the participants in random order\nand they were asked to rate the attractiveness of each of the arms on three scales with\nendpoints of 1 (undesirable) and 7 (desirable), 1 (unattractive) and 7 (attractive), and 1\n(ugly) and 7 (beautiful). In addition the participants were asked to rate the strength of each\nof the arms presented in the photographs on three scales with endpoints of 1 (weak) and 7\n(strong), 1 (poorly built) and 7 (well built), and 1 (puny) and 7 (muscular). Then the\nparticipants were asked to indicate their relationship status, age, ethnic origin, and if they\nhad any children. Finally, the experimenter questioned the participant about her\nunderstanding of the experimental hypotheses and then fully debriefed the participant.\nMate value and cyclic preferences\nResults\nControl analyses\nIn order to confirm that the participants perceived the muscular arms as stronger\nthan the non-muscular arms the three ratings of arm strength were averaged to form a\nsingle index (Cronbach's \u00b7 = .84). This index was analyzed in a one factor (muscular vs.\nnon-muscular picture) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Consistent with\nthe results of the pretest, participants rated the photographs of the muscular arms as\nsignificantly stronger (M = 5.26, SD = 1.05) than the photographs of the non-muscular arms\nanalyses of variance indicated that were no significant differences between the fertile\nwomen and less fertile women in terms of their age (p = .54) and the number of children (p\nD-scores\nThe data from the Implicit Associations Test was scored using the D-score\nalgorithm. The procedure discards the trials longer than 10,000 ms and participants who\ncompleted more than ten percent of trials in less than 300 ms. After these corrections, each\nparticipant's average response time from phase one (same key press for positive words and\nmuscular arms) was subtracted from phase two (same key press for negative words and\nmuscular arms). This difference was divided by the standard deviations of the responses in\nboth phases (see Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji (2003) for a more detailed description of\nthis procedure). Accordingly, a larger D-score indicates a more positive evaluation\nassociated with the arms (remember that shorter reaction times indicate a stronger\nassociation).\nImplicit associations\nThe main hypothesis stated that a woman's mate value would moderate the\nrelationship between fertility and preferences for characteristics associated with high\nquality genetic material (muscular arms). To examine this hypothesis, the d-scores from the\nImplicit Associations Test were analyzed in a three-step hierarchical regression analysis.\nIn this analysis, three regressions were performed in which Mate Value Inventory scores,\nfertility status, and the interaction term (mate value X fertility status) were added into the\nequations used to predict Implicit Associations Test d-scores. The interaction term was\ncreated by multiplying the participant's Mate Value Inventory score by her fertility status\n(see Aiken and West [1991] for a description of this procedure). Consistent with past\nresearch, the addition of fertility status to the model containing the Mate Value Inventory\nproduced a significant increase in prediction (R2 = .08, p < .01). Women in the fertile part\nof their cycle associated more positivity with muscular arms than when they were in the\nless fertile part of their cycle. Further, as hypothesized, the addition of the interaction term\n(mate value X fertility status) produced a significant increase in prediction over the main\neffects model (R2 = .07, p < .001), and the interaction term in the final model was a\n1 One participant failed to complete the rating of the muscularity of the arms in the photographs and was not\nincluded in this analysis.\nMate value and cyclic preferences\nTable 1. Summary of hierarchical regression analysis examining the relationship of the\nmate value (Mate Value Inventory), fertility status, and the interaction of mate value X\nfertility status to positive implicit associations with muscular arms.\nVariable B SE B \nTo explore the nature of the interaction between mate-value and fertility status,\nvalues were plotted for participants who were high and low in fertility and were at one SD\nabove and one SD below the mean mate value rating. For women low in mate-value (-1\nSD), there was a significant difference between the high and low fertility predicted values,\nThat is, low mate value women had significantly less positive implicit responses to the\nmuscular arms when they were low in fertility than when they were high in fertility. For\nwomen high in mate value (+1 SD) there was no significant difference between the high\nand low fertility values, b = .03, t = .47, p >.05. That is, high mate-value women did not\nhave less positive implicit responses when they were low in fertility (see Figure 1).\nThe same set of analyses was conducted using the Self-Perceived Mate Value scale.\nThese analyses produced findings that were similar to the set of findings produce by the\nMate Value Inventory. The addition of fertility status to the model containing Self-\nPerceived Mate Value produced a significant increase in prediction (R2 = .15, p < .01) and\nthe addition of the interaction term (mate value X fertility status) produced a significant\nincrease in prediction over the main effects model, R2 = .06, p < .01 (see Table 2).\nMate value and cyclic preferences\nFigure 1. The relationship of fertility and positive associations with muscular arms at low\nmate-value (Mate Value Inventory 1 SD below mean) and high mate value (Mate Value\nInventory 1 SD above mean). Larger D-Scores indicate more preference for muscularity.\nFor a woman low in mate-value (-1 SD) there was a significant difference between\nthe high and low fertility predicted values, b = .40, t = 6.49, p < .01, and for women high in\nmate value this difference disappeared, b = .08, t = 1.15, p > .05 (see Figure 2).\nExplicit ratings\nEach participant's responses to the three questions about the attractiveness\n(desirability, attractiveness, and beauty) of each of the 16 photographs depicting muscular\nand non-muscular arms were summed to form a single index with a range of 3 to 21\n(Cronbach's \u00b7 = .89). Then, for each participant, this index was used to calculate a mean\nrating of the eight muscular arms as well as a mean rating of eight non-muscular arms and a\ndifference score was created for each participant by subtracting her mean rating of non-\nmuscular arms from her mean rating of the muscular arms. Larger difference scores\nindicate a more positive evaluation. There was only a modest correlation between the\nexplicit difference score measure and the implicit difference score measure (r = .37). This\nMate value and cyclic preferences\nfinding replicates the general pattern of divergent validity for implicit responses found in\nthe extant literature (e.g., McConnell, Rydell, Strain, and Mackie, 2008). These difference\nscores were analyzed with the same three-step hierarchical regression analyses that were\nused with the implicit measure.\nFigure 2. The association of fertility status and positive associations with muscular arms at\nlow mate-value (Self-Perceived Mate Scale one SD below the mean) and high mate value\n(SPMS one SD above the mean). Larger D-Scores indicate more implicit preference for\nmuscularity.\nConsistent with past research, the addition of fertility status to the model containing\nmate value (Mate Value Inventory) produced a significant increase in prediction (R2 =\n.40, p < .001). Women rated muscular arms as more attractive when they were in the fertile\npart of their cycle (M = 12.31) than when they were in the less fertile part of their cycle (M\n= 5.33). However, the addition of the interaction term (mate value X fertility status) failed\nto produce a significant increase in prediction over the main effects model (p = .75). For\nwomen in the fertile part of their cycle there were no differences in the predicted value\nvalue women (+ 1 SD). Similarly, for women in the less fertile part of their cycle there\nwere no differences in the predicted value (5.33) for low mate value women (-1 SD)\nwomen and the predictive value (5.56) for high mate value women (+ 1 SD). The same\npattern of results was obtained when the Self-Perceive Mate Value measure of mate value\nMate value and cyclic preferences\nwas used in these analyses. The addition of fertility status to the model containing Self-\nPerceive Mate Value increased the predictive power of the model (R2 = .38, p < .001) and\nthe addition of the interaction term did not increase prediction (p = .97). For women in the\nfertile part of their cycle there were no differences in the predicted value (12.01) for low\nmate value women (-1 SD) and the predictive value (13.00) for high mate value women (+\n1 SD). Similarly, for women in the less fertile part of their cycle there were no differences\nbetween low mate value (-1 SD) predicted values (5.13) and high mate value (+ 1 SD)\nDiscussion\nThe study replicated the influence of the menstrual cycle on women's mate\npreferences found in the extant literature. With both the implicit and explicit measures,\nwomen during the fertile part of their cycles associated more positivity with characteristics\nlinked to quality genetic material. Further, the findings provide partial support for the main\nhypotheses that low mate value women would have more pronounced changes in\npreferences across the menstrual cycle. When the implicit measure was examined, women\nlow in mate value had weaker positive implicit associations with characteristics associated\nwith high quality genetic material when they were in the less fertile part of their cycle and,\nalternatively, with women higher in mate value this reduction in positive associations\nduring the less fertile part of their cycle did not occur. These results are congruent with the\nproposition that a mixed mating strategy (pursuing short-term relationships with high\ngenetic quality males while maintaining long-term relationships with a lower genetic\nquality male) would be most adaptive for low mate value women who are unable to obtain\nmates that are high in both genetic quality and resources. That is, for low mate-value\nwomen, increased attraction to characteristics associated with high quality genetic material\nduring the more fertile part of her cycle would facilitate this strategy. Contrary to the\nexpectations, the study did not find the moderating effect of mate value when explicit\nresponses were measured. Both high and low mate-value women expressed an explicit\npreference for muscular arms.\nWhy did mate value act as a moderator with implicit preferences but not with\nexplicit preferences? One possibility is that the processes involved were operating without\nconscious awareness, limiting the participants' ability to explicitly state preferences.\nRemember that an explicit preference is a positive or negative evaluation that is retrievable\nfrom memory and directs behavior. Whereas an implicit attitude is the product of positive\nor negative associations with an object (muscles) that can no longer actively be retrieved\nfrom memory. This explanation is consistent with the notion that many evolved processes\noperate passively without deliberate thought (Cosmides and Tooby, 1995; Tooby and\nCosmides, 1989). Yet it is puzzling why participants would be able to explicitly state\npreferences influenced by the menstrual cycle but not by mate value. Another possibility\nfor the divergence between implicit and explicit responses is that the participants' were\ngiving socially desirable explicit responses. The women may have believed that expressing\npositive attitudes towards the muscles was the expected or correct response, i.e., normal\nwomen should like muscles. Consequently, both the low and high mate value women gave\npositive explicit ratings of the muscular arms. On the other hand, the Implicit Association\nTest used to measure the women's implicit preferences was able to detect the moderating\nMate value and cyclic preferences\nrole of mate value because the Implicit Association Test is less susceptible to this type of\nsocial desirability distortion (see Cvencek, Greenwald, Brown, Snowden, and Gray [2010]\nand Steffens [2004] for a discussion of Implicit Association Test's resistance to response\ndistortion).\nAlthough this research produced a number of significant findings that are consistent\nwith the hypotheses, issues remain. First, it was difficult to adequately measure mate value\nbecause the construct is not fully explicated in the literature. In the literature, mate value\nhas been conceptualized and measured in a variety of ways; in some research, mate-value is\noperationalized as just a single characteristic (e.g., Beaulieu, 2007) or small set of\ncharacteristics (Graham-Kevan and Archer, 2009), and, in other research, as a multi-\ndimensional construct (e.g., Figueredo, Sefcek, and Jones, 2006). In an effort to overcome\nthis problem and capture the construct, the current study employed two different measures\nof mate value (Mate Value Inventory and the Self-Perceive Mate Value Scale). However,\nboth of the measures used in the current study focused only on self-perceived mate value.\nIs self-perceived mate value accurate and consistent with actual mate value, i.e., how others\nperceived her mate value? Though many researchers have proposed that persons have\nevolved psychological mechanisms to assess their mate value (e.g., Buss and Schmitt,\n1993; Penke, Todd, Lenton, and Fasolo, 2007) and that these mechanisms need to be\naccurate in order to be useful (Kirkpatrick and Ellis, 2001), there is little empirical evidence\ndemonstrating the relationship. Future research should address this relationship.\nAnother limitation of the current study is that fertility status was measured through\nself-reports. The backward counting procedure employed in the current study has been\nused successfully in a number of studies (e.g., Lukaszewski and Roney, 2009) and has a\nbuilt in accuracy check. In an effort to verify the accuracy of the participants' recall, the\nfertile participants were re-contacted and queried about their place in their cycle and their\nmost recent menstruation. The cycle estimates generated from the second session were\ncompared to estimates generated from the initial session. This procedure did not lead to the\nreclassification of any participants as fertile or non-fertile. Yet, it is still possible that there\nwere some reporting errors and a few women were miss-classified into the fertility and low\nfertility conditions. However, it is unlikely that the current findings are the result of miss-\nclassifications because this type of random error would tend to obscure effects. Despite\nthis, an actual hormonal measure has the potential to provide a more accurate classification\nand allow for the exploration of the putative proximal causes of menstrual cycle changes in\nmate preferences.\nFinally, it is important to remember that there may be variables that correlate with\nmate value that have the potential to influence changes in female mate preferences across\nthe menstrual cycle. For example, it is possible that there is a correlation between the size\nof the hormonal shifts across the menstrual cycle and mate value, i.e., low mate value\nwomen may have larger shifts than high mate value women. Thus, it is possible that the\nsize of the hormonal shift is responsible for the differences in mate preferences. Similarly,\nthe menstrual cycle is associated with many changes (e.g., self-perceived attractiveness,\nmood, and facial attractiveness). The influence of these other changes on mate preferences\nis not fully understood. For example, it is possible that changes in self-perceived\nattractiveness across the cycle influences the woman's judgment about her ability to obtain\nhighly desirable mates.\nMate value and cyclic preferences\nConclusions\nThe program of research inspired by evolutionary psychology has focused almost\nexclusively on species typical behavior and has ignored individual differences, with the\nexception of gender differences, despite the vast corpus of evidence demonstrating their\nprofound importance (Buss, 2008a). Recently, in an effort to rectify this omission,\nevolutionary theorists have offered a variety of explanations for the evolution of individual\ndifferences, e.g., cost signaling (Miller, 2007), balancing selection (Penke, Denissen, and\nMiller, 2007), and life history theory (Kaplan and Gangestad, 2005). The next step for\nevolutionary psychologists will be to identify evolutionarily important individual\ndifferences and specify how these differences moderate the relationship between ecological\ninputs and manifest behaviors. The present research, by examining the moderating effects\nof mate value on mate preferences, is part of this quest.\nReferences\nAiken, L., and West, S. (1991).
