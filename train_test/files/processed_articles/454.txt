It has been\nhypothesized that weight misperception among overweight\nand obese individuals may preclude the adoption of health-\nhaps as a result of lower weight loss motivation.\nOverweight and obese individuals who see themselves as\nhealthy weight, for example, might not try to lose weight\nand might be less inclined to eat healthfully and be physi-\ncally active. Surprisingly, however, little is known empiri-\ncally about the influence of weight misperception on\nweight-related attitudes and behaviors among overweight\nand obese individuals; most studies on weight mispercep-\ntion usually only examine prevalence estimates of weight\nmisperception by socio-demographic factors (e.g. gender\nand race/ethnicity). The limited available evidence indicates\nthat inaccurate weight perceptions among overweight and\nobese individuals are associated with weight-related atti-\ntudes (such as eating concern and weight concern) [28]\nand weight-related behaviors (such as fewer weight loss\nphysical activity levels) [29,30] \u00ad key components inhibiting\nweight maintenance and loss. However, some evidence\nindicates that weight misperception among overweight and\nobese individuals might be associated with healthful beha-\nviors (e.g. better diet quality [29], more physical activity\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we sought to\nexamine associations between weight misperception and\nseveral weight-related attitudes and behaviors (i.e. wanting\nto weigh less, having tried to lose weight, dietary intake,\nand physical activity) among overweight and obese US\nadults. We hypothesized that overweight and obese weight\nmisperceivers would have unhealthful weight loss attitudes\nand behaviors (including decreased desire to weigh less,\ndecreased attempts to have tried to lose weight, higher\ncaloric intake and lower physical activity levels).\nMethods\nStudy Design and Population\nData for this study come from the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted by\nthe National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention. NHANES is an on-\ngoing annual survey of health and nutritional status col-\nlected from a stratified, multi-stage probability sample\nof the civilian non-institutionalized US population, with\nan oversampling of targeted groups (including Blacks\nand Mexican-Americans) [33,34]. This study draws from\ntwo consecutive cycles of nationally representative data\n2006. The study population was limited to non-preg-\nnant, overweight and obese (measured body mass index\n[BMI]  25 using the formula: weight in kilograms\ndivided by the square of height in meters; height and\nweight were measured under standard protocols) [35,36]\nadults aged 20 and older. To increase statistical power,\nwe used a three-sample strategy in which the sample\nsize was maximized in for each outcome type. Sample 1\nwas composed of overweight and obese adults who\ncompleted the weight loss attitudes/behaviors survey\nitems (n = 4,784); sample 2 was composed of overweight\nand obese adults who completed the dietary intake sur-\nvey items (n = 4,894); and sample 3 was composed of\noverweight and obese adults who completed the physical\nactivity questionnaire (n = 5,401). This three-sample\nstrategy helps us avoid any bias associated with conduct-\ning a complete case analysis.\nWeight Misperception\nRespondents were asked if they considered themselves\nnow to be \"overweight, underweight, or about the right\nweight.\" Given the restriction of the sample to the over-\nweight and obese, weight misperception (our predictor\nvariable) was determined among those who reported\nthemselves to be \"underweight\" or \"about the right\nweight\"; those who correctly perceived themselves as\noverweight served as the referent group.\nWeight-Related Attitudes and Behaviors\nThree types of weight-related outcomes were examined:\n(1) weight loss attitudes/behaviors, (2) dietary intake and\n(3) physical activity. Weight loss attitudes/behaviors\nwere captured using two binary variables: whether the\nrespondent would like to weigh less (yes/weigh less or\nno/stay about the same), and whether he/she had tried\nto lose weight in the last year (yes/no). The dietary vari-\nable we examined was total energy intake (kcals). Energy\nintake were assessed as continuous variables using 24-\nhour recall data, averaging the values from 2 non-conse-\ncutive days of recall to capture usual intake (day 1 was\nadministered in person during the physical examination,\nwhereas day 2 was administered by phone a few weeks\nlater). Physical activity was assessed using frequency\n(per month), duration (minutes) and intensity (metabolic\nDuncan et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2011, 8:20\nequivalent [MET]) data on specific reported leisure-time\nactivities for each individual. A 3-level variable was\ndefined based on the 2008 U.S. Department of Health\nand Human Services' physical activity guidelines [37],\nwhere \"meets activity recommendations\" was defined as\nachieving 150 minutes/week of moderate intensity phy-\norous intensity physical activity (6.0+ METs) or an\nequivalent combination thereof (500 MET-min/week \n3.0 METs). Those categorized as \"insufficiently active\"\nreported activity that did not exceed the above thresh-\nolds; respondents who did not report any leisure-time\nphysical activity were categorized as \"sedentary.\"\nOther Variables\nOther variables used to define sample subgroups and/or\nas model covariates include: gender (male, female), race/\nethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, or\nHispanic; other groups were excluded due to small sam-\nple sizes), age (years), annual household income (<\ntion (<high school, high school graduate, some college,\ncollege graduate+), marital status (never married,\nwidowed/divorced, married), self-rated health (fair/poor,\ngood, very good/excellent), whether a physician or\nhealth professional had ever told the respondent that\nhe/she was overweight (yes, no) as well as physical activ-\nity and BMI (both previously described).\nStatistical Analyses\nMultivariable regression models were used to examine\nthe association between weight misperception and each\noutcome. The form of regression was dependent on the\ndistribution of the outcome variables. Binary and catego-\nrical variables were modeled using log-Poisson and mul-\ntinomial logistic regression (respectively), whereas\ncontinuous variables were modeled via linear regression.\nLog-Poisson regression results for each binary outcome\nwere exponentiated to a relative risk (RR). Relative risks\n(i.e., prevalence ratios) were calculated rather than odds\nratios because the outcomes (i.e. wanting to weigh less\nand having tried to lose weight) are common among\nour study population of overweight and obese indivi-\nduals; odds ratios are likely to overestimate the effect\nwhen the outcome is common [38-41]. Since the Pois-\nson model specification may overinflate the standard\nerror, we conducted sensitivity analysis using jacknife\nvariance as the robust variance estimator to deflate\nthem, however, the estimates and p values replicated\nwere near identical as our initial standard approach (we\ntherefore present findings from our initial approach).\nMultinomial logistic regression models for the 3-level\nphysical activity outcome variable were used to estimate\nthe likelihood of \"meeting activity recommendations\" or\nbeing \"insufficiently active\" relative to being \"sedentary\"\n(outcome referent) for those who misperceived their\nweight relative to those who correctly perceived their\nweight (exposure referent). We fit multinomial logistic\nregression models as opposed to ordinal logistic regres-\nsion models because the intervals between the 3-level\nphysical activity outcome variable were not equal and\nbecause initial exploratory data analysis revealed that\nthe continuous physical activity variable was heavily\nskewed towards zero and the non-zero observations are\ncontinuous rather than ordinal, making other strategies\ninappropriate. Coefficients from these models were\nexponentiated to obtain estimates of the relative risk of\neach physical activity outcome as a function of weight\nmisperception. Linear regressions produced beta coeffi-\ncients estimating the change in the continuous total\nenergy intake outcome based on weight misperception.\nIn these models, we control for physical activity because\nbecause it is a predictor of dietary intake [42]. We also\nadjust for BMI in all models, given that misperception\nvaries by actual BMI [11] and given that BMI influences\nthe study outcomes [42-44]. All models were conducted\nfor the entire sample as well as stratified by gender and\nrace/ethnicity, since 1) we were interested in parameter\nestimates by gender and race/ethnicity, 2) there\nare gender and racial/ethnic differences in weight mis-\nperception among overweight/obese individuals\nracial/ethnic differences in weight-related attitudes and\nbehaviors among overweight/obese individuals [8,45,46].\nStatistical significance was determined by 95% confi-\ndence intervals (CIs) and p values less than 0.05.

This means that several groups of\nweight misperceivers were less physically active than\nthose who accurately perceived their weight.\nDiscussion\nWeight misperception among overweight and obese\npopulations is of public health and medical significance\nand may limit the effectiveness of weight loss and obe-\nsity prevention efforts. Nearly one-quarter of our repre-\nsentative US sample of overweight and obese adults\nmisperceived their weight status. In this study, over-\nweight and obese individuals who misperceived their\nweight status were less likely to want to lose weight and\nhaving tried to lose weight as compared to overweight\nand obese individuals who accurately perceived their\nweight. This effect was apparent among both men and\nwomen and among all racial/ethnic groups, but was\nespecially pronounced for Black men and women.\nWeight misperception was not a significant predictor of\ndietary behaviors for most subgroups, but was associated\nwith lower total energy intake among Hispanic women.\nAdditionally, men (especially Black men) who misper-\nceived their weight as compared those who accurately\nperceived their weight were less likely to be insuffi-\nciently active compared to being sedentary and women\nwho misperceived their weight as compared to women\nwho accurately perceived their weight were less likely to\nmeet activity recommendations compared to being\nsedentary. Importantly, this is the first study, to the best\nof our knowledge, to have examined weight mispercep-\ntion in relation to a variety of weight-related attitudes\nand behaviors among a nationally representative sample\nof overweight and obese men and women in the US.\nFindings from our study are largely consistent with the\nfew existing studies in this area. Jones et al., for exam-\nple, found that adults with class II obesity (BMI = 35.0-\n39.9) who had inaccurate weight perceptions had less\nweight concern, less distress regarding overeating, less\ndistress regarding control overeating, less emotional\novereating, less eating disinhibition as well as exhibited\na nonsignificant trend toward less time spent dieting\n[28]. Forman et al. found that overweight adults who\nmisperceived themselves as average weight were dieting\nless often than those who correctly perceived their\nweight status [31]. In a study of overweight adolescents\nwith type 2 diabetes, Skinner et al. found that those who\nmisperceived their weight had poorer diet such as\nhigher consumption of sugary drinks, eating fast food,\nhaving unplanned snacks, and overeating along with low\nlevels of physical activity and more sedentary time [30].\nEdwards et al. found that overweight adolescents in the\nYouth Risk Behavior Survey who accurately perceived\ntheir weight were more likely to report trying to lose\nweight as well as more likely to exercise and consume\nfewer calories in the past 30 days, but overweight boys\nwho accurately perceived their weight were also less\nlikely to report achieving recommended levels of fruit/\nvegetable intake and physical activity in the previous\nweek [29]. Taken together, these findings suggest the\nimportance of considering weight perceptions in the\ndesign of future behavioral weight loss interventions.\nTheories of health behavior provide a useful lens to\ninterpret these findings. Several widely used theories\nsuch as the Health Belief Model [47] suggest that per-\nceived susceptibility to a given condition is necessary to\npromote healthful behavior change. Consistent with\nhealth behavior theory, our findings show that mispercei-\nvers are less likely to plan or attempt weight loss, and\nmore likely to overall perform behaviors that increase\ntheir likelihood of experiencing weight gain. One notable\ncaveat is our finding that Hispanic women who misper-\nceived their weight status had lower energy intake than\nthose who correctly perceive their weight. However, our\noverall findings and those of others by and large [28-31]\nsuggest that correcting perception of weight status may\nbe an important consideration in the design of weight\nloss interventions, particularly those conducted among\nhigh-risk subgroups. Intervention efforts are especially\nneeded for overweight and obese men and Black adults,\ngiven the groups' high prevalence of weight mispercep-\nweight and obesity [1], and their consistent and strong\nassociations of weight misperception in relation to\nunhealthful weight-related attitudes and behaviors seen\nin the present study. We also note that the misperception\nthat should cause the greatest concern is that of extre-\nmely obese individuals (almost 50% of our representative\nsample is obese) for whom, independent of racial/ethnic\ngroup, elevated health risks are most certain [48,49].\nWeight misperceptions are potentially modifiable.\nThere are several possible strategies for counteracting\nmisperceptions in the primary care setting and in line\nwith these findings only about 40% of the overweight\nand obese respondents in our sample reported being\ntold by a physician or health professional that they were\noverweight. However, when provider counseling occurs,\nit can be particularly helpful. Several studies have shown\nthat when clinicians advise their obese patients to lose\nweight, there is an increased likelihood of weight loss\nattempts [50,51]. Additionally, the clothing industry\nmight be encouraged to revisit shared clothing sizing\nstandards. The elimination of \"vanity sizing\" (also\nknown as size inflation, whereby clothing size numbers\nscale down over time; e.g. a size 14 becomes a size 10)\n[52] might reduce weight misperception \u00ad as some\nDuncan et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2011, 8:20\nindividuals monitor their weight with clothing sizes [53].\nMarketing campaigns changing societal norms that\nencourage weight misperception also could be imple-\nmented. Such norms exist among men (e.g. overweight\ncertain racial/ethnic minority groups (e.g. Blacks have\ngreater body image satisfaction independent of their\nbody weight [57-61] and maintain a greater social accep-\ntance of heavier body weight) [61-65]. However, it is\nimportant to note that such intervention efforts should\nbe carefully crafted to protect against eating disorders,\nbody image disorders and emotional distress, as these\nresponses may be experienced when weight mispercep-\ntions are corrected.\nWe note that this study also is subject to some limita-\ntions. First, many of the gender- and racial/ethnic-strati-\nfied models yielded wide confidence intervals and null\nassociations (e.g. all models estimating total energy\nintake had very wide confidence intervals and we specu-\nlate the effect estimates from the energy intake models\nare unstable); although we maximized the sample size\nfor each analysis for increased power and to avoid any\nbias by not doing so, lack of power due to smaller sam-\nple sizes in these cells might be implicated in the find-\nings. Second, the cross-sectional design of this study\ndoes not allow causal conclusions to be drawn. How-\never, despite the well-known limitations of cross-sec-\ntional data, our study hypotheses and directionality have\nintuitive appeal and were based on conclusions from\npast theoretical and empirical research. Additionally, we\nrelied on self-reported data on health behaviors (i.e. diet\nand physical activity). Although there can be reliability\nand validity challenges with self-reported dietary and\nphysical activity measures [66-69] (which may be espe-\ncially problematic among overweight and obese indivi-\nduals), this type of data is most commonly used in\npopulation-based health research. We report only on lei-\nsure-time physical activity, which is only one domain of\nphysical activity behavior and may vary by socio-demo-\ngraphic characteristics, especially race/ethnicity [70,71].\nBMI was used in this study, as is commonly done in\npopulation-based research. Nevertheless, previous\nresearch has noted that BMI is an imperfect measure of\nbody composition that does not take into account body\nfat distribution or body fatness (e.g. the ratio of muscle\nto fat) [72], which overweight and obese individuals are\nlikely to take into consideration when determining their\nown weight status [14] and it may vary by gender and\nrace/ethnicity. The possibility of temporal differences in\nthe time since receipt of diagnosis exists because the\nmedical diagnosis of overweight was not time-delimited\n(e.g. prior 12 months). Furthermore, as with all\nobservational studies, the possibility of residual con-\nfounding cannot be eliminated. However, we adjusted\nfor multiple potential confounding variables in this\nstudy. Lastly, Mexicans were largely overrepresented in\nNHANES and therefore these results might not be gen-\neralizeable to other Hispanic subgroups.\nThe outcomes we selected for this study are reflec-\ntive of attitudes and behaviors that are necessary for\nsuccessful weight loss. As such, to enhance the inter-\npretability of our findings, we chose behaviors that are\nmost directly related to weight regulation: total calories\nand energy expenditure (however other behavioral\naspects might be relevant to weight misperception).\nThere is a need for additional research to replicate,\nextend and contextualize our findings. As the few stu-\ndies examining weight misperception in relation to\nweight-related attitudes and behaviors were cross-sec-\ntional, longitudinal study designs are needed to estab-\nlish the temporal ordering of study variables. It is\nimportant to note that weight misperception can be\nexamined in multiple ways [22]. In our study, further-\nmore we do not know what respondents were using as\na reference point when reporting weight status.\nRespondents might have compared themselves with\ntheir personal standards of a desired size (which might\nbe based on cultural ideals and/or the size of their\nfamily or friends), medical standards of a certain\nweight for height (e.g. statements from a physician) or\nsome other standard. Finally, in order to correct\nweight misperception, research is needed to examine\ncauses of weight misperception among overweight and\nobese individuals (which have yet to be fully eluci-\ndated). Social comparison might be an explanation for\nweight misperception. Research indicates that being\nexposed to obesity is associated with greater weight\nmisperception (underestimation) [24] and that\nincreased obesity prevalence rates over the years has\nbeen associated with fewer overweight individuals per-\nceiving themselves as overweight [5,73,74], increased\nbody weight norms [4,73], and increased desired and\nideal weights [25,75]. Additionally, we note that weight\nmisperceptions might differ between groups because\nsome experience a weaker BMI-mortality gradient than\nothers (e.g. obesity\u00aduntil the extreme range\u00adis less\nlethal for Blacks as compared to Whites) [48].\nConclusion\nOverall, we found that weight misperception among\noverweight and obese adults was associated with less\nlikelihood of interest in or attempts at weight loss and\nless physical activity. These associations varied by gen-\nder and race/ethnicity. This study highlights the impor-\ntance of focusing on inaccurate weight perceptions in\nDuncan et al.
