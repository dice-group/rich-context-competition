This research assessed how parents' transfers of sentiment, time, and financial assets to their adolescent/\nyoung adult children affect the children's propensity in middle age to provide social support to their aging parents. We\ntested whether the mechanism of long-term intergenerational exchange is better modeled as a return on investment, an\ninsurance policy triggered by the longevity or physical frailty of parents, or the result of altruistic (or other nonrecipro-\ncal) motivations on the part of adult children.\nMethods. Models were examined with 6 waves of data from the University of Southern California Longitudinal\nStudy of Generations. The sample consisted of 501 children who participated in the 1971 survey and who had at least 1\nparent surviving in 1985. Growth curve modeling was applied to predict average levels and rates of change in social sup-\nport provided to mothers and fathers between 1985 and 1997 as a function of early parental transfers of affection, asso-\nciation, and tangible resources to their children.\nResults. Children who spent more time in shared activities with their mothers and fathers in 1971 provided more\nsupport to them on average. Receiving greater financial support from parents in 1971 raised the marginal rate at which\nsupport provided by children increased over time. Maternal health operated synergistically with early affection to pro-\nduce greater levels of support. Both levels and rates of increase in support from children were positive, even for children\nwho received no early transfers from their parents.\nDiscussion. The results offer some support for investment, insurance, and altruistic models of intergenerational ex-\nchange. Sharing time in activities provides a direct return to the parent that is characteristic of an investment strategy,\nwhereas financial transfers provide a time-contingent return that is characteristic of an insurance mechanism. That affec-\ntion triggers greater support to more functionally impaired mothers suggests that emotionally investing in children as a\nhealth insurance mechanism may be based on the greater moral equity accorded to mothers. The motivation of adult\nchildren to provide social support to their older parents is partially rooted in earlier family experiences and guided by an\nimplicit social contract that ensures long-term reciprocity.\nECIPROCITY in adult parent\u00adchild relations has been\nthe object of much investigation as a principle guiding\ntransfers of time, labor, and financial assets across genera-\ntions. Studies in this area have examined balance or asym-\nmetry in exchanges between generations at one point in time\n(Antonucci, 1990), across a set of repeated cross-sectional\nassessments (Morgan, Schuster, & Butler, 1991), and in the\nsame individuals over time with retrospective reports (Hen-\nretta, Hill, Li, Soldo, & Wolf, 1997; Whitbeck, Simons, &\nConger, 1991). However, a life-course approach stressing\nthe dynamic aspects of reciprocity calls for long-term data\non intergenerational transfers from the same individuals over\ntime. In this investigation we employed longitudinal data\nover 26 years in the lives of two generations to identify how\nparents' investment of sentiment, time, and financial re-\nsources in their adolescent/young adult children affects the\nchildren's propensity in middle age to provide support to\ntheir aging parents more than a quarter century later.\nThis research addressed the basic question of why adult\nchildren provide support to their elderly parents. In the ab-\nsence of bioevolutionary imperatives for such support (re-\nproductive goals are not at issue as they are for parental sup-\nport to children), one is directed toward explanations that\nderive from social theories, particularly as they relate to\nmechanisms of equity and reciprocity in interpersonal ex-\nchanges. We addressed this issue by turning attention to the\nhistorical antecedents of these later life relationships and\nproposed three models to explain the nature of the linkage\nbetween early involvement of parents and reciprocation by\ntheir children in the form of old-age support. In these mod-\nels support from children was conceptualized as (a) a return\non an investment made earlier by the parent, (b) an insur-\nance policy in which earlier transfers to the child are recov-\nered by the parent under conditions of need, and (c) altruism\nand other nonreciprocal motivations on the part of the child.\nBoth investment and insurance models reflected motiva-\ntions based on dynamics of lagged reciprocity. We defined\nlagged reciprocity as the circumstance when the provision\nof support to older parents was the fulfillment of an obliga-\ntion to repay a social debt based on that parent's earlier\ntransfers to the child. An investment model held when ear-\nlier transfers to the child were unconditionally returned, and\nan insurance model was valid when earlier transfers to the\nchild were returned only in the event of parental need. Al-\ntruism and other nonreciprocal motivations were operating\nin families when adult children provided support to parents\nwho made few intergenerational transfers to their children\nwhen they were younger.\nR\nOur theoretical conceptualization integrated several disci-\nplinary traditions in the study of intergenerational transfers\nwithin the family. We employed complementary perspec-\ntives from sociology, social psychology, and economics to\nproduce an empirical specification that was informed by the\nassumptions of each. We next review in greater detail the\nunderpinnings of exchange theory as it pertains to the dy-\nnamics of long-term serial transfers in intergenerational\nfamily relationships.\nExchange Theory\nAlthough economic exchange theory and social exchange\ntheory have some differences, both share the premise that\nsocial relationships are governed by a norm of reciprocity\u00ad\nthe expectation that a debt should be repaid (Emerson,\nterminology, norms shape preferences in such a way as to\nmake parental repayment preferable to nonrepayment (i.e.,\navoiding shame, threats to reputation, or guilt). In terms of\nsocial exchange theory, adherence to norms grants the indi-\nvidual a social status within the group that confers rights,\nbenefits, and prestige (Homans, 1974). In both contexts,\nnorms enforce and reinforce acts of reciprocity and serve as\nthe implicit reason why preferences for repayment exist at\nall. Here we review these two scholarly traditions with re-\ngard to their explanation of child-provided support to older\nparents.\nMicroeconomic exchange theory.--Exchange models\nthat derive from rational choice theory in classical micro-\neconomics generally assume that individuals tend to engage\nin actions that maximize personal rewards and minimize\npersonal costs (Becker, 1974). Some applications of eco-\nnomic exchange theory to families have focused on be-\nquests (a promised inheritance delayed until the parent's\ndeath) as an asset that motivates children to provide social\nsupport to their elderly parents (Cox, 1987; Henretta et al.,\nthis theory to the \"strategic bequest\" motive, where parents\nwithhold intergenerational transfers until death as a means\nof maintaining a \"bargaining chip\" that can be played to ob-\ntain favors, assistance, and parent\u00adchild interaction. This\nstrategy may be especially salient later in life when elderly\nparents have little choice but to call on their children for\nsuch attention. Because the focus of our investigation was\non serial patterns of inter vivos transfers, bequests were not\nspecifically addressed. Further, it has been shown elsewhere\n(Cox & Raines, 1985) that inter vivos transfers make up the\nbulk of private transfers in the United States. Still, the be-\nquest motivation serves as a powerful metaphor for under-\nstanding how intergenerational transfers are guided by prin-\nciples of exchange and reciprocity.\nSeveral other theories in the rational choice tradition of\nmicroeconomics have stressed self-interested motivations in\nintergenerational transfers: the rotten child and the demon-\nstration effect hypotheses. Becker (1974) described how su-\nperficially altruistic behavior can be manifested even by a\nrotten or selfish child. In our application, this may occur if\nthe putatively selfish or rotten child has transferred re-\nsources to an altruistic parent (one for whom the utility\nfunction of that child is an argument in his or her utility\nfunction). Under these conditions, the rotten child expects\nthat the parent will redistribute resources to compensate for\nhis or her sacrifice. The demonstration effect proposes that\nadult children have an incentive to support their aging par-\nents to demonstrate to their own children the importance of\nproviding such support, from which they hope to eventually\nbenefit (Cox & Stark, 1992). In this formulation, adult chil-\ndren are behaving in a manner that will indirectly provide\nrewards as a form of generalized exchange.\nAlthough self-interested motivations are useful for under-\nstanding the mutuality of more immediate intergenerational\nexchanges, they tend to minimize the importance of giving\nand receiving over the history of these long-term relation-\nships. In this investigation we focused on serial patterns of\ninter vivos transfers over the life course of the parent\u00adchild\nrelationship. Our models tested the assumption that the in-\ntergenerational contract, enforced by the norm of reciproc-\nity, compels adult children to repay long-term social debts\nto their parents. Thus, any immediate \"leverage\" wielded by\nparents to control the actions of children (as is suggested in\nthe case of bequests) gives way to obligations based on a\n\"fairness\" norm--the notion that social and economic debts\nshould be repaid. In another sense, the benefits of meeting\nthe expectation to reciprocate are intrinsic to the importance\nplaced on continuing the relationship amicably.\nSocial exchange theory.--Where microeconomics tends\nto focus only on the exchange transactions themselves, so-\ncial exchange theory incorporates the relationship between\nthe exchange partners, their history of transactions, and\ntheir mutual interdependence into its framework. Molm and\ncroeconomic theory typically assumed the absence of long-\nterm relations between exchange partners and the indepen-\ndence of sequential exchange transactions, social exchange\ntheory took as its subject matter . . . the more or less endur-\ning relations that form between specific partners.\" Sociolo-\ngists analyze the relationship itself and the social structures\nthat govern the value attached to particular behaviors, the\ntolerance of dependence, and the expectation for reciproca-\ntion (including type and timing) in that particular relation-\nship. Giving to others and building an obligation for later re-\npayment is considered the social glue out of which emerges\nsmall group stability--including family solidarity (Homans,\n1950). Mutual dependence builds cohesion in relationships\nwith high levels of primacy and to which there are few alter-\nnatives, such as those that tend to be found in families (Em-\nIn addition, sociologists extend classical economic ex-\nchange theory by proposing that resources other than finan-\ncial assets can be used as a currencies of exchange (Emer-\nargued that the norm of reciprocity is a principle of obliga-\ntion to repay, in some fashion, the receipt of valued assets,\nservices, or sentiments (Gouldner, 1960). Thus, approval,\naffirmation, and emotional support--if they are valued re-\nsources when provided by that particular partner--tend to\nattract reciprocation. This reciprocation need not be imme-\ndiate or made in units equivalent to the initial investment for\nthe exchange to be considered balanced over the long term\n(Hollstein & Bria, 1998). For instance, parental investments\nof time or emotion in their dependent children may later be\nreciprocated with instrumental forms of assistance from\nthem as adults.\nA general model of exchange.--Thus, economists and\nsociologists incorporate self-interested motivations and the\nnorm of reciprocity in social exchanges between genera-\ntions. Both would argue that adult children feel that (a) they\nshould repay parents for transfers made to them earlier in\nlife and (b) their repayment to parents should be propor-\ntional to what they received. However, an important refine-\nment to both of these approaches would specify the condi-\ntions under which adult children are motivated to repay\nearlier parental transfers to them. We proposed that it is nec-\nessary to consider whether the growing needs of aging par-\nents serve as a catalyst to repayment. By taking need into\naccount, we were able to test if the norm of reciprocity re-\nsults in the production of an investment strategy or an insur-\nance policy for the parent.\nIf children's return of support to parents is proportional to\nthe parents' initial contribution to them, but not contingent\non the parents' current needs, then an investment model\nwould be a better representation of the process. In this\nmodel the return on the initial investment is fixed and, thus,\nredeemed by the parent under most conditions as an earned\nreward. Becker and Tomes (1976) used such a model when\nthey theorized that parents' early investments in children's\neducation (human capital) are designed to maximize a re-\nturn on their investment. Empirical results on this issue are\nmixed. Research by Behrman, Pollak, and Taubman (1982)\ndemonstrated that parents' primary investment concern is\nwith promoting equality among their children and not reci-\nprocity. However, another study of parental financial sup-\nport to adult children found that those siblings who received\nsizable financial transfers from older parents were the ones\nmost likely to provide social support to those parents, sug-\ngesting a quid pro quo in observed transfers over time (Hen-\nAn insurance model of parent-child exchange would hold\nif children's return of parental contributions was both pro-\nportional to the initial investment and took place when the\nparents were in greatest need. In this model parents make\ncontributions of affect, time, and financial assets to children\nwith the expectation that those children will reciprocate by\nresponding to negative contingencies that emerge later in\nlife, including health declines, widowhood, and financial\nhardship following retirement.\nEconomists, in particular, have considered investment in\nchildren as a means to reduce the risk of having unmet fi-\nnancial needs in old age. Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981) theo-\nrized that family formation serves as an alternative annuities\nmarket that insures against deficits that might occur as a re-\nsult of an unexpectedly long life. Investment in children has\nalso been considered as a rational alternative to the purchase\nof long-term care insurance (Pauly, 1990). Thus, the impact\nof depleting one's savings and developing chronic illness in\nold age is mitigated by the willingness of children to recip-\nrocate for earlier investments made in them by their parents.\nServices such as companionship that do not have clear mar-\nket alternatives may be even more likely to be included in\nan informal insurance contract.\nThe notion of a support bank, developed by Antonucci\n(1990) to interpret serial patterns of intergenerational ex-\nchange over the life course is consistent with insurance and\ninvestment models of reciprocity. In this paradigm she uses\nthe metaphor of a bank to describe the lagged dynamics of\nreciprocity in intergenerational relationships. A support\nbank symbolically serves as a repository of equity that par-\nents build early in the family life cycle by investing in their\nchildren's well-being. This social capital is withdrawn later\nin life in the form of social support from children at any\ntime, but especially when the parents develop age-associ-\nated dependencies. Importantly, this model highlights that,\nalthough at any one point in time exchanges between par-\nents and children may appear to be unbalanced, reciprocity\nis observed when the balance of exchanges over the life of\nthe relationship is tallied. Thus, partners in the intergenera-\ntional relationship variously play the role of provider and of\nreceiver, depending on the type and timing of their develop-\nmental needs. The life-course perspective provides an addi-\ntional lens through which to view the interdependence of\nfamily members. This paradigm considers human develop-\nment as a relational process of linked lives through time and\nstresses the importance of long-term relationships in shap-\ning the resources and well-being of individuals as they age\n(Bengtson, Biblarz, & Roberts, in press; Elder, 1994).\nAltruism and other theories.--Several theories offer al-\nternative explanations for why adult children who received\nlittle or no transfers from parents nevertheless provide sup-\nport to them in the absence of a discernable social debt.\nAmong these is the theory that altruistic motivations guide\nfamily members to provide support to each other. In this\nparadigm, intergenerational exchanges are driven uncondi-\ntionally by the needs of potential support recipients--rather\nthan by the principle of reciprocity (Stark, 1995; Stark &\nResults of empirical research are mixed as to whether pa-\nrental transfers to adult children are altruistically motivated.\nSome research has found little support for altruism (Altonji,\nthat the principle of need tends to drive inter vivos eco-\nnomic or time/labor transfers between generations (Dunn &\nGarry & Schoeni, 1995). Looking at point-in-time, inter vi-\nvos transfers, Cox (1987) found that parental transfers to\nchildren are in effect payments for services rendered, sup-\nporting an exchange hypothesis over altruism. However,\naside from studies of the bequest motivation, little research\nhas focused on whether support provided by adult children\nto their aged parents is altruistically motivated or driven by\nantecedent intergenerational transfers.\nAs we have mentioned earlier, the rotten child hypothesis\nand the demonstration effect serve as alternative explana-\ntions to altruism for why adult children who in childhood\nreceived little nurturing from their parents may still provide\nsupport to them in later life. We labeled these explanations,\nalong with altruism, as nonreciprocal motivations because\nthey do not require an exchange deficit that favors the par-\nent as a precondition for supportive behavior by the child.\nConceptual Model\nIn this study, we examined whether emotional, time, and\nfinancial investments made by parents in their late-teen and\nyoung-adult children are reciprocated by the children in the\nform of social support provided to their older parents up to\n26 years later. These three investments corresponded to di-\nmensions of intergenerational solidarity, a paradigm devel-\noped by Bengtson and colleagues for distinguishing the ties\nthat bind the generations in the family (Bengtson & Roberts,\nBengtson, 1990). Emotional investment in the child corre-\nsponded to affectual solidarity, the amount of time spent in\nshared activities with the child corresponded to associa-\ntional solidarity, and financial transfers made to the child\ncorresponded to functional solidarity.\nOur aim was to study whether these three types of inter-\ngenerational transfers made early in the family life cycle\nwere later reciprocated in the form of (a) higher levels of so-\ncial support to parents and/or (b) greater rates of increase in\nsocial support to parents over the course of later life. We\nalso examined whether (a) and (b) were contingent on pa-\nrental frailty as a triggering mechanism of support. If trans-\nfers operate under the principle of investment, then children\nwho received more valued resources from their parents\nshould reciprocate more by providing higher average levels\nof social support than children who received fewer such re-\nsources from their parents. If early transfers from parents\noperate under the principle of insurance, then reciprocation\nby children would be contingent on the aging and/or the\nfunctional health of the parent (i.e., parental longevity and\nincreasing disability would drive higher rates of return per\nunit of the early transfer). In our formulation, an insurance\nmechanism is not necessarily mutually exclusive with an in-\nvestment mechanism. Parental contributions may yield both\ndirect and contingent dividends, much as an annuity gener-\nates interest income before it pays a lump sum benefit in the\nevent of death. A subsidiary proposition specified that altru-\nism and other nonreciprocal motivations would be operating\nif, among adult children who received no early transfers, (a)\nthe average level of social support provided was signifi-\ncantly above zero and/or (b) the rate of social support pro-\nvided increased significantly over time.\nMETHODS\nSample\nWe addressed our research questions using data from the\nUniversity of Southern California Longitudinal Study of\n328 three-generation families. Eligible sample members\nwere generated from the families of grandparents randomly\nmember) prepaid health maintenance organization in the\nLos Angeles area. The sample pool was generally represen-\ntative of White, economically stable middle- and working-\nclass families. Self-administered questionnaires were mailed\nto the grandparents and their spouses (G1), their adult chil-\ndren (G2), and their adolescent grandchildren (G3). Surviv-\ntional design of this survey provided us an opportunity to\nprospectively examine the long-term effects of early family\nrelationships by assessing these relationships at the time\nthey were experienced. Thus, we were able to avoid some of\nthe problems associated with retrospective reports, namely\nthat the conditions of current relationships may color mem-\nories of earlier family life.\nThe subsample for this analysis comprised G3 respon-\ndents who (a) participated in 1971 and in at least one other\nsurvey and (b) had at least one parent surviving to 1985. Al-\nmost 70% of the children in this generation fit the criteria\nfor inclusion, resulting in 501 respondents. From this group\nwe derived an analytic sample consisting of 416 child-\nmother relationships and 317 child-father relationships with\nvariation in the dependent variable over time. The number\nof measurements obtained from children between 1985 and\n1997 were as follows (presented in terms of relationships\nwith mothers/fathers): 14%/18% with two measurements,\nmeasurements, and 54%/50% with five measurements.\nan average age of 19 years, and 59% were daughters. About\nsame children appeared in both analytic samples because of\nthe joint survival of their parents. The mean age of the par-\nand 72 years old, respectively.\nDependent Variable\nSocial support to each parent served as the time-varying\ndependent variable in this analysis. Social support was oper-\nationalized as assistance provided by adult children to each\neach wave of measurement, support provided to parents in\nthe following five areas were assessed: shopping/transporta-\ntion, financial support, emotional support, discussing im-\nportant life decisions, and information/advice. We dichoto-\nmously scored (0  \"not provided\"; 1  \"provided\") each\nindicator and summed them to create an additive scale rang-\ning from 0 to 5 at each time period. Reliability of these scale\nitems ranged from .62 to .70 across the five waves of mea-\nsurement. The means of this scale across each year of mea-\nsurement revealed a steady rise in the amount of support pro-\nvided to each parent over the 12-year period (Table 1).\nIndependent Variables\nEarly transfers from mothers and fathers were reported\nseparately by the adolescent and young adult children in\n1971 (see Table 2). Three types of transfers--time/activi-\nties, emotional, and financial--were measured with a proto-\ncol developed by Bengtson and colleagues that corre-\nsponded to associational, affectual, and functional solidarity\nbetween generations (see Mangen et al., 1988, for psycho-\nmetric properties of each scale). Amount of time spent in\nshared activities was measured as the sum of five items rep-\nresenting the degree of associational solidarity with mothers\nand fathers. These items included the frequency of having\nconversations, attending family gatherings, talking about\nimportant matters, having dinner together, and exchanging\nsmall gifts with each parent. Each item was rated on a scale\nof 0\u00ad7, where 0  \"almost never\" and 7  \"almost every\nday.\" Reliability of items was .90 and .88 for association\nwith mothers and fathers, respectively. The total scale score\ntions with fathers.\nEmotional intimacy was measured as the sum of 10 items\nrepresenting affectual solidarity with mothers and fathers.\nThese items reflected the perceived level of trust, fairness,\nrespect, understanding, and affection in the relationship\nwith each parent. Each item was rated on a scale of 0\u00ad5,\nwhere 0  \"not at all\" and 5  \"extremely.\" Reliability co-\nefficients were .93 and .91 for affection with mothers and\nfathers, respectively. The total scale score had a potential\ntions with fathers.\nFinancial assistance, a form of functional solidarity, was\nmeasured by a single item concerning the amount of mone-\ntary support provided by each parent (\"none,\" \"a little,\"\n\"some,\" and \"quite a bit\"). This variable was scored on a\nmothers and 1.9 (SD  1.2) in relations with fathers.\nCorrelations among the three types of transfers were\nmoderate to low, ranging from a high of .29 (between asso-\nciation and affection in relations with mothers) to a low of\n.01 (between affection and financial in relations with fa-\nthers). This suggested that these three transfers represent\nunique ways that parents invest in their children and, thus,\ncould be treated independently.\nOur interest in physical vulnerability of parents as a trig-\ngering mechanism caused us to include a scale of functional\nimpairment as a predictor of support flows. Functional diffi-\nculty was measured as the ability of the parent to walk up\nand down stairs, walk more than a block, prepare meals, do\nhousehold chores, and take care of personal hygiene, with\neach item rated by the parent on a scale of 1\u00ad4, where 1 \n\"no difficulty\" and 4  \"unable to do.\" Because the design\nof the survey instrument included functional health mea-\nsures only in the last two waves of the survey it was not pos-\nsible for us to effectively include functional health as a\ntime-varying covariate. Thus, we took the latest available\ndata reported by each parent to create an additive scale\nscore to denote functional impairment, ranging from 5 (\"no\ndifficulties\") to 20 (\"unable to perform any task\"). Reliabil-\nthe study before 1994, we imputed functional impairment\n(using multiple regression) from the most recently available\n\"I cannot get going\") and self-rated health as instrumental\nvariables. After inserting imputed values, the mean func-\ntional impairment score was 6.0 (SD  2.1) for mothers and\n6.7 for fathers (SD  1.3). Functional impairment scores of\nparents were matched to their children's survey responses\nand included as a fixed effect in Level 2 equations.\nWe also controlled for covariates that have been found to\nbe associated with intergenerational transfers. These in-\ncluded parent's and child's age, gender of child, the highest\neducation achieved by the child, and whether the child re-\nsided with the target parent in 1971. Functional impairment\nand all control variables were centered at their respective\nmeans.\nStatistical Procedure\nWe used six waves of data to examine whether early trans-\nfers from parents to children were reciprocated in the form\nof old-age support. Because of our interest in initial levels\nand rates of increase in support provided, we used hierarchi-\ncal linear modeling (HLM) to (a) investigate growth curves\nin the amount of social support provided to parents between\nthose initial levels and rates of increase as they relate to the\namount of early transfers to the child (Bryck & Rauden-\nbush, 1992). HLM is particularly useful in examining\ntrajectories in multiwave data, particularly when some re-\nspondents have incomplete data over time. Further, this\ntechnique allowed us to use the passage of time as a proxy\nfor the accumulation of age-related deficits in the older gen-\neration.\nThe application of HLM required specifications at two\nlevels of analysis. At the first level, we used a maximum\nlikelihood approach to regress time-varying social support\nTable 1.

Distribution of Explanatory Variables\nExplanatory Variables\nPossible\nRange\nMother-Child\nDyads\nFather-Child\nDyads\nFunctional difficulty of parent\nmeasures for each child on time of measurement. These re-\ngressions generated random intercepts and slopes that de-\nscribed person-specific growth curves. The equation was\nspecified for each respondent as\nwhere yij\nis the social support index and tij\nis the time value\nfor the jth child at the ith year of measurement. The estimate\naj\nis the random intercept evaluated at the mean of time, bj\nis\nthe random slope, and uij\nis the disturbance term. Estimates\nof randomly varying coefficients were stabilized through an\nempirical Bayes/maximum likelihood estimation procedure\nthat \"shrinks\" unreliable Level 1 estimates (those with large\nstandard errors and/or based on a small number of data\npoints) toward an overall solution (see Bryck & Rauden-\nbush, 1992). The time variable was operationalized as sur-\nvey year centered by its grand mean. Although grand mean\ncentering produces an equivalent linear model to that using\nraw scores, parameter estimates may differ from models\nwithout centering or that use other types of centering (see\nKreft & De Leeuw, 1998). In our application of centering,\nor approximately 1991. Our centering strategy was based on\nthe premise that the best single estimate of the level of sup-\nport provided by each individual would be obtained at the\nmidpoint of the 12-year interval.\nAt the second level of analysis, we estimated the aggre-\ngate level and rate of change with the following fixed ef-\nfects equations:\nrepresents the estimated value of social support in\nrepresents\nare error terms signifying person-specific deviations from\nthe fixed effect estimates of g00\n, respectively. The\ntwo gamma coefficients provided the necessary information\nfor us to summarize the height and shape of the growth\ncurve for the sample.\nIf the variances of w0j\nwere significant, then aj\nand bj\ncould be said to vary randomly across the j individu-\nals in the sample, and it then becomes possible for us to test\nfor sources of between-subject variation in these random\ncoefficients. If x is a variable describing the baseline paren-\ntal transfer to children (in 1971), then the following equa-\ntions estimate the effect of that transfer on the height and\nshape of the growth curve of social support provided to par-\nents over time:\nIn these bivariate models g01\nare estimates of the\nlinear relationship between xj\nand the two random effects aj\nand bj\n. Control variables are added to these second-level\nequations as appropriate.

If significant, these intercepts would\nconfirm an altruism/nonreciprocal model of support be-\ncause they would demonstrate support flows to parents who\nmade no initial investment in their child. Because estima-\ntion of standard errors of the gamma coefficients takes into\naccount error variance at the unit or participant level, these\ncoefficients are considered to have high degrees of power\nand precision (see Kreft & De Leeuw, 1998). In addition,\nbecause standard error estimates are based on the error vari-\nance pooled across all participants who provide data, they\nare not affected by the fact that participants with only two\nmeasurements have no error variance (see Bryck & Rauden-\nWe took sample selection bias due to attrition of adult\nchildren into account by weighting the sample in all HLM\nequations by the inverse of their predicted probability of\npost-1971 retention (details on the computation of this in-\nstrumental variable--a variant of the Heckman (1979) pro-\ncedure--are available from the authors).\nRESULTS\nWe first reviewed the overall patterns of social support\nprovided to parents over time. Table 3 shows the \"intercept\nonly\" equations (i.e., no predictor variables) that revealed\nthe summary growth curves in support provided to mothers\nand fathers over time. The level and rate of increase were\nstatistically significant for both sets of relationships. Pre-\ndicted values from these equations revealed a clear rise in\nsupport provided to both mothers and fathers over time\n(Figure 1). Because a quadratic term for the time variable\nwas not significant in the equation, this linear specification\nwas the best representation of the time trend. As expected,\nsupport to mothers occurred at a higher level than support\nTable 3.

The three transfer variables were tested first\nindividually and then added together in the same model. In\nall equations, control variables were applied. Model 1 shows\nthat the association with mothers and fathers in 1971 pre-\ndicted higher average levels of support provided, with greater\namount of time spent in shared activities increasing the sup-\nport provided by children in approximately 1991. However,\nthere was no impact of early association on rates of increase\nin support provided over the 12-year time interval.\nIn Model 2 we present the influence of emotional inti-\nmacy with parent on the provision of social support. Receiv-\ning more affection from mothers and fathers in 1971 was as-\nsociated with providing greater social support to them in\nabout 1991. Similar to the earlier model, rates of increase in\nsocial support were not sensitive to the size of the initial in-\nvestment of emotion in children by mothers or by fathers.\nModel 3 shows that the amount of baseline financial\ntransfers made by fathers was positively associated with the\naverage support provided by children to their fathers in\n1991. Financial support from mothers positively influenced\nthe rate of change in support provided, such that greater fi-\nnancial contributions were related to sharper increases in the\namount of support provided to mothers over the 12-year\nperiod (p  .07). No such relationship was observed for\nfathers.\nFinally, in Model 4, we included the three initial transfer\nvariables in the same equation simultaneously. In the equa-\ntion predicting average support in 1991, only association\nwith parents was a significant predictor of the amount of\nsupport to both mothers and fathers. The direct nature of the\nexchange suggested an investment mechanism of reciproc-\nity with regard to earlier time transfers by parents. The aver-\nage return of social support on emotional investments in\nchildren--significant in Model 1--appeared to be explained\nby the higher frequency of interaction and shared activities\nfound in emotionally closer relationships.\nPredicting the rate of increase in support in our saturated\nmodel, we found that greater financial support provided to\nchildren at baseline almost significantly raised the marginal\nrates at which support provided to mothers (p  .07) and fa-\nthers (p  .08) increased over time. Because the effects of\nfinancial transfers were time dependent, these findings were\nconsistent with an insurance model of exchange. Indeed, the\nresults strengthened with affection and association factors\ncontrolled (especially for fathers), suggesting that the effect\nof financial assistance was suppressed in Model 3 by the re-\nlationship strain experienced by some children who were\neconomically dependent on their parents. Further, the con-\nstants (fixed intercepts) in each equation, representing the\neffects among those children who received no support from\ntheir parents, were all statistically significant, suggesting\nthat altruistic or other nonreciprocal motivations may have\nbeen driving their positive levels and increasing rates of\nsupport.\nOur final set of tests involved identifying the extent to\nwhich physical impairment of each parent triggered a return\nto the equity built from earlier transfers. In Table 5 we show\nthe interaction terms between the functional limitation of\neach parent and the three transfers from parents in 1971.\nThe only significant interaction term was between func-\ntional limitation and affection with mother in predicting the\naverage amount of support provided to them in approxi-\nmately 1991. This positive coefficient indicated that func-\nFigure 1. Predicted growth trends in social support provided to mothers and fathers over 12 years.\ntional difficulties experienced by mothers magnified the av-\nerage amount of support reciprocated by children in\nresponse to earlier affectual ties. The interaction is shown in\nFigure 2 as a bar chart with functional health and affection\nscores held at 1 and 1 standard deviations from their re-\nspective means. This chart shows that middle-aged children\nprovided, on average, more support to mothers who had\ngreater functional difficulties and with whom they were\nemotionally closer in 1971. By contrast, children with\nhealthier mothers and/or a history of greater emotional re-\nmoteness responded with lower amounts of support. Frailty\nof mothers apparently triggered a greater supportive re-\nsponse from children when there was emotional reserve in\nthe relationship. These findings were robust both to the cen-\ntering method used and, given the relatively small sample\nsize, to the inclusion of covariates. That is, consistent find-\nings were obtained when time was centered at the baseline\nperiod as well as when covariates were excluded from the\nmodels.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this investigation we examined several processes un-\nderlying long-term reciprocity in adult intergenerational re-\nlationships. We used data on intergenerational exchanges\nover a 27-year period to trace the effects of early transfers\nof affection, time, and money from parents to children on\nthe propensity of those same children to provide social sup-\nport to their elderly parents. We tested three mechanisms--\ninvestment, insurance, and altruism--by examining whether\nand under what conditions early transfers resulted in higher\nlevels of support to parents over time.\nOur results reveal partial support for each of the three\nmodels of intergenerational exchange. Both mothers and fa-\nthers who shared more activities with their children--a\nproxy for the transfer of the valued resource of time--\nreceive higher levels of support from them, suggesting an\ninvestment model of intergenerational transfers. That the\nreturn gained by parents is proportional to their initial in-\nvestment suggests that families function as a forum for di-\nrect--although not necessarily simultaneous or equiva-\nlent--reciprocity between generations.\nBy contrast, the reciprocation of early financial transfers\nto children emerges only over time (financial support did\nnot differentiate level of initial support), suggesting a la-\ntency in the response of adult children that is more charac-\nteristic of an insurance mechanism. The question remains\nwhy financial support to children is the only transfer of the\nthree tested to produce a time-dependent response from\nchildren. One answer may have to do with the nature of the\ntransfer itself. Financial transfers are not likely to produce\nthe direct \"purchase\" of support because norms of family\nlife mitigate the use of purely instrumental strategies in kin-\n1955). Alternatively, parents who are best equipped to fi-\nnancially assist their children earlier in life may have suffi-\ncient resources to remain independent until late in life.\nOur most consistent finding is that even under what may\nbe considered to be estranged circumstances--when the\nearly parent\u00adchild relationship was emotionally distant, had\nno time commitment, and involved no financial support--\nthe amount of support provided to parents increases as they\nage. This suggests a form of altruism whereby children re-\nModel Parameters\nModel 1 Estimates Model 2 Estimates Model 3 Estimates Model 4 Estimates\nMother Father Mother Father Mother Father Mother Father\nPredictors of Random Effects\nRandom intercept: Support provided to\nRandom slope: Linear growth rate in\nRandom Effects\nRandom intercept\nRandom slope\nNotes: The following variables were controlled and mean centered: gender, age, and education of child; coresidence with parent in 1971; and age and functional\ndifficulty of parent. n  416 for mother models and n  317 for father models.\nspond over time to the age-related needs of their parents in\nspite of the poor quality of their earlier relationships. Sup-\nportive behavior of this type may likely be linked to a sense\nof filial duty on the part of such children (see Richlin-Klon-\nsky & Bengtson, 1996). Research that delves more deeply\ninto the underlying nature of altruistic motivations may well\ndiscover another currency of intergenerational value related\nto the investment of moral capital in children--transferred\nthrough early socialization to norms of familism. The use of\ntime to proxy the multiple changes occurring in the older\nparents may also relate to changes occurring among the\nchildren. The expanded duration of the relationship may\nprovide greater opportunity for children, as middle-aged\nadults, to get to better know their parents and empathize\nwith them, increase the emotional maturity needed by chil-\ndren to overcome a legacy of historically weak attachment\nstyles, or be correlated with children having greater re-\nsources and fewer competing demands placed on them.\nWhether the inclination to return greater amounts of so-\ncial support over time is contingent on processes particular\nto old age that lie beyond functional health (such as widow-\nhood, retirement, income loss) can only be inferred from the\ntime trends in the data. It is also not possible for us to know\nwhether adult children are consciously motivated by an ex-\nplicit sense of obligation to reciprocate for past transfers or\nwhether parents made strategic investments in their children\nwith the expectation of old-age support. However, the\nlagged nature of the exchange is consistent with the notion\nthat social support is dependent on earlier financial and\nemotional investments made by parents when triggered by\ndependency. That interactions with health of parent are not\nfound with regard to slopes should not be surprising be-\ncause health of parent was included only as a fixed effect in\nthe model. The goal remains for future research to specify\nwhich ontogenic changes are most associated with increas-\ning flows of support.\nClearly, economic support from each parent is, in most\ncases, a joint transfer from common parental assets. Consis-\ntent results on this dimension are reflected in the high corre-\nlation between parents in financial transfers made to chil-\ndren. Indeed, the correlation between mothers and fathers\n(for children who responded about both) was high for all\ntransfers (.84 for affection, .85 for association, and .82 for\nfinancial), suggesting that it may be more appropriate for re-\nsearchers to consider the aggregate amount of parental\ntransfers when parents share a common household.\nEvidence that functional limitations act as a trigger of eq-\nuity \"withdrawal\" is found with regard to average levels of\nsupport to mothers as a function of early affection. This\nfinding suggests that moral capital resides more with frail\nolder mothers in terms of the proportionate reciprocation to\nemotional succor that mothers provided earlier to their chil-\ndren. No interactions with health are found in predicting in-\ntercepts or slopes in support to fathers. Early bonding with\nthe maternal figure in the family, so important for the\nhealthy development of the child, also appears to be at the\nheart of what may be called healthy family development in\nlater life when the physical frailty of parents is most likely\nto elevate the importance of supportive kinship ties.\nThe parental transfer measures, particularly financial, are\nweak in several respects. In the absence of indicators of\nquantity and quality of financial assistance, we relied on an\nordinal measure. Such a measure is not sensitive to the like-\nlihood that the dollar amount and type of the transfer vary\ndepending on the age of the child. However, in tests we per-\nformed of interactions between each of the transfers and the\nage and living arrangements of children, we found no evi-\ndence that these characteristics condition the relationships\nobserved. Another issue revolves around the possibility that\nmeasures of transfers are biased because they are subjective\nand reflect only the children's perception of the events; chil-\ndren may ignore actual transfers or falsely perceive trans-\nfers in their absence. The subjective basis of these measures\ntypically produces biases such that children tend to underes-\ntimate the magnitude of transfers, although correlations be-\ntween the reports of the two generations have been observed\nto be high (Giarrusso, Stallings, & Bengtson, 1995).\nThere are alternative explanations for how transfers be-\ntween generations are serially linked that are consistent with\nour findings. Fixed personality characteristics and family\nculture may determine support flows that give the appear-\nance of reciprocity. Parents may be more giving to children\nwith \"compliant\" personalities, who are then more likely to\nprovide support to their parents as a result of this personal-\nity characteristic. Alternatively, exchanges that are seem-\nTable 5.

For instance, strong norms of family re-\nsponsibility may pervade a family and spuriously drive both\nparental transfers and support from children. A fixed effects\nmodel that examines within-family effects would hold such\nfamily effects constant by estimating differential transfer-\nreturn rates for children in the same families. The response\npatterns in the Longitudinal Study of Generations did not\npermit the identification of such a model. However, we\nhave, to some degree, remedied the influence of competing\nexplanations by controlling for education and gender--both\nof which are related to norms regarding family support pat-\nterns (Silverstein, Parrott, & Bengtson, 1995).\nThe findings of this investigation illuminate some of the\nprinciples that guide the serial transfer of resources across\ngenerations in the family. The availability of long-term lon-\ngitudinal data has enabled us to test models that inform the-\nories of reciprocity and altruism in intergenerational family\nrelationships. These models also have the potential to high-\nlight some important policy considerations as well. Econo-\npublic programs that mandate intergenerational transfers,\nsuch as Social Security, are less effective when intergenera-\ntional relations operate under principles of reciprocity. If\npublicly mandated transfers are too low, altruistic children\nwill make up the difference with private voluntary contribu-\ntions to their parents, keeping the total transfer constant. In\ncontrast, these public programs will have the greatest effect\non those who are not altruistically motivated, because they\ncompel even the most reluctant children to transfer (indi-\nrectly in this case) at least some resources to their parents. It\nwould appear that support programs do have a real impact\non older adults, insofar as exchanges are, to some degree,\nguided by an intergenerational quid pro quo.\nIn conclusion, we suggest that the motivation of adult\nchildren to provide social support to their older parents is\nrooted in earlier family experiences and guided by an im-\nplicit social contract that ensures long-term reciprocity. In-\ntergenerational family relationships observe many of the\nsame exchange dynamics that provide stability to small so-\ncial groups. However, the long time lag between investment\nand return on investment is what may differentiate ex-\nchanges in intergenerational relationships from exchanges\nin other relationships, such as friendships, where the de-\nmand to reciprocate is more immediate. Thus, parents inter-\nested in optimizing their chances of receiving old-age sup-\nport would do well to invest in their children well before\nthey, the parents, reach old age. That even parents with min-\nimal investments can expect some support from their chil-\ndren further highlights the complexities in understanding\nthis most fundamental of interpersonal relationships.\n"
