This mixed-method study (a) qualitatively described facilitators, barriers, and consequences to rapport\ndevelopment between PWIDs and their health care providers and (b) quantitatively tested the hypothesis that quality of\nrapport is associated with positive patterns of service use. Two exploratory focus groups with PWIDs and care providers\nwere conducted. Subsequently, 89 PWIDs completed a survey interview; of those, eight completed a follow-up qualitative\ninterview. Qualitative results indicated that rapport is influenced by drug-related behaviors, addiction severity, provider\nexpertise, patient-centered care, and perceived discrimination and that rapport then influences patient compliance, timing\nof care, and criminal activity. Quantitative results indicated that rapport predicted PWID satisfaction with care as well as\nfrequency and timing of emergency department presentations. Results suggest that PWID\u00adprovider rapport has several\nunique determinants and is associated with positive health care outcomes.\n",

PWIDs can\nexperience further disadvantage due to poor rapport with\nhealth care providers (HCPs). System-level barriers to rap-\nport include unrealistic staff expectations, confidentiality\nconcerns, and wait times (Drumm et al., 2003; VanderWaal\net al., 2001). The attitudes, knowledge, and experiences of\nHCPs are additional challenges (Breitbart, Kaim, &\n2005). Quality of health care encounters themselves are\ninfluenced by the presence or absence of empathy, listening,\nshaming, discrimination, flexibility, and disclosure (Drumm\net al., 2003; Merrill, Rhodes, Deyo, Marlatt, & Bradley,\nRapport development is integral to any clinical interac-\ntion, and may be a particularly important element of health\ncare with marginalized PWIDs. A patient-centered approach\nimproves satisfaction with care and adherence to medical\nrecommendations, and fulfills patient expectations better\nthan physical exams or prescriptions (Bass et al., 1986; Beck,\ntered approach fostered in the context of health services?\nSelf-Determination Theory (SDT) provides a useful perspec-\ntive with which to understand how rapport might facilitate\nmotivation for seeking health services. In particular, this\ntheory addresses how social events are perceived and how\nthose perceptions affect motivational processes (Wild &\nEnzle, 2002). SDT characterizes motivation to engage in\nactivities on a continuum, ranging from activities that are\ncompletely initiated and controlled by external social forces,\n1University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada\n2Edmonton Southside and Edmonton West Primary Care Networks,\nAlberta, Canada\n3Streetworks Harm Reduction Program, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nGinetta Salvalaggio, Assistant Professor, Department of Family Medicine,\nCanada.\nEmail: ginetta@ualberta.ca\nPatient\u00adProvider Rapport in the Health\nCare of People Who Inject Drugs\nGinetta Salvalaggio1, Robert McKim2, Marliss Taylor3,\nand T.

On this theory, all\npeople have fundamental psychological needs for autonomy,\nrelatedness, and competence. Social contexts that support\nthese elements of self-determination promote interested\nengagement in activities and personal growth. Conversely,\nwhen social contexts promote perceptions of being con-\ntrolled or coerced, intrinsic motivation (i.e., interest and\nengagement in activities) is undermined (Deci & Ryan,\n2002). SDT suggests that rapport with patients will be maxi-\nmized when HCPs support their patients' needs for auton-\nomy, competence, and relatedness. However, this theory has\nnot been applied in many marginalized or cross-cultural\nsettings, nor has it been investigated in the context of injec-\ntion drug use. Consequently, the objectives of the present\nstudy were to (a) describe factors that facilitate or prevent the\ndevelopment of rapport between PWIDs and their HCPs;\n(b) describe how HCP\u00adpatient rapport relates to PWIDs'\nexperiences of health care and subsequent care-seeking\nbehavior; and (c) test the hypothesis that quality of PWID\nrapport with a primary HCP would be associated with posi-\ntive patterns of health care use.\nMethod\nOverview\nThis project was facilitated by an academic\u00adcommunity part-\nnership between the University of Alberta and Edmonton,\nCanada's Streetworks harm reduction program (Wild et al.,\nBased Participatory Research (CBPR) principles (Macaulay et\nal., 2009) guided the development, implementation, interpre-\ntation, and dissemination of the research. Streetworks and its\nclients provided regular input into the project to ensure it\nremained relevant and acceptable to the community.All PWID\ndata collection sessions took place in private meeting rooms\nlocated within community-based agencies and separate from\nhealth care encounters. The research was also approved by the\nUniversity of Alberta Health Research Ethics Board.\nThree data sources were used: (a) PWID and HCP focus\ngroup interviews provided an initial exploration of how\nPWID\u00adHCP rapport is developed and how rapport influences\nhealth care; (b) cross-sectional structured interviews quantita-\ntively described associations between PWID\u00adHCP rapport\nand administrative health records; and (c) semi-structured\nqualitative interviews with a subset of the quantitative sample\nfurther clarified rapport-related themes and quantitative asso-\nciations documented in the other data sources.\nAlthough the development of rapport in a long-term\nPWID\u00adHCP relationship was of interest, we anticipated that\nmany participants would be unattached to a regular HCP and\nmay access a variety of health services and providers differ-\nently than the general population. Thus, rather than limit our\nenquiry to a specific health care setting or discipline, PWIDs\nwere instead encouraged to discuss care-seeking patterns and\nrapport development, drawing on their personal experience\nwith multiple settings and HCPs. Where setting- or disci-\npline-specific content emerged this was taken into account\nduring the analysis.\nEligible PWIDs were 18 years or older, English speakers,\ninjecting drugs within 30 days preceding data collection, and\nnot participating in treatment within the past month,\nEdmonton residents, and not intoxicated or experiencing a\npsychiatric emergency. PWID participants received CDN$20\nas compensation per session for their time.\nFocus Groups\nEight PWIDs, purposively selected because of their exten-\nsive experience with the health care system, took part in a\npreliminary focus group session intended to identify key\nconcepts for further exploration during individual inter-\nviews. To provide a complementary perspective, seven HCPs\nwith experience caring for PWIDs participated in a separate\nfocus group session. One researcher moderated each session\nusing a semi-structured interview protocol, while another\nrecorded field notes and assisted in clarifying responses.\nBoth moderators were experienced in group interview set-\ntings, extensively reviewed and practiced the interview\nguides prior to the sessions, looked for consensus and\nexplored any perceived disagreement within the group, and\nused participant engagement strategies where required.\nQuestions and probes explored participant expectations of\nand experiences with health care, as well as perceived influ-\nences on patient\u00adHCP rapport.\nStructured Quantitative Interviews\nDue to the difficulty in reaching the PWID population with\ntraditional sampling means, a non-probability sampling\napproach known as chain-referral sampling was used. This\nmethod involves identification and recruitment of a small\nnumber of participants via word of mouth, who then provide\ncontact information for other potential participants (Erickson,\n1979). To minimize bias from specific social networks and\nsettings within the PWID community, multiple chains were\nused for recruitment. A total of 89 participants completed the\nquantitative data collection.\nBaseline demographic variables obtained during the struc-\ntured interview included (a) age, (b) gender, (c) ethnicity, (d)\neducation, (e) marital status, (f) parental status, (g) legal sta-\ntus, (h) housing stability, (i) income, and (j) employment sta-\ntus. Drug use data were collected on (a) ease of access to\ndrugs, (b) duration of use, (c) cessation attempts, (d) income\nsource for drug acquisition, (e) drug-related expenses, (f) sub-\nstances used, (g) overdose risk, (h) experience of withdrawal,\nand (i) the Blood-Borne Virus Transmission Risk Assessment\nQuestionnaire (BBV-TRAQ; Fry & Lintzeris, 2003), a\n34-item standardized measure of injecting, sexual, and skin\npenetration practices that exhibits good reliability and\nSalvalaggio et al. 3\nvalidity (Cronbach's  = .87, test\u00adretest correlation = .84 in\nFry & Lintzeris' sample). Variables specific to health and\nhealth care were also collected, including (a) drug depen-\ndence treatment history, (b) self-reported physical health sta-\ntus, (c) self-reported mental health status, (d) ability to\nidentify a regular physician, (e) regular physician knowledge\nof drug use, (f) self-reported number of visits to regular and\nother physicians, (g) preferred point of health care access,\n(h) satisfaction with care, (i) perceived hepatitis C (HCV)\nrisk, and (j) perceived HIV risk.\nThe Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ) mea-\nsured PWID\u00adHCP rapport. Derived from SDT, the short\nform of the HCCQ is a validated six-item questionnaire\nassessing perceived autonomy support by physicians (Deci,\nEghrari, Patrick, & Leone, 1994; University of Rochester\nPsychology Departments, 2006; Williams, Gagne, Ryan, &\nDeci, 2002) including items such as \"I feel that my doctor\nhas provided me choices and options\" and \"My doctor listens\nto how I would like to do things.\" Internal consistency for the\nsix-item scale was excellent ( = .93).\nAlberta Health Care Unique Identifiers (UIs) were col-\nlected from consenting participants to link study data to\nhealth service use data. Research assistants noted that almost\nall participants consented in principle; however, not all par-\nticipants were able to supply their UI to study staff within\nthe allotted time period (1 month post-questionnaire).\nAmong the participants who provided their UI (n = 42), ser-\nvice use was assessed in the year immediately preceding\ndata collection, and included number of emergency depart-\nment (ED) visits, ED visit date and time, and mode of trans-\nportation to ED. Frequent ED visits, late night care-seeking\n(night shift presentation to services), and transportation via\nambulance (EMS) were measured to assess delayed care-\nseeking and lower continuity with a single-care provider\nFollow-Up Interviews\nTo clarify and confirm the focus group and quantitative find-\nings, eight PWIDs were purposively recruited from the quan-\ntitative sample for a follow-up interview. Eligible participants\nexhibited divergent scores on the quantitative measure of\nrapport (HCCQ), satisfaction with care, identification of a\nregular physician, and ED use to ensure a comprehensive\nexploration of the patient experience. Participants provided\nnarratives on their health care experiences, and were probed\non issues brought up in earlier data collection sessions such\nas the locations of care, the difference between health profes-\nsions, negotiation strategies, the central role of drugs, the\nimpact of disclosure of drug use on quality of health service\nencounters, and the relationship between rapport and satis-\nfaction with care. Participant recruitment ended after eight\ninterviews because later interviews confirmed the emerging\nthemes and did not uncover new or alternate themes.\nParticipant Characteristics\nLimited demographics were collected for PWID focus group\nand qualitative interview respondents. Both qualitative par-\nticipant groups were similar to the PWID quantitative sample\nas well as the quantitative subsample and administrative\nhealth data were available for both (Tables 1 and 2). PWID\nparticipants were predominantly male, single, unemployed,\nunstably housed, and living in poverty. Approximately half\nwere Caucasian and half had a high school education.\nConsistent with other local data sources, the majority of par-\nticipants were poly-substance users as opposed to users of a\nsingle drug or drug class. For the HCP focus group, partici-\npants were seven nurses, physicians, and a mental health\ncounselor, ranging from 32 to 56 years of age, with 9 to\nencounters with PWIDs a week. The participants were pre-\ndominantly female and community-based; however, hospi-\ntal-based professionals were also present.\nQualitative Analysis\nFocus groups and interviews were audio-recorded, tran-\nscribed verbatim, and verified for accuracy. Analyses of\nthese data used a combination of thematic analysis (Boyatzis,\nanalysis can be applied by researchers from a variety of epis-\ntemologies, and thus, facilitate the communication of find-\nings to a wider audience (Boyatzis, 1998). This pragmatic\nanalytic approach (Figure 1) is particularly well suited to\nCBPR and has been successfully used with this target popu-\nlation in previous research (Wozniak et al., 2007). Initially,\nwithin-transcript analyses identified meaning units (i.e., sen-\ntences, paragraphs) expressing single and idiosyncratic top-\nics by participants.Adescriptive label and verbatim examples\nwere written and defined for each meaning unit. Next, mean-\ning units were compared across focus group members and\nindividual interview transcripts to identify constituents (i.e.,\nmeaning units shared by two or more participants; Wild &\nus to identify commonly shared meaning units across the\nTable 1.

Transcripts and field notes were then reread\nto ensure that themes and constituents identified during anal-\nyses were consistent with the interview content. NVivo ana-\nlytic software facilitated the organization of meaning units\nand emerging themes.\nTrustworthiness of our analysis was assessed in four\nways: (a) a second researcher reviewed all data analysis and\nindependently coded two transcripts; (b) focus group partici-\npants reviewed thematic labels and constituents and provided\nfeedback; (c) follow-up interview sessions continued,\nactively seeking alternative interpretations and experiences,\nuntil data saturation occurred and no further themes emerged\n(Kuzel, 1999); and (d) a Streetworks staff member reviewed\nthematic labels and constituents to ensure consistency with\nher observations of the local PWID scene.\nQuantitative Analysis\nInitially, we identified participants with a regular physician\nto determine a subgroup who had the opportunity to establish\nrapport with a primary HCP for a longer term. Student t tests\nand chi-square tests examined associations between the pres-\nence/absence of a regular physician and PWID characteris-\ntics that may have been influenced by this patient\u00adHCP\nrelationship (current legal involvement, quit attempts, with-\ndrawal episodes, drug acquisition via crime, overdose risk,\nand infectious disease risk behavior). Next, Pearson correla-\ntions were calculated among participants who reported that\nthey had a regular physician to determine associations\nbetween rapport (HCCQ scores) and three main service use\noutcomes chosen to reflect the quality and consistency with\nwhich participants experience a therapeutic relationship with\ntheir primary HCP: (a) disclosure of drug use (yes or no),\n(b) ED visits, and (c) satisfaction with care. Additional\nPearson correlations were calculated for other available\nhealth care measures assessing self-reported health status,\nconsistency of HCP, and acuity of presentation. Finally, hier-\narchical multiple regression was performed to determine\nwhether rapport incrementally improved prediction of the\nprimary service use variables, adjusting for effects of demo-\ngraphic covariates and PWID risk behaviors.\nResults\nFocus Groups\nParticipants'accounts of the determinants of rapport included\npatient, HCP, external, and encounter-based factors.\nPatient factors.Participants acknowledged that the patient\ncontributed greatly to the development of patient\u00adHCP rap-\nport. For example, respondents stated that the nature of drug\ndependence and withdrawal is such that it exerts an inescap-\nable influence on the PWID's behavior during health care\nencounters. Participants stressed that drug dependence is an\nillness with potentially severe interpersonal and other conse-\nquences, over which drug dependence PWIDs had little\ncontrol:\nI mean it's like you had a choice at one point but that line's been\ncrossed a long time ago. I mean, you can have like 50 doctors\nsay no. It doesn't change the fact that you have to like you have\nto do what's required. I mean like you rob a drug store, rob\nanother store or person or something to buy drugs with. And\nTable 2.

Participants\nacknowledged that, given the nature of drug dependence,\ncaring for PWIDs is not a straightforward task.\nI mean there's no question that some of my hardest interactions\nare with someone where it is mental health and addictions the\ncomplexity sometimes can feel overwhelming. And certainly\nI'm no master of any of it. So I feel at a loss sometimes of what\nCare avoidance was another barrier to effective rapport\nfor many participants and was usually attributed to past\nexperiences with health care. PWIDs related several past epi-\nsodes of poor treatment by HCPs. These experiences led\npatients to delay, refuse, and prematurely terminate health\ncare encounters, compromising the establishment of good\nrapport with HCPs. In addition, HCPs were keenly aware\nthat typical wait times for those patients dealing with drug\nwithdrawal and street life were unrealistic, and were pre-\npared for crisis presentations as a result:\nPeople can't wait 3 or 4 hours. Or they'll come in the morning\nand by the afternoon, something, things will have completely\nfallen apart, that sort of thing. It really frustrates me to see\nHCP factors. HCP focus group participants emphasized that\ntheir pre-encounter attitudes, experience, and position of\npower had major impacts on the rapport achieved during\nPWID\u00adHCP encounters. Seasoned HCPs expected patient\nhostility but accepted that it often had a legitimate, remedia-\nble cause:\nI think sometimes people just come in feeling judged from the\nminute they get there and probably with great justification. And\nthey come in and have been judged before and they're kinda\nscared to tell you anything or openly hostile when they first\nRecognizing their role in establishing healthy relation-\nships, HCP participants exercised self-reflection after their\nPWID encounters. Participants accepted responsibility for\ntheir role in the encounter:\nIt's if I don't have that connection--they don't come back? Then\nthere was something wrong and I often sort of try to figure out\nwhat the heck happened here and what did I do wrong. Because\nthose are the ones that bug me . . . (PFG4, 246)\nPWID participants also remarked that HCP knowledge\nabout illnesses associated with street life and drug depen-\ndence was a great asset to good patient care:\nI think they're um, better at the clinic too because they are more\nused to having drug users around and they're used to seeing the\nsame people and pretty well know how their habits are. (IFG8, 376)\nExample: Within-transcript Analysis\nExcerpt 1: So that's another way to do it and in other words, I get along with him but then I was impatient I was hyper because I need my\ndaily hoot hey.

Examples of within-transcript and between-transcript analysis.\n6 SAGE Open\nWithin-encounter factors.Participants in both focus groups\ndevoted most of their discussion of rapport to the content and\nquality of the PWID\u00adHCP interaction itself. Discrimination\nagainst PWIDs and associated trivialization of PWID con-\ncerns was a very common rapport-damaging experience.\nI think the doctors there think you're coming in there for drugs,\neven if it's a legitimate reason. Like if you have an abscess or\nsomething like that. They'll let you wait still. \"Oh you're an IV\nuser. You can wait a while, you left it this long, it's not a big thing\"\n. . . Ya yup you're the last stick on the totem pole. (IFG1, 383)\nIn contrast, rapport was strengthened by the basic princi-\nples of patient-centered care, such as time, listening, con-\ncern, confidentiality, and partnership. HCPs took the time to\nfind common ground with their patients and share control of\nthe encounter where possible:\nI guess I expect at times sometimes a little bit of initial resistance\nbut then I expect at the end that we will have a plan that I think\nwill work for both parties. (PFG2, 65)\nDeveloping trust and honesty in a PWID\u00adHCP relationship\nis both complex and gradual. PWIDs acknowledged that hon-\nesty can strengthen rapport, but it can also have drawbacks:\nI mean my problem is I have lie to a psychiatrist. Like thing is\nevery single thing wrong with me to them is from drug use. I\nmean like every hallucination, every illness in my body is simply\nbecause you're an IV drug user this and that. So I have to sit\nthere and kiss ass and lie to them and if I am having trouble I\nHCPs understood that it takes time to develop this open\nrelationship, and focused their early rapport-building efforts\non remaining authentic, available, and attuned to their\npatients' context. They were comfortable accepting as much\nhonesty as was possible for the PWID:\nI expect as much honesty as they are capable of giving in the\ncontext. So that I can help them . . . My other expectation when\ndealing with IV users, [is] of myself. I expect myself to be as\nopen and as approachable as I can be. So expectations of\nopenness on both parts I guess . . . (PFG6, 99)\nHCPs used several culturally sensitive strategies to build\nthis relationship, from humor to harm reduction counseling\nto asking patients about their context:\nOne of my tricks is if someone says something that I don't\nunderstand, I'll say, \"Hang on, what's that, what does that\nmean?\" And that's a very powerful way of creating a rapport.\nIn all health care encounters, a negotiation process\nbetween the patient and the HCP occurs, and this negotiation\nhas an impact on rapport and subsequent care-seeking behav-\nior. Where the recipient of care is a PWID, the nature of the\nnegotiation has additional unique characteristics. PWIDs\nfocused on the need to navigate HCP-centric rules and create\na legitimate argument for their health care requests:\nMy father-in-law had passed away, I wanted to go to the funeral\nyou know my kids wanted me there and that. And I couldn't get\na carry. I couldn't go to the funeral . . . There's a lot of bull of\nhaving to get your pills every day. I've been getting them every\nday for the last year now. And it just I find like if I could get it\neven like every twice a week. Once a week. I would be a lot\nbetter off. I could take off for a few days. Go out of town, I could\ngo up [north], see my kids. The way it is now, I have to be at the\nGiven the challenges associated with drug-related PWID\u00ad\nHCP negotiation, consistency in a HCP's application of rules\nwas reassuring to participants:\nThe clinic, the best thing about the clinic is the consistency. I\nmean, even though sometimes you might not like the answer\nyou get, I mean, the staff treats you. It's like, basically equals\nrespect type thing. Like as long as you're like honest and like,\nfair with the staff, they're helpful. (IFG4, 389)\nConversely, inconsistent HCP practices are frustrating to\npatients:\nThe bad thing is when one doctor. It's almost if one doctor writes\nfive of your friend's prescription and you go to see the same\ndoctor and he basically shoots you down cold. (IFG4, 764)\nHCP participants described the emotion-laden nature of\nPWID encounters as well as their strategies for dealing with\nthese emotions. Strong reactions to a patient can interfere\nwith one's ability to help that patient. When participants\nexplained their actions and remained calm, their patients\nusually responded in the same way:\nI know it sounds a bit odd but you tell yourself that you're\ncomfortable and you're casual and that actually you see people,\nthe other person calms down. That's speaking slowly and softly.\nGreat trick for calming down in a situation like that `cause\npeople are often not necessarily hostile but still agitated, worried,\nExternal factors.Participants in both groups alluded to cer-\ntain system-level rapport builders and breakers. HCPs were\nfrustrated in their attempts to comprehensively address drug\ndependence and social issues by the system's time, space,\nand resource constraints:\nBecause it's not designed to help people who are marginalized.\nThe system isn't set up to take care of these people while they're\nin hospital and deal with the big picture. I'm sure she wasn't\ngetting enough pain medicine or enough drugs in hospital and\nshe just said, \"Screw you guys, I feel better, I've got other\nneeds\" and we're not addressing those other needs. When we\nhave them there, when we have the opportunity to do it. Not that\nSalvalaggio et al. 7\nwe can fix everything but I think we have to at least make sure\nthose things are addressed so they don't feel like they have no\nPWIDs mirrored this frustration with the health care sys-\ntem, citing bureaucratic barriers and wait times with inade-\nquate communication to help cope with these barriers:\nIt's just until you put these little hoops and stuff and on top of it\nyou are usually the 50th person to be seen. And you go into\nemergency and there will be 200 people in the waiting room and\nits daytime already and you've watched the whole waiting room\nempty twice. And they bring you in and they don't even do\nOther health care team members also influenced rapport;\na negative encounter with one team member can damage the\nrapport built by others:\nWell, we'll have people though that everything will being going\nwell, everything's great, they're being admitted and all this stuff.\nAnd then all of a sudden the next thing you see them slamming\nat the door and they're angry. And they go through so many\npeople, the nurses, the doctors, right down to the porters and one\nperson they will have a really negative interaction with\nsomebody where they feel judged.

Participants stressed the importance of HCPs acknowl-\nedging that drug dependence is a complex illness. They also\nnoted that people living with drug dependence tended to behave\nin ways that shaped the HCP's expectations:\nWell it's so hard you know `cause you, you know, you're abusive,\nyou're loud . . . you just walked 30, 40 blocks, three or four\ndifferent places probably and finally you get to this point and at\nsome point you're trying to get to see him to help you out you\nknow and so they go you know they interrogate you and you know\n\"You're double doctoring\" you're this or you're that. (I3, 343)\nDrug dependence not only affects the behavior and over-\nall health of PWIDs, it also changes users' priorities. Drugs\nplay a central role in active users' lives, and all other pur-\nsuits, including health care, take a back seat until the need for\ndrugs is met.\nYou don't got no dope after a while, how you gonna get more\ndope so you gotta do other things to get more dope.

And\nthen you gotta do crime or you go to work or whatever you gotta\nFocus group themes of HCP familiarity, values, attitudes,\nexperience, and expertise were equally brought up in the\nindividual interviews as being key HCP attributes necessary\nfor rapport. Many participants were grateful when they had\nHCP continuity. Participants were much more comfortable\nwith a HCP who showed expertise in drug dependence, drug-\nrelated injury, pain management, and other conditions com-\nmonly experienced by street-involved people.\nI've shopped around a lot to find the right doctor and finding a\ndoctor who is knowledgeable about the street illnesses, you\nknow, there's no point in me going to see a doctor who deals\nwith the upper echelon, you know, with their illness because\nthose aren't the illnesses I get and they understand it, and they\nsee more patients like myself with the same background so they\nAs for influences at the level of the Canadian health care\nsystem, participants confirmed that bureaucracy, legisla-\ntion, and health care teams exerted an important influence\non rapport. Though participants usually wanted to see a\ndoctor as part of their visit, they often interacted with\nnurses, counselors, reception staff, security, and ambulance\npersonnel first. Physicians function within this team setting\nand their decisions are under the influence of these team\nmembers. Having valid identification to access public\nhealth care was not a given. Furthermore, participants felt\nthat HCPs were unconcerned that their patients' medical\nconditions were not addressed more expediently:\nYou set an appointment and you wait and wait for months down\nthe road to go to see the doctor and they lost your paperwork or\n\"I don't know where it could be, try again next week.\" You\nknow? And I just waited 3 weeks or 4 weeks, they don't care,\nthey don't understand that, there's no compassion. (I3, 395)\nRegardless of whether participants had a regular HCP or\nwhere they accessed health services, most participants\nalluded to frustrating wait times. The longer the participants\nwaited, the more sick from withdrawal and belligerent they\noften became, further damaging their opportunity to estab-\nlish rapport. Participants were upset that the unpleasantness\nof withdrawal and pain, though not life-threatening, were not\ntreated with the same priority as other medical conditions:\nYou go into the emergency and you've got an OD or you've\ndone too much of something you sit and wait there for 4, 5,\n6 hours before anybody sees you and you see people that come\nin after you getting treatment while you're sitting there and if\nyou raise a ruckus then the security runs you out. (I1, 55)\nSimilar to our focus group results, individual interviews\ngravitated overwhelmingly to a discussion of the PWID\u00adHCP\nSalvalaggio et al. 9\ninteraction itself during health care encounters. Non-\ndiscrimination and patient-centered care were confirmed by\nall participants to be key determinants of effective rapport.\nThe HCP use of humor and harm reduction helped to make\ncommunication appropriate to the PWID context:\nI4: He started laughing and said \"why not?\"\nM: [Laughter]\nI4: He just jokes around stuff.\nM: Ya?\nParticipants were more satisfied with visits during which\nthey were treated as equals worthy of the same dignity as\nHCPs themselves:\nI go in to see my family doctor, when he comes through the door\nhe's got a smile on his face \"How you doing [Bob]?\" You go in\nthrough the emergency, it's \"What's the problem?\" it's not a\nperson thing it's an object thing. (I1, 91)\nNegotiation tactics. Patient\u00adHCP interaction in the context of\ninjection drug use is unique in that drug dependence plays a\ncentral role. Disclosure of drug use has several rapport-\nrelated consequences and PWIDs need to decide to what\nextent they can be honest with HCPs. The need for patients\nto obtain drug prescriptions often dominates encounters, and\nwithout addressing this issue, the opportunity to further\ndevelop rapport or explore other health care needs may be\nlost. It is within this context that HCPs and PWID patients\nhave set up certain rules of negotiation to ensure that their\nrespective expectations are satisfied. First, participants could\nnot perceive a consistent HCP standard for dealing with\npatient requests. The specific negotiation strategies used by\nparticipants to procure a prescription, for example, varied\nsignificantly according to the HCP involved. As some par-\nticipants put it, this system or lack of a system essentially\nforced patients to \"play games\" and shop around:\nDepending on how much they give you, I mean, or what you\nneed will probably determine who you're going to go and see.\nAt one end of the spectrum, some HCPs were known for\ntheir blanket refusal to prescribe narcotics, often accompa-\nnied by prominent signage at clinic doors. At the same time,\nparticipants described multiple physician practices with a\nseemingly greater interest in patient volume than individual\nassessment. Many of these practices were known for their\ntendency to prescribe narcotics rather easily without first\nassessing the patient's actual condition. This perceived lack\nof interest on the part of the HCP also impeded rapport devel-\nopment. In this unpredictable environment, participants had\nlearned to read each HCP's behavior and observe their man-\nagement patterns for other PWIDs, and present their case in\na fashion consistent with the HCP's usual practice.\nAs a general rule of negotiation, PWIDs were careful to\ndisclose only the minimal information necessary to procure\ntheir medication. Disclosure of injection, drug diversion, or\nother forms of prescription misuse usually led to abrupt dis-\ncontinuation of existing prescription, and in some cases, ter-\nmination of the HCP\u00adpatient relationship itself. Participants\nalso acknowledged that they needed to be honest enough\nwith their HCP to relate what they needed if they expected to\nhave their needs addressed. Some disclosure was also neces-\nsary to garner a HCP's trust:\nIf I don't say what I need I'm not going to get it you know like,\nbut if I [don't] show them what it is and what I need to get it\ndone to fix it then they really can't really help me right? (I6, 264)\nParticipants also described having to deal with numerous\nHCP-centric rules of negotiation, such as routine questions\nabout drug use patterns, urine drug screens, restricted drug\namounts and dispensing frequencies, and limited treatment\nof chronic pain or issues related to drug dependence (e.g.,\nmental health, infectious diseases). They felt that HCPs\nTable 6.Intercorrelationsa Among Measures of Rapport and Health Care Use: ED Encounter Data.\n1. Autonomy supportiveness -- \n2. Triage assignmentb -.02 -- \nNote.

These stringent rules, com-\nbined with the HCP's powerful position, ultimately left\nmany participants feeling like they had very little autonomy\nover their health care. Several participants spoke of the des-\nperation and punishment inherent to their position in this\npower differential, invoking religious, military, and other\nmetaphors:\nI honestly feel like a prisoner of war. (I7, 458)\nFaced with these rules, participants had developed vari-\nous counter-tactics to advance their agenda in addition to the\nselective disclosure patterns described above. Some partici-\npants believed that it was too difficult to keep track of a con-\nstructed narrative, and preferred to be straightforward with\ntheir health care requests and hope for an understanding pro-\nfessional. Other participants felt that it was best to compro-\nmise, if necessary, and meet a HCP's expectations to justify\nto the HCP that their own requests were also worthy of being\nmet:\nI2: I just want to be treated with respect, but to be treated\nwith respect, you've got to earn respect.\nM: And how do you earn respect?\nI2: Well I think by this time when I go see him and show\nhim my clean arms and I'll tell him, \"Look anywhere\nyou want, you will see no holes.\" And I said now you\nknow \"I'm doing what you want doc and I'm not only\ndoing it for you I'm doing it for me too.\" (278)\nRegardless of the specific negotiation strategies used,\nmost participants relied on their street-honed instincts to\nguide them in their assessment of each health care encounter\nand its likely outcome. Though verbal and nonverbal lan-\nguage and indirect observations of peer-provider encounters\nprovided important clues, participants also alluded to a less\ntangible \"sense\" of whether or not things were going well:\nYou can tell. Just this or this or for example when they say\nsomeone's a racist you can't see it but you can tell so it's the\nsame notion here. You just can tell if they're a human being, it's\njust a certain sense of, you know, a sixth sense of you can tell\nwho's treating you right or who's not. (I8, 37)\nOutcomes of rapport.The quality of the HCP\u00adPWID rela-\ntionship leads to varying degrees of trust, patient satisfac-\ntion, HCP continuity, criminal activity, and compliance with\nrecommendations. PWIDs may also decide where to access\nhealth care or whether to access health care at all based on\ntheir interpersonal experiences.\nQuantitative associations between PWID\u00adHCP rapport\nand patient satisfaction with care were confirmed in follow-\nup interviews, with all participants agreeing that a positive\nrapport experience made them happier with their encounter.\nThis association appeared to be moderated by the patient's\nprescription expectations, but once prescription needs were\naddressed, rapport was an important determinant of overall\nsatisfaction:\nM: Would you say it's associated with feeling more satis-\nfied with the visit? More satisfied with your care in\ngeneral?\nI7: Ya, ya, you feel like you're getting help right from\nsomeone that cares about you. (784)\nThe influence of location was specifically explored in\nindividual interviews because no consensus was reached on\nits effect during focus groups sessions. It became clear that\nlocation is not a key determinant of rapport, but rather an\noutcome of rapport. Participants felt that it was more the\nHCPs in a location as opposed to the location itself, which\nestablished good or bad rapport. For example, PWIDs shared\npositive experiences with certain HCPs in locations other-\nwise perceived as negative:\nWell last time I had pneumonia, and I was down for about\n2 weeks . . . I stayed there for a night and day, and whatever, and\nthen they [found me a shelter bed] and slept there for 4 or 5 days\nabout, they took care of me, they made sure I was warm and they\ngot rid of my cold, they gave me my medications. (I6, 305)\nHowever, a participant and his peers' negative experi-\nences with one or more HCPs in a given facility shaped the\noverall reputation of the facility and influenced their deci-\nsion as to whether they would go back, if given a choice:\nI8: What's really sad, is the [hospital] has a very bad\nreputation.\nM: Really?\nI8: Extremely bad.\nM: Will you avoid going there even if you're close?\nI8: Oh ya. Yup.\nM: Ok, how come?\nI8: Why? Bad experiences. (98)\nSome participants believed that HCP unwillingness to\nnegotiate with patients living with drug dependence set the\nstage for drug-related criminal activity, HCP discontinuity\nand \"doctor shopping.\"\nI don't know, just I guess different days different docs right?\nLike I know a lot of people here that do that too right, they\nswitch doctors, right, all over the city just everywhere, and\nthere's no really there's no really favoritism, it's just the way\ndrug dependence is [Inaudible word] it just makes it go here\nA HCP's commitment to rapport development also\nencouraged some participants to commit to a long-term rela-\ntionship and comply with a HCP's recommendations:\nSalvalaggio et al. 11\nI OD'd and I woke up 3 days later in intensive care . . . and one\nof the social workers there came through and asked the right\nquestions and she got one of the [community health workers] . . .\nto come to see me `cause I was suicidal, I wanted to check out.\nI'd had enough trying to beat this and . . . she came over 3 days\nin a row to see me and just she got me off [to treatment], spent\n3 years out there, got my head back together, my life back\ntogether . . . but that was because I was being treated as an\nindividual. And I felt cared for. (I1, 166)\nDiscussion\nIn contrast to the general population, rapport is defined by\nPWIDs in a distinctly different way, including such elements\nas disclosure, nondiscrimination, and consistency. In keep-\ning with scholarly work on rapport between HCPs and\npatients in more general settings, study participants con-\nfirmed that rapport involves many of the central tenets of the\npatient-centered clinical approach, such as HCP\u00adpatient\ncommunication, partnership, empathy, and continuity.\nSimilarly, rapport is fostered when HCPs adopt autonomy\nsupportive strategies identified in SDT, such as providing\ninformation exchange in a non-controlling way, shared deci-\nsion making, and empathy. Whereas HCP-controlled encoun-\nters limit PWIDs' engagement in their care, shared-control\nencounters foster such engagement. These findings are con-\nsistent with a large body of research using SDT that consis-\ntently demonstrates that that autonomy supportive styles\nfacilitate rapport and engagement in social relationships that\nexhibit power differentials (e.g., between managers and\nemployees or teachers and students; see Deci & Ryan, 2002).\nIn addition to autonomy support, qualitative interview par-\nticipants also equated rapport with disclosure of drug use to\na HCP; this is, perhaps, a PWID-specific manifestation of\npatient-HCP trust. Nondiscrimination is another key con-\ncern; perceived bias against PWIDs damages rapport,\nwhereas the "
