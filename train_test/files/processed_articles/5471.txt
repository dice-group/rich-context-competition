    "abstract": "Abstract\nFrames are organizing principles that are socially shared and persistent over time, and that work symbolically to meaningfully\nstructure the social world. The study of framing has grown over the past decades as mass media has become more and more\nubiquitous in society. People rely on media for information and access to local, national, and world events. This reliance on\nthe media is important to address as news stories are essentially narratives and interpretations--By focusing on one aspect\nof an event and presenting it to an audience, media outlets construct reality. This construction operates by making certain\naspects of stories more salient than others. This salience then \"frames\" an event and provides a reference point for viewers\nin which all subsequent information is judged upon. This article examines the current literature on framing and examines what\ntechniques and methodologies are used by past and present sociologists and media scholars. Particular attention is given to\nthe hermeneutics of frames, that is, how frames and framing influence individuals to interpret events in various ways.\n",

Communication\nparticipates in the formulization and change of reality.\nHours after the attacks on the World Trade Center on\nwho was responsible; speculation abounded concerning\nwhich terrorist groups were likely culprits and what areas of\nthe world were capable of harboring such organizations. The\nusual suspects were identified by every news network. Iraq,\nAfghanistan, and other Middle Eastern countries were men-\ntioned as potential loci for those responsible. These countries\nwere then presented to audiences as potential targets for a\nUnited States'retaliation. State of the art technology allowed\nthe networks to cut directly to reporters stationed in the dis-\ntant countries, and live interviews were carried out, made\npossible by satellite transmissions.\nAbout 12:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, one network cut\nto a correspondent overseas (in a Middle Eastern country--I\nhave forgotten which one). The correspondent was filmed on\ntop of a building while bombs exploded in the distance. He\nthen speculated that the United States had already begun\nretaliating. He turned away from the camera and pointed to\nthe distance where visible explosions could be seen and\nheard. The message conveyed from the correspondent was\nthat the explosions were potentially the result of a United\nStates' counterattack. The quick response was exclusively\nreported on the network (I do not believe any rival networks\nreported such news), no doubt to get the edge and be the first\nto report on the United States' military insurgence.\nAfter this segment, the network went back to a reporter in\nNew York to cover more on the wreckage of the fallen build-\nings.About an hour later, the network cut back to the reporter\nin the Middle East for an update; the reporter then recanted\nhis initial speculation of U.S. retaliation by reporting instead\nthat the bombs dropping in the distance were actually the\nresult of a war between a neighboring country--a daily\noccurrence for the region and not out of the ordinary. In fact,\nattacks within the country had been occurring daily for years.\nIn retrospect, such a quick retaliation by the United States\nwas not likely since information about those responsible was\nstill obscure. However, the interesting aspect to this report\nwas that for the hour after it was initially reported, it seemed\nfeasible, even likely that the news was true. This framing of\nthe event was powerful, albeit grossly misleading. Past\n1California State University, Northridge, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMichael J.

The emergence of radio and television\nallowed messages and information to be transmitted instan-\ntaneously. With mass media's emergence came a new phe-\nnomenon; people more and more depended and relied on\ninformation gathered by individuals whom they have never\nmet. This aspect of mass communications may seem a trivial\npart of contemporary American society, but to treat it as triv-\nial ignores many important implications and assumptions\nimplicit in modern media. People access information from\nmedia news services all the time. News is transmitted glob-\nally almost as soon as it occurs, if not concurrently. This\nincreased reliance on mass media has spawned criticism and\nanalysis by academics interested in communication theory;\nthe hermeneutics of television, radio, and print media are\nubiquitous in the literature on media and popular culture.\nMuch of this literature addresses framing, or how the media\ncreates and re-creates reality through the presentation of\nscripts, pictures, and contexts.\nThis article examines how the study of framing has\nevolved over time, and reviews previous and current work\nthat addresses such phenomena. First, the mechanisms\nbehind the social construction of reality are examined.Asyn-\nopsis of Berger and Luckmann's work on social epistemol-\nogy is presented as a foundation to understanding the\nsociology of frame analysis. Second, the definitions of\nframes and framing are summarized. Scholars have defined\nframes and frame analysis differently; this article addresses\nthese disparities and treats each figure work as a part of the\noverall understanding of framing. Third, the history, research,\nand literature on frames and framing techniques are dis-\ncussed. Particular aspects to framing, such as the ways in\nwhich the media distort events, how time and immediacy\naffect the construction of news, how stories are (or are not)\nplaced within a historical context, and the psychology of\nframing are examined. Finally, empirical examples are given\nto illustrate how frames shape and construct social reality.\nThe Social Construction of Reality\nThere is a vast literature on the social construction of reality.\nBerger and Luckmann's (1966) work set the bar for subse-\nquent research, and their contribution needs to be mentioned\nprior to looking at the more specific manifestations of media\nframing.\nInTheSocialConstructionofReality,BergerandLuckmann\n(1966) address the role of communication and the importance\nof language for social organization. The central theme is that\nlanguage is not only used by human beings as a means of\ncommunication, but it also serves as a defining aspect of\nhumanity. The ability to develop language systems (verbal\nand nonverbal) is a unique factor that separates human beings\nfrom the animal kingdom.\nLanguage and the ability to communicate through sym-\nbolic objectification not only are a determining factor of\nhumanity but also play a crucial role in the organization of\nthe social world. This organization is made possible through\nsymbols and signs: \"A special but crucially important case\nof objectivation is signification, that is, the human produc-\ntion of signs. A sign may be distinguished from other objec-\ntivations by its explicit intention to serve as an index of\nHuman social organization depends on this sign system:\n\"Intersubjective sedimentation\" can be called social only\nwhen it has been objectified in a sign system of one kind or\nanother--that is, when the possibility of reiterated objectifi-\ncation of the shared experiences arises (Berger & Luckmann,\nis at the core of society's fundamental dialectic. It \"pro-\ngrams\" the channels in which externalization produces an\nobjective world, objectifying it through language and the\ncognitive apparatus based on language. In other words, it\norders the world into objects that are in turn \"apprehended,\"\nUnderstanding the basic mechanisms to how meanings are\nconstructed and shared is necessary before delving into the\nepistemology of framing. Berger and Luckmann (1966) rig-\norously analyze how reality is socially constructed. Their\nwork provides the underpinnings for frame analysis.\nResearch on television provides an example of how\nBerger and Luckmann's (1966) work can be applied to\nunderstand contemporary media. G. E. Lang and Lang (1984;\nLipschultz & Hilt, 1999) illustrate how television is used to\nshape viewers' perceptions of reality:\n1. Television emphasizes close-up views creating a sense of\nfamiliarity with distant people and places.\n2. Live event coverage gives viewers a sense of participation\nin public affairs.\n3. Television pictures seem authentic to viewers.\n4. Television coverage may provide a more complete picture of\nthe event than any other media. (G. E. Lang & Lang, 1984, p. 26)\nTelevision thus shapes perceptions in a way unique to the\nmedium. Specifically, Berger and Luckmann's (1966) work\nhelp one understand how television frames segments of\nreality by producing images and messages that are seem-\ningly complete. Given that people spend so much time\nwatching television, it is no surprise how influential the\nmedium can be. According to constructivist media effects\nmodels, audiences rely on versions of reality built from per-\nsonal experience, interaction with peers, and interpreted\nselections from the mass media (Neuman et al., 1992;\nScheufele, 1999). The dynamic of the media (television and\nother forms of media) simply introduces additional filters\nfor perceiving the social world.\nBerger and Luckmann's (1966) work is relevant to all\nsubsequent research on media framing. Tuchman's (1978)\nrhetoric resonates closely with the themes developed in The\nSocial Construction of Reality: \"The act of making news is\nthe act of constructing reality itself rather than a picture of\nreality\" (p. 12). Now that the ways in which humans con-\nstruct reality has been briefly addressed, the more specific\nsubject of frames and frame analysis is examined.\nDefining Frames:\nHow Media Construct Reality\nFrame analysis has its origins in sociology as well as media\ntheory. Erving Goffman (1974) wrote extensively on the\ntopic, and was one of the first sociologists to use frame anal-\nysis for explaining social phenomena. For Goffman, frames\nrefer to the definitions of a situation that are built up in accor-\ndance with principles of organization, which govern social\nevents and our subjective involvement in them. Frame analy-\nsis then refers to the examination of frames in terms of the\norganization of experience (Goffman, 1974). Entman offers\nanother definition of frames:\nTo frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and\nmake them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way\nas to promote a particular problem definition, causal\ninterpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment\nrecommendation for the item described. (Entman, 1993, p. 52,\nFrames help organize facts, and facts take on meaning by\nbeing embedded in some larger system of meaning or frame\n(Gamson et al., 1992). Frames provided references for the\npublic about what is important, and the media has great\npower because of this.1 A basic proposition to this is that the\nperceived salience of a public issue will be directly related to\nthe amount of coverage given to that issue by the mass media\n(Holz & Wright, 1979). The following section gives a more\ndetailed account of the nuances among definitions of frames\nand framing.\nThe Framing Tradition\nPast work on framing has used assorted definitions.\nStephen D. Reese summarizes many of these definitions in\n\"Prologue--Framing Public Life: A Bridging Model for\nMedia Research\" (Reese, Gandy, & Grant, 2001). For\nexample, in Entman's previous definition of framing,\nframes are understood as those media images that focus on\none aspect of reality, elevating the importance of that real-\nity. Another definition of frames is provided by Tankard et\nal. (1991): \"A frame is a central organizing idea for news\ncontent that supplies a context and suggests what the issue\nis through the use of selection, emphasis, exclusion, and\nMorley (1976) offer additional definitions of framing. For\nIyengar, framing encompasses subtle alterations in a state-\nment or a presentation of an issue, whereas Morley sees\nframes as \"the basic conceptual and ideological `frame-\nwork' through which events are presented and as a result of\nwhich they come to be given one dominant/primary mean-\nOther contributors to the understanding of framing\nGitlin (1980). Hall treats frames as any presented material\nthat sets a criterion for any future information; for example,\nif an event is initially framed in a context, then any future\ninformation regarding that event will be understood in the\nway it was initially framed. Gamson and Modigliani define\nframes as central organizing ideas that make sense of rele-\nvant events (Reese, 2001). Goffman's work reveals how\nframes classify phenomena, allowing the user to locate, per-\nceive, identify, and label a potentially infinite number of\noccurrences (Reese, 2001). Edelman's conception of fram-\ning addresses how frames exert power in the way they are\nclassified and categorized. Hertog and McLeod see frames\nas defining a context for an occurrence. Frames are used to\ninterpret events and allow one to determine what informa-\ntion is useful or relevant for a situation. Sieff (2003) defines\nframes as the means by which media information is orga-\nnized, presented, and interpreted. Pan and Kosicki (1993)\nview framing analysis as a constructivist approach to ana-\nlyzing news discourse and practically functional dimen-\nsions. News discourse is a \"sociocognitive process that\ninvolves sources, journalists, and audience members func-\ntioning in a shared culture according to socially defined\nFinally, Gitlin (1980) views frames as \"the persistent pat-\nterns of cognition, interpretation, and presentation, of selec-\ntion, emphasis, and exclusion, by which symbol-handlers\nroutinely organize discourse\" (p. 7). Gitlin emphasizes the\nroutine organization that transcends any given story and is\npersistent over time, or any story that is resistant to change;\nfor example, journalists use frames to recognize them as\ninformation and to assign them to \"cognitive categories\"\nassignment to cognitive categories give frames a unique\npower, which actively brings an otherwise amorphous reality\ninto a meaningful structure. This makes framing more than\nthe simple inclusion or exclusion of information--frames are\n\"active, information generating, as well as screening devices\"\n4 SAGE Open\nThese definitions for frames and framings vary in their\nmethodology and meaning. Perhaps the best definition for\nframing is offered by Reese (2001). For Reese, framing is\nconcerned with the way \"interests, communicators,\nsources, and culture combine to yield coherent ways of\nunderstanding the world, which are developed using all of\nthe available verbal and visual symbolic resources\"; spe-\ncifically, \"frames are organizing principles that are socially\nshared and persistent over time, that work symbolically to\nmeaningfully structure the social world\" (Reese, 2001,\np. 11). The author addresses each aspect of this definition\nsystematically:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Organizing: Framing varies in how successfully, com-\nprehensively, or completely it organizes information.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Principles: The frame is based on an abstract principle\nand is not the same as the texts through which it mani-\nfest itself.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Shared: The frame must be shared on some level for it\nto be significant and communicable.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Persistent: The significance of frames lies in their\ndurability, their persistent, and routine use over time.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Symbolically: The frame is revealed in symbolic\nforms of expression.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Structure: Frames organize by providing identifiable\npatterns or structures, which can vary in their\ncomplexity.\nReese's six aspects to framing are important to address in\ndetail to understand how frames emerge, persist, and affect\nindividuals and audiences. Because all previous definitions\nof frames resonate more or less with Reese's definition, his\nwork will be the focus here. He provides one of the best,\nsystematic treatments of frames and framing effects.\nThe Organization of Frames. The initial question concerning a\nframe is whether the frame is successful in accounting for the\nsocial reality in which it represents. Frames can be organized\nin numerous ways. The organization of frames can be exam-\nined in numerous ways as well. Two ways to address and\ninterpret fames are through cognition and culture:\nCognitively organized frames invite us to think about social\nphenomena in a certain way, often by appealing to basic\npsychological biases . . . \"cultural\" frames don't stop with\norganizing one story, but invite us to marshal a cultural\nunderstanding and keep on doing so beyond the immediate\ninformation. These are the \"strategic\" frames that speak to a\nbroader way to account for social reality. (Reese, 2001, pp.\nExaminations of frames must address the scope of the\nframe to determine how they organize, document, and\nexplain reality. Specifically, frames should be addressed with\nthe following questions in mind (Reese, 2001):\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 In the representation of reality, how much framing is\noccurring?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How adequate is the frame to contain the elements it\nproposes to embrace?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How close is the frame to contain the elements it pro-\nposes to embrace?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How close is the frame to that promoted by sources or\nindicated by an event?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Is the frame convincing in accounting for reality?\nCrucial to understanding how frames are organized is that\nframes are more than just the sum of the parts in a particular\nstory. They add up to something bigger than an individual\nstory because reports of events are usually in reference to\nprevious or similar episodes. For example, a report on a bur-\nglary is not likely to be framed as an isolated event. It has\npotential to be linked to other burglaries or crime in general,\nwhich potentially attaches new meanings to the event.\nTherefore, frames can be organized around larger themes\nthat can influence the interpretation of individual events.\nThe Principles of Frames.Treating frames as \"principles\"\nmeans that frames have abstract qualities: \"Ultimately, frames\nmay best be viewed as an abstract principle, tool, or `sche-\nmata' of interpretation that works through media texts to\nrepresent a sort of taxonomy which provides general refer-\nences for specific manifestations or events. The abstract prin-\nciples allow the media and audiences to organize information.\nWhile frames organize information, they are inevitably part\nof a much larger set of structures (or social ideology) that\nfinds its emergence in the text. To ignore the principle that\ngives rise to the frame is to take media texts at face value, and\nAn important thing to keep in mind when addressing\nmedia frames and interpretations of events is exactly what\nconstitutes something as an event. Events are socially con-\nstructed, and do not exist in a vacuum, so to speak. An occur-\nrence must be first labeled as an event, and then such an event\ncan potentially be framed. This is a crucial point to consider\nwhen examining media framing. After such occurrences are\ndefined as events, framing can further blur objective reality.\nThe abstract principles of framing are used by news media;\ndoing so shifts the objective occurrence into a subjective\nevent. Reese summarizes the abstraction of framing:\n[A] frame is a moment in a chain of signification. As sources\npromote \"occurrences\" into \"events,\" as journalists define and\nseek out information that fits their organizing ideas, frames can\nhelp designate any number of moments when we can say that a\ncertain organizing principle was operating to shape reality.\nThese moments being fluid makes it risky for us to fix at one\npoint in time that happens to be most visible, such as in a news\nThe Sharing of Frames. Frames structure reality, and they do\nso with shared meaning. An event is interpreted by those\nwho witness it, and then conveyed to others in various forms\n(pertaining to media, frames are shared through written,\nvisual, or auditory messages [or a combination of all three]).\nGiven the fact that frames are shared and that they must be\nshared \"in order to be useful and noteworthy organizing\ndevices,\" frames must be examined in terms of the degree to\nextent of how frames are communicated and shared between\npeople helps determine the nature of the frame. Frames can\nbe personal and idiosyncratic, social and shared, or cultural\n(if the frames are broadly connected to many people; Reese,\n2001). An example of this is provided by Neuman, Just, and\nCrigler (1992) in a study that examined the shared meaning\nof frames. What was found was that news media used differ-\nent frames than what audiences identified with--News\nmedia generally used tactical frames (such as \"conflict\" and\n\"powerlessness\"), whereas audience members \"relied on\nsuch frames as `human impact' and `moral values'\" (Reese,\n2001). Basic to understanding the connection of shared\nmeaning with regard to frames is that the acceptance and\nsharing of a media frame depends on what understandings\nthe individual brings to the \"text\" to produce negotiated\nThe Persistence of Frames.Frames are most influential\nwhen they persist over time. The persistence, or ongoing\nrepetition of frames, creates meanings that are resistant to\nchange. If constantly inundated with information that is\nframed in a specific way, an individual is likely to treat that\nframed referent of reality as reality itself. By routinizing\nframes, they become engrained in one's conscience as ref-\nerence points. Future information concerning similar\nevents will be processed and compared with past events,\nwhich are interpreted through frames. Information is fil-\ntered by using past events that trigger conceptualization of\nreality as it has been previously framed. The more persis-\ntent the frame, the more the frame is used as a comparator\nfor new information:\nRoutinization suggests that a frame has a second-nature, well\nentrenched, and built into the way of doing things . . . This\nresistance to change, indicated by such a routine, suggests in\nfunctional terms that we've stumbled upon a structure that is\nsatisfying some important need. The more persistent the\nframe, the more likely it deserves examination. (Reese, 2001,\nThe Symbolic Nature of Frames. Frames work symbolically in\nhow they are manifested and communicated in their various\nforms (Reese, 2001). The symbolism of frames is one of the\nmost important aspects to how frames operate. Much research\nhas been done that examines how symbols influence audi-\nences through framing techniques. Symbolism in framing is\nlikened to the metaphor of an iceberg; the obvious texts that\nare visible are only part of the message conveyed through\nframes (Reese, 2001). Content is only the tip of the iceberg,\nsymbolic representations are communicated at levels many\ntimes far below the \"surface.\"\nBy structuring frames within symbolic contexts, media\noutlets exclude information that does not fit: \"[T]he way we\nemphasize symbolic content and handle its measurement\nstructures the conclusions we may reach about framing\"\n(Reese, 2001, p. 17). Viewpoints can be inferred by the fram-\ning of an issue. For example, Reese (2001) uses the abortion\ndebate to illustrate this point. Stories concerning abortion can\nbe couched as pro-life or pro-choice. Framing abortion as\nsuch might define the themes to the audience as a dichoto-\nmous issue, but there could be other perspectives. Reese\nexplains further how treating a story like abortion in this man-\nner can be problematic:\n[One] might ask, for example, if a story is better characterized as\npro-life or pro-choice? This, however, may fix the terrain\nprematurely--viewing news stories as neutral vessels, holding\nvarious pro and con positions. But what were the choices\navailable for the story, what were the structured tendencies to\nproduce stories containing a balance of certain views? What\nwere the rules working to screen out particular perspectives?\nSuch questions are important to pose when analyzing\nframes and their symbolic representations.\nThe Structure of Framing.When media frame events, they\nstructure the social world. These structures involve patters\nthat emerge from any number of symbolic devices (Reese,\n2001). When an issue is originally framed, patterns may not\nexist. However, as media cover issues regarding the original\nevent thereafter, frames become dominant structures that\naffect interpretation (examples of how frames gain in com-\nplexity and coherence of structure over time are illustrated\nlater in this article). Gamson's (1992) work focuses on the\nway that frame metaphors draw attention to subjects, that is,\nhow the principles of organization create coherent meanings\nby \"combining symbols, giving them relative emphasis, and\nattaching them to larger cultural ideas\" (Reese, 2001, p. 17).\nFrames are embedded and complex, and are not conducive\nfor examination as single indicators. This is not to confuse\nthe ability to define the frame, which can vary from easy to\ndifficult depending on the subject, but rather to affirm that\nframes are structural manifestations, which order the inter-\npretation of reality.\nNews media organize stories; frame structures\ncall attention to the internal organization within news stories . . .\nBy tacking the question of how meaning is structured, framing\nrelates closely to ideological analysis, but it places greater\nemphasis on the nature of the organizing structures and how\n6 SAGE Open\nTo sum up the definitions and characteristics of frames\nand framing devices, frames convey meanings that are orga-\nnized, abstract (or principled), shared, usually persistent,\nsymbolic, and structured. Next, specific aspects of framing\nare discussed as examined in the literature.\nRhetoric as Framing-in-Praxis\nAn additional aspect of framing regards rhetoric, both in\neveryday interactions and in more structured organizational\ndomains. Rhetoric regards the manner in which one speaks\nas a means of communication or persuasion. When one con-\nsiders the art of persuasion as a combination of context and\nlanguage, one can see that the art of rhetoric relies heavily on\nframing. What elements are included in rhetoric--and just as\nimportantly what elements are excluded--serve to frame\narguments in specific ways and make some meanings more\nsalient than others.\nPoliticians learn early on the power of rhetoric in their\npolitical strategies. How one frames a social issue can be the\nsole determinant of how the public perceives the issue. For\nexample, gay marriage is a controversial issue that is cur-\nrently being debated in public discourse. One can argue--\nquite persuasively--for or against gay marriage. The way\none frames such an argument can greatly influence one's\nresponse to that argument. By framing gay marriage as a\nthreat to the American family, one attaches a meaning struc-\nture that invokes specific emotions. To be \"for gay marriage\"\nthen becomes being \"against America.\" On the other hand,\nframing the opposition of gay marriage as a civil right infrac-\ntion akin to discriminatory practices of America's past cre-\nates an entirely different persuasive stance. Denying one the\nright of matrimony based on sexual orientation then labels\none a bigot. This example illustrates that framing can occur\nin many different domains--even in the simple contexts of\neveryday life. Rhetoric thus plays a key element in how\nframes are defined in social environments. Frames are not\njust visual: They are embedded in language itself.\nResearch and Literature\non Frames and Framing\nDistortion\nOne aspect to how the media construct reality concerns the\ndistortion of events. Unless one holds an extremely postmod-\nern view about the nature of reality, events occur in an objec-\ntive manner; when a dog bites a man, there is direct, causal\nevidence that logically follows--A bite exists where it once\ndid not and the bite is the result of the dog attacking the man.\nSuch a common occurrence seems so simple that any inter-\npretation of the event apart from the dog biting the man in\ntemporal order seems improbable. Yet, it is important to\nunderstand that the reporting of such events requires inter-\npretation, and interpretation can lead to misrepresentations\nof objective reality. This becomes clearer for media outlets as\nmany times those reporting and broadcasting events are not\nthere to witness them. Accounts of the event are usually\ntaken from those involved, and those involved are likely to\nhave varying interpretations of what unfolded. Our simple\nexample of a dog biting a man can potentially be tricky\nbecause of discordant interpretations. In addition, an account\nand broadcast of such an event will only have the man's ver-\nsion of the story; dogs cannot speak. One can see how such a\nsimple, trivial event can be misconstrued and presented sub-\njectively. Because of this, the presentation of events by the\nmedia always risks distorting what really occurred.\nDavid Altheide's (1976) work addresses media distortion.\nFor Altheide, \"events become news when transformed by the\nnews perspective, and not because of their objective charac-\nteristics\" (p. 173). He cites the Watergate scandal as an\nexample of how the media can distort the meanings of events,\narguing that \"Nixon fell from power because the news per-\nspective transformed the series of events of Watergate into a\nwhole, which was then used as evidence of corruption and\noccurred over time, and each breaking story built on previ-\nous ones. Altheide's point is to show the difficulty of con-\ntinually presenting stories objectively as they build on one\nanother. An initial story about an event might be quite objec-\ntive and accurately representative of reality, but as individual\nstories emerge that attempt to explain a greater event, fram-\ning more and more becomes an aspect of news production.\nAltheide does have critics, however. M. G. Dunn (1977)\nclaims that such representations of the media are irresponsi-\nble. For instance, framing the Watergate scandal as a moral\nstory in which the fabric of society is altered is not necessar-\nily a distortion of the events. The actions of those who par-\nticipated in the Watergate break-in and cover up were\noperating immorally; therefore, media representation of the\nevents as immoral should not be problematic. Regardless of\nthe media's treatment of this specific example, the potential\nof distorting events and misinterpreting information is\nalways a factor. The distortion of the truth is one way that\nreality can be framed by the media.\nTime\nTime is an important aspect to understanding how media\n(especially news media) construct reality. It is obvious that\nmedia outlets work in a temporal setting in which deadlines\nare common. It is not as obvious how such constraints influ-\nence the ways that media affects an audiences' perceptions.\nSociologists such as Emile Durkheim and Max Weber\naddressed time as a contextual phenomenon. For Durkheim,\ntime is an objectified product--a result of social interaction\nand social life rather than an a priori category; Weber\nexamined time as a crucial component in Western capital-\nism--a scarce commodity that represented earning potential\n(Schlesinger, 1977). Both sociologists, while long gone,\noffer insight on how the media shape reality. Because broad-\ncasts are limited by time and stories take time to develop and\npresent, media outlets filter and redefine the temporal sense\nof what is real.\nAn example of this is provided by contemporary news\nmedia. Immediacy is a premium for news outlets of all sorts;\ntelevision, radio, and print media all depend on the alacrity\nof sources, reporters, camera teams, editors, and technicians\nto produce stories. Philip Schlesinger (1977) provides an\ninsight to the importance and impact of immediacy:\nIt is clear that there is a systematic relationship between the time\nconcepts which comprise part of the newsman's occupational\nknowledge and the demands created by the organization of\nwork. But the newsman's conception of time is more than just a\nresponse to the constraints posed by the newsday production\ncycle . . . Immediacy is to be measured as a true virtue.\nThis mention of immediacy as a virtue is important to\nunderstand how time influences newsmakers production of\nreality. Time here becomes a goal; it is woven into the fabric\non the institution of news production. Because it is such a\npremium, the types of stories and the way in which they are\npresented are always within a temporal context. For televi-\nsion and radio, stories are selected and drafted for presenta-\ntion according to time slots. These time slots have been\nstandardized; television and radio allot time for hard news,\nsoft news, sports, market reports, and so on. Therefore, when\nan audience is engaged in a media, broadcast reality is con-\nstructed based on time allocation of specific subjects.\nHistorical Context.A final aspect to how time affects the\nsocial construction of reality deals with media and historical\ncontext. More and more, news media operate in the present\nand do not attach meaning to events as an effect of prior his-\ntorical causes:\nNews, as it emerges each day, and as it is conceived, stands in\nradical opposition to history. Indeed, the system of newsday cycles\nhas a tendency to abolish historical awareness, creating a perpetual\nseries of foregrounds at the expense of depth and background. In\nphilosophical terms, we could argue that to be obsessed with a\nparticular duration (the day) has come to overburden the awareness\nVery little news occurs randomly or outside of historical\ncontext, especially when considering national network news.\nNonetheless, because of time constraints, space limitations,\nand other institutionalized boundaries specific to media,\nevents cannot always be contextualized sequentially.\nTelevision, radio, and print media usually do not have the\ntime nor space to fully develop every story as part of a greater\ncontext that has its place in history or other events. Because\nof this, stories are framed apart from their whole, making\ncertain aspects more salient than others.\nThe Psychology of Framing\nTo this point, framing has been discussed as a media phe-\nnomenon. However, frames and the effects of the media on\nindividuals vary. Framing plays the same role in analyzing\nmedia discourse that schema does in cognitive psychology;\neach is a central organizing principle that holds together and\ngives coherence and meaning to a diverse array of symbols\n(Gamson et al., 1992). Psychologically, frames maintain a\nuseful \"tension\" or \"balance\" between structure and agency\n(framing bridges the gap between cognition and culture)--\nevents and experiences are framed, and we frame events and\nand the media's construction of reality influence public opin-\nion, but to what extent? The following discussion examines\nsusceptibility and mechanisms that sway public opinion.\nFrames are not to be linked or likened directly with sug-\ngestion, or more specifically persuasion. Framing of events\nis more subtle and involves a psychological component that\nis removed from \"message level\" communication;\nFrames are distinct not only at the message level but at the\npsychological level as well . . . frames differ from other message\nforms not just in their overt structure and substance but also in\nthe way the affect popular thinking about public affairs. (Nelson,\nFrames also work psychologically by generating more or\nless cognitive responses from individuals concerning social\nThe way an event is framed by the media can be inter-\npreted in various ways, specifically frames can be \"episodic\"\nor \"thematic\" (Bullock, Fraser, & Williams, 2001; Iyengar,\nfocus on individual cases and encourage an audience to make\nFor example, viewers presented with a news broadcast con-\ncerning a societal issue such as the homeless will be inclined\nto blame the problem on individual motivation. Homelessness\nis interpreted as resulting from a lack of effort by people that\nrefuse to assimilate and work in the greater society. One the\nother hand, \"thematic\" frames focus more on broader social\nissues, such as social, political, and economic forces; these\nframes encourage viewers to make external attributions\nhomelessness in the context of a thematic frame would be\ninterpreted as resulting from forces in society much greater\nthan the individual. The homeless are not destitute because\nof their lack of effort or unwillingness to work but rather\nbecause of economic and political forces that suppress them.\nEach of these framing techniques is a powerful mechanism\nthat influences viewers.\nFraming and Belief Structures. A distinction needs to be made\nabout how the psychology of framing operates apart from\n8 SAGE Open\npersuasive messages and belief structures. Nelson et al.\ntures operate:\n[T]he standard model of communication-based persuasion\ntypically involves a source who presents a message about an\nattitude object to an audience. If the audience member both\nunderstands and believes the message, and the message is\ndiscrepant from his or her prior attitude, then the attitude should\nchange in the direction implied by the message. (Nelson et al.,\nBelief structures operate under the implicit assumption\nthat the audience is unaware of the content of the message.\nCommunicators that influence audiences are presenting new\ninformation, that is, information that \"contains positive or\nnegative information about the attitude object not already\npart of the recipients'knowledge or belief structure\" (Nelson\nare not connected to preexisting information; frames operate\nby activating information that exists in the individual's\nstocks of knowledge. The mechanism here is much more\nsubtle than persuasion. Persuasion techniques attempt to\nshift an individual's opinion from one stance to another by\nproviding new information. Framing effects redefine opin-\nions or perceptions.\nThe power and interpretation of belief messages and\nframing depends on the type of individual. People vary in\nterms of their ability to accept or resist information as repre-\nsentative of reality. This variance is a function of sophistica-\ntion (Nelson et al., 1997). The more sophisticated an\nindividual, the less susceptible they are to being persuaded\nby messages (messages likened to belief structures). For\nexample, moderately sophisticated people are more likely to\nbe persuaded because they are capable of receiving and com-\nprehending messages, but may not have the ability to resist\nthe messages. On the other hand, sophisticated people can\ngenerally receive and comprehend messages yet be unaf-\nfected by the persuasion due to a greater ability to differenti-\nate the meaning of media messages (Nelson et al., 1997).\nWhile the ability of the sophisticated to resist temptation is\nseen as a function of belief structures, Nelson et al. (1997)\ntested whether framing effects are similar, that is, whether an\nindividual's level of sophistication mattered when presented\nwith framed media information. The authors hypothesized\nthat sophistication would be irrelevant concerning framing\neffects and the ways individuals interpret framed messages:\n\"[U]nlike standard persuasion models, framing effects do not\ndepend upon the recipient's acceptance of the message's\nassertions . . . more- and less-sophisticated subjects do not\ndiffer in their comprehension of framed messages\" (Nelson\nframing effects because framing operates by making particu-\nlar considerations more salient. This salience in turn creates\na susceptibility to messages that are not more influential on\nthe unsophisticated, in fact potentially the opposite. The\nmore sophisticated may be more affected by framing because\nsuch individuals are more likely to have preexisting knowl-\nedge that is aligned with the content of the frame.\nThese aspects to framing reveal the psychological mecha-\nnisms behind framing in ways that are perhaps counterintui-\ntive. Nelson et al.'s work delineates how framing operates in\nsubtle, sometimes odd ways to shape elements of reality.\nAside from the psychological impact of frames, another\nimportant dynamic to remember is that frames are communi-\ncated through stories. Stories are simply narratives, which\nare discussed in the following section, using deviance as an\nexample of how news stories frame the world.\nDeviance: How Narratives\nCreate a World of Conflict\nJournalists, reporters, and editors work together to produce\nnews. News production involves the delivery of information,\nand information must be written before it can be transmitted.\nSince the news is written, journalists are essentially telling\nstories about what events occur. Such narrations are usually\nframed in a certain context; they represent reality subjec-\ntively rather than objectively. From this understanding, a\nframe represents a storyline or \"unfolding narrative\" about\nan issue; \"Narratives are organizations of experience . . .\nThey bring order to events by making them something that\ncan be told about; they have power because make the world\nlogical terms, journalists tell stories within a narrative frame-\nwork that has salience in popular reality (Ericson, 1998;\nAn example of how such narratives frame reality and\nskew the objectivity of reality is found in the content of\nnews. By and large, many news stories tend to involve devi-\nance of some ilk. Crime stories are very common on televi-\nsion and in print media; in fact, they are ubiquitous. It is\nprobably a safe assumption that most people do not experi-\nence crime in their lives proportionately to what is presented\non the nightly news or is written in daily newspapers. If one\ndoubts this assertion, then it is even more questionable\nwhether the audience who reads, watches, and listens to the\nnews experiences such ratio of crime and deviant behavior\n(most people [specifically Americans] who are drawn to\nprint news and television news are more likely to live away\nfrom locations where violent crimes commonly occur, for\nexample, Americans view images of war and terrorism daily\nbut rarely are confronted with them). Because of such an\nemphasis on deviance in news stories, the news often frames\nthe world in a negative fashion. One's lens to the world, as\npresented through the news media, is a filtered vision of con-\nflict, violence, and instability. The similarities of ordinary\nexperience and narratives that shape reality are discordant.\nExamples of Media Framing\nFraming in Politics\nThere are many examples of how the media has framed\nevents in contexts other than reality. The incident where\nDemocratic candidate Howard Dean rallied an audience dur-\ning a campaign speech provides an example of media fram-\ning. Those in attendance during the rally were not moved in\nthe same way as those who viewed news coverage of the\nevent. The media framing of the event portrayed Dean as a\nraving lunatic who incited the crowd to a maddening frenzy.\nTelevision broadcasts focused in on Dean's face and torso,\nand thus thematically set the tone of the event. Dean's\nappearance on film was removed from others. The perspec-\ntive of him in relation to the crowd created a much different\nimage for those watching on television. The impact of the\nevent was massive--Dean's on screen meltdown was the\nimage that lingered in people's minds, and will likely be part\nof his legacy. The media had a major impact on how Dean\nwas presented, and the framing of the event was discordant\nwith the interpretation of those who witnessed it in person.\nAnother classic example of media framing is provided by\nK. Lang and Lang (1953). As evident in the previous exam-\nple, public events are often interpreted differently by those in\nattendance compared with those that view coverage on tele-\nvision. \"MacArthur Day\" in Chicago offers a perfect exam-\nple of this. MacArthur's arrival was seen as a significant\nevent, and media coverage portrayed it as such. However, for\nthose in attendance, the impact of the event was discordant\nwith those that witnessed its coverage on television. A close\ninspection of the event reveals how and why the discordance\noccurred:\nExamination of a public event by mass-observation and by\ntelevision revealed considerable discrepancy between these two\nexperiences. The contrast in perspectives points to three items\nwhose relevance in structuring a televised event can be inferred\nfrom an analysis of the television content. (K. Lang & Lang,\nThese three items included the following: (a) The arbi-\ntrary sequencing of the event structured the event in terms of\nforeground and background. This created a technological\nbias is the determination of what was important (from the\nperspective of television personnel). (b) The structuring of\nthe event by an announcer greatly affected the perceptions of\nthose watching the event on television. Announcers' com-\nmentary allows the viewer to maintain a particular perspec-\ntive while images shift rapidly from scene to scene. Viewers\ngain a stable orientation this way. Commentary in television\nmedia is even more salient in contemporary news stories\nbecause of the ultrarapid shifts of images common in today's\nnews broadcasts. (c) Reciprocal effects allowed the media to\nmodify the event itself by \"staging it in a way to make it\nmore suitable for telecasting and creating among the actors\nthe consciousness of acting for a larger audience\" (K. Lang\nMacArthur day, the event was transformed into a drama that\nfocused (or framed) specific aspects for the audience. The\nmedia in this example presented the event as a drama that\nwas disconnected from the reality of those who experienced\nit. Whether intentional or not, news media construct reality\nby constituting an event as news (Duhe & Zoch, 1994; Lester,\nThe way the media affect public opinion about politics in\nresearch has suggested that news media, by framing news in\nnegative ways, have influenced the general demeanor of the\npublic toward political issues and politics in general\nFraming in Sports\nAnother example of media framing comes from sporting\nevents. Recent news on professional athletics provides\nexamples of media framing. The past decades have proven\nturbulent for professional sports regarding players using ille-\ngal substances. Various professional athletes have paid fines,\nserved suspensions, and served jail time for violating league\ndrug policies, ranging from banned substances (anabolic ste-\nroids, growth hormones, etc.) to narcotics (illicit, controlled\nsubstances such as cocaine, marijuana, and other drugs).\nRecently, steroids and growth hormones have been the center\nof many news stories concerning professional sports, specifi-\ncally those related to Major League Baseball. The issue of\nsteroids and performance enhancing drugs has received so\nmuch attention that even President GeorgeW. Bush addressed\nit in a state of the union address. Bush proclaimed that the\ntime had come for professional sports to, once and for all,\nclean up their act and make strides to eliminate the abuse of\nsteroids by athletes.\nAn interesting aspect to the reporting on steroids and ath-\nletes that use steroids has been the way in which such stories\nare framed. One way to interpret an athlete who uses steroids\nis that he or she has broken the law--many steroids and\ngrowth hormones are not only banned by professional sports\norganizations but are illegal to possess, use, or distribute.\nThis interpretation frames the athlete who abuses such a sub-\nstance as a criminal, one who has knowingly broken the law\nby engaging in illegal activities. However, this is not the way\nin which the media has framed the abuse of steroids. Athletes\nare not usually arrested when they test positive for steroids or\nare caught with them, as they might be if they possessed\namounts of marijuana or cocaine. Instead, such athletes are\nreprimanded and disciplined by the commissioner in their\nrespective leagues. This fact greatly affects the way that the\nmedia thematically frame steroid use. Such stories are placed\nwithin a context apart from those that concern drug use and\nabuse; athletes that are caught using steroids are not crimi-\nnals, instead they are seen as disgracing themselves and the\ngame in which they play. The latter aspect to this is what is\nmost interesting and reveals the power of media framing. A\nvery different interpretation is applied to such athletes'\nbehavior, one that places their action not at the individual\nlevel but at the group level.\nThe framing of steroid use as affecting the \"integrity of\nthe game\" is ubiquitous in sports media. Such sound bytes\nare often attached to such stories, and when new events occur\nan audience understands it as a contamination of the purity of\nthe sport rather than as a criminal offense; this interpretation\nis perpetuated by framing. Many news stories that relate to\nsports are framed differently than stories concerning politics\nor other themes. Using frame analysis reveals how events\ncan be defined in very different terms, even though they\nmight have similar elements and relate to similar aspects of\nreality.\nFraming and Health\nAnother example of media framing concerns reports of epi-\ndemics. When new illnesses are discovered, especially those\nthat are suspected of being caused by air-born viruses, they\nare reported by mass media. Such reports tend to frame such\nevents in ways that create paranoia and great concern in the\ngeneral public. Specific examples of this include the media's\ncoverage of the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)\nbreakout and the anthrax scare after the terrorist attacks on\nthe United States. Both events were newsworthy for obvious\nreasons; each involved issues that are potentially relevant to\nevery human being on the planet and each had great imme-\ndiacy. Retrospectively, the attention given to each by U.S.\nmedia was not proportional to the actual impact of the phe-\nnomenon. Comparatively few people were affected by the\nso-called outbreak of either anthrax or SARS, even though\neach event was framed with the understanding that great dan-\nger was imminent. SARS was not the epidemic in which it\nwas framed, and less than 10 people died from anthrax in\nAmerica. The framing of these events is understandable;\nthey deal with the unknown. The interest here is that the\nframing of such events creates an interpretation of reality.\nAfter all, what has proven more dangerous, events such as\nSARS and anthrax or other problems such as heart disease?\nHeart disease kills many more people than did SARS or\nanthrax, yet it is framed in a different way. It is interesting to\ncompare frames; doing so reveals how powerful the media is\nin presenting certain aspects of reality. The importance of\nevents can be obscure or misplaced by the way that events\nare framed and the context in which they are placed.\nThe Variance of Framing\nTechniques Across Media\nIn concluding this discussion of the examples of media\nframing, it is important to address how individual media\nframe reality in distinctive ways. For example, newspapers\nframe events in ways that are unique to print media. Stories\nin newspapers are given precedence by their placement\nwithin the paper. The more pressing, \"important\" stories are\nusually placed at the top of each page, and the most pertinent\nstories of the day are located on the front page. In addition,\nreaders are given cues that signify a story's importance; word\nplacement, font size, and color all provide references for a\nstory's level of impact and importance. These techniques\nframe reality by providing cues and making certain types of\nevents more salient than others (e.g., war and conflict are\noften salient visions of reality in print media).\nTelevision frames reality in different ways. Televised\nnews broadcasts also involve narratives that tell stories, simi-\nlar to the way that print media use texts, but television also\nframes moving images. To understand this better, consider a\npanoramic view of an ocean sunset. The image spans a great\ndistance from left to right, and also from top to bottom. If one\nwere to hold up an empty picture frame in front of them, the\nimage within the frame becomes far different from the origi-\nnal. The setting sun may still be in the picture, but the dying\nlight and the emerging shadows that were on the far left and\nright are removed. Only a segment of the whole picture is\nrevealed. This analogy works for framing on television.\nImages are focused and cropped; they are chosen for empha-\nsis and in doing so filter the complete picture from the audi-\nence. Therefore, framing in television broadcasts has the\nadded dynamic of image distortion. Such aspects of framing\napply to newspapers as well, as print media use still pictures\nthat are cropped to fit, but television is most characterized by\nsuch framing effects due to the nature of the medium. These\ndynamics must be considered to understand the devices\nbehind media framing.\nConclusion\nThis article has examined frames and media framing as\nmechanisms of the social construction of reality. Marshal\nMcLuhan's famous aphorism, \"the medium is the message\"\nmay be a simplistic way of understanding the power of the\nmedia in shaping an audience's perception of reality, but\n\"media\" do present information that is framed, and therefore\nthe \"messages\" can be powerful and persuasive. In summing\nup this discussion of framing, it is important to reiterate some\nof the critical components of frame analysis and framing in\ngeneral.\nThe study of framing is concerned with how meanings are\ntransmitted across media. While frames are not always iden-\ntifiable, and the power of their impact is debatable, frames do\nmake certain elements of stories more salient, and therefore\ncan potentially influence audiences (the level of impact for\nsalient portrayals of reality is also questionable however).\nThe media do have powerful impacts on social and political\nissues; the salience of frames for these issues generally has\ninfluence on public opinion. Frames that focus on interper-\nsonal and personal agendas do not have the same impact;\nmedia frames of this ilk do not have as great of an effect on\npeople. Therefore, while frames and framing can influence\nthe public, they are not to be understood as mechanisms of\nunabated power.\nFrames are embedded in culture, inside people's minds,\nand within the agendas of the media. Frames are found in all\ntypes of media, from print to broadcast news, and they con-\nvey meaning through the interaction between the reader and\nthe text (these meanings are not in the text per se, but rather\nalready existent in the mind of the reader of the text). Frames\nare socially shared, and therefore must have resonance for\nboth those producing a message and those receiving it. They\nare (usually) persistent and perpetual. Implicit in understand-\ning how frames construct reality is that they leave out as\nmuch or more than what they include. In other words, they\nprovide only a segment of objective reality. All frames then\nare subjective interpretations, or emphases of reality.\nThis article has attempted to both review the literature on\nframing and couch the literature in a few common themes.\nExamples from the media, politics, and everyday life have\nbeen provided that showcase how the framing process oper-\nates at different levels of analysis and in different social\ndomains. The examples also reveal the power of frames in\ndefining communications and as rhetorical, persuasive\ndevices. While frames and framing are mostly addressed by\nacademics who study communications, it behooves everyone\nto understand the basic elements of framing. It is crucial now\nmore than ever for one to consider framing strategies used by\nthe media, as individuals in society more and more rely on\nmedia outlets for information. By understanding the way\nframes relate to the acquisition of knowledge, one can\nbecome a more informed citizen and consumer.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nNote\n1.
