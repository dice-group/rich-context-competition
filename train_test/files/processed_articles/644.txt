The goal of the study was to show that cross-sectional and longitudinal data yield dramatically different answers\nto a basic question: \"How did older persons fare in the recovery years of the 1980s?\"\nMethods. The United States Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the German Socio-Economic Panel are used cross-\nsectionally to capture changes in the economic well-being of older persons in the trough and peak years of the 1980s business\ncycle, and longitudinally to trace how the economic well-being of a given cohort of older persons changed over those years. Kernel\ndensity estimation is then used to show how the distribution of economic well-being of these populations changed over these years.\nResults. Cross-sectional comparisons confirm that persons aged 65 and over in the peak year were better off than persons aged\n65 and over in the trough year in both countries. Longitudinal comparisons, however, show that persons aged 65 and over in the\ntrough year who survived to the peak year received a substantially smaller share of the rewards of economic recovery than cross-\nsectional comparisons imply. Moreover, the entire income distribution of older persons in the United States shifted downwards.\nDiscussion. Compositional changes in the cross-sectional data, caused by the entry of high-income persons who are young\nin the peak year but old in the trough year, obscure the decline in the economic well-being of the cohort of older persons who\nsurvived the trough year, in cross-sectional comparisons of older populations in the United States in the 1980s.\nMOST analyses of how economic well-being and income\ndistribution changed in the United States and in other na-\nisons of cross-sectional data. (See Levy & Murnane, 1992, for a\nreview of the United States literature, and Gottschalk &\nSmeeding, 1997, for a review of such studies in an international\ncontext.)\nAlthough much can be learned from these studies, the nature\nof the data used limits the scope of the questions that can be an-\nswered. Cross-sectional data provide a useful way of compar-\ning groups in a given year--e.g., workers, older people, chil-\ndren--with similarly defined groups in another year. However,\nsuch comparisons may not accurately describe how a given age\ncohort has fared over the period. Cross-sectional comparisons\nbetween two years potentially mix compositional changes\nwithin the age groups with age and period effects. To follow the\nfortunes of a specific group of people over time, it is necessary\nto use longitudinal data. While these two alternative data\nsources may lead to the same conclusions, they need not do so.\nAs we will show, it is critical to recognize the difference in\nthese two perspectives of how economic fortunes change when\nconsidering the economic well-being of older persons. In both\nthe United States and Germany, policymakers are contemplat-\ning reforms in their social security retirement systems to reduce\nthefinancialpressure that their aging baby boom cohorts will\nbring to those systems over the next three decades. (For a sum-\nmary of such changes in Germany, see Heese, 1997. For a sum-\nmary of such changes in the United States, see Quinn &\nIn their deliberations it is inevitable that the economic well-\nbeing of older populations will be considered. Cross-sectional\ncomparisons of older persons between two years will mix po-\ntential changes from several different sources. Foremost among\nthese compositional changes within the older age population\nare changes in average age, race, and education, each of which\ncan influence average measured income. These compositional\neffects make it possible that cross-sectional and longitudinal\nmeasures of the economic well-being of elderly people will di-\nverge considerably between two years. Policymakers should be\naware of what is driving these changes as they draw inferences\nabout how proposed policy changes will impact on the older\npopulation.\nHere we show how the economic well-being of older per-\nsons in the United States and Germany changed over the\ngrowth period of the 1980s business cycle, contrasting cross-\nsectional views of these changes with longitudinal analyses,\nwhich follow the same individuals over the period. We chose a\nperiod of economic growth in both countries to compare the\neconomic well-being of older persons during a period of simi-\nlar macroeconomic conditions between the two countries and\nto provide a conservative measure of the absolute loss in eco-\nnomic well-being associated with aging. We assumed that while\nthe income of younger persons would rise as the economy\ngrows, other things equal, the income of older persons should\nalso grow. This growth should offset to some degree the loss of\nincome normally associated with the later part of the life cycle.\nIn both countries, longitudinal analyses yield much more\npessimistic outcomes than cross-sectional comparisons.\nHowever, in the United States older cohorts are found to have\nbecome absolutely worse off during this period of economic\ngrowth as well as relatively worse off compared to younger per-\nsons. We show that the decline in the income of older people in\nthe United States during the growth period of the 1980s is\nmasked by compositional changes in the older populations con-\ntained in the two cross-sections.\nMETHODS\nData\nThe data used in both the cross-sectional and longitudinal\nanalyses are from the United States Panel Study of Income\nDynamics (PSID) and the 1997 English Language Public Use\nFile of the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP). Our analy-\nsis will show how the fruits of economic growth were dis-\ntributed during the approximate trough-to-peak years of the\n1980s business cycle. Because business cycle troughs and peaks\nin the two countries occurred over slightly different years, we\nuse the years that mark the deepest part of the recession and the\nhighest point of the subsequent peak in each country rather than\ncomparing the same calendar years. We chose our trough and\npeak years based on macroeconomic indicators of real gross\ndomestic product, real personal income, and the unemployment\nrate. For the United States, the period of observation is 1983\nour cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses for U.S. elders.\nThe PSID contains information on approximately 19,500 indi-\nviduals over this period. In the cross-sectional analyses, the\nPSID that have nonzero sampling weights. Thus, there are indi-\nsample, and vice versa. The longitudinal sample comprises the\nthe PSID. In the longitudinal case, the 1990 sampling weights\nare used in all estimations.\nour cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses for Germans. The\nGSOEP contains information on approximately 14,000 individ-\nuals over this period. The cross-sectional analyses and longitu-\ndinal samples of the GSOEP used here are constructed simi-\nlarly to those of the PSID. As was the case with the PSID, all\nlongitudinal GSOEP data are weighted by the more recent 1991\nindividual sampling weights.\nBecause the PSID gives all new entrants into the sample an in-\ndividual weight of zero, we use an imputed individual weight\nequal to the household weight divided by the household size for\nall observations in our samples. This practice is consistent with\nour use of individual equivalent household income in that we as-\nsume that the benefits of all household sources of income are\nshared equally among all members. Furthermore, while the PSID\nand GSOEP household weights and the GSOEP individual\nweights are adjusted for entry and exit of household members,\nthe PSID individual weights are not. (See Hill, 1992, for a fuller\ndiscussion of the PSID weighting procedures, and see Rendtel,\n1993, for a fuller discussion of the GSOEP weighting procedure.)\nSince 1990 the GSOEP has included a representative sample of\nhouseholds living in the reunited eastern states of Germany.\nHowever, in these analyses we restrict our sample to individuals\nliving in the western states of Germany. For a more detailed discus-\nsion of these data, see Wagner, Burkhauser, and Behringer (1993).\nComparability and quality.--The quality of the PSID data\non income is quite high. Several studies have compared differ-\nent income components in the PSID with other data sets.\nGottschalk and Moffitt (1992) look at the labor earnings and\nhourly wage rate distribution in both the PSID and the Current\nPopulation Survey (CPS). They find considerable conformity in\nage, education, marital status, and levels of weeks worked.\nRegression analysis of the earnings and wage distribution over\nthe period shows similar directions of change in between-\neducation group levels as well as in within-group dispersion.\nFitzgerald, Gottschalk, and Moffitt (1994) look at attrition in\nthe PSID and find that the PSID sample was roughly consistent\nheads, wives, and female heads.\nIn Germany there has been no complete census since 1970.\nHowever, a microcensus (1% sample) is done yearly. Berntsen\nclasses of monthly net income using the 1985 microcensus with\nthe same classes using the 1985 GSOEP. With the exception of\nthe four highest income classes, where the GSOEP shares are\nhigher, both distributions are similar.\nPSID methods played a key role in the development of the\nGSOEP, so its method of following respondents is similar in\ndesign to the PSID. Both panels ask detailed questions on in-\ncome sources. A major difference, however, is that the year is\nthe time unit in the PSID, whereas the month is the time unit in\nthe GSOEP. Fortunately a yearly measure has been constructed\nfor the GSOEP, and that measure is available to researchers. It\nis that yearly public use data we employ here. For a more de-\ntailed discussion of comparability of these data sets and the\nconstruction of the yearly income values in the GSOEP, see\nMeasuring Economic Well-Being\nEconomists conceptualize well-being in terms of utility or\nlife satisfaction. But they measure well-being either in terms of\nconsumption or income. While consumption-based measures\nmore closely approximate the theoretical construct of well-\nbeing, survey data on individuals seldom include detailed mea-\nsures of consumption. Hence, the most commonly used alterna-\ntive measure of well-being, and the one we use in this study, is\nincome. As a measure of well-being, income will be correlated\nwith consumption, although the degree of correlation will be\nless among the small portion of the elderly population with sub-\nstantial liquid wealth. Slesnick (1993) and Mayer and Jencks\n(1993) show that poverty rates are generally lower if one uses\nconsumption-based rather than income-based measures of well-\nbeing. Their evidence suggests that the income-based measure\npresented below will be a lower bound measure of economic\nwell-being among older people. It is important to note that in\nthe following sections the points we will make about cross-sec-\ntional versus longitudinal measures of well-being using income\nare likely to hold for such comparisons, using consumption as\nthe measure of economic well-being.\nWhen measuring economic well-being it is necessary to make\nseveral explicit or implicit assumptions in order to make com-\nparisons across people, across time, and across countries. We\ndiscuss the major measurement issues in the following sections.\nThe sharing unit.--Although we measure individual eco-\nnomic well-being and position in the income distribution, most\npeople share resources with other coresident individuals and\nhave access to income that does not flow directly to them. For\nthis reason a broader sharing unit, such as a family or a house-\nhold, is used to collect information on income from which indi-\nvidual income is derived.\nThe CPS family definition, based on marriage or blood rela-\ntionship, is often used as the income-sharing unit in the United\nStates income distribution literature, but the CPS household\ndefinition, based on common residence, is closer to what is used\nin most cross-national studies. Atkinson, Rainwater, and\nSmeeding (1995) argue that using the blood or marital relation-\nship definition rather than the less restrictive common residence\ndefinition produces a bleaker picture of the income distribution\nbecause it categorizes a larger number of individuals as single-\nperson sharing units even when they reside and share the bene-\nfits of living with others. The PSID and GSOEP sharing-unit\ndefinitions fall somewhere between the strict CPS family and\nbroad CPS common residence definitions in that they include\nunmarried nonblood-related cohabitants in the \"family\" but ex-\nclude other unmarried nonblood-related residents. For conve-\nnience of discussion, we will use the word \"household\" to de-\nscribe the PSID and GSOEP sharing units in our analysis,\nalthough they are not exactly comparable to the CPS household\ndefinition. We also assume that household members equally\nshare household income during the period they are together.\nAdjustingfor inflation.--While measures of income distribu-\ntion are not affected by the cost-of-living index used, measures\nof economic well-being are. Boskin, Dulberger, Gordon,\nGrilliches, and Jorgenson (1996) offer the most systematic criti-\ncism of the Consumer Price Index-X (CPI-X) used in most mea-\nsures of economic well-being in the United States and propose\npercentage points below the CPI-X. While using alternative cost-\nof-living measures affects the magnitude of our results, (e.g., a\nlower CPI will increase the real gains in economic well-being\nover time), they do not alter our major points, because in most\ncases we are making relative comparisons that are not affected\nby absolute levels. Hence, we use the CPI-X for the United\nStates in this study to remain consistent with the literature. We\nuse the International Monetary Fund Consumer Price Index for\nGermany. All incomes are converted to 1991 monetary units.\nAccountingfor taxes.--Household income is defined as the\nsum of all income held by individuals residing in a single\ndwelling, and it is measured as post-tax, post-transfer money\nincome. In the U.S. literature, pre-tax, post-transfer family\nmoney income, including cash government transfers, is the\nmost common yardstick used to measure economic status.\nHowever, we are interested in making cross-national compari-\nsons, and because taxes play a much larger role in Germany\nthan in the United States, we measure household income net of\nincome taxes and Social Security contributions in both coun-\ntries. To calculate this measure, we first sum all sources of in-\ncome for all household members during a calendar year. To ob-\ntain a more comprehensive income measure, we add the cash\nvalue of food stamps in the United States and the imputed rental\nvalue of owner-occupied housing in each country. (See\nBurkhauser, Butrica et al. [1999] for a detailed discussion.)\nAdjustingfor household size.--Because the standard of liv-\ning afforded each household member by a given household in-\ncome amount will vary with the number of individuals sharing\nthat income, household income must be adjusted for household\nsize. This is done using a household equivalence scale. The of-\nficial United States equivalence scale was developed by\nOrshansky (1965) in her attempt to determine poverty lines for\ndifferent types of households in the United States. While the\nOrshansky equivalence scale continues to be used in all official\nU.S. government statistics regarding poverty, its use is not with-\nout controversy. Most recently a National Academy of Sciences\nreport (Citro & Michael, 1995) urged major changes in this\nscale. Germany has no official poverty lines or equivalence\nscales but the government does set a \"sociocultural minimum\nincome level\" for its citizens that contains an implicit equiva-\nlence scale. Burkhauser, Smeeding, and Merz (1996) show that\nnot only are the equivalence scales in the U.S. poverty line and\nthe German minimum income level concept far apart, but that\nthe difference is inconsistent with the consumption patterns of\nsimilar-sized families in the two countries.\nAll equivalence scales include assumptions about how much\nhousehold income must increase to maintain the same eco-\nnomic well-being of individual household members when a\nperson is added to the household. For example, if there are no\n\"returns to scale\" for larger families, then, for instance, a two-\nperson household would need twice as much income as a one-\nperson household for each member of the two-person house-\nhold to reach the same level of economic well-being as in the\none-person household. However, to the degree that two can live\non average more cheaply than one (e.g., heating a room for two\npersons is no more expensive than heating the same room for\none), then there are \"returns to scale,\" and individuals in the\ntwo-person household would require less than twice the house-\nhold income of a one-person household to reach the same level\nof economic well-being.\nResearchers interested in comparative cross-national re-\nsearch on economic well-being must choose which equivalence\nscale to employ. In the United States the Orshansky scale as-\nsumes relatively high returns to scale. The German scale con-\ntains much lower returns to scale. Using one scale for all na-\ntions in a cross-national study is the dominant choice in the\nliterature (e.g., Buhmann, Rainwater, Schmaus, & Smeeding,\nequivalence scales is often used in which the scales share a\ncommon functional form, and parametric variations change the\nscale rate for households of different size. The scale developed\nby Buhmann and colleagues (1988) is an example of this class\nof scale. The Buhmann scale has a single parameter, e, the elas-\nticity of the scale with respect to household size. The scale is\ncharacterized by the following equation:\nEl = D/Se\nIn this equation, equivalent income (economic well-being) of a\nsingle person in a household (El) equals total disposable house-\nhold income (total income minus taxes, denoted by D) divided\nby household size (S) raised to the power of the elasticity pa-\nrameter e. When e equals 1, there are no returns to scale, and a\nfamily of two requires twice as much disposable income as a\nfamily of one for each household member to reach the same\nlevel of equivalent income or economic well-being. Operation-\nally, each person in the household is assigned the per capita in-\ncome of his or her household. At the other extreme, where\ne equals 0, returns to scale are perfect. Each member of a house-\nhold of two, or for that matter of any number, can live exactly as\nwell as a person in a single-person household with no need for\nadditional income. Operationally, each person is assigned the in-\ndividual-equivalent income of his or her household.\nBurkhauser and associates (1996) show that the Orshansky\nscale has an e value of 0.56, while the German scale has an s\nvalue of 0.81. They find that whereas these different values will\nnot greatly affect the relative poverty rates or the income distri-\nbution of the entire U.S. or German population, the use of the\nGerman scale on U.S. data would substantially improve the rel-\native economic well-being of older Americans. Older persons\ntend to live in smaller households than younger persons; hence,\nthey will appear to be relatively better off compared to younger\npersons, the higher the value of s. This must be the case be-\ncause, as can be seen in Equation (1), the higher the value of e\nthe lower are the implied returns to scale in a household.\nBurkhauser and associates (1996) recommend the use of an e\nvalue of 0.5 in cross-national studies. This value is the domi-\nnant one used in the cross-national literature. It is the one we\nuse here.\nDefining the Older Population\nOld age is an arbitrary concept. Because we are interested in\nhow those who are dependent on social security and other old-\nage-related transfers fare economically, we divide our sample\nbetween those over and under age 65. We include children in\nthis second group. While children are also not likely to be in the\nlabor force, they usually live in households with adults who are\nyounger than age 65 and in the labor force.\nIn the cross-sectional analyses using either the PSID or the\nGSOEP, a person's population subgroup assignment is defined\nin each year by the person's age in that year. Thus, some indi-\nviduals are included in the younger group in the trough year\nand in the older group in the peak year. And, as we will show,\nthis phenomenon greatly affects our results. For the longitudi-\nnal analyses, a person's population subgroup assignment is de-\nfined by the person's age in the trough year.\nSummary Measures Versus Kernel Density Estimation\nTraditional summary measures like the mean, the median,\nor the 90/10 ratio--the household size-adjusted income of the\nperson at the 90th percentile of the distribution compared to\nthe household size-adjusted income of the person at the 10th\npercentile of the distribution--are well-established methods\nfor summarizing the level of economic well-being and inequal-\nity in an income distribution. (See Atkinson, 1983, for a dis-\ncussion of these inequality measures.) By design, however,\nthese measures summarize an entire distribution with one\nvalue. Because few distributions with known properties can be\ncompletely described by one or even two parameters, the use\nof these summary indices produces an incomplete view of the\nunderlying distribution of interest. For example, we will show\nthat income inequality as measured by the 90/10 ratio rose over\nthe trough-to-peak period both in the United States and\nGermany, but that changes in the means and medians over this\nperiod varied greatly in size and direction across age and data-\ntype categories. We will also show that these measures fail to\npoint out that the modality of the distributions for older per-\nsons in both countries also changed dramatically. Hence, sum-\nmary measures alone do not provide the clearest picture of\nhow distributions change.\nKernel density estimation is an elegant alternative to using\ntraditional summary statistics to measure income inequality and\nchanges in economic well-being. It provides a picture of the en-\ntire income distribution in terms of the income density function,\nfrom which we can observe the distribution's location, spread,\nand modality simultaneously. It can also capture absolute in-\ncreases in income levels via shifts in the density function to the\nright. Hence, it can show that increases in inequality arise from\na variety of changes in the shape of the density function. One\ntype, a \"squashing down\" in the middle combined with a\n\"stretching\" at each end, is typically discussed in the literature.\nBut this is only one possibility, as our results will show.\nChanges in modality are also revealed by changes in \"clump-\ning\" at different points along the income scale. For these rea-\nsons we use kernel density estimation here to evaluate how the\nincome distribution changed in the United States and Germany\nduring the expansion years of the 1980s for older individuals as\na complement to traditional measures.\nIn their simplest forms, kernel estimators are smoothed his-\ntograms. Data in a neighborhood around a point are used to\nestimate the distribution of a variable of interest (e.g., income)\nover a population. However, while histograms restrict obser-\nvations to any one neighborhood group, kernel estimators the-\noretically allow an observation to be included in an infinite\nnumber of neighborhood groups, which results in a smoothing\nof the distribution shape. In practice, an observation is in-\ncluded in a finite number of groups, where the number of\ngroups is equal to the sample size. The idea underlying kernel\ndensity estimation is a viewing window that slides over the\ndata; the estimate of the density depends on the number of ob-\nservations that fall within the window as it passes along the\nincome scale.\nIn all estimates, weighted adaptive bandwidth kernel esti-\nmators are used with the Epanechnikov kernel function. Kernel\nestimators are well established in the statistics and economet-\nrics literatures; an excellent reference on kernel estimators is\nSilverman (1986). For a more technical discussion of the kernel\ndensity method employed here in the context of measuring\neconomic well-being, see Burkhauser, Cutts, Daly and Jenkins\nRESULTS\nChanges in Economic Weil-Being in the United States\nand Germany\nIn Table 1 we use cross-sectional and longitudinal data from\nthe trough and peak years of the 1980s business cycle to com-\npare changes in economic well-being and income inequality for\nthe entire population and for our two age subgroups. It should\nbe noted that our purpose here is not to compare changes in ab-\nsolute economic well-being between the two countries. Rather,\nit is to show how measured changes in the economic well-being\nof individuals and, in particular, older persons are affected by\nthe type of data used to measure it.\nOur cross-sectional results for the U.S. population are similar\nto those of other researchers (e.g., Burkhauser & Poupore,\nrecession brought substantial increases in average economic\nwell-being. As can be seen in column 3 of Table 1, in the United\nStates, median household size-adjusted income rose by 9.01%\nGermany are also consistent with past research (e.g., Abraham\nThese increases in overall economic well-being, as measured\nby the 90/10 ratio, were accompanied by greater inequality in\nhousehold size-adjusted incomes. In both countries these mea-\nsures increased in the cross-section, with the U.S. ratio growing\nhad a much lower level of income inequality, as measured by\nthe 90/10 ratio, than the United States throughout the period.\nThe positive picture of increased economic well-being for\nthe total cross-sectional population extends to cross-sectional\nviews of the older and younger subsamples in the two coun-\ntries. In both the United States and Germany, household size-\nadjusted average (median and mean) income increased for older\npersons. In Germany the increases were approximately the\nsame as those for younger persons. However, in the United\nStates the percentage increases for older persons were much\nless than those for younger persons. While the United States\nshows smaller relative gains for older persons than younger\npersons over the period than Germany, this cross-sectional view\nstill implies that, on average, older persons benefited from eco-\nnomic growth.\nTo be included in the PSID and GSOEP longitudinal sam-\nples, a person had to be observed in both trough and peak years;\nhence, the number of observations in the longitudinal sample in\nthe trough year in both countries is smaller than in the cross-\nTable 1.

This reduction reflects attrition\nboth because of death and nonresponse. For instance, in the\nolder PSID population, of the 1,356 older persons observed in\nalized, and 291 were missing for unknown reasons.\nIf attrition is nonrandom, it may bias our results. If poorer in-\ndividuals are more likely to die or attrit, then the bias should\nlead to higher mean and median income values in the initial\nyear of the longitudinal sample. This is supported by our find-\nings using the PSID; the mean and median values in column 4\nare somewhat greater than those in column 1. The direction of\nthe bias in the GSOEP is not so obvious, as the mean values are\nsmaller for the longitudinal sample (column 10) than for the\ncross-sectional sample (column 7) in the initial year, but the\nmedian values are larger.\nThe fact that bias is present, however, does not necessarily\ndeter from our main premise for two reasons. First, even if the\ninitial year longitudinal income levels are biased upward, it\ndoes not imply that the income dynamics of attriters differ sig-\nnificantly from stayers. Secondly, the income dynamics of\npoorer persons, and poorer older persons in particular, are likely\nto be such that these individuals are at higher risk of a decline\nin economic well-being or small increases than the population\noverall. If this latter case applies to the attriters in our data, then\nour results will overstate the gains or understate the losses in\neconomic well-being of the total population. Such a case\nstrengthens our arguments. The degree of these biases, how-\never, cannot be determined from the data at hand.\nDespite these potential bias problems, the cross-sectional\nand longitudinal comparisons of the total population in the two\ncountries between trough and peak years, shown in the top three\nrows of Table 1, are similar. Among persons observed in these\nyears, income inequality and average economic well-being rose\nusing either cross-sectional or longitudinal data. The increase in\nhousehold size-adjusted mean income in the cross-sectional\ncomparison in the United States is 13.86% (column 3). The in-\ncrease in mean income in the longitudinal comparison is\nIt is in the age subgroup comparisons that important differ-\nences are found between the cross-sectional and longitudinal\nviews of household size-adjusted individual income. In the\ncross-sectional analyses, economic well-being among younger\nand older persons increased in both Germany and the United\nStates. However, the longitudinal comparisons tell quite a dif-\nferent story.\nWhile mean income in the United States of those aged 65\ndollar equivalents for both years) as measured with cross-\nsectional data, when we actually follow the fate of older per-\ntheir mean adjusted income dropped by 8.33%. In contrast, the\nmean income of younger persons in the United States increased\nby 16.35% in the cross-sectional comparison and a slightly\nlower 14.75% in the longitudinal comparison.\nIn Germany, our longitudinal measures for older persons\nwere also dramatically different from our cross-sectional ones.\nThe mean income of older persons increased by 10.14% in the\ncross-section but only by 2.85% longitudinally. The mean in-\ncome of younger persons increased by 10.64% in the cross-\nsection but 15.03% longitudinally. Hence, while the absolute\nlevel of economic well-being of older persons in Germany in\nyear comparisons in the United States, it nevertheless rose by a\nsubstantially smaller fraction than did the mean household size-\nadjusted income of younger persons. A comparison of median\nchanges in the two countries yields similar patterns.\nThese findings suggest that cross-sectional and longitudinal\ndata provide much different views of how the returns to growth\nwere distributed in the growth years of the 1980s. In Table 2 we\nlook more closely at what is behind the differences between our\ncross-sectional and longitudinal views of economic well-being.\nChanges in the Income Distribution: Cross-Sectional\nVersus Longitudinal Views\nTable 1 showed that the economic well-being of persons\nin 1989 not only could be, but was, much different from the\nsurvived until 1989. The reasons for these dramatically differ-\nIn columns 4, 5, and 6 of Table 2 we look at subgroups of\nour 1989 cross-section of older persons aged 65 and over, first\npresented in Table 1. As can be seen in the bottom four rows of\ncolumn 6, the mean, median, and sample size of the older total\ncross-sectional population in 1989 are identical to those in the\nsecond column of Table 1.

It is this\nolder stayer group that provides the answer to the question of\neconomic well-being fell.\nThe fall in the economic well-being of the 65.78% of the\nolder population in the 1989 cross-section who are older stayers\nis masked by the addition of the other subgroups, all of whom\nhave average income that is not only above the average income\nof older stayers in 1989 but is above the total older population\ntant in size is the population of new-old stayers (31.24%) who\nhave aged into the older cross-section population over the six\nyears. When all four subgroups are combined (column 6), their\nsectional older population reported in column 2 of Table 1.\nIt would be ideal if 1989 entrants to the PSID sample were\nrandomly drawn from the rest of the population. In such a case\nthey would have mean and median household incomes similar\nto stayers in their age group. As can be seen in Table 2, PSID\nentrants have somewhat higher household size-adjusted in-\ncomes than the stayers in their age group. However, the differ-\nences are relatively small as are the sizes of these populations.\nIt is the new-old stayers that are driving the differences between\nour cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons. It is primar-\nily because the new-old in 1989 are substantially better off than\nthe older cross-sectional population in 1983 that the entire older\ncross-sectional population in 1989 has a higher level of eco-\nnomic well-being than the older cross-sectional population in\nIn Germany, the average (mean or median) household size-\nadjusted income of the new-old also fell between 1984 and\ncome of the entire older population in 1984. However, unlike in\nthe United States, the older stayer subgroup in the older 1991\npopulation experienced an increase in their average income\nover the period, so both cross-sectional and longitudinal mea-\nsured changes are positive. The cross-sectional change is\ngreater due to the movement of new-old persons with higher\naverage income into the older cross-sectional population in\n1991. As in the PSID, entrants are a trivial component of the\nGSOEP older population.\nSome studies of economic well-being use the age of the\nhousehold head to assign individuals to older or younger house-\nholds. Because we follow individuals over time in Tables 1 and\n2, rather than households, we used an individual's age to assign\nhim or her to our older and younger age groups. However, our\nresults do not substantially change when we use the age of the\nhousehold head to assign an individual to our age groups. These\nresults are shown in Appendix Tables 1 and 2. The results also\ndo not change substantially when we exclude children and\nyouth younger than 25 years old. These results are shown in\nAppendix Table 3.\nKernel Density Estimation\nTable 1 provided summary measures of economic well-being\n(mean and median) and income distribution (90/10 ratio) of\nolder people and showed how they are affected by the use of\ncross-sectional and longitudinal data. Figures 1 and 2 provide a\nricher view of the income distributions using kernel density es-\ntimations. Figure 1 represents older persons in the United\nStates. The estimated distributions for older persons in\nGermany are shown in Figure 2. The top panels contain the\ncross-sectional estimates, and the bottom panels contain the\nlongitudinal estimates.\nThe 1989 cross-sectional distribution has a lower height and\na thicker right tail than the 1983 distribution. Most striking,\nhowever, is that the 1983 distribution is trimodal, with the\nlargest peak at just below $10,000, a second smaller peak at\nperiod stretched the distribution to theright,resulting in a distri-\nbution that not only has greater economic well-being but is\nnearly unimodal. The statistical literature has not settled on the\nappropriate tests for determining if the differences we describe\nhere are significant. Burkhauser, Cutts, and colleagues (1999)\nuse and review a set of statistical tests that could be used. We\ndid not perform those tests in this study.\nThe change in modality and the rightward landslide of the\ndistribution could not be determined from the summary mea-\nsures presented in Table 1. While Table 1 shows that economic\nwell-being in the cross-section improved at a cost of higher in-\nequality among older persons in the United States, the kernel\ndensity estimates in the top panel of Figure 1 present a richer\npicture of the nature of the changing distribution of income\nfrom one with three distinct income classes to one with a single\npeak and aricherand wider middle section.\nThe bottom panel of Figure 1 presents the estimated distribu-\ntion of income using longitudinal data. We see the trimodal dis-\ngrew taller, lost density mass in therighttail, and became nearly\nunimodal like the cross-sectional distribution but peaking at a\nlower level of income. Thus, the overall economic well-being\nlower in spite of overall economic growth and is concentrated\nat an income level just above the poverty line of $6,973 for a\nsingle-person household. Because we adjust income for house-\nhold size, the appropriate comparison for whether a person is in\npoverty is the single-person household poverty line. The equiva-\nlence scale used here approximates the United States poverty\nscale. Thus, the poverty line for a four-person household (with\nsize-unadjusted income) is twice (that is, multiplied by the\nFigure 2 shows the cross-sectional (top panel) and longitudi-\nCross-Sectional\nIndividual Equivalent Post-Tax Post-Transfer Household Income, 1991 Dollars\nCross-Sectional\nIndividual Equivalent Post-Tax Post-Transfer Household Income, 1991 DM\nLongitudinal\nIndividual Equivalent Post-Tax Post-Transfer Household Income, 1991 Dollars\nFigure 1.

In both views, overall economic well-\nbeing improved, with a lower peak and thicker right tail in\ndistributions in Germany were bimodal and nearly became uni-\nmodal through economic growth. However, the shift in distribu-\ntion in the longitudinal panel in Figure 2 is smaller than in the\ncross-sectional estimates, and the middle section became nar-\nrower, compressing leftward. Thus, the overall economic well-\nwas relatively, but not absolutely, worse off than was implied\nby the cross-sectional data; yet, the leftward compression of the\nmiddle of the distribution means that a significant portion of\nolder individuals saw decreases in their economic well-being.\nAs we saw in Table 2, the differences between the cross-\nsectional and longitudinal views of the economic well-being of\nolder persons shown in Figures 1 and 2 can be attributed to\ncompositional changes in the older population. The new-old\npersons in the peak year have higher average income than did\nolder persons in the trough year. These new-old persons moved\ninto the older population in the trough year cross-sectional analy-\nsis but are not included in the longitudinal analysis. This was\ntrue in both the United States and Germany.\nBut what explains the size of the differences in the cross-\nsectional and longitudinal results in the two countries? One\npossible explanation, which is consistent with our findings, is\nrelated to differences in the social security programs in the two\ncountries. Older persons in both countries primarily depend on\nemployer pensions and social security benefits for their current\nincome. In Germany the federal social security system is the\ndominant source of income for the older population. German\nsocial security benefit increases are intended to allow retirees to\nshare in economic growth and, hence, increases are based on\nwage increases as defined by changes in average gross social\nsecurity covered income. (See Bundesminister fur Arbeit und\non German social security benefits during the 1980s.) In con-\ntrast, the United States social security system is one part of a\n\"three-legged stool\" that also includes private employer pen-\nsions and private savings. In the United States, social security\nbenefit increases are only intended to offset inflation and,\nhence, increases are based on price changes using the\nConsumer Price Index. In addition, most private employer pen-\nsions in the United States do not have automatic adjustments to\noffset either wage or price increases. To the extent that covered\nwages rose faster than prices in the growth years of the 1980s,\nthe German system allowed the older population to obtain a\ngreater share of the returns to economic growth. This may ex-\nplain the ability of German older stayers to maintain their eco-\nnomic well-being while the economic well-being of United\nStates older stayers fell.\nDISCUSSION\nCross-sectional views of economic well-being and income\ndistribution have dominated the recent literature on the chang-\ning distribution of income in the United States and elsewhere.\nThe analyses in this study confirm that household size-adjusted\nincome of individuals increased over the economic expansion\nof the 1980s in both the United States and Germany, as did in-\ncome inequality. We also found that both the average older and\nyounger person gained during this period. However, conclu-\nsions about how the gains to economic growth were distributed\nacross the age distribution using cross-sectional data mask the\nfate of older cohorts over these growth years.\nEstimates of the relative returns to growth, that is, changes in\neconomic well-being, in both the United States and Germany\ndepend critically on whether one uses cross-sectional or longi-\ntudinal data. Although each type of data yields similar results\nfor the population as a whole, the two types of data yield sub-\nstantially different implications when older and younger co-\nhorts are followed separately. Older persons in the United States\nin 1983 not only received a smaller share of the fruits of eco-\nnomic growth than younger persons over the next 6 years but\nactually experienced substantial declines in their economic\nwell-being.\nAlthough the longitudinal picture in Germany also showed\nthat older persons received a smaller share of economic growth\nthan younger persons, their economic well-being increased, in\ncontrast to the United States. Our kernel density estimates com-\nplement the summary measures in showing how the choice of\ndata--cross-sectional versus longitudinal--affects the out-\ncomes of relative measures of economic well-being across the\nage distribution by highlighting changes in modality and the\nshifting of income from the center into the tails, or vice versa.\nIn creating pictures of the 1980s it is important to focus the\nlens appropriately. For instance, cross-sectional estimates of\neconomic well-being have been used to assert that across-the-\nboard cuts in social security benefits will not harm the eco-\nnomic well-being of older people as much as in previous\ndecades because the average income of older people has risen.\nSuch an assertion clearly misses the critical point that, while the\nincome of new cohorts of older persons rose on average during\nthe growth years of the 1980s, people who were already old in\nthe trough year of the business cycle in the United States on av-\nerage saw their income fall despite overall gains due to eco-\nnomic growth. While the differences in outcome were not quite\nso dramatic for Germany, the use of cross-sectional compari-\nsons also exaggerates the gains to older cohorts during the\ntrough-to-peak years of the 1980s business cycle in Germany.\n"
