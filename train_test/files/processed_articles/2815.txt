Introduction\nIn its more than five-thousand-year history, China has seen constant changes of its dynasties.\nDespite a few military coups and internal splits in the inner circles of the royal families, most\nPeasant uprisings, instead, ousted the incumbents and inaugurated their own revolutionary heroes\ninto office. This repeated practice of failed regimes overthrown by groups of disgruntled peasants, since\nthe early times of Chinese history, renders ruling legitimacy an essential ingredient for a lasting and\nthriving reign in China [2]. Apart from the regular administration of national affairs in the royal palace,\nthe emperors often set out to tour different localities for strategic purposes. For instance, the emperor\nQianlong of Qing Dynasty (1711\u00ad1799) was known for his diligent but extravagant inspection tours\nto localities to ensure social stability and popular satisfaction with his governance [3]. The Emperor\nWudi of Han (110 BC) toured the high places on the mountaintops to pay religious tributes to the\ngods, because an important part of his ruling legitimacy relied upon the popular belief in his heavenly\nmandated kingship [4].\nIn the contemporary China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) conducts inspection tours to\nboost and maintain public approval. Contemporary government inspections, of course, occur at\ngreater frequencies and with much more proximity to the grassroots than those by ancient emperors.\nThese inspections to localities are intended to police local officials and oversee local governance.\nOfficials in China at all levels are expected to tour areas under their jurisdiction to ensure smooth\nperformance of administrative affairs and proper resolution of local conflicts. Inspections to villages are\nan important mechanism for the Chinese government to gain legitimacy. However, whether inspections\nhave been effectively utilized for this designated purpose remains less clear. We know very little about\nhow the Chinese government employs inspections to boost its public approval. Are these attempts by\nhigher officials to reach down to localities ever effective in helping the regime stay in power?\nSufficient research has looked into how authoritarian regimes maintains control and prolongs\nits durability. Traditional literature seeks to outline factors that determine regime survival.\nThe overarching finding of this strand of scholarship is that political institutions, institutions of power\nsuccession and political coalition, account for longer regime longevity [5,6]. Authoritarian regimes\nresilient in adapting their structures and efficient in purging political oppositions tend to last longer\nthan those without these credentials. But few have focused upon how the daily governance conducted\nby different authoritarian leaders on the ground actually benefits or harms regime survival. A sustained\nlevel of regime legitimacy is not only a function of power plays among political rivals in the royal\npalaces, but also a result of pragmatic connection to and resonances among the people ruled.\nInquiring into the utility of inspections in gaining the regime ruling legitimacy is important for\na number of reasons. First, inspections tours are costly. Unless they are meeting the desired goals,\ninspections should be kept to a minimum. In ancient China, the emperors' lavishing tours required that\nroads stretch along straight lines, resting stations be constructed to sizes and scale comparable to the\ncapital's royal palace [3]. Though inspection tours in contemporary China is much more cost-effective\nwith faster transportation and advanced tele-communication facilities, officials still have to sacrifice\nvaluable time and energy to visit localities. Especially inspections by high-profile officials, such as the\npremier, take immense administrative resources and cause much disruption to local citizens' lives.\nSecond, to the extent that inspections do help the Chinese regime advance its political agenda,\nunderstanding the political efficacy of inspections provides us with a unique window to assess\nauthoritarian governance in China. While political institutions are an important variable in evaluating\nany given polity, how well the administration governs with these institutions is perhaps more\nimportant. Chinese history offers the most telling evidence. From the Tang (618\u00ad907) through the\nMing Dynasty (1368\u00ad1644), the political institutions, including the extensive bureaucracy, expanded\nwhile the dynasties have changed from one to another, indicating that how well a dynasty performs is\nrelated to how it has utilized political institutions for its favor. Historians attribute the failure of these\ndynasties mostly to incapable and irresponsive governance [2].\nIn this paper, I examine how visits by higher-level officials to villages reinforce the ruling\nlegitimacy of the Chinese regime. Specifically, this study delves into how inspections improve public\napproval of the village leadership. If inspections help increase popular opinion of the leadership among\nvillagers, they serve the CCP's best interest in enhancing its ruling legitimacy. I contend that inspection\ntours to Chinese villages significantly boost the public approval of village leaderships by promoting the\ngoverning efficacy of village leaders. This causal relationship holds, first, by improving village social\nwelfare and economic development, and second, by securing for village leaders essential political and\nfinancial support from higher authorities to better represent villagers' interests and mediate conflicts\namong villagers. Using data of 961 randomly selected villages across China, the empirical analysis\nshows that Chinese government inspections significantly boost villagers' approval regarding their\nvillage leaders. In the following, I first present the theoretical argument of how Chinese government\ninspections improve ruling legitimacy of the Chinese regime. Second, empirical analysis tests the\ntheory with multivariate regression models. The study then concludes with a discussion of findings\nfrom the analysis and discussion on the future directions of relevant research topics.\nGovernment inspections improve popular legitimacy of the village leadership, first and\nforemost, through enhancing its governing efficacy. In a comprehensive study of county level\ngovernments, the Chinese scholar, Liu Tianxu, argues that Chinese government inspections bring\nsalient improvement to village governance [7] (p. 117). Governance improves mainly through timely\nenforcement of relevant policies and resolving challenges in a timely manner. Inspections serve as one\nof the most important avenues of policy implementation for the Chinese government. While sometimes\nabused by politicians to collect illegitimate fees and obtain personal gains, most inspections do bring\nforth considerable improvement in local governance. My fieldwork also confirms the noticeable utility\nof inspections in village governance. Most government officials I interviewed agree that government\ninspections, while flawed in many ways, are useful for bolstering the unity of the village leadership and\nchecking behaviors of village leaders. News stories also abound about visits of the central government\nofficials, especially the president or the premier, have prompted immediate actions of local officials to\nbetter people's livelihood in those inspected areas. The higher the authorities that conduct inspections,\nthe more coverage by TV and online news networks the inspection attracts. In particular, the central\ngovernment officials and provincial governors do well in publicizing their political activities.\nThe improvement comes both before and after inspections. Before-inspection improvement\nis mainly a result of preemptive measures by local officials to ensure a good \"image\" in front of\ntheir superiors prior to inspections. Before inspections arrive, local officials are usually on the\nalert to present competent governance to their superiors in order to secure and promote their\npositions [7] (p. 117), [8] (p. 89). To put smiles on the inspecting superiors' faces, local officials,\noften notified \"hinted\" about the impending inspection, invest extensively on areas under their\njurisdiction where the \"big figures\" are most likely to arrive. For instance, in December 2012, knowing\nthat former Premier Wen Jiabao was about to visit their county but unaware of which specific village\nin that county, local officials in Huanxian County, northwest China, selectively furnished the residence\ninfrastructure of a couple households that, in their opinion, Wen was most likely to inspect. It turned\nout that Wen only went to only one of them. Liu Tianxu also reports similar alerted actions by local\nofficials: faking local development by particularly beautifying places where inspecting officials would\nInterviews in northwest China also reveal that inspections give incentives to local officials to\ninteract more with village leaders to familiarize themselves with village development when their\nsuperiors inspect. Curious about local development, inspecting officials tend to ask local villagers,\nas well as officials, whether certain projects are being built, if villagers are receiving granted benefits.\nLocal officials have to make sure they are well-informed of local situations and appear knowledgeable\nin front of their superiors. Furthermore, inspections encourage better interactions between village\nleaders and local officials, because local officials seek to build trusting relationships with village leaders\nand eliminate \"negative reports\" that could potentially arise to tarnish their superiors' impression of\nthem and worse, even endanger their entire political career. The most popular question these officials\nask is regarding the welfare of the people. They do express interest in local stability and conflicts\namong households as well.\nSome of these preemptive actions by local officials can lead to unlawful political detention of\ndisagreeing villagers. For example, to keep potential complaints in Gaozhaigou Village in northwest\nChina (even protests) from reaching the arriving provincial Director of Organization Department, Wu\nDegang, in 2016, local officials at Huanxian County had started mobilizing public security departments\nof the county government to isolate the dissenting peasants (diaomin) in Gaozhaigou Village before\nWu's final arrival.\nWith high levels of job security and lucrative benefits, official positions in the government are\nhighly sought. Local officials are unlikely to lay back when their superiors are inspecting localities\nunder their jurisdiction. While such announced inspections might expose higher authorities to false\ninformation regarding local development, they are still useful in terms of inciting more swift actions\nby local governments to get things done.\nWhat is more significant is that the local government actions motivated by impending inspections\ntend to last for a considerable period of time. For instance, the same village in Huanxian County that\nthe former Premier Wen visited in 2012, Gaozhaigou, has become the focal point for pilot projects that\nthe Chinese government intends to initiate. It was selected as one of the Pinpointed Poverty-relief (PP)\n(jingzhunfupin) villages. Hong Mingyong argues that the PP project and its underpinning doctrine\nwas first mentioned in Xi's inspection tour to Hunan province in November 2013 and then later\nmatured into a systematic anti-poverty methodology and ideology [9,10]. The goal of this project is\nto make pointed efforts to meet the local needs for development and for poverty relief. These efforts\ninclude concentrated financial and commercial assistance to impoverished areas to facilitate economic\ndevelopment. The first step in this project is to clearly identify poor households and then employ\nindividually tailored strategies to improve the well-being of each. As a pioneer in the execution of\nvillages. In addition, the province has budgeted almost 23 billion RMB (about 3.4 US dollars) financial\nsupport and stationed 11,524 government cadres in 3541 groups into villages to keep in direct sight\nthe process.\nThe PP project assigns a particular provincial department to minister the given village's\ndevelopment. The provincial department overseeing Gaozhaogou is the Organization Department\nof Gansu Province. The constant arrival of the departmental head, Wu Degang, at Gaozhaogou has\ninduced a sustained influx of government support grants since 2015. Similarly, the Lankao County,\nfor which the Party icon, Jiao Yulu, was the former party secretary (1962\u00ad1964), is also a pilot district\nfor the PP project. The Chinese state media, people.com.cn, has pledged multimedia support for\nLankao during this process by setting up a special column to track the progress of the PP project\nin that county [11]. Lankao county has been visited by every Chinese president since Deng, for its\nformer governor, Jiao Yulu, has set a laudable example for the CCP of reaching out to the grassroots\nby being among them. Such concentrated, high-profile support from a state media like renminwang is\nunprecedented. The site reports an invigorated dynamic of the flourishing economy in Lankao.\nGovernment inspections favor village governance by immediately impacting village leaders\nin more personal ways as well. Inspections empower village leaders to properly implement state\npolicies and offer them essential leverage to settle village disputes. That village leaders usually\naccompany higher officials during inspections conveys to villagers the authority's consent and support\nof this village leadership. In the Chinese hierarchy, inspections by higher authorities are usually\naccompanied by government leaders at lower ranks. For instance, President Xi Jinping's inspection\ntours to localities are almost invariably accompanied by provincial leaders of the locality's province,\nand municipal leaders of the locality's municipality. The same is true for inspections by every other\nlevel of government. Thus, this framing effect of inspections on village leaders as the legitimate and\nrecognized government representatives earns village leadership popular obedience. More practically,\nvillage leaders can appeal to inspection officials for bureaucratic and financial assistance to overcome\ngoverning difficulties in their villages. A bureaucratically and financially equipped village leadership\nthus enjoys much more efficient village governance.\nGovernment inspections can help provide legitimacy to village leadership in a structural context\nwhere village leaders possess little autonomy from local government, where they usually work\npassively under orders from the local government, and where they are deprived of resources and\npolitical clout. Government inspections significantly shift the power balance between village leadership\nand local governments. Inspections entail more autonomy for village leaders.\nFirst, in a country where officials in prestigious and powerful positions are usually less available to\nthe masses, inspections bring to villages the otherwise unreachable and unavailable officials from local\ngovernments so that villagers and village leaders can now appeal their grievances to higher authorities\nat more convenience. Inspections are an important channel for village leaders to articulate to higher\nauthorities the challenges they face in their positions, gaining sympathy both from higher authorities\nand from the villagers. Petitioning villagers' grievances to higher authorities, as a result, becomes more\neffective where inspections are more frequent, because inspections make high governments available\nto them. By contrast, without inspections, making villagers' voices heard by higher authorities\nbecomes a more painstaking process. Denied channels of expression, a trivial grievance can spiral\ninto uncontrollable extrajudicial actions, such as mass protests and even riots. The New York Times\nrecently reported that a Chinese villager, Jia Jinglong, killed his village leader, He Jianhua, after he\nappealed, unsuccessfully to local officials for two years the unwanted demolition of his three-story\nhouse, which led to his fianc\u00e9e leaving him just a couple days before their wedding. Local officials,\nhowever, were simply not available for him [12]. Many similar cases fuel protests of massive scales.\nGovernment inspection exposes and addresses social grievances in a timely fashion by making higher\nauthorities available to receive village leaders' input. Good-hearted village leaders usually find it hard\nto persuade the local government to address villagers' concerns. In front of inspecting superiors, local\nofficials are unlikely to remain indifferent to village leaders' appeals.\nSecond, inspections may significantly alter the power balance between village leaders and local\ngovernments. Inspections interrupt collusion practices between village leaders and local officials\nprevalent in rural China. Inspections push village leaders to conduct village affairs in a more\nprofessional fashion according to the guidelines issued by the Party. They are thus more effective\nin settling villagers' central concerns. In addition, inspections bring village leaders back on track of\ninstitutionalized politics by releasing them from deference by local officials to whom these village\nleaders have to subscribe unwillingly. Even when village leaders have the genuine desire to fulfill their\nleadership role and govern democratically with transparency, they are sometimes suppressed by the\nlocal officials to do so. Inspections offers village leaders the courage to work against the wishes of their\nimmediate superiors, particularly the township and county officials.\nThere is an established record of higher governments distorting central government policies in\norder to raise more taxes for local government expenses [13] (pp. 167, 186). For instance, a significant\nportion of social conflicts in China are caused by inappropriate land confiscation. The Beijing News\nreports that Sichuan Province alone in the first half of 2016 tried 108 local government officials who\nhave manipulated compensation policies to underpay affected households during the demolition\nof these houses and extort the remaining monies into personal pockets [14]. The arrival of higher\nofficials provides the immediate victims of these distortions--village leaders and villagers alike--with\nessential political cover to speak truth to (even against) local governments. Essentially, bringing\ntogether political actors of all levels, government inspections open a window of \"cross-examination\"\namong these actors, limiting the possibility of any level of authority concealing information, repressing\ntheir subordinates or harboring corruption. Thus, inspections free village leaders from potential\nmanipulations from higher authorities.\nMost Chinese villagers lend more trust to the central government than the local\ngovernment [15\u00ad18]. Perceiving the central government as a more authentic arbiter of social justice and\npragmatic politics, Chinese villagers believe that inspections conducted by these higher governments\neffectively constrain colluding practices between village leaders and local officials. During my field\nresearch, I frequently heard Chinese villagers questioning, \"Why don't they (higher authorities) just\ninspect them (village leaders and local officials)? The corrupted (local) officials would have been\nsent to prison if inspections happen.\" Chinese villagers generally have the impression that the higher\ngovernment is very effective, once it is resolved to accomplishing certain things. \"No one can go\nagainst the government at heightened times (of inspections)\", as one villager in a village outside\nWhile villagers do not necessarily have solid evidence of collusion between local officials and\ncorporate interests (such as companies), such consensus among villagers across China does tell us that\nhigher government inspections considerably weaken local corporatism [20,21] and return relevant\nparties to political roles they originally belong. China is primarily characterized by a close alliance\nbetween business entrepreneurs and the state. Involvement with the latter (either in party membership\nor other forms of engagement) significantly increases the chances for businesses success. This alliance\nis similarly prevalent in China's rural areas. Business leaders, as well as village leaders who strive\nto get rich, seek to build a reliable (or workable) network with the local government. Local leaders\nshould perform their duties in maintaining a judicial and transparent environment for all villages,\nwhile village leaders should only function as mediators between villagers and the higher government\nwithin the lawful, institutional boundaries. For instance, village leaders are not supposed to align with\nlocal officials against another but to play a role of liaison between local government and villagers.\nThird, in addition to being available for village leaders to inform on villagers' plight, government\ninspections empower village leaders to better govern villages. This is perhaps most pronounced in\ncompetently mediated interest conflicts among villagers. These conflicts may range from interpersonal\ndisputes to large-scale group violence. My interviews show that, to pick a village leader, local\ngovernments usually consider, among other important things such as personal qualities of fairness and\nobedience to local governments, whether the person is able to bring under control village disputes.\nWhile some charismatic village leaders may be able to mediate village conflicts effectively through\npersonal clout and persuasiveness, I argue that, all else equal, village leaders of more inspected villages\nare more capable in conflict mediation than their counterparts in less inspected villages because of\nthe political support these leaders garner from inspections. The most straightforward causality is that\ngovernment inspections, accompanied by village leaders, indirectly signals to villagers the higher\nauthorities' recognition of the village leadership, thus legitimizing the village leaders among the\nvillagers. Such power endowment dramatically increases the weight of village leaders' intervention in\nvillage conflicts. Parties to these conflicts are therefore more willing to come to resolutions proposed\nby these leaders.\nFurthermore, village leaders can more successfully reconcile village conflicts because of the\neconomic and political leverage afforded by these inspections. For example, financial assistance may\npour into the village collective revenue due to extensive media coverage of a certain high-profile\ngovernment inspection. The accumulated financial assets have facilitated development of collective\nenterprises in that village. Increased public goods bring out good words from villagers about the\nvillage leadership [22] (p. 859). In addition, placing a large sum of collective revenue in the hands of the\nvillage leaders makes them more important decision makers in village affairs. It is these village leaders\nwho will decide where the collective wealth will be invested and who will be the primary beneficiaries\nof these investments. Thus, villagers who are parties to a conflict are more likely to yield to the \"rulings\"\nof empowered village leaders, because posing oneself as a spoiler in village affairs invites problems in\nobtaining favor from village leaders in public goods distribution. One of these public goods provisions\nis nominating a limited number of \"poor households\" (dibaohu) to higher authorities. Using the\ndecision-making power over which households are to receive government poverty relief grants in a\nvillage as a leverage, village leaders can effectively bring conflicts under control. However, when such\npower has been deprived from village leaders by corrupted local officials, village leaders lose such\ngoverning efficacy. Government inspections streamline provision of such poverty relief funds and\nthese funds further empower village leaders. Even in an event where inspections bring no financial\nbenefit, village leaders can always enhance their mediation efficacy by exporting these conflict cases to\nhigher authorities, as inspections make them accessible.\nLastly, inspections turn village leaders into more effective mediators in village conflicts because\ninspections increase the chances that village leaders get rich first. During my interviews, most village\nleaders have expressed heartfelt remarks that village leaders who lead better lives than the village\naverage solicit more obedience from villagers. Their opinions on village affairs usually receive the\nmost positive response if they have managed their personal lives well. By contrast, village leaders who\ncan barely make a living have little influence over village politics. At the same time, my interviews\nalso show that, while inspections do not necessarily bring cash into village leaders' pockets, they do\noffer a significant information advantage to these leaders to build their business and run a more\nsuccessful career. The information advantage refers to the valuable counselling tips and market\nupdates that inspections bring. Local officials hold strongly the view that the government is in a much\nbetter position in assessing the outside markets and offering insights on the potentials for a village's\ndevelopment. One village leader told me that one of the benefits of being a village leader, despite their\nextremely low salary [23], is that they enjoy this type of information advantage to get ahead and make\nmore money.\nCritics might argue that the authoritarian, top-down inspections might backfire by suppressing\ndemocratic urges among villagers in China. On the surface, it seems reasonable that, as democratic\npractices are more conducive to social order and civilian consent [24\u00ad26], they call into question\nthe utility of government inspections in winning popular support for the Chinese regime. A closer\ninspection into the reality in China would reveal a rather different story. First, Chinese government\ninspections occur mostly for welfare purposes, at least nominally, intending to improve the livelihood\nof local villagers [27]. As a result, local villagers are unlikely to see visits by higher officials as intrusion\ninto their space of political freedom.\nSecond, even in villages where democratic elections have matured, these elections are mostly\nregarded as \"benevolence\" from the state [28]. In the season of elections, inspecting officials arrive in\nvillages not to obstruct the electoral processes, but to administer them according to the Organic Law\nof Villagers' Committees (OLVC) promulgated in 1987 [29]. Most of the rural elections were actually\ninitiated by the central government and imposed top-down [30,31]. Lastly, democratic appeals in rural\nChina differ quite significantly from those in liberal democracies in the West. Democratic activists\nin rural China are more keen to effective means of governance and just ways of distributing public\ngoods, than to expansion of individual political rights. Villagers cast their votes mostly based upon the\nutilitarian reasons of public service [32]. Thus, those in full embrace of democratic practices in China\ndo not necessarily see themselves at odds with either the inspecting officials or the Chinese regime\nin Beijing.\nHypothesis 1. Inspections increase public approval of village leaderships.\n3. Materials and Methods\n3.1. Qualitative Approach\nField research was conducted in a number of counties on mainland China from 2012 to 2016.\nIn particular, I visited Huanxian County mentioned in this research for five times during this period,\non average about once per year. Personal involvement in local affairs allows me to obtain first-hand\ninformation on how locals received high-profile government officials, such as the premier, in 2012.\nPart of the rationale of choosing this locality for my field research is that Huanxian County has become\nthe archetypical target for the grand national poverty-relief strategy in China, which, as a result, invited\na large number of government inspections.\nI visited the other four counties during my latest field trip in 2016. The address and names\nof these counties are not identified in this article for the sake of security. I employed the snowball\nsampling approach to reach my interviewees. I first started the field trip from Lanzhou University\nof Technology, Lanzhou, China, my undergraduate alma mater, and interviewed students with rural\nbackgrounds and experience of witnessing inspections. Following this first round of interviews with\n22 college students, I asked four of them to tour guide me to their hometowns for a more detailed field\nobservation. While at their hometowns, I also conducted interviews with one county level government\nofficial, three village leaders and a couple of villagers. As these interviews are conducted against\nhumans, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval was obtained from the University of North\nTexas, US, before the research was carried out.\nWhile the 22 college students may not be the ideal sample in the first place, it is justifiable that their\nopinions are valuable and thus offers a first step for conducting the current research. First, though they\nare college students who mainly focus their time on school, their daily interactions with their parents\nback in their rural hometowns over an extended period of time enable them to construct a holistic view\nof how government inspections take their effect on rural governance. Second, Chinese government\ninspections have exhibited a considerably stable pattern over the past decades [27] (p. 473). This allows\ncollege students, though who are nonprofessional scholars, to grasp a reliable understanding of the\nutility of government inspections in rural governance. The findings of these field trips are mostly\npresented in the above sections of the paper.\n3.2. Empirical Approach\nData for empirical analysis in this study is from the Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP)\n2002 [33]. This dataset collects information on village governance in 961 randomly selected villages\nacross China. Included in the dataset is the number of inspections paid to a given village as well as\nvariables on village leadership. Most importantly, the dataset records public approval rating of the\nvillage leadership by villagers in the year 2002.\nThe dependent variable for this study is Pub_app, public approval of village leadership. Although\nvillage leaders are composed of two independent persons--the Party Secretary (zhishu) and the\nVillage Head (cunzhang)--villagers rate their approval of their leaders as one unitary leadership.\nPub_app is thus operationalized as an accumulated score of public ratings of three dimensions of village\nleadership: village leaders' willingness to stand up for villagers' interests, village leaders developing\nthe local economy and village leaders mediating village conflicts.\nIn the first dimension, villagers express their opinion on village leaders' ability to properly and\nresolutely present villagers' causes to higher authorities in cases where there is a conflict of interest\nbetween the government and the villagers. Since village leaders serve as the liaison between the\ngovernment and villagers, villagers sometimes worry that their leaders do not faithfully represent their\ninterests to higher authorities. Instead, villagers are concerned that these leaders might collude with\nhigher officials to extract more fees and taxes and withhold villagers' government pensions. In each\nvillage of the 961 villages, representatives from the ten randomly selected households within each\nvillage were asked to rate between 0 and 5 how well \"the village cadre stands as a spokesman for the\nvillagers\" with 0 as the least and 5 as the most.\nThis is a salient concern as my fieldwork confirms that there is very limited autonomy for village\nleaders from township level officials (the next higher level Chinese government). Villagers display\na significant level of distrust toward village leaders in terms of the latter's willingness to stand up\nfor their interests, when these interests are at odds with those of the township government. Most of\nvillage leaders' decisions are highly controlled by local governments. All of the village leaders I have\ninterviewed indicate that their primary goal is not to represent the villagers' interest in bargaining with\nthe Party, but to govern the villagers on the Party's behalf.\nBy contrast, the second dimension refers to the capability of village leaders to foster robust\nvillage economies. Village development is an important parameter for both higher authorities and\nthe villagers to evaluate the village leadership. In each of the 961 villages, representatives from ten\nrandomly selected households within each village were asked to rate between 0 and 5 how well\n\"the village cadre makes efforts to help the villagers get rich\" with 0 as the lowest rating and 5 as\nthe highest.\nThe last dimension captures villagers' opinion on village leaders' efficiency in mediating\nconflicting interests among villagers. Being able to effectively settle villager disputes is a very\nimportant, if not the only one, role of village leaders. In each of the 961 villages, representatives\nfrom ten randomly selected households within each village were asked to rate between 0 and 5 how\nwell \"the village cadre mediates the different interests among villagers\" with 0 as the lowest rating\nand 5 as the highest.\nThe dependent variable is then generated by adding the rating scores of all three dimensions:\nPub_app = stand + economy + mediation\nwhere stand refers to the dimension of village leaders standing up for villagers' interests, economy is the\ndegree to which villagers think that their leaders develop the village economy, mediation measures how\nwell villagers rate their leaders in terms of the leaders' ability mediate village conflicts. The dataset\nrecords individual scores of each dimension. For the purpose of the current analysis, I aggregate them\ninto one value. The normal distribution of Pub_app is seen in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Distribution of outcome variable: public approval of village leadership.\nThe independent variable for all four models is Insp, average number of county-level or higher\ngovernment inspections per year (1998\u00ad2002). The distribution of Insp can be found in Table 1 with\ndescriptive statistics of all relevant variables in this analysis.\nTable 1. Descriptive statistics.\nThe first group of control variables in the model includes three variables measured at the village\nFigure 1. Distribution of outcome variable: public approval of village leadership.\nThe independent variable for all four models is Insp, average number of county-level or higher\ngovernment inspections per year (1998\u00ad2002). The distribution of Insp can be found in Table 1 with\ndescriptive statistics of all relevant variables in this analysis.\nTable 1. Descriptive statistics.\nThe first group of control variables in the model includes three variables measured at the\nvillage level: Income per capita, Democracy and Taxre. Income per capita accounts for the effect that\nvillage economic development has on village leaders' public approval. Village leaders in poorer\nvillages might strive harder to develop village economy and, as a result, their public approval ratings\nrises. Alternatively, rich villages possess more resources to better mediate village conflicts and bring\ncontentment to villagers, and villagers in richer villages may be more content than their counterparts\nin less developed villages are. Leaders in villages holding democratic elections arrive at their positions\nthrough contested elections. Electoral politics push village leaders in these elected positions to be more\ntransparent and responsive. Thus, I expect Democracy to have a positive effect on the outcome variable.\nI expect to see higher public approval for the elected village leadership than for a non-elected one.\nFinally, Taxre is also included to control for the potential alienation that the tax reform launched in\n2002 has caused between the Chinese government and village leaders. Juan Wang finds that structural\nfiscal reform has made the Chinese government lose village leaders to the villagers' side and these\nvillage leaders then become key organizers of protests [34]. The distribution of these control variables\ncan be found in Table 1.\nBesides village-level controls, I also include idiosyncratic characteristics of both the Party Secretary\nand the Village Head: Age, Education, Exp_mgmt, Exp_busi, Time in office, Salary. The same as its\ncounterparts at higher levels, the village government is also a dual Party-government system with\neach village government headed by a Party secretary and a village head. Village leaders' personal\nprofile matters for their diligence in office and thereafter their public approval. Younger village\nleaders may be more active in their service, simply because they are more energetic and ambitious.\nHowever, age may also be a bonus to village leaders in terms of governing efficacy, as older village\nleaders may wield more influence by seniority in village politics and their experience may make them\nmore effective in their job. Thus older village leaders might enjoy higher public approval. They can\nbe particularly more effective in standing up for villagers' interests, mediating village disputes, and\nmobilizing resources for economic development. Education may play a significant part in the leaders'\nability to better articulate complicated situations to their superiors and fellow villagers. Education also\nendows village leaders with needed temperaments to foster opportunities for commercial activities in\nvillages. Education helps village leaders find creative ways to develop the economy and to abide by\nlaw in policy implementation.\nVillage leaders' experience in management in a company (Exp_mgmt) or in running a small\nbusiness (Exp_busi) may increase the odds of an effective village leadership. Experience in management\npositions or businesses teaches village leaders to strategically deploy limited resources to achieve\nmaximum utility for village governance. Perhaps more importantly, such experience helps village\nleaders build connections that can later help him/her develop the village economy. Thus, I expect these\ntwo control variables to have a strong impact on the leaders' public approval. Likewise, village leaders'\ntime in office may also determine how effective they are managing village affairs. Lastly, village\nleaders' salary is another important factor in village leadership. Better paid village leaders are freed\nfrom concerns of taking second jobs to make a living. They can instead be more focused on village\naffairs. Public approval, as a result, may increase as village leaders devote more time and energy to\nvillage governance.\n4. Results\nThe unit of analysis of this chapter is the village leadership in each village. The number of\nobservations is 794. The village leadership refer to both the village Party secretary and village\ngovernor. Given the normal and continuous distribution of the outcome variable, I perform ordinary\nleast squares (OLS) regression. Results of this analysis (in Table 2) show that Chinese government\ninspections have a positive and statistically significant (p < 0.01) effect on the dependent variable,\nPub_app, across the four models. This implies that inspections significantly increase village leaders'\npublic approval. As inspections increase to a village, its leaders enjoy rising public approval among\nvillagers. Substantively, as the frequency of inspections increases from once a year to fifty times a year,\nthe largest value in the dataset, the public approval score of village leaders in this given village is\nTable 2.

Predicted value of public approval of village leadership.\nThe surprising finding is that, as inspections increase in a village, village leaders are more likely\nto stand up for the interest of the villagers in the case where villagers' interest conflict with that of\nthe Party. Intuitively, when the Party's interests are at stake, the inspecting officials should pressure\nthe village leaders to lean toward the Party, not the opposite. This finding, however, suggests that\ninspections, with its publicity and influence, release village leaders from local interest groups where\nvillage leaders might be enticed by local officials to engage in corruption, or willingly collude with the\ntownship officials to extract benefits due the villagers. Such release encourages village leaders to go\npublic and speak for the interests of the villagers. This lends evidence to the argument that village\nleaders obtain more autonomy upon arrival of higher officials. Granted opportunities to be speak\ncandidly to the higher officials about local grievances, village leaders can now take villagers' chief\nconcerns to the right personnel.\nIn addition, a few control variables have also achieved statistical significance in the models.\nIn particular, Income per capita has obtained statistical significance (p < 0.01) in the first model which\nonly includes controls for attributes of the village: its economic development, democratic elections\nand tax reform. It loses significance, however, when control variables of the characteristics of the\nParty Secretary are included. It, however, regained significance in the third (p < 0.5) and fourth model\n(p < 0.1). Economic development in the village appears to be important in weathering villagers' public\nopinion on the governing efficacy of the village leadership. As a village becomes richer, the village\nleadership tends to enjoy a better evaluation from fellow villagers. Substantively, holding all other\nvariables at their mean, as income per capita of a village increases from 1000 RMB (about $147) to\nThis makes sense when village leaders, with a considerable amount of resources at their disposal, can\nmake more decisive (and most popular) decisions to better the living conditions of the village. During\nmy fieldwork in China, some village leaders complained that there is little they can do to alleviate the\ndespair in their village and that the poverty has provided the village leadership with little leverage in\nvillage politics. Whether a village has held democratic elections does not have any effect on the village\nleadership's public approval, a sign of low efficacy of these elections.\nThe Wald test (Prob > F = 0.0039), giving the comparative weight that each explanatory variable\ncarries relative to others, shows that the core independent variable, Insp, outperforms all the other\nexplanatory variables combined. This indicates the disproportionate significance that this variable of\ninterest carries in the analysis.\nAge of the Party secretary and age of the village head have markedly different effects on the\noutcome variables remains the same in this model. While the age of the village leader has a positive,\nstatistically significant effect on all of the outcome variables, the age of the Party secretary achieves\nno statistical significance and is in the negative direction. The older a village head is, the higher the\napproval rating the village leadership as a whole receives, all else equal. The positive effect that village\nleaders' experience in business and management positions have on public approval of the village\nleadership is particularly evident in the case of the Party secretary. It, however, is significantly weaker\nin the case of the village head.\nThe above comparison between the control variables of characteristics of the Party secretary and\nthe village head thus reveals that, while business expertise of the Party secretary are much more\neffective in raising public approval of the leadership, seniority of the village head is more significant\nin shaping villagers' views of the leadership. In other words, villagers tend to judge the two village\nleaders differently in terms of their contribution to the village leadership. Professional credentials of\nthe party secretary, such as experience in businesses, are more appealing to villagers while seniority of\nthe village head appears to be more effective in gaining consent from villagers. This finding reflects\nthe discrepancies in villagers' perceptual evaluation of the village leadership. Villagers tend to view an\nolder village head plus an experienced party secretary as the most competent partnership in the village\nleadership. Thus, to select a village leadership that wins the most ruling legitimacy, the CCP should\nappoint a party secretary who is well-educated and experienced in management and businesses,\nwhile helping someone who is older and highly respected in the village get elected as village head.\nI am aware of the potential selection bias involved in this analysis. Selection bias refers to the\npossibility that the Chinese government selectively inspect villages that exhibit higher public approval.\nIf such bias exists, the causal relationship that this analysis identifies could be compromised or even\nturned to the opposite direction: instead of inspections causing improved public approval, it could be\nthat public approval determines where inspection occurs in the first place. I argue that this selection\nbias is unlikely because the data used in this analysis captures a significant time lag between inspections\nand public approval ratings. The independent variable, Insp, is the number of inspections conducted\nper year during the past three year (1998\u00ad2002), while public approval ratings were polled at the\ntime when the survey was conducted, at the end of 2002. Operation of inspections and collection of\napproval ratings did not happen contemporaneously. As such, this analysis lends convincing evidence\nto the causal relationship elaborated in the theory section.\nSecond, even without such time lag between the explanatory variable and the dependent variable,\nthere are few reasons to believe that such selection bias, if any, would challenge the current results.\nThe authoritarian governance under the CCP demands uniform allegiance from all administrative\nunits to support, at least nominally, the regime's rule. The CCP does not have to avoid \"negative\nvillages\" to only inspect those in favor of the party. My field research shows that there is a significant\nlevel of regime support across villages, especially taking into account the waiver of agricultural taxes\nsince 2004 [35] and the marked lift of livelihood among the general population. The most likely\ncalculation that the CCP makes in deciding whether to inspect villages supportive or unsupportive of\nthe regime is determined by how the Party strives to ensure its survival. It is unlikely to shun away\nfrom areas of trouble. The CCP would most likely prioritize inspections to problematic, not peaceful\nor supportive, villages to ensure social stability.\nIn order to parcel out the effects that government inspections have on each dimension of the\nvillage leadership (stand up for villagers' interest, economic development and mediation) and, at the\nsame time, take into account the individual-level characteristics of villagers (Gender, Age, Married,\nParty_Mem, Minority, Edu and Migrant), I perform a hierarchical model, Ordered Logit regression\nanalysis clustered at the village level. The unit of analysis is individual villager and the number of\nobservations is 7093. An Ordinal Logit model is more appropriate for this analysis, as opposed to\nthe OLS model in the previous examination, because the dependent variables are all ordinal, discrete\nvalues from 1 to 5. In conducting the analysis, I also cluster by village to account for the bias caused by\nvillage-level control variables (control of villagers, village leaders and villages) in the model.\nThe core independent variable, Insp, achieves strong statistical significance (p < 0.01) in the\nthree models with breakdown of Pub_app into its specific three dimensions and with controls of\nidiosyncratic characteristics of villagers (see Table 3). Insp continues to have a consistent positive\nand statistically significant effect on all the dependent variables, implying that, as the number of\ngovernment inspections to a village per year increases, villagers' rating of his village leader significantly\nimproves. Government inspections significantly improve villagers' opinion on their leaders' governing\nefficacy in all three aspects: petitioning their causes to higher governments, developing village economy\nand lastly effectively mediating village conflicts.\nThe substantive effects inspections have on public approval rating in its three subcategories\nappear in Figure 3. Inspections impact public approval of the village leadership in very similar ways:\nthey help boost the public approval score of village leadership in terms of standing up for peasants'\ninterests, developing the village economy and mediating village conflicts. However, the effect on\npublic approval of village leaders developing the economy is the strongest among the three (the slope\nis the steepest in the last chart in Figure 3). This makes intuitive sense because economic development\nin the village tends to be the most visible achievement, as peasants' annual income rises and better\ninfrastructure is being built. This, as a result, can be picked up by villagers more easily than the other\ntwo areas of village leadership. The effect that inspections have on the ratings of village leaders' ability\nin mediating village conflicts and standing up for villagers' interests are almost identical (the slopes\nare almost the same for both graphs).\nTable 3.

Predicted probability of village leadership receiving the least approval (Pr[Outcome\nVariable = -5]).\nSome of the control variables in this robustness check have significant impacts on the outcome\nvariables. Economic development continues to exert a positive, statistically significant impact on all\nthree dimensions, confirming my assumption that the economy does matter for the public image of\nthe village leadership and the CCP as a whole. Neither democratic elections nor tax reform plays a\nsignificant part in the outcome variable.\nBoth the Party secretary and the village head's time in office proves to be a critical factor in\nwinning public approval. The longer they have been in their positions, the higher approval ratings\nthey are likely to receive from fellow villagers, all else equal. This could be a function of the leaders'\nfamiliarity with village affairs: as they serve in office longer, they gain more experience in helping\npeasants obtain the proper government assistance and fostering relationships among villagers.\nEducation of the Party secretary positively contributes to public approval rating in the areas of\ndeveloping the economy and mediating village conflicts. Education of the village head, by contrast,\ndoes not have any effect on any of the outcome variables.\nLastly, evaluation of the village leadership does not vary significantly over individual\ncharacteristics of the villagers. How a given villager rates the village leadership is not dependent\nupon his gender, age, marital status, education or migrant status. This shows the lack of\nindividualism in Chinese political culture in general and rural political culture in particular. Peasants\nusually do not form individually unique political beliefs or conviction. Their perspectives on the\nFigure 3.

How a given villager rates the village leadership is not dependent upon\nhis gender, age, marital status, education or migrant status. This shows the lack of individualism in\nChinese political culture in general and rural political culture in particular. Peasants usually do not\nform individually unique political beliefs or conviction. Their perspectives on the village leadership\nare apt to reflect more a communal and general opinion than an individual one. However, a few\nindividual characteristics stand out as significant factors on public approval of the village leadership.\nThe most impressive control is party membership. A villager who is a CCP member views the village\nleadership much more positively than one who does not belong to the CCP. This is an expected result\ntaking into account the entrenched influence of the CCP in rural areas of China and the conformity of\npolitical views that the CCP demands unconditionally from its members.\nIn addition, minority villagers tend to view the village leadership as more willing to stand up for\ntheir interests and develop the village economy, but not necessarily to mediate village conflicts.\nAware of its multiethnic population and sensitive to the potential ethnic conflicts in its society,\nthe Chinese government has adopted favorable policies to minority groups. As a result, the village\nleaders may as well act accordingly to be especially accommodative to minority groups. While villagers\nwho have worked outside the village (Migrant) are indifferent toward the village leadership's capability\nto stand up for villagers' interests and its ability to mediate village conflicts, they tend to view the\nvillage leadership's performance in economic development more negatively than those who do not\nhave migrant work experience. Having seen the extraordinary economic development in urban cities,\nreturning villagers understandably disregard the minimal economic development that their village\nmight have gained.\n5. Discussion\nThis study discusses a unique feature of rural governance in China--government inspections.\nVia painstaking administrative assignments of official visits to localities, the regime in China manages\nto connect the extensive official hierarchy to the common masses. Chinese government inspections\nstand out among other authoritarian states in that they have provided the authorities with essential\npathways to build close and concrete relationships with the grassroots. As a result, these administrative\nendeavors ultimately pay off when the CCP is to reap public support from the very people whom it\nhas elevated out of poverty and protected from social instability.\nBoth fieldwork and empirical analysis lend strong evidence to the theoretical framework of this\nstudy. Chinese government inspections, despite their systematic flaws and occasional superficiality,\nplay an important role in Chinese politics. Diligently touring rural regions of China serves the CCP\nstrategic political interest, as these inspections constantly strengthen the Party's local foundation and\nrefresh the positive image that the Party has endeavored to construct from its inception. This study\nargues that Chinese government inspections effectively boost the ruling legitimacy of the Chinese\nregime. Public approval of village leadership significantly increases as inspections to this village\nincrease, while controlling for other important interfering variables. The institutionalized practice\nof government inspections in China thus serves as a critical means for sustainable governance in\nrural China.\nInspections boost the Chinese regime's ruling legitimacy chiefly by drawing local officials,\nwho may otherwise be far removed from the grassroots, into personal contacts with both villagers\nand village leaders. Making these officials available to hear appeals from the grassroots alleviate\nstrains between the Party and the people. Effective communication between them not only helps\nresolve the forthcoming disputes and confusions but also enhances the emotional affinity that the\nChinese peasants accords to the CCP's contribution to the current Chinese state. Moreover, this causal\nrelationship between inspections and improved ruling legitimacy of the CCP exists because inspections\nalter the power balance between village leaders and local officials, allowing the village leaders to speak\nboldly to (sometimes against) the inspecting higher officials. Village leaders can now, with less fear of\nrepression from local officials, take grassroots petitions more conveniently and successfully to the right\nauthorities. Inspections also empower village leaders with financial and political leverage to govern\nvillage affairs more judiciously and efficiently.\nThe distinctive cultural values in China provide a helpful context to understand this salient effect\nthat inspections have on the CCP's approval. China's cultural values are primarily characterized\nby obedience to a hierarchical order prescribed by an \"unequal distribution of power\", according\nto Shalom Schwartz's conception of values [36] (p. 156). This stands in sharp contrast to the more\nautonomous and self-expressive cultures most typically represented by the English-speaking world.\nIn addition, according to Ronald Inglehart's research, despite a fairly low freedom house rating from\nsitting itself close to South Korea, Spain, and France.\nThis indicates that, in the contemporary era, the Chinese bid their well-being of happiness more on\nimproved economic development and better living conditions than political freedom and democratic\npolitics. Villagers in China, who are more leaning toward honoring the authorities and feeling indebted\nto what the CCP accomplishes for the common masses [38], are more likely to give support to the\nChinese regime once in-person visits by high-ranking officials increase.\nOne of the weaknesses of this research is that the dependent variable is public approval for village\nleadership, not support for the Chinese regime as a whole. Due to limited data, the current study can\nonly inform us what effect government inspections have upon villagers' views of their village leaders.\nFuture research, therefore, can delve deeper into the relationship between villagers' support for village\nleadership and their support for the CCP. Despite the hypothetical correlation between these two\nvariables, it is interesting to show how immediate approval of the most grassroots government cadres\neventually leads to general support for the regime.\nFuture research can further tap into how the levels of inspecting officials matter in impacting\nruling legitimacy. The weight that an inspection by Xi Jinping carries is perhaps much higher than does\nan inspection conducted by a lower county-level official. More research is also needed in articulating\nthe generalizability of inspection practices in other similar regimes. How can other regimes, such as the\nPhilippines, also learn from Chinese government inspections to institute more regime accountability\nand responsiveness? Scholars can look at how contacts with legislators affect constituents' rating of\nthe regime. Lastly, scholars might conduct comparative analysis between authoritarian governance\ncharacterized with top-down government interventions and democratic governance where bottom-up\nelections are more prevalent.\nThe policy implications for the CCP are mainly that the Party should undertake inspection tours\nas many as possible to achieve maximum utility. Given the heavy cost of inspections, the Party has to\nincrease the number of inspections, but at the same time keep it below the threshold beyond which\ntheir cost outweighs the benefits. It remains another empirical question where this threshold lies.\nAnother important advice for the regime is to pay attention to the make-up of the village leadership.\nA party secretary who is educated and experienced in business plus a village head who is older and\nwell-respected would make the most promising village leadership. Coopting peasants into the party\nstill remains important as peasants who are party members view the village leadership more positively\nthan those who are not.\nFunding: This research received funding from the Department of Political Science, University of North Texas,\nin the form of Dissertation Research Fund.
