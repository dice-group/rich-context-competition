In the USA in\nthe disease [1]. The incidence of screen-\ndetected prostate cancer has increased\nsubstantially over the past two decades, while\nthere has been a more gradual decrease in the\nnumber of deaths from the disease. This\nincreased detection reflects not only an\nageing population, but also the use of more\nsensitive screening techniques such as serum\nPSA testing [2].\nScreening for prostate cancer using PSA is\nnow commonplace in the USA [3]. Consequent\nto its widespread use, PSA has increased the\ndetection rate of clinically localized prostate\ncancer by almost twice compared to the use of\n>50 years in the USA had undergone a PSA\ntest [3]. In general, a serum total PSA level\nof 4.0 ng/mL is used as a criterion for\nproceeding to prostate biopsy [5].\nObesity is now viewed as a major health\nconcern in the USA and has been linked to\nvarious chronic diseases, including cancer\n[6,7]. Many studies have examined the\nassociation between obesity and the\ndevelopment of prostate cancer. While some\nof these studies found a positive association\n[8\u00ad11], others reported little or no association\n[12]. In addition, studies have shown obesity\nto be related to a higher Gleason grade, more\nadvanced stage, and higher mortality rate\nAlthough obesity might or might not be a\ncausative factor in the development of\nprostate cancer, it could alter the incidence of\nprostate cancer through its effect on the\ndetection of the disease, i.e. through its\ninfluence on serum total PSA levels. Several\nprevious studies described an inverse\nrelationship between serum total PSA level\ninverse association could result in fewer\nscreen-detected cancers, causing a decrease\nin the observed incidence of prostate cancer\nin obese men.

The specific\ndetails of data collection and analysis are\nsummarized elsewhere [19]. Briefly, NHANES\nuses a complex probability sampling design in\nidentifying counties, clusters of households,\nand individuals or multiple individuals within\nhouseholds.Onceindividualsareselected,they\nundergo detailed interviews as well as a\nphysical and laboratory examinations. The\nsampling design and subsequent weighting of\ncollected data allow results to be extrapolated\nto the USA population. Although only 5000\nparticipants are examined each year, vital and\nhealth statistics for a significant proportion of\nAmericans are obtained, thereby influencing\nsubsequentpublichealthpolicy.Allprocedures\nperformed through NHANES are approved\nthrough the National Center for Health\nStatistics institutional review board, and\ninformed written consent obtained from each\nparticipant.\nMen aged 40 years were eligible to have a\nserum PSA test; excluded from serum PSA\ntesting were men who voluntarily refused,\nhad a history of prostate cancer, had active\ninfection or inflammation of the prostate, had\nundergone a DRE in the previous 7 days, or\nhad undergone a cystoscopy or prostate\nneedle biopsy within a month of testing.\nCollection and storage procedures for serum\nPSA samples in NHANES are documented\nBMI was determined by the standard method\n(kg/m2) and subjects classified as normal\nunder the assumption that men at these\nextremes of BMI are less likely to be\ncandidates for screening due to comorbid\nmedical conditions. In addition, due to the\nfewer subjects and therefore a potential loss\nof power, individuals with a BMI of\nas `obese' rather than subdivided into a BMI\nFor our analyses, only men aged 40\u00ad75 years\nwere included, as this age range represents\nthe generally accepted age range for\nprostate-cancer screening. Based on self-\nreported race, subjects were classified as\nwhite non-Hispanic, African-American,\nHispanic, or other. Individuals with a PSA level\nof 20.0 ng/mL were excluded, under the\nassumption they were likely to have prostate\ncancer detectable by a DRE.\nTo confirm the inverse relationship between\nPSA and BMI in the NHANES data,\nmultivariate linear regression analyses were\nused, modelling BMI as a continuous variable\nand controlling for race and age at the time\nof the examination. Serum total PSA values\nwere log-transformed before analyses to\napproximate a normal distribution. In\naddition, to examine the relationship between\nBMI and serum free PSA level (after log-\ntransformation) or PSA ratio, multivariate\nlinear regression analysis was used, applied to\nthe subset of men with a serum total PSA level\nPSA ratios were available for all men who had\na serum total PSA test in our study.\nTwo separate PSA thresholds, of 2.5 and\n4.0 ng/mL, were used to categorize PSA values\nas `normal' or `abnormal' for this analysis. To\ndescribe the association between obesity and\nthe likelihood of a serum total PSA level of\n2.5 or 4.0 ng/mL, logistic regression analyses\nwere used after dichotomizing men as having\na PSA level of 2.5 or 4.0 ng/mL, respectively.\nThe odds of having an `abnormal' PSA for each\nthreshold were then calculated, using men\nwith a normal BMI as the reference group.\nTo account for the survey sampling design,\nsampling weights and Taylor series\nlinearization were used to generate point\nestimates and SEs for both the linear and\nlogistic regression models, using Stata 10.1\n(Stata Corp., College Station, Texas).\nRESULTS\ninclusion criteria (excluded were 12 men for a\ncriteria).

Earlier screening is\nrecommended for African-American men and\nthose with a strong family history of prostate\nevidence supporting the use of PSA screening,\nsuch screening is widespread and the vast\nmajority of incident cases of prostate cancer\nare detected by PSA testing in the USA [3,4].\nObesity is highly prevalent in the USA;\ncurrently 127 million adults are overweight\nare increasing, as 4.7% of adults are now\nmorbidly obese, compared with 2.9% in\ndevelopment of several diseases, including\ncancer. At least two large studies have shown\nan inverse relationship between BMI and the\nrisk of prostate cancer [23,24], and at least\none study has shown an inverse relationship\nbetween BMI and the development of low-\ngrade (Gleason score <7) prostate cancer [25].\nSeveral other studies have reported a greater\nrisk of high-grade (Gleason score of 7)\nrecurrence after radical prostatectomy [9,26],\nand mortality from prostate cancer [6,14] in\nobese men.\nTo our knowledge, the present is the first\nstudy to quantify the potential effect of the\ninverse association between serum total PSA\nlevel and BMI on prostate cancer screening in\nthe general USA population. Using data\nrepresentative of the larger population of\nmen in the USA, our results show that the\ninverse relationship between PSA and BMI has\nthe potential to influence PSA screening\nresults. Using a threshold of 4.0 ng/mL, we\nfound that obese white non-Hispanic men\nhad a significantly decreased odds (46%) of\nhaving an abnormal PSA test than those with\na normal BMI. It was recently reported that a\nsignificant number of men with a PSA level of\n<4.0 ng/mL harbour prostate cancer [27].\nBecause of this, some experts have\nrecommended that a lower threshold be\nconsidered as abnormal, with 2.5 ng/mL being\na common suggestion [28]. When we\nconsidered this threshold, there was no longer\nan observable trend of decreasing PSA level\nwith increased BMI, nor were there significant\npoint estimates of risk of an `abnormal' PSA\namong BMI groups.\nOur study failed to show an inverse\nrelationship between serum total PSA level\nThe odds of having a\nserum PSA level of 4.0 or\n2.5 ng/mL based on BMI\nand race among screen\neligible men in the USA\nRace and BMI OR (95% CI) P\nPSA threshold 4.0 ng/mL\nWhite*\nAfrican-American*\nHispanic*\nPSA threshold 2.5 ng/mL\nWhite*\nAfrican-American*\nHispanic*\nC U L P a n d P O R T E R\n1 4 6 0 J O U R N A L C O M P I L A T I O N \u00a9 2 0 0 9 B J U I N T E R N A T I O N A L\nand BMI in African-American or Hispanic\nmen. In fact, although not statistically\nsignificant, point estimates of risk of an\n`abnormal' PSA level were higher in both\ngroups. Furthermore, there was no observable\ntrend of a PSA\u00adBMI association in either\nAfrican-American or Hispanic men. These\nobservations, although interesting, might be\ndue to a lack of power. Werny et al. [16], when\nexamining the association between PSA and\nseveral anthropometric variables using data\nBMI-PSA relationship in all men examined, as\nwell as white non-Hispanic men, after racial\nstratification. This is consistent with our\nfindings when using two additional years of\ninterest, the study by Werny et al. also\nreported an inverse BMI-PSA relationship in\nMexican-American men, which we did not\nobserve even including these additional data.\nHowever, other studies support that there is\nan inverse association regardless of race. In\nparticular, Price et al. [29], using a multiethnic\ncohort of 535 men, reported an inverse\nassociation between BMI and serum total PSA\nlevel. Although those authors did not stratify\nresults based on race, it is likely that the BMI-\nPSA relationship in African-American men\nmirrored that of the total population, as this\ngroup comprised 55% of the study cohort.\nAlthough most of the previous studies that\nreported an inverse BMI-PSA relationship\ncontrolled for race in their analyses, few\nassessed racial subgroups separately. This lack\nof stratification, especially in the face of\npossible effect-modification, could not only\nlead to overlooking a lack of an association in\ncertain racial groups if one should exist, but\nalso could result in `dampening' of the PSA-\nBMI relationship in white non-Hispanic men.\nBased on these inconsistencies, further study\nis needed to better define the relationship\nbetween PSA and BMI in racial subgroups.\nAlthough one distinct advantage of using\nNHANES is that over-sampling of minority\ngroups is used in data collection and analysis,\nthe statistical power to detect an association\nbetween PSA and obesity in racial minority\nsubgroups is limited. Nonetheless, the current\nstudy is based on reliable data from NHANES\nmany studies examining disease risk factors\nand health behaviours in the USA [30].\nNHANES, to our knowledge, is the only source\navailable to evaluate serum PSA level at the\nUSA population level, and is an ideal data\nsource for examining questions that have\npotential nationwide public health\nsignificance, as the results are directly\napplicable to the population of the USA.\nGiven the prevalence of obesity and the\nfrequency of PSA screening in the USA,\nour findings have potential public health\nimplications. If obese men with prostate\ncancer are more likely to have an initial\n`normal' PSA test, then their tumours are\nmore likely to be detected later in the disease\ncourse. This possibility is compatible with\nprevious studies that described worse tumour\nfeatures and oncological outcomes in obese\nmost prostate cancer is currently screen-\ndetected through the use of PSA tests, our\nfindings are also compatible with those of\nprevious studies that observed a lower overall\nincidence of prostate cancer in obese men. If\nPSA screening is to be applied with equal\neffect to men with differing BMI, perhaps PSA\nshould be corrected for BMI, similar to how\nPSA is interpreted differently based on patient\nage, or how it is corrected (by doubling the\nmeasured value) in men who chronically use\n5-reductase inhibitors for symptomatic\nAlthough our results suggest that the effects\nof BMI on PSA screening have the potential\nto lead to missed or delayed diagnosis\nof localized prostate cancer, for this\ninterpretation to be accurate there is an\nimportant implicit assumption; that\nvariations in serum PSA level related to BMI\nare not related to the risk of cancer. It is\nknown that there is no single PSA threshold\nthat accurately classifies prostate cancer risk\nfrom a screening standpoint. However, the\nprobability of finding cancer on prostate\nbiopsy is strongly related to serum PSA level\n[27]. For the relationship between BMI and\nPSA to be a cause of decreased incidence, the\nmechanism through which BMI influences\nserum PSA must be independent of the risk of\nprostate cancer. If this is not the case, then for\nany given value of PSA, obese men should\nhave the same risk of prostate cancer on\nbiopsy as men with a normal BMI. In other\nwords, obese men might have lower serum\nPSA level on average simply because the\naverage obese man has a lower risk of\nprostate cancer. It is not possible to address\nthis question with the current data, but at\nleast one recent study of patients with\nprostate cancer suggested that alterations\nin serum PSA due to BMI are related to\nphysiological changes in plasma volume\nassociated with obesity [15]. Such changes in\nplasma volume should have no association\nwith cancer risk.\nIn conclusion, the inverse association\nbetween serum PSA level and BMI is\npotentially relevant to the interpretation of\nPSA as a prostate cancer screening test in\nobese white non-Hispanic men. It might also\npartly explain previous observations of a\ndecreased overall prostate cancer incidence\nand a higher incidence of more locally\nadvanced disease in this subgroup of patients.\nAdditional prospective studies are needed to\nbetter define the BMI\u00adPSA association in\nracial minority subgroups.\nNone declared.\nREFERENCES\n1 American Cancer Society.
