    "abstract": "Abstract: The aim of this study was to identify characteristics that predispose older resi-\ndents of Adelaide to falling. Information collected in the baseline phase of the Australian\nLongitudinal Study of Ageingwas used to draw cross-sectionalcomparisons between par-\nticipants who reported having fallen on at least one occasion in the previous 12 months\nand those participants who reported not having fallen. The baseline cohort consisted of\nfallen at least once in the previous year. Independent risk factors for falling were: age;\nhaving left school at an early age; a worsening of vision in recent years; and histories of\nParkinson's disease, fractured hip, glaucoma, stroke (including transient ischaemic\nattack), corns or bunions, or arthritis. The findings regarding medical histories suggest\nsome possible opportunities for reducing the risk of falls in the elderly by managing the\nsymptoms and risk factors of underlying conditions such as stroke and loss of vision.\nLS are the leading cause of accidental death\nin Australians aged 65 years and older.' In this\nE\"\nage group, falls accounted for 42 per cent of all\ninjury-related deaths registered in Australia in 1993;\nnumbering 694, falls deaths were more than twice as\nfrequent as transport or suicide deaths. Similarly,\ndata from public hospitals in Victoria show that falls\nare the single most common cause of injury-related\nhospital admission for persons aged 65 years and\nfor 42 per cent of all injury-related admissions in\nVictoria (in the 65-and-over age group) and out-\nnumbered transport accident admissions by a factor\nof nearly lo.*Fractures, particularly of the hip, are\nthe main reason for hospital admission following a\nfall; many such fractures are associated with osteo-\nporo~is.~,'\nAdditionally, older people suffer numerous falls\nthat do not result in hospital admission or death.\nWhile accurate population-based numbers are not\navailable, many Australian and overseas researchers\nhave documented the frequency of falling among\ntheir study participants.\"I3The prevalence of having\nat least one fall in a year ranges from around 30 to\n60 per cent of study participants. In general, the\nreported prevalence tends to be higher in prospec-\ntive studies employing good means of fall ascertain-\nment and in studies of older and frailer participants.\nIt is evident, therefore, that a considerable propor-\ntion of the elderly population experiences falls.\nWhile most of the falls do not lead to serious injury\nor death, they are a cause for concern as likely mark-\ners of proneness to future falling, perhaps with\nworse outcomes, and as indicators of deteriorating\nCorrespondence to Dr James Harrison, AIHW National Injury\nSurveillance Unit, Flinders University of South Australia, Bedford\nhealth status. Other consequences of falls include\nthe effects of any minor injuries that are sustained\nand the accompanying loss of confidence and inca-\npacitating fear of fallingwhich often followsin older\nThe frequency of falling among older people and\nits serious sequelae have been recognised by health\nauthorities in Australia, and national goals and tar-\ngets have been set with the aim of reducing levels of\nfalls-related mortality and hospital admission.\"\nAchieving reductions in falls-related mortality and\nmorbidity can be tackled by various approaches,\nincluding intervening to prevent falls occurring in\nthe first place and providing better clinical manage-\nment in cases where a fall has occurred and resulted\nin injury. Successful intervention, with efficacious\ntargeting of at-risk persons, requires a better under-\nstanding of the causes of falls than is presently avail-\nable.\nThere exists a broad body of literature on risk fac-\ntors for falling (for an extensivebibliography see the\nliterature review by the Fall Prevention Research\nGroup in New Zealandla). Suggested risk factors\ninclude poor state of health, limited mobility and fit-\nness, hazards in the home environment, dizziness\nand disorders of balance, use of medications (espe-\nciallypsychotropic ones),and a history of falling.'a.lY\nHowever, there are many contradictory findings\namong studies over the predictive value of a wide\nrange of putative medical and environmental risk\nfactors. In part, this may be because studies of rela-\ntively frequent health problems in elderlypeople are\nprone to methodological difficulties, such as poor\nrecall of events, low participation rates, and incom-\nplete follow-up owing to illness or death.zoAnother\nreason for discrepant findings is the use of inade-\nquate study designs to identify risk factors: common\nproblems that have been recognised include not\nusing a comparison group, and incorrectly ascribing\ncausality to associations between variables whose\ntemporal relation is not established.z&zz\nWhile several Australian studies have examined\ncorrelates of falling in small samples of institution-\nalised older s ~ b j e c t s ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nonly two large-scale studies\nof community dwelling people have been under-\ntaken, notably the Randwick Falls and Fractures\nand the Dubbo Osteoporosis Epidemi-\nology Study.\" These two studies found that persons\nwho experienced multiple falls tended to be identi-\nfiable by their relatively poor performance in senso-\nrimotor and balance tests. Given the uncertain\nnature of the existing international literature and\nthe relatively small number of Australian studies of\ncommunity dwelling populations, a need exists for\nfurther epidemiological study of risk factors for\nfalling within an Australian community setting.\nThe Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing\nbeing conducted by the Centre for Ageing Studies at\nthe Flinders University of South Australia affords a\nsound opportunity to explore the correlates of\nfalling in a sizeable cohort of older Adelaide resi-\ndents, selected from both community and institu-\ntional residences.28 This paper examines factors\nassociated with falling by drawing cross-sectional\ncomparisons between fallers and nonfallers, using\nthe baseline characteristics and experiences of the\ncohort.\nMethod\nThis study of factors associatedwith falling is part of\nthe Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing, details\nof which are available elsewhere.2sBriefly, its aim is\nto gain a better understanding of the determinants\nof healthy aging and the role of social, environmen-\ntal and biomedical factors in age-related changes in\nthe health of older people. The baseline cohort\nresident in Adelaide, South Australia (living either\nin the community or in an institution), and selected\nby age-and sex-stratified random sampling from the\nelectoral roll. The level of participation at baseline\nrepresented a recruitment rate of 54 per cent.\nBaseline data collection started in September\ncompleted a comprehensive face-to-face interview\nand underwent a series of home-based clinical\nassessments. The survey collected information on a\nrange of sociodemographic, physiological and med-\nical items. Basic anthropometric measures included\nheight, weight, blood pressure, and assessment of\ngait. Data were collected by trained interviewersand\ncollated by the Centre for Ageing Studies.\nParticipants were asked to report on whether any\nfalls had been experienced in the previous 12\nmonths, and if so, to describe the circumstances that\nled to their occurrence. Using this information, we\nclassified the cohort into comparison groups of fall-\ners and nonfallers. The criterion for classification as\na faller was one or more self-reported fallsin the pre-\nvious 12 months; those who reported no falls were\nclassified as nonfallers.\nInformation on medical histories was obtained by\nasking participants to identify from a list of 39 spec-\nified conditions those that they had ever suffered\nfrom. For each identified condition, participants\nwere asked for the year of diagnosis and whether\nthey presently suffered from the condition. Ad-\nditionally, there was opportunity for participants to\nreport up to four other conditions not listed. Those\nconditions diagnosed within the 12 months prior to\nthe baseline interview (0.2 per cent of all reported\nmedical histories) were excluded from analyses\nbecause the onset of the condition might have been\nafter the occurrence of a reported fall.\nSimilarly, other potential risk factors were exam-\nined only if the exposure could not vary with time\n(for example, sex, country of birth) or occurred\nprior to the 12-month reporting period for falls.\nConsequently, a number of potentially important\nmeasures taken at the baseline stage of the study\n(including blood pressure, weight, gait analysis,abil-\nity to perform activities of daily living, medication\nusage, and psychological functioning) were not\nanalysed because their values might have reflected\nthe effects of a precedent fall and this would give\nrise to misleading associations.The role of such fac-\ntors will be examined prospectively in subsequent\nstages of the study.\nOdds ratios and their 95 per cent confidence\nintervals were used as measures of the strength and\nsignificance of associations between falling and pos-\nsible risk factors. Age-adjusted odds ratios were cal-\nculated from stratified analysis of unweighted data\nusing Epi Info oftw ware.'^ Multivariate unconditional\nlogistic regression analysis of unweighted data was\nundertaken in accordance with the hierarchical\nbackward elimination procedure recommended by\nKleinba~m;~~\nthe SPSS computer program was used\nfor this p~rpose.~'\nResults\nThe baseline cohort consisted of 1947 participants,\nwomen. The age distribution for the two sexes is\nshown in Table 1. Sixty-nine per cent of the cohort\nwas born in Australia and most cohort members\nlived in the community,with only 8 per cent living in\ninstitutional accommodation. Two-thirds of the par-\nticipants were known to be living with others at their\nusual place of residence.\nA total of 550 (28 per cent) participants reported\nhaving fallen on at least one occasion in the previous\n12 months (Table 1). Falls were more frequent\namong women than men, with 31 per cent of women\ncompared to 26 per cent of men reporting at least\none fall. In both sexes the proportion of fallers\nincreased as age increased.\nAge-adjusted analysis\nMedical histories associated with falling.Thirty-five\nmedical conditions were examined for possible asso-\nciation with falling. No adjustment was made to the\nsignificance criterion for multiple comparisons, in\naccordance with recent views on this matter.3z,33\nMedical histories associated with falling in age-\nadjusted analyses are presented in Table 2.

A history of ever having smoked\nregularly appeared to decrease the risk of falling.\nSocioeconomicfactors and falling: The age of leav-\ning school was the only socioeconomic variable asso-\nciated with falling (Table 4).

When considering the results of\nthis study,it is important to recognise the limitations\nof the methods that were used. The main concerns\nare: self-report of information on exposure and out-\ncome variables; modest response rate; relevance of\nantecedent exposures; and aggregation of different\ntypes of falls into a single outcome measure.\nThe exposure measures reported on in this paper\nwere all obtained by self-report, and this may have\nresulted in some misclassification bias. To reduce\nmisclassification bias from underreporting of poten-\ntially sensitive topics such as income and medical\nhistories, prompt cards were used during the per-\nsonal interview. Past exposures may also have been\nunderreported simply because they were not\nrecalled by the elderly participants; this would have\nproduced nondifferential misclassification bias and\ndiminution of effects unless the pattern of recall was\nassociated with falling, in which case spurious asso-\nciations might have been produced.\nThe potential for misclassificationof exposure was\nperhaps greatest for medical histories. In addition to\npossible problems with recall such as those already\ndiscussed,elderly people might not have been famil-\niar with medical nomenclature or with their actual\ndiagnoses, particularly if they involved complex pat-\nterns of disease or comorbidities. A further possibil-\nity is that some medical conditions might have been\noverreported by those who thought the condition to\nbe a cause for their falling.While this possibilitycan-\nnot be ruled out, it is expected to have had at most\na small effect, since the questionnaire asked for\nmedical histories before it asked about falls experi-\nence, and participants did not know in advance that\nthey would be asked questions about falls. Although\nself-reports have clear limitations, they potentially\ncould be used within a community or primary care\nsetting as a relativelyefficient first means of identify-\ning persons at increased risk of falling, with subse-\nquent clinical follow-up to confirm medical\ndiagnoses.\nClassificationof participants into groups of fallers\nand nonfallers was based on self-reported falls expe-\nrience, and is therefore subject to recall bias. Studies\nhave shown that while the number of reported falls\nover a 12-month period is not particularly accurate,\nrecall of having experienced any falls versus zero\nfalls is reasonably reliable.z0,34\nMisclassification\noccurs predominantly in the direction of forgetting\nfalls as opposed to reporting falls that did not occur.\nThe usual effect of this type of misclassification is to\nbias measures of effect towards the null value. In the\ncurrent study, the important outcome was whether a\nfall had occurred rather than the exact number of\nfalls over the 12 months, and hence it is considered\nunlikely that there was a significant misclassification\nof outcome.\nThe recruitment rate at baseline (54per cent) was\nsimilar to that achieved in the Randwick Falls and\nFractures Studyz6and in the Dubbo Osteoporosis\nEpidemiology Studyz'but lower than in other stud-\nies of risk factors for falls among the elderly. In part,\nthe lower rate of participation may have been\nbecause of the relatively high level of ongoing\ninvolvementrequired of participants over the course\nof the main study. In view of the participation rate,\nfindings from this study may not be generalisable to\nall older Australians.\nA difficultyfaced by all researchers who make use\nof cross-sectional data or current data on exposures\ncombined with historical data on falling is to estab-\nlish whether the temporal relationship between\nthese measures is consistent with a causal path. In\nthis paper, examination of risk factors was restricted\nto stable exposures such as the age of leaving school\nand the country of birth, and exposures that were\nknown to be antecedent to the falls experience\nabout which the participants were questioned (for\nexample, disease history, marital status). Even so,\nfurther research will be needed to elucidate the\nmechanisms by which such past exposures might\noperate to bring about an increased risk of falling.\nDifferent types of falls (for example, those result-\ning from slips, trips, sudden loss of consciousness)\nwere not distinguished in the analyses,as the level of\ndetail provided by participants was judged to be\ninsufficient to make useful distinctions. It is quite\nprobable that different types of falls have different\nsets of risk factors, and the lack of risk specificitypro-\nduced by grouping all falls together is likely to have\ndiminished some associations or possibly even\nmasked them alt~gether.*~,~~\nA number of classifica-\ntions for falls have been proposed and with further\nevaluation may prove useful in revealingaetiological\nrisk factors hitherto obscured.l2\nThe results of this study indicated that histories of\nParkinson'sdisease, fractured hip, glaucoma, stroke\n(including transient ischaemic attack), corns or\nbunions and arthritis are independent risk factors\nfor falling. A history of anaemia was associated with\nan increased risk of falling in the age-adjustedanaly-\nsis but was displaced as a predictor when other fac-\ntors were controlled for in the multivariate analysis.\nIn age-adjustedanalysis, there was a trend for risk of\nfalling to increase with the number of conditions\nthat had ever been suffered but this was not an inde-\npendent predictor. Other work has suggested that\nthe number of conditions and disabilities a person\nreports may be a marker of poor health generally\nand that such a state is associated with an increased\nrisk of falling.I5\nOur finding that Parkinson'sdisease increased the\nrisk of falling in older people accords with the find-\ning of Nevitt et al.7The risk may be related to the\nfamiliar symptoms of Parkinsonism, which include\ntremor, muscular rigidity and difficultyin walking. A\nhistory of hip fracture approximately doubled the\nodds of falling. Given that past falling is a predictor\nof future falling,'*and that falling is the usual mech-\nanism underlying hip fractures, this association was\nnot unexpected. Arthritis has previously been iden-\ntified as a possible risk factor for falling7A causal\nrelationship is plausible, in view of the degradation\nof lower limb function caused by the deterioration\nof joints in the lower limbs. Likewise, corns and\nbunions may increase the risk of falling by interfer-\ning with normal gait. An appropriate mix of drug,\nphysical and occupational therapies is important to\nmaintain normal functioning in persons affected by\nthese conditions.\nProblems with vision are known to increase the\nchances of falling.7~z6\nThe results of this study con-\nfirm the importance of vision problems in relation\nto falling. A history of glaucoma and self-identified\nworsening of vision in the last five years were identi-\nfied as predictors of falling in the multivariate analy-\nsis. Early detection and treatment of glaucoma\nbefore it causes loss of vision should be promoted as\nan important public health issue particularly as the\nbenefits are likely to extend beyond healthy vision to\nother areas such as reduced injury from falls.\nThe independent association of stroke with the\noccurrence of falls is consistent with the findings of\nseveral other The symptoms of this\nparalysing disorder include vertigo, difficulty in\nwalking, and visual disturbances, all of which could\nresult in a fall. The risk factors for stroke are essen-\ntially the same as those for other cardiovasculardis-\neases, and include hypertension, high cholesterol,\nsmoking and obesity. All of these risk factors have\nreceived and are continuing to receive much atten-\nE\ntion in health promotion and disease prevention\nefforts. Success in reducing these risk factors may\nwell lead to reductions in injuries from stroke-\nrelated falls.\nAge was an independent predictor of falling in\nthis study and has been found to be so in a number\nof other Also in agreement with other\nwork was the finding that sex was not independently\nassociated with falling.'0,'' Smoking appeared to be\nassociated with a decreased likelihood of falling in\nthe age-adjusted analysis,but this associationwas not\npresent when other factors were controlled for in\nthe multivariate analysis. In view of the established\nassociation between smoking and cardiovasculardis-\neases including stroke, it would appear unlikely that\na history of smoking would confer any protection\nagainst falling.\nEarly age at leaving school was the only socioeco-\nnomic variable that was an independent risk factor\nfor falling. Total income was not significantly associ-\nated with falling although there was an inverse rela-\ntionship between it and risk of falling in the\nage-adjusted analysis. It may be that educational\nattainment (as measured by age at leaving school) is\na more sensitive indicator of lifetime economic dis-\nadvantage than the current total income of elderly\npersons.36 Given that socioeconomic factors are\nimportant determinants of the distribution of many\ndiseases, the results of this study tentatively suggest\nthat economic factors might play a role in the occur-\nrence of falling. There were no apparent associa-\ntions between marital status, country of birth or\nEnglish language ability and the occurrence of falls.\nThe final logistic regression model included a sta-\ntistically significant interaction term suggesting that\nsex might be an effect modifier in the relationship\nbetween asthma and falling. Men reporting a history\nof asthma had a statistically nonsignificant higher\nwomen reporting a history of asthma had a statisti-\n1.08).Although different falls risk factors for men\nand women have previouslybeen doc~rnented,'~\nour\nresult must be treated with caution because of the\nnonsignificance of the sex-specific odds ratios.\nFew epidemiological studies in Australia have\naddressed the causes of falls among older people liv-\ning in the community. This study provides informa-\ntion about risk factors for falling which should be of\nuse to researchers and to those who are designing\nand running trials of falls prevention programs in\nAustralia. The results of this study appear plausible,\nare generally consistent with previous knowledge,\nand add to the evidence regarding risk factors for\nfalls among community dwelling older people. A\nnumber of disease conditions were identified as\nlikely risk factors, and in the case of stroke and con-\nditions that affectvision, a public health approach to\ntheir prevention may also lead to fewer falls among\nthe elderly. Our cross-sectional baseline findings\nneed further confirmation and the longitudinal\nphases of the Australian Longitudinal Study of\nAgeing will provide an opportunity to extend this\nwork.\nAcknowledgments\nWe gratefully acknowledge the work of the staff at\nthe Centre for Ageing Studies, the Flinders\nUniversity of South Australia, who carried out the\nAustralian Longitudinal Study of Ageing and pro-\nvided the data for this paper.
