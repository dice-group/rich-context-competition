    "abstract": "Abstract\nExtreme cases in demography are important challenges for researchers, and the still\nimportant heterogeneity of European societies is a blessing for scholars interested in\nstudying the importance of cultural and institutional factors. In the transition to\nadulthood the \"latest-late\" pattern of Southern Europe cohabits with its opposite\n\"earliest-early\" pattern of the Nordic countries. In this paper, I discuss multifaceted\napproaches to the explanation of why becoming an \"adult\" in Europe appears so\ndiverse. I use secondary data analyses and present cross-country correlations: welfare\nstate and institutional arrangements, historical and deeply rooted cultural differences, as\nwell as economic and policy factors, and ideational change. Moreover, micro-level\ndeterminants play different roles in different societies. Future research on the transition\nto adulthood in Europe needs to be multilevel, comparative and interdisciplinary, and to\nconsider the potential implication of persistent differences in patterns.\n1 Istituto di Metodi Quantitativi, Universit\u00e0 Bocconi, Milano, Italy; and Innocenzo Gasparini\nInstitute for Economic Research, Milano, Italy.

The importance of (micro- and) macro-level extremes: oldest-old\nand lowest-low. What about latest-late?\nDemographic research has always been profoundly influenced by population trends.\nThese trends have affected both the object of the discipline (\"What do demographers\nstudy?\") and the methods and techniques used (\"How do demographers study the issues\nthey are interested in?\"). Let us for instance look at recent decades. Research on\nlongevity has been substantially influenced by the emergence of the oldest-olds. More\nrecently, research on fertility has been influenced by the fact that some countries have\nreached what have been defined as lowest-low fertility levels. Changes in fertility and\nsurvival have been important seeds in the development of research directions at the new\nMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research (Wachter, 2003). Some researchers\nhave even pointed out that the emergence of long lives, low fertility, and high\nimmigration has contributed to the creation of a \"new demography\" (Vaupel, 2000; see\nThe extreme cases of demography are sometimes located at the macro, societal\nlevel (nations, regions), and sometimes at the individual or household level. Let us\nthink, for instance, about oldest-old longevity (with extreme cases at the individual,\nmicro-level, i.e. centenarians and super-centenarians), and lowest-low fertility (with\nextreme cases at the societal, macro-level, i.e. Italy, Spain and Central and Eastern\nEuropean countries). Our main argument will be that attention on extreme cases can be\nrewardingly broadened to point at another type of macro-level: latest-late transition to\nadulthood and to contrast it with the opposite situation. \"Latest-late\" has been used by\nBillari et al. (2002) to describe the peculiar pattern of late home-leaving, union\nformation, and transition to parenthood of Italy and Spain. This pattern can only be\npartially compared with the general postponement in the transition to parenthood,\ntypical of the \"Second Demographic Transition\" accompanying Western Europe over\nthe last decades of the Twentieth century, as illustrated by Lesthaeghe and van de Kaa\n(Lesthaeghe and van de Kaa, 1986; van de Kaa, 1987). The postponement of first births\nhas indeed taken place in all Western European countries and in most Central and\nEastern European countries, although at different paces (Lesthaeghe, 2001). This\ngeneral trend has also led to the idea that a distinct \"postponement transition\" is guiding\nrecent transitions to parenthood (Kohler et al., 2002). However, the trend in\npostponement is not necessarily similar for all countries and for all events shaping the\ntransition to adulthood, i.e. leaving home and union formation (Billari, 2004).\nWe can foresee that the \"new demography\" of Europe and of developed countries\nwill take advantage of research carried out on oldest-old longevity, lowest-low fertility,\nand latest-late transition to adulthood. Extreme cases will thus shape the content of\ndemographic research, by providing puzzles, in addition to the new developments in\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 3: Article 2\n-- Contemporary Research on European Fertility: Perspectives and Developments --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 17\nmethodology. In this paper, we shall focus - adopting a demographic point of view - on\nhousehold and family events taking place during what have been defined as the young\nadult years (i.e. more or less from age 18 to 34), years that are \"demographically dense\"\n(Rindfuss, 1991). This stage of the life course has been an important challenge for\ndemographers in previous years, and has occupied an increasingly wide space in the\nagenda of scholars (Liefbroer, 1999). Our title \"Becoming an Adult in Europe\" is\ninspired by a similar title (and paper) by Hobcraft and Kiernan (1995), who discuss the\nstandard \"endpoint\" of the transition to adulthood: \"Becoming a Parent in Europe\". We\nhave also borrowed the idea from Hobcraft and Kiernan to base the general reflection\non life-course transitions on empirical trends and innovative works from the literature\npointing to multifaceted explanations, and the focus on Europe. As a matter of fact,\nEurope provides an extremely interesting setting to study the transition to adulthood.\nCultural and institutional heterogeneity, economic differences and the interaction\nbetween them, have shaped an incredibly diverse way of \"becoming an adult\" in a\ndemographic sense. Contemporary diversity in pathways to adulthood has become\nevident when the data from Fertility and Family Surveys have become available for a\nlarge set of European countries (Corijn and Klijzing, 2001). This diversity appears to be\nchallenging also to scholars who have extensive experience in studying the transition to\nadulthood, and who realize that Europe provides an excellent field for investigation\n(Goldscheider, 2000). Fernandez Cord\u00f3n (1997) has argued that in a time of overall\nsocial and economic convergence in European countries, it is hard to find social\nindicators with such striking differences among EU countries as those related to the\ntransition to adulthood. The differences between societies are striking, but intra-society\nheterogeneity is massive as well. In fact, one can predict that individualization and path\ndependence may also produce a macro-level convergence to micro-level diversity\n(Billari and Wilson, 2001). Here, reporting analyses that are themselves heterogeneous,\nwe shall reflect upon the heterogeneity at the macro-level by looking at the main\nexplanatory ideas for societal differences in the transition to adulthood, and upon the\nmicro-macro link (how some micro-level factors do interact with macro-level\ncircumstances to shape the transition to adulthood) (Note 1).\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, after a short recall of the situation,\nwe review the explanatory directions for diversity in European transitions to adulthood.\nWe focus on macro-level differentials and on the interaction between such differential\nand micro-level determinants of life-course transitions. Pure macro relationships, with\nsome speculations on the existence of two stable patterns, are illustrated and discussed\nin Section 3. The final section contains some ideas on future directions in research.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 3: Article 2\n-- Contemporary Research on European Fertility: Perspectives and Developments --\n18 http://www.demographic-research.org\n2. European diversity in the transition to adulthood: explanatory\ndirections and their interactions\nEuropean diversity, both in states and trajectories of patterns in transition to adulthood,\nis a clear challenge for researchers interested in the topic, as it has been since early\npioneering studies (Kiernan, 1986). It is also a challenge for those who want to\ninvestigate whether a modernization process is guiding demographic behavior in\nEurope, and whether there will be a convergence in demographic behavior\n(Goldscheider, 2000; Coleman, 2002). This appears clearly from data from the Fertility\nand Family Surveys held (mostly) during the 1990s. We chose a simple indicator: the\nshare of individuals having left home, formed a union, and having become parents by\nage 25 (for women, see Table 1). Similar results are obtained by looking at different\nindicators. In the literature we can also find analyses of the sequencing of events using\nFFS data, showing similar degrees of heterogeneity between nations (Billari et al.,\nTo start our discussion on explanatory directions, we can allude to two opposite\npatterns in age at home-leaving: 1) the \"latest-late\" pattern in Southern Europe, with\nlate transitions that are highly de-standardized by age, but very standardized vis-\u00e0-vis\nthe relationship to union formation; 2) the \"earliest-early\" pattern of transition of\nNordic countries (the term is willingly exaggerated) where the detachment from\nparental home takes place around age 19/20, with a high age standardization and a more\ndiverse connection with union formation. Other European societies may be considered\nto be in between such extreme cases. Why is there such diversity? And why is such\ndiversity narrowing, showing convergence for some behavior, while it is even\nincreasing, with signs of divergence, for other types of behavior? An answer to such\nquestions is more the task of an entire research program than the capacity of a paper.\nHere we shall sketch some of the explanatory directions that have been taken,\ndistinguishing macro-level factors and trends, and the interaction between macro- and\nmicro-level factors. We shall put a particular emphasis on the latter point and in\nparticular on 1) how micro-level determinants can have different weight in different\nmacro-level situations and 2) how social interactions may shape the transition to\nadulthood (especially in terms of postponement of events).\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 3: Article 2\n-- Contemporary Research on European Fertility: Perspectives and Developments --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 19\nTable 1: Women having experienced demographic events by the 25th birthday, two\ncohorts at 10-year distance: estimates from the Fertility and Family\nSurveys.\nCountry Cohorts Have left the\nparental\nhome\nHave entered a\nco-resident\nunion\nHave\nbecome\nmothers\nHave left the\nparental\nhome\nHave entered a\nco-resident\nunion\nHave\nbecome\nmothers\nBelgium (Flemish\nspeaking)\nSource: UN/ECE FFS Standard Country Tables: http://www.unece.org/ead/pau/ffs/ffs_standtabframe.htm.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 3: Article 2\n-- Contemporary Research on European Fertility: Perspectives and Developments --\n20 http://www.demographic-research.org\n2.1 Macro-level explanations of international differences: institutional and\nconjunctural factors, long-term cultural differences and ideational change\nMacro-level factors affecting the transition to adulthood can be, in a simplified view,\ncategorized on a 2 x 2 table. On one dimension of the table we can put the traditional\n\"culture vs. economy\" dichotomy. In this paper we take a broad view of economy as\n\"political economy\" or \"political economics\" (Persson and Tabellini, 2000): our notion\nof economy includes economic trends, institutional settings and the welfare state (i.e.\nthe broad interactions between the economic and political setting). On the other\ndimension of the table, we can put the historical stability of macro-level factors (slowly\nchanging vs. quickly changing). The transition to adulthood in European nations is\nshaped, on the one hand, by slowly changing institutional factors (i.e. the welfare state),\nas well as by specific socio-economic policies (i.e. labor market or housing policies,\nthat is, factors that change more quickly than institutions) (Note 2). In fact, seminal\npapers have indicated the transition to adulthood as an illustrative case of a set of\nproblems concerning the way institutional constraints affect the construction of the life\ncourse (Modell et al., 1976). On the other hand, the way one becomes an adult in a\ndemographic sense is shaped by long-term cultural differences that have deep historical\nroots (i.e. normative expectations and ideals on intergenerational relationships and\nfamily ties), as well as by ideational factors whose dynamics is faster than long-term\ncultural differences (i.e. value orientations). All such factors are important in shaping\nactual differences between countries, although each of the four types of explanatory\nfactors actually refers to a different scholar tradition.\nAs far as institutional factors are concerned, they are of primary interest to\nscholars interested in studying the welfare state, and they are connected to long-term\ndifferences between countries in the transition to adulthood that are resisting forces\ndriving convergence. In particular, the idea that different welfare regimes exist, each\nwith specific life course consequences, is at the heart of the work of Esping-Andersen\n(1999) and Mayer (2001). The main issue in the literature concerns the number of\nwelfare regimes we should use to describe current institutional settings in Europe. So\nfar, a principal focus has been on Western Europe. A three-world categorization was\nfirst proposed by Esping-Andersen, who also leaves the door open for a four-world\ncategorization (Note 3) \u00ad including 1) Social democratic (Nordic) welfare regimes\noriented to individuals; 2) Liberal market welfare regimes (again oriented to\nindividuals); 3) Conservative continental welfare regimes oriented to the family, and 4)\nSouthern European or Familistic (Note 4) welfare regimes (Note 5). Each of the\nregimes shapes, in a completely different way, the whole \"package\" of behaviors in the\ntransition to adulthood (as an example we report the predictions of Mayer in Table 2).\nIn fact, the emergence of modern welfare states is one of the main factors that have\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 3: Article 2\n-- Contemporary Research on European Fertility: Perspectives and Developments --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 21\ncontributed to the \"institutionalization\" of the life course, and such institutionalization\nhas been mostly concerned with the transition to adulthood (Mayer and M\u00fcller, 1986).\nThis influence is also going to continue: Blossfeld (2000), for instance, has argued that\ncountry-specific institutions will channel the way through which the globalization of\neconomic life will affect life courses of individuals in developed countries, thus\npreventing life courses from becoming more similar.\nAs a caveat, and to get back to the economy (or institution) vs. culture debate,\nprominent scholars in the literature on welfare regimes note that such regimes cannot be\ntaken as purely exogenous in the long-run perspective (Mayer, 2001). For instance,\nwhether a society encourages young adults to attend higher education at universities\nwith on-campus accommodation, as opposed to having local universities where young\nadults and their parents can co-reside for a longer period, depends on the prevailing\nviews of inter-generational relationships. The causal link would then be from the\ncultural framework to the making of institutional settings, which would mean that in a\nlonger causation chain, long-term cultural differences explain a substantial part of the\ndifferences in family (Pfau-Effinger, 1999) and social policies.\nTable 2: Prediction of life course outcomes in four types of political economies\naccording to Mayer.\nLiberal Conservative Social Democratic Familistic\nAge at leaving home Early, high variance Medium, high variance Early, low variance Late, high variance\nAge at leaving\nschool/training\nMedium homogeneous High stratified Medium Low stratified\nLabor market entry Early, stop-gap, low skill Late, integrated, high skill Early, integrated Late, marginal\nSocial and economic policies that are in place during a specific time period also\nsignificantly shape the transition to adulthood. We refer, for instance, to specific\npolicies (i.e. fiscal policies, family policies, housing policies, labor-market policies) that\nmay change faster than the institutional setting. This is also true of specific economic\ntrends that are not explicitly under the control of national policy-makers (see i.e.\nAndersson, 2000; Hoem, 2000 on the transition to parenthood and fertility). Economic\ntrends and socio-economic policies are so clearly interrelated that it is often not possible\nto identify their separate effects on demographic behavior (see i.e. Hoem and Hoem,\n1997). The adoption of new policies, i.e. on housing subsidies or on limits to down-\npayment in mortgages, are clearly important determinants of how young adults shape\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 3: Article 2\n-- Contemporary Research on European Fertility: Perspectives and Developments --\n22 http://www.demographic-research.org\ntheir pathways to adulthood, and the same is true for family policies, such as maternity\npolicies, parental-leave policies, childcare services, and child benefits (Neyer, 2003). It\nis difficult to disentangle whether such policies belong to the welfare state per se (and\nthus are stable in a mid-term historical perspective), or whether they belong to political\nchoices that are continuously subject to revision. In any case, changes in such policies\nmodify the opportunities that young adults face during their early adult years, and they\ncan be read in the classic demographic terms of \"period effects\". The spread of\nuncertainty in young adulthood, as in the case of increasingly difficult access to the\nlabor market, as well as other factors, for instance increases in the return to education,\nmay also explain period trends and differences (Bernardi, 2000). In fact, the latter type\nof factors has been used by Kohler et al. (2002) to argue that postponement of the\ntransition to parenthood (but similarly, of other demographic events during early\nadulthood) may arise as a rational response to socio-economic incentives. Socio-\neconomic conjunctural factors may explain sudden changes in patterns in a country, and\nthey may constitute macro-events that trigger changes having long-term consequences.\nSuch conjunctural factors are, however, unlikely to explain long-term stable differences\nbetween societies. But we shall return to the issue in Section 2.2.\nConcerning long-term cultural differences that form the basis of present\ndifferences in behavior, we may distinguish the literature along east-west and north-\nsouth divides. Of course, these divisions are necessarily simplistic (similar to divisions\naccording to welfare regimes). Hajnal (1965) (Note 6) traces an east-west divide in\nhistorical family systems in Europe: the Hajnal line runs along an imaginary line\nconnecting Trieste and St. Petersburg. To the west of the line the family formation\npattern leans towards a neo-local nuclear family, with relatively late marriage and a\nsignificant proportion of people who never married. Of those not marrying, most of the\npeople leave the parental home anyway. To the east of the line, marriage is supposed to\nbe early and universal, and the family is often extended. However, this last feature has\nan ambivalent impact. Early and generalized leaving home occurs for those who marry\nearly without staying with their parents. Those who marry and stay with their parents\nmay continue living with their parents for a long time, and in some cases they may also\nopt for co-residence with their parents as a permanent solution. A great heterogeneity\nhas been shown by studies focusing to the west of the Trieste-St. Petersburg line. Pre-\nindustrial patterns within the West show that early home leaving prior to marriage was\nnorth-western parts of the continent, a significant percentage of young people spent a\nmore or less prolonged period of time outside their parents' household, normally\ninvolved as rural servants or as urban workers. As a consequence, young people often\nleft the parental household long before marriage. The same was not true in other areas\nof South-western Europe, where time spent as servants was normally short-lived, and\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 3: Article 2\n-- Contemporary Research on European Fertility: Perspectives and Developments --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 23\nonly involved a small percentage of the population. Nevertheless, the existing picture of\nhistorical co-residential patterns is far from complete, and it shows considerable\ngeographical and historical variance. Specific demographic, economic, and cultural\nfactors determined family and household systems (just as they do today), including\nconsiderable regional variations on attributes such as the welfare capability of the\nfamily, the functioning of the household as a working unit, the role and status of\nwomen, marriage patterns, and co-residence of kin, among others (Wall, 1995). The\npresence of long-term cultural continuities, in particular concerning the strength of\ninter-generational ties between societies, has been emphasized by scholars looking at\ndifferences between North-western and South-western Europe (Reher, 1998; Micheli,\ncomprehensively compares historical and current family patterns in Europe, west of the\nTrieste-St. Petersburg line. He emphasizes the Southern European pattern of household\nformation, relating a cleavage between two patterns to the times of the late Roman\nEmpire and the early Middle Ages. According to Reher, in Southern Europe, the\ninfluence of Muslims raised the importance of kinship and vertical relationships\nbetween generations, so that the prolonged stay of children in their parents' home and\nthe caring work of children towards their parents are two faces of the same coin, a\n\"strong\" family. Some authors emphasize historical continuity up to the extreme,\nsubstantially denying that there is anything new in the transition to adulthood of\nItalians, and that \"latest-late\" transition have traditionally been there (Barbagli et al.,\n2003). In the North, Germanic tradition and the Reformation contributed to the\ndevelopment of a \"weak\" family. Such differences have contributed to shape\ninstitutional settings at the societal level, with, for instance, welfare states implicitly or\nexplicitly favoring various types of living arrangements (Holdsworth, 2000). Besides\ndifferences in the actual timing of life course transitions, it is interesting to notice that\nthe share of young adults who declare to be dependent on parents and/or family\nmembers for their income (now the majority in the EU 15) is by far larger in \"strong\nties\" and familistic societies with respect to \"weak ties\" social-democratic societies\n(Table 3). This dependence also translates in larger inter vivos transfers from children to\nparents during key events in the transition to adulthood, and with a larger geographical\nproximity after residential independence (Glaser and Tomassini, 2000; Tomassini et al.,\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 3: Article 2\n-- Contemporary Research on European Fertility: Perspectives and Developments --\n24 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 3: Share of young adults (age 15-24) who declare to be dependent on their\nparents or family members. European Union (15 states).\n% dependent on parents/family\nCoefficient of variation between\ncountries\nSource: Eurobarometer (INRA, 2001). The coefficient of variation is computed using the data for Germany only (not distinguishing\nEast and West Germany).\nInterpretations based on ideational change, clearly connected to modernization\ntheories, have almost become a paradigm for the interpretation of demographic change\nin Western societies, with the key idea of a Second Demographic Transition starting in\nadvocated by the proponents of ideational change as the main motor are the\naccentuation of individual autonomy, the rejection of institutional control and\nautonomy, and the rise of values associated to \"higher order needs\" (see i.e. Surkyn and\nLesthaeghe, 2004). The emergence of \"new\" behaviors (like unmarried cohabitation\nand single living) during early adult years, has been taken as one of the signs of the\nprocess of individualization of life courses which is used to depict the evolution of\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 3: Article 2\n-- Contemporary Research on European Fertility: Perspectives and Developments --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 25\nWestern European and North American societies towards a \"new modernity\"\nnormative regulation of life courses becomes more lenient than in the past (somehow\ndifferently from the idea that life courses are institutionalized by the welfare state)\n(Note 7). We can locate the ideational change point of view within a \"developmental\"\nidea of societies that is common among demographers analyzing long-term trends:\nsocieties are assumed to develop through stages over a sequence leading to a certain\ndirection. This idea, intertwined with the notion of \"transition\", has had an impressive\nimpact on demographic research (Thornton, 2001). Of course, cross-country analyses in\na specific period do not necessarily provide perfect tests for the transition to new\nsituations, because if transitions follow specific sequences, different societies can be\nfound in different stages of such a sequence (van de Kaa, 1997) (Note 8). During a\ntransition, there may also be rise in the difference between societies. A simple instance\nof continuity and change in ideas is reported in Table 4, where we can see data from the\nindicators of secularization and tolerance, for instance those related to the rights of\nhomosexuals to get married and/or to adopt children, we can see that young Europeans\nare still fairly heterogeneous, and that the heterogeneity between countries has even\nrisen when looking at a simple indicator such as the coefficient of variation between\ncountries.\nTo sum up, no single approach is in principle satisfactory per se in explaining\ndifferences in the transition to adulthood in Europe, let alone extreme cases such as the\n\"latest-late\" pattern of Southern Europeans. It is plausible to think that all factors play a\nrole and intersect in creating an extreme situation. The Southern European familistic\nwelfare regime, as predicted for instance by Mayer, pushes the postponement of young\nadult transition further to later ages. The lack of social policies (i.e. unemployment\nprotection) and the weakness of family policies constitute a further element, together\nwith rising uncertainty in a two-tier labor market. In addition, strong links between\nparents and children and long co-residence are not at all new under the Southern sun, as\nresearchers who are scrutinizing history emphasize. Furthermore, ideational changes\nthat have taken place in most other parts of Europe will still take some time to evolve in\nthe Southern region. The challenge for research, and for policymakers interested in\nhelping young people make their choices, is to evaluate the relative weight of the\ndifferent factors in shaping the extreme case. Needless to say, different combinations of\nthe factors may explain the other side of the extreme (i.e. the Nordic pattern of\ntransition to adulthood). We shall go back to this idea in Section 3. Prior to that, we\nshall discuss how the impact of micro-level factors is channeled through the macro-\nlevel contextual determinants that we have discussed so far.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 3: Article 2\n-- Contemporary Research on European Fertility: Perspectives and Developments --\n26 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 4: Share of young adults (age 15-24) in favor of the rights of homosexuals\nGet married Adopt children\nCoefficient of variation between\ncountries\nSource: Eurobarometer (INRA, 2001). The coefficient of variation is computed using the data for Germany only (not distinguishing\nEast and West Germany).\n2.2 Micro-macro interactions: from small at micro to large at macro?\nDifferences among countries in behavior can also be due to differences in the\npopulation composition according to micro-level determinants. At one extreme,\ndifferences can be due to pure compositional effects. For instance, lower income for\nindividuals means more limited possibilities to access housing at a given equal market\nprice, and obviously a change in per-capita income at the national level implies that\nthere will be more individuals with limited possibilities to access housing, market prices\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 3: Article 2\n-- Contemporary Research on European Fertility: Perspectives and Developments --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 27\nbeing equal. This may partially account for some differences, although the observed\ndifferences between Central/Eastern and Western Europe go in the opposite direction,\nas we could expect from this simple reasoning. Another possible source of\ncompositional effects is education. For instance, individuals wishing to pursue higher\neducation may be more prone to leave their parental home to move closer to\nuniversities, and the educational composition of a population may explain part of the\ndifferences in age at leaving home. But as we have noticed, at least among Western\nEuropean countries, the amount of economic convergence is by far larger than the\namount of convergence in pathways to adulthood.\nMicro-macro interactions are more interesting for the purpose of this paper, both\nfrom the theoretical side and for the possibility of explaining national differences. Some\nfactors at the macro-level are channeling the impact of micro-level characteristics on\nthe transition to adulthood. In particular, we shall discuss two types of such\ninteractions: 1) interactions between individual-level factors and the political-economic\ncontext; 2) social interactions that may shape the transition to adulthood, and that imply\npersisting national differences even when the underlying factors are no longer active.\nThese types of interactions can fuel macro-level factors and contribute to perpetuating\ndifferentials, both between and within societies.\nAmong scholars interested in the impact of welfare regimes during the life course,\nthere has been a long-lasting interest in comparing the impact of micro-level factors\namong different societies. An example of the interaction between individual-level\nfactors and institutional context can be found for instance in the findings of Aassve et\nal. (2002). They argue that income differentials can partially explain the postponement\nof leaving home in several European societies, but what is most important is that the\neffect of income is different according to the welfare regime. Table 5 shows such\nimpact. Earning an own income is more important for young adults living in Southern\nEurope and in liberal market welfare regimes (i.e. the U.K) than for those living in\ncontinental and social democratic welfare regimes. This implies that 1) individual-level\ndifferences in income are more important in accounting for differences in age at leaving\nhome in countries where leaving home happens at the latest ages (consistently with\npredictions from Mayer, 2001 for example); 2) potential policies targeted at increasing\nthe income of young adults may anticipate independent living more in countries where\nsuch independent living is postponed; 3) small differences in average income (i.e. per-\ncapita income in Southern Europe being slightly lower than the one in Northern\nEurope) may become amplified by the institutional arrangement, and thus account for\nnational differences because of this interaction.\nAnother example of interaction is between individual-level factors and time-\nvarying policies. Not only can policies affect the transition to adulthood, but socio-\neconomic or family policies may also affect different social strata in a different way.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 3: Article 2\n-- Contemporary Research on European Fertility: Perspectives and Developments --\n28 http://www.demographic-research.org\nAassve et al. (2003) analyze the impact of the transition from a general to a means-\ntested type of family allowance in Hungary during the mid-1990s. The impact of the\npolicy change has been to broaden the age gap in the transition to motherhood between\nhigh and low social strata (represented by educational levels). As soon as the family\nallowance became universal again, the differences returned to the initial level. The\ninteraction between micro-level and macro-level is also present in the interrelationships\nbetween events in the transition to adulthood: Baiz\u00e1n et al. (2002), for instance, have\nshown that out-of-union conceptions lead more often to marriage than to cohabitation in\nWest Germany, with respect to Sweden. This can be explained by the presence of\ndifferences in both the fiscal treatment and the acceptability of pre-marital births in the\ntwo societies.\nTable 5: Effects on the probability of leaving home, of being employed and having\nincome in the upper quartile (inverse Mill's ratio). Estimates from the\nEuropean Community Household Panel.\nMales Females\nThe lesson we can learn from micro-macro interactions on the determinants of the\ntransition to adulthood is that there is nothing like the true effect of a variable when\nstudying the life courses of Europeans. Europe is heterogeneous and ever changing. The\ninstitutional and cultural variables we have discussed in Section 2.1 are always \u00ad with\nvariable extent \u00ad channeling the impact of micro-level factors, although one can devise\ngroups of societies where similar outcomes may be predicted. The combination of\nmeasures of factors at both macro- and micro-level in the explanation of micro-level\ntransitions to adulthood is certainly a promising avenue that will have to be followed in\nthe years to come.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 3: Article 2\n-- Contemporary Research on European Fertility: Perspectives and Developments --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 29\nAs far as social interactions are concerned, they have been of primary interest in\nthe recent demographic literature on fertility decline (i.e. Bongaarts and Watkins, 1996;\nMontgomery and Casterline, 1996; Kohler, 2001), and they have also been used as a\npossible explanation of lowest-low fertility (Kohler et al., 2002). Social interaction\neffects refer mainly to \"social influence\" and \"social learning\". Their peculiarities are\nsuch, as they may entail 1) social multiplier effects (similar to the ones we have noticed\non the interaction between income and institutional setting), with overall behavioral\nimpact that is larger than what has been initially triggered; 2) multiple equilibria, with\nmore than one stable regime (i.e. early home-leaving such as in Nordic countries, and\nlate home-leaving such as in Southern Europe); 3) status-quo enforcement and path\ndependence, where the present situations maintain long-term impact. As an example,\nthe decision to stay in the parental home versus leaving is likely to be affected by social\nlearning: young adults may use their friends as a point of comparison in their decision\nmaking about leaving home. In this case, a widespread postponement of home-leaving\n(i.e. like in Southern Europe) leaves fewer opportunities for social learning, and the\npostponement may become even more pronounced. The same impact is plausible for\nunion formation, and for first births (Kohler et al., 2002). Other factors like social\nnorms or feedback from the marriage market are included in the impact of social\ninteraction. Of great importance for our argumentation here are the consequences for\nnational-level differences in the transition to adulthood. We name two such\nconsequences. First, the presence of multiple equilibria and path dependence imply a\nmuch stronger stability of long-term differences (i.e. based on long-term family models\nor on institutional settings), independently of the convergence in terms of other factors.\nSecond, social interaction effects typically give rise to transitions that continue\nindependently of the factors that originated from such transitions. The idea of\npostponement transition has been used by Kohler et al. (2002) to describe the\npostponement of first births, but it can be translated to other events during early\nadulthood, such as leaving home and first union. As we have seen from data on leaving\nhome in Table 1, however, the postponement of home-leaving is not visible i.e. in\nNordic countries, and this is particularly plausible as the present situation may be a\nstable equilibrium. In general, the postponement transition is visible for first births and\nmarriage, while it is not widespread for first unions in general, and leaving home. We\nshall use the idea of multiple equilibria a bit later on to speculate on the presence of two\nextreme \u00ad and relatively stable \u00ad patterns of transition to adulthood in Europe.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 3: Article 2\n-- Contemporary Research on European Fertility: Perspectives and Developments --\n30 http://www.demographic-research.org\n3. Macro-macro relationships: some interesting cross-country\ncorrelations with age at leaving home (are there two patterns?)\nWe have referred to the timing and context of leaving the parental home as the event in\nthe transition to adulthood, where both 1) international differences in Europe are\nimportantly marked; and 2) there is no clear common trend, and on the contrary, there\nseem to be divergent trends with countries at one extreme (\"latest-late\") clearly\npostponing, and countries at the other extreme (\"earliest-early\"), stable in their early\ntransition. We have also argued that a complex web of macro-level explanatory factors\nis necessary to get to the extreme case, and we have also argued that the macro-level\nfactors may interact with micro-level determinants. In the fertility literature, there has\nbeen a recent upsurge of interest in the analysis of cross-sectional correlations as a tool\nto gain additional knowledge of the determinants of international differences. In\nparticular, there is a line in the literature discussing the reasons of the changing cross-\ncountry correlation between female labor force participation and fertility in the last part\nof the Twentieth century (see i.e. Ahn and Mira, 2002; Engelhardt and Prskawetz, 2004;\nK\u00f6gel, 2004). This approach has been generalized, and one can see that several cross-\ncountry relationships between fertility and fertility-related behaviors have changed from\ncross-national approach, and perform an exploratory analysis based on cross-country\ncorrelation coefficients to relate the timing of leaving home with a series of socio-\neconomic indicators on 1) the social and economic condition of youth and 2) the\nrelationships between generations. Of course, cross-country correlations cannot be\nconsidered an indication of cause-effect relationship. We use them to discuss the\nmacro-level ideas outlined above, with some provoking speculations, and to discuss the\npotential stability of the opposite situations \"latest-late\" and \"earliest-early\".\nTable 6 reports the matrix of correlation coefficients between the median ages at\nleaving home derived from the FFS (Note 9) and other indicators, stemming mostly\nfrom OECD source. We focus on the first column, where we see the correlation of the\nvarious indicators with the timing of leaving home. As far as intergenerational\nrelationships are concerned, we see that the median age at leaving home is positively\ncorrelated (0.620) with the share of social expenditure for old-age pensions, and\nnegatively correlated (-0.714) with the share of older adults living in institutions. This is\nin accordance with Reher's \"strong family\" hypothesis, and with the idea that these\ndeeply-rooted differences may have shaped the institutional settings. However, a causal\nfeedback cannot be ruled out as well. What is important here is that \"latest-late\"\ntransitions out of the parental home are more common in countries in which the welfare\nis strongly directed towards the elderly, and in which, according to the literature, the\nelderly have a stronger say in family ties (see i.e. Glaser and Tomassini, 2000 and\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 3: Article 2\n-- Contemporary Research on European Fertility: Perspectives and Developments --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 31\nTomassini et al., 2003). The same consistent picture arises when we look at indicators\nof the socio-economic status of young adults. The median age at leaving home is\nnegatively correlated with the relative risk of becoming poor during early adulthood (-\n0.522), and with the suicide rate (-0.430): note that the correlation between suicide rates\nand poverty is lower in absolute terms being 0.280. There seem to be some advantages\nof the \"strong family\" model with late independence in terms of protection of young\nadults from poverty and mental breakdown (Note 10). Of course, we cannot translate\ndirectly these correlations to the individual level: we may, however, speculate that in\ncountries characterized by the \"strong family\", when the family is weak (given the lack\nof welfare), poverty and other problems may become much more important (again, this\nis the interaction of institutional setting and individual-level features). The strength of\nthe family goes also against the strength of welfare transfers and of other types of\nrelationships: the median age at leaving home is negatively correlated with\nunemployment benefits (in terms of replacement rate) for singles (-0.387), and with the\nparticipation in associations or other non-profit organizations (-0.562).\nTable 6: Cross-country correlation matrix between indicators of home-leaving\ntiming and other indicators in European FFS countries (end of the\nNote: data refer to 19 countries (with some missing values).

If we look at the motivation behind what youth thinks\nabout late home-leaving (Table 7), it is precisely in Sweden (with a high state support)\nthat we see the highest share of \"can't afford to move out\" answer, although Spain\nshows an equally high level in 2001. Housing problems are named more frequently in\nthe Netherlands (where the state supports housing to a great extent). \"New modern\"\nstrong ties (parents are less strict) are more frequently cited in Greece and Italy, Austria\nand Germany, indicating the feeling that co-residence is more often a choice there, with\nrespect to other countries. We can thus conclude this part by hypothesizing that the two\nopposite patterns \"latest-late\" and \"earliest-early\" are consistent with the macro-level\nsituation of the respective societies (familialistic welfare state on the one hand, and\nTable 7: Share of young adults (age 15-24) who mention reasons for why youth\nare living longer at their parents' home.

As intergenerational relationships substantially shape these two extreme\npatterns \"latest-late\" and \"earliest-early\", the future aging population, with a quicker\naging in \"latest-late\" countries (Billari et al., 2000), may be the challenge that will put\nthe very existence of such patterns in discussion.\n4. Discussion\nWe have illustrated the idea that extreme cases (and their opposites) in demographic\nresearch are important challenges for researchers. We have also noticed that the\nheterogeneity of European countries is a blessing for scholars interested in studying the\nimportance of macro-level conditions in shaping the life courses of youth. The\ntransition to adulthood in Europe, with the \"latest-late\" pattern of Southern Europe,\nprovides an extreme case among industrialized countries. This extreme case can be\ncompared to its opposite that we dare call the \"earliest-early\" pattern of transition to\nadulthood in Nordic countries. Explaining the emergence and persistence of such\nextreme cases implies references to multifaceted approaches. Welfare state and\ninstitutional arrangements, historical and deeply rooted cultural differences, as well as\neconomic and policy factors, and ideational change, all contribute in creating an\nextreme case at the national level. Such factors also contribute in explaining that micro-\nlevel life course determinants play different roles in different European societies. Given\ncurrent knowledge, and the ideas that first there may be multiple equilibria in the way\nthe transition to adulthood is shaped (if there are equilibria at all), and second path\ndependence assures that the present and past situation affects the future course, extreme\ncases can be quite stable and population aging may become the main homeostatic force\ncontributing to a convergence of behavior.\nFuture research on becoming an adult in Europe will gain a great advantage from\nthe new generation of longitudinal surveys, coupled with contextual-level databases that\nis foreseen for instance in the Generations and Gender Programme since its inception\n(Hoem et al., 2000). These surveys, with their multidisciplinary orientations, will allow\nresearchers to assess the relative weight of factors in shaping international differences.\nWe agree with Lesthaeghe (1998) that demographers should avoid \"disciplinary soccer\ngames\" like in the culture vs. economy debate, but we also see the need for assessing\nthe relative importance of different types of factors. Our provocative ideas on cross-\ncountry correlations between age at home-leaving and other socio-economic indicators,\nand on the \"two patterns\" of transition to adulthood, also call for a greater importance\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 3: Article 2\n-- Contemporary Research on European Fertility: Perspectives and Developments --\n34 http://www.demographic-research.org\nof the study of implications of demographic events, both at the individual and at the\nsocial level. A greater attention placed on the implications of demographic events will\nbe of enormous importance to understand the meaning of such events in a\nheterogeneous Europe.\n5.

In the paper we will often make use of research that has been carried on within the\nResearch Group on the Demography of Early Adulthood at the Max Planck\n2. Of course, societal transformations sharply affecting institutional settings have\ntaken place in Europe, and not only in Central and Eastern Europe after the fall of\nthe Iron Curtain. Three countries in Southern Europe (Greece, Spain, and Portugal)\nfound their way out of dictatorship only in the mid 1970s.\n3. Esping-Andersen (1999, 94) states: \"a simple 'three worlds' typology may suffice\nfor most of the purposes that this book pursues. The final judgment is not yet in,\nand we shall in fact see that the distinctiveness of the Southern European countries\ndoes make its mark on issues such as post-industrial employment adaptation. \"\n4. \"Familialistic\" according to Esping-Andersen (1999).\nMayer (2001). The typologies outlined have been criticised by feminists for their\nlack of genderization, and other groupings of countries have been proposed (see the\n7. For a critical view on the individualization thesis as applied to the transition to\nadulthood see Schizzerotto and Lucchini (2002).\n8. Some scholars put together the four types of explanations we have discussed to\nEuropean countries based on demographic and socio-economic variables. This\nclustering is used to define the \"diversity\" of European countries that lies under\nscenarios for population projections (de Beer and van Wissen, 1999). Five clusters\nare identified, according to the dominant \"culture\": 1) the maternalistic cluster\nincluding the five Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and\nSweden), which as a main characterization has \"the relatively high level of female\nparticipation in the labor market, the high level of childcare facilities and the fact\nthat female values like co-operation are emphasized\", together a \"relatively low\nlevel of individualism and conservativism\" (Mellens, 1999b, 34); 2) the pragmatic\ncluster includes Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg,\nNetherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, with high emphasis on\neconomic performance and \"not extreme\" scores on the equality of gender roles\nand conservativism; 3) the paternalistic cluster including Southern European\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 3: Article 2\n-- Contemporary Research on European Fertility: Perspectives and Developments --\n36 http://www.demographic-research.org\ncountries (Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain), with \"the prevalence of traditional\nfamily values, the lack of female emancipation and the low level of childcare\nfacilities\" (Mellens, 1999b, 36), with high scores on conservativism and low on\ngender equality; 4) the intermediate culture, in Central Europe (Croatia, Czech\nRepublic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovak Republic, and\nSlovenia), which characterizes the more westernized of the former communist\ncountries; 5) the post-totalitarian cluster (Belarus, Bulgaria, Moldova, Romania,\nRussia, and Ukraine), with an \"incomplete transition to a capitalist structure\"\n(Mellens, 1999b, 37). In building population scenarios, it is assumed that the\ndifferences among clusters persist, although convergence within clusters will be\nobserved. A similar approach is adopted by Pinnelli et al. (2001).\n9. The median age is refereed to women of cohorts born around 1960. As cross-\nnational differences are rather persistent (Corijn and Klijzing, 2001; Billari and\nWilson, 2001), this figure can be considered as representative of the home-leaving\npattern at the national level.\n10. Research on home-leaving in the United Kingdom has traditionally been concerned\nwith the poverty risks of youth leaving home at early ages (Jones, 1995).\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 3: Article 2\n-- Contemporary Research on European Fertility: Perspectives and Developments --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 37\nReferences\nAassve, A., Billari, F.C., Mazzuco, S., and Ongaro, F., 2002. \"Leaving home: A\ncomparative analysis of ECHP data.\" Journal of European Social Policy 12 (4):\nAassve, A., Billari, F.C., and Sp\u00e9der, Z., 2003. \"Family formation during the Hungarian\nsocietal transition: trends in postponement and the impact of policy changes.\"\nUnpublished manuscript.\nAhn, N., and Mira, P., 2002. \"A note on the changing relationship between fertility and\nfemale employment rates in developed countries.\" Journal of Population\nAndersson, G., 2000. \"The impact of labor-force participation on childbearing behavior:\nBaiz\u00e1n, P., Aassve, A., and Billari, F.C., 2002. \"Institutional arrangements and life\ncourse outcomes: The interrelations between cohabitation, marriage and first\nbirth in Germany and Sweden.\" MPIDR WP 2002-026.
