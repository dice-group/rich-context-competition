    "abstract": "Abstract\nResearch in digital libraries (DLs) has gained much interest across the globe. Most funding related to DL are available\nfor building DLs, rather than producing digital librarians by developing the DL curricula and offering necessary funding to\nintroduce state-of-the-art DL labs for future library professionals. Based on online surveys, this article investigates the status\nof DL education/courses in Europe, particularly, it examines the curriculum contents of DL courses, explores the future\ndirection of library and information science (LIS) curricula, and identifies the competitors of LIS schools in the DL world. This\nstudy received responses from 54 LIS schools/departments in 27 European countries. The results of the current study clearly\nshow that the majority of the LIS schools have already integrated digital librarianship in their regular bachelor's and master's\ndegree programs. The importance of practical aspects in DL curricula has been highlighted by the authors. The study also\nreports the recommended books and journals on DL, direction of LIS curricula, and the competitors of LIS schools in the\ndigital world. A number of future research directions have been offered by the authors. The authors expect that the study\nwill contribute to the discussions and debates toward identifying subject elements for DL courses. The top subject areas\nbased on their importance as reported by the participants of the current study should be taken into consideration before\ndesigning curricula for DLs and before developing a Europe-wide unique LIS curriculum.\n",

Since the early 1990s, a significant amount\nof money has been invested in DL research (Pomerantz,\nAbbas, & Mostafa, 2009; Pomerantz, Oh, Yang, Fox, &\nWildemuth, 2006). Many governments in different countries\nacross the world have invested in building their national\nDLs. However, in the United States, DL research has\nattracted much more attention and funding than other parts\nof the world. A significant number of grants are awarded in\nthe United States to collaborative DL education projects.\nFor example, Institute of Museum and Library Services\n(IMLS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) granted\na number of collaborative DL education projects in the\nUnited States. A very highly significant DL curriculum proj-\nect of Virginia Tech (VT) and the University of North\nCarolina (UNC) was granted a 3-year grant of over half a\nmillion dollars in 2006. It is perhaps the first formal coop-\neration in this field between computer science (CS) and\nlibrary and information science (LIS) and between institu-\ntions (Ma, Clegg, & O'Brien, 2009). This curriculum proj-\nect has affected LIS curriculum and teaching, in particular\nDL curriculum across the world. Readers interested in\nknowing more about the curriculum can read works of Oh,\nYang, Pomerantz, Wildemuth, and Fox (2015) and Yang,\nWildemuth, Pomerantz, Oh, and Fox (2009) and can check\ntheir website at http://curric.dlib.vt.edu/\nIn Europe, there have been several projects and funding\nnationally and locally that focus on DL development. The\nwas launched in September 2005 suggesting the creation\nof a European DL and the promotion of Europe-wide DL\ninitiatives. In November 2008, Europeana--Europe's\nonline library, museum, and archive--was opened to make\nEurope's rich cultural and scientific heritage accessible to\nall over the Internet.\n1Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences, Norway\n2University of Dhaka, Bangladesh\n3University of Western Ontario, London, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nNafiz Zaman Shuva, Assistant Professor, Department of Information\nScience and Library Management, University of Dhaka, Dhaka 1000,\nBangladesh.\nEmail: nafiz_z@hotmail.com\nDigital Library Education in\nEurope: A Survey\nRagnar Andreas Audunson1 and Nafiz Zaman Shuva2,3\n Keywords\ndigital library education in Europe, collaboration in digital library education, recommended curriculum for DL education, LIS\neducation in Europe, future directions for DL education\n2 SAGE Open\nIn Europe, in recognition of the importance of DL educa-\ntion, EC introduced EC-financed Erasmus Mundus\nInternational Master in Digital Library Learning (DILL) in\n2007. EC financed this program for the five consecutive\nyears. Initially, DILL was managed by three European LIS\nschools, that is, Oslo and Akershus University College of\nApplied Sciences, Norway; Tallinn University, Estonia; and\nParma University, Italy. From 2015, DILL is now managed\nby Tallinn University, Estonia, and Parma University, Italy.\nOslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences\nis no more a partner of DILL. Although the EC deserves\nappreciation for introducing such an internationally recog-\nnized, highly acclaimed, first program of this type on DL\neducation, it did not extend the funding support after fifth\nintake. In an effort to encourage international students to\ngain DL expertise at two European LIS schools, the DILL\nadministration reduced the tuition fees recently. Nonetheless,\nmany students from developing countries still would not be\nable to bear the expenses of studying at European institutions\ndue to high cost of living. There are very few such examples\nof fully fledged programs on digital librarianship in Europe.\nIt is evident in the literature on DLs such as Pomerantz\nrelated to DLs are available for building DLs, rather than\nproducing digital librarians by developing the DL curriculum\nand offering necessary funding to introduce state-of-the-art\nDL lab for future library professionals.\nThis article investigates the status of DL education/courses in\nEurope, particularly, it examines the curriculum contents of DL\ncourses and future direction of LIS curricula, identifies the com-\npetitors of LIS schools in the DL world, and so forth. Finally,\nbased on the online survey results, this article offers guidelines\nfor future curriculum development in European LIS schools.\nProblem Statement\nKajberg and L\u00f8rring (2005) highlighted the importance of\njoint curriculum development and collaboration and cooper-\nation among LIS schools in Europe to offer enhanced, qual-\nity LIS education in Europe. DL is an area where the LIS\nschools in Europe can work together to create a standard cur-\nriculum for LIS schools in Europe. Moreover, LIS schools\ncan also collaborate with CS, management, and business\nschools to build an interdisciplinary DL curriculum.\nThe first step to collaboration with other LIS schools in\nEurope would be to know their curricula and schools'\nstrengths. European countries vary from each other due to\ntheir diverse cultural, historical, and language backgrounds.\nNaturally, LIS schools in Europe have different curriculum\nconcentrations. Due to language variances, it is not possible\nfor any individual researcher to examine the curriculum con-\ntents of the LIS programs based on their curricula available\nonline. The websites of many European countries are in their\nlocal languages and many LIS schools have not uploaded\ntheir curricula online. Therefore, it is not even possible for\nanyone to know the LIS courses and their curricula due to\nlanguage barriers. In such a situation, the authors of this arti-\ncle decided to use online surveys to acquire an understanding\nof the core curriculum contents of the LIS schools on DL\ncourses. The heads of the LIS departments/schools are the\nright persons to contact as they are responsible for oversee-\ning LIS schools' activities and have information about their\ncurricula and future planned initiatives.\nA number of studies, such as Spink and Cool (1999),\nand O'Brien (2006), focus on exploring DL courses in vari-\nous schools around the world and explore course contents\nand related things. The majority of the research on DL is con-\nducted in the United States, the United Kingdom, and\nCanada. Very little has been done in Europe that illustrates\nthe DL education status in the European context. Although\nthere might be studies conducted in languages other than in\nEnglish that talk about the importance of DLs in the LIS cur-\nriculum, this study is unable to account for them. A study by\nKoltay and Boda (2008) investigated the status of DL con-\ncepts in the Hungarian LIS curriculum. However, Tammaro\n(2007) offered several broad models of DL courses. A study\nby Larsen (2005) offers a brief overview of the LIS curricu-\nlum in European LIS schools, although no focus has been\ngiven to examine the DL education\u00adrelated aspects. What is\nthe status of DL courses in LIS schools in Europe? What are\nthe major curriculum contents of DL courses in European\nLIS schools? What is the future direction of the LIS curricu-\nlum? Do LIS faculty members in Europe prefer curricula that\nfocus more on practical aspects over theoretical aspects?\nThis article will address all these questions.\nLiterature Review\nIn this section, the authors only review the studies that are\nrelated to DL education, particularly talk about DL curricu-\nlum contents. Due to word limit and as this study is not based\non a literature review, the authors reviewed the key literature\non DL education. Only the studies published in English were\nconsidered for this article. The authors also did not include\nany discussion on library education in Europe. Readers inter-\nested in knowing more about library and information educa-\nMa et al. (2009) in their article highlighted the importance\nof teaching DL:\nThere is a clear demand for the hiring of digital librarians in\ndigital information management, and this is a worldwide trend;\nThere is increasing demand for the development of educational\nDLs and other types of managed digital collections such as\nInstitutional Repositories. (p. 536)\nAudunson and Shuva 3\nA recent book by Myburgh and Tammaro (2013) dis-\ncusses various areas in education for digital librarians includ-\ning curriculum design, pedagogies, and the future role of LIS\nprofessionals.\nDahlstr\u00f6m and Doracic (2009) examined the cultural heri-\ntage (CH) digitalization education in 12 European LIS\nschools in five European countries. The authors particularly\nfocused on the CH digitalization education at Swedish\nSchool of Library and Information Science (SSLIS). They\nhighlighted the changes associated with developing and\nmanaging CH digitization courses. In a study, Macevicit,\nWilson, and Francke (2009) illustrated the contents and\ndesign of international master's programs in DLs and infor-\nmation services at SSLIS.\nBased on web analysis, one of the most cited studies on DL\nLIS programs in the United States and Canada. Out of the 56\nLIS programs, 47 (89%) include DL in some form or another\nor to some degree in their curriculum; for 5 (9%) programs,\nthis cannot be determined and 4 (7%) programs show no pres-\nence of DL education. The authors conducted a detailed exam-\nination of presented curricula, course descriptions, syllabi, and\nother information on the LIS programs studied.\nAbrizah, Noorhidawati, Hilmi, and Azeana (2009) exam-\nined 13 LIS schools in the United States, the United Kingdom,\nCanada, Australia, and New Zealand offering DL courses.\nThey found that out of the 13 LIS schools, six schools were\noffering an independent or a full DL course, three were offer-\ning a DL course integrated with other topics, and four were\noffering courses that cover processes that are closely related to\nDLs such as digital curation and digitization of archives. The\nauthors also reported the DL education scenario in Malaysia.\nInterdisciplinary curriculum development has received\nmuch interest and attention recently after the curriculum devel-\nopment project of VT-UNC Digital Library Curriculum. This\nand builds upon a collaboration between VT and the UNC-CH\n(DigitalLibraryCurriculumProject,2009).TheVTDepartment\nof Computer Science and the UNC-CH School of Information\nand Library Science developed curricular materials for DL\neducation, appropriate for the CS and LIS communities (Yang,\nInterdisciplinary curriculum and its related areas have\nbeen studied by a number of authors, such as Spink and Cool\ninvolved with the VT Department of Computer Science and\nthe UNC-CH School of Information and Library Science DL\nCurriculum Development project reported the progress with\nthe interdisciplinary curriculum development, experts opin-\nion about curriculum contents, and different related aspects.\nUsing email, surveys, and website analysis of LIS schools,\nSpink and Cool (1999) described the state of DL research\nincluding the state of the art in DL education worldwide. The\nauthors highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary DL\ncurriculum development to succeed in DL world.\nColeman (2002) reviewed studies related to education in\nDLs and curriculum planning from professional associations\nin LIS and CS. The author highlighted the importance of\ninterdisciplinary curriculum development.\nout an Internet survey on 42 schools offering a DL course\nworldwide, though the majority of schools analyzed were\nNorth American LIS schools. The author highlighted the\nimportance of practical DL courses in LIS schools. Ma et al.\n(2006) reported the status of DL education in the United\nStates, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Their findings\nindicated a well acceptance of DL courses in different LIS\nschools studied. Ma et al. (2006) also highlighted the impor-\ntance of designing a DL curriculum based on a combination\nof practical and theoretical knowledge.\nChoi and Rasmussen (2006) conducted a study on DL\npractitioners to understand what is needed to train future LIS\nprofessionals. The findings of their study emphasize the need\nfor technical, practical DLcourses in LIS schools. Isfandyari-\nMoghaddam and Bayat (2008), after reviewing studies by\nand Rasmussen (2006), and so forth, identified 21 skills that\nDL professionals need to work efficiently in DL world.\nBased on online questionnaires, Howard (2009) identified\nskills and knowledge required to work in a DL environment.\nShe found that skills such as communication, critical think-\ning, and the need to be flexible were required in the DL envi-\nronment. The participants of her study regarded user needs,\nmetadata, and copyright as highly desirable knowledge\nareas, whereas digital repositories and legal issues were con-\nsidered important issues to be covered in a DL education pro-\ngram by the participants of the study.\nBased on the opinions of Norwegian and Thai LIS educa-\ntors, Nonthacumjane (2010) identified the essential compe-\ntencies for DL professionals. The author reported a number\nof competencies a digital librarian requires to work in the\nDL world. Ratzek (2009), after examining the LIS programs\nin Germany, in the Nordic Countries, and the United\nKingdom, reported the availability of technology-based\ncourses, including digital document handling, library soft-\nware, information retrieval, and so forth, in the programs\nstudied. He thought that LIS schools in Europe are ready to\nface the digital challenges.\nKoltay and Boda (2008) carried out a study to explore the\nDL curriculum in Hungarian LIS schools. They identified the\nfollowing 15 DL curriculum elements: collection develop-\nment; historical studies; information retrieval and information\nseeking; information technology; metadata; interoperability;\ninterface design; legal issues; electronic publishing, scholarly\ncommunication; digitization; preservation; reference services;\nthe digital librarian; information literacy; and research.\n4 SAGE Open\nIn a study, Tammaro (2007) offered several broad models\nof DL courses:\n(1) technology as a tool for the building of digital libraries and\nthe courses'focus on technological infrastructure and processes;\n(2) digital libraries as environments concerned with the social\nand cultural contexts that digital libraries reside in;\n(3) the digital library as composed of objects with the main\nfocus on the management of the life-cycle of documents and\nartefacts in the digital environment; and\n(4) a combined model that includes different perspectives on the\nA workshop titled \"Coordinating EU-US Digital Library\nEducation\" was held in the United States at the UNC cam-\npus, in November 2008 to discuss the necessity and possibil-\nity of EU-U.S. coordination in DL education. A Strengths,\nWeaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis\nwas done by the workshop participants. A brief description\nof the SWOT analysis is given at the top of this page\nSadly, no further progress on the initiative was found.\nHowever, if the initiative had been successful, it would have\nbrought significant changes and progress in LIS education in\nEuropean LIS schools.\nRatzek (2009) concluded that \"there is a certain danger--\nespecially in the field of `libraries'--that librarians become\njob creators for computer scientists whereas the need for\nlibrarians is shrinking at the same time (e.g., in Germany)\"\n(p. 517). The author emphasized the importance of\nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in LIS\ncurriculum if future LIS professionals want to succeed in the\ndigital revolution.\nIn this brief literature review, the authors reviewed studies\nrelated to DL education, competencies required to work in new\ndigital world, recommended curriculum contents, and so on.\nThe need for practical curriculum contents has been high-\nlighted by the authors of various studies in DL education\nreviewed in this section. The authors contended that the\ncreation of interdisciplinary curriculum particularly with CS\nwould help LIS professionals prepare themselves for the future\ndigital world.An ideal DL curriculum should focus much more\non practical aspects. That being said, theoretical aspects of DLs\nas well as special focus on user behavior and user preferences\nshould also receive priority when designing DL curriculum.\nMethod\nBased on online surveys, this study examines the DL courses\nin European LIS schools, curriculum contents of DL courses,\nand its related areas.\nBryman (2008), one of the most prominent authors of\nsocial research methods, defines survey as\na cross-sectional design in relation to which data are collected\npredominantly by questionnaire or by structure interview on\nmore than one case (usually quite a lot more than one) and at a\nsingle point in time in order to collect quantitative and qualitative\ndata in connection with two or more variables (usually many\nmore than two), which are then examined to detect patterns of\nassociation. (p. 46)\nAccording to Burkell (2003), \"surveys are an excellent\nmethod of collecting information about the opinions and\nexperience of research participants. Surveys are among the\nmost widely used methods in LIS research\" (p. 239).\nA questionnaire consisting of both open and closed ques-\ntions was prepared for the study. Although to save the time of\nthe respondents and to analyze the data efficiently, the major-\nity of the questions were closed. This study obtained data\nthat are both qualitative and quantitative in nature.\nThree directories were used to identify the email addresses\nand websites of LIS schools in Europe:\n1.

British Association for Information and Library\nEducation and Research (BAILER) Members\nDirectory (available at http://www.bailer.ac.uk/mem-\nbership/member-directory/; for locating LIS schools/\ndepartments in the United Kingdom).\nThe authors identified 159 LIS schools in Europe from\nthese directories. The information on the LIS schools in the\nfollowing countries was not found in the IFLA and EUCLID\ndirectory: Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Cyprus, Former\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Georgia, Liechtenstein,\nLuxembourg, Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino, and Vatican\nCity State.\nOut of 49 European Countries, the authors identified infor-\nmation on LIS schools of 37 European countries. Therefore,\nthe LIS schools in 37 European countries were considered for\nthis study.\nIt was not feasible for the authors to visit even a single\nLIS school from each European country due to lack of time\nand limited funding; therefore, online surveys were suitable\nfor this type of study. Online questionnaires are economi-\ncally beneficial as they do not require a postal charge, paper\nand printing of questionnaires, or resending charge.\nMoreover, through online surveys, it is feasible to reach a\nwider audience that otherwise would not be possible due to\ndistance and other barriers. Most importantly, results of the\nonline surveys are easy to organize, edit, present, and publish\nreports. This study utilized the online survey tool QuestBack\n(http://www.questback.com), as it was subscribed by Oslo\nUniversity College, Norway (now Oslo and Akershus\nUniversity College of Applied Sciences).\nAn online questionnaire was designed to understand the\nstate of DL education in European LIS schools and to answer\nother research questions such as \"What is the direction of\nLIS curriculum?\" and \"Who are the competitors of LIS\nschools in the DL world?\" Using the facility at QuestBack,\nthe authors prepared two questionnaires with one question-\nnaire consisting of 26 questions for all European countries\nexcept the United Kingdom and Ireland, and the other one\nconsisting of 24 questions for the United Kingdom and\nIreland. Two questions, that is, \"Do you have a course in\nEnglish? If yes, please select whether English is used for\nindividual courses, a bachelor's level course, master's\ndegree, PhD,\" were omitted for the United Kingdom and\nIreland as the main language of these countries is English.\nThe online questionnaire used for the current study was\ndivided into following sections:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7  Demographic information\n\u00b7\n\u00b7  Digital library courses in LIS schools in Europe\n\u00b7\n\u00b7  Major contents of existing DL curriculum in Europe\n\u00b7\n\u00b7  Major reading materials as part of DL courses\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \nSubject preference of the respondents as part of DL\neducation\n\u00b7\n\u00b7  Priority of DL curriculum\n\u00b7\n\u00b7  Direction of LIS curriculum\n\u00b7\n\u00b7  Competitors of LIS schools in the DL world\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \nPerceptions of digital librarianship among the\nrespondents\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \nDefinition of DLs by the representative of the LIS\nschools in Europe.\nA pilot study was conducted on some International\nMaster in Digital Library Learning (DILL) professors in\nthree different countries and DILL students to check whether\nthe online system was functioning properly and to obtain\ncomments/suggestions about the questionnaire. Based on\nthe pilot study, revision was done on the questionnaire pre-\npared for the study.\nAll respondents of the current study were fully informed\nabout the purposes and expected benefits of the study.\nConfidentiality was ensured in this study. No personal iden-\ntifying data related to respondents, for example, email\naddress, designation, organization, were revealed. The\nrespondents were given the email addresses of the authors if\nthey required any further clarification or if they had any con-\ncerns about the study.\nUsing QuestBack online questionnaire facility, the authors\ndeadline for the submission of the questionnaire was April 5,\nThree reminder emails were sent to the heads of the 159 LIS\nschools in Europe.\nFindings of the Study\nOut of the 159 emails sent, the authors received 56 com-\npleted questionnaires. Of 56 questionnaires, two question-\nnaires were rejected as in one questionnaire it was clear that\nthe respondent misunderstood the questions and the other\nquestionnaire was incomplete (blank submission). As a\nresult, the total response for this study is 54 (33.96%) that\nrepresents 54 LIS schools/departments in 27 European coun-\ntries. The names of the universities and their corresponding\ncountries are presented in Appendix A.\nNot all questions were answered by all respondents.\nTherefore, the percentages were calculated on the basis of\nthe number of respondents who answered each question.\nRespondents' Background and Profiles of the LIS\nSchools in Europe that Participated in This Study\nMost of the heads of the LIS schools in Europe answered the\nquestionnaires by themselves. However, in a few cases, the\nheads of the schools forwarded the questionnaires to persons\nwho were in charge of DL courses or who were teaching\ndigital librarianship.\nAcademic positions and academic degrees of the respondents.\nOut of 54 LIS faculty members who participated in this\n6 SAGE Open\nstudy, the majority of the participants were professors (38,\n70.4%). Four respondents were associate professors, five\nwere assistant professors, and the three respondents indi-\ncated that they were lecturers. One respondent was senior\nlecturer, while three respondents did not indicate their aca-\ndemic position. The majority of the respondents, that is, 48\nNames of the degrees LIS schools in Europe are currently awarding.\nIt is important to know the degree awarding status of LIS\nschools in Europe. Therefore, one question was introduced to\nsee the existing degrees being awarded by LIS schools in\nEurope. Table 1 indicates the LIS degrees being awarded by the\nLIS schools in Europe that participated in the study.\nCourses in English. This question was asked to the representa-\ntives of the LIS schools except the LIS schools in the United\nKingdom and Ireland. Therefore, out of 54 LIS schools, 49\nwere given the question whether they have LIS courses in\nEnglish or not. Out of the 49 European LIS institutions, 47\nLIS schools responded to this question.\nTable 2 illustrates that the majority of the LIS schools\nparticipated in this study offer LIS courses in English in\naddition to the courses in their local languages. This ensures\nthe future possibility of internationalization in LIS schools\nin Europe and collaboration with LIS schools in other\ncountries.\nHow Is Digital Librarianship Integrated Into\nEducational Program?\nThe intention of asking the question was to identify the posi-\ntion of DL courses in the LIS curriculum. Do LIS schools\nhave special focus on digital librarianship? Does digital\nlibrarianship integrated into the curriculum? Or, do LIS\nschools have a separate degree on digital librarianship? The\nanswers to these questions are summarized in Table 3.\nIt is evident in Table 3 that the majority of the European\nLIS schools, that is, 43 (80%), integrated the concepts of\nDLs into their bachelor's and master's degrees. This indi-\ncates the positive integration of the concept of DLs into the\nLIS curriculum in Europe. The majority of the LIS schools\nin Europe have realized the importance of having DLs in the\ncurriculum and integrated the concept. Therefore, it is evi-\ndent that LIS schools in Europe are moving toward the right\ndirection. Moreover, 9 (17%) LIS schools were offering\nseparate degree programs in DLs. From the data set, the\nauthors found that one LIS school each in Croatia, Estonia,\nItaly, Norway, and Sweden, two LIS schools in Spain, and\ntwo LIS schools in the United Kingdom were offering sepa-\nrate degree programs in DLs. LIS schools in Estonia, Italy,\nand Norway were part of the Erasmus Mundus program\nnamed International Master in Digital Library Learning.\nHowever, out of 54 LIS schools, 8 (15%) schools had no\nspecial focus on DLs. Although the concept of DLs and its\nrelated areas are now considered as one of the core concepts\nof librarianship, there are LIS schools which are still unable\nto properly integrate the emerging concepts of digital librar-\nianship. Research is needed to identify why LIS schools are\nunable to integrate emerging LIS concepts in the age of\ncomputers.\nMajor DL Topics and DL Education Subject\nPreference\nEurope consists of different countries having different offi-\ncial languages. It would not be virtually possible for the\nauthors to translate the course contents of LIS schools nor be\npossible for the respondents of the study to translate their\ncurriculum into English for the purpose of this study. To\nmake things easier for the respondents and to serve the pur-\npose of the current study, respondents were asked to write\nthree major areas/topics of DL courses present in their cur-\nriculum. Out of 54 respondents, 45 respondents wrote the\nmajor contents of the DL courses. For the purpose of under-\nstanding the major contents of the DL courses and for clarity,\nthe authors organized the major contents of DL courses on\nTable 1.

Thirteen major topics of DL courses are\nillustrated in Figure 1.\nAs evident in Figure 1, the highest ranking DL topic in the\nDL course curriculum in Europe is \"definition, history and\ndevelopment of DL.\" It is mentioned 15 times by respon-\ndents of the current study. Second top topics of DL courses\nare \"access and usage of DL\" and \"DL software.\" They are\nmentioned 14 times each. Third top position is taken by three\nareas \"digitization and preservation,\" \"metadata,\" and\n\"development and management of DL.\" In terms of the num-\nber of respondents who mentioned topics, \"DL collection\nbuilding and management\" and \"DL usability and interface\"\nreceived the fourth position. Copyright and intellectual prop-\nerty right issues are very important in DL environment. This\nalong with other content areas, that is, \"design and evalua-\ntion of DL,\" \"information architecture,\" \"role of DL in soci-\nety,\" and \"DL standard\" are placed in the fifth position.\nSurprisingly, information architecture, social role of DLs,\nand design and evaluation are ranked so low. These are top-\nics of strategic importance. The five top ranked areas pre-\nsented in this study are also present in different sections of\nthe DL curriculum developed by VT and the UNC-CH, USA.\nA careful analysis of the DL course contents mentioned\nby the respondents of the current study indicates that there is\nno single topic that everyone mentioned. This is an indica-\ntion of diverse areas taught as part of DL courses in European\nLIS schools. Research is needed to examine the curriculum\ncontents of DL courses offered at different LIS schools in\nEurope in much more detail and to see whether LIS curricula\nin particular DL-related curricula are diverse or there are\nsome areas where the majority of LIS schools have similar\nconcentrations.\nThe respondents of the current study were given 24 sub-\njects areas and asked to rate the importance of these subject\nareas based on their importance in DL education/courses.\nTable 4 presents the DL education/courses areas ranked on\nthe basis of their importance as indicated by the respondents.\nThe list of these 24 areas was developed on the basis the cur-\nriculum of DILL, Digital Library Curriculum Project of VT\nand the UNC-CH, DL curriculum of LIS schools in North\nAmerica, and in consultation with professors at DILL.\nAs evident in Table 4, out of 54 respondents 53 respon-\ndents rated most of the subjects mentioned in the table.\nHowever, the subject Internet Studies was rated by 49\nrespondents. Some subjects were rated by 52 respondents.\nFour subject areas \"digital library architecture and design,\"\n\"information retrieval,\" \"digital archiving,\" and \"electronic\ncollection and resources development\" were considered\nextremely important and very important by the respondents\nof the current study in terms of their importance to DL edu-\ncation.Although the topic architecture and design (see Figure\n1) was ranked low in major contents of DL education in\nEurope, in terms of its importance, it is one of the top impor-\ntant subject areas for DL curriculum. LIS educators and cur-\nriculum developers can keep in mind the top ranked 10\nsubject areas indicated by the respondents of the study when\ndesigning separate DL program or developing DL courses in\ntheir departments/schools.\nCore Reading in DL Education in Europe\nThe respondents of the current study were asked to write the\nnames of two books and three journals in DLs they would\nrecommend. The intention was to investigate the core books\nand journals in DLs in Europe. The answers to these ques-\ntions are presented as follows.\nBooks.Out of 54 respondents, 33 respondents wrote the\nnames of books in DLs they would recommend. There is a\ntendency among participants of any study to avoid open-\nended questions due to several factors including time required\nto answer open-ended questions. As indicated in Table 5,\nnational textbooks on DLs were mentioned by 10 respondents\nFigure 1. Thirteen topics ranked in five.\nNote. DL = digital library.\n8 SAGE Open\nof the study. The national textbooks on DLs were mentioned\nby respondents from Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Hungary,\nPortugal, Poland, and Russia. This is reasonable as Europe\nconsists of several countries with different languages than\nEnglish. Not all LIS schools will follow English books.\nRather for greater understanding of emerging academic areas,\nsome students would prefer to read books in their native lan-\nguages. The result on recommended books on DLs also\nindicates the importance of local DL books in some European\ncountries. As we know, publishers usually publish books in\nsubject areas that are in high demands and are profitable. The\nauthors do not know whether the books were published by\nlocal publishers or by authors but the authors assume that\nhigh demands for the books in DLs resulted in local book\npublication. The results in this section also indicate the fast\ngrowing reliability and dependency on national textbooks.\nTable 4.

This\nindicates a growing reliability and dependency on the\nnational textbooks published in different countries and in\ndifferent languages. This also indicates the importance of\nthe DL aspects at the national level. It is logical to think that\nthe books written in national languages might be based on\nthe popular international books on DLs. This study clearly\nindicates the fact that there are good numbers of books on\nDLs published in different languages and in different\nEuropean countries.\nThe authors listed the recommended local books in DLs\nunder National Textbooks and listed all English books indi-\nvidually on the basis of the number of times they were men-\ntioned by the respondents. Table 5 illustrates the list of eight\nbooks ranked in fifth position as recommended books in DL\neducation with their numbers of occurrences. Other books\nrecommended by the LIS faculty members of European LIS\nschools are presented in Appendix B.\nWhile analyzing the data on textbooks on DL education,\nPractical Digital Libraries: Books, Bytes and Bucks was the\nmost popular and found in the syllabi of seven schools. A\nbook by Borgman (2000) titled From Gutenberg to the\nGlobal Information Structure: Access to Information in the\nNetworked world and Arms's (2000) Digital Libraries are\nsecond and third, respectively, most popular in courses on\nDL. William Y. Arms's book titled Digital Libraries was rec-\nommended by the second highest number of respondents of\nthe current study, which was in third position in Liu's find-\nings. It is clear that Borgman's book titled From Gutenberg\nto the Global Information Structure: Access to Information\nin the Networked World took second position in Liu's study\nand third position in the current study.\nA similar study was conducted by Pomerantz et al. in\n2006. In their article, they listed the five most frequently\nassigned books in DL courses. These were as follows:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Witten, I. H., & Bainbridge, D. (2003). How to build a\ndigital library.

London, England:\nFacet.\nAll these books were also mentioned by the respondents\nof the current study as recommended books on digital\nlibrarianship and placed in among the five top recommended\nbooks. Therefore, it can be said that faculty members of\nEuropean LIS schools are aware of popular books in DL.\nHowever, the answer to the question whether there are any\nbooks on DLs that might be considered as core books and\nrecommended by the majority of the respondents of the cur-\nrent study is \"No.\" There was no book on DLs that was rec-\nommended by the majority of the respondents. But there\nwere some international books that were popular and recom-\nmended by a number of respondents.\nOne of the very prominent faculty members in the field of\ndigital librarianship and head of a LIS school in Europe\nthinks that scholarly discourse of DLs is in journal articles.\nIn his words, \"There are really no books on digital libraries\nthat I recommend. The scholarly discourse is entirely in jour-\nnal articles. Bill Arms old book on digital libraries is still\nuseful, though.\"\nAnother respondent also wrote about suggesting students\nto analyze journal articles instead of books. Another respon-\ndent wrote, \"No particular recommendation, would direct\nstudents to current listings like Facet Publishing (London),\nAshgate, Chandos.\" These are undoubtedly good approaches\nof directing students to the current listing and journals. As a\nresult, students would be able to know the current trends,\npublication in the field of their study, and be updated always\nwith the development in their field of studies.\nJournals.Thirty-five respondents wrote the names of the\njournals in DLs they would recommend. The result was quite\ninteresting. They wrote the names of several journals they\nconsider worthy for studies on DLs. Table 6 shows the list of\njournals recommended by the European faculty members for\nDL course.\nAs evident in Table 6, D-Lib Magazine was mentioned\nby the highest numbers of respondents. D-Lib Magazine is\nan electronic publication with a focus on DL research and\ndevelopment, including new technologies, applications,\nand contextual social and economic issues. After D-Lib,\nthe second position was taken by national journals recom-\nmended by respondents from Croatia, Czech Republic,\nHungary, Italy, Poland, and Spain. Like national textbooks,\nthis again indicates the availability of local journals that\ncover DL aspects as well as the reliability and dependency\nof the European faculty members on the national journals\npublished in their native languages. Library Hi Tech was in\nthird position. Fourth position was taken by International\nJournal on Digital Libraries. Fifth position was taken by\njournal The Electronic Library. Journal of the American\nSociety for Information Science and Technology (JASIST;\nnow Journal of the Association for Information Science\nand Technology) and Ariadne jointly took the sixth posi-\ntion. Journal of Documentation (JDoc) was in seventh\nposition. New Library and Information Processing &\nManagement are jointly in eighth position. Other nine\njournals are in ninth position.\nInterestingly, the top five journals are journals with a low\nimpact. In the Norwegian and Danish incentive system for\nscientific publishing, journals are grouped in two categories,\n1 and 2. Category 1 consists of low-impact journals, whereas\nCategory 2 consists of the most prestigious journals. Not\nmore than 20% of the journals in a given field (e.g., LIS) can\nbe in Category 2. In LIS, journals such as JASIST, Information\nProcessing & Management, and JDoc are in Category 2;\nthey are all below top 5 in our ranking. The top 5 are all in\nCategory 1.\nPomerantz et al. (2006) analyzing the curriculum of DL\ncourse identified 121 journals. Out of that, they listed top 13\nmost frequently assigned journals in DL courses. Among the\n13 journals listed by Pomerantz et al. (2006), respondents of\ncurrent study recommended eight journals. D-Lib Magazine\nis in the top position for both the current study and the study\nthe core journals on digital libraries include College & Research\nLibraries, Communications of the ACM, Electronic Library,\nInformation Processing and Management, Information\nTechnology and Libraries, the Journal of the American Society\nfor Information Science and Technology, Library Trends, and\nOnline Information Review. Bearman thinks that the\nInternational Journal on Digital Libraries has served as a venue\nfor important articles from time to time. (p. 225, para. 2)\nThe respondents of the current study recommended five out\nof nine core journals mentioned by Bearman.\nOne observation that is evident in the current study is that\nthere was no single journal on digital librarianship that was\nrecommended by a majority of the European LIS faculty\nmembers. Except for D-Lib, most of the journals were rec-\nommended by few respondents. However, there was also a\nclear indication of the increasing dependency on national\njournals on digital librarianship.\nPractical Aspects Versus Theoretical Aspects\nWhile designing a DL curriculum, we can choose between\ngiving priority to practical aspects or to theoretical\naspects. Usually, DL courses conducted by CS and engi-\nneering faculty are composed of more practical aspects\nthan theoretical aspects. It is evident in the Association for\nComputing Machinery (ACM) and Institute of Electrical\nand Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Computing Curricula\n2001 that there is one elective course on DL that mainly\nfocuses on the practical aspects of DLs. DL courses\noffered by LIS schools tend to concentrate more on theo-\nretical aspects than practical. It is important to see the\npreferences of European LIS faculty members regarding\nDL course curricula. Do they prefer more practical aspects\nor do they prefer theoretical aspects? Their preferences\nare illustrated in Figure 2.\nAs shown in Figure 2, the question on practical aspects or\ntheoretical aspects was answered by 51 respondents out of 54.\nIf the faculty members were given the option to choose only\none aspect either practical or theoretical, 32 (63%) respon-\ndents would choose practical aspects, whereas 19 (37%)\nrespondents would choose theoretical aspects. This result\nindicates the importance of practical aspects in DL courses\nand gives us direction for developing DLcurricula. Liu (2004)\nconcluded,\nas the whole area of digital libraries is presently growing at a\nfantastic rate, those students who have received practical\nexperience with digital libraries, such as those provided in the\n\"hands-on\" courses, appear to be the best served for future\npractice in the field of librarianship. (p. 67)\nFigure 2. Practical aspects versus theoretical aspects.\nTable 6. Recommended Journals for DL Education.\nS.\nno. Name Value\n2.

(2006), many attendees of Joint\nConference on Digital Libraries (JCDL '05) workshop on\nDL education were strongly in favor of integrating hands-on\ntraining in working DLs as part of the curriculum, although\nothers proposed a hybrid curriculum to bring together\nstrengths from diverse departments. The preference of prac-\ntical aspects in DL curriculum by the faculty members of the\nLIS schools who participated in this study is noticeable in the\nDL education subject area preferences (see Table 4).\nDirection of LIS Curriculum\nIt is evident in the recent curriculum of LIS that it comprises\na number of subject areas that originated from CS, media and\ncommunication, management, and so forth. After the emer-\ngence of web technologies and new model of information\nmanagement and services and evolution of DLs, LIS curri-\ncula integrated a great deal of subject contents from CS.\nRecent influence of various subjects on LIS curriculum is\nevident in the curricula of LIS schools around the globe.\nIt is time to think the future directions of LIS curricula.\nAre we moving toward CS, management science, social sci-\nence, or cultural science? Influences of other disciplines on\nLIS curricula are obvious. A question was asked to acquire\nthe opinion of the European LIS faculty members about the\nfuture direction of LIS curriculum in this study. Out of 54\nrespondents, 52 respondents indicated their opinion.\nFigure 3 illustrates the future direction of LIS curricula\naccording to the opinion of faculty members of the LIS\nschools in Europe who participated in this study.\nof the opinion that LIS curricula are moving toward CS. This\nmeans that the majority of the LIS faculty members agree with\nthe fact that DL is drawing LIS/information science (LIS/IS)\ncurricula in the direction of CS and engineering. If we exam-\nine the current LIS curricula in different LIS schools around\nthe world, we will surely find that LIS schools have already\nintegrated several courses that originated from CS. Out of 52\nrespondents, 35 (67%) respondents thought that the direction\nof LIS curricula is management science. Knowledge manage-\nment and other aspects of management related to library and\ninformation centers are already present in LIS curricula of dif-\nferent LIS schools. Twenty-four respondents (46%) were of\nthe opinion that DL is drawing LIS/IS curriculum in the direc-\ntion of social science and only 14 (27%) respondents were of\nthe opinion that DL is drawing LIS/IS curriculum in the direc-\ntion of cultural science.\nThe result of the direction of LIS curricula indicates two\nobvious future directions of LIS curricula. Future LIS curri-\ncula will reasonably be directed toward CS and engineering\nas well as management science. Presumably, LIS curricula\nwill be influenced by many subject areas in future, some of\nwhich may have not emerged yet. Robot technology, space\nscience, and satellite technology may have future influence\non LIS curriculum. In future, the LIS discipline will focus\nmore on technology than any other thing. Libraries and LIS\ndiscipline will never disappear. Instead, the LIS discipline\nwill marry many subject areas to ensure its presence in the\nfuture information world. LIS discipline will be shaped and\nreshaped according to the demands of the world.\nDigital Librarianship\nOne question was introduced to see how European LIS faculty\nmembers considered digital librarianship. Is digital librarian-\nship the librarianship in the digital age or is it a separate emerg-\ning discipline distinct from librarianship or is it a mixture of\nboth? The answers to the question are presented in Table 7.\nFigure 3. Direction of LIS curriculum.\nNote. Multiple responses allowed. LIS = library and information science.\nThe majority of the European LIS faculty members, that\nis, 34 (63%) participants in this study, considered \"digital\nlibrarianship\" as a mixture of librarianship in the digital age\nand a separate emerging discipline. Out of 54 respondents,\n18 (33%) respondents considered it \"Librarianship in the\nDigital Age\" and two (4%) respondents considered it as a\nseparate emerging discipline distinct from librarianship.\nLIS professionals, researchers, and library thinkers are not\nin a position to argue that DLs and digital librarianship are\ncompletely librarianship in the digital age and the sole prod-\nuct of the library field, nor can they say that they are a com-\npletely separate discipline, distinct from librarianship. In one\nsense, digital librarianship is librarianship in the digital age,\nand in another sense, digital librarianship is a separate emerg-\ning discipline developing with the support of mainly CS peo-\nple. DL curricula in LIS schools on one hand include digital\nethics, user behaviors, digital literacy, freedom of information\nas well as other areas derived from traditional librarianship.\nOn the other hand, DL curricula include database manage-\nment, software programming, web design, and other areas\nderived from CS. Therefore, digital librarianship is a mixture\nof both librarianship and separate emerging discipline.\nCompetitors of LIS Schools in DL World\nYang, Wildemuth, Pomerantz, Oh, and Fox (2009) noted that\nseveral disciplines have an interest in the development of a\ngraduate-level curriculum for DL education. Most DL\ncourses have been taught either in LIS or CS programs (Ma\net al., 2009). A question was asked to the European LIS fac-\nulty to identify the competitors of LIS schools in the case of\nDL course offering. In this question, three kinds of schools\nwere specified as potential competitors of LIS schools in the\nDL world. These were \"computer science and engineering\n(CSE) schools,\" \"management science and business schools,\"\nand \"communications and media schools.\" The respondents\nwere given five options to select from, namely, (a) very\nstrong competitor, (b) strong competitor, (c) competitor, (d)\nnot strong competitor, and (e) not competitor at all.\nThe authors combined the very strong competitor, strong\ncompetitor, and competitor ratings of the respondents to\nidentify the true competitors of LIS schools in DL world.\nTable 8 presents competitors of LIS schools in the DL world.\nTable 8 shows that the majority of LIS faculty members,\nthat is, 42 (78%), considered CSE schools as the greatest\ncompetitors of LIS schools in DL world, while second high-\nest numbers of respondents, that is, 40 (70%), considered\ncommunications and media schools as competitors of the\nrespondents considered management science and business\nschools as competitors of LIS schools in the DL world.\nRatzek (2009) thought that \"there is a certain danger-\nespecially in the field of `libraries'that librarians become job\ncreators for computer scientist whereas the need for librarian\nis shrinking at the same time (e.g., in Germany)\" (p. 517).\nWill the competitors of LIS schools grab the LIS discipline?\nWill LIS discipline become unnecessary for the future informa-\ntion world? What should we do to secure our discipline for the\nfuture competitive academic world? LIS faculty members\nshould keep these questions in mind and should design the LIS\ncurriculum in a way that meets the requirements of the new\nmarket and include the necessary knowledge and skills to be\nvery competent in the future information world.\nFuture Research Directions\nA separate study to explore the DL curriculum/courses in the\nCS schools of European countries may be conducted using\nthe methodologies and questionnaire used for the current\nstudy. Comparative studies of trends and state of the art in DL\neducation in the Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Northern\nEurope, and Southern Europe might also be conducted fol-\nlowing the same methodologies applied to this study.\nAstudy to assess the European DL practitioners'preferences\nabout DL course contents is a very important research area that\nshould be considered by the researchers in DLarena to know the\nskills and knowledge required in the DL world. An in-depth\nfocus group study with the DLresearchers and faculty members\nis also feasible to find out their perceptions, choice, and other\nrelated issues in relation to DL. Studies on DLeducation\u00adrelated\naspects in other regions and countries in the world may follow\nthe methodologies and research problems and related things like\nthe current study in conducting a similar type of study. For\nexample, a similar type of study to explore the state of the art in\nDLeducation in SouthAsian,Arabian, orAfrican countries may\neasily be conducted using the methodologies used for the cur-\nrent study with necessary modifications.\nA separate study to explore the DL curriculum in the CSE\nschools of European countries may be conducted using the\nmethodologies and questionnaire used for the current study.\nTable 7.

Multiple responses were allowed. LIS = library and information\nscience; DL = digital library; CSE = computer science and engineering.\nAudunson and Shuva 13\nA separate comprehensive study that focuses on the DL cur-\nriculum contents of the LIS schools is worth conducting. A\ncomparative study of trends and state of the art in DL educa-\ntion in Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Northern Europe,\nand Southern Europe might also be conducted following the\nsame methodologies applied to this study.\nA collaborative study is warranted in European context.\nResearchers from different European countries can conduct\nstudies to examine LIS education, particularly DL education\nin various European countries. For example, researchers\nfrom Baltic countries can collaborate with researchers from\nNordic countries to report the LIS education in Baltic and\nNordic countries. A separate study can also be conducted to\nexplore the perceptions of LIS education among the LIS fac-\nulty members in European countries. What is the future of\nLIS education? What is the direction of LIS education in\nEurope? What are the important subject areas LIS schools\nshould integrate into their curricula? What should be done to\nsecure the position of LIS in the future information world?\nA web content analysis of LIS courses, programs, and\nresearch concentrations can be done to assess the status of\nLIS schools in Europe and their research areas. What are the\nkey courses that LIS schools in Europe are offering? Are\nthere any core courses that are offered by the LIS schools in\nEurope? What are the research concentrations of LIS schools\nin Europe? Are LIS schools in Europe different in terms of\nresearch concentration? Is there any regional or local influ-\nence on research concentration? For example, Nordic coun-\ntries may have special concentration or interest in conducting\nresearch about them or in areas that benefit them.\nA separate study, utilizing qualitative interview tech-\nniques, can be conducted to obtain the perceptions of LIS\neducation in Europe among the prominent LIS scholars, aca-\ndemics, and leaders of professional associations in Europe.\nWhat is the status of LIS education in Europe? What should\nbe done to increase internationalization of LIS education in\nEurope? What should be done to develop joint LIS pro-\ngrams? What is the future of LIS education in Europe? What\nshould be done to improve the status of LIS education in\nEurope and to produce future qualified information profes-\nsionals? What role can LIS associations play to increase the\ncollaboration and cooperation among LIS schools and to\ndevelop a standardized LIS curriculum across Europe?\nA study can be conducted to explore the outcome of DILL\nor other DL courses offered at various European LIS schools.\nWhat are the job status/positions of students of DILL course?\nAre they working in the DL sector? Does DILL help them\ngetting a decent job? Do they face any problem working in\nthe DL world? Does the curriculum of DILL match with the\npractical needs of DLs? Do they have any recommendation\nfor future improvement of the course?\nA study to explore the internationalization of LIS educa-\ntion in Europe would be worth taking. What is the current\nstate of internationalization at various LIS schools in Europe?\nDo they offer English courses at different program levels? Do\nthey have English websites? Do they have English version of\ntheir curricula? How many international students do they\nadmit each year? Do they have any collaborative master's or\ndoctoral programs with European LIS schools and with inter-\nnational LIS schools? What is the current faculty strength of\nLIS schools in Europe? How many of them have PhD from\nforeign countries? How many of them are experts in emerg-\ning LIS areas including DLs, digital humanities, and so on?\nHow many of them can teach in English? This study can be\nconducted with the help of the heads/directors of the LIS\nschools in Europe. A questionnaire can be prepared and sent\nto the representatives of LIS schools in Europe for their input.\nConclusion\nThis study has attempted to fill some gaps in research on DL\neducation and related areas in Europe. The study reports the\nexisting curriculum contents of surveyed European LIS schools\nand the preferences of DL curriculum among the faculty mem-\nbers who participated in this study. It is found that the majority\nof the LIS schools in Europe that participated in this study have\nalready integrated the DLconcepts in their curricula. Moreover,\nnearly 20% of LIS schools indicated that they have separate DL\ndegree program. The DL course contents of the LIS schools in\nEurope are diverse and the importance of practical DL course\ncontents has been highlighted by the participants of the study.\nThe study also reports the growth of national textbooks on\nDLs and the importance of national level journals for DL\ncourses in a number of LIS schools in Europe. Although a\nnumber of English textbooks and journals were recommended\nby a number of faculty members for DL courses, the study did\nnot find any core DL textbooks and journals for DL courses.\nBased on the results, the study finds a number of directions\nfor the LIS curricula. Two obvious directions for LIS curricula\nwould be moving toward CS and engineering as well as man-\nagement. Moreover, nearly 50% of European faculty members\nwho participated in this study think that LIS curricula are\nmoving toward social science. The study asserts that in future,\nLIS curricula will take different directions to meet the demands\nof the time and the profession. Presumably, modern technolo-\ngies will have high influence on LIS curricula. The need for\ncollaboration among different discipline has also been high-\nlighted in this study. Based on the results obtained, the authors\ncontend that the future LIS education will consist of more of\ncollaborative programs with several disciplines including CS,\nmanagement, culture science, and so on. The study also\nemphasizes the need for Europe-wide DL/LIS curriculum.\nThe authors expect that the results obtained as part of this\nstudy will be of interest to DL researchers, educationalists,\nand policy makers in European countries as well as around\nthe world. The authors also expect that the study will contrib-\nute to the discussions and debates toward identifying subject\nelements for DL courses. The top subject areas (see Table 4)\nbased on their importance as reported by the participants of\nthe current study should be taken into consideration before\ndesigning curricula for DLs and before developing a Europe-\nwide unique LIS curriculum.\nAppendix A\nList of Universities That Participated in This Study.\nCountry No. Name of the university\nAustria 1 University of Graz\nBosnia and Herzegovina 1 University of Sarajevo\nBulgaria 1 St. Kliment Ohridski University of Sofia\nCroatia\n\n\n3 University of Zagreb\nUniversity of Osijek\nUniversity of Zadar\nCzech Republic 1 Silesian University in Opava\nEstonia 1 Tallinn University\nFinland\n\n2 \u00c5bo Akademi\nUniversity of Tampere\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n5 HAW Hamburg\nFachhochschule Hannover\nJohannes Gutenberg University Mainz (D)\nHumboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin\nHochschule Darmstadt\nGreece 2 Ionian University\n Technological Education Institute of Thessaloniki\nHungary\n\n\n3 Kaposv\u00e1r University\nSzeged University\nUniversity of Szeged\nIceland 1 Iceland University\nItaly 1 University of Parma\nLatvia 1 University of Latvia\nMalta 1 University of Malta\nMoldova 1 Moldova State University\nNetherlands\n\n\n\n4 University of Urbino\nSaxion University of Applied Sciences\nHogeschool van Amsterdam, University of Applied Sciences\nHanze University\nNorway 2 Oslo University College\nUniversity of Troms\u00f8\nPoland\n\n\n\n4 Jagioellonian University, Krak\u00f3w\nUniversity Maria Curie Sklodowska, Lublin\nUMK (Nicolaus Copernicus University)\nAdam Mickiewicz University\nPortugal 1 University of Porto\nRussia 1 Chelyabinsk State Academy of Culture and Arts\nSerbia 1 University of Belgrade\nSlovakia 1 Comenius University\nSlovenia 1 University of Ljubljana\nSpain 4 University of Le\u00f3n\nUniversity of Barcelona\nUniversity Carlos III of Madrid\nUniversidade da Coru\u00f1a\nSweden 3 Linnaeus University\nUppsala University\nUniversity of Bor\u00e5s\nTurkey 2 Hacettepe University\nIstanbul University\nUnited Kingdom\n\n\n\n\n5 City University London\nRobert Gordon University, Aberdeen\nUniversity of Brighton\nUniversity of West London (former Thames Valley University)\nUniversity of Sheffield\nAudunson and Shuva 15\nAppendix B\nOther Recommended Books in DL Education.\nTitle of the book Author/editor (n = 33)\nBuilding Digital Libraries: A How-to-Do-It Manual Terry Reese and Kyle Banerjee 02\nScholarship in the Digital Age: Christine L. 02\nInformation, Infrastructure and the Internet Borgman \nDL Economics David Baker and Wendy Evans 01\nDL Futures Verheul, de Gruyter 01\nPreserving Digital Information Henry Gladney 01\nThe Library in the 21st Century Peter Brophy 01\nInformation Society Robert Hassan 01\nE-books in Libraries: A Practical Guide Kate Price and Virginia Havergal (Editors) 01\nM-libraries Mohamed Ally and Gill Needham (Editors) 01\nUniversity Libraries and Digital Penny Dale and Jill 01\nLearning Environments Beard (Editors) \nUse and Users of Electronic Library Resources: An Overview and\nAnalysis of Recent Research Studies\nScholarly Publishing: Books, Journals, Publishers, and Libraries in\nthe Twentieth Century\nSemantic Digital Libraries Sebastian Ryszard Kruk and Bill McDaniel (Editors) 01\nDigital Agenda for Europe: Digital Libraries Initiative http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/\ndigital_libraries\nDigital Libraries: Policy, Planning and Practice Judith Andrews (Editor) 01\nDL Development Marcum and George 01\nBusiness Planning for Digital Libraries Mel Collier (Editor) 01\nTagging: People-Powered Metadata for the Social Web Gene Smith 01\nThe Handbook of Internet Studies Mia Consalvo and Charles Ess (Editors) 01\nDigital Libraries: High School Textbook Shraiberg Yakov 01\nNote.
