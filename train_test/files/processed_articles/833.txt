The interviewer\nread the following: \"In deciding how much of their\nfamily income to spend or save, people are likely to\nthink about different financial planning periods. In\nplanning your (family's) savings and spending, which\nof the time periods listed in the booklet is most\nimportant to you [and your husband/wife/partner]?\n1. Next few months; 2. Next year; 3. Next few years;\nPersons responding with next few years, next five to\n10 years, or longer than 10 years were termed as\nhaving \"long time horizons.\" More whites than\nblacks in the survey have long time horizons. Al-\nthough 80.6% of whites responded that their plan-\nning horizon exceeded the next year, only 67.3% of\nblacks did. A similar racial gap in planning horizon\nexisted even for homeowners. Although 83.2% of\nwhite homeowners responded that their planning\nhorizon exceeded one year, only 73.8% of blacks did.\nBoth of these disparities are statistically significant.\nCognitive Skills. -- Finally, the data set includes a\nproxy for cognitive skill. The specific construction of\nthis variable is the following. On one question focus-\ning on analogies, the interviewer asks: \"In what way\nare ... an orange and a banana alike . . . a table and a\nchair... an eye and an ear... an egg and a seed . . .\nair and water . . . a fly and a tree . . . praise and\npunishment?\" Scores were given in the following\nmanner: 0, No points; incorrect answer; don't\nknow, inappropriate; 1, partial credit; 2, full credit;\n7, scorer not sure of score; 9, refused to answer.\nScores of 7 and 9 were collapsed to zero. Thus, the\nfull range of total scores was from 0 to 14. This\nconstituted the first part of the measure.\nA second part of the measure captures memory.\nThe interviewer states: \"Next, I'll read a list of 20\nwords and ask you to recall as many as you can. We\nhave purposely made the list long so that it will be\ndifficult for anyone to recall all the words -- most\npeople recall just a few. Please listen carefully as I\nread the set of words. When I finish, I will ask you to\nrecall aloud as many of the words as you can, in any\norder.\" The words on the list are lake, door, coffee,\ncar, mountain, steam, army, pipe, cat, forest, plant,\nwinter, ticket, bird, ship, city, corn, dust, cabin, iron.\nAfter several other questions are asked, the inter-\nviewer returns to this question and says: \"A little\nwhile ago, I read you a list of words and you repeated\nthe ones you could remember. Please tell me any of\nthe words you remember now.\" The words are now\nin alphabetical order. Respondents receive one point\nfor each correct word remembered. The total possi-\nble score for this section is 20.\nOur constructed score is the average of these two\nscores. The highest possible score, therefore, is 17.\nThere are substantial disparities in this score be-\ntween blacks and whites. The highest score for\nwhites was more than 30% higher than the highest\nscore recorded for blacks. The average score for\nwhites exceeded that for blacks by 50%. Among\nhome owners the gap is slightly smaller but remains\nsubstantial. The average white score among home-\nowners is 6.065, while the score for black homeown-\ners is 4.448. The average scores from the analogy and\nmemory tests for white homeowners are 6.523 and\n5.606, while the scores for black homeowners are\nference in cognitive score between blacks and\nwhites is due to the analogy part than the memory\nportion. Even at the highest family income quintiles,\nthere remains a significant gap in the scores. As Table\n4 reveals, although the racial gap is narrower at the\ntop than it is at the bottom of the income distribution\n-- 19% vs 54% -- these statistically significant gaps\npersist across the entire income distribution.\nTogether, then, these variables reveal sizable dif-\nferences in the characteristics of black and white\npreretirement householders. Do these differences\n\"explain\" the unequal home ownership probabilities\nand/or the unequal home equity? We now turn to a\nmodel designed to address that question.\nA Model of Expected Home Equity\nLet Pw and PB be the probabilities of home owner-\nship for whites and blacks, respectively. Let Y\nTM and YB\nbe the home equity or the difference in home market\nvalue and housing debt for white and black home-\nowners. The expected home equity for group m,\nthen, is given by E(Ym) = Pm\u00bbYm + (1 - Pm)\u00ab0, where\n- ( 2 a,mX,m)\nand\nHere, u, is assumed to have a logistic distribution and\n, given home ownership, is assumed to have a\nnormal distribution with other basic assumptions\nrequired to the nonlinear least squares estimation.\nThe product of the probability of home ownership\nand the home equity, given that one owns a home, is\nthe expected home equity.\nFactors affecting home ownership and home eq-\nuity are financial, demographic, and place specific.\nFinancial factors include attitudes toward risk, finan-\ncial planning horizon, and family income. Demo-\ngraphic factors include marital status, age, educa-\ntion, and dependents. Place-specific factors include\nregion of residence. Maximum likelihood and non-\nlinear least squares methods can be used to estimate\nthe coefficients in logistic and exponential equations\nseparately for blacks and whites (see Appendix, Note\nTable 4.

Armed with these separate sets of coefficient\nestimates, one can decompose the racial disparity in\nexpected home equity.\nAn Approximate Decomposition\nThe disparity between white and black expected\nhome ownership can be approximately decomposed\ninto portions due to unequal financial, demographic,\nand place-specific factors and a component not ex-\nplained by such factors. For want of a better term,\nthis \"unexplained\" portion is called the \"discrimina-\ntory\" gap. The actual gap in expected home equity\nbetween whites and blacks is given by:\nE(YW) - E(YB) = PWYW - PBYB. (2)\nConsider what the expected home equity for blacks\nwould be if blacks were \"treated like\" whites. A\n\"discriminatory-free\" value of the expected home\nequity for blacks is as follows:\nE(YB) =\nB =\nexpffi\n1 + exp-(X c\nNote that the a's and |3's above are the coefficients of\nthe home ownership and home equity equations\nestimated for white households. Then, an approxi-\nmate decomposition of the gross racial difference in\nexpected home equity would be:\nE(YW) - E(YB) = [E(YB) - E(YB)] + [E(YW) - E(YB)], (4)\nwhere the first term in brackets is the difference in\nexpected home equity due to racial differences in the\ncoefficients determining home ownership and home\nequity and the second term is the difference due to\ndifferences in characteristics of white and black\nhouseholds. The proportion of the gross difference\ndue to unequal coefficients, or the \"discriminatory\"\ndifference, is:\nE(YB) - E(YB)\nE(YW) - E(YB)\nThis is only an approximation, of course, because the\nexpected values of home equity are not linear func-\ntions of the independent variables, and thus E(YW -\nE(YB) is not a linear difference in expected home\nequity due to differences in X's. For example, when\nhome ownership probabilities are identical for\nblacks and whites and equal to 1, then E(YW) - E(YB) is\nequal to:\nexp(X &%\") - exp(X PW), (6)\nwhich does not lend itself to a simple interpretation.\nHowever, if we divide this difference by the \"dis-\ncrimination-free\" value of expected home equity for\nblacks (again for home ownership probabilities equal\nto 1), then the term becomes:\nW-XpWJ-i (7)\nor taking the natural logarithm:\nX &,WX,W - X PiWXiB = X p,w(X,w -\nhome equity weighted at a common set of coeffi-\ncients, in this case the white coefficients. In linear\nmodels, this difference is understood to be the por-\ntion of the racial gap that is due to unequal character-\nistics or endowments of blacks and whites.\nFor nonlinear specifications such as ours, never-\ntheless, the computations of \"discrimination-free\"\nprobabilities and home equities are straightforward.\nThe \"discrimination-free\" values are the values com-\nputed for blacks (whites) when they face the white\n(black) effects of their own endowments on out-\ncomes. Thus, it is possible to compute the probabil-\nity of home ownership for blacks when they are\n\"treated\" like equally qualified whites or, for that\nmatter, the probability of home ownership for whites\nwhen they are \"treated\" like equally qualified blacks.\nThe resulting estimates are termed \"discrimination-\nfree\" estimates and form the basis for our approxi-\nmate decomposition.\nNote, however, that we can perform six \"discrimi-\nnation-free\" computations of expected home eq-\nuity: (1) treatment of blacks like whites in the deter-\nmination of home ownership and home equity; (2)\ntreatment of whites like blacks in the determination\nof home ownership and home equity; (3) treatment\nof blacks like whites in the determination of home\nownership, holding constant differences in home\nequity; (4) treatment of whites like blacks in the\ndetermination of home ownership, holding constant\ndifferences in home equity; (5) treatment of blacks\nlike whites in the determination of home equity,\nholding constant differences in home ownership;\nand (6) treatment of whites like blacks in determina-\ntion of home equity, holding constant differences in\nhome ownership.\nEffects of Independent Factors\nThe previously mentioned decomposition does\nnot speak specifically to the independent factors that\ncontribute to the inequality. It is an attempt to de-\ncompose the total disparity into endowment and\ntreatment effects, but without pointing to the indi-\nvidual factors that combine to yield those endow-\nment and treatment effects.\nAn alternative method permits the calculation of\nelasticities of the racial inequality in expected home\nequity. Consider the ratio of white to black expected\nhome equity:\nR =\nNow, of course, the term has a ready interpretation\nof being the racial differences in the determinants of\nThis ratio, R, is the expected home equity of whites\nrelative to blacks. It is a measure of inequality. When\nR increases, the racial inequality in expected home\nequity increases. When R declines, the racial in-\nequality in expected home equity declines. Taking\nthe natural logarithm preserves this relationship.\nThus,\nln(R) = lnE(Yw)-lnE(YB)\n= ln[Pw\u00abexp X prXiW] - ln[PB\u00abexp X P8X(\nB]\n= [lnPw - lnPB] + [X ( W ] - X P?X,B]. (10)\nNote that the difference in the first set of brackets\nrelates to home-ownership disparities and the differ-\nence in the second set of brackets relates to home\nequity disparities. Thus, by breaking the inequality in\nexpected home equity into the sum of two parts, we\ncan partition the effects of independent factors on\nexpected home equity into portions operating\nthrough differences in home ownership and por-\ntions operating through differences in home equity.\nConsider the effect of the independent factor X, on\nexpected home equity inequality. Whether this fac-\ntor increases or decreases inequality depends on\nwhether ln(R) increases or decreases when Xi\nchanges. The derivative of ln(R) with respect to X(\nis\ngiven by:\n^ L [(1 _pW)a\n_pB)ajB] +\ndX,\nmome Ownership EffectJ LHome Equity EffectJ\nThe first term in the brackets is the home owner-\nship effect, or the change in inequality through\nchanges in the relative differences in home owner-\nship. The second term in the brackets is the home\nequity effect, or the change in inequality through\nchanges in relative differences in home equity. In\nboth instances the change in equality is the result of a\nsmall change in the independent factor X,, assuming\nthat all other factors are held constant. These partial\nchanges can be computed for all independent fac-\ntors. It is useful to express the result as an elasticity,\nor the percentage change in the ratio of white to\nblack expected home equity as a result of a 1%\nincrease in X|. The elasticity is found to be the deriva-\ntive above times X(\n. Note, however, that these elastic-\nities do not factor out the effects of differences in\ntreatment and differences in endowments.\nA Factorial Decomposition\nTo factor out the independent effects of each X^\none can compute the expected home equity for\nblacks substituting Xiw for XjB. The result is the ex-\npected home equity for blacks if blacks were en-\ndowed with Xj at the level experienced by whites.\nSubtracting from this measure the expected home\nequity for blacks and dividing by the racial gap in\nexpected home equity yields the percent of the racial\ngap accounted for by racial differences in X,. Sum-\nming this result across all X, gives the total percent of\nthe racial gap in expected home equity that can be\naccounted for by racial differences in X's. What re-\nmains is the portion of the racial gap that cannot be\nexplained by racial differences in X's.\nResults\nTable 5 provides the coefficient estimates in the\nhome ownership and home equity equations. Sig-\nnificant factors that increase the odds of home own-\nership among whites are age, marriage, number of\nyears married, family income, long planning hori-\nzons, abstract thinking skills, and location in the East\nNorth Central and mountain regions. Significant fac-\ntors that reduce the odds of home ownership for\nwhites are number of marriages, health problems,\nurban location, and risk preference. Significant fac-\ntors that increase the odds of home ownership\namong blacks are being female or married, higher\nfamily incomes, higher scores on the abstract rea-\nsoning test, and living in the East North Central,\nSouth Atlantic, East South Central, or the West South\nCentral regions. A few factors, significant only at the\n10% level, reduce the odds of home ownership\namong blacks. These include being younger and\nliving in urban areas.\nOlder, more highly educated, higher income\nwhite homeowners married for longer periods of\ntime and those on the Pacific coast have higher home\nequity. In contrast, white homeowners with multiple\nprevious marriages, who cannot work, who are Fun-\ndamentalist Protestants, who have longer financial\nplanning horizons, and who live anywhere except for\nthe northeast or Pacific regions have lower housing\nequities.\nFewer factors are statistically significant in deter-\nmining black homeowners' home equity. Significant\npositive correlates are higher incomes and education\nlevels and living in urban areas or the Pacific region.\nSignificant negative variables are being unable to\nwork and living in the East North Central, East South\nCentral, or West South Central regions.\nEven though the coefficients are not all statistically\nsignificant in determining home ownership and home\nequity, they differ conspicuously between blacks and\nwhites. Such differences suggest that not all of the gap\nin home ownership or home equity arises simply from\ndemographic differences between blacks and whites,\nas shown by decomposition.\nTable 6 shows the results of the decomposition.\nUsing the coefficients estimated for the black and\nwhite home equity and home ownership equations,\none can compute predicted and \"discrimination-\nfree\" probabilities of home ownership and home\nequity among homeowners. These computations\npermit the calculation of expected home equity un-\nder various scenarios.\nOne scenario is when blacks and whites receive\ntheir own estimated home equity. This base compu-\ntation estimates black and white home equity, to\nwhich other computations are compared. This calcu-\nlation of expected home equity -- the product of the\npredicted home equity for homeowners and the pre-\ndicted home ownership probability-- is an unbiased\nestimate of the actual home equity found for the\ncombined sample of homeowners and those who do\nnot own homes. This value is found in column one\nand is the base from which the discriminatory gap is\nmeasured. A second scenario is when blacks are\ntreated like whites or whites are treated like blacks\nin the determination of home equity, holding con-\nstant differences in home ownership. This is a \"dis-\ncrimination-free\" computation revealed in column\ntwo, but it ignores possible unequal treatment in\nhome ownership. A third scenario is when blacks are\ntreated like whites or whites are treated like blacks in\nthe determination of home ownership, holding con-\nstant differences in home equity.

The results are\ndisplayed in column three. Still a fourth scenario is\nwhen blacks are treated like whites or whites are\ntreated like blacks in the determination of both\nhome equity and home ownership. The results are\ndisplayed in column four. These \"discrimination-\nfree\" computations can then be used to derive mea-\nsures of \"discriminatory gaps\" due to home equity\ndisparities, to home ownership disparities, and to\nboth. These measures are displayed in columns five\nthrough seven.\nTable 6 shows that the predicted black home own-\nership rate is 59.71%. But when blacks are treated like\nequally qualified whites, their home ownership rate\nrises to 68.94%. Predicted home equity for black\nhomeowners is $48,930. When blacks are treated like\nequally qualified whites, their predicted home equity\nrises to $72,842. Thus, among all black families, the\nWhen black homeowners are treated like white\nhomeowners in the determination of home equity\nbut existing disparities in home ownership remain\nunchanged, the expected home equity for blacks\nexpected home equity is $67,740, this means that the\ndiscriminatory gap in home equity among homeown-\ners accounts for about 37% of the racial gap in ex-\npected home equity.\nWhen blacks are treated like whites in the determi-\nnation of home ownership but existing disparities in\nhome equity remain, the expected home equity for\nThus, holding constant existing disparities in home\nequity among homeowners, discriminatory gaps in\nhome ownership only explain about 12% of the ob-\nserved gap in expected home equity.\nAllowing for equal treatment of blacks and whites\nin the determination of both home ownership and\nhome equity yields an expected home equity for\nthe \"discrimination-free\" black expected home eq-\nuity less the predicted black expected home equity\nup to about 55% of the gap between white and black\nexpected home equity.

In the\ntop third of the family income distribution, the mea-\nsured discriminatory gap as a percentage of the ac-\ntual gap is 82%; in the middle third it is 83%; in the\nlowest third it is 62%. That is, even at the highest\nincomes, there remains a discriminatory portion of\nthe racial gap in expected home equity. Note that the\nhome equity component is less important at lower\nincomes and the home ownership component is less\nimportant at higher incomes.\nThese findings are robust with respect to the base\nused to compare \"equally qualified\" blacks and\nwhites. Thus, when whites are treated like blacks,\ntheir expected home equities fall by about 62%. More-\nover, most of that fall is due to differences in home\nequity and not to differences in home ownership.\nTable 7 provides two sets of estimates for each\nindependent variable. First, the elasticity of the ex-\npected home equity inequality is presented. Column\none gives the total elasticity; column two provides\nthe elasticity from the home equity equation, hold-\ning constant changes in home ownership; column\nthree provides the elasticity from the home owner-\nship equation, holding constant changes in home\nequity. The second set of estimates compute ex-\npected black home equity when black values for\neach independent variable are replaced with white\nvalues. This calculation is presented in column four.\nIn column five, the percentage of the total gap in\nexpected home equity between whites and blacks\nthat can be explained by each independent variable\nis displayed.\nThe only elastic effect is that of family income. A\n1% increase in the log-family income reduces the\nratio of white to black home equity by 2%. Most of\nthis effect is through the home ownership equation.\nOnly V2 of 1% of the effect is through the home\nequity equation. Note, moreover, that a 1% increase\nin the log of family income is a sizable increase in\nuntransformed income. The next largest impacts are\nmarital status and abstract reasoning skills. A 1%\nincrease in marriage or in the cognitive score will\nreduce inequality in expected home equity by less\nthese elasticities are computed based on coefficients\nthat are not always statistically significant, the con-\nclusion emerges that few if any of the independent\nvariables contribute substantially to explaining the\nracial gap in expected home equity.\nTo see this point in quite another way, we estimate\nthe independent contribution to the gap in expected\nhome equity of each variable by computing what the\nblack expected home equity would be if blacks had\none white characteristic. For example, there is a huge\ndisparity in black and white cognitive scores. Sup-\npose that blacks had white scores, but all other black\ncharacteristics remained unchanged. Computed at\nthe means of all independent variables, the black\ncognitive scores are replaced by white scores, black\nexpected home equity rises to $36,598. This accounts\nfor only about 9% of the gap between the white and\nblack expected home equity. Another 27% is due to\ndifferences in log-incomes. Together, all 25 indepen-\nTable 7.

This figure is in the\nsame range as those presented in Table 6, where 55\nto 62% of the gap was unexplained.\nIn short, although there are many factors that dif-\nfer substantially between black and white house-\nholders -- factors that can and do limit access to\nhome ownership and accumulation of equity in a\nhouse -- none of these factors, save for family in-\ncome, has much of an impact on the overall inequal-\nity in home equity. Miraculously endowing blacks\nwith the financial, demographic, and geographic ad-\nvantages enjoyed by whites would not alter the ex-\npected home equity differential to a great degree.\nInstead, it appears that the unexplained or \"discrimi-\nnatory\" factors play a critical role in curtailing the\nmovement toward racial equality in housing.\nCaveats\nOur strong findings must be tempered by several\nobservations. First, the data set focuses on\npreretirement-aged persons. These findings are diffi-\ncult to extrapolate to the larger population. One\nwonders, moreover, whether discriminatory pat-\nterns in lending and thus in expected home equity\nare smaller in earlier years but simply compound and\nmultiply over the life-cycle.\nSecond, we have not controlled for wealth or other\nassets. Although doing so would require a more\ncomplicated model specification and estimation to\naccount for the fact that wealth in our analysis cannot\nbe considered a strictly exogenous variable, it does\nstand to reason that other financial assets could influ-\nence lender decisions and thus \"explain\" some of\nthe unexplained residual we have computed. One\ncan imagine, however, a reduced-form specification\nof a model accounting for other assets that looks\nexactly like the one we have specified.\nThird, our measure of income is current income.\nThis neither measures income at the time that per-\nsons obtained mortgages and purchased their homes\nnor does it measure permanent income. The result is\nthat some portion of the \"unexplained\" residual may\nin fact be an artifact of the measurement error in our\nincome proxy.\nConclusion\nAmple evidence exists of substantial racial dispari-\nties in home ownership and home equity. These\ndisparities have the potential for preventing the\nequalization of wealth and net worth in American\nsociety. Conventional explanations for credit, finan-\ncial, and housing ownership disparities seem to fo-\ncus on the low incomes and poor financial skills of\nminorities. Examination of a unique data set of\npreretirement-aged householders provides the op-\nportunity to test the hypothesis that poor financial\nskills, low incomes, and/or other sociodemographic\nfactors are at the root of racial inequalities in hous-\ning. Others have found that financial variables seem\nto be not that important in explaining disparities in\nhome equity (Vanderhart, 1993) and that discrimina-\ntion does not emerge as the primary explanation for\nracial disparities in home ownership (Megbolugbe &\nLinneman, 1993). Nevertheless, other than family\nincome, few other variables explain much of the\nracial disparity in expected home equity. The remain-\ning portion of unexplained racial gaps is large. It is\nlarger than that found for home ownership, where\nrecent estimates of discriminatory gaps are in the\nrange of 20 to 33%, and larger than that found for\nhousing prices alone, where the estimates are in the\nThis suggests that racial differences in expected\nhome equity are explainable only to a limited extent\nby racial differences in home ownership and/or its\ndeterminants. Although there are sizable income\ndisparities that lead to lower home ownership rates\namong blacks, these alone are not sufficient to ex-\nplain more than about a quarter of the gaps in ex-\npected home equity between blacks and whites.\nOther evidence, moreover, suggests that most of the\ngap in housing prices can be explained by locational,\nwealth, and income factors (Long & Caudill, 1992).\nThus, one is left with the hypothesis that the underly-\ning cause of racial differences in expected home\nequity rests with lender and credit behaviors. Future\nanalysis of this data set will permit further explora-\ntion of this hypothesis.\nReferences\nBarefoot, J. A. (1992, December). Time to renew efforts against discrimina-\nBianchi, S.

The results reveal an average discriminatory gap in expected\nhome equity as a percent of the actual gap of 55%. In the top third of the family income\ndistribution, the measured discriminatory gap is 82%; in the middle third it is 83%;\nin the lowest third it is 62%.\nKey Words: Discrimination, Housing, Net worth, Mortgage, Credit\nRacial Differences in Home\nOwnership and Home Equity Among\nPreretirement-Aged Households1\nSamuel L. Myers, Jr., PhD2 and Chanjin Chung, PhD3\nThe problem of housing market discrimination and\nracial disparities in mortgage lending has taken on a\nnew level of urgency (\"Blacks, Hispanics Remain\nMost Likely to Be Denied Home Loans,\" 1992; Bren-\nas well as federal officials, have begun to reexamine\nthe underlying structures of mortgage and housing\nmarkets to understand the persistence of racial gaps\nin lending (Barefoot, 1992; Boston Federal Reserve,\nturbing observation is that even during times when\nracial gaps in mortgage lending should have been\nnarrowing -- such as in 1992 when interest rates\nbegan an unprecedented nosedive below double-\ndigit rates -- the racial gaps persisted (Myers, 1994).\nFew minority individuals refinanced their loans dur-\ning this period, even though loan refinancings be-\ncame the most frequent form of mortgage loan dur-\ning the period (Myers, 1994). Thus, not only were\nminority individuals less likely to obtain refinancings\nwhen they applied, they were less likely to apply. At\nleast for middle-aged borrowers, the impact could\nbe high debt levels carried into their retirement\nyears. These high debt levels, along with low home\nownership rates, may help explain the widely cited\n1Charles Brown, Sanders Korenman, and participants in the Minority\nPerspectives in the Health and Retirement Study Workshop provided valu-\nable comments on an earlier draft.

At the top fifth, the median net worth of\ndistribution, the net worth of whites is a little more\nthan twice that of blacks. At the bottom of the distri-\nbution, there is a staggering racial gap in wealth.\nThere, the median net worth of blacks is $100, while\nHome equity represents one of the most important\ncomponents of net worth. Home equity accounted\nfor 43% of the net worth of households in America in\nthough, home equity accounted for 63.3% of net\nblacks are considerably less likely than whites to own\na home (Bianci, Farley, & Spain, 1982; Kain & Quig-\nlugbe & Linneman, 1993). Thus, at least some of the\nunequal net worth of blacks likely arises because of\nunequal home ownership rates. Financial factors,\nlow incomes, or short financial planning horizons\nmight explain both the huge racial disparities in net\nworth and the wide racial variations in mortgage\nlending outcomes observed in other data sets, such\nas the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data set.\nFor example, the most frequently cited reasons for\nnonwhites (and blacks in particular) having lower\nloan acceptance rates than whites is that nonwhites\nhave bad credit records and low financial asset lev-\nels. Bad credit can be proxied by high risk prefer-\nence, short financial planning horizons, and factors\nthat contribute to late payments like interrupted em-\nployment, illness, and family emergencies. Poor ed-\nucation, low skills in money management, and low\nfamily incomes putatively contribute to bad credit\nand thus the difficulty that minority individuals have\nin obtaining financing in order to purchase homes.\nAggravating the negative effect of bad credit on\nhome ownership is the impact of low financial assets.\nLenders generally require larger down payments of\npoor credit risks. Without financial assets needed to\ncompensate for bad credit, the combined effects of\nthese variables are to lower home ownership rates.\nAlthough it is not clear how these two factors -- bad\ncredit and low financial assets -- influence home\nequity among black homeowners, it is possible that\nthe net effect is to widen the racial gap in home\nequity.\nUltimately, then, the question we wish to address\nis how much financial factors, as opposed to demo-\ngraphic factors, explain racial differences in home\nownership and home equity. We know there are\nwide disparities in lending that may contribute to the\ninequality in home ownership. Lending practices can\nalso contribute to inequality in home equity if\nlenders discriminate on the terms and sizes of loans.\nWe need to determine the extent of \"unexplained\"\nracial residual in home ownership and home equity\nthat could possibly be explained by discrimination\non the part of lenders or other institutions. That is\nthe purpose of this article. After accounting for finan-\ncial factors, such as attitudes toward risk, rates of\ntime discount, family resources and the like, how\nmuch of the racial gap in home ownership and/or\nhome equity remains \"unexplained\"?\nOur analysis shows that racial differences in ex-\npected home equity are explainable only to a limited\nextent by racial differences in home ownership and/\nor its determinants. Although there are sizable in-\ncome disparities that lead to lower home ownership\nrates among blacks, these alone are not sufficient to\nexplain more than about a quarter of the gap in\nexpected home equity between blacks and whites.\nWe are left with the hypothesis that the underlying\ncause of racial differences in expected home equity\nrests with the behavior of lenders and creditors.\nThe data used to explore this question are in the\nRetirement Survey (Institute for Social Research,\nsampling weight is used to compensate for unequal\nselection probabilities. The sample is a preretire-\nment age sample that is (or ought to be) in the last\nstages of its investment cycle. Thus, one would ex-\npect housing ownership to be higher among this\ngroup than among younger age groups and home\nequity to be at a peak, if home equity is an invest-\nment vehicle designed to provide resources for re-\ntirement (Vanderhart, 1993). This cohort of non-\nwhites, moreover, ought to be better off than\nprevious generations because of post-World War II\nhousing subsidies and government mortgage pro-\ngrams and post-1960s housing and mortgage antidis-\ncrimination legislation.\nBackground\nHome equity is the difference between housing\nvalue and mortgage and related debt on all housing\nunits owned. Persons who do not own their own\nhomes have no home equity (see Appendix, Note 1).\nAmong persons who own their own homes, home\nequity varies with length of ownership, housing ap-\npreciation, and related factors. These factors, in\nturn, can be determined by financial and personal\nvariables. Conceptually, then, average home equity\ncan be decomposed into two parts: (1) a component\nrelated to home ownership, and (2) a component\nrelated to housing value less debt;\nTables 1 and 2 show the wide racial disparities in\nmean and median net worth for preretirement aged\nhouseholds. Mean net worth among blacks is 29.7%\nthat of whites. Black median net worth is only 21.2%\nthat of whites. When means are calculated, the ratio\nof home equity to net worth is larger for blacks than\nwhites. But because so many blacks, even among 51-\nto 61-year-olds, do not own their homes, the median\nhome equity for black households is very small,\nresulting in a smaller proportion of blacks' median\nnet worth accounted for by home equity than is the\ncase among whites. However, even in the highest\nranks of the income distribution, where home own-\nership race differentials are small, there are consid-\nerable gaps in home equity. At the top fifth of the\nfamily income distribution, 90.8% of blacks own their\nhomes; 93.4% of whites do. This is not statistically\ndifferent. Yet, the mean home equity at this high end\nfor whites. Thus, although the ratio of black to white\nhome ownership rates is 0.972 in this upper bracket,\nthe ratio of black to white home equity is only 0.664.\nTable 3 provides summary statistics on factors that\nmay affect home ownership and/or home equity.\nBlacks are slightly younger than whites in the sample\nof householders and in the sample of homeowners.\nTheir family incomes are lower; they are less likely to\nbe married or have been married fewer years; and\nthey are more likely to be female and are more likely\nto have children living at home. Among all house-\nholds, they are less likely to work and more likely to\nhave health problems, although among home own-\ners, these differences are not statistically significant.\nBlacks are also generally less well educated and more\nlikely to be concentrated in urban areas than are\nwhites. The regional distribution differs as well.\nBlacks in the sample are found in concentrations in\nSouth Atlantic and East North Central states, while\nwhites are concentrated in West North Central and\nPacific states. Both white and black Fundamentalist\nProtestants make up about 12.5% of both the white\nand black populations.\nSeveral noteworthy financial factors are included\nin the data set: attitudes toward risk, planning hori-\nzon, and abstract thinking scores (which might serve\nas a proxy for financial planning ability).\nTable 1.

The questions concerned two hypotheti-\ncal earnings situations: one with a certain income,\nanother with a chance to earn a higher income,\naccompanied by a risk of it being lower. The vast\nmajority of persons chose the income with certainty\nover the various less certain income options. We\nloosely term the respondents who chose the less\ncertain options as those with risk preferences.\nThe specific question was: \"Suppose that you are\nthe only income earner in the family and you have a\ngood job guaranteed to give your current (family)\nincome every year for life. You are given the oppor-\ntunity to take a new and equally good job, with a 50-\n50 chance it will double your (family) income and a\n50-50 chance that it will cut your (family) income by a\nthird. Would you take the job? Suppose the chances\nwere 50-50 that it would double your (family) income,\nand a 50-50 chance that it would cut it in half. Would\nyou take the new job? Suppose the chances were 50-\n50 that it would double your (family) income and 50-\n50 that it would cut it by 20 percent. Would you take\nthe new job?\" Persons answering \"yes\" to any of the\nabove were termed risk preferrers. Only 31.8% of\nblacks and 35.1% of whites responded \"yes\" to any\nTable 3.
