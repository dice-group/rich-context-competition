The main outcome measures were\npercent body fat, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and glucose\nintolerance based on the World Health Organization's 1985 criteria for an oral glucose tolerance\ntest.\nRESULTS -- Shorter height and leg length, and lower leg length\u00adto\u00adheight ratio, were asso-\nciated with higher percent body fat, especially in women.

(1) have hypothesized an\nassociation between impaired nutri-\ntion in utero and later development\nof chronic diseases, such as cardiovascu-\nlar disease, hypertension, and diabetes.\nChildren who are born small and then\ndisplay \"catch-up growth\" are thought to\nbe at highest risk (2,3). To facilitate the\nepidemiologic study of these hypotheses,\nit is helpful to focus on adult traits that are\nindicators of childhood development.\nStature is one such trait.\nAdult stature and its components re-\nflect childhood growth patterns: leg\nlength is an indicator of prepubertal\ngrowth (4), evidence of which is usually\nhard to obtain directly in adulthood. Nor-\nmal growth curves show that leg length-\nening slows at about 13 years of age for\ngirls and 16 years of age for boys (4). The\nratio of sitting height to leg length falls\nrapidly between birth and 4 years of age\n(5,6). A recent study showed that attained\nleg length was positively associated with\nhaving been breast-fed (7,8) and with en-\nergy intake at 4 years of age (8).\nSeveral studies have established an\nassociation between short stature in\nadulthood and the risk of obesity (9\u00ad11),\ninsulin resistance (11,12), and glucose in-\nstudies have suggested an association\nHowever, previous studies of anthropom-\netry and glucose metabolism focused only\nused samples of only men (12) or only\nthe general U.S. population (9\u00ad22), and\nmany studies did not account for the po-\ntentially confounding effects of socioeco-\nalyzed data from the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) (23) to test the hypothesis\nthat shorter height and leg length, and\nlower leg length\u00adto\u00adheight ratio, are in-\ndependently associated with greater like-\nlihood of adiposity, insulin resistance,\nand glucose intolerance in the general\nU.S. adult population.\nducted using a multistage sampling design\nto be representative of the noninstitution-\nalized civilian population in the U.S. from\nyears who completed physical examina-\ntions and laboratory tests at the mobile\nexamination center.

Race/ethnicity was cat-\negorized into three groups: non-Hispanic\nwhite, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican\nAmerican. Subjects were classified as hav-\ning parental history of diabetes if either\ntheir biological father or mother had dia-\nbetes (26).

This transformation produces\nlinear models in which -coefficients are\ninterpretable on a multiplicative scale\nrather than an additive scale. In contrast,\nfor glucose intolerance, we used multino-\nmial logistic regression models with\nthree-level dependent variable: 1) normal\nglucose tolerance, 2) IGT, and 3) type 2\ndiabetes with normal glucose tolerance.\nFor each analysis, we constructed\nthree nested models: 1) a basic model ad-\njusting for age only, 2) a model with other\npotential confounders (parental history of\ndiabetes, physical activity, education,\nhousehold income, smoking, and age at\nmenarche) in addition to age, and 3) a\nmodel that also included percent body fat.\nWe pooled across sex and race/\nethnicity unless consistent interactions\nwere observed. To minimize the possibil-\nity of confounding by age-related loss of\nstature due to osteoporosis, analyses were\nrepeated in a subset of adults aged 59\nyears and younger. Analyses were per-\nformed with Stata version 8.2 (37) using\npseudomaximum likelihoods with vari-\nance estimations by linearization or Fay's\nmodification of the balanced repeated\nreplication method (38).

Distributions of anthropometric\nmeasurements, from which sex- and race/\nethnicity-specific z-scores were calcu-\nlated, are shown in Table 2.\nAsao and Associates\nCorrelation between the z-scores of\nanthropometric measurements\nHeight and leg length were highly corre-\nto\u00adheight ratio was moderately correlated\nweakly correlated with height (r2  0.23;\nPercent body fat and anthropometric\nmeasurements\nSince there were significant interactions\nbetween sex and anthropometric mea-\nsurements in predicting percent body fat,\nwe stratified these analyses by sex. In\nwomen, percent body fat was significantly\nhigher in those with shorter height,\nshorter leg length, and lower leg length\u00ad\nto\u00adheight ratio, even after adjustment for\npotential confounders (Table 3). In men,\npoint estimates showed a similar pattern\nof associations, but none of these asso-\nciations were statistically significant\n(Table 3).\nHOMA-IR and anthropometric\nmeasurements\nLower leg length\u00adto\u00adheight ratio was sig-\nnificantly associated with greater\nHOMA-IR among those without diabetes,\neven after adjusting for a variety of poten-\ntial confounders (Table 3; model 2). Ad-\nditional adjustment for percent body fat\nattenuated this association but only\nslightly. Even after complete adjustment,\na 1-SD lower leg length\u00adto\u00adheight ratio\nwas associated with a 5% greater mean\nHOMA-IR (-coefficient from linear re-\ngression model for the log-transformed\nHOMA-IR  1.05). In contrast, neither\nheight nor leg length showed a consistent\nrelationship with HOMA-IR (Table 3;\nDiabetes, IGT, and anthropometric\nmeasurements\nShorter height, shorter leg length, and\nlower leg length\u00adto\u00adheight ratio were all\nassociated with higher prevalence of dia-\nbetes after adjusting for age (Table 3;\nmodel 1). Shorter leg length and lower leg\nlength\u00adto\u00adheight ratio remained associ-\nated with diabetes after multiple adjust-\nments (Table 3; model 2). The association\nbetween leg length\u00adto\u00adheight ratio and\ndiabetes was slightly attenuated after fur-\nther adjustment for percent body fat, but\nremained significant (Table 3; model 3): a\n1-SD lower leg length\u00adto\u00adheight ratio\nwas associated with a 19% greater risk of\nhaving diabetes (prevalence ratio \n1.19). Across the full range of leg length\u00ad\nto\u00adheight ratio, this corresponds to two-\nfold greater risk (Fig. 1). This relationship\nwas consistently present in men and\nwomen and in non-Hispanic whites and\nMexican Americans but was absent in\nnon-Hispanic blacks.\nPatterns of association with IGT were\nsimilar but weaker. Height and leg length\nwere inversely associated with prevalence\nof IGT, although none of the associations\nremained significant after multiple ad-\njustments (Table 3). There was no overall\nassociation between leg length\u00adto\u00adheight\nratio and IGT, but Mexican Americans\nshowed a larger and significant effect of\nleg length\u00adto\u00adheight ratio for the preva-\nlence ratio of IGT (P value for the interac-\ntion 0.01); the fully adjusted prevalence\nratio for IGT associated with a 1-SD lower\nvalue in leg length\u00adto\u00adheight ratio was\nTo minimize the possibility that\nage-related osteoporosis might have in-\nfluenced stature and its metabolic associ-\nations, we conducted additional analyses\nlimited to adults aged 60 or younger.\nThese analyses yielded similar patterns of\nresults.

These relationships were\ngraded and were independent of many\npotential confounders. Shorter overall\nstature showed similar patterns of associ-\nation but failed to maintain statistical sig-\nnificance after multiple adjustment.\nOur findings are consistent with re-\nsults from three previous studies of leg\nlength and diabetes-related outcomes in\nadults. The British Women's Heart and\nHealth Study (10) demonstrated inverse\nassociations of leg length and leg-to-trunk\nratio with BMI, HOMA-IR, and diabetes\nin elderly women. Two other studies\n(9,12) did not report on diabetes but did\nfind inverse associations between BMI\nand leg-trunk ratio in middle-aged\nadults.\nInsofar as short leg length and low\nleg-to-height ratio in adults indicate im-\npaired growth during childhood (39),\nthere are three potential pathways linking\nimpaired prepubertal growth to the risk\nof obesity and diabetes in middle age. The\nfirst pathway involves nutrition in early\nchildhood. Being breast-fed and higher\nenergy intake at 4 years of age are associ-\nated with longer leg length in adulthood\n(8). Being breast-fed may also lower the\nlong-term risk of obesity (40) and type 2\nThe second pathway involves hor-\nmonal factors relevant to growth. Insulin-\nlike growth factor-I, a major determinant\nof fetal and childhood growth (42), ap-\npears to predict a lower risk of diabetes in\nadulthood (43). Vitamin D is an alterna-\ntive candidate. Some polymorphism in\nthe vitamin D receptor gene appears to be\nassociated with both childhood growth\nFigure 1-- Diabetes and leg length\u00adto\u00adheight ratio in U.S. adults, The Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey, 1988\u00ad94.

Nutritional and hormonal\nenvironments in utero may affect the\nstructure and function of -cells in the\nadult pancreas through various mecha-\nnisms, such as vascularity, innervation, or\nislet morphology (46). In animal studies,\nsuboptimal nutrition in utero leads to in-\nsulin resistance in the liver, skeletal mus-\ncle, and adipose tissue (47).\nWe observed a significant interaction\nbetween sex and anthropometric mea-\nsurements for percent body fat. Earlier\npuberty may be associated with greater\nbody weight in both boys and girls, and\nthe establishment of the menstrual cycle\nin girls requires a certain amount of body\nfat (48). It is possible that the attained\nbody height is associated with body fat\nduring puberty, especially in girls, which\nmay be carried over into adulthood. We\nalso observed a significant interaction be-\ntween race/ethnicity and anthropometric\nmeasurements for the glucose tolerance.\nSince no previous related publications are\nbased on a typical U.S. population, this\nfinding needs further investigation in\nother studies.\nTwo study limitations deserve men-\ntion. First, we lacked data on perinatal\nand childhood growth (e.g., birth weight\nand length) and thus could not determine\nthe independent contributions of pre-\nversus postnatal factors on metabolic ab-\nnormalities in adulthood. Although leg\nlength is considered a more specific indi-\ncator of postnatal growth (39) than\nheight, it would be the best to conduct the\nstudy prospectively with anthropometric\ndata in utero or at birth. Second, the\ncross-sectional design of this study pre-\ncluded investigation of temporal se-\nquence. However, we believe that this\nposes only a minor threat, at least for the\noutcome of type 2 diabetes, since adult\nstature is typically attained before the dis-\norder develops. There remains the possi-\nbility of reverse causality: type 2 diabetes\nmight lead to shortened stature, for exam-\nple, through osteoporosis, although evi-\ndence for the association between type 2\ndiabetes and osteoporosis is inconsistent\n(49). Mitigating against this possibility,\nhowever, is the similar pattern of results in\nadults aged younger than 60 years, a group\nat lower risk for significant osteoporosis.\nOur study shows that adult stature\ncan be helpful in predicting the risk of\ndiabetes independently from other\nknown risk factors. Insofar as adult stat-\nure is an indicator of development and\ngrowth during early life, the risk of obe-\nsity, insulin resistance, and diabetes in\nadulthood might begin to accrue before\npuberty, as supported by longitudinal\nunderlying this association still require\nfurther research, specifically on nutri-\ntional and hormonal environments dur-\ning childhood in combination with\nenvironments in utero. Interventions to\nimprove prepubertal nutrition could rep-\nresent novel means to combat the epi-\ndemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n"
