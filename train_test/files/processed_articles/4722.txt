A positive LH test\nresult indicated that the cat was neutered. Cats were assessed for evidence of a surgical scar suggestive of prior\nneutering; if none was found, an exploratory laparotomy was performed to confirm neuter status. The LH test\nperformance was assessed (sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value).\nResults Two hundred and thirty-six cats had both LH test and exploratory laparotomy data. The specificity of the\nconfidence interval 59.3\u00ad76.8). The prevalence of neutered cats in this sample was 49%. The positive and negative\npredictive values were 1 and 0.77, respectively.\nConclusions and relevance The Witness LH test correctly detected all unneutered cats and thus there were no false\npositive results that incorrectly indicated a cat was neutered. This study therefore suggests that positive LH test\nresults avoid the need to perform surgery to confirm neuter status. This has significant welfare benefits for cats as it\nprovides a lower risk, faster and less traumatic alternative to surgery and, in the shelter setting, it will have a positive\nimpact on the cost, speed of assessment and time to rehoming of cats.\n",

Exploratory laparotomy as a method to confirm\nneuter status may also be frustrating for the surgeon.\nFrom a shelter perspective, performing an exploratory\nlaparotomy to confirm neuter status compared with\nusing a blood test involves more surgery-associated costs\n(anaesthesia, suture material, professional fees) and\nresults in longer length of stay. Clipping hair from the\nflanks and midline to check for evidence of a surgical scar\nis used by some practitioners, but this can be unreliable,\nleading to misdiagnosis of neuter status and occasionally\nresulting in pregnancy and unwanted litters.\nIt is widely recognised that circulating levels of\n\nluteinising hormone (LH) in unneutered cats are low, apart\nfrom a short-term surge of LH that occurs after mating\nwhich usually leads to ovulation.3\u00ad6 Ovulation can also\noccasionally occur in the absence of copulatory stimula-\ntion, caused by release of LH triggered by other stimuli.7\nBasal levels of LH during anoestrus are maintained by\nnegative feedback from the gonads. Various studies have\nshown that after the gonads are removed, LH levels rise.5,8,9\nIt is this principle of higher LH levels in neutered cats that\nhas stimulated interest in using detection of LH levels to\ndifferentiate between neutered and unneutered cats.\nRadioimmunoassay and a plate-based enzyme immuno-\nassay have been used to detect LH in serum, but both are\nexpensive, labour intensive, time consuming, require tech-\nnical expertise and can only be performed in a laboratory.\nThe Witness LH test (Zoetis) is a semi-quantitative\nrapid immune migration assay that was developed for\nuse in dogs to identify the LH surge and thus timing of\novulation. It has more recently been used to distinguish\novariectomised from sexually intact cats and dogs. It is an\nimmunochromatographic assay that uses gold-conju-\ngated antibodies to give a visual line in the presence of\nLH. A positive result occurs when the LH level in the\nsample is greater than 1 ng/ml, which indicates that the\nindividual has been neutered (Witness LH direction\ninsert). This test requires little technical expertise and\nprovides a result in 20 mins without the need to send\nsamples to a laboratory for analysis. The test instructions\nstipulate that any positive test result should be repeated\nin 2 h with a new sample to rule out a false positive result\nthat could be caused by the brief, episodic surges of\nserum LH that have been shown to occur in unneutered\ncats.5 The test instructions also say to repeat the test 24 h\nlater when a positive result is obtained in a cat suspected\nto be in oestrus.\nThe purpose of this study was to assess if the Witness\nLH test could be used to accurately assess the neuter sta-\ntus of queens. The study proposed that a single blood\nsample could be used to reliably predict the neuter sta-\ntus of female cats, thereby reducing the use of explora-\ntory laparotomy to confirm whether a cat is neutered or\nnot, as well as reducing the need for repeated blood sam-\npling, as described above.\nMaterials and methods\nSample size calculations indicated that 323 samples\nwould be required for 95% confidence and 5% precision\nof the estimate in a population with a 0.3 prevalence of\nneutered cats. Based on the findings of a pilot study and\nthe sample size estimate, this study was conducted using\nall suitable cats admitted to four Cats Protection adoption\ncentres over a 30 month period. This enabled enough\ndata to be collected and assisted in the assessment of any\neffects related to time of year (ie, ensuring some\n\nanoestrous queens during the winter months were\nassessed).\nInclusion criteria were female cats of unknown neuter\nstatus estimated to be 4 months of age. Exclusion crite-\nria were females estimated to be <4 months of age,\nfemales that were palpably pregnant, lactating or with\nkittens, and cats with the tip of the pinna removed from\nthe left ear (indicating likely previous neuter surgery).\nCats that met the inclusion criteria were blood sam-\npled for feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukae-\nmia virus screening as per normal practice for cats\nadmitted to Cats Protection adoption centres and the\npatient-side Witness LH test was performed on residual\nfresh serum within 24 h. The test was run in accordance\nwith the manufacturer's instructions by trained person-\nnel at the adoption centres and then recorded as a posi-\ntive, negative or `unable to interpret' result.Aphotograph\nwas taken of the test kit after the sample was run and this\nwas interpreted by an independent observer who was\nblinded to the outcome recorded by the adoption centre\nstaff. If there was a discrepancy in interpretation of the\nresult, the photo was sent to the person who ran the test\nand a second (blinded) interpretation was requested. The\nveterinary surgeons involved in the study were blinded\nto the results of the LH test. Cats were checked at flank\nand midline locations for evidence of a surgical scar at\nthe time of first veterinary clinical examination, under\ngeneral anaesthesia before exploratory laparotomy, or on\nboth occasions. If the operating veterinary surgeon was\nunsure of the neuter status on the basis of any marking\non the skin, the cat underwent exploratory laparotomy as\nper normal practice. The surgery was performed at least\n24 h after blood sampling in case the sample happened to\nbe taken during an LH spike in an unneutered cat.\nOvariohysterectomy was performed where appropriate\nor the cat was confirmed neutered. In cases where\nvenepuncture was performed for other clinical purposes,\na second blood sample was collected on the day of sur-\ngery, in case a second test for LH was needed.\nSeverely haemolysed or lipaemic samples were\nexcluded from the study, but some slightly haemolysed\nsamples were included. The impact of poor technique in\nrunning the test was minimised by having the same per-\nson train all operators, having clear written instructions,\nby conducting a pilot study and by minimising the\nMorrow et al 3\nnumber of different people running the test. Any LH\ntests where the control failed were excluded from the\nstudy.\nResults of the Witness LH test were compared to\nresults of exploratory laparotomy as gold standard. The\noutcomes used to assess the performance of the LH assay\nin this population were sensitivity, specificity, and posi-\ntive and negative predictive values. Sensitivity, or the\nLH test's ability to detect neutered cats, was calculated\nas the number of cats that the test correctly categorised\nas neutered (true positive test result) divided by the total\nnumber of cats found to be neutered at exploratory lapa-\nrotomy (positive gold standard result). Specificity, or the\ntest's ability to detect unneutered cats, was calculated as\nthe number of cats that the test correctly categorised as\nunneutered (true negative test result) divided by the\ntotal number of cats found to be unneutered at explora-\ntory laparotomy (negative gold standard result). The\npositive predictive value (PPV) was calculated as the\nnumber of cats correctly identified by the LH test as neu-\ntered divided by the total number of positive LH test\nresults. The negative predictive value (NPV) was calcu-\nlated as the number of cats correctly identified by the LH\ntest as unneutered divided by the total number of nega-\ntive LH test results.\nThe study was approved by the University of Bristol's\nethics committee.\nResults\nMay 2017. Four hundred and forty-two cats were\nenrolled in the study. One hundred and thirty-four cats\ndid not have an LH test result and were excluded from\nthe final analysis (Table 1). Seventy-two cats did not\nhave an exploratory laparotomy and were excluded\nfrom the final analysis (Table 2).\nTwo hundred and thirty-six cats had both an LH test\nand exploratory laparotomy and were included in the\ndata analysis. Twelve per cent of cats were sedated at\ntime of blood sampling. Overall, 10 different staff\nmembers ran and interpreted the tests at the four adop-\ntion centres and approximately 19 different vets per-\nformed the exploratory laparotomies (some data were\nmissing on name of surgeon performing the explora-\ntory laparotomy). Samples were tested in all months of\nthe year, ranging from 5\u00ad36 tests per month overall.\nThere were no post-homing reports of cats coming into\nseason or becoming pregnant 8 months after data col-\nlection ended (follow-up ranged from 8\u00ad36 months\npost-neutering, depending on the date the cat entered\nthe study). The test performance results are summa-\nrised in Figure 1.\nDiscussion\nThe specificity of the Witness LH test was 100% (95%\ntest had an excellent ability to detect unneutered cats.\nthat a reasonable number of the neutered cats tested pos-\nitive, but some false negative results occurred (ie, the LH\ntest indicated the cat was unneutered, but it was found\nto be neutered at exploratory laparotomy). The primary\nconsideration when using the test to assess neuter status\nis that every positive test represents a truly neutered cat\nso that an unneutered cat is not rehomed in the mistaken\nbelief that it is neutered. These data provide evidence\nthat within our sample the Witness LH test fulfilled this\nrequirement (PPV of 1). The NPV of 0.77 for this study\n(where the prevalence of neutered cats was 49%) indi-\ncated that for negative LH test results, an exploratory\nlaparotomy should be performed to confirm the true\nneuter status of the cat.\nTable 1 Reasons for exclusion from analysis due to no luteinising hormone (LH) test result\nReason for no LH test result n\nThe cat was excluded at time of clinical exam owing to a scar being found 81\nSample was lipaemic or severely haemolysed 21\nUnable to obtain blood sample 11\nThe cat was palpated pregnant 7\nTest not run because not enough blood 5\nTest result was unreadable 2\nThe cat was lactating 2\nThe cat had already been FeLV/FIV tested so there was no reason to take blood 2\nThe cat was euthanased for welfare reasons before the time of testing 1\nThe cat was too ill to blood test 1\nVaginal bleeding was observed 1\nFeLV = feline leukaemia virus; FIV = feline immunodeficiency virus\n4 Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery\nAsmall study by Scebra and Griffin of 50 cats of known\nneuter status (48% neutered) found that the Witness LH\ntest categorised all neutered cats correctly, but classified\ntwo of the unneutered cats as being neutered, resulting in\nand a NPV of 100%.10 In contrast to the data presented\nhere, they encountered false positive results but not false\nnegative results. This difference between results could be\ndue to the small sample size in the study by Scebra and\nGriffin,10 but, ultimately, the reason for this discrepancy is\nunknown. Rohlertz et al compared the Witness LH test to\nthe gonadotropin releasing hormone-stimulation test in 31\ncats of known neuter status (48% neutered) and reported\none false negative result and no false positive results with\nthe LH test.11 These results are similar to the data presented\nhere, but as with the study by Scebra and Griffin,10 the\nsample size was small. Most recently, Alm and Holst com-\npared the Witness LH test to an anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone\nassay in dogs of known neuter and oestrous status and\nfound that in 100 non-oestrus bitches, the Witness LH test\nproduced three false negative test results and no false posi-\ntive test results.12 The present study was designed to assess\nTable 2 Reasons for exclusion from analysis due to no exploratory laparotomy\nReason for no exploratory laparotomy n\nScar found at preparation for surgery 58\nScar found at veterinary examination but LH test was run at time of FeLV/FIV testing by mistake 5\nThe cat was confirmed neutered by a previous veterinary practice after LH test was performed 4\nThe cat was euthanased for welfare reasons before the time of exploratory laparotomy 3\nCat was found to be male after LH test run 1\nExploratory laparotomy findings were not recorded 1\nLH = luteinising hormone; FeLV = feline leukaemia virus; FIV = feline immunodeficiency virus\ntest positive = neutered (D+) Sensitivity = ability of the test to detect neutered cats = Sn\ntest negative = unneutered (D-) Specificity = ability of the test to detect unneutered cats = Sp\nExploratory laparotomy\n(gold standard)\nNeutered Not neutered\nTrue + True - totals\nLH test Test + (LH+) 79\n(TP)\n(FP)\n(FN)\n(TN)\nPPV 1 = Positive Predictive Value\n= proportion of cats with a positive test result that are neutered\nNPV 0.77 = Negative Predictive Value\n= proportion of cats with a negative test result that are not neutered\nFigure 1 Summary of Witness LH test performance.

The test is\nuseful because the majority of cats that were already\nneutered were ruled out of needing an exploratory lapa-\nrotomy by the positive LH test result. In addition, as\nthere were no false positive results, all of the unneutered\ncats that needed to go to exploratory laparotomy were\nidentified by the test.\nThe lack of false positive results also indicated that\nnone of the unneutered cats had a pre-ovulatory LH\npeak, a spontaneous ovulation or an episodic surge of LH\nat the time of sampling. In most queens behavioural signs\nof oestrus are very obvious and the other scenarios are\nprobably extremely uncommon. Thus, the results of this\nstudy suggest that it is not necessary to do a second LH\ntest with a new sample every time a positive result is\nobtained. The exception to this would be if a cat is sus-\npected to be showing signs of oestrus, a second test could\nbe performed 24 h later (as per the test instructions);\nhowever, if the signs of oestrus were unequivocal, the cat\nwould more likely be taken to surgery for neutering\nwithout waiting and repeating the test. In this group of\ncats, two were recorded by staff as showing signs of oes-\ntrus and both of them were negative with the LH test and\nwere found to be unneutered at exploratory laparotomy.\nThe Witness LH test correctly identified all unneu-\ntered cats in this study and the tests were run every\nmonth of the year, suggesting that the time of year when\nthe sampling is carried out does not affect the accuracy\nof the test. This is reassuring in that it indicates the per-\nformance of the test is not affected by anoestrus.\ntive test results [23%] ie, when the test indicated the cat\nwas unneutered when it was actually already neutered).\nPossible explanations for this are testing error, gold\nstandard error, physiological differences between neu-\ntered cats, stress or anaesthetic agents.\nTesting error can occur owing to factors such as sam-\nple quality, poor technique running the test, failure of the\ncontrol and inaccurate test interpretation (misclassifica-\ntion of the result). The majority of false negative results\noccurred when clear serum samples were used com-\npared to slightly haemolysed samples (data not shown),\nso sample quality did not appear to influence the num-\nber of false negative results in this study.\nInaccurate test result interpretation was likely to be\nthe most significant source of error with this semi-\nquantitative test because determination of a positive\nresult was based on subjective assessment of the test\nline being `similar or greater intensity to the control\nline'. Visual interpretation of immune migration assays\ncan be problematic and is a recognised issue.13 In this\ncase, it was not clear from the test insert instructions\nwhether `similar' includes only test lines that are equal\nto the control line or whether test lines that are slightly\nless intense than the control line would be considered\n`similar' and thus be categorised as a positive test\nresult. In addition, people have different abilities to\ndetect small differences between colour intensity and\nthis needs to be accounted for when developing patient-\nside tests that will, by their nature, be run and inter-\npreted by many different people. Post-study assessment\nof photos of the false negative results showed that in\nabout half of them the test line was less intense than the\ncontrol, but it was close enough that it could be inter-\npreted as similar and thus be categorised as a positive\nresult. If this was the case, in this set of data, test perfor-\nmance results for this study would become sensitivity\ninterpretation parameters for the test could be\nimproved, the frequency of false negative results could\nbe reduced. One promising solution to this would be\nthe use of a recently developed smartphone application\nthat quantitatively measures the LH level based on a\nphoto of the test.14\nWhile it is generally accepted that LH levels are\nhigher in neutered cats than in unneutered cats,5,6,8,9 it is\npossible that some neutered cats naturally have low LH,\nor LH levels in neutered cats are variable and occasion-\nally fall below the detection limit of assay (1 ng/ml),\nthus leading to a false negative result. It has been shown\nthat time since neuter may also affect circulating levels\nof LH,5,9 but in this study it was not known when the cat\nwas neutered and so it was not possible to attribute the\nexplanation for false negative results to this. The lack of\nknowledge of when the cat was neutered does reflect the\nconditions under which the test would normally be run\n(ie, to find out whether a cat is neutered or not). A study\nthat measured LH levels over time post-neutering using\nthe Witness LH test would provide more information on\nhow LH levels vary after neutering and whether this\nimpacts on test performance.\nStress has been shown to reduce LH secretion in\newes15 and in cats it has been shown to reduce pituitary\nsensitivity to LH-releasing hormone,16 so this could have\nhad an impact on the number of false negative results.\nDegree of stress was not formally assessed in this study,\nbut further studies could examine whether cats that are\nexperiencing a high level of stress are more likely to have\nfalse negative LH test results. Anaesthetic agents have\n6 Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery\nalso been shown to inhibit LH release in multiple spe-\ncies, including cats;5 however, in this study sedated cats\nwere not over-represented in cats that had a false\n\nnegative LH test result (data not shown).\nConclusions\nIn this study, the Witness LH test had excellent specificity\nand reasonable sensitivity for use in cats of unknown\n\nneuter status. There are significant welfare benefits to\nusing this test in cats of unknown neuter status because\nall cats that test positive can confidently be identified as\nneutered, without the need for further assessment by a\nsurgical procedure. While this study showed that not\nevery neutered cat will be detected by the LH test, 77% of\nthem were, which means an approximate potential 77%\nreduction in these unnecessary surgeries.\nThe Witness LH test is currently the only available\nnon-surgical test for assessing the reproductive status of\ncats that is easy to run, where a reliable result can be\nobtained using one blood sample and where an answer\nis obtained only 20 mins after sampling. This is a major\nadvantage in practical field applications. All other cur-\nrently available blood tests to determine neuter status\nrequire multiple blood samples, injections of hormones\nand/or need to be sent to a laboratory for analysis,\nresulting in higher cost and a significantly longer time\nfrom assessment to results.\n"
