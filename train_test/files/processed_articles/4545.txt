In addition,\ncommon bacterial species from burn patient\nwounds are constantly changing during the\ncourse of disease: initially, the burn wound\nis sterile, but it becomes colonized with\nGram-positive bacteria such as b-haemoly-\ntic Streptococcus after 48 h.4 With the appli-\ncation of surgical debridement and skin\ngrafting in early surgery, as well as extensive\nuse of systemic antibiotics and other treat-\nment interventions, Gram-negative bacteria\nsuch as Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be\ndetected.5 During treatment, bacterial resist-\nance also changes with the application of\nsignificant amounts of antibacterial agents.6\nFurthermore, bacterial prevalence differs\nbetween the burn wards of different hospitals:\nsome are dominated by Gram-negative bac-\nteria,7 while others predominantly report\nGram-positive organisms.8 Therefore, in the\ntreatment for burns, regular monitoring of\nbacterial epidemiology in hospital wards is\ncritical for the rational use of antibiotics.9\nIn our burn ward, P. aeruginosa is the most\nprevalent bacteria,10 and it is particularly\ndifficult to treat. Indeed, P. aeruginosa\nharbours many virulence factors, including\nelastase, exotoxin A, phospholipase and\nhomoserine lactone.11 In addition, this organ-\nism possesses a variety of drug resistance\nmechanisms: inactivation or suppression of\nenzyme production, increased expression of\nan active efflux pump system, biofilm forma-\ntion, and loss or decreased expression of outer\nmembrane proteins.12,13 Therefore, multi-\ndrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-\nresistant (XDR) strains are common. Burn\npatients infected with P. aeruginosa show a\nhigher mortality rate.14 Therefore, the devel-\nopment of effectively therapeutic strategies to\ntreat P. aeruginosa infection has been the\nfocus of our study group.\nThe widespread application of antibac-\nterial agents has resulted in increasing levels\nand severity of bacterial resistance,15,16 which\nin turn, demands greater use of antibacterial\nagents, further aggravating bacterial resist-\nance in a vicious cycle.6 Thus, it is essential\nto select appropriate antibacterial agents, to\navoid increased patient mortality17 and the\neconomic burden on patients and society.18\nHowever, in one study, more than 40% of\nantibacterial agents used in a hospital were\nreported to be inappropriate.19 Similarly, a\nreport from Tehran indicated that 40% of\nantibacterial agent use was inappropriate.20\nIn the United States, irrational application\nof antibacterial agents has also been\nobserved.21 These deficiencies in the rational\nuse of antibacterial agents are often accom-\npanied by adverse consequences, including\nhigh mortality22 and increased medical\ncosts.18 Therefore, it is not only necessary\nto monitor bacterial prevalence and drug\nresistance in hospital wards, but also anti-\nbacterial agent use. An increasing number of\ncountries and researchers are now attempt-\ning to simultaneously monitor antibacterial\nagent use together with bacterial epidemio-\nlogical data, with the aim of guiding policy\ndevelopment for the use of antibacterial\nagents.23 However, many previous studies\nassessing anti-infective treatments for\nburns7,8 only monitored the prevalence and\ndrug resistance of common bacteria in wards\nand neglected antibacterial use, making it\ndifficult to understand the impact of\ninappropriate use of antibacterial agents in\nthese cases.\nIn this retrospective study, we statistically\nanalysed the use of antibacterial agents\nand bacterial epidemiology in wards\ntreating burn patients. In particular, the\nuse of antibacterial agents and drug resist-\nance of P. aeruginosa were simultaneously\nevaluated, identifying any inappropriate\nantibacterial use. Through this combined\nanalysis, we aimed to provide reliable data\nto guide policy development for the rational\nuse of antibacterial agents in burn wards.\nMaterials & methods\nBacterial sample collection\nThe study was retrospective. Bacterial sam-\nples were collected from hospitalized patients\nin the burn wards of Ruijin Hospital,\nShanghai Jiaotong University School of\nUpon admission, the patients received rou-\ntine preventative treatment which comprised\nlincomycin, and further treatment was\nadjusted according to antibiotic susceptibility\ntest results. This study was approved by the\ninstitutional review board of Ruijin Hospital,\nShanghai Jiaotong University, School of\nMedicine and written informed consent was\nobtained from every participant.\nWound secretion specimens were collected\nfor microbial culture at the first dressing\nchange after admission, and subsequently on\na weekly basis. Wound specimens were col-\nlected by sterile swabs from the wound\nsurface after the removal of the dressing. In\npatients with central venous catheters, germi-\nculture was also carried out with catheteriza-\ntion specimens and blood samples from\nipsilateral/contralateral limbs when the cath-\neter was extracted. In individuals with hyper-\npyrexia, diarrhoea, pulmonary infection\n(evidenced by a chest X-ray) and urinary\ntract infection, germiculture was also per-\nformed on blood, faecal, sputum and mid-\nstream urine samples, respectively.\nBacterial strain isolation and identification\nAll samples were routinely inoculated onto\nMueller\u00adHinton agar medium (Oxoid, UK)\nbacterial strain isolation and purification,\nidentification was carried our using an API\nbacterial identification strip on a Vitek-2\nfully-automatic germ analysis system\n(Biomerieux, France). Identical bacterial\nidentification in different samples from the\nsame patient indicated a positive result.\nDrug susceptibility test\nDrug susceptibility was determined by the\nKirby\u00adBauer disk diffusion method (filter\npaper purchased from Oxoid), in accord-\nance with Clinical and Laboratory\nStandards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.24\nA total of six antibiotics were selected for\nassessing the drug resistance of P. aerugi-\nnosa, including amikacin (30 mg), cef-\ntazidime (30 mg), cefoperazone/sulbactam\n(10 mg) and ciprofloxacin (5 mg). Standard\nstrains for quality control were Escherichia\nwere all provided by the Shanghai Centre\nfor Clinical Laboratory. The results were\nexpressed as the rate of resistant strains\namong all detected P. aeruginosa strains.\nMDR strains of P. aeruginosa were also\ncalculated annually.

Statistical\nanalysis was performed using the SPSS\n19.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL,\nUSA). Time-trend analysis through curve\nestimation was performed for the percentage\nof specific bacteria among all detected\npathogens, antibacterial use density,\nP. aeruginosa resistance to specific anti-\nbiotics and MDR strains of P. aeruginosa.\nPearson correlation analyses were per-\nformed between indexes when they followed\na normal distribution in the Kolmogorov\u00ad\nSmirnov Z test. P < 0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant.\nResults\nAnnual changes in specific bacteria\ngenic strains were isolated, including 2561,\nsecretions, catheters, drainage fluid, throat\nswabs, blood, faecal, urine and sputum\nsamples, respectively.\nThe number of detected strains for each\nbacterial species, and the percentage of\nspecific bacteria among all detected patho-\ngens, were calculated annually (Table 1 &\nFigure 1).\nAlthough S. aureus was the predominant\nspecies throughout the years, its percentage\ndetection significantly decreased year by\nlar decreasing trend was found for the\ndetection of Staphylococcus epidermidis,\np < 0.05). By contrast, annual changes in\nthe detection rates for P. aeruginosa and\nKlebsiella pneumoniae showed the opposite\ntrend.

Specific and appropriate\nantibacterial use would achieve the pur-\nposes of fighting infection and mitigating\ndrug resistance, avoiding the harm caused\nby irrational use of antibacterial agents.\nHowever, most reports on burn infections7,8\nonly monitored the prevalence and drug\nresistance of common bacteria, not taking\ninto consideration the use of antibacterial\nagents in burn wards. In this study, we\ncombined the analysis of antibacterial agent\nuse and resistance of P. aeruginosa, an\nimportant bacterial species detected in our\nburn wards.10 Our data provide insight into\ninappropriate use of antibacterial agents,\nand may provide guidance for more effective\ntherapeutic strategies that may help alleviate\nbacterial resistance.\nWe focused on P. aeruginosa because\nprevalence rates revealed a significant\nincreasing trend, followed by K. pneumo-\nniae, another Gram-negative bacterium. By\ncontrast, Gram-positive S. aureus and\nS. epidermidis showed a significant decreasing\ntrend in prevalence. This was in agreement\nwith a recent study of pathogen prevalence\nand drug resistance in a burn ward, which\npositive, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi,\nrespectively.26 Studies have reported that\nburn patients infected with Gram-negative\nbacteria, especially P. aeruginosa,27 have a\nhigher risk of death. Thus, more attention\nshould be paid to Gram-negative bacteria,\nespecially P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae,\nin determining antibiotic use in burn wards.\nTable 6. Correlation analyses of the percentage of P. aeruginosa resistant strains to specific antibiotics and\nthe use densities of common anti-Gram-negative antibiotics.\nAmikacin Ceftazidime\nCefoperazone/\nsulbactam Imipenem Meropenem Ciprofloxacin\nCefoperazone/\nsulbactam\nThe common anti-Gram-negative antibiotics are listed in the rows. The specific antibiotics, to which the resistance rates of\nP. aeruginosa were measured, are listed in the columns.\nOur results revealed that the use inten-\nsities of amikacin, ceftazidime, cefuroxime\nand cefoperazone/sulbactam showed\nincreasing trends. This might be due to\nextensive detection of Gram-negative bac-\nteria, as these agents are commonly\nemployed to treat Gram-negative bacterial\ninfections. Consistent with this, correlation\nanalysis revealed that the detection rate of\nP. aeruginosa positively correlated with the\nuse intensities of cefuroxime (r \u00bc 0.89, p <\nAlthough the intensity of use of vancomycin\ndid not significantly increase, it remained\nhigh and ranked first for all of the years\nbe attributed to the fact that S. aureus\nalways ranked first among the detected\npathogens, although its rates of detection\ndecreased over time.\nIt has been reported that P. aeruginosa\nstrains detected in burn patients are usually\nMDR, i.e. show resistance to ciprofloxacin,\ncephalexin, aztreonam and ceftriaxone,28\nand are associated with higher mortality,29\nlonger hospital stays and an increased\nnumber of ventilator days.30 Patients with\nresistant P. aeruginosa infection have a poor\nprognosis and it is therefore increasingly\nimportant that close attention is paid to\nP. aeruginosa strains displaying severe drug\nresistance. Unfortunately, our study showed\nthat the percentage of MDR P. aeruginosa\nstrains in our burn ward had increased\npresented a significantly increasing trend in\nresistance rates to amikacin, cefoperazone/\nsulbactam, imipenem and meropenem. The\nresistance rates to ceftazidime and cipro-\nfloxacin were also increased from 2012 to\n2014. Extensive use of antibacterial agents\ngradually leads to bacterial resistance.15,16\nWe speculate that the observed increased\nresistance rates may result from the con-\ntinuous and significant overuse of these\nantibiotics; and for ceftazidime and cipro-\nfloxacin, this overuse appeared to be rela-\nWe further assessed the correlation\nbetween intensity of use of ceftazidime or\nciprofloxacin, and the resistance rates of\nP. aeruginosa. Our results revealed that the\nintensity of use of ceftazidime was not\nsignificantly correlated with the resistance\nrates of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime, and the\nintensity of use of ciprofloxacin was nega-\ntively correlated with the resistance rates of\nP. aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin. These find-\nings do not contradict the association of\ndrug resistance and use intensities of these\ntwo antibiotics because it may take time to\nincrease P. aeruginosa resistance upon anti-\nbacterial overuse. For cefoperazone/sulbac-\ntam, the intensity of use positively correlated\nwith the cefoperazone/sulbactam resistance\nrate, indicating that resistance levels to\ncertain antibiotics may increase without\ndelay in P. aeruginosa.\nThe different timings for the appearance\nof drug resistance following drug overuse\nin P. aeruginosa may be attributed to\nthe different antibiotic mechanisms. Drug\nresistance mechanisms in P. aeruginosa\ninclude: inactivating or inhibitory enzymes,\nincreased active efflux pump system expres-\nsion, changing target of antibacterial agents,\nbiofilm formation, and loss or decreased\nResistance mechanisms of P. aeruginosa\nto ciprofloxacin mainly include mutations\nin DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV\n(encoded by the gyrA and parC genes,\nrespectively).31 It takes time for mutations\nto occur and spread within a bacterial\npopulation, which may account for the\ndelayed drug resistance we observed.\nExposure to ciprofloxacin may also increase\nexpression of the active efflux pump system\nin P. aeruginosa, as a rapid stress response.\nSuch resistance mechanisms often induce\nP. aeruginosa resistance to a variety of\nantibacterial agents.13,32 In agreement with\nthis, we found that the intensity of use of\nciprofloxacin was positively correlated with\nthe resistance rates of bacteria to other\nantibiotics such as amikacin, cefoperazone/\nsulbactam, imipenem and meropenem.\nP. aeruginosa resistance to cefoperazone/\nsulbactam has likely increased active efflux\npump system expression and biofilm forma-\ntion.33 Consistent with this, the intensity of\nuse of cefoperazone/sulbactam was also\nfound to be positively correlated with the\nresistance rates of bacteria to amikacin,\nimipenem, meropenem and cefoperazone/\nsulbactam itself. Extensive use of ciprofloxa-\ncin or cefoperazone/sulbactam may thereby\nenable transformation of bacteria to MDR\nor XDR forms.\nIt is also worth noting that there are other\nsources of antibacterial agents. For example,\nantibacterial agents are sometimes added to\nfoods, such as milk,34\u00ad36 and it is conceivable\nthat the regular consumption of such foods\nmay contribute to antibiotic resistance.\nTherefore, in the face of serious levels of\nantibiotic resistance,37\u00ad39 it is important to\nconsider all possible contributory factors.\nA few limitations of this study should be\nmentioned. First, this retrospective study\nonly collected data for bacteria and anti-\nbiotic use from one hospital ward, and did\nnot record the clinical characteristics and\ndemographic features of patients, which\nmight have impacted on bacterial resistance.\nSecond, bacterial specimens were not sub-\njected to molecular identification and hom-\nology analyses. Third, it was impossible to\ndistinguish nosocomial from community-\nacquired infections, which might lead to\nexcessive resistance rates. Furthermore, this\nwas only a retrospective descriptive analysis,\nin which no control group was included, no\nintervention was applied for antibacterial\nagent use, and bacterial resistance variations\nwere not analysed after intervention. These\nlimitations should be considered when inter-\npreting the data, and further studies are\nwarranted to clarify these issues.\nBased on our findings, we conclude that\nanti-bacterial treatment strategies in burn\ndepartments should focus on Gram-negative\nbacteria, especially P. aeruginosa and\nK. pneumoniae, for which the prevalence\nrates are increasing year by year. The use of\nciprofloxacin, ceftazidime and cefopera-\nzone/sulbactam should be limited to counter\nthe increase in resistance of P. aeruginosa\nto these agents and other common anti-\nGram-negative antibiotics. These findings\nalso confirmed that it is insufficient to only\nmonitor bacterial prevalence in burn\nwards when selecting appropriate therapy.\nAntibiotic use and the corresponding resist-\nance status of bacteria must also be con-\nsidered to ensure the rational use of\nantibacterial agents and the development\nof effective therapeutic strategies.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
