Successful\naging is dependent upon the ability to preserve mobility-\n\nrelated functioning and avoid disability. Both have important\nimplications for the utilization of healthcare, nursing home\nadmissions, and mortality (2). The goal of minimizing disabil-\nity and chronic disease provides researchers with an incentive\nto identify lifestyle, health, and social factors that may impact\nphysical functioning ability in older adults (1).\nAging is often associated with anthropometric changes, such\nas increased abdominal adiposity and decreased skeletal mus-\ncle mass (3). Recent evidence on distributions of BMI indicates\nthat ~64% of adults age 65 and over are either overweight or\nof adults over age 80 have sarcopenia, \"defined as appendicular\nskeletal muscle mass two standard deviations below the mean\nof a young reference group\" (5). These changes in body com-\nposition may be a factor in the degeneration of physical func-\ntioning, and contribute to the disability that is frequently seen\nin late life. Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that sar-\ncopenia and obesity may act synergistically to exacerbate the\nnegative effects of each other both behaviorally and \nbiologically\n(6). The decreases in physical activity that typically accompany\naging may trigger muscle atrophy as well as \ncreating an energy\nsurplus resulting in excess fat accumulation. Furthermore,\nindividuals with sarcopenic obesity--low muscle mass cou-\npled with the burden of carrying excess weight--may be at\nthe greatest disadvantage regarding physical functioning (6).\nBaumgartner et al. reported that nondisabled older adults with\nsarcopenic obesity were over twice as likely to report subse-\nquent instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) disability as\nwere nonobese sarcopenic individuals (7).\nThe Impact of Insulin Resistance and\nInflammation on the Association Between\nSarcopenic Obesity and Physical Functioning\nMorgan E. Levine1 and Eileen M. Crimmins1\nAge associated increases in visceral adiposity and decreases in muscle mass (sarcopenia) have been shown to\ncontribute to disability in late life. Furthermore, there is evidence that obesity-related physiological states, such as\ninsulin resistance and systemic inflammation, may exacerbate physical functioning problems. Both conditions have\nbeen shown to prompt hypercatabolism and impair the anabolic effect of muscles, ultimately stimulating protein\nbreakdown and suppressing muscle synthesis. This cross-sectional study investigates whether insulin resistance and\ninflammation partially account for the associations between decreased physical functioning and sarcopenic obesity.\nSubjects include 2,287 males and females aged 60 and older without diagnosed diabetes from the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 1999\u00ad2004). Body composition measurements indicating waist circumference\nand appendicular skeletal muscle mass, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), were used to\nconstruct four body composition categories--healthy, sarcopenic nonobese, nonsarcopenic obese, and sarcopenic\nobese. Physical functioning was measured using self-reports of difficulty performing six activities. The homeostasis\nmodel assessment (IR\nHOMA\n) was used to measure insulin resistance, while inflammatory state was assessed through\nmeasurement of serum C-reactive protein (CRP). Modified Poisson regression models were used to examine the\nassociation between physical functioning and body composition, and to evaluate whether differences in insulin\nresistance or inflammation partially explained this relationship. In the analysis, we controlled for possible confounders\nsuch as age, education, sex, height, and race/ethnicity. Findings suggest that physical functioning problems are\nincreased in those with sarcopenic obesity, sarcopenic nonobesity and nonsarcopenic obesity. Furthermore, these\nassociations may be influenced by differences in insulin resistance among different body composition phenotypes.\n1Department of Gerontology, Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA. Correspondence: Morgan E. Levine\n(canon@usc.edu)\narticles\n \nInsulin resistance often occurs with abdominal obesity and\nhas been shown to prompt metabolic breakdowns of skeletal\nmuscle, which may manifest clinically as sarcopenia. When\nsarcopenia was defined as muscle mass per unit weight, sar-\ncopenic obese adults were found to have greater levels of insu-\nlin resistance than adults who were either solely sarcopenic or\nsolely obese, regardless of sex (8). Furthermore, diabetes mel-\nlitus, a condition associated with hyperglycemia resulting from\nimproper insulin secretion and/or action necessary to maintain\nmetabolic homeostasis, has also been shown to impair physi-\ncal functioning in older individuals. A case\u00adcontrol study by\nSinclair et al. showed that when compared to controls matched\nby age and sex, diabetics had significantly reduced physical\nfunctioning and were more likely to require mobility aids such\nas wheelchairs and walking sticks (9).\nThe association between abdominal obesity and insulin\nresistance is influenced by an overproduction of inflammatory\ncytokines--protein molecules involved in systemic inflam-\nmation and immunological responses--which are released\nfrom adipose tissue cells (10). Like insulin resistance, excess\ncytokine production has been shown to impact sarcopenia by\npromoting the deterioration of skeletal muscle fiber diameter\nand protein content, as well as disrupting muscle force pro-\nduction and fatigue resistance (11,12). While proinflamma-\ntory cytokines have been found to positively associate with fat\nmass, Cesari et al. showed that they may be inversely related\nto muscle mass as well (13). Additionally, a study by Schrager\net al. showed that older community-dwelling obese individuals\nwho possessed low muscle strength also had elevated levels of\nboth C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (14).\nIn this study, we examine a nationally representative sample of\nUS citizens over the age of 60 (15) in order to investigate whether\ninsulin resistance and systemic inflammation partially account\nfor the associations between decreased physical functioning and\nsarcopenic obesity. Based on previous research, we hypothesize\nthatindividualswhoaresarcopenicobesewillhavecompromised\nphysical functioning and that this association will be explained,\nin part, by high levels of CRP and increased insulin resistance.\nMethods and Procedures\nStudy population\nThe study population was comprised of males and females aged 60 and\nolder from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nstudy conducted by the US National Center for Health Statistics\n(NCHS) (15). In NHANES individuals over age 60, African Americans,\nMexican Americans, and low-income white Americans are over sam-\npled to provide appropriate sample sizes for analysis. Sampling weights\nprovided by NHANES are used in estimating frequencies and means, as\nwell as during our regression analysis and mean comparisons to make\nthe results representative of the total noninstitutionalized population.\nance with the formula suggested by NHANES: WT99-04 = ((2/3) \u00d7\nData were collected from at-home interviews and clinical examina-\ntions, which took place at a Mobile Examination Center (MEC). Because\nfasting is required for valid measurement of plasma glucose and serum\ninsulin, the subsample used in analysis included individuals who\nattended the morning laboratory exam and who had fasted for 8\u00ad12h\nprior. Because individuals with diagnosed diabetes were not asked to\nfast, they are excluded from the study. The number of eligible partici-\ncompleted data for the primary outcome variable or blood measures\nand were included in our analysis. Anthropometric data measurements\nfor body composition measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry\n(DXA), weight, and waist circumference were determined during the\nclinical examination. Because of the potential for nonresponse bias in\nthe use of only cases with information from the DXA scans, imputed\ndata were used in analysis as developed and recommended by NHANES\n(15). The NHANES files contain five sets of imputed data for each eligi-\nble participant with missing DXA data. The sample size of 2,287 includes\nimputed data for 626 cases. While only one record was used in calculat-\ning sample sizes, all five records were used in analyses to insure more\naccurate variance estimates as recommended by NHANES. Further\ndetails of recruitment, procedures and study design are available through\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (15).\nBody composition\nBody composition measurements included waist circumference,\nweight, and appendicular skeletal muscle mass. Body weight was meas-\nured using standardized procedures and equipment and was recorded\nto the nearest 0.01kg by electronic scale. Waist circumference was\nmeasured to the nearest 0.1cm starting on the right side of the body\nat the iliac crest. Measurements for regional bone, fat and lean-tissue\ncontent were collected by whole body DXA scans. We estimate muscle\nmass using measurement of appendicular muscle which is the predom-\ninant skeletal muscle type involved in physical activity and mobility and\nhas been shown to account for over 75% of total body skeletal muscle\n(16). Appendicular muscle mass was estimated from the sum of the\nDXA measurements for the arms and legs as a ratio of total body mass\n(appendicular muscle mass/body mass \u00d7 100) (8). This formulation has\nbeen found to more closely relate to metabolic syndrome than when\nmuscle mass is related to height (ASM/Ht2) (8). We believe this measure\nbetter represents the muscle proportion of body mass, which is a central\ncomponent of our underlying hypothesis.\nSubjects with an ASM <2 SD below the mean of a young reference\ngroup, which included males and females ages 20\u00ad40 from NHANES\nrable means and standard deviations for younger subjects have been used\nas reference group cut-points in previous literature (8,17). Obesity was\ndefined as waist circumference >102cm for males and 88cm for females\n(18). Based on these cutoffs, four categorical groups were created--solely\nsarcopenic, solely obese, sarcopenic obese, and normal. Because muscle\nmass and waist circumference are also related to height, we included\nheight (in cm) as a control during analysis.\nPhysical functioning problems\nPhysical functioning was determined by self-reports of difficulty per-\nforming six Nagi tasks--walking a quarter of a mile; walking up ten\nsteps;stooping,crouchingorkneeling;standingforlongperiodsoftime;\nstanding up from an armless chair, and lifting or carrying heavy objects.\nThese items represent an index of mobility and strength that in a fac-\ntor analysis of 11 physical functioning items had factor loadings >0.60.\nWithin our sample a Cronbach's  of.893 was found for the six physical\nfunctioning items. For each item, respondents were asked whether they\nhad no, some, or much difficulty or were unable to perform the task\nwith scores for each item ranging from 0 to 3. Respondents who refused\nto answer or said that they did not know were considered missing. The\nsum of these six scores was then taken to create an overall measure of\nphysical functioning, ranging from 0 to 18.\nInsulin resistance and inflammation\nThe homeostasis model assessment (IR\nHOMA\n) was used to measure insu-\nlin resistance and calculated using the formula: fasting serum insulin\narticles\n \n(U/ml) \u00d7 fasting plasma glucose (mmol/l)/22.5 (19). Inflammatory\nstate was measured by CRP, a nonspecific indicator of general levels of\ninflammation. High-sensitivity CRP assays were performed on blood\nsamples using a Behring Nephelometer for quantitative CRP determi-\nSociodemographic characteristics\nSelf-reports of age, race/ethnicity, and education were used as control\nvariables, as they have been found to relate to functioning ability (2).\nAge was measured in years and was top-coded at 85 in the NHANES\npublic use data to avoid identification of study participants. Dummy\nvariables were created to classify race/ethnicity into three categories:\nnon-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics, with non-\nHispanic whites used as a reference category. Education was reported\nin five categories indicating years of school completed. Subjects were\ncoded to the midpoint of their respective reported categories (partici-\npants who had less than a 9th grade education were coded as 7 years).\nThose who had attended high school, but received no diploma were\ncoded as 10.5 years. Those participants who received high school diplo-\nmas, General Education Diplomas or equivalent were coded as 12 years.\nParticipants who attended college but did not receive 4 year degrees\nwere coded as 14 years, and participants who received 4 year degrees\nand above were coded as 17 years.\nStatistical analysis\nSAS statistical software package version 9.2 was used for all analy-\nses. Before testing the hypothesis we assessed the association between\npotential confounds using Pearson Correlation and multicollinear-\nity variance inflation factor and found multicollinarity to be within\nacceptable levels (variance inflation factor <2.5 and tolerance >0.40).\nAll analyses were run utilizing weights provided by NHANES. Mean\ncomparisons were run to examine differences in IR\nHOMA\nand CRP\nbetween the four body composition groups using a Bonferroni adjust-\nment to decrease the risk of a type I error. Because our dependent\nvariable is a count of the number of functioning problems, we used a\nmodified Poisson regression with robust error variances in our analy-\nsis (20). Three sequential equations were used to first, examine the\nassociation between physical functioning and body composition, and\nthen to evaluate whether differences in insulin resistance in the second\nmodel and differences in inflammation in the third model partially\nexplain this relationship. Based on the coefficients from the Poisson\nmodels, prevalence ratios (PRs) (relative risks), and 95% confidence\nintervals (CIs) were calculated. All analyses were done controlling for\npossible confounders including age, race/ethnicity, sex, height, and\neducation.\nResults\nSample description\nTable 1 lists the descriptive characteristics of the sam-\nple. Just over half of the participants were female (56.2%).\nMost of the sample were non-Hispanic white (81.6%). Non-\nHispanic blacks and Hispanics each made up 7.1 and 8.9% of\nsample members respectively, while subjects of other race/\nethnic accounted for 2.4% of the sample. Mean education\nMean IR\nHOMA\nMost participants had relatively good physical functioning;\nthe mean sample score for functioning problems was 3.2,\nwith scores ranging from 0 to 18.\nApproximately one-third (37.2%) of the participants met\ncriteria for classification as having healthy body composition,\n3.6% were solely sarcopenic; 10.4% were sarcopenic obese and\nlargest percentage (48.8%) were solely obese.\nMeans for age, physical functioning, ASM, waist circumfer-\nence, insulin resistance, and CRP are provided by body com-\nposition category in Table 2. Sarcopenic nonobese subjects\nwere the oldest (77.8 years), followed by healthy subjects (71.0\nyears), sarcopenic obese subjects (70.9 years), and lastly non-\nsarcopenic obese subjects (69.7). Overall, sarcopenic nonobese\nsubjects had the most physical functioning problems (8.2), fol-\nlowed by those who were sarcopenic obese (4.4), nonsarco-\npenic obese subjects (3.1), and healthy (2.4). When stratified\nby sex, sarcopenic obese subjects had the highest waist circum-\nference in both males and females. Sarcopenic nonobese were\nfound to have the lowest muscle mass; however, it was practi-\ncally equivalent to the ASM found among the sarcopenic obese\ngroup.\nSubjects who were sarcopenic obese also had the high-\nest insulin resistance (mean IR\nHOMA\n= 6.1), followed by solely\nobese subjects (4.5), solely sarcopenic subjects (3.1), and lastly,\nsubjects who were neither obese nor sarcopenic (2.2). Multiple\nmean comparisons using a Bonferroni adjustment showed that\nthe four groups were all significantly different mean IR\nHOMA\ncompared to one another. The highest CRP levels were found\namong those who were solely sarcopenic (10.6mg/l), followed\nTable 1Sample characteristics for subjects aged 60 and\nolder\nEthnicity, (%)\n Non-Hispanic black 7.1\n Other race/ethnicity 2.4\nIR\nHOMA\nBody composition, (%)\n Sarcopenic nonobese 3.6\nCRP, C-reactive protein; IR\nHOMA\n, homeostasis model assessment.\naPhysical functioning was determined by self-reports of difficulty performing six\nNagi tasks--walking a quarter of a mile; walking up 10 steps; stooping, crouch-\ning or kneeling; standing for long period of time; standing up from an armless\nchair, and lifting or carrying heavy objects. For each item, respondents were\nasked whether they had no, some, or much difficulty or were unable to perform\nthe task with scores for each item ranging from 0 to 3. Respondents who refused\nto answer or said that they did not know were considered missing. The sum of\nthese six scores was then taken to create an overall measure of physical func-\ntioning, ranging from 0 to 18.\narticles\n \nby those who were sarcopenic obese (6.3mg/l), nonsarcopenic\nobese (5.3mg/l), and finally those who were neither obese nor\nsarcopenic (4.6mg/l). Mean comparisons showed that all four\ngroups had statistically distinct means for CRP, except for the\ntwo obese groups which did not significantly differ from one\nanother.\nAssociations of body composition on physical functioning\nproblems\nGiven that the results from the regression analysis were found\nto be very similar for both sexes and no interaction was found\nwhen analyzing the data, regressions were run without strati-\nfication by sex. Nevertheless, analysis was run using sex as\na control rather than a stratification variable, which did not\nsignificantly alter any of our results when compared to sex-\nspecific findings. Table 3 shows the results from the three\nPoisson regression models. In all three models the omitted or\nreference category for the regression was the healthy group\nof subjects--those who are neither sarcopenic nor obese. In\nmodel 1, sarcopenic obesity, sarcopenic nonobesity and non-\nsarcopenic obesity had significant (P < 0.05) positive associa-\ntions with physical functioning problems. The PRs indicate\nthat physical functioning problems were 91% more likely for\n58% more likely for sarcopenic nonobese subjects (PR: 1.58;\nP = 0.002) relative to the healthy reference group. In addition,\nincreased age, lower education, being female, and being black\nor Hispanic were also associated with having more physical\nfunctioning problems.\nInfluence of insulin resistance and inflammation over\nthe association between body composition and\nphysical functioning\nIn model 2, when controlling for IR\nHOMA\n, physical function-\ning problems were still significantly more prevalent in the\nthree adverse body composition groups. Additionally, IR\nHOMA\nwas found to positively relate to physical functioning.

The sum of these\nsix scores was then taken to create an overall measure of physical functioning,\nTable 3 Prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals for\nassociations of body composition on physical functioning\nproblems\nRelative risk (95%CI)\nSarcopenic\nobese\nSolely\nsarcopenic\nIR\nHOMA\nCRP, C-reactive protein; IR\nHOMA\n, homeostasis model assessment.\nModel 1 examines the association between physical functioning and body com-\nposition, adjusting for confounders such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, education,\nand height.

One mg/l increment in CRP\nlevel was associated with a 1% increase in the PR of physical\nHowever, unlike insulin resistance, CRP did not significantly\nalter the power of any of the body composition groups to pre-\ndict functioning problems.\nDiscussion\nOur findings suggest that physical functioning problems are\nhigher in those with sarcopenic obesity, nonsarcopenic obes-\nity, and sarcopenic nonobesity. Furthermore, the association\nbetween physical functioning problems and both obesity\ngroups, with and without sarcopenia may be related to vari-\nations in insulin resistance. The findings regarding body\ncomposition and functioning are consistent with the work of\nBaumgartner et al. which concluded that sarcopenic obesity\nin older adults is associated with lower physical capacity in\ncomparison with normal/healthy older adults (7). The asso-\nciation between body composition and physical ability may be\na result of several factors which work to exacerbate function-\ning problems in the sarcopenic obese phenotype. First, age-\ndependent adoption of a sedentary lifestyle may contribute\nto added fat accumulation and muscle atrophy. Second, func-\ntioning problems may arise as a result of added strain on mus-\ncles and joints due to excess weight. Or third, excess adiposity\nmay impair muscle mass and quality on a physiological basis\nthrough mechanisms influenced by systemic inflammation\nand metabolic dysfunction. In the present study, the finding\nthat subjects who were either sarcopenic obese or nonsarco-\npenic obese were found to have worse physical functioning\nthan those who were neither sarcopenic nor obese, may be\npartially due to variations in insulin resistance among the body\ncomposition groups. Obesity, primarily in the midsection,\nhas been found to associate with an increased risk of insulin\nresistance, which may in turn exacerbate the development of\nsarcopenia and disability with aging. It has been hypothesized\nthat obesity-related insulin resistance may impair the anabolic\neffect of insulin to suppress protein breakdown and stimulate\nmuscle synthesis (21,22), resulting in a progressive decreases\nin skeletal muscle mass.\nFurthermore, the finding that obese subjects without sar-\ncopenia are at greater risk of functioning problems than\ntheir nonobese counterparts could be due to adverse mus-\ncle composition, which may not be apparent when meas-\nuring muscle mass. Goodpaster et al. found that adipose\ntissue which has infiltrated skeletal muscle mass is signifi-\ncantly associated with insulin resistance in obese subjects\n(23), while Visser et al. showed that increased fat infiltration\nwithin muscles was associated with poorer lower extremity\nperformance (24). As a result, in future studies muscle com-\nposition may be an important component in understanding\nthe association between sarcopenia, obesity, disability, and\ninsulin sensitivity.\nFinally, although the inclusion of CRP did not significantly\nalter the association between physical functioning and body\ncomposition, further investigation is needed. It has been sug-\ngested that a key characteristic of sarcopenia is a heightened\ninflammatory state, due to increased cytokine production and\noxidative stress (25). However, our null findings with regards\nto sarcopenic obesity, sarcopenic nonobesity, and nonsarco-\npenic obesity--states that should be signaled by even greater\nlevels of inflammation--may be due to our use of muscle mass\nrather than strength in conceptualizing sarcopenia. In a study\nby Schaap et al., higher levels of CRP and IL-6 were found to\nbe significantly associated with reductions in muscle strength\nbut not with reductions in muscle mass (26).\nThere are several limitations in the present study. First, the\nuse of cross-sectional data hindered our ability to test for medi-\nating factors or the temporality of our associations. Second,\nour physical functioning variable relied solely on self-report\nmeasures. This is noteworthy because reports of functioning\nability can be influenced by mood, opinion, apprehension,\ncondition, and strength (27). Consequently, this may alter the\nimpact of sarcopenia and obesity on the variable being exam-\nined. Fourth, the use of imputed data on measures for mus-\ncle mass could be considered a limitation even though this is\nthe procedure recommended by NCHS. Nevertheless, analysis\nrun excluding imputed subjects yielded comparable results to\nthose reported. Fifth, CIs between the three body composition\ngroups overlapped indicating that these three groups did not\nhave distinctly different associations with physical function-\ning problems. Despite these limitations, the present study is\nstrengthened by the use of reliable techniques for measur-\ning body composition, biomarkers to measure insulin resist-\nance and inflammation, and t a large nationally representative\nsample.\nThe current study demonstrated that insulin resistance is an\nimportant factor in the association between abdominal obesity,\nwithandwithoutsarcopenia,andphysicalfunctioning.Because\nfunctional disability is related to greater rates of injury, loss\nof independence, chronic conditions, cognitive degeneration\nand decreased life expectancy, it is essential for policy makers\nto work towards the implementation of programs and strat-\negies that promote healthy aging and facilitate the reduction\nin metabolic dysfunction and sarcopenic obesity among older\nadults (28\u00ad31). In moving forward, further research using lon-\ngitudinal data is needed to uncover the mechanisms that are\ndriving the progression of sarcopenic obesity and mediating its\nrelationship with disability and disease.\n"
