In an effort to decrease cancer risk among the population, national\nhealth objectives for the year 2000 included recommendations to decrease intake\nof dietary fat and alcohol and increase intake of fruits, vegetables, and grains. The\npurpose of this article is to assess trends in the intake of these dietary components\nrelative to the national health objectives.\nMETHODS. National food supply data and food consumption survey data were\nreviewed for their appropriateness for monitoring intake trends. Recent data from\nboth sources are described and interpreted.\nRESULTS. Americans have made modest but important improvements in their diets\nin recent years and may meet the \"Healthy People 2000\" dietary objectives aimed\nat decreasing cancer risk. Intake of fruits, vegetables, and grains are higher, and\nthose of fat and alcohol are lower than they were at the beginning of the decade.\nThese trends are consistent with recent improvements in mortality rates for those\ncancer sites with the strongest associations with diet: the colon/rectum, prostate,\nand breast.\nCONCLUSIONS. Although the average intake of fruits, vegetables, and grain products\nis higher, it should be noted that the objective represents the minimum recom-\nmendations. Within each of these major food groups, further improvements can be\nmade. In addition, special efforts should be made to guide children toward im-\nprovements in their diets and to monitor the diets of children and other subgroups.\nKEYWORDS: diet surveys, fruit, vegetables, grains, dietary fat, alcohol, dietary\ntrends, cancer.\nThe association between dietary factors and cancer risk has been\nestablished for many years. In a landmark review, Doll and Peto\nestimated that 35% of all cancer deaths are attributable to diet1,2 and\nmore recent analyses have further substantiated their claim.3\u00ad5 Fruits,\nvegetables, and grains appear to be protective, whereas fat and alco-\nhol appear to increase the risk for developing a number of cancers. In\nlight of this and other evidence supporting healthy changes in the\nAmerican diet, national health objectives for the year 2000 (\"Healthy\n\"Increase complex carbohydrate and fiber-containing foods in\nthe diets of people aged 2 and older to an average of 5 or more\ndaily servings for vegetables (including legumes) and fruits, and\nto an average of 6 or more daily servings for grain products.\"\n\"Reduce dietary fat intake to an average of 30 % of calories or\nless . . . among people aged 2 and older.\"\n\"Reduce alcohol consumption by people aged 14 and older to an\nannual average of no more than 2 gallons of ethanol per person.\"\nIn 1992, Byers reviewed the trends in fruit, vege-\ntable, grain, and fat intakes leading up to the late\n1980s, and discussed the relevance of these trends to\ncancer prevention.8 The purpose of this article is to\nextend those trend lines, using more recently available\ndata, and include data regarding alcohol consump-\ntion.\nMETHODS\nData Sources\nThe U. S. diet is monitored through a variety of data\nsources, collectively referred to as the National Nutri-\ntion Monitoring and Related Research Program\n(NNMRRP). These data sources include measures of\nfood use and nutrient availability at the retail level and\nof food consumption and nutrient intake at the indi-\nvidual level. Each measure has its own purposes, ad-\nvantages, and disadvantages, and when examined to-\ngether they begin to form a picture of dietary intakes\nin this country. The logo used on all NNMRRP mate-\nrials--an abstract mosaic with many pieces filled in,\nyet some of them missing--conveys our current un-\nderstanding of that picture.\nFood Supply Data\nFood supply data are aptly called \"food use\" or \"dis-\nappearance\" data because they represent the quanti-\nties of foods and nutrients that disappear into the\nretail distribution channels each year.9 The data are\nderived by first summing together the total quantities\nof foods produced in this country, inventories remain-\ning from the past year, and all imported food. Sub-\ntracted from this are current year-end inventories,\nexported food, and food used for nonfood purposes.\nThe resulting quantities of foods, reported in terms of\npounds per person per year, are assumed to be used\nfor human consumption. Nutrients available from the\nfood supply then are determined by multiplying the\nnutrient value per pound times the quantity of each\nfood and summing each nutrient across all foods.\nThe word \"consumption\" commonly is used in\nconjunction with food supply data, although it can be\nmisleading because the data represent consumption\nin an economic sense only, not a dietary one. \"Con-\nsumption\" in a dietary sense infers that the food is\ningested, yet food supply measurements are made\nwell before the point of ingestion. Estimates of food\nuse are made at the point of purchase and therefore\ninclude inedible refuse such as bones, trimmable fat,\nand peelings. Nutrient estimates for the food supply\nrepresent only the edible components of foods, but\nthey still include nutrients that subsequently may be\nlost in cooking and parts of the food that may be\nthrown away or fed to pets. Thus, food supply data\nrepresent an upper bound on the amount of foods and\nnutrients ingested. They can be used to indicate\ntrends in consumption, but only if changes in food\nproduction or consumer behavior over time \"do not\nalter the relative disparity between food disappear-\nance and food actually eaten.\"10 As long as these char-\nacteristics of food supply data are recognized, they can\nbe a useful adjunct to survey data in monitoring the\nnation's collective diet. In this article, they have been\nexamined as a source of data on trends in the con-\nsumption of fruits, vegetables, and grain products.\nSurvey Data\nFood consumption, in a dietary sense, is monitored via\nsurveys of individuals. Twenty-four hour dietary recalls,\nin which respondents are asked to recount the foods\nthey ate on the previous day, are the primary method of\ngathering such information in the NNMRRP. Although\nrepresenting a more direct measure of food consump-\ntion than food supply data, recalls are exceedingly more\ncomplex, and comparisons across different surveys\n(even those conducted at the same point in time) can be\nproblematic due to methodologic and database differ-\nences.\nAlthough the major surveys in the NNMRRP all\nwere designed to be nationally representative, differ-\nences in the number of days of data collection, the\nsampling frames, the days of the week included, the\ninterviewing and coding methods, and the nutrient\ndatabases used can all affect the results obtained dra-\nmatically.11 For example, when trends in nutrient lev-\nels are being assessed, it is critical that the nutrient\ndatabases used for different points in time are com-\nparable, except when there were real differences in the\nnutrient values of foods.12 That is, updated values\nbased on improved analytic methods should be sub-\nstituted for outdated values in the older database, but\nreal differences in the food between the two time\nperiods, such as the level of trimmable fat on cuts of\nmeat, should be maintained. In addition, when food\ngroup intakes are being monitored over time, the way\nfoods are quantified and grouped must be comparable\nto ascertain trends. In spite of these caveats, surveys\nstill provide some of the most revealing data available\nfor piecing together a picture of the U. S. diet over\ntime. Furthermore, the Agriculture Research Service of\nthe U. S. Department of Agriculture is developing a\nfood composition database for trend analyses that,\naccording to the Expert Panel on Nutrition Monitoring\nand Related Research, will address these concerns and\n\"provide a sound framework for comparisons of data\ncollected at different time points from 1985 on-\nThe major surveys in the NNMRRP are the Na-\ntional Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys\n(NHANES), conducted by the Department of Health\nand Human Service's National Center for Health\nStatistics, and the Nationwide Food Consumption\nSurveys (NFCS) and Continuing Surveys of Food\nIntakes by Individuals, conducted by the U.

For this reason, it generally\nis accepted that sales data should be used to monitor\napparent alcohol consumption.15 These data are col-\nlected by the Alcohol Epidemiologic Data System. To\ncompare data across years with differing proportions\nof beer, wine, and spirits, intakes of all these various\nbeverages are converted to gallons of ethanol,16 and\nrates per capita are based on the population age  14\nyears. Although these data cannot be examined in\nrelation to demographic variables because they refer\nto the population as a whole, they relate directly to the\nhealth objective and are useful in monitoring trends.\nRESULTS\nDietary Fat\nAssessment of long term trends in fat intakes in the\nU. S. has been hampered by the fact that the two\nsurveys conducted during the late 1970s (the NFCS\nand the NHANES II) provided conflicting estimates of\nfat intake as a percent of kilocalories.17 NHANES II\nestimates were approximately 36% for the total popu-\nlation, whereas NFCS estimates were approximately\n40%. There are numerous methodologic differences\nbetween the two surveys that could account for the\ndifference in estimated fat intakes.11 Since then, there\nhas been a concerted effort to make the data from the\ntwo major food consumptions survey series (the\nNHANES and the NFCS and related surveys) more\ncomparable, and recent data are more analogous.\nHowever, the result of the earlier discrepancy is that\nthe two series show slightly different trends in the\npercentage of kilocalories from fat. Both show a de-\ncline,18\u00ad23 although the linear trend for the NHANES\nappears more gradual (Fig. 1).\nIn contrast, food supply data imply a slight in-\ncrease in fat intakes in recent decades. However, over\nthe years, there has been an increased use of fats and\noils for frying, and much of those fats and oils\n(amounts not absorbed by the food during prepara-\ntion) are discarded.10 Because of this, time trends in\nfood supply levels of fats and other macronutrients do\nnot reflect survey estimates of intake, especially when\nmacronutrients are measured as a percentage of en-\nFruits, Vegetables, and Grains\nFood supply data are optimal for examining long term\ntrends in fruit, vegetable, and grain consumption be-\ncause, unlike fat, the proportion of these foodstuffs\nthat is discarded has not changed much over the\nyears, and because the basic methodology of the food\nsupply data has remained constant over time. Figure 2\nwhich all 3 groups showed statistically significant in-\ncreases in per capita consumption: fruits by 22%, veg-\netables by 19%, and grain products by 47% (P \nAlthough food supply data give an indication of\nlong term trends in consumption of these foods, they\ncannot be used to infer how close the population is to\nmeeting the health objective because they are not\nreported in comparable terms (i.e., servings of food\nobjective. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\nseries and the Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS) and related\nsurveys both show a decline in the percentage of kilocalories from fat, although\nthe NHANES trend appears more gradual. 1 One-day data from individuals ages\n2\u00ad74 years (unpublished data). 2 One-day data from individuals of all ages.20\n3 One-day data for individuals ages 6 months-74 years.18 4 One-day data for\nindividuals age  2 months.19 5 One-day data for individuals age  2 years.21\n6 One-day data for individuals age  2 years.22,23 Statistical significance of\ntests for linear trend: National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys: P \n0.15 and the Nationwide Food Consumption Surveys and related surveys: P \nFIGURE 2.

Only recently have estimates of fruit, vege-\ntable, and grain servings been based on all intakes of\nthese foods, including the quantities contained in food\nmixtures and on food specific gram weights per serv-\ning.25\u00ad28 Average intakes by adults are shown in Figure\nobjective for the year 2000. The data suggest that for\nfruits, vegetables, and grains, intakes have risen sig-\nnificantly (P  0.0005) since the objective was written\nand that achievement of the objective appears likely.\nThe health objective aimed at fruits and vegeta-\nbles ( 5 servings) and grain products ( 6 servings) is\nderived from more specific recommendations con-\ntained in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans,29\nwhich suggest 2\u00ad4 servings of fruits, 3\u00ad5 servings of\nvegetables, and 6\u00ad11 servings of grains, depending on\nenergy needs. That is, it generally is regarded that\nthere are certain optimum proportions that these ba-\nsic food groups should comprise in the diet, and that\nthe number of servings should increase accordingly\nwith increasing energy needs.30 Also shown in Figure 3\nare comparisons with the recommendations in cur-\nrent dietary guidance (extension of bars). It appears\nthat intakes of fruits, vegetables, and grains will need\nto continue to rise to meet even the midpoint of these\nenergy-based recommendations.\nThe proportional increases observed in these data\nare not directly comparable to those observed in food\nsupply data because the latter are measured in\npounds, the former are measured in servings, and the\nbroad groups of fruits, vegetables, and grains encom-\npass a wide array of foods with varying weights per\nserving. Nonetheless, the two data sources are consis-\ntent in suggesting a gradual increase in the consump-\ntion of fruits and vegetables in recent years.\nAlcohol\nFigure 4 presents national consumption trends for all\nthe changes needed to meet the health objective of \n1980s ushered in a period of decreased alcohol con-\nsumption, the first sustained decline since Prohibition\nended. Other than a single year (1990) in which sales\nrose in reaction to tax law changes, and another year\n(1992) with no change, this downward trend has con-\ntinued unabated (statistical significance of test for lin-\nperson per year was the lowest since 1964.\nDISCUSSION\nThese data suggest Americans have made modest but\nimportant improvements in their diets in recent years\nand that, if current trends continue, they may meet\nthe \"Healthy People 2000\" dietary objectives aimed at\ndecreasing cancer risk. These trends are consistent\nwith recent improvements in mortality rates for the\ncancer sites for which the strongest associations with\ndiet have been demonstrated: the colon/rectum, pros-\ntate, and breast,31\u00ad33 although other factors such as\nthe \"Healthy People 2000\" objective, and the range of recommendations in\ndietary guidance. The mean number of servings of all three groups have\nincreased significantly since the health objective was written, and achievement\nof the \"Healthy People 2000\" objective appears likely. However, current dietary\nguidance suggests average intakes should be even higher. 1Mean daily serv-\nings for all persons age  2 years.

Alcohol consumption has declined since the\nearly 1980s, and the health objective appears achievable. 1Based on population\nDietary Progress to Reduce Cancer Risk/Krebs-Smith 1429\nscreening and treatment also may have contributed to\nthe decline in mortality.\nThe downward trend in fat intakes described in\nthis article is supported by a collective analysis of data\nfrom 171 independent studies conducted by Stephan\nand Wald34 that was undertaken to examine the role of\ndiet in the decline in coronary heart disease mortality.\nAll studies of healthy individuals conducted in the\nassessed from food records, were included, except\nstudies including only vegetarians. The values from\neach study (for fat intake as a percentage of kilocalo-\nries) were weighted by the number of persons in each\nstudy and plotted along with a regression line. The\nauthors reported that fat intakes rose from approxi-\nthen fell to approximately 36% of kilocalories in the\nearly 1980s. Similar trends were observed when these\nanalyses were repeated for separate age and gender\ngroups. These meta-analyses were not restricted to\nstudies using representative samples of the U. S., a fact\nthat casts some uncertainty on the generalizability of\nthe results. The authors included studies of very nar-\nrowly defined groups, such as athletes, pregnant and\nlactating women, and specific income and racial\ngroups. However, as the authors state, there is \"no\nconvincing evidence that any of these conditions in-\nfluences the balance of intake of the three major nu-\ntrients.\"\nBecause fruits, vegetables, and grains are the ma-\njor sources of dietary fiber, trends in intakes of that\ndietary component further substantiate the trends in\nintakes of these food groups. Data regarding intakes\nby adults show an increase of 11 g to 16 g of fiber from\nis below the National Cancer Institute recommenda-\nThese improvements in diet in part may be a\nfunction of several governmental initiatives designed\nto enhance the diet in these areas. In the late 1980s,\nregulations concerning food advertisements were\neased to allow food producers to make more explicit\ndiet/health claims. A drop in the consumption of fats\nand oils across the population followed this change in\nthe regulatory environment.36 The Nutrition Labeling\nproduction of fat free, low fat, and reduced fat prod-\nucts.\nThe National Cancer Institute's partnership with\nthe Produce for Better Health Foundation, designed to\nincrease fruit and vegetable intake through the 5 A\nDay for Better Health Program, has helped to encour-\nage individuals to consume more fruits and vegetables\nthrough its 1000 industry participants in the fruit\nstores across the nation.38 In addition, there are  55\nstate and territorial health agencies licensed with the 5\nA Day for Better Health Program. The national part-\nnership works at the community level through state-\nwide coalitions involving both industry and state lic-\nensees.\nAlthough data suggest that average intakes of fruit,\nvegetable, and grain products now may be sufficient\nto meet the health objective, it should be remembered\nthat the objective represents the minimum dietary\nguidance recommendations. Mean intakes should be\ncloser to the middle of the range, concomitant with\nthe range of energy intakes in the population. Further-\nmore, outside the realm of measuring the health ob-\njective, there is wide variation in what is considered a\nfruit or vegetable. A recent report by the American\nInstitute for Cancer Research suggested that potatoes\nprepared in any way should not be considered vege-\ntables and bananas and plantains should not be con-\nsidered fruits.39 Excluding potatoes, fruit and vegeta-\nble intakes averaged 3.2 servings per person per day in\nbles were potatoes in 1994 as in the earlier years,\nCertainly, further improvements could be made\nwithin the major food groups that were considered in\nassessing progress toward meeting the health objec-\ntive. Vegetable use is dominated by potato use:  50%\nof the potatoes marketed in this country eventually are\neaten as french fries.9,25 Nutrient dense vegetables\nsuch as broccoli, other dark green vegetables, and\ncarrots represent only a small fraction of vegetable\nconsumption.9\nFruit intakes, which were approximately one and\nmeet even the minimum dietary guidance recommen-\ndations of 2 servings per day. Not only is fruit a rich\nsource of fiber and nutrients, it appears to be an\nimportant, if not indispensable, part of diets that de-\nrive  30% of their energy from fat.40 It may be sim-\npler, and certainly would be more positive, to promote\nincreasing intakes of fruit than decreasing intakes of\nfat as a percentage of energy; if the latter can be\naccomplished (at least in part) with the former, that\nwould appear to be beneficial.\nThe declines observed in ethanol consumption\nappear to be due largely to a sharp decrease in the use\nof spirits. Per capita consumption of beer and wine\nwere approximately the same in 1993 compared with\nFinally, although the population on average ap-\npears primed to meet these objectives if current trends\ncontinue, there most certainly are subgroups for\nwhich more intensive intervention is needed. The di-\nets of children in particular warrant attention; a recent\nstudy found that 11% of U. S. children ages 2\u00ad19 years\ndid not meet any of their daily food group recommen-\ndations over a 3-day period and that 50% of the energy\nin children and adolescents diets came from fat and\nadded sugars.27,41 Because diet in childhood may be\nan important factor in adult dietary habits,42 efforts\nshould be made to guide children toward improve-\nments in their diets and to monitor the diets of chil-\ndren and other subgroups.\nREFERENCES\n1.
