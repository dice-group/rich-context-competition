The measured concentrations of aldosterone also showed high correlation (r = 0.9790) but were\nmarkedly higher in plasma.\nConclusion: The measurements of DRC, and to a lesser extent PRA, were similar regardless of temperature condition\nduring the 20\u00ad30 minutes necessary for blood sample processing. Aldosterone concentrations in plasma vs serum samples\nappeared to be markedly higher.\n",

To investigate whether the results of aldosterone\nconcentration measured in serum and EDTA2\nK\nplasma are similar and can be referenced to the\nsame reference values.\nMaterial and methods\nForty-seven patients with an indication for testing the renin-\nangiotensin-aldosterone system had blood collection after a\nnight's rest in the supine position (0hr) and again after\nwalking for two hours (2hr). At each collection, blood was\nwithdrawn into two EDTA2\nK tubes (plasma) and one with a\nclot activator (serum). After blood collection, one tube was\ntransported to the laboratory in a cool state (within 10 min-\nutes) and the other tube at ambient (room) temperature\n(also within 10 minutes). The cooled at +4\u00b0C blood sample\nthe not cooled sample was centrifuged at ambient (room)\nrial (serum, EDTA2\nK-plasma) was frozen at \u00ad30\u00b0C and\nstored until assayed.\nAldosterone was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA)\n(ZenTech, RIAZENco, Belgium). Analytical sensitivity\nwas 1.4 ng/l, functional sensitivity was 25 ng/l. The refer-\nence value at rest was 10\u00ad160 ng/l, and in the upright posi-\ntion was 35\u00ad300 ng/l.

The standard 90-minute\nincubation time at 37\u00b0C was applied for generation of angi-\notensin I. Analytical sensitivity was 0.1 ng/ml per hour. The\nreference value at rest in the supine position was 0.2\u00ad2.8\nng/ml per hour, and in the upright position was 1.5\u00ad5.7 ng/\nml per hour.

The median serum aldosterone concentra-\nconcentration in plasma (EDTA2\nDiscussion\nIn the past, blood samples for PRA have been collected and\ntransported to laboratories on ice and centrifuged at 2\u00ad4\u00b0C\nto avoid enzyme activation and uncontrolled initiation of\nangiotensin I production.\nReports of possible renin cryoactivation at low tem-\nperature led to initial confusion and the suggestion that\nblood samples should be processed at room temperature.\nThis controversial question was therefore further\ninvestigated.\nBrossaud and Corcuff showed that PRA decreased\nsignificantly when blood samples were stored for five\nhours at room temperature as compared to +4\u00b0C stor-\nage.7 They stated that within that period enzyme degra-\ndation at room temperature was more important than\npotential cryoactivation, and decided to maintain sample\nprocessing at +4\u00b0C.\nSimilarly, Locsei et al. showed that PRA and direct renin\ndecreased significantly when blood samples were kept at\nroom temperature for two hours before processing, but they\nchanged only marginally if blood samples were placed at\n0\u00ad5\u00b0C for the same period of time.8\nFrom our study it appears that when processing blood\nsamples, cool or room temperature during the initial 20\u00ad30\nminutes has no significant effect on the results of direct\nrenin, and to a lesser extent, on PRA. Therefore, a refriger-\nated centrifuge is not necessary at the site of blood draw-\ning, if the blood samples can be further processed either in\nambient or cool conditions within 20\u00ad30 minutes in the\nlocal laboratory. Otherwise, according to suggestions by\nLocsei et al., they could be placed at 0\u00ad5\u00b0C and trans-\nported to a laboratory in less than two hours8 or possibly\nquickly centrifuged and transported frozen on dry ice.\nA limitation of this part of our study is that we have\ntested only blood samples processed within 20\u00ad30 min-\nutes and that in the PRA assay we applied only the stand-\nard 90-minute incubation time for generation of\nangiotensin I.\nA comprehensive and detailed review concerning meth-\nodology of PRA and DRC and precautions necessary to\nensure accuracy of these assays was presented by Campbell\nDetermining aldosterone seemed simpler and less prob-\nlematic.

Therefore we were\nsurprised by the results of our study comparing the aldos-\nterone concentrations in serum and in EDTA-plasma sam-\nples obtained from the same subjects at the same time. We\nobserved that using the RIA-CT assay the measured aldos-\nterone concentrations in plasma samples were markedly\nhigher than in serum samples, and these differences ranged\nConfirmation of our observation can be found in the\nstudy by Taylor et al., who measured aldosterone in plasma\nand serum using high-performance chromatography and\ntandem mass spectrometry.
