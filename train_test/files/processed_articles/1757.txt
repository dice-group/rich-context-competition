    "abstract": "Abstract\nSignificant public health problems associated with methamphetamine\n(MA) production and use in the United States have emerged over the\npast 25 years; however, there has been considerable controversy about\nthe size of the problem. Epidemiological indicators have provided a\nmixed picture. National surveys of the adult U.S. population and school-\nbased populations have consistently been used to support the position\nthat MA use is a relatively minor concern. However, many other data\nsources, including law-enforcement groups, welfare agencies, substance\nabuse treatment program admissions, criminal justice agencies, and\nstate/county executives indicate that MA is a very significant public\nhealth problem for many communities throughout much of the coun-\ntry. In this article, we describe (a) the historical underpinnings of the\nMA problem, (b) epidemiological trends in MA use, (c) key subgroups at\nrisk for MA problems, (d ) the health and social factors associated with\nMA use, (e) interventions available for addressing the MA problem, and\n( f ) lessons learned from past efforts addressing the MA problem.\nClick here for quick links to\nAnnual Reviews content online,\nincluding:\n\u00b7 Other articles in this volume\n\u00b7 Top cited articles\n\u00b7 Top downloaded articles\n\u00b7 Our comprehensive search\nFurther\nANNUAL\nREVIEWS\nEstimates of use and abuse of metham-\nphetamine (MA) in the United States come\nfrom several epidemiological sources that have\npresented a mixed, controversial picture of the\nproblem. Statistics from the most widely cited\nsurveys, including the National Survey on Drug\nUse and Health (NSDUH) and the Monitor-\ning the Future study (MTF) have consistently\nshown that MA use is a relatively minor con-\ncern among both adult and youth school-based\npopulations (43, 96). Specifically, trends in the\npercentage of past-year MA use among persons\n12 years and older has remained relatively sta-\nof persons aged 12 and older who had used\nMA for the first time within the past year)\nshown a decline in the annual prevalence of\nMA use among youth in eighth, tenth, and\ntwelfth grades since 1999. Annual prevalence\nrates of MA use among secondary students in\ntenth graders, and 1.2% for twelfth graders,\nwhich are down considerably from rates in\nClearly, these national-based surveys are a\nvaluable source of information on illicit drug\nuse among the general population; however,\nindividuals with illicit drug\u00adrelated problems,\nespecially MA users, are often encountered on\nthe streets or in jails or prisons, in delinquent\ncamps and juvenile group homes, in hospitals\nand emergency rooms, in publicly funded treat-\nment facilities, and in other informal systems\nthat provide social services. Fortunately, many\nother data methods routinely collect informa-\ntion about MA use and address national survey\nlimitations to provide a more complete picture\nof MA use trends in the United States.\nData from other epidemiological indica-\ntors, such as the Drug Abuse Warning Net-\nwork (DAWN), sponsored by the Substance\nAbuse Mental Health Services Administra-\ntion (SAMHSA), the National Institute on\nDrug Abuse's Community Epidemiology Work\nGroup (CEWG), and SAMHSA's Treatment\nEpisode Data Set (TEDS), provide useful infor-\nmation related to MA-related emergency room\nepisodes at hospitals, MA-related criminal jus-\ntice encounters and referrals to jail, and MA-\nrelated admissions to publicly funded treatment\nfacilities. Data from these sources (during the\nthat contrasts with that portrayed by the na-\ntional survey data (75). Foremost, admission\ndata from publicly funded treatment facilities\nlicensed by the 50 state drug abuse agencies that\nreceive federal funds demonstrate gradually es-\ncalating trends in MA use in the United States\nthrough the 1990s and well into the twenty-first\ncentury (see Figure 1) (97). Additionally, data\nreported by DAWN, which provides statistical\nestimates of drug-related visits to emergency\ndepartments for 21 metropolitan areas across\nthe United States, indicate rising MA-related\nvisits (71). Furthermore, MA use has been a sub-\nstantial problem for the criminal justice system\nas reflected by law-enforcement data, includ-\ning arrests and seizures at the local level (67).\nand local law-enforcement agencies cited MA\nas their greatest drug threat (66).\nSince 2006, these data sources have begun\nto show stabilizing or downward trends in MA\nuse at the local level (56), as reflected by law-\nenforcement data (arrests and seizures) and\nemergency room data from 20 of 22 metropoli-\ntan areas. Similarly, as shown in Figure 1, treat-\nment admissions for MA showed a decline in\n2006 for the first time. The wave of MA prob-\nlems that penetrated most U.S. states during\nthe past decade and a half has been closely\nlinked to the availability of the ingredients\nneeded to make MA (77); such availability has\nbeen halted through recent strict federal pre-\n\u00b7Mooney\n\u00b7Rawson\nU.S. admissions to publicly funded substance abuse treatment programs for primary methamphetamine\nabuse/dependency between 1995 and 2007. From Substance Abuse Mental Health Service Administration\n(SAMHSA), Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS), 2009 (Reference 97).\nrestricting retail sales of MA's main ingredient,\npseudoephedrine.\nAs with national surveys, despite the util-\nity of these other data indicators to understand\ncomprehensively the scope of the MA problem\nin the United States, caution should continue\nto be taken when interpreting or making in-\nferences from the data, particularly given the\nvariations in the way data are collected and re-\nported by various data systems and agencies.\nOverall, multiple data sources should be con-\nsidered when attempting to understand the na-\nture and scope of a drug problem (95), as well\nas to inform the focus and development of pre-\nvention and treatment efforts.\nDespite recent trends, MA still remains a\nmajor public health problem in the United\nStates (15). In addition, a growing area of\nconcern has been the increasing trends of MA\nuse globally. Epidemiological data from several\ncountries, including regions of Southeast and\nEast Asia (i.e., Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia,\nMalaysia, and the Philippines), Canada,\nAustralia, South Africa (i.e., Cape Town),\nand parts of Europe (e.g., Czech and Slovak\nrepublics) indicate that MA production, traf-\nficking, and use are steadily increasing (14, 28,\n58). Given the continuing, though somewhat\nstabilizing, use of MA in the United States and\nthe growing trends in use internationally, MA\nuse remains a primary focus of current drug\npolicy and treatment efforts both domestically\nand internationally (66).\nThe accessibility and availability of the in-\ngredients used in MA production have been\nmajor contributors to the MA problem in\nthe United States because MA is manufac-\ntured using readily available retail products\n(e.g., pseudoephedrine, hydrochloric acid, red\nwww.annualreviews.org \u00b7 The U.S. Methamphetamine Problem 387\nphosphorus, ether, etc.), and numerous recipes\non how to produce MA are widely available on\nthe Internet (27). Although there are increasing\nreports of the growing misuse of pharmaceuti-\ncal amphetamines (methylphenidate, Adderall,\nand Concerta) (51, 57) particularly among col-\nlege students, the vast majority of amphetamine\nthat is abused illicitly is manufactured MA.\nThe MA problem has evolved over time.\nUse of amphetamine-type stimulants (ATSs),\nincluding MA, in the United States predates\nWorld War II. Amphetamine tablets were ex-\ntensively used by soldiers on all sides of the con-\nflict during World War II to reduce fatigue and\nera of extensive drug experimentation, use of\nATS pills became problematic among young\nadults, especially college students. Increased\nrates of amphetamine injection brought with it\nserious medical and psychiatric consequences,\nprompting the drug prevention slogan, \"Speed\nkills.\" The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Pre-\nvention and Control Act of 1970 sharply lim-\nited the accepted medical uses for prescribed\namphetamines, which served to reduce greatly\nthe ATS problem in the United States during\nlimited to a few circumscribed geographic areas\nin California and Oregon, where MA continued\nto be manufactured illicitly, mostly by motor-\ncycle gangs. Their practice of carrying MA in\nthe crankcases of their motorcycles led to the\nslang term \"crank\" for MA.\nIncreased problems associated with MA\nresurfaced in the 1980s as motorcycle gangs\nbegan to produce much larger amounts and\nexpand their customer base in Southern\nCalifornia and Oregon. Through the 1980s,\nMA use was fairly limited to Caucasian men,\nmany of whom were truck drivers, construction\nworkers, and other blue-collar workers. The\ntypical route of administration was intranasal.\nDuring this same period, MA use in Hawaii be-\ngan to increase dramatically, particularly on the\nisland of Oahu, as a new form of MA called\nIce began to be imported into the state from\nthe Philippines and Southeast Asia. This crys-\ntallized form of MA was heated and inhaled as\na vapor, and as users discovered the increased\nintensity of euphoria produced by the smoked\ndrug, smoking became the dominant route of\nadministration for MA in Hawaii and subse-\nquently throughout the United States.\ndistribution of MA expanded in two major\nways. MA cooking in mom-and-pop home\nlaboratories became widespread throughout\nCalifornia and other West Coast states, as\nwell as in Oklahoma, Missouri, and the Rocky\nMountain states. Because these labs are eas-\nily detectable by the strong odor produced in\nMA production, the expansion of MA produc-\ntion and use became concentrated in rural ar-\neas where labs were less detectable. At the same\ntime, large laboratories, called superlabs, that\nproduced much larger quantities of MA de-\nveloped in Southern California and Northern\nMexico. MA from these labs was distributed by\nMexican drug trafficking groups to key distri-\nbution points in the West and Midwest, includ-\ning Salt Lake City, Oklahoma City, and Des\nMoines. The expansion of the MA supply by\nthese two sources resulted in the availability of\nmassive quantities of MA throughout the West\nand Midwest at very low prices.\nIn 2004, many state governments began to\npass laws restricting the sale of the primary\nMA precursor, pseudoephedrine, to reduce the\ndomestic production of MA and prevent the\nongoing spread across populations and com-\nmunities. The purchase of over-the-counter\ncold and sinus preparations containing pseu-\ndoephedrine became limited in a number of\nways. In most states, the number of packages\nof these medications that could be purchased\nat one time was restricted, some states took the\nmedications completely off the open counter\nand put them behind the counter, and other\nstates required purchasers to show identifica-\ntion and sign for their pseudoephedrine prod-\nucts. In 2005, the federal government passed\nthe Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act,\nwhich placed federal regulations on the sale of\nproducts containing pseudoephedrine and fur-\nther reduced its availability for use in MA man-\nufacture. These precursor control efforts have\n\u00b7Mooney\n\u00b7Rawson\nsignificantly decreased the availability of MA in\nmany parts of the United States and have re-\nsulted in dramatic increases in the street price\nAs inexpensive MA availability increased\nthrough the western half of the United States,\nthe demographic profile of MA users expanded\nto include Latinos, Asian/Pacific Islanders,\nNative Americans, gay and bisexual men, of-\nfender populations, women, and adolescents (6,\ncreased availability of MA became apparent in\nthe Southeastern United States after 2000, and\nby 2005, high rates of MA use were reported in\nalmost all parts of the United States, except for\nthe Northeastern corridor.\nMen Who Have Sex with Men\nElevated rates of MA use have been reported in\nmany men who have sex with men (MSM) com-\nmunities throughout the United States, with\nassociations to high-risk sexual behaviors that\nincrease the transmission of communicable\ndiseases, including increased numbers of ca-\nsual and anonymous sexual partners, decreased\ncondom use, sex trading, group sex, more fre-\nquent and longer sexual episodes, and anal in-\nbetween MSM, MA use, and infectious disease\ninfection is a significant public health issue in\nthe United States because MSM populations\nare the only behavioral risk group experienc-\ning an increase in the incidence of HIV and\nother sexually transmitted infections (91). HIV\nincidence in MSM averages 1.6% per year and\ndiffers geographically (9, 89). Incidence rates of\nHIV are tripled for MSM who use MA com-\npared with nondrug-using MSM (8). Within\nthis group, MA use is also associated with el-\nevated levels of sexually transmitted infections,\nsuch as syphilis (4%) (109). A recent report by\nthe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention on the connection between MA use,\nhigh-risk sexual behavior, and infectious dis-\nease transmission in MSM communities sug-\ngests that this combination of factors poses a\nmajor threat of a renewed increase in rates of\nHIV infection among MSM (10). Furthermore,\nrisk of HIV infection is exacerbated among MA\nusers with a history of infection with other sexu-\nally transmitted infections, such as genital gon-\norrhea, genital herpes, and hepatitis B (88).\nWomen\nUnlike many other illegal drugs, MA is a drug\nthat appeals equally to men and women. Among\ntreatment samples of MA users, data indicate\nthat nearly as many women enter treatment\nfemale youth are more likely to use MA than\ntheir male youth counterparts (26, 78). Un-\nlike men, women tend to report that their\ninitial MA use stemmed from the desire to\nlose weight or to cope with depression. MA\nuse by pregnant women can jeopardize the\nhealth of their unborn children (108). One\nstudy found that pregnant MA-using women\nhad a 3.5-times greater likelihood of hav-\ning a lower-birth-weight child and preterm\nbirths than did non-MA-using pregnant women\nMA-using women are more likely to report\nprevious exposures to trauma, including phys-\nical and sexual abuse (61), as well as to suf-\nfer from psychological distress, including mood\ndisorders and suicidality (22), than are MA-\nusing men. This is especially true for MA-using\nwomen offenders (60). MA use also plays a ma-\njor role in domestic violence (7). MA use is\ninvolved in almost 90% of the domestic dis-\npute cases investigated across the United States\n(102). Although both men and women MA\nusers report increased sexual desire while un-\nder the influence of MA (78), men tend to ex-\nperience greater sexual enhancements and de-\nsires that have been linked to more unusual\nand riskier sexual acts (7). In qualitative inter-\nviews with MA-using women, Brown et al. (7)\nfound that violence and coercion tend to occur\nin MA users' relationships, particularly because\nwww.annualreviews.org \u00b7 The U.S. Methamphetamine Problem 389\nMA-using males may demand riskier sexual acts\nof their female partners and may be unwilling\nto accept a refusal.\nCriminal Offenders\nMA use has been a significant problem for the\ncriminal justice system. MA abuse is highly as-\nsociated with criminal and violent behaviors\n(19) that tend to result in increased incarcer-\nations and other problems within the crimi-\nnal justice system (18). In fact, the majority of\ncounty law-enforcement agencies report that\nMA is the primary drug problem among of-\nfenders (49), with men and women reporting\nuse at fairly equal rates. This notion is further\ndemonstrated by the share of MA-related treat-\nment admissions referred by the criminal justice\nsystem, which is 50% higher than admissions\nfor other substances of abuse (96).\nMA is a potent stimulant with high abuse po-\ntential and can be smoked, snorted, injected, or\ntaken orally. The desirable short-term effects\nof MA, or the initial rush, are characterized by\nincreased energy and alertness, an elevated pos-\nitive mood state, and decreased appetite (76).\nCompared with other stimulants (e.g., cocaine\nand nicotine), the half-life of MA is quite long,\nAs a central nervous system stimulant, MA\nfacilitates the release of norepinephrine and\ndopamine from nerve terminals and, to a lesser\nextent, blocks their synaptic reuptake (47).\nThe resulting catecholamine surge mediates\nmany of the acute symptoms and physiological\nchanges associated with MA intoxication, in-\ncluding elevated heart rate and blood pressure\n(69). By constricting blood vessels and depriv-\ning tissues of oxygen, excess circulating nore-\npinephrine may contribute to organ damage.\nLikewise, the oxidation of accumulated cate-\ncholamines may lead to the formation of re-\nactive oxygen species and subsequent cellular\nChronic MA use is associated with seri-\nous medical conditions affecting multiple or-\ninclude chest pain, arrhythmias, hypertension,\ncardiomyopathy, and acute myocardial infarc-\ntion, even in relatively young users (45, 99,\n107). Autopsy studies have demonstrated in-\ncreased frequencies of accelerated coronary\nartery disease and cardiac hypertrophy in MA\nusers relative to controls (44). Elevated rates\nof electrocardiogram abnormalities, including\nprolonged QTc (corrected QT) interval, have\nalso been documented in studies of MA users\nIn a recent investigation of MA-related\nemergency department visits (N = 353), the\nmost common presentations associated with\nMA use were mental health problems (18.7%),\ndental pathology (9.6%) (32). Seizures and\nstroke have also been reported in the context\nof MA intoxication in both emergency depart-\nMA-related neurological complications include\nmovement disorders; during intoxication, users\nmay exhibit hyperkinetic movements, repetitive\nor stereotyped behaviors, (55, 94), or choreo-\nAn association between MA use and severe\ndental disease, known as \"meth mouth,\" has\nbeen highlighted in recent literature (13, 64).\nPutative mechanisms of MA-related tooth de-\ncay include xerostomia (i.e., dry mouth), ex-\ncessive soft-drink consumption, poor oral hy-\ngiene, and the acidic composition of the drug\n(48). In addition, dermatologic manifestations\nof MA use have been found to result from self-\ninflicted injury during intoxication, infection\nfrom repeated injection, or accidental burns\nduring the process of MA manufacture. MA\nusers may repeatedly scratch or pick at their skin\nin the context of drug-induced perceptual dis-\nturbances such as formication, or the sensation\nof insects crawling on or underneath the skin\nPrior studies have demonstrated MA-\ninduced neurotoxicity to dopaminergic path-\nways in the brain, particularly after high doses\n\u00b7Mooney\n\u00b7Rawson\nTable 1 Health consequences of methamphetamine use\nCardiac effects Psychiatric effects Neurologic effects Other physiological effects\nChest pain Paranoia Headache Skin ulcerations\nTachycardia Hallucinations Seizures Dermatological infections\nHypertension Depression Stroke Dental caries\nArrhythmias Anxiety Cerebral vasculitis Anorexia\nMyocardial infarction Insomnia Hyperkinetic movements Pulmonary hypertension\nCoronary artery disease Suicidality Neurocognitive impairment Pulmonary edema\nCardiomyopathy Aggression Hyperthermia\nPoor quality of life Fetal growth restriction\nHepatitis C and HIV\nor chronic use (86). Investigators have observed\nin MA abusers reductions in striatal dopamine\ntransporter activity (DAT), which may be clin-\nically associated with cognitive deficits and\nslowed motor function (104). According to\nrecent estimates, up to 40% of MA users\nexhibit global neuropsychological impairment\n(83). Significant neurocognitive deficits related\nto frontostriatal and limbic circuits in the\nbrain have been observed, including in exec-\nutive functions, memory, attention, language,\npsychomotor functions, and visuoconstruction\ntivity and cognitive functioning may partially\nrecover with sustained abstinence from MA\nIn addition to physical health consequences,\nMA use is associated with a range of psychi-\natric manifestations. The most common psy-\nchiatric symptoms experienced by MA users\ninclude anxiety, depression, and psychosis (23,\n110), and the severity of these symptoms may\nbe related to the quantity and/or frequency of\nMA use, the route of administration, and in-\ndividual differences in sensitivity to the drug\n(31). MA-induced psychotic symptoms, which\nmimic those of schizophrenia, include paranoid\nideation, delusions, and auditory and visual hal-\nlucinations. Psychotic symptoms occur tran-\nsiently in a substantial proportion of MA users\n(59) and, along with other psychiatric symp-\ntoms, typically subside within a week of absti-\nnence (69). However, in a subset of users, psy-\nchosis may persist for several months or longer\nintoxicated, users may become agitated or\ntreatment-seeking users have reported a history\namined differences in health-related quality of\nlife between a normative U.S. population and a\nMA-dependent, treatment-seeking sample and\nfound that the MA sample reported substan-\ntially lower mental health status perceptions\nthan did the normative U.S. population (25).\nTable 1 presents a summary of health factors\nassociated with MA use.\nMA use poses significant public health chal-\nlenges to health care professionals, social\nservice providers, policy makers, and the law-\nenforcement community. In a recent economic\nassessment, MA use cost the United States\ncluded costs associated with morbidity and\nmortality, criminal justice and social welfare\nservices, environmental clean-up from MA\nchemical production, and most significantly,\nlost productivity and reduced quality of life\n(71). The social harms experienced by neigh-\nborhoods from systemic violence (trafficking\nand dealing) and MA production are tremen-\ndous. The manufacture and production of MA\nrequire chemicals that are explosive, corrosive,\nand flammable and that can result in burns,\nrespiratory ailments, poisoning, and fires. In\none California county, 15% of the MA labs\nwww.annualreviews.org \u00b7 The U.S. Methamphetamine Problem 391\nidentified by law enforcement were found be-\ncause of fires (36). Further, because manu-\nfacturing of MA also occurs in automobiles\n(including trunks), there is an increased oppor-\ntunity for distribution and spills of toxic wastes\nand chemicals into the environment, which can\npollute ground water sources (36). Given the\nnexus that exists between MA use and criminal\ninvolvement (19), criminal records and jail sen-\ntences result in the loss of access to social wel-\nfare benefits (40) and lost quality of life, as well\nas economic hardships for the offender's family\nand foster care exposure for their children (34).\nFurthermore, because MA use in particular\nhas been linked to many psychiatric difficul-\nties, such as depression, irritability, insomnia,\nparanoia, and aggressive behaviors, it presents\na particularly serious risk for neglect and abuse\nto the children in these environments. Accord-\ning to the Impact of Meth on Children survey\nby the National Association of Counties, which\nMA is a major cause of child abuse and ne-\nglect: 40% of child welfare officials reported\nan increase in out-of-home placements because\nof MA in 2005. Moreover, MA use results in\nincreased child abuse crimes (68, 74). This in-\nformation is concerning because neglected and\nabused children are at risk of social, emotional,\ndevelopmental, and behavioral problems dur-\ning childhood and adolescence, as well as cogni-\ntive, psychological, and permanent brain dam-\nage or physical impairments (16, 33), and even\nFurthermore, these young children are ex-\nposed to MA, a highly psychoactive stimulant,\nand the toxic precursor chemicals associated\nwith its production, exposures that undermine\ntheir health and well-being (85). In almost\nDrug Enforcement Agency, over one third had\nchildren under the age of 15 years present (85).\nAcute agitation with paranoid ideation is the\nmost common emergency department presen-\ntation of MA intoxication. In many cases,\ntreatment does not require the use of medica-\ntions, but rather a brief treatment intervention\nor referral to specialized treatment. When med-\nications are employed, the choices are usually\nbetween a benzodiazepine and an antipsychotic.\nTraditionally, haloperidol in 5 mg parenteral\nrepeated doses is used, often in combination\nwith 1\u00ad2 mg of lorazepam and 1 mg of the\nanticholinergic benztropine. Patients receiving\nhaloperidol alone tend to experience more ex-\ntrapyramidal reactions (2). It remains unclear\nwhether benzodiazepine or neuroleptic medi-\ncations should be preferred in the treatment of\nMA-induced agitation. No specific treatments\nfor MA psychosis have been established, and\nprotocols similar to those used for MA acute\nintoxication described above are the most com-\nmonly used approaches.\nResearch collected over the past two decades\nhas demonstrated, to a large extent, that psy-\nchosocial treatment for MA dependency is ef-\nfective, resulting in measurable and desirable\nchanges in drug use and other social behaviors\ncompared with no treatment (77). Interventions\nthat have been found to be effective in empirical\ntests include cognitive behavioral interventions\nthat focus on self-efficacy skill building and re-\nlapse prevention (11, 79), contingency manage-\nment approaches that provide motivational in-\ncentives for demonstration of desired nondrug\nuse behaviors (84), stepped care for transition-\ning MA users through continued treatment lev-\nels based on need (46), and drug court for MA-\ndependent offenders (39, 54). To date, there are\nno approved pharmacological treatments for\nMA dependency (63); however, several treat-\nments show potential, including bupropion (17,\nAttempts to break the cycle of drug use and\ncrime have included providing drug treatment\nto offenders while in prison. The most common\ntreatment modality used in prisons is the ther-\napeutic community (TC). In California specifi-\ncally, MA-using offenders are supported by the\nSubstance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act\n(SACPA), also known as Proposition 36, which\nquires that nonviolent adult drug offenders be\n\u00b7Mooney\n\u00b7Rawson\noffered treatment in lieu of incarceration. Since\nfenders have received SACPA treatment each\nyear, the majority of whom are MA users\nMA users are seen as some of the most dif-\nficult drug treatment patients, owing to pro-\ntracted physiological and psychological prob-\nlems caused by the drug's impact on neural\npathways. Factors related to successful treat-\nment outcomes among MA users include lower\nlevels of MA use at treatment admission (fewer\nthan 15 days of MA use out of the previous 30),\nshorter histories of MA use (2 years or less), re-\ntention in treatment for at least 90 days, and pe-\nriods of abstinence during treatment of at least\nies examining risk factors for poor treatment\noutcomes among MA users have identified\ncontinued MA use during treatment, injection\nuse, having less than a high-school education,\nyoung age at treatment admission, having a\ndisability (4, 35), polydrug use (5), childhood\ntrauma and abuse (61), and having an under-\nlying psychiatric disorder (22, 24). Continued\ntreatment participation and active recovery ef-\nforts, including frequent 12-step program par-\nticipation, have been associated with successful\ntreatment outcomes among MA users over time\nIMPLICATIONS\nThe serious MA problem that evolved in the\nUnited States over the past 20 years has signifi-\ncantly impacted the public health, social wel-\nfare, and criminal justice systems and offers\nmany lessons for public health policy in the\nUnited States and other countries.\nFirst, there needs to be an adequate epidemi-\nological assessment system in place to bring\nemerging drug problems to the attention of\npublic health officials and policy makers. The\ncurrent U.S. epidemiological monitoring sys-\ntem is not adequate to fully identify and recog-\nnize emerging drug problems, as was witnessed\nby the slow recognition of the seriousness of the\nMA problem. MA use emerged as a small local\nproblem and spread exponentially from west to\neast over a 20-year span without a coordinated\nfederal response.\nSecond, an effective monitoring system\nshould incorporate public health indicators and\ndata from multiple systems including criminal\njustice agencies (both police departments and\ncorrectional facilities), the educational system,\nsocial welfare agencies, and the primary care\nand mental health systems to adequately iden-\ntify specific subgroups and geographical com-\nmunities that are impacted.\nThird, a coordinated national response\nshould include comprehensive prevention and\ntreatment programming. Prevention efforts\nfor MA in the United States have been\nsparse and regional (i.e., Montana, Kansas, and\nCalifornia). Only during the past few years have\nprevention efforts for MA been initiated at the\nnational level.\nFourth, the response to the needs of ad-\ndicted individuals should be based on a public\nhealth approach as opposed to a criminal jus-\ntice approach. Tens of thousands of MA users\nfilled prisons in the Western and Midwestern\nUnited States long before there was an orga-\nnized and meaningful response from the public\nhealth system.\nCONCLUSION\nThis article has provided a critical examination\nof the development of the MA problem in the\nUnited States, including patterns and trends in\nMA use and key characteristics of high-risk sub-\ngroups, as well as interventions that have been\nused to address the problem. It is unlikely that\nMA will disappear from the landscape of drug\nabuse problems challenging U.S. systems at the\nfederal, state, and local levels. The few tar-\ngeted efforts aimed at reducing and/or prevent-\ning the MA problem over the past two decades\nclearly demonstrate that a strategic program of\nresearch, prevention, and treatment must be de-\nveloped and continuously funded to address the\nMA problem adequately.\nwww.annualreviews.org \u00b7 The U.S. Methamphetamine Problem 393\nThe authors are not aware of any affiliations, memberships, funding, or financial holdings that\nmight be perceived as affecting the objectivity of this review.\n1.
