Several neurotransmitters (dopamine,\n-aminobutyric acid, norepinephrine, serotonin), peptides,\nand amino acids are involved in the regulation of food\nintake (4). Among them, dopamine attracts particular inter-\nest because this neurotransmitter seems to regulate food\nintake by modulating food reward by the mesolimbic cir-\ncuitry of the brain (5,6).\nthe five types of dopamine receptors. Pharmacological ev-\nidence implicates the DRD4 gene in obesity. Clozapine,\nwhich binds with high affinity to DRD4 (7), can lead to\nincreased food consumption and subsequent weight gain,\nboth of which are associated with increased leptin produc-\ntion (8). A functional VNTR (variable number of tandem\nrepeats) polymorphism has been identified in the third exon\nin the DRD4 gene (9). The genetic variant is a 16-amino\nacid repeat polymorphism, which is repeated 2 to 11 times,\nwith four repeats being by far the most common allele\n(9,10). The in vitro studies suggest that the exon III DRD4\n7-repeat allele (7R) has decreased affinity for dopamine and\ntransmits weaker intracellular signals in comparison with\nother exon III alleles (11).\nIn adults, there is a consistent and inverse relationship\nbetween PA and body mass (12\u00ad15), whereas the relation-\nship in youth is more complex (16). A positive association\nhas been shown between SB and obesity in youth and adults\nSES and body mass/risk of obesity are found to be inversely\nrelated in industrialized countries (24\u00ad26). Ball et al. (26)\nshowed that men living in housing of lower quality (e.g., living\nin rental properties and/or with fewer bedrooms) and women\nwith lower employment indices (e.g., part-time workers and/or\nin lower status occupations) had higher BMIs. Drewnowski\nand Specter (27) suggested that the mechanism between SES\nand obesity involves the shifting of limited economic re-\nsources toward an energy-dense diet that provides the max-\nimum calories for the cost. Energy-dense diets are likely to\ncontain added sugars and fats, and such diets are more\naffordable than are diets based on lean meats, fish, fresh\nvegetables, and fruit. The identification of social factors and\nthe mechanisms governing their relationship with obesity\nrisk is critical for the development of effective interven-\ntions, to address social inequalities, and to halt the rapid\nincrease in obesity particularly in low SES groups.\nResearch Methods and Procedures\nSubjects\nThe data source for our analysis is the sibling subsample\nof 2600 participants from Add Health, a school-based\nstudy of the health-related behaviors of adolescents in\nStates (1). The Add Health participants were interviewed\nsample of Add Health (monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins,\nand full siblings) because DNA measures are currently only\navailable for this subset of the Add Health sample. Our\nanalysis sample consisted of 2284 individuals measured at\npean American, African American, and Hispanic American,\nrespectively (Table 1). Asians (n  190) were excluded\nbecause no Asians were homozygous for 7R of DRD4.\nOverweight and Obesity Measures\nAdd Health has collected three waves of overweight and\nobesity data. The height and weight measures were self-\nreported in Wave I and both self-reported and measured in\nWaves II to III. Our analysis used Wave-I self-reported, and\nWaves II to III measured weight and height. In a small\nnumber of cases (1.8%), the missing measured body\nweights and heights at Waves II and III are replaced by\nself-reported weights and heights. Goodman et al. (28)\nreported a strong correlation between measured and self-\nreported height (0.94) and between measured and self-\nreported weight (0.95) in Add Health.\nWe analyzed the age- and sex-specific BMI percentile\nscore (BMI-P), which is adjusted for the non-linear effects\nof age and gender. The adjustment is accomplished by\ntransforming the raw BMI score into the age- and sex-\nspecific percentile score based on the observed growth\npercentile curves for children, adolescents, and youth con-\nstructed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/\nNational Center for Health Statistics (29) for the United\nTable 1.

The adjustment for age and sex is important for\nadolescent body mass data because of the rapid growth that\noccurs during childhood and adolescence. Our preliminary\nanalysis of the raw BMI taken at ages older than 20 revealed\nhighly significant age and sex effects, suggesting age and\nsex continue to be important for BMI between 20 and 26.\nBecause the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-\nconstructed growth curves only cover the age range of 2 to\n20, we confined our analysis to measures of BMI at ages 20\nor younger.\nDNA Preparation and Genotyping\nAt Wave III in 2002, DNA samples were collected from\na subset of the Add Health sample. Genomic DNA was\nisolated from buccal cells using a modification of published\ng. The genotypic assay used for the DRD4 gene was a\nmodification of the method of Sander et al. (34). The primer\nsequences (10) were: forward, 5-AGGACCCTCATGGC-\nCTTG-3 (fluorescently labeled); and reverse, 5-GCGAC-\nTACGTGGTCTACTCG-3. Of the nine alleles in the poly-\nmorphism, the 4 repeat (64.4%) is by far the most common\nallele, followed by the 7 repeat (21.5%). Although the 5\nrepeat (allele 523) has an overall low frequency, the any5R\ngenotype prevalence varies considerably by ethnicity, with\n6% for both African Americans and Hispanic Americans\nand only 1% for European Americans. A series of 2 tests\neach within a self-reported ethnic group (European Ameri-\ncan, African American, and Hispanic American) revealed\nno deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\nMeasures of PA, SB, and Family SES\nPA. The Add Health questionnaire included a standard\nrecall on PA behavior similar to other self-report question-\nnaires that have been used and validated in other large-scale\nited on participation in moderate-to-vigorous PA [5 to 8\nmetabolic equivalents (METs), such as skating, cycling, and\nother active sports] in the previous week. One MET is\ndefined as the energy expenditure associated with quiet\nsitting. The PA questions were worded as such: \"During the\npast week, how many times did you,\" followed by activities,\nsuch as walking, basketball, softball, etc., allowing calcula-\ntion of frequency (bouts) of specified activities per week by\nMET value.\nThe questionnaire at Wave III added four additional items\nto reflect the wider variety of activity types common to\nyoung adults. To make the scores across the three waves\ncomparable, we re-weighted the scores from Waves I and II\nby a factor of 7/3, where 7 and 3 are, respectively, the\nnumber of questions asked of each respondent at Wave III\nand at Waves I and II. Similar re-weighting has been used\nSB. We constructed a score on SB using the self-reported\nnumber of hours spent on watching television and video and\non playing video or computer games over the previous\nweek. Gordon-Larsen et al. (41) used a similar measure on\nFamily SES. SES was measured by the sum of the pa-\nrental education and occupation scales (42), which were\nreported separately for mother and father. Education ranged\nin scale from 1 (8th grade or less or not graduated from high\nschool) to 5 (professional training beyond a 4-year college\nor university). Occupation ranged from 0 (homemaker) to 5\n(professional such as doctor, lawyer, scientist, teacher, li-\nbrarian, nurse/military, or security (graduated from a col-\nlege or more). We used the higher value of father's and\nmother's SES scale as family SES. If only one parent's SES\nwas available, the available SES was used as family SES.\nAnalytical Strategies\nWe adopted a two-step analytical strategy. First, we com-\npared, in a contingency table, the means of BMI-P across\nDRD4 genotypes, ethnic groups, and Add Health Waves.\nWe also compared the means of BMI-P across level of PA\nand level of SB. Second, we used the mixed regression\nmodel (43,44) to estimate the association between measures\nof body mass (BMI-P) and the DRD4 genotypes simulta-\nneously with PA, SB, and family SES.\nOur sample consists of twins and siblings and the re-\npeated measures of the same individual over different waves\nbecause these observations are not independent. The mixed\nmodel has long been established in the statistical literature\nfor the analysis of data that are not independent. Several\nmajor statistical packages [e.g., SAS (SAS Institute, Inc.,\nCary, NC) and STATA (StataCorp LP., College Station,\nTX)] include the mixed model as a standard procedure. The\nfollowing equation describes the structure of the mixed\nmodel of BMI-P:\nBMI-Pjits\n Xjt\n vji\n ejits\nwhere j, i, and t index sibling cluster or pair, individual, and\nAdd Health Waves, respectively; Xjt\nand  are a vector of\nobserved variables including genotype, PA, physical inac-\ntivity, and SES and a vector of their effects, respectively;\nand s  m, d, or f indicates whether the sibling cluster or\npair are monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins, or full biolog-\nical siblings. Thus, the model allows the random effect at\nthe sibling cluster level and the measure level to vary by\ntype of sibling cluster.\nWe used three strategies to address the potential impact\nof population structure. First, we stratified our analysis by\nself-reported ethnicity so that the cases and controls are\nmatched by ethnicity. Tang et al. (45) showed a near-perfect\ncorrespondence between genetic clustering based on 326\nmicrosatellite markers and the four self-reported ethnicity\ncategories (European Americans, African Americans, East\nAsians, and Hispanic Americans).\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, Guo et al.\nOur second strategy addressed this concern by taking\nadvantage of the detailed categories of self-reported race/\nethnicity in Add Health. In keeping with the new Census\npolicy, Add Health respondents were allowed to mark as\nmany ethnicity categories as they felt applied to them (1).\nApproximately 7.5%, 3.5%, and 0% of African-American,\nHispanic-American, and European-American participants\nmarked more than one category, respectively. Of those who\nmarked more than one ethnic category, the large majority\n(86%) marked two ethnic categories and 12% marked three\nethnic categories. We re-estimated our models after deleting\nthese multiethnic participants.\nAs a third strategy, we applied Allison et al.'s (46)\nprocedure to test for possible population stratification. Fol-\nlowing the idea used in the development of sibship tests of\nlinkage and association (47\u00ad49), Allison et al. (46) reasoned\nthat the probabilities of genotypes of full siblings depended\nentirely on parental genotypes and that controlling for the\neffects of sibship would be equivalent to controlling for\nparental genotypes. The procedure is a special case of the\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics and Contingency Table Analysis\nTable 1 provides the mean or proportion of the variables\nused in the analysis by ethnicity and categorizes individuals\ninto three genotypes: those homozygous for 7R (7R/7R),\nthose having at least one 5R (any5R), and the remainder of\nthe sample (4R-others, which are dominated by the 4R\nallele). Data on DRD4*7R (2) are shown so that these\nresults can be evaluated with the results on any5R and\nenvironmental factors. The categorization is consistent with\nthose used in the regression analysis (Table 4). The overall\ngenotype frequency for any5R is 3%, but the distribution\nis uneven across the major ethnic groups, with 1%, 6%, and\n5%, respectively, for European-American, African-Ameri-\ncan, and Hispanic-American samples.\nTable 22 shows the mean BMI-P by DRD4 genotype,\nethnicity, and Add Health Wave. The mean BMI-P for the\n7R/7R genotype is substantially and consistently lower than\nthose for the 7R/Other (not shown) or 4R/Others genotypes\nacross all ethnic groups and Add Health Waves. In contrast,\nthe mean BMI-P for any5R genotype is higher than 7R/7R\nand 4R-Others. This result appears to hold only among\nAfrican Americans and, to a lesser degree, Hispanic-Amer-\nicans.\nTable 3 shows the means of BMI-P by PA and age group\nand the means of BMI-P by physical inactivity and age\ngroup. PA is not obviously related to BMI-P in adolescence\nand young adulthood. SB is moderately and positively re-\nlated to BMI-P.\nRegression Analysis\nIn Table 4, statistically significant genotype effects were\nfound only among African Americans. Compared with the\nreference category of the none-7R/7R and none-any5R ge-\nnotypes, the DRD4*7R/7R was associated with a large\nnegative (protective) effect of 15.08 percentile points\nTable 2. Mean BMI percentile by DRD4 genotype, ethnicity, and Add Health Wave\nDRD4 genotype\nGenotype\nfrequency\nWave I\nWave II\nWave III\nEuropean-American\nAfrican-American\nHispanic-American\n The same respondents were measured repeatedly at Waves I to III.\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, Guo et al.\nated with a large positive effect of 15.48 percentile points\n(p  0.003). These are fairly large effects considering the\nmean BMI-P for African Americans is 62.8 (Table 1). These\neffects were obtained after adjusting for the effects of age,\nsex, ethnicity, PA, physical inactivity, and family SES.\nIndividuals heterozygous for 7R did not differ from those in\nthe reference category (data not shown). Contrary to the\nexpectation, PA in adolescence was positively related to\nBMI-P among African Americans, but the result was only\nmarginally significant (p  0.07), and the magnitude of the\ncoefficient was small. Neither SB nor SES seems to be\nrelated to BMI-P.\nHigh levels of PA were associated with higher BMI-P in\nthe European-American (p  0.04) and Hispanic-American\n(p  0.046) samples, although the coefficients were small.\nFamily SES was only associated with BMI-P among Euro-\npean-American participants, and the direction of the asso-\nciation was consistent with expectation.\nTo address population stratification, we carried out the\nthree strategies described earlier. First, all analyses in this\npaper were stratified by self-reported ethnicity. As a second\nstrategy, we repeated our analyses after eliminating those\nindividuals who designated themselves as multiracial/eth-\nnic. The results remained essentially unchanged. For exam-\nple, the remaining African-American sample yielded a pro-\nthe entire African-American sample. Lastly, we also imple-\nmented Allison's (46) procedure in SAS, and our main\nresults were essentially unchanged (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nIn our study, both the 7R/7R and any5R genotypes of the\nDRD4 gene were associated with body mass in African-\nAmerican participants 13 to 20 years old. The presence of\nthe 7R/7R genotype is associated with a reduction of 15\n(p  0.005) in the BMI-P, and the presence of any5R was\nThese associations were obtained after adjusting for PA,\nSB, and family SES.\nTable 3.

To address the issue of\nmultiple testing, we applied the Bonferroni procedure (50)\nby using an adjusted level of significance /m, where m is\nthe number of tests. Thus, for three tests, our new level of\nand any5R) previously statistically significant results (Table\n4) still hold under the Bonferroni correction. The Bonfer-\nroni procedure tends to overcorrect multiple comparison\nbecause the procedure assumes independence among the\nmultiple tests; the tests we performed are unlikely to be\nindependent.\nNeither PA nor SB as measured in Add Health seems to\nbe importantly associated with BMI-P. PA is significantly\nassociated with BMI-P among adolescents in the European-\nAmerican, African-American, and Hispanic-American sam-\nples, but the effect size is quite moderate. For instance, with\na coefficient of 0.14, twice the mean number (7.76) of bouts\nof PA over the last week only increases BMI-P (mean \nof PA for the European-American sample. The impact of SB\nappears negligible. The absence of an important effect of\nPA and SB suggests a complex relationship between body\nmass and PA and/or SB. For example, a low level of PA and\na high level of PA may both be associated with high body\nmass, although the composition of the body mass may\ndiffer. Family SES seems to be more importantly and con-\nsistently related to BMI-P in the European-American sam-\nple. Everything else being equal, doubling the mean SES\nwould reduce BMI-P by about 6. The moderate effects of\nnon-genetic/environmental factors contrast conspicuously\nwith the large genotype effects.\nOnly limited data are available on the role of DRD4\nvariants and body mass regulation (51\u00ad53; for brief review,\nsee 2). The hypothesis of reward deficiency syndrome (54)\nis often invoked in studies examining the role of the dopa-\nminergic system. The hypothesis in the context of obesity\nresearch suggests that individuals with low intrinsic dopa-\nmine activity in the brain reward pathways tend to compen-\nsate by using various reinforcing behaviors, including in-\ncreased food consumption (55). Biochemical analyses of\nDRD4 protein variants have demonstrated that the 7R pro-\ntein has a blunted response for cyclic adenosine monophos-\nphate reduction, requiring a 3-fold increase in dopamine\nconcentration for reductions comparable with the 4R protein\n(11). Thus, the inhibitory neurons using the DRD4*7R\nreceptor would require increased dopamine for optimal\nAlthough functional analysis specific for DRD4*5R is\nunavailable, our association results, if replicated, should be\nvaluable and may stimulate related biochemical functional\nanalysis. Grady, Ding, Wang, and colleagues (57\u00ad59) stud-\nied the origin of human DRD4 diversity by sequencing the\nentire DRD4 locus from 103 individuals of African, Euro-\npean, Asian, North and South American, and Pacific Island\nancestry. They developed a general framework for testing\nthe differential effects of the various variants in the 48-base\npair VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) in DRD4.\nComparisons should be carried out, they suggested, between\nthe most ancient and by far the most common 4R allele and\nthe other rare alleles (57). The rare variants including our\n7R/7R and any5R might have had a selective advantage in\ncertain environments. They also argued for continued ef-\nforts to link DNA sequences with human outcomes even in\nthe absence of biochemical evidence linking the two be-\ncause reliable linkage between biochemical differences and\nbehavioral differences is difficult. Also, for proteins like\nDRD4 where most interacting proteins are undetected (60),\nit is frequently unclear which biochemical parameter needs\nto be investigated.\nThe absence of the association with any5R in the Euro-\npean-American sample may be because of its extremely low\ngenotype frequency (1%). The presence of strong genetic\nassociations only in the African-American sample suggests\nthat environmental or non-genetic factors may be at work. It\nhas been suggested that the greater prevalence of obesity\namong African Americans may be explained by social class\nand by cultural differences in the standards of beauty or in\nthe acceptance of greater range of body shapes and sizes\n(61\u00ad64). European Americans, especial white females, tend\nto be more concerned about body image (65,66), are more\nlikely to adopt weight control strategies (67), and have a\nhigher incidence of eating disorders such as anorexia and\nbulimia nervosa (67\u00ad69) than African Americans.\nOur future work will test the hypothesis that the genotype\neffects among European Americans tend to be compensated\nby obesity-related practices. The hypothesis can be tested by\nanalysis of gene-environment interaction between the geno-\ntypes and measures of PA, SB, and family SES within the\nEuropean sample and analysis using obesity-related mea-\nsures beyond those used in this analysis. Because of the low\ngenotype frequency of the 7R/7R and any5R genotypes, the\ngene-environment analysis (1) can only be carried out in a\nconsiderably larger sample than ours. Other future work will\ncomprehensively evaluate additional DRD4 polymorphisms\nin this sample and in the entire Add Health sample of\n15,000 individuals, whose DNA will be collected in Wave\nIV of the Add Health study.\n"
