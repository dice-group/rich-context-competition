    "abstract": "Abstract. In many magic tricks, magicians fool their audience by performing a mock action (a so-\ncalled \"ruse\"), which merely serves the purpose of providing a seemingly natural explanation for\nvisible movements that are actually part of the secret move they want to hide from the audience.\nHere, we discuss a special magic ruse in which the action of secretly putting something somewhere\nis \"explained away\" by the mock action of fetching something from the same place, or vice versa.\nInterestingly, the psychological principles underlying the amazing potency and robustness of this\ntechnique seem to be very similar to the general perceptual principles underlying figure\u00adground\nperception and the assignment of border ownership. This analogy may be useful for exploring the\npossibility that this and similar magical effects involve immediate \"unconscious inferences\" about\nintentions more akin to perceptual processing than to explicit deliberations based on a reflective\n\"theory\" of mind.\n",

After viewing this performance, observers typically have no clue as to how the\nmagician was able to get the balls into the hat.\nWhy do people usually have such a hard time figuring out the deceivingly simple secret behind\nthis trick--which is that the magician puts the balls into the hat while pretending to fetch some invis-\nible magic powder from it? Would it not be relatively easy to figure out that the magician can put\nsomething into the hat whenever he reaches into it?\nWe believe that an interesting analogy between this magical effect and the more well-known\nprinciples of figure\u00adground perception may point to an answer to this question. To appreciate this\nanalogy, consider that when a magician moves his hand from A to B and back again (Figure 1a), this\ncan, in principle be interpreted as three different intentional actions: He puts something from A to B\n(Figure 1b), he fetches something at location B and places it at A (Figure 1c), or he actually does both\n(Figure 1d).1 Importantly, note the analogy to the perception of the central image contours in Rubin's\n1It may be of some interest to note that also a fourth interpretation is logically possible, namely that nothing is\nput or fetched at all, but just kept in the hand all the time. In terms of the analogy to border ownership, this may\nbe said to correspond to a contour without surfaces on either side.\nThe put-and-fetch ambiguity: How magicians exploit the\nprinciple of exclusive allocation of movements to intentions\n87 Van de Cruys S, Wagemans J, Ekroll V\n(1915) famous face-vase demonstration (Figure 1e): In principle, they can be interpreted as reflecting\nthree different real-world situations: A vase on a ground extending behind it (Figure 1f), two faces on\na ground extending behind them (Figure 1g), or a mosaic of a vase-shaped object which happens to fit\nin snugly between two face-shaped objects (Figure 1h).\nIn much the same way as the central borders can be \"owned\" either by the face or the vase, the\nback and forth movement of the magician's hand can be owned by a \"putting action\" or a \"fetching\naction.\" Importantly, research on figure\u00adground perception has shown that the visual system system-\natically avoids the double assignment of border ownership associated with the mosaic interpretation\n(Driver & Baylis, 1996). That is, it adheres to the general principle of exclusive allocation, according\nto which \"a sensory element should not be used in more than one description at a time\" (Bregman,\n1994, p. 12). Thus, in the paperballs-to-hat routine, the sensory element (the actual back and forth\nmovement), being allocated to the \"mock\" action of \"fetching dust,\" is not available for allocation to\nthe action of putting things into the hat anymore.\nIn a more general sense, this kind of ambiguity, where a competitive interpretation is \"eliminated\"\nfrom awareness, characterizes the perception of bistable figures in general (Leopold & Logothetis,\n1999; Tormey & Tormey, 1983). The surprising potency and robustness of the above magic trick can\nbe elegantly explained by assuming that the visual system also adheres to this rule by avoiding the\ndouble assignment of \"movement ownership\" associated with the \"put-and-fetch action\" interpreta-\ntion (Figure 1d): Our visual system simply won't produce more than one of the two potential action\ndescriptions (\"putting\" or \"fetching\") of the hand motion at the same time. As is well known, this\ngeneral principle can be motivated by the fact that it tends to give right answers about how the visual\ning interpretations involving unlikely coincidences: In the case of figure\u00adground perception, double-\nborder ownership assignment would correspond to a highly unlikely jig-saw-puzzle-like alignment\nFigure 1. Illustration of the analogy between border ownership assignment in figure\u00adground perception and the\nassignment of \"movement ownership\" in the perception of actions. The contours in (a) are ambiguous and can\nbe \"owned\" either by a vase (b) or two faces (c), or both at the same time (d). The visual system typically avoids\nthe latter double assignment of border-ownership (\"mosaic interpretation\") where the contours belong both to the\nvase and the faces (d). Analogously, the motion of the magician's hand into the hat and back is ambiguous in the\nsense that it may involve putting an object into the hat (f), fetching an object from the hat (g), or both at the same\ntime (h). The latter double assignment of the \"put\" and \"fetch\" actions to the back-and-forth movement (h) seems\nto be avoided in much the same way as the assignment of double-border ownership in figure\u00adground perception\n(d). This could explain why we are so easily fooled by this kind of magical ruse.\nThe put-and-fetch ambiguity 88\nof the contours of two different surfaces, and in the case of action perception, the double assignment\nof movement ownership would correspond to the very unlikely situation where an object needs to be\nmoved fromAto B while another one also needs to be moved from B toAat the same time. The unlike-\nliness of this is precisely the reason why the magician has to come up with a mock action (or \"ruse\"),\nsuch as \"fetching some magic dust from the hat,\" or \"getting the magic wand out of his pocket\" (while\nactually ditching a \"vanishing\" coin, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6VWi7IaroA; movie\nars have noticed that high-level representations such as intentions attributed to motion can actually\nthat people readily attribute animacy (intentions) and emotions to mechanical motion of simple geo-\nmetric shapes. The automaticity and directness with which this happens surely suggest that the process\nunderlying this is more akin to unconscious perceptual inference than to deliberate reasoning about\nlikely intentions of the agent. In fact, undoing this requires deliberate thinking, as when trying to see\nonly the proximal inputs of the apple without seeing the full apple (as in amodal volume comple-\ntion, see Ekroll, Sayim, & Wagemans, 2013). Convergent evidence from phenomenology (Gallagher,\nnow supports the idea that any action is immediately perceived as having an intention or end goal, with\na concomitant sense of visual presence.\nOne might ask why we inevitably perceive movements as intentions. The encoding of perceived\nmovements in terms of end goals (intentions) attests to the predictive nature of perception (Van de\nCruys & Wagemans, 2011). A perceived intention represents a movement more efficiently as part of\na predictable chain of interdependent events, disregarding the fine details of the movements. Fram-\ning this within Bayesian or predictive models of perception shows that the exclusive allocation can\nalso be considered a form of \"explaining away\" (Kersten, Mamassian, & Yuille, 2004). Specifically,\nif the same inputs (movement details) can be explained by two different hypotheses, heightening the\nprobability of one explanation, e.g., by contextual cues, will automatically reduce the probability of\nthe other hypothesis. To paraphrase the classic example for \"explaining away\": the hypothesis that it\njust rained will be quasi-eliminated as an explanation for a wet lawn, once one notices a leaky garden\nhose lying around.\nThe present phenomenon can be described as one movement \"overshadowing\" the other in the\nspectator's mind: Either the forward \"putting movement\" overshadows the backward \"fetching\"\nmovement, or vice versa. Many similar effects, where specific movements tend to overshadow others\nare well known to magicians (Kurtz, 1998). One general rule of thumb routinely used by magicians\nis that large movements tend to make smaller ones go unnoticed. In the paddle-move for instance, the\nlarge sweeping motion of a paddle (or any stick-like object) makes it very difficult to notice that it\nis also simultaneously rotated along its long axis (Hergovich, Gr\u00f6bl, & Carbon, 2011). On a general\nlevel, all of these effects seem to work by making one of the movements more conspicuous than the\nother, whereby the latter can be manipulated relying on different factors. The present effect is prob-\nably no exception to this rule, but the cues that determine the relative dominance of the two possible\ninterpretations are probably more subtle than the gross differences in motion size underlying the pad-\ndle move effect. Another important difference is that the paddle move involves two simultaneously\nperformed movements, while the present effect involves a forward and a backward motion performed\nin succession. Furthermore, while it makes sense to speak of a fundamental ambiguity between the two\n(or strictly speaking, three) possible interpretations in the present case, the paddle move does not seem\nto involve any principled ambiguity, but rather seems to be driven by limits of the perceptual system\nIn conclusion, we generalized the principle of exclusive allocation to action-intention perception\nand described how it is exploited in magic tricks. This case study underscores the usefulness of magic\nto uncover general principles in perception and cognition (Kuhn, Amlani, & Rensink, 2008).\n"
