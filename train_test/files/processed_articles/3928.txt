    "abstract": "Abstract\nOne of the major challenges of addressing diversity in the classroom is to meet the needs of gifted students, which are\noften invisible in countries such as Chile, in which providing services for highly able students is still considered elitist. The\npurpose of this study was to analyze the perceptions of community members about the critical competencies of instructors\nwho work with gifted students. Six focus groups were conducted with students, instructors, and staff members of an\nenrichment program for the gifted. Qualitative analyses were conducted throughout open, axial, and selective coding. Traits\nand competencies were grouped into three themes: knowledge, teaching, and socio-emotional characteristics. Differences\nwere found between the perceptions of students and staff members: Whereas students' emphasis was on socio-affective\ncharacteristics, the staff highlighted the importance of content and pedagogical knowledge. The novelty and contribution of\nthe study are related on how to recognize and acknowledge the voices of active members of a community for educational\nimprovement. These community perceptions contributed to depict a profile of an effective teacher for gifted students, and\nwere used to improve instructors' current performance and to design a more rigorous selection process for future teachers.\nThe implications of the study also shed light about how to improve teacher preparation programs to meet the needs of this\ngroup of students.\n",

Because\neach context is different, there is no certainty that any given\napproach to teaching will have the desired impact on stu-\ndents (Timperley, Wilson, Barrar, & Fung, 2007). In the\nwords of Darling-Hammond and Snyder (2000), \"formulas\nfor teaching that do not take account of students'experiences\nand needs are less and less successful\" (p. 523). In the litera-\nture of giftedness, a large body of research exists concerning\nthe characteristics and competencies of teachers for the\ngifted (Hansen & Feldhusen, 1994), and diverse teaching\nmodels also have been created to meet this population's\nneeds (Maker & Schiever, 2005). However, these models put\nan emphasis on the \"shoulds\" regarding the instruction pro-\nvided for gifted students (Hertzog, 1998). The main actors in\nthis process--students, teachers, and administrators--are\nnot always consulted about their experiences and what mat-\nters to them in the teaching and learning process. Without the\nviews of all of the community, including students, the picture\nof the educational process is incomplete (Cook-Sather,\n2002). Some researchers have found that the school systems\nand teachers can benefit greatly by listening to the unique\nperspectives of members of the school community,\n1Universidad de los Andes, Chile, Santiago, Chile\n2Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Valpara\u00edso, Chile\nCorresponding Author:\nMaria P.

G\u00f3mez-Arizaga1, Mar\u00eda Leonor Conejeros-Solar2,\nand Annjeanette Martin1\n Keywords\ngifted education, special education, teacher competencies, gifted students, community voice, teacher traits\n2 SAGE Open\nespecially students, who can be effective informants of their\nThe purpose of this study was to incorporate the voices\nof various members of a learning community, not only as\nprimary informants of their teaching and learning experi-\nences but also as individuals who have an active role in\nthis community, whose perceptions matter, and can, there-\nfore, exert a direct influence on the educational and admin-\nistrative levels and become partners in decision-making\nprocesses. The goal was to complement the existing dia-\nlogue on teacher competencies for the gifted by consider-\ning the viewpoints of all the participants through enquiry\n(Schultz, 2012), to include the voices of gifted individuals\nand educators into the gifted education discourse\n(Mendaglio, 2003). Thus, the significance of the study was\nto incorporate an important piece to the discussion of\nteacher competencies: the voices of those community\nmembers who actively participate in programs for the\ngifted.\nBackground\nGifted Students as Learners\nGifted students differ in the type and level of their abilities\n(Feldhusen, 1982), and they do not share the same learning\ncharacteristics (Hertzog, 1998). However, compared with\ntheir non-gifted peers, they do present unique learning needs\nthat cannot be disregarded (Stepanek, 1999), and researchers\nhave found significant differences between the learning\nstyles of these two groups of students (Kahyaoglu, 2013).\nGifted students' learning needs. Learning styles and personal-\nity traits of gifted students, taken as a whole, tend to display\ncertain characteristics that identify these students (Thomson,\nthree categories: cognitive (related to several complex cogni-\ntive processes), social (relationships), and affective (intrap-\nersonal preferences).\nCognitive. Researchers who conducted longitudinal stud-\nies have found that gifted students have a tendency to estab-\nlish complex relationships between ideas; to enjoy theory,\nsuch as abstract concepts; to be more open and flexible; and\nto gravitate toward logical analysis and objectivity (Mills,\nDunn, and Price (1989) found certain unique traits among\nthese students, such as feeling responsible about their own\nlearning, preferring kinesthetic learning, having a preference\nfor lack of structure, liking independent learning, and dis-\nliking passive listening. Other researchers have found that\ngifted students enjoy problem-solving activities (Gadanidis,\nHughes, & Cordy, 2011), questioning given information,\nexperiments, exploration, creating alternate solutions, and\ngenerating original ideas (Johnsen, 2004).\nSocial.Gifted students' interactions with their immedi-\nate context are not always easy and straightforward, mainly\nbecause they are not always accepted and feel different from\ntheir peers. Also, due to their asynchronous development\n(i.e., discrepancy between cognitive and socio-emotional\ndevelopment), gifted students can be at risk of social alien-\nsocial needs that arise out of the interaction between the\ngifted student and his or her environment can include feeling\nthey are accepted by others, being with other gifted students,\nand being acknowledged for their achievements.\nAffective. Several affective and personality traits of gifted\nstudents have been investigated over the years; however, they\nmust be analyzed, not in isolation, but in the context of how\nthey relate to the students' cognitive characteristics and the\ninteractions with the social environment. Even though some\nresearchers have taken polarized stands regarding the mani-\nfestation and intensity of the socio-emotional needs of gifted\nstudents, there seems to be some agreement about periods,\nsuch as adolescence, that are critical in the socio-emotional\ndevelopment of gifted students.\nSuccessful Teachers of the Gifted\nThe critical role of the teacher in nurturing and addressing\ngifted students'potential is undeniable, and early studies have\nfound that teachers do make a difference (Cropley & McLeod,\n1986).According to the characteristics of gifted students, sev-\neral researchers have investigated the \"ideal\" competencies of\nthe teachers who work with this population to enhance their\nlearning experiences. For this research, competency will be\nunderstood as a cluster of resources that are mobilized and\nreorganized by the individual (knowledge, procedures, and\nattitudes) to respond in an appropriate manner to a situation,\nin a given context, which means \"knowing how to act\"\ners' resources, also known in education as professional com-\npetence, have been widely studied in the field of teacher\neducation. One of the prominent authors in this field is Lee\nShulman, who proposed a paradigm to understand teachers'\nprofessional knowledge (Kleickmann et al., 2013; Shulman,\n1986). Several authors have investigated Shulman's catego-\nries and even though there has been no agreement about the\nrelationship between domains, they can be grouped into four\nmain groups: subject matter knowledge (also known as con-\ntent knowledge or CK), pedagogical knowledge, pedagogical\ncontent knowledge (PCK), and knowledge of the context\n(Park & Oliver, 2008). For this study, we particularly focused\non CK and PCK as core constructs that can be identified by\nthose actively participating in an educational community.\nContent knowledge was defined following Shulman's (1986)\nconceptualization: \"the amount and organization of knowl-\nedge per se in the mind of teachers\" (p. 9), that is, a complete\nand profound understanding of the subject matter. PCK was\nG\u00f3mez-Arizaga et al. 3\nunderstood as the extensive array of strategies employed by\nteachers to promote students' understanding of a subject mat-\nter, also considering contextual limitations that can be present\nin the teaching and learning process (Webb, 2013).\nA teacher becomes progressively competent when\nexposed to pre-service education and professional develop-\nment (Darling-Hammond, Wei, Andree, Richardson, &\nOrphanos, 2009). Researchers in the field of giftedness have\nfound that the quality of teacher preparation is critical,\nbecause it can transform teachers'preconceived ideas of gift-\nedness (Kagan, 1992). However, several investigations have\nshown that pre-service training in gifted education is insuf-\nficient (Rowley, 2012) and that in-service professional\ndevelopment opportunities in the field are weak and not nec-\nessarily connected to classroom implementation (VanTassel-\nTeaching practices.The discussion about teacher compe-\ntences has revolved around the concept of teacher effective-\nness (Mills, 2003). Although the teachers of the gifted share\nmany characteristics with teachers in regular classrooms,\nresearchers have found that there are critical aspects that dif-\nferentiate both groups in terms of providing opportunities to\nenhance students' learning experiences. Hong, Greene, and\nHartzell (2011), for example, in a comparative study of\nteachers for the gifted and teachers in regular classrooms,\nfound significant differences between both groups: Teachers\nof the gifted reported more sophisticated epistemological\nbeliefs regarding knowledge and learning, were more ori-\nented toward learning goals, and paid less attention to perfor-\nmance goals than their peers in regular classrooms.\nFurthermore, teachers of the gifted had a preference for\nstructure in the classroom environment and for using materi-\nals that fostered student learning. However, teachers in regu-\nlar classrooms were focused on the results of standardized\ntests.\nVanTassel-Baska (2005) found that the ideal profile of a\nteacher for the gifted included competencies such as the mas-\ntery of disciplinary content knowledge, a positive interaction\nwith students, and use of diverse teaching strategies. The\nbest teaching practices included a repertoire that encom-\npassed student-centered teaching, use of stimulating ques-\ntions, and classroom management, among others.\nTeacher characteristics. In identifying effective teaching prac-\ntices for gifted students, teacher competencies are not the\nonly factor to consider. In fact, some authors have stated that\nwhereas competencies can be learned or acquired throughout\nteaching experiences, other characteristics are equally impor-\ntant and necessary for an optimal learning process (Feldhu-\nteachers from the United Kingdom, found that teachers'\ninsights about the needs of gifted children were relevant\nwhen working with this population. These dispositions\nincluded being empathetic with students' needs, having high\nexpectations, displaying humor, encouraging gifted students\nin the same way as students in regular classrooms, ensuring\na safe classroom climate for students, and providing chal-\nlenging learning experiences.\nConsistent with Eyre et al., Vogl and Preckel (2014) also\nfound that the social environment in which learning occurs--\nthe classroom climate--can also be a critical component\ninfluencing gifted students' experiences as learners. In their\nstudy, a positive classroom climate was related to better atti-\ntudes toward school and less disruptive behaviors. An ade-\nquate climate also had a positive effect on gifted students'\nwell-being and overall satisfaction with their academic expe-\nriences in schools.\nGentry, Steenbergen-Hu, and Choi (2011), in a mixed-\nmethods study of student-identified exemplary teachers,\nfound that teachers who had the most valuable competencies\nhad the following characteristics: had a genuine interest in\nstudents and built strong relationships with them, set high\nexpectations and had high standards for their students, main-\ntained a good classroom climate and had a good time with\ntheir students, and had passion toward their teaching and\ntheir students.\nAnother set of findings regarding teacher characteristics\nis related to the close relationship that exists between teacher\nand student characteristics. Mills (2003) found a consider-\nable match between the personality types of both students\nand teachers, concluding that effective teachers displayed\ncharacteristics such as openness, flexibility, creativity, and\noverall preference for intuitive processing.\nCommunity Voice and Engagement in Assessing\nEducational Practices\nThe concept of voice arises from the emerging need to incor-\nporate different actors in understanding practices that occur\nin educational settings, with the goal of empowering, incor-\nporating their opinions and perceptions, and acknowledging\nthe importance of community voices for democratic partici-\npation in the pedagogical process (Freire, 1968). Even\nthough students, parents, and teachers are the main actors in\neducational contexts, few investigations have taken their\nvoices into account, especially regarding the experiences of\nStudent voice. The concept of student voice has been investi-\ngated related to the forms in which students' opinions and\ninvolvement can produce changes in the school context\n(Flutter & Rudduck, 2004). In the field of giftedness, some\nresearchers have investigated students' views and percep-\ntions of teacher quality and effectiveness. However, these\nstudies have been conducted exclusively for research pur-\nposes and not necessarily as part of educational decision-\nmaking processes; this was the ultimate goal of the current\ninvestigation: incorporating student voices to foster a partici-\npatory needs assessment (Wang & Burris, 1997).\n4 SAGE Open\nVialle and Quigley (2002) found that students had a pref-\nerence toward cognitive and socio-emotional characteristics\nof teachers, such as enthusiasm, sense of humor, good com-\nmunication skills, and learning from errors. In other studies,\nVialle and Tischler (2009) indicated that when gifted stu-\ndents are forced to make a choice about their teachers' char-\nacteristics, there was a tendency to prefer personal\u00adsocial\ncharacteristics to intellectual ones. Despite these initial pref-\nerences, when students answered an open-ended question,\nthe authors found more balance between socio-affective and\ncognitive characteristics, suggesting that there is a more\ncomplex relationship between them given that students\ntended to combine both elements in their answers.\nGentry, Rizza, and Owen (2002) conducted a study with\n1,250 gifted students about what teachers reported doing in\ntheir classes and what students perceived had occurred in\nthem. They found discrepancies between both groups, espe-\ncially regarding challenges presented by teachers. The\nresearchers emphasized the need to \"hear both sides of the\nstory,\" which includes incorporating both teacher and stu-\ndent voices to fully understand what happens within the\nclassroom.\nJ. Gallagher, Harradine, and Coleman (1997) found that\neven if the students encountered some degree of challenge in\ntheir classrooms, repetition and a slow pace were aspects that\ndid not favor their learning and, therefore, demanded from\ntheir teachers more complexity, practical activities, and the\nopportunity to reflect individually. Kanevsky and Keighley\n(2003) found that many of the students were bored and their\nperceptions of teachers and strategies were similar to the\nones found by Gallagher et al. such as repetition. When\nasked about their preferences, choice appears to be a critical\naspect that enhanced the students' learning experiences.\nM\u00e1rquez and Mart\u00ednez (2011), in a study of gifted students'\ncharacteristics and perceptions of their educational settings,\nalso found that boredom was constantly mentioned by stu-\ndents, who demanded better and innovative teaching prac-\ntices in which they could use their time productively.\nConejeros-Solar, G\u00f3mez-Arizaga, and Donoso-Osorio\n(2013), in a qualitative study on Chilean gifted students' per-\nceptions about teacher characteristics, found that (a) students\nwere able to conduct detailed assessments of their teachers;\n(b) students' perceptions were consistent with what other\nresearchers have found about teacher effectiveness, such as\npracticality, flexibility, and pace; and (c) students also valued\nsocio-emotional characteristics such as closeness, empathy,\nand trust. Olivares et al. (2014) found similar results when\nanalyzing the perceptions of students who participated in a\nChilean enrichment program: Students had a strong prefer-\nence for interactive lessons and teaching practices that fos-\ntered flexibility.\nCommunity voice. From early research in the field, the value\nof community-based approaches has been highlighted as rel-\nevant to improve teaching and learning practices for gifted\nMatthews and Kitchen (2007) conducted a study to assess\nthe implementation of gifted programs within three different\nschools. They found similarities between teachers and stu-\ndents' responses and concluded that both of them were able\nto inform about the strengths of the programs (e.g., a chal-\nlenging academic environment), the changes that could be\nimplemented (e.g., using varied teaching methods, more pro-\nfessional development for teachers), and the relationship the\nprograms had with the school community (e.g., a helpful\nrelationship).\nThese findings suggest that students and educators can be\na valuable resource for understanding classroom encounters\nand student learning, through the analysis of their narrated\nexperiences. Narratives \"can reveal truths of the human\nviduals with a sense of uniqueness and purpose based on dif-\nferent experiences (Singer, 2004). In the field of gifted\neducation, in which a tradition of quantitative research exists,\na qualitative approach can provide richness and depth to the\ndiscussion. Prior (2011), in her analysis of student voice in\ngifted education, stated \"the insider perspective is urgently\nThe purpose of this study was to recognize narratives to\nproduce meaningful knowledge. We investigated how a co-\nconstructed or community-based approach, in which the\nviews of students, practitioners, and teachers converge, can\nhelp to outline a profile of characteristics and competencies\nfor teachers who work in an extracurricular enrichment pro-\ngram for gifted students in Chile.\nThe question that guided the study was the following:\nResearch Question 1: What were the teacher competen-\ncies and characteristics identified as critical by the mem-\nbers of the community of an extracurricular enrichment\nprogram for the gifted?\nMethod\nContext\nThe Chilean educational system. Three types of schools can be\nfound in the Chilean educational system: public, semi-pri-\nvate, and private. Seven of 10 students from public schools\ncome from the 40% of the population with the lowest socio-\neconomic status (SES; Gonz\u00e1lez, Mizala, & Romaguera,\n2002). Chilean schools have a unique national curriculum\ndictated by the Ministry of Education. This national curricu-\nlum includes a minimum curricular content that needs to be\naddressed by each school to assure that every student is pre-\npared to face high school and college demands.\nPrograms for the gifted.A decree promulgated in 2012\nmandated the provision of special education services\nG\u00f3mez-Arizaga et al. 5\nwithin schools as compulsory. However, it did not include\nservices for gifted education. The only way the Chilean\nMinistry of Education has secured education for the\ngifted, since 2007, is through economic support for uni-\nversity-based extracurricular enrichment programs that\nexist in six of the 15 regions of the country. These pro-\ngrams serve students mainly from public schools under\nthe premise that this population has fewer opportunities to\ndevelop their potential.\nThe BETA Program is part of the university-based pro-\ngram network located in the city of Valpara\u00edso, Chile\nago and serves a population of approximately 270 gifted stu-\ndents per year from Grades 7 to 12. Students attend the pro-\ngram on Fridays and Saturdays. Each semester they have the\nopportunity to choose two courses and a workshop. Courses\nare focused on a specific topic of a discipline (e.g., The\nPhysics Behind Toys) and workshops on the mastery of a\nspecific skill (e.g., rock climbing).\nParticipants\nEighteen members of the BETA Program participated in this\nstudy. Consent and assent for their participation was obtained\nprior to the data collection process. The characteristics of the\nparticipants are summarized in Table 1.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Elementary and secondary BETA students (n = 6).\nRegular BETAstudents are identified either in sixth or\nninth grade. The first step is a schoolteacher nomina-\ntion; the second step is an evaluation that uses a com-\nbination of different scales: the Raven Standard\nProgressive Matrices and a Motivation Scale locally\nelaborated. A purposeful sample of students was\ndrawn for the study, in which the criteria were (a) gen-\nder representation, (b) active role within the program,\nand (c) age representativeness (students from elemen-\ntary and secondary levels were selected).\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Coordinators (n = 4). All the BETA coordinators par-\nticipated in the study. These are individuals who work\ndirectly with the BETA students on tasks such as orga-\nnization, research, or socio-emotional support.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Members of the managerial team (n = 2). The two\nmembers of the BETA administration team were part\nof the study.All the BETAstaff were recruited through\nan external hiring process, except for the director who\nis nominated by the vice president of the university in\nwhich the program is located.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 BETA Instructors (n = 6). A purposeful sample of\ninstructors was recruited to participate in the study\nwho met the following criteria: (a) had at least 2 years\nof teaching experience in the program, (b) had good\nteacher evaluations, and (c) were committed to the\nprogram.\nParents were not included in the sample. This decision\nwas not arbitrary; parents can be good evaluators and their\nvoice was considered as part of the BETA community.\nHowever, in the context of this study, our goal was to gather\nand analyze data from those who worked and/or had direct\nexperiences with teachers of the BETA Program to recall\nspecific events or phenomena that helped explain the compe-\ntencies that are critical for teaching in a program for the\ngifted. This research was framed within a series of activities\norganized by the BETA Program to design a community-\nbased teacher profile grounded in core competencies, with\nthe goal of recruiting future teachers that would demonstrate\nthe critical competencies defined by the BETA community.\nInstruments and Procedures\nStudents, coordinators, and members of the management\nteam participated in separate focus group sessions. Teachers\nwere divided into three distinct groups: humanities, science,\nand workshop instructors. A total of six focus group sessions\nwere conducted that had a length of approximately 1.5 to 2 hr\neach. Participants were contacted and a consent form was\nsigned prior to the participation in the study.\nSemi-structured questions focused on the characteristics\nof teachers who currently work or would like to work in the\nBETA Program were constructed and expert judgment was\nused to validate the questions. The two protocols used had\nthe following characteristics: (a) questions for the student\nfocus group were formulated using simpler language, (b)\nTable 1.

The questions included in both protocols are displayed\nData Analysis\nFocus groups were audiotaped and data were later tran-\nscribed verbatim. Transcriptions were reviewed and an ini-\ntial process of open coding was conducted separately by the\ntwo researchers using the computer-assisted qualitative data\nanalysis software ATLAS.ti. In this phase, each researcher\nalso created code and theoretical memos.\nA second phase included three joint sessions of inductive\nanalysis (Creswell, 2007) for axial and selective coding pur-\nposes to discuss the relationships among codes and to achieve\ndensification and saturation of the data (Glaser, 1994). In this\nsecond phase, we focused on theory building by analyzing\npatterns, building categories from those patterns, and creating\noverarching themes. To ensure trustworthiness, we followed\ntwo criteria: (a) created a thick description of the data and (b)\nconducted peer-debriefing sessions during the second phase\nof analysis to question and justify the categories and themes.\nResults\nData analysis yielded three themes related to teachers' char-\nacteristics and competencies identified by the community\nmembers of the BETA Program. However, the connotation\nand relevance of each theme was different for the group of\nstudents and the groups of staff members and teachers, which\nhave been explained in detail in this section. Descriptions\nand examples of the themes and subthemes that emerged\nfrom data analyses can be found in Table 4. The three main\nthemes were the following:\nTheme 1: Knowledge, which referred to the type and\nquality of the teacher's disciplinary (subject matter)\npreparation.\nTheme 2: Teaching, which included the transformation of\ncontent into teaching and learning strategies.\nTheme 3: Socio-emotional characteristics represented in\nstudent\u00adteacher interactions.\nTheme 1: Knowledge\nStudents did not comment on the topic of teachers' CK or\npreparation; they focused on teaching strategies and socio-\nemotional characteristics of their BETA instructors. On the\nother side, one of the salient topics that emerged from the\nBETA staff and teachers was that instructors should have a\nprofound knowledge of their field and be capable of acknowl-\nedging the principles and problems of that field, and the con-\nnection with other disciplines, as stated by one staff member:\n\"It is important that the instructor has a solid knowledge of\nthe discipline, that he is an expert in the field.\" Also, for this\ngroup, teachers must know the field from a theoretical, prac-\ntical, and/or experimental point of view; however, they also\nhave to show passion toward the discipline they teach.\nYou have to like what you teach, I mean, not only being the\nexpert, you have to like it a lot . . . It's fantastic that you can do\nwhatever you want and that is important, that the teacher likes\nwhat he is doing. (BETA workshop instructor)\nFor the members of the management team, disciplinary\nknowledge is crucial and relevant; however, the sharing of\nthis knowledge needs to be rigorous, considering that teach-\ners are working with gifted students who need to be chal-\nlenged.

Main Themes and Subthemes With Definitions and Examples.\nTheme Definition Subthemes Example\nKnowledge Type and quality of\nteachers disciplinary\npreparation\nExpertise . . . so he has to master the content knowledge, in the particular case of\nmathematics, the teacher has to have a good knowledge of the field, it\ncannot be a person who only has a Bachelor degree (BETA teacher).\nPassion toward\ncontent\nAnd I also think that they have to show the passion related to the discipline\nthey teach (BETA staff member).\nCognitive\nchallenge\nThe teacher has to be demanding, he has to pose challenges to the students\n(BETA curriculum director).\nInterdisciplinary\ncontent\nknowledge\nThat they have an interdisciplinary view of teaching, that they have an\ninterest in coupling with other fields (BETA science instructor).\nTeaching Theoretical and\npractical experience\nwith teaching and\nlearning strategies\nBeing flexible . . . there are teachers here that have learned how to work with gifted kids,\nI mean, they have elaborated a work strategy and developed a special\nattitude to work with them, because these students are very different from\nuniversity students and from the standard school student . . . the ones that\ncannot adjust, that cannot learn this strategy, they leave, they don't stay in\nthe program (BETA coordinator).\nPromoting\nactive student\nparticipation\nI think the teacher also needs to consider student participation, recognizing\nstudents' previous knowledge on a topic or their opinions . . . like a\nconstructivist approach (staff member).\nFostering student\nmotivation\nI took a history class that was very different in the way the teachers teach it\n. . . we had to create an imaginary world applying historical facts . . . so I\nwas really motivated and enthusiastic about this class (secondary female\nstudent).\nTeacher\ncharacteristics\nReferred to the\npsychological\ncharacteristics that\nemerge from the\nsocio-emotional and\npedagogical student\u00ad\nteacher interactions\nEmpathy One of the things I consider important for being a teacher in this program is\na commitment that can be related with empathy with the work you have to\ndo for these students. I think that is important at a program and students\nlevel. Beta students have different characteristics and maybe for some\nteachers that could be complicated (BETA workshop teacher).\nPassion Maybe in some occasions, students can ask questions that the teachers don't\nknow how to answer, but if you really have passion for what you do, you\ncan provide afterwards an adequate answer to the student (BETA socio-\nemotional coordinator).\nReflection And they have to be tolerant, because here in the program the teacher is\nconstantly evaluated, and it is an opportunity where you see what you can\nimprove to be a better teacher, and you have to accept your errors, and\nimprove them to become a better teacher (BETA secondary student).\nInteraction with\nstudents\nThe ability of active listening . . . you cannot work here if you do not have\nthe ability of active listening to your students and acknowledging what they\nhave to say (BETA workshop teacher).\ndeveloping knowledge. It has to present a cognitive chal-\nlenge for students. This is important, relevant.\"\nTeachers also agreed that knowledge is relevant, espe-\ncially a profound knowledge of specific content that is rele-\nvant to a discipline and in which the instructor has experience\nor specialization. However, the instructor needs to be able to\nadapt to the students' academic backgrounds and be able to\nuse interdisciplinary CK, especially when students have not\nhad the opportunity in their school curriculum to explore cer-\ntain concepts:\nI think the knowledge the teacher needs to have, has to be\nspecific, but at the same time he needs to be able to work on\ndifferent areas, because some of the students' schools are\noriented to the social sciences. So I need to provide examples\nbased on my knowledge of social sciences. (BETA science\ninstructor)\nTheme 2: Teaching\nTeaching was an important element for both groups (students\nand staff members). When addressing this topic, they both\nreferred to the term didactics, but with different connotations\nand meanings: For the staff members and teachers, it was\nrelated to instructional strategies, whereas for the students,\nthey used it as an adjective when referring to a teacher who\nwas enthusiastic and engaging. What needs to be taken into\nconsideration is that while students discussed their ideas,\nthey were always comparing their BETA instructors with\ntheir teachers in regular classrooms. These comparisons can\n8 SAGE Open\nbe translated into a critique of their current educational sys-\ntem, which the BETA students have experienced as rigid, as\nstated by a secondary student: \"At school it's like the teacher\ntalks, the student writes, and it's like a machine, a machine\nthat writes . . .\"\nBeing flexible. When students compared their BETA and reg-\nular school settings, the ideal BETA instructor is different\nfrom their schoolteacher because the latter rigidly structures\nhis or her classes around the contents of the national curricu-\nlum. For the students, this teacher has no room for innova-\ntion because he or she is \"forced\" to cover specific CK. One\nof the secondary students told a story about her science\nteacher at her school:\nShe had planned her course, but they rejected it because she has\nto follow what the Ministry [of Education] mandates, and she\nhad to do it differently. Her course had depth and was didactic\n[sic], but the government said no, because it has to be the same\nas in the other schools.\nOn the other side of the teaching spectrum, students per-\nceived that the BETA context promoted more flexibility in\ntheir teachers. Therefore, the BETA teacher was perceived as\nmore enthusiastic, with more freedom to deliver specific CK,\nand because it is a different context than the regular class-\nroom, he or she does not have the curriculum limitations that\nhinder students' learning: \"at my school I get bored listening\nto what I already understand, but BETA is different because\nthey tell you different things, more in-depth things\" (elemen-\ntary student).\nFor the BETA staff, flexibility was considered as impor-\ntant as disciplinary knowledge. For the managerial team, it\nwas particularly critical that the teachers be open to learn\nabout teaching strategies, because some instructors did not\nhave a background in education: \"it is important that they\nhave flexibility, a desire to learn, in terms of how they can\nteach in their classrooms\" (BETA curriculum director).\nBETA instructors saw flexibility as being able to\nchange direction when the development of a session is not\nyielding the expected results. One science teacher warns\nabout \"being attentive to the signals\" from the students in\nthe classroom. Other instructors shared their narratives\nabout how the program and students' characteristics\nrequired them to change their teaching practices in a posi-\ntive way: from a traditional teacher-centered approach to\na student-centered one. In BETA, instructors have to be\nable to move away from pre-established teaching schemes\nto modify and adapt lessons according to students' needs\nand preferences, favoring depth over quantity: \"I'm not\nsaying that you are going to modify the entire syllabus,\nbut a topic that you had planned for one session can turn\ninto two sessions, into a tremendous cognitive and socio-\naffective development for the students\" (humanities\ncourse instructor).\nPromoting active student participation. For BETA instructors,\npassive learning is not an option. Gifted students need to\nhave teachers who take into consideration students' prior\nknowledge and opinions, so they can construct their own\nperspectives on a topic and become independent learners:\n\"I think the teacher also needs to consider student participa-\ntion, recognizing students' previous knowledge on a topic\nor their opinions . . . like a constructivist approach\" (staff\nmember).\nPlanning meaningful instructional activities.As stated before,\nfor students, BETA is a different educational setting from\nschool, in which there is no pressure to deliver a curriculum\nand to administer standardized assessments. In this context,\nthe activities can be planned more freely by teachers; a valu-\nable advantage for students is when instructors are able to\ndesign activities in which they can apply the acquired knowl-\nedge to have a long-lasting learning experience:\nThese new activities are like . . . OK, we learned the content and\nnow, apply it, and we do so in different ways, because the\nknowledge can stay in our heads, not like in school that we study\nfor a test and it's gone. (Secondary student)\nAlso, these activities need to be varied to take into account\nstudents' interests, as stated by one female elementary stu-\ndent: \"our teacher has us work in groups, sometimes we read,\nand sometimes we do fun things such as drawing, writing,\nwe can even create our own test.\"\nBETAinstructors and staff are aware of the fact that gifted\nstudents are capable of solving complex problems. Therefore,\nit is important for teachers to design activities in which stu-\ndents are faced with different ways and strategies to address\na problem to also foster divergent thinking: \"We have to let\nstudents solve problems, and the thinking process has to be\nabsolutely divergent\" (science instructor).\nFostering student motivation.According to students, the way\nteachers approach their classes and the strategies they imple-\nment are crucial to ignite their motivation toward learning a\nparticular topic.\nWhat comes to my mind is innovation, creativity, to promote\nstudent motivation . . . because if the student is faced with\nsomething new, he's going to say yes, he's going to be motivated\nand is going to like it. On the other hand, if the teacher does\nrepetitive things, the student will be bored and tired, but if the\nteacher has the ability to create, innovate, the student will be\nmotivated . . . (Secondary female student)\nFor the students, as well as for the staff and instructors,\nhelping students motivate themselves is a reflection of the\nteachers' own motivation toward the student and the content\nin which they have specialized: \"The BETA teacher has to\nmotivate the student . . . the same motivation that the teacher\nG\u00f3mez-Arizaga et al. 9\nhas, double it, and tell the student you are good at this, this is\ngoing to help you a lot in the future\" (secondary student).\nFor the BETA staff, the instructor who is going to teach in\nthe program needs to have an initial motivation toward gifted\neducation, and ideally, this motivation is sustained over time.\nThey explained that historically, BETA instructors who were\nnot motivated have abandoned the program: \"it is a very spe-\ncific field, and he or she has to be motivated, interested,\nwanting to become a professional who knows about this\nfield,\" said the BETA director, reinforcing this idea.\nTheme 3: Socio-Emotional Characteristics\nEven though the students' discussion included different\nteacher competencies, students were particularly focused on\nteachers' socio-emotional characteristics. They do not see\nthe teacher as merely delivering content, but as someone\nwho can make a difference and have a positive impact in\ntheir lives. Socio-emotional characteristics were discussed\nby the BETA teachers and staff but did not have the promi-\nnence and the same significance they had for the students of\nthe program.\nEmpathy.As conceptualized by students, empathetic teach-\ners not only are capable of relating to the emotions expressed\nby their students when facing difficult situations but also\nknow how to treat students, acknowledging their back-\ngrounds, their abilities, and their different ways of thinking,\nas stated by one male student: \"I think that they need to have\nempathy, they have to be responsible for the topics they are\ngoing to address, because for example, there are students\nwith different religious beliefs.\" Empathy, in the interaction\nwith the student, is translated into a profound sense of respect\ntoward the student as an individual: \"He has to be tolerant, I\nthink, respectful of students' ideas even if he doesn't share\nthem . . .\" (elementary student). For the instructors, empathy\nalso can be translated into respect. One of the workshop\ninstructors narrated about how, throughout time, he encour-\naged his students to call him by his first name, and how stu-\ndents developed a relationship with him based on trust and\nacceptance: \"the teacher needs to have a certain empathy, to\nencourage student development and accept their different\nrealities.\"\nCloseness.For students, closeness is narrowly related to\nempathy and has three important dimensions: cognitive,\naffective, and physical. Cognitive closeness gives the oppor-\ntunity to debate and discuss ideas that are interesting for both\nthe student and the teacher: \"Here [in BETA] you can have a\ndebate with your teacher because you know you can reach\ncloseness . . .\" (secondary male student). Affective closeness\nhad to do with caring for the student beyond what happens\nwithin the classroom, for example, showing interest in their\npersonal experiences and stories: \"Because despite him\nbeing your teacher, you can always talk to him. He is like a\nperson who is very close to you\" (secondary student). Finally,\nphysical closeness was related to the teacher being physi-\ncally available for the student and not \"running away\" when\nthe session ends. Students understood this proximity with\ntheir teachers not as friendship, but as a person you can count\non and someone who can also learn from the student: \"In\nBETA, teachers leave the class to buy something and you can\ntalk to them . . . in schools they leave and you can't reach\nthem\" (elementary student).\nFor BETA instructors, closeness was understood as\nteachers' positive disposition toward their students: being\navailable when they approach and developing relationships\nthat are based on trust. One mathematics teacher stated, \"it\nmeans generating trust in the student, not only in her abili-\nties, but also that the student can initiate a conversation with\nme, so I can make a contribution . . .\" For the BETA staff,\ncloseness was also important, but they also emphasized\nboundaries, because as students are out of the school con-\ntext, the limits of the teacher\u00adstudent relationship might be\nobscured: \"it is important that the teacher can establish\ncloseness, but there are limits. It is very important for me\nthat the person has an emotional maturity . . . that has to be\npresent\" (BETA director).\nPassion.Students from the program, when referring to\nteacher characteristics, return to comparing their teachers in\nregular classrooms with the profile of the BETAteacher. This\ntime, they see the schoolteacher as someone who has lost his\nor her enthusiasm toward teaching and is, therefore, monoto-\nnous and repetitive; whereas, BETA teachers tend to love\nwhat they do: \"Teachers in school teach with a bad attitude,\nbut in BETA the teacher is here because he likes it, he loves\nit, so he teaches us with passion, with enthusiasm\" (second-\nary student).\nFor the BETA staff, passion is translated into a permanent\ninterest toward the discipline and this characteristic needs to\nbe evident to students, in a way that they are filled with their\nteachers' enthusiasm. For the BETA director, this passion is\ndisplayed by the instructor who is an ongoing learner: \"a per-\nmanent researcher who is always concerned about learning\nmore about his discipline.\"\nReflection. This domain, from the instructors and staff mem-\nbers' perspectives, was related to teachers' ability to reflect\non his or her own teaching, listen to other peers or colleagues,\nand make adaptations if necessary. One humanities instructor\nrecounted her experience about reflecting on her own teach-\ning practice, as she transitioned from being extremely\nteacher-centered to noticing that her students were bored,\nwhich motivated a desire for change: \"I am wrong, I need to\nchange, I can't continue this way . . . and I started to teach\ndifferently, more interactively, and the students woke up and\nparticipated in my class.\" For the staff members, highly val-\nued teachers were those who were self-critical and willing to\nlearn from feedback: \"The ability to be self-critical and to be\nalso open to external criticism, from informal feedback to a\nmore formal evaluation . . . that should be part of the teach-\ners' professional growth.\"\nStudents, who again made comparisons with their school-\nteachers, considered that teachers are so concerned with the\ncurriculum that they are afraid of making mistakes.Therefore,\nthey adhere to the textbook and do not make room for reflec-\ntion or innovation. For the students, an ideal characteristic of\nBETA instructors is for them to acknowledge their mistakes\nand improve their teaching, avoiding stagnation: \"if she is\nwrong, she has to know why, and then improve afterwards . .\n. and not do it again\" (elementary student).Also, they consid-\nered the process of teacher evaluation that occurs in BETA as\nan opportunity for the teacher to improve:\nWe do teacher evaluations, and the teacher can see how he can\nimprove. They have to accept their mistakes . . . the idea is not\nthat they feel that they messed-up, that they are bad teachers, but\nto improve and become a better teacher. (Secondary student)\nInteraction with students.This domain involved the genera-\ntion of an adequate socio-emotional classroom climate, in\nwhich the instructor shows an interest toward students'needs\nand characteristics, as stated by the BETA director: \"Another\nelement that I consider important for a teacher to have is a\ngenuine interest in contributing to his or her students' devel-\nopment.\" In this climate, the teacher also displays behaviors\nof assertive communication, conflict resolution, leadership,\ncordiality, and openness.\nFor all the participant groups, one key aspect was creat-\ning an environment for dialogue within the classroom in\nwhich respect was essential: \"To create opportunities for\ndialogue within the classroom, to learn to listen to what the\nstudent has to say, to show respect, to generate a climate of\ntrust and communication\" (science instructor). For the stu-\ndents, this environment is helpful to their learning, but the\nteacher needs to encourage the participation of all students:\n\"that the teacher helps the student to get out of his capsule\nand invites him to participate in the discussion\" (secondary\nstudent).\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study constitute an attempt to answer the\nquestion about teachers for gifted students posited in the\ntitle: How good is good enough? The participants responded\nin different ways, according to their experiences as learners,\ninstructors, and staff members of an enrichment program for\nthe gifted. For students, there seems to be a match between\ntheir unique characteristics as gifted individuals and the\nexpectations they have for their teachers (Mills, 2003), which\nincludes not only PCK competencies but also a set of socio-\nemotional characteristics that are critical for their engage-\nment in the learning process. On the other side, for teachers\nand staff members, CK and PCK (Kleickmann et al., 2013;\nShulman, 1986) were predominant in answering the afore-\nmentioned question.\nThese results are consistent with previous research that\nhas been conducted in Chile on the topic of teacher charac-\nteristics (Conejeros-Solar et al., 2013); however, a more inte-\ngrative and democratic understanding can be depicted when\ncommunity voices are incorporated (Freire, 1968). The edu-\ncational and interpersonal relationships experienced by the\nBETA community provide a firsthand view that can enrich\nthe analysis of the critical aspects needed for instructors of\ngifted students.\nThe results obtained from students and BETA staff and\nteachers are consistent with what authors in the field of\nteacher and teaching education have found, such as the\nimportance of CK and PCK (Shulman, 1986; VanTassel-\nBaska, 2005). However, the analyses made by both groups\nwho participated in the study have different implications\nin several realms, related to the role each has in the pro-\ngram; therefore, the positioning of the participants in their\ndiscourse (Frosh, Phoenix, & Pattman, 2003) and the lan-\nguage they use (i.e., experiential vs. technical) is depen-\ndent on the role and experiences that they have had in the\nprogram.\nStaff members of the programs and teachers were the ones\nwho mostly referred to CK as central for current and future\nteachers of the program. They perceive the teacher as being\nan expert, which translates into having a profound knowl-\nedge of the field (Kleickmann et al., 2013) and being deeply\nengaged with the content that he or she delivers to gifted\nstudents. This conceptualization, therefore, depicts a teacher\nwho has developed a certain expertise over time and has\nbeen actively involved in his or her disciplinary field.\nFurthermore, one aspect that for participants cannot be sepa-\nrated from CK is passion. For students, passion was under-\nstood as a teacher who is deeply engaged with the content\nand his or her students. As for teachers, passion was related\nto being \"deeply in-love\" with the content he or she has to\nRegarding pedagogical competencies or PCK, the views\nof both study groups were different based on their experi-\nences. Students tended to compare BETA instructors with\ntheir schoolteachers, and the overall conclusion is that the\nlatter have to adhere to a very rigid national curriculum with\nno space for innovation, whereas BETA instructors can act\nfreely because of a learning environment that is open to cre-\nativity and allows teachers to be flexible and innovative with\nhis or her teaching practices. This is consistent with the find-\nings of M\u00e1rquez and Mart\u00ednez (2011), who state that the\nteacher \"has to do things different from average because his\nstudents are different too\" (p. 39). For teachers and staff,\nflexibility is situated in the instructor, and they define it as\nbeing capable of creating diverse learning opportunities for\nstudents, being innovative in their teaching methods, and\nadapting to students' needs and interests (VanTassel-Baska,\nG\u00f3mez-Arizaga et al. 11\nConcerning teacher characteristics, both groups consider\ncognitive and socio-emotional aspects as essentials.Although\nstudents prioritized socio-affective traits, they did not neglect\ncognitive components, which is consistent with the results\nfound by Vialle and Tischler (2009). One of the salient socio-\naffective traits is closeness, a construct defined by students\nas a proximity in which teachers challenge and provide them\nwith opportunities to explore new ideas, listen actively, and\nare open and approachable. This is similar to what Gentry,\nSteenbergen-Hu, and Choi (2011) found in their study of\nexemplary teachers, referring to the importance of the teacher\ngenuinely \"connecting\" with their gifted students. We inter-\npret the construct of closeness, especially affective and phys-\nical, as particular of the BETA community where emotional\nbonds have been an implicit but critical aspect of the organi-\nzation. Also, from a cultural stance, there is the Chilean (and\nLatin American) culture that places high value on physical\ndemonstrations of affection.\nFor the BETA staff and teachers, a teacher's disposition to\npromote a positive and nurturing classroom climate was seen\nas critical interpersonal and intrapersonal characteristics\n(Eyre, 2003). Even if for both groups socio-affective traits\nare defined and manifested by participants in different ways,\nthey complement each other because for closeness to exist, a\nteacher must also be able to create an adequate classroom\nenvironment in which gifted students feel safe (Vogl &\nPreckel, 2014). Another relevant aspect mentioned by this\ngroup is the ability of teachers to be self-critical of their own\npractices, and learn from feedback, which is consistent with\nthe findings of Vialle and Quigley (2002). The latter can be\nrelated to another aspect of the organization, in which activi-\nties such as classroom observations and feedback meetings\nare peer-collaboration elements that have a major role in the\nBETA Program.\nLimitations\nThe study presents limitations such as a small sample size\nand a context in which these characteristics do not necessar-\nily extrapolate to other gifted programs worldwide.\nNevertheless, generalization is not the purpose of qualitative\ninquiry, \"but to understand how people create meaning in\ntheir worlds and make sense of particular situations\"\n(Remshardt & Flowers, 2007, p. 5). Another limitation is\nrelated to the approach we initially intended for data collec-\ntion, which had an open-ended stance based on the collection\nand analysis of emergent data from participants. However,\nbecause of time constrictions we had to implement a more\nstructured approach than the original design, which trans-\nlated into more structured questions and narrowed analyses.\nImplications for Practice\nThe richness and depth of the analyses made by community\nmembers offered a new perspective not only to be considered\nat a discursive level but also for challenging current views\nand making adaptations to the program's foundations, to\nachieve a more democratic and holistic approach (Freire,\n1968) to teachers' core competencies. Therefore, recruiting\npolicies and professional development activities in the BETA\nprogram were revised and reformulated, taking into account\nthese community perspectives. By incorporating partici-\npants' views and perceptions of teacher competencies, a\ndetailed profile could be outlined and, therefore, may help in\nthe process of hiring instructors and analyzing the perfor-\nmance of those who are already part of the program.\nHereunder, we offer a tentative proposal to address the\nhiring process of future teachers of the gifted:\nThe results provided evidence about the complexities of\nselecting a teacher for the gifted, and shed light on how good\nthis teacher must be, considering the intricate balance\nbetween CK, PCK, and socio-affective characteristics that\nare crucial in the teacher\u00adstudent relationship. In this con-\ntext, it can be easier to certify an instructor's CK, but inter-\npersonal and intrapersonal characteristics are much harder to\nevaluate; therefore, a selection process must be designed and\nconducted, which can include traditional and non-traditional\npractices such as the following:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 review of the CV;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 a personal statement that includes the prospective\nteacher's motivation to teach gifted students;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 interview with a program instructor who teaches in\nthe same (or similar) academic field to assess disci-\npline-based competencies;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 assessment of cognitive flexibility and socio-emo-\ntional variables such as empathy, assertiveness, and\nmotivation through the use of standardized tests;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 implementation of a 20-min activity with students so\nthey can assess cognitive and non-cognitive charac-\nteristics; and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 personal interview with the program's staff\nIf some of these practices are adopted, there can be more\nopportunities to find the best teachers and, therefore, to fos-\nter talent development in gifted students. These findings\nhave implications not only for recruitment but also for\nteacher education programs that could contribute to prepar-\ning future teachers of the gifted with an array of skills com-\nbining cognitive and pedagogical aspects, socio-affective\ndispositions, and reflective practices. The comparison made\nby the students in the study--who had the opportunity to\nattend a program for the gifted--with their teachers in their\nregular schools clearly shows this concern.\nFor the teachers who are already teaching in the program,\nit is relevant to establish more opportunities to reflect about\nwhat it is expected from them as teachers of gifted students\nand to provide support in those areas in which they feel they\nneed to improve. Therefore, the staff needs to design profes-\nsional development activities for teachers who can effectively\naddress weaknesses and establish a community that fosters\nthe areas of strength.\nImplications for Research\nClearly, further investigations need to be conducted on this\ntopic, especially to explore the phenomenon from the per-\nspective of other Chilean programs that work with gifted stu-\ndents. Also, cross-cultural research would be convenient to\nanalyze the profiles of teachers' competencies and character-\nistics from different cultural perspectives, to identify unique\nand distinctive teacher competencies from a culturally rele-\nvant angle.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This work was\nReferences\nBain, S.
