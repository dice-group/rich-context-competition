For suicides, females were more\nlikely than males to have a diagnosis of depression (55% v 36%), a current mental health problem (66% v\n42%), or a history of suicide attempts (25% v 13%). Firearms were the sole method of suicide in 65% of\nmales and 42% of females. Poisonings were more common in female than male suicides (37% v 12%).\nMale and female homicide victims were most likely to die from a handgun or a sharp instrument. Fifty\nseven percent of female homicides involved intimate partner violence, compared with 13% of male\nhomicides. Among female homicides involving intimate partner violence, 78% occurred in the woman's\nhome. White females had a higher rate of suicide than African-American females, but African-American\nfemales had a higher rate of homicide than white females.\nConclusions: The incidence, circumstances, and methods of fatal violence differ greatly between females\nand males. These differences should be taken into account in the development of violence prevention\nefforts.\nDeaths from violence exact a high burden of suffering\nworldwide.1 Suicides and homicides are at epidemic\nevery year from violence.3 The most common manner of\nviolent death for both females and males is suicide, followed\nby homicide.4 In the US, suicide and homicide rates have\nbeen consistently lower among females than males.4 5\nResearch has started to compare female and male suicides\nin terms of a variety of factors, including the demographic\ncharacteristics, and the methods that they used to kill\nthemselves (firearm, poisoning, etc). This research has\ngenerally found racial differences in suicides. Suicide is more\ncommon among whites than blacks for both females and\nmales.4 Age is also associated with suicide. Females and\nmales are more likely to commit suicide between the ages of\n25 and 44, and males are more likely to commit suicide after\nage 65.6 Although the majority of suicides are committed\nusing firearms, females are more likely than males to use\nother types of suicide methods, especially poisoning.6\nFemales tend to attempt suicide more frequently than males;\nhowever males' attempts are more likely to be fatal.7\nLikewise, extensive research has examined various aspects\nof female and male homicides. Most research has found\nracial differences in homicide rates of both females and\nmales. Blacks are more likely than whites to be homicide\nvictims.4 In addition, homicide rates vary by age. Males aged\nfor homicide.3 Firearms are the most commonly used method\nof homicide in the US, accounting for 56% of all homicides in\n2001.3 Firearm inflicted homicides are more common among\nmales than females.5 8 9 In the majority of female and male\nhomicides, the suspect/perpetrator is known to the victim.10\nHowever, female homicides are more likely than male\nhomicides to be committed by an intimate partner or family\nmember, whereas male homicides are more likely than\nfemale homicides to be committed by a stranger or an\nAlthough past research suggests that the mechanisms and\ncircumstances of deaths from violence in females and males\ndiffer, few details have been available concerning these\ndifferences. The findings from the first year of data from the\nNorth Carolina Violent Death Reporting System (NC-VDRS)\nprovide an opportunity to begin assessing traditional and\nnovel data on circumstances concerning deaths from violence\ngathered from multiple sources. This timely information will\nbe helpful to public health practitioners and others in their\nefforts to design and implement more effective violence\nprevention programs.\nMETHODS\nThe National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) is a\nnew US database of incidents where ``the intentional use of\nphysical force or power against oneself, another person, or\nagainst a group or community'' resulted in at least one death\nof the people involved in the incident. The system contains\ndetailed standardized information on victims and suspects,\ncharacteristics of the relationship(s) between victim(s) and\nAbbreviations: ICD-10, International Classification of Diseases, 10th\nrevision; NC-VDRS, North Carolina Violent Death Reporting System;\nNVDRS, National Violent Death Reporting System; OCME, Office of the\nChief Medical Examiner.\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nsuspect(s), descriptions of the mechanism/method that\nresulted in the death, and detailed information on the\ncircumstances that led to, or occurred during, the death. This\ninformation is gathered by trained abstracters from multiple\nsources, including death certificates, medical examiner\nrecords, law enforcement reports and crime laboratories.\nThe purpose and data collection methods used in the NVDRS\nare fully described elsewhere.18\nThe North Carolina Violent Death Reporting System (NC-\nVDRS) began collecting data on 1 January 2004. Eligible\nincidents are identified by matching death certificates and\nmedical examiner information using manner of death and\nNVDRS-selected International Classification of Disease, 10th\nThe data analyzed in this paper included all NVDRS-\neligible deaths that occurred in state residents who died in\nNorth Carolina during the 2004 calendar year. Age and race\nspecific mortality rates were calculated per 100 000 popula-\ntion with 95% confidence intervals. Mortality rates were not\ncomputed when the number of deaths was less than 15. The\nNC-VDRS is approved by the Public Health IRB at the\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the NC\nDivision of Public Health.\nRESULTS\nThere were a total of 1730 deaths from violence in North\nCarolina in 2004. Most of these deaths were North Carolina\nresidents (96%) who died in-state. This paper refers to these\nwere also examined on the 330 suspects on whom informa-\ntion was available who were involved in these 1674 deaths,\nincluding suspects who were not state residents.\nviolence by gender were much lower in females (8.8; 95% CI\nsuicide and homicide, there were at least three times as many\nviolent deaths among males compared to females. There were\nfemale homicides and 449 male homicides. In contrast to the\nmortality patterns between females and males, the within-\ngender percentage of mortality for suicides and homicides\nwas identical: 61% of both females and males died by suicide\nand 35% of both females and males were victims of\nhomicides (fig 1).\nComparable gender patterns for deaths from suicide and\nhomicide were not observed for deaths from unintentional\nfirearms (2 females v 12 males), legal intervention (0 females\nmales). Because the number of these deaths was only 4.5% of\nthe total, the remainder of the results focuses only on suicide\nand homicide and considers them separately.\nSuicide\nlargely concentrated in whites (table 1). The distribution by\nrace was similar for female and male suicides (approximately\n90% white). However, the white to African American suicide\nThe age profiles of NC suicides varied by gender in 2004\npopulation was observed for females between ages 45 to 54\nSuicides were most often initiated in a house or apartment\nFirearms were the most common method of suicide overall\nThe majority of firearms used were handguns (66%). In\ncontrast to males, the method of suicide among females was\nalmost equally divided between firearms (42%) and poisons\n(37%) (fig 2), accounting for 79% of female suicides.\nHanging, strangulation, and asphyxiation were the third\nmost common method of suicide in females and the second\nmost common method in males.\nOver one half of female (62%) and male suicide victims\n(56%) were reported by a friend or family member as having\na depressed mood immediately prior to death (table 2). When\na medical history was recorded, 66% of the females who\ncommitted suicide were reported as having a current mental\nhealth problem--most were a diagnosis of depression (55%).\nThis proportion of depression in females was much higher\nthan was reported for male suicides (36%). Female suicide\nvictims (58%) were nearly twice as likely as males (33%) to\nhave been currently receiving mental health services, defined\nas having a current prescription for a psychiatric medication,\nor seeing a mental health professional within the two months\nprior to suicide. One quarter of females who committed\nsuicide (n = 55), in contrast to one eighth of males (n = 90),\nhad a history of at least one previous suicide attempt. Less\nthan one quarter of the females and males disclosed their\nintent to commit suicide and less than a one third left a\nsuicide note.\nNew types of information in the NVDRS from medical\nexaminers and law enforcement appear to shed light on the\ncircumstances associated with suicide. One example is a\nhistory of having had a crisis or an acute precipitating event\nthat appeared to have contributed to the suicide. These are\ndefined in the NVDRS as physical health, intimate partner,\nother relationship, job, school, financial, or legal problems\nthat occurred within two weeks of the death or were\nscheduled to occur within two weeks after the victim's\ndeaths.\nA crisis was reported to have occurred in 22% of the 234\nfemales and 29% of the 782 males who committed suicide.\nHomicide (m\nLegal intervention (m\nUnintentional firearm\n(m\nUndetermined intent (m\nDeaths within gender (%)\nSuicide (m\nMales\nFemales\nFigure 1 Manner of death by sex.

Only two female suicides were perpetrators of\nintimate partner violence (0.9%).\nHomicide\n11.7). There is greater interracial variation in homicide rates\n(table 3) than observed in suicide rates (table 1) for males.\nFirearms and sharp instruments were the predominant\nmethods of homicide among females and males (fig 3).\nPatterns, however, differed by sex. Firearms resulted in 71%\nof the homicides in males (n = 318), in contrast to 48% in\nfemales (n = 64). The handgun was the most common type\nof firearm used in male (66%) and female (61%) homicides.\nSharp instruments were used more often in female homicides\nthan males (2%) were killed by hanging, strangulation, and\nsuffocation.\nFor those homicide cases in which the number of suspects\ncould be determined (70% in females and 61% in males), the\nrelationship of the victim to the suspect (table 4) differed by\nsex. When known, the suspect in female homicides was more\nlikely to be a spouse, ex-spouse, boyfriend/girlfriend, or\nformer boyfriend/girlfriend (n = 38, 28%), than in male\nhomicides (n = 19, 4%). A stranger was reported only once\nas the suspect in all female homicides (0.7%) in contrast to\nthe suspect being reported as a stranger (n = 14) in male\nhomicides (3%). Rape or sexual assault (n = 6) was reported\nfor 6% of the females homicides and none of the male\nhomicides.\nArgument, abuse, or conflict were the most common\nprecipitating factors of female (n = 79, 76%) and male\narguments that resulted in death differed by gender.\nIntimate partner violence was listed as a circumstance in 98\nNC homicides in 2004 and was the leading cause of female\nhomicide (57%), in contrast to male homicide (13%). The\ndecedent was female in 60% of homicides that involved\nintimate partner violence. Most (78%) of the fatalities in\nfemales from intimate partner violence occurred in the\nwoman's home.\nDISCUSSION\nIn 2004, suicides were the leading cause of death from\nviolence in North Carolina and the US.

North Carolina\nFemales Males\nRace\nAge (years)\nii12 Sanford, Marshall, Martin, et al\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nnational data, the 2004 NC-VDRS data found that the\nmortality rates from suicide and homicide were consistently\nlower in females than in males. For both males and females,\nsuicide rates were about twice as high as homicide rates (rate\nratios of 1.7 in both males and females), and the proportion\nof suicides (61%) and homicide (35%) to all deaths from\nviolence and unintentional firearms was the same for NC\nmales and females. These data are supported by other larger\nand more long term studies on homicides and suicides, and\nsuggest that these new insights may be immediately useful\npublic health information.\nNC-VDRS data indicate that there are several critical\nfactors specific to death from violence in females that are\nnot as frequently reported in males. Females who committed\nsuicide in NC were more likely than males to have a medical\ndiagnosis of depression and females were also more likely\nthan males to have a history of suicide attempts. Intimate\npartner violence was the dominant cause of female homicide,\nwhereas a male homicide more often resulted from other\ntypes of arguments or conflict. The suspect in homicides was\nmore likely to have been a spouse/ex-spouse/intimate partner\nor former intimate partner of females than males. Among NC\nAfrican American females, the homicide rate exceeded the\nsuicide rate, whereas the opposite was true for white females.\nDespite decades of research into suicide, many key\nquestions remain unanswered. The NC-VDRS clearly\ndemonstrated that women commit suicide by poison more\noften than men. However, many more years of information\non circumstances will need to be collected if we are to\nunderstand why females select poisons over firearms, and\nwhat are the inciting events. We need to know how we can\ncapitalize on the advantages afforded by the facts that\nfemales are more likely than males to have seen a\nprofessional for depression or have had a prior suicide\nattempt, and that females are more likely than males to\nsurvive a suicide attempt. Research suggests that firearms\nhave a higher case fatality rate than poisonings.19 Therefore,\nin terms of developing and implementing intervention\nstrategies, the difference in the choice of suicide method\nmay be the most profound difference between females and\nmales since it the main reason that females are more likely\nthan males to survive a suicide attempt.\nNC-VDRS data strongly suggest that more resources should\nbe devoted to the primary prevention of suicide, and support\nthe Institute of Medicine's recommendations on reducing\nsuicides.20 This includes funding more gatekeeper training,\ncurrently underway in North Carolina; the piloting of\nprograms for coping and resiliency training as part of the\ncurriculum for school aged children and continuing educa-\ntion for seniors; and the development and dissemination to\nprimary care providers of tools for the recognition, screening,\nand referral to mental health professionals of patients with\nTable 2 Suicide event characteristics, North Carolina residents, 2004*\nFemales Males\nn % n %\nDeath or suicide of family member or friend contributed to suicide 22 9.8 36 5.0\nTable 3 Homicide demographics and rate per 100 000 population, North Carolina\nFemales Males\nRace\nAge (years)\nDeaths from violence in females and males ii13\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nacute and chronic suicide risk factors.20 Also necessary are\nimproved availability of and access to mental health services\nand more effective suicide prevention counseling for youth\nand the elderly. Mental health services should be assessed to\nensure that they are specific to the different needs of females\nand males, and that they are responsive to indicators of\nimminent crises that may lead to suicide. Although poisons\nwere used in many suicides among females, firearms were\nthe most common methods used in suicides among males\nand females. Research by others suggests that limiting access\nto firearms may be an important and effective strategy for\nHomicides in females showed some similarity to male\nhomicides. However, NC-VDRS data and other sources,11\u00ad\nleading role in many female homicides. A study of female\nhomicides among North Carolina adolescents also revealed\nthat female adolescents were most commonly killed by an\nintimate partner.23 Primary prevention of intimate partner\nviolence should include programs to teach adolescents about\nhealthy relationships and how to prevent dating violence. A\ngreater awareness of intimate partner violence and its\npotential for homicide among the general public may be a\npowerful agent for long term change. Thus, the provision of\nfrequent, timely, and accurate statistics via the national and\nstate VDRS programs is, in itself, an intervention. For the\nshort term acute phase of these attacks, dedicated policing\nteams, stronger legislation aimed at protecting females, more\nsupport for, and use of, domestic violence protective orders,\nand the provision of safe havens and support networks, are\ncritical prevention initiatives that need to be supported and\nstrengthened at the local, state, and federal level.\nOne of the strengths of the North Carolina death\ninvestigation system is the North Carolina Office of the\nChief Medical Examiner (OCME), which oversees a statewide\nsystem of trained medical examiners who investigate all non-\nnatural deaths, complete most sections of the death\ncertificate, and complete a standardized field investigation\nreport that is reviewed by an OCME pathologist. Most deaths\nfrom violence are autopsied and are part of the data\nabstracted by NC-VDRS staff. Almost all North Carolina law\nenforcement agencies provide incident reports to the NC-\nVDRS. This study also benefited from being associated with\nthe NVDRS as it employs standard and consistent definitions\nand case-finding methodologies for all deaths from violence\nfrom multiple sources of data.\nHowever, because the system is based on the collection of\ndata from existing records, the completeness of the informa-\ntion is limited by the accuracy and depth of detail recorded\nby sources such as the medical examiner investigating a\nnon-natural death and law enforcement officers completing\nincident reports. A specific weakness of the NC-VDRS data is\nDeaths within gender (%)\nMales\nFemales\nFirearm\n(m\n=\nPoisoning\n(m\n=\nHanging*\n(m\n=\nSharp\ninstrument (m\n=\nOther/Unk \n(m\n=\nM\nultiple methods (m\n=\nFigure 3 Method of death by sex for homicides.

Another\nspecific weakness is that circumstances information recorded\nby medical examiners amd law enforcement may be subject\nto underreporting, for example with regard to history of\nmental illness or previous attempts for suicide victims.\nUnderreporting could occur if relatives or family members\nwere unaware or unwilling to provide this information, or if\nauthorities were unable or neglected to ascertain this\ninformation.\nCONCLUSION\nFatal violence in females is distinct from fatal violence in\nmen. Current prevention initiatives addressing violence in\nfemales need to be strengthened, and new gender-specific\ninitiatives developed, if we are to successfully address\nviolence that leads to fatalities. The primary prevention of\nintimate partner violence, including dating violence, and\nmore effective mental health services, particularly when a\ndiagnosis of depression or a suicide attempt has been made,\nare two pressing areas that these data suggest should be\naddressed. As most deaths from violence are suicides, further\nresearch should examine and develop effective therapeutic\nand programmatic approaches to individuals with diagnoses\nof depression and suicide attempts. Finally, research is\nneeded to develop and evaluate effective, comprehensive,\nand evidence-based primary prevention programs for all\ntypes of violence that have the potential to result in death.\n"
