Research has been oriented toward elucidating the links between religion and mental health. The pur-\npose of this article is to further our knowledge in this area by examining the effect of religious activity on depressive\nsymptomatology among community-dwelling elderly persons with cancer. We also test whether these effects differ be-\ntween Blacks and Whites.\nMethods. We use two waves of data collected from a community-dwelling sample of elderly persons living in North\nCarolina. Depressive symptomatology is measured using four subscales from the CES-D 20 scale: somatic-retarded ac-\ntivity, depressed affect, positive affect, and interpersonal relations. Measures of religious activity include service atten-\ndance, religious devotion, and watching or listening to religious programs.\nResults. The findings indicate that among Blacks with cancer, religious activity is related to lower levels of depres-\nsive symptomatology; no such relationship is found for respondents with other illnesses or no illness. Further, the ef-\nfects of religious activity are stronger among Blacks than Whites.\nDiscussion. The analyses lend support to the hypothesis that religious activity is a strong predictor of depression in\nelderly adults with cancer. This finding, however, is not as strong as we had anticipated.\nRESEARCH has explored the links between religion\nPollner, 1989; Williams, Larson, Buckler, Heckmann, &\nhealth (Broyles & Drenovsky, 1992; St. George & McNa-\nFreeman, & Manheimer, 1995). A subset of this research\nhas focused on the way religion functions for people who\nare ill or functionally impaired (Idler, 1995).\nThe purpose of this article is to expand upon the extant\nresearch that has focused on the function of religion among\nindividuals with cancer. Drawing on previous work in this\narea, we develop and test several hypotheses using a large\nsample of community-dwelling elderly people. We also go\nbeyond earlier research in two ways. First, we include a\nnumber of measures that may influence the relationship be-\ntween religion and cancer. Second, using a sample of Black\nand White elderly persons, we examine the relationships\namong religion, cancer, and mental health and how they\ndiffer by race. Given the importance of religion among el-\nderly Blacks (Chatters & Taylor, 1994), these differences\nmay prove substantial.\nCancer as a Life Stress\nResearchers have examined the links between religion\nand cancer because of the stress that often accompanies a\ncancer diagnosis. In a study of women with breast cancer,\nJohnson and Spilka (1991) noted some problems associated\nwith cancer:\nPerhaps nowhere is misery greater than when an individual\ncontracts cancer. Potential terminality immediately becomes\na salient issue, along with expectations of pain, anguish, and\nsuffering. Physical problems are compounded with a host\nof psychological difficulties, not the least of which are feel-\nings of isolation, separation, dependency, and helplessness\nIn these few sentences, the authors mention a number of\nstressors for persons with cancer. First and foremost is the\npossibility of death. An abundant body of literature has ex-\namined the stresses and coping mechanisms associated with\n& Powell, 1990). Perhaps a worse stressor than approaching\ndeath, however, is an uncertain prognosis following a can-\ncer diagnosis. The uncertainty associated with cancer may\nforce patients to change or postpone their goals and expec-\ntations for the future (Rowland, 1989). Moreover, because\nthe course of cancer can be unpredictable, normal methods\nof active coping may prove maladaptive (Hilton, 1989).\nEven in remission the cancer patient faces considerable un-\ncertainty and the attendant stress. As one author notes, \"The\nremission phase, then, is a process of adapting, not to a ter-\nJohnson and Spilka (1991) also note fears associated\nwith pain and suffering. Not only do many cancer patients\nsuffer discomfort and pain from the disease itself, but they\nmay also suffer side effects from the cancer treatments. For\nmany, chemotherapy causes vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea,\nalopecia, and other physical problems (Holland & Lesko,\n1989). Radiation therapy may produce similar symptoms as\nwell as bring about significant changes in the appearance of\nCancer patients also face significant stressors in their so-\ncial lives. One problem is the potential inability to fulfill\nnormal role expectations in the workplace, in the commu-\nnity, or at home. Parsons (1951) defined persons with an ill-\nness as being in the \"sick role\" and as such are exempt\nfrom the expectations of normal role functioning. However,\nthis exemption does not necessarily mean that cancer pa-\ntients will not despair over their inability to attend to daily\ntasks or fulfill social obligations.\nCancer patients may also feel tension due to their need of\nassistance from others. Cancer patients who need assistance\non a regular basis may begin to feel helpless or dependent.\nThese feelings may, in turn, affect their self-image and\nbring about more feelings of despair. This problem is espe-\ncially acute among elderly persons who need assistance\ntending to household tasks, getting to the hospital for treat-\nment, or doing chores outside the home, such as shopping\nfor groceries. In short, cancer patients may suffer acute so-\ncial stresses as a result of their disease.\nReligion and Cancer Patients\nCancer patients may use a variety of mechanisms to cope\nwith and adapt to the disease. Few coping strategies, how-\never, are as beneficial to the patient as religion. Religion\ncan benefit individuals with cancer by providing beliefs re-\nlated to death and suffering as well as support from clergy\nor fellow church members. Indeed, recent research suggests\nthat religion is an effective means of coping with cancer. In\nthe remainder of this section we will review some of this\nresearch.\nPrivate Religious Activities\nCohen and Lazarus (1983) argued that cognitive ap-\npraisal of a situation is important for deciding what coping\nstrategies are best used in that situation. From their per-\nspective, there exist two types of appraisals of a potentially\nstressful situation. The first, primary appraisal, refers to a\njudgment of whether the condition or event poses a signifi-\ncant danger. Secondary appraisal refers to the process by\nwhich an individual decides what resources are available to\ncope with a problem.\nIndividuals can make three types of primary appraisals:\nthat the event will have no effect on them, that the effect\nwill be beneficial, or that the effect will be harmful. In\nterms of making an appraisal, religion may provide individ-\nuals with a framework through which they are less likely to\nsee their disease as harmful. Numerous stories in the Bible\ntestify to the importance of strong faith in times of adver-\nsity and to the rewards that come to those who stand with\nGod in the worst of times. Further, because the Christian\nfaith places importance upon life after death, religious peo-\nple facing death may be more at ease under those circum-\nstances. Rather than seeing death as an unknown, individu-\nals with strong religious beliefs may instead look forward\nto an afterlife that is better than their current situation.\nStudies have shown that elderly persons who engage in de-\nvotional activities experience less fear of death. For exam-\nple, drawing on a sample of community-dwelling elderly,\nKoenig (1988) found that those elders who reported more\nfrequent prayer activity during times of stress were more\nlikely to report little or no fear of death.\nReligion may also benefit the cancer patient in terms of\nthe secondary appraisal. Religious people may see their ties\nwith God as a source of power and strength that is best used\nin times of trouble. A number of authors have noted the ef-\nficacy of devotional activities or feeling close to God for in-\ncreased mental well-being (e.g., Ellison, 1991; Pollner,\n1989). Many of these findings result from nationally repre-\nsentative samples drawing on relatively healthy popula-\ntions. For the individual with cancer, the beneficial effects\nof private religiosity may be even greater. Jenkins and\nPargament (1988) showed that among cancer patients,\nthose who believed that God was in control of their situa-\ntion had better self-esteem and less psychological distur-\nbance. A number of other studies have shown that cancer\npatients often rely upon private religious activities to cope\nwith their illness. For example, using a sample of hospital-\nized cancer patients, Sodestrom and Martinson (1987)\nfound that patients most frequently relied on prayer to cope\nwith their illness. Similarly, Halstead and Fernsler (1994)\nreported that in a sample of long-term cancer survivors,\nprayer was the most commonly cited coping strategy. Other\nstudies of women with breast cancer also have documented\nthe importance of prayer for coping with illness (Johnson &\nPublic Religious Activities\nIndividuals with cancer may also benefit from public re-\nligious activity, such as attending church services. Re-\nsearchers in religion and health often refer to the relation-\nship between public religious activities and health as the\nsocial cohesiveness hypothesis (Idler, 1987). From this per-\nspective, it is commonly thought that involvement in a reli-\ngious community may be beneficial for a number of rea-\nsons. First, as Berger (1967) argued, regular fellowship\nwith others of similar beliefs is important for maintaining\none's own beliefs. During stressful times when religious\nfaith may waiver, the spiritual support and fellowship pro-\nvided by other congregants are especially important for the\nmaintenance of religious beliefs.\nThe ability to maintain religious faith is important in two\nways. First, as previously noted, religious beliefs can pro-\nvide comfort and hope in the face of severe circumstances.\nSecond, another sort of religious belief, theodicy, may also\nbe important for persons with cancer. In essence, a religious\ntheodicy provides a framework through which individuals\ncan find meaning and understanding in suffering (Berger,\ncancer patients can better come to terms with their disease\nand, in so doing, find comfort.\nThe second way in which participation in church activi-\nties could be beneficial for those with cancer is that the\nchurch provides an avenue through which patients can find\nothers to pray with and for them. Although Sodestrom and\nMartinson (1987) cited prayer as the most common coping\nstrategy of their sample of cancer patients, the next two\nmost cited strategies were praying with others and having\nothers pray on their behalf. In their study of breast cancer\npatients, Johnson and Spilka (1991) showed the importance\nof interaction with the clergy and intercessory prayer for\nthe well-being of the women. They argued that the prayers\nof others show concern and provide the women with a\ngreater sense of self-worth. Moreover, the prayers of others\nmay also reinforce the belief that God is in control of the\nsituation.\nThird, interaction with a religious community may also\nbe an important avenue through which patients receive in-\nstrumental and emotional support. Researchers have shown\nthat social support is an important resource for helping peo-\nple cope with stressful situations (Cohen & Wills, 1985;\nLin & Ensel, 1989). Church members may visit patients in\nthe hospital or in their homes to provide companionship,\nbring needed items, or help perform necessary chores. Sim-\nilarly, Ellison and George (1994) showed that persons ac-\ntive in a religious group had higher levels of non-kin net-\nwork ties, received support, and quality of support. Bradley\n(1995) found similar results using a nationally representa-\ntive sample. In a recent article using data collected from a\nsample of elderly persons, Idler and Kasl (1997) showed\nthat respondents who attend church regularly report having\nmore close friends and more contact with friends and kin.\nThe Importance of Religionfor African Americans\nResearchers have documented the importance of splitting\nsamples according to race when analyzing the relationship\nbetween religion and well-being (Ellison, 1995; Ferraro &\nses, we split the sample by race into groups of Blacks and\nWhites. There are two reasons often cited for splitting sam-\nples according to race (see a review by Chatters & Taylor,\n1994). First, several studies have attested that African\nAmericans report higher rates of public religious participa-\ntion than do Whites (Roof & McKinney, 1987; Levin, Tay-\nlor, & Chatters, 1994; Taylor, Chatters, Jayakody, & Levin,\n1996) and are more likely to report that religion is impor-\nern Blacks, Ellison and Sherkat (1995) have termed the\nchurch a \"semi-involuntary institution\" given such high\nrates of participation in that segment of the population.\nSecond, and perhaps more importantly, researchers have\nargued that the effect of religious activity on health should\nbe stronger for Blacks than for Whites. Several reasons are\nposited to account for this relationship. First, because Blacks\nface greater discrimination and barriers to institutions (e.g.,\nhealth care) and status (e.g., high-paying employment) that\nare beneficial for health and well-being, they must find alter-\nnate avenues to success and well-being (Hummer, 1996;\navenue for Black Americans is the church. A number of au-\nthors have pointed to the importance of the church in the his-\ntory of Black America; it has served as a source of commu-\nand of help to those in the congregation and community\n(Caldwell, Greene, & Billingsley, 1994; Chang, Williams,\nson, in press), and as a facilitator of social and health inter-\nin press). In a study that compared Black and White church\ncongregations, Chaves and Higgins (1992) showed that\nBlack congregations are more active on civil rights issues\nand in helping community members who face economic\nhardship.\nAnother possible explanation for the stronger relation-\nship between religion and health for Blacks is the actual ac-\ntivity that takes place within religious settings in Black\nchurches. Gilkes (1980) argued that several activities that\ntake place in those churches are unique and can be modified\nto have therapeutic value. The practices she mentions are\nspeaking and singing about suffering, discussing problems\npresented by persecutors, providing a safe place to \"act\nout,\" and giving validation to the experiences of fellow\ncongregants. Griffith, English, and May field (1980) pro-\nvided evidence for the therapeutic value of Black churches\nthrough their ethnographic study of Wednesday night\nprayer meetings in a Black church. There is ample warrant\nto believe that church and religious activities serve a spe-\ncial place in the lives of African Americans. For that rea-\nson, religious activity should have a greater effect for them\nthan for Whites.\nLimitations of Earlier Research\nPrevious research on religious behavior among cancer\npatients must be commended for its depth and ability to\nelicit sensitive information from a very ill population.\nHowever, the scope of these studies is also somewhat of a\nweakness. That is, to obtain the information they did, most\nof the researchers relied on small samples of patients in ad-\nvanced stages of the disease (e.g., Yates, Chalmer, St.\nJames, Follansbee, & McKegney, 1981). Further, some of\nthe studies, (e.g., Johnson & Spilka, 1991; Mickley &\nSoeken, 1993) relied only upon women for their research.\nAlthough the studies have provided important insights into\nthe role of religion for those with cancer, the results are\nhard to generalize at the community level. Further, because\nthe sample sizes have been small, previous researchers\nwere unable to make distinctions based on the importance\nof religion in different social contexts. Using a large sample\nof community-dwelling elderly adults, we reexamine the\nrelationship between religion and cancer on a broader scale,\nincorporating the findings of previous research and drawing\non the previous theoretical discussion.\nHypotheses\nIn this article we address four primary questions. First,\ndo respondents diagnosed with cancer report more religious\nactivity than their counterparts without the disease? Sec-\nond, do respondents with cancer benefit in terms of depres-\nsive symptomatology from their religious activity? Third,\nare the effects of religious activity on depressive symp-\ntomatology greater for the portion of the sample with can-\ncer compared to those without the disease? And finally,\ngiven prior research and theory on race, religion, and well-\nbeing, do the hypothesized relationships differ between\nBlacks and Whites? Based on these questions we offer the\nfollowing hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1: Both Blacks and Whites with cancer will\nreport more frequent religious activity\nacross time compared to those without the\ndisease.\nHypothesis 2: Among Blacks and Whites with cancer,\nmore frequent religious activity predicts\ndecreases in depressive symptomatology.\nHypothesis 3: The effect of religious activity on changes\nin depressive symptomatology will be\ngreater for Blacks and Whites with cancer\nthan for those without the disease.\nHypothesis 4: The relationship between religious activ-\nity and depressive symptomatology will\nbe greater for Blacks than for Whites.\nMETHODS\nSample\nData for this study come from the Duke Established Pop-\nulations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE).\nIn addition to the North Carolina site, where these data\nwere collected, three other sites make up the research pro-\ngram initiated by the National Institute on Aging: the Uni-\nversity of Iowa, Yale University, and Harvard University.\nFor the North Carolina sample, the data were collected\nfrom five contiguous counties in northern central North\nCarolina, four rural and one urban. The entire sample size\nis 4,162 persons; approximately half come from the urban\ncounty and the other half are dispersed between the four\nrural counties. Detailed explanations of the sample and\nsampling procedure can be found elsewhere (Cornoni-\nOne of the primary missions of the Duke EPESE is the\nexamination of differences between Blacks and Whites in\nhealth-related variables. Blacks were oversampled with the\nintent that 55% of the survey population be Black. Sample\nweights were then developed to adjust sample distributions\nfor probability of selection within households of varying\nsizes, to adjust for differential nonresponse, and to match the\ndemographic characteristics of the five-county area, as esti-\nmated by the U.S. Bureau of Census. These weights are es-\npecially important in that they redistributed responses ac-\ncording to the racial distribution of the population, which is\n36% Black and 64% non-Black. The fact that the weighted\ndata are based on a stratified oversample, however, renders\nestimates for Blacks more precise than they would otherwise\nbe. Results presented in this article are based on weighted\ndata in order to permit population estimates. Sample and\nsubgroup sizes, however, are reported in unweighted form.\nThe 4,162 persons interviewed were drawn from a total\nThe first and fourth waves of data were collected in 1986\nand 1989 through personal interviews. Two telephone\nwe use data only from the first and fourth waves. The sam-\nattrition by the fourth wave. We use weighted data to cor-\nrect for the nonresponse bias occurring due to attrition.\nTable 1 displays mean levels of the variables used in the\nanalyses, by race.\nMeasurement\nDepressive symptomatology.--Depression was measured\nusing four subsets of the 20-item CES-D scale: somatic-\nretarded activity (7 items, e.g., \"I did not feel like eating;\nmy appetite was poor,\" \"I could not get going\"; a = .71),\ndepressed affect (5 items, e.g., \"I felt depressed,\" \"I felt\nlonely\"; a = .72), positive affect (3 items: \"I felt hopeful\nabout the future,\" \"I was happy,\" \"I enjoyed life\"; a = .53),\nand interpersonal relations (2 items: \"People were un-\nfriendly,\" \"I felt that people disliked me\"; a = .67). For\neach item, respondents were asked whether they had felt\nthat way during the past week; each subscale was con-\nstructed by summing the number of affirmative responses.\nWe examined these four different dimensions of depression\nbecause religious behavior may have differential effects de-\npending upon the facet of depression being studied. Earlier\nresearch and our own factor analyses (not shown) showed\nthat the four dimensions of depression listed here are the\nprimary factors that make up the scale (Ensel, 1986;\nRadloff, 1977). Higher scores for all the scales indicate\nworse outcomes, but for positive affect higher scores indi-\ncate better outcomes.\nCancer.--During each of the four waves, respondents\nwere asked whether they had been told by a doctor that\nTable 1.

If respondents reported having cancer, or\nwere suspected of having cancer, they were then asked\nwhat type of cancer they had. The types of cancer included\nin the survey were lung, breast, colon, lymphoma, leuke-\nmia, melanoma, other skin cancer, and all other cancers. If\nrespondents reported having cancer they were coded one\nand all others were coded zero. We also coded respondents\nwho reported having skin cancer other than melanoma in\nthe zero category in order to prevent the inclusion of per-\nsons with non-life-threatening illnesses. Because the num-\nber of respondents who had cancer only was low (73 in the\nfirst wave), we chose to include in this group those respon-\ndents who reported having cancer and another illness.\nHowever, since we made comparisons with a \"pure\" other\nillness group, any differences we observed should have\nbeen due either to the cancer itself or some combination of\ncancer and other illness. Regardless of which of these op-\ntions is correct, the driving force behind the difference will\nbe cancer. There was also the possibility of contamination\nin that respondents may have been diagnosed with cancer\nor another illness between the first and second in-person\nwaves. To ensure the purity of the groups, we eliminated\nfrom the analyses all those respondents who were diag-\nnosed with cancer between these two waves (n = 92). This\nmade us certain that our comparisons were between respon-\ndents diagnosed with cancer and all others without cancer.\nBecause we were not particularly interested in the other ill-\nness group, we did not eliminate those respondents who\ncontracted another illness between the waves. The sample\nsizes for the three illness groups were cancer, 251; other ill-\nOther illness.--To test whether the relationship between\ncancer, religion, and mental health is actually a function of\nhaving cancer as opposed to some other chronic illness, we\nincluded in our analyses an indicator of other illnesses. For\nthis measure, if respondents reported having high blood\npressure, diabetes, a heart attack, or stroke, but did not re-\nport having cancer, they were coded one and others were\ncoded zero. Further, a no illness group was created for\nwhich those with no illness were coded one and others zero.\nFunctional impairment.--In order to determine whether\nthe relationship between religion and cancer might be due to\nphysical functioning, we included a measure of impairment\nin our analyses: the total Rosow-Breslau (1966) scale of ac-\ntivity limitation. The scale consists of three items that mea-\nsure whether the respondent can (a) do heavy work, (b)\nwalk up a flight of stairs, and (c) walk a half mile. Variables\nwere coded zero if respondents could do the activity and one\nif they could not; higher scores indicate greater impairment.\nService attendance.--Respondents were asked, \"About\nhow often do you go to religious meetings or services?\" The\nsix response categories were (a) never/almost never, (b) once\nor twice a year, (c) every few months, (d) once or twice a\nmonth, (e) once a week, and (f) more than once a week.\nReligious media.--Respondents were asked, \"About how\noften do you watch religious services or religious programs\non T.V. or listen to them on the radio?\" This item used the\nsame response categories as service attendance.\nReligious devotion.--Respondents were asked, \"How\noften do you spend time in private religious activities, such\nas prayer, meditation, or Bible study?\" The five response\ncategories used were (a) rarely or never, (b) a few times a\nmonth, (c) once a week, (d) two or more times a week, and\n(e) daily.\nSocial interaction.--Because some of the benefits re-\nceived from church attendance are due to social resources,\nwe included social relationship measures. The first such\nscale consisted of five items measuring amounts of social\ninteraction. The five items were number of (a) children, (b)\nother relatives, and (c) friends respondents see during a\nmonth; (d) how often respondents talked on the phone in\nthe past week; and (e) whether respondents were members\nof a church, club, or other organization. For the first three\nitems, scores ranged from zero to ten or more and for the\nphone item scores ranged from zero to seven or more. The\nscale was created by summing the number scores for each\nvariable.\nSocial interaction satisfaction (a = .43; r = .31).--This\ntwo-item scale measures respondents' satisfaction with the\namount of time they see friends and relatives. Responses\ninclude wanting to see others more often, the same amount,\nor less often; higher scores indicate greater satisfaction. The\nmeasures of social interaction and social interaction satis-\nfaction were taken from the Duke Social Support Inventory\n(Landerman, 1994) and have been used in previous studies\nof religion and well-being (e.g., Musick, 1996).\nSociodemographics.--We controlled for several back-\nground characteristics: sex (0 = male, 1 = female), age (in\nyears), education (years of schooling), and marital status (0\n= not married, 1 = married).\nAnalytical Strategy\nBecause we had two waves of data, we used conditional\nchange analysis (Finkel, 1995). That is, the dependent vari-\nable in the models was the Wave 2 measure of the outcome,\nwhereas the independent variables, including the baseline\nmeasure of the dependent variable, were measured in Wave\n1. Regression coefficients indicated a change in the out-\ncome across waves. Using this method helps to disentangle\ndifficulties with causal ordering.\nWe employed two types of regression analysis given the\nnature of the outcome variables. Because the religious activ-\nity items were measured using an ordinal scale, we used\npolytomous logistic regression, also called ordered logit\nmodeling, to estimate effects. However, the depressive symp-\ntomatology outcomes were measured using an interval scale,\nand as such, we were able to use ordinary least squares re-\ngression to estimate those effects.\nTo make comparisons between the cancer and noncancer\nsubsamples, we computed these analyses for two compari-\nson groups, those with a noncancer chronic illness and\nthose reporting no chronic illness. Using these coefficients,\nwe performed a two-tailed t test (Clogg & Eliason, 1986) to\ndetermine whether there were significant differences in the\neffects of religious activity across the illness groups. A two-\ntailed t test was also used to determine whether there were\ndifferences in effects between the two racial subsamples.\nRESULTS\nAnalysis of Religious Activity\nTable 2 displays the results of the analysis concerning\ncancer and religious activity. Because the omitted category\nin these models is having cancer, a positive coefficient indi-\ncates that respondents in the cancer group engage in less re-\nligious activity than the relevant comparison group. Note\nalso that these estimates are adjusted for sex, age, education,\nmarital status, and functional ability. For the Wave 1 reli-\ngious activity outcomes, there is no difference in levels of\nreligious activity between the cancer and noncancer groups\nfor either race. However, estimates for the second in-person\nwave outcomes are somewhat different. Among Blacks, re-\nspondents with cancer are more likely to report an increase\nin religious devotion than both the other illness and no ill-\nness groups; however, this difference is only significant for\nthe other illness group. In terms of religious media, Blacks\nwith cancer are also more likely to report an increase in ac-\ntivity. In contrast, Blacks with cancer are less likely to report\nincreases in service attendance compared to the other illness\nor no illness groups. This overall pattern for the White sub-\nsample is similar; however, significant differences between\nillness groups occur only for changes in religious media.\nComparing effects between races, we find significant dif-\nferences. First, Blacks and Whites differ in the effect of\ncancer versus other illness on religious devotion in the\npanel analyses (t = 2.79, p < .01). Second, in the panel anal-\nyses on service attendance, the effect of cancer versus other\nillness and no illness differs between Blacks and Whites\n.001). In all three situations, the results support our expec-\ntations. The relationship between religious activity and can-\ncer is stronger for Blacks than for Whites.\nTable 3 shows the results of the analyses linking reli-\ngious activity to depressive symptomatology among re-\nspondents with cancer. For each group of depressive symp-\ntoms the table lists two columns. The first shows the\ncoefficient for the correlation between that religious activity\nand the second wave symptom group, and the second dis-\nplays the religious activity regression coefficients for two\nregression models. The first model includes all of the reli-\ngious activity measures as well as the first wave outcome.\nThe second model includes the aforementioned variables\nplus other controls, thereby providing the most rigorous test\nof the hypothesis.\nIn the Black subsample, only service attendance has ben-\neficial effects on depressive symptomatology such that re-\nspondents who attend more often report fewer somatic-\nretarded symptoms, less depressed affect, and more positive\naffect. However, service attendance is significantly related\nto symptomatology outcomes in the most rigorous test (full\nmultivariate regression model) only for positive affect.\nIn contrast to Blacks, Whites show no pattern of associa-\ntion between religious activity and depressive symptoma-\ntology. To determine whether the observed difference in ef-\nfects for service attendance between Whites and Blacks is\nsignificant, we performed a t test on the differences in coef-\nficients. The results of these calculations indicate that only\nthe service attendance coefficients for positive affect are\nThe final part of our analysis focuses on whether the ef-\nfects we find for religious activity among respondents with\ncancer are unique to that group. Due to the small number of\nsignificant findings in this portion of the analysis, we did\nnot display these results in tabular form; they are, however,\navailable in that form upon request from the authors. The\nanalyses show that in the African American subsample, the\nTable 2.

In so doing, we have at-\ntempted to answer four questions concerning this relation-\nship. This section is devoted to discussing each of these\nquestions in the context of our findings. We conclude the\nsection by discussing some implications for future research.\nFirst, did respondents with cancer report higher levels of\nreligious activity than respondents without cancer? Al-\nthough we found no significant differences in the cross-\nsectional analyses, we found that the cancer and noncancer\ngroups differ in levels of change in religious activity across\nthe waves. In most cases, having cancer predicts greater re-\nligious activity over time compared to having another or no\nillness. Among Blacks, we found that having cancer pre-\ndicts less service attendance over time compared to the\nother illness groups.\nThe second question we examined was whether religious\nactivity decreased depressive symptomatology among re-\nspondents with cancer. We found such an effect only for\nservice attendance among Blacks; more frequent service at-\ntendance is related to higher levels of positive affect. Ser-\nvice attendance is also related to lower levels of depressed\naffect among Blacks, but this result is not significant in the\nfinal model.\nEarlier research on religion and cancer has tended to fo-\ncus on the importance of private religious activity. This\nfocus was sometimes a necessity given that samples were\ninstitutionalized and could not easily participate in public\nreligious activities. However, their findings coincide with\nours because they found that visits by clergy and interces-\nsory prayer (e.g., Johnson & Spilka, 1991) were important\nto maintaining hope and optimism. As we mentioned previ-\nously, one possible mechanism underlying our findings and\nthose of others has been referred to as \"social cohesive-\nness\" (Idler, 1987). According to this perspective, religion\nbest helps individuals by providing access to others who\nmay provide support, both instrumental and emotional, in\ntimes of need. For terminally ill patients, such support\nwould necessarily come through visits by clergy and other\nparishioners. However, for persons with cancer in the com-\nmunity, such interaction may be more dependent upon indi-\nviduals' active participation in the religious group.\nWe also addressed the question of whether the relation-\nship between religion and depression is unique to the can-\ncer group. Because earlier researchers relied on samples of\ncancer patients, they were unable to determine whether the\neffects they observed were limited to those patients or\nwhether they were true of others as well. Interestingly, we\nfound that the positive effects of service attendance among\nBlacks is unique to the cancer group. Moreover, the analy-\nses showed that having another chronic illness does not\ntend to moderate the effect of religious activity on depres-\nsive symptomatology. Cancer may be associated with a\nunique set of circumstances, in terms of uncontrollability,\nstress, discomfort, and uncertainty, such that public reli-\ngious activity will have its greatest effects for those with\nthe disease.\nFinally, the fact that the effect of service attendance is\nstronger among Blacks should not be surprising given ear-\nlier research on religion and life satisfaction that showed\nsimilar trends (St. George & McNamara, 1984; Thomas &\nHolmes, 1992). Other studies that focused solely on African\nAmericans have shown similarly strong results for that\ngroup (Levin, Chatters, & Taylor, 1995). The \"support\nbank\" concept (Antonucci, 1985) may be partially responsi-\nble for our finding that the effects of service attendance on\npositive affect are strongest among Blacks. That is, the\nstrong historical and contemporary presence of the Black\nchurch may instill in parishioners the idea that if they do\nthe work of the church while able (e.g., attend services,\nvisit and help those in need), the church will respond when\nthey are in need. Taylor and Chatters (1988) found that the\nchurch is an important source of informal support for many\nAfrican Americans. For elderly southern Blacks, the church\nmay be one of few resources mat they can expect help from\nwhen their need is greatest. For those cancer patients facing\nconsiderable uncertainty regarding the disease, such an ex-\npectation may be very beneficial.\nLimitations\nGiven the previous evidence on the ties between mental\nwell-being and religion, it is interesting that we do not find\nstronger effects in this study. This lack of findings may be\ndue to the limitations of our data. First, as we have indi-\ncated, earlier studies of this sort focused on very ill popula-\ntions. In many cases the sample consisted of terminal can-\ncer patients, and as such, the investigators were certain\nabout what stage of the disease they were covering. In con-\ntrast, our measures of cancer do not distinguish those who\nare terminal from those who are in remission or currently in\ntherapy. Therefore, to some degree, our cancer group may\nbe too heterogeneous to find all the anticipated effects.\nSecond, a lack of religious heterogeneity in our sample\nmay affect the expected relationships. As we have noted,\nour data were drawn from a sample of elderly adults living\nin the southeastern portion of the United States. That region\nof the country is largely Protestant and has high overall lev-\nels of religious activity (Roof & McKinney, 1987), espe-\ncially among Blacks (Ellison & Sherkat, 1995). This lack\nof variation in the measures of religious activity might have\nattenuated our findings.\nImplications\nGiven our findings and the limitations of our data, what\nare the possible avenues for future research? First, future\nresearch should address religious activity, cancer, and men-\ntal health using a different, more religiously heterogeneous\nsample. The sample should be community-based and longi-\ntudinal in nature to improve upon our knowledge of these\nprocesses as they occur outside of institutional settings.\nSuch research should also be attuned to the fine-grained na-\nture of religious activity; that is, measures of public and\nprivate religious activity should be much more specific. For\ninstance, if future studies wished to explore the possibility\nof a support bank located in the church, then measures\nshould include whether the respondent visits others in need\nor volunteers for church group activities. In contrast, if the\nresearcher expects that public religious activity will be im-\nportant because members in need receive support from\nother congregants, then help received specifically from\nchurch members should be measured.\nMoreover, future measures of religion should also try to\ntap thefunction of religious activity for individuals. That is,\nnot only should researchers try to measure what people do\nwith regard to religion, but also what purpose that serves in\ntheir lives. In their work on social support in the church,\nTaylor and Chatters (1986) have indicated what types of\nsupport are received from church members. Other studies\nspecific role of the pastor and church group in the mainte-\nnance of individual well-being. We have noted also that re-\nligion can provide hope or freedom from death anxiety for\nthose with severe illness (Koenig, 1994). Future studies\nshould determine whether indeed the hope, optimism, or\nfreedom from worry that is provided by religious teachings\nor fellowship with other church members mediate any asso-\nciations we find between religion and well-being.\nThird, future research should begin to take into account\nthe moderating effect of stress and other social factors on\nthe relationship between religion and mental health. If can-\ncer can be perceived of as a stress (net of its physical ef-\nfects), then we have shown that a significant stressor can\nsubstantially moderate the effect of religious activity on de-\npressive symptomatology. Indeed, if religion's true effect is\nto provide comfort, either in terms of support or beliefs,\nthen we should expect that religion will be most powerful\nfor those in stressful circumstances (Glock, Ringer, and\nBabbie, 1967). Several authors have provided evidence to\nby splitting the sample by race and finding significant ef-\nfects mostly for Blacks, we have underscored the impor-\ntance of in the relationship between religion and health.\nOther social contexts, like socioeconomic status and gen-\nder, could affect this relationship in similar ways and\nshould be addressed in future research.\n"
