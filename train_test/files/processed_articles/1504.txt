Criteria for consideration of metformin included the presence of both impaired\nfasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), with 1 additional diabetes risk\nfactor: age 60 years, BMI 35 kg/m2, family history of diabetes, elevated triglycerides, reduced\nHDL cholesterol, hypertension, or A1C 6.0%.\nRESULTS -- Isolated IFG, isolated IGT, and IFG and IGT were found in 18.0, 7.2, and 8.2%\nsubjects, respectively. In SIGT, NHANES III, and NHANES 2005\u00ad2006, criteria for metformin\nrespectively.\nCONCLUSIONS -- More than 96% of individuals with both IFG and IGT are likely to meet\nADA consensus criteria for consideration of metformin. Because 28% of all those with IFG met\nthe criteria, providers should perform oral glucose tolerance tests to find concomitant IGT in all\npatients with IFG. To the extent that our findings are representative of the U.S. population, 1\nin 12 adults has a combination of pre-diabetes and risk factors that may justify consideration of\nmetformin treatment for diabetes prevention.\nDiabetes is a public health epidemic\n(1) associated with high morbidity,\nmortality (1), and cost (2). Cur-\nrently, an estimated 38 million Americans\nhave the disease, nearly 40% of which is\nundiagnosed, and another 87 million\nhave pre-diabetes: impaired fasting glu-\ncose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose toler-\nance (IGT) (3). Diabetes develops\ninsidiously over several years, during\nwhich time glucose metabolism\nprogresses slowly from normal to pre-\ndiabetes and then more rapidly to diabetes.\nBased on observational and prospective\nstudies, 25\u00ad40% of individuals with pre-\ndiabetes go on to develop diabetes over 3\u00ad8\nyears (4\u00ad6), and there is evidence of com-\nplications in 50% of patients at the time of\ndiagnosis of diabetes (7).\nBecause progression from pre-\ndiabetes can be prevented or delayed by\nlifestyle change and/or medication (4\u00ad6),\nthe American Diabetes Association (ADA)\nhas issued a consensus statement recom-\nmending early identification and preven-\ntive treatment in high-risk individuals\n(8). The panel statement recommends\nthat individuals with both IFG and IGT\nand one additional risk factor (age 60\nyears, BMI 35 kg/m2, family history of\ndiabetes in first-degree relative, elevated\ntriglycerides, reduced HDL cholesterol,\nor A1C 6.0%) should be considered for\ntreatment with metformin, in addition to\nlifestyle modification, which includes\nweight loss and physical activity.\nTo determine what proportion of the\nAmerican population presenting with ei-\nther IFG or IGT would merit consider-\nation for metformin treatment in\naccordance with the recent ADA recom-\nmendations, we evaluated healthy volun-\nteers without known diabetes who were\nscreened for diabetes/pre-diabetes by the\n75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).\nMETHODS -- In cross-sectional\nanalyses, we evaluated the likelihood\nthat Americans with previously unrec-\nognized pre-diabetes would meet ADA\nconsensus panel recommendations for\nconsideration of metformin in addition\nto change in lifestyle. Criteria for con-\nsideration of metformin included the\npresence of both IFG and IGT, with 1\nadditional diabetes risk factor: age 60\nyears, BMI 35 kg/m2, family history of\ndiabetes, elevated triglycerides, re-\nduced HDL cholesterol, hypertension,\nparticipate in the Screening for Impaired\nGlucose Tolerance (SIGT) study (9), a\ncross-sectional study that was approved\n                                                \nFrom the 1Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Lipids, Emory University\nSchool of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia; the 2Nutrition and Health Sciences Program, Graduate Division of\nBiological and Biomedical Sciences, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia; the 3Department of Medicine,\nDivision of Cardiology, Emory Program in Cardiovascular Outcomes Research and Epidemiology, At-\nlanta, Georgia; the 4Christiana Care Health System, Newark, Delaware; the 5Hubert Department of Global\nHealth, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia; the 6Department of Medi-\ncine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia; and the 7Atlanta VA Medical Center,\nDecatur, Georgia.\nCorresponding author: Mary K.

Dur-\nexpressed initial interest in the study,\nfirst visits (selected largely on the basis of\nneed to balance participant sex and race),\ncompleted the protocol. All study visits\nwere performed in the General Clinical\nResearch Centers at Emory University\nHospital and Grady Memorial Hospital.\nAll subjects gave written informed con-\nsent before study participation.\nWe also evaluated subjects who took\npart in the Third National Health and Nu-\ntrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)\n(10) and the continuous National Health\nNHANES is a program of studies con-\nducted by the National Center for Health\nStatistics of the Centers for Disease Con-\ntrol and Prevention that include both in-\nterviews and physical examinations in a\nnationally representative sample to assess\nthe health and nutritional status of adults\nand children in the U.S. NHANES III was\neach year, which includes NHANES\nMeasurements in the SIGT study\npopulation\nDemographic information was collected\nby self-report and included family history\nof diabetes in a first-degree relative, race,\nhistory of hypertension, history of diabe-\ntes, and current medication use. Height\nwas measured with a stadiometer after\nshoes were removed. Weight was mea-\nsured using digital scales with subjects in\nlight clothing. Blood pressure was mea-\nsured with digital manometers after sub-\njects had been seated quietly for 5 min.\nClassification of glucose tolerance\nwas determined by a 75-g OGTT in accor-\ndance with ADA diagnostic criteria (12):\nnormal glucose tolerance (NGT)--fasting\nplasma glucose (FPG) 100 mg/dl and\npostchallenge glucose 199 mg/dl; any\nmg/dl and 2-h postchallenge glucose\n200 mg/dl. Isolated IFG was further\nsubcategorized into fasting glucose be-\nbegun before 11:00 A.M. after an overnight\nfast, with blood samples drawn at base-\nline, 1 h, and 2 h. Blood samples were also\nobtained for measurement of plasma lip-\nids and A1C. Plasma glucose samples\nwere obtained using sodium fluoride/\noxalate preservative. Plasma samples\nwere centrifuged, separated, and frozen\nwithin 30 min. All samples were stored at\n80\u00b0C until assayed. Chemical analyses\nwere performed in the central clinical lab-\noratory of the Grady Health System using\nan LX-20 analyzer (Beckman Coulter,\nBrea, CA); A1C measurement with this\nsystem is National Glycohemoglobin\nStandardization Program-certified.\nStatistical analysis\nIn the NHANES III database, a subset of\nadults aged 40 years had an OGTT per-\nformed. We analyzed only those who had\nno known history of diabetes, had com-\npleted the OGTT in the morning before\n11:00 A.M. after an overnight fast of at least\n9 h, for whom the 2-h postchallenge glu-\ncose level was measured between 100 and\n135 min after ingestion of the glucose\nload, and had a survey weight value 0.\ncluded only those who were non-\nHispanic black or white (to match our\ntion, all subjects 12 years who were\nseen in the morning session were asked to\nhave an OGTT performed.

To determine the propor-\ntion of individuals who would be targeted\nby such a recommendation, we examined\na relatively healthy population without\npreviously diagnosed diabetes (SIGT) and\nrepresentative samples of the U.S. popu-\n2006) and found that one-quarter to one-\nthird had pre-diabetes. Among those with\nIFG, nearly one-third of subjects met the\ncriteria for consideration of metformin\ntreatment to prevent diabetes in accor-\ndance with the recent ADA consensus\nstatement, more than one-half of all of the\nsubjects with IGT qualified, and almost all\nof those with both IFG and IGT qualified.\nOverall, 8\u00ad9% met the recommended cri-\nteria. Assuming that our data are general-\nizable to the U.S. population, 24\nmillion Americans might benefit from\npharmacological treatment in addition to\nlifestyle modification.\nThe epidemic of diabetes and the in-\nsidious onset of its complications have\nprompted a call for early identification\nand preventive treatment of the disease.\nDiabetes is currently the leading cause of\nblindness, end-stage renal disease requir-\ning dialysis, and nontraumatic amputa-\ntions in the U.S. and increases the risk for\ncardiovascular disease and stroke by two-\nto fourfold, compared with those without\ndiabetes (1). It is the seventh leading\nbillion in both direct and indirect health\ncare expenditures (2). In addition, the\nprevalence of diabetes has been on the rise\nin the adolescent population (13), indi-\ncating that the epidemic is likely to con-\ntinue into the next generation.\nPre-diabetes, the stage preceding the\ndevelopment of diabetes, increases the\nrisk for the development of diabetes, such\ngo on to develop diabetes over a period of\ndiabetes alone has been associated with\nan increased risk for the development of\ncardiovascular disease (16,17) and micro-\nvascular complications typically seen\nwith diabetes (18). Given these risks, pro-\nspective studies have been conducted to\nidentify preventive treatment. In addition\nto lifestyle modification, pharmacological\ntreatment with acarbose (5), rosiglitazone\n(6), orlistat (19), or metformin (4) has\nshown efficacy in preventing or delaying\nthe onset of diabetes in individuals with\npre-diabetes. The relative risk reduction\nfor diabetes in the pre-diabetic popula-\nHowever, because many individuals with\npre-diabetes are generally healthy, the\nbenefit of preventive treatment must out-\nweigh any associated side effects or addi-\ntional risks, particularly because none of\nthese medications have U.S. Food and\nDrug Administration approval for the in-\ndication of diabetes prevention. Gastroin-\ntestinal side effects are commonly\nassociated with acarbose (5) and orlistat\n(19), leading to poor patient compliance,\nwhereas an increased risk of bone loss\nFigure 1--Prevalence of metformin indication, stratified by glucose tolerance category.

Risk factors for diabetes that were not specifically defined by the ADA were\ncategorized according to the AHA/NHLBI diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome (12): presence of hypertension by history, systolic blood\npressure 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure 85 mmHg, triglyceride level 150 mg/dl, and HDL cholesterol 40 mg/dl in men and 50 mg/dl\npostchallenge plasma glucose 140 mg/dl); IGT, isolated IGT; and IFG 100\u00ad125  IGT, all IFG and IGT.\nMetformin indicated in many pre-diabetic patients\n(20), worsening or new-onset edema\n(21), and heart failure (22) are associated\nwith rosiglitazone. Therefore, metformin,\nwhich has been used for many years and is\nboth generally well tolerated and rela-\ntively safe, has become the leading candi-\ndate for preventive treatment.\nIn addition to the recommendations\nof the ADA, the American College of En-\ndocrinology (ACE) has recently issued\ntheir consensus statement on the manage-\nment of pre-diabetes (23). Similar to the\nADA recommendations, the ACE state-\nment recognizes the need for preventive\ntreatment, beginning with lifestyle modi-\nfication, but also emphasizes the impor-\ntance of treating relevant comorbid\nconditions, such as hypertension, hyper-\ncholesterolemia, and obesity, and pro-\nvides a looser set of criteria regarding the\ninitiation of pharmacological treatment.\nAcarbose and metformin are their recom-\nmended treatments for individuals who\nare at high risk of developing diabetes,\nwhich include, but are not limited to,\nthose with IFG, IGT, and/or the metabolic\nsyndrome, worsening glycemia, cardio-\nvascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver\ndisease, a history of gestational diabetes,\nor polycystic ovary syndrome. Taking\ninto account the target populations as de-\nfined by the ADA and the ACE, 8% of\nAmericans could benefit from pharmaco-\nlogical treatment to prevent or delay de-\nvelopment of diabetes.\nUse of pharmacological agents for the\nmany Americans who may benefit from\npreventive treatment would incur sub-\nstantial costs: at current generic rates for\nmetformin, possibly $4/month  12\nbillion per year. However, several studies\nsuggest that diabetes prevention or delay\nwith metformin is likely to be cost-\neffective and/or cost-saving (24); further\nevaluation using a variety of cost analysis\nmethods may be required to reach a de-\nfinitive conclusion regarding the cost of\npreventive treatment.\nTo our knowledge, our findings are\nthe first evaluation of the proportion of\nrelatively healthy individuals who might\nbenefit from metformin treatment for the\nprevention or delay of development of di-\nabetes. However, our study has limita-\ntions. Because all SIGT subjects were\nrecruited on a volunteer basis, there may\nhave been a selection bias toward higher\nfamily history of diabetes and/or other\nrisk factors for diabetes. Therefore, the\nSIGT population may represent a group\nof individuals at higher risk. However, be-\ncause many SIGT subjects were recruited\nfrom university and health care settings,\nthey may also follow healthier lifestyles,\nwhich could offset such a bias. Moreover,\nthe proportion with diabetes or pre-\ndiabetes in SIGT was no higher than that\nin NHANES III and was comparable to\nized, stratified samples of the American\npopulation.\nThe morbidity, mortality, and cost of\nthe epidemic of diabetes have prompted a\ncall for primary prevention of diabetes in\nhigh-risk individuals by the use of met-\nformin in addition to lifestyle changes. To\nthe extent that our findings are represen-\ntative of the U.S. population, close to 1 in\n12 American adults may meet the recom-\nmended guidelines for consideration of\nmetformin treatment for diabetes preven-\ntion or delay. Notably, eligibility for met-\nformin use appeared to be almost\ncompletely determined by impaired glu-\ncose metabolism alone, because 99% of\nthe SIGT population and 96% of the\nNHANES populations with both IFG and\nIGT had at least one risk factor. Therefore,\nonce the presence of both IFG and IGT\nhas been established, the presence of ad-\nditional risk factors could almost be as-\nsumed, and initiation of metformin\nshould be considered. Moreover, because\nnearly one-third of all subjects with IFG\nmet the criteria for metformin treatment,\nproviders should perform OGTTs in all\npatients with IFG to test for the presence\nof IGT (or unrecognized diabetes) and\nthereby determine whether they merit\nconsideration of metformin treatment.\n"
