Since a man cannot be sure he is the father of his\nmate's children, he would be more upset by a mate's sexual infidelity than a woman\nwould because women are always sure the child she is bearing is her own. In\ncontrast, a woman who can benefit from a mate's contribution to child rearing, would\nbe more upset by a mate's emotional infidelity (and the risk of economic\nabandonment it might presage) than a man. (Buss, Larsen, Westen and Semmelroth,\nThe Effect of Vividness of Experience on Sex Differences in Jealousy\n1982; Wiederman and Allgeier, 1993). It is important to note that this evolutionary\nperspective predicts that men, relative to women, will be more upset by sexual\ninfidelity, and women, relative to men, will be more upset by emotional infidelity.\nThis perspective does not assume a rank ordered difference within the sex. It is not\nthat women are more upset by emotional infidelity than by sexual infidelity. The\ndifferences are between sexes, not within, which has been a common misconception\nin the literature on sex differences in jealousy. This sex difference has been robustly\ndemonstrated, not only in the United States, (Buss et al., 1992; Buunk et al., 1996;\nDeSteno and Salovey, 1996; Harris and Christenfeld, 1996) but also in some Asian\nand European countries (Buunk et al., 1996; Geary, Rumsey, Bow-Thomas and\nconclusion that sexual differences in the eliciting factors and/or responses are a\nhuman universal.\nRecently some researchers have called into question the validity of this\nconclusion. Harris (2002) suggests that the evidence supporting this conclusion is\nweak because of limitations imposed by the methods by which the putative sex\ndifference was demonstrated. The classic method for demonstrating these differences\nis a forced choice method in which subjects are asked to say which of two jealousy\nexperiences they would find most upsetting. Among her most potent criticisms is that\nalmost all research concerning this issue has used imagined infidelity as a substitute\nfor the experience of actual infidelity, leaving open the possibility that the effect only\noccurs when people imagine infidelity, and not when it actually happens. If Harris is\ncorrect, then imagined and remembered infidelity should provoke very different\nreactions from subjects.\nHarris (2002) reported that when people described their reactions to real life\ninfidelity, the classic sex differences disappeared. However, variations in methods\nmay have been responsible for the lack of sex differences. Harris used the classic\nforced choice question for participants who had only imagined infidelity, in which\nshe asked participants to chose whether emotional or sexual infidelity would be more\nupsetting. She found, like many others, that when forced to choose between\nimagined types of infidelity, more men than women chose sexual infidelity as more\nupsetting, and more women than men chose emotional infidelity. However, to\nparticipants who had experienced actual infidelity she posed an entirely different\nquestion: \"To what degree did you focus on the emotional aspects of your partner's\ninfidelity\" and \"To what degree did you focus on the sexual aspects of your partner's\ninfidelity (Harris, 2002, 9).\" Obviously, what the participant focuses on is very\ndifferent from what upsets the participant. Harris confounded these instructions by\nnot using the same phrase consistently in the study, as well as not using the same\nphrase as in previous literature. In addition, Harris did not ask participants which type\nof infidelity they had experienced, and if most of these participants had experienced\nonly sexual infidelity, it would explain why they answered that they focused on the\nsexual aspects of the infidelity. In this study, Harris was comparing what men and\nwomen who have experienced infidelity focus on to what upsets participants who\nThe Effect of Vividness of Experience on Sex Differences in Jealousy\nhave imagined infidelity, rather than comparing which kind of infidelity was more\ndistressing to the two groups. To test the latter question more directly, our first study\nattempts to assess directly whether having experienced real infidelity versus\nimagining infidelity makes a difference by asking participants who have and have not\nexperienced infidelity which kind of infidelity upsets them the most.\nStudy 1: Real versus imagined infidelity\nThis study was designed to test Harris' (2002) suggestion that while people\nwho are imagining infidelity would show the usual sex differences, (men will be\nmore upset by sexual infidelity than women and women will be most upset by\nemotional infidelity than men), these differences would not be reported by people\nreporting on their own experiences of real life infidelity.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants included ninety-seven undergraduate students at Clark University.\nFifty-three participants were male and forty-four were female, their ages ranged from\nseventeen to twenty-two.\nProcedure\nAfter participants signed a consent form, they were randomly assigned to read\none of two counter-balanced descriptions of jealousy-provoking situations. The first\nsituation was a description of emotional infidelity, asking the participants if they had\never been in a romantic relationship in which the person they were dating was\nbeginning to fall in love with someone else, but definitely not having sexual relations.\nThe second situation was a description of sexual infidelity, asking the participants if\nthey had ever dated someone who was having sex with someone else, but definitely\nnot forming an emotional attachment. If the participants reported having had either\nexperience, they were asked to recall the situations as best they could. If they said\nthey had not, they were asked to imagine such a scenario, again to the best of their\nability.\nAfter reading the first jealousy description, participants were asked to rate\ntheir feelings about the infidelity on a questionnaire that consisted of seven 30-point\nscales labeled with one of seven emotions: anger, fear, sadness, anxiety, rage,\nbetrayal, and vindictiveness. One end of the linear scale was labeled \"Don't feel at\nall\" and the other was labeled \"Feel very strongly.\" After completing the emotion\nratings for the first type of infidelity, they read the description of the other type, and\nagain described their feelings on the ratings scales. When the second task was\ncompleted, the last question of the questionnaire, derived from the traditional forced-\nThe Effect of Vividness of Experience on Sex Differences in Jealousy\nchoice methodology, asked the participants to choose which type of infidelity, i.e.\nemotional or sexual, would upset them most.\nResults\nForced Choice\nTwenty-six of the ninety-seven participants reported that they had experienced\ninfidelity, whether emotional or sexual in nature. Women and men were equally\nlikely to report having experienced infidelity (fourteen of fifty-three men, twelve of\nforty-four women).\nRegardless of experience with infidelity, the classic forced choice result\nemerged with thirty-two of fifty-three men saying that sexual infidelity would be\nworse, and twenty-nine of forty-four women saying that sexual infidelity was worse.\nmen women\ngender\nPercent\ncheattype\nlove worse\nsex worse\nThe Effect of Vividness of Experience on Sex Differences in Jealousy\nThe same analysis was repeated on the two groups (experienced infidelity and\nimagined infidelity) separately. Contrary to Harris' results, participants who had\nexperienced infidelity did show the anticipated sex differences in their responses\n(2=9.758, df=1, p<.01). Eighty-six percent of men said that sexual infidelity would\nbe worse, while seventy-five percent of women said that emotional infidelity would\nbe worse (see Figure 2 below). In marked contrast, those who had not experienced\npercent of men said that sexual infidelity would be worse, and only sixty-three\npercent of thirty-two women said that emotional infidelity would be worse.\nmen women\ngender\nPercent\ncheattype\nlove worse\nsex worse\nIn sum, for the forced choice question, the sample as a whole produced the\nusual sex differences in which kind of infidelity was judged worse, but these\ndifferences seem to be accounted for almost entirely by the portion of the sample who\nreported they had actually experienced infidelity. Results from the study done by\nBuss et al. (1992) also support these findings. Buss et al. found that men who had\nexperienced a committed relationship were much more upset than sexual than\nThe Effect of Vividness of Experience on Sex Differences in Jealousy\nemotional fidelity (55%) while for men who had not experienced a committed\nrelationship only 29% of men were more upset by emotional infidelity.\nEmotion Rating Scales\nAlthough we did not find and difference between sexes for the emotion rating\nscales, we did find within sex differences in whether emotional or sexual infidelity\naffected them emotionally. For the ratings of all the emotions except anxiety, there\nwere significant main effects of type of infidelity. Both men and women reported\nin response to sexual infidelity compared to emotional infidelity. Both sexes reported\nmore fear and sadness at emotional infidelity than sexual infidelity (F=13.16, df=1,\n96, p=.001) In addition, as noted, there were no significant differences between men\nand women in these reactions. Also, in none of these analyses was there any main\neffect or interaction for whether participants had experienced infidelity or not.\nOverall, the results for the forced choice question were consistent with past\nresearch, and suggested that people who had experienced infidelity were especially\nlikely to demonstrate sex differences in which kind of infidelity they found most\nupsetting. However, the rating scale responses that immediately preceded the forced\nchoice question did not reveal any sex differences.\nDiscussion\nThis study generated two apparently inconsistent sets of results for the\nemotion rating scales and for the forced choice question. Although we did not find\nany sex differences in the rating scale results, when men and women reported their\nfeelings after either sexual or emotional infidelity, both sexes reported more intense\nRage, Anger, Betrayal, and Vengefulness in response to sexual infidelity and more\nSadness and Fear in response to emotional infidelity. These differences seem\nreasonable, but do not, of course, replicate earlier studies in which sex differences in\nresponses occurred (e.g. Pietrzak et al, 2002), and did not reveal any differences\nbetween people who had or had not had actual experiences of infidelity. Apparently,\nregardless of sex or previous experience of infidelity, all participants felt that sexual\ninfidelity was an occasion for angry emotions, and emotional infidelity for longer\nterm, more wistful emotions.\nThese results are not consistent with those of Harris, 2002. Harris reported\nthat participants who had experienced infidelity in the past, focused on the emotional\naspects rather than the sexual aspects of infidelity. In addition, the rating scale results\nin this study were not consistent with our own earlier results (Pietrzak et al, 2002) in\nwhich sex differences in rating scales were observed and the results of Shackelford.\nLeBlanc, and Drass (2000) who also found significant sex differences using emotion\nrating scales. These inconsistent results require some further exploration.\nThe Effect of Vividness of Experience on Sex Differences in Jealousy\nThe results of the forced choice questions are inconsistent with Harris' earlier\nresults, probably because our forced choice questions assessed what situations would\nmake people more distressed, not what aspects of infidelity men and women focus on.\nOur forced choice results demonstrated that men and women were differently affected\nby emotional and sexual infidelity, and that these differences were more pronounced\namong people who say they have experienced infidelity. In fact, in our sample,\npeople who had not had such an experience showed only a slight and entirely non-\nsignificant tendency toward the classic sex differences. We cannot assume, of course,\nthat the sex differences found in previous studies were provided only by the portion\nof those samples who had direct experience of infidelity, but it is certainly a\npossibility. Similarly, earlier failures to find sex differences may have occurred\nbecause too few of the sample members had direct experience.\nWhy might those who had experienced infidelity show stronger results? One\npossibility is that the remembered experience is more vivid and engaging than the\nhypothetical examples that the inexperienced must conjure up. This possibility is\nbolstered by the fact that in our earlier study where robust sex differences were found,\nthe participants were required to go through a fairly elaborate reliving or imagining\nprocedure, whereas we observed during Study 1 that some participants seemed to\nrespond rather casually to the questionnaires. Study 2 explored directly the effect of\nthe vividness of the participants' experience.\nStudy 2: Vivid imagination\nHaving found in Study 1 that participants who had experienced infidelity were\nmore likely to show the expected sex differences, in Study 2 we attempted to induce a\nmore realistic experience of infidelity while the participants filled out their\nquestionnaires. A previous study done by our lab, (Pietrzak, Laird, Stevens, and\nThompson, 2002) found strong results by evoking vivid, imagined jealousy in\nparticipants. These results highlight the possibility that participants (usually college\nstudents filling out surveys) may not show expected results because the methods used\ndo not trigger the simulation need to evoke the evolved mechanism. Since\nparticipants are usually recruited in dining halls and student centers, it may be that\nparticipants are not truly imagining the infidelity scenario, but may in fact be rushing\nthrough the questionnaire. There is a possibility that the mechanism is triggered\nwhen the participant vividly recalls or imagines the experience, which may be a\ncloser representation of a real infidelity experience.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants included ninety-three undergraduate students at Clark University.\nForty-seven participants were female and forty-six were male. The ages ranged from\nThe Effect of Vividness of Experience on Sex Differences in Jealousy\nseventeen to twenty-two.\nProcedure\nAfter participants had consented to participate, researchers randomly assigned\nhalf of the participants to one of two counter-balanced conditions. The participants in\nthe \"Usual\" condition received the questionnaires to fill out independently, in a quiet\nroom. The participants in the \"Vivid\" condition received the same questionnaires but\nfirst listened to instructions designed to encourage them to experience the scenarios\nas powerfully as possible.\nThe instructions for participants in the vivid condition were as follows. (The\norder of infidelity type was counter-balanced) \"Close your eyes and try to visualize\nwhat I am going to say to you. Let the characters- you, your partner, and your\npartner's new partner- come to life. Now I want you to first visualize every positive\ncharacteristic about your partner...take some time with that and really try to bring\nthem to life in your mind. Tell me when you have thought about your partner in\ndepth. Now imagine or remember your partner slowly drifting away to another\nromantic partner. Please actually visualize your partner falling in love (without\nsexual relations) with another person, picture them spending time together, talking,\nsharing secrets and becoming close to one another.\"\nThen the participant heard the second instructions: \"Close your eyes and try to\nvisualize what I am going to say to you. Let the characters- you, your partner, and\nyour partner's new partner- come to life. Now I want you to visualize your partner in\na sexually appealing way to you. Take some time to think of your sexual and\nromantic closeness with this attractive person. Imagine or recall your last sexual\nencounter with your partner. Tell me when you have imagined or recalled this. Now\nimagine or remember finding out that your sexual partner was now sexually active\nwith someone other than you. Please visualize your partner and that person naked in\na bed together engaging in sexual activity. Now please turn the page, fill out the\nquestions, and write any other comments/feelings that you may have.\nAlthough participants were asked to visualize characteristics of their partner\nas well as the infidelity, we do not believe this confounded the results of the study. In\norder for the participants to visualize an accurate occurrence of infidelity we felt it\nimportant for the participant to first visualize their partner including their attributes.\nThe questionnaires used were the same as in Study 1.\nResults\nAs in Study 1 participants reported whether they had experienced either\nsexual or emotional infidelity of a partner. Twenty-three of the men and eleven of the\nwomen reported experiencing infidelity.\nAnalyses examined the effect of the vivid and usual conditions on the\nassociation between sex and forced choice response. First, the usual sex difference\nThe Effect of Vividness of Experience on Sex Differences in Jealousy\nwas observed for the sample as a whole, with sixty-eight percent men choosing\nsexual infidelity as more upsetting, and sixty-three percent of women choosing\nwere analyzed separately, as expected, the vivid imagination condition did produce\nmuch more powerful results. In the vivid condition, again, sixty-eight percent of men\nchose sexual infidelity as most upsetting, while ninety-eight percent of women chose\nemotional (2\nimagination\npercent of men chose sexual, but only sixty percent of women chose emotional\ninfidelity, and the difference was not statistically reliable,(2\nno imagination\n.076). These results are comparable to those in Study 1, in that overall, women were\nmore upset than men by emotional infidelity and men were more upset about sexual\ninfidelity than women. However, the bulk of that effect seems to occur in the vivid\ncondition. One question that these results raise is why women are more likely to be\naffected by the vivid imagination that men. In the study done by DeSteno et al. the\nresults show that women were more affected by the cognitive load condition than\nmen. These results seem to suggest that women need to visualize the jealousy\nsimulation in more detail than men for the emotional response to occur. Further\nstudies could look at the detail of visualization needed for men and women to become\nupset by the jealousy scenario.\nThe next set of analyses examined the rating scale responses, within the vivid\nand usual conditions. The initial analyses were three way ANOVAs with sex of\nparticipant and response condition as between participant measures, and emotional\nversus sexual infidelity type as a repeated measures factor. None of the three way\ninteractions with response condition were significant, indicating that the vivid versus\nusual condition differences did not affect the interaction of sex and type of infidelity.\nimagination group than the read only group, suggesting that the vivid condition was\nsuccessful in producing stronger negative feelings. Men and women were equally\naffected by the conditions.\nThe next set of analyses was two-way ANOVAS of the vivid and usual\nconditions separately, comparing men and women's responses to the two kinds of\ninfidelity scenario. The anticipated difference between men and women did not\nemerge, in either condition group, with none of the rating scale results involving a\nsignificant sex of participant by type of scenario interaction. Instead, the pattern for\nmost of the ratings were significant main effects of sex of participant. T-tests\nrevealed that women rated their feelings for Rage Anger, Betrayal, Anxious and\nSadness to be more intense than were men's feelings in the emotional infidelity\np= .000). For the sexual infidelity scenario women also rated their feelings as more\nThe Effect of Vividness of Experience on Sex Differences in Jealousy\nIn sum, for the rating scale analyses we saw main effects, and virtually no\ninteractions. Women reported stronger reactions than did men, and both sexes in\nresponse to both kinds of infidelity reported stronger feelings in the Vivid condition.\nFurther research could focus on the question of why women seem to respond more\nintensely to the emotion rating scales, regardless of infidelity scenario.\nDiscussion\nThese two studies demonstrate that men and women who have experienced\ninfidelity or who have been induced to vividly imagine infidelity showed expected\nsex differences on the forced choice method. It is interesting to note that in both\nstudies the condition that is closest to actual infidelity, i.e., actual infidelity or vivid\nimagination results in the expected effect. The results suggest that it may be the case\nthat the evolved mechanism of differential jealousy is in fact only triggered when in a\nsituation that actually resembles infidelity. If this is the case, these results strengthen\nthe evolutionary hypothesis that men and women differ in which type of infidelity\nelicits jealousy. However, while we theorize that the evolved mechanism is specific\nand only triggered when the situation resembles one in which infidelity was likely to\noccur, other researchers (DeSteno, Bartlett, Braverman, and Salovey, 2002) have\ntheorized that all evolved mechanisms should be automatic and occur under all levels\nof cognitive strain, regardless of the intensity of the experience. However,\nevolutionary psychology does not assume that evolved mechanisms must be\nautomatic. While DeSteno and colleagues (2002) do show that when under cognitive\nload participants do not show expected sex differences, this does not contradict the\nevolutionary theory. In fact, this study does not even test whether jealousy is\nautomatic or not. Their cognitive load condition might well have reduced response\nbecause the participants were insufficiently engaged with the scenario they were\nbeing asked to respond to. It would be very difficult to simultaneously imagine being\ncheated on while remembering a list of digits and typing them on a computer screen.\nDeSteno and colleagues seem to imply that the jealousy instinct can be evoked by\nresponding to questions on a computer screen. DeSteno and colleagues also report\nthat their results show that this classic result is an artifact, however, the reader is\nnever quite sure what it is an artifact of. The main result of the DeSteno et al. study\nwas that both men and women chose sexual infidelity as more upsetting while under\ncognitive load, but the authors never provide an explanation for this result. Perhaps\nfor most people, there are stronger semantic ties between sexual and infidelity than\nemotional and infidelity, however, the authors do not discuss this. In general, the\nstudy by DeSteno et al., does not support any criticisms of the evolutionary account.\nIn addition, the first study also challenges Harris' (2002) suggestion that sex\ndifferences disappear when participants recall actual infidelity. Participants who had\nexperienced emotional infidelity showed the anticipated sex differences in their\nresponses when instructed to choose which type of infidelity was more upsetting.\nDue to the small number of participants who reported having experienced sexual\nThe Effect of Vividness of Experience on Sex Differences in Jealousy\ninfidelity, it was not possible to examine whether this effect was true for victims of\nsexual infidelity as well. Lastly, we did not find expected sex differences using the\nemotion rating scale. This consistent finding has lead us to believe that the emotions\nused on the emotion rating scale are not appropriate to the hypothesis. For instance,\nthe word \"jealousy\" is never used on the emotion rating scale. Future studies should\nfocus on testing the results of emotion rating scales as a measurement of jealousy,\nconsidering that most research in this area has not found results using a continuous\nrating scale. Further research should also focus on replicating actual infidelity\nscenarios in order to provide participants with an experience as close as possible to\nactual infidelity.\n"
