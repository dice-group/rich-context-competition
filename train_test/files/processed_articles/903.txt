The relative risk of hypertension incidence\n(blood pressure  160/95 and/or using antihypertensive medication) by education was calculated for non-\nHispanic Whites (aged 25\u00ad64 years) and non-Hispanic Blacks (aged 25\u00ad44 years) normotensive at baseline\nusing Cox proportional hazards models. The age-adjusted relative risk of hypertension incidence among\npersons with less than 12 years of education compared with those with more than 12 years was significant\namong non-Hispanic Whites aged 25\u00ad44 years (men: relative risk (RR) = 2.14, 95% confidence interval (CI):\n0.63, 2.14). Relative risks for non-Hispanic White men remained stable after adjusting for age, systolic blood\npressure, body mass index, and region of residence; relative risks for non-Hispanic White women were reduced\nbut remained significant. Non-Hispanic White men and women aged 45\u00ad64 years with less than 12 years of\neducation were not at higher risk of developing hypertension compared with their more educated counterparts.\nThese results demonstrate a significant interaction between age and education with an independent association\nbetween education and hypertension incidence among younger but not older non-Hispanic White men and\neducation; hypertension; nutrition surveys; social class\nReceived for publication September 16, 1998, and accepted for\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; NHANES I, First National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey; NHEFS, NHANES I\nEpidemiologic Followup Study; RR, relative risk.\nFrom the Office of Analysis, Epidemiology, and Health Promotion,\nNational Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention, Hyattsville, MD.\nReprint requests to Dr. Clemencia M. Vargas, Office of Analysis,\nEpidemiology, and Health Promotion, National Center for Health\nThis paper was presented during the 4th International\nConference on Preventive Cardiology, June 1997, Montreal,\nCanada.\nCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the\nUnited States (1). The negative association of cardiovascu-\nlar disease morbidity and mortality with socioeconomic sta-\ntus has been demonstrated by several studies (2\u00ad10). These\nstudies have shown that individuals with lower socioeco-\nnomic status, as measured by education and/or occupation,\nare more likely to have cardiovascular disease than are indi-\nviduals with higher socioeconomic status. Even though\nhypertension is one of the main risk factors for cardiovascu-\nlar disease, a review of the literature shows few studies of\nhypertension incidence (11\u00ad15) and even fewer studies of\nthe association between hypertension incidence and educa-\ntion or other indicators of socioeconomic status (16\u00ad20). A\nstudy of Blacks in Charleston, South Carolina, found that\nhypertension incidence was inversely associated with social\nclass as measured by education and occupation (16, 18);\nanother study of inner city Blacks found that hypertension\nincidence was associated with income but not with educa-\ntion or occupation (17). The First National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) Epidemiologic\nFollowup Study (NHEFS) is the only longitudinal nationally\nrepresentative survey of the US population that permits the\nanalysis of hypertension incidence by sociodemographic\ncharacteristics. Waitzman and Smith (20) and Ford and\nCooper (19) used the NHEFS to study the incidence of\nhypertension. Waitzman and Smith (20) analyzed the inci-\ndence of hypertension among men by occupational mobil-\nity; they found that hypertension incidence was higher\namong men who were from lower occupational classes or\nthose who moved to lower occupational classes than among\ntheir counterparts. Ford and Cooper (19) studied the relation\nbetween incidence of hypertension and several sociodemo-\ngraphic, behavioral, and biochemical factors among persons\n25 years of age and over. They found a significant bivariate\nassociation between the incidence of hypertension and edu-\ncational attainment among White men, White women, and\nBlack women. After controlling for diverse covariates, this\nassociation remained significant only among White women.\nHypertension Incidence and Education 273\nIn this study we use data from the NHEFS to extend these\nfindings by exploring how the association of educational\nattainment and incidence of hypertension among men and\nwomen varies with age and other possible effect modifiers.\nStudy population\nwide, multistage, probability sample of the civilian non-\ninstitutionalized US population aged 1\u00ad74 years, excluding\nAlaska, Hawaii, and reservation lands of American Indians.\nDetails of the plan, complex survey design, response rates,\nand operation were published previously (21). The elderly,\nwomen of child-bearing age, and persons living in poverty\nareas were oversampled. Data were collected through per-\nsonal interview, physical examination, and laboratory analy-\nses. The NHEFS is a longitudinal study of participants in the\nNHANES I who were 25\u00ad74 years of age at the time of the\nviews and physical and laboratory examinations of the\nNHANES I provided the baseline data for the NHEFS. This\nanalysis is based on the first wave of follow-up during\nblood pressure measurements.\nThis analysis includes non-Hispanic White persons who\nwere 25\u00ad64 years of age at baseline and non-Hispanic Black\npersons who were 25\u00ad44 years of age. Persons from\nracial/ethnic groups other than non-Hispanic White and\nnon-Hispanic Black were excluded because sample sizes\nwere too small to make separate estimates. Elderly persons\n(65 years of age and over) were not included in the analysis,\nbecause almost half of the elderly persons who were nor-\nand these deaths were concentrated in the lowest education\ngroup. Thus, the inclusion of elderly persons would bias the\nresults toward the null. Finally, non-Hispanic Blacks 45\u00ad64\nyears of age were also excluded because their sample size is\ntoo small to provide reliable estimates.\nyears and non-Hispanic Black persons aged 25\u00ad44 years at\nbaseline, we excluded from analysis 808 (5.6 percent) who\nwere lost to follow-up, 500 (3.5 percent) who died before\nfrom the analyses were women who were pregnant at base-\nline or follow-up (n  104), persons with unknown baseline\nor follow-up blood pressure measurements or antihyperten-\nsive medication use (n  1,110), persons with unknown\neducational attainment (n  160), and persons who were\nhypertensive at baseline (n  1,261), that is, had systolic\nblood pressure equal to or greater than 160 mmHg, had dias-\ntolic blood pressure equal to or greater than 95 mmHg,\nand/or reported using antihypertensive medication. After all\nexclusions, 5,861 persons with normal blood pressure\nwomen, and 472 non-Hispanic Black men and women)\nremained for analysis. Included and excluded persons with\nnormal blood pressure, for whom data were available, had\noverall similar mean systolic blood pressure (p  0.28) and\nsimilar mean body mass index (p  0.06); excluded persons\nwith normal blood pressure were more likely to have lower\neducational attainment (p  0.001) and to be younger (p \n0.001) than persons included in the study.\nOutcome variable\nIncident hypertension was defined as follow-up systolic\nblood pressure equal to or greater than 160 mmHg and/or\ndiastolic blood pressure equal to or greater than 95 mmHg\nand/or follow-up report of current use of antihypertensive\nmedication. This definition of hypertension was chosen\nbecause it was the clinical definition of hypertension in use\nat the time of the baseline and follow-up examinations. The\nsidered the date of incidence because it is not possible to\nidentify the actual date of onset.\nMeasurement of variables\nAt the baseline physical examination, blood pressure\nmeasurements were taken at a mobile examination center by\na physician with the participant seated. One blood pressure\nmeasurement was attempted for all participants; two addi-\ntional blood pressure measurements were attempted for a\nsubsample of participants. Approximately 30 percent of the\nblood pressure measurements were taken with an aneroid\nsphygmomanometer, and the remainder were taken with a\nstandard mercury sphygmomanometer. There were no sig-\nnificant differences in blood pressure by type of sphygmo-\nmanometer used (23). Two cuff sizes, pediatric and adult,\nwere available. The cuff most appropriate for the partici-\npant's arm circumference was placed over the bulge in the\nupper right arm. Diastolic blood pressure was measured at\nthe point of complete cessation of Korotkoff's sounds or, if\nthere was no cessation, the point of muffling. Measurements\nwere recorded to the nearest 2 mm on the scale (23).\nAt follow-up, blood pressure was measured three times in\nthe participant's home by a trained interviewer. These mea-\nsurements were taken at the end of the interview with the\nparticipant seated using a mercury sphygmomanometer.\nThree cuffs (pediatric, adult, and large) were available (22).\nSimilar results were obtained when using all available blood\npressure measurements or only the first measurement; there-\nfore, for consistency, only the first measurement at baseline\nand follow-up is used for these analyses.\nEducational attainment at baseline was measured as the\nhighest completed grade of school and categorized as less\nreported race and ethnicity as obtained at follow-up were\nused in the analyses (22). Poverty status is defined by the\nratio of family income to the federal poverty line threshold\nthat is established annually by the US Bureau of the Census\nand adjusted by family composition. For this analysis,\npoverty status was defined as less than 100 percent of the\nthe federal poverty level, and 200 percent and above.\nMultiple dichotomous variables (Northeast, Midwest, West,\nand South as the reference category) were used to represent\nregion of residence to account for regional variation in\nhypertension prevalence and socioeconomic status.\nStatistical methods\nDemographic and other characteristics of the participants\nwere compared. Hypertension incidence rates were calculated\nas the number of incident cases per 1,000 person-years at risk.\nEstimates of the risk of developing hypertension among per-\nsons with less than 12 years and 12 years of education relative\nto those with more than 12 years of education were derived\nfrom Cox proportional hazards models using the PHREG pro-\ncedure in the Statistical Analysis System (24). Cox propor-\ntional hazards models account for the difference in follow-up\ntime among participants, which ranged from 6.7 to 12.6 years\n(mean  9.9 years). Persons who did not develop hyperten-\nsion were censored at the date of the follow-up examination.\nAll models included age at baseline, in single years, as a\ncovariate. Risk-adjusted models also included baseline body\nmass index (kg/m2), region of residence, and systolic blood\npressure (mmHg). Systolic blood pressure is included to\ncontrol for borderline or labile blood pressure elevations at\nbaseline.\nSeparate analyses were performed for non-Hispanic\nWhite men, non-Hispanic White women, and non-Hispanic\nBlacks because of the well-known racial/ethnic and sex dif-\nferentials in the prevalence of hypertension (25). Sex-\nspecific analyses were not performed for non-Hispanic\nBlacks because of small sample size. Models for non-\nHispanic Blacks also included sex as a covariate.\nInteractions among baseline education, age, body mass\nindex, region of residence, and systolic blood pressure were\nexamined for each racial/ethnic-sex group.\nThe association between hypertension incidence and edu-\ncation was examined for nonlinearity by performing analyses\nwith education entered in the model as a continuous variable\ntogether with the square of education (not shown). No evi-\ndence of nonlinearity was found for non-Hispanic White\nmen, non-Hispanic White women, or non-Hispanic Blacks.\nWe checked the proportional hazards assumption by plotting\nthe log-log survival curves for the education subgroups and\nby testing time-dependent covariates for education. The log-\nlog survival curves were approximately parallel, and the\ntime-dependent covariates were not significant, so we con-\ncluded that the data fit the proportional hazards assumption.\nTo assess the effect of the complex survey design on the\nresults, the proportional hazard models were also run using\nPROC SURVIVAL in SUDAAN (26). The results were con-\nsistent with minimal effects of the complex survey design on\nthe main conclusions derived from the unweighted esti-\nmates. Therefore, the estimates from the unweighted Cox\nregression models are presented (27).\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents the means or percentages of baseline risk\nfactors by racial/ethnic group, sex, and education in the\nanalysis cohort. Persons with less than 12 years of education\nwere older than persons with more education. Overall, the\nmean systolic blood pressure tended to be higher in the less\nthan 12 years of education group than in the more than 12\nyears of education group. The differential was statistically\nsignificant only among younger non-Hispanic White\nwomen. Non-Hispanic White women with less than 12 years\nof education had a significantly higher mean body mass\nindex than their counterparts with more education.\nTable 2 presents the number of incident hypertension cases\nby racial/ethnic group, sex, baseline age, and education. There\nwere 919 incident cases of hypertension during the follow-up\nperiod. For non-Hispanic Whites, the incidence rate of hyper-\ntension per 1,000 person-years, also shown in table 2, was\nconsistently higher among middle-aged persons than among\nyounger persons. For all demographic groups, the hyperten-\nsion incidence rate tended to be higher among persons with\nless than 12 years of education than among those with more\nthan 12 years of education. However, the 95 percent confi-\ndence intervals indicate that the differences in the incidence\nrate by education were statistically significant only among\nnon-Hispanic White men and women 25\u00ad44 years of age.\nThe proportional hazard models indicated the presence of\na significant interaction between education and age among\nnon-Hispanic White men and non-Hispanic White women\nBlack persons 25\u00ad44 years of age; there was also a signifi-\ncant interaction between body mass index and systolic blood\npressure among non-Hispanic White women 25\u00ad44 years of\nage. There were no other significant interactions. Therefore,\nthe models for non-Hispanic White persons were run sepa-\nrately for younger persons (25\u00ad44 years) and middle-aged\npersons (45\u00ad64 years), and risk-adjusted models for\nyounger non-Hispanic White women included the interac-\ntion term, body mass index \u00d7 systolic blood pressure.\nThe age-adjusted risk of hypertension incidence was signif-\nicantly higher among younger non-Hispanic White men and\nwomen with less than 12 years of education compared with\nthose with more than 12 years (men: relative risk (RR) \nrisk of hypertension for non-Hispanic White men changed lit-\ntle after adjusting for baseline risk factors (RR  2.01, 95 per-\ncent CI: 1.21, 3.35); the relative risk for women was reduced\n2.236). The risk of hypertension incidence for persons with\nless than 12 years of education compared with those with\nmore than 12 years of education was not significant in middle-\naged non-Hispanic White men and women or in younger non-\nHispanic Blacks.\nA proportional hazards model with education included as\na continuous variable was run for non-Hispanic Blacks to\nexplore whether the categorization of education may be\nmasking the association between education and hyperten-\nsion incidence. No significant association was found\nbetween hypertension incidence and single years of educa-\naccount for the lower educational attainment among older\npersons and non-Hispanic Blacks (table 1), we also per-\nformed analyses with education categorized as 0\u00ad7, 8\u00ad11,\nHypertension Incidence and Education 275\nand 12 and more years of educational attainment. No asso-\nciation was found between hypertension incidence and these\neducation categories in non-Hispanic Whites aged 45\u00ad64\nyears or in non-Hispanic Blacks (not shown).\nPoverty status was also included in the models to explore\nthe possible effects of socioeconomic status not represented\nby educational attainment. We chose poverty status over\nfamily income because the data on income provided by the\nNHANES I are in uneven categories and are truncated at\n$25,000, which makes them unsuitable for multivariate\nanalyses. Poverty status was significantly associated with\nthe incidence of hypertension only among older non-\nHispanic women; the association between educational\nattainment and the incidence of hypertension remained\nalmost unchanged after adding poverty status to the models.\nA study of the incidence of hypertension and occupational\nclass also found poverty not significant (20). To maintain\nthe models in their more parsimonious form, poverty status\nwas not included in the final models.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study we examined the prospective relation\nbetween educational attainment and subsequent hyperten-\nsion among non-Hispanic White men and women aged\n25\u00ad64 years and non-Hispanic Black men and women aged\n25\u00ad44 years from a nationally representative sample.\nEducational attainment was selected as the main socioeco-\nnomic status variable because it has been reported as the\nfacet of socioeconomic status more determinant of health\nstatus, particularly cardiovascular conditions (28), it is the\nvariable that structures occupation and income (29), and it is\nthe only indicator that remains relatively consistent through\nadult life (5). We found a previously unreported interaction\nbetween baseline age and education that was highly signifi-\ncant (p < 0.001). The risk of developing hypertension after\nadjusting for age is inversely associated with educational\nattainment among non-Hispanic White persons 25\u00ad44 years\nof age at baseline; non-Hispanic White men and women in\nthis age group with less than 12 years of education have a\nhigher risk of hypertension than their counterparts with\nmore than 12 years of education. The association of educa-\ntion and risk of developing hypertension among non-\nHispanic White men 25\u00ad44 years of age could not be\nexplained by the risk factors included in the models, body\nmass index, region of residence, and systolic blood pressure;\namong non-Hispanic White women 25\u00ad44 years of age,\nthese risk factors explained part of the association between\nTABLE 1.

To explore this possi-\nbility, we performed the analysis with educational attainment\nrelative risk estimates among persons 45\u00ad64 years of age\nusing these new categories of education were essentially the\nsame as those obtained using the original categorization.\nAlthough the association between hypertension incidence\nand educational attainment in non-Hispanic Blacks 25\u00ad44\nyears of age failed to achieve statistical significance and was\nreduced after controlling for age (table 2), two previous\nstudies have reported an association between hypertension\nincidence and socioeconomic status among Blacks. A 14-\nyear follow-up study in Charleston, South Carolina, found a\nnegative association between hypertension incidence and an\nindex based on education and occupation among Blacks (16,\n18). This study included a group of high socioeconomic sta-\ntus non-Hispanic Blacks to increase the socioeconomic sta-\ntus variation of the study sample. A 3-year follow-up study\nof non-Hispanic Blacks residing in the inner city of\nBaltimore, Maryland, found an association between hyper-\ntension incidence and income but not between hypertension\nincidence and education (analyses performed using multiple\nregression with a binary dependent variable) (17). In models\nwith poverty status instead of education, we did not find that\npoverty was associated significantly with hypertension inci-\ndence. The lack of association in our study may be due in\npart to the small number of non-Hispanic Blacks in the\nNHEFS with more than 12 years of education, which\nyielded only 13 cases (table 2). Hence, the statistical power\nof our analysis was low; confidence intervals indicate that\nan important association cannot be excluded. When the\nanalysis was repeated using the education categories 0\u00ad8,\n9\u00ad11, and 12 years and over, no significant association was\nfound.\nTABLE 2.

Our\nage group-specific analyses indicated that education is asso-\nciated with the risk of hypertension only among younger\nnon-Hispanic White persons but not among persons 45\u00ad64\nyears of age.\nThe finding that younger non-Hispanic White men and\nwomen with lower educational attainment are more likely to\nbecome hypertensive than their counterparts with higher\neducational attainment may reflect the deleterious effects of\nlower socioeconomic conditions of life on health. Studies\nhave shown that persons living in lower socioeconomic sta-\ntus environments are more exposed to health insults, some\nof which are associated with hypertension: depression (31),\nsedentarism (32, 33), and behaviors to cope with life's hard-\nships such as alcohol intake (33, 34) and cigarette smoking\n(33). Our results indicating an association of hypertension\nincidence and educational attainment only among the\nyounger group are consistent with the \"weathering\" hypoth-\nesis proposed by Geronimus (35, 36). This hypothesis con-\ntends that persons living in low socioeconomic status condi-\ntions see their health profiles worsening at earlier ages than\ntheir counterparts living in more favorable conditions (36).\nIn our study, middle-aged persons with low education who\nsurvive the younger years without hypertension are at the\nsame risk as their counterparts with more education.\nLimitations of this analysis include possible bias arising\nfrom loss to follow-up, missing data on baseline risk vari-\nables, and missing data at follow-up. In addition, partici-\npants who died between baseline and follow-up could not be\nincluded in the analysis. This situation may produce a bias\nbecause most persons who died or were lost to follow-up\nwere in the low education group and the older age group.\nThis bias was reduced by limiting the analyses to partici-\npants 25\u00ad64 years of age. Another limitation is that the use\nof only one blood pressure measurement may introduce\nerrors due to within-person blood pressure variability.\nAlthough analyses including all available measurements\nwere consistent with those presented here, some misclassifi-\ncation bias associated with within-person blood pressure\nvariability may remain. Unfortunately, the NHEFS does not\nprovide repeated blood pressure measurements at follow-up\nto correct for within-person measurement error (37, 38).\nHowever, there is no reason to believe that this possible bias\nis associated with educational attainment; thus, any bias of\nresults on incidence of hypertension by educational attain-\nment should be toward the null. Bias in the model coeffi-\ncients could also be caused by substantial intraindividual\nvariation in one of the independent variables, baseline sys-\ntolic blood pressure (and also systolic blood pressure \u00d7 body\nmass index in the case of younger White women). This\ncould occur independent of the likelihood of misclassifica-\ntion of the outcome variable. Assuming that baseline sys-\ntolic blood pressure is positively associated with incident\nhypertension and that educational attainment is negatively\nassociated with baseline systolic blood pressure, the bias is\nlikely toward the null, but bias away from the null cannot be\nexcluded. The small number of non-Hispanic Black men\nand women precluded more detailed analysis by sex and age\ngroups and caused a lack of precision as reflected by wide\nconfidence intervals, so that a significant association of risk\nof hypertension with educational attainment could not be\nexcluded. The possibility of confounding by variables not\nmeasured cannot be excluded.\nIn summary, our results confirm previous findings that\npersons with low educational attainment are at higher risk of\nhypertension; they add to previous reports the finding that\nthe excess risk of hypertension for non-Hispanic White per-\nsons with low education is confined to early adulthood,\n25\u00ad44 years of age. Non-Hispanic White men and women\n25\u00ad44 years of age with lower educational attainment are at\nhigher risk of hypertension than their counterparts with\nhigher educational attainment, even after adjusting for risk\nfactors. No association between educational attainment and\nrisk of hypertension was found for middle-aged non-\nHispanic White participants. Our results of no association\nbetween education and the incidence of hypertension among\nnon-Hispanic Black participants 25\u00ad44 years of age should\nbe considered with caution because of the small sample size.\nFuture studies should assess this association using popula-\ntion samples including larger numbers of non-Hispanic\nBlacks, as well as persons from other racial/ethnic groups,\nand the elderly.\n"
