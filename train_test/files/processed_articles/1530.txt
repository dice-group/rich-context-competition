The mere presence of\nanother individual can alleviate stress (Cohen & Williamson,\n1991; Thoits), whereas feelings of loneliness may exacer-\nbate the physiological effects of stress, resulting in elevated\ncortisol levels (Hawkley, Burleson, Berntson, & Cacioppo,\nblood pressure (Hawkley et al).\nThe purpose of this article is to demonstrate the develop-\nment of scales capturing social disconnectedness and per-\nceived isolation using data from the National Social Life,\nHealth, and Aging Project (NSHAP). We use procedures of\nscale construction to combine multiple indicators of isola-\ntion into a scale assessing social disconnectedness and a\nscale capturing perceived isolation. We then examine the\nrelationship between disconnectedness and perceived isola-\ntion and assess their distributions across age, gender, and\nself-rated health among older adults. Our aim is not to pres-\nent these scales as definitive measures but to encourage fur-\nther work toward elucidating the concept, causes, and\nconsequences of social isolation among older adults.\nSocial Isolation Among Older Adults\nThe examination of social isolation among older adults is\nparticularly important for a number of reasons. First, there\nis some evidence that social isolation may become more\ncommon with increasing age. Older adults tend to have\nsmaller social networks (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, &\nBrashears, 2006) and are more likely to experience feelings\nof loneliness (Dykstra, van Tilburg, & de Jong Gierveld,\n2005). This may be due, in part, to older adults' experiences\nof bereavement and their greater likelihood of living alone\nof these conditions has led to the assumption that diminish-\ning social networks result in lower levels of perceived social\nsupport and increased loneliness.\nHowever, recent research suggests that changes across\nthe life course in social connectedness and satisfaction may\nbe heterogeneous. For example, data from NSHAP indicate\nMeasuring Social Isolation Among Older Adults Using\nMultiple Indicators From the NSHAP Study\nErin York Cornwell1 and Linda J.

The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) data contain multiple indicators of social\nconnectedness, social participation, social support, and loneliness among older adults. We suggest that these indicators\ncan be combined to measure two aspects of social isolation: social disconnectedness (i.e., physical separation from oth-\ners) and perceived isolation (i.e., feelings of loneliness and a lack of social support). We use the NSHAP data to create\nscales measuring social disconnectedness and perceived isolation and examine their distribution among older adults.\nMethods. We assess the reliability of the scales using Cronbach's alpha and item-total correlations and perform con-\nfirmatory factor analysis to test the model against the data. Finally, we test differences in scale means across subgroups\nto assess the distribution of social disconnectedness and perceived isolation among older adults.\nResults. We find that 17 indicators combine into two reliable scales. The social disconnectedness scale has a two-\nfactor structure, including the restricted social network dimension and the social inactivity dimension. The perceived\nisolation scale also comprises two dimensions: lack of support and loneliness. We find that social disconnectedness does\nnot vary across age groups, but the oldest old feel more isolated than the young old. Social disconnectedness and per-\nceived isolation are greater among those who have worse health.\nDiscussion. The creation of scales measuring social disconnectedness and perceived isolation provides one way to\nutilize the wide variety of indicators of social isolation collected in the NSHAP study. Although individual indicators of\nsocial connectedness or isolation are useful in their own right, these scales provide parsimonious, continuous variables\nthat account for a variety of aspects of social isolation, which may be especially useful for inclusion in multivariate\nanalyses predicting health outcomes.\nKey Words: Loneliness--Social isolation--Social networks--Social participation--Social support.\nthat the oldest old have greater participation than the young\nold (Cornwell, Laumann, & Schumm, 2008), and other re-\nsearch suggests that loneliness may peak in middle age\n(Carstensen, Isaacowitz, & Charles, 1999). Accordingly, so-\ncial connectedness, support, and loneliness may not be inex-\ntricably linked, especially among older adults. In the face of\nshrinking social networks, older adults may develop closer\nrelationships and shift expectations so that decreasing con-\nnectedness does not necessarily result in the perception of\nFinally, to the extent that social isolation is associated\nwith worse health, it may pose a particularly severe risk for\nolder adults. Older adults are more likely to experience be-\nreavement and develop health problems, both of which may\nincrease their need for social support and companionship.\nAs a result, social isolation may be particularly deleterious\nfor older adults. Indeed, research indicates that older adults\nwho experience one or another aspect of isolation have been\nfound to be at greater risk for all-cause mortality, increased\nmorbidity, depression, and cognitive decline (Brummett\nUmberson, 1988; Sherbourne, Meredith, Rogers, & Ware,\nMeasuring Social Isolation\nThe variety of indicators of isolation and loneliness used\nacross research in different disciplines is both a blessing\nand a curse. This work has captured an enormous number of\nfacets of individuals' everyday social worlds. Indicators of\nisolation in previous research include living alone (Dean,\nRoss, 1995), having a small social network (Berkman &\ninfrequent contact with network members (Brummett et al.,\n2001), a lack of social network diversity (Barefoot,\nGronbaek, Jensen, Schnohr, & Prescott, 2005), a perceived\ntion in social activities (Benjamins, 2004; Ellison & George,\nships (Uno, Uchino, & Smith, 2002), and feelings of loneli-\nness or not belonging (Cacioppo et al., 2006; Hawkley et al.,\n2003). However, most of this work has been limited to the\nexamination of only one or two indicators of isolation (or\nconnectedness), or it has focused on only one conceptual\narea, such as support, participation, or loneliness. As a re-\nsult, it is difficult to discern whether multiple features of\nisolation might combine to create particularly severe situa-\ntions of social isolation among the oldest old. It is also un-\nclear whether feelings of loneliness and a lack of social\nsupport do, in fact, follow the loss of social network ties or\nif more subjective appraisals of isolation are separate from\nobjective features of isolation.\nIn efforts to consolidate multiple measures of social iso-\nlation, several authors have previously identified central\ncomponents of isolation. For example, van Baarsen,\nSnijders, Smit, and van Duijn (2001) distinguish between\nsocial loneliness, as the lack of integration and compan-\nionship, and emotional loneliness, as the lack of an attach-\nment figure. De Jong Gierveld and Hagestad (2006)\nsimilarly contrast isolation (as the opposite of integration)\nwith loneliness (as the opposite of embeddedness). Fol-\nlowing these distinctions and building from the disciplin-\nary approaches of both sociology and psychology, we\nsuggest two distinct aspects of social isolation. Social dis-\nconnectedness can be characterized by a lack of contact\nwith others and indicated by situational factors, such as a\nsmall social network, infrequent interaction, and a lack of\nparticipation in social activities and groups. Perceived iso-\nlation, on the other hand, can be characterized by the sub-\njective experience of a shortfall in one's social resources\nsuch as companionship and support. Individuals who are\nsocially disconnected may have small social networks, in-\nteract with network members infrequently, and rarely par-\nticipate in social activities. On the other hand, individuals\nwho perceive themselves to be isolated may report feel-\nings of loneliness and perceive a lack of social support\nfrom friends and family members.\nSocial disconnectedness and perceived isolation are re-\nlated, but we hypothesize that they are distinct. Some re-\nsearch indicates, for example, that feelings of loneliness are\nresponsive to changes in network size, but other findings\nindicate only a modest correlation between disconnected-\nness and perceived isolation (Hawkley et al., 2003; Hughes,\nthough physical separation from others and feelings of\nloneliness may go hand-in-hand for some individuals, infre-\nquent social interaction may not lead to feelings of loneli-\nness for others. Alternatively, people who are socially active\nand embedded within an expansive social network may feel\nsocially isolated if their relationships lack emotional close-\nness and support.\nMethods\nWe use data from NSHAP, a nationally representative,\npopulation-based study of community-residing older adults.\nyears. The study achieved a final weighted response rate of\n75.5%. NSHAP used a modularized questionnaire design\nso that some questions were included in a leave-behind\nquestionnaire for a randomly selected subset of respon-\ndents. Detailed information about the NSHAP study design\nmay be found in O'Muircheartaigh, Eckman, and Smith\n(in press).\nNSHAP includes a wide variety of indicators of social\nconnectedness, support, and activity, as well as feelings\nof loneliness. Measures such as network size, frequency\nof interaction with network members, participation in so-\ncial groups, and perceived support can be reversed to in-\ndicate the lack of these social resources. We seek to\ncombine all these items into reliable scales of social dis-\nconnectedness and perceived isolation. Scale creation is\ntypically used to measure constructs that cannot be ade-\nquately or directly assessed using one or two indicators.\nTherefore, by combining indicators that theoretically co-\nvary with objective isolation and subjective isolation, we\ncan create a parsimonious proxy measure for these two\nScale Construction\nWe will begin by selecting items for each scale based\non their content validity, determined by previous research\nsuggesting that these items may be indicative of objective\nor subjective isolation. Assessments of scale reliability\nindicate how strongly the scale's items are correlated with\neach other. Because we assume that the items in the two\nscales are indicative of objective social isolation and sub-\njective social isolation, we also expect that the items\nwithin each respective scale will be interrelated. Two\nmeasures indicate the extent of interrelation among scale\nitems. First, item-rest correlations, or the correlations be-\ntween each item and the set of other items included in the\nscale, provide a measure of the scale's internal consis-\ntency. Second, the proportion of total variation in the\nscale that is shared by the included items is indicated by\nCronbach's (1951) alpha coefficient. Alpha coefficients\ngreater than .70 typically connote acceptable overall scale\nexamine whether the scales retain acceptable internal\nconsistency reliability across sociodemographic charac-\nteristics.\nWe create the social disconnectedness and perceived iso-\nlation scales by retaining items that maximize internal con-\nsistency reliability. Scale scores are calculated for each\nrespondent by standardizing the retained items (so that\nM=0 and SD=1) and dividing the sum of the standardized\nvalues by the total number of nonmissing items.This method\nenables the calculation of a valid scale score as long as a\nrespondent has responded to at least one item included in\nthe scale. Scores on each scale may then be interpreted as a\nstandardized variable. A score of zero indicates that the re-\nspondent provided the mean response for each of the in-\ncluded items. Positive scores indicate greater-than-average\nisolation, whereas negative scores indicate lower-than-\naverage isolation.\nConfirmatory Factor Analysis\nWe conduct confirmatory factor analysis to test the factor\nstructures expected to underlie each scale, as described sub-\nsequently. We assess the standardized loadings for each fac-\ntor, which can be interpreted as the correlations between the\nobserved variables and the unobserved variables. We also\nconsider the overall fit of each hypothesized model to the\nsample using three goodness-of-fit indices. The c2 statistic\ncompares the tested model with a saturated model, with the\nnull hypothesis that the tested model is a good fit. However,\nthe test is sensitive to sample size (Joreskog, 1969), so this\nmay not be a useful indicator for the present study. The\ncomparative fit index indicates how well the specified model\nfits compared with a baseline model. Higher values indicate\na better fit, and values above 0.90 are generally considered\nto indicate a good fit (Diamantopoulos & Sigaw, 2000). The\nroot mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) indi-\ncates the closeness of the fit of the model in relation to its\ndegrees of freedom. Previous research has suggested that\nvalues less than .05 indicate a close fit (Browne & Cudeck,\nDistribution of Social Isolation\nWe assess the distributions of social disconnectedness\nand perceived isolation by comparing mean scale scores\nacross age, gender, and self-rated health among NSHAP re-\nspondents. Because previous research has been inconclu-\nsive regarding whether social isolation increases with age,\ndifferences in the social isolation scales according to age\nwill be of particular interest.\nResults\nThe Social Disconnectedness Scale\nWe propose that social disconnectedness can be assessed\nusing items capturing two central factors: a lack of social\nnetwork robustness and a lack of participation in social ac-\ntivities. Based on their content validity, we initially identi-\nfied 13 items for inclusion in the social disconnectedness\nscale. The internal consistency of the scale was maximized\nby removing five items: neighborhood socializing, fre-\nquency of attendance at religious services, living alone/\nhousehold size, partnership status, number of children, and\nnumber of grandchildren. Eight variables were retained.\nDetailed information on their measurement is presented in\nWe include in the social disconnectedness scale four\nmeasures from the NSHAP social network module, which\nwas based on the General Social Survey and described in\nCornwell, Laumann, Schumm, and Graber (in press). Social\nnetwork characteristics such as size, range, frequency of in-\nteraction, and geographical proximity of network members\nhave been used in previous research to describe the collection\nof people with whom a given individual interacts and may\nrely on for social support (Haines & Hurlbert, 1992; Lin et al.,\n1999). Network measures also, therefore, can be used to reveal\nrelative deficiencies in one's social connectedness. A small\nor nonexistent network, a network that is geographically\ndispersed, or infrequent interaction with one's network\nmembers, for example, may each indicate some level of\nphysical separation from others.\nSocial network size indicates the number of individuals\nwith whom the respondent can discuss important matters.\nSocial network range captures the extent to which a respon-\ndent's network comprises different types of relationships.\nThose who have greater network range are less apt to be\nsocially isolated because they have a larger variety of indi-\nviduals (e.g., a spouse, family member, friend, coworker)\nwith whom they can interact. The proportion of social net-\nwork members who live in the household provides a rough\nestimate of the physical proximity of one's network mem-\nbers. Individuals who have a smaller proportion of their net-\nwork members residing with them have fewer opportunities\nfor interaction and may experience more objective isolation\nthan those who reside with a larger proportion of their net-\nwork members. Finally, frequency of contact with network\nmembers indicates an individual's exposure to his network\nmembers.\nWe also incorporate an indicator of the respondent's num-\nber of friends. Respondents indicated how many people they\nconsidered to be their \"closest friends\" and those who were\n\"pretty good friends,\" excluding spouses and family mem-\nbers. This provides another assessment of the social connec-\ntions available to individuals, in addition to the network roster.\nThe number of friends provides a rough indicator of social\nconnectedness with others, regardless of the respondent's\nability and/or willingness to discuss \"important matters\" with\nthese people. This question was modularized so that a ran-\ndom two thirds of respondents answered the question during\nthe in-person interview and one third responded to the ques-\ntion on the leave-behind questionnaire. Mean response does\nnot differ according to the collection mode.\nWe initially included several other variables generally as-\nsessing the extent of the respondent's universe of friends and\nfamily members and his or her contact with them. First, liv-\ning alone is one of the most widely used indicators of social\nisolation, and it typically indicates some degree of physical\nseparation from others. We tested both a dummy variable\nTable 1.

Our\nfinding that living alone or having a small household do not\ncontribute to objective isolation, as measured here, supports\nprevious findings that living arrangements are not necessar-\nily indicative of social isolation (Waite & Hughes, 1999).\nWe also began with several variables that provide counts\nof the respondent's family members, since being single and\nhaving fewer children and grandchildren may be associated\nwith social disconnectedness among older adults. We ini-\ntially included in the social disconnectedness scale a dummy\nvariable indicating partnership status and counts of the re-\nspondent's number of children and number of grandchil-\ndren. However, these items were removed from the scale\nbecause their item-total correlations were below .30 and\ntheir exclusion increased the overall internal consistency\nreliability of the scale.\nParticipation in social activities such as organized group\ninvolvement, volunteering, and attendance at religious ser-\nvices has been used by previous research as indicators of\nsocial connectedness (Ellison & George, 1994; McIntosh,\nSykes, & Kubena, 2002). We selected several items indicat-\ning participation in social groups or activities for inclusion\nin the social disconnectedness scale. NSHAP respondents\nwere asked about their frequency of volunteer work, attend-\ning meetings of an organized group, and getting together\nsocially with friends or relatives. We also initially included\nassessments of the frequency of socializing with neighbors\nand attending religious services but removed these items to\nimprove the internal consistency reliability of the scale.\nThe resulting social disconnectedness scale includes the\neight items shown in Table 2. These items were standard-\nized and averaged to create the scale, and then the scores\nwere reversed because the variables initially measured con-\nnectedness rather than isolation. Scores on the social dis-\nness scores above zero are indicative of greater-than-average\ndisconnectedness, whereas scores below zero suggest lower-\nthan-average disconnectedness. In general, higher scores\nindicate greater isolation.\nScale reliability.--This combination of the eight items\nretained in the scale maximized the internal consistency re-\nliability with a Cronbach's alpha of .73, and all item-rest\ncorrelations were moderate to strong. The Social discon-\nnectedness scale has acceptable reliability across age groups\nand gender, as shown in Table 2. Item-rest correlations for\nthe scale are also remarkably similar across these subgroups,\nand nearly all of them are at least moderate in strength. The\nonly exception is the variable indicating (a lack of) social-\nizing with family and friends, for which the item-rest cor-\nrelation falls to .27 among men.\nConfirmatory factor analysis.--Results from a confirmato-\nry factor analysis indicate that the data support a two-factor\nstructure, with dimensions similar to those we described ear-\nlier. The four network items load on a restricted social network\ndimension, and the three social participation variables load on\na social inactivity dimension. One surprise was that the lack of\nfriends is more reflective of social inactivity than a restricted\nsocial network. This indicator has a standardized loading of\n0.58 on the inactivity dimension. Each of the items has moder-\nate to strong loadings on the corresponding dimension. The\ncorrelation between the restricted network dimension and the\ninactivity dimension is moderate in strength, at .43.\nFit statistics generally indicate a good fit of the model to\nindicating that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the\nmodel does not fit the data. However, this statistic is likely\ninflated by the large sample size (Joreskog, 1969). The com-\nparative fit index of 1.00 is well above the threshold of 0.90\nfor indication of a good fit compared with the baseline mode\nindicates that the model is a close fit to the data because it is\nlower than the typical cutoff of 0.05 (Browne & Cudeck,\nThe Perceived Isolation Scale\nWe also constructed a scale of subjective, or perceived,\nisolation. Based on their content validity, we began scale\nconstruction with 10 items from the NSHAP data indicating\none's perception of the supportiveness, closeness, adequacy,\nand companionship provided by one's social relationships.\nWe retained nine items, which fall into two general catego-\nries: a perceived lack of support and loneliness. Descrip-\ntions of these items are presented in Table 1.\nSix of the nine items in the perceived isolation scale cap-\nture the respondent's assessment of social support available\nfrom family, friends, and one's spouse or current partner.\nThese questions are drawn from the 2002 Health and Re-\ntirement Study. Respondents were asked how often they can\nopen up to their spouse or current partner, family members,\nand friends and how often they can rely on people from\nthese three groups. The perception that one can rarely ac-\ncess emotional and instrumental support from friends and\nfamily may contribute to perceived isolation.\nBecause loneliness is based on the perception of having\nfewer (or less close) interpersonal relationships than one would\nlike (van Baarsen et al., 2001), we consider it here as a facet of\nsubjective social isolation. We incorporate responses to the\nthree-item loneliness scale developed by Hughes and col-\nleagues (2004) and examined in Shiovitz-Ezra, Leitsch, Graber,\nand Karraker (in press). The loneliness scale includes items\nassessing the respondent's perceived lack of companionship\nand frequency of feeling left out and isolated (Hughes et al.).\nWe also examined the possibility of including a variable\nassessing average emotional closeness with one's network\nmembers. We expected that low emotional closeness with\nnetwork members would indicate perceived isolation. How-\never, this item had a low item-rest correlation (.22) and its\nremoval increased the scale's overall internal consistency\n(although the improvement was marginal, from .69 to .70).\nWe therefore removed this item from the scale. Most re-\nspondents indicated that their relationships with network\nmembers were quite close, so a lack of cases at the low end\nof this variable may have reduced its fit with the scale. More\nimportantly, the item's lack of fit with the scale indicates\nthat the quality of one's relationships may be conceptually\ndistinct from the perception of isolation.\nTable 2 lists the nine items retained in the perceived iso-\nlation scale. The items were standardized and their values\nwere averaged to arrive at a score for perceived isolation.\nceived isolation.\nScale reliability--The resulting scale has a Cronbach's\nalpha of .70, indicating acceptable internal consistency.\nEach of the item-rest correlations exceeds the cutoff of .20\nfor satisfactory reliability (Kline, 1986). With the exception\nof the item assessing one's ability to open up to his or her\nfriends, all the item-rest correlations are above .30. The\nscale also demonstrates acceptable reliability across age\ngroups and gender, as shown in Table 2. Although the Cron-\nbach's alpha coefficients drop slightly below .70 for the\nmiddle-old and oldest-old age groups, as well as for males,\nthe differences across subgroups are small. Item-rest corre-\nlations across the age and gender subgroups range from .23\nto .30, with the vast majority of these correlations being\nConfirmatory factor analysis--Results from a confirma-\ntory factor analysis indicate that six items assessing\nsocial support load on a perceived lack of support dimen-\nsion, and the three items from the short loneliness scale load\non a loneliness dimension. Standardized loadings exceed\n0.60, with the exception of the item regarding reliance on\none's spouse, which has a standardized loading of 0.32 on\nthe perceived lack of support dimension. The correlation\nbetween the perceived lack of support dimension and the\nloneliness dimension (.19) is weak to moderate in strength.\nFit statistics generally indicate an acceptable fit of the\nmodel to the data. The c2 statistic is significant (c2 =52.60,\np<.001), indicating that we cannot reject the null hypothe-\nsis that the model does not fit the data. This statistic should\nbe used with caution, however, because it is likely inflated\nby the large sample size (Joreskog, 1969). Both the\nceed conventional thresholds (Browne & Cudeck, 1993;\nDiamantopoulos & Sigaw, 2000), thereby indicating that\nthe model has an acceptably close fit to the data.\nSocial Disconnectedness and Perceived Isolation Among\nOlder Adults\nMost previous research has found only a modest correlation\nbetween aspects of disconnectedness and perceived isolation\n1986). As depicted in Figure 1, the social disconnectedness\nTable 2. Reliability of the Social Disconnectedness and Perceived Isolation Scales, by Age Groups and Gender\nItem-rest correlations\nOverall\nAge groups Gender\nSocial Disconnectedness Scale\nPerceived Isolation Scale\nand perceived isolation scales are positively correlated,\nbut the correlation is weak to moderate in strength (r=.25,\np<.001). Individuals who lack social connections are more\nlikely to feel isolated. However, some people who have many\nsocial connections still feel lonely, whereas others who have\nvery few social connections do not feel lonely at all.\nWhat is the distribution of the experience and perception\nof social isolation within a population-based sample of\nolder adults? We provide a brief examination of this by con-\nsidering mean scores for the social disconnectedness and\nperceived isolation scales across age, gender, and self-rated\nhealth of the older adults in our sample.\nPrevious research indicates that loneliness increases with\nage (Dykstra et al., 2005) and social connectedness may de-\ncline with age (McPherson et al., 2006), although other\nwork has suggested that older adults may adjust their social\nnetworks and expectations so that they are no more isolated\nor lonely than their younger counterparts (Lang &\nwe find very little difference in social disconnectedness\nacross age groups. The oldest old do not have fewer connec-\ntions than the younger old, on average, but the perception of\nisolation does increase with age. The oldest old have sig-\nnificantly higher scores for perceived isolation than the\nyoungest old (p<.01).\nWith respect to gender, previous research suggests that\nsocial network size does not significantly differ for men and\nwomen (McPherson et al., 2006). However, women are\nmore likely to participate in social activities and voluntary\nthey tend to experience less loneliness than men (Borys &\nPerlman, 1985). But this previous work has not focused\nspecifically on late adulthood, when widowhood, retire-\nment, health changes, and other factors may shift individu-\nals' opportunities for social engagement (Ferraro, 1984; Li\n& Ferraro, 2005). As indicated in Table 3, we find that\nwomen have significantly lower scores for both social dis-\nconnectedness and perceived isolation (p<.001), on aver-\nage. Older women, therefore, are less likely than men to\nsuffer social disconnectedness or perceived isolation than\nolder men.\nFinally, nearly all the indicators of isolation that we have\ncombined in these two scales have associated with worse\nhealth in previous research (see, e.g., Berkman, 1995;\n1988). We therefore expect that both social disconnected-\nness and perceived isolation will be negatively related to\nself-rated health. Indeed, we find higher levels of social dis-\nconnectedness and perceived isolation among older adults\nwho have worse health. More specifically, older adults who\nrated their health as \"very good\" or \"excellent\" had below\naverage levels of both social disconnectedness and perceived\nisolation. But those who have \"good,\" \"fair,\" or \"poor\"\nhealth also have significantly greater scores on the social\nisolation scales. The gradient observed here--where both\nsocial disconnectedness and perceived isolation increase as\nself-rated health decreases--suggests a broad relationship\nbetween social isolation and health. Further research is\nneeded to elucidate the causal order in the relationships\nbetween health and various aspects of social isolation and to\nassess the relative effects of social disconnectedness and\nperceived isolation on particular health outcomes.\nDiscussion\nBy combining multiple indicators of social isolation col-\nlected in the NSHAP study, we have developed two reliable\nscales assessing social disconnectedness and perceived iso-\nlation. Our results indicate that these two dimensions of iso-\nlation are related but distinct. Individuals who have small\nsocial networks or rarely participate in social activities do\nnot necessarily feel lonely. Furthermore, one may be sur-\nrounded by friends and family but perceive a lack of social\nsupport and feel left out.\nSocial Disconnectedness (standardized)\nPerceived Isolation (standardized)\nFigure 1.

Significance lev-\nels from Wald tests of differences in means are presented for subgroups.\nBecause so many different aspects of social isolation have\nbeen separately examined in previous research, this work\nhas been inconclusive regarding whether social isolation in-\ncreases with age. Our findings show that social disconnect-\nedness is not more marked among the oldest old compared\nwith the young old. However, the oldest old are more likely\nto perceive themselves as isolated than the young old. Fur-\nther research is needed to understand the source of the\ngreater feelings of loneliness and the perceived lack of so-\ncial support that are more common among oldest adults.\nThe creation of scales measuring social disconnectedness\nand perceived isolation provides one way to use the wide\nvariety of indicators of social isolation collected in the\nNSHAP study. These scales also recognize an important fact\nabout the complexity of individuals' everyday social lives:\nNo single indicator of perceived or actual social isolation can\nfully assess the degree to which an individual lacks social\nresources or outlets for socializing, feels that emotional and\nmaterial support are unavailable in times of need, or yearns\nfor companionship. Further research is needed to assess the\nvalidity of these scales and refine the measurement of social\ndisconnectedness and perceived isolation. At the most basic\nlevel, we argue that the combination of multiple measures is\nimperative for the assessment of social isolation.\nThe social disconnectedness and perceived isolation\nscales available in the NSHAP data bring a number of ben-\nefits for future research. First, because the scales are con-\ntinuous variables, they enable analysis of the functional\nform of the relationship between disconnectedness and per-\nceived isolation and specific health outcomes. We can as-\nsess, for example, whether social isolation exerts a gradual\nor threshold effect on health. The scales also allow research-\ners to take into account a number of aspects of isolation\nusing a parsimonious indicator, which is especially useful\nfor inclusion in multivariate analyses predicting health out-\ncomes. Most importantly, the scales will enable comparison\nof the specific health risks brought by a lack of social con-\nnections versus perceived isolation. We hope that these\nanalyses will move us closer to understanding the mecha-\nnisms through which each form of isolation may threaten\nhealth and well-being among the growing population of\ncommunity-residing older adults.\n"
