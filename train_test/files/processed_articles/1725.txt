    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: This article reports the first national assessment of patterns of drinking and\ngambling-related rulemaking on college campuses (e.g., punitive versus recovery oriented).\nAnalyses relating school policies to known school rates of drinking or gambling identified potentially\ninfluential policies. These results can inform and encourage the development of guidelines, or \"best\npractices,\" upon which schools can base future policy.\nMethods: The college policy information was collected from handbooks, Web sites and\nsupplemental materials of 119 scientifically selected colleges included in the fourth (2001) Harvard\nSchool of Public Health College Alcohol Study (CAS). A coding instrument of 40 items measured\nthe scope and focus of school alcohol and gambling policies. This instrument included items to\nmeasure the presence of specific policies and establish whether the policies were punitive or\nrehabilitative. A total of 11 coders followed a process of information extraction, coding and\narbitration used successfully in other published studies to codify policy information.\nResults: Although all schools had a student alcohol use policy, only 26 schools (22%) had a\ngambling policy. Punitive and restrictive alcohol policies were most prevalent; recovery-oriented\npolicies were present at fewer than 30% of schools. Certain alcohol and gambling policies had\nsignificant relationships with student binge drinking rates.\nConclusions: The relative lack of college recovery-oriented policies suggests that schools might\nbe overlooking the value of rehabilitative measures in reducing addictive behaviors among students.\nSince there are few college gambling-related policies, schools might be missing an opportunity to\ninform students about the dangers of excessive gambling.\nBackground\nYoung people are at increased risk for alcohol- and gam-\nbling-related problems compared to their older counter-\nparts [1-3]. College and university students are at special\nrisk because going to college often represents the first\nmove away from their family and, as a result, fewer restric-\ntions on their activities. (Because universities are by defi-\nnition comprised of colleges, all institutions of higher\nlearning henceforth will be referred to as \"colleges.\") In\nthe United States, each year approximately 1.2 million\nfreshmen enter four-year colleges [4]. Some of these fresh-\nmen enter college actively involved in recovery programs\nThis article is available from: http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/2/1/1\n\u00a9 2005 Shaffer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nfor alcohol abuse or other addictive behaviors (e.g., illicit\ndrug abuse or gambling). Others will begin a program of\nrecovery for addiction problems that started after they\nenrolled at school. The college years are a time of develop-\nmental transition for most students; like other life transi-\ntions, the college experience can be associated with\nincreased risk for a variety of psychosocial problems.\nThe problems associated with addictive behaviors on col-\nlege campuses have been well documented (e.g., aca-\ndemic difficulties, psychosocial problems, traumatic\ninjuries, overdoses, high-risk sexual behavior, and\nimpaired driving) (e.g., Wechsler et al. 2000 [5], Wechsler\net al. 2002 [6]). Despite a recent increase in college-based\npreventative measures (e.g., alcohol education programs,\nadvertising restrictions, alcohol-free dormitories, policy\ncontrols), research reveals that addiction-related prob-\nlems continue to plague college campuses. For example,\nduring the past decade, past-year alcohol use and binge\ndrinking rates have remained steady at approximately\n81% and 44%, respectively [6], and alcohol-related prob-\nlems have been on the rise. Wechsler et al. (2002 [6])\nfound that a greater percentage of students who had used\nalcohol in the past 30 days were involved in police-related\nwas true of alcohol-related injuries (12.8% vs. 9.3%).\nWechsler et al. (2002) also identified a significant increase\nin the rate of students riding in motor vehicles with alco-\nvs. 18.4%). These findings highlight the need for college\nadministrators to reconsider current preventative meas-\nures and develop and implement more effective methods\nfor preventing and reducing alcohol use. For example, col-\nlege health programs might be able to limit or reduce\nalcohol-related harms on college campuses by imple-\nmenting and enforcing policies that support recovery-ori-\nented and other programs that discourage substance\nmisuse.\nThe creation and implementation of college alcohol and\ngambling policies is far from an exact science. Currently,\nthere are no standardized scientific guidelines for the cre-\nation of school policy directed toward alcohol and other\npotentially addictive behaviors (e.g., gambling). How-\never, science can contribute to the creation of successful\npolicy. Recognizing the important role that science can\nplay in the development and evaluation of public policy,\nthe federal government recently released draft \"regulatory\nscience\" guidelines [7]. The Office of Management and\nBudget (OMB) intends these guidelines to direct and\ninform public agencies in the creation and implementa-\ntion of effective and targeted regulations. Science-based\nguidelines also could prove useful to policymaking on\ncollege campuses; however, as the results of this study will\nreveal, college administrators do not use empirical evi-\ndence to guide the development and implementation of\nstudent substance use and gambling regulations. This sit-\nuation has led to disjunctive policy strategies among U.S.\ncolleges.\nThe purpose of this study is to encourage the development\nof science guided school policy. To accomplish this goal,\nwe will examine the prevalence and characteristics of alco-\nhol- and gambling-related policies, including policy pro-\nvisions for student recovery, in a scientifically selected\nsample of U.S. colleges. We will not include illicit drug\npolicies in this analysis because illicit drug use is illegal for\nboth adults and young people; these illegal behaviors fall\nunder the purview of state and federal law that supersedes\ncollege policy. Our intent is to examine college policies\nthat focus on legal activities. Therefore, using college alco-\nhol and gambling policies, binge drinking rates and gam-\nbling frequency as evidence, this report describes the\nepidemiology (e.g., prevalence) and influence of these\nassorted policies.\nFilling the Policy Void: A Federal Drug and Alcohol\nInitiative\nDuring 1989, the federal government initiated basic alco-\nhol and substance abuse education requirements. Previ-\nously, there was not a regulatory mandate obligating\ninstitutions of higher learning to set alcohol or drug use\npolicy or bring students' attention to these rules if they\nexisted. Schools also were not required to disseminate\nsubstance use policy information to parents or other inter-\nested parties. This situation changed with the passage of\nthe federal Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act\nThe DFSCA applies to all U.S. colleges. The act specifies\nthat \"as a condition of receiving funds or any other form\nof financial assistance under any Federal program, an\ninstitution of higher education (IHE) must certify that it\nhas adopted and implemented a drug [and alcohol] pre-\nvention program...\"[8]. Thus, any U.S. college that does\nnot maintain a drug and alcohol education program risks\nlosing all of its federal funding. In addition, to fulfil\nDFSCA requirements and retain funding, schools must\nprovide students with institutional standards of conduct\nthat explicitly prohibit illicit drugs and illegal alcohol use,\na description of potential legal and institutional sanctions\nfor substance use violations, a description of health risks\nposed by drugs and alcohol, and a listing of available\ntreatment options.\nThe Impact of Government Policy on College Campus\nSubstance Use and Abuse is Unknown\nThe overall impact of mandated drug and alcohol pro-\ngrams is still unknown; as we noted before, there is some\nevidence that risky and addictive behaviors on college\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ncampuses are still prevalent despite targeted efforts by\nadministrators to reduce student substance abuse [9,6].\nSeveral studies have suggested that, despite prevention\nefforts, established norms of excessive drinking behavior\nand positive student attitudes regarding the effects of alco-\nhol consumption continue to encourage alcohol con-\nsumption on college campuses [10,11]. The absence of\nuniversal standards governing the content of school poli-\ncies on addiction might contribute to this problem.\nAlthough the DFSCA mandates that schools must make\nwritten drug and alcohol policy available to students on\nan annual basis, administrators at each institution still\ndetermine the content of such policy. Thus, the DFSCA\nmandates policy without establishing standards for con-\ntent; as a result, administrative tolerance toward alcohol,\ndrugs, and gambling can vary significantly from institu-\ntion to institution.\nThe Potential Effect of Inconsistent College Policies\nInconsistent policy content among institutions can create\na problematic state of affairs. Although DFSCA directives\naim to increase awareness of the potential dangers of alco-\nhol and drug use among students, numerous studies con-\ntinue to identify high levels of alcohol abuse on U.S.\nsodic drinking adversely affects not only those students\nwho actively participate, but also those who do not: one\nstudy identified non-heavy drinkers on heavy drinking\ncampuses as 3.6 times as likely to experience at least one\nproblem from another student's drinking as non-heavy\ndrinkers on non-heavy drinking campuses [15].\nEven though individual colleges have adopted different\nstrategies for reducing the problems associated with exces-\nsive alcohol consumption, the extent and effect of these\nefforts are largely unknown. One approach, perhaps in\nresponse to DFSCA, has been to develop and enforce pol-\nicies on student substance abuse and recovery. Although\nrecent psychosocial programs attempting to reduce stu-\ndent drinking behaviors have failed to reduce binge drink-\ning [6], official school policies on substance abuse and\nrecovery hold the potential to reduce students' alcohol use\nand the multitude of consequential problems associated\nwith drinking excessively. This potential, however, is\nlikely contingent upon policy content: because there are\nfew federal regulations governing the content of alcohol\npolicies at institutions of higher learning, every college\ndevelops unique strategies of combating potentially\naddictive behaviors. To date, no studies have examined\nthe policy content of a representative sample of colleges in\nthe attempt to identify the effects of these policies on lev-\nels of alcohol and gambling involvement among students.\nPolicy and Recovery\nStudents who seek help for alcohol or other substance use\nproblems are faced with a multitude of school-provided\nand external treatment options. Addiction recovery pro-\ngrams are diverse, ranging from formal treatment pro-\ngrams (e.g., inpatient medical treatment and outpatient\npsychotherapy) to less formal self-help options, (e.g., 12-\nstep fellowships) [16]. Regardless of the selected type of\ntreatment, attention to recovery from addiction requires\nsignificant time and determination, which can disrupt a\nschedule of college studies. Twelve-step programs, for\nexample, usually involve attending regular, perhaps even\ndaily meetings. Formal treatment programs frequently\ndemand an even greater level of time commitment: in-\npatient detoxification or other residential care can remove\nstudents from the academic environment altogether.\nMandatory abstinence, required by most treatment pro-\ngrams, poses an additional hurdle to treatment-seekers.\nStudents, with their busy and often stressful schedules,\nundoubtedly face additional challenges in participating in\nrecovery activities; academic and administrative policies\nthat accommodate flexible scheduling will likely assist\nstudents seeking recovery, and policies that do not might\ncomplicate or inhibit students' recovery efforts.\nCollege Binge Drinking and School Policy\nBinge drinking, the consumption of five or more alcoholic\ndrinks (four or more for women) on at least one occasion\nat one to two week intervals [12], has been unaffected by\nprohibitive and punitive college policies. To illustrate, on\none college campus that prohibited all alcohol use in its\nresidence halls, there was virtually no difference in the\nbinge drinking rate among students living within areas\nregulated by the alcohol policy (35%) compared to those\nliving outside the jurisdiction of the alcohol policy (34%)\n[17]. Although school policy (or the lack thereof) is not\nthe only factor that affects binge drinking rates \u00ad promo-\ntions aimed at students, cheap alcohol prices at surround-\ning establishments and high numbers of on- and off-\ncampus drinking venues have been found to significantly\nincrease student binge drinking [18] \u00ad placing special\nemphasis on the enforcement of substance abuse policies\ncan garner positive results. For example, Knight\ndiluted by considerable variation in policy content among\npublic colleges in a state-wide system, increased enforce-\nment (i.e., application of policy consequences) of alcohol\npolicies aimed at combating underage drinking did result\nin decreased alcohol consumption among students. Bene-\nficial effects resulting from the enforcement of existing\nrules, however, can be difficult to interpret. For example,\nin that study, it is unclear whether the enforcement of\nrules encouraged lower levels of drinking or entry to treat-\nment for intemperate drinking or, alternatively, simply\nforced problematic drinkers to withdraw from school.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nCollege Gambling and School Policy\nSome research suggests that gambling on college cam-\npuses is commonplace. A study of student gambling at six\ncolleges in five different states (i.e., New York, New Jersey,\nNevada, Oklahoma, and Texas) showed that of 1,771 sur-\nveyed students, 23% reported that they gambled at least\nweekly (ranging from 11% in Texas to 39% in Nevada)\n[20]. In that study, students reported whether they had\never experienced gambling-related problems as identified\nby the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) [21]. Of the\ntotal student sample, 5.5% were classified as lifetime\nprobable pathological gamblers. The prevalence of life-\ntime pathological gamblers among these students ranged\nfrom 4% in Nevada to 8% in New York. A recent report\n[22] of a four-campus Connecticut college system\nreported a similar SOGS-based prevalence estimate of\nprobable pathological gamblers (i.e., 5.2%).\nFor comparison, the National Gambling Impact Study\nCommission (NGISC) considered the adult rates of life-\ntime pathological gambling from four sources [3]. The\nlowest rates were 0.8% for both the University of Michi-\ngan [23] and National Opinion Research Center [24]\nstudies; the largest (i.e., 1.5% \u00ad 1.6%) were from aggre-\ngated statistics of previously published research con-\nducted by the National Research Council [25] and the\noriginal analysis of the same studies by the Harvard Med-\nical School [26]. This meta-analysis included 14 SOGS-\nbased studies of disordered gambling among college stu-\ndents and indicated that the lifetime prevalence of patho-\nlogical gambling among college students was 5.1% [26].\nAn update of this meta-analysis expanded the number of\nstudent studies to 19 and increased the prevalence esti-\n7.6% [1]. Based on 66 studies of the general household\npopulation in various areas (i.e., states), this estimate of\nthe proportion of college students with gambling disor-\nders was three times the adult rate (1.9%).\nOther research contradicts the findings that college stu-\ndents are at elevated risk for problem gambling compared\nto the general adult population. For example, a recently\npublished longitudinal study of students at the University\nof Missouri-Columbia showed markedly lower prevalence\nrates than the studies summarized above [27]. In this lon-\ngitudinal study, no student met the traditional criteria for\nproblem or pathological gambling. Further, the authors\nnote that, \"there were too few participants endorsing mul-\ntiple gambling problems at a single time point to obtain\nan adequate sample size of affected individuals for most\nthese students endorsed a single problem at any point\nduring their lifetime due to gambling; one student\nendorsed two problems and all of the others reported\nnever having had a problem due to gambling. At the next\ninterview three years later, when most subjects were sen-\niors, the subjects reported more symptoms; but only one\nsubject (i.e., 0.2% of the sample) endorsed enough symp-\ntoms to meet the diagnostic criteria of the American Psy-\nchiatric Association [28] for lifetime pathological\ngambling. This evidence indicates that gambling behavior\namong students and its adverse consequences fluctuates\nwith time and other factors and that the development of\nsymptoms is not always progressive. Further, the Slutske\nresults show that most adverse effects of student gambling\nremain sub-clinical, making this pattern more responsive\nto interventions than longer standing, more entrenched\nclinical disorders. Taken together, this evidence suggests\nthat comprehensive college gambling policies might have\nthe capacity to reduce the adverse consequences that can\nbe associated with student gambling.\nDespite the frequency with which college students engage\nin gambling activities, some evidence suggests that\nadministrators are unaware of the dangers associated with\nexcessive gambling among students; in addition, colleges\ndo not have adequate policies addressing gambling [29].\nThis situation prompted Shaffer to suggest that the gov-\nernment convene \"a consortium of college presidents to\nreview their existing gambling related policies and prob-\nlems so that we can take a systematic approach to the edu-\ncation, prevention and treatment of America's young\npeople, who are at higher risk for gambling related disor-\nders than their adult counterparts\"[30]. Although this\nconsortium has not yet been assembled, research con-\nfirms that college students continue to view gambling as a\nlegitimate form of entertainment; for example, 42% of a\nscientifically selected sample having gambled at least once\nin the last year [31]. Unlike drug and alcohol education\n(i.e., DFSCA), there is no federal mandate requiring\nschools to educate students or parents about the dangers\nof excessive gambling; combined with the lack of a policy\nresponse by administrators, this situation leaves an open\ndoor for student-related gambling disorders to emerge\nunchecked.\nAssessing the Relationships between College Policies and\nStudent Drinking and Gambling\nThis study is the first to identify patterns of drinking and\ngambling-related rulemaking on college campuses (e.g.,\npunitive versus recovery oriented). By relating school pol-\nicies to known school rates of drinking or gambling [31,6]\nwe can identify potentially influential policies. These\nanalyses can encourage and inform the development of\nguidelines, or \"best practices,\" upon which schools can\nbase future policy.\nHypotheses\nGiven the paucity of empirical college-based policy\nresearch, this study will fill an important gap in\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nknowledge. To fill this void, this research will test a variety\nof addiction-related hypotheses that have not yet been\nexamined empirically. Based upon the extant literature,\nthis study will test the following four primary hypotheses:\n\u00b7 Because there are few requirements guiding the creation\nof school substance use and gambling policies, the con-\ntent and clarity of these policies will be heterogeneous\nacross schools and modes of policy distribution (e.g.,\nhandbooks vs. school Web sites);\n\u00b7 College alcohol policies currently devote relatively little\nattention to student recovery;\n\u00b7 Due to differences in enforcement, awareness of the\ndangers of excessive alcohol consumption, educational\nprograms and types of students, schools with either no or\nonly restrictive alcohol use policies will experience higher\nlevels of binge drinking among students than schools with\nprohibitive and recovery-oriented alcohol policies;\n\u00b7 Absent a federal mandate that requires gambling-related\nregulations or education on college campuses, gambling\npolicies will be less prevalent than alcohol use policies.\nMethods\nProcedure: Sample, Policy Eligibility and Policy Selection\nThe purpose of this study is to identify and assess alcohol\nand gambling policies among U.S. colleges. To ensure a\nrepresentative national sample of colleges, we examined\nthe scientifically selected sample of public and private\nAmerican colleges that was used in a recent series of Har-\nvard studies (e.g., Wechsler 2002 [6]). The detailed meth-\nods by which the previous study identified the sample are\nconsisted of 120 scientifically selected schools located\nthroughout the nation; one school ceased operation\nbefore the start of the study, so 119 schools were eligible\nto be included in the final sample. We received human\nsubjects approval for this study through the Harvard Med-\nical School Office for Research Subject Protection. On\nHarvard Medical School granted an exemption for the\nstudy entitled: United States College and University Addiction\nand Recovery Policies. The study qualified for exemption\nunder 46 CFR \u00a7102(f) and the assurance identification\nAt the beginning of the project, we submitted an e-mail\nrequest for a hard copy of their student handbook to each\nschool's admissions office. Each e-mail specified that we\nwere interested in collecting school alcohol and gambling\npolicies and requested that our inquiry be forwarded to\nthe most appropriate school official. We gathered e-mail\naddresses for admissions offices from each school's offi-\ncial Web site. Using each school's main telephone number\nto initiate contact, investigators contacted schools that did\nnot respond within thirty days to our e-mail request and\nverbally requested a handbook and any other existing\nalcohol and gambling policy materials. Typically, the per-\nson answering the call referred us to admissions offices,\ndeans' offices, or student services offices for further assist-\nance; we identified ourselves as calling from Harvard\nMedical School only when asked.\nPolicy Eligibility and Identification\nEligibility Criteria\nTo be eligible for inclusion in this study, each college pol-\nicy had to meet the following five eligibility criteria:\n1. the policy had to prohibit, govern, or otherwise attempt\nto regulate alcohol use or gambling among students at a\nU.S. college or university;\n2. the policy had to be in effect (i.e., in the current hand-\nbook, Web site or supplementary materials);\n3. the policy had to be readily available to the public,\neither in electronic or hard copy;\n4. the policy had to be written in English;\n5. the policy had to be available for review by project\nIdentifying Policy\nOur primary source of alcohol and gambling policies was\neach school's student handbook. (For the purpose of this\nstudy, \"student handbook\" refers to the institution's pri-\nmary informational document made available to current\nand prospective students.) The student handbook is a cen-\ntralized forum for regulatory information and is a primary\nsource of official school policies for students and parents,\nas well as the public. In addition, the concept of a student\nhandbook is widespread, making handbooks a common\ninformation source across many schools. Many institu-\ntions distribute student handbooks to all incoming fresh-\nmen; therefore, most students are familiar and\ncomfortable with accessing the handbook. Student hand-\nbooks also are widely available to the public.\nWhen available, we used electronic versions (i.e., pdf or\nhtml) of each school's handbook; otherwise, we used a\nhard copy. Some schools, particularly large universities\nwith many departments and/or divisions, did not have a\nsingle handbook that they distributed to all students. In\nthese cases, we retrieved the school's policies from other\nofficial documents (e.g., code of conduct, policy manual,\njudicial procedures manual). Many schools also posted\npolicy information (i.e., separate from the handbook) on\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ntheir Web sites; we analyzed this information as a second-\nary source. We conducted an exhaustive search of each\nschool's Web site using each site's integrated search engine\nand used ",

Several sites did not\ninclude a search function; in such cases, we conducted a\ncomprehensive visual search of the site. We also examined\nsupplemental materials provided by schools (e.g., policy\nmanuals, brochures, pamphlets, etc.) for comparison\nagainst handbooks and Web-based materials. We con-\nducted a visual search of all hard-copy handbooks and\nsupplemental policy materials and extracted all relevant\ninformation from these sources.\nWe systematically archived all of the Web-based and other\nelectronic regulatory sources (e.g., pdf- and text-based stu-\ndent handbooks and policy manuals, html pages, etc.)\nfrom each school on a computer. We filed hard copy\nmaterials, such as student handbooks and policy manu-\nals, by school and kept these documents on site.\nPolicy Coding Procedure and Instrument\nInvestigators developed a coding instrument by studying\nalcohol and gambling policies from a variety of U.S.\nschools outside the current sample and identifying the\nunderlying characteristics of the policies. These character-\nistics were reduced to 40 items that reflected the scope and\nfocus of school alcohol and gambling policies. The items\nwere converted into a coding instrument that included 25\nvariables for alcohol policy and 15 variables for gambling\npolicy. This instrument included items to measure the\npresence of specific policies and establish whether the\npolicies were punitive or rehabilitative. All variables used\na nominal scale that included common characteristics of\neach school policy; response choices varied slightly with\nthe focus of each variable. All of the variables were\narranged on a six-page coding form.\nTo simplify coding and allow for within-school compari-\nsons between different formats of policy dissemination\n(e.g. school handbook vs. school Web site), we separated\neach school's policy materials into three categories: (1)\nstudent handbooks (electronic or paper); (2) Web-based\nmaterials; and (3) supplementary materials (paper); a\npotential 357 documents required coding (three coding\ntial documents). However, because not every school had\ndocuments available in all three coding categories, the\nfinal document count was 164. Specifically, at the end of\nour data collection process, we had collected 73 student\nhandbooks, 70 Web-based policies, and 21 supplemen-\ntary documents.\nWe assigned 11 coders the job of evaluating each school's\nalcohol and gambling policies. Each coder read a selection\nof policies and extracted relevant information in accord-\nance with the coding form. The coding process proceeded\nas follows:\n1. Each policy document was assigned to two of eleven eli-\ngible DOA coders randomly. Each assigned coder inde-\npendently abstracted information from each assigned\npolicy document and recorded this information on sepa-\nrate coding forms.\n2. For each document, one member of the research team,\ndesignated as the \"arbiter,\" compared the two coding\nforms and marked discrepant items.\n3. The arbiter returned the marked coding forms to their\nrespective coders and requested that coders reconsider\ntheir answers to the items in question. Upon reconsidera-\ntion, coders were free to change their answers or keep their\noriginal answers.\n4. Coders resubmitted their recoded documents to the\narbiter who compared the discrepant items again. Dis-\ncrepancies that remained were noted and resolved by the\narbiter.\n5. Once all discrepancies had been resolved, the policy\nassessments on the coding forms were entered into an\nSPSS database using a procedure that screened entries for\nout-of-range values and discrepancies in branching\namong items.\n6. We assessed data entry reliability by selecting 10% of\nthe cases in our database and rechecking each data entry\npoint. Of the 680 items entered in these 17 randomly\nselected cases, there were no observed data entry errors.\nShaffer and his associates have used a similar process of\ninformation extraction, coding and arbitration success-\nfully in other published studies [1,32].\nResults\nOur analysis of college alcohol and gambling policies gen-\nerated several types of results. First, we describe the results\nof our coding procedure, the final sample of schools and\navailable policy information. Next, we examine the policy\nevidence across information sources by analyzing the con-\nsistency between the information provided by handbooks\nand Web materials. We then present the prevalence of\nindividual policy items and the results of a factor analysis\nthat explored the underlying dimensions of the policy var-\niables. Finally, we analyze the relationships between poli-\ncies and student drinking and gambling rates using\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ninformation collected in the most recent Harvard School\nof Public Health College Alcohol Study (CAS) [6].\nInter-Coder Concordance\nWe assessed inter-coder reliability by comparing the total\nnumber of discrepant coded items to the total number of\ncoded items. As described previously, each policy was\nassigned to two of eleven eligible DOA coders randomly.\nThe participation of eleven coders yielded 55 possible\ncoding-pair combinations; each of these pairings coded at\nleast one policy. Specifically, the number of policies\ncoded by each coder-pair ranged from a minimum of one\n(n = 6) to a maximum of six (n = 3). Coders had up to two\nopportunities to code each document: (a) an initial round\nof coding; and (b) a second round of coding to reconsider\nany discrepant items identified by the arbiter after the ini-\ntial round of coding. The arbiter made the final coding\ncoding process yielded a study-wide inter-coder reliability\nCollege Sample\nAfter thirty days had passed from our initial e-mail\nrequest, 46 of 119 schools had responded by sending hard\ncopy materials. Eighteen of these 46 colleges sent materi-\nals completely unrelated to our request for school alcohol\npolicies (e.g., applications for admission, school newslet-\nters). Fourteen schools sent student handbooks, and\nanother 14 schools sent other alcohol and/or gambling\nrelated (i.e., non-handbook) materials. Seventy-three\nschools did not respond to our request within thirty days.\nSubsequent to our follow-up telephone requests, we\nreceived student handbooks and supplemental materials\nfrom an additional 22 schools. This recruitment proce-\ndure resulted in 50 schools actively providing policy infor-\nmation for this study; for the remainder, policy\ninformation was obtained through other investigative\nprocedures as described earlier (e.g., Web sites).\nPolicy Sample\nThis study sought information on alcohol and gambling\npolicy from a representative sample of 119 colleges across\nthe U.S. We utilized three distinct common sources of\ninformation on school alcohol policy: student hand-\nbooks, school Web sites (non-handbook related) and sup-\nplementary materials (e.g., policy manuals, pamphlets).\nWe collected a total of 164 policy-related documents from\nthree sources: 73 policy documents from handbooks, 70\ndocuments from school Web sites, and 21 from supple-\nmentary materials. Table 1 presents the sources of alcohol\npolicy information for the schools in our sample. Forty\nschools presented their full alcohol policy in their hand-\nbook, 31 on their Web site, 2 in supplementary materials,\nand 44 through a combination of handbook, Web site\nand supplements. We were unable to locate any policy\ninformation for two schools in our sample; these schools\ndid not respond to our requests for information.\nPolicy across Information Sources\nWe aggregated and analyzed policy information across\nsources because a preliminary examination revealed con-\ntent differences among handbooks, Web sites [33] and\nsupplementary materials. Aggregating information across\nsources provides the most extensive view of each college's\npolicy strategy because it considers all modes of policy\ndistribution. This strategy yields the most comprehensive\npolicy search and identifies more policy mentions than is\npossible by examining only one policy source. To imple-\nment this strategy, we first constructed a new database that\nincluded data for schools with a handbook, a Web site or\nTable 1: Sources of school alcohol policy information\nNumber of Schools Handbook Policies Web site Policies Supplemental Materials No materials\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nboth (n = 115). Next we created a single record of policy\nmentions for the 28 schools with both handbooks and\nWeb materials by aggregating policies across sources. This\ndatabase assimilated the unique handbook and Web var-\niables into a single set of \"recompiled\" variables, reflect-\ning the total number of policies attributable to either the\nhandbook or the Web. To compare the \"added value\" of\nschool Web sites (i.e., policy information presented on\nthe Web that was not presented in the handbook), we\nsummed the policies reflected by the recompiled variables\nand then subtracted the policies contained in the hand-\nbook-only variables. Of 263 total policy items present, we\ncollected 198 (75%) policy items from student hand-\nbooks and 65 (25%) additional policy items from school\nWeb sites that were not available in handbooks.\nTo determine the added contribution of supplemental\nmaterials (i.e., policy information presented in the sup-\nplements that was unavailable elsewhere), we created\nanother set of recompiled variables following the previ-\nously outlined procedure. These variables reflected the\ntotal number of policies identified for the three schools\nwith all three types of sources (i.e., handbooks, Web mate-\nrials and supplements). We summed the policies reflected\nby the recompiled variables and then subtracted the poli-\ncies contributed by handbooks and Web sources; this pro-\ncedure revealed that supplemental materials contributed\nAlthough school Web sites provide a substantial amount\nof alcohol policy information that is not contained in the\nprimary document customarily provided to students (i.e.,\nhandbook), the overall added contribution of the school\nWeb site in presenting policy information varied among\nschools. For example, one school's Web site contained an\nadditional eight alcohol regulations that were not\nincluded in the handbook; however, several schools' sites\ncontained no additional information. In addition, the\ntype of information that was presented only on Web sites\nalso varied: while most information pertained mainly to\nsecondary alcohol policies (e.g., school-sponsored events\nand drinking regulations for drinking-aged students),\nsome schools chose to present vital alcohol policy infor-\nmation (e.g., stating that all drinking is prohibited for stu-\ndents <21) on their Web site only (n = 2). Thus, although\nhandbooks and Web sites are both important sources of\nalcohol policy information and supplements contribute\nlittle additional information, consistency across sources\nvaries. The following analyses assess the agreement of\ninformation found in multiple sources.\nHandbook-Web Concordance\nAs mentioned earlier, of the 117 colleges for which we had\ndent alcohol consumption and 26 schools (22%) had a\nstudent gambling policy. Because all schools had a written\nalcohol policy (and relatively few schools had a gambling\npolicy), the following analyses focus on alcohol policies.\nDetermining concordance between handbook and Web\nsources is important because administrators might be\nunaware of inconsistencies between official school docu-\nments. In addition, contradictory information can mis-\nlead students and potential applicants. We assessed the\nconcordance between sources of college alcohol policy\nmaterials by determining the level of agreement (i.e., pres-\nence or absence of policy information) between hand-\nbooks and Web materials; that is, we compared the\ncontent of each type of document to identify differences\nin the presentation of each school's policy information\nbetween sources. We did not extend this particular analy-\nsis to include supplemental materials because, as we\nnoted before, only a small number of schools (n = 3) had\nall three types of sources.\nTwenty-eight schools had both a handbook and Web\nmaterials; for each of these 28 schools we determined the\nabsence or presence of the 25 alcohol policy variables in\neach source. We predetermined that a concordance rate of\n85% would indicate a high level of agreement between\ndocuments. To be considered in agreement, complemen-\ntary information had to be found in (or absent from) both\nsources; in cases where this requirement was not satisfied,\nthe policies were considered in disagreement. Using these\ncriteria, we determined that three policy variables (i.e.,\n12% of the policy variables) were mentioned often and\nwere present in both handbooks and on Web sites, and\nconsequently, showed high agreement. Either type of\ninformation resource seldom mentioned ten policy varia-\nbles (i.e., 40% of the policy variables), therefore, also\nexhibiting high agreement. The remaining 12 policy vari-\nables (i.e., 48% of the policy variables) were often men-\ntioned, but not consistently by both sources, indicating\nlow agreement.\nTable 2 presents the three \"high agreement\" alcohol poli-\ncies that were mentioned consistently in both handbooks\nand Web materials. Variables that fell into this category\ngenerally measured broad school policies (i.e., the exist-\nence of an alcohol policy). As Table 2 illustrates, schools\nconsistently made these types of alcohol policies available\nto the public in both print and electronic form, making\nthis information highly accessible.\nPolicy variables that were rarely mentioned in handbooks\nand Web materials appear in Table 3. These variables pri-\nmarily measured on- and off- campus alcohol consump-\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ntion restrictions and school recovery polices regarding\nstudent alcohol use. These policies are in \"high agree-\nment,\" because they were seldom mentioned: as Table 3\ndemonstrates, this information was missing from hand-\nbooks and Web sites in nearly all cases.\nTable 4 presents variables that were mentioned occasion-\nally (i.e., concordance <85%) in handbooks or Web mate-\nrials. The policies in this category primarily address\nconsumption and event restrictions and student recovery.\nTable 4 illustrates that we observed considerable\ninconsistencies in schools' methods of distribution of\nthese types of policies.\nIdentifying the Underlying Dimensions of College Policy\nAs noted earlier, the coding process revealed that all 117\ncolleges (i.e., 100% of the schools for which information\nwas available) in this sample had a written policy on stu-\nTable 2: \"High Agreement\" Alcohol Policies, Often Mentioned in Both School Handbooks and Web Materials (N = 28)\nPolicy % of schools, HB only % of schools, Web site\nonly\n% of schools, HB and\nWeb site\n% of schools, no\nmention in HB or Web\nsite\nAlcohol is prohibited on\ncampus for students <21\nAlcohol is allowed at\nsanctioned events for\nTable 3: \"High Agreement\" Policy Variables, Rarely Mentioned in School Handbooks and Web Materials (N = 28)\nPolicy % of schools, HB only % of schools, Web site\nonly\n% of schools, HB and\nWeb site\n% of schools, no\nmention in HB or Web\nsite\nAlcohol is prohibited off-\ncampus for students  21\nAlcohol quantity limits at\noff-campus events\nPolicy on container\nrestrictions at off-campus\nevents\nPolicy on leave of absence\nfor recovery\nPolicy allowing students to\nparticipate in recovery\nwhile living in dorm\nAttendance restrictions for\nhosted events\nPolicy on students with an\nalcohol problem upon\nentering school\nPolicy on students who\ndevelop an alcohol\nproblem while in school\nPolicy on students already\nin recovery upon entry to\nschool\nPolicy on students who\nenter recovery while in\nschool\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ndent alcohol consumption, but only 26 (22%) had a pub-\nlished policy that addressed gambling. The small number\nof schools with gambling policies precludes confident\nanalysis of the dimensional composition of our gambling\nvariables; therefore, we applied the factor analysis that fol-\nlows only to alcohol policy variables.\nThree policy variables represented a multi-dimensional\nmeasurement strategy to yield detailed policy informa-\ntion. Consequently, we collapsed these three redundant\npolicy items into the primary or gate items from which\nthey originated (e.g., \"alcohol is prohibited on-campus\nfor students  21\" and \"on-campus alcohol restrictions in\nplace for students  21\" became \"policy on alcohol use\non-campus for students  21). This resulted in 22 alcohol\npolicy variables in all remaining analyses. These depend-\nent variables all measured different aspects of school alco-\nhol policies (e.g., policy presence, content, and target). To\nempirically examine the underlying dimensions reflected\nby our variables, we conducted an exploratory factor anal-\nysis. This procedure employed an initial factor extraction\n(i.e., component matrix) and then an orthogonal rotation\nto simple structure. We selected the Varimax rotation to\nmaximize the variance of loadings within factors and min-\nimize the covariance across factors. The orthogonal\nsolution identified eight policy clusters with Eigenvalues\nvariation. This explained variance lies within the 50\u00ad75%\nConsequently, we concluded that our factor analysis pro-\nvided a valid identification of the policy clusters that\nunderlie college alcohol and gambling regulations.\nTable 5 presents the structure of the interrelationships\namong policies. To facilitate interpretation, the table\nTable 4: \"Low Agreement\" Policy Variables, Mentioned Inconsistently in School Handbooks and Web Materials (N = 28)\nPolicy % of schools, HB only % of schools, Web site\nonly\n% of schools, HB and\nWeb site\n% of schools, no\nmention in HB or Web\nsite\nAlcohol is prohibited on-\ncampus for students  21\nOff-campus alcohol\nrestrictions in place for\nSchool policy is to defer to\nlocal laws on alcohol\nconsumption\nPolicy on alcohol quantity\nlimits at events\nAttendance restrictions for\nschool sanctioned events\nCampus operates an\nalcohol recovery program\nPolicy on alcohol-free\ncampus housing\nDocument makes clear\nother ways by which the\nschool makes students\naware of the official alcohol\npolicy\nPolicy on container\nrestrictions on campus\nCampus makes referrals to\noff-campus recovery\nprograms\nOn-campus alcohol\nrestrictions in place for\nPolicy on alcohol at on-\ncampus sanctioned events\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nreports only factor loadings  0.50 (i.e., policies with\nloadings in this range correlate .50 or greater with a com-\nposite measure of the overall dimension).\nThe eight factors are ordered according to the number of\npolicies measuring the overall domain; that is, factors\ncontaining general, or \"blanket,\" policy items are listed\nfirst, followed by factors containing more specific policy\nitems. Factor 1 (i.e., School policy and the law) contained\nthe total variance. Many schools deferred to local law\nentirely and did not publish other policies that were\nunique to the school. Factor 1 identifies this deference\npolicy as a unique dimension. Factor 2 (i.e., Prohibition\npolicies) expands on deference to local law and presents\nadditional school policies that prohibit alcohol for under-\nage and legal age students. These items accounted for\n5.43% of the total variance. Factor 3 includes policies that\nextend restrictions to include drinking by students of legal\nage (i.e., Policies for legal-aged drinkers). Items in Factor 3\ninclude alcohol policies that focus on the legal status (i.e.,\nlegal age) of students; in addition, for those of legal age,\nthese policies range from no school specific policies to\nprohibitions for students who are old enough to drink\nlegally.\nFactors 4 through 6 include policy variables directed to\nalcohol use on-campus and off-campus. Factor 4 (i.e.,\nLimits and restrictions \u00ad on campus) provides specific guid-\nance about where on-campus students can drink and how\nmuch alcohol is available (i.e., housing and container and\nquantity restrictions); these items accounted for 9.13% of\nthe total variance. Factor 5 policies (i.e., Events policies)\naccounted for 7.20% of the total variance and focus pri-\nmarily on restrictions for on- and off-campus events. Fac-\ntor 6 (i.e., Limits and restrictions \u00ad off campus) accounted\nfor 13.50% of the total variance and includes policies that\nregulate off-campus activities (i.e., alcohol quantities,\ncontainers and leaves of absence).\nTable 5: Orthogonal Factor Structure and Items Loading  0.50 on Each Factor\nVariable Factor\nLoading\n% Variance\nExplained\nFactor 1 \u00ad School policy and the law 4.83\nDoes the school alcohol policy defer in full to local law? .88\nDoes the policy state that alcohol is prohibited for students <21? .85\nDoes the policy state that alcohol is restricted on-campus for students  21? .76\nFactor 3 \u00ad Policies for legal-aged drinkers 6.65\nIs alcohol is allowed at sanctioned on-campus events for students  21? .75\nIs alcohol prohibited off-campus for students  21? .74\nFactor 4 \u00ad Limits and restrictions \u00ad on-campus 9.13\nDoes the policy state whether the school offers alcohol-free campus housing? .77\nDoes the policy address alcohol container restrictions on campus? .74\nDoes the policy address alcohol quantity limits (i.e., total alcohol available) at on-campus sanctioned events? .57\nAre there attendance restrictions for off-campus sanctioned events? .81\nAre there attendance restrictions for on-campus sanctioned events? .78\nAre there restrictions on off-campus alcohol use for students  21? .56\nFactor 6 \u00ad Limits and restrictions \u00ad off-campus 13.50\nIs there policy on alcohol quantity limits (i.e., total alcohol available) at off-campus sanctioned events? .81\nIs there policy on alcohol container restrictions off-campus? .79\nIs there policy that permits students a leave of absence to participate in a recovery program? .50\nIs there policy on students who enter alcohol recovery while attending? .90\nIs there policy on students who are in alcohol recovery upon entry? .88\nIs there policy on students who have an alcohol problem upon entry? .87\nIs there policy on students who develop an alcohol problem after entry? .79\nIs there policy that permits students in an alcohol recovery program to live in a dormitory on campus? .73\nDoes the campus makes referrals to an off-campus recovery program for students with alcohol use disorders? .74\nDoes the campus operate a recovery program for students with alcohol use disorders? .73\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nDifferent from the first 6 factors, factors 7 and 8 focus on\nstudent recovery. Factor 7 policies (i.e., Recovery recogni-\ntion policies) recognize that students can have alcohol\nrelated problems that require recovery, and that these\nproblems can exist before entering college or develop dur-\ning college; these items accounted for 20.59% of the total\nvariance in the data. Finally, Factor 8 (i.e., Recovery facili-\ntation) accounted for 5.03% of the total variance and\nincludes policies that reflect how the school participates\nin the recovery process (i.e., triage or treatment). One item\n(i.e., \"how does the campus inform students of the official\nschool policy\") failed to load  0.50 on any factor and was\nexcluded from the final analysis.\nAlcohol Policy Prevalence\nCollege alcohol policies varied widely. Table 6 summa-\nrizes the prevalence of alcohol-related policy and the\nmean prevalence of alcohol policies within each factor.\nThe prevalence of alcohol policies ranged from 100%\n(i.e., the presence of an alcohol use policy) to 1.7% (i.e.,\npolicy that permits a leave of absence to participate in a\nrecovery program). The mean prevalence for the eight pol-\nicy factors ranged from 92.3% (i.e., Prohibition policies) to\n5.4% (i.e., Limits and restrictions-off-campus).\nPolicy, Binge Drinking and Gambling\nWe conducted several analyses to determine the nature of\nrelationships between student alcohol consumption,\ngambling behavior and policy content. As the factor anal-\nysis above illustrates and the relative prevalence of poli-\ncies confirms, college alcohol-related policies are\nprimarily intended to prevent, reduce or restrict alcohol\nuse among students on college campuses. To test the rela-\ntionships between alcohol policies and student drinking\nbehaviour, we compared the mean binge drinking rates of\nstudents at schools with and without each policy variable.\nTable 6: Prevalence of College Alcohol Policies and Policy Attributes\nPolicy & Policy Attributes Prevalence % (N)\nPolicy addresses alcohol at sanctioned on-campus events for students  21 68.4 (80)\nCampus makes referrals to an off-campus recovery program for students with alcohol use disorders 57.3 (67)\nPolicy addresses alcohol container restrictions on-campus 50.4 (59)\nPolicy makes clear how the campus informs students of the official school alcohol policy 43.6 (51)\nCampus operates a recovery program for students with alcohol use disorders 28.2 (33)\nSchool alcohol policy defers in full to local law 26.5 (31)\nPolicy addresses alcohol quantity limits (i.e., total alcohol available) at on-campus sanctioned events 26.5 (31)\nSchool offers alcohol-free campus housing 22.2 (26)\nAttendance restrictions for on-campus sanctioned events 20.5 (24)\nPolicy on students who develop an alcohol problem after entry 10.3 (12)\nPolicy on alcohol quantity limits (i.e., total alcohol available) at off-campus sanctioned events 8.5 (10)\nPolicy on students who enter alcohol recovery while attending 7.7 (9)\nAttendance restrictions for off-campus sanctioned events 7.7 (9)\nPolicy on students who are in alcohol recovery upon entry 6.0 (7)\nPolicy on alcohol container restrictions off-campus 6.0 (7)\nPolicy permits students in an alcohol recovery program to live in a dormitory on campus 5.1 (6)\nPolicy on students who have an alcohol problem upon entry 3.4 (4)\nAlcohol is prohibited off-campus for students  21 3.4 (4)\nPolicy permits students a leave of absence to participate in a recovery program 1.7 (2)\nPolicy Factor Mean Prevalence (%)\nFactor 3 \u00ad Policies for legal-aged drinkers 35.9\nFactor 4 \u00ad Limits and restrictions \u00ad on-campus 33.0\nFactor 1 \u00ad School policy and the law 26.5\nFactor 7 \u00ad Recovery recognition policies 6.5\nFactor 6 \u00ad Limits and restrictions \u00ad off-campus 5.4\nRecovery-oriented policy;  Recovery-oriented factor\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nWe obtained the mean binge drinking rates of the schools\nin our sample from the dataset used in Wechsler et al.'s\nHarvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study\n(CAS)[6]. Because this is one of the first studies of college\npolicies, we sought to identify as many potential relation-\nships between policy, drinking and gambling as possible;\ntherefore we set a liberal alpha level ( = .1) for this anal-\nysis. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed\nthat four of the 22 policy variables had significant\nrelationships with binge drinking rates at the colleges in\nour sample (see Table 7).\nSchools that had either no policy restrictions or a prohibi-\ntion policy for on-campus alcohol use by students  21\nhad lower mean past-month student binge drinking rates\n(39% and 36%, respectively) compared to schools that\nemployed an intermediate level of restrictive policies\nallowed or did not mention alcohol use at on-campus\nsanctioned events for students  21 had a higher mean\nbinge drinking rate (46% and 44%, respectively) than\nschools that prohibited legal drinking at events (33%) (F\nfree housing had a higher mean student binge drinking\nrate of 49% compared to schools that did not mention\nalcohol-free housing which had a binge rate of 42% (F =\nbles evidenced significant relationships with student\nbinge drinking behaviors, but these policies lacked wide-\nspread implementation at a large number of schools.\nSchools that specifically allowed a leave of absence for a\nstudent to participate in recovery activities (n = 2) evi-\ndenced a higher mean binge drinking rate (69%) than\nschools that did not mention such a policy (43%, n =\n114).

Using prevalence data\ngambling behavior, we determined that no significant dif-\nference in mean past-year student gambling behavior\nexisted between schools with a written policy on gam-\nbling (i.e., prohibitive or restrictive) and schools with no\nmention of gambling policy (i.e., approximately 40%\nregardless of policy presence).\nUnanticipated Policy Effects: Alcohol Policy can Influence\nGambling Participation\nLong ago, Pigou [35] noted that public policies can have\nunanticipated effects; policy intended to regulate one set\nof behaviors can influence other patterns of behavior. To\ntest the relationships between alcohol policies and stu-\ndent gambling behavior, we compared the mean past-year\ngambling rate at schools with each alcohol policy to\nschools without the policy. As before, we used a liberal\nalpha ( = .1) to identify all potential relationships. A\none-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that four\nof the 22 alcohol policy variables had significant relation-\nships with the proportion of students who gambled in the\npast-year school year (see Table 8).\nSchools that restricted or prohibited on-campus alcohol\nuse for students over 21 evidenced similar mean past-year\nstudent gambling participation rates (i.e., 40% and 41%,\nrespectively), and schools with no restrictive policy evi-\nTable 7: Mean Binge Drinking Rates (%) and Alcohol Policy Variables\nPolicy variable Schools with\nno policy\nmention (N)\nSchools with\nno policy\nrestrictions (N)\nSchools with\nrestrictions\npolicy (N)\nSchools with\nprohibition\npolicy (N)\nF df\nPolicy on alcohol use on-campus for\nPolicy on alcohol at on-campus sanctioned\nevents for students  21\nPolicy on students already in recovery upon\nentry to school\nNo mention (N) Alcohol free housing available (N)\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ndenced a higher student gambling participation rate\nmention or allowed alcohol at on-campus events for legal\ndrinkers exhibited a higher mean gambling participation\nrate (i.e., 44% and 40%, respectively) than schools that\nprohibited alcohol at on-campus events (35%) (F = 5.17,\nthe quantity of alcohol available at events showed higher\npast-year gambling participation among students (42%)\ncompared to schools with no such provision (37%) (F =\nalcohol restrictions for legal-aged drinkers had a gambling\nrate of 38% while schools that did not had a mean gam-\nTwo other alcohol policy variables evidenced significant\nrelationships with student gambling behaviors, but these\npolicies were not widely implemented throughout the\nsample.

Every school in this representative sample\nhad at least one alcohol use policy; however, few schools\navailable. The relative rarity of gambling-related policies\non college campuses represents a lost opportunity by\nschool administrators to (a) prevent or limit disordered\ngambling among students and (b) facilitate recovery for\nstudents in need of gambling treatment. A recent study\nshowed that, while not as prevalent as previously thought,\ngambling on college campuses is still quite common, with\n42% of students having gambled in the past year and\n2.6% gambling weekly or more [31]. The frequency with\nwhich gambling occurs on college campuses could be\nTable 8: Mean Past-Year Student Gambling Participation Rate (%) and Alcohol Policy Variables\nPolicy variable Schools with no\npolicy mention\n(N)\nSchools with no\npolicy\nrestrictions (N)\nSchools with\nrestrictions\npolicy (N)\nSchools with\nprohibition\npolicy (N)\nF df\nPolicy on alcohol\nuse on-campus for\nPolicy on alcohol\nat on-campus\nsanctioned events\nNo mention (N) Limits (N)\nPolicy on alcohol\nquantity limits at\non-campus events\nPolicy on off-\ncampus alcohol\nrestrictions for\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nindicative of lingering misconceptions about gambling\noutcomes among student populations.

Future policy-based education\nand recovery initiatives might be able to effectively reduce\nstudent gambling behaviors; however, given the current\ndearth of gambling policies, we cannot determine\nwhether school policies can effectively reduce at-risk gam-\nbling behaviors on college campuses.\nAll the schools in our sample recognized the need for\nsome type of alcohol policy; however, the presence of\nmore targeted policies varied considerably. Although this\nvariation might reflect different policymaking strategies\nacross institutions, it also could result from a variety of\nother influences, including the lack of federal standards\nguiding the creation of alcohol policy on college cam-\npuses. The absence of policy guidelines leaves administra-\ntors with a wide range of options about how to best\naddress student substance use and abuse. Some adminis-\ntrators might prefer to match policy to their perception of\nlocal needs, while others might welcome policy guide-\nlines. Both of these circumstances encourage additional\nresearch designed to help guide administrators to identify\neffective policies (e.g., \"best practices\").\nAlcohol policies ranged from comprehensive restrictions\nand prohibition to liberal acceptance of student alcohol\nuse. Policies encouraging recovery among students with\nalcohol use disorders were decidedly absent from our\nsample. For example, only 57.3% of schools expressed in\nwriting that they made referrals to alcohol recovery serv-\nices; all other recovery-oriented policy provisions were in\nplace at fewer than 30% of schools, with two-thirds of\nthese policies in effect at fewer than 10% of schools.\nExamination of the mean prevalence of the eight policy\nfactors provides additional support for this finding. The\nmean prevalence of recovery recognition policies was\n6.5% (i.e., factor 7). Although recovery facilitation\npolicies were more common, with a mean prevalence of\n42.8% (i.e., factor 8), this rate simply reflects that many\nschools report making referrals to outside treatment facil-\nities. In contrast, the prevalence of prohibition policies\nwas 92.3% (i.e., factor 1). This limited of consideration\nfor student recovery and emphasis on punitive and pro-\nhibitive measures might reflect an underlying institu-\ntional bias against accommodating students with special\nneeds and an unsupportive atmosphere for those who are\nat most risk for developing alcohol problems. The higher\nprevalence of policies that direct referrals to outside treat-\nment resources might indicate an eagerness among\nadministrators to export students with addiction prob-\nlems to non-school affiliated assistance. Alternatively,\nplacing little emphasis on recovery might simply repre-\nsent a lack of understanding about addictive behaviors\nand addiction recovery among school administrators.\nEven though the results of this study indicate that schools\nwith recovery policies can evidence higher rates of binge\ndrinking, this rate might reflect a pre-existing campus\nproblem (i.e., policy as a consequence of behavior) rather\nthan be a result of recovery policy implementation. Future\npolicy research needs to examine whether a better balance\nbetween punishment and treatment policies will yield\nimproved student health services, less substance misuse\nand, consequently, a better campus life for all students.\nAs hypothesized, there were considerable and important\ndifferences between the information that was available in\nhandbooks and on the Web. This observation is not sur-\nprising because there are few requirements guiding the\ncreation of school substance use and gambling policies\nand no standards requiring consistency among sources.\nAlso, the factor analysis illustrated that alcohol policies\ncurrently concentrate primarily upon prevention and\npunishment, and devote relatively limited attention to\nstudent recovery. Finally, as we expected, schools with no\npolicy restrictions on alcohol consumption or restrictive\nalcohol policies often experienced higher levels of binge\ndrinking among students than schools with prohibitive\nalcohol policies. Nevertheless, alcohol policies were asso-\nciated inconsistently with student binge drinking rates;\nfew policy variables exerted influence on patterns of stu-\ndent drinking. In some cases, policies designed to reduce\nstudent alcohol consumption showed an opposite effect.\nAbsence of Shared Standards and Model Policies\nThe results of this policy analysis suggest diverse and per-\nhaps ambivalent tolerance toward alcohol use among U.S.\ncolleges that has led to a deep underlying problem: there\nis a lack of model policy guidelines to assist colleges in (a)\npreventing addictive behaviors among students and (b)\nproviding assistance to students already struggling with\naddiction. Optimally, if available, such guidelines would\nprovide school administrators with \"best practice\" model\npolicies that address the many aspects of addiction among\nstudents (e.g., permitted and prohibited substance use on\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ncampus, legal matters, parental notification, treatment\noptions, financial issues, academic issues, etc.) and would\noutline strategies for implementing and enforcing such\npolicies. In the absence of an explicit regulatory frame-\nwork (i.e., the current policy environment), schools are\nleft to regulate addictive behaviors based upon the local\nattitudes and expectations of communities and implicit\nmoral values held by school administrators. This circum-\nstance can lead colleges to install policies intended to\nhave immediate and drastic results (i.e., prevention and\npunishment policies) while neglecting policies that would\npromote recovery and provide lasting benefit to students.\nThe absence of evidence-based policy leaves school\nadministrators in a position of promulgating policy that\nmight have effects that are contrary to their intentions. For\nthat, \"Forty-seven Massachusetts colleges will sign onto a\nstatewide campaign today designed to punish students\nwho abuse alcohol and to cut down on the rate of binge\ndrinking on campuses by providing alcohol-awareness\ntraining for students, athletes, and Greek system mem-\nbers\"[43]. This type of policy imposes blind restrictions\nand punitive measures on students without considering\nthe underlying factors motivating student drinking (e.g.,\ncampus environment) or the need for specialized pro-\ngrams (e.g., recovery programs) to assist in reducing stu-\ndent drinking. Thus, even when colleges have existing\npolicies that address alcohol, drug use or gambling, it is\nlikely that the number of policies related to students\ninvolved with or seeking recovery programs is much more\nlimited. It is interesting to consider that colleges routinely\nprovide remedial courses in expository writing to help stu-\ndents cope with the demands of academics but resort to\nexclusion or punishment for students who fail to ade-\nquately cope with an academic environment where 44%\nof students binge drink [6].\nInconsistent Policy Presentation\nThe prevalence of alcohol-related problems at U.S. col-\nleges highlights the need for comprehensive student poli-\ncies addressing all aspects of alcohol use. Further, for\npolicy to be effective students need to be aware of and\nunderstand school requirements; this requires that stu-\ndents know how to access policy information. Because\nschools currently are not required to disseminate alcohol\npolicies in any particular form or through any specific\nmedium, the availability of existing policy information\ncan vary substantially among schools. Though most com-\nmonly printed in student handbooks, substance use poli-\ncies also appear in policy manuals, pamphlets and,\nincreasingly, on school Web sites. One recent study of col-\nlege Web-based alcohol policy information [33] found\nthat 50 of 52 schools included alcohol policy information\non their Web site; unfortunately, schools rarely consoli-\ndated this information onto a single Web page for easy\nviewing. The result was that alcohol policy information\nwas often incomplete and/or difficult to access [33].\nAlthough the Internet provides an excellent opportunity\nfor schools to reach technology-savvy students and par-\nents, individuals seeking policy information on the Web\nare likely to face disorganization and user-unfriendly\ndesigns. Thus, while students and parents might expect to\naccess alcohol or gambling policies by turning to a col-\nlege's student handbook or Web site, the results of this\nstudy suggest that their success in locating the desired\ninformation will vary considerably. Adoption of generally\naccepted standards for policy dissemination could\nincrease student awareness, and consequently, compli-\nance with college rules.\nTables 2 through 4 illustrate that schools present different\ntypes of alcohol policy information in their handbooks\nand Web sites; sometimes this information agrees across\nsources, and often it does not. For some policy variables,\nthis discrepancy is problematic. For example, most\nschools (82.1%) did not report on the presence or\nabsence of alcohol-free campus housing at all. It is diffi-\ncult to assess whether an absence of policy indicates a tacit\nacceptance of an activity (i.e., legal-aged alcohol con-\nsumption). More likely, however, it indicates that at these\nschools some drinking is permissible among students\nover age 21. For other policies, schools' lack of consistency\nin reporting uniform policy creates different problems.\nFor example, as Table 4 illustrates, handbooks and Web\nsites mislead people inquiring about on-campus alcohol-\nfree housing 25\u00ad50% of the time, at schools that have\nsuch a policy, depending upon the information source\n(i.e., handbook or Web site). Many schools (46.4%) did\nnot mention alcohol-free housing at all; it is unclear\nwhether these schools have alcohol-free on-campus hous-\ning, or simply lack an explicit policy addressing the\nmatter.\nThis study reveals that to gain a complete understanding\nof the components of a school's alcohol policy, it is neces-\nsary to consult both the handbook and the school Web\nsite whenever possible. However, schools do not alert stu-\ndents and parents to this fact, and it is unreasonable for\nschool administrators to expect inquiring persons to con-\nduct complex searches for information that is considered\nto be freely available in the public domain.\nPolicy Content: Prohibition, Punishment and Recovery\nThe results of the factor analysis provide a stark portrait of\nthe current composition of college policies on potentially\naddictive behaviors. This analysis reveals that six of eight\nfactors contained prohibitive and/or punitive policy vari-\nables. Although the factor analysis merely revealed the\nunderlying psychometric properties of our instrument,\nthe prevalence of specific policy variables across schools\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nprovides additional support for this finding. Whereas the\nresults suggest that prohibition-oriented policies have\nbeen effective in reducing binge drinking and gambling\nunder certain conditions, the relative scarcity of recovery-\noriented policies prevents us from properly comparing the\nefficacy of these two strategies.\nPolicy, Binge Drinking and Gambling\nThe analysis of policy variables and binge drinking rates\nrevealed a variety of relationships among policy variables\nand student drinking behaviors. Specifically, four policy\nvariables related to student binge drinking (see Table 7),\nand four alcohol policy variables related to student gam-\nbling behaviors (see Table 8). Interpretation of some of\nthese relationships is relatively straightforward. For\nexample, schools that prohibited alcohol at on-campus\nevents experienced less binge drinking than other schools.\nThis finding suggests that most students will abide by\nschool policy. However, other relationships are more dif-\nficult to interpret: schools that restricted legal-age drink-\ning had higher binge drinking rates than schools that did\nnot make restrictions for students  21. Perhaps, when for-\nbidden, students find alcohol to be more desirable. Alter-\nnatively, students of legal age might feel constrained by\nprohibitions and, as a result, drink more often to excess\nthan they would if the opportunity to drink was common-\nplace. This pattern of drinking was commonly observed\nduring the Volstead Act (i.e., national prohibition from\nillegal, but those who did tended to drink to excess [44].\nJust as with the Volstead Act, determining the real effect of\nschool alcohol policies is difficult because many other fac-\ntors (e.g., how long the policy has been in effect, state or\nlocal culture, etc.) influence drinking. The relationship\nbetween policy and drinking can be counterintuitive. For\nexample, schools that offered alcohol-free campus hous-\ning evidenced significantly higher mean student binge\ndrinking than schools that did not mention alcohol-free\nhousing (49% vs. 42%, respectively). Observers might\nexpect schools promoting alcohol-free dormitories to evi-\ndence lower binge drinking; alternatively, schools with\n\"dry\" housing might better recognize alcohol related\nproblems on their campus and set policy intended to\ncounter these problems among their students. Accord-\ningly, the 49% binge rate observed in this study could\nreflect a significant improvement in the rate of binge\ndrinking for these schools. Without longitudinal data,\nhowever, this analysis is beyond the scope of this study.\nFour schools in the sample indicated that they prohibited\nall alcohol use by students both on- and off-campus.\nThese schools had a significantly lower mean binge drink-\ning rate than other schools (10% vs. 45% respectively),\nsuggesting that prohibition discouraged drinking among\nthe majority of the student body; alternatively, these\nschools might attract students less interested in drinking.\nThree of the schools were religiously affiliated, and the\nfourth admitted primarily African-American students;\nboth minority status and religiosity are cultural factors\nthat have been shown to be associated with decreased sub-\nUnanticipated Policy Effects\nThe interaction effects observed among alcohol policy var-\niables and the presence of gambling policy on binge\ndrinking behavior and past-year student gambling behav-\nior presents an interesting and unanticipated finding.\nBecause schools that have prohibitive alcohol policies and\nprohibitive gambling policies evidence lower mean rates\nof binge drinking among students than other schools,\nrestrictive policies seem to have the intended effect of\ncountering potentially destructive behaviors among stu-\ndents. However, other conditions such as cultural factors\nalso play an important role in determining student behav-\niors. For example, students that choose to attend schools\nwith rigorous policy provisions might be intrinsically\nmore likely to refrain from excessive alcohol consumption\nfor ethical or religious reasons. Further, five of the six\nschools in our sample that had both (a) a policy prohibit-\ning alcohol at on-campus events and (b) a prohibitive\ngambling policy also had small enrollment (i.e., below\nthe 50th percentile among schools in our sample); four of\nthese six schools were state-operated. Underlying charac-\nteristics of students who seek out small state schools\nmight be associated with the reduced binge rates reported\namong these institutions. These results suggest that,\ndespite the role for shared policy guidelines, schools will\nbenefit from analyzing the composition of their student\nbody and tailoring new and modified alcohol policies to\nstudents' specific characteristics. Although competing\nexplanations prevent the establishment of concrete cause-\nand-effect relationships in this study, the observed inter-\naction effects between alcohol and gambling policies pro-\nvide significant impetus for future research into effective\npolicy strategy on college campuses.\nImplications\nFrom an observer's perspective, it appears that the many\npolicy inconsistencies \u00ad and policy presentation incon-\nsistencies \u00ad observed in this study reflect reactive policy-\nmaking strategies that are not guided by empirical\nevidence. The evidence suggests that effective school alco-\nhol and drug policies, and student awareness of these pol-\nicies, are important for many reasons. For example,\ncollege-aged individuals in recovery are extremely vulner-\nable to relapse; in addition to the generally high rate of\nrelapse during the first year of recovery [47,48], this cir-\ncumstance exists in part because of their age and the prev-\nalence of drug and alcohol abuse among their peers.\nStudents need to be aware of the potential health and\ntreatment options that are available to them on-campus if\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nrelapse occurs. Young people have not had alcohol use\ndisorders as long as their adult counterparts because of\ntheir age; similarly, college students recovering from an\nalcohol use disorder have not been healing for very long.\nRelapse can generate harmful financial, academic and\nother consequences that can impart severe restrictions\nupon students' actions, both on and off campus. Conse-\nquently, it is valuable for students struggling with addic-\ntion to be able to access specific school policies before\nthey enter a college or university; students who develop an\nalcohol problem after they are enrolled in college also\nneed access to this information, as well as policies govern-\ning recovery-seeking. Although it is possible that policies\ncan reduce alcohol abuse and dependence, comprehen-\nsive policies governing alcohol consumption among\nstudents hold the greatest potential to reduce pre-morbid\nand sub-clinical alcohol use on college campuses. Addic-\ntion models generally propose that while sub-clinical\nalcohol use and gambling can ultimately lead to a\npathological state, pre-morbid subjects also can move\naway from pathology and maintain controlled behavior\nor abstinence [49-51]. This can occur through the influ-\nence of social setting attributes, including policy direc-\ntives. Nevertheless, the high rate of drinking and binge\ndrinking among college students has continued despite\nevidence that schools have devoted increased attention to\npromoting alcohol awareness and prevention recently\n(e.g., Wechsler et al. 2002 [6]). Various factors, such as a\nlack of agreement among school policies, unbalanced pol-\nicies (e.g., policies that focus on punishment but not\nrecovery), or a failure on the part of school administrators\nto enforce stated rules could undermine a cohesive alco-\nhol policy and contribute to continued student drinking\nin the wake of school reform.\nIt is especially important for school administrators to\naddress risky drinking behaviors among students who do\nnot currently have a drinking problem. Research has\nshown that addictive disorders originate with risk factors\nthat always include exposure to potential objects of addic-\nsure (i.e., alcohol consumption) can combine with an\nindividual's underlying psychosocial and neurobiological\nvulnerabilities, resulting in desirable subjective shifts and\nthe potential for developing an addictive disorder [53].\nWhile each person has unique underlying vulnerabilities\nthat make them more or less likely to develop an alcohol\nuse disorder, reduction of opportunities to develop such a\ndisorder (e.g., in the form of focused regulations) will\nbenefit all students. With ever-increasing numbers of stu-\ndents entering four-year colleges in the U.S., clear explana-\ntions of institutional expectations and requirements\nregarding substance and behavioral addictions is an\nessential component of reducing such behaviors among\nthat \"alcohol education should be seen as part of the edu-\ncation of character\" (p. 45). DFSCA provisions have been\neffective in stimulating alcohol education and policy\ndevelopment on college campuses; however, currently,\nsome schools might not be providing reliable and accu-\nrate information about addictive behaviors, as evidenced\nby the inconsistent nature of the alcohol and gambling\npolicies observed in this study. In the absence of a similar\nfederal mandate requiring gambling education on college\ncampuses, other drastic federal measures (e.g., the pro-\nposed ban on all collegiate sports betting in Nevada[55])\nhave been proposed to reduce student gambling. Such\nproposals are problematic because these efforts restrict the\nfreedom of responsible gamblers and place policy pres-\nsure on states instead of schools, thereby diverting focus\nfrom those in need of effective regulation (i.e., college\ncampuses). Scientific guidelines toward school regulation,\nsimilar to those proposed for federal regulation by OMB,\nwill provide school administrators a solid foundation for\ncreating comprehensive alcohol and gambling policies. It\nis the responsibility of administrators to make the first\nsteps toward scientific selection of school policies and\ntake substantive and definitive measures to increase\naddiction awareness and recovery among students.\nCaveats\nSeveral methodological limitations to this study should\nbe noted. First, this study relied solely upon written policy\nmaterials. Although we conducted an exhaustive search of\nthe Internet and requested hard materials from schools, it\nis possible that we failed to identify some publicly availa-\nble policy materials that could have provided additional\ninformation about schools in our sample. In addition, we\nidentified our policy variables by examining existing pol-\nicies and identifying relevant regulatory components;\nhowever, others attempting to replicate this study might\nidentify and measure different aspects of policy and, con-\nsequently, obtain different results. Further, this study con-\nsidered official alcohol policy content across a sample of\nU.S. colleges; however, assessing official policy provides\nno data on whether or how schools enforce their stated\npolicies. It is possible, and in many cases even likely, that\nschools rely on informal rules and established precedents\nto govern alcohol use or gambling violations. Due to the\ncomplex nature of the relationships between school\nadministrators, students, parents and legal authorities,\nmany schools likely assess alcohol or gambling violations\non a case-by-case basis; consequently, practice policy\nmight be very different from the formal rules described by\nofficial school documentation.\nOpportunities for Future Research\nThis study has shown that there are many opportunities\nand perhaps an obligation to scientifically investigate the\ncomplex relationships between college alcohol and gam-\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nbling policies and addictive behaviors. Future research, for\nexample, should focus on policy enforcement and infor-\nmal policies adopted by school administrators to provide\na better understanding of current college practices regard-\ning alcohol use and abuse. In addition, as schools begin to\nreevaluate and amend their substance abuse policies,\nlongitudinal research could provide insight into the\neffects of policy revision on student behaviors. In addi-\ntion, to advance our understanding of policy effects on\nintemperate patterns of behavior, future college-based\nresearch will need to examine the influence of policies on\nmore specific behaviors. New research should deconstruct\nthe macro indices (e.g., average rates) of binge drinking to\ndetermine whether policies can impact college violence,\ncrime, driving under the influence, etc.\nCollege alcohol and gambling policy data holds impor-\ntant potential for future research. For example, for stu-\ndents with alcohol or gambling related disorders\nattending colleges with policies that interfere with treat-\nment or fail to support recovery, the rate of relapse is likely\nto be higher than under a more treatment favorable public\npolicy context. Similarly, research can demonstrate that\npolicies can influence the likelihood of early identifica-\ntion and intervention: under some unsympathetic\nregimes, students with addiction problems will not come\nforward for assistance or adhere to a prescribed treatment\nprogram. Finally, new research needs to show that with-\nout supportive policies to guide college staff responses to\ntreatment seeking students, this population will miss both\nthe college experience and the opportunity to build a\nhealthy foundation for their future.\nConclusions\nIn this study, we analyzed a representative sample of U.S.\ncolleges to determine the attentiveness of school policies\ntoward students with addictive disorders and their\nrecovery. The results encourage the development and\nimplementation of reporting tools (e.g., a rating system)\nthat could prove valuable as both a resource for parents of\nat-risk students and a vehicle to raise public awareness.\nIdentifying trends in collegiate policymaking as well as\ndistinguishing strong and weak policies will allow us to\nbegin to develop evidence based guidelines, or \"best prac-\ntices,\" upon which schools can base the development of\nfuture policy.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing\ninterests.\nAuthors' contributions\nHS conceived the study, was its principal architect, and\nwas responsible for its overall conduct and exposition.
