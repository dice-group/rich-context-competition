    "abstract": "Abstract\nSocial researchers have been required to consider the potential ethical implications of their research since research began.\nRecently however, the importance placed upon research ethics has undoubtedly increased, evident through the formation of\nadditional ethic committees, the production of various ethical guidelines and the increased number of publications addressing\nthe concept. However, with the emergence of new and diverse research approaches, it can be suggested that there should\nalso be the development of new and diverse ethical approaches. In this article, we consider the ethical stance taken when\nundertaking travel blog analysis and argue that due to the diverse and continuously evolving nature of travel blogs, the blanket\napproach that is so frequently adopted by researchers is not sufficient. We reflect on the ethics of utilising travel blog content\nas a method of data collection by considering the importance of whether the blogger is viewed as a human subject, whether\ndata collected from blogs are public or private, the need for informed consent and whether the blogger should be viewed\nas an author or a respondent. We then proceed to contribute to the body of existing ethical research by proposing a set of\nbroad ethical principles that can be applied for those undertaking travel blog analysis.\n",

In\nresponse to such expansive developments of the Internet,\nresearchers are now beginning to make use of the valuable\nnew data forms that to date have been under-exploited. Yet,\nit can be argued that the ethical approaches and guidelines\nhave not been adequately discussed or updated in response to\nthis (Stainton, 2016).

Social researchers have discussed research ethics\nfor specific methodologies for years, and there are clear\nguidelines to adopt for those undertaking traditional methods\nof data collection such as surveys and interviews. However,\nwhen undertaking data collection methods of a more innova-\ntive nature, such as travel blog analysis, researchers are given\nlittle direction.\nThis reflective article stems from ethical discussions and\nan arduous ethical approval process experienced while\nundertaking PhD research (Stainton, 2017).

Rather, we were required to succumb to\ngeneric ethical procedures. These generic approaches, how-\never, failed to take into account the complexities of the\nhuman world combined with the Internet sphere, which is a\nrelatively new realm within academia. Research addressing\nonline research methodologies remains to be in its infancy\nand thus the ethical implications associated are substantially\nunder-researched. There were certain characteristics of blog\nanalysis, as we proceed to discuss throughout this article,\nthat posed new dilemmas for our research. This article there-\nfore is designed to bring awareness to social researchers\nworking in the field of online methodologies while providing\nguidance to the future travel blog researcher.\nNetnography in the `blogosphere'\nIn recent years, the Internet and online social networking\nhave become an integral part of society. As a result of the\nimportance and reliance placed upon online presence,\nresearchers have begun to turn to Internet sources, such as\nblogs, as a valuable means of data collection (e.g. Carson and\nResearch such as this can be described as netnography \u00ad a\nform of ethnographic data collection undertaken via the\nInternet, unique in that it is neither observational of a life\nlived nor told in a research situation, but instead posted by\nNetnography can be undertaken through analysis of a\nnumber of online means, including Facebook updates,\ntweets, recommendations on Trip Advisor, discussions on\nspecialised online forums and blogs (Meged et al., 2014).\nThese online means fall within the realms of what is collec-\ntively known as Web 2.0. This is seen as the second stage of\nInternet development, whereby generators have stepped\naway from traditional statically designed web pages, towards\nuser-generated content (UGC) and peer-to-peer applications\n(Carson, 2008). Of these online means, blogs are considered\nto be `the next evolution of the web-based experience'(Kahn\nThe forms and appearances of blogs are manifold and\ncoveravastarrayofsubjectmatter(CarsonandSchmallegger,\ntourism. These sources can be data-rich, containing valuable\ninformation that may otherwise be unavailable to researchers\nfrequently the equivalent of personal online diaries, made up\nfrom one or more individual entries strung together by a\ncommon theme. They are commonly written by tourists to\nreport back to friends and families about their activities and\nBlogs are frequently updated and displayed in reverse chron-\nological and they tend to be interactive in nature, allowing\nreaders to post comments (Carson and Schmallegger, 2008).\nIn tourism studies, travel blogs have thus far been defined\nas online diaries containing individual entries related to the\nauthor's travel experience (Banyai and Glover, 2012;\nPuhringer and Taylor, 2008). There is a growing body of\ndata regarding travellers' behaviour, expectations and\ndemands, and success or failure of destination marketing\ncampaigns, the analysis of which could prove more benefi-\ncial than the use of traditional marketing tools (Akehurst,\n2009). It can be argued, however, that the nature of travel\nblogs extends beyond the notion of simply documenting\nexperiences, with many travel bloggers now running their\nwebsites as a career option, where the aim is to enhance read-\nership and to facilitate opportunities to make money through\naspects such as advertising, as opposed to simply document-\ning their personal experiences. This is an area not currently\naddressed within the existing body of literature that is worthy\nof consideration.\nTravel bloggers are free to upload a range of content of\ntheir choice, making this data source unique in that it is not\nin any way influenced by the researcher. Furthermore, data\nfrom blogs derive from naturally occurring, communal,\ncross-consumer interaction that is not found in alternative\nresearch methods (Meged et al., 2014; Banyai and\naccounted for on the Internet (Gaille, 2013). According to\nTechnorati's (2013) Digital Influence Report, blogs rank\namong the top five `most trustworthy' sources for informa-\nthe blogs were tagged as travel blogs (Technorati, 2009).\nHowever, despite such popularity of blogs as a method of\nresearch outside of academia, this has not to date been ech-\noed within scholarly practice (Snee, 2010) and research on\ntravel blogs is still in its infancy (Banyai and Glover,\n2012). Therefore, it can be noted that there is potentially\nvaluable information in the form of travel blogs that is yet\nto be explored by academics.\nEthical dilemmas for travel blog\nresearchers\nResearch has recently begun to emerge addressing the ethical\nconsiderations of online research (e.g.Association of Internet\nhowever, available protocols and guidelines are scarce and at\nlarge generically applied, despite recent calls for an ongoing\ndebate and dialogue of ethical conduct of online research\nto address the issue of ethics within Internet research.\nHowever, rather than provide explicit guidelines, they sug-\ngest that traditional ethical principles are followed where\npossible and that an individual assessment is undertaken on\neach study involving Internet research. In doing so, they\nStainton and Iordanova 3\nsuggest that researchers make ethical considerations with\nregard to how the context is assessed; who is involved in the\nstudy; what is the primary object of study; how data are\nstored, managed and represented; how texts, persons or data\nare being studied; how findings are presented; any harms or\nrisks associated with the study; the potential benefits of the\nstudy; and any issues that may arise involving vulnerable\npeople. While the adaptation of traditional ethical principles\nmay be appropriate in some instances, it can be argued that\nwith the scope of opportunities for the development of online\nmethodologies now available to researchers, these principles\nmay not always suffice. ESRC (2015) Framework for\nResearch ethics has recognised some of the new or unfamil-\niar ethics questions and dilemmas associated with online\nresearch, but fails to provide clear guidelines beyond the\nrequirement that a full ethics review should take place prior\nto the data collection process. Although this may give\nresearchers a little more direction, it can be argued that this\napproach of utilising standardised rules and principles is not\nsufficient when research involves the use of methodologies\nthat are of a unique or under-researched nature, such as travel\nblog analysis.\nKitchin (2007) distinguishes between online research and\nweb-based research (which is split into non-intrusive and\nengaged research) and argues that each type of Internet-\nbased research faces different ethical dilemmas and practices\ndepending on the level of engagement of researchers and the\nrole they play in the research context, where an increased\nlevel of interaction between researchers and participants\nleads to more complex ethical issues and challenges. Non-\nintrusive web-based research is considered to be when there\nis no interaction between the participants and the research-\ners, and the research relies entirely on the analysis of existing\ndata. During engaged web-based research, on the other hand,\nthere is interaction between the researchers and the partici-\npants to clarify the existing data or to ensure understanding.\nOn the other side of the continuum is online research where\nresearchers are not only observers, but also active partici-\npants in the research context (Kitchin, 2007). This echoes\nonline research is emerging'; whereas on one extreme the\nresearch is seen as not subject-based at all, on the other end,\nthere is an increased concern regarding potential risks for the\nresearch participants. This emphasises the blurred dynamics\nof online research and its associated ethical considerations,\nfurther indicating the need for the development of a set of\nguidelines specific to the particular methodology employed.\nIs travel blog research human subject research or\nnot?\nSome of the ethical dilemmas and challenges in Internet\nresearch originate from the lack of clarity about `whether\npeople in the online world are the subjects of research ... or\nauthors of works ... which they have knowingly put into the\npublic domain for information and comment' (Oates, 2006:\n65). Various studies (Canadian Institute of Health Research\nof non-intrusive nature where cyber-material such as docu-\nments, records, performances and online archival materials\npublicly available and analysed without any interaction\nbetween the researcher and the participants differs from the\ntraditionally so-called human subject research.\nAlthough it is by no means clear-cut, it can be, therefore,\nargued that despite travel blogs being written by human par-\nticipants, this material is in the public domain and is thus not\nhuman data (ESRC, 2012). Moreover, the lack of interaction\nbetween the human participants and the researchers suggests\nthat ethical guidelines applicable to human participants are\nless valid within travel blog analysis (CIHR et al., 2010).\nHowever, it can also be argued whether blog content neatly\nfits into either segment and that the content is neither an\nauthor nor a subject. In fact, the Internet complicates the\nrealities of personhood, and it can be suggested that rather\nthan fitting into either of the above categories, a blog can be\nseen as a digital extension of the self (Markham and\ngers as the authors within her study of the narratives of young\npeople taking a gap year, but the blog content as the author's\npublic documents.\nTravel blogs are written for a number of different pur-\nposes and as such should be ethically examined individually.\nTake the traditional association that blogs have with diaries,\nfor example. While this may provide rich and valuable data,\nit can be argued that the very nature of a diary is that it con-\nsists of private and personal entries written by the owner. It\nwould be unethical to utilise somebody's diary for research\npurposes without seeking permission should this be tangible,\neven if the diary was left in a public space, yet these ethical\nviews are not generally applied to travel blogs that effec-\ntively act as `online diaries'. This highlights not only the dif-\nferences between ethical approaches to online and offline\ndata sources, despite the often-similar nature that they may\nhave, but also the different blog types. As such, while the\npresented ethical guidelines in this article may be better\nsuited to online as opposed to offline research, it is important\nto note that due to the diverse nature of blogs, these guide-\nlines are intended to be flexible in correspondence with the\ndata type.\nPrivate or public space?\nIt is argued by some researchers (Thurlow et al., 2004) that\nprivacy issues represent the most important ethical hurdle for\nonline researchers. The simplicity of the division between\npublic and private Internet data complicates the issue even\nfurther, as research perceived as non-intrusive conducted in\npublic spaces does not require to be scrutinised for ethical\nissues in the same way as research conducted in private\nspaces (CIHR et al., 2010). Furthermore, in some instances,\nit might avoid the ethical review process altogether (Madge,\n4 Methodological Innovations\nThis debate is problematic, however, as there is no clear\ndefinition of what is `private' on the Internet, and it can be\nsuggested that there is a lack of awareness about who can\naccess online communications and who cannot (Hudson and\nBruckman, 2005), meaning that some people may post con-\ntent in the public domain without the intentions of it being\npublicly accessible. In many instances, for example, non-\nintrusive research is compared to research conducted in pub-\nlic spaces such as parks, town squares and shopping centres\nwhere it cannot be expected from people around the partak-\ning parties not to pay attention to the conversation when they\nare close enough to listen in (Kitchin, 2007).\nIn the context of travel blogging, however, this should\nnot, at large, be an issue as the very nature of blogging is to\npublicly publish content, and it can be assumed that most\ntravel bloggers are aware of this when they create and man-\nage their websites. What may not be as clear, however, is\nwhether the information is `psychologically private'. Frankel\nand Siang (1999) proposed that there are two distinct types\nof privacy within Internet research: technological and psy-\nchological. If a travel blog post is technologically private, a\nreader would require a password or a unique link to access it.\nAs the majority of travel bloggers manage their websites\nthemselves, it can be assumed that they will be aware of any\ntechnological privacy, and this therefore is not deemed a sig-\nnificant issue within travel blog analysis. There are, how-\never, several considerations to be made by researchers\nregarding psychological privacy.\nPsychological privacy suggests that the travel bloggers\nmay post content that is viewed as personal or private, and\nalthough they may be aware that it has been posted within the\npublic domain, they have no intentions of their personal\ninformation to be viewed by the many and potentially used\nfor research purposes, despite the argument by Hewson et al.\n(2003) that data that have been made deliberately and volun-\ntarily available in the public Internet domain could be used\nfor research purposes under the condition that participants'\nAn example of psychological privacy can be when a\ntravel blogger chooses to hide their identity; they may not\nwant to be affiliated with the blog content, and thus, their\nassociation remains private. Furthermore, the concept of per-\nceived privacy is worthy of discussion. Online contributors\noften have unrealistic expectations of privacy and confiden-\ntiality that are unlikely to reflect the reality (Warrell and\nJacobsen, 2014). What one person may perceive as being\nprivate, another may not, for instance, the backpacker may\nproduce their blog with the intentions of only their family\nviewing it, thus perceiving it as private, and although pub-\nlicly available, they do not consider the possibility that peo-\nple they do not know may also view the content. Another\ntravel blogger, however, such as the person running their\nblog for monetary value, may be very aware of the potential\npublicity of what they publish because the content is situated\nin the public domain.\nOften it is a judgement call of the travel blog researcher\nand/or the research ethics approval panel as to what consti-\ntutes public and what constitutes private online space, but in\nmaking this decision, Warrell and Jacobsen's (2014) set of\nquestions could be considered: (1) what type of information\nis being shared (simple facts and everyday conversations, or\npersonal and intimate) and (2) is the online space password\nprotected or not. In essence, the argument is not necessarily\nabout whether the blog content is public or private, rather it\nis about making sensible and ethical decisions based upon\nthe content being reviewed.\nInformed consent\nOne of the most frequent references to ethics within social\nresearch refers to the importance of gaining informed consent\nwhereby questions such as when is informed consent required,\nhow can it be obtained, and how can it be validated (Frankel\nand Siang, 1999: 7) arise. Informed consent is based upon the\nprinciple that individuals are given the opportunity to decide\nwhether they wish to participate in the research or not. In order\nfor consent to be `informed', the reason for the study, the\nrequirements of the participants and any potential harm or\nrisks must be explained (Seale, 2012). Human subject research\nnorms such as informed consent, however, do not apply to\npublic, published material, and as such, consent is not required\nwhen analysing traditional texts such as newspapers and liter-\ncould prove impossible to obtain informed consent for already\nexisting information in online settings due to intentional or\nunintentional lack of traces of the author (Punch, 2014; Warrell\nand Jacobsen, 2014). Whereas there are clear boundaries when\nreviewing texts such as a newspaper article, as demonstrated\nin the previous paragraph, these boundaries are blurred when\nit comes to blog analysis. One could view a blog as secondary\ndata source, where the material has been published in line with\na newspaper article or a magazine, for example. If this view is\ntaken, this does not require travel blog researchers to obtain\ninformed consent as this is perceived as non-intrusive based\nFinally, it can be questioned whether contacting travel\nbloggers in order to gain consent to use their blog content for\nresearch purposes is appropriate. Many bloggers choose to\nprovide little or no detail of who they are and how they can\nbe contacted. This indicates that they may not wish to be\ndisturbed. Furthermore, blogs are available in the public\ndomain; therefore, a blogger may feel that it is unnecessary\nfor a researcher to contact them to ask permission to use their\ncontent as they are aware that the content is available pub-\nlicly. Sending permission requests to bloggers may also be\nviewed as spam, as being intrusive or as an invasion of the\nbloggers' privacy (Hewson et al., 2003) and consequently\ninfluence participants behaviour should they wish not to be\nsubjects of a research study (Warrell and Jacobsen, 2014).\nStainton and Iordanova 5\nAnonymity and authorship\nIt is widely accepted that participants in offline research\nretain ownership over their words originating from the notion\nthat they have the right to have their contribution withdrawn\nfrom a piece of research prior to publishing it. This denotes\nthat if online research is seen in the same way as offline\nresearch, travel bloggers should have the same `ownership'\nrights and receive credits for their work. If, however, travel\nblog research is seen as `textual analysis' of data with no-\nrestrictive access, the obligation towards the author(s) should\nnot be of concern (Bradley and Carter, 2012; Warrell and\nJacobsen, 2014). However, the latter perspective is chal-\nlenged by some as the existence of any `text' understandably\nsuggests the existence of a human author towards whom\nresearchers have certain obligations and responsibilities\nmay be some cases, such as those writing personal diary-\nbased blogs, for example, where authors might have the\ndesire to stay anonymous (Liu, 2010). This resonances\nBruckman's (2002) argument that Internet users should be\nperceived as `amateur artists' who should receive credit for\nthe work they do should they wish so.\nBased on the above viewpoints, the decision as to whether\nto reveal participants' identity and give them credit for their\nwork or to keep them anonymous is a complex one, where\ncontext along with researchers' ethical and philosophical\nposition and recommendations from ethical committees are\nit is recommended that each blog type is analysed in corre-\nspondence with suggested ethical guidelines while paying\nspecific consideration to nature of the blogs being examined\nin order to justify the most suitable approach.\nProposed ethical guidelines for travel\nblog research\nOverall, it can be seen that while there are broad ethical dis-\ncussions that have taken place, none provide the travel blog\nresearcher with clear guidelines from which to work. In an\nattempt, therefore, to contribute to the debate and to provide\na basis from which travel blog researchers can ground their\nethical principles, a set of six guidelines have been produced\nencompassing the arguments presented in this article while\nallowing for the flexibility and adaptation that is needed for\ndifferent blog types and different types of research.\n1. Informed consent\nThis should be considered on an individual basis and will\nvary depending on the nature of research. As a general guide,\ninformed consent is not necessary for those who have know-\ningly published the content to be researched in the public\ndomain. However, content that is of a particularly private or\npersonal nature should be considered individually and\nassessed as `psychologically private' if deemed necessary by\nthe researcher.\n2. Author or subject\nThe researcher should decide whether the content used for\nresearch purposes acts as a primary data source (i.e. the\ntravel blog content is the `subject') or from a secondary data\nsource (i.e. the travel blog content acts as the author). This\nwill be dependent upon the research design and outcomes\nand will affect whether the travel blogger is anonymous or\nwhether credit is attributed to them. This should be clearly\nexplained and justified by the researcher.\n3. Online and offline principles\nIf the travel blog examined can be seen as the same as an\noffline data source, for instance, a diary, then the ethical prin-\nciples should be no different whether the content is located\nonline or offline.\n4. Duty of care\nTravel blog researchers should be conscious of the potential\nauthors or contributors of the blog, and if it is suspected that\nthey may be a member of a vulnerable community or indi-\ncates that the blog was not intended for public or research\npurposes, the researcher should apply a traditional ethical\napproach.\n5. Data protection\nIn large, this is not applicable to travel blogs, whereby the\ncontent is publicly available on the Internet although indi-\nvidual consideration should be made depending on the nature\nof the blogs. Data interrogation and analysis should be stored\nin a safe, secure and private place.\n6. Accuracy of data obtained\nIf there is a risk that data may not be entirely accurate or are\nnot verifiable, this should be noted as a limitation by the\nresearcher.\nThe above guidelines have been produced to enable travel\nblog researchers with some sense of direction, as opposed to\ndichotomous obligation. Following the recommendations of\ntheAoIR (2012), it is recommended within travel blog research\nthat the core ethical principles should be applied, but that these\nare then tailored to the specific needs of the research context.\nWhile these proposed guidelines, however, can operationally\nact as a useful basis from which the ethical blog researcher can\nwork, it is important to note that they are not without their\nlimitations. Most notably, this is the subjective interpretation\nof the blogs, their intended audience and the authorship. It is\nalso important to note that while these proposed guidelines\n6 Methodological Innovations\nmay be a useful starting point for the researcher, it is important\nthat the ethical approach is adapted to suit the needs of the\nspecific blog types under examination in relation to the aims\nof the research at hand. Ethical judgement in Internet, and sub-\nsequently blog research, inevitably relies on inductive, contex-\ntual assessment of the specific case in question, and it is\nimportant to highlight that different ethical choices may be\nequally as legitimate and sound (Lomborg, 2013).\nConclusion\nAs demonstrated throughout this article, utilising blogs as a\nmethod of data collection, in our experience, required\nthoughtful and reflective analysis in order to address any\npotential ethical implications. Our experiences raised an\nabundance of questions that we have subsequently addressed\nin the preceding paragraphs. We have concluded that\nalthough to take an individual approach to ethically analys-\ning blogs is evidently the most suitable, it is beneficial if\nresearchers have a foundation from which to base their deci-\nsions. Therefore, this article contributes to the existing body\nof literature by proposing a set of guidelines for social\nresearchers, choosing to adopt travel blog analysis as their\nchosen research method to work from.\nWhile debates on the suitability of the current regulatory\nstructure of ethics bureaucracy within academia continue, for\nnow researchers must work within the framework that they\nare provided and succumb to the processes necessary in\norder to achieve the correct permissions to undertake their\nwork. In light of this, this article has outlined the key con-\ncerns for researchers choosing to analyse travel blogs. As\noutlined in this article, there are a range of methodological\nresearch approaches utilising the Internet as a means of data\ncollection that are emerging in parallel with the increased use\nof the Internet in society. While these data may yield valua-\nble data that previously may have been unavailable to the\nresearcher, however, it is clear that the current ethical bound-\naries are unclear. This article therefore contributes to the lim-\nited body of methodological literature addressing blog\nanalysis as a method of data collection, addressing some of\nthe current ambiguities surrounding ethical online research\nand subsequently providing a set of flexible, yet informed\nguidelines for researchers to work from. This can be argued\nessential in a world of increasing scrutiny in research ethics.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAkehurst G (2009) User generated content: The use of blogs for\ntourism organizations and tourism consumers.
