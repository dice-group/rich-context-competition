Expansion of femur outer diameter seems to counter net bone loss so that stresses remain similar\nacross age groups, but stresses are higher in older women than in older men.\nIntroduction: The age decline in hip BMD is caused by both bone loss and expansion of outer diameter that\nincreases the region size over which mass is measured in a DXA scan. Because expansion has an opposing\neffect on structural strength, it may be a homeostatic adaptation to net bone loss to ensure that load stresses\nare kept within a narrow range.\nMaterials and Methods: Age trends in femur stresses were evaluated with an engineering beam simulation of\na fall on the greater trochanter. Hip geometry was extracted from hip DXA scans using the Hip Structure\nAnalysis (HSA) software on 2613 non-Hispanic white men and 2721 women from the third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Using body weight as load, stresses were computed on the\ninferior-medial and superior-lateral femur neck at its narrowest point and the medial and lateral shaft 2 cm\ndistal to the midpoint of the lesser trochanter. Stresses and the underlying geometries in men and women >50\nyears oaf age were compared with those 20\u00ad49 years of age.\nResults: Compared with men <50 years of age, stresses in older men were 6% lower on both surfaces of the\nshaft, 4% lower on the inferior-medial neck, and not different on the superior-lateral neck. In women >50\nyears of age, stresses on the proximal shaft and inferior-medial neck remained within 3% of young values but\nwere 13% greater on the superior-lateral neck. Neck stresses in young women were lower on the superior-\nlateral than the inferior-medial neck, but lateral stress increased to the level on the medial surface in older\nwomen. Stresses were higher in women than in men, with a greater gender difference in those >50 years of age.\nConclusions: We conclude that femur expansion has a homeostatic effect in men and women that opposes\nbone loss so that stresses change little with age. Because expansion preserves stresses with progressively less\nbone mass, the process may reduce structural stability in the femoral neck under fall conditions, especially in\nthe elderly female.\n",

In both men and women, BMD increases\nduring skeletal growth, peaks in young adulthood, and de-\nclines gradually thereafter, somewhat more quickly after\nmenopause in women. Because low BMD is firmly linked\nto osteoporotic fractures, it is broadly believed that the\ndecline in BMD represents a gradual reduction in mechani-\ncal strength that ultimately results in fragility. However, a\ngradual decline in strength through adulthood would sug-\ngest that homeostasis was generally deficient in adult bones.\nHowever, the biological evidence that bone tissue is self-\nrenewing and that it dynamically adapts to changing load-\ning conditions throughout life is quite compelling. There-\nfore, how can we reconcile the seemingly inconsistent\npicture presented by the BMD data and the biological evi-\ndence of homeostasis? From a mechanical perspective,\nbones can weaken by altering the structural geometry so\nDr Beck's institution has licensed the Hip Structure Analysis\nsoftware to Hologic, Inc.

The general consensus is that age changes predomi-\nnately alter the amount and distribution of the bone mate-\nrial within the bone (i.e., structural geometry), with little\ninfluence on the ultimate stress.(1,2) (We do not imply that\nmaterial changes play no role in osteoporotic fragility but\nthat age changes are mainly geometric; see discussion.) If\nhomeostasis is actually effective, it must alter the geometry\nto keep load stresses relatively constant, but to be consis-\ntent with the BMD data, it must do so in a way that permits\na decline in BMD and an increase in fracture risk.\nThe answer to this quandary may be evident in a closer\nlook at the trends in femoral neck BMD data from the third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population.\nBecause the length of the neck region normally takes a\ndefault value, expansion of region area should be caused\nby widening of the bone outer margins. We present data\nthat suggest the downward trend with age in femoral neck\nBMD in both men and women is faster than the trend in\nbone mass (BMC). These data will suggest that the net\nbone loss apparent in BMC trends is opposed by expan-\nsion of outer diameter. We previously showed the expan-\nsion of bone outer margins in a geometric analysis of the\nsame data by the Hip Structure Analysis (HSA) method.(3)\nThe latter effect may be a generalized characteristic of ag-\ning long bones.(3\u00ad8) It has been speculated to have a ho-\nmeostatic purpose, because as diameter is increased, bend-\ning stiffness requires progressively less material in the cross-\nIt is not known whether the expansion of diameter is\nactually sufficient to offset bone loss so that maximum\nstresses do not increase with age. Because we have previ-\nously derived the hip structural geometry on the hip scans\nfrom the NHANES III survey by the HSA method,(3) these\ndata can be combined with anthropometry to derive an\nestimate of mechanical stress so that age trends may be\nevaluated in adult men and women. We chose to estimate\nstresses in a simulation of a fall on the greater trochanter\nbecause most hip fractures are believed to occur in that\nmode.(10) Our working hypothesis was that the expansion\nof femur diameter is sufficient to compensate net bone loss\nso that stresses change little with age.\nData source\nData were taken from NHANES III, conducted by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease\nvey used a stratified, multistage probability design to select\nthe sample, and collected data through household inter-\nviews and by direct standardized physical examinations\nconducted in specially equipped mobile examination cen-\nters.

Because their inclusion did not alter estimates,\nthose who received a scan of the right femur were included.\nMeasurements were obtained with three Hologic QDR\n1000 DXA scanners (Hologic, Waltham, MA, USA), lo-\ncated in mobile examination centers. A rigorous quality\ncontrol (QC) program was used throughout the study to\nensure data quality.(12)\nThe HSA method for extracting cross-sectional geometry\nfrom bone mass image data is based on principles first de-\nscribed by Martin and Burr.(13) At a site where the cross-\nsection is to be evaluated, a line of pixel values traversing\nthe bone axis is extracted from the image. The resulting\nprofile is a mass projection of the corresponding cross-\nsection and can be used to describe its geometry relevant to\nscan plane stresses.

After determining the profile center\nof mass, the cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI) is\nderived as the integral of area times the square of distance\nfrom the center of mass. Section modulus (Z) is computed\nby dividing CSMI by the maximum distance from the center\nof mass to the medial or lateral outer surface. Note that\nCSMI and Z by this method are only relevant for bending\nin the image plane unless the cross-section is axially sym-\nmetric.\nStress analysis\nStresses were computed at two cross-sections in the\nproximal femur using a formalism described previously for\na continuum model of the femur in a simulation of a fall\nwith impact on the greater trochanter.(14) Because of limi-\ntations of a 2D image, force vectors were restricted to the\nDXA image plane; all stresses were computed using body\nweight as equivalent to the ground reaction force. The\nground reaction force was oriented along the bisector of the\nneck and shaft axes, and the body load was distributed to\nachieve static equilibrium along antiparallel vectors\nthrough the center of the femoral head and the midpoint of\nthe femoral shaft. Measurements of neck-shaft angle and\ndistances between load vectors and section positions were\nderived from the HSA program; thigh length was incorpo-\nrated from external anthropometry. Maximum stresses\nwere computed at the medial and lateral margins of two\ncross-sections: across the narrowest point of the femoral\nneck and across the proximal femoral shaft at a point 2 cm\ndistal to the midpoint of the lesser trochanter (to eliminate\nsize effects on placement, more recent HSA algorithms\nplace the shaft region at a distance of 1.5 times the mini-\nmum neck width distal to the intersection of the neck and\nshaft axes). The HSA program measured the loci of these\nsections relative to load vectors within the scan plane.\nUsing standard engineering beam theory, bending stress\nwas computed at the outer margin of the medial and lateral\ncortices of the cross-section as equation:\n\nb\n My/I\nWhere M is the bending moment, y is the distance from the\ncenter of mass of the cross-section to the medial or lateral\nmargin, and I is the CSMI. The bending moment was com-\nputed as the orthogonal component of the load multiplied\nby distance to the section location, measured parallel to the\nneck or shaft axis as appropriate. By convention, y in the\ndirection of bending is positive and negative in the opposing\ndirection (lateral and medial, respectively). Axial stress was\ncomputed as:\n\nc\n Fa\n/A\nWhere Fa\nis the axial component of the load, and A is bone\nStatistics\nTo determine whether age has an effect on stresses, mean\nfor men and women separately.

All group differences were evaluated\nwith p < 0.05 as significant using an unpaired two-tailed\nt-test. Analyses were performed using SUDAAN,(15) a fam-\nily of statistical procedures for analysis of data from com-\nplex sample surveys.\nRESULTS\nTrends in femur neck BMC, BMD, bone area, and\nouter diameter\nFigures 1A and 1B shows femur neck BMC data by de-\ncade in non-Hispanic white men and women, respectively,\nafter normalizing values to those of young adults so that\ncross-sectional patterns by age are easily seen. For compari-\nson purposes, Fig. 1 also shows data for BMD, bone area,\nand outer diameter (width); the BMD and outer diameter\ndata have been published previously.(4) Means for these\nvariables are compared between young and old age groups\nin Table 1. It can be seen that the apparent age decline in\nbone mass (BMC) is smaller than that in BMD and that this\nis caused by higher values for bone area with increasing age.\nThe expansion of the Hologic neck bone area (FNBA) is\nlikely explained by the expansion of the outer diameter of\nthe neck with age as documented by the HSA method.\nStresses\nMean values by decade of medial and lateral stresses are\nplotted at the neck (Fig. 2A) and proximal shaft (Fig. 2B)\nFIG. 1.

(Lines connecting means are for visual clarity only.)\nfor men and women. To evaluate age and gender effects,\nthe mean stresses for young (<50 years) and old (50 years)\nmen and women are compared in Table 2. Stresses appear\nlower in men than in women at both neck and shaft; differ-\nences were significant (Table 2). At the neck in both men\nand women, stresses are lower on the superior-lateral sur-\nface than on the inferior-medial surface, and these differ-\nences disappear with age. Medial and lateral stresses are\ncomparable (within 3% in women and 1% in men) in the\nshaft in both genders through the age span. Inferior-medial\nneck stresses in women vary little with age (Fig. 2A), and\ndifferences between young and old women are not signifi-\ncant. However, superior-lateral neck stresses in women do\nincrease substantially by 13% between young and old age\ngroups. Shaft stresses in women are significantly, albeit\nslightly, higher in older women on both surfaces. At the\nfemur neck in men, inferior-medial stresses are on average\n4% lower than in younger individuals. At both shaft sur-\nfaces in men, the apparent decline with age is more evident,\nso that stresses in older men are 6% less than in younger\ncounterparts.\nTable 1 shows gender and age group differences in body\nweight, conventional DXA parameters at the femoral neck,\nand geometry at the femoral neck and proximal shaft. The\nmen were, of course, heavier than women, but within gen-\nder, there was little difference in weight between younger\nand older groups. The well-known age differences in con-\nventional BMD in both men and women are evident as are\nthe opposing age differences in BMC and in FNBA. The\nage group BMD differences from the HSA analysis are\nconsistent with their conventional counterparts at the neck\nand are smaller in both genders at the shaft. Note that the\nage group difference in bone width is similar at the neck\nand shaft and across genders. The effects of the apparent\nexpansion of diameter on BMD and geometry are complex;\nthey differ between shaft and neck and across genders. At\nthe shaft in men, greater width essentially explains why\nBMD is lower in the older group; the apparent decline in\nthe amount of bone (CSA) in the cross-section does not\nreach significance. In older women, however, expansion of\ndiameter is responsible for approximately one third of the\n15% lower BMD. At the neck in both men and women,\nroughly one third of the age difference in BMD is caused by\nan expanded diameter. The effects of diameter differences\non CSMI are nonlinear, because this parameter varies as\nthe fourth power of the outer radius. In older men and\nwomen, CSMIs in the femoral shaft were significantly\nlarger by 10% and 6% respectively, compared with the\nyounger group. At the femoral neck, the CSMI in older\nmen and women was within 3% of the young value, al-\nthough an increase was apparent in men and a decline in\nwomen. The strong dependence of CSMI on outer diameter\nexplains the rather large gender difference in this bending\nproperty; and like most other parameters, the gender dif-\nference was greater in the older age group. At the neck, the\ncenter of mass (centroid position) shifted medially with age\nin both genders but significantly more so in women. No\nshift was apparent in the shafts of men, and only a slight\nmedial shift was seen in women.\nDISCUSSION\nWe hypothesized that the expansion of femur diameter\nwith age represents a homeostatic adaptation that opposes\nthe effects of bone loss so that load stresses remain con-\nstant. Our results are generally consistent with this hypoth-\nesis, with one exception: superior-lateral neck stress was\n13% higher in older women than in younger women.

Like the pattern in women, stresses on\nthe lateral neck surface in men were greater in the older\ngroup, but unlike women, the difference did not reach sig-\nnificance. In both younger men and women, femoral neck\nstresses were lower on the superior-lateral than on the in-\nferior-medial surface, and magnitudes converged after age\n50. The apparent age increase in superior-lateral stress that\nproduced convergence is only significant in females and\nseems to be caused by an inferior-medial shift in the femo-\nral neck center of mass (i.e., centroid position; also appar-\nent to a lesser extent in males). Together with the increase\nin neck diameter, the shift increases the value of y in Eq. 1,\nwith a greater effect in females. It is interesting that,\nwhereas the superior-lateral neck stress shows an apparent\nincrease with age in women, the magnitude only rises to the\nhigher level seen on the inferior-medial neck surface. Over-\nall, these findings suggest that, in a fall on the greater tro-\nchanter, the resulting stresses would differ little between\nyounger and older individuals, and the only substantial age\ndifference is on the superior-lateral neck in women.\nIn contrast to the general lack of differences by age, we\nfound gender differences worthy of comment. Stresses gen-\nerated in a fall are higher in women than in men, and this\neffect is greater in older individuals. The changes in cross-\nsectional geometry that explain the stress differences with\nage and gender are quite clear. The expansion of diameter\ndoes seem to offset bone loss, but there are subtle conse-\nquences of the process that may not be advantageous under\nthe conditions of a fall. In normal upright ambulation, the\nfemur is bent in the opposite direction than in the fall mode.\nThis means that in normal ambulatory activity, bending\nstresses on the superior-lateral neck surface are in tension\nand the thicker inferior-medial cortex is in compression.\nThe reverse is true in the fall mode, where the thinner\nsuperior-lateral surface is in compression. Physiologic loads\nadd axial forces that subtract from the tensile stresses\ncaused by bending on the superior-lateral surface and that\nadd to the compressive stress on the inferior-medial neck.\nEffectively, the lateral neck is relatively unloaded during\nnormal ambulation(16); thus, peak stresses that drive adap-\ntation are concentrated on the medial surface where corti-\nces seem not to thin with age.(17) The resulting redistribu-\ntion of material in the aging neck shifts the center of mass\ntoward the medial surface. Bending stresses (Eq. 1) are\ninversely dependent on I/y, where y is the distance from the\ncenter of mass to the medial or lateral surface for the re-\nspective stresses. In long bones, y generally increases with\nage because of expansion of diameter that displaces the\ncortical surface farther from the center of mass. This age-\ndependent increase in y is greater on the lateral neck be-\ncause of the additional effect of the inferior-medial shift in\nthe center of mass. The larger medial shift in women is\nlikely the main reason why superior-lateral neck stresses\nare higher in older women, whereas inferior-medial stresses\nare not. Mayhew et al.(17) recently described the age shift in\nfemoral neck center-of-mass in a study that analyzed CT\nscans of the femoral neck in a cross-sectional sample of 77\nadult cadaver specimens. They conjectured that the shift is\ncaused by adaptation to habitual patterns of ambulatory\nstresses that are less varied in modern inactive populations\nthan in more primitive ones.\nThe finding that load stresses vary little with age con-\ntrasts starkly with the epidemiological evidence of increas-\ning hip fracture rates in old age and with age patterns in\nBMD. They are, however, remarkably consistent with the\ngeometric findings of Russo et al.(18) based on quantitative\nCT scans of the tibia in a cross-sectional sample of Italian\nadults. In both men and women, they showed an upward\ntrend in the external dimensions of tibial cross-sections that\nseemed to preserve resistance to bending stress.(18) If the\ngeometric adaptation that underlies declining areal BMD\nFIG. 2. Mean values by age decade of stresses computed on the\nmedial and lateral margins of the (A) narrowest cross-section of\nthe femoral neck and (B) proximal femur shaft in a simulation of\na fall with impact on the greater trochanter on non-Hispanic white\nmen and women. (Lines connecting means are for visual clarity\nonly.)\nensures that stresses remain relatively constant with age,\nwhy do bones become fragile in old age? One explanation\nmight be that changes in the material strength may reduce\nthe stress capacity of old bones or at least in those who\nsuffer fractures.(19) There is a great deal of semantic con-\nfusion regarding material properties in the literature be-\ncause of differences in their definition. Strictly speaking,\nmaterial properties refer to the mechanical behavior of\nbone tissue under load and are a function of the tissue\ncomposition (i.e., properties of the organic matrix, osteon\nsubstructure, mineralization, accumulated microdamage).\nThere are no reliable methods for noninvasive measure-\nment of bone tissue material properties in vivo, and spe-\ncialized methods such as nanoindentation are required for\ntheir evaluation from biopsies.(20) Certain practical issues\nhave resulted in an alternative definition, which is more\nproperly termed apparent material properties. Traditional\nengineering tests of material properties use specimens ma-\nchined to standardized geometric dimensions so that and\nany differences in load behavior are caused by material\nproperties and not differences in stress. Bone specimens\nmachined to typical test sizes, however, vary in porosity,\nespecially in aging cortical bone and trabecular specimens.\nStresses are really not constant because applied loads are\nsupported by varying amounts and arrangements of mate-\nrial hence measurements reflect only \"apparent\" material\nproperties. Work by several investigators showed that age\ndependence and osteoporotic differences in apparent prop-\nerties are mainly caused by porosity,(1,2,21) with little sys-\ntematic change at the tissue level. If bone microstructure is\nmeasured with sufficient resolution, apparent material\nproperties are unnecessary, and CT methods capable of\ndoing so in vivo at certain extremity sites(22) have become\navailable. Finite element analysis (FEA) models evaluate\nirregular structures by breaking them into small box-like\nelements. Models with millions of microelements small\nenough to evaluate the fine trabecular structure have been\ndeveloped from CT data. Because computational de-\nmands scale with numbers of elements, such high-resolution\nmodels require massively parallel supercomputers and hun-\ndreds of hours of computation time (see van Rietbergen et\nal.(23) and Eswaran et al.(22) for examples). FEA models\nwith element sizes of a few millimeters are far more man-\nageable and correspond better to resolution capabilities of\nhigh-end total body CT scanners. However, because the\nfine structure cannot actually be resolved, the concept of\napparent material properties is a convenient method way of\nhandling their effects. Apparent material properties are\nalso unnecessary in analyses derived from DXA, not be-\ncause the microstructure is imaged, but because porosity\neffects are eliminated. Only the mineral mass is projected\ninto the DXA image plane; the surrounding or internal soft\ntissues are subtracted out by the dual-energy mathematics.\nEffectively, pores within cortical or trabecular bone are col-\nlapsed out and are thus not present in the cross-sectional\ngeometry measured from the mineral mass profiles. Al-\nthough it does not seem to be a general effect of age or\nosteoporosis, degraded material strength may play a role in\nsome osteoporotic fractures, although current noninvasive\nimaging methods are not yet capable of quantifying it.\nAge-related loss of bone strength can only be caused by\nincreased stresses (degraded geometry) or reduced stress\ncapacity of the material. Here we argue that age-related\nstrength loss is probably not in the (actual) material prop-\nerties and doesn't seem to be in the geometry according to\nour calculations. Macroscopic properties such as CSA and\nCSMI are integrated over the whole cross-section; however,\nunder compressive loads, thin-walled structures can exhibit\nlocal failure of a portion of the cross-section, and in such\ncases, stresses are underestimated by the CSA and\nCSMI.(24) There is little doubt that the aging femoral neck\ncross-sections exhibit cortical thinning with age, albeit pref-\nerentially on surfaces that are not heavily loaded in normal\nambulation.(17) Together with expansion of outer diameter\nand bending the thinning surface in a fall, these geometric\nchanges should cause strength loss caused by the contribu-\ntion of local buckling as speculated by Mayhew et al.(17)\nFurther work will be needed to determine if this is theoret-\nically likely with geometries that are achieved in osteopo-\nrotic bones.\nThere are a number of methodological limitations to this\nwork. The DXA-based geometry method restricts cross-\nsectional moments of inertia and thus the stress analysis to\nthe 2D image plane; conclusions cannot be drawn regarding\nout-of-plane stresses. Because DXA methods cannot evalu-\nate material effects, the entire analysis assumes that all dif-\nMen Women Women vs. men\nYoung\nYoung\nYoung\nFemoral neck at narrowest point\nProximal femoral shaft\nGender comparisons were based on age-adjusted means (data not shown).\n* Stresses were computed in a simulation of a fall on the greater trochanter.\nferences are geometric, although this is actually true of\nmost engineering analyses of bone to date. As we have\npointed out, it is possible that some age changes alter ma-\nterial strength at the tissue level, although such effects can\nonly be reliably evaluated by biopsy methods at present. It\nis also important to recognize that the apparent changes in\ngeometry that are responsible for keeping stresses relatively\nconstant with age are an adaptive response to loading con-\nditions experienced in normal activity; bones certainly don't\nadapt to remain strong under the conditions of a fall on the\nhip as evaluated here. Ultimately a stress analysis should be\nrepeated on a data set that has sufficient information to\nsimulate physiologic loading configurations and magnitudes\n(which are probably not best characterized by body weight)\nso that adaptive changes across the age span can be better\nevaluated.\nBecause the NHANES sample is cross-sectional, cohort\neffects could confound the age trends described in this\nstudy. Cross-sectional age patterns in femur BMD have\nbeen shown to differ from longitudinally determined age\npatterns,(25) so those observed here need to be confirmed\nprospectively. Other limitations of the NHANES data in-\nclude the exclusion of institutionalized persons from the\nsampling frame; they may have lower BMD and potentially\ndifferent geometry. Finally, some individuals who were se-\nlected for the survey did not participate. However, a pre-\nvious analysis suggested that nonrespondents did not differ\nimportantly from respondents.(4)\nWe conclude that the expansion of diameter that par-\ntially explains the reduction in BMD of the aging proximal\nfemur represents a homeostatic adaptation that offsets the\napparent net loss of bone mass observed in aging men and\nwomen participating in the NHANES survey. Despite sig-\nnificantly lower BMD levels in older men and women,\nproximal femur stresses generated in a simulation of a fall\non the greater trochanter were similar in older versus\nyounger persons. A modestly higher stress on the superior-\nlateral surface in older women seems to be caused by a\nshift in the center of mass, so that in a fall configuration,\nthe cortex may experience higher stresses in compression.\nWhen combined with greater cortical thinning with age\nin an expanded diameter, that surface may be more sus-\nceptible to fractures initiated by buckling instability in\nelderly women if they fall with impact on the greater tro-\nchanter.\n"
