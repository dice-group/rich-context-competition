Intensive\npopulation-wide monitoring and longitudinal tracking of diabetes\nare imperative for course correcting the disease and represent a\nsignificant extension of current reporting practice and capacity.\nWe test a low-cost and scalable model of citizen science [4] for\ndiabetes research and surveillance by launching and promoting a\ndata-sharing software application into an established online\ninternational community of people with diabetes. Unprecedented\nuptake by consumers of online social networking (SN) through\nsocial media websites like Facebook and MySpace represents an\nopportunity to engage populations in citizen science health\nresearch [5]. Our attempt is to assess the willingness of members\nof social networks to participate, as a distributed population of\ncitizens--lay observers and patients--in public health reporting\nabout diabetes to augment clinical observation undertaken within\nstructured samples. We focus on a disease-specific online SN site.\nThis type of site provides a vehicle for communities with strong\nimpulses to advance health and may be an important untapped\nresource for research: sites operate independently of formal health\ncare and information systems, serve as virtual support groups for\nsubstantial numbers of patients and/or caregivers [6] [7] and,\nwhile not intended as channels for specific programs to influence\nknowledge, behavior or beliefs, nor for surveillance or research\nthey are evolving. For example, PatientsLikeMe, a network\ncreated for patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [8], now\nactively recruits members for patient-driven observational studies\nand even biological sample collection.\nWe tested an SN-mediated approach to research sharing,\nfocusing on a very simple idea: that we could facilitate a ``data\ndonation drive'' to enable community wide surveillance of\nvariation in a standard measure of glycemic control, the\nglycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c or A1c). The A1c provides a\nmeasures of the average blood glucose present over the past three\nmonths, serving as a diagnostic marker of diabetes and is\nassociated prospectively with risk for diabetes complications [9]\n[10]. Incremental reductions in A1c% have been associated with\nreduced risk for diabetes related complications in rigorous\nprospective research [11], underscoring the importance of careful\ntracking of this indicator. For this purpose, we developed a\nsoftware application to allow members of an international online\ndiabetes SN site to report about and share disease information for\ncohort and community research as part of their SN activity. We\nexamined reactivity of the sample to outreach efforts, uptake\npatterns by country and state, patterns of data sharing and re-\ncontact permissions set by users and the associations among these\nfactors and health status--information vital to understanding\nselection and reporting biases for this new approach. We also\nundertook preliminary analyses of comparability of network-\nsourced aggregate data with aggregate data from a structured\nhealth reporting system and sample. We hypothesized high\nwillingness to participate and share information and a gradient\nin information sharing among application users such that\nparticipants selecting highly public sharing conditions would\nreport better diabetes health metrics than participants selecting\nmore private sharing conditions, at least initially. We also\nhypothesized that despite the likely inherent selection bias\nsuggested by the medium and model, aggregate levels of glycemic\ncontrol reported by project participants would resemble aggregate\nmetrics obtained using a national structured reporting system and\nsample. Our aim was to lay the groundwork for longitudinal study\nusing an engaged cohort of social network members and test the\nfeasibility of this model for rapid reporting of health metrics for\nhealth research and as a source of personal and contextualized\nfeedback to the online community.\nMethods\nTest Site and Sample\nThe test site is www.TuDiabetes.org, an international online\ndiabetes social network. Founded in March, 2007, it is operated by\nthe not-for-profit Diabetes Hands Foundation. At the launch of\nour project, TuDiabetes had 14,678 members. The majority of\nwebsite use is by members in the US (77% of website visits) but\nalso Canada (6%), the UK (4%), Australia (1%), and other\ncountries. In the US, California has the most visits (13%), followed\nby New York (8%), Texas (7%), and Florida (5%). Persons ages 18\nand over are eligible for membership; younger persons are\nrequired to join with a parent/guardian. Membership comprises\nprimarily patients with a minority of members (approximately\n15%) joining as significant others or friends of persons with\ndiabetes. The website contains news articles, blogs, and discussion\nforums, and allows one to create an online profile to interact with\nother members.\nNetwork members are eligible to use the TuAnalyze application\nif they meet membership criteria for TuDiabetes\u00adare at least 18\nyears old, speak and read English, have internet access and are\naffected by diabetes as a patient, family member or friend of\nsomeone with diabetes. The network uses a team of volunteer\nmembers to review membership applications and member\nactivities in an attempt to limit the presence in the community\nof persons seeking to profit from engaging with the community in a\nduplicitous or non-transparent fashion.\nSoftware Application Overview\nThe TuDiabetes network is built on Ning, a software platform\nfor creating custom social networks. Ning implements the widely-\nadopted OpenSocial standard for online social networks, hence\nconferring generalizability to applications we develop for it. As do\nFacebook and MySpace members, TuDiabetes members routinely\nadd software applications developed by third parties to their\nprofile. We developed and deployed a novel application\nTuAnalyze, which enables members to report and share\nbiomedical data with the community under a consented model.\nTuAnalyze is also a bidirectional communication link between the\nonline community and a research or public health team. The\napplication operates within the TuDiabetes website and is\nplatform-independent. TuAnalyze uses an innovative approach\nto managing patient autonomy and confidentiality in that the\nbackend of the software application is a personally controlled\nhealth record [12,13]. We leverage the INDIVO personally\ncontrolled health record's fine grained, user-managed access\ncontrols to enable consented sharing of data with the community,\nresearch teams, or public health. Figure 1 provides a schematic of\nthe main activity flows of the application. When a user has agreed\nto share their information a query/poll across the personal health\nrecords returns consented results. An important feature of\nTuAnalyze is biosurveillance-derived display of live, aggregate,\ngeo-referenced data back to the community for benchmarking at\ncountry, province and/or state level. Geographic areas within the\nmap (e.g., a US state or Canadian province) illuminate with\ndescriptive displays once a sufficient sample of participants from\nthat area engages and shares data. Illumination of regions of the\nmap is tied to TuAnalyze participation: a critical mass of\nTuDiabetes members is required to illuminate a region to protect\nindividual identity, incent ongoing engagement, and provide a\ngraphical and tabular data context against which engaged users\ncan compare themselves. There is growing evidence that patients\nand consumers are interested in making such comparisons [8,14].\nThe displays are created from aggregated permissioned data\npolled across personally controlled health records. They are\nfrequently refreshed creating a near real-time ``biosurveillance''\ndisplay of A1c levels. Individuals sharing data can view in\napplication graphs their A1c level plotted against the distribution\nin their own state.\nInformation Sharing and Permission to Re-contact Users\nfor Research\nPreferences for sharing information are flexible to accommodate\nmotivators of personal and collective benefit through affording\ndifferent uses and views of data. Three sharing settings are\nsupported among which there is a hierarchical relationship (see\nFigure 2). As a condition of application use, all participants agree\nto share data for research purposes under conditions of strict\nidentity protection (level one, the default setting). Users can also\nopt to share their personal information with aggregate charts,\ngraphs and maps for display within the community where data are\nanonymized and individual identity is protected (level two).\nFinally, users can choose to share their information in the above\nmanner and on their network profile, to be visible according to the\nprivacy settings that govern that page (level three). In this least\nrestrictive condition, anyone a user permits to see their profile\npage can see information entered in the application. Users can set\ntheir preference for being re-contacted about future research\nparticipation as part of the application interface. The default\nsetting is to permit re-contact and prompts users to confirm or\nchange this setting.\nData Sharing in an Online Diabetes Social Network\nSources of Data and Health Measurement (A1c)\nStudy data draw on three sources and sets of measures. The first\nset of data is from the TuAnalyze application and includes self-\nreports of most recent and past A1c values, user-set selections\ngoverning research participation, privacy/sharing settings and re-\ncontact, and TuAnalyze metadata about application use (e.g.,\njoining date, number of A1cs entered). The main health metric,\nA1c, is an excellent summary statistic for personal and population\nmonitoring of diabetes including in self-reported form [15,16].\nThe application user interface supports A1c reporting on a\ncontinuous scale, with associated data fields describing date\n(month/year) of both A1c lab test and TuAnalyze data entry.\nThe second data category comprises metadata from the TuDia-\nbetes host site, specifically geography of membership for the\noverall community including state location for US members,\nobtained from an export of the member database provided by the\nsite administrator prior to implementing the application. Geo-\ngraphic location is requested upon creation of an account on\nTuDiabetes and may be changed at any time; these data were\nobtained as semi-structured user-entered information and were\nthen cleaned and integrated into the project database. The third\ncategory of information comprises the most recent National\nwhich includes laboratory and self-reported values for A1c among\na representative adult US sample. The 1024 NHANES A1c values\nFigure 1. Main activity flows of the TuAnalyze application. Individuals enter A1c data into the TuAnalyze application on TuDiabetes.org,\nselect sharing settings and consent to be re-contacted (A). Data flows into the Indivo PCHR (B) which provides secure backend, information storage\nand patient-controlled sharing. All data entered into the application are captured in the research data set (C); an individual's sharing setting (D)\ndetermines how and to whom their data is displayed on the TuDiabetes site (E).\nFigure 2. Sharing setting schematic.\nData Sharing in an Online Diabetes Social Network\nthose individuals with both values (n = 192), the average of the two\nwas used in comparisons. NHANES data were downloaded as a\npublicly available file from the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention website.\nSharing Toward a Citizen Science Model\nThe approach is guided by a model for engaging a distributed\npopulation of observers in research activities through reporting,\nsharing and contributing labor and computing time under a\ncollective enterprise organized around scientific discovery or gain.\nThe design builds on the intrinsic interest within online health-\nrelated social networking sites to share information for personal or\ncollective benefit [17,18] and/or as an expression of ``information\naltruism'' [19] [20]. The social network mediated model is distinct\nfrom a more general sentinel surveillance model in which citizens\nreport about their health to a central authority using a web-\ninterface or survey, as is being done under the Gripenet project\ncentered on influenza [21]. The TuAnalyze cycle of data entry,\nprocessing, sharing and contextualization are assumed to reinforce\nongoing engagement in a virtuous cycle of collaborative research.\nThe spirit of collective enterprise is further reinforced through:\nN ``branding'' of the application in relation to the host social\nnetwork\nN promotion and reinforcing activities of the host network and\nrestriction around use of the application and participation to\nSN community members\nN opportunity to self-identify within the community as a\nparticipant in the project\nN visualization of participants' contributed data, de-identified\nand aggregated, within the community pool of data\nN opportunity to contextualize personal information relative to\nlarger community aggregates.\nThe Data Donation Drive\nCommunity engagement in the effort was pursued in May 2010\nthrough publication on the site of multiple open broadcast\nannouncements to the community alerting them to the availability\non the site of the research application and overall project. These\ninitial promotional activities occurred during the first four weeks\nand included publication by the site administrator of a news\narticle, banner text, forum posts and a blog entry about the\nproject, and email communication to the membership. Addition-\nally, the community newsletter featured an article about\nTuAnalyze. Open promotion was followed in June 2010 with\nmore targeted outreach using Twitter to encourage continuing\ncommunity uptake and emails and direct messages to location-\nbased groups to encourage state level engagement sufficient to\nlight up various regions of map displays. The promotional\ncommunications emphasized the voluntary nature of participation,\nthe strict controls over privacy and sharing, and used a non-\njudgmental tone around sharing and levels of A1c to encourage a\nbroad range of community members to participate.\nAnalyses\nThe study period was the first three months of the application's\navailability. Analyses consider all users given the international\nmembership of the host network and sub-analyses of US users, the\nlargest initial user group. For US only analyses, we examined state\nlevel engagement in the application and tested for differences\nbetween the national percentage of TuDiabetes members using\nthe application and each by-state average, testing for differences in\naverage A1c among participants from states whose uptake patterns\nof the application are below, above and equivalent to the national\npattern. Also for US members, we estimated the average A1c and\ncompared that to the value estimated from the most recent\ncharacterize engagement with the application over time and by\ngeography, sharing settings and diabetes health metrics. The exact\nbinomial test was used to compare US state-level application use to\nthe mean. ANOVA was used to compare A1c across the three\ngroups of representative and non-representative states and the\nthree levels of sharing. Differences in A1c by location, research\ncontact settings, number of values entered, join period, currency of\nvalue, and source (TuAnalyze or NHANES) were examined using\nthe two-sample t-test. Chi square tests were used to compare\napplication settings and use by location (US and non-US). All data\nwere analyzed using SAS version 9.2.\nAll study activities were reviewed and approved by the\nChildren's Hospital Boston Committee on Clinical Investigation\nunder a model of implied consent that was based on the pre-\nexisting norms for sharing in the community and in alignment\nwith the published privacy policy and terms of use of the site that\nclearly inform the community about conditions for sharing data\nand privacy protections.\nResults\nInitial uptake of the TuAnalyze application by nationality,\nUS state\nIn the initial study period, 1,136 members engaged with the\nTuAnalyze application and 1,062 entered into it at least one A1c\nvalue. The individuals using the application represent TuDiabetes\nmembers from 32 countries and all 50 US states. Entered values\ndescribe A1cs measured anywhere between 0 days to 7 years prior\nto data entry. 83.1% of the most recent values entered by users\nwere ``current'', meaning reported values were obtained within 90\ndays of data entry. A substantial majority of application users\n(89.7%) began using the application within 30 days of launch.\nEngagement in this initial period aligns with outreach and\npromotion activities to the TuDiabetes community (see Figure 3,\ncumulative application uptake synced to promotion in the first 30\ndays).\nUptake of the TuAnalyze application is on a rolling basis\nprospectively and estimating participation requires specification of\na denominator. Of 14,678 registered TuDiabetes members at\nlaunch, 40\u00ad50% were considered to be ``active'' members based\non application to the total site membership of the logged traffic for\nrepeat site visits obtained using a web analytic system [22]. Thus\nan unconstrained estimate of participation is 17% (n = 1,136 of an\nmembers received a targeted newsletter promotion about the\napplication. Thus a constrained estimate of initial participation is\nparticipation level is likely to be somewhere between these two\nestimated levels.\nUS members make up 90% of the TuAnalyze population;\nCanada, Great Britain, and Australia represent the three largest\npopulations of non-US users (respectively, 3.5%, 1%, and 0.75%).\nOf the US TuDiabetes population at launch (n = 10,223),\napproximately 4,600 were considered to be active during the\nThe proportion of US users picking up the application at the state\nlevel was proportionate to this overall level in all but four states,\none of which was underrepresented and the other three were\nData Sharing in an Online Diabetes Social Network\noverrepresented. Together, the membership in these four states\ncomprised 21% of the overall TuAnalyze US users.\nMultiple A1c values were entered by 14.5% of all TuAnalyze\nusers (n = 154) upon first entering any data (n = 77) and/or in a\nreturn visit to the application (n = 90). Of all users with multiple\nvalues, 45% returned to the application to enter at least one\nprospectively measured A1c (i.e., a value obtained after starting to\nuse the application). Non-US users were more likely than US users\nSharing and Re-contact Settings\nOverall, 81.4% of TuAnalyze users chose to include their data\nin charts, graphs and maps describing the community with 34.1%\nof the total also sharing their personal A1c data on their profile\npage. The remaining 18.6% of users opted out of community\nsharing entirely but agreed to have their data included in the\nresearch data set. The distribution amongst the three privacy\noptions (Table 1) was comparable for US and foreign users\n(p = 0.29). Despite the community map featuring only the United\nStates during the study period, the proportion of users inside and\noutside of the US who opted to share their A1c data with the\ncommunity on the aggregate map was not significantly different\n(p = 0.20). 95% of both the US and overall population have\npermitted re-contact about further research studies.\nGlycemic Control\nAverage A1c among users was 6. 9% (Table 1) and did not\ndiffer between US and non-US TuAnalyze users (p = .69). The US\nstates with disproportionately high or low levels of uptake did not\ndiffer from the rest of the states with respect to average A1c\n(p = .23). In both the total sample and the US population, users\nwho entered multiple A1c values into the application had on\naverage a lower most recent A1c than those who had entered only\none. Very early adopters (i.e., those picking up the application\nwithin the first two weeks following its launch) also had a lower\naverage A1c than did participants who picked up the application\nlater in its diffusion in both groups. Among very early adopters\nthere was no association between glycemic control and sharing/\nprivacy setting.\nIn the population as a whole, less restrictive privacy settings\nwere associated with better self-reported measures of glycemic\ncontrol. Users selecting the most permissive sharing option\n(profile-display) had a lower average A1c (6.8%) than users with\nthe most restrictive setting (7.1%, p = .038). However, this\nUS sample which may indicate insufficient power.\nComparability\nThe average A1c for US TuAnalyze users (6.9%) was\ncomparable to the unadjusted average A1c of adults with a\nNHANES (6.9%, p = 0.85). There were no differences between\naggregate TuAnalyze and aggregate NHANES data in subana-\nlyses that considered NHANES modality (self-report, lab, or the\naverage of the two).\nDiscussion\nIt is well established that social networks transmit norms,\nbehaviors, information and pathogens that along with other\nnetwork properties, such as social support and social capital,\nties and health outcomes or behaviors exists, novel and important\ninferences about the patterning of disease in populations can be\nmade through social network analyses [27,28]. Where a\ncommunication channel back to a source population persists,\nFigure 3. Cumulative daily uptake of the TuAnalyze application, first 31 days. *A group of users was invited to test the application in the\nweek before its official launch; 22 of them signed up for the application during that time and these make up the ``Cumulative Uptake'' on Day 1.\nData Sharing in an Online Diabetes Social Network\nour ambition of a rapid surveillance platform for ongoing\ninvestigation and translation of findings to action may be achieved.\nToward that goal, we tested a model for engaging a distributed\npopulation of lay persons and patients in reporting about diabetes\nusing a software application implemented for use by an online\ninternational diabetes SN community.\nWe found high levels of participation and sharing of personal\nhealth information for research use. There was substantial early\nadoption of the application with participation by 10%\u00ad17% of the\noverall community and 21% of the US community in the initial\nstudy period. Uptake followed targeted outreach and promotion\nsuggesting that a rapid surveillance model run on the SN platform\ncan stimulate engagement and suggesting also the importance of\nmonitoring and directing promotional activity to foster diffusion\nand sustained engagement. Extending the model to other public\nhealth actions, such as alerting, surveying, polling around adverse\nevents to support post-market drug safety surveillance and\ncomparative effectiveness studies--all of which require engaged\nsamples and a nimble structure--may be feasible. Among\nparticipants, the large majority (83%) of reported A1c measures\nwere current when reported, further supporting use of the\nmodality for rapid assessment of population health status. As\nA1c is typically measured every three months, it remains to be seen\nwhether the data set remains current as it matures past the study\nperiod. A minority of users provided a retrospective time series of\ntheir A1c when they first used the application. The low prevalence\nof this was not surprising given the application user interface\ninstructed users to enter their ``most recent A1c'' albeit the\napplication supports entry of a time series of measures. The values\nfor the most recent A1c reported by users who provided a time\nseries were lower on average than those reported by their peers\nentering only one value. Compared to users reporting one value,\nusers entering a time series may be more vigilant, better organized,\nor have better access to health information and testing resources.\nThough differences in A1c between groups seem small, on a\npopulation level these differences translate to substantial health\nimpacts.\nFour fifths (83.1%) of users are actively choosing to share their\ndata with others in the community and switched from the default\nsharing setting (research only) to either sharing data with\ncommunity charts or graphs or profile display. Thus, a strong\nnorm of sharing for research does not equal a blanket norm of\nopenness. This is consistent with prior findings of high willingness\nto share personal health information for research conditioned by\nperceptions of autonomy, anonymity, context and purpose [29].\nProvision for user control over data sharing through the\napplication is a marked improvement over standard practice\namong diabetes social networking sites wherein sites commonly\nshare member data and provide few if any user controls [6]. As\nhypothesized, users selecting the most restrictive sharing settings\nhad on average worse self-reported measures of glycemic control\nthan users who selected more public/less restrictive settings. Thus,\ndata shared within the community may be slightly skewed toward\na better overall health metric. This may reflect myriad factors\nincluding embarrassment, inhibition, or concern for adverse\nconsequences from disclosure, as found in prior research on\nconsumer-centered health information technologies [14]. Ability\nto discern these biases is vital to successful use of this approach and\nwill help protect against validity threats to inferences made about\ndata from the community. Equally vital is learning how best to\nengage populations in worse health that may not yet be\nparticipating and that may require a greater understanding of\nthe approach and its privacy-preserving provisions.\nIn the US, differences in engagement with the application by\ngeography were few and not associated with health status. While\nthe majority of users are from the US, the model has captured an\ninternational community and engagement may grow once country\nor regional participation is sufficient to trigger international\nillumination of mapping displays which provide incentive and\ncontext.\nUnadjusted aggregates of glycemic control in the community\nwere not different from unadjusted aggregates from the most\nrecent NHANES panel and this finding holds true for lab and self-\nreported subsamples of NHANES data. Before inferences about\ncomparability are drawn, additional data that describe disease\ntype, course, history and demographics will need to be collected\nand controlled in analyses. This will be possible as the application\nmatures to include a survey tool and other features. For this first\nreport, we note that the TuAnalyze model engaged an\nequivalently sized sample in a highly accelerated time period\nusing a community-based approach that supports permissioned\nrecontact. This model enriched by additional demographic\ninformation may comprise a rapid assessment complement to\ntraditionally structured research efforts.\nThe TuAnalyze software will allow integration of professionally-\nsourced health system data in the near future through activation of\nthe personally controlled health record system platform on the\nbackend. This expansion, plus the integration of survey data into\nthe application interface, will afford opportunity to validate patient\nentered information against health services data and enable a truly\ncomprehensive diabetes monitoring system with twinned lenses of\nclinic and citizen-consumer.\nTable 1.

The TuAnalyze population comprises consumers who\nmay be highly motivated to achieve good glycemic control and\nwhose degree of technological savvy and digital comfort may be\nunrepresentative of the general population of persons with\ndiabetes. Participation biases limit our ability to generalize but\nthey enable this research and learning about them is vital to\nadvancing this model. Data on participation in a distributed\ncommunity with changing membership and participation are\nnecessarily limited by challenges in ascertaining a reliable\ndenominator that describes persons exposed to the site or active\nduring a given time period. Levels provided for this analysis are\nbracketed by likely upper and lower bounds but are estimates:\nreliable counts of registered members are available but not all\nmembers were active during the study period or ``at risk'' of being\nnotified about a new application. Data are self-reported and\nanalyses do not yet adjust for demographics, diabetes type and\ndisease course factors. Collection of these data was not supported\nunder the initial application which prioritized a test of engagement\nwith the model and near real-time processing and return of A1c in\na model that supports contextualized reporting back to the\ncommunity. Future work will include a broader set of analyses on\ndemographically adjusted data, enabled by expanding the\nTuAnalyze application to include a survey tool and other features.\nThe test site defines itself as a single community and we need to\nstudy whether the findings generalize to other online communities,\nincluding ones that may contain patients with other health\nproblems including diseases that may be highly socially stigma-\ntized. Nevertheless, the site and sample represent considerable\ninternational and geographic spread.\nConclusions\nThe participatory model employed in TuAnalyze is centered on\nbuilding a research relationship with an engaged cohort to foster\nprospective study, ongoing communication and flexibility sufficient\nto accommodate an evolving study protocol or measurement\nmodel and diffusion and translation of findings. Our approach,\nwherein data is sourced from a volunteer, consented cohort, is\ndistinct from data mining of web content where users have no\nvoice, control or opportunity for follow-up. It also differs from\nregistries of clinically tethered populations which provide few\nopportunities for real-time patient input or expansion beyond\ninstitutionally bound patient populations. Clinical registries\nprovide vital clinically observed metrics but they typically lack\npatient-reported outcomes and generally do not provide registry\ndata back to patients; moreover, the timing and tempo of clinical\ninterviews and observations follow a research visit timeline as\nopposed to the calendar of the patient and her experiences. The\nTuAnalyze model, which provides for patient reporting and\naggregate feedback on a flexible time schedule could provide a\nboon to public health and research and complement these other\napproaches.\nLeveraging the medium's power to sustain engagement and\nfoster consented reporting and communication may offset cost,\nlabor and processing demands associated with large sample\nprospective data collection and ameliorate research challenges\nrelated to: a) recruiting and maintaining study cohorts and\nsamples; b) moving beyond inflexible and single disease data\nmodels that are difficult to modify or extend once in the field; c)\nresponding rapidly and at scale to emerging health phenomena or\nfindings; and, d) ``closing the loop'' between collection and analysis\nof research data and translation or communication of findings to\nsource populations. No one model may be sufficient to address the\nproblem of diabetes but strategic use of a range of approaches may\nhelp ``steer the ship'' as we address a global pandemic.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: ERW BA KDM.
