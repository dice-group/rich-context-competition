Whether there have\nbeen changes in the prevalence of earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) during\nthis period is uncertain.\nObjective To update the estimated prevalence of CKD in the United States.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional analysis of the most recent Na-\nMain Outcome Measures Chronic kidney disease prevalence was determined based\non persistent albuminuria and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR).\nPersistence of microalbuminuria (30 mg/g) was estimated from repeat visit data in\nDiet in Renal Disease Study equation reexpressed to standard serum creatinine.\nResults The prevalence of both albuminuria and decreased GFR increased from 1988-\n(0.25%-0.45%) for stage 4. A higher prevalence of diagnosed diabetes and hyperten-\nsion and higher body mass index explained the entire increase in prevalence of albumin-\nuria but only part of the increase in the prevalence of decreased GFR. Estimation of GFR\nfrom serum creatinine has limited precision and a change in mean serum creatinine ac-\ncounted for some of the increased prevalence of CKD.\nthan it was in 1988-1994. This increase is partly explained by the increasing preva-\nlence of diabetes and hypertension and raises concerns about future increased inci-\ndence of kidney failure and other complications of CKD.\nof the condition.

Estimated GFR is\nis either black or not black. Values that\ntruncated at that level and individuals\nwere classified using standard crite-\nria.1 Individuals with estimated GFR be-\nwere excluded because estimates of this\nstage are likely to be unreliable due to\nthe small number of individuals and the\nlikelihood that many of these individu-\nals are ill or receiving dialysis and would\nhave a low response rate.\nA random spot urine sample was ob-\ntained from participants examined at a\nmobile examination center using a\nclean-catch technique and sterile con-\ntainers. Frozen nonhematuric speci-\nmens were analyzed. Urine albumin and\ncreatinine concentrations were mea-\nsured in the same laboratory during all\nsurveys. Albumin was measured by\nsolid phase fluorescence immunoas-\nsay and urine creatinine was mea-\nsured by the modified kinetic Jaffe\nmethod using a Synchron AS/Astra Ana-\nlyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton,\nCalifornia). Urinary albumin-to-\ncreatinine ratio was computed and is re-\nported in milligrams per gram. Albu-\nminuria is defined as an albumin-to-\ncreatinine ratio of 30 mg/g or higher,\nwith microalbuminuria defined as an\nalbumin-to-creatinine ratio of 30 mg/g\nto 299 mg/g, and macroalbuminuria de-\nfined as an albumin-to-creatinine ra-\nPersistent albuminuria was defined\nas kidney damage (CKD stages 1-2).\nRepeated measurements obtained ap-\nproximately 2 weeks after the original\nused to estimate the persistence of mi-\ncroalbuminuria as described previ-\nindividuals with persistent albumin-\nuria was calculated as the proportion\nwith albuminuria at a single visit \n50.9% for those with microalbumin-\nuria and an estimated GFR of more\nthose with microalbuminuria and an es-\nbuminuria regardless of estimated GFR.\nThese same persistence estimates were\napplied to both surveys and all age, sex,\nand race groups thereby influencing\nonly the prevalence of CKD stages 1\nand 2 but not trends over time or as-\nsociations with other factors.

Fasting glu-\ncose (available for only half of the par-\nticipants) and measured blood pres-\nsure were not used in the primary\nanalysis but yielded similar results in\nsensitivity analyses (data not shown).\nStatistical Analyses\nAnalyses were performed incorporat-\ning the sampling weights to obtain un-\nbiased estimates from the complex\nNHANES sampling design using Stata\nversion 8.2 (StataCorp, College Sta-\ntion, Texas). The SEs for all estimates\nwere obtained using the Taylor series\n(linearization) method following\nNHANES recommended procedures\nand weights.16-18 Estimates and SEs were\nobtained for each survey period. Com-\nparisons across surveys and 95% con-\nfidence interval (CI) estimates for CKD\nstages incorporating persistence data on\nmicroalbuminuria were made using\nbootstrap methods implemented in\nStata.

One explanation\ncould be that the MDRD Study equa-\ntion performs differently in various eth-\nnic and racial groups. Mexican Ameri-\ncans and Native Americans in particular\nwere not represented in the MDRD\nStudy in which the equation was de-\nveloped. Nonetheless, the MDRD Study\nviduals and showed little bias among\nblacks.26 An underestimate in whites\nand women may explain some of the\nhigher prevalence in these groups. It has\nbeen hypothesized that the lower preva-\nlence of CKD among blacks could be\ndue to hyperfiltration and faster pro-\never, differential errors in GFR estima-\ntion cannot be ruled out. Studies\nmeasuring GFR in population-based\nsamples of individuals of different eth-\nnicities and ages are needed. Adjust-\nment for all risk factors explained nearly\nthe entire increase in the prevalence of\nalbuminuria but only a fraction of the\nincrease in the prevalence of low esti-\nmated GFR (Table 4). This is partly ex-\nplained by the stronger association of\ndiabetes with albuminuria compared\nwith low GFR. In addition, albumin-\nuria and low GFR show opposite asso-\nciations with non-Hispanic black and\nMexican American race/ethnicity.\nThe CKD prevalence estimates re-\nported herein are higher than those re-\nprevalence based on the recent\ncalibration to standard serum creati-\nnine concentration is 10.0% com-\npared with a prevalence of 8.8% re-\nported previously using the same\ncriteria. This difference is the result of\na difference between the initial calibra-\ntion of serum creatinine concentra-\ntion to the MDRD Study Beckman Syn-\nchron CX3 method for assaying\ncreatinine and the most recent calibra-\ntion to the Roche Enzymatic method.28\nThe new calibration resulted in higher\nwas conducted during a single month\nof the survey rather than a random\nsample of specimens from throughout\nthe survey period. Thus, only recently\nhas there been data from a panel of\nmasked frozen specimens from each\nsurvey analyzed at a single laboratory\nto provide a direct comparison of se-\nrum creatinine concentration across all\nof the surveys. The high correlation be-\ntween the original creatinine mea-\nsures and the assays performed for cali-\nport to our ability to make reliable com-\nparisons. The prevalence estimates pre-\nsented herein differ from those in a\nrecent brief report,29 which also ana-\nlyzed NHANES data, for 3 main rea-\nsons: we estimated CKD stage 1 or 2\nbased on persistent albuminuria rather\nthan counting all individuals with mi-\ncroalbuminuria; we used the MDRD\nStudy equation expressed in standard\ncreatinine because it corresponds to the\ncalibration of NHANES serum creati-\nnine concentration to standard creati-\nnine; and we also estimated the effect\nof a conservative trends analysis, which\nindicates much of the change in the\nprevalence of CKD is related to a subtle\nbut influential difference in the esti-\nmate mean serum creatinine concen-\ntration of the population.\nDespite an updated laboratory cali-\nbration traceable to criterion standard\nreference methods using a random\nsample of specimens from each\nNHANES survey, small residual differ-\nences in laboratory measurements\nacross surveys cannot be ruled out. In-\ncreased muscle mass or increased pro-\ntein intake could also have increased the\nmean serum creatinine concentration.\nLaboratory or non\u00adkidney-related ef-\nfects on serum creatinine concentra-\ntion were of particular concern be-\ncause there was a higher mean standard\nserum creatinine concentration in the\nparticipants without diagnosed diabe-\ntes or hypertension. The persistence of\nthe increase in CKD prevalence from\nequalizing the mean serum creatinine\nconcentration in a conservative trends\nanalysis supports the conclusion that\nthe increase in CKD prevalence is real.\nHowever, CKD prevalence estimates are\nsensitive to small differences in serum\ncreatinine concentration and the mag-\nnitude of the increase in prevalence\ncould be smaller than that suggested by\na simple comparison across surveys.\nThe new data on trends in CKD pro-\nvide a larger context for trends in kid-\nney failure treated by dialysis and trans-\nplantation.

It is\npatients with prevalent disease.30 Our\nanalysis suggests that the increasing\nprevalence of diabetes is already lead-\ning to a measurable increase in the ear-\nlier stages of CKD (stages 1-4).\nInterpretation of the high preva-\nlence of CKD in the US population\nshould take into account its wide spec-\ntrum of disease severity, etiology, and\ncomorbid conditions. Within CKD\nstages 1 and 2, persistent microalbu-\nminuria outnumbers macroalbumin-\nuria approximately 9 to 1. Although al-\nbuminuria is the strongest risk factor\nfor CKD progression, it is also associ-\nated with an increased risk of cardio-\nvascular morbidity and mortality.13\nChronic kidney disease stages 3 and 4\nare marked by complications of re-\nduced GFR. Chronic kidney disease\nstage 3 outnumbers CKD stage 4 ap-\nproximately 20 to 1; within stage 3, the\nupper half of estimated GFR outnum-\nbers the lower half by 3 to 1. In one\nstudy,13 CKD stage 4 was associated\nwith a 17.6% risk of progression to kid-\nney failure and a 45.7% mortality risk\nduring a mean follow-up of 3 years. By\ncontrast, in CKD stage 3, the risk for\nprogression to kidney failure was 1.1%\nbut the mortality risk was 24.3% com-\ntively, in patients without CKD.

However, by as-\nsuming the same persistence in the dif-\nferent surveys, the trends observed can-\nnot be the result of changes in estimated\npersistence rate of microalbuminuria.\nDifferential nonresponse, particularly\nlower response among sicker individu-\nals, could have biased the present preva-\nlence estimates.

The high prevalence of CKD over-\nall, and particularly among older\nindividuals and persons with hyper-\ntension and diabetes, suggests that CKD\nneeds to be a central part of future pub-\nlic health planning.\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Coresh had full access to all\nof the data in the study and takes responsibility for the\nintegrityofthedataandtheaccuracyofthedataanalysis.\nStudy concept and design: Coresh, Selvin.\nAcquisition of data: Coresh, Selvin, Manzi, Stevens,\nEggers, Van Lente.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Coresh, Selvin,\nStevens, Manzi, Kusek, Eggers, Levey.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Coresh, Selvin.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important in-\ntellectual content: Coresh, Selvin, Stevens, Manzi,\nKusek, Eggers, Van Lente, Levey.\nStatistical analysis: Coresh, Selvin.\nObtained funding: Coresh, Kusek, Eggers, Levey.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: Stevens,\nEggers, Van Lente, Levey.\nStudy supervision: Coresh, Levey.\nFinancial Disclosures: None reported.\nFunding/Support: The research for this study was sup-\nbetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
