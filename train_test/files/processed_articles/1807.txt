Bautista (lebautista@wisc.edu)\n\u00a9 2008 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.\nLong-term control of elevated arterial pressure results in large\nreductions in morbidity and mortality attributable to hyperten-\nsion.1 However, only 57% of known hypertensive patients receiv-\ning pharmacologic treatment in the United States have their\nblood pressure controlled.2 It is estimated that 15% of all cases\nof acute myocardial infarction3 and 32% of all strokes4 among\nsubjects treated for hypertension can be attributed to uncon-\ntrolled blood pressure. Failure by patients to use medications as\nprescribed is considered a major contributor to poor control of\nhypertension and lessens the effectiveness of antihypertensive\ndrugs in preventing stroke, coronary heart disease, and chronic\nkidney disease.5 In fact, simulation studies suggest that improv-\ning compliance with existing antihypertensive medication could\nbe more beneficial than using an ideal antihypertensive drug,\ni.e., a drug that makes the quality-adjusted life expectancy of a\nhypertensive person similar to that of a non-hypertensive.6\nNon-adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medication is\nhighly prevalent. Patients may either modify or miss medication\ndoses in the context of ongoing use (non-compliance) or may\nprematurely discontinue therapy completely (non-persistence).7\nPharmacy claims data have been frequently used to estimate\ncompliance as the ratio of total days of medication supplied to\ntotal days in a period of time (medication possession ratio).7 In\na recent study among new hypertensive patients enrolled in a\nsingle health insurance plan, Grant et al. found a 35% cumula-\ntive non-compliance (medication possession ratio <80%) over\nan average follow-up of 40 months.8 Similarly, in a large study\namong patients from the Department of Veteran's Affairs com-\nclaims databases have also been used to identify patients who\nstop filling out their prescription medication for a predefined\nperiod of time (non-persistent). Recent studies using this\napproach have shown that 32\u00ad53% of newly treated hyperten-\nsives stop using their medication by the end of the first year of\nSeveral factors have been associated with antihypertensive\ntreatment non-compliance and non-persistence. However,\nresults from previous studies of non-adherence are of limited\ngeneralizability because they have been conducted mostly\namong middle-aged and elderly patients enrolled in a single\ntle information on the effects of enabling factors such as health\ninsurance, income, and use of health services, since all partici-\npants were insured and received total or partial reimbursement\narticles Persistence With Antihypertensive Therapy\nfor prescribed medications.9,12,14 Moreover, findings from pre-\nvious studies12,13 may not apply to current practice, since the\npattern of medication prescription and use has likely changed\nduring the last decade as a consequence of increasing aware-\nness of the benefits of blood pressure reduction, new practice\nguidelines, and availability of newer drugs with less undesirable\nside effects.15,16 This study used data from the National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) to evaluate the\nrole of factors that describe the propensity of patients to comply\nwith treatment recommendations (predisposing factors); factors\nthat comprise the resources available to help patients in obtain-\ning health care and medications (enabling factors); and factors\nthat reflect the patients' requirements for care and medication\n(need characteristics).17\nMethods\nAnalyses in this article are based on data from NHANES III\nhave a similar design but are conducted in yearly waves. Also,\na unique set of weights is available for combining the data from\nis selected through a complex multistage design based on pri-\nmary sampling units (counties), household segments within\nthe counties, and finally, sampled persons from selected house-\nholds. This design is aimed to obtain a representative sample\nof the civilian non-\ninstitutionalized population of the United\nStates. African Americans, Mexican Americans, people of age\nare oversampled to obtain precise estimates in these groups.\nNHANES participants provided informed consent and the data\ncollection procedures are approved by the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention Institutional Review Board as ensuring\nconfidentiality.\nThis analysis includes NHANES participants who reported they\nhad been diagnosed with hypertension and advised by their phy-\nsicians to use antihypertensive medication (n = 6,733). Trained\nNHANES interviewers verified the medications being used during\nthe 30 days prior to the survey date by direct inspection of medi-\ncation containers. Individuals who did not use antihypertensive\nmedication during that period were classified as non-persistent.\nA group of 571 participants who were not taking antihypertensive\nmedication and had normal blood pressure during the physical\nexam (systolic blood pressure <140 and diastolic blood pressure\n<90mmHg) was excluded. These participants were likely normo-\ntensives or hypertensives who had their blood pressure control-\nled by non-pharmacologic therapy. They would have been falsely\nclassified as cases of non-persistence, and their inclusion would\nhave biased the observed associations towards the null. Pregnant\nwomen (n = 14) and subjects without medication use data were\nalso excluded (n = 48). The analysis was aimed at identifying the\nindependent effect of predisposing factors (age, gender, ethnicity,\neducation, marital status, language, alcohol intake, and smoking),\nenabling factors (average family annual income, having health\ninsurance, and visits to the doctor during the last year), and need\n\ncharacteristics (body mass index, self-reported health status, and\ncoexisting chronic disease). People with a history of diseases that\nrequire regular and persistent use of medications were classified\nas having a chronic disease. This included people with a history of\narthritis, stroke, emphysema, cancer, asthma, bronchitis, diabetes,\nor acute myocardial infarction.\nAll analyses were statistically weighted to maintain the repre-\nsentativeness of the sample for the US population, to avoid selec-\ntion bias, and to correctly estimate the precision of regression\ncoefficients. NHANES mobile examination center-examined\nsample weight values were used to adjust for the differential prob\nabilities of selection and non-response in the survey sample.19,20\nA new set of analytical weights was calculated and used in the\nanalysis to account for the fact that data came from two inde-\ncalculated as a weighted average of the original weights, fol-\nlowing the recommendation of Korn and Graubard.21 This\napproach yields unbiased and efficient estimation of popula-\ntion parameters. Although sampling weights account for non-\nparticipation, they do not account for the exclusion of subjects\nthat results from missing data on one or more variables included\nin the analysis. If subjects with missing data are excluded, the\nsum of the weights for the remaining subjects will not equal the\npopulation size and selection bias could occur.22 To avoid this\nbias, multivariate imputation by chained equations was used to\nfill out missing values and to generate 10 imputed data sets.23\nEach completed data set was analyzed independently and the\nparameters of interest were averaged across the 10 copies, using\nRubin's formula,24 to obtain a single estimate. Multiple logis-\ntic regression with sampling weights was used to estimate the\nindependent effect of each factor on non-persistence. The first\nimputed data set was used for model building and variable selec-\ntion and the resulting model was applied to the remaining data\nsets before averaging the estimates.22 The excess fraction (attrib-\nutable risk), i.e., the proportion of non-persistent cases in the\npopulation that could be reasonably associated to each factor,\nwas used to summarize the impact of enabling factors on non-\npersistence. The excess fraction was calculated as the proportion\nof exposed cases times (odds ratio (OR)-1/OR).25 All analyses\nwere conducted adjusting for the complex survey design using\nResults\nThis study includes 6,100 subjects who reported that they have\nbeen advised to take antihypertensive medication, 61.2% from\ntaking antihypertensive medication, corresponding to a sam-\npling weighted national prevalence of non-persistence of 12.5%\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure were 139 and 76mmHg,\nrespectively, in patients who were taking their antihypertensive\nmedication and 150 and 86mmHg in those who were not (P <\narticles\nPersistence With Antihypertensive Therapy\nwere men, 76% were White, and 33% had a less than high school\neducation (Table 1).

Age was\nthe stronger predictor of non-persistence in this study, with\nsubjects <30 being 12 times more likely to be non-persistent\nthan those 50 years old, independent of other risk factors.\nThe observed age effect was of the same direction but stronger\nthan the effect reported in previous studies.10,27 The stronger\nage effect observed in this study is probably a consequence of\nincluding subjects from a wider age range than those included\nPrevalence of non-persistence was 31% higher in men than\nin women. Previous studies have shown that non-persistence is\n8\u00ad12% more frequent among men but have failed to adjust for\nother predisposing and enabling factors.10,27 Although crude\nnon-persistence prevalence was significantly higher in African\nAmericans and Hispanics, the adjusted analysis showed no\nrelative increase in African Americans and a significant 43%\nincrease in Hispanics, as compared to other racial groups. An\neffect of race on treatment persistence has not been previously\nreported, but several studies have shown an increased risk of\nnon-compliance among African Americans, as compared to\nwhites.9,13,14 Unfortunately, those studies have included few or\nno Hispanics and have not taken into account important con-\nfounders. An increased non-persistence in Hispanics could be\npartly explained by communication difficulties owing to lin-\nguistic barriers and poor understanding between patient and\nphysician. Unfortunately, no data on the language spoken by\nthe treating physician were available.\nAlthough financial problems are commonly cited as a barrier\nto hypertensive care,28 most studies of antihypertensive treat-\nment adherence have been conducted in insured populations\nwith total or partial reimbursement for prescribed medications,\nlimiting the opportunity to assess the role of enabling factors such\nResults from this analysis indicate that patient with an average\nfamily income below $50,000/year were almost two times more\nlikely to be non-persistent than those with higher income. Low\nincome has been associated to lower frequency of hypertension\nscreening but did not seem to influence pharmacologic treatment\nor patient follow-up.28 Lack of health insurance was associated\nwith an 88% increase in the risk of non-persistence in the present\nstudy. This finding is consistent with poorer follow-up of treated\nhypertensives without health insurance reported in a previous\nstudy.28 An important finding of the present study was that\npatients who did not visit their \ndoctor during the year \npreceding\nthe interview were 10 times more likely to be non-\npersistent than\nthose who made at least one medical visit. In a large population\nstudy, Perreault et al. found that a greater number of \nmedical\nvisits had no significant effect, whereas \nhospitalization had a\nsignificant positive impact on persistence.10 Also, Caro et al.\nhas reported significantly increased persistence in hypertensive\npatients who visited the doctor five or more times during the\nlast year.27 Consistent results have also been observed in studies\nof compliance.13,14 These results suggest that factors that help\npatients to obtain medication and health care could significantly\nimprove treatment persistence.\nSeveral limitations must be considered in interpreting these\nresults. First, this analysis is based on a cross-sectional sample\nthat includes only those hypertensive patients who survived up\nto the time of the interview. Since survival should be higher for\npatients who remain under treatment, the results of this analy-\nsis may be different from those from a cohort study. However,\nfindings from this analysis are still useful to identify poten-\ntial determinants of persistence and high-risk groups. Second,\nthere was no way to verify whether the doctor had actually\nprescribed antihypertensive medication. However, Klungel\net al.29 compared self-reported antihypertensive drug use and\npharmacy records and found that the accuracy of self-report\nwas considerably high (sensitivity of 94.2% and specificity of\n96.3%). Therefore, this source of error should have a negligible\nimpact on the results of the present study. Third, non-persistent\npatients in this study are a mix of those who never started treat-\nment and those who stopped taking their medication for at\nleast 1 month. Whether the observed associations are different\nfor one group and the other cannot be ascertained with the\ndata at hand. Finally, the type of antihypertensive medication\nprescribed to non-persistent patients is not known. This may\nbe of relevance, since the type of antihypertensive drug influ-\nences persistence and is related to factors such as age, gender,\nTo my knowledge, this study is the first of its kind to measure\nsimultaneously the independent effect of patient's predisposing,\nenabling, and need characteristics on persistence with antihy-\npertensive medication. The main strength of this study is the\nuse of data from NHANES. Since NHANES provide nation-\nally representative samples, the findings from this analysis are\nunlikely affected by selection bias and can be extrapolated to\nthe US population. This study, in particular, overcomes the\nlimitations of previous studies that mostly comprised elderly\npeople enrolled in a health insurance plan, with less than ideal\nrepresentation of ethnic minorities. Another strength of the\npresent analysis study was the availability of high quality data\nfor the definition of the target population and the ascertain-\nment of persistence status. Specifically, hypertensive status was\ndetermined by interview and blood pressure measurements,\nand trained interviewers verified the medications being used\narticles Persistence With Antihypertensive Therapy\nby direct inspection of medication containers. Finally, I was able\nto account for the effect of multiple characteristics that influence\nthe use of antihypertensive medication, beyond those regularly\navailable in pharmacy claims databases.\nIn summary, non-persistence with antihypertensive medica-\ntion increased significantly with young age, in men, and among\nHispanics. Non-persistence was also considerably increased in\npopulations with financial barriers to the availability of health\ncare. In fact, low income, having no health insurance, and not\nvisiting the doctor during the last year accounted for more than\n50% of the cases of non-persistence. Policies that improve access\nto health care and patient follow-up may be of great importance\nin maintaining long-term persistence with antihypertensive\nmedication.\n"
