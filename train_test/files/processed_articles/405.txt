    "reduced_content": "The purpose of this research was to investigate the associations between misperception of body weight and\nsociodemographic factors such as food stamp participation status, income, education, and race/ethnicity. National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 1999\u00ad2004 and multivariate logistic regression are\nused to estimate how sociodemographic factors are associated with (i) the probability that overweight adults\nmisperceive themselves as healthy weight; (ii) the probability that healthy-weight adults misperceive themselves\nas underweight; and (iii) the probability that healthy-weight adults misperceive themselves as overweight. NHANES\ndata are representative of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population. The analysis included 4,362 men and\n4,057 women. BMI derived from measured weight and height was used to classify individuals as healthy weight or\noverweight. These classifications were compared with self-reported categorical weight status. We find that differences\nacross sociodemographic characteristics in the propensity to underestimate or overestimate weight status were more\npronounced for women than for men. Overweight female food stamp participants were more likely to underestimate\nweight status than income-eligible nonparticipants. Among healthy-weight and overweight women, non-Hispanic\nblack and Mexican-American women, and women with less education were more likely to underestimate actual weight\nstatus. We found few differences across sociodemographic characteristics for men. Misperceptions of weight are\ncommon among both overweight and healthy-weight individuals and vary across socioeconomic and demographic\ngroups. The nutrition education component of the Food Stamp Program could increase awareness of healthy body\nweight among participants.\nIntroduction\nA sizable portion of overweight Americans do not believe that\nor obese men and 23% of overweight or obese women did not\nbelieve they were overweight (1). Such misperceptions have\nbeen noted as potential barriers to addressing weight control\nproblems--it is unlikely that someone will address a problem if\nthey do not consider it to be a problem. Misperceptions about\nbody weight also provide behavioral clues about why some\ngroups may be more prone to obesity (1,2\u00ad4). For example,\nmisperceptions about overweight status (an overweight \nperson\nwho incorrectly believes he or she is a healthy weight) among\nsome subgroups may simply reflect a higher prevalence of\noverweight among those subgroups, such that people do not\nperceive themselves as heavier than their peers because their\npeers are heavier too. Or tendencies among subgroups to per-\nceive weight status incorrectly may reflect ideals of body weight\namong subgroups (5).\nOne subgroup of particular concern is those who participate\nin the Food Stamp Program. This program, which is run by the\nUS Department of Agriculture, issues monthly benefits for gro-\ncery store purchases for households with low incomes (below\n130% of Federal poverty guidelines) (6). Higher prevalence of\noverweight and obesity among some individuals who receive\nfood stamps, particularly women (7), has led to suggestions\nthat the program may need to do more to address the problem\nof obesity while ensuring adequate nutrition for low-income\nhouseholds (8). How food stamp participants perceive their\nbody weight is important for two reasons. First, if participants\nare less likely to recognize that they are overweight, they may be\nless likely to adapt behavior to maintain a healthy body weight\nor reduce weight, and may become heavier than nonpartici-\npants. Second, the Food Stamp Program includes a nutrition\neducation component. This component of the program could\nalso be used to inform participants about what is considered a\nhealthy weight and potentially help correct misperceptions.\nPrevious studies of which subgroups are prone to misper-\nceptions about their weight found differences across race/eth-\nnicity, gender, and some education and income groups (2,3).\n1Economic Research Service, US Department of Agriculture, Washington, District of Columbia, USA; 2Department of Agricultural Economics, National Taiwan\nUniversity, Taipei, Taiwan. Correspondence: Michele L. Ver Ploeg (sverploeg@ers.usda.gov)\narticles\n \nAdditionally, cross-tabulations show that overweight food\nstamp participants are more likely to perceive themselves as\nhealthy weight than nonparticipants (1). However, these cross-\ntabulations do not control for other factors that are associated\nwith food stamp participation although they are also associ-\nated with weight misperception--particularly race/ethnicity,\nincome, and education.\nIn this article, we explored the determinants of mispercep-\ntions of weight status. We expanded upon previous work in\nseveral ways. First, we considered whether one particular sub-\ngroup of public policy interest--participants in the US Food\nStamp Program--are more prone to misperceptions about\nweight status. Unlike previous work examining weight percep-\ntion among food stamp participants, we used a multivariate\nframework and controlled for factors associated with weight\nmisperception. Second, we used recent data from the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999\u00ad\n2004 to analyze the relationship between food stamp partici-\npation, other economic and demographic variables, and the\naccuracy of weight perception. This includes weight percep-\ntion among the overweight and among those who are healthy\nweight, unlike previous studies that focused on only one of\nthese two groups (2). Finally, we included an individual's mea-\nsured BMI (kg/m2) as a covariate to ensure that our results do\nnot simply reflect differences in average BMI across population\nsubgroups. This variable is important because individuals with\nBMI closer to the cutoff values for each weight status category\nmay be more likely to assess their weight status incorrectly.\nStudies of body weight misperception for the general popula-\ntion did not include this measure, although a study of severely\nobese women did and found BMI was not correlated with\n\nmisperception of body weight (9). Our study tested this vari-\nable for the general population, for whom weight status may be\nmore ambiguous compared with the severely obese.\nMethods and Procedures\nThe NHANES uses a stratified, multistage probability sampling design\nand is representative of the US civilian noninstitutionalized popula-\nWeight and height for each survey respondent were measured by\ntrained medical staff in the NHANES Mobile Examination Centers.\nBMI was calculated to classify each individual as either underweight,\nhealthy-weight, or overweight (for adults, BMI < 18.5 is underweight;\nA small percentage of adults are underweight (<2%). Because this is\nsuch a small percentage of the population and because members of\nthis group who perceive themselves as overweight are probably much\ndifferent than normal-weight individuals who perceive themselves as\noverweight, we excluded them from the study. Respondents were also\nasked whether they consider themselves \"overweight, underweight,\nor about the right weight\". Responses to this question were compared\nwith an individual's measured weight category (healthy weight or\noverweight). For overweight adults, we examined determinants of\nwhether an individual underestimated his/her weight (reports weight\nstatusaseither\"abouttherightweight\"or\"underweight\").Forhealthy-\nweight adults, we examined determinants of whether an individual\nunderestimated his/her actual weight (reports being underweight),\nand whether an individual overestimated his/her measured weight\n(reports being overweight). Misperceptions of body weight among\nboth those who are healthy weight and overweight are \nimportant.\nUnderstanding what factors are associated with \nmisperception among\nthe overweight can help explain why people are overweight. Similarly,\nunderstanding misperception among those who are healthy weight\nbut believe they are underweight or overweight can be used to under-\nstand why some have not yet become overweight (they already believe\nthey are and may take action to lose weight) or about whether they\nmay become overweight (they believe they are underweight and do\nnot change behavior to remain at a healthy weight). Studying both\npopulations also allows comparisons of whether the factors associ-\nated with underestimating weight are the same for overweight and\nhealthy-weight individuals.\nLogistic regression was used to estimate the probability of overesti-\nmating or underestimating weight status. For overweight individuals, the\nprobability of underestimating weight status was estimated. For healthy-\nweightindividuals,twoseparatelogisticmodels--theprobabilityofunder-\nestimating weight status and the probability of overestimating weight\nstatus--were estimated. Odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95%\nconfidence intervals for each covariate were reported for each model. Sta-\ntistical analyses were conducted using SUDAAN\nTriangle Park, NC) (11). Following the literature on modeling BMI, mod-\nels were estimated separately for men and for women (12\u00ad14).\nWe examined whether weight misperception differs by Food Stamp\nProgram participation and by household income. To receive food\nstamps, gross household income cannot exceed 130% of the Federal\npoverty guidelines. Consequently, we combined food stamp partici-\npation and income into four subgroups--food stamp participants,\nincome-eligible nonparticipants (income below 130% of the poverty\nguidelines), \nmoderate-income individuals (income between 130 and\n300% of the poverty guidelines), and high-income individuals (income\nexceeds 300% poverty guidelines). Food stamp participation was meas-\nured by responses to the question \"Are you now authorized to receive\nFood Stamps?\"\nOther covariates in the logistic models were race/ethnicity, (non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, or other race),\nage, self-reported current smoking status, education level (less than high\nschool, high school graduate, and some postsecondary schooling), and\nmarital status (married or single). We also included each individual's\nBMI as a covariate. Individuals with BMI closer to the cutoff values for\nweight status designation may be more likely to assess their weight status\nincorrectly. For example, we expected that individuals with a BMI of\n26 are more likely to perceive themselves as healthy weight incorrectly\ncompared with individuals with a BMI of 30. To control for this, we\nincluded a measure of the difference between measured BMI and the\nlower end of the BMI cutoff point for each weight status. For healthy-\nweight individuals, this variable is the difference between the individual's\nmeasured BMI and the lower cutoff for healthy weight (BMI = 18.5).\nFor overweight individuals, this variable is the difference between an\nindividual's measured BMI and the lower cutoff for overweight status\n(BMI = 25). This is an important improvement over the methods used\nin previous studies, which did not control for measured BMI. If among\noverweight women, non-Hispanic black women are much heavier than\nnon-Hispanic white women (such that they have greater average BMI,\nsay 30 vs. 27), we expect that more non-Hispanic white women would\nincorrectly assume they are healthy weight simply because more of them\nare near the cutoff for overweight relative to black women. Without\ncontrolling for BMI, it may appear that variation in the propensity to\noverestimate or underestimate weight status is driven by race or other\ncovariates when in reality, variation is really driven by differences in\naverage BMI levels.\nBecause only respondents over the age of 16 were asked about their\nweight status and because the BMI classifications for children under\nthe age of 20 are different from adults, our analysis only examined mis-\nperception in weight among adults aged 20. We excluded pregnant or\nbreast-feeding women. After deleting observations with missing values,\nTable 1 shows final sample size for each of the three models estimated\nseparately by gender.\narticles\n \nResults\nTable 1 shows the percentage of men and women who cor-\nrectly or incorrectly assessed their body weight status. Among\nhealthy-weight women, 32.4% reported being overweight, but\nonly 4.0% reported being underweight. For healthy-weight\nceived their own weight status, but 7.9% reported being under-\nweight. Approximately one-third of overweight men (32.9%)\nunderestimated their body weight (reported being under-\nweight or about the right weight). Among overweight women,\nonly 12.7% characterized themselves as underweight or about\nthe right weight.\nAge, education, food stamp participation, income, and\nracial/ethnic background distinguished women in their per-\nception of body weight status.

Failure\nto recognize overweight did not differ by smoking behavior or\nby martial status among overweight adults.\nHealthy-weight adults who think they are underweight\nNone of the covariates except for BMI explained variations\nin the probability that healthy-weight men misperceived\ntheir weight as \"underweight\", so we focused our attention on\nhealthy-weight women. Here we found that racial and ethnic\ndifferences in the propensity to underestimate weight status also\nexisted. Non-Hispanic black and Mexican-American women\nwere more likely (ORs are 3.81 and 3.96, respectively) to per-\nceive themselves as underweight even though they were healthy\nweight, compared with non-Hispanic white women (Table 3).\nAge had an OR of 1.04, suggesting that older healthy-weight\nwomen were slightly more likely to state they were under-\nweight than younger healthy-weight women. Relative to non-\nsmokers, healthy-weight women who smoke were more than\ntwo times as likely to believe they were underweight than\nnonsmokers (OR = 2.41). Women with high school diplo-\nmas were less likely to state they were underweight relative\nto those with less than a high school education, but there\nwere no significant differences between those with less than a\nhigh school education and women with some postsecondary\neducation. Food stamp participation was not associated with\nthe likelihood that healthy-weight women underestimate\nweight status.\ning that recognition of overweight status rose with income.\nAmong overweight men, body weight misperception did not\nvary by food stamp participation or income (Table 2).\nAmong overweight women, non-Hispanic blacks and\nMexican Americans were less likely to recognize they were\noverweight compared with non-Hispanic whites (ORs are 3.88\nand 2.24, respectively) (Figure 2). The findings, consistent\nwith previous studies (2\u00ad5,9), suggest that non-Hispanic black\nwomen and Mexican-American women perceived a higher\nBMI cutoff for \"overweight,\" compared with the BMI non-\nHispanic white women perceived as \"overweight\". Similarly,\nnon-Hispanic black men appeared to have a heavier thresh-\nold for \"overweight\" status relative to non-Hispanic white men\n(Figure 2).

For men, there was no difference in\nmisperception of overweight status between those with a high\nschool diploma and those without.\nBody weight misperception also varied by age among over-\nweight women, but not among overweight men.

Studies that have attempted to link food stamp par-\nticipation with weight gain have found no relationship or a very\nweak relationship between food stamp participation and weight\nfor men and children, but for women, participation in the pro-\ngram seems to increase BMI and the probability of obesity\nslightly (15\u00ad18). Our results indicate that misperception about\nbody weight was a potential barrier to achieving healthy weight\namong overweight women who received food stamp benefits,\nbut not among men. It is unclear why female food stamp par-\nticipants were more likely to misperceive their weight relative to\nnonparticipants. It could be the result of a \"peer effect\" if food\nstamp participants had social connections with other partici-\npants. It may also be that those who have accepted, ignored, or\nwere oblivious to any stigma attached to receiving government\nassistance like food stamps were also less worried about stigma\nthat may be attached to being overweight. Regardless, the\nhigher rates of misperception among food stamp participants\nmay be part of the reason why women who receive food stamps\nare more likely to be obese.\nFood stamp nutrition education (FSNE) is a component\nof the program that includes provisions for states to provide\nnutrition education programs to participants, and almost all\nstate agencies implement FSNE programs. FSNE programs\nare intended to help participants make healthier choices with\nrespect to food purchases, including choices to help combat\nobesity. Our results indicate that FSNE programs may provide\na useful service to participants by helping them recognize what\nbody weight is considered healthy or unhealthy. Such an inter-\nvention might include information on calculating and inter-\npreting BMI and on the health risks of overweight. The efficacy\nof such an intervention would need to be evaluated. If success-\nful, increased attention to BMI and healthy weight may help\nfood stamp participants prevent weight gain or reduce weight.\nBMI has been shown to vary by social and demographic\nfactors, including income, race and ethnicity, gender, and age\nNHANES, the average BMI for non-Hispanic blacks and non-\nHispanic whites were 33.9 and 32.1, respectively. A strong and\nconsistent finding of our study is that the higher an individual's\nBMI, the lower the probability of misperceiving overweight as\nhealthy weight. BMI is also correlated with the probability of\noverestimating and underestimating weight among those who\nare healthy weight. By including an individual's BMI (devia-\ntion from the cutoffs) in the model, we are able to improve the\nexplanatory power of our estimates of the propensity to under-\nestimate or overestimate weight status by social and demo-\ngraphic factors. Our results confirm that even after controlling\nfor BMI, non-Hispanic black women and Mexican-American\nwomen are more likely to underestimate their weight status\ncompared with non-Hispanic white women. In other words,\nnon-Hispanic black women and Mexican-American women\nare more likely to misperceive overweight as healthy weight\nand to misperceive healthy weight as underweight.\nHealthy-weight adults who think they are overweight\nRacialandethnicdifferenceswerealsonoticeableamongwomen\nwho were healthy weight but believed they were overweight\nblacks, Mexican Americans, and other race, respectively, sug-\ngesting that non-Hispanic white women were more likely\nto believe they were overweight than women of other racial/\nethnic groups. The OR for age was 0.97, suggesting that older\nwomen were less likely to perceive themselves as overweight\nthan younger women. Women with at least some postsecond-\nary schooling were more likely to perceive they were overweight\nrelative to those with less than a high school education (1.69\ntimes more likely), but there was no difference between high\nschool graduates and those with less than a high school educa-\ntion. Food stamp participation, income, and \nmarital status did\nnot explain variations in misperceiving healthy weight as over-\nweight among healthy-weight women (Table 3).\nAmong healthy-weight men, non-Hispanic black men were\nmuch less likely to believe they were overweight relative to\nnon-Hispanic white men (OR = 0.13), indicating that healthy-\nweight black men had a heavier threshold for overweight status\nthan healthy-weight white men. Among healthy-weight men,\nthose with higher BMI were more likely to perceive themselves\nas overweight. None of the other social and demographic\nvariables helped explain variations in men's misperception of\nhealthy weight as overweight.\nDiscussion\nPrevious work had shown that the determinants of adults' BMI\ndiffer by gender (12\u00ad14). Our study further suggests that mis-\nperception of body weight status also varied by gender among\nboth healthy-weight and overweight adults.

The spread of obesity in a large social network\nThe consistency of these racial/ethnic results across healthy\nweight and overweight status suggest that misperception of\nbody weight does have a social or cultural component. For\nexample, weight misperception could be a result of a \"peer\"\neffect--women base their weight status perceptions on the\nweights of their peers. It could also be evident that groups\nattach different values to a particular weight status. White\nwomen indicate they feel more pressure to be thin, are more\nlikely to diet, and have smaller ideal body sizes than black\nwomen (5,20,21). With smaller ideal body weight and more\ndieting behavior, white women may feel more pressure to be\nthinner and thus more likely to report being overweight than\nblack women, who do not have the same thinner body weight\nideals.\nLike race and ethnicity, age is also a consistent predictor of\nmisperception of weight among women. These results could\nalso suggest that peer effects may be related to misperception of\nbody weight, if women tend to form peer groups with women\nnear the same age as them. But further research is needed.\nSuch research should consider how proximate peers (both in\nterms of similar socioeconomic status and demographics and\nin terms of actual social and neighborhood proximity) affect\nmisperception of weight status, similar to how obesity has\nrecently been linked among peers (22). For example, are over-\nweight adults who live with or near many other overweight\nadults more likely to underestimate their weight? Research\non how connections across and within races, socioeconomic\nstatus, or other demographic characteristics affect perception\nof body weight may also be constructive. For example, does\nweight misperception for an individual of one race with many\nconnections to individuals of other races or ethnicities differ\nfrom those of someone who is the same race but has fewer\ncross-race connections? Further research could consider these\nquestions.\n"
