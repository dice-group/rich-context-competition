Given that 6.2 million\nAmericans are estimated to have serum creatinine\n(Cr) P1.5 mgudl [2], the consequences of CRI may\nhave important public health implications. We recently\nadults suffer from CRI-associated anaemia, defined by\na haemoglobin concentration -11 gudl [3].\nIn addition to decreased haemoglobin, reduced renal\nfunction is associated with a variety of biochemical\nabnormalities reflected by changes in serum concentra-\ntions of calcium, phosphorus, bicarbonate and potas-\nsium. However, the extent of these changes and their\nmagnitude in relation to renal function is not well\ndefined, especially among persons with mild to\nmoderate CRI. Currently, our knowledge is derived\nmostly from studies of relatively small numbers of\nindividuals observed under carefully controlled condi-\ntions (such as in a clinical research centre) [4,5] or\nfrom CRI subjects recruited from outpatient nephro-\nlogy practices [6,7]. To what extent these findings can\nbe generalized to people with CRI in the general\npopulation is unclear.\nTaking advantage of the nationally representative\ndata collected in the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), we\naimed to quantify the relationship between levels of\nCorrespondence and offprint requests to: Chi-yuan Hsu, Division of\nNephrology, University of California, San Francisco, Room 672\nEmail: hsuchi@medicine.ucsf.edu\n# 2002 European Renal Association\u00adEuropean Dialysis and Transplant Association\nrenal function and serum concentrations of calcium,\nphosphorus, bicarbonate and potassium. We hypothes-\nized that differences in one or more of these serum\nchemistries would be evident at different levels of\nrenal function, even among individuals with mild to\nmoderate CRI.\nSubjects and methods\nNHANES III population\nThe design and operation of NHANES III has been\ndescribed previously [2,8,9] (data downloaded from\nhttp:uuwww.cdc.govunchsuaboutumajorunhanesunh3data.htm#\nData Files 1a). Briefly, NHANES III provides cross-\nsectional, nationally representative data on the health and\nnutritional status of the civilian, non-institutionalized US\nin a complex survey design and 31 311 were examined. All\nNHANES III participants over the age of 12 years were\neligible for measurement of a biochemistry profile that\nincluded serum chemistries and creatinine. Examinees report-\ning haemophilia or recent cancer chemotherapy treatment\nwere excluded from the venipuncture. We included in this\nstudy only adults aged over 17 years who had a measure-\nment of serum Cr as well as all electrolytes including\nsodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, ionized calcium,\nphosphorus and albumin.\nInformation on dietary intake was assessed in NHANES\nIII through 24-h dietary recall and on medication usage\nthrough direct patient interview.\nAssessment of renal function\nSerum Cr was measured in NHANES III using the Hitachi\n737 automated analyser (Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics,\nIndianapolis, IN, USA) using a rate Jaffe reaction [10]. We\nassessed renal function as the creatinine clearance (CrCl;\nmeasured in mlumin) estimated from the Cockcroft\u00adGault\nwhere age is measured in years, weight in kg and serum Cr\nin mgudl.\nThe Cockcroft\u00adGault-estimated CrCl has been found to\ncorrelate well with measured CrCl in a wide variety of patient\npopulations, including both adult men and women (correla-\nsubjects without body weight data (0.2% of the sample), we\nassigned sex-specific median values.\nMeasurement of serum electrolytes\nBesides serum Cr, the NHANES III serum biochemistry\nprofile also included measurements of sodium, potassium,\nchloride, bicarbonate, albumin, total calcium and phos-\nphorus using the Hitachi 737 automated analyser. In\naddition, ionized calcium was measured using a NOVA\n7q7 electrolyte analyser (NOVA Biomedical, Waltham,\nMA, USA). The reported ionized calcium value was\nnormalized for serum pH, i.e. adjusted to the ionized calcium\nnormalized calcium value was calculated with the equation:\nlog wCaqqx7:4slog wCaqqxX\nwhere X was the measured pH of the sample, [Caqq]X\nwas the ionized calcium concentration in the test solution,\nwas the normalized calcium concentration at\nemployed by the microprocessor to predict normalized\ncalcium values [10]. The coefficients of variation of these\nassays were all in the order of 1\u00ad2% [10].\nNHANES III examinees were asked to fast for at least 6 h\nbefore examination. However, laboratory test results and the\nduration of the fast were reported regardless of whether the\nfast was held or not.\nData management and statistical analysis\nData management and statistical analysis were conducted\nusing SAS version 8.01 (Cary, NC, USA). NHANES III was\nnot a simple random sample of the US population and not\neveryone had the same probability of selection. Appropriate\nsample weights were therefore used to obtain weighted\nregression estimates from the sampled population. The sample\nweights also adjusted for non-coverage and non-response\n[13,14]. It was thus possible to generalize the final results\nof the analysis to the US population (although the dis-\ntribution of renal function in the study sample is not the\nsame as the distribution of renal function in the whole\nUS population).\nWe adopted the same analytical approach as in previous\nstudies [3,15]. Individuals were divided a priori into eight\ncategories of renal function by their Cockcroft\u00adGault-\nSerum chemistries of interest were examined as the\ndependent variable in a general linear model with age, race-\nethnicity and categories of CrCl as independent variables.\nThe value for age was that at the time of the screening\ninterview. Race-ethnicity was predefined in NHANES III as\nnon-Hispanic white (reference group), non-Hispanic black,\nMexican-American, or other. The other category included\nall Hispanics who were not Mexican-American and all\nnon-Hispanics from racial groups other than white or\nblack. Analyses were stratified by gender. Ionized calcium\n(normalized) was the principal measure of serum calcium in\nour study. We also analysed total calcium and total calcium\nadjusted for albumin by a commonly used formula, where\n0.8 mgudl was added for every 1 gudl depression in serum\nTo assess the impact of dietary intake on serum chemistry\nlevels, we repeated the analyses, controlling for dietary\nintake, for various nutrients as well as the duration of fasting\nbefore phlebotomy. Dietary intake data were available in\nangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on serum\npotassium, we repeated this analysis after excluding subjects\non ACE inhibitors or NSAIDs.\nFinally, we determined the percentage of adults in the US\nin the different categories of CrCl who had a serum\nphosphorus level )4.5 mgudl, the upper limit of the\nlaboratory normal reference range.\nResults\nNHANES III population\nTwenty thousand and fifty NHANES III participants,\n(73%) had complete measurements for biochemistry\nprofile (including creatinine) and ionized calcium.\nare shown in Table 1. Since this study population is\nnot a simple random sample of the US population,\nthe prevalence of CRI shown here reflects not only the\nprevalence of CRI in the US population, but also the\neffects of sampling; older persons, Mexican-Americans\nand black persons were intentionally over-represented.\nThese groups were subsequently weighted less in the\nregression analysis in order for the final results to be\nbroadly generalizable.\nSerum chemistries and renal function\nWe found a progressive increase in serum phosphorus\nconcentration among subjects with decreased renal\nfunction that became evident as early as CrCl\n50\u00ad60 mlumin (Table 2). In contrast, the relationship\nbetween serum ionized calcium (normalized) and\nCrCl was weak and inconsistent (Table 3).

Our results are therefore broadly\ngeneralizable. We found that different homeostatic\nabnormalities of CRI were apparent at different\nlevels of renal function. Changes in mean serum\nphosphorus and potassium concentrations were evid-\nent at relatively modest reductions of CrCl (around\n50\u00ad60 mlumin). In contrast, changes in other biochem-\nical parameters, e.g. the anion gap and ionized calcium\nand bicarbonate, were not apparent until CRI was\nadvanced (CrCl O20 mlumin).\nOur finding that serum phosphorus concentration is\nelevated in people with mild to moderate CRI differs\nfrom several previous studies [20\u00ad26]. For example,\nWilson et al. found in 12 CRI subjects (CrCl range\nserum phosphorus was lower than in controls. This has\nbeen used to argue that an elevated serum phosphorus\nlevel is unlikely to play an important role in the\npathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism in\nmild to moderate CRI [27,28]. Instead, the initiation\nand maintenance of hyperparathyroidism was ascribed\nHowever, the observation of low serum phosphorus\nin subjects with mild to moderate CRI has not been\nfound a trend towards a higher serum phosphorus\nconcentration among those with lower CrCl [29]. Our\nstudy confirms and extends the findings of Pitts et al.\nIndeed, the large sample size and accompanying\nstatistical power allowed us to identify a specific\nrange of CrCl at which changes may first be observed.\nThis subtle increase in mean phosphorus con-\ncentration in subjects with mild to moderate CRI\nsuggests that elevations in serum phosphorus may\ncontribute to the observed increases in parathyroid\nhormone at this level of renal function [29,34], even\nwhen mean serum phosphorus concentrations remain\nwithin the normal reference range. If so, since an early\nTable 5.

Therefore, these data do not contradict\nthe lack of postprandial rise in serum phosphorus that\nhas been documented among eight children with GFR\nOur finding that decreased serum ionized calcium\nwas not apparent until CrCl was O20 mlumin also\nagrees with the finding of Pitts et al. [29]. Llach et al.\nand Wilson et al. also found that serum calcium was\nsimilar among those with and without CRI [22,26].\nMartinez et al. had speculated that abnormalities in the\nextracellular calcium sensor receptor might play a role\nin the pathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism\nOur finding that changes in serum bicarbonate and\nthe anion gap were not obvious until CrCl reached\nO20 mlumin is consistent with the literature showing\nthat `uraemic acidosis' develops only in the later stages\nof renal insufficiency [37]. Our results differ from that\nof Frassetto et al. who found that serum bicarbon-\nate level decreased with CrCl in the range of\ndiscrepancy include the fact that Frassetto et al.\nanalysed arterialized venous blood in 64 subjects who\nwere in a steady state and on a controlled diet in a\nclinical research centre [4]. This method may be more\nsensitive than the one employed by NHANES III.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study\nthat has shown statistically significant elevations in\nserum potassium in patients with mild to moderate\nCRI. These do not seem to be related to the use of\ndrugs known to cause hyperkalaemia in susceptible\nsubjects (e.g. ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs). The\nphysiological significance of this subtle increase in\nmean serum potassium level (in the order of 0.1\u00ad\n0.2 mmolul) is unclear. The associations between\nreduced renal function and increased levels of potas-\nsium and phosphorus are physiologically plausible.\nThese trends are consistent across the genders and\ncorrelate with the severity of renal insufficiency (i.e.\nstepwise worsening of parameters with lower CrCl\nlevels), and therefore probably reflect biological\nrelationships.\nIt is notable that we were able to detect these\nchanges despite the fact that various homeostatic,\ncompensatory mechanisms may be in play throughout\nthe course of CRI that serve to minimize changes in\nserum chemistries. Of great importance among these\nmechanisms are hormonal changes (e.g. aldosterone\npromoting urinary potassium excretion, or para-\nthyroid hormone promoting urinary phosphorus\nexcretion and calcium mobilization from bone). Our\nresults suggest that these adaptations are unable to\ncompensate completely for the decrease in GFR, as a\nsubtle elevation in the mean serum potassium level can\nbe detected in a study with sufficient power.\nThis study has several limitations that should be\nmentioned. Only calculated creatinine clearances were\nused; actual measurements of CrCl or GFR were not\nmade. However, the use of estimated CrCl typically\nreduces misclassification of CRI severity compared\nwith the use of serum Cr [6,7]. NHANES III data\ndid not contain measurements of arterial blood gas,\nvitamin D and other\nparameters that would have enriched our analysis.\nThat NHANES III examinees with mild to moderate\nCRI have elevated serum parathyroid hormone levels\ncan only be extrapolated from previous studies\n[29,34]. Serum pH was measured but not reported\nand ionized calcium was reported after normalization.\nSerum biochemistry profile was measured only once.\nThe day-to-day and even hour-to-hour fluctuations\nin fasting serum parameters, which were probably\nrandom, reduced the power of the study and led to\nunderestimation of the true clinical association. This\nstudy was well powered due to the large number of\nNHANES III examinees. Complete information on\npotential medical interventions to treat the biochem-\nical abnormalities of CRI were not available, although\nit is very unlikely that subjects with mild to moderate\nCRI were treated except in cases of significant\nhyperkalaemia. Despite this possible bias, elevations\nin mean serum potassium levels were still detected\n(and appeared to be independent of any dietary\nmanipulation). The exclusion of NHANES III parti-\ncipants who did not have measures of serum Cr and\nelectrolytes led to slight biases in the survey weights,\nbut this was unlikely to influence our results substan-\ntially. Finally, since this is a cross-sectional study, we\ndid not have information on how different biochemical\nparameters changed over time in individuals with\nprogressive renal insufficiency.\nIn summary, elevations in serum phosphorus and\npotassium were apparent even in persons with mild\nto moderate CRI. These changes were independent\nof dietary intake and the use of ACE inhibitors\nor NSAIDs. Acidosis was not apparent and serum\nionized calcium was not reduced except among people\nwith CrCl O20 mlumin. These findings should be\nbroadly generalizable to the larger US CRI popula-\ntion. Subtle elevations in serum phosphorus might\ncontribute to the initiation and maintenance of\nsecondary hyperparathyroidism that is known to\noccur in mild to moderate CRI.\n"
