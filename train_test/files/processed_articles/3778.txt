    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: To evaluate levels of the calcium-binding proteins S100A8 and S100A9 in the skin of\npatients with psoriatic arthritis.\nMethods: Skin punch biopsies were obtained from patients with psoriatic arthritis and healthy\ncontrol subjects. S100A8/A9 were semiquantified via immunohistochemistry and semiquantitative\npolymerase chain reaction.\nResults: The study included biopsies from nine patients with psoriatic arthritis and nine control\nsubjects. S100A8 and S100A9 were present at visibly higher levels in psoriatic plaques compared\nwith normal skin samples. S100A8 and S100A9 RNA levels were significantly higher in the\nperipheral region of plaques compared with the central region.\nConclusion: Both S100A8 and S100A9 may represent good therapeutic targets in psoriasis and\npsoriatic arthritis.\n",
