However, few of these hypotheses are able to explain why humans have\nsuch vast vocabularies. It is not atypical for an adult English speaker to know 100,000\nwords (Pinker, 2003), but only a few thousand are required for conversation or even to\nappreciate literature (Nation, 2006). This is a surprising discrepancy since natural selection\ndoes not usually favor waste (Ridley, 2004). Darwin proposed that the origin of language\nwas in courtship calls (Darwin, 1871/2004). Yet other primates manage rich social\ninteraction with remarkably few distinct calls (Cheney and Seyfarth, 1998). A possible\nexplanation of this apparent redundancy was proposed by Miller (2000) who suggested that\nindividuals use vocabulary to demonstrate their intelligence, and consequently their\nHuman vocabulary use as display\n\"fitness\" to potential mates. Here we explore the possibility that vocabulary is a proxy for\nintelligence and is subject to sexual selection. If so, vocabulary is likely to be used as a\nsexual display. We present an experimental test of this hypothesis.\nA surfeit of words?\nConservative estimates suggest that a well-educated, native English speaker knows\nD'Anna, and Healy, 1995). A lexicon of this size does not seem necessary considering that\nin 1935 Longman compiled a \"defining vocabulary\" of 2,000 of the most common words\nfrom which all definitions in their dictionaries are now written (Bullon, 2007). Word\nfrequency in any language is described by Zipf's law (Zipf, 1932). This states that the\nfrequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table of the\ncorpus to which it belongs. For instance, of the 757,087 different word forms in the in the\nwhich appear just once, and there are only 124,002 word forms that occur in the British\nNational Corpus more than ten times. The word \"the\" alone typically accounts for over 6%\nof all words (Leech, Rayson, and Wilson, 2001). Since conversation and text are dominated\nby relatively few different words it would be expected that the majority of spoken and\nwritten language could be understood with only a limited vocabulary.\nNation (2006) examined what size vocabulary is needed to understand written text\nand speech before unknown words interfere with comprehension. Knowledge of 98% of\nwords in a given text or conversation has long been used by linguists as a level at which\nadequate comprehension is achieved (e.g. Francis and Kucera, 1979). Nation (2006) found\nof the text respectively, within classic books by authors including Henry James, F. Scott\nFitzgerald, D.H. Lawrence and H.G. Wells. Nation (2006) also found that even fewer\nwords were necessary for the comprehension of unscripted conversations. Knowledge of\nto be larger than is necessary for producing and comprehending most linguistic\ncommunication.\nIndicators of fitness\nSexual displays that indicate an individual's \"fitness\" have been documented\nthroughout the animal kingdom (Andersson, 1994). This includes traits that even appear to\nharm an individual's survival ability (Zahavi, 1975). Due to the differing contribution of\nresources to offspring by males and females it is expected that the sex that contributes the\nleast is the one that usually produces the most vigorous sexual displays (Trivers, 1972).\nIn humans, it has been proposed that creativity (Griskevicius, Cialdini, and Kenrick,\nrecent study measured general intelligence using five different tests (including the Ravens\nAdvanced Progressive Matrices and the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale) and found a\nsignificant correlation between intelligence and body symmetry (Prokosch, Yeo, and\nMiller, 2005). Other studies have also reported positive correlations between measures of\nintelligence and symmetry (e.g. Bates, 2007; Furlow, Armijo-Prewitt, Gangestad, and\nThornhill, 1997). This suggests that intelligence could be a reliable indicator of\nHuman vocabulary use as display\ndevelopmental stability and heritable fitness. One of the most convincing findings from the\npsychological literature is that intelligence is highly heritable and that it has the highest\nheritability of any adult trait (Bouchard, Lykken, McGue, Segal, and Tellegen, 1990;\nCarroll, 1993). Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that intelligence is a much sought\nafter trait in potential partners (Buss et al., 1990).\nSelection of intelligence\nStudies of human mate preferences reveal how certain psychological traits appear to\nbe subject to selection pressures. Across 37 different cultures intelligence, kindness and\nunderstanding are rated the most important characteristics in a partner, by both sexes (Buss\net al., 1990). Pawlowski and Koziel (2002) obtained evidence from real mating situations\nwith actual consequences by analyzing 2008 personal advertisements for traits that\nsuccessfully attracted responses by potential partners. They found that for men the best\npredictor of number of responses was their level of education, which is strongly associated\nwith intelligence (Kaufman and Wang, 1992), those with higher education received more\nresponses. However, for females the reverse was found. It was unusual for males to prefer\nfemale partners with significantly higher levels of education than themselves (Pawlowski\nand Koziel, 2002). Analyses of speed dating events reveal similar preferences in the\nselection of romantic partners (Fisman, Iyengar, Kamenica, and Simonson, 2006). These\nstudies all suggest that intelligence is actively selected and that education level can be one\nindicator of this. Although formal education will not have been selected in the past, as it is\na recent phenomenon, vocabulary is a direct indicator of intelligence that would have been\nreadily perceivable by potential mates in the past.\nVocabulary as an indicator of intelligence\nFor vocabulary to be a valid and reliable indicator of intelligence it would be\nexpected to be heritable and for there to be a strong correlation between vocabulary\nknowledge and performance on intelligence tests. Tests of verbal ability are components of\nintelligence tests themselves; the SAT (scholastic aptitude test) and Weschler Adult\nIntelligence Scale both rely on verbal elements, including vocabulary tests. In the\nstandardization sample of the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale the vocabulary subtest\ncorrelates .75 with the full scale score, which is higher than the other subtests (Wechsler,\n1958). Since vocabulary is part of the definition of intelligence (at least traditional\nmeasures of it) it is not surprising that it is heritable. A study of 71 monozygotic and 78\ndizygotic twins reported heritability of vocabulary at .74 and .41 respectively (Bratko,\n1996). In a longitudinal genetics study of 997 adults, all twins or siblings of twins, van den\nBerg, Posthuma and Boomsma (2004) reported that around 76% of vocabulary knowledge\nover time can be explained by genetic factors. Furthermore, Stromswold (2001) reviewed\nmore than a hundred genetic studies and concluded that the variance of linguistic ability is\ninfluenced by genetic factors.\nOf course both intelligence and vocabulary are observable characteristics that are\ninfluenced by many factors including heritability. However, it is observable characteristics\nthat are subject to sexual selection on the basis that they reflect not just heritable factors but\nalso environmental (including social) factors. For instance, differences in vocabulary that\nresult from dialects are not likely to have a genetic component, but may nonetheless be\nsubject to selection pressures (Dunbar, 1996).\nHuman vocabulary use as display\nSex differences in language usage?\nAlthough there may not be large sex differences in linguistic ability (Hyde and\nLinn, 1988) or total output (Mehl, Vazire, Ram\u00edrez-Esparza, Slatcher, and Pennebaker,\n2007) there is research suggesting that males and females may use communication\ndifferently. Studies of conversation in natural social settings reveal that males devote more\ntime to topics of self-promotion compared to females, and that this bias is exaggerated\nwhen females are present (Dunbar, Marriott, and Duncan, 1997). This behavior has\ncharacteristics in common with the male sexual display of a mating lek (Rowe and Houle,\n1996). Kanazawa's (2000) analysis of cultural displays also points to a strong male bias in\ncultural output. This is reminiscent of the literature on animal signaling, where most of the\nsignals that animals produce are intended to influence the behavior of others (Krebs and\nDawkins, 1984). In humans a meta-analytic review of sex variation in language use during\nspeech showed that numerous factors (e.g. whether the group was same or mixed sex, the\nfamiliarity of the setting, whether the conversation was with a stranger or a close relation),\nmoderated levels of talkativeness and whether speech was classified as \"assertive\" or\n\"affiliative\" (Leaper and Ayres, 2007). In fact males tended to dominate women in\nconversation through high levels of talkativeness.\nPriming mating motivation\nIt has been argued that mental mechanisms have evolved to solve adaptive problems\nand that these mechanisms can be particularly sensitive to ecological cues suggesting either\nan opportunity or a threat (Cosmides and Tooby, 1992; \u00d6hman and Mineka, 2001), even\nwithout explicit awareness (Bargh and Chartrand, 1999). Individuals primed with cues\nrelated to mating produced higher levels of creativity on a writing task compared to those\nprimed with non-mating cues (Griskevicius et al., 2006). Roney (2003) found that mating\ncues changed males' attitudes towards a greater conformity with the attitudes preferred by\nfemales. Furthermore, Wilson and Daly (2004) reported, also using a mate priming\nparadigm, that males significantly increased discounting of the future in a monetary choice\ntask after viewing photographs of attractive females compared to unattractive females.\nDiscounting is a standard measure of impulsivity and risk seeking behavior. To our\nknowledge there are no studies exploring the effect of a mating prime on an individual's\nuse of vocabulary.\nThe present study tested the hypothesis that vocabulary is used as a sexual display\nby presenting mating primes in the form of photographs of young members of the opposite\nsex and asking participants to imagine a romantic scenario with them. We hypothesized\nthat participants would use more low frequency words following such a prime relative to a\ncontrol condition where the prime was a photograph of older members of the opposite sex\nand an imaginary non-romantic encounter. Differences in vocabulary output were measured\nusing written autobiographical descriptions. Vocabulary is convenient to measure\nquantitatively because words can be ranked objectively by frequency and output can be\nmeasured for the number of different lower frequency words used (word range). Theory\nand data from parental investment models, research on sexual displays, social interaction\nand previous work with mate priming paradigms led us to predict that participants would\nshow a greater use of lower frequency words in the mating prime condition compared to\nthe non-mating prime condition.\nHuman vocabulary use as display\nMaterials and Methods\nDesign\nWe used a 2x2 factorial design with Sex (male versus female) and Prime (young\nversus old) as between subjects factors \u00ad half the participants were primed by photographs\nof young members of the opposite sex and half were exposed to photographs of older\nmembers of the opposite sex. All of the participants then wrote a short autobiographical\nstatement that provided the dependent variable of word frequency (this is explained in more\ndetail in the results).\nParticipants\nEighty-eight unpaid participants from undergraduate psychology classes at the\nUniversity of Nottingham volunteered for the study. Three were excluded because they\nfailed to complete the test phase. Of the remaining 85 participants 33 were male and 52\nwere female. Mean age for males was 21.1 years (SD = 3.3) and the mean age for females\nMaterials\nPhotographs were collected from publicly available websites of fashion model\nagencies. Their presence on fashion model websites was taken to indicate that the models\nwere of above average attractiveness and likely to be desirable to participants. Arrays of 4\nphotographs were used in each condition for each sex, giving a total of 16 photographs.\nPhotographs were headshots and the dimensions were 365 x 530 pixels. The mean age of\nthe male older models was 57.3 years (SD = 4.5) and the mean age of the older female\nmodels was 55.8 years (SD = 4.3). It was assumed that the undergraduate participants in\nthis experiment would not consider the older models as potential partners (c.f. Buss, 1989).\nThe mean age of the younger male models was 22.8 years (SD = 2.5) and the mean age of\nthe younger female models was 21.8 years (SD = 2.2). It was assumed that the participants\nwould consider at least one of the four models shown in the arrays of younger models as a\npotential partner.\nProcedure\nThe participants were randomly assigned to one of the two prime conditions.\nParticipants who saw photographs of younger models were then instructed to select one of\nthe four photographs they thought would be the most desirable romantic partner (priming\nphase). The selected image remained on the monitor and the others disappeared. The\nparticipants were then given three minutes in which they were asked to imagine a romantic\nencounter with the person shown in the image that they selected. During this period they\nwere asked to give a written description of such an encounter. Due to the likely personal\nnature of the written descriptions the participants were assured that the process was\nanonymous and confidential. The participants who saw photographs of older models\nunderwent an identical procedure except they were told to select the person who they\nthought would be the most pleasant to chat to in a chance meeting and then to write about\nwhat this meeting might be like. Since written descriptions of the different kinds of\nencounters might require words with different frequencies we did not analyze these data.\nInstead, once this description was complete a second text box appeared next to the selected\nHuman vocabulary use as display\nimage and participants in both conditions were given identical instructions to write about\ntheir first experiences at university. It was suggested that it could include descriptions of\nstudent life and whether the participant was enjoying it and what their ambitions for the\nfuture were. This was a subject common to all of the participants in this sample and\nafforded an opportunity for articulation. The image and instructions remained on the screen\nfor ten minutes. The participants were again assured that the information provided was\nanonymous and confidential. They were also asked to avoid using instant messenger chat or\nmobile phone text style spelling.\nResults\nVariation in frequencies of the 2,000 most frequent words in the British National\nCorpus has been estimated at no more than 3% (Nation, 2006). The present study\ninvestigated possible variation in the least frequent words, so before the data was analyzed\nthe 100 most frequent words in the British National Corpus were excluded (reducing the\ntext by 44%), the analyses were then carried out on those words occurring in the first\nquartile of frequency. Word frequency represents the number of occurrences of the word in\nthe British National Corpus. Raw word lists in all conditions were corrected for spelling.\nThus the dependent variable is the mean frequency in each autobiographical statement. The\nresulting data are shown in Figure 1 and were entered into a 2 (sex: male versus female) X\n2 (Prime: younger versus older) between subjects analysis of variance. There was no main\nmales, priming with photographs of younger females and an imagined romantic encounter\nled to lower mean frequency scores than when they were primed with older females and a\nphotographs of young male models and an imagined romantic encounter tended to use\nhigher frequency scores than when primed by older male models and an imaginary non-\nHuman vocabulary use as display\nFigure 1. Word frequencies by condition. Bars show means and SEMs.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, the present experiment is the first to investigate the effects of a\nmating prime on vocabulary usage. The hypothesis was that individuals who were primed\nwith mating cues would use a greater number of lower frequency words compared to those\nprimed with cues unrelated to mating. This study was intended to extend previous work\nwhere similar paradigms have been used to test the effects that mate priming has on\ndiscounting the future (Wilson and Daly, 2004), attitudes (Roney, 2003) and motivation for\ndisplays of creativity (Griskevicius et al., 2006). The data from the current study showed\nthat, as predicted, priming by photographs of young female models and an imagined\nromantic encounter led male participants to use a greater number of lower frequency words.\nThat is, imagining spending time with a desirable partner led to a display of linguistic\nability from which they could not benefit in the current setting. For females, being primed\nby young male models and an imaginary romantic encounter led to a greater use of higher\nfrequency words. This effect is in the opposite direction to that predicted but should be\ntreated with some caution since it is only marginally significant (p = .06).\nThese findings are consistent with theories of sexual selection, where males, who\nhave a lower minimum cost of parental investment, produce displays to attract females, and\nthat these displays would be expected to be more pronounced than displays made by\nTrivers, 1972). The findings also provide further evidence that males are sensitive to\nHuman vocabulary use as display\nenvironmental cues that are biologically salient (Cosmides and Tooby, 1992; \u00d6hman and\nMineka, 2001). The results are also compatible with work showing that human males\nexaggerate traits that are known to be sought by females in a romantic partner (Dunbar et\nal., 1997). The data also provides support for the hypothesis that vocabulary is used by\nmales to display their intelligence and fitness (Miller, 2000; Prokosch et al., 2005). An\nalternative explanation is that the younger female images did not lead to an increase in use\nof lower frequency words but that there was a decrease in use of lower frequency words\nfollowing exposure to the older female images. However, we know of no research, or likely\nhypothesis, that would explain why males might alter their behavior in this way in the\ncontext of an older female. For females, being primed by an imaginary romantic encounter\nwith young males led to a greater use of higher frequency words, in the opposite direction\nto that of males, however the difference was marginal.\nWhy would the pattern be different for males and females? Previously it has been\nshown that females did not respond to a mating prime when asked to produce a display of\ncreativity (Griskevicius et al., 2006). This could be due to females being less aroused by\nvisual images than men are (Hamann, Herman, Nolan, and Wallen, 2004), but it could also\nbe that females do not expend greater effort on a sexual display unless a potential mate is\nconsidered a long-term prospect (Li, 2007). The present study did not specify whether the\nromantic scenario should be considered a short or long-term encounter, but the differences\nbetween these types of relationship have obvious implications, especially for a female with\nthe risk of parenthood. Griskevicius et al's (2006) work suggested that the paradigm used\nhere was interpreted by participants as a short rather than a long-term scenario and that\nfemales' threshold for producing sexual displays of creativity are significantly higher than\nare males. As the data in the present study did not reach the criterion for statistical\nsignificance a cautious interpretation would be judicious. It is possible that female use of\nvocabulary is not affected by priming in this way. However, it could be asked why females\nmight use a greater number of higher frequency words in a mating scenario. It is possible\nthat a female strategy is to not risk being viewed as more intelligent than a prospective\nmale partner. Although data is scarce on how humans actually behave in mating situations\nthis finding would be consistent with some previous research. Both sexes have stated\npreferences for intelligent long-term partners (Buss et al., 1990) but there is data to suggest\nthat males do not want a partner who is more intelligent than they are. Fisman et al's\n(2006) study of speed dating events found that males did not seek a female who was more\nintelligent than themselves. Pawlowski and Koziel (2002) reached a similar conclusion to\nthat of Fisman et al (2006). It is then plausible that females are aware of these male\npreferences and adjust their behavior to avoid the risk of appearing more intelligent than a\npotential male partner and potentially impairing their perceived attractiveness. An\nalternative explanation for a contrasting result for females compared to males is that\nfemales responded to the older males in the non-mating condition as a potential mate rather\nthan the younger males in the mating condition. This seems unlikely for two reasons \u00ad first,\nalthough it has been claimed that females prefer older males this stated preference is for\nmales to be older on average by 3.42 years (Buss, 1989). However, in the present study the\nolder males were some 38 years older. Second, females who saw images of young males\nwere instructed to think about their chosen male in a romantic scenario whereas there was\nno mention of a romantic scenario for those who saw images of older males.\nAlthough the present study did not specify whether participants should consider the\nHuman vocabulary use as display\nperson in the romantic scenario as a short or long-term prospect, it would be expected that\nmales and females would approach each of these scenarios with different behavioral\nstrategies (Li, 2007; Trivers, 1972). It has previously been shown that the threshold for\nfemales to display linguistic ability is higher than for males (Griskevicius et al., 2006). This\nmight explain why in the present study the mating prime failed to lead to a change in\nfemale vocabulary use. Although the age of the participants in the present study was well\nsuited to a study of mating preferences, most participants from this demographic would not\nbe expected to be either parents or married (Buss et al., 1990). It remains to be seen how\nthese findings would generalize to different populations and contexts.\nFuture research might determine if vocabulary used in this way is universal by\ntesting participants with different cultural backgrounds. Indeed there are clear cultural\ndifferences as well as commonalities in factors affecting mate choice (Buss et al., 1990). It\nis plausible that undergraduates are more likely to utilize vocabulary as a form of display\nthan people from other socio-economic groups. The relative weight placed on different\naspects of mate choice may differ from one-context to another, and from one group to\nanother. Moreover, because we did not have a same-sex comparison we are unable to rule\nout the possibility that the males in our study might have use low frequency words in order\nto impress in a non-mating situation.\nThere also remains the question of whether vocabulary can be used to deceive\npotential mates into believing that the male is a better prospect than they actually are. It is\ntempting to speculate that undergraduates (and other academics) might attempt to inflate\nother people's estimates of their intelligence by deliberately using low frequency words in\nthe presence of people that they wish to impress. The fact that we observed differences in\nword frequencies between conditions seems to make this explanation unlikely. It is our\nbelief that the effect was unintentional on the part of the participants because although they\nwere aware that the text that they wrote would be analyzed, they did not know that it would\nbe analyzed for word frequency. Moreover, if males do attempt to manipulate potential\nmates' estimates of their fitness by deception we should expect females to have evolved\nsome mechanism to detect deceptive displays (c.f. Cosmides and Tooby, 1992). While such\na deception might be effective for a short-term encounter it is unlikely to be convincing in\nthe long-term. Certainly future research will need to test whether females actually select\nmales who use low frequency words, and we may then ask if this is relevant to short- or\nlong-term unions.\nThe current work tested males and females in a laboratory environment with a\nfictional social scenario; future work might seek to replicate this study in an actual verbal\ncourtship situation. It would be expected that the presence of an attractive mate would lead\nto an even more powerful display of linguistic ability, at least for males. If individuals do\nuse vocabulary in a mating scenario a natural extension of this work would be a test to see\nif this usage of lower frequency words is actively selected. Would individuals who use a\ngreater number of lower frequency words be preferred over those using fewer lower\nfrequency words? If this were shown it would also be interesting to find out whether there\nwould be an optimum number of lower frequency words mediating perceived\nattractiveness.\nIn conclusion, the results indicated that when males merely imagined being with a\nromantic partner use of lower frequency words was higher compared to imagining being\nwith a non-romantic partner, thus providing some preliminary evidence in support of the\nHuman vocabulary use as display\nhypothesis that males use vocabulary to display intelligence in this context (Miller, 2000).\nIt is also consistent with the literature which suggests that although the majority of lower\nfrequency words are not necessary for comprehending most communication (Nation, 2006)\nthey do become more salient following priming with a mating scenario when displaying\nintelligence would be preferred, at least by females (Buss et al., 1990).\n"
