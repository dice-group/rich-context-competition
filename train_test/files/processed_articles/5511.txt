    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper addresses historical and contemporary issues of leadership in Armenia. Five leadership models have been\nacknowledged in Armenia during its four thousand year history: Monarchic, Church, National, Communist, and Democratic\nLeadership. Each model has been presented within its historical context and analyzed in light of current leadership behaviors\nin Armenia. The results of the study show that (a) current Armenian leaders seem to reflect the behaviors and attitudes of\nthe historical leadership models above; (b) history should matter in leadership studies to understand leadership behaviors, in\nthis case in Armenia, and how the past continues to shape their current worldviews and social identities; and (c) democracy\nimported to Armenia from the West, with little considerations of the historical characteristics of the Armenian people,\nhas not produced the desired democratic reforms since 1991 independence. Perhaps an integrative approach to all five\nleadership models is necessary to address leadership challenges in Armenia today.\n",

Beginning in the 16th century, the rise of\nArmenian national identity under the yoke of Tatar-Mongols,\nEgyptian Mamluks, Turkic tribes, and later, Ottoman sultans\nproduced a national leadership model in Armenia that aimed\nfor national independence and struggled against foreign\ninvestors. Due to Socialist movements in Europe and the\nBolshevik revolution in Russia in 1917, the eastern prov-\ninces of Armenia joined the revolutionary movements in\nTranscaucasia and--after the newly formed national govern-\nment in Armenia was overthrown in 1920--came to power\nas Communist leaders and governed until the collapse of the\nSoviet Union. Since 1991, the newly formed government of\nindependent Armenia has \"embraced\" Western democracy\nand \"free-market economy\" as the ethos of its constitution.\nFor the most part, this rapid shift from totalitarian to demo-\ncratic form of governance, and from Soviet centralized econ-\nomy to free-market economy, was the result of the demand of\nthe time for political and economic survival rather than peo-\nple's ideological paradigm shift.\nArmenia has been in the crossroads of one of the most\nintense geopolitical regions of Eurasia since the fall of the\nSoviet Union. After more than 20 years of independence,\nArmenia continues to be a transitional country with its\nmassive economic and political problems. Forty-two per-\ncent of the country's population lives at or below the pov-\nerty level. Due to the severe economic conditions in\nArmenia, people are leaving the country to find jobs in\nRussia, Europe, and North America. Thus, two thirds of\nthe Armenian population live outside Armenia. The coun-\ntry is currently suffering from a high unemployment rate\nas well as a lack of accountability among leaders in public\noffices and the business sector. During the last presiden-\ntial election in 2008, for instance, ballot stuffing, intimi-\ndation of poll workers, vote buying, and other irregularities\nwere not unusual (U.S. Department of State, 2012). Even\nthe parliamentary election in 2012 was not exempt from\nvote buying and ballot stuffing. The corruption continues\nto be high among leaders who occupy public offices\n(Martirosyan, 2009). A group of oligarchs controls the\nentire economy of the country (Masis Post, 2011). The\ndisheartening reality of Armenia and the Armenian people\nraises questions that deserve answers.\nIt was in 1991, a few months before the fall of the\nUSSR, when Gerard Libaridian, Professor of Modern\nArmenian History at the University of Michigan wrote,\n\"Will the new leaders of Armenia be able to translate their\nvision into a strategy and the strategy into programs?

Why has Western\ndemocracy not been working? Will it ever work? If not,\nwhat type of democracy or form of governance is more\nculturally relevant to the Armenian people? Can we learn\nuseful leadership lessons from the nation's history to help\nus face the 21st century's economic, political, social, cul-\ntural, and global challenges? Finally, what is the future of\nArmenian leadership?\nTo find answers to these questions, I have taken on the\ntask of studying Armenian leaders and leadership models,\nfrom prehistoric times to the present expecting to attain new\nperspectives and answers to the aforementioned questions\nfor the 21st-century Armenian leadership.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this study is to assess five major historical\nand contemporary models of indigenous Armenian leader-\nship to be able to understand the relationship between the\npast and present, and whether or not the current leadership\nbehaviors are the product of the nation's history.\nObjectives\nThe research objectives are to understand current Armenian\nleadership in light of five major historical and contempo-\nChurch leadership (301 ad-present), National leadership\nNational leadership (1988-present), and Democratic leader-\nMethod\nBy using the historiographical and ethnographic research\n(participant observation: emic perspective) methods, this\npaper follows the deductive reasoning around the following\nhypothesis: history matters in leadership studies.

I have identified lead-\nership traits within the nation's history and categorized them\nunder the following major historical leadership themes:\nArmenian monarchy,Armenian Church leadership,Armenian\nnational leadership, Armenian Communist leadership, and\nArmenian democratic leadership. Then I sought to acknowl-\nedge the above themes' unique contributions to and influ-\nences on the development of the Armenian worldview and\nperception of leadership (whom the leaders were and what\nthe society's expectations were) throughout generations.\nSecond, I have observed the above historical leadership\nthemes in light of current Armenian leadership by using the\nemic perspective of my own 35 years of experience as a\nnative Armenian and an insider to the Armenian culture, as\nwell as an expatriate, an outsider to the Armenian culture\nthrough ongoing visits, interactions, and observations.\nDelimitation\nThis study is limited to observe Armenian public leaders both\nhistorical and contemporary within five historical leadership\nmodels: monarchic, Church, national, Communist, and demo-\ncratic in the context of historicalArmenia and current Republic\nof Armenia. Other leadership models among Armenians in the\nArmenian Diaspora is beyond the scope of this study.\nFindings\nWhat have been the main traits and characteristics of\nArmenian leadership in Armenia? To be able to answer this\nquestion, it is necessary to hear what the Armenian historiog-\nraphy has to say about Armenians. In light of the historio-\ngraphical data, five major Armenian leadership themes have\nLeadership (301 ad-present), National Leadership\nThe first and the longest historical trait of Armenian leader-\nship that had a lasting impact on the development of preser-\nvation of the Armenian people are the Armenian monarchy.\nAccording to Moses Khorenats'i, the father of the Armenian\nhistoriography (padmahayr), Haic or Hayk marks the\nbeginning of the Armenian monarchy around and beyond the\nshores of Mount Ararat (Transcaucasia) in 1779 according to\nthe Jewish calendar or the Septuagint 2663 (Chamchyants,\nFrom the Haykazuni Dynasty of the Bronze Age\nArmenia, Lesser Armenia, and the Armenian Kingdom of\nCilicia (Chamchyants, 2005).1 The Armenian historical lead-\nership has primarily been monarchical through the family\nlines beginning the Haykazuni dynasty of the Bronze Age\n(2500 bc) to the last dynasty of the Armenian kingdom,\nLusinians of Cilicia, the 14th century ad (Der Nersessian,\n1969). During the above period, nearly four millennia, seven\npan-Armenian dynasties ruled Armenia: Haykazuni dynasty,\nUrartu dynasty, Ervanduni dynasty, Artashesian dynasty,\nArshakuni dynasty, Bagratuni dynasty, and Rubenian-\nHetumian-Lusignan dynasties of Cilicia (Bournoutian, 2005;\nThe Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia under the rules of\nRubinian, Hetumian, and Lusinian dynasties from 1075 to\n1375 ad marks the end of the Armenian Monarchy. This\nperiod has been the longest period in the history of the\nnation where monarchic-autocratic style of leadership was\ndominant and decisive for the nation's survival. From the\nmiddle of the seventh to the end of twelfth century, Arabs\nconquered the Armenian land and devastated cities and vil-\nAfter the fall of the Cilician Kingdom, the next five centu-\nries until the beginning of the 19th century, the Armenian\nurban civilization transformed into a rural existence and the\ncountry turned into a state anarchy until mid-18th century.\nAfter the collapse of Seljuk power in 1300s, Turkomen\nnomads gain power in Asia Minor and western part of histori-\ncal Armenia under the rule of Osman. The latter's followers,\nthe Osmanlees or Ottomans, later founded the largest and\nmost enduring empire in the history of Islam called Ottoman\nEmpire. This marked the beginning of a dark age for the\nArmenian remnant in the west. In the eastern part ofArmenia,\nArmenians fell under the Persian rule in 1603 and later under\nthe rules of Russian Czars in 1829. Thus, Armenians from the\nmajority population became a minority group ever since the\nSeljuk Turks conquered Armenia, followed by rules of Young\nTurks from the west and Persians and Russians from the east.\nLater Armenians struggled for individual and ethnic survival\nduring the Armenian genocides that took place from 1894 to\n1923 under three Turkish authorities: Ottoman Empire,Young\nTurks, and the current Republic of Turkey (Howard, 2001;\nArmenian Church Leadership (301 ad-Present)\nThe second major leadership trait among Armenians\nobserved in this paper is the Armenian Church leadership.\n4 SAGE Open\nThe only existing institution that traces back to the 4th cen-\ntury is theArmenianApostolic Church. Not any other institu-\ntion survived since those days, including kingdoms and\ndynasties. Thus, the Armenian Church, with its unique lead-\nership traits and characteristics, has a significant influence\non the life of the Armenian people even today.\nThe Armenian conversion from paganism to Christianity\nas a state religion in 301 ad marks the birth of the Armenian\nChurch and its patriarchal and hierarchical leadership in\nArmenia. Gregory the Illuminator, according to\nAgathangelos's account, was the founder of Christianity in\nArmenia, which became the first Christian state in the world\n\"the official conversion of the [Armenian] kingdom had\ntaken place `from above,' that is through the conversion of\nthe ruling dynasty and an influential part of the aristocracy\"\nWith an objective look into Khorenats'i's History of the\nArmenians, one may easily observe a top-down\nChristianization of Armenia by the royal order of Kings\nTrdat, which is not seen in Agathangelos's History. Some\npagans Armenians apparently were forced to accept\nChristianity. Interestingly enough, the pagan resistance to\nChristian faith and the further presence of paganism in\nArmenia in the early stages of Armenian Christianity has\nbeen confirmed in Pawstos's (1989) History. According to\nOrmanian's chronological chart, which begins in 302 ad and\nwere from the Gregorian family line (Ormanian, 1912).\nEppler (1873) identifies seven levels of clergy in theArmenian\nOrthodox Church: doorkeepers, readers of the liturgical\nmaterials or the Scripture, exorcists, carriers of the torch, the\nlower deacons, the archdeacons, and the priesthood--bishops,\narchbishops, patriarchs, and the Catholicos, who oversee all\nArmenian Orthodox Churches in the world. Ormanian\n(1955), however, lists four degrees of hierarchy: (a) the\nsupreme Patriarch or Catholicos; (b) the Patriarch or special\nCatholicos, exert, or primate; (c) the archbishop or metro-\npolitan; and (d) the bishop. The latter asserts the traditional\nparticipatory role of ordinary people in doctrinal, discipline,\nas well as ecclesiastical election matters within the Armenian\nChurch that dates back to the earliest periods of its existence.\nFor instance, from electing the local parish priests to the\nCatholicos, the supreme patriarch of the Armenian Church,\nlay members, comprising princes, satraps, deputies, and rep-\nresentatives of people, cast the majority votes (Ormanian,\n1955). He goes on to say that, \"of all Christian communities,\nthe Armenian Church is the one wherein the democratic\nspirit excels in all its vividness and truth\" and that the pres-\nence of the laity is justified in the ecclesiastical assemblies\nEducation and literacy occupy a central place in the lives\nof Armenian Church leaders. Beginning from the Golden Age\nof the Armenian era (5th century ad) to the middle of the 20th\ncentury, the Communist era, most historians, philosophers,\ntheologians, and scientists were either Catholicoses, bishops,\nor vartabets (celibate priests) of the Armenian Church\nThe Armenian Church functioned both as a government\nas well as a religious institution not only before the last\nArmenian kingdom of Cilicia but also after its fall in the later\n14th century. As a result, the Church has taken the role of a\ngovernment to preserve tradition and national identity, some-\ntimes at the expense of spiritual and moral guidance\nChurch was weakened due to massive persecutions of clergy\nand church abolishment. During the Soviet reign, a new cat-\negory of Armenians emerged--atheists, who were anti-\nChristian socialists. The first decade of the Soviet regime\nmarked (a) the ideological battle against the Church via the\napparatus of the militant atheism to diminish the image and\nthe authority of the Church among the Armenian people and\n(b) the physical destruction and annihilation of ancient\nArmenian churches, monasteries, and Christian literature.\nThe forceful separation of the state and the church affected\nall levels of Armenia's social life: ideological, educational,\ncultural, economic, and political.\nThe post-Communist period since the 1991 independence\nbegan with the rise of the Armenian Church's authority and a\ntotal ignorance on the part of government leaders concerning\nChristianity in Armenia. This sudden freedom and ideologi-\ncal vacuum as a result of the fall of the Communist regime\nhas created enormous anxiety and confusion among both\nreligious and secular leaders.\nArmenian National Leadership (1675-Present)\nThe third leadership trait among Armenians examined in this\npaper is the national leadership. National leaders have his-\ntorically held an important place in the development of\nArmenian ideology of leadership. Leaders in legendary lit-\nerature, political-military leaders, writers and poets, and\nnational heroes whose primary goal was national indepen-\ndence and the freedom of the motherland from foreign domi-\nnators have all influenced Armenian life.\nAs a result of two and a half centuries of war between\nbefore and after the Bolshevik Revolution, left Armenia with\nfew Armenians. The remnants of the Armenian people sur-\nvived primarily outside of the historic Armenia (Nersisian,\n1972). The people and its leadership in exile formed a new\nmodel of leadership: national leadership of Diaspora around\nvarious nationalistic parties and religious communities\nArmenian literature has been one of the most effective\ntools for the development of ideal national leadership in the\nMalakyan 5\nArmenian mind, whom the leaders are and what makes one\nan exemplary leader (Raffi, 1955). Patriotism and national-\nism have become milestones within the diverse literature\ngenre, epic stories, legends, ancient mythology, biographical\nwritings, and so on. One of the earliest and prominent leg-\nendary heroes was Hayk, the forefather of the Armenians,\nwhose courage and fearless battle against Bell's outnum-\nbered and powerful army brought a great victory and free-\ndom to Hayk's family from his most threatening enemy.\nThus, throughout the centuries, Armenians, always in the\nminority, continued to believe that the numerical superiority\nof an enemy in battle did not guarantee victory. Another\nexample is the Avarair or Vardanank War in 451 ad--Arme-\nnians resisted the Persian king Hazkert's (Yazdgird II) force-\nful conversion from Christianity to Zoroastrianism (Elishe,\nto church doctrinal and political reasons, Armenia was\ndivided into Byzantine and Persian Armenia.\nNovelists and poets such as Raffi (Hagop Melik-\nHagopian), Hovhannes Toomanian, Derenik Demirjian,\nKhachatour Abovian, Mikael Nalbandian, Rafael Patkanian,\nBerj Proshiants, Daniel Varoujan, Hagop Paronian, Vahan\nTerian, Mouratsan, Nar-Dos, Avetik Isahakyan, Yeghishe\nCharents, Aksel Bakounts, Vahan Totovents, Parouyr Sevag,\nSilva Kaputikian, Hovhannes Shiraz, and others have signifi-\ncantly impacted the new generation of Armenians of the late-\n19th and the 20th centuries. While Russian and Georgian\nintellectuals and revolutionaries followed German philo-\nsophical ideas of socialism, Armenians adopted a more\nnationalistic course. Eastern Armenian writers and poets fol-\nlowed the romanticism of the Western writers by magnifying\nideas of patriotism, justice, and freedom among Armenians.\nLike their counterparts in the Balkans, Poland, and Bohemia,\nthey too embraced the concept of rebellion and resistance to\nforeign dominations (Bournoutian, 1994).\nThe history of the 19th-century Eastern Armenia marks a\ncolonial period in which Armenia was under Russian and\nIranian domination without national sovereignty. During that\nperiod, Armenia did not exist geographically on the global\nmap. The entire Transcaucasus was considered a part of\nSouthern Russia. As a result of World War I and the two\nand territorial changes took place in Armenia. First, in April\n1918, a federative republic, independent from Russia called\nthe Transcaucasian Federative Republic, was formed by\nGeorgians, Armenians, and Azeries. Second, a month later,\nin May 1918, the first Republic of Armenia was formed. It\ncan be said that the founders of the first Republic of Armenia\nwere representatives of national leaders on behalf of the\nArmenian Revolutionary Federation (Hai Heghapokhagan\nDashnaktsutiun). The latter lasted about a thousand days\nuntil the Communist Bolsheviks took over the government in\nrepublic: Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. During the\nperiod of the first Armenian massacres in Turkey in 1895 to\nthe fall of the first Armenian republic in 1921, a number of\nvolunteer military commanders and warrior-groups led by\npopular commanders such as Andranik (Terzibashian, 1942;\nGaregin Njdeh (Bournoutian, 1994), and independent war-\nriors called fidayies--Arabo, Mgo Shahen, Gevorg Chaush,\nAgbiur Serob, Hagop Sargavag (deacon), Hrair, Smbat,\nMourad, and others--rose to protect their own country and\nfight for national independence. The lives and heroic acts of\nthese people were recounted as sources of inspiration for the\nArmenian people for many generations. Many stories, songs,\nand novels have been written about them.\nThe third noteworthy Armenian leadership trait is found in\nThe first seeds of Marxist ideology in Armenia were planted\nin the 1880s. Armenian students in Europe first attempted to\ntranslate The Communist Manifesto in 1887. By the end of\nthe 19th century, Armenians had already published the works\nof Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, and other Communist prop-\nagates in Armenian. In the beginning of the 20th century,\nsome Armenian revolutionary Marxists, such as Bogdan\n1918), participated in the formation of a new type of Marxist\nparty in Russia. They became close partners of Vladimir I.\nLenin.\nCommunist leadership in the former Soviet Union, and\nparticularly in Armenia, was grounded on the materialistic\nideology of Marxism\u00adLeninism. The theory of historical and\ndialectical materialism developed by Marx and Engels advo-\ncates the notion of maintaining the physical existence of\nhuman beings as biological species (Christensen, 1994), and\nthe production and reproduction of the means of subsistence\nas a foundation for communal life. Communist leaders called\nfor liberation of the masses from existing social injustices\nand inequalities and advocated for common ownership and\ncontrol over the resources and production. The expected out-\ncome believed to be a just and communal society. However,\nthe Marxist theory of class struggle for social justice in\nArmenia, as well as in other Communist countries, fell short\nin its practical implementation.\nMoreover, Marxist philosophical anthropology, namely,\nthe view of moral character, is another significant issue. It\nwas expected that human class-consciousness create willing-\nness to strive for a better world and to bring social change or\nprogress to society. Subsequently, according to Marxist\u00ad\nLeninist theory, the rise and the development of morality\nmust be contingent upon the rise and the development of the\nCollectivity of leadership was the highest principle of the\nCommunist Party in the former Soviet Union, including in\nArmenia. Lenin held that a collective form of leadership was\na critical criterion for Party functioning. Lenin felt that such\n6 SAGE Open\na form would safeguard the Party from one-sidedness in\ndecision making. Yet, the Communist Party of the Soviet\nUnion soon after Lenin's death fell short from its own core\nleadership principle of collectivity. Stalin came to power and\nimposed himself as the final and ultimate power source for\nthe Party. Although the \"cult of the individual personality\"\nwas condemned after Stalin's death (Christensen, 1994),4 his\nleadership led the country into a tyranny and annihilation of\ninnocent lives in Armenia and in other socialist republics\nwithin the former Soviet Union.\nThe first Bolshevik revolutionists became the ideal lead-\ners or role models for their contemporaries and for the next\ngeneration. As a result of this new style of leadership, some\nwere inspired by these ideas from childhood. Others who\nwere more advanced in years adopted a method of self-\nenforcement for change (Mead, 1955). Mead also observed\nthree behavioral patterns in Bolshevik leadership: (a)\nbehavior that is traditional and pre-Soviet, (b) a behavior\nadopted in adulthood through self-enforcement, and (c)\nnew Soviet behavior that is grounded in childhood through\ndiscipline and education. From the beginning of the\nCommunist era, the Soviet authorities trained their cadres\nin the Communist ideal personality. This new indoctrina-\ntion created an ideological tension between the traditional\nArmenian Christian faith and the faith in communism and\nfor its cause. On one hand, for a Christian, the concept of\ngood and bad has been categorized by Christian scriptures,\non the other hand, for a Communist, it is the Party that is\nauthorized to define good and bad for the society. For a\nChristian, one may either transgress or obey the given prin-\nciples, while for a Communist, it is the capacity to maintain\n\"disallowed attitudes\" and openness for self-criticism and\ngroup-criticism. Moreover, in Christian behavior, there is\nto be no hatred toward enemies, Communist leadership left\nno room for love toward the Party's enemies such as traitors\nand spies, while trying to instill love toward the Party and\nThus, mistrust among people was one of the reasons that\nmillions of innocent people, including committed Communist\nleaders, were executed and/or imprisoned under the common\nepithet \"enemy of the people\" during the Stalin reign of\nrevolutionists died at an early age. Their opponents or ene-\nmies under various circumstances executed them. Thus, in\nlater Communist literature, these people were heroes of the\ntime. They became role models for generations to come.\nTherefore, not surprisingly, hundreds of thousands of young\nmen and women gave their lives for their country and for\nSoviet society during World War II, and some granted the\ntitle of National Hero. They continued to live in literature,\nfilms, and on the lips of students at all levels of education.\nThe Soviet authorities carefully designed school programs so\nthat the above ideal leaders would inspire and shape the new\ngeneration with patriotic fervor and ideals.\nArmenian Democratic Leadership (1991-Present)\nThe fifth and the youngest Armenian leadership model is the\ndemocratic leadership. In August 1990, for the first time in\nthe history of the nation, the newly formed Armenian\nParliament officially declared independence from the Soviet\nUnion and voted for its first democratically elected President,\nLevon Ter-Petrosyan (Libaridian, 1991). Today, the Republic\nof Armenia has her third elected President. However, accord-\ning to the international and local observers of elections, the\nsecond and third presidential elections fell short from the\ninternational standards of fair and democratic elections.\nIncidents such as selling votes, electoral frauds, and the use\nof brutal force by police or military were not exempted from\npeople of Armenia made a conscious choice in moving from\ntotalitarian hierarchy to independent democracy in 1990.\nHowever, it is hard to argue for a democratic worldview fully\nembraced by the society and its leaders. Rather, democracy\nseems another imposed ideology, much like Communism for\n70 years. Under democracy, the so-called democratic leaders\nin Armenia live and act like monarchs. For instance, in less\nthan a decade, a new generation of millionaires and billion-\naires emerged in Armenia. The lifestyle of these newly\nemerged \"kings\" is a reminder of ancient Armenian monar-\nchic rulers with their luxurious palaces, fancy transportation\nmeans, expensive and wasteful food parties and weddings,\nand numerous house-servants. However, according to the\nreport of the Armenian government, 34.6% of Armenia's\nDuring Ter-Petrosyan's presidency, the middle class,\nonce representing the majority of the Armenian population\nduring the Soviet regime, disappeared partly because of the\ncollapse of the Soviet centralized economy and the eco-\nnomic blockades by Turkey and Azerbaijan over the territo-\nrial dispute of the Nagorno-Karabakh since 1991. Moreover,\nthe 1988 earthquake that devastated and destroyed cities\nand hundreds of villages, by taking away more than twenty-\nfive thousand lives, created massive homelessness, poverty,\nand economic dependency on foreign aid. Although the\n1995 Constitution insured peaceful transition of power\nbetween various political parties, fundamental differences\narose between the governing elite and as a result, a consen-\nsus was not reached and the first president resigned in 1998\npute with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh remained\nunresolved. According to Libaridian (2007), although\nArmenia joined the Council of Europe and the World Trade\nOrganization, the former became weary of the progress of\ndemocracy in Armenia, while the latter limited benefits to\nArmenia due to its economic situation.\nMalakyan 7\nThus, it can be said that the democratic leadership in\nArmenia inherited all of the above leadership models: monar-\nchic authoritarianism, Christian hierarchy, Communist total-\nitarianism, and patriotic nationalism. The situation is\ncomplex and there seem to be no single strategy to have all at\nonce, \"an independent Armenia that is also free and demo-\ncratic,richandwithoutcorruptionanddepravity\"(Libaridian,\nfurther research is, \"What it means to be a democratic leader\nin the context of the Armenian historical worldview embed-\nded in the cultural habits of the Armenian people?\"\nDiscussion\nWhat do the above historical and contemporary leadership\nmodels teach us and what are the implications of those les-\nsons for the country's 21st-century economic, political,\nsocial, cultural, and global challenges? To be able to answer\nthese questions, let us highlight some historical facts and les-\nsons learned from each model to be able to understand the\ncurrent leadership behaviors in Armenia.\nArmenian Monarchy\n1. For four millennia, the Armenian leadership has pri-\nmarily been monarchical through seven pan-Armenian\nfamily lines beginning the Bronze Age (2500 bc) to the\nImplications: One may easily observe the monarchic\nbehaviors of current leaders inArmenia. For instance, today's\nmost public leaders inArmenia, much like monarchs, appoint\ntheir family members, relatives, and close friends to various\nleadership positions in both public and private sectors.\nLeadership successions have been perceived and practiced in\nArmenia as family successions. The country being small,\nboth geographically and population-wise, it is nearly impos-\nsible to avoid favoritism in hiring processes for public\noffices. Thus, those who know each other treat one another\nwith special favor.\n2. Monarchic-autocratic style of leadership was dominant\nand decisive for this period.\nImplications: As mentioned earlier, current leaders in\nArmenia act and behave as ancient kings. Many of them\ncarry the names of Armenian Kings (e.g., Hayk, Tigran,\nArshak, Gagik, Ashot, Yervand, Bagrad, etc.). They are as\nautocratic and authoritarian as their assenters were during the\nmonarchic era. Some leaders feel entitled to exercise unlim-\nited authority and freedom in decision making with little, if\nany, accountability toward others. Today's public leaders\npossess extreme wealth and lead a lavish, luxury, and royal-\ntype lifestyles.\n3. After the fall of the Cilician Kingdom in the 14th cen-\ntury, Armenians lost their independence and for the\nnext five centuries, until the beginning of the 19th cen-\ntury, they lived and survived under foreign regimes:\nOttoman, current Turkish, Russian, and the former\nSoviet Union.\nImplications: A significant number of Armenians today\nbelieve that Armenia will not survive without foreign pow-\ners. This mind-set of dependency seems to be the product of\nthe nation's survival history under foreign oppressors in the\nlast 600 years. For instance, although the country regained its\nindependence in 1991, today's Armenia is politically and\neconomically dependent on Russia's strong military pres-\nence in Armenia and the economic investments of the\nWestern world.\nArmenian Church Leadership\n1. Leadership from top-down. The Armenian Church\nleadership has been top-down since its beginning. The\nnewly converted King Trtad invited St. Gregory the\nIlluminator to become the first Catholicos or Supreme\nPatriarch in the beginning of the 4th century. Thus, this\nera marks the beginning of Church-and-State relations\nand its impact on the development of hierarchical lead-\nership in the Armenian Church.\nImplications: The Armenian Church today seeks the\nState's participation and support to carry out its mission in\nthe society, much like in the time of the King Trtad.\n2. Leadership from bottom-up. Despite the fact that the\nChurch leadership was primarily hierarchical and male\ndominated, the Church was able to mobilize clergy and\nlaity for church administration, education and enlight-\nenment of the nation, and preservation of theArmenian\nchurch tradition, language, culture, and faith from\nearly-5th century until today.\nImplications: Despite the fact that the church leadership\ncontinues to be predominately hierarchical and paternalistic,\nthe relationships between clergy and laity have often been\nperceived as collaborative. For instance, the laity is given\nauthority in church governance, and elections of the church\nleaders. Thus, the church continues to maintain and exercise\nspiritual authority among the Armenian people, be the van-\nguard for human development and education, and remain the\nmost powerful institution called for the preservation of\nChristian and cultural identity of the Armenian people.\n3. From late-14th until early-20th centuries, the Armenian\nChurch played dual leadership roles, spiritual and\npolitical, in the life of the Armenian people.\n8 SAGE Open\nImplications: The church leadership continues to see its\ndual role in the society, which often causes confusion and\ntension between civil and spiritual authorities.\nConstitutionally, the Church and State are separated.\nHowever, since the independence, both clergy and laity see\nthe role of the Armenian Church to be important not only in\nspiritual but also in political life of the nation. Moreover, the\nArmenian Church feels entitled to occupy a special role in\nthe life of the nation among other Christian denominations in\nArmenia.\n4. Leadership of powerlessness and persecution. As a\nresult of Soviet persecution, many clergymen lost their\nlives. Thousands of churches and Christian communi-\nties were destroyed in both cities and villages.\nImplications: The Communist era fundamentally changed\nthe role and the image of the Church leadership among ordi-\nnary people.Anew generation of atheistArmenians emerged,\nwho devalued the Armenian Church's spiritual role in soci-\nety. These spiritual leaders were prohibited to provide spiri-\ntual nurturing and Christian education to their flock.\nHowever, a new generation of clergymen emerged in the\nChurch as compromisers with the Soviet government and\nKGB (Komitet Gosudarstvenniy Bezopasnosti [Committee\nof Government Security]). This generation of clergymen still\nexists in the church.\n5. Leadership of transition and confusion. Since the 1991\nindependence, the Armenian Church has been in transi-\ntion. The Church and the society still struggle in\nredefining the Church's role in today's society.\nConstitutionally, the Church is separated from the State.\nImplications: On one hand, the Church is eager to restore\nits 4th-century role of Church\u00adState partnership; on the other\nhand, it continues to face opposition from its own secular-\nized and post-Soviet society as well as the secular state of the\nRepublic of Armenia. Another key player for Church\u00adState\nseparation is the European Union (EU), which sets the latter\nas criteria for Armenia's membership with EU. As a result,\nthe tensions are being escalated between the newly formed\ndemocratic institutions and the centuries-old Armenian\nChurch, the preserver of the Armenian identity, culture, and\npeople.\nArmenian National Leadership\n1. The Armenian people, in both western and eastern\nArmenia, have invested profound trust and hope in\nnational leaders to obtain freedom and independence.\nThe military commanders and those who dedicated\ntheir lives for the freedom of Armenians have become\nnational heroes and exemplary leaders for the\nArmenian people. The Armenian nationalist sentiment\nof early-20th century advocated political freedom\nthrough violent resistance. This notion carried through\nthe Soviet era and found support with current\nArmenian national leaders' understanding of justice\nand freedom for the Armenian people. This notion is\nstill strong among national leaders who are in power\nin Armenia today.\nImplications: It was during the period of post\u00adWorld War\nI revolutions when the Armenian society was most secular-\nized. Some turned their back to the Church and Christianity\nby advocating for violent and armed revolt against the\nnation's enemies. This anti-Christian propaganda provided a\nfertile soil for Communist ideology to prosper in Armenia in\nearly-20th century. Later, as seen in history, the Bolsheviks\nwere able to overthrow the first Armenian Republic in 1920.\nInterestingly enough, unlike the above period, the national\nleaders in cooperation with the Armenian Church leaders\nwere able to mobilize Armenians in Armenia and around the\nworld to defend Nagorno-Karabakh, a newly declared and\nindependent state from the Soviet Socialist Azerbaijan in late\n2. As seen above, the Armenian literature has shaped the\nnational identity of Armenians and fueled energy for\nthe formation of national leadership in Armenia for\nyears. Epic heroes and legends created exemplary\nimages and ethos for national leadership for more than\na hundred years. Writers of the 19th and 20th centuries,\nby using historical incidents, produced patriotic and\nideal leadership models for generations to follow.\nTheir utmost expression was found in the stories and\nlives of national-military leaders. In the midst of the\nstruggle for independence and the loss of national sov-\nereignty, national leaders provided hope for the future.\nThe fact that national patriots did not spare their lives\nfor the independence of Armenia has had a tremendous\nmoral impact on the Armenian people. These patriots\nfelt responsible for protecting their homes, villages,\ncities, and the entire country from enemies at the cost\nof their own lives.\nImplications: The national leadership with its patriotism,\nsocial responsibility, and love of one's own people and the\ncountry, continues to influence masses and exercise moral\nauthority in Armenia today.\nCommunist Leadership\n1. To the disappointment of many Soviet Communists,\nbeginning from the early stage until Gorbachev's\nPerestroika in late 1980s, Marxist predictions for a\nrich, prosperous, and just society just did not realize.\nThis led to ideological, economic, and political vac-\nuum and later--corruption.\nMalakyan 9\nImplications: As a result of the deterioration of the Soviet\nideology, people resisted following Communist leaders, who\nthemselves were not ideal models for a society of justice and\nequality.\n2.Armenian women played a significant role in Communist\nsociety more than ever in the history of the nation.\nIronically, Communists were less discriminatory against\nwomen than was the Christian Church in Armenia.\nWomen in the Soviet society were encouraged to receive\neducation and take leadership roles. Twelve percent of\nCommunist leaders in the former Soviet Union were\nfemales and Armenia was not an exception.\nImplications: The Communist era produced a significant\nnumber of educated, professional, and self-reliant women in\nthe Armenian society, who later became political as well as\norganizational leaders for the Republic of Armenia.\nDemocratic Leadership\n1. The democratic leaders in Armenia, who were both for-\nmer Communist leaders or Party members and national\nleaders started well in early 1990s but soon became\ncorrupt due to lack of accountability and moral charac-\nter. Within few years, a newly emerged millionaires\nformed oligarchy took control of the country's entire\neconomy and political life.\nImplications: Armenia became one of the poorest coun-\ntries in the world with more than 40% poverty and below the\npoverty rate. Millions of Armenians have left the country\nfrom late 1990 until today for physical and economic sur-\nvival. The middle class, once formed during the Soviet era,\ndisappeared and the gap between rich and poor increased\nsignificantly.\n2. As mentioned above, most election results were either\nfalsified, bought, or imposed on ordinary citizens.\nPeople, due to their financial needs, were seduced to\nselling their votes openly to politicians who offered\nmonetary rewards.\nImplications: Due to voting frauds, selling votes, and\nstuffing, people not only lost faith in elections and the demo-\ncratic processes of governance but also became corrupt\nthemselves by participating in those immoral behaviors.\nResult\nThe historical data and the contemporary situation of\nArmenia's public leadership behavior indicate the following\nrelationships that continue to exist between currentArmenian\nleadership behaviors and the nation's historical models of\nleadership:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Millennia-long monarchic mind-set is still present in\nthe memories and behaviors of those who occupy\nleadership positions in Armenia. Most males not only\ncarry the names of ancient Armenian kings but also\ntheir lifestyle and leadership styles.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Armenian Church Leadership is a contemporary with\nit hierarchical structure and mind-set. The same hier-\narchical subordination is present in the society\nbetween leaders and followers, male and female, and\nin other community and organizational relationships.\nMoreover, the Armenian Church continues to be the\nrole of spiritual hegemony for the Armenian people.\nPeople submit to the authority of the Church and\nrespect their leaders. Thus, the Armenian Church's\nimpact on the Armenian society and its historical leg-\nacy, including its influence on today's political pro-\ncesses, cannot be minimized or ignored.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 National Leadership. The Armenian literature, both\npre-Christian and post-Christian eras, continues to\ninspire and shape the Armenian worldview. Patriotic\nwriters of the 19th- and 20th-centuriesArmenia, includ-\ning scientists, artists, and national and church heroes\noccupy the pages of Armenia's history and educational\ntextbooks from elementary to high school, and from\ncollege to university education. One of the brightest\nevidence of this is the Armenian currency, the dram.\nbills are the faces of Yeghishe Charents (poet),\nHovhannes Toumanyan (poet-writer),Avetik Isahakyan\n(poet-writer), and Martiros Saryan (painter). Moreover,\nmost streets and towns are names after national war-\nriors, poets, writers, artists, church leaders, and political\nleaders who fought for the nation's independence.\nThese leaders were not necessarily democratic leaders\nin its Western understanding.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Although the Communist leadership externally dis-\nappeared, internally it continues to exist. Today's\nmost political leaders are the product of the Soviet\nsociety. They have been trained and educated during\nthe Soviet era and most of them have seen only\nSoviet style of leadership. These leaders lacked\nalternative models of leading, managing, and gov-\nerning. In fact, some Communist leaders or the\nParty members, right after the collapse of the Soviet\nUnion, were transformed into democratic leaders\novernight. For instance, number of cabinet members\nof the first President of Armenia, Levon Ter-\nPetrosyan, and members of the first Armenian\nParliament, were either former Communist leaders\nor members of the Communist Party. Thus, those of\nus who grew up during the Soviet era see no differ-\nence between Communist leadership styles and cur-\nrent democratic leadership styles. The names seem\nto have changed but leaders' behaviors and world-\nviews remained the same.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Armenian Democratic Leadership. The Western dem-\nocratic form of governance seems foreign to today's\nArmenian leaders. It has been more than 20 years\nsince the democratization process began in Armenia;\nhowever, it did not produce the expected results,\ndespite the fact that all the necessary democratic insti-\ntutions, laws, and governing policies were created by\nthe support of Western powers and foreign investors.\nIn other words, the existing democratic system has not\nbeen working well for the people of Armenia. As\nmentioned above, most presidential and parliamen-\ntary elections have been handled undemocratically\nboth by the voters and candidates. Instead, the so-\ncalled democratic leaders in Armenia demonstrate\nmonarchic behaviors through their autocratic style of\nleadership and wasteful lifestyles. Finally, despite the\nfact that the country continues to struggle with high\nunemployment rate and extreme poverty, the demo-\ncratic leaders who are in power continue to become\nricher more than the Communist leaders at times. The\nleaderships of the Republic of Armenia seem more\ncorrupt than the Communist leaders in the former\nSoviet Socialist Republic of Armenia.\nConclusion\nOut of five leadership models, three are visible today:\nChurch, National, and Democratic leadership. However, the\nother two, Monarchic and Communist, continue to exist\ninvisibly in the memories as well as in the behaviors of\nArmenian leaders today. Thus, it can be said that the past\nleadership models are very present in Armenia both visibly\nand invisibly.\nThis study shows that the indigenous leadership history of\nArmenia has significantly impacted leaders' behaviors. For\ninstance, as a result of enduring under oppressive rules in the\nlast 600 years, today's leaders seem dependent on foreign aid\nand lack confidence in the nation's ability to maintain\nnational independence. Thus, it can be said that history\nshould matter in leadership studies and that human behaviors\nare the product of one's past experiences that shape people's\npersonal as well as social identities.\nThis study also shows that democracy cannot be exported\nfrom the West or imported to Armenia without considering\nthe historical characteristics of the Armenian people. Thus,\nthe democratic mind-set must be present in people's world-\nview in the first place before anticipating any behavioral,\nsocial or organizational change, in this case in Armenia.\nMoreover, the presence of democratic institutions seems\ninsufficient to bring about the desired change. The fact that\ndemocratic laws and policies that have existed in Armenia\nfor nearly two decades have not sufficiently democratized\nthe country is evidence of the Western failed attempts.\nIt is evident from the study that one leadership model has\nnot been sufficient to fully address the leadership challenges\nin Armenia. Perhaps the integration of all five leadership\nmodels may offer some solutions to the leadership problems\nthat exist in Armenia today.\nRecommendation for Further Research\nThis study has its limitations, which makes difficult to rec-\nommend solutions to the discussed leadership problems in\nArmenia. There seem to be other variables in the leadership\ncontext of Armenia that deserve attention and further study.\nFor instance, the Armenian cultural worldview cannot be\nignored, because it shapes the leaders' identity and influ-\nences their behavior and leadership style. Thus, there seem to\nbe a need for further research and study about Armenian\nleadership behavior in light of leadership styles and cultural\ncharacteristics to be able to gain anthropological understand-\ning of why leaders in the Armenian cultural context behave\nthe way they behave. Therefore, to address the leadership\nissues in Armenia holistically, one may acquire further\nknowledge in the areas of cultural characteristics and leader-\nship styles.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. Sources that acknowledge other kingdoms in Armenia such\nas Ani, Vaspurakan, Kars, and Syunik are beyond the purpose\nand the scope of this study. The goal was not to present an\nexhaustive list of all Armenian kings and princes through ages,\nbut rather to acknowledge Monarchy as the dominant leader-\nship style of Armenians from Bronze Age until the second half\nof the 14th century.\n2.
