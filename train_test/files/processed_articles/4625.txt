    "abstract": "Abstract\nEmpirical work has shown that people like visual symmetry. We used a gaze-driven evolutionary\nalgorithm technique to answer three questions about symmetry preference. First, do people\nautomatically evaluate symmetry without explicit instruction? Second, is perfect symmetry the\nbest stimulus, or do people prefer a degree of imperfection? Third, does initial preference for\nsymmetry diminish after familiarity sets in? Stimuli were generated as phenotypes from an\nalgorithmic genotype, with genes for symmetry (coded as deviation from a symmetrical template,\ndeviation\u00adsymmetry, DS gene) and orientation (0 to 90, orientation, ORI gene). An eye tracker\nidentified phenotypes that were good at attracting and retaining the gaze of the observer. Resulting\nfitness scores determined the genotypes that passed to the next generation. We recorded changes\nto the distribution of DS and ORI genes over 20 generations. When participants looked for\nsymmetry, there was an increase in high-symmetry genes. When participants looked for the\npatterns they preferred, there was a smaller increase in symmetry, indicating that people\ntolerated some imperfection. Conversely, there was no increase in symmetry during free viewing,\nand no effect of familiarity or orientation. This work demonstrates the viability of the evolutionary\nalgorithm approach as a quantitative measure of aesthetic preference.\n",

Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in this area,\nwith new conferences, journals, and the application of modern techniques from cognitive\nneuroscience (Chatterjee, 2011). We are not at the stage where empirical aesthetics can\nprovide a workable recipe for the production of appealing designs. However, theories\ninspired by cognitive science have led to insights into the nature of preference formation\nand the appreciation of art (Arnheim, 1974; Leder, Belke, Oeberst, & Augustin, 2004;\n1999). Moreover, empirical studies have also provided reliable results: For example,\nsymmetrical abstract patterns are rated as more beautiful than random patterns by the\nThe appeal of symmetry is interesting because it is not limited to humans and is thus unlikely\nto be a cultural whim. Many species have a preference for symmetrical mates (M\u00f8ller &\nThornhill, 1998) and symmetrical foods (Wignall, Heiling, Cheng, & Herberstein, 2006).\nSymmetry might be a predictor of attractiveness ratings in faces (Rhodes, Proffitt, Grady, &\nwhile Ramachandran and Hirstein (1999) listed preference for symmetry as one of their laws of\nartistic experience. There are plausible arguments for why symmetry should be so appealing:\nThe body plan of most animals has bilateral reflectional symmetry, so if development proceeds\naccording to the genetic template, adult phenotype should be approximately symmetrical.\nSymmetry thus indicates health and reproductive fitness (Grammer, Fink, M\u00f8ller, &\nThornhill, 2003). Prevalence of symmetry in human designs and abstract patterns could be\nan overgeneralization of a perceptual mechanism designed to detect health and genetic quality.\nOn the other hand, attractiveness of symmetry is not some fixed rule in nature. The\nevidence that people find symmetrical faces and bodies most sexually attractive is mixed:\nThe effect size could even be zero after correcting for publication bias (van Dongen, 2011).\nThe correlation between body symmetry and developmental integrity is also weak (e.g.,\nHope, Bates, Dykiert, Der, & Deary, 2015). Moreover, the size of the asymmetries in\nanimals is small compared with the size of the features themselves. Given lab work on\nsymmetry detection, it seems that the putative ``fitness signal'' might often be invisible.\nThis is especially important given additional degradation of visual signals in natural\nsettings, where viewing conditions are disoptimal (Swaddle, 1999). It has also been noted\nthat symmetry is confounded with averageness in a population: That is, symmetrical animals\nare average animals. The significance of this was highlighted by Enquist and Johnstone\n(1997), who presented an artificial neural network with two sets of training stimuli. The\ntraining patterns were symmetrical on average, but individually, they were either lopsided\nto the left or right. If the training sets were similar, then symmetrical test stimuli produced a\nlarger response than any of the lopsided training patterns alone. Thus, increasing sensitivity\nto symmetrical variants emerges whenever networks exhibit generalization, and when they\nare exposed to a fluctuating population with a symmetrical mean. Both these conditions are\nmet in nature, and the emergent strong visual response to symmetry could result in positive\nevaluation. A related view is that the visual system is tuned to symmetry as part of the process\nof 3D shape analysis, and preference for symmetry may be a by-product of efficient\nprocessing (Mascalzoni, Osorio, Regolin, & Vallortigara, 2012).\nDespite the well-rehearsed debate about the evolution of symmetry preferences, the\nconditions under which this positive evaluation occurs are yet to be fully documented.\nWhen participants are forced to rate the aesthetic appeal of abstract patterns, symmetry is\nusually liked: But is symmetry evaluated spontaneously, even when people are not forced to\n2 i-Perception\nmake an aesthetic evaluation? Jacobsen and Ho\nrecording event-related potentials (ERPs) produced by subjectively beautiful and ugly\nabstract black and white patterns. ERPs sensitive to regularity were found in all\nconditions, while ERPs that distinguished between beautiful and ugly patterns were only\npresent during explicit evaluation. Ho\n\u00a8 fel and Jacobsen (2007) found comparable results\nand concluded that: ``Aesthetic appreciation of beauty appears to require intention and is\nnot spontaneous in character'' (p. 30).\nTo reiterate, ERP results show that the visual system automatically discriminates\nsymmetrical and random patterns, but that affective systems do not spontaneously evaluate\nthe patterns. There is a posterior ERP component that differs for symmetrical and random\npresentations. This is found when people are attending to regularity and classifying the\npatterns as regular or random, and when they are attending to some other feature of the\ndisplay, such as the color of the elements (Makin, Rampone, & Bertamini, 2015). This\nautomatic visual processing is apparently in stark contrast with aesthetic evaluation: ERPs\nthat distinguish between subjectively beautiful and ugly patterns are not generated when\nunless people are engaged in aesthetic evaluation (Jacobsen & Hofel, 2003; Ho\n\u00a8 fel &\nJacobsen, 2007). When we talk about ``evaluation'' of symmetry, we are not talking about\nvisual detection and processing of symmetry (which is automatic), but rather aesthetic\nevaluation, that is, is the pattern good or bad, attractive or unattractive, pleasing or\ndispleasing, and so on (which may or may not be automatic).\nMore recent research has employed implicit measures of preference to ascertain the\nconditions for automatic evaluation. Studies using the Implicit Association Test (IAT;\nNosek, Greenwald, & Banaji, 2007) have shown that symmetry is more easily associated\nwith positive words and random with negative words (Bertamini, Makin, & Rampone, 2013;\nMakin, Pecchinenda, & Bertamini, 2012). However, the IAT procedure merely shows that the\nconceptual dimensions ``symmetry-random'' and ``positive-negative'' are orientated in a\ncommon direction (see Walker, 2012 for other examples of dimensional correspondences).\nThe IAT experiments do not demonstrate spontaneous aesthetic evaluation in a strong sense.\nOther work has used the affective priming technique (Bertamini, Makin, & Pecchinenda, 2013).\nAbstract patterns were briefly flashed, followed by a word, which participants classified as\npositive or negative. If symmetrical patterns are spontaneously evaluated as positive, they\nshould facilitate processing of positive words. Likewise, if random patterns are\nspontaneously evaluated as negative, they should facilitate processing of negative words.\nHowever, no such priming effect was found without modification of the procedure that\nforced the participants to classify the prime pattern as well as the words. In summary,\npreference for symmetry over random is nearly universal when people explicitly consider\naesthetic merit, but there is no evidence that the irresistible attractiveness of abstract\nsymmetry automatically pops out and forces itself on the observer. The first question in the\ncurrent work is whether there are conditions in which symmetry is evaluated automatically.\nSymmetry can be detected when it is less than perfect, for example, when the individual\nelements are jittered around a symmetrical template (Barlow & Reeves, 1979). Do people like\nperfect symmetry in abstract patterns most? Different models of aesthetics make different\npredictions: Zeki (1999) argues that artists are experts in isolating and maximizing excitation\nof visual modules. It is known that perfect symmetry produces more neural excitation in\nvisual areas than degraded symmetry (Sasaki, Vanduffel, Knutsen, Tyler, & Tootell, 2005).\nAccording to the optimal stimulation account of Zeki (1999), perfect symmetry should be\npreferred over noisy symmetry. The fluency-attribution account of aesthetics suggests people\nare sensitive to the efficiency of their own perceptual and cognitive processes and that fluent\nprocessing has positive hedonic tone, which can sometimes lead to a positive evaluation of\nMakin et al. 3\nthe stimulus (Reber, 2012). Again, perfect symmetry is detected more quickly, so should\ntheoretically be preferred. Others have considered the importance of perceptual ambiguity\nin aesthetic experience; for example, van de Cruys and Wagemans (2011) considered\nappreciation of art within the framework of the hierarchical predictive coding model\n(Clark, 2013; Rao & Ballard, 1999). They argue that the essence of aesthetic appeal and\nthe fascination of art arise from resolution of perceptual ambiguity, resulting in a sudden\nreduction of prediction error signals. This account suggests that hidden regularity with added\nnoise may be more appealing than a relatively stable and predictable perfect regularity. More\ngenerally, the idea that perfect symmetry is too rigid and unlifelike has been traced as far\nback as Kant (as discussed in McManus, 2005). Therefore, the second question in the current\nwork is whether people prefer perfect or imperfect symmetry.\nA third question about symmetry preference concerns its development over time. People's\npreferences do not remain stable and fixed indefinitely. Indeed, the dynamics of prototype\nformation and challenge in human creations have been well studied, and liking for a\nparticular design or artistic genre cannot be isolated from history (Cutting, 2003). For\nexample, preference for car design is fundamentally shaped what has gone before, and\nwhat seems modern or innovative (Carbon, 2010). Meanwhile, it has long been known\nthat mere exposure to stimulus can increase its appeal (Bornstein, 1989; Zajonc, 1968). So,\neven though preference for symmetry is possibly the result of evolutionary processes and not\nrelatively short-term cultural dynamics, there could nevertheless be some moderating\ninfluence of familiarity and exposure (Tinio & Leder, 2009).\nIn summary, the literature about the aesthetic appeal of symmetry leaves three unresolved\nquestions: (a) Is symmetry evaluated spontaneously? (b) Do people prefer perfect symmetry\nor ambiguous symmetry? (c) Do preferences for abstract patterns systematically shift with\nfamiliarity? We address these three research questions using a gaze-driven evolutionary\nalgorithm technique (GDEA), which has already been used in other contexts, for example,\nto study preference for color\u00adshape combinations and commercial graphics (Holmes &\nIn our study, the stimuli were 12-dot computer-generated patterns, with an orientation and a\ndegree of symmetry (Figure 1). The essential point of the genetic algorithm is the visible\ncharacteristics of the stimuli are like the phenotype, controlled by a virtual genotype. Real-\ntime feedback from an eye tracker is used to assess which phenotypes were most successful in\nattracting the participant's gaze. Over the course of the experiment, the stimuli evolve to become\nmore and more like those stimuli that were frequently fixated in earlier generations. The\npopulation of virtual genes at the end of the experiment therefore reflect the combination of\ncharacteristics that best attracted participants gaze and were fixated longest. We compared the\ntrajectory of virtual genetic drift in three different groups of 18 participants: (a) Participants\nexplicitly looking for symmetry, (b) participants explicitly looking for their preferred patterns,\nand (c) participants in a free-viewing condition, without explicit instructions.\nThere are two advantages to using feedback from an eye tracker, rather than a mouse or\ntouchpad. First, it allowed us to explore preference in the free-viewing condition. Second, it\nallowed us to efficiently obtain a continuous measure of fitness for each of the four patterns\npresented, based on carefully calibrated oculomotor metrics, rather than a single binary choice.\nMethod\nParticipants\nFifty-four participants were involved (aged 17 to 47, 17 men, 4 left handed). Participants\nreceived course credit or \u00bb5 reimbursement for travel expenses. The study had local ethics\n4 i-Perception\ncommittee approval and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki\nApparatus\nwas 34 of visual angle. Head position was stabilized with a chin rest. The position of the\nright eye was monitored continuously with an Applied Science Laboratories Eye Trac-6000\ninfrared eye tracker (ASL, Bedford, MA) sampling at 120 Hz. The GDEA was implemented\nin Matlab 2011a (Mathworks, Cambridge, MA) using code similar to previous work (Holmes\n& Zanker, 2013). Stimuli were rendered using functions from the Cogent library\nFigure 1. (a) Construction of a single phenotype from the distance from symmetry (DS) and orientation\n(ORI) genes. This is a schematic only, not an accurate rendering of the stimuli, like those shown in Figure 1(b)\nand (c). The dots were all the same gray color in the real stimuli. (b) Screen shot from the first generation\nwithout systematic genetic drift. (c) Screenshot from a later population typical of the preference group,\nwhere the participants had been fixating the more symmetrical patterns.\nMakin et al. 5\n(www.vislab.ucl.ac.uk/cogent.php). To this end, fixations were assessed to assign fitness\nscores to the genotypes.\nStimuli and Procedure\nEach trial began with a 1 s fixation period with a central cross, followed by an array of four\ndot patterns, visible for approximately 5 s. Generation steps and example patterns are shown\nin Figure 1. All patterns were presented on a circular background with a diameter, which was\nset a quarter of screen width (8.5). The background was black (RGB \u00bc 0, 0, 0), and the\ndot elements, which were mid-gray (RGB \u00bc 0.5, 0.5, 0.5). Dot size was chosen at six\nincremental steps between 0.9 and 1.5. A single dot of each size was presented on each\nside of a visible black midline. Previous work has show that vertical reflection is most salient,\nfollowed by horizontal then oblique, but that that these effects disappear if orientation is\npredictable (Wenderoth, 1994). We wanted people to see the degraded symmetry even for the\ndifficult orientations, despite the fact that orientation was not predictable. We thus included a\nvisible midline to make the axis reflectional symmetry and the orientation as obvious as\npossible. Dots were free to overlap. The four stimuli were not symmetrically placed in the\nfour quadrants of the screen, but a degree of jitter was introduced on X and Y dimensions\n(minimum 0, maximum 0.33). This feature was designed to prevent the four stimuli forming\na large perceptual grouping that was itself symmetrical.\nGenetic Algorithm\nThe genetic algorithm has, at its core, a simulation of the processes of natural selection that\nhave shaped living organisms. The stimuli seen on the screen are phenotypes, and their\nfeatures are coded by a virtual genotype. In our case, the virtual chromosome has a\nsymmetry gene (coding deviation from perfect symmetry as a distance, DS gene) and an\norientation gene (coding angle of the symmetry axis, ORI gene). There was also a binary\nangle gene (BINA gene), which allowed for meaningful genotype-to-phenotype translation of\nthe ORI gene, as described later. Other stimulus parameters were chosen independently of the\ngenetic algorithm (e.g., the size of the background disks did not vary, and neither did the\ncolor of the stimuli).\nThree stimulus genes. The DS gene could vary continuously between 0 and 4.25. This range\ncreated phenotypes which were either totally symmetrical or where the symmetrical template\nwas completely invisible (the upper limit was somewhat arbitrary, but allowed for complete\nobliteration of symmetry in the visible phenotype). For each pattern, position was chosen\nrandomly for half the elements, and the mirror image of these positions were set for the other\nhalf. This meant that it was highly unlikely that two patterns were identical, even if they had\nthe same DS alleles. The DS gene coded the distance a dot deviated from this symmetrical\ntemplate. The direction of deviation was randomized. For a value of 0, the pattern would be\nperfectly symmetrical, while larger values for the DS gene code for larger deviations from\nsymmetry. If the combination of element position and DS gene resulted in element\ncoordinates beyond the perimeter of the patterns or midline, new values for the random\nparameters were chosen until the constraints were satisfied.\nThe ORI gene coded the orientation of the axis of symmetry. This could vary between 0\n(vertical) and 90 (horizontal). A third gene-coded angle (BINA gene). This gene was\nbinary--that is, either 1 or\u00c01, and ORI \u00c2 BINA set the actual orientation of the axis.\n6 i-Perception\nThis implementation detail is important because it meant the ORI gene could\nmeaningfully be interpreted during analysis: Consider the consequences of an ORI gene\nthat could vary between 0 and 360. The alleles 0 and 360 would produce perceptually\nidentical results, but be as different as it is possible to be on the scale. Likewise, if the ORI\ngene could range from 0 to 180, the same would be true for horizontal orientations--The\nextreme values for the gene would lead to perceptually identical horizontal symmetry. Having\na range of 0 to 90 allows a meaningful match between genotype and phenotype, which is\nessential for assigning fitness scores based on oculomotor feedback. The BINA gene performs\na secondary function of allowing leftward and rightward tilts within these constraints, and\nwas not analyzed.\nSimulated genetic evolution over generations. Some parameters of the genetic algorithm had\nto be selected in advance: for example, the number of generations, trials within a\ngeneration, and so on. It is not clear a priori what the optimal parameters should be.\nHowever, in making these decisions, we drew on pilot data, where we were able to drive\nevolution deliberately in a particular direction at will, say toward symmetry or toward\nvertical patterns. We also drew on previous experience with oculomotor genetic algorithms\nand with these codes (Holmes & Zanker, 2012), which suggests that the concurrent\npresentation of four stimuli is optimal for evaluating oculomotor fitness in such an\nEach participant starts with a randomly generated population of 48 different patterns\n(phenotypes) which were generated from the specific range of possible values (alleles) for\nthe DS, ORI, and BINA genes.

This method reduces\nthe elapsed time of the experiment, and consequently the risk of fatigue effects and perceptual\nlearning. Figure 1(b) shows a screenshot from the first generation, where the four phenotypes\nare set by four genotypes from starting population.\nEach run of the experiment comprised 20 generations, which is sufficient for reliable\nconvergence with such a small number of genes (Holmes, 2010). While participants were\nviewing the stimuli, the fixations were recorded continuously with an eye tracker. After\npresentation, each phenotype was assigned a fitness score, based on the amount of time\nthe pattern was fixated by the participant (and other oculomotor metrics, see subsequent\ntext). The fitness scores of the presented phenotypes were then used to estimate fitness scores\nfor the (32) unpresented population members. The scored population members were then\nentered into a series of tournaments consisting of random samples of Size 3, with the two\nfittest members from each sample being used as ``parents'' in a reproduction process which\ncombined genes from both members together with a random mutation process to produce new\noffsprings. Thirty-two such offsprings were created and used to replace the least-fit 32 members\nof the population, thus the population size remained constant throughout, and this process has\nbeen shown to ensure that the average fitness of the population increases monotonically with\nIf participants had no systematic tendency to fixate particular phenotypes, the final\npopulation would not differ from the first population and would have approximately the\nsame genetic makeup. However, if participants systematically fixated certain phenotypes\n(e.g., those with near-perfect symmetry), the population will evolve to be more like the\nfixated phenotypes (e.g., more and more symmetrical).\nMakin et al. 7\nAll participants viewed two evolutionary runs which had exactly the same settings and\nparameters but were totally independent of each other. For half the participants, the runs\nwere interleaved. For the other half, the runs were separate blocks. In supplementary\nanalysis, we found no interactions involving the between subjects factors Run (One, Two)\nor Run Arrangement (interleaved runs, separate runs) and the within subjects factor\ndata from both runs for all subsequent analysis.\nAssigning fitness scores based on oculomotor statistics. In order to simulate natural selection, there\nneeds to be some means to calculate, or at least estimate, the fitness of each population\nmember. This fitness score is used to select parents for future offspring using a\ntournament-based method that ensures that the strongest population members are most\nlikely to pass their features on to the next generation (Miller & Goldberg, 1995). Here, a\ncombination of oculomotor measures associated with aesthetic preference was taken from the\neye-tracker recordings. This measure uses a weighted sum of the total time spent fixating each\nimage. To quantify this, a dispersion fixation filter was used (I-DT; Salvucci & Goldberg,\n2000), with a gaze position radius of 0.5 and a minimum duration of 100 ms. The sequence of\nfirst fixations on each image and the amount of revisits to each image was used to calculate a\nscore between 0 and 1. The fitness score represents the amount of attention being directed\ntoward each image. The speed of oculomotor responses was not taken into account when\ncalculating fitness. Because only 25% of the population is presented in each generation, the\nfitness scores for the remaining 75% of the population were estimated using a least-squares\napproximation of the fitness based on the scores for the eye-tracked phenotypes and their\nproximity to the unpresented (non\u00adeye-tracked) phenotypes. Further mathematical details\nare provided in Holmes and Zanker (2012).\nSymmetry, Preference, and Free Viewing Tasks\nA crucial feature of our study was task instruction, which varied between groups of\nparticipants. Eighteen participants were given the instruction to look for the most\nsymmetrical pattern of the four available, and fixate it until the end of the 5 second trial\n(symmetry instruction). This should provide the strongest possible selection pressure toward\nlow DS alleles, and very symmetrical phenotypes. This provided a baseline: How symmetrical\nwould the final population be if symmetry were the only criterion for fixation?\nAnother 18 participants were told to look for the patterns they liked most, with no further\ninstruction (preference instruction). Here, we can see whether symmetry evolves in the\npopulation and to what degree (perfect or less than perfect). We can also see if preferences\nchange over time. For example, participants may begin to like the less regular patterns once\nsymmetry becomes too familiar, resulting in a subsequent rebound toward random in later\ngenerations. Finally, 18 participants were not given specific task instructions, other than\nto pay close attention to the stimuli on the screen, rather than looking somewhere else in\nthe room (free-viewing instruction). If symmetry is attractive in the absence of any\ninstructions, the population should evolve to become more symmetrical in this group\nas well. After all, it is thought that people spontaneously seek out and attend to\naesthetically pleasing stimuli (Biederman & Vessel, 2006). We also ran the program\nwithout a participant or any feedback from the eye tracker 18 times. This ensured that\napparent effects were due to gaze contingent evolution, and not some unforeseen artifact\nin the program (control condition).\n8 i-Perception\nResults\nFor the three groups of participants in the different instruction conditions (symmetry,\npreference, and free viewing), we measured the median value for the DS and ORI genes in\nPopulations 1 to 20. There were no systematic effects on orientation (Figure 2a). Evolution\nof the DS gene is shown in Figure 2(b). For the 18 free-viewing participants, who were given\nno instruction, there was little shift away from the start population. This data were very\nsimilar to the control condition, where there was no participant and no feedback from the\neye tracker. For 18 participants who were looking for symmetry, the population changed to\nbecome more and more symmetrical. The most interesting result was from the 18 participants\nwho were looking for their preferred pattern. In this case, there was again a clear shift toward\nsymmetrical populations, as in the symmetry group. However, the DS gene did not shift so\nfar in the preference group as in the symmetry group. This suggests that participants were\nhappy with less-than-perfect symmetry. Figure 1(c) shows screenshot typical of the last\ngeneration of the preference task, where DS reach a median value of around 0.5 visual angle.\nStatistical analysis confirmed these impressions. Median values for DS and ORI genes in\neach population were submitted to mixed analyses of variance. There was one within-subjects\nfactor, generation, with 20 levels, and one between-subjects factor, instruction, with 4 levels,\ninstruction (symmetry, preference, free viewing, control). The Greenhouse Geisser correction\nFigure 2. (a) Change in the orientation (ORI) gene (which codes angle of the visible midline) from\nGenerations 1 to 20 (averaged over all participants).

Figure 2(c) shows the difference in DS between the first\ngeneration and the average of the final five generations in for each subject in the\npreference group. All but one subject had a preference for symmetry, leading to negative\nvalues for DS change. In the free-viewing condition (Figure 2d), perhaps 6 of the 18 subjects\nspontaneously engage in similar behavior, resulting in a substantial negative DS change and\nconsequential shift toward symmetrical populations. However, an equal number pushed\nevolution in the opposite direction, that is, toward random.\nDiscussion\nWhen participants were explicitly told to look for the most symmetrical patterns, the final\npopulation was far more symmetrical than the first population (Figure 2b). This condition\nprovides a baseline, showing maximum amount of symmetry that can evolve under the\nparameters of our evolutionary algorithm, when the participant's only aim was to provide\nthe selection pressure toward increasing symmetry. Here, people were trying to breed\nsymmetrical population of patterns by biasing reproduction in favor of high-symmetry\ngenes. This can be contrasted with the preference condition. Participants were told to look\nfor the patterns they liked most, without any mention of symmetry. They again drove the\npopulation toward increasing symmetry. However, this selection pressure was not so strong,\nand a greater level of noise was tolerated in the later populations.\nPreference for symmetrical abstract patterns has been demonstrated with a number of\ntechniques, both implicit and explicit (Bertamini, Makin, & Pecchinenda, 2013; Jacobsen &\nHo\npreference for symmetry, while preference for reflectional symmetry has been shown in many\nspecies, including bees (Rodriguez, Gumbert, de Ibarra, Kunze, & Giurfa, 2004), swallows\n(M\u00f8ller, 1992), and humans (Rhodes et al., 1998). Symmetry is a positive feature in mate and\nfood selection, possibly because it reliably signals genetic fitness (Grammer et al., 2003).\nInfants may already be attracted to symmetrical configurations (Bornstein, Ferdinandsen,\n& Gross, 1981). Preference for symmetry is not just the most widely replicated finding in\nscientific aesthetics; it is perhaps the finding that has attracted the most theoretical\nconsideration. This study is consistent with these results but also provides new insights.\nIn empirical aesthetics, observers often are asked to evaluate a pattern using a Likert scale,\nor to choose their preferred option from those presented (Palmer, Schloss, & Sammartino,\n2013). However, the genetic algorithm approach allows a richer and more ecologically valid\nmeasure of preference. The evolution of the DS gene in the preference group reflects the\ncombination of multiple and realistic factors that can be seen as an expression of liking. We\ncan say people spent more time looking at the more symmetrical patterns. More specifically,\nassigned fitness increased as the result of (a) involuntary saccades and fixations driven by\nvisual salience, (b) explicit choices about which patterns are attractive, and (c) choices about\nhow much to explore the array once a reasonably symmetrical pattern has been foveated.\nOculomotor behavior while looking for preferred patterns contains more information than a\nsingle rating. Our evolutionary algorithm integrates this information and gives a multifaceted\nmeasure of preference. With this new metric, we can see that our participant's preoccupation\nwith symmetry was somewhat less than maximal during the preference task. People were not\nsimply looking for the most symmetrical pattern and fixating on it until the end of the trial,\neven though symmetry was clearly a major driving their preferences.\nDifferent theoretical models of preference formation make diverging predictions about the\nappeal of perfection. Some accounts emphasize optimal stimulation of visual modules (Zeki,\n1999) and efficient perceptual processing (Reber, 2012). These accounts predict that people\nshould like perfect symmetry the most. Others suggest that aesthetics appeal requires\nambiguity and dynamic resolution of perceptual conflict (Van de Cruys & Wagemans,\n2011), so symmetry with some noise may be preferred. The current results suggest that a\ndegree of imperfection was desirable in these stimuli, or at least that participants did not\ndemand perfect symmetry.\nAnother interesting finding was the absence of any significant evolution in the free-viewing\ngroup. It seems that bottom-up features that could attract gaze were insufficient to produce\nmuch systematic oculomotor behavior. This result supports the conclusion of Ho\n\u00a8 fel and\nJacobsen (2007), who claimed that preference formation requires intention and is not\nspontaneous. Participants in the free-viewing group could, in theory, have simply chosen\nto engage in a preference task even though they were not instructed to do so, and looked\nto the patterns they liked most. Although this may have happened sporadically, most\nparticipants did not show enough dedication to such a task to drive substantial genetic changes\nin the virtual population. This, again, tells us something interesting about preference\nformation: Our stimuli were not aesthetically engaging enough to elicit concerted evaluation\nduring free viewing. We speculate that more interesting stimuli would lead to greater\nsimilarities between free-viewing and preference conditions. In other words, we cannot rule\nout the possibility that very different free-viewing results could emerge under other\ncircumstances or with other stimuli. For example, if the starting population contained a\nnoticeable degree of symmetry, and were designed so as to be highly aesthetically appealing,\nthe participants could indeed engage in a spontaneous preference task and drive evolution.\nHowever, there is not evidence that this occurred in our free-viewing task.\nWe speculated that preferences might change with familiarity. Participants seemed to settle\non their preference configurations less than halfway through the experiment. However, there\nwas no evidence of further dynamic changes in after this. For example, we did not see any\nevidence that participants began to dislike symmetry once it became the norm. This\nconclusion is tentative because our experiments were still relatively short. The results\ncannot generalize to the extended dynamic interplay of familiarity and innovation that\nshapes fashion and consumer choice (Carbon, 2010) or aesthetics canons (Cutting, 2003)\nover decades. We can, however, claim that there was little evidence for comparable\ndynamics on a shorter timescale here.\nFinally, we considered orientation of the reflection axis. Vertical symmetry is known to be\nmore salient than other orientations when orientation is not predictable (Wenderoth, 1994).\nWe predicted that vertical orientation could attract gaze, and there might be evolution\ntoward vertical orientations in all the conditions to some extent. However, there was no\nsystematic shift toward vertical orientations in any condition.\nLimitations and Considerations\nThe oculomotor genetic algorithm technique presented here is promising but exploratory. It\nis worth discussing four potential problems, before moving on to consider the advantages of\nthe approach over alternatives.\nFirst, we claim that participants did not demand perfect symmetry in the preference\ncondition. What if the patterns were perceptually identical to perfect symmetry in later\ngenerations? That is, our participants liked perfect symmetry, and the level of symmetry\nachieved in the preference group looked perfect, so no further evolution occurred? In other\nwords, do our results reflect a preference for imperfection, or merely the limits of visual\nsymmetry discrimination? The latter can be countered by noting that patterns evolved to\nbe significantly more symmetrical in the symmetry group than in the preference group. That\nmeans participants could have driven evolution toward a higher degree of symmetry if they\nfound the patterns unsatisfying. This was not precluded by the limits of visual symmetry\ndiscrimination.\nSecond, we claim that the lack of a rebound to random in the preference group is\ntheoretically interesting--it tells us that participants did not get bored with symmetry.\nHowever, variation in the virtual gene pool had reduced after the first few generations.\nCould evolution be stuck at the asymptote for trivial implementational reasons? We note\nthat symmetry reached a higher level than this in the group of participants who were actively\nlooking for symmetry. This suggests evolution was not stuck at the asymptote in the\npreference group. This also means that there was scope for a rebound toward random.\nThird, interpretation of the free-viewing results is complicated. We can conclusively say\nthat no substantial and consistent preferential viewing happened (unlike the preference\ncondition), but we cannot say why. There are various plausible explanations. Perhaps\npreferential looking was masked by some other spontaneously chosen scanning strategy.\nFor example, in the absence of instructions, participants (or just a significant proportion\nof participants) may have decided to look at each of the four patterns sequentially.\nAlternatively, participants could have engaged in spontaneous activities that increase local\nfixations within the stimulus rather between the four stimulus regions. Such oculomotor\nbehavior may have dominated the influence of spontaneous preference on gaze, which\nwould otherwise have driven evolution. Patterns that were more immediately salient might\nhave produced very different results under free viewing. In future work, we intend to vary the\nphenotype of the starting population, to see if evolution-toward-symmetry can sometimes\ncatch on under free-viewing conditions.\nFourth, we need to be cautious about equating the tendency to attract gaze with positive\nvalence. There are many reasons people might fixate a pattern. Most obviously, there are low-\nlevel visual features that increase salience and attract exogenous attention. It is even plausible\nthat stimuli with negative valence may attract gaze. When the algorithm assigned a high\nfitness score, this means the genes produced a pattern that was good at attracting the\nparticipants gaze: this does not necessarily mean the phenotype had positive valence.\nResearchers using the oculomotor GDEA should be mindful that, under free-viewing\nconditions, the GDEA technique only taps a certain aspect of aesthetic appeal, namely, the\nability to attract gaze.\nConclusions and Future Directions\nOne of the major methodological challenges for scientific aesthetics and consumer\npsychology is to find ways of measuring preference in ways that are not too artificial.\nHere, we explored the potential for the GDEA approach. We used preference for\nsymmetry as a paradigm case, because it has previously been demonstrated in many\nspecies, using numerous different techniques. The approach allowed new insights into this\nwell-trodden field. First, we learned that people do not always demand perfect symmetry.\nSecond, we found no symmetry preference under free-viewing conditions, when there was no\novert instruction to evaluate. Third, it was found that there was no change in preference for\nsymmetry once it has become familiar.\nThe great advantage of the evolutionary algorithm approach is that it allows rapid\nquantification of fitness. Genotypes can be imagined as multidimensional space, with one\ngene on each dimension. We can then ask, what is the optimal position in this space? In\nnature, optimal simply means having the most offspring. However, in our simulation,\n``optimal,'' means best at attracting and keeping the attention of a human observer. Here\nwe did not actualize the full potential of the approach, because we only had three genes, and\nthus three dimensions, and only two of the genes were continuous. There were not a great\nnumber of possible genotypes that would result in perceptually distinct phenotypes. In future,\nthe technique allows the addition of more genes to code factors that may influence preference.\nInclusion of a color gene is an obvious next step, as people usually have a preference for blue-\ngreen over yellow-brown (Palmer & Schloss, 2010). Patterns could then be much richer, as\nlocal color would be more or less symmetrically positioned, and color preferences could\ninteract with symmetry preferences in interesting nonlinear ways. If every possible\ncombination was presented and rated explicitly, the addition of extra dimensions would\nresult in an intolerable increase in the duration of the experiment. However, with the\ngenetic algorithm approach, this problem is greatly reduced. This methodological\nadvantage is important because the advancement of scientific aesthetics depends on being\nable to find preferences for multidimensional stimuli, rather than studying one dimension at a\ntime, which is a serious limitation (Kubovy, 2000).\nIndeed, as discussed by Holmes and Zanker (2012), aesthetic experience often relates to the\ngestalt, or whole, rather than the sum of isolated parts. The reductionist approach in\nempirical aesthetics is problematic because preference for the whole cannot usually be\ndeduced by measuring preference for the parts one at a time (Arnheim, 1974). The polar\nopposite approach is to analyze people's conscious introspections about what makes a final\npiece of art or design successful. However, introspective awareness of cognitive processes,\nsuch as those involved in aesthetic evaluation, may be far more limited than we generally\nassume (Nisbett & Wilson, 1977). The evolutionary algorithm approach is a promising new\nway to simultaneously avoid both these pitfalls.\nThe GDEA developed here could also be of use in consumer psychology, which is typically\ninterested in preferences for particular package designs or graphics. This field faces all the\nsame substantial challenges as scientific aesthetics. Again, there is the problem of finding an\noptimal point in a large multidimensional space and the problem of limited introspection. We\nthink consumer psychologists should be maximally aware of these problems and could\nconsider the GDEA as a possible way forward.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: This work began because of an EPS small grant to Marco Bertamini (2011),\nA Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellowship (ECF \u00ad 721 \u00ad 2012) sponsored Alexis Makin.\nReferences\nArnheim, R.
