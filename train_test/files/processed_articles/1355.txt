By linking the NHANES II Mortality Study with the\nMedicare end-stage kidney disease registry, we identified 189 incident\ncases of either treated end-stage kidney disease or chronic kidney\nResults: The risk of chronic kidney disease was related to physical\ninactivity both with and without adjustment for age, sex, race and\nbody-mass index. The adjusted relative risk (RR) of moderately\nactive versus very active persons was 1.2 (95% confidence interval\nRisk was also related to smoking; the RR in smokers of 1\u00ad20\ncigarettes a day versus never smokers was 1.2 (0.7\u00ad2.3), and in\nThe RR in morbidly obese (body-mass index  35 kg/m2) compared\nwith normal weight persons was 2.3 (1.1\u00ad4.9), but risk was not\nincreased for those classified as overweight or obese. Obesity risk\nappeared largely mediated by diabetes and hypertension, whereas\nphysical inactivity risk was only partly explained by these factors,\nand smoking risk was independent of them. Alcohol consumption\nwas not related to chronic kidney disease.\nConclusions: These data suggest that physical inactivity, smoking\nand morbid obesity contribute to the risk of chronic kidney disease.\nKey Words: cohort study, end-stage renal disease, kidney\ndisease, obesity, physical activity, smoking, alcohol\nEnd-stage kidney disease has a considerable human and\nsocial cost. Annual costs for medical care exceed $50,000\nper person, and the 5-year survival is less than 50%.1 There\nare few well-established risk factors for end-stage kidney\ndisease. Diabetes and hypertension are strong predictors for\nthe development and progression of chronic kidney diseases.2-4\nExperimental studies5 have pointed to strong similarities be-\ntween the process of systemic atherosclerosis and glomerulo-\nsclerosis (a common histologic end-point for chronic kidney\ndiseases), suggesting analogous biologic mechanisms. We do\nnot know whether glomerulosclerosis is caused by the intrarenal\nvascular disease associated with atherosclerosis, or whether it\nresults from shared risk factors. However, it seems likely that the\nunderlying risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as obesity,\nphysical inactivity, smoking and alcohol consumption, might\nalso predict the risk of chronic kidney disease.\nResearch on this question is sparse and inconclusive.\nPhysical activity has been associated with a lower rate of\nnephropathy6 and renal dysfunction7 in diabetic patients, but\nits relation to the risk of chronic kidney disease in the general\npopulation is unknown. Smoking is a well-established risk\nfactor for renal damage in diabetic patients,8,9 but its role in\nother types of kidney disease is still debated.10-14 Alcohol\ndrinking has been associated with an increased risk of end-stage\nrenal disease in the U.S. population.15 The association of obesity\n(a major cause of hypertension) with abnormal kidney func-\nFrom the *Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale, Unit\u00e9\n170, Villejuif, France; Department of Epidemiology and Department\nof Health Policy and Management, The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg\nSchool of Public Health, and \u00a7Department of Medicine, The Johns\nHopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD; and the \u00b6Office of Analysis,\nEpidemiology and Health Promotion, National Center for Health Statistics,\nCenters for Disease Control, Hyattsville, MD.\nCenter for Health Statistics, Hyattsville.

One was\nNHANES II, a cross-sectional survey conducted between\ntritional and health data in a probability sample of the U.S.\ncivilian, noninstitutionalized population aged 6 months to 74\nyears.19 Another was the Health Care Financing Administra-\ntion's end-stage renal disease Program Management and\nMedical Information System, also referred to as the Medicare\nend-stage renal disease registry. Finally, we used mortality\ndata from the NHANES II Mortality Study, which ascertained\nyears at the time of their NHANES II examination.20 We\nexcluded 5 of these 9,250 individuals because they had treated\nend-stage kidney disease at baseline, according to the Medicare\nregistry. We restricted the analysis to individuals identified as\nAfrican-American or white, excluding 163 others because their\nchronic kidney disease risk was extremely heterogeneous. These\nexclusions left 9,082 subjects for analysis.\nExposure to Potential Risk Factors\nThe NHANES II survey included a structured inter-\nview, a standardized physical examination and laboratory\ntests. To assess physical activity, participants were asked\nwhether they were getting \"much exercise,\" \"moderate exer-\ncise\" or \"little exercise\" for recreation, and whether, in their\nusual day, aside from recreation, they were \"very active,\"\n\"moderately active\" or \"quite inactive.\" We combined the\nactivity categories in the two questions as follows. Persons\ngetting \"much exercise\" or \"very active\" were classified as\n\"very active\" and used as the reference group; those reporting\n\"little exercise\" or being \"quite inactive\" were classified as\n\"inactive;\" all the others were considered \"moderately ac-\ntive.\" For smoking, participants were asked whether they had\nsmoked at least 100 cigarettes during their entire life, whether\nthey currently smoked, and the daily number of cigarettes\nsmoked. We defined those who answered \"yes\" to the first\ntwo questions as current smokers, and those who responded\n\"yes\" to the first but \"no\" to the second as former smokers.\nThose who had smoked less than 100 cigarettes were cate-\ngorized as nonsmokers. We then classified current smokers\ninto two categories: those who smoked 20 or fewer cigarettes\nper day, and those who smoked more than 20 cigarettes per\nday. A food-frequency questionnaire provided information\nabout the frequency of consumption of beer, wine and liquor.\nParticipants were asked about their usual consumption of\nalcoholic beverages during the 3 months that preceded the\ninterview. Consumption was classified as follows: never,\nseldom (less than once per week), weekly (one to six times\nper week) or daily (one or more times per day). The greatest\nfrequency of reported alcohol consumption of any of the three\ntypes was used to assign an overall category of individual\nalcohol use. Body-mass index (BMI) was calculated from\nheight and weight (kg/m2), and categorized according to the\nWorld Health Organization's classification21 as follows: thin\nmorbidly obese (BMI  35).\nWe also recorded data about known renal risk factors\nthat may be confounders or mediators for the relations we\nwere studying. Seated blood pressure was measured twice\nduring the physical examination, and averaged. Participants\nwere considered hypertensive if they reported being told by a\ndoctor that they had hypertension, or if they had a systolic\nblood pressure 140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure\n90 mmHg. We considered participants to have diagnosed\ndiabetes if they reported ever having been told by a doctor\nthat they had diabetes, and a history of cardiovascular disease\nif they reported ever having had heart failure, a heart attack or\na stroke. We analyzed serum cholesterol according to the\nprotocol described for the Lipid Research Clinics program,22\nand measured serum creatinine with the Jaff\u00e9 reaction.\nOutcomes\nWe studied chronic kidney diseases, which we defined\nby either: (1) treatment of end-stage kidney disease due to\nany cause; or (2) death related to chronic kidney disease.\nTreated cases of end-stage kidney disease were identi-\nfied by obtaining Medicare end-stage renal disease registry\ndata for NHANES II participants. The Medicare registry\npersons in the U.S. who have received renal replacement\ntherapy since that date. Matching was conducted by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics without knowledge of\non the basis of the participant's name (surname, first name,\nmiddle initial), date of birth, sex and race. The matching\nalgorithm required exact or nearly exact matches on name\nand date of birth, except that in some instances, mismatches\non surname were allowed for women. A quality-of-match\nvariable was generated, and initial matches were classified\ninto three categories: definite (exact match in all four fields or\nminor mismatch in one field, eg, different middle initial), prob-\nable (similar but inexact match in two fields, eg, surname spelled\nslightly differently and middle initial missing) and possible (eg,\nnonmatch for surname in women only, or similar but inexact\nmatch in three fields). Only individuals with a definite or a\nprobable match were considered treated cases.\nWe identified chronic kidney-disease-related deaths us-\ning the NHANES II Mortality Study conducted by the Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics.20 Deaths were ascertained\nSocial Security Administration Death Master Files (1976\u00ad\nlinkers were name, date of birth and sex. Matching was\nfurther reviewed manually according to the above criteria as\nwell as race, state of birth, state of residence and marital\nstatus. Death certificates were abstracted to obtain the date, as\nwell as the underlying and contributing causes of death.\nDeaths were classified as related to chronic kidney disease if\nany of the following codes of International Classification of\nDisease 9th Revision23 was listed on the death certificate as\nthe underlying or contributing cause: 250.4 (diabetes mellitus\nsive renal disease), 404 (hypertensive heart and renal dis-\nsis) and 593.9 (renal disease not otherwise specified).\nOutcomes are mutually exclusive, so that patients who\nfirst received renal replacement therapy and then died of renal\ndisease were classified as \"treated end-stage kidney disease.\"\nStatistical Analysis\nWeighted prevalences of baseline characteristics and\nexposures were estimated with Software for Survey Data\nAnalysis (SUDAAN) to account for the complex survey\nsampling. Incidence rates in person-years were calculated\nwith weighted Poisson models in STATA 6.0. We used\nKaplan\u00adMeier survival methods to estimate the overall cu-\nmulative incidence in the cohort,24 and constructed three Cox\nproportional hazards regression models to determine the rel-\native risk of developing chronic kidney disease associated\nwith exposures.25 Model 1 included the four hypothesized\nexposures, ie, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consump-\ntion and BMI adjusted for age, sex and race; Model 2\nincluded all the aforementioned variables, with further ad-\njustment for serum cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and a\nhistory of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease;\nand Model 3 contained the variables from model 2, with\nadjustment for glomerular filtration rate, calculated with the\nprediction equation in Levey et al26 based on age, sex, race\nand serum creatinine. In these models, age, systolic blood\npressure, serum cholesterol and estimated glomerular filtra-\ntion rate were analyzed continuously. With one exception, of\nall the variables used in this analysis, less than 0.5% were\nmissing. The exception was serum creatinine, and conse-\nquently, calculated glomerular filtration rate, which was lack-\ning for 30% of the participants.\nTo assess the robustness of the main results, we con-\nducted several subsidiary analyses. First, to avoid possible\nintermingling of acute and chronic causes of renal failure, we\nconducted an analysis after excluding 23 incident cases with a\ndiagnosis of acute renal failure on their death certificate; in the\nsame way, because of possible misclassification of chronic\nkidney disease on death certificates, we conducted an analysis\nlimited to incident cases that were treated for end-stage kidney\ndisease, using Model 1 because of the small number of events.\nSecond, to enhance the sensitivity of baseline assessment for\ndiabetes, we limited our analyses to a subset of 3,182 subjects\nwho underwent oral glucose-tolerance tests.\nThird, to minimize the possibility of reverse causation\n(ie, the possibility that incipient chronic kidney disease at\nbaseline would have modified exposure to the studied risk\nfactors), we repeated the analyses after excluding subjects\nwith a high serum creatinine at baseline, as defined by a value\n(106 mol/L) in women, and excluding incident cases that\noccurred within 5 years of follow-up. Finally, to enhance the\nclinical specificity of the outcomes, we divided chronic kid-\nney disease into two broad categories: kidney disease due to\ndiabetes or hypertension, and kidney disease due to other or\nunspecified causes.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of the\n9,082 NHANES II participants included in our study. Values\nrepresent U.S. prevalence estimates of lifestyle behaviors and\nIncidence of Chronic Kidney Disease\nby the study, 189 subjects developed chronic kidney disease\n(Table 2). Of these, 44 (23%) entered the Medicare end-stage\nrenal disease program, 23 (12%) had kidney disease listed as\nan underlying cause of death, and 122 (65%) had it listed as\na contributing cause. The overall cumulative incidence by age\n75 was 8.9%. Diabetic and hypertensive nephropathies rep-\nresented 50% of the assigned cases of treated end-stage\nkidney disease, and 26% and 12% of the assigned underlying\nand contributing causes of death, respectively.\nLifestyle Factors and Obesity as Risk Factors\nAfter adjustment for age, sex, race, BMI, alcohol and\nsmoking, the risk of chronic kidney disease was related to\nphysical inactivity (Table 3). Compared with very active\npersons, those who were inactive had more than twice the risk\nof chronic kidney disease (Model 1). Further adjustment for\nEpidemiology \u00b7 Volume 14, Number 4, July 2003 Lifestyle, Obesity and Kidney Diseases\nself-reported diabetes, hypertension, systolic blood pressure,\nserum cholesterol, cardiovascular disease and baseline calcu-\nlated glomerular filtration rate partly altered this association\n(Models 2 and 3). A graded relation was observed with\nsmoking status (Model 1), even after controlling for the other\nvariables (Models 2 and 3). Alcohol consumption was not\nrelated to the risk of chronic kidney disease, with the analysis\nby type of alcohol beverages showing similar patterns for\nbeer, wine and liquor (data not shown).\nThe relation between BMI and the risk of chronic\nkidney disease was not graded, but those with morbid obesity\nhad a risk of chronic kidney disease more than twice that of\nnormal-weight persons, independent of age, sex, race, phys-\nical activity and smoking (Model 1). Adjustment for diabetes,\nhypertension and blood pressure notably weakened this as-\nsociation (Model 2).\nWhen Model 2 was restricted to a subsample of the\n6,341 subjects with a measurement of serum creatinine, the\nresults were similar to those for the entire sample. This\nfinding suggests that differences observed between Models 2\nand 3 cannot be ascribed to differential subject selection.\nAdjustment for socioeconomic status, as defined by income\nand level of education, did not modify the above associations.\nSubsidiary Analyses\nExcluding the 23 incident cases with acute renal failure\ndid not alter the relations with physical inactivity (adjusted\nrelative risk [RR] of inactive persons compared with very\nactive persons in Model 1: 2.4 [95% confidence interval,\nBMI (RR of morbidly obese compared with normal weight\nthe outcome to the 44 incident cases with treated end-stage\nkidney disease, except for the relation with smoking, which\nwas more modest (Model 1: RR of smokers of 1\u00ad20 cigarettes\nAdjustment for biochemically defined diabetes did not mod-\nify the main study results. In particular, among the 3,182\nparticipants who underwent the oral glucose-tolerance test,\nthe RR for inactive persons compared with the RR for those\nwho were very active was very similar, after adjusting for\nneither of subjects with high serum creatinine at baseline, nor\nof incident cases that occurred within the first 5 years of\nfollow-up modified any of the observed associations.\nTo test the hypothesis that the risk factors we studied\nwere more strongly related to diabetic and hypertensive\nnephropathies than to the other types of kidney disease, we\nsplit the cases in two groups. Physical inactivity was more\nstrongly associated with the risk of diabetic or hypertensive\nnephropathy than with that of other types of kidney disease\n(Table 4). BMI and alcohol consumption were similarly\nrelated to both types. The relation to smoking was weaker in\nthose with diabetic or hypertensive nephropathy than in those\nwith other types of kidney disease.\nTable 1.

In contrast,\nwe did not find that alcohol consumption was related to a\nhigher risk of chronic kidney disease.\nThe most important obstacles to studying renal risk\nfactors prospectively are the relatively low incidence and the\nTABLE 3.

The large size of the initial cohort and the 12-to-\n16-year follow-up period produced a large number of cases.\nPrevious prospective studies of renal risk factors con-\nsidered end-stage renal disease as defined by entry into the\nMedicare registry or death from renal disease as the under-\nlying cause.2,3 Here, we also studied the contributing causes\nof death to identify chronic kidney diseases in persons who\nmay have died of another cause before reaching the end-stage\nand requiring renal replacement therapy. The use of multiple-\ncause mortality data has been shown to be particularly useful\nin studying long-term diseases that are not necessarily fatal,\nbut are sufficiently serious to be listed on the death certificate.\nRenal disease is an excellent example of this situation, be-\ncause it appears on U.S. death certificates 5 times more often\nas a contributing cause of death than as an underlying\ncause.28 Consideration of both underlying and contributing\ncauses of death strongly improves the sensitivity of case\nascertainment and, therefore, the study power.\nFew studies have related physical activity to the risk of\nchronic kidney disease. In one study, an association was\nobserved between increased levels of leisure physical activity\nand a reduced occurrence of nephropathy in individuals with\ninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.6 Because of the cross-\nsectional design of that study, however, it was unclear\nwhether that association reflected a protective effect of phys-\nical activity or simply physical limitations due to the disease\nitself. More interestingly, a prospective study of adults with\ndiabetes found leisure physical activity to be negatively\nTABLE 4.

One study found that repeated exercise training\nincreased glomerular filtration rate in mice with reduced renal\nmass.29 We can postulate that physical activity has a protec-\ntive effect against chronic kidney disease from the similar\nmechanisms that have been described for cardiovascular\ndisease. Physical activity protects against cardiovascular dis-\nease by reducing risks of obesity, high blood pressure, ad-\nverse blood lipid profiles and noninsulin-dependent diabetes\nmellitus, but it may also afford protection independent of\nthose factors.30-31 In our study, the relation between physical\nactivity and chronic kidney disease appeared partly mediated\nby diabetes and hypertension.\nCardiovascular diseases and chronic renal failure may,\nhowever, themselves cause low physical activity. The relation\nobserved might thus reflect reduced activity due to the pres-\nence of these conditions at baseline, rather than causality.\nControlling for a history of cardiovascular disease and esti-\nmated glomerular filtration rate, or excluding individuals with\na high serum creatinine at baseline from the analysis, did not\nalter our finding, which suggests that reverse causation is\nunlikely. Our results were not substantially changed when we\nexcluded incident cases that occurred within the first 5 years\nof follow-up (ie, subjects with any condition that might have\nled to reduced physical activity and early death). This also\nindicates that reverse causation is unlikely. Although we\ncontrolled for baseline diabetes and hypertension, the fol-\nlow-up period of 12\u00ad16 years is sufficient for these diseases\nto occur and even progress to chronic kidney disease. The\nfact that low physical activity was more strongly associated\nwith diabetic or hypertensive nephropathy than with other\nrenal diseases is compatible with a possible role of these\ndiseases in the causal pathway.\nThe renal risk from smoking is better documented than\nconsistent with those of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention\nTrial study, in which a similar graded relation was observed\nin a large cohort of men.12 They are also consistent with\nresults from studies conducted in selected populations of\nolder nondiabetic subjects,36 and of patients with diabetic\nnephropathy,9 primary glomerulonephritis13,14 or polycystic\nkidney disease,13 in which smoking was clearly related to the\ndecline in renal function. Nevertheless, one large population-\nbased case-control study failed to find that smoking was\nrelated to end-stage renal disease (from any cause).10\nWhen we restricted the analysis to treated end-stage\nkidney diseases, we no longer observed an association with\nsmoking. Although it is possible that this finding is due to the\nlimited power of this restricted analysis, we cannot rule out\nthe possibility that the apparent relation of smoking with\nchronic kidney disease resulted from its relation with the\nother causes of death. An alternative explanation, however, is\nthat smokers with chronic kidney disease are more likely to\ndie before reaching end-stage renal failure and requiring\nreplacement therapy than are their nonsmoking counterparts,\nie, that smoking would be a risk factor for the severity of the\ndisease through co-morbidities; this explanation would pro-\nduce the same apparent discrepancies among epidemiological\nstudies.\nSeveral studies with different approaches suggest that\nsmoking plays a causal role in renal damage. It has been\nrelated to increased microalbuminuria, proteinuria and serum\ncreatinine, and to decreased glomerular filtration rates in\npatients with diabetes or hypertension,37 as well as in healthy\nindividuals.32,33,36 It has been associated with transient but\nrepeated increases of blood pressure, with renal hemody-\nAlthough the biologic mechanisms involved in smoking-\ninduced renal damage are unknown, the latter may result\nfrom several nonexclusive mechanisms, including direct and\nindirect effects of smoking (and nicotine) on the kidney, as\nreviewed by Orth et al.8\nEpidemiological studies of the relation between alcohol\nconsumption and chronic kidney disease are scarce.15,29 In\nPerneger's large population-based case-control study,15 con-\nsumption of more than two alcoholic drinks per day was\nassociated with a 4-fold increase in the risk of end-stage renal\ndisease, whereas lower intake of alcohol did not appear to be\nharmful. In our study, alcohol consumption did not appear as\na risk factor for chronic kidney disease. However, the small\nnumber of daily drinkers did not permit further stratification\nby number of drinks per day, specifying a subgroup of heavy\ndrinkers.\nAdiposity promotes an adverse profile of cardiovascu-\nlar risk factors, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes,\nreduced high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated fi-\nbrinogen. Most of these factors have also been shown to be\nstrongly related to an increased risk of chronic and end-stage\nrenal failure.2,3,40 In this study, BMI was associated with an\nincreased risk of chronic kidney disease. However, the rela-\ntion appeared to be limited to morbid obesity, and was largely\nmediated by hypertension and diabetes (since adjustment for\nthese conditions strongly weakened the relative risk). Several\nmechanisms have been proposed to relate obesity to hyper-\ntension and glomerulosclerosis, and thus to chronic renal\nfailure.16 These include altered histology and compression of\nthe renal medulla, leading to activation of the renin-angio-\ntensin system, renal vasodilation and increased glomerular\nfiltration rate and hypertension, as well as metabolic abnor-\nmalities (eg, lipids, glucose intolerance), ultimately resulting\nin hypertension and glomerulosclerosis. Thus, there is a\nbiologic basis for the possible role of extreme obesity in the\ndevelopment of chronic kidney disease. This observation is\nalso consistent with the overlapping time trends of obesity42\nand end-stage renal disease incidence1 in the U.S., and the\nEpidemiology \u00b7 Volume 14, Number 4, July 2003 Lifestyle, Obesity and Kidney Diseases\nemergence of obesity-related glomerulopathy observed by\nSeveral limitations deserve comments. First, in our\nmain analyses, we used the same International Classification\nof Disease codes to define chronic kidney diseases as in other\nsimilar cohorts,2,3,12 which permits comparison of results, but\nhas the disadvantage of including a few cases of acute renal\ndisease. Subsidiary analysis excluding these cases, however,\ndid not alter our findings. Second, inaccuracy of renal diag-\nnosis on death certificates43may have also resulted in some\ndegree of misclassification; approximately one third of the\ncases with underlying causes of death, and half of the con-\ntributing causes were assigned to renal failure not specified as\nacute or chronic. Although it is likely that the great majority\nof these cases of renal failure were chronic, we cannot rule\nout the possibility that some of them may have been acute.\nNevertheless, restricting the outcome to treated end-stage\nkidney diseases (none due to acute renal failure) showed very\nsimilar relations to physical inactivity, obesity and alcohol\nconsumption, strongly suggesting that the two groups of\ncases (treated and dead) were comparable as far as their\nassociation with these exposures were concerned. Third, the\nstudy had limited power in subgroup analysis. In particular,\nwe were not able to study potential interactions with sex or\nrace. Finally, most studies encounter difficulty in assessing\nbaseline kidney disease to differentiate risk factors for initi-\nation from those for progression of the disease. We addressed\nthis limitation in two ways. First, prevalent end-stage kidney\ndisease cases were excluded from the main analysis. Second,\na subsidiary analysis was conducted that excluded subjects\nwith hypercreatininemia at baseline, which might be consid-\nered overly conservative and could lead to a lack of power.\nNevertheless, it remains difficult to determine whether a\ngiven risk factor plays a role in the initiation or in the\nprogression of kidney disease.\nOur results have two main implications. First, the\nincrease in the incidence of kidney disease in the U.S.\npopulation44 may be partly explained by the corresponding\nrise in obesity and physical inactivity.42 Second, programs to\npromote physical activity, smoking cessation and weight\nreduction may reduce the growing burden of kidney disease\nin the U.S., as well as contribute to cardiovascular disease\nreduction.\nREFERENCES\n1.
