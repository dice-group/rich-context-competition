The expense of\nmedical care for injured people is estimated to exceed $406 billion annually. Given this burden on the population,\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention consistently refers to injury prevention as a national priority. We\npostulated that exposure to crime and the density of alcohol outlets in one's neighborhood will be positively\nassociated with the incidence of hospitalization for and mortality from traumatic injuries, independent of other\nneighborhood characteristics.\nMethods: We conducted a cross-sectional study with ecological and individual analyses. Patient-level data for traumatic\ninjury, injury severity, and hospital mortality due to traumatic injury in 2010 were gathered from the Dallas-Fort Worth\nHospital Council Foundation. Each case of traumatic injury or death was geospatially linked with neighborhood of\norigin information from the 2010 U.S. Census within Dallas County, Texas. This information was subsequently linked\nwith crime data gathered from 20 local police departments and the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission alcohol\noutlet dataset. The crime data are the Part One crimes reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nResults: The proportion of persons 65 years old or older was the strongest predictor of the incidence of hospitalization\nwas associated with a 5% increase in the odds of hospital mortality among hospitalized trauma patients.\nConclusions: Several neighborhood characteristics were associated with the incidence, severity, and hospital mortality\nfrom traumatic injury. However, crime rates and alcohol outlet density carried no such association. Prevention efforts\nshould focus on neighborhood characteristics such as population density, mean age of the residents, and\nunemployment rate, regardless of crime rates and alcohol outlet density.\n",

Thus, injury\nprevention is a national priority. Across numerous med-\nical disciplines, socioeconomic status (SES) by various\nmeasures has been strongly associated with higher inci-\ndence rates, and severity of disease including cancers and\ncardiovascular diseases (Kucharska-Newton et al. 2011;\nSchwartz et al. 2003), greater operative mortality (Bennett\net al. 2010), and poorer overall survival rates represented\ndisproportionately in lower SES populations (Daly et al.\n2002). Previous research suggest that neighborhood\ncharacteristics, including measures of SES, may reflect\nthe relative availability and access to resources necessary\nfor well-being which can in turn influence outcomes of\nmedical care, particularly, in light of the limited access\nto healthcare in low-income communities (Braveman\nBecause SES is a multidimensional construct (that con-\ntinues to generate definitional debate), it is particularly\nimportant that multiple measurement sources be inves-\ntigated to elucidate the effect of `SES' along with other\nneighborhood characteristics on trauma incidence, injury\nseverity, and hospital mortality. Previously identified predic-\ntors include the following: individual income, employment\nstatus, and education level (individual level) and house-\nhold income, mean or median education level, and pro-\nportion of a population living below a given poverty level\n(neighborhood level) (Galobardes et al. 2006a, b; Daly\net al. 2002). Prior studies characterizing traumatic injury\nwithin social contexts often focus on singular facets of a\ncomplex mosaic of economic and social neighborhood at-\ntributes (Newgard et al. 2011); however, each study has\nits own respective limitations. Specifically, the exclusion\nof one or more important confounding measures may\ndistort the relationship between SES and the phenom-\nena of traumatic injury (Cubbin et al. 2000; Hefernan\ntors shown to be associated with the occurrence and out-\ncomes of traumatic injury must be taken into account.\nAlcohol retail outlet density is one such factor. The\nassociations between alcohol retail outlet density and\npedestrian injury collisions, car crashes and related injur-\nies, and assaults, including intimate partner violence have\nall been well described (LaScala et al. 2001; Treno et al.\nretail outlet density has been found to be associated with\nvarious neighborhood characteristics, including poverty\nand racial demographics (Berke et al. 2010). Each add-\nitional alcohol outlet has been shown to increase crime\nreports to police by 3%. Moreover, alcohol has long\nbeen linked to the commission of crimes (Shupe 1953;\nLadouceur and Temple 1985). Finally, both interpersonal\nand property crimes are associated with the incidence of\ntrauma (Hashima and Finkelhor 1999; Zimring and Zuehl\nClearly, a deeper understanding of the complex interac-\ntions between environmental contexts, individual behavior,\nexposure to crime, and traumatic injury may inform and\nimprove injury prevention initiatives. We conducted an\nepidemiologic investigation that comprehensively examined\nthe relationship between multidimensional indicators of\nSES with a focus on crime rates and alcohol retail density\nin the neighborhood as risk factors for the incidence and\nseverity of, and mortality from, traumatic injury, in Dallas\nCounty, Texas. This study is particularly unique in that\ncontextual measures were geographically linked from larger\ndata sources (e.g., the U.S. Census) via geocoding of trauma\npatient home addresses. We postulated that exposure to\ncrime and the density of alcohol outlets in one's neighbor-\nhood will be positively associated with the incidence of\nhospitalization for and mortality from traumatic injuries,\nindependent of established SES measures such as income,\nemployment status, and education. Therefore, we sought to\nanswer two specific research questions. First, are the crime\nrate and alcohol retail density in a patients' census tract\npositively associated with their odds of hospitalization for\ntraumatic injury? Second, do crime rates and alcohol retail\ndensity positively predict higher levels of injury severity and\nmortality, independent of other neighborhood contextual\nmeasures, patient behavior, and demographic measures?\nThese two research questions are systematically evaluated\nin this study.\nMethods\nData sources\nContextual U.S. Census, crime, and alcohol outlet data\nSES data were obtained from the 2010 United States\nCensus website (U. S. Census Bureau 2012). These data\nincluded population estimates for each census tract\nincluded in this study, age and sex distributions, education\nlevels, proportions of persons living below the federal\npoverty level, median household income, employment\nrates, housing information (such as rates of owner-\noccupied housing), and race/ethnicity information. Crime,\nalcohol retail establishment, and patients' hospitalization\ndata were restricted to the year 2010 to be consistent with\nthe United States Census data.\nData for major crimes were obtained via the Uniform\nCrime Reports (UCR) Part One crimes (Federal Bureau\nof Investigation 2004) which include homicide, forcible\nrape, robbery, assault, burglary (breaking and entering),\nlarceny/theft (including theft from motor vehicles),\nunauthorized use of motor vehicles (theft of the motor\nhttp://www.injepijournal.com/content/1/1/23\nvehicle), and arson. Crime data for 2010, including the\ntype of crime and the address where the crime occurred\nwas provided by 20 of the 26 cities in Dallas County.\nPatients from the six cities that did not provide data to\nthe UCR were excluded from the study. Finally, the Texas\nAlcoholic Beverage Commission provided the addresses of\nalcoholic beverage retail establishments throughout the\narea of interest in this study. This allowed us to compute a\n`density' of alcohol outlets given the estimated population\nsize of each patient's `neighborhood' census tract (alcohol\nretail outlets per census tract/estimated population size\n2010). We included only those alcohol retailers with active\nPatients were included in this study if they lived within\n1 of the 20 police jurisdictions in Dallas County, Texas\nthat provided crime data to the Federal Bureau of Inves-\ntigation's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) (Figure 1). The\npatients' initial hospitalization for traumatic injuries\noccurred during 2010. Any subsequent hospital admis-\nsion for any individual patient was excluded from the\ndataset. Patients were excluded if they were 14 years\nold or younger or hospitalized for burns as the primary\ndiagnosis, as these groups have their own injury and\nmortality prediction models.\nPatients: individual-level data\nPatient-level data were collected directly from the Dallas-\nFort Worth Hospital Council Foundation (DFWHCF),\nan organization that stores data from more than 90% of\nall hospital discharges across the North Texas region.\nAfter receiving institutional review board approval, we\nobtained patient-level data for each discharge, including\nself-reported patient demographics, home address, type\nof insurance, length of stay, International Classification\nof Diseases, Ninth Edition - Clinical Modification (ICD-9)\ncodes for diagnoses, procedures, and external causes of\ninjury and poisoning (E-codes). Comorbid conditions\nwere enumerated using the Elixhauser Comorbidity Score\nOutcomes: trauma-related morbidity and mortality\nThe severity of traumatic injury was measured as the\nprobability of mortality using the Trauma Mortality Pre-\ndiction Model for the ICD-9 lexicon (Glance et al. 2009).\nHospital discharge status identified each patient as either\nalive or deceased.\nStatistical analysis\nGeocoding and data linkage\nThe addresses of patients hospitalized for traumatic in-\njury were linked to crime rates and alcohol retail densities\nin their respective census tracts using ArcGIS version 10.1\n(ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA) and the user-written Geocode\nroutine for Stata 12 (StataCorp., College Station, TX, USA).\nThe geocoding process was a point-in-polygon method\nusing TIGER/Line shapefiles provided online by the U. S.\nCensus Bureau (2012). All crime rates and alcohol retail\ncensus tract.\nMulti-level predictors of injury severity and hospital\nmortality were assessed using hierarchical regression\nmethods in Stata 12 (StataCorp., College Station, TX,\nUSA). Predictor variables were excluded from multi-\nvariate analysis if they were not related to the outcome\nin any bivariate analyses, unless they were theoretically\nrelated to our research questions (e.g., represented crime\nrates or alcohol outlet density), or were identified as\nparticularly relevant predictors of traumatic injury in\nthe literature reviewed above.\nMulti-level regression analyses\nPatient-level hospital mortality was analyzed using a\nhierarchical logit model (Moore et al. 2010) which\ncorrected for random effects at both the hospital and\ncensus tract levels.

The variation in trauma/\nstandardized incidence ratios (SIR), and for clarity, these\nresults are presented as tables and geographically below\n(Figures 2 and 3). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to\nensure that the six jurisdictions excluded from this study\n(because crime data were not available) did not differ from\nthose included in the analysis on any relevant outcome or\npredictor variable.\nResults\nAccording to the 2010 U.S. Census, the population of\nsquare miles. The geographic boundary of this study\nencompassed 510 contiguous census tracts covering\n89% of the total land area in Dallas County. Due to\nmissing crime data by jurisdiction, the total population\nsented 97.1% of the county population. Using data from\nthe DFWHCF, 6,032 trauma patients met our selection\ncriteria for inclusion. The descriptive characteristics of\nthe sample, census tracts, and all independent and\ndependent variables at the individual and census tract\nrepresenting 1,040 separate ICD-9 codes, diagnosed in\nour cohort of 6,032 patients. A breakdown of these ICD-9\ncodes is provided in Tables 2, 3, and 4.\nFirst, we expected that crime rates and alcohol outlet\ndensity, independent of SES, patient behavior, and demo-\nhttp://www.injepijournal.com/content/1/1/23\ngraphics, would be associated with the incidence of\ntraumatic injuries sufficient to warrant hospitalization.\nThe mean incidence of hospitalization for trauma was\nhousing, followed by the proportion of residents aged\n65 years and older, were closely associated with traumatic\ninjury (Table 5). Further, a greater proportion of tract\nresidents younger than 18 was associated with a lower\nincidence of traumatic injury. A greater proportion of\nwhites and blacks (compared to `other races' and His-\npanics/Latinos) living in the neighborhood was also\nassociated with increased trauma rates, as the proportion\nof white and black residents was positively associated with\ntraumatic injury. Population density (persons per square\nmile) was modestly protective from trauma, and neither\nthe crime rate nor alcohol outlet densities were significant\npredictors of the incidence of hospitalization for treatment\nof traumatic injuries (Table 5).\nNext, we examined whether neighborhood characteris-\ntics, beyond traditional SES measures, would predict the\nseverity of traumatic injury and hospital mortality as a\nresult of traumatic injury (in particular, the crime rate and\ndensity of alcohol retail outlets). We found that neither\nthe rate of Part One crimes nor the density of alcohol\nretail outlets were associated with greater injury severity\nGeocoding\nPatient, Crime and Alcohol Retail Addresses\nto Longitude and Latitude Coordinates\nGeographic Coordinates\nNeighborhood-Level\nAnalysis:\nThe Effect of Neighborhood\nContext on the Incidence of\nHospitalization for\nTraumatic Injury\nHeirarchical Analyses:\nIndividual- and Neighborhood-Level Predictors\nof Patient-Level Severity of Traumatic Injury\nIndividual- and Neighborhood-Level Predictors\nof Hospital Mortality Among 6,027 Trauma\nPatients from Dallas County, Texas\nPatient Data From The Dallas/Ft Worth Hospital Council\nInclude:\nPart One Crime\nDepartments in\nDallas County\nAlcohol Retail\nData From The Texas\nAlcoholic Beverage\nCommission\nCensus\nTract-Level\nPatient\nData\nPart One\nCrime\nData\nAlcohol Retail\nData\nIndividual-Level\nPatient\nData\nCensus\nData\nExclude:\nYounger than 15 years old\nAdmitted to a Rehab Hospital\nPrimary Diagnosis of Burns\nIsolated Hip Fracture\nSubsequent Hospital Admissions\nFigure 1 Process of acquiring, matching, and analyzing data.\nhttp://www.injepijournal.com/content/1/1/23\n(Table 6). Individual characteristics, specifically, the number\nof medical comorbidities (Elixhauser Comorbidity Score),\nalcohol intoxication at hospital presentation, penetrating\ninjury, and male sex were all positively associated with the\nseverity of the traumatic injury. Black race, however, was\nassociated with less severe injury than other races.\nWith respect to mortality from traumatic injuries,\nthe unemployment rate was the only contextual SES\npredictor associated with mortality due to traumatic\ninjury. Neither the crime rate nor the alcohol outlet\ndensity of the neighborhood was associated with traumatic\nmortality among citizens of Dallas County (Table 7). At\nthe patient level, penetrating mechanism of injury was\nassociated with two times the odds of mortality com-\npared to other mechanisms of injury. Finally, more\nsevere injuries were associated with greater mortality,\nand age was associated with a 4% increase in mortality\ndue to trauma.\nDiscussion\nWe found that several well-established neighborhood-\nlevel SES measures were significantly associated with\ninjury that required hospital admission and treatment.\nHowever, as expected, these predictors were less robust\nthan individual-level characteristics of the patient. Further,\nthe indicators of alcohol outlet density and crime rate\nin the neighborhood were not predictors in the present\nanalysis. In summary, we found that other neighborhood-\nlevel SES predictors of traumatic injury included a lower\npopulation density, lower proportion of owner-occupied\nhousing (e.g., more rental properties in a given neighbor-\nhood), the proportion of the tract population 18 years old\nor younger, as well as the percentage 65 years and older.\nInterestingly, both the neighborhood proportions of\nwhites and black/African Americans exhibited a modest\nbut significant increase in the incidence of hospitalization\nto treat traumatic injuries.\nFigure 3 Standardized incidence rates of traumas per 100,000 census tract population, Dallas County.\nFigure 2 Standardized incidence ratios for traumas per 100,000 populations in 510 census tracts, Dallas County.\nhttp://www.injepijournal.com/content/1/1/23\nThe relationship between traumatic injury and neigh-\nborhood characteristics has been studied from various\nperspectives. Zarzur et al. found that neighborhood SES\nwas inversely related to incidence rates of trauma; how-\never, SES was defined only in terms of neighborhood\nincome cut points in one county in Tennessee (Zarzur\net al. 2010). Cubbin and colleagues noted that SES (in\nthis case, income-to-need ratio, education level, occupa-\ntion, race, ethnicity) is a robust predictor of mortality\ndue to traumatic injury; however, the effect depended\nupon the indicator of SES and the cause and severity of\ninjury (Cubbin and Smith 2002). Such factors include risk-\ntaking behavior, comorbid conditions, alcohol intoxication,\nand mechanism of injury. Since these phenomena appear\nto be multifactorial in nature, they should be investigated in\na similar fashion. As we sought to understand how each\nmeasure of SES is independently associated with trauma\nmorbidity and mortality, multiple levels of data (e.g., both\nneighborhood and individual level measures of income and\npoverty) were applied.\nInjury prevention is a matter of increasing significance, as\nthe Institute of Medicine published the report, `Hospital-\nBased Emergency Care: At the Breaking Point' due to the\nincreasing demands of emergency and trauma care and\nthe current capacity limitations in 2007 (Committee on\nthe Future of Emergency Care in the United States Health\nmillion visits were made to hospital emergency depart-\nments... About one-quarter of those visits were due to\nunintentional injuries.' In 2011, the American Association\nfor the Surgery of Trauma Prevention Committee issued a\ncall to action for trauma centers, which recommended\nthat prevention programs target neighborhoods where\nimportant socioeconomic and cultural factors need to\nAlthough the relationship between race and traumatic\ninjury has been well documented, there is limited research\nthat incorporates both individual race of the patient and\nthe racial composition of their home neighborhood. For\ninstance, at the individual level, Cubbin et al. (2000) found\nthat black adults were at 61% age-adjusted greater risk for\nTable 1 Descriptive profile of individual and multi-level\nmeasures included in this analysis\nn (%) Mean (95% CI) or\nmedian (range)+\nOutcomes\nHospitalizations for traumatic\nTrauma patients/census tract - Median, 11; range,\nTrauma Mortality\nPrediction Model p(death)\nIndependent variables: contextual\nCensus measures:\nsocioeconomic indicators\n% of Population less than\n% Estimated living below\npoverty level\n% Unemployed\n(previous 12 months)\nMedian annual household ($) - Median, $46,188; range,\npopulation\nDallas county UCR crime\nIndependent variables:\ndemographic\n-\nPopulation density\n(population/square mile)\nIndependent variables:\nindividual level\nDemographic\nRace/ethnicity\nMechanism of injury/\nhospital records\nTable 1 Descriptive profile of individual and multi-level\nmeasures included in this analysis (Continued)\nElixhauser Comorbidity\nScore\n- Median, 2; range,\nAlcohol intoxication\nat hospital\nLength of hospital\nstay (days)\n+, means are presented unless otherwise specified.\nhttp://www.injepijournal.com/content/1/1/23\ntraumatic injury compared to whites using the National\nHealth Interview Survey data. Newgard and colleagues\nconducted an ecological study of emergency medical\nsystem (EMS) data from nine cities across the USA and\nCanada. This study reported a positive association between\nthe rate of major traumatic injuries and the percentage\nof the non-white population (Newgard et al. 2011). Our\nresults were concordant with the literature on race and\ntraumatic injury, as we found a positive relationship\nbetween racial composition at the neighborhood level\n(e.g., proportion of black and white), and traumatic injury\nin general. However, we did find that blacks and whites\n(compared with Hispanic/Latinos and other racial groups)\nwere more likely to have injuries of greater severity. These\nstudies were substantively different from the present\ninvestigation, as each study evaluated one level of data\nonly, and Cubbin and colleagues assessed mortality only,\nwith risk factors assessed only at the individual level.\nThe role of ethnicity at the individual and neighborhood\nlevel provides an interesting albeit complex and multi-\ndimensional research question as it relates to traumatic\ninjury and neighborhood context. Hispanics have rates\nof violence and crime that are closely approaching and\nsurpassing those of blacks, and they are likely to live in\nareas that are characterized by social disorder, poor living\nconditions, and poverty (Gonzalez-Barrera and Lopez 2013;\nReingle et al. 2012). Therefore, given the potential for\ntraumatic injury due to violence and crime-related activity,\nwe were surprised that Hispanic ethnicity was not identi-\nfied as a risk factor for injury, injury severity, or mortality.\nWe can only postulate that this may be a function of a\nlower likelihood of treatment seeking or measurement\nerror (for instance, those of `Hispanic/Latino' descent may\nbe less likely to self-report this as a personal identity).\nHowever, elucidating the phenomena underlying this find-\ning is beyond the scope of this study.\nOur results regarding alcohol outlet density and trauma\ndiffer from the extant literature, and we expect that\nmethodological differences may explain much of this vari-\nability. For instance, Mair et al. investigated the association\npatients hospitalized for traumatic injuries in Dallas\nInjuries Number Percent\nLumbar spine fracture/dislocation +/- spinal\ncord injuries\nCervical spine fracture/dislocation +/- spinal\ncord injuries\nThoracic spine fracture/dislocation +/- spinal\ncord injuries\nEsophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum\ninjuries\nTable 3 OLS regression model predicting hospitalization\nfor traumatic injury: The effect of neighborhood context\nContextual measures\npopulation\nPopulation density\n(population/square mile)\nhttp://www.injepijournal.com/content/1/1/23\nbetween alcohol retail density, specifically bars, and assault-\nrelated injury hospitalizations. Mair observed a positive\nrelationship between the number of alcohol outlets and\ninjury due to assault; however, this effect varied according\nto the demographic characteristics of the neighborhood\n(Mair et al. 2012). In addition, studies of alcohol policy\nhave found that reducing alcohol availability by reducing\nthe number of alcohol outlets in a community or the\nhours and days of sale resulted in lower rates of injury\nthat this differential finding is a function of our inclusion\nof both on- and off-premise alcohol retail outlets as this\ndistinction has been shown to have unique effects on\noutcome (Campbell et al. 2009). Further, alcohol retail\noutlets are more densely located in lower socioeconomic\nlocations (Berke et al. 2010). Although not the primary\nfocus of this paper, we believe that the intrinsic correlation\nbetween alcohol outlets and neighborhood SES will\naccount for the lack of observed independent effect of\nalcohol outlets on traumatic injury.\nMortality from traumatic injury has long been the\nfocus of research to identify risk and protective fac-\ntors that are amendable to intervention in the hos-\npital setting. Typically, this research models the risk\nof highly specific types of injuries, injury patterns, or\nthe benefits of various treatments. However, researchers\nhave recently begun to expand the scope of their\nresearch beyond the hospital walls to investigate how\nfeatures of the geographic and social environment con-\ntribute to traumatic injury mortality (Alkhoury et al.\ninclusion of administrative, diagnostic, trauma registry\ndata has tremendous potential to identify the cases of\ninjury and mortality where self-reported information\nand arrest data do not suffice.\nOur study has several limitations. First, we limited\nour geographic scope to include the census tracts\nwith crime rate data (excluding six police jurisdictions\nthat did not provide such data). While this allowed\ninclusion of 89% of the land area and 97.1% of the\ncounty population, limited selection bias was observed\n(see Tables 2, 3, and 4). Other limitations of this\nstudy include the administrative nature of the hospital\ndischarge data. Although 64.2% of the patients in this\nstudy were treated at verified trauma centers, where\nregistrars carefully document pertinent injury and\nclinical data, no clinical or administrative database is\nentirely free of error. Next, our analyses treat the pa-\ntient as if all received comparable levels of exposure\nto the neighborhood characteristics (at the census\ntract level) examined, and the duration of each\npatient's exposure to their respective environments\ncannot be measured with these data. Moreover, all\ntraumatic injuries were given equal weight with re-\ngard to association with the predictors though differ-\nences in association may exist among subgroups of\ninjuries and predictors. Finally, all of the UCR index\ncrimes were aggregated to define a tract's `crime rate,'\nas we did not have a specific hypothesis as to which\ntypes of crime might be most closely related to trau-\nmatic injury.\nIn light of these limitations, the major strength of this\npaper is the broad, epidemiologic perspective it provides.\nTable 5 Hierarchical logistic regression analysis\npredicting mortality among 6,027 trauma patients from\nDallas County, Texas\nContextual measures\nPatient-level measures\nThis model estimates random effects at the hospital and census tract level.\nArea under the ROC curve = 0.89, indicating a high sensitivity of the model.\nalogit transformation of TMPM p(death).\nTable 4 Hierarchical OLS regression model of individual-\nand neighborhood-level predictors of injury severity\nContextual measures\npopulation\nPatient-level measures\nElixhauser Comorbidity\nScore\nAlcohol intoxication\nat hospital\nPenetrating mechanism\nof injury\nhttp://www.injepijournal.com/content/1/1/23\nDespite the large number of studies that have been done\nin this field, this study is one of the most comprehensive,\ninvestigatory, epidemiological studies to date to establish\nthe correlates at both the neighborhood and individual level\nusing hospital data, census information, police records,\nand alcoholic beverage licensing datasets. Further, we were\nable to establish direct associations between multi-level\nmeasures and `injury' in general. This is important epide-\nmiologically in terms of prevention; communities with\nhigh crime rates or diverse racial compositions may be\nidentified as ideal locations for primary prevention.\nConclusions\nAlthough individual-level measures were more\nrobust predictors of traumatic injury and mortality,\nneighborhood-level crime and context plays a role\nin the incidence of traumatic injury requiring\nhospitalization. Further research is needed to assess\nwhich injury prevention efforts may yield the greatest\nbenefit in reducing rates of traumatic injury and\nmortality, as even small effects at the neighborhood\nlevel may have vast effects on the targeted popula-\ntion as a whole.\nTable 6 T test or x2 comparison of patients included (versus those excluded) and census tracts in Dallas County\nIncluded\nN (%) or mean (95% CI)\nExcluded\nN (%) or mean (95% CI)\np value\nDemographic information\nHealthcare/event data\nhttp://www.injepijournal.com/content/1/1/23\nAbbreviations\n95% CI: 95% confidence interval; DFWHCF: Dallas-Fort Worth Hospital\nCouncil Foundation; ICD-9: International Classification of Diseases, Ninth\nEdition - Clinical Modification; ROC: receiver operator characteristic;\nSES: socioeconomic status; UCR: Uniform Crime Report.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nAC made substantial contributions to the study design, acquisition of the\ndata, computer modeling and statistical analysis, interpretation of the results,\nand manuscript development.
