    "abstract": "Abstract\nOn August 9, 1974, Richard M. Nixon formally resigned the presidency; however, folklore hints Nixon informally\nquit fulfilling his duties well before then. As Watergate became less \"a third rate burglary\" than \"high crimes and\nmisdemeanors,\" rumors of President Nixon's wallowing, wandering, drinking, and mumbling swirled. Yet evidence\nfor such assertions has been thin, and prevailing scholarship offers compelling reasons to believe Nixon's institutional\nprotocols overrode his individual proclivities. This study offers a new, systematic look at Nixon's presidency by coding his\npublic events and private interactions with top government officials during every day of his presidency. Contrary to our\nexpectations, the results corroborate the rumors: Richard Nixon effectively quit being president well before he resigned\nthe presidency. In fact, it turns out there was a defining moment when Nixon disengaged from his administration: on\nDecember 6, 1973, the day Gerald Ford was confirmed as Vice President.\n",

In the scholarly parlance, then, \"presi-\ndency-centered\" theories of presidential behavior have\nlargely supplanted \"president-centered\" ones.\nOne lingering question, however, is whether presidents'\npersonal preferences matter more inside the West Wing.\nFor internal operations are not only a domain where presi-\ndents' discretion is relatively broad, but it is also one where\nsystematic evidence is relatively thin.\nOn one hand, there is good reason to believe the institu-\ntional presidency disciplines individual presidents. Careful\nresearch has shown consistency in the White House's inter-\nnal organization, at least since Richard Nixon ran things\n2005). It was Richard Nixon who insisted issues and advi-\nsors reach the president per a rigid protocol, following a\nclear chain-of-command, led by the president, managed by\na Chief of Staff, channeled through a cadre of advisors, and\ninformed by a vast array of domain-specific experts (see\nconclude Mr Nixon forged \"the standard model\" for organ-\nizing the modern presidency--a \"model\" that has endured\nyear-to-year, president-to-president--which buttresses\nWilliam Howell and Terry Moe's recent appraisal: \"All\npresidents share basically the same wiring, and they can be\ncounted upon to behave in the same basic ways\" (2016, xvi).\nOn the other hand, organization is not operation, and the\nlatter is the place where presidents' individual preferences\nshould matter most. President Nixon's case, in fact, exem-\nplifies the point; there have long been rumors that Nixon's\n\"system\" was not as robust as it seemed. Tantalizing tales\nof Nixon's wallowing, wandering, drinking, and mumbling\nduring Watergate hint that the scandal not only broke \"the\nman,\" but also \"the model\" he created.

To our surprise, the results corroborate the\nrumors: Richard Nixon abandoned his model and, in fact,\neffectively quit doing the job well before he resigned the\npresidency. In particular, we discover there was a specific\nday when Nixon effectively disengaged from his adminis-\ntration: December 6, 1973, the day Gerald Ford was sworn\nin as Vice President.\nMeasuring the president's work\nBecause demands on the president's time vastly outpace\nits supply, \"face time\" with the president is among the\ncapital's most precious resources. This was especially true\nduring Richard Nixon's years. \"Paradoxically,\" Henry\nKissinger wrote, \"Nixon's abhorrence of face-to-face\nmeetings enabled his administration to deal with one of\nthe most important challenges of modern government: to\nhusband the President's time--his most precious com-\nmodity--so as to give him the opportunity for reflection\"\nAs Kissinger's reflections indicate, Nixon's personal\ncontacts with government officials constitute a particularly\ngood indicator of his work habits (as opposed to, say, his\nsocial calendar). Fortunately, the Presidential Daily Diary\nincludes a comprehensive log of those interactions. Here is\nthe Richard Nixon Presidential Library & Museum's hold-\ning description:\nThe Daily Diary of files represents a consolidated record of\nthe President's activities. The Daily Diary chronicles the\nactivities of the President, from the time he left the private\nresidence until he retired for the day, including personal and\nprivate meetings, events, social and speaking engagements,\ntrips, telephone calls, meals, routine tasks, and recreational\npursuits. For any given meeting, telephone call, or event, the\nDaily Diary usually lists the time, location, persons involved\n(or a reference to an appendix listing individuals present),\nand type of event.1\nTo extract the relevant details from these extraordinary\nrecords, we first distributed the Nixon Library's Daily\nDiaries collection among a large team of undergraduate stu-\ndents, with each getting a random selection.2 The RA\nassigned a particular day would then scour the correspond-\ning Diary to tally the President's 5-plus-minute contacts--\nface-to-face or by phone--with the following top\ngovernment officials: Chief of Staff; National Security\nAdvisor; White House Counsel; White House Press\nSecretary; Treasury Secretary; Defense Secretary; Secretary\nof State; Speaker of the House; House Minority Leader;\nSenate Majority Leader; Senate Minority Leader. The\nresult, then, was original data indicating Richard Nixon's\nfive-plus-minute contacts with 11 key government officials\nduring each day of his presidency.\nFirst term consistency\nFor an opening glimpse into Nixon's work habits, Figure 1\nshows the President's quarterly contacts with the key offi-\ncials noted above. By way of interpretation, it is useful to\ndistinguish various time intervals, starting with Nixon's\nfirst term, before Watergate became \"Watergate.\"\nThe initial finding is an important one: Nixon was\nscarcely \"alone in the White House\" during his first term.\nThe eleven leading officials studied here (collectively)\naveraged more than 65 personal contacts per week with\nPresident Nixon throughout his first four years in office.\nAnd while closer inspection shows his contacts varied offi-\ncial-to-official and day-to-day, the overall consistency\nthroughout the President's first 16 quarters is remarkable:\nRichard Nixon's inaugural term was characterized by fre-\nquent, consistent personal contact with a myriad of top gov-\nernment officials--from the White House, the Cabinet,\nand, to a lesser degree, Capitol Hill.3 Such patterns\nFigure 1.

Focusing on the same\n11 key government officers, we find Nixon's personal\ninteractions fell from 65 contacts per week during his first\nthan 10 contacts per week into 1974. Put differently, during\nhis final eight months in the White House, the President's\nweekly meetings with top officials were just 15% as fre-\nquent as they had been throughout his first term.4\nTo interrogate these results in greater detail, let us home\nin on President Nixon's closest advisors during the critical\nperiod--starting with the Watergate break-in and ending\nwith the President's resignation. Figure 2 displays President\nNixon's five-plus-minute contacts, either face-to-face or\nover-the-phone, with his Chief of Staff (H.R. Haldeman\nNational Security Advisor (Henry Kissinger, who also\nPress Secretary (Ron Ziegler) for each week after the\nWatergate break-in. We include these officials partly\nbecause they occupy important posts, but also because\nNixon cites them as his closest advisors even in his darkest\ntimeline of Watergate's significant moments.\nSeveral patterns stand out. First, despite the Watergate\nburglars' arrest, indictment, and conviction (June 1972 to\nApril 1973), we find Nixon's interactions with Haldeman,\nKissinger, and Ziegler held steady into the spring of 1973.\nThis continuity persisted even as the trial's presiding judge,\nJohn Sirica, openly (and effectively) pressured the Watergate\ndefendants to disclose their ties to the Nixon campaign and/\nor administration. Indeed, Figure 2 reveals no evidence that\nthe burgeoning crisis had much of an impact on President\nNixon's work habits vis-\u00e0-vis his closest advisors at first.\nSecond, Nixon's steady work habits held through the\nsummer and fall of 1973. This persistence is striking when\none considers just how perilous 1973 was for Nixon: in\nApril, White House counsel John Dean began cooperating\nwith federal officials; in May, Dean gave nationally-tele-\nvised testimony before the Senate Watergate Committee; in\nJuly, Alexander Butterfield revealed Nixon had a secret\nrecording system; in October, reporters decried Nixon's fir-\ning of the special prosecutor over Justice Department offi-\ncials'objections (the so-called \"Saturday Night Massacre\");\nin November, White House attorneys informed Judge Sirica\nthat an 18\u00bd-minute section of a subpoenaed tape had been\ninexplicably erased. And yet, battered by these devastating\ndevelopments (and dismal poll numbers), President Nixon\nnonetheless continued to meet consistently with his Chief\nof Staff, National Security Advisor, and Press Secretary.\nOne year into his second term, then, President Nixon's\ncore internal deliberations had largely proven impervious\nto Watergate revelations. Though less voluminous than dur-\ning his first term, Nixon's second-term contacts with key\ngovernment officials remained frequent and consistent.\nEven when H. R. Haldeman (and John Erlichman)\nresigned--a loss Nixon compared to \"cutting off my\narms\"--the President transitioned seamlessly to working\nwith his new Chief of Staff, Al Haig. Returning to Figure 2\ndemonstrates how President Nixon's meetings with his\nChief of Staff continued unabated after Haldeman's tenure\nended and Haig's began (before and after timeline point 4).\nFigure 2.

Here are Nixon and Haig's\naverage weekly contacts during the summer and fall of\n(October); 26 (November). Then comes December, when\ncontacts between Nixon and Haig fall to just five contacts\nper week. They never rebounded. In fact, Richard Nixon\naveraged just two contacts per week with his Chief of Staff\nthrough his presidency's final eight months. The same pat-\ntern held for Kissinger and Ziegler.\nDrilling deeper, and to our surprise, we detected a spe-\ncific day on which Richard Nixon effectively disengaged\nfrom his administration: December 6, 1973, the day Gerald\nFord was sworn in as Vice President.5 Figure 3 displays\nPresident Nixon's total weekly contacts with the aforemen-\ntioned 11 key officials before and after Jerry Ford's confir-\nmation. In the 12 weeks before that date, Nixon averaged 8\n(standard deviation = 5) contacts per day with top officials;\nin the 12 weeks after that date, he averaged 1 (standard\ndeviation = 1).6 This does not mean it was Ford's ascension\nper se that devastated Nixon; rather, we suspect Ford's con-\nfirmation was merely the last straw--the point when Nixon\nrealized his hopes for surviving Watergate were dashed.\nWhile Nixon's memoirs only briefly address Gerald\nFord's confirmation, details from Nixon's closest advisors\nhelp explain why this was such a blow to Nixon. In the\nspring of 1973, President Nixon still believed he could and\nwould avoid impeachment and retain power. To help ensure\nas much, Nixon decided Gerald Ford would make an\nacceptable Vice President not only because lawmakers\nwould confirm him, but also because he believed those\nsame lawmakers would be reticent to give Ford the presi-\ndency. According to Henry Kissinger, Nixon felt Ford's\n\"selection would dampen desires to impeach him because\nthe Congress would not want to run the risk of placing a\nsupposedly inexperienced man in charge of foreign affairs\"\nNixon presumed House members, knowing Ford as well as\nthey did, would never impeach Nixon and make Ford\nPresident had been even more blunt: Charles Colson\nreported that Nixon described Ford as an \"insurance pol-\nIt thus appears, as historian Stephen Ambrose eluci-\ndates, that \"[Nixon] did not select Ford in order to make it\neasier for the Democrats to impeach him. Nor did he expect\nthat Gerald Ford's ascension sealed Richard Nixon's\ndemise, as the next day's New York Times' front-page story\nindicated: \"But the drama of the day was heightened by the\nrealization of those present that with Mr Ford installed as\nVice President, sentiment for impeachment of Mr Nixon--\nor pressure on him to resign--would intensify\" (Hunter,\n1973). Clearly, Nixon felt that \"pressure.\"\nMaintaining impressions\nOne question left open is whether Nixon sought to main-\ntain a good public face. That is, did the President depict a\nsteady outward appearance, or did his public schedule\nmatch his private one--declining before collapsing alto-\ngether? To compare President Nixon's \"on stage\" work\nhabits to his \"behind-the-scenes\" ones, we drew on Gerhard\nPeters and John T. Woolley's invaluable American\nPresidency Project (2016), which consolidates \"The Public\nPapers of the Presidents\" by date and document type.\nPulling from this database, we tallied all of President\nNixon's public events during each day of his presidency.7\nFigure 4 plots President Nixon's public events by quar-\nter. Across this timespan, President Nixon averaged a pub-\nlic event every other day, although the distribution of such\nactivities was highly variable. Most days included no pub-\nrate public statements, his maximum. Nixon's public\nactivities were more frequent during his first two years in\nsettling at an average of two or three events per week for\nthe years that followed.\nThe differences between Nixon's private and public\nactivities are clear. Whereas Nixon's private contacts with\ntop officials declined in the second term and then fell off a\ncliff starting in December 1973, his public schedule\nFigure 3. President Nixon's total weekly contacts with key\nofficials pre/post Gerald Ford Vice Presidency.\nDependent Variable: The total number of 5+ minute contacts, in person\nor over-the-phone, between President Nixon and select officials in the\n20 weeks before and after Gerald Ford was sworn in as Vice President.\nThe \"key officials\" include the following: Chief of Staff; National Security\nAdvisor; White House Press Secretary; Treasury Secretary; Defense\nSecretary; Secretary of State; Attorney General; Speaker of the House;\nHouse Minority Leader; Senate Majority Leader; Senate Minority Leader.\nBeckmann 5\nremained relatively consistent during his final year in\noffice. Even his last quarter's public schedule was busier\nthan it appears because the count gets cut short by his res-\nignation. In fact, Nixon's average number of public events\nper day was greater in his last quarter (1974, quarter 3) than\nThis pattern holds throughout the Watergate crisis.\nFigure 5 displays President Nixon's public events by week,\nstarting with the break-in and ending with his resignation.\nEven at this greater resolution, we see President Nixon's\npublic activities continued largely uninterrupted as\nWatergate drew closer and more dire (the correlation\nbetween weeks in office and public events during his sec-\nond term is .07).8 Just looking at his public activities, then,\none would find little evidence of Nixon's diminished work-\nload.9 Indeed, we find President Nixon's \"on stage\" activi-\nties proved far more durable than his \"behind-the-scenes\"\nmeetings.\nDiscussion\nAs political scientists have eschewed \"president-centered\"\ntheories for \"presidency-centered\" ones, Richard Nixon's\nexperience presents an intriguing case. While Mr Nixon's\npersonality was once cited as integral to understanding his\npresidency, recent research emphasizes Nixon's role in\nforging the institutional presidency. That President Nixon\nembodied this intrinsic tension--\"man\" versus \"model\"--\ninspired us to test whether Nixon's work routines were as\nrobust as his model or as brittle as its creator.\nTo that end, we drew on an extraordinary archival\nresource--the Presidential Daily Diary--to discover that\nNixon's \"system\" did seem to discipline his deliberations\nthrough his first term, and even into his second. However,\nwe also found strong evidence that Nixon \"the man\" ulti-\nmately discarded his \"model,\" operating more or less in\nisolation during his last eight months in office. Perhaps\nmost striking of all was how abruptly this change occurred,\nupending White House deliberations in a single moment:\nthe day Gerald Ford was sworn in as Vice President.\nA follow-up investigation of President Nixon's public\nactivities--his public addresses, remarks, and news confer-\nences--evidenced no comparable decline. Even as his work\nbehind-the-scenes fell to one-seventh of the level it had\nbeen during his first term, President Nixon continued to\nhold public events, even into the waning days of his\nbesieged presidency. We thus find Richard Nixon main-\ntained the fa\u00e7ade of working long after he quit doing the\nwork itself.\nMore valuable than clarifying the historical record on\nRichard Nixon, his model, or his legacy are the broader\nimplications for understanding the modern presidency. The\nfirst is a greater awareness concerns presidency research\nand evidence. To date, most empirical data on presidents'\nFigure 4.

There are many reasons for\nthis external focus--not the least of which is presidents\npurposefully conceal their inner-workings--and much has\nbeen learned about the nature of presidential influence with\nothers, especially its limits. Nonetheless, Nixon's experi-\nence reminds us that the place where \"president-centered\"\nfactors are likely to matter most is the very place the schol-\narly literature and empirical record is thinnest: presidents'\nwork behind-the-scenes, inside the White House.\nThat leads to a second noteworthy lesson emerging from\nthis study: \"presidency-centered\" models of presidential\nbehavior presume presidents are purposeful, if not fully\nrational. \"Rationality\" is a reasonable assumption in most\ncases, and it has helped presidency scholars identify the\n(considerable) constraints on presidents' discretion and\ninfluence. But as much as we have developed insightful\ntheories to help understand what happens when presidents\nreach for the ceiling, it is important to recall just how little\nwe know about what happens when they fall to the floor--\nbecause they can, as Nixon did.\n"
