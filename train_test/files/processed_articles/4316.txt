Targeted violence at a school\nis defined as any premeditated incident where a known or\nknowable attacker deliberately chooses the school as the\nlocation for the attack (Vossekuil et al., 2002). The findings\nof The Final Report and Findings of the Safe School\nInitiative: Implications for the Prevention of School Attacks\nin the United States (Vossekuil et al., 2002) are the result of\nthe examination of 37 incidents of targeted school violence\nand are discussed at length below. Ten key findings from\nthe study are summarized in Table 1.\nOf the 37 incidents of targeted school violence analyzed in\nthe Vossekuil et al.'s (2002) study, there were some common\ncharacteristics among the incidents. All of the attackers were\nmales, and 95% of them were current students with 5% being\nformer students. Attackers worked alone in 81% of the\nincidents. Assistance from at least one other peer in the\nplanning of the attack occurred in 11% of the incidents, but\nthe attackers in those incidents ultimately carried out the\nattack alone. Two or more attackers committed the assault\ntogether in 8% of the incidents. In terms of weapons, 76% of\nthe attackers used only one weapon, whereas 46% of the\nattackers had more than one weapon with them at the time of\nthe attack. Handguns were used by 61% of the attackers, and\n49% of the attackers used rifles or shotguns. In 73% of the\nincidents, the attacker killed one or more individuals at the\nschool, and in the remaining incidents, at least one person\nwas injured by a weapon. Fifty-nine percent of the incidents\noccurred during the school day, indicating that fewer were\ncarried out before school (22%) or after school (16%).\nTargets were not necessarily random, although persons\nin addition to targets were also harmed. Attackers had\nselected at least one administrator, faculty member, or staff\nmember as a target in 54% of the incidents (Vossekuil et al.,\nand attackers selected more than one target prior to the\nattack in 44% of the incidents. Persons who were targeted\nbefore the attack were actually harmed in the attack in 46%\nof the cases. Individuals not identified as original targets of\nthe attack were also injured or killed, and of these\nindividuals, 57% were students and 39% were\nadministrators, faculty, or staff.\nAccording to Vossekuil et al. (2002), there is no\n\"profile,\" or \"set of demographic and other traits that a set\nof perpetrators of a crime have in common\" for student-\nattackers (p. 11). The use of profiles for identifying\nindividuals who may commit targeted violence has its own\nset of problems as the practice has\na considerable risk of false positives (i.e., most youth who fit\nthe profile are not a targeted violence risk), has a potential for\nbias, and has been sharply criticized for its potential to\nstigmatize students and deprive them of civil liberties. (Reddy\nAn analysis into the various characteristics of attackers\nreveals both similarities and differences among\nperpetrators. Attackers came from a variety of family\nsituations (i.e., intact families to foster homes), and they\ndiffered considerably in social relationships (i.e., socially\nisolated to being popular). At the same time, 71% of the\nattackers felt bullied, threatened, or injured by others before\ncommitting the attack, a significant finding to note if one\nwere to attempt to categorize traits of active shooters. In\naddition, most attackers had some history of suicidal\nideation or attempts, or a history of extreme depression.\nMost attackers were known to have had difficulties coping\nwith \"significant losses or personal failures\" (Vossekuil et\nfailing to excellent grades. Some attackers had no\nbehavioral problems whereas others had histories of\ndisciplinary problems. Although most attackers had no\nhistory of violent or criminal behavior before the attack,\n59% demonstrated some interest in violence whether it was\nthrough video games, movies, books, or other media. Most\nattackers did not display any significant change in academic\nperformance, friendship patterns, interest in school, or\ndisciplinary problems before the attack (Vossekuil et al.,\n93% of the attackers engaged in some behavior before the\nattack that made others (e.g., parents, school officials,\nBonanno and Levenson 3\nteachers, fellow students) concerned about their behavior.\nTargets did not seem to know about the attack beforehand,\nas most attackers did not threaten their targets directly\nbefore the attack.\nVossekuil et al. (2002) found that targeted violence at\nschool is often planned ahead of time with some attackers\ndevising the idea as few as 1 or 2 days before the attack and\nothers holding the idea of the attack for as long as a year\nbefore its execution. Motives for attacks varied, and 54% of\nthe attackers held multiple motives or reasons. For 61% of\nthe attackers studied, revenge was a reason for the attack,\n81% of the attackers had some type of grievance at the time\nof their attack, and 66% of the attackers had told other\npeople about the grievance before the attack. Additional but\nless common motives of attackers were trying to solve a\nproblem (34%), suicide or desperation (27%), and attempts\nfor attention or recognition (24%).\nIn terms of advancing the attack, many attackers had\nexperience using weapons and had access to weapons.\nFifty-nine percent of the attackers had some experience\nwith a gun, and 68% used firearms that they obtained from\ntheir own home or that of a relative. Vossekuil et al. (2002)\nalso noted the involvement of others in that 44% of the\nattackers were influenced by others in deciding to carry out\nthe attack, encouraged or dared by others to commit the\nattack, or both.\nMost school shootings were not stopped by law\nenforcement despite prompt response times. Instead, the\nshooter surrendered to or was apprehended by school staff\n(27% of the incidents) or by students (5% of the incidents).\nThe attacker stopped on his or her own or left the school in\n22% of the attacks, and in 13% of the attacks, the shooter\nkilled himself. Vossekuil et al. (2002) found that law\nenforcement stopped only 27% of the shootings and only\ndischarged weapons in three of the incidents examined.\nMost school shootings were not stopped by law\nenforcement, in part, because of their short duration. Forty-\nseven percent of the incidents lasted 15 min or less from the\nbeginning of the attack to the time when the attacker\nstopped shooting, surrendered, or was apprehended,\nwhereas 27% of the incidents concluded within 5 min.\nDespite these common characteristics among school\nshooters, Lankford (2012) examined the specific subset of\nschool shooters who end their attack by attempting or\ncommitting suicide. Lankford found that a comparison of\nsuicide school shooters, workplace shooters, terrorists, and\nrampage shooters revealed that differences were mostly\nsuperficial. Although school shooters were far younger than\nthe other attackers, all four of these offenders actually\nstruggled with similar personal problems, including social\nmarginalization, personal crises, or issues at home, school, or\nwork. Lankford concluded that law enforcement investigators\nshould not be focused on a particular characteristic but\nshould pay close attention to individuals who are struggling\nwith significant personal issues, and Lankford's hypothesis\nshould be studied further as well as viewed as a possible\nbeginning point for teachers and administrators when\nattempting to identify those who may be at risk of violent\nincidents in schools. Although Lankford highlights the\nsignificant role that serious personal problems play in all of\nthese different types of offenders who attempt suicide,\nultimately, significant psychological problems usually play a\nrole when any individual attempts suicide. The numerous\nsimilarities drawn across these attackers' results tend to\nneglect more specific motives for carrying out violent attacks\nagainst others.\nTheories on Active Shooters in the\nSchools\nSequential Model for Mass Murder at School\nLevin and Madfis (2009) proposed a Five Stage Sequential\nModel to explain what might lead students to commit mass\nmurder at their schools. Each distinct stage is hypothesized\nas a necessary condition, but it is the cumulative strain\nwhere these different factors intersect and build on each\nother that is viewed as leading to a school shooting (Levin\n& Madfis, 2009). The five stages are Chronic Strain,\nUncontrolled Strain, Acute Strain, The Planning Stage, and\nMassacre at School.\nLevin and Madfis's (2009) first stage of Chronic Strain\nstems from Agnew's (1992) general strain theory. Under\nAgnew's theory, strain includes a range of negative\nexperiences or events in social relationships at school,\nhome, work, or in the neighborhood where the individual\nresides. Strain is viewed as a range of difficulties that result\nin anger, frustration, disappointment, depression, fear, and,\neventually, crime.\nWhen strain becomes intense and continues for a\nconsiderable amount of time, it becomes \"Chronic Strain\"\n(Levin & Madfis, 2009). Chronic Strain appears to be a\nmajor factor for school shooters as most felt bullied,\nthreatened, or injured by others, and had a history of\nextreme depression and difficulties coping with significant\nlosses (Vossekuil et al., 2002). School shooters often have\nhad stressful conditions at home or school (Levin & Madfis,\nthat school shooters felt chronic rejection in 13 of the 15\nschool shooting incidents that they analyzed. The Chronic\nStrain at home appears to be reflected in the fact that some\nschool shooters kill their parents or other members of their\nfamily prior to the shooting. Kip Kinkel murdered both of\nhis parents; Luke Woodham beat and stabbed his mother to\ndeath; and, more recently, Adam Lanza shot his mother four\ntimes in the head prior to making his way to Sandy Hook\nKimmel and Mahler (2003) and Newman, Fox, Roth,\nMehta, and Harding (2004) noted that the shooters came\nfrom intact families and argued that quality of family life is\nnot best measured by traditional measures such as family\nstructure or living arrangements.\n4 SAGE Open\nAnother source of strain for school shooters can stem\nfrom interpersonal relationships at school. Agnew (1992)\nidentified the failure to achieve positively valued goals and\nthe disjunction between expectations and actual\nachievements as additional sources of strain. Middle and\nhigh school students often measure their success in life in\nterms of their popularity with peers (Levin & Madfis, 2009)\nand, as Vossekuil et al. (2002) have noted, most school\nshooters felt bullied, threatened, or injured by others.\nKimmel and Mahler (2003) argued that some school\nshooters were attacked about their masculinity through\nhomophobic slurs and that these shooters may have felt that\nthey had already failed in their developing manhood. As a\nresult, it seems likely that Chronic Strain in school shooters\nstems from family conflict and/or problematic relationships\nwith peers at school. Although these conditions create\nChronic Strain, Chronic Strain alone does not lead\nindividuals to become school shooters. Many youngsters\nexperience these forms of Chronic Strain and do not\nbecome attackers, and so other psychologically moderating\nfactors must be in play as well.\nLevin and Madfis's (2009) second stage is Uncontrolled\nStrain during which the strains of everyday life are left\nunchecked by the absence of conventional and/or prosocial\nrelationships. When faced with Chronic Strain, students\nwho cannot find acceptance in school may look for\nacceptance in their family or may find friends outside of\ntheir school. However, some individuals either never make\nmeaningful relationships with others or form relationships\nwith other students who have been marginalized and who\nthen become supportive of and/or encouraging of their\nviolent antisocial feelings and beliefs (Levin & Madfis,\nfound that juveniles who have little attachment to their\nparents or school and/or have relationships with\ntroublesome friends are generally more likely to react to\nstrain by engaging in delinquent behavior. Although\nVossekuil et al. (2002) noted that attackers ranged from\nsocially isolated to popular among their peers, 27% of the\nattackers were part of social groups that were disliked by\nmost mainstream students or were considered to be part of a\n\"fringe group\"; 34% of the attackers were characterized by\nothers as \"loners\" or viewed themselves as loners. In an\nattempt to lessen the effect of the Chronic Strain, a\nyoungster may externalize responsibility for failures that\ncan then increase isolation (Levin & Madfis, 2009).\nLevin and Madfis's (2009) third stage, Acute Strain,\ntakes place when some loss is perceived as catastrophic by\nthe attacker, and it is this loss that serves as a catalyst for\nthe attack. Whereas Chronic Strain is persistent and long\nterm, Acute Strain consists of short-term but especially\nupsetting events that seem catastrophic to an already\ntroubled and isolated individual (Levin & Madfis, 2009).\nMost school shooters appeared to have difficulty coping\nwith losses, and 98% of the attackers had experienced or\nperceived a major loss prior to the attack (Vossekuil et al.,\n2002). The majority of these losses were a perceived failure\nor loss of status, or the loss of a loved one or of a significant\nrelationship including romantic relationships.\nAcute Strain in the presence of long-term Chronic Strain\nleads the potential shooter to feel that there is nothing left to\nlose and leads to the fourth stage, the Planning Stage. Once\nthe attacker decides to commit a massacre, some time is\nspent planning, as mass murder is not a simple criminal act\n(Levin & Madfis, 2009). Most attackers develop a plan at\nleast 2 days before carrying out the attack, and some spend\nmuch more time than only several days (Vossekuil et al.,\n2002). For example, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold spent\nmore than a year preparing for their attack at Columbine\nHigh School (Larkin, 2007). Time was spent obtaining and\nmodifying guns, and their attack was timed to be on the\nanniversary of Hitler's birthday. School massacres were\nrarely impulsive or spontaneous attacks (Vossekuil et al.,\n2002). School shooters also tended to not have histories of\nhaving had a mental health evaluation and tended to not be\ndiagnosed with a mental disorder (Vossekuil et al., 2002).\nThis mental health background is consistent with the fact\nthat school shooters do not suddenly \"snap\" and commit\nattacks but rather plan them out. Levin and Madfis (2009)\nexamined this phenomenon and determined that if school\nshooters are not \"hallucinating maniacs,\" then a massacre\nmust somehow serve as a rational, albeit immoral, solution\n(p. 1238). The attack acts as a solution to the shooters' most\nserious issues of damaged personal identity and self-worth.\nAttackers see the shooting as a means of forcing others to\ntake notice of them. In addition, a school massacre is used\nas a way of asserting masculinity as much of Western\nculture associates violence with masculinity (Kimmel &\nand emasculated young males believe that a massive\nshooting will regain lost feelings of power, pride, and\nmasculinity, and may also have them achieve international\nThe fifth and final stage in Levin and Madfis's (2009)\nmodel is the Massacre at School, where certain facilitating\nfactors must be in place. In fact, these researchers suggested\nthat most bullied and isolated boys never commit a school\nshooting even if they endure Chronic and Acute Strain, and\nthat many seriously troubled youngsters who have\nconsidered committing a school shooting and even made\nplans for an attack have not carried it out. For potential\nattackers to become school shooters, they must have some\nfirearm proficiency and access to firearms.\nThe Culture of Narcissism Theory\nDe Venanzi (2012) argued that antisocial behaviors in\nschools, especially suburban schools, do not stem from\npervasive violent media content but from society's\nnarcissistic culture. In addition to overconsumption and\nextreme individualism, narcissism has also come to include\nanxiety, a loss of meaning, and a continuous feeling of\nBonanno and Levenson 5\ndissatisfaction (De Venanzi, 2012). Furthermore, De\nVenanzi proposed that society has overemphasized material\ncomfort and narcissism leading to feelings of resentment,\nenvy, and hatred toward others' real or imagined success.\nThese feelings of frustration toward others can be identified\nin school shooters, particularly those in suburban schools,\nand act as an impetus for an attack.\nThe Active Shooter at a College/University\nThe profile for an active shooter in the college setting has\ndifferent motivations (Fox & Savage, 2009). Mass\nshootings in universities are often perpetrated by graduate\nstudents (Fox & Savage, 2009). Instead of a history of\nfeeling bullied or persecuted, like active shooters in high\nschools, older graduate students seem to turn to violence as\na response to what they perceive to be intolerable pressure\nto be successful or the inability to face the reality of failure\n(Fox & Savage, 2009). Graduate students place greater\nemphasis on academic work and training and often lack\nbalance in their personal lives. An intense focus on\nacademic achievement creates high stakes when there is the\npossibility for failure. Fox and Savage (2009) note that\nforeign students have extra pressures because their\nacademic visas are often dependent on their continued\nstudent status. Furthermore, faculty mentors may be less\nsensitive to the pressures placed on graduate students and\nare ultimately the gatekeepers to success. Inherent in the\nunderstanding of what makes a graduate student an active\nshooter surely must be a positive history of a significant\nmental disorder, both known and unknown to their families\nas well as previously treating mental health professionals.\nImproving Survival After School Shooting\nIncidents\nAbout half of the school shooting incidents lasted 15 min or\nless, from the beginning of the shooting until the attacker\nstopped shooting, was apprehended, surrendered, or killed\nby law enforcement or by suicide at the end of an incident.\nFor example, Adam Lanza shot his way into Sandy Hook\nElementary school at 9:35 a.m. and shot himself in the head\nat 9:40 a.m., and it was fewer than 5 min from the time the\nfirst 911 call was placed until Lanza shot himself\n(Sedensky, 2013). Most school shootings were not stopped\nby law enforcement intervention because of their short\nduration. This finding, which has major implications in\nterms of first responders, was the topic of discussion among\nthe informed leaders from medicine, law enforcement,\nfire/rescue, emergency medical services (EMS) first\nresponders, and military experts brought together by The\nAmerican College of Surgeons to explore strategies for\ngenerating policies that will enhance survival of victims of\nmass casualty shooting events (Jacobs et al., 2013). The\nmeeting, known as the Hartford Consensus Conference\nmilitary and recent civilian incidents.\nThe integrated active shooter response recommended by\nThe Hartford Consensus Conference is summarized in the\nacronym \"THREAT\" (Threat suppression, Hemorrhage\ncontrol, Rapid Extraction to safety, Assessment by medical\nproviders, Transport to definitive care). Life threatening\nbleeding from external wounds is best controlled first\nthrough the use of tourniquets whereas internal bleeding\nrequires speedy transport to a hospital setting. Jacobs et al.\n(2013) note that these concepts are straightforward, proven,\nand somewhat inexpensive, and these measures have been\nadopted as best practice by many law enforcement agencies.\nIn addition to hemorrhage control, The Hartford Consensus\nnotes that the response to an active shooter incident must be\nintegrated across law enforcement, fire/rescue, and EMS\npersonnel. The Hartford Consensus stresses that the\nresponse effort must include coordination between law\nenforcement and the medical/evacuation providers.\nCommunication among responders will lead to the best\npossible outcomes and part of this communication is shared\ndefinitions for terms used in mass shooting incidents. In\naddition, The Hartford Consensus recommends jointly\ndeveloped local protocols for responding to active shooter\nevents and the inclusion of active shooter events in table-\ntop and field exercises to further familiarity with the\nprotocols.\nJacobs et al. (2013) noted that long-standing practices\nfor response to shooting events have involved a segmented,\nsequential public safety operation. First, theoretically, law\nenforcement responds by stopping the shooting and then\nthis is followed by rescue and recovery. Although efforts to\nstop the active shooter are still of greatest importance,\nJacobs et al. highlight that, medically, early hemorrhage\ncontrol is essential for maximizing victim survival. Jacobs\net al. urge that initial actions to control bleeding should be\npart of the initial law enforcement response and that\nknowledge of hemorrhage control should be a core law\nenforcement skill. The injuries sustained in active shooter\nincidents bear similarities to those injuries seen in war.\nBased on military experience, hemorrhage is the number\none cause of preventable death in victims of penetrating\ntrauma (Jacobs et al., 2013). To maximize survival of active\nshooter incidents, Jacobs et al. believe that there needs to be\nan updated and integrated system that can accomplish\nmultiple objectives simultaneously.\nThe Hartford Consensus has implications for school\nshootings as well. In the analysis of Vossekuil et al. (2002),\nmost incidents of targeted violence in schools were stopped\nby those within the school or by the attacker's suicide.\nGiven that information, responding law enforcement should\nhave knowledge of hemorrhage control to maximize the\nchances for survival among victims. Basic training in life\nsupport and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) could\nextend to school administrators, teachers, and staff as part\nof school protocol as well.\n6 SAGE Open\nPrevention\nSecurity Measures as Prevention\nSchool shootings, especially those that receive extensive\nmedia coverage, can affect those not directly affected by the\nschool shooting (i.e., a ripple effect). Individuals become\nsusceptible to the availability heuristic, or the cognitive\njudgmental bias in which individuals tend to draw upon\ninformation that is most easily accessible to them (Furlong,\nMorrison, Austin, Huh-Kim, & Skager, 2001; Kahneman &\nTversky, 1996). The result is that when individuals are\nasked about the trend of violence in schools, they typically\ndraw upon the extensive media reports, and their responses\ncould be skewed. In addition, media coverage can affect\nviewers' beliefs about the likelihood of future school\nshootings. The Principle of Bounded Subadditivity is a\ncognitive process that influences the psychological impact\nof an event by changing perceptions that an event that was\nonce considered an impossibility is now a clear reality\nPrinciple of Bounded Subadditivity, an individual can go\nfrom thinking that school shootings do not happen at all, or\nin their type of neighborhood, to thinking that shootings can\nhappen at any school, at any time, in the United States\n(Furlong et al., 2001). In fact, as school shootings continue\nto occur, it seems likely that this cognitive restructuring\nmust occur.\nOftentimes, after an active shooter attack, the media\nfocus on gun control and not on the shooter's personal or\nthe family's responsibility for the actual act. As previously\nnoted, school shooters often have access to guns through a\nrelative or family member. Mass shootings in schools are\namong the most difficult violent acts to prevent using gun\ncontrol (Kleck, 2009). Because most firearms were acquired\nfrom a family member, guns should be stored in a way that\nmakes them completely inaccessible by troubled youngsters\nIn response to a school shooting, many institutions react\nwith increased security measures. Visible security measures\ninclude physical devices (such as the use of security\ncameras) and trained personnel (school security guards) to\nprevent school violence (Addington, 2009). The reason that\nschools increased security was the intense media coverage\nof the Columbine High School shooting as well as the fear\nthat the media coverage instilled among students and\nnational television networks spent more airtime covering\nColumbine than any other previous shooting. The amount\nof news coverage could be seen as reasonable as Columbine\nwas and still is the deadliest high school shooting in U.S.\nhistory. In fact, 68% of Americans followed the coverage of\nColumbine \"very closely,\" and the Columbine High School\nshooting was the third most closely followed story of the\ndecade (Pew Research Center, 1999). Communication\nbetween parents, school administrators, and law\nenforcement personnel likely influenced decisions to\nincrease school security measures.\nThere are several different categories of security\nmeasures that can be implemented in schools (Addington,\n2009). One security measure category is limiting access to\nthe school building through the use of identification cards\n(staff and/or students), locked school entrances including\n\"one-door\" policies, visitor sign-in requirements, and gated\ncampuses. Another category is prohibiting weapons on\ncampus through metal detectors, lockless student lockers,\nand random sweeps for contraband. The third category is\nincreasing surveillance of students through security\ncameras, school resource officers, and staff training (e.g.,\nlockdown drills). The final category of security measure is\nreacting to a crisis or violent incident through student drills,\nduress alarms, and telephones in classrooms. The security\nmeasures that are most frequently used by public school\nsystems are controlling access to the school building,\nlimiting access to social networking websites from school\ncomputers, and prohibiting use of cell phones and text\nmessaging devices (Robers, Kemp, & Truman, 2013).\nAddington (2009) stressed that further research is needed\non the effects of school security measures. Security\nmeasures have the potential for creating a negative school\nenvironment by creating student resentment or a prison-like\nenvironment. Addington noted the limitations of studies\nthat have found the use of school security measures\ncorrelated with higher reports of student victimization and\nfear, and greater school disorder. These studies did not have\nbaseline measures prior to the implementation of security\nmeasures, and so there is no reference point. Addington also\nraised concerns about students' privacy rights in school and\nthe effects of security measures on students' civil liberties.\nClimates of Safety in Schools\nThe key findings from the study by Vossekuil et al. (2002)\nhave implications for methods to address and/or prevent\ntargeted school violence. The fact that most attackers\nformulated a plan and that others knew about the attackers'\nplan offers potential in determining ways to make those\nplans knowable. In addition, most attackers engaged in\nsome behavior that either indicated a need for help or made\nothers concerned, had difficulty coping, and felt bullied or\ninjured before an attack. These pieces of information can be\nused to identify potentially violent students. Overall, the\ninformation can be used to develop methods to evaluate\nrisks through threat assessments and then utilize the\ninformation from the threat assessment to prevent potential\nschool attacks from taking place.\nThreat assessments are effective only within the context\nof a \"climate of safety\" (Fein et al., 2002). The major\nfeatures and tasks for creating a safe school climate are\nsummarized below in Table 2. When schools have a climate\nof safety, adults and students have mutual respect and\nBonanno and Levenson 7\nTable 2. Major Components and Tasks for Creating a Safe/Connected School Climate.\n1. Assess the school's emotional climate.\n2. Emphasize the importance of listening in schools.\n3. Take a strong, but caring stance against the code of silence.\n4. Work actively to change the perception that talking to an adult about a student contemplating violence is considered \"snitching.\"\n5. Find ways to stop bullying.\n6. Empower students by involving them in planning, creating, and sustaining a school culture of safety and respect.\n7. Ensure that every student feels that he or she has a trusting relationship with at least one adult at school.\n8. Create mechanisms for developing and sustaining safe school climates.\n9. Be aware of physical environments and their effects on creating comfort zones.\n10. Emphasize an integrated systems model.\n11. All climates of safety ultimately are \"local.\"\nstudents have a positive connection to at least one adult. In\naddition, students are able to openly voice their concerns\nwithout any fear of reprisal. Without fear of punishment,\nstudents are more likely to help other students who are in\ndistress by appealing to adults in the school environment. In\nthe ideal, safe climate school, concerns are raised and\nhandled early on before they become more serious.\nUltimately, the potential for school violence is reduced\nbecause action is taken instead of the information being\nkept secret until it is too late and an attack has occurred.\nIn a safe school climate, staff and students respect each\nother, and communication between them is encouraged and\nsupported. Staff members serve as positive role models for\nstudents. Diversity is respected, and conflicts are mediated.\nFein et al. (2002) also stressed that teachers and\nadministrators address social\u00ademotional needs in addition\nto academic needs. Part of the respect component is\nestablishing \"shame free zones\" where \"daily teasing and\nbullying is not accepted as a normal part of the adolescent\nwhere bullying and teasing occur regularly can affect\nacademic learning and lead to the strain and isolation that\ndrive some students to physical violence. Part of the safe\nschool climate is an understanding that violence does not\nsolve problems and only makes them worse.\nFormal anti-bullying programs are a way to change\nstudent culture and reduce the strain from interactions with\npeers. Levin and Madfis (2009) recommend Second Step\nand Lesson One as educational programs that teach social\nskills and promote problem solving. Second Step is a\ncomprehensive bullying prevention curriculum that is\nfocused on teaching empathy, emotion-management, and\nproblem-solving skills. Lesson modules are dynamic and\ninteractive, and the program includes online training for all\nstaff. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of\nSecond Step (Frey, Nolen, Edstrom, & Hirschstein, 2005).\nLesson One, which was created by Oliver and Ryan\n(2004), teaches elementary school-aged children to develop\ninternal discipline and other life skills. Research has found\nthat the Lesson One program increased students' self-\ncontrol and problem-solving skills and that the program\nhad a positive impact on school culture (Oliver & Ryan,\nAnother central feature of a safe school climate is\nrelationships among students and relationships between\nstudents and adults, so that students' academic, safety, and\nsocial-emotional needs are met (Fein et al., 2002). All staff\nhave the potential to be a person in whom a student can\nconfide, including teachers, administrators, school\npsychologists, secretaries, coaches, custodians, social\nworkers, counselors, nurses, and safety officers. Each\nstudent needs at least one adult within the school with\nwhom he or she can discuss concerns.\nIn some schools, there is a \"code of silence\" where\nstudents and some adults believe that telling someone that a\nstudent may be posing a threat is a violation of that code\n(Fein et al., 2002). Because most school shooters shared\ntheir plans for an attack with peers, having a \"code of\nsilence\" keeps the information undisclosed. In a school\nclimate of safety, students are more willing to share\nconcerns about their peers without feeling that they are\nsnitching on a friend.\nThreat Assessments\nThe primary objective of a threat assessment is the\nprevention of targeted violence through analysis of the\n\"actions, communications, and specific circumstances that\nmight suggest an individual intends to mount an attack and is\nengaged in planning or preparing for that event\" (Fein et al.,\nassessment process are presented in Table 3. These principles\naddress the nature of targeted violence and the approach that\nshould be taken when investigating. When conducting a\nthreat assessment, attention should be placed on students who\nmake a threat (i.e., have a plan to harm someone) as well as\nthose who pose a threat (i.e., engage in behaviors that suggest\nan intent or plan to attack; Fein et al., 2002). A threat\nassessment investigation should also seek to identify any\nmajor losses or perceived failures with which a student may\nbe struggling to cope. The inquiry must address whether the\nstudent has access to weapons or firearms.\n8 SAGE Open\nTable 3. Six Principles of Threat Assessment Process.\nTargeted violence is the end result of an understandable, and oftentimes discernible, process of thinking and behavior.\nTargeted violence stems from an interaction among the individual, the situation, the setting, and the target.\nAn investigative, skeptical, inquisitive mind-set is critical to successful threat assessment.\nEffective threat assessment is based on facts rather than on characteristics or \"traits.\"\nAn \"integrated systems approach\" should guide threat assessment inquiries and investigations.\nThe central question in a threat assessment inquiry or investigation is whether a student poses a threat not whether the student has\nmade a threat.\nThere are also three elements that guide the formation\nand operation of a school threat assessment program: (a)\nauthority to conduct an assessment, (b) capacity to conduct\ninquiries and investigations, and (c) systems relationships\n(Fein et al., 2002). For authority to conduct an assessment,\nschools need to have policies on collecting and handling\ninformation on potentially threatening situations and criteria\nfor determining whether a threat assessment and\ninvestigation is necessary. Threat assessments involve legal\nissues related to access to and sharing of information and\nsearching students or their property. Administrators should\nconsult with the school's legal counsel. School officials\nshould develop a formal policy that authorizes them to\nconduct a threat assessment and the conditions under which\nthese assessments do not constitute a violation of students'\nrights to privacy.\nIn terms of capacity to conduct school threat\nassessments, schools must be proactive and implement a\nprogram instead of waiting for a crisis to occur. Fein et al.\n(2002) recommended a multidisciplinary threat assessment\nteam with a respected school faculty member or\nadministrator, an investigator (e.g., school resource officer,\nor police officer assigned to the school), a mental health\nprofessional (e.g., school psychologist, clinical\npsychologist, or forensic psychologist), and other\nprofessionals who may contribute to the process (e.g.,\nguidance counselors, teachers, coach). The roles and\nresponsibilities of the team and the individuals should be\nclearly defined, and team members should be trained\ntogether. An ad hoc member of the threat assessment team\ncould be included if there is an individual who knows the\nstudent of concern and can offer additional information.\nThere are also specific skills needed by those members of\nthe threat assessment team such as an analytic and\nquestioning mind-set, familiarity with child development,\nand good judgment in working with others and evaluating\ninformation from multiple sources.\nFinally, integrated systems relationships refer to how a\nthreat assessment program must have relationships among\nindividuals and organizations within the school and external\nto the school. The individuals who form and maintain these\nrelationships across agencies are referred to as \"boundary\nmust have strong interpersonal skills as they act as a formal\nliaison between systems and meet regularly with different\nagencies. They should know how other systems operate as\nthat aids in integrating relationships among agencies,\ndeveloping written protocols, and helping to resolve\nconflicts. Fein et al. (2002) also describe detailed\nprocedures for conducting a school threat assessment and\nmanaging a threatening situation. Fein et al. include a step-\nby-step procedure for establishing a threat assessment\nprogram in a school district as well.\nAnalysis Into the Shooting at Sandy Hook\nElementary School\nAttorney released the report on the shooting at Sandy Hook\nElementary School (Sedensky, 2013). Despite extensive\ninvestigation and information gathering from various\nsources, the report states that Adam Lanza's motives for the\nshooting remain unanswered. This finding could be\naccounted for, in-part, because a computer hard drive from\nLanza's home is still unreadable, and it is highly\nimprobable that data will ever be recovered. The evidence\ndid demonstrate that Lanza had planned his actions\nincluding his suicide but that there was no clear reason as to\nwhy he committed the shootings or why he chose Sandy\nHook Elementary School as his target. Although there may\nnot be a clear-cut concrete explanation for why Adam\nLanza committed a school shooting, at present, analysis of\nthe evidence gathered seems to fit within Levin and\nMadfis's (2009) cumulative strain model and offer possible\nexplanations.\nIn fitting Adam Lanza to this theoretical model, one\nmight speculate on some of his behaviors and resulting\nmotives. The first stage of the model is Chronic Strain.\nDetails suggest that Lanza had experienced Chronic Strain\nat home, in school, and from his own mental health issues.\nThe fact that Lanza killed his mother prior to the massacre\nat school is already suggestive of strain at home. In\naddition, his parents separated in 2001 and eventually\ndivorced. Lanza's relationship with his father deteriorated\ntoward the end of 2010 and although his father continued to\nemail him, Lanza stopped responding. His father remarried\nin 2011. Lanza's older brother moved out of state after\ncollege and had no contact with Lanza from 2010 on.\nTherefore, for about 2 years before the shooting, Lanza had\nno contact with either his father or his older brother.\nBonanno and Levenson 9\nLanza had a relationship with his mother, but it was\nhighly pathological and complex. Some reported that Lanza\nwas close to his mother whereas others said that he did not\nhave \"an emotional connection\" to her (Sedensky, 2013, p.\n30). According to one person, Lanza described his\nrelationship with his mother as \"strained because the\nshooter said her behavior was not rational\" (p. 30).\nNevertheless, his mother did not work because of Lanza's\ncondition. Lanza had sensory issues, multiple daily rituals,\nand eating idiosyncrasies where he was particular about the\nfood he ate and how it was placed on a plate, and his\nmother was responsible for preparing his meals for him.\nLanza's mother frequently did his laundry as he changed his\nclothes often during the day. She also made arrangements\nwith workers who came to the house because Lanza had\nissues with loud noises. At the same time, Lanza never let\nhis mother into his room to clean and communicated with\nher by email despite living in the same house.\nIn terms of strain experienced at school, teacher reports\nseemed mixed about Lanza having been bullied. His father\nsaid that Lanza was bullied about his \"social awkwardness\nand physical gait,\" but it was not excessive (Sedensky,\nDuring his early schooling, he was described as \"a nice kid,\npsychological issues also constituted an additional form of\nstrain. As far back as preschool, Lanza engaged in\n\"repetitive behaviors, temper tantrums, smelling things that\nwere not there, excessive hand washing, and eating\nlikely interfered with his interactions with peers and\nshowed him to be atypical developmentally. In 2005, Lanza\nwas diagnosed with Asperger's Disorder and was described\nas \"presenting with significant social impairments and\nthat Lanza \"lacked empathy and had very rigid thought\nknew Lanza described him as \"unemotional, distant, and\nLanza's dislike of birthdays, holidays, and Christmas by\nsaying he \"had no emotions or feelings\" (Sedensky, 2013,\np. 30). In terms of social-emotional functioning, Lanza\nappears to have extreme difficulties for an extended period\nof time that may have made him feel isolated. Although he\nmay have been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, there\nare suggestions in the record that a more significant mental\ndisturbance might have been present, such as\nSchizophrenia, Paranoid Type.\nLanza appeared to have few interpersonal relationships,\nand those he did have seemed strained. His lack of prosocial\nrelationships leads to Levin and Madfis's (2009) second\nstage of Uncontrolled Strain. Lanza's lack of friends leaves\nthe Chronic Strain he already experienced unchecked. His\nmother noted significant changes in his behavior around the\nseventh grade where Lanza stopped participating in\nactivities such as the school band and playing soccer and\nbaseball. His written work began to reflect violent themes.\nIn fifth grade, he wrote a story in which the protagonist has\na gun in her cane and shoots at people including children.\nHis seventh grade writing assignments were \"obsessed\nabout battles, destruction, and war, far more than others his\nage\" and the amount of violence in the writing was\n\"disturbing\" according to Lanza's teacher (Sedensky, 2013,\nLater, Lanza appeared to become more of a loner and\nmore socially isolated. In 9th and 10th grades, he became\nreclusive and stayed in his bedroom playing video games all\nday. He played a variety of video games, some of which\nhad violent content, and he had a computer game called\n\"School Shooting.\" Lanza had a cell phone but never used\nit. In addition, his high levels of anxiety, Asperger's\ncharacteristics, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and\nsensory issues significantly limited his participation in a\nregular education setting. Interventions were suggested,\nspecifically tutoring, desensitization, and medication, but\nLanza refused to take medication and did not engage in the\nrecommended behavior therapies. Mental health\nprofessionals who saw Lanza did not see any aggressive or\nthreatening tendencies that would have predicted his later\nactions.\nIn the third stage of the cumulative strain model, the\nschool shooter experiences an Acute Strain, which is some\nloss that is perceived as catastrophic by the attacker and\nserves as a catalyst for the shooting. Lanza's mother had\nplans to sell her house in Newtown and move to either\nWashington State or North Carolina. Of those choices,\nLanza wanted to move to Washington. The plan was for\nhim to go to a special school in Washington or get a\ncomputer job in North Carolina. Although such a move may\nnot appear catastrophic to many, Lanza had extreme anxiety\nalong with a myriad of other mental health issues. For them\nto move, his mother was going to buy a recreational vehicle\n(RV) to help with showing and selling the house because\nLanza refused to sleep in a hotel. In fact, when their house\nlost power after Hurricane Sandy, Lanza stayed in the house\nrefusing to go to a hotel. If Lanza's overall debilitating\nanxiety prevented him from staying in a hotel, moving to a\nnew house in a new state may very well have proved\ncatastrophic for him.\nWhen Acute Strain occurs while long-term Chronic\nStrain persists, the potential shooter begins to feel that there\nis nothing left to lose and enters the fourth stage, the\nPlanning Stage (Levin & Madfis, 2009). The evidence from\nthe Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting indicated that\nLanza had formulated a plan. It is difficult to say when\nLanza began planning but he was home alone two days\nbefore the shooting while his mother made a trip to New\nHampshire (she had prepared his favorite meals for him\nbefore leaving). Evidence indicated that Lanza had a\npreoccupation with mass shootings, especially the 1999\nshooting at Columbine High School. In fact, a spreadsheet\nlisting mass murders with information about each incident\nwas found among his possessions. He also collected\nnewspaper articles about school shootings, one from 2008\nof the school shooting in Northern Illinois University and\nsome from 1891 about the shooting of schoolchildren.\nLanza clearly had a plan as he had materials regarding mass\nmurders, had removed his Global Positioning System (GPS)\nfrom his car, used ear plugs during the shooting,\npurposefully damaged his hard drive, and waited for his\nmother to return from New Hampshire and then murdered\nher. Extreme emotional disturbance was ruled out as a\ndefense for Lanza, which fits Levin and Madfis's (2009)\nmodel.\nThe final stage in Levin and Madfis's (2009) model is the\nMassacre at School where certain facilitating factors must be\nin place, specifically access to and proficiency with firearms.\nAll of the firearms that Lanza used had been legally\npurchased by his mother. In fact, shooting was a family\npastime. Lanza's mother grew up shooting guns, and they\nenjoyed target shooting together. Lanza and his mother took\nNational Rifle Association (NRA) safety courses. She had\neven written out a Christmas check for Lanza to purchase\nanother firearm. His mother believed that \"it was good to\nIn Levin and Madfis's (2009) model, the attack is\nunderstood to be a solution to the shooters' issues of\ndamaged self-worth and/or a means of forcing others to take\nnotice of them. Investigators question why Lanza targeted\nSandy Hook Elementary School. Except for attending\nSandy Hook as a child, Lanza had no continuing\ninvolvement with the school. He was never assigned to any\nof the specific classrooms he attacked when he had attended\nthe school. Perhaps, one has to step back from the specifics\nin this case and view how the shooting fits into the larger\nscheme. Lanza was obsessed with the Columbine High\nSchool shooting, which was and still is the deadliest high\nschool shooting in U.S. history. Lanza's attack at Sandy\nHook is the deadliest elementary school shooting in U.S.\nhistory, and it is the second deadliest school shooting after\nthe Virginia Tech shooting. His goal may have been to\nachieve international attention, and Sandy Hook Elementary\nSchool may have been selected merely because of\nfeasibility. In addition, the classrooms that Lanza attacked\nmay have had no significance except for their physical\nposition near the front of the school where he entered the\nbuilding.\nConclusion\nMass casualty school shootings have occurred with\nincreasing frequency in the past 20 years. Research is\nneeded on prevention, particularly in the areas of security of\nthe physical plant, school climate, and promoting prosocial\nbehavior among students, faculty, and staff. Professional\ndevelopment activities that consist of pertinent information\nregarding known characteristics of school shooters should\nbe a regular part of all school personnel's continuing\neducation. School districts need to form partnerships with\nlaw enforcement personnel who are specialists in threat\nassessment with the goal of policy and program\ndevelopment as prevention measures.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAddington, L.
