In this article, we present an informed-consent process that we piloted and\nimproved to obtain consent from older adults in Yucatan, Mexico. Respondents had limited fluency in Spanish, spoke the\nlocal Mayan language, and had some physical limitations due to their age. We describe how we adapted the informed-consent\nprocess to comply with U.S. and Mexican regulations, while simplifying the forms and providing them in Spanish and Mayan.\nWe present the challenges and lessons learned when dealing with low-literacy older populations, some with diminished\nautonomy, in a bilingual context and a binational approach to the legal framework.\n",

Researchers doing international work may\nneed creative approaches to comply with requirements from\ndomestic and foreign IRBs.\nIn this article, we review efforts to gain informed consent\namong participants in an income-supplement program in\nYucatan, Mexico, in a way that was acceptable to both the host\ncountry for the research and the home country of the research-\ners.As part of its social policies to improve the quality of life for\nolder adults, the Yucatan state government collaborated with\nresearchers from the RAND Corporation, the a (USC), and\nother U.S. and U.K. institutions to design, implement, and eval-\nuate an income-supplement program for persons aged 70 and\nolder (Aguila, Kapteyn, Robles, Vargas, & Weidmer, 2014).\nThe state of Yucatan occupies the northern part of the\nYucatan peninsula in Southeastern Mexico. Nearly one third\n(32.6%) of its population lives in rural areas (Instituto Nacional\nde Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda [INEGI], 2010), and nearly half\n(45.7%) lives in poverty (Consejo Nacional de Evaluaci\u00f3n de\nla Pol\u00edtica de Desarrollo Social [CONEVAL], 2012). Poverty is\nhigher in Mexico among those who speak an indigenous lan-\nguage (76%) than it is among those who do not (43%); Yucatan\nis the state with the highest proportion (51%) of inhabitants\nwho speak an indigenous language (CONEVAL, 2014).\nThe program included a detailed survey of selected house-\nhold members on demographic characteristics, income and\nassets, employment history, expenditures on durable and\nnon-durable goods, family transfers, health and physical sta-\ntus, access to and use of health care, medication use, social\nnetworks, social support and caregiving responsibilities,\ndietary intake, and food security. For eligible individuals, it\nalso included anthropometric and selected biomarker mea-\nMany individuals had limited literacy, and most spoke the\nnative indigenous language, Mayan, with only limited fluency\nin the national language, Spanish. Many of these persons also\nhad limited autonomy given their age. In developing informed-\nconsent processes for them, we paid particular attention to\ndeveloping a culturally appropriate process that conformed to\nboth U.S. and Mexican norms and regulations for conducting\nsocial-science research involving human subjects.\nThis study expands the scant information previously\navailable on gaining informed consent among older individ-\nuals outside of community centers or nursing homes. Taub,\nKline, and Baker (1981) found that special methods may be\nneeded to present informed-consent processes to elderly per-\nsons with limited vocabulary and low levels of education.\nPrevious research noted that older persons in nursing homes\nhave difficulties in providing informed consent, given their\nlevels of mental competence (see, for example, Annas &\nGlantz, 1986; Cohen-Mansfield, Kerin, Pawlson, Lipson, &\nMethod\nAn Overview of the Informed-Consent Process\nHuman subjects who are invited as potential participants on\nresearch projects should be considered autonomous individ-\nuals, capable of deciding their own acts after deliberating\nwhether to participate in a project (National Commission for\nthe Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and\nBehavioral Research [NCPHS], 1978). As such, they should\nbe provided with all pertinent information about the project,\nincluding potential risks and benefits, as well as assurance\nthat their decision will not influence any benefit, such as the\nright to health care or government benefits, to which they\nResearchers should ensure that potential participants\nclearly understand participation is voluntary, free of coer-\ncion, and can be terminated any time without any undesir-\nable consequence to their rights (NCPHS, 1978).

Documentation of this informed consent is usually\ncollected on paper using a digital or hand-written signature\n(CONEVAL, 2012).

Such IRBs must register with the Department\nof Health and Human Services. To register, an IRB must\nhave a Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) for the Protection of\nHuman Subjects, which must be renewed every 3 years. The\nFWA is the only means accepted by the Office for Human\nResearch Protections to assure that the institution will com-\nply with federal requirements (U.S. Department of Health\nIn line with these policies, RAND's IRB, known as the\nHuman Subjects Protection Committee (HSPC), is responsi-\nble for reviewing every research project undertaken by the\ninstitution, regardless of the source of funding and project\nlocation.

They are also responsible for reporting any\nevent that departs from the expected course of the project, as\nwell as any event that may harm participants in the research,\nregardless of whether this is related to research procedures\n(NCPHS, 1978). Likewise, every PI is responsible for sub-\nmitting any changes to the research protocol initially\napproved, whether it is an amendment to project procedures,\na request for approval of any new component to the project\n(e.g., a new survey), or a progress report, as long as the proj-\nect is kept \"active\" by HSPC. After the project is closed, the\nPI is responsible for safeguarding signed informed-consent\nforms, as well as for protecting participant confidentiality in\npresentations or publications of results.\nSuch responsibilities extend to all staff considered to be\nRAND's \"agents,\" including project members hired by\nRAND directly or indirectly (i.e., through an in-country sub-\ncontractor, such as an academic or a public institution). This\nrequires that local staff involved in any RAND project\nreceive adequate training in human-subject protection and\nadhere to RAND policies and procedures for protecting the\nRequirements for Protecting Human Subjects\nParticipating in Research in Mexico\nGovernment-regulated procedures for protecting human sub-\njects in Mexico have a shorter history than they have in the\nUnited States. Although the General Health Law, which regu-\nlates human-based research, established informed consent as\na legal requirement in the mid-1980s (C\u00e1mara de Diputados\nMinistry of Health establish the National Commission of\nBioethics (NCB). Following a presidential agreement in\n2000, the NCB became a permanent body with technical and\noperational autonomy (Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n, 2005).\nThe NCB is responsible for establishing and promoting\nhealth policies related to bioethics, encouraging the creation\nof Bioethics Commissions for each state of Mexico, estab-\nlishing guidelines and criteria for the activities of these com-\nmittees, and promoting bioethics education among health\ncare institutions (Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Bio\u00e9tica [NCB],\nn.d.). The mission of NCB to promote norms and guidelines\nfor research ethics committees includes the informed-con-\nsent process for social and biomedical research (NCB, 2005).\nEvery public, private, or social institution that operates\nunder the National Health System and conducts research\ninvolving human subjects should have a Local Research\nEthics Committee (LREC), equivalent to an IRB in the\nUnited States. LRECs are responsible for reviewing and\napplying research ethics to all types of research, but typically\nsuch reviews are reserved for projects that have human sub-\njects (Valdez-Martinez, Turnbull, Gardu\u00f1o-Espinosa, &\nPorter, 2006). Institutions that conduct research involving\nhuman subjects are mandated by law to submit their research\nprotocol to a LREC.\nSocial-science and biomedical research conducted in\nMexico historically has had little regulation, with many\nresearch projects routinely failing to use an informed-consent\nAlthough the commission promotes LRECs as part of its\ncapacity-building mandate, their establishment is left to uni-\nversities, research centers, or other research entities (Comisi\u00f3n\nde Salud Fronteriza M\u00e9xico-Estados Unidos, 2010).\nComplying with the law can take time, so many Mexican\nuniversities and research centers have no LRECs. This is par-\nticularly evident in institutions that do not regularly carry out\nresearch. State-level ministries of health are not required to\n(and often do not) have LRECs. At the time of our research,\nYucatan was not among the 20 states (of 32) that had for-\nmally established a LREC.\nResearchers collaborating with these institutions may find\nit necessary to find another institution, such as a local univer-\nsity with an LREC, to review their study. There are no guide-\nlines for such review, and there is often a disconnect between\nthe reviewing institution's LREC and the goals and needs of\nthe proposed research. As a result, the review process may be\nlong and tedious, often discouraging researchers from going\nthrough it (Comisi\u00f3n de Salud Fronteriza M\u00e9xico-Estados\nUnidos, 2010). This can make binational research difficult\ngiven U.S. requirements for IRB approval.\nAccording to the NCB (2005), informed consent involves\na social process that should provide information about the\nresearch in an understandable way to the respondent, allow\nthe researcher to verify that the respondent understands what\nparticipation involves, and provide the opportunity for the\n4 SAGE Open\nrespondent to ask questions and have them answered. The\nprocess must also allow the respondent to decline participa-\ntion without being subject to intimidation, coercion, or being\nunduly influenced by incentives that could be viewed as\ncoercive (Aguilera-Guzm\u00e1n, Mondrag\u00f3n Barrios, Icaza, &\nIn practice, informed-consent processes in Mexico focus\nmore on the completion of the consent form as a legal\nrequirement than on the process of actually acquiring effec-\ntive \"informed\" consent. A shortage in adequate training,\nguidance, and supervision of LRECs results in reviews that\nfocus on rules, regulations, and improving research methods\nand analyses rather than on protecting the rights and well-\nbeing of participants (Angeles-Llerenas, Wirtz, & Lara-\nDeveloping Informed-Consent Methods for Our\nProject Population\nRequirements for our project included asking for informed\nconsent from participants at each stage of the survey.\nSpecifically, we asked respondents for their consent to take\npart in the general survey (oral), allow the research team to\nreview administrative and health records (written), and col-\nlect anthropometric and biomarker measurements (written),\nwhile assuring informants that we would protect individual\nconfidentiality. Developing consent forms that could easily\nexplain the aim of the project to the participants posed a chal-\nlenge, given their age, language barriers, low levels of\nschooling, and cultural characteristics (Gostin, 1991). We\nsought to respect the autonomy of the individuals, especially\ngiven that some participants had physical constraints. The\nproject also had to comply with both U.S. and Mexican regu-\nlations regarding research with human subjects.\nTo develop the informed-consent documents, we first\nreviewed forms previously used in other projects, particu-\nlarly those similar in scope and complexity and that had used\nwritten rather than oral consent. We developed an initial ver-\nsion of the consent forms in English for RAND HSPC\nreview, then translated them into Spanish.\nBefore moving into the field, all field staff underwent a\n2-week training course on study procedures and selected\naspects of human-subject protection. This course included\npractical interview topics, such as how interviewers should\nintroduce themselves and the project to potential participants,\nas well as administrative procedures, including data-safe-\nguarding plans and handling of potential adverse events.\nTraining included theory (lectures) and practice (group ses-\nsions to enact interviewing procedures). To promote a cultur-\nallysensitiveinteractionbetweenrespondentsandinterviewers,\na local anthropologist gave a lecture to interviewers about\nMayan culture and the role of the elderly in society. Training\nwas followed by the pilot field-test phase, in which interview-\ners visited homes to collect written informed consent and test\nthe data-collection forms.\nA first pilot test was conducted at a nearby site, in a local-\nity called Progreso, away from the area where the project\nwas to be conducted. This pilot test involved approximately\n200 Spanish-speaking participants and included the applica-\ntion of the informed-consent forms as well as the full battery\nof planned individual- and household-level data-collection\nprocedures. We requested written informed consent for the\nsurvey, for access to administrative or health records from\nany public program in which the subject had taken part, and\nfor anthropometric and biomarker measurements.\nParticipants who signed the informed-consent form were\ngiven a copy for future reference.\nWe followed the same procedures in each pilot test to\nidentify issues and challenges of the survey application. The\nPI, survey director, local project director, and field coordina-\ntor accompanied the field staff during these pilot tests to\nobserve directly the informed-consent process. Following\neach field-test, all project staff held two extensive debriefing\nsessions to identify salient issues and major challenges.\nThe first debriefing session was held the last day of each\npilot test between interviewers and supervisor. Interviewers\nreported their findings to their supervisor who made notes\nand merged these comments with his or her own observa-\ntions during the pilot test. The PI, survey director, local proj-\nect director, and field coordinator also attended and made\nnotes in these debriefings. The first debriefing sessions lasted\non average 2 hr each. At the end of this session, supervisors\nsummarized the main issues and challenges for the field\ncoordinator. The field coordinator, in turn, summarized, by\ntopic, main issues, and challenges identified in the debriefing\nsessions.Areport for discussion was then presented to the PI,\nsurvey director, local project director, and a local researcher\nexpert on primary data collection. This subsequent meeting\nsought potential solutions to the challenges faced in the pilot\ntest and to highlight items requiring further information.\nThe second debriefing session summarized the issues and\nchallenges faced by all interviewers and supervisors, and dis-\ncussed potential solutions with all field staff. The second\ndebriefing session lasted on average between 3 and 4 hr, and\nincluded 35 staff members: all five teams (each comprising\nfive interviewers and one supervisor), the field coordinator,\nlocal project director, survey director, a local expert on pri-\nmary data collection, and the PI. During the first 30 to 40 min\nof the second debriefing session, the field coordinator pre-\nsented the main issues raised in the first debriefing session.\nIn the next 60 min, participants provided feedback of addi-\ntional items not considered in the summary or provided\ndeeper insights about a specific item. In the next 90 min,\nparticipants had a brainstorming session on solutions to the\nissues presented. The survey director led the debriefings and\norganized the discussion. Supervisors, the local project\ndirector, the field coordinator, the local expert on primary\ndata collection, and the PI all made notes during the second\ndebriefing sessions. After the second debriefing, the field\ncoordinator revised the summary of issues and challenges\nAguila et al. 5\nwith suggested solutions, using her notes and the debriefing\nnotes of supervisors, the local project director, the local\nexpert on primary data collection, and the PI. The field coor-\ndinator provided this report to the survey director and local\nexpert on primary data collection, who then made a final\ndecision on the feasibility of changes to the informed-con-\nsent protocol and who prepared a report for the RAND IRB.\nThe revised forms were drafted in Spanish, and the local\nexpert on primary data collection helped simplify them\n(Aguila, Cervera, Martinez, & Weidmer, 2015). Revised\nconsent forms and reports of the field-tests were then trans-\nlated into English, to be submitted as an amendment to the\nreport for RAND HSPC.\nAfter the debriefings of the first pilot test in Progreso, we\nrealized that the informed-consent forms needed to be trans-\nlated to Mayan for respondents who could not fully under-\nstand the process in Spanish. Bilingual (Spanish\u00adMayan)\nstaff reviewed all forms prepared by professional Mayan\ntranslators for content and accuracy. We then conducted a\nsecond pilot test in a nearby town, Teabo, using the Mayan-\nlanguage versions of the informed-consent and survey instru-\nments. The translation of the instruments was a major\nenterprise that increased project costs but was necessary to\nconduct research with the indigenous elderly.\nThe informed-consent forms were provided in both\nSpanish and Mayan to all project participants, who were\nallowed to keep a copy for future reference. All interviews\nand procedures were conducted in a place that provided com-\nfort and privacy for respondents, whether in their own home\nor, if respondents so chose, in a place such as a school, church,\nor government office. Interviewers made sure respondents\nunderstood that they could refuse to answer any question, par-\nticipate in one component of the project but not another, or\nwithdraw from the project at any point, without giving up any\nstate-government benefit to which they were entitled.\nResults\nDuring the debriefing sessions held by project and field staff\nafter the first pilot test, it became obvious that many partici-\npants were intimidated by the consent form and process.\nThere were three issues causing problems.\nFirst, many respondents, particularly those with low lev-\nels of education, were not able to understand the content and\nlanguage of the forms. The length of the forms and the time\nthey took to discuss (as much as 30 min) proved too tedious\nfor many potential participants. Many became tired, and lost\nattention, interest, or willingness to participate. Many of our\ninterviewers were also unfamiliar with informed-consent\nprocesses. While most held an undergraduate degree, and\n30% had participated in previous data-collection projects,\nnone were familiar with the human-subject protection pro-\ncess before our training.\nSecond, many respondents were illiterate or had poor\nvision; hence, they were unable to read any of the forms. As\ndescribed by an interviewer, one male participant who lived\nalone in the city of Progreso \"gladly agreed to participate\" in\nthe project. However, referring to the consent forms, he said,\n\"I can participate but I cannot sign them because I cannot see\nwell and I do not have glasses; therefore, I prefer not to sign.\"\nOthers who could not read the forms were afraid to sign\nsomething they were unable to read, for fear of being tricked\ninto something that they could not independently verify. In\nsome instances, having a family member or a field inter-\nviewer read the form out loud helped. Still, the written nature\nof the documents posed an obstacle for a number of\nparticipants.\nThird, participants were intimidated by the consent pro-\ncess and, particularly, signing the consent forms. The lack of\nknowledge and understanding of consent forms caused many\nrespondents to fear that someone would somehow take\nadvantage of them. In some cases, respondents refused to\nsign the consent forms though they indicated willingness to\nparticipate in the study. The requirement to sign document\nmade them suspicious of the intentions of the field staff.\nThese suspicions could relate to fears of being duped by,\nor associated with, criminals. The words of a female partici-\npant, as recalled by an interviewer, provide an example of\nthese fears:\nI will not sign any documents because I'm afraid that you can\nuse my information for some illegal purpose, as I had heard on\nthe news about fraudulent calls being made to old persons in\nwhich strangers said that they have personal information of a\nfamily member and they used them for criminal purposes if they\ndid not give money.\nShe also mentioned being wary due to cases she had heard\nin which criminals used others'names and signatures to steal\nmoney from bank accounts. The participant had no problem\nunderstanding the project or forms. She simply refused to\nprovide her signature due to fears of theft and fraud.\nIn another case of refusal, when asked for her signature, a\nfemale participant said, \"No, I'm afraid you guys might take\naway my property or belongings.\" After more conversation\nand explanation by the interviewer, she still asserted, \"I do\nnot know, because you could change everything and make\nthis like a distraction to take away the small valued things\nthat I have left.\"\nRespondents also feared that \"the government\" would\ntake advantage of them. For example, a female participant\nwho refused to sign the consent form said, \"The government\nonly wants our signatures to get more money, so the people\nin the government can continue robbing our money.\"Another\nfemale participant said,\nI detest everything related to the government; if I accepted to\ncollaborate with you, it's because I care about people like you\nwho are just doing their job to support your families, but I'm not\ngoing to sign any official document to the government. I do not\nwant to be associated with the government in any way.\n6 SAGE Open\nFamily members sometimes reinforced such fears,\nactively discouraging or preventing their elder relative from\nsigning the form. They feared that a signature would com-\npromise their property or possessions, or waive some privi-\nleges related to government-sponsored welfare programs. In\nthe words of one participant's wife, who supported her hus-\nband's decision to participate without signing the consent\nform, \"We found the study very interesting and we're very\ngrateful for having been taken into consideration. However,\nwe don't see any benefit or advantage in other people\nreview[ing] our administrative and health records.\" Other\npotential participants were reluctant to provide a signature\nwithout the presence or advice from a trusted family mem-\nber: \"I am not signing any document without the presence of\nmy son,\" one female participant said, \"because I do not\nunderstand many things and I am afraid to get into trouble.\"\nTo address these issues, we revised the forms to be shorter\nand simply describe the project. Final versions of Spanish\nand Mayan informed-consent forms can be found at (Aguila\net al., 2015). We also modified the informed-consent process\nto promote an exchange of information between the inter-\nviewer and respondent. Revised forms submitted to the\nRAND HSPC eliminated the requirement for the partici-\npant's signature, replacing it with the interviewer's signature\nas a \"witness to informed consent.\" That is, an interviewer's\nsignature would attest that the interviewer had reviewed the\ncontent of the consent form with the respondent, offered\nappropriate answers to any question or concern of the poten-\ntial participant, and obtained oral consent from the respon-\ndent to proceed with the survey. The forms allowing the field\nstaff access to administrative or health records were held by\ngovernment programs or health providers, and therefore\nrequired an actual signature from the participant. The revised\nversions of these forms allowed for a signature or fingerprint\nor even for a legally authorized representative to sign when\nthe participant was unable to do so. In short, we simplified\nthe consent forms for participation, while maintaining the\nbasic elements of informed consent required by the HSPC.\nWe found that it was difficult for the interviewers to intro-\nduce the project to the eligible adults, or their relatives, and\nto clarify all questions regarding the consent form. We\nresolved these problems through more training as well as\npositive feedback and reinforcement of interviewer activities\nby field supervisors and project coordinators. In our debrief-\nings, we discussed the field-test experience with interviewers\nand identified processes or procedures with which interview-\ners experienced difficulty and needed modification. In our\nfield-test observations, we found that interviewers struggled\nwith how to present the study to respondents, succinctly\nanswer questions posed by respondents or their friends and\nfamily, and persuade respondents (or gatekeepers) to sign the\nconsent forms and participate in the study.\nWe instructed interviewers to ask for written informed con-\nsent for anthropometric and biomarker measurements after the\nindividual interview, which only required oral consent, was\nfinished. This allowed the interviewer to establish rapport with\nthe respondent, and considerably improved the consent rate\nfor more invasive procedures. Figure 1 shows the flow of the\ninformed-consent process for the overall project.\nUltimately, the interviewers were able to obtain consent\nfrom a high proportion of eligible individuals. Table 1 sum-\nmarizes the number of individuals in the two localities,\nValladolid and Motul, where baseline data collection began\ninitial consent in the baseline survey, 94.5% did so for the\nfirst follow-up, and 91.8% did so for the second follow-up.\nConsent rates were higher for Mayan than for Spanish speak-\ners across the three waves. The decrease in the proportion of\neligible individuals who completed and gave their consent to\nparticipate in the follow-up survey was due to illness, death,\nrefusal, or address change. There were no reports of eligible\nindividuals declining to participate in the follow-up surveys\nbecause of issues related to the informed-consent form.\nIn Table 1, we can observe the proportion of individuals\nwho, in Spanish or Mayan, gave written consent for access to\ntheir administrative and health records and for anthropomet-\nric and biomarker measurements. These written-consent\nrates were lower than the initial oral-consent rates to respond\nto the survey. These differences indicate that respondents\nwere aware they could provide, or refuse, consent for differ-\nent elements of the process.\nDiscussion\nof obtaining informed consent among the marginalized pop-\nulations deserves special attention. Dula (1997) similarly\nnotes several reasons why implementation of research with\nadequate informed consent is especially relevant among eth-\nnically and financially marginalized populations. These\ninclude the history of abuse of informed consent that may\ncause distrust, particularly among minority populations.\nObtaining the consent of such individuals \"calls for commu-\nnity consultation, education, and involvement.\" These can be\ndifficult to obtain among such populations.\nOther studies including minorities have found that trust is\nkey for survey participation. Barata et al. (2006) examined\ncross-cultural perspectives on informed-consent procedures in\nmedical research among Portuguese Canadian and Black\nCaribbean Canadian immigrants. In both groups, the key to\nattaining informed consent was the degree of trust or mistrust\narising in the process. The Portuguese considered interper-\nsonal trust relevant to participation, while Black Caribbean\nrespondents reported establishing trust to verify the legitimacy\nand safety of the study. The Black Caribbean respondents suf-\nfered more fear and anxiety about participating due to mistrust\nof the research and because the study could stigmatize their\ncommunity. Even increasing participation in the focus-group\nsession was difficult and only accomplished when a well-\nknown community member asked for participation.\nAguila et al. 7\nA number of scholars have paid increasing attention to\ninformed-consent procedures for indigenous (Native\nAmerican) populations. Ellis and Earley (2008) explored the\nvalue of employing culturally sensitive informed-consent pro-\ncedures, such as offering asemaa (tobacco ties) symbolizing\nreciprocity among different cultural groups.

Some\nhave argued that social-research ethics should follow medi-\ncal- and clinical-research ethics emphasizing the values of\nautonomy of subjects, non-maleficence (\"Research must not\ninflict harm\"), beneficence (\"Research should benefit oth-\ners\"), and justice (\"People must be treated equally within the\nresearch process\"; Wiles, Heath, Crow, & Charles, 2005).\nSocial-science researchers (Goodwin, Pope, Mort, & Smith,\ncized such a strict adherence to ethical principles as not\nreflecting the reality of social research where ethical dilem-\nmas encountered are highly context-specific. Warnock\n(1998), for instance, contended that there could be cases,\nsuch as in conducting research with mentally incompetent\nparticipants, where these principles are breached. Tobias\n(1998) similarly suggested that social science demands much\nmore lenient imposition of informed-consent requirements,\ngiven that informed consent for social research is often dif-\nficult to obtain. As Couture (2008) suggested, in social-\nscience research the \"benefits and costs of informed consent\nshould be carefully considered in each situation (p. 1).\"\nThe simplicity or complexity of developing adequate\ninformed-consent procedures depends on the location of the\nproject, specific cultural or demographic characteristics of\nthe target population, the nature of the research proposed,\nrequirements of participating institutions, and local rules and\nregulations on conducting research (Chin et al., 2011;\nKripalani et al., 2008). For our Yucatan research, the lack of\na LREC affected both researchers and respondents. For\nresearchers, this lack made it more difficult to conduct col-\nlaborative binational research. Such difficulties reduce\nincentives to conduct research among marginalized commu-\nnities, reinforcing their marginalization.\nAdapting the informed-consent process to be more cultur-\nally competent required additional resources and staff train-\ning, and delayed implementation of the study. Doing so,\nhowever, allowed us to conduct successful research with a\nmarginalized elderly population in a developing country\nwithout international IRB standards or procedures.\nFollowing a dialectic approach, we conducted initial field-\ntesting with extensive debriefing of the field staff about their\nexperiences, and used this and local researcher expertise in\nprimary data collection to restructure our interview forms.\nOur pilot test in Spanish helped us realize the importance of\ntranslating the informed-consent protocols and survey instru-\nments to Mayan. One of our subsequent pilot tests completely\nfocused on the Mayan-speaking populations, helping us adapt\nour process to their particular characteristics.\nThe project would not have succeeded without an itera-\ntive process of cultural exchange and adaptation that reflected\ntrue commitment to the ethical principle of respect for per-\nsons. One of the key contributors to the success of a research\nproject of this type is interviewer training. We conducted\ncomprehensive training sessions to instruct the interviewers\nabout the importance of the informed-consent process.\nTraining the project staff about the Mayan culture, traditions,\nand role of the elderly in society helped the research team\nunderstand the need to conduct research for this marginal-\nized population. We collaborated with a local expert on\nMayan culture who gave a lecture during field staff training.\nTable 1.

The number of eligible individuals for the first and second follow-up does not include persons who died or could not be contacted. The difference\nbetween eligible and those who gave their consent is non-response due to illness, death, refusal, or address change.\nAguila et al. 9\nThe collaboration with our IRB was also key in the rede-\nsign of the informed-consent process. Harmonizing U.S. and\nMexican regulations was always a focal point. It may be worth\nnoting that, at RAND, PIs are regularly invited to HSPC meet-\nings where their projects are reviewed. This allows for interac-\ntion and clarification between the researcher and the full IRB\ncommittee. While field-testing of instruments and processes\ncan be challenging for projects with time and budget con-\nstraints, we found it to be vital in ensuring that our project was\nconducted with both ethical and methodological rigor.\nWe tried to ease participants'fears of exploitation by allow-\ning for oral or fingerprint consent. We implemented a staged\nprocess of consent. For the interview, we were able to rely on\noral consent, with interviewers signing the consent form, indi-\ncating their role as \"witness to informed consent.\" This allowed\nrespondents to feel at ease with interviewers. It also allowed\ninterviewers to establish rapport with respondents before ask-\ning for a signed authorization to conduct more invasive tests,\nincluding anthropometry. When dealing with illiterate persons,\ninterviewers were authorized to collect the signature of a fam-\nily member on behalf of the older relative or a digital signature\n(i.e., a fingerprint) from the participant, with interviewers then\nalso signing as \"witness to informed consent.\"\nConclusion\nIn this article, we presented the experience of a group of\nresearchers from a U.S.-based institution involved in research\nin a developing country, facing different challenges with the\ntarget population. These challenges included the target popu-\nlation's age, physical or mental frailty, reduced autonomy\nand privacy, low levels of schooling, and language chal-\nlenges. In spite of these challenges, we were able to develop\nadequate consent forms, building on previous experience\nacquired in our own institution by other research groups fac-\ning similar conditions, and submitting our initial consent\nprocedures, including informed-consent forms, to several\niterations field-tested in subsequent pilot runs.\nOne of our most important lessons is that of involving local\nexperts. Our project, though binational and cross-cultural from\nthe outset, underwent even more cultural adaptation than antic-\nipated. By approaching this project with a sense of mutual\nrespect and flexibility, and by partnering with local researchers\nfamiliar with the nuances of indigenous norms, we were able\nto adapt our processes in ways that dramatically increased\ntheir acceptability to the target population. Specifically, we are\ngrateful to a local researcher expert on primary data collection\nwho participated in field-tests and debriefing sessions that\nshaped the informed-consent protocol. We intentionally chose\nproject interviewers from the communities where they would\nbe working, and who were able to recognize and explain the\ndiscomforts respondents had with the original consent forms\nand procedures. We accommodated participants' cultural pref-\nerences by conducting interviews in their native language, with\nparticipation of the whole household.\nOverall, there must be ongoing dialogue about whose\nauthority should take primacy in decisions regarding \"best\npractices\" for informed consent when different stakehold-\ners hold divergent viewpoints. U.S.-based IRB bodies and\nfederal regulations may have quite different expectations\nfor consent procedures than LREC. LRECs in turn might\nhold very different expectations than the target population\nhas. Better understanding how to balance these competing\ndemands and interests is critical as scientific inquiry\nbecomes increasingly global. Future empirical research\nshould show how research with vulnerable groups can\nalign with the ethical imperatives that lie at the heart of\nresearch on human subjects: minimizing harm, maximiz-\ning benefit, respecting human dignity and autonomy, and\nstriving to distribute equitably the benefits and burdens of\nresearch.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nresearch was supported by funding from the State of Yucatan and\nfrom the National Institute on Aging and various units at the RAND\nCorporation.
