    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study describes a series of regularly scheduled residents' meetings (RMs) on local disability policy during a 15-year\nperiod. The study employed an action research analytical method using data gathered in Yao city in western Japan. From 2002\nto 2007, I participated in the meetings as an advisor--overseeing two focus groups, each with six key informants who actively\nmanaged the meetings. According to the results, the meetings occurred in three phases: the officials' initiatives (2002-2003),\ncollaborations between city officials and leading residents (2004-2006), and the final fiscal year (2007). Initially, city officials\nor I led the meetings; later, however, certain residents accepted leadership roles to manage the meetings. Subsequently, the\nfocus group interviewees successfully managed projects. Although these projects were not the ultimate goals of the RMs,\nthey enabled residents to redefine disability issues in the community.\n",

In addition, I employed the\nsense-making theory, which is based on the narratives of organi-\nzation members, and Ross's (1955) three community organiza-\ntional aspects--tasks, processes, and relationships--to develop\nan in-depth understanding of group dynamics with respect to\nmembers'experiences and organizational development.\nIn Japan, RMs are established by local governments as a\nvenue for residents without professional knowledge to\nexchange opinions on welfare issues such as community\nwork, disabilities, child rearing, and the care of senior citi-\nzens. Local governments often use RMs to collect residents'\nopinions to launch municipal government action plans for\nwelfare policy. The explicit purpose of RM dialogue is to\nincorporate important aspects of the discussion into policy;\nhowever, only some of these important elements are success-\nfully integrated in relevant policies. Local officials are\nresponsible for determining which matters discussed in the\nRMs should be incorporated into policy. Beyond the explicit\npurpose of RMs, there is also an implicit purpose--provid-\ning RM members an opportunity to share their experiences\nwith each other and develop a sense of solidarity by regularly\nattending these meetings. Therefore, even though not all dis-\ncussions result in policy development, these RMs allow resi-\ndents opportunities to engage in meaningful interactions.\nAccording to the Cabinet Office of the Government of\npeople (nearly 6% of the total population) had physical or\nintellectual disabilities or mental disorders in 2012. This\nstudy applies the \"disability\" terminology used by the\nJapanese government. Over the past 20 years, the administra-\ntive role of Japan's municipal governments in disability pol-\nicy has been expanding (Ozawa & Ohshima, 2012). The\nJapanese central government has attempted to decrease the\nnumber of institutionalized PWDs and increase in-home sup-\nport services, respite care, and day care facilities to promote\nthe active participation of PWDs in the community (Ozawa\nGrassroots disability movements, such as the independent\nliving movement, philosophies of normalization, and desig-\nnation of 1981 as the International Year of Disabled Persons\n(United Nations, 1981), strongly influenced this policy. An\nimportant negotiation between PWDs and local governments\nbegan in the 1980s, when independent living became a goal\nof the Japanese government as an alternative to institutional\nliving for people with physical disabilities.

In 1960, Japan enacted an\nemployment quota system for PWDs under the People With\nDisabilities Employment Promotion Law (Japanese Law No.\ncompanies and 2.3% for statutory corporations, the central\ngovernment, and local governments. In 2013, the COGJ\n(2014b) reported that the employment rate of PWDs in pri-\nvate companies was approximately 1.76% of the total work-\nforce, which currently remains below the legal requirement\ndespite having steadily increased.\nOver time, public interest in the needs of PWDs has\nincreased. In a recent public survey on people's attitudes\ntoward PWDs, approximately 70% of the respondents\nreported that they have helped or talked to PWDs (COGJ,\n46.6% of respondents reported interacting with PWDs (Prime\ndents to the 2012 survey stated that prejudice or discrimina-\ntion exists against PWDs, which is slightly higher than that\nAn Action Plan for a Municipality-Level\nDisability Policy\nThe RMs investigated in this study were initially concerned\nwith an action plan for a municipal disability policy that the\nlocal government was legally obligated to develop. The\nDisabled Persons'Fundamental Law (Japanese Law No. 84),\namended in 2007, states that every municipal government in\nJapan must devise an action plan for disability policy. The\nServices and Support for Persons With Disabilities Act of\n2006 states that every municipal government must provide\nan action plan to develop systems that provide disability ser-\nvices to PWDs. The former deals broadly with disability\npolicy in a variety of fields, such as medical care and educa-\ntion, and it discusses a barrier-free urban development plan\nand improvements in public attitudes toward PWDs. The lat-\nter focuses on the timing for providing disability services,\nsuch as in-home support, day care, and respite care.\nWhen the Democratic Party of Japan came to power in\n2009, the Japanese government launched the Council for\nNational Disability Policy Reform (hereafter referred to as\n\"the Council\"; COGJ, 2009). The Council's main agenda\nwas to reform the 2006 Services and Support for Persons\nWith Disabilities Act to formulate an antidiscrimination act.\nThe Council was comprised of people with diverse disabili-\nties, academic professionals, disability service representa-\ntives, policy makers, and high-ranking officials. This Council\nrepresented a significant shift in governance because of its\ndiverse membership, and it met more than 20 times in 3\nyears. The Council proposed amendments to the Disabled\nPersons' Fundamental Law and Services and Support for\nPersons With Disabilities Act, and proposed legislation for\nthe antidiscrimination act (COGJ, 2009). However, proof of\nthe Council's influence at municipal-level meetings was\nlacking. In July 2012, after issuing the proposals, the Council\nwas disbanded, just months before the Liberal Democratic\nParty once again came to power.\nA municipal council (MC) for disability policy is an orga-\nnization tasked with developing an action plan for disability\npolicy and service provision at the municipal level. In general,\nMCs include academic professionals, welfare/health profes-\nsionals, representatives of public organizations, high-ranking\nmunicipal officials, and PWDs. In addition, opinions of local\nPWDs are collected through surveys and short public hearings\nheld for local disability organizations. According to the COGJ\nducted surveys and provided hearings, respectively.\nHowever, regarding action plans, there are no major or\nfrequent discussions among MC members or hearings pro-\nvided for local disability organizations (Tagaki, 2006). One\nreason for this may be that service providers and MC mem-\nbers belonging to disability organizations are often unaware\nof the practical problems within their organizations because\nthey occupy managerial positions, away from the service\nlocal disability organization members are PWDs, of which\n95% have physical disabilities. Ergo, another reason for the\nlack of discussions might be that people with intellectual dis-\nabilities or mental disorders comprise a very small propor-\ntion of the local organization membership.\nTagaki (2006) found that MC members with disabilities\nare often reluctant to discuss their personal interests regard-\ning disability or share their opinions about other types of\ndisability with other members. Furthermore, insufficient\ndiscussions across the types of disability might occur\nbecause the disability welfare system addresses three dis-\nability categories: physical, intellectual, and mental.\nPhysical disabilities encompass four categories: mobility,\nvisual, hearing and speech, and internal (e.g., heart disease,\nkidney disease, or other chronic debilitations). MC mem-\nbers have difficulty finding common ground across the dif-\nferent types of disability within this system. When they try\nto find common needs, they tend to be compelled to discuss\ntheir personal experiences in detail. However, Japanese\nsociety considers disabilities as private matters that should\nnot be discussed with people whose disabilities differ\n(Iwakuma, 2003). Therefore, MC members with disabilities\nmight be reluctant to share their experiences with each\nother. In addition, these behaviors of MC members may\nreflect the Japanese tradition of respecting harmony\n(Iwakuma, 2014) as valuing harmony encourages conflict\navoidance and agreement among members.\nRMs With Local Government\nRepresentatives\nSome municipal governments started holding regular RMs\non disability policy to hear opinions of and encourage par-\nticipation by PWDs in policy making. An RM consists of\nlocal officials, researchers, and nonprofessionals, such as\nPWDs, their families, and volunteer activists, selected by\nlocal governments. Unlike focus groups, which are imple-\nmented to collect opinions as data, RMs aim to listen to resi-\ndent opinions to prioritize those opinions and use them to\ndevelop agreements.\nTagaki (2007) studied a series of RMs held by a local gov-\nernment in a rural city in western Japan that spanned nearly\n2 years. While participating in the meetings, he employed an\naction research methodology (see Sugiman, 2006) and the\nsense-making theory (see Weick, 1995) to evaluate them--\nfocusing, in particular, on the problems discussed. Although\nlocal officials attended such meetings, they were reluctant to\nconduct them; therefore, medical doctors and academic pro-\nfessionals typically led the meetings. Many of the attendees\nhad disabilities. The main topics discussed were establishing\na newsletter, developing a website, creating a forum on dis-\nability issues in the city, and supporting employment oppor-\ntunities for PWDs.\nTagaki (2007) believed that using group dynamics and\ncommunity organization theories (Ross, 1955) improved the\nRMs and enhanced the process by which members partici-\npated in the RMs. Ross (1955) argued that three organiza-\ntional aspects are important to consider when researching a\ncommunity organization: task, process, and relationship.\nAfter analyzing the RMs based on those three aspects, Tagaki\n(2007) discovered that the goals of the meetings (e.g., estab-\nlishing a newsletter) were not accomplished because partici-\npation was lacking, meeting preparation was inadequate, and\nsupporting documentation was insufficient. Tagaki (2007)\npointed out that his role, as a researcher, was to understand\nthe members' discussions, whereas that of the members was\nto describe accurately their experiences. He further sug-\ngested that researchers in this field should focus on mem-\nbers' narratives regarding matters they believed should be\ndiscussed to provide local governmental officials with sug-\ngestions for disability policy.\nDespite Tagaki's (2007) contribution, additional RMs\nshould be analyzed to learn which issues are discussed and\nhow members address them. Such an analysis could help\nresolve problems that interfere with successful meetings,\nsuch as a reluctance to share personal experiences. Moreover,\nit is important to study meetings that convene regularly for 5\nor more years because the effective terms of basic action\nAction Research and Narrative\nIn addition to Ross's (1955) theory, the current study employs\nthe action research (Lewin, 1948) and sense-making theories\n(Weick, 1995), which were based on narrative theory to\ngroup dynamics in organizational development. Each theory\nis suitable for analyzing the results of fieldwork that includes\nintensive interaction between members and a researcher.\nSense-making theory is appropriate to examine member\ninvolvement in the RMs at behavioral or linguistic levels.\ngroup dynamics in organizational development, such as the\ndynamic relationship between leadership and prevention of\nhuman errors. Lewin influenced research on children's\ndevelopment and learning through expansion based on activ-\nity theory (e.g., Engestrom, 1987). This approach has been\napplied in studies on residents' participation in community\norganizations (Hanny & O'Connor, 2013) and health profes-\nsionals in local governments (Noro, 2012). These studies\nexamined the development of members' perceptions of their\nactivities as well as the outcome of their activities.\nAccordingly, I might argue that Ross's (1955) three organi-\nzational aspects are closely tied to Lewin's action research.\nThis type of action research has been used in Japan to\nlearn about individuals in communities using the sense-mak-\ning theory (Weick, 1995). Sense-making is a process by\nwhich people retrospectively give meaning to their experi-\nences through narratives. Weick (1995) developed the theory\nto analyze narratives in decision-making processes, such as\nthe problem-solving, judgment, or determination processes\nin organizations. Decision making is a product of the sense-\nmaking process because decisions are based on meanings.\nFor example, if an organizational member narrates that his\ndecision making led to a positive result, that narrative is the\nprocess of retrospectively giving meaning to the decision-\nmaking process. Weick was greatly influenced by Bruner's\n(1986) narrative theory--pointing out that organizational\nsense-making is a process that creates policy for future\nbehavior, rather than merely recalling past events or inter-\npreting experiences. Furthermore, sense-making is not an\nindividual's inner monologue, but rather a social dialogue\nthat develops in response to other's agreements or objections\nof action research using Weick's theory include investiga-\ntions of conflict among residents during the merger of two\nmunicipal governments (Higashimura, 2006) and the recon-\nstruction of disaster areas (Miyamoto, 2015). The sense-\nmaking theory is suitable for analyzing RMs in this study.\nIn the process of sense-making, people begin to notice\nself-evident norms or use explicit stories to explain what\nthey have implicitly understood (Sugiman, 2006). Instead of\nteaching PWDs the professional, academic knowledge,\naction research with sense-making teaches them how to\nmake sense of their, as well as other members', actions and\nopinions (Tagaki, 2007). Therefore, the sense-making theory\n4 SAGE Open\nis consistent with the current trend of using narrative analy-\nses in disability studies (Smith & Sparkes, 2008). Bruner\n(1986) proposed that people think paradigmatically to under-\nstand the so-called scientific truth and, through narratives, to\ndevelop meanings from their experiences. Although Bruner\nstated that these two ways of thinking are reciprocal, narra-\ntives focus on sense-making. In addition, disability narra-\ntives correspond to illness narratives (Kleinman, 1988),\nwhich relates to how the meanings of PWD differ from those\nof experts.\nMoreover, sense-making theory is useful for researcher\nreflections on his or her own position in a project. As men-\ntioned above, significant interactions occur between investi-\ngators and research participants in action research studies.\nOliver (1997) argued that, regardless of research design,\nresearchers are incapable of adopting a neutral stance--\nopposing the positivist paradigm that researchers can main-\ntain objectivity. In action research, the descriptions of\nfieldwork and the data analyses are influenced by (if not\nbased on) researchers' perspectives (Sugiman, 2006). This\nsuggests that researchers who use action research designs\nshould reflect on their personal values, as well as the roles\nexpected of them by their research participants. Researchers\nwho have used action research point out that some extent of\nmember involvement depends on the nature of the particular\nThis study's main objective was to understand the devel-\nopmental process of a particular series of RMs. These meet-\nings resolved some of the problems revealed by previous\nresearch, accomplished the three goals explained by Ross\n(1955), and spanned more than 5 years. The second objective\nwas to examine the extent to which participation in the meet-\nings changed the meeting members' perspectives or attitudes\ntoward themselves and other people regarding disabilities.\nFinally, the study examined the role and function of an action\nresearcher in the RMs.\nMethod\nContext\nYao City, Osaka, Japan.

The first-term action plan was\nimplemented based on the results of surveys of residents\nwith disabilities or their parents and a hearing for PWDs who\nwere members of Yao disability organizations. However, the\ndisability section of the Yao government was concerned that\ndiscussions at the Yao Council would privilege professional\nor organizational knowledge because of the composition of\nits membership and its results would not reflect the opinions\nof residents with disabilities.\nEstablishment of RMs on disability issues. The second-term Yao\naction plan was discussed at the Yao Council (Yao City,\nthe Yao Council that RMs be held to solve the disability\nissues and collect opinions from PWDs, welfare practitio-\nners, and volunteer activists (Yao City, 2003). The section\nexplained that the meetings would also help members and\nlocal officials avoid mutual criticism, arrive at compromises,\nand avoid PWD overdependence on the public sector. The\nYao Council agreed and suggested launching a series of\naddition, the members annually held a citizen's forum on dis-\nability issues with the Yao government and welfare organiza-\ntions that did not attend RMs.\nAlthough the stated purpose of the RM was initially lim-\nited to drafting a disability policy to be inserted into the sec-\nond-term action plan (which began in 2003), the meeting\nmembers wanted the meetings to continue from FY 2003\nonward to promote opinion-changing dialogue. Hence, the\nRM became a subordinate organization to the Yao Council.\nRMs for 15 years. During this time, the RM has dealt with\nvarious disability issues such as employment, public aware-\nness of PWDs, and accessibility on public roads. I have been\ninvolved since the first meeting in 2002. The total number of\nmembers is currently 25, with a membership term of 1 year,\nalthough members can be reappointed. Members include\nindividuals with physical disabilities, mild intellectual dis-\nabilities, or mental disorders in remission; the families of\nPWDs; and the members of a sign language club. With my\nexception, none of the members has concurrently held a post\non the Yao Council (I became a member of the council in\nApril 2002). In this study, I analyzed the development of the\nond-term action plan for the disability policy.\nData Collection: Participant Observation and\nFocus Group Interviews\nMy continuing participation in the meetings made me realize\ntheir importance and, in 2003, I determined that they were\nsuitable subjects for an action research project. Because my\ninterest in the meetings grew gradually, I cannot specify the\nexact start date of this study. Yamori (2010) stated that it is\nnot always possible to identify the beginning and end dates\nof action research projects.\nThe data used in this study include field notes, handouts,\nemails, transcripts of RM proceedings, and focus group inter-\nview data. In my field notes, I wrote down progress of RMs, key\nmembers'statements, member discussions, my own reflections,\nand member reactions. I lived in a city that is approximately 30\nkm by train fromYao city.Yao city officials requested my active\ninvolvement in the Yao Council and the RMs as an advisor.\nPerhaps they thought I should fill two roles: first, as an aca-\ndemic professional, I would chair meetings and not interact with\ndisability organizations; and, second, as a person with a physical\ndisability, the officials thought I would be welcomed by RM\nmembers. My physical disability enabled me to express solidar-\nity with RM members and avoid common criticisms--directed\nat academic professionals in similar contexts (Tagaki, 2006)\nYao city officials might expect me to give advice that was based\non my personal experience as well as academic knowledge.\nwhich made me younger than most researchers in senior\npositions at Japanese universities (Lebra, 2004). The Yao\ncity officials probably thought that my youthfulness would\npromote a friendly atmosphere that might encourage open\ndiscussions among the members.\nIn addition to attending the meetings, I conducted two\nfocus groups in the fall of 2007 with six key members of the\nRM who had actively managed the meetings. Three of them\nhad mobility or visual disabilities, two were supporters of Yao\ncity residents with hearing loss, and one person was a psychi-\natric social worker. I conducted the focus group interviews in\na conference room in Yao city; however, no Yao official\nattended them. Before each interview, I thoroughly explained\nthe study's research objectives and privacy policy, which was\nto preserve carefully the data and use pseudonyms for all par-\nticipants in all publications. In addition, I provided members\nwith written explanations, although they all seemed to under-\nstand my oral explanation. I emphasized that they could\nrefuse to participate whenever they wanted for any reason,\nand they could leave the interview at any time. Each focus\ngroup spanned about 2 hr, and the interviews were audio\nrecorded with the members' permission. The ethics commit-\ntee of the relevant university approved the study protocol.\nIn the focus group interviews, I asked members to describe\nthey led the meetings, and their understanding of Yao city\nofficials'roles. Furthermore, I asked them to elaborate on the\nopinion that PWDs should do as much as they can by them-\nselves without depending on the public sector. In the second\nfocus group, I asked the members to elaborate on the main\ntopics discussed in the first focus group and the RM's limita-\ntions. Before submission, I asked Yao officials and some key\nmembers of the RM to review the draft and requested that all\nfocus group members check the descriptions and quotations\nof the focus group results via email or telephone.\nData Analysis\nThe analysis of the meeting process was based on written\nresources, such as handouts delivered by Yao city officials,\nmy emails with the officials, and my field notes. Records of\nmy interventions in all the processes were extracted from the\nsources, following which the meeting process clarified my\ninvolvement. Regarding focus group interviews, I employed\n\"the KJ method,\" a kind of bottom-up qualitative method\nthat was developed by a Japanese ethnologist, Jiro Kawakita\n(1967). He adapted this method from Charles S. Peirce's\nnotion of abduction, which relies on intuitive thinking pro-\ncesses to identify explanatory hypotheses (Scupin, 1997).\nThe KJ method contains some general steps: reading tran-\nscripts carefully, extracting quotations from the transcripts,\nassigning a code (a summary label or index) to each quota-\ntion, developing categories by grouping codes, and summa-\nrizing categories and relationships among them.\nI applied this standard procedure of the KJ method. First,\nI carefully reviewed the transcripts to gain an overall sense\nof the focus groups. Second, I linked 138 codes to 147 quota-\ntions extracted from the transcripts, as some quotations were\nassigned the same code. The quotations were each three or\nfour sentences long. Third, I provisionally grouped and orga-\nnized the coded quotations and summarized them into about\n20 groups, which described, for example, mutual respect\namong the members, dialogue with the officials, or the meet-\nings' proceedings. Finally, from these groups, I developed\nmain categories, which are described in the section of\n\"Results of the Focus Group Interviews\".\nNochi (2013) suggested that there are similarities between\nthe KJ method and grounded theory methodology (Glaser &\nStrauss, 1967). Both develop connections among categories\nusing codes generated from segmented text data. However,\nthere are some differences between them. The goal of the\ngrounded theory methodology is to logically develop and\nintegrate categories into a theory, whereas that of the KJ\nmethod is to create new connections between ideas or con-\ncepts that could create contradictory or illogical categories.\nNochi suggested that the KJ method is suitable for analyzing\nself-narratives because narratives tend to include many con-\ntradictions or inconsistencies. Unique to Japan, this is a pop-\nular qualitative analytical method in many fields, including\ndevelopmental psychology (Sato, Hidaka, & Fukuda, 2009;\nTagaki, 2015) and gerontology (Fukui, Okada, Nishimoto, &\nResults of the Meeting Processes\nFirst, I provide a brief description of my remarks to the meet-\ning members. Second, I present the RM process as three\nphases across time (Table 1): the initiatives of Yao city offi-\ncials and leading residents, collaborations among the officials\nand other members of the RM, and results and conclusions\n(comprising the last year of the effective period of the\n6 SAGE Open\nsecond-term action plan for the disability policy), which are\nbased on the agenda and key meeting leaders. The Yao city\ngovernment structured the meetings by FY. In the first phase,\nthe officials chairing the meetings developed an agenda and\nprovided it to me in advance. In the second phase, they created\nindividual meeting scenarios and asked key RM members to\ninitiate discussions. The third phase encompassed reflections\nand conclusions about the effects of these meetings on disabil-\nity issues. Following the description of these phases, I present\nthe main categories of the focus group interview data.\nOver this 6-year period, the RM has accomplished the fol-\nlowing tasks and goals: managing the annual citizen forum,\nselecting equipment and events for the city center for PWDs,\nimproving pedestrian accessibility on sidewalks by address-\ning the issue of illegally parked bicycles, using products\nmade in sheltered workshops to promote employment of\nPWDs, and increasing a community's awareness of PWDs.\nIn addition to these concrete issues, the RM members deep-\nened their mutual understanding of disability-related issues,\ntook on leadership roles in the meetings, and participated in\ndisability-related activities.\nMy Role as a Researcher\nAt the request of Yao city officials, I acted as an RM advisor\nand coordinator. I believed that RMs carried potential for\ndeveloping collaborative solutions for disability issues\nbetween municipal governments and the residents. I consid-\nered my interactions with PWDs to be important to my previ-\nous research, which focused on the psychosocial issues\nrelated to disabilities.\nThe Yao city officials did not provide clear guidance\nregarding what I should do or what types of policies they\nwanted to implement. In the beginning, my role seemed to\ninclude promoting opinion exchanges among members,\norganizing the expressed opinions, and emphasizing the\nmembers' power as laypersons. First, I asked all the mem-\nbers to respect the disabilities and opinions of others because\nthere were numerous types of disabilities among them. Due\nto this diversity, I expected it to be difficult to reach simple\nagreements. I suggested that, when the members wanted to\ngive more than one statement, they should first listen care-\nfully at least once to another opinion. I reiterated that their\nopinions as laypersons with disabilities were more important\nthan the ideas presented by the experts and officials. This\nwas intended to help the members feel free to share their\nopinions. These suggestions seemed to be accepted by the\nmembers during discussions. Through my emphasis on the\nvalue of their opinions, I tried to communicate to them that\nself-reliance was better than excessive dependency on the\nmunicipal government, which was an explicit goal of the\nRM. While some of them supported this idea, others might\nhave thought that it reflected the intentions of the Yao city\ngovernment, which could have been interested in decreasing\ntheir disability benefits.\nOverall, I believe that I was regarded as a key member of\nthe RM. The meetings were often conveniently held with my\nschedule in mind. Sometimes, members showed solidarity\nwith me as a person with a disability, and they often respected\nmy suggestions. However, some members regarded me as an\nassociate of the Yao city government, while others regarded\nme as someone unfamiliar with the city's local affairs.\nInitiatives of the Yao City Officials and Leading\nResidents\nan action plan on disability policy that focused on the resi-\ndents' initiatives. They attempted to identify problems and\nsolutions and determine the roles of the municipal govern-\nment and PWDs. In this phase, organizing the members was\nsified the members based on their type of disability (physical,\nhearing loss, intellectual, or mental) and volunteer activist\nstatus. This classification encouraged discussions and conver-\nsations because the members were asked to introduce them-\nselves, write about their disability issues, and share their\npersonal experiences and solutions with each other.\nDuring this process, the members began to understand their\nproblems or needs and, consequently, increased their respect for\nothers' opinions. For example, people with mobility or visual\ndisabilities listened carefully to the remarks of persons with\nhearing loss, mental disorders, or intellectual disabilities, and\nsometimes spoke particularly slowly to them. Similarly, mem-\nbers paid more attention to sign language translators. Moreover,\nsome members recognized the variation in disabilities within\nthe groups. For example, people with physical disabilities (the\ngroup in which I participated) included a woman with a visual\nNumber of Meetings per FY in Parentheses.\nInitiatives of Yao city officials and leading residents\n2002 (5) Proposal regarding Yao action plan for disability\npolicy\nCollaborations among officials and other members of the RMs\n2004 (6) Issues of PWDs in securing engagement in the\ncommunity\nillegally parked bicycles\nregular employment, and community disability\nawareness programs\nResults and conclusions\n2007 (8) Summaries, reflections, and conclusions on meeting\ndevelopment\nNote.

These individuals shared\ntheir personal struggles, such as those in terms of overcoming\nstructural barriers, learning Braille, and experiencing dialysis\ntreatments. Because of the variety of disabilities in the group, it\nwas difficult to reach consensus on any policy change.\nThe members concluded the last meeting of 2002, by dis-\ncussing the year's results. Many members mentioned the\nimportance of having people with diverse disabilities come\ntogether, and they wanted to continue the meetings despite\nthe challenges faced in exchanging opinions. Although many\nof their ideas were added to the action plan, some were not.\nFor example, although the idea of having a 24-hr emergency\nsupport system for people with mental disorders was sup-\nported by some members, it was not included. The members\nreported their opinions at the citizens' forum.\nFY 2003. Along with Yao city officials and some of the lead-\ning members, I decided to participate in the RM for the sec-\nond-term action plan. In the first meeting, some members\nexpressed concern that it was difficult for them to develop an\nagenda suitable to the RM. One member pointed out that\nintense discussion would be meaningless if the officials did\nnot formulate them into a policy, suggesting the limitations\nof the RM. Subsequently, the officials and members chose to\ndiscuss a new city center for PWDs, the types of equipment\nthat would be needed in such a center, and the types of events\nthat could be held there.\nIn the last meeting of 2003, the members discussed the\nresults of the year's meetings. Some members suggested that\nwe should create an enterprise, rather than merely talking\nabout things. Furthermore, the members suggested that the\nmeetings should be structured by establishing an agenda,\nassigning leaders, and keeping a written record.\nCollaborations Between the Officials and Leading\norganized a task force comprised of residents, officials, and\nmyself. The goal of the task force was to set up agendas in\nadvance of the coming year's meetings and assign a person\nto lead the meetings. The key members of the task force were\na man with a spinal cord injury (Mr. A), a woman with a\nvisual disability (Ms. B), a person with a mental disorder,\nand some able-bodied volunteers and activists.\nMs. B explained the purpose of the RM to the other task\nforce members and the meeting at large, stating, \"I strongly\nask you to realize that this meeting is an opportunity not for\nyou to make demands of the Yao government but to express\nideas that the members can carry out on their own.\" She\nseemed to want to prevent the meetings from developing into\nnegotiations between officials and disability activists. After\ncareful deliberations, the task force decided to classify the\nRM members without considering their disabilities.\nAfter the first RM, the task force members, officials, and\nI decided to add to the agenda the problems faced by PWDs\nin integrating themselves into the community. In addition, at\nthe fifth meeting of 2004, the members decided to start a\ncampaign to prevent the illegal parking of bicycles on side-\nwalk and implement security sweeps of public buildings\n(scheduled to begin after 2004), such as railway stations,\nbecause illegally parked bicycles were creating dangerous\nobstacles for the PWDs, particularly sight-impaired or\nwheelchair-bound individuals. As described in the following\nsection, the proposal regarding bicycle parking was accepted\nby the Yao government.\nFY 2005. The task force members suggested that the employ-\nment problems, illegally parked bicycles, and a disability\nawareness campaign should be covered in the 2005 meeting\nagenda. At the first RM, members agreed that the first two\nconcerns would be included in the agenda. We learned at the\nmeeting that the members were unaware of any employment\nprograms within the Yao city government, the quota system,\nor the equal opportunity policy within Japan; these programs\nand policies encompassed the informational categories that\nPWDs need to improve their employment opportunities.\nIn spring 2005, some members submitted a draft on the\nbicycle problem to Yao city to apply for an official grant pro-\nmoting a community-based welfare program for PWDs in\nthe city. The city accepted the proposal. Even though the RM\ndid not officially approve the draft and its associated cam-\npaign, these members produced a result that originated from\nRM discussions.\nAt the last meeting of 2005, the members discussed pos-\nsible reasons for not finding an effective solution to the\nemployment problem. One opinion was that only a few RM\nmembers had employment experience. The officials and I\nnoticed some positive changes in the members that accompa-\nnied the RM developmental changes. For example, one\nmember with a mental disorder who always came accompa-\nnied by a social worker participated in some discussions\nwhen he was not accompanied. Another member, with a\nphysical disability, who had emphasized during the first\nphase that the government should take responsibility even\nfor personal disabilities, stated that PWDs should attempt to\nresolve their issues without government support.\nand second meetings to address an activity at a sheltered\nworkshop for PWDs as well as an employment and disability\nawareness program in the community. At the first RM, the\nmembers learned about a sheltered workshop from guest\nspeakers, who had been trained to bake goods at the work-\nshop. The members suggested that they could deliver baked\ngoods made at the workshop to elders living in a welfare\nfacility. They thought that this service was an example of the\nimprovements in the sales of goods produced in workshops.2\nAfter the first meeting, some of the RM members served as\n8 SAGE Open\nintermediaries between a sheltered workshop and a welfare\nfacility for elders to promote the delivery of goods.\nAt the second meeting, the members discussed the fact\nthat the job skills required by PWDs were not clearly\ndefined, and, in addition, they considered the types of jobs\nthat PWDs could perform. Some members stated that hav-\ning a coordinator to mediate between a person with disabili-\nties and his or her employer would be beneficial. Many\nmembers emphasized that PWDs should stress their\nstrengths instead of their limitations. One member sug-\ngested that PWDs could consult enterprises regarding the\nconstruction of barrier-free buildings and disability aware-\nness educational programs, or they could be customer ser-\nvice representatives specifically for PWDs.\nMr. C, who had previously worked for a large company\nand sustained a physical disability, told the members that the\nunique strengths of PWDs are not broadly suitable to the\nlabor market and private enterprises do not want to employ\nPWDs. As I listened, I felt concerned that his emphasis on\nemployers' perspectives might discourage other members.\nOur conversation3 is as follows:\nMr. C: Truly, a private company is legally required to\nemploy PWD as a certain percentage of all employees.\nBut, the real situation is that it does not want to employ\neven one person with a disability. . . . PWD have to\nknow what an employer needs; otherwise, any support\nplans for employment would turn out to be nothing but\npie in the sky.\nMe: I asked you to share your opinion after all the mem-\nbers had each expressed their opinions. It sounds rea-\nsonable that the situation of a company is different\nfrom that of a person with disabilities. Would you\nshare your long-term work experience later?\nMr. C: I understand.\nAt the sixth meeting, we deliberated on disability aware-\nness programs in the community. At the seventh meeting, I\nproposed that we deliberate on the targets or effects of such\nprograms. Ms. B. argued that it is difficult to focus on the\ntargets or examine the programs' effects:\nMs. B: Professor [me] pointed out the effectiveness of the\ndisability awareness program, but we cannot start the\nprogram if we still have to consider it. We held the pro-\ngram for students at school, and we know that even\nthough we sowed 100 seeds, one or two of them would\nsprout up.\nMe: I do not mean effectiveness; rather, I mean that we\nhave to clarify what is understood and what is not.\nMs. B: [It is impossible for us to put a line between them].\nLet me refute. I guess that this is something that stu-\ndents learn about in some way [from the program].\nThis is quite different from a professional lecture at a\nuniversity.\nThe main result of the 2006 meetings was our decision to\ncontinue the regular delivery of baked goods to the welfare\nfacility for elders. Although the members of the RM did not\ndefine elders as PWD, this activity could be interpreted as\ntheir effort to bridge the welfare services for PWDs and those\nfor elders.\nAt the 2007 meetings, we summarized the development of\nthe meetings over the previous 5 years. At the fifth meeting\nof 2007, members stressed the need to strengthen relation-\nships in the RM across disabilities and continue campaigning\nto prevent the illegal parking of bicycles. Some of the mem-\nbers voiced the concern that the meetings had not represented\nor assisted the PWDs who were not in attendance and the\ntask force shouldered too heavy a burden. The members\nreached a consensus that the RM should continue after 2007,\nthat they should have more control of the meetings, and that\nthe Yao city officials should have less control. I asked them\nwhether they would go ahead with the meetings on their\nown, stressing my belief that their personal initiative was of\ngreater importance than that of the Yao Council members,\nwho did not fully understand the situations discussed at the\nRM. The officials and I reported the decision to the 2007 Yao\nCouncil meeting and received approval to continue the RM\nfrom 2008 onward without any objections.\nResults of the Focus Group Interviews\nThe data from the focus group interviews were developed\ninto four broad categories using the KJ method: (a) inter-\nviewees' understanding of disabilities, (b) dialogues with\nYao city officials, (c) difficulty in setting up agendas that\nwere interesting and relevant to all the members, and (d)\nadvantages of the RM compared with the Yao Council.\nInterviewees' Understanding of Disabilities\nThe focus group interviewees stated that the RM lasted 6\nyears because the members mutually respected each other's\nopinions. Some of them pointed out that they had initially\njoined the RM only to express their personal needs. Ms. D, a\nmember of a small support group for people with hearing\ndisabilities, stated that she had perceived the RM as an\nopportunity to highlight the concerns of her group.\nHowever, as the RM progressed, the members became\nless focused on the interests of particular groups, began to\nappreciate the people with various disabilities who had gath-\nered, and became eager to take advantage of the valuable\nopportunity. The project aiming to prevent the illegal parking\nof bicycles unified the entire membership. The interviewees\nstated that if they wanted officials to consider their expressed\nissues as credible, they needed to highlight the commonali-\nties among all PWDs.\nSome interviewees pointed out that the members who\nwere responsive to other members were those who were\nlikely to continue participating in the RM. Ms. B mentioned\npeople with visual disabilities becoming involved in issues\nrelated to those with intellectual disabilities. The members'\nnarratives in the focus group interviews are illustrated as\nfollows:\nMs. B: If a person with [a] visual disability thought he\nhad nothing in common with the issues of intellec-\ntual disabilities, he could not go to a nursing institu-\ntion for elders to sell bakery goods made by people\nwith intellectual disabilities. I am sure that the staff\nat the institution was surprised to see me. It is quite\nirregular.\nDialogues With Yao City Officials\nThe interviewees stated that they tried to avoid confronta-\ntions with officials and disregarded what they perceived as\nunrealistic, one-sided demands made by the officials\nbecause they believed that a disability policy exclusively\ndeveloped by officials would either be incomplete or even-\ntually become useless. They were pleased that the officials\ngave them space to freely express their opinions. One\ninterviewee pointed out that the officials and members\nattempted to understand each other's importance in the\nprocess and they realized that it was necessary for the offi-\ncials to participate in the meetings. They stated that if the\nofficials were to stop participating, the collaboration they\nhad established would become worthless. Mr. F pointed\nout as follows:\nMr. F: The local governments' involvement helps us to\npersuade public organizations, such as a company or\nan administrative organization. They cannot help lis-\ntening to our requests. Because of the presence of the\ngovernment in the meeting, the persuasion is not a per-\nsonal activity, but a public one.\nDifficulty in Setting Up Agendas That Were\nInteresting and Relevant to All Members\nThe interviewees told me that they had carefully devel-\noped agendas of interest to all members; to this end, they\nhad actively avoided putting a national disability policy\non the agenda. No practical solution to such a concern\ncould be developed at a municipal-level meeting. Instead,\nthey aimed for small and practical issues that the local\ngovernment had not yet addressed. The Yao city officials\nstated that they knew little of many salient issues. Mr. F\nremarked, \"Because we discuss realistic methods, the\nmembers in the discussion can be enthusiastic about\nbecoming involved in the project and can propose alterna-\ntive methods.\"\nAdvantages of the RM Compared With the Yao\nCouncil\nThe interviewees emphasized their beliefs that they were\nmore valuable than the members of the Yao Council because\ntheir discussions were based on experience, rather than\nabstract ideas. They valued their freedom to share their expe-\nriences easily without considering disability organizations'\ninterests because they participated in the meetings as indi-\nviduals with disabilities, instead of organizational represen-\ntatives. The interviewees stated that, initially, they did not\nknow the original purpose of the RM or understand the dis-\nability action plan; however, they gradually understood the\nadvantages of the RM compared with the Yao Council. For\nexample, Mr. A stated that although he had been invited to\nattend the meetings by officials, he did not know their pur-\npose. However, the interviewees pointed out that, as the RM\nprogressed, there were several noteworthy changes among\nthe members. Some members began to understand each other\nbetter after attending several meetings. Some of the inter-\nviewees were unsure about the advantages, stating that it was\ndifficult to evaluate the Yao disability policy. In addition,\nthey pointed out that they could not do what they actually\nwanted to do, but had to go along with the consensus. For\nexample, they could not educate companies about disabili-\nties, learn about the skills sought by such companies, or help\nPWDs obtain these skills.\nDiscussion\nAccomplishment of Task Goal\nWe could conclude that the RM accomplished its task goals\nbecause members obtained concrete results from their active\ninvolvement in the management of annual citizen forums on\ndisability issues, the selection of equipment and events of a city\ncenter for PWDs, the development of the campaign to increase\npedestrian accessibility by cracking down on illegally parked\nbicycles, utilization of products made in a sheltered workshop\nto promote employment for PWDs, and development of com-\nmunity awareness of PWDs. One could certainly argue that the\ncurrent RM was more successful than Tagaki's RM in 2007.\nAlthough there are similar city center facilities in Japan, it is\nrare that residents with disabilities take part in selection of cen-\nter events--Typically local government officials or center staff\nare responsible for this selection. Illegal parking on sidewalks\nwas a major problem for accessibility in public transit facilities,\nlike railway stations or bus stops, or entrances to stores. Even\nthough some municipal governments regulate bicycle parking\naround transit facilities, the problem persists (Chosokabe,\nTakeyoshi, & Sakakibara, 2015). In the current campaign,\nPWDs appeal to residents as illegally parked bicycles create\nproblems for everyone, not PWDs alone. Through their\ninvolvement in the bicycle project, residents without disabili-\nties gained a better understanding of disability issues. To pro-\nmote public awareness of disability issues, the members edited\ncontents of a booklet and presented lectures on it by them-\nselves. This educational format may be more appealing for\naudiences compared with other disability awareness activities\nmanaged by disability professionals or academics.\nUtilization of products of a sheltered workshop is a pio-\nneering achievement. Marketing these workshop products\nwas one of major issues in disability employment. In fact,\nmany solutions had already been attempted--like consultant\nparticipation in workshop management with social welfare\nprofessionals or selling the products in a corner of large com-\nmercial or public facilities (Toyama, 2017). The Act on\nPriority Procurement Promotion for Persons With Disabilities\npublic organizations like the central and municipal govern-\nments to promote priority purchase from facilities for PWDs,\nwhen procuring goods or services. Nevertheless, this Act did\nnot encourage similar purchases by welfare organizations for\nthe elderly or nursery homes, even though most welfare facil-\nities legally and financially are under jurisdiction of MHLW.\nAccomplishment of Process Goal and Interaction\nAmong the Members\nEmphasis on member disability diversity.We could conclude\nthat the RM partially accomplished its process goal, as--\nbased on my fieldwork and the analysis of the focus group\ninterviews--all members seemed to be very aware of their\ndiversity. Some scholars have suggested a hierarchy of dis-\npositions, meaning that other PWDs consider an individual\nwith a particular disability as a person who sustains \"real\"\ndisability. A hierarchy would likely be an obstacle to achiev-\ning collaboration or solidarity among the members of the\nRM; however, I did not observe this phenomenon. People\nwith physical disabilities seemed to pay equal attention to\nthose who had difficulty speaking due to intellectual or men-\ntal disabilities. These members talked slowly, and the others\nseemed to listen to their opinions. Iwakuma (2014) pointed\nout that the culture of respecting \"harmony\" could prevent\nPWDs from active discussion in a council in Japan. How-\never, RM members might interpret talking about their own\nexperiences and listening to others' as respecting harmony in\nthe meeting. In this sense, one could argue that valuing har-\nmony might prevent the member from remaining silent and,\ninstead, encourage active and respectful discussion among\nthe members. Furthermore, after 2004, RM members were\nno longer categorized by disability, which may have contrib-\nuted to changes in their perceptions or attitudes.\nIn the interviews, members pointed out that as time passed\nthey began to recognize common needs and opinions when\nlistening to others. Perhaps they began to understand the\nvalue of presenting their common needs to people without\ndisabilities who are unfamiliar with disability issues,\nalthough there was no consensus on the matter. National or\nmunicipal disability movements tend to focus on specific\nmight be more successful if they were based on common\nneeds. The RM members valued the meetings where differ-\nent people came together, and they expressed concerns that\nthe RM would not be sustainable if the members spoke from\nwere mostly about issues common to all the members.\nDevelopment of disability identities. A concrete achievement of\nthe RM was the utilization of sheltered workshop products,\nwhich developed an environment where members could\nestablish their disability identities (Gill, 1997). A disability\nidentity can be more empowering than a general social iden-\ntity. Discussion of disability policy is a tool that encouraged\nmembers to find relationships between their personal experi-\nences and the local disability policy as the exchange of these\nexperiences could lead to alternative dialogues on disability\nissues. A typical example is the employment issue included\nsocial perceptions that they do not have requisite abilities for\nthe labor market. Some believe that the Services and Support\nfor Persons With Disabilities Act of 2006 was proposed\nexclusively for PWDs for employment or vocational training\npurposes (Ozawa & Ohshima, 2012). Nevertheless, some\nmembers stated that they should view their disability experi-\nences as a strength when seeking employment. PWDs seem\nto share a perception that refutes the dominant ideas able-\nbodied people have regarding PWD employment. As such,\nRM members seemed to embrace a common experience of\ndisability and sense of belonging to the disability community\nbeyond their differences.\nMilner and Kelly (2009) suggested that PWDs need\nplaces like the RM for community life. In Japan, through\nsome financial support of municipal governments, disability\norganizations held \"peer counseling\" practices where PWDs\nare encouraged to talk actively about their disability-related\nexperiences (Sadato, 1994). However, not only are these\ngroups rare, but they are also typically short-lived and their\nmembers lack diversity. Iwakuma (2003) found that people\nwho talk about their personal disability challenges might be\nperceived as self-involved in places where people without\ndisabilities gather. At the RMs, members had no need to\nworry about this and were able to talk comfortably about\ntheir experiences. Gearty (2015) proposed that action\nresearch about organizational members creates new narra-\ntives for the members. In this sense, the current action\nresearch study helped the RM to engage the disability com-\nmunity despite its initial official and solitary goal of discuss-\ning the municipal disability policy.\nIt is important to point out the differences and disagree-\nments among the members. Mr. C's remarks about employ-\ners' perspectives brought to light the differences in\nperspectives between those with and those without employ-\nment experience. The RM atmosphere became tense after\nhis remarks. According to Kobayashi (2004), members in\nconsensus meetings (regarding environmental and food\nsafety issues) should be aware that disagreements among\nmembers are unavoidable. Although Kobayashi's findings\nmight not perfectly fit this study, it is important to recognize\nthe need to \"agree to disagree\" in the context of disability\nissues. A member with a disability cannot insist that his or\nher remarks are more legitimate than those of other mem-\nbers with different disabilities.\nManagement of the RM by the Members, Yao\nCity Officials, and a Researcher\nRole of the members and Yao city officials. Many different peo-\nple led the RMs--Residents, local officials, and I all served\nin this capacity, and we all considered our roles and limita-\ntions. This current RM seems better managed by all the\nmembers than the RM in Tagaki's (2007) study. Although\nthe residents became increasingly active in the RMs, local\nofficials and I filled the primary role of facilitating discus-\nsions. Member participation in and contributions to the RMs\nwere noteworthy. For example, one task force member\nfocused on the RM management policy. Another example\nincludes members' responses to Ms. B, stating that she\nshould discuss practical issues rather than theoretical mat-\nters, and that her remarks were not useful to policy change.\nThese discussions enabled members to avoid focusing on\ntheir personal concerns, respect the needs and opinions of\nothers as individuals, and consider the group in its entirety.\nLocal officials might consider the RM discussions as sig-\nnificant. In the personnel allocation system of Japanese public\nofficials, local government officials transfer from one section\nto another every 4 to 5 years, except for staff employed as\nsocial welfare professionals. For this reason, local government\nofficials often do not have the opportunity to become intimately\nfamiliar with disability policy matters (Kurihara, 2007). For the\nRMs, the local officials played an important role--setting the\nagenda and supporting the meeting chair--which helped mem-\nbers better understand the relationships between the discus-\nsions and policy. The Yao Council members regarded these\ndiscussions as useful political recommendations.\nThe local officials recognize their administrative limita-\ntions with regard to incorporating RM suggestions into policy.\nIn Japan, due to the decentralization of power, municipal gov-\nernment's ability to exert their own discretion with regard to\nsocial welfare policy has been increasing since the 1990s (Ito,\n2012). However, municipal governments have little adminis-\ntrative discretion to decide the content of welfare policy and\ntheir own budget; in fact, municipal governments are required\nto emphasize the intentions of prefectures and central govern-\nment. Even so, the attendance of the government officials at\nthe RMs is regarded favorably in part because the RM mem-\nbers' discussion is easily transferrable to the Yao government.\nIn addition, their attendance fulfills the \"public responsibility\"\nstandard emphasized in Japan that pushes central or local gov-\nernments to take initiative on disability policy (Kim, 2014).\nMy role as a researcher. I attempted to manage several aspects\nof the RMs, including membership, clarifying members'\nroles, prioritizing meeting agendas, developing behavior\npolicies during discussions (such as refraining from criti-\ncism), emphasizing that each member's experiences were\nknowledge based, promoting the value of meetings, and\nhelping to find solutions to the problems identified in the\nmeetings without depending on the government. Based on\nthe sense-making theory, I intended my remarks to shed light\non the members' sense-making of their experiences as\nPWDs. I did not present professional truths or offer solutions\nfor the members to implement.\nI asked the RM members to explain their values or norms\nof which other RM members might not be aware. In particu-\nlar, I tried to clarify the significance of the members' com-\nments and emphasized that documenting the meetings was\nimportant because sense-making is prominently performed\nin narratives. Documentation is important for arranging nar-\nratives through discussion and encouraging the members'\ninterpretations of the RM. By documenting the meetings,\nresidents who were absent catch up on what happened.\nAccordingly, my role in this action research study can be\nunderstood as sense-making, rather than decision making.\nI was uniquely aware that I was limited by my lack of Yao\ncity residency and, thus, had no official way of implementing\nthe members' suggestions. Furthermore, social scientists\nrarely have strong influences on disability policy in Japan's\ncentral or municipal governments, particularly compared with\ngovernmental officials (Mizumoto, 2009).Arevolving door of\npersonnel through which researchers travel and transition\namong universities, institutions, and policy making are\nunusual in Japan's central and local governments (Ishii, 2010).\nPerhaps if more researchers were involved in disability stud-\nies, their influence would increase and lead to positive changes\nto the current disability policy in Japan (Barnes, 2011). In this\ncase, because Ms. B did not completely agree with my sugges-\ntion on the target or effects of a disability awareness program\nin the 2006 meeting, my advice as a researcher was not\naccepted by the RM members. Nevertheless, the sense-mak-\ning of the narratives of the RM members might be a small step\ntoward a positive change.\nConclusion\nAn RM is an effective way for PWDs to participate in local\npolicy-making processes. The following are some sugges-\ntions, which municipal governments should apply when\nmanaging RMs. First, respect for diversity is required and,\nonce it is established, common interests will emerge. If\nmember categorization is based on disability type, they will\nlikely have strong within-group affinities. Under these con-\nditions, discussions may be too specific to disability type,\nand cross-group relationships could be undermined.\nOrganizing members without considering the disability type\nallows them to find new common ground. Respect for\ndiversity does not mean enforced agreements. Members\ncould agree to disagree and subsequently find a common\nground on which to appeal to the local government.\nSecond, as Yanai and Nakayama (2015) pointed out, a\nvenue for sharing experiences is important, even if there is a\nspecific project in mind for the experience sharing. The RM\naccomplished three concrete projects, but perhaps more\nimportantly, the members actively shared their experiences\nwith each other. The current RM did not reflect the opinions\nof all the PWDs in Yao. Nevertheless, it is important to accu-\nmulate and generate collective narratives on local disability\npolicy.As McDaid (2009) and Mirza, Gossett, Chan, Burford,\nand Hammel (2008) insisted, a disability service provision\nsystem should respect experience-based knowledge. Initially,\npolicy evaluation can be applied to retrospectively under-\nstand its past effects. For example, in the context of restoring\na Japanese town damaged by a catastrophe, Miyamoto and\nAtsumi (2009) emphasized the importance of the narrative\nway of thinking. Their discussion is reflected in this study,\nwhich also deals with residents facing community problems.\nThe third suggestion is that the meetings should be man-\naged by multiple leaders to encourage the participation of all\nmembers. In this study, local officials, key residents, and I\ncollectively coordinated the RM.\nIt is important to note the limitations of the RM. As one\nmember with an internal disability remarked in 2003, it ran\nthe risk that deep discussions would be useless if the officials\ndid not value them. One goal of the RM has been to help\nmembers understand their responsibilities toward themselves\nand not become overly dependent on the government. If this\ngoal is misunderstood, the legitimate responsibilities of the\npublic sector could be underestimated. I suggest that the RM\nis a means of enacting the disability policy. Certainly, lobby-\ning high-ranking officials or Congress members is effective\nfor prompt policy making.\nFurther studies are required on this topic. First, the RM\ndid not fulfill its relationship goal because it did not involve\nable-bodied people unrelated to policy making or disability\nissues generally. The Yao RM is continuing in 2016 and\nsome projects are going to be implemented in conjunction\nwith citizen groups in Yao city. Therefore, we should analyze\nthe development of the RM from the process goal. Second,\nthe local government must launch many official meetings,\nsuch as the Committee of Service Provision and Council for\nthe Support of Community Life of People With Disabilities.\nThese activities will provide fresh opportunities to conduct\ncomprehensive and effective studies on RM and other types\nof meetings.\nAuthor's Note\nThis article is a revised version of \"A Case Study of a Community\nMeeting for Drafting Policies Regarding People with Disaabilities,\"\npublished in the Japanese Journal of Experimental Social\njjesp.52.45).
