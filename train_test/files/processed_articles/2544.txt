This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com\n Keywords Social capital \u00c1 Political participation \u00c1 Internet and politics\nEver since Alexis de Tocqueville stressed the importance of America's vibrant\nassociational life, democratic theorists have examined the relationship between\nparticipation in voluntary associations and the development of norms that underlie a\nstable and effective democracy. Social capital is rooted in connections among\nindividuals, which cultivate citizenship norms, tolerance and civic activity (Putnam\nM. C.

This has produced dire\nforecasts about the vitality of American society and democracy because of the\npresumably negative consequences of declining social capital (Macedo et al. 2005;\nNational Conference on Citizenship 2006).\nConversely, a different set of studies suggest that while traditional membership\ngroups may wither, the ways in which people interact are not static, but rather\nevolve over time, creating new forms of social engagement. Viewed through a more\nlong-term historic lens, the halcyon days of the Elks and bowling leagues deliver\nonly a snapshot of citizen interactions (Bender 1978). Older types of community\norganizations based within neighborhoods have given way to newer community-\nserving organizations and more fluid connections through self-help groups, often not\nconnected with a national umbrella group, making membership tallies more difficult\nWhile some traditional forms of civic association may be declining, technolog-\nical innovations also may be changing the ways in which people associate with one\nAlthough the initial research was skeptical of the benefits of Internet-based\ninteraction, more recent studies suggest more positive effects of virtual activity in\nfostering personal interactions and democratic participation (Johnson and Kaye\n2009). Early studies typically examined the simple extent of Internet usage without\nregard to the nature of the usage. Much of Internet usage involves collecting\ninformation, exchanging emails or other activities that offer limited social\ninteractions. We contend that simple undifferentiated measures of Internet usage\nare less relevant to social capital formation than how citizens are using the Internet\nsocial interactions through chat rooms, on-line meetups, blogs, and social\nnetworking sites. These new technologies have greatly expanded the amount of\nsocial interaction that individuals now pursue through the Internet. These\ndevelopments were unanticipated by early critiques of the social capital potential\nof the Internet, and thus a reappraisal is necessary.\nOur key research question is whether these new forms of virtual interaction can\nhave similar positive consequences for social capital formation as traditional social\ngroup activity. We ask whether both social group and Internet-based forms of social\ninteractions independently contribute to two dimensions of social capital: citizen-\nship norms and political involvement. We rely on data collected in the 2005\nCitizenship Involvement Democracy survey conducted by the Center for\nDemocracy and Civil Society at Georgetown University. This survey provides\nunique detail on participation in both social groups and Internet-based interactions,\ncoupled with a broad range of potential social capital effects.\nThis research has important implications for debates over the decline in social\ncapital in America. Although participation in traditional associations may be\nwaning, interactions on the Internet are rising rapidly. As these new virtual forms of\nassociation proliferate, it is important to consider how they might affect civic\nattitudes and behaviors. Evidence that points toward the critical nature of face-to-\nface contacts in social groups for building tolerance and political activity would\nbolster the argument that America's social capital is in jeopardy. However, evidence\ndemonstrating that virtual interactions also foster democratic norms and activities\nwould support a more positive view of current trends in associational life.\nSocial Capital and Associations\nSocial capital has a long history in social science research, so we will only briefly\nsummarize this literature here. Social capital research often maintains that\norganizational involvement engenders norms of shared trust, reciprocity and civic\nresearch, we consider social capital to be rooted in social interactions among people,\nand we are interested in the political consequences. Putnam's (2000) research\nhighlights the benefits of social capital for cultivating democratic norms and habits,\nand ultimately for effective democracy. Civil society activity should develop the\nnorms of civic engagement, such as the belief in an active citizen role, and other\nsuch orientations. Participation in civil society groups can produce social and\norganizational skills that are vital for a participatory democracy--much in the\ntradition of Tocqueville's image of democracy in America. The development of\nthese social norms and skills is a prime argument of the social capital theory.\nSocial capital may be generated through several mechanisms, and some are more\nconducive to the democratic process than others. Scholars of social capital often\nstress that face-to-face communication networks are more likely to produce positive\nconsequences. Putnam et al. (2003) conclude that ``our investigations strongly\nsuggest that trust relationships and resilient communities generally form through\nthat engage their members in personal interactions as compared to checkbook\nmembership that lacks such interpersonal interactions. Face-to-face communica-\ntions presumably build stronger social capital effects among members through the\nexperience of personal interaction, the reciprocity of such interactions, and the\nredundancy of contacts. Howard and Gilbert (2008) similarly find that the more\nfrequently a person is involved in voluntary organizations, the greater their\ngeneralized trust and activity in politics.\nIn contrast, some scholars have questioned the necessity of in-person interactions\nas the basis for forming social capital. Hooghe and Stolle (2003), p. 11) warn that\nface-to-face interactions are ``less distinctive in their effects on civic attitudes than\nis predicted by social capital theory''. The nature of the group environment or the\ntypes of interactions or activities may be more influential than simple membership\nA Virtual Civil Society\nTechnological advances in the past decade have generated significant changes in\ncommunication styles among individuals. The early days of the Internet offered\nlimited social contact, often with a unidirectional flow of information from website\nto Internet user. Today, a new style of Internet activity offers substantially more\nopportunities for interaction. Many people join social groups through the Internet as\nthey receive e-newsletters from their groups or visit group websites, or receive and\nrespond to postings from Twitter. In addition, cyber associations have expanded\nrapidly as individuals interact through online forums, chat rooms and personal pages\nthat are separate from traditional social groups. For example, even by 2005 more\nthan 20% of Internet users said that they participated in a chat room or in an online\ndiscussion (Pew 2010). Social networking sites provide another venue to meet\nothers online, share information, and interact in other ways. In 2009, 47% of\nInternet users frequented online social networking sites such as MySpace, LinkedIn\nor Facebook (Pew 2010). These interactions have the potential to create a virtual\ncivil society.\nThe evolving research on Internet interaction yields mixed results on its potential\nrole in social capital formation in terms of the norms of citizenship and political\nparticipation. Some research suggests that because virtual associations encourage\nthe flow of information and social interactions, this may encourage the skills of\net al. 2001). Virtual associations facilitate collecting and exchanging information,\nand allow members to make up their own minds on issues. In this way, virtual\nassociations may develop skills in critical analysis. Because discussions over the\nInternet afford users more time to reflect, information and greater control over their\nresponses than through live conversation, they may allow freer exchange of\nviewpoints (McKenna and Bargh 2000). Experimental evidence supports the\npositive role of the Internet in facilitating civic discussion, revealing that individuals\nin online chat room discussions are more likely to express an opinion than\nindividuals in face-to-face discussions (Ho and McLeod 2008).\nIn contrast, some studies suggest a negative or limited role for the Internet in\nlinking citizens together. For example, Nie and Erbring (2002) find that more time\nspent on the Internet is associated with fewer social contacts, but their findings are\nfrom 1999 and do not examine how the Internet is being used. Significantly, a series\nof studies by Robert Kraut and colleagues suggest dynamic effects of Internet use\nover time. Kraut et al. (1998) originally reported negative effects of Internet use for\nsocial involvement. However, in a follow-up study, Kraut et al. (2002) find that,\nover successive waves of the panel survey, those same Internet users increased the\nsize of their local and distant social circles, gained more face-to-face interaction\nwith friends and family, greater community activity and social trust. Kraut et al.\n(2002, p. 68) suggest that changes in the Internet itself, including new communi-\ncation services, is the ``most parsimonious explanation'' for this shift over time.\nFinally, several studies demonstrate that Internet use is associated with higher\nlevels of political participation. Shah et al. (2002) show that ``time spent on the\nInternet contributes to increased levels of [civic] participation, but that civic\nparticipation is not a significant predictor of time spent online'' (975). Based on\npanel data, Jennings and Kent (2003) find that for those who adopted Internet use\nparticipation indicators. Mossberger et al. (2008) evaluate the impact of particular\nonline activities for voter turnout--from participating in chat room discussions to\nexchanging emails--and find that all are linked to voting in presidential elections.\nResearch specific to social networking among young people demonstrates that sites\nsuch as Facebook both facilitate new and maintain established face-to-face\nrelationships and enhance political participation, civic engagement, social trust\nOther studies are less sanguine about the positive impact of Internet use on\npolitical participation. Krueger (2002) finds that interactions on the Internet build\ncyberskills that lead to online participation, but not traditional forms of participa-\ntion. Among young people, social networking does not increase young adults'\npolitical knowledge or participation in traditional channels of politics, but does\nenhance online forms of political participation (Baumgartner and Morris 2009). A\nmeta-analysis of 38 studies revealed that the Internet has few negative consequences\nfor political engagement, but suggests that further research is needed to assess\nwhether the Internet plays a positive role (Boulianne 2009).\nOur research builds upon these past studies while advancing beyond this research\nin several ways. First, instead of measuring only undifferentiated Internet usage, we\nexplicitly examine social interactions via the Internet. Since the initial studies often\ncompared Internet users and non-users rather than social interaction on the Internet,\nthey may have underestimate the actual effects of virtual civil society. Although\nmore recent studies offer a more nuanced measure of the nature and amount of\nInternet use (for example, Valenzuela et al. 2009; Baumgartner and Morris 2009),\nmost of these studies are conducted among college students, and are often limited to\nsocial networking. There are large generational differences in Internet usage and\nespecially the use of social networking (Pew 2010), and we examine these\nrelationships among the entire US. population. In addition, it is important to go\nbeyond social networking websites to investigate the effects of Internet interactions\nmore generally.\nSecond, we compare Internet-based social interaction to social group based\nactivity. Specifically, are virtual interactions positively related to citizenship norms\nand involvement, similar to the relationship for traditional face-to-face interactions?\nAre these distinct forms of social interaction, or are group activists also those who\nparticipate in virtual interaction? Our key contribution is to examine how traditional\nface-to-face interactions compare to virtual interactions. By exploring how different\nforms of interaction relate to political involvement, we may improve our\nunderstanding of the mechanisms that generate social capital, and how these may\nbe changing over time.\nMeasuring Civil Society Activity\nOne of the challenges in studying civil society is to agree on what it means, as a\nprecursor to measuring public involvement in civil society activity. This challenge\nis compounded when we want to compare in-person engagement versus virtual civil\nsociety. For the former, there is considerable debate on whether membership in any\nsocial group sufficient to promote social capital (Warren 2000; Stolle and Rochon\n1998). For the latter, the options are even more diverse. A substantial part of\nInternet activity can involve impersonal activities such as ordering from a catalogue\nor looking up information. However, the Internet also opens a virtual door to a vast\narray of potential interpersonal interactions. These range from social networking\nsites of various forms, to reading and contributing to online forums, to the\ncollaborative activity in Internet communities (such as in World of Warcraft, Second\nLife, and other communities). Explicit political activity on the web is less common\n(such as discussion groups on political websites or connecting to like-minded\ncitizens through Moveon.org). However, the civil society thesis holds that social\ninteractions--even in non-political social groups or non-political web groups--can\nproduce social capital. We are fortunate to have a dataset that focused on measuring\ncivil society activity in both domains in forms that might reflect social capital\nformation.\nThe ``Citizenship, Involvement and Democracy'' (CID) survey of the Center for\nthe Democracy and Civil Society at Georgetown University examined the political\nvalues and behaviors of the American public. The nationally-representative survey\nconducted in-person interviews with 1001 respondents between May 16 and July 19,\n2005. International Communications Research (ICR) did the interviews using a\nclustered, area-probability sample of households and random selection of\nrespondents.1\nThe measurement of in-person social activity is relatively straightforward. The\nCID survey asked a typical battery about membership and participation in a list of\n16 social groups (plus an ``other'' category in which the respondent could identify\nanother group)2:\nQ. 39. Now I have some questions about voluntary organizations. For each of\nthe voluntary organizations I will now mention, please use this card to tell me\nwhether any of these things apply to you now or in the last 12 months, and, if\nso, which. A member of such an organizations; Participated in an activity\narranged by such an organization; Donated money to such an organization;\ndone voluntary (unpaid) work for such an organization.\n1 Additional information on the survey, its sampling design and representativeness, the questionnaire,\nand other findings are available from the project website: www.uscidsurvey.org/.\n2 The list of groups includes: sports club, cultural or hobby activities, trade union, business association,\nhumanitarian or human rights group, environmental or animal rights group, political party, education or\nscience group, social club or fraternal organization, community or neighborhood association, veterans\nassociation, ethnic or nationality group, self-improvement or self-help group, social services group, or\nother group. See the project website for the full wording of each item.\nStudies of social capital often measure only membership in social groups, and the\nCID goes the additional step of measuring actual participation in these groups to\ncapture the social interactions central to the social capital theory.\nIt is important to distinguish between the different types of social groups and\ntheir potential to develop politically relevant norms and skills, but the analyses\npresented here focus on mapping the overall impact of social activity. Therefore, we\nsimply counted the number of groups each respondent belonged to, and the number\nof groups in which they participated. The first two data columns of Table 1 display\nthese results.\nAlthough the survey presented respondents with a long list of possible social\ngroups, half of Americans (51.0%) say they are not a member of any group. A sixth\nof the American public belongs to three or more social groups. The second column\ndisplays the percentages who have participated in an activity of the group, which\nnecessitates in-person interaction. The level of participants drops off significantly,\nwith two-thirds reporting no participation.\nTo measure participation in virtual civil society, the CID survey focused on\nsocial interactions that occurred over the Internet as a comparison to in-person\ninteractions in a social group. The CID asked a battery of seven questions:\nQ. 7. Please tell how much, if at all, the Internet has helped you do each of the\nfollowing things? How about (READ ITEM). Would you say a lot, some, only\na little, or not at all?\na. Become more involved with groups and organizations you already belong to\nb. Interact with people or groups who share your hobbies or interests\nc. Interact with people or groups who share your religious beliefs\nd. Interact with people or groups who share your political views\ne. Interact with people of a different race from yours\nf. Interact with people of different ages or generations\ng. Interact with people from other countries\nTable 1 In-person and Internet based civil society activity\nNumber of interpersonal\nsocial group memberships\nNumber of interpersonal\nsocial group participations\nNumber of\nvirtual social interactions\nNote: Table entries are percentages in each column, with the mean and N for each type of activity\nThe advantage of this battery is that it does not just measure the amount of time\nspent on the Internet, but focuses specifically on social interactions done over the\nInternet.3 Much as with the group participation question, this includes social\ninteractions in a variety of settings--the exact phenomenon that is central to the\nsocial capital thesis. Thus, the two measures are not necessarily equivalent in the\nsense that one interpersonal interaction equals one virtual interaction. Rather,\nthe common denominator among interpersonal and virtual interaction is interactions\nwith other people, as opposed to passive checkbook memberships or watching\nYouTube.\nThe distribution of responses across these virtual interaction options illustrates\nthe diverse pattern of Internet activity (Fig. 1). As a baseline, nearly two-fifths of\nour sample report having no Internet access or never using the Internet (43%). Still,\na fifth of Americans say that the Internet helps them a lot or somewhat to become\nmore involved in existing groups (19%); and substantial numbers use the Internet to\ninteract with people sharing their hobbies (25%), their religious belief (13%), or\ntheir political beliefs (15%). In addition, the Internet broadens social networks\nbeyond the immediate community and existing social networks. Web activity often\nstarts as a color-blind and gender-blind medium, so people of different races or\ngenders can interact without first knowing each other's identity. Thus, bridging\ninteractions are quite common. Many respondents reported that they interacted with\npeople of a different race (18%), of different ages (26%), or from other countries\n(16%). Almost by definition, Internet interactions open the door to a broader social\nnetwork than an individual's immediate physical network.\nGroups Hobbies Religion Politics Diff.\nRace\nDiff. Age Diff.\nCountry\nPercentage\nNo access No use Not at all Only little Some A lot\nFig. 1 The distribution of Internet-based social interactions\n3 We are thus skeptical of previous research that often uses measures of Internet usage as a predictor,\nwithout determining what is done on the Internet. Participating in a chat room seems more analogous to\nsocial group activity than does ordering a book from Amazon.com.\nThe third column in Table 1 displays the distribution of virtual activity counting\nthe number who say ``a lot'' or ``some'' participation.4 A majority report no Internet\ninteractions at this level (61.1%). Among those who interact, more report multiple\nforms of interaction; 17.0% report interacting in three or more of the listed options.\nThe average interaction through the Internet (1.28 items) is actually higher than for\nmembership in social groups (1.20) or participation in social groups (.84)--even\nthough the social group list included 16 possible groups. Furthermore, two-fifths of\nthe sample report no Internet access or no usage of the Internet; these respondents\nwere not asked this battery of questions. Thus, if we focus only on those individuals\nwho have access to the Internet reports of social interaction through the Internet are\nsubstantially greater (data not shown).\nWe believe both aspects of civil society participation--social groups and virtual\ninteractions--can be complimentary forms of social engagement. Indeed, there is a\npositive relationship between in-person and virtual civil society participation\n(approximately r = .20 depending on the choice of index). Virtual civil society may\nthus partially represent an extension of the past patterns of social engagement to a\nnew medium.\nAt the same time, virtual civil society represents a new style of social\nengagement that draws different people into social activity. For instance, as one\nmight expect, membership in social groups strongly increases with age (r = .13),\nalthough participation in social groups is essentially unrelated to age (r = -.02). In\ncontrast, virtual civil society activity is predominately the domain of the young\n(r = -.23). When age is combined with education, it clearly identifies the core of\nvirtual civil society. Among young, college-educated Americans, 73% have some\nInternet interactions, while the comparable percentage among all older Americans\n(regardless of education level) is 15%! The young are the wired generation, who\ninteract through the Internet, IM, text messages and emails--while their parents are\nattending a church social, a book club, or a pilates class.5\nThe Correlates of Civil Society Activity\nBased on our theoretical expectations for the ways interpersonal social and virtual\ngroup activity generate social capital, this section examines their correlates with two\nareas: citizenship norms and political participation.\n4 The table presents the count of the number of interactions that were done ``often'' or ``sometimes''. The\nsurvey skipped these questions for those who did not have access to the Internet at home or at work. They\nare included in the ``none'' category in the third column.\n5 We use these examples because the most common types of group participation are in a religious group\n(16.9%), cultural or hobby activities (9.1%), or a sports club (8.8%).\nCitizenship Norms\nCivil society interactions should socialize participants into the norms of democratic\ncitizenship. This is the essence of the Tocquevillian theme that civil society breeds\ndemocratic habits of the heart (Putnam 2000). One key element of a democratic\npolitical culture is political tolerance. Interpersonal and virtual activities may bolster\npolitical tolerance by connecting participants to a variety of contacts. However, the\nnature of social interactions--within social groups and within virtual networks--is\nprobably more important than the quantity of such interactions.\nThe CID assessed political tolerance with an open-ended question framework\n(Gibson 2008). The survey first asked respondents to identify the group they liked\nleast from a set of critical groups. Then, for their least-liked group, they were asked\nif this group should be allowed to make a speech in the community, to hold public\nrallies, or be banned from holding public office.6\nPolitical tolerance shares a positive relationship with social group interaction and\nwith virtual social interactions (Table 2). In other words, interactions are important\ncorrelates of tolerance regardless of whether these interactions occur face-to-face or\nin a virtual civil society.\nTable 2 Correlations of political\nnorms with interpersonal and\nvirtual civil society activity\nNote: Table entries are Pearson\nr correlations between political\nnorms and indices of\ninterpersonal and virtual civil\nsociety participation\n* Statistically significant\ncoefficients at the .05 level\nSocial norms Social\ngroup\nmembership\nSocial\ngroup\nparticipation\nVirtual\nsocial\ninteractions\nDuty-based Citizenship\nDuty-based\nCitizenship Index\nEngaged Citizenship\nBe active in voluntary\ngroups\nEngaged Citizenship\nIndex\n6 The three items were answered on a five point agree/disagree scale. The responses to the three items\nwere added together and divided by three to generate a 1\u00ad5 scale of tolerance.\nAnother aspect of citizenship norms flows from Americans' perceptions of what\nconstitutes a ``good'' democratic citizen and the centrality of participation and\nsocial concern to this definition. These norms tap even more directly on the\nfeelings of reciprocity and efficacy that should flow from civil society participa-\ntion. The CID survey asks respondents a battery of questions on the qualities of\ngood citizenship. Respondents rate the importance for each item. Thus, we\nmeasure norms of behavior rather than whether the respondents actually do these\nthings.\nIn a previous analysis of these items, Dalton (2007, Chap. 2) argued that the\nitems in the CID cluster along two dimensions of citizenship: duty-based and\nengaged citizenship. We use this framework to organize our presentation.\nPerceptions of duty-based perceptions include traditional norms, such as the\nimportance of voting in elections, serving on a jury, serving in the military, always\nobeying the law, and reporting a crime. Engaged citizenship reflects a more\nparticipatory, elite-challenging view of citizenship, such as forming one's own\nopinion, supporting those who are worse off, being active in politics and being\nactive in voluntary groups. We expect that social group and virtual interactions\nmight foster both sets of citizenship norms, but especially engaged citizenship\nbecause of its emphasis on collective action and concern for others.\nTable 2 displays the relationships of social group and virtual interactions with\ncitizenship norms. Neither social group nor virtual activity is systematically\nrelated to the duty-based norms of citizenship displayed in the middle panel of the\ntable. The one exception is voting in elections, which is included on the duty-\nbased dimension of citizenship. In contrast, both interpersonal and virtual\ninteractions are positively related to most examples of engaged citizenship. For\nexample, all three measures have almost identical correlations with a definition of\ncitizenship that involves being active in politics. Again, it appears that the\nexistence of social interaction is more important than the forum in which these\ninteractions occur.\nPolitical Participation\nA long series of analyses predict that participation in social groups bolsters political\nVirtual interactions may encourage political involvement through similar mecha-\nnisms of stimulation and mobilization. We thus expect a positive relationship of\nsocial group and virtual activity with various forms of political participation.\nThe CID survey is exceptional because it asked about participation in a wide\nrange of political activities (Table 3). In addition to general political interest, the\nCID asked respondents whether they had participated in 15 different types of\npolitical activity over the past year, including voting in the 2004 election. We used a\nvarimax rotated factor analysis to identify four broad dimensions of participation:\ndirect action, electoral activity, Internet activity, and protest activity.7 The direct\naction dimension includes boycotting/buycotting, signing a petition, and wearing a\ncampaign or political sticker/button. The electoral/party activity dimension includes\nworking for a candidate, working for a political party, or working for another\npolitical organization. The Internet activity dimension includes forwarding an\nelectronic message with political content, participating in politics on the Internet,\nand visiting the website of a political organization. The protest dimension includes\nparticipating in either a legal or illegal protest. We use this framework in presenting\nresults here and in the multivariate analyses below. The indices of each participation\nmode are factor scores from the factor analysis of items.\nConsistent with our expectations, all three measures of social interaction are\ngenerally associated with the various forms of political participation. Broad interest\nin politics (tapped by the frequency of political discussion) shares a strong positive\nrelationship with both social group interaction and virtual social interactions. The\nindex of direct political action in the next panel is also strongly related to social\ngroup participation (r = .37) and to virtual social interactions (.23). As we might\nexpect, virtual social interactions are very strongly correlated to various types of\nInternet-based activity; and there are strong correlations for social group partici-\npation. Protest activity is the one area where social interaction is weakly related to\npolitical action.\n7 The survey asked about participation in 15 different forms of political action over the previous\n12 months, and whether the respondent voted in the 2004 election. For the full wording of items, see the\nquestionnaire on the project website (note 1). We entered these items into a factor analysis with varimax\nrotation. Four dimensions had eigenvalues greater than 1.0, and were used to create factor scores for the\nanalyses in Table 4. The factor loadings are:\nDirect Electoral Internet Protest\nAcross most political activities, social group membership has a stronger\nrelationship than group participation--countering the interpersonal interaction\nclaims of social capital theory. This suggests that group membership may be less of\na causal factor in stimulating participation than a spurious correlate of action. Those\nwho are more likely to be engaged will join organizations, even if they do not\nparticipate in these groups.\nIn summary, political activity displays similar correlations with social group\nparticipation and virtual interactions. This reaffirms the point that virtual interaction\ncan stimulate the positive aspects of democratic social capital as found in traditional\nsocial group interactions.\nTable 3 Correlations of political\nparticipation with interpersonal\nand virtual civil society activity\nNote: Table entries are pearson\nr correlations between political\nparticipation and indices of\ninterpersonal and virtual civil\nsociety participation\n* Statistically significant\ncoefficients at the .05 level\nPolitical involvement Social\ngroup\nmembership\nSocial\ngroup\nparticipation\nVirtual\nsocial\ninteractions\nBought a product for\nethical, political reasons\nDisplay political\nsticker/banner\nWork for a political\nparty or action group\nWorked for a political\ncampaign\nWork for other political\ngroup\nElectoral participation\nindex\nForward electronic\nmessage with political\ncontent\nParticipated in Internet\npolitical activities\nVisit website political\norganization\nInternet participation\nindex\nMultivariate Analyses\nAs a final step in our research, we developed multivariate analyses to ensure that the\nsocial capital relationships we described are not spurious correlations due to other\nfactors. For instance, more highly educated and younger individuals are more likely\nbetween the Internet and social capital may influenced by the fact that more highly\neducated individuals are more likely to have social group connections in the first\nWe entered both interpersonal social group participation and virtual social\nactivity into multiple regressions predicting the indices developed in the previous\nanalyses. We use group participation rather than simple group membership, because\nit is supposed through interpersonal interactions that social groups stimulate social\ncapital. These regressions include other potential influences on these dependent\nvariables, such as age, education, gender, race, ethnicity, and liberal/conservative\norientations. We do not specify the theoretical logic of each of these control\nvariables for each of the models. However, we selected these variables because they\nroutinely are linked to several of these dependent variables. For instance, education\nand age are common predictors of political tolerance and participation, while also\ndisplaying significant correlations with both group and virtual social interaction.\nTo an extent, these models `overcontrol' for civil society effects because we look\nat the impact of each index of activity while controlling for the other--since these\ntwo forms of activity are positively related, we are trying to isolate their\nindependent effects. If either social activity variable alone is included in these\nmodels, the effects of each typically are significantly stronger.\nOur findings are presented in Table 4. The first columns present citizenship\nnorms. Although both variables are significantly related to tolerance in simple\nbivariate relationships, the impact of interpersonal social group and virtual activity\nsubstantially overlaps with other variables in the model--and each other--\nmoderating the impact of each variable in the regression analysis. The next two\ncolumns display the models for duty-based and engaged norms of citizenship.\nNeither social group nor virtual interaction reaches statistical significance for duty-\nbased citizenship, consistent with Table 2. These traditional norms of social order\n(and the norm to vote) do not seem to be conditioned by civil society engagement.\nIn contrast, both social group and virtual interaction are significant predictors of\nengaged citizenship norms. Virtual social activity is essentially as conducive as\nparticipation in social groups in building more grassroots, directly engaged values of\ncitizenship that are the habits of the heart that Tocqueville stressed.\nThe last five columns in the table predict different aspects of political\nparticipation. We use political discussion as a general measure of political interest;\nvirtual social interaction is an even stronger predictor of political discussion than\nin-person social group participation, and both are statistically significant. Similarly,\nboth forms of interaction are positive indicators of direct action and electoral\nactivity even while controlling for the other variables in this model. As we should\nexpect, virtual interaction is much more strongly related to Internet-based political\nactivity. Virtual interaction is not related to protest activity in this multivariate\nTable 4 Multivariate regressions to predict citizenship norms and political participation\nPredictors Political tolerance Duty-based\ncitizenship\nEngaged citizenship Political discussion Direct action Electoral activity Internet activity Protest activity\nUnstd b b Unstd b b Unstd b b Unstd b b Unstd b b Unstd b b Unstd b b Unstd b b\nSocial group\nparticipation\nLeft/right\nplacement\nNote: Entries represent coefficients from OLS regressions, standard errors in parentheses.

The geographically disperse nature of the Internet may sever the link\nbetween virtual interactions and protest. It is likely to be more difficult to mobilize a\ndistant friend met on the Internet to participate in a local protest.\nIn short, interpersonal and virtual interactions are both independently linked to\npolitical participation, even after controlling for demographic and ideological\ninfluences.8 Social interactions outside of politics increase the odds that people will\nbecome involved in politics. The independent effects of virtual social interactions\non tolerance are more ambiguous, but that might be because of the overlap with\ntraditional group forms of social action that are also controlled in the model. For\ninstance, in a model predicting political tolerance with only virtual social interaction\n(excluding social groups), virtual interactions have a significant positive effect\n(b = .08). Trying to isolate the overlapping effects of social group and virtual\ninteraction may overcontrol for the effects of each.\nConclusions\nMany leading scholars have recently lamented the decline of civic engagement and\nsocial capital in America, claiming that too many of us are sitting at home in front of\nour televisions sets, and more recently our computer monitors, and not personally\nConference on Citizenship 2006). Initially these criticisms might have been correct.\nStudies of traditional social group activity argued that face-to-face interaction in\nsocial groups was necessary to generate positive social capital (Putnam 2000;\nWarren 2000). Early Internet usage also offered only a one-directional flow of\ninformation with minimal interaction with other people. Moreover, previous studies\nof Internet users yielded mixed results on the potential social capital benefits of this\nnew medium.\nThe nature of Internet interaction has changed dramatically, however, with new\ninnovations such as social networking sites, blogs and sites such as MeetUp.org.\nRather than study simple Internet usage as many previous studies have done, we\nexamined the amount of social interaction that individuals pursue through the\nInternet. This, we believe, provides a closer test of the theorized impact of social\ninteractions in the sense that our virtual interaction measure, similar to participation\nin traditional social groups, captures people interacting with other people, as\nopposed to more passive forms of Internet activity.\nOur findings suggest that the mechanisms through which citizens interact with\nothers are evolving with the new technology of the Internet (and other new\ntechnologies). Indeed, more people are looking at their computer monitors or\nsmartphone screens, and many use this experience to connect to others in their\nsocial groups, others who share their cultural, social or political interests, and to\n8 Alternative specifications of these models that include control variables such as political interest and\nstrength of party identification yield substantially similar results. We present the most basic models and\nfocus on the impact our variables of interest, interpersonal social group participation and virtual\ninteractions. In addition, the unstandardized b values generally paint the same picture as the betas,\nminimizing the potential for skewed distributions affecting the results.\ngarner information about the world and their fellow citizens through this new\nmedium.\nEven if Facebook cannot completely substitute for bowling leagues and choral\nsocieties, virtual civil society appears to have many of the same benefits for citizen\nnorms and political involvement as traditional civil society. We find that virtual\nactivity is most clearly linked to a participatory style of citizenship, first through the\nparticipatory norms of engaged citizenship. Second, virtual activity is positively\nassociated with several forms of political engagement. Moreover, these participa-\ntory benefits persist even in multivariate analyses controlling for social group\ninteractions and a set of potential demographic predictors.\nNot only is virtual civil society expanding, but so is virtual political activity\nmembers of Congress receive from their constituents now come in the form of email.\nThe 2008 Obama campaign demonstrated how Internet-based fundraising and voter\nmobilization can transform the nature of presidential elections. The expansion of\ne-government activities provides further political access for the computer literate.\nThus, as these Internet-based forms of political activity grow, they further enable the\npotential of Internet-based social networks to become politically engaged.\nHaving demonstrated these broad patterns, they should encourage more focused\nanalyses on the varieties of virtual social activity, paralleling previous research on\nthe varieties of social group membership. For instance, we expect that interactions\nbased on existing social networks, as represented in some of our interaction items,\nwould deepen bonding relationships.9 In contrast, virtual activity that expands\nbeyond immediate personal networks, such as interactions with people from\ndifferent countries or interactions with strangers, may generate more bridging\nrelationships. Facebook exchanges with coworkers may add less to existing stocks\nof social capital than meeting new fellow hobbists or political activists in another\ncity. The Internet seems especially capable of creating new networks unrestrained\nby geographic proximity, and renewing connections with friends at long distance.\nSuch `weak ties' are often stressed as the most valuable aspect of social networks\n(Granovetter 1973). There is also anecdotal evidence that multi-person online\ngaming may also have the same social capital potential as bowling leagues. With the\ngrowth of Internet activity, our research focus should examine these more detailed\nquestions of social capital formation.\nIn addition, our results raise some new questions about the impact of traditional\ngroup membership. In most relationships a simple count of the number of group\nmembership displays a stronger correlation than a measure of participation in these\ngroups. The logic of civil society theory would suggest that participation should be\nmore important than simple membership, because it is through interpersonal\ninteractions that social capital supposedly develops. Similar to our findings,\nresearchers find comparable differences between passive and active social group\nmembership in explaining social trust and political participation across a set of\n9 For instance, the 2007 Australian Election Study replicated the virtual social capital questions, and\nresearchers have begun to examine the relationships between different types of on-line interaction and\nindices of bridging and bonding social trust (Gibson and McAllister 2009).\nEuropean democracies (Wollebak and Selle 2007; van der Meer and van Ingen\n2009). These patterns suggest that part of the correlation between group\nmembership and social capital does not reflect the socialization experience of\ninterpersonal interaction, but the selection process by which individuals join social\ngroups. Thus, past civil society research based on group membership statistics may\noverestimate the social learning impact of civil society on the norms and behaviors\nlinked to social capital.\nIn summary, our findings suggest that social capital can be generated in multiple\nways, and those mechanisms are changing with social, economic and technological\nchanges in America. Specifically, virtual civil society has the potential to be an\nimportant new source of social capital formation in the contemporary age. Given the\nsubstantial group in Internet social interaction since our 2005 survey (Pew 2010),\nand the substantial potential for further growth, the current aggregate social capital\nbenefits are undoubtedly greater than those presented here.\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution\nNoncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any\nmedium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.\nReferences\nBaumgartner, J.
