Does relationship lending in the interbank market contain banks' costs of liquidity\nprovision? In this paper we try to shed some light on these questions using data on German\nbanks' individual bids in the ECB's main refinancing operations that were held until October\n8, 2008 as variable rate tenders, i.e. as pay-your-bid auctions. These auctions are the key\nsource of liquidity for the banking sector in the Euro area as a whole. From an individual\nbank's perspective, an alternative source of liquidity is the interbank market. Thus the\nwillingness to pay for liquidity by an individual bank in the ECB's auctions is a good\nindicator for the opportunity cost each bidding bank faces when covering its liquidity needs.\nWe match the bidding data on the individual bank level with various bank characteristics\nmeasuring, for example, bank health, size and liquidity status. Most importantly, however, we\nuse data from the German credit register (Millionen-Kredit-Evidenz Statistik) to identify\ninterbank credit relationships. As measures for the intensity of an existing interbank credit\nrelationship of a borrowing bank, we use the largest share of financing provided by a single\nlender relative to the bank's overall interbank borrowing. To measure the diversification in\ninterbank borrowing we use the number of banks from which an individual financial\ninstitution received credit in the previous quarter. As an indirect measure, we employ the\ninterconnectedness of a bank in the money market, where we calculate the centrality of an\nindividual bank in the network of interbank credit relations. This indicator measures how\nintense a bank is linked to other banks that themselves have many interbank connections. We\ncalculate this measure for both lenders and borrowers. First we assess to what extent an\nindividual bank is lending to many other banks, in particular to those that are themselves\ncentral lenders to the rest of the banking system. Second we also derive to what extent a bank\nis borrowing from many banks that are themselves central borrowers in the interbank market,\ni.e. borrowing from many other banks.\nWe find that banks that are more dependent on a single lender in the interbank market\ntend to bid more aggressively, i.e. place higher bids in the auctions, and pay a higher price for\nliquidity in the auction. Similarly banks that have a multitude of established banking relations,\ni.e. a higher number of interbank lenders, bid less aggressively and pay a lower price for\nliquidity in the auctions. Thus, in contrast to the findings in corporate finance, our results\nsuggest that concentration in interbank lending relationships does not help mitigate\nborrowers' costs of overcoming liquidity shortages. Quite the contrary, having a large\nportfolio of established lending relationships seems to help banks meeting their liquidity\nrequirements more efficiently. Interestingly, we also find some evidence that a bank that\npredominantly lends to a money center bank in the interbank market, i.e. a bank that is itself\nlending to many other banks, bids more aggressively in the auctions and ultimately also pays\na higher price for liquidity in the auctions. Thus banks that have large exposures to the key\nlenders in the money market tend to pay a higher price for liquidity, which suggest that they\npay a risk premium because they are more exposed to systemic risk. However, central\nborrowers paid a lower price particularly during the recent financial crisis. This is consistent\nwith the fact that established borrowing relationships with money center banks (that were\nlikely too big to fail) ensured a better intermediated access to liquidity. The effects of\nnetwork position, while statistically significant and generally robust to changes in\nspecification, are usually very small, whereas the relationship effects of the direct links are\nlarger and more consistent before and during the crisis.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nHelfen etablierte Kreditbeziehungen am Interbankenmarkt Banken dabei,\nLiquidit\u00e4tsengp\u00e4sse besser zu bew\u00e4ltigen? Gibt es so etwas wie relationship lending am\nInterbankenmarkt, das es Banken erlaubt, ihren Liquidit\u00e4sbedarf g\u00fcnstiger zu decken? In\ndiesem Papier nutzen wir die Gebote deutscher Banken in den Offenmarktoperationen des\nESZB, um diesen Fragen nachzugehen. Bis Oktober 2008 wurden diese Operationen als\nZinstender durchgef\u00fchrt. D.h., Banken mussten die Zinss\u00e4tze, die sie im Rahmen der Auktion\nf\u00fcr Liquidit\u00e4t boten, auch zahlen. F\u00fcr den Europ\u00e4ischen Bankensektor insgesamt waren diese\nHauptrefinanzierungs-gesch\u00e4fte die wesentliche Quelle f\u00fcr Liquidit\u00e4t. Aus\nEinzelbankperspektive stellt der Interbankenmarkt eine alternative M\u00f6glichkeit der\nLiquidit\u00e4tsbeschaffung dar. Die Zahlungsbereitschaft einer Bank f\u00fcr Liquidit\u00e4t in den\nAuktionen ist daher eine gutes Ma\u00df f\u00fcr ihre Opportunit\u00e4tskosten der Liquidit\u00e4tsbeschaffung\nim Interbankenmarkt.\nAus anderen Statistiken ordnen wir den Bietungsdaten der verschiedenen Banken weitere\nBankcharakteristika bspw. bez\u00fcglich der Stabilit\u00e4t, Gr\u00f6\u00dfe und Liquidit\u00e4tsausstattung zu.\nZudem nutzen wir die Informationen aus der Millionen-Kredit-Evidenz Statistik der\nDeutschen Bundesbank, um bilaterale Interbankkreditbeziehungen zu identifizieren und zu\nmessen. Als Ma\u00df f\u00fcr die Intensit\u00e4t einer etablierten Kreditbeziehung am Interbankenmarkt\nnutzen wir den Anteil der Kreditvergabe des gr\u00f6\u00dften Kreditgebers einer Bank an den\ngesamten Interbankverbindlichkeiten der Schuldnerbank. Die Diversifikation der\nInterbankenkreditbeschaffung einer Bank messen wir anhand der Zahl ihrer Gl\u00e4ubigerbanken\nim vergangen Quartal. Als ein weiteres, indirektes Ma\u00df f\u00fcr Interbankenkreditverflechtung\nberechnen wir f\u00fcr jede Bank das sog. Zentralit\u00e4tsma\u00df. Dieser Indikator misst, wie intensive\neine Bank mit anderen Banken verflochten ist, insbesondere mit solchen, die selbst wiederum\nzentral f\u00fcr das Netzwerk der Interbankkreditverflechtung sind. Wir berechnen dieses Ma\u00df\nsowohl f\u00fcr die Kreditvergabe als auch die Kreditaufnahme am Interbankenmarkt und messen\nso einerseits, inwieweit eine Bank Kreditgeber f\u00fcr viele andere Banken ist - gerade f\u00fcr solche,\ndie selbst zentrale Kreditgeber f\u00fcr den Rest des Bankensektor sind. Anderseits bestimmen\nwir, in welchem Ma\u00dfe eine Bank von vielen Banken Kredit aufnimmt, insbesondere von\nsolchen die selbst wiederum zentrale Kreditnehmer im Interbankennetzwerk sind, d.h. die\nselbst wiederum von vielen anderen Banken Kredite aufnehmen.\nUnsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Banken, die stark von einem Kreditgeber am\nInterbankenmarkt abh\u00e4ngig sind, aggressiver in den Ofenmarktoprationen agieren. Sie bieten\neinen h\u00f6heren Zins und zahlen im Durchschnitt damit mehr f\u00fcr Liquidit\u00e4t. Dagegen bieten\nBanken, die eine Mehrzahl von Kreditbeziehungen am Interbankenmarkt etabliert haben,\nweniger aggressive und k\u00f6nnen ihren Liquidit\u00e4tsbedarf damit g\u00fcnstiger in den Auktionen\ndecken. Entgegen der \u00fcblichen Resultate aus der Unternehmensfinanzierung deuten unsere\nErgebnisse somit an, dass durch eine enge Konzentration der Kreditbeziehungen auf einen\nGl\u00e4ubiger die \u00dcberbr\u00fcckung von Liquidit\u00e4tsengp\u00e4ssen eher teurer wird. Eine Vielzahl von\netablierten Kreditbeziehungen macht es dagegen f\u00fcr Banken einfacher, ihren\nLiquidit\u00e4tsbedarf kosteng\u00fcnstig zu decken. Interessanterweise finden wir dar\u00fcber hinaus, dass\nBanken aggressiver in den Auktionen bieten und letztlich mehr f\u00fcr Liquidit\u00e4t zahlen, wenn sie\ninsbesondere mit zentralen Intermedi\u00e4ren im Interbankenmarkt Kreditbeziehungen\nunterhalten, d.h. Liquidit\u00e4t vor allem an Banken verleihen, die selbst wiederum Kreditnehmer\nvon einer Vielzahl anderer Banken sind. Dies legt die Vermutung nahe, dass solche Banken\neine erh\u00f6hte Kreditrisikopr\u00e4mie aufgrund des systemischen Risikos bezahlen. Dagegen war\ndie Zahlungsbereitschaft f\u00fcr Liquidit\u00e4t von zentralen Kreditnehmern im Interbankennetzwerk\nin den Offenmarktauktionen vor allem zu Beginn der Krisenperiode geringer. Dies deutet\ndarauf hin, dass sich Banken, die insbesondere ihren Liquidit\u00e4tsbedarf \u00fcber Kredit von\nzentralen Intermedi\u00e4ren am Geldmarkt deckt, g\u00fcnstiger refinanzieren konnten, da sie so auch\nverbesserten indirekten Zugang zu Liquidit\u00e4t haben. Insgesamt zeigt sich, dass die\nZentralit\u00e4tsma\u00dfe zwar einen statistisch signifikanten und robusten Einfluss haben, ihr\n\u00f6konomischer Effekt aber gering ist. Dagegen ist der Einfl\u00fcsse direkter etablierter\nKreditbeziehungen auf die Zahlungsbereitschaft f\u00fcr Liquidit\u00e4t auch \u00f6konomisch weit\ndeutlicher und konsistenter vor und w\u00e4hrend der Krise.\nThe Role of Interbank Relationships and Liquidity Needs*\nBen R. Craig\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and Deutsche Bundesbank\nFalko Fecht\nFrankfurt School of Finance and Management\nG\u00fcnseli T\u00fcmer-Alkan\nVU University Amsterdam\n Keywords: Interbank markets, liquidity, relationship lending, networks\n*The authors are grateful to Monica Crabtree-Reusser, Heinz Herrmann and Steven Ongena, and to\nparticipants at the 2012 American Economic Association meetings (Chicago) and seminar participants\nat Aarhus University for valuable comments. The views expressed in this paper represent the authors'\npersonal opinions and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Deutsche Bundesbank, or the Federal\nReserve.\n1 Introduction\nA key strategy of the G20 for strengthening financial stability is to focus tighter\nregulatory requirements on financial institutions considered to be too big or too connected to\nfail. The recommended regulatory changes strive to contain the moral hazard resulting from\nthe implicit insurance for investors. Indicators of the systemic importance of a bank typically\ninclude both claims against the bank and claims that it holds against other financial\ninstitutions.1 The failure of a bank clearly imposes costs on its creditors, but why should its\nfailure also impose costs on its borrowers?\nThe key reason that borrowers in the interbank market can suffer from a failure of their\nlender lies in the fact that relationships and private information matter. As Rochet and Tirole\n(1996) argue, private information and peer monitoring play an important role in interbank\nmarkets. If private information acquired through lending relationships allows an interbank\nlender to better assess the credit risk of his counterparty, borrowers of good quality should\nreceive cheaper funding from their interbank relationship lender than from other banks. The\nfailure of an interbank relationship lender results in the loss of valuable private information.\nThe borrower bank might not be able to receive funding in the interbank market from other\nsources or might be able to receive it only at a mark-up. This difficulty might ultimately even\nlead to the failure of the borrower. Thus if relationship lending prevails in interbank markets,\nfinancial contagion not only affects lenders through credit default, it also endangers the\nstability of borrowers through the loss of information about them. Questions on the extent of\nprivate information and relationships in the interbank market are central to assessing the costs\nof a systemic bank failure.\nOn the other hand, a borrower will receive liquidity at favourable rates from his\nrelationship lender only if the lender has the excess liquidity to lend. Consequently, in order to\n1 See, for example, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2011).\nensure a higher probability of receiving liquidity from informed lenders, banks might prefer\nestablishing multiple credit relationships.2 Moreover, a more diversified network of\nrelationship lenders can mitigate the lock-in that might lead to higher borrowing costs.3\nBeing connected has implications for a bank that extend beyond simple relationship\nstructures and access to private information about the banks with which they are immediately\nconnected. Borrowing from a lender with a well-diversified network of lenders might ensure\nthat the lender can also provide liquidity even though he has no excess reserves available\nhimself. He might serve as an intermediary in the interbank market borrowing liquidity to\nlend it to other counterparties. But this intermediation in the interbank market also bring about\nlending relationship exposes a bank not only to its immediate counterparty, but also to those\ncounterparties that the bank's counterparty is exposed to. While these secondary links are not\nsubject to the same monitoring that the primary relationship loans are, both types of links will\nexpose the bank's lenders to systemic risks that should add to the cost of borrowing on the\ninterbank market.\nIn this paper, we focus on relationships and connectedness in the interbank market and\nthe price banks pay for liquidity. We try to assess the extent to which the concentration of a\nparticular relationship or the multitude of established credit relationships influence banks'\ncosts of meeting their liquidity demand. Using the structure of the interbank credit network,\nwe can also identify banks that are central to the interbank market. This allows us to study the\nextent to which banks can cover their liquidity needs more cheaply if they rely primarily on\nthe liquidity provision of money center banks. Furthermore, we use the centrality measures to\nestimate whether a bank's exposure to systemic risk increases its borrowing costs.\n2 Ashcraft and Duffie (2007) provide evidence for this argument for the U.S. money market.\n3 See Petersen and Rajan (1995) for a framework of credit market competition in bank-firm relationships.\nOur data are particularly well suited to the question of the value of relationships in\ninterbank lending markets. First, we use credit register data, which show exposures of the\ninterbank market for long maturities as well as short maturities. These data contrast with\nlending data backed out from payments data using the Furfine (1999) approach. We have all\nof the loan exposures of the German banks, whereas often the Furfine approach will miss\nloans of longer maturities. Moreover, the longer maturities are especially good at indicating a\nrelationship between a bank and its lenders. Since they expose lenders to greater credit risk,\nlenders will be more careful in granting longer-term loans. Furthermore, lenders can monitor\nborrowers over the longer course of the loans and get regular information about how the\nborrowers meet their obligations in a wide variety of conditions. Thus the information\nadvantage of lenders increases through longer-term loans. We are aware that the demand\nschedule for short-term secured funding may be quite different than the longer term unsecured\nfunding. When exploring the correlations between changes in borrowed amount at ECB\nauctions and the amounts borrowed form peers, we see that they may be complements rather\nthan substitutes. This might reflect the fact that banks with established credit relationships in\nthe interbank market have access to sufficiently cheap and long-term liquidity such that they\ndo not need to demand liquidity from the ECB. Thus the information structure on\nrelationships that we use as a proxy can be expected to influence the price for short-term\nliquidity, and consequently the bidding behavior at ECB auctions.\nWe match the quarterly data of bilateral interbank credit exposures between all German\nto the bids placed by the individual banks in the European Central Bank's (ECB) weekly repo\nauctions. Since the main refinancing operations were held during our sample period as\nvariable rate tenders and \"pay-your-bid\" auctions, they reveal each individual bank's\nwillingness to pay for liquidity. Indeed, an important contribution of our study is that our\nbidding data give us an insight into the bidding banks' entire demand for short-run liquidity.\nWe can directly observe each individual bank's liquidity demand schedule where other\nstudies relying solely on bilateral interbank lending have difficulty separating demand and\nsupply effects when studying the impact of lending relationships..\n, We find that banks with more concentrated borrowing in the interbank market bid\nsignificantly more aggressively in the ECB's refinancing operations, controlling for bank\ncharacteristics. This suggests that incentives of diversifying bank liquidity risk play a more\nimportant role than benefits of relationships. When the entire network with all of the\nconnections are taken into account, banks with a higher centrality in lending, i.e. banks that\nlend to many banks that are themselves central to the money market, tend to bid more\naggressively in auctions. This might suggest that due to their higher systemic risk exposure\nthese banks pay a higher risk premium when facing a liquidity shortage themselves. However,\ncentral borrowers paid a lower price particularly during the recent financial crisis. This is\nconsistent with the fact that established borrowing relationships with money center banks\n(that were likely too big to fail) ensured a better intermediated access to liquidity. Those\nbanks with close borrowing relationships to money center banks had a reduced the value of\nliquidity and bid less aggressively. The effects of network position, while statistically\nsignificant and generally robust to changes in specification, are usually very small, whereas\nthe relationship effects of the direct links are larger and more consistent before and during the\ncrisis.\nOur paper is related to a number of empirical studies that investigate the importance of\nprivate information and relationship lending in the interbank market. Cocco, Gomes, and\nMartins (2009) find evidence for the Portuguese interbank market that weaker banks rely\nmore on lending relationships and pay lower rates for liquidity than they would otherwise\nwhen borrowing from their relationship lenders. More recently Afonso, Kovner, and Schoar\n(2011) study relationship lending in the federal funds market. They find that concentrated\nborrowers can easily get funds when needed and pay a significantly lower rate to their\nrelationship lenders than they pay when borrowing from other market participants. Braeuning\nand Fecht (2012) find that in the German interbank market, credit availability and interbank\nrates increase as the concentration and frequency of lending relations increases. Our analysis\nis different from these studies in that we focus on the effect that interbank lending\nrelationships have on the demand schedules that banks submit to the ECB's liquidity auctions.\nIn contrast to those studies, we can directly observe banks' liquidity demand schedules and\nbetter identify their determinants. In addition, our interbank credit data comprise loans at all\nmaturities, while previous studies could only consider short-term interbank loans, where\nestablished relationships are more important factors in the decision to grant a longer-term\nloan. Thus our data are better suited to provide comprehensive insights into the importance of\nrelationship lending in the interbank market.\nTheoretical models in a bank-firm context hypothesize that bank monitoring incentives\nlead to concentrated corporate borrowing (Holmstrom and Tirole (1997)) or to multiple\nbanking whenever the benefit of greater diversification dominates the costs of free-riding\n(Carletti, Cerasi, and Daltung (2007)). If concentrated borrowing leads to lower interbank\nborrowing rates (something we do not observe in our data), then this would be reflected in the\nlower rates that banks would be willing to bid for liquidity at the repo auctions held by the\ncentral bank. However, the borrowing structure is also determined by the financial health of\nthe lender and her access to liquidity, where multiple banking relationships also allow\nborrowers to diversify their bank liquidity risk (see Detragiache, Garella, and Guiso (2000)\nand Ongena, T\u00fcmer-Alkan, and von Westernhagen (2012)). In this respect, diversification\nincentives would suggest an inverse (positive) relationship between borrowing concentration\nand banks' liquidity needs (as reflected in their willingness to bid). Having established several\ninterbank credit relationships mitigates the dependency on an individual lender and might\ntherefore improve access to interbank liquidity.\nA recent strand of studies examines banks' willingness to pay for liquidity in the\nEuropean Central Bank's (ECB) weekly repo auctions (see Craig and Fecht (2007), Fecht,\nNyborg, and Rocholl (2011), Nyborg, Bindseil, and Strebulaev (2009), Linzert, Nautz, and\nBindseil (2007) and Linzert, Nautz, and Breitung (2006)). These papers explain banks'\nbidding behaviour by bank characteristics and market-wide factors, mainly focusing on their\nobserved liquidity positions. We contribute to this literature by investigating the role of\nconnections in the interbank market in influencing this behaviour. Moreover, we study the\nbidding behaviour over a much longer period, which enables us to exploit the time variation\nas well as to analyse the behaviour at the beginning of the turmoil.\nFinally, our paper is also related to the literature documenting increased systemic risk and\ncontagion due to interbank linkages. Iyer and Peydro (2009), for instance, show that higher\ninterbank exposure to a failed bank increases deposit withdrawals. The majority of the studies\nmodel the structure of the market by employing either payment data or balance sheet data to\nestimate interbank positions (see Furfine (2003), Bech and Atalay (2010), Upper and Worms\nother hand, develop a core-periphery model using German credit register data on bilateral\ninterbank exposures. While our analysis does not make any inference on the contagion or\nsystemic risk, we point to the implications of a bank being `too connected-to-fail' and believe\nthat it affects its liquidity needs and bidding behaviour. Our findings with the centrality\nmeasures also point to a conclusion where a higher degree of centrality in lending increases\nthe willingness to bid. However, particularly during the crisis period, central borrowers in the\nmoney market bid less aggressively in the auctions, which might reflect the lower default\nprobability due to being too-big-to-fail.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce the\ninstitutional background of the German banking system and the European System of Central\nBanks (ESCB). In section 3, we describe the data, our empirical strategy, and our hypotheses.\nWe investigate the impact of interbank relationships on bidding behaviour and present our\nfindings in the fourth section. Section 5 concludes.\n2 Institutional Background\nThe German universal banking system is structured along three pillars: commercial banks,\ncooperative banks, and public sector banks. By the end of 2007, German banks account for\nmore than a quarter of the assets in the euro area-banking sector. There were 2,015 banks in\ncommercial banks. However, in terms of market shares, commercial banks account for 30\npercent of all bank assets, whereas public sector banks account for 34.5 percent, and credit\ncooperatives together with their central institutions constitute only 10 percent.4 While both the\npublic and cooperative banks form a relatively closed giro system in which liquidity is\nreallocated, commercial banks rely to a larger extent on the liquidity provision of the formal\ninterbank market.\nBesides their need for working balances, banks' demand for liquidity in the euro area is\ndriven be the required reserves that they have to hold as a monthly average with the European\nSystem of Central Banks (ESCB). All banks that are subject to these reserve requirements\nalso have access to the ECB's standing facilities, i.e., the marginal lending facility as well as\nthe deposit facility, and are eligible to participate in the ECB's repo auctions. During the\nperiod that we consider, these repo auctions were held as variable rate tenders. Each bank was\nallowed to place up to 10 bids in each auction, giving the interest rate the bank would be\nwilling to pay for a loan of a certain size. The interest rate had to exceed a minimum bid rate,\nwhich was considered the key policy rate. The maturity of those collateralized short-term\n4 Commercial banks include large commercial banks (Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, Commerzbank,\nHypoVereinsbank), regional banks, and branches of foreign banks.\nloans granted by the ECB was two weeks before March 2004 and one week thereafter. The\nECB aggregated the individual demands for liquidity and calculated the marginal rate based\non the market-wide demand and the amount the ECB intended to allocate. Bids at the\nmarginal rate were served pro rata, bids with rates exceeding the marginal rate receive a full\nallotment, and bids lower than the marginal rate are not served. Banks in need of liquidity had\nan incentive to place a bid close to but slightly above the marginal bid rate. However, banks\ncould not perfectly anticipate the marginal rate. Consequently, banks that must cover their\nliquidity needs in the auctions (rather than in the interbank market), placed higher bids to\nensure that they received sufficient liquidity.5\nAt the marginal lending facility banks could borrow any amount overnight from the ECB,\nprovided that they had sufficient collateral pledged with the ESCB. The deposit facility allows\nbanks to deposit excess reserves with the ECB. In the period considered, the deposit rate is\n100 bp lower than the minimum bid rate, and the marginal lending facility rate was 100 bp\nhigher.\n3 Data and Empirical Approach\nWe employ a unique, matched dataset covering the period 2000 to 2008. The data are\nobtained by matching four major databases on the bank-date level. The databases are provided\nby the Deutsche Bundesbank and contain information on banks' bidding behaviour in the\nprimary market, interbank relationships, as well as balance sheet items and reserve data to\ncontrol for bank characteristics and liquidity needs.\n5 Abassi et al. (2013) provide evidence that banks' bidding behavior reflects indeed their willingness to pay for\nliquidity rather than their ability to predict the marginal rate. They show that banks' bids are highly correlated\nwith a banks' subsequent recourse to the marginal lending facility of the ECB (discount window).\nWe measure banks' willingness to pay for liquidity by the bids they placed in the\nEuropean Central Bank's (ECB) weekly repo auctions. The data on German banks are\ncompiled by the Deutsche Bundesbank, as all monetary operations in the Eurosystem are\nconducted at the national level. We include the complete set of bids for all main refinancing\noperations (MROs) that are variable rate tenders held in our sample period.6 The sample of\nauctions consists of 409 main refinancing operations with maturities of seven and fourteen\ndays.\nThe Deutsche Bundesbank's credit register is the second data source for our analysis. It\nreports for each German bank all large exposures to individual financial and non-financial\nfirms. Large exposures are defined as exposures of 1.5 million euros (formerly 3 million DM)\nand above. German banks are required to report exposures exceeding this threshold to the\nDeutsche Bundesbank on a quarterly basis.7 We are able to identify both the borrower and the\nlender with a full counter-party breakdown, borrower identity, location, industry, legal form,\nand the date of bankruptcy (if applicable). Moreover, we can distinguish short-term exposures\nfor interbank loans (up to one year) as well as on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items.\nSince we are interested in bilateral bank relationships, we include only exposures to banks,\nand investigate at each borrower level in order to observe borrowing patterns in the interbank\nmarket. In addition to investigating direct exposures, we include information on financial\nnetworks in order to account for systemic importance in terms of both intermediation and\ntiering in the interbank market (see Craig and von Peter, 2010).\nWe match this dataset of borrower banks and their relationship structure to bank balance\nsheet data (BISTA), which include all banks in the German banking system. Finally, we\n6 The ECB decided to change its auction procedure to a fixed-rate tender on 8 October 2008.\n7 For a more detailed definition, see Section 14 of the Banking Act (Deutsche Bundesbank, 2001). If the sum of\nthe exposures to firms in a borrower unit exceeds the threshold, the individual exposures in that borrower unit\nare reported, even if it is a small exposure. For claims existing during the reporting period but partly or fully\nrepaid, the remaining exposure is reported even if the amount is zero. This helps us to identify the existing\nbilateral relationships.\nemploy reserve data for all German financial institutions in the industry available from 2004\nto 2008. The data include each bank's cumulative reserve holdings on a daily basis and the\nreserve requirement for each maintenance period.\nWe explore the impact of interbank relationships on pricing by estimating\nPricing\nit\nRelationship & Centrality\nK\nAccounting\nN\n\n+ \nLiquidity\np,it\nP\n + \nAuction\njt\n+ \ni\n+ \nit\nwhere Pricing is measured by the bidding behavior (Overbid) and the price paid\n(Overpricing), respectively.\nA potential problem with the identification strategy is that our Relationship and\nCentrality variables are endogenous and may capture banks' unobserved characteristics that\nwould determine both this interconnectedness and banks' bidding behavior. We take\nadvantage of information on bids from multiple points in time to use within group variation to\ncontrol for individual bank effects. These panel methods help to eliminate the bias related to\nthe omission of unobserved bank characteristics. We further exploit the differences in bank\nownership, mainly focusing on state-owned banks in our OLS estimations. Due to implicit\ngovernment guarantees for state-owned banks omitted variables that reflect the health of a\nbank play less of role. With a government guarantee, a change in the perceived riskiness of a\nstate-owned bank should not impede the banks' access to the interbank market. The increased\nriskiness should not force state owned banks to borrow more extensively from the ECB.\n3.3 Variable Definitions\nAll variable definitions are displayed in Table 1. We categorize the set of dependent variables\nas Pricing; explanatory variables as `Relationship and Centrality', Bank variables\n(Accounting and Liquidity needs) and Auction characteristics as presented in our empirical\nmodel.\nOur major interest is to measure the bidding behaviour, particularly its aggressiveness, of\nbanks in repo auctions. By constructing our variables, we mainly follow the approach by\nFecht, Nyborg, and Rocholl (2011), who explain auction pricing with bank and market\ncharacteristics.\nWe employ two measures computed using the bidding data. First, we calculate the\nOverbid (Overpricing) for each bidder by subtracting the Eonia swap rate from the weighted\naverage rate bid (paid). The Overbid proxies for the willingness to pay, whereas the\nOverpricing is determined by the success of the bidding strategy, as it measures the price paid\nby bidders benchmarked by the market rate.\n3.3.2 Relationship and Centrality Measures\nWe start by borrowing measures from the relationship lending literature to identify interbank\nrelationships. Several proxies are used in empirical work to distinguish between relationship\nlenders and transactional lenders. These are the duration of the relationship between the firm\nand the bank, various loan categories, the number of creditors, and concentration of\nOngena (2008) and Degryse, Kim, and Ongena (2009) for reviews). Studies on interbank\nrelationships consider similar measures as in Furfine (2001) and Cocco, Gomes and Martins\n8 Elsas (2005) finds evidence of a strong connection between the share of financing and the probability of (self-\nassessing) being the relationship lender.\n(2009). First, we measure banks' concentration of borrowing using the largest share of\nfinancing. We compute the share as the largest amount borrowed by bank i in quarter t\nrelative to the overall amount borrowed by bank i. This measure gives us the information on\nthe asymmetry in financing and the intensity of the relationship lending. We have information\non the largest share in \"on-and off balance sheet (BS) loans\", in \"on-BS loans\", and \"in short-\nterm loans (up to one year)\". We chose to report the results using on-balance sheet exposures,\nMaxShare_onBS, as our findings are mainly similar. Our second concentration measure is the\nHerfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) that captures the entire distribution of shares.\nOur alternative measure for lending relationships is the number of lenders in the\ninterbank market. Number is defined as the lagged value of the natural log number of lenders\nobserved in on-and-off-balance sheet exposures. We also estimate our model using only on-\nbalance sheet short-term exposures in the first part of the analysis, but we report only the\nformer for brevity in the rest of our estimations. We take the lag of these measures in order to\ndeal with the differences in the frequency of data.9\nWe hypothesize that banks that cannot benefit from relationships in interbank lending\nwill turn to the primary market for their liquidity needs and bid more aggressively compared\nwith other banks. If the same mechanism operates as in bank-firm relationships, that is close\nties facilitate monitoring, then the degree of the intensity of relationships, i.e., a lower Number\nor higher MaxShare_onBS and HHI, should lead to lower bid rates. On the other hand, if for\nexample screening costs are prior to invested fixed costs, then all that matters is that there is a\nrelationship and not its intensity. The Number should have a negative impact on banks\nwillingness to pay for liquidity in the ECB's auctions.\n9 Pricing variables are measured on a weekly basis, whereas balance sheet variables are monthly, and the credit\nregister consists of quarterly data. We further take the four consecutive lags of the largest share to take the\naverage on a rolling window. Results remain unchanged.\nThese measures of interbank relationships indicate the degree of direct connectivity of a\nbank with other banks. But they do not really capture the connections with the rest of the\nsystem through banking intermediaries. With our information about all of the bilateral\nexposures among all German banks, we can construct the entire network of interbank credit\nrelations, and study not only the impact of direct but also indirect interbank lending\nTo measure the connectivity of an individual bank to the rest of the interbank network,\nwe calculate for each bank a classic centrality measure first introduced by Bonacich (1987).\nThis measure adds the number of interbank credit relationships (weighted by the amount of\nthe bilateral exposures) through which the bank is connected to every other bank in the\nsystem. A bank is more central the more interbank credit chains link it to other banks.\nConsequently, a bank is considered as more central if it is linked to other more central banks\n(see Appendix A for a more detailed description of the Bonacich centrality measure).\nObviously, the interbank network is a directed network since each credit relationship\ninvolves a borrower and a lender. We can define centrality measures for both borrowing and\nlending. A high Bonacich in centrality figure for a particular bank suggests that this bank\nborrows from many banks that are also centrally located in the network, i.e., these are lenders\nthat borrow themselves in the interbank market and borrow mostly from other banks that also\nserve as intermediaries in the interbank market. In contrast, a high Bonacich out centrality\nmeasure for a bank indicates that this bank lends heavily to banks that are themselves lending\nto those banks that function as intermediaries in the interbank market.\nAlthough the Bonacich in and out measures have distinct concepts, they are both driven\nby banks that serve as intermediaries in the interbank market. So it is not surprising that they\nhave a fairly high correlation coefficient. We use this measure because it has an interpretation\n10 See Craig and von Peter (2010) for a detailed explanation on the network structure of German banks.\nin terms of intermediation exposure (see Bonacich (1987) for other examples of flows and\nconnection that the measures illustrate.)\nWe control for bank characteristics using balance sheet variables and reserve data. To control\nfor potential size effects we use Size, defined as Log of total assets. We include\nInterbank_borrowing, defined as overall interbank borrowing to total assets, in order to\ncapture banks' dependency on funding from the interbank markets. As measures for bank\nhealth we include Equity ratio, which is based on the monthly balance sheet statistic. In\naddition, we use the ROA and NPL. However, these variables are only available on an annual\nbasis. To account for the liquidity position, we make use of the daily fulfillment of reserves\none day before the auction, normalized by the number of days left to the end of the\nmaintenance period.\nfulfill\nijp\n=\ndaily holding\nijp\ncumulative required reserves\nijp\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndays left\njp\nwhere fulfill is measured for bank i, auction j and maintenance period p. We also control for\nthe liquid assets the bank holds (as a fraction of its Total Assets), denoted as Security\nHoldings.\nIn addition, we control for due, the maturing repo amount of the previous auction divided\nby total assets of the bank. Finally, we include announced, defined as the natural logarithm of\nthe amount that the ECB announced before the MRO to allot in the auction. This should\ncapture the price and quantity expectations of the participants.\n3.4 Summary Statistics\nThe first set of (pooled) summary statistics are displayed in Table 2. We observe certain\ndistinct features of bidder banks in comparison to the entire sample. They are larger on\naverage, borrow more in the interbank market and hold a higher fraction of liquid assets. Not\nsurprisingly, bidder banks have a higher number of interbank relationships and are slightly\nmore concentrated in borrowing when the largest share is taken into account.\nTable 3 presents information on the bidding behavior and relationships over time. Mean\nbanks tend to bid below the Eonia swap rate on average. Concerning relationships, the\nvariation in Number is quite large both over time and cross-section. Concentration measures\ndo not vary much over time, while slightly increasing in the last two years.\nWe further explore the banking groups in Table 4. Commercial banks have a higher\nnumber of relationships and are also less concentrated than state-owned banks and\ncooperative banks where the latter two groups tend to have concentration measures that are\nnormally distributed.\nTable 5 reports the fixed-effects panel estimation results explaining Overbid.11 The first set of\nspecifications (the first four columns) cover the entire period from 2000 to 2008. The second\nset (starting with column 5) covers the period from 2004 to 2008, since these specifications\ninclude two new variables in the model that are only available after 2004: fulfill, daily\nfulfilment of reserves, and announced, the announced amount to be allotted before the\nauction. We focus our discussion on the second set of results since these two variables are\nimportant determinants of the liquidity needs of banks.\n11 We also estimate our model using a pooled panel. The results are unaffected.\nIn the first specifications, we investigate the impact of concentration of borrowing by\nemploying MaxShare_onBS, (the largest share in on-BS loans), Number (number of lenders\nfor all relationships) and HHI. The results are not in line with the relationship lending\nliterature, where close relationships imply a higher credit availability, which would decrease\nthe willingness to pay/bid for liquidity in this framework. Having a more concentrated\nborrowing structure or a lower number of lenders leads to a higher bid rate on average. For\ninstance, one standard deviation increase in the concentration of borrowing (number of\nlenders) increases the bid rate by 0.3 to 0.4 basis points (4.2 basis points) over the swap rate.\nThis finding suggests that banks may prefer to diversify. Having a larger number of\nrelationship lenders increases the chances that one of the lenders indeed has excess liquidity\nthat it could lend. Moreover, increasing the number of credit relationships reduces the lenders'\nmarket power. Since monitoring intensity is expected to be higher with a more concentrated\nborrowing structure, the lock-in is more severe and the lender might charge a mark-up,\ninducing her to bid also more aggressively in an ECB auctions.\nWe further take the overall interconnectedness of the nodes into account using the\nBonacich centrality measure. As described above, this measure rates how central a node is\nthrough the number of connections (weighted by the amount of bilateral exposures to other\nconnected banks). We include Bonacich in and Bonacich out measures as alternative\nmeasures to our relationship variables in the fourth specification. We find that only Bonacich\nout, measuring centrality in lending, is significantly positive in explaining Overbid. In other\nwords, being a well connected lender who lends to borrowers that are themselves central\nlenders increases the willingness to bid for a bank. This is what we would expect in terms of\nthe increased systemic risk faced by banks that are exposed to banks that are themselves\nexposed to more borrowers. Because of these central exposures, the lenders must themselves\npay a higher price for liquidity. The estimated coefficient indicates that banks with a\nsubstantial exposure to systemic risk must pay a higher risk premium when covering their\nown liquidity needs.\nIn the last three specifications, we examine the interbank position for a given borrowing\nstructure by including centrality measures together with our relationship variables. 12\nMoreover, we would like to account for multiple banking relationships with asymmetric\nfinancing since we believe that the share of financing and the number of bank relationships do\nnot necessarily capture the same characteristics of a borrowing structure.13 Therefore we\ninclude them together in Specification 9 . We also consider the fact that our alternative\nconcentration measure HHI is a function of both \"shares in financing\" and \"number of\nrelationships\". Hence we choose the model that includes HHI as our benchmark model in the\nrest of the analysis.\nMost coefficients are supporting the results in previous specifications. However, the share\nof financing is no longer significant while Number remains unaffected in this new\nspecification. Banks with a higher HHI bid higher rates in an ECB auction. The increase in\nthe willingness to pay for liquidity in the auctions due to lending to more systemically\nrelevant banks remains stable when controlling for the positive diversification effect of direct\nlending relationships. This confirms our reading that it is indeed the exposure to systemic risk\nwhy the Bonacich out matters for the banks' opportunity costs of obtaining liquidity.\nWith respect to our bank control variables we find that banks that refinance a larger share\nof their balance sheet in the interbank market pay less for liquidity. Seemingly this also\nreflects the fact that these banks have a better access to the interbank market and are less\ndependent on liquidity obtained from the ECB.14 Banks with a large portfolio of marketable\n(and thus in principle liquid) securities have a lower willingness to pay for liquidity. Rather\n12 Considering that Bonacich in and out are highly correlated as well, we reestimate the same model with the\nshare of financing and Bonacich out only. The results remain unaffected.\n13 The variables are not highly correlated.\n14 While the results are statistically less significant for the bidding behavior, they are more robust for the\noverpricing.\nthan borrowing from the ECB or in the unsecured interbank market these banks can obtain\nliquidity through asset sales or secured interbank borrowing involving no credit risk premium.\nThese results are all consistent with what we would expect from our explanation above.\nSomewhat surprising is though our finding that better capitalized and larger banks pay more\nfor liquidity. However, this can be explained in terms of an endogenous capital ratio. Riskier\nbanks might need a higher equity ratio at the same time that they pay an elevated credit risk\npremium in the interbank market. This increases their willingness to pay for liquidity in the\nauctions. There remains only one control variable that is difficult to explain. It is still puzzling\nthat banks with more non-performing loans pay less for liquidity.\nThe higher the maturing repo amount, the more aggressive the bank will bid in an\nauction. Moreover, when short in liquidity to fulfil their reserve requirements, banks place\nsignificantly higher bids. Having a concentrated borrowing structure increases this effect (see\ncolumn 9 and 10). We also include the volatility of the Eonia rate, as it potentially influences\nthe ability of anticipating the final auction outcome. This allows us to control for bid-shading\neffects that might distort the information content of a bank's submitted demand schedule\nabout its borrowing costs in the market. Indeed our results indicate that a higher uncertainty\nabout the interbank rate is associated with a higher willingness to pay for liquidity in the\nauctions. In addition, we control for the effect of the crisis, which includes the period from\nvolatility and being in the crisis period have a positive impact on the bid rate. We also interact\nthe HHI with the crisis dummy to investigate the role of borrowing relationships during the\ncrisis. The result suggests that the impact is much stronger in adverse times. More\nconcentrated borrowing increased the value of liquidity during the crisis.\n15 In July 2007, IKB announced that it had been affected by the subprime mortgage crisis in the U.S. and had to\nbe bailed out in August 2007. Hence, we take the end of July as the starting point of the turmoil in the German\nmarket.\nTable 6 presents the results explaining Overpricing, defined as a weighted average rate\npaid minus the swap rate. The results are in line with the previous finding, suggesting that\nbanks end up paying higher interest rates when they rely on concentrated borrowing.\nHowever, the centrality measure does not determine the price paid. We also note that\nOverpricing is determined by the bidding strategy and the auction outcome together. In other\nwords, while it also reflects the bidding behaviour, it is an equilibrium value and is affected\nby several factors, including the ECB's policy and other participants' bidding strategies that\nare endogenous. Thus, we believe that Overbid is a better and a cleaner measure to identify\nthe aggressiveness of the bidders related to their liquidity needs.\nIn this section, we consider a bank's decision to participate in an auction since it is very likely\nthat this decision is not random and may be determined by certain bank characteristics\nincluding banking groups. Therefore, we would like to correct for a potential selection bias by\nestimating a standard Heckman (1979) selection model. Table 7 presents our findings on both\nOverbid and Overpricing.\nStarting from this point, we use only the HHI as our relationship measure. In the first\nstage, we estimate a probit model for the decision to participate in an auction. In the second\nstage, i.e., the selected sample, we explain bidding behaviour using our benchmark model and\ninclude the inverse Mills ratio obtained from the first stage to correct for any selection bias.\nWe find that HHI and network variables do not have any influence on the decision to\nparticipate. In the second stage, before reporting the fixed effects estimations, we also report\nOLS results. The OLS approach permits us to include variables that are not varying over time,\nsuch as bank type. The German banking system consists of three pillars with commercial\nbanks, state-owned banks and cooperative banks.16 Moreover there exist several other\nsubcategories like regional banks as well. However, we would like to focus on the role of\nstate ownership due to differences in solvency risk, and include a single dummy, state-owned\nbanks, equal to one if the bank is a state-owned bank, and zero otherwise.17\nIn line with previous results, banks with a more concentrated borrowing structure bid\nsignificantly more aggressively, contradicting again the findings of studies on the importance\nof relationships in the interbank market. Centrality measures seem to matter only in fixed\neffects estimations. Bonacich in inversely affects both pricing measures, while the magnitude\nis close to zero. Bonacich out is consistent with previous results.\nLarger banks with a higher level of interbank borrowing and security holdings are more\nlikely to participate in auctions. State-owned banks are less likely to participate and tend to\nbid lower rates compared to commercial banks. Liquidity needs also play a role in the\ndecision to participate, not different than the influence on the bidding behavior. The signs and\nstatistical significance for most of the parameters in the second stage remain almost\nunchanged compared to the previous section. We find that a higher volatility in the market\nincreases the willingness to participate as well.\n4.2 State-owned banks and the crisis\nIn this section, we explore how the bank type would affect the link between interbank\nrelationships and the bidding behaviour. We follow the same approach in the previous section\nand include a dummy for state-owned banks in the model and interact it with HHI. We do so\nin order to assess the relevance of an omitted variable bias. In contrast to other banking\ngroups, state-owned banks are government guaranteed. Thus changes in their perceived credit\nrisk should not matter for their availability and pricing of interbank credit. Thus when the\n16 See Section 2 for detailed information.\n17 In a previous version of this paper, we included more subcategories, such as regional banks, savings banks,\nLandesbanken and cooperative banks. We found that main influence on the bidding behavior is determined by\nstate-owned banks.\nhealth of state-owned banks weakens it should not force the bank to rely more on its interbank\nrelationship borrower while at the same time also borrowing more extensively from the\nECB.18 The results are reported in the first two columns of Table 8. While being a state-\nowned bank mitigates the effect of concentrated borrowing on the willingness to pay before\nthe crisis, state-owned banks bid still more aggressively if they have a concentrated borrowing\nstructure. Summing up the coefficient of the interaction term and the coefficient of HHI gives\nfor both estimates an overall positive effect. Thus while possibly contributing to the\nmagnitude of our previous results an omitted variable bias cannot explain our findings\nentirely. This is further confirmed if we look at the split sample (see columns 3 & 4 and 5 &\n6, respectively). During the financial crisis when omitted variable problems should have been\nmost severe the bidding behaviour of state owned bank was not significantly differently\naffected by changes in the concentration in the borrowing structure. In addition we find that\nconcentration of borrowing has a stronger impact on Overbid during the crisis. However it no\nlonger determines the price paid in the crisis. Bonacich out, measuring centrality in lending, is\nsignificantly positive in explaining Overbid , and this effect seems to be driven by the crisis.\nThis is in line with our previous findings and consistent with the idea that centrality in lending\nmeasures a bank's exposure to systemic risk, and affects its ability to obtain liquidity. Banks\nthat are more exposed to systemic risk bid relatively more aggressively during the crisis.\n5 Conclusion\nDuring the financial crisis, several developments affected institutional structures in the\ninterbank market. The increase in counterparty risks led to a substantial rise in secured\ninterbank lending relative to uncollateralized interbank loans. The ECB temporarily decided\n18 A problem with this argument though is that because of state guarantees, relationship specific information\nabout the borrowers' quality does not play an important role. Thus we might find that relationship variables\nmatter less for state-owned banks.\nto reduce the difference in interest rates between the two standing facilities. Moreover, due to\nthe ECB's massive liquidity injections, the ECB became a major intermediary for the euro\narea interbank market. While these developments presumably reduced the risk of domino\neffects in the banking sector, their overall welfare implications are far from being fully\nunderstood. As a single example, it is still unclear to what extent these developments\nweakened market discipline in the interbank market.\nIn this paper, we try to contribute to a more profound understanding of these issues. In\nparticular, we study to what extent relationship lending prevails in the German interbank\nmarket. To our knowledge, only a few papers investigated relationship lending in the\ninterbank market so far. Cocco, Gomes and Martins (2009), for instance, find that\nrelationships affect banks' ability to borrow in the interbank market.\nWe find that having established lending relationships with many lenders in the interbank\nmarkets provides borrowers with a more diversified source for liquidity. In addition, a more\nequal distribution of borrowing across lenders also improves borrowers' diversification. Both\nfoster banks' access to liquidity and lead to lower bid rates of banks that participate in an\nECB's refinancing operations. The observation that established relationships matter for the\nprice banks pay for liquidity suggests that indeed private information available to relationship\nlenders plays an important role in the allocation of liquidity and the price banks pay for\ncovering their liquidity needs.\nWhen the network structure of the interbank market as a whole is taken into account, we\nfind that banks that lend not only to many banks but particularly to banks that themselves lend\nto many other interbank lenders tend to pay more in the ECB's auctions. This reflects that\nsystemically important banks pay a premium for liquidity. We also find some evidence that\nbanks borrowing from lenders who have a broad network of lenders pay less for liquidity,\nsuggesting also that the indirect access to liquidity through an intermediary in the money\nmarket matters with the availability of liquidity.\nReferences\nAbassi, P., F.

The\nBonacich centrality measure is defined as\nc(,) =  A * 1 * (I \u00ad A)-1 (A.1)\nwhere A is the adjacency matrix, 1 is a vector of ones, and I is the identity matrix. The\nscaling parameter is chosen to normalize the centrality measures so that their norm is the total\nnumber of nodes in the adjacency matrix for the interbank network, A. For  = 0, then c is\njust the weighted out-links centrality measure. For  increasing between 0 and 1/, where \nis the largest eigenvalue of A, the centrality measure can be interpreted as a recursion which\nputs greater weight on those nearby links which are more central, themselves. This can be\nseen in Bonacich's original definition, which explicitly uses the centrality measure of adjacent\nlinks:\nc(,) = ( + j\nc\nj\n)A\nij\nj\n\nFor  decreasing between 0 and -1/, more central banks are penalized in the centrality\nmeasure. For this paper, we report the extreme values for  = .999/, which measures the\ncentrality of banks that lend to other central banks. We follow Rodan (2011), in that we\nreport extreme values, although clearly not the most extreme value at  = 1/, where the\nmatrix (I \u00ad A)-1 would be singular.\nAlthough the original measure was designed for symmetric adjacency matrices, in our\ncase, the exposures are clearly asymmetric. So we define a separate measure of centrality,\nwhere Aij\nin the above equations are replaced with Aji\nwhich we call the in-centrality. In this\ncase, a bank is more central if it is lent to by more central banks.\nTo summarize our centrality measure, we chose a measure that was related to links, but\nalso incorporated exposures to the systemic, connected banks in the networks, to distinguish it\nfrom the aspects of relationship lending embodied in the link measures."
