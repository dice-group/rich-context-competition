There\ncould be substantial differences within societies regarding the historical events that are considered\nCorresponding author:\nSabrina de Regt, Utrecht University, Padualaan 14, 3584 CH Utrecht, The Netherlands.\nEmail: sjs.deregt@cbs.nl\nArticle\nimportant.1 Many studies have focused on how generations, each socialized under unique societal\nconditions, differ regarding their view on history (e.g. Griffin, 2004; Roberts and Lang, 1985).\nAccording to many scholars, events occurring during adolescence or young adulthood (approxi-\nmately 17\u00ad25years old) are considered the most important (Mannheim, 1952). This hypothesis \u00ad\nknown as the critical years hypothesis2 \u00ad has been very influential. This is not surprising, given its\nmajor societal implications. If generations do indeed differ significantly from each other because\nthey were socialized in different contexts, the succession of generations has the potential to change\nsocieties. In this study, we test the validity of the influential critical years hypothesis according to\nthe Dutch Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences Immigrant Panel (LISS-I panel).\nAs many other European countries have similar histories and commemoration cultures, the\nNetherlands is a representative case upon which to test the validity of the critical years hypothesis\nPrevious studies on the critical years hypothesis have been exaggerated to the point of ignoring\ncontrary development patterns (Jennings and Niemi, 1968). We therefore start this study by formu-\nlating and empirically testing hypotheses for alternative age patterns. More specifically, in addition\nto the critical years hypothesis, we test the living-in-history hypothesis,3 which predicts that all age\ncohorts living during a specific event will be influenced by this event. In contrast to the critical\nyears hypothesis, the living-in-history hypothesis does not regard the formative period as excep-\ntional. We also test the keeping-history-alive hypothesis, which predicts that all age cohorts will\nconsider a specific event important, regardless of whether they had lived through it. This age\ncohorts pattern can be expected for events that are frequently commemorated in a nation's media\nand/or educational system (Koppel, 2013).\nIn the second part of this study, we examine the importance of age, as compared to other demo-\ngraphic factors, in explaining intra-national variation in the importance attached to historical events.\nSchwartz (1999) argues that, in addition to its developmental aspects (i.e. related to age), the critical\nperiod has social aspects. The consequentiality of historical events differs from social group to social\ngroup (Brown and Kulik, 1977). Structural differences are therefore likely to occur between groups\nwith regard to the historical events that are considered important (McKeever et al., 1993). In this study,\nwe examine gender differences and differences between natives and immigrants regarding the impor-\ntance attached to historical events. Although several studies on collective memory have included such\naspects as control variables (e.g. Scott and Zac, 1993), they rarely focus explicitly on the influence of\nsuch aspects on which historical events are considered important (for notable exceptions, see, for\nexample, Schuman et al., 2003). In this study, we will test the extent to which these demographic\naspects are more strongly related to the importance attached to historical events than is age.\nThe third part of our study explores whether the validity of the critical years hypothesis is con-\nditional (i.e. whether the critical years are important only for certain groups). For example, suppose\nthat, in general, the process of women's emancipation is not more important for individuals who\nwere in their critical years during this process than it is for those who were not in their critical years\nat that time. It could be that women who were in their critical years were strongly influenced by\nthis process, while men were not. In other words, the critical years hypothesis would be valid for\nwomen, but not for men. Limiting the analysis to the general effect of the critical years might gen-\nerate biased conclusions concerning the validity of the critical years. A good overview of the valid-\nity of the critical years hypothesis requires studying its validity for different groups. Despite\nfragmented information suggesting such conditionality for the critical years hypothesis (e.g.\nJennings and Zhang, 2005), this issue has tended to be tested only sporadically and, in most cases,\nyielding only descriptive evidence. For this reason, this study includes a more systematic examina-\ntion of the extent to which the influence of critical years on the importance attached to historical\nevents depends upon educational level and gender.\nde Regt et al. 3\nFinally, our study draws upon both open-ended and closed-ended questions. The open-ended\nquestion requires the respondent to bring to mind a range of alternatives and mention only one or\ntwo, while the closed-ended question lists a number of historical events and respondents can indi-\ncate that multiple events are (equally) important. Most studies on critical years use open-ended\nquestions (e.g. Corning and Schuman, 2015). Nevertheless, it has been suggested that conclusions\nconcerning the validity of the critical years hypothesis might depend upon the type of questions\nused: the critical years hypothesis is more often confirmed using open-ended questions than closed-\nended questions (Corning and Schuman, 2015; Koppel, 2013). In order to test the validity of the\ncritical years hypothesis thoroughly, it is therefore important to employ open-ended questions as\nwell as closed-ended questions.\nIn sum, by (1) formulating and testing competing hypotheses on the relationship between age\nand the importance attached to historical events, (2) examining the importance of age relative to\nother demographic factors, (3) structurally examining the conditionality of the critical years and\n(4) employing both open-ended and closed-ended questions, this study provides deeper insight into\nthe relationship between critical years and the importance attached to historical events.\nGenerational differences and the importance of historical events\nCritical years hypothesis. The work of Karl Mannheim (1952) is often taken as a starting point for an\nenquiry involving generations. He theorized that events occurring during adolescence have more\nimpact, given their major advantage of primacy (the idea that first experiences are generally more\nimportant than subsequent experiences) and the relative openness of young adults to new events.\nSchuman and colleagues have conducted extensive study on generational differences in memories\nof public events (e.g. Schuman and Corning, 2012; Schuman and Rodgers, 2004; Schuman and\nScott, 1989). In many studies, they conclude that different generations recall different events and\nthat such memories do tend to come from adolescence and early adulthood. For example, in their\npioneering study, Schuman and Scott (1989) report that individuals who were between 16 and\n24years of age during the Second World War were more likely to identify this war as the most\nimportant event in modern history. Similar generational differences have been reported with regard\nto memories of the Vietnam War, the Iran hostage-taking and subsequent acts of terrorism, and the\nassassination of John F. Kennedy. Scott and Zac (1993) examine the importance of national and\ninternational events during a period of immense historical change: the fall of the Berlin Wall and\nthe more general collapse of communist regimes. These dramatic changes did not have the same\nimpact on older cohorts that they did on younger cohorts. The memories of older people were still\ndominated by wartime events from their youth (mainly the Second World War). Based on the\nextensive literature concerning the critical years hypothesis (see Corning and Schuman, 2015, for\na more complete overview), events are likely to be considered most important by people who expe-\nrienced them during their critical years:\nHypothesis 1a. People who experienced an event during their critical years consider this event\nmore important than do people who did not experience it during their critical years.\nLiving-in-history hypothesis. As outlined above, several studies have provided empirical evidence for\nthe critical years hypothesis. Nevertheless, other studies have reported findings that undermine the\nvalidity of this hypothesis (e.g. Corning, 2010; Jennings and Zhang, 2005). One competing hypoth-\nesis is that important events are not only those that occur during the formative years but all events\nthat individuals experience, regardless of the age at which they take place (Koppel, 2013). As\npersonally experienced events generally cause more arousal than do those that have not been\npersonally experienced, personally experienced events are likely to be considered more important\nthan other events are (Gold, 1992). The living-in-history hypothesis4 does not regard the critical\nperiod as exceptional. Such age distributions are especially likely for events that exert a particu-\nlarly strong impact on a country's day-to-day life at the time they occur (Koppel, 2013). Many\nprevious studies on the living-in-history hypothesis examined the extent to which historical events\ninfluence autobiographical memory (e.g. Brown et al., 2009). Although the focus of such studies is\nslightly different, the main idea \u00ad that public events that exerted a particularly strong impact on a\ncountry's day-to-day life at the time they occurred are important to all persons who consciously\nexperienced these events \u00ad can also be used to study the general importance attached to historical\nevents. Several studies on the importance attached to historical events have shown that an event is\nconsidered important by all citizens living at the time it occurs, and that date of birth has little or\ncitizens perceive the general reforms and openings to the outside world (from the late 1970s) as the\nmost important process of modern history, regardless of age (Jennings and Zhang, 2005). The col-\nlapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 has also been found to be equally important to all Russian immi-\ngrants in the United States. Older generations of immigrants do not differ from Russian immigrants\nwho experienced the end of the Soviet Union in their formative years (Corning, 2010). According\nto another study, memories of the Six-Day War in Israel were equally distributed across all age\ncohorts living at the time of this war (Schuman et al., 2003). These findings suggest that all age\ncohorts that consciously experience an event consider this event important and that the critical\nyears do not constitute an exceptional period in this regard:\nHypothesis 1b. People who consciously experienced an event consider this event more impor-\ntant than people who did not consciously experience the event, and people who experienced the\nevent during their critical years do not consider it more important than people who experienced\nthe event before or after their critical years.\nKeeping-history-alive hypothesis. Koppel (2013) argues the possibility of another age pattern in con-\ntrast to the critical years and living-in-history hypotheses. More specifically, some events are likely\nto be considered equally important by all age cohorts, regardless of whether they had lived through\nit. This age pattern is likely to emerge for events that are actively commemorated in the national\nmedia and/or in the educational system. In the Netherlands, for example, this age pattern could be\nexpected for the Second World War. The two national days of commemoration in the Netherlands\n\u00ad 4 May (Remembrance Day) and 5 May (Liberation Day) \u00ad were developed in direct response to\nthis war, which continues to play a central role in these two national commemorations (De Regt\net al., 2017). Moreover, knowledge about the world wars and the Holocaust has been identified as\none of the key goals of primary education in the Netherlands.5 The Second World War is thus\nactively commemorated in the Netherlands, both in the educational system and by means of annual\nnational commemorations. As a result, we might expect age cohorts in the Netherlands not to differ\nsignificantly from each other with regard to the importance they attach to the Second World War. In\nother words, we expect that if an event is actively commemorated, age cohorts that did not experi-\nence this event do not consider this event less important than cohorts that did experience the event:\nHypothesis 1c. People who consciously experienced an explicitly commemorated event do not\nconsider this event to be more important than do people who did not experience the event.\nThe relationships between age cohorts and the importance attached to events according to the\nthree hypotheses (critical years, living-in-history and keeping-history-alive) are illustrated in\nde Regt et al. 5\nInfluence of other demographic factors on the importance of historical events\nGender and the importance of historical events. It has been argued that the critical period is not only\ndevelopmental (related to age) but also social (Schwartz, 1999). In general, events that are com-\nmemorated and remembered are those that embody our deepest and most fundamental values\n(Schwartz, 1982). In other words, historical events that are important to the (group) identity of\nspecific groups are particularly likely to be remembered by members of those groups. Furthermore,\nthe impact that historical events have on personal lives can differ between groups (Bohn and\nHabermas, 2016; Zebian and Brown, 2014). Women's emancipation arguably changed the identity\nand societal position of many women. The process of emancipation changed the expectation that\nwomen should be the sole caretakers of children and housekeeping, while men were considered\nmore suitable to working outdoors. It became acceptable for women to pursue higher education,\nand they gained rights regarding their bodies and sexuality (e.g. abortion laws). The historical\nemancipation of women might thus be more important to the identity of women than it is to the\nidentity of men and therefore considered more important by the former group. Based on an open-\nended question, Schuman and Scott (1989) found that women are indeed more likely than men to\nmention women's rights as the most important change occurring the past 50years. We can there-\nfore expect women to judge the process of emancipation as more important than men do:\nHypothesis 2a: The emancipation of women is considered more important by women than it is\nby men.\nEthnicity and the importance of events.As outlined above, it has been argued that historical events\nthat are important to the identity of groups and/or have a strong impact on the personal lives of group\nmembers are particularly likely to be remembered (Bohn and Habermas, 2016; Brown and Kulik,\n1977; Zebian and Brown, 2014). We could therefore expect different ethnic groups to consider dif-\nferent historical events important. Several studies have provided evidence of differences in the ways\nin which Blacks and Whites (or immigrants and natives) view the past. For example, Schuman et al.\n(1997) report that Black respondents knew more about Rosa Parks (the Black women who protested\nracial segregation by refusing to move to the back of the bus) than White respondents did, while the\nsituation was reversed for knowledge about other historical events (e.g. the Marshall plan, the Tet\nt\nn\ne\nv\ne\no\nt\nd\ne\nh\nc\na\nt\nt\na\ne\nc\nn\na\nt\nr\no\np\nm\nI\nAge when event took place\nCrical years\nhypothesis\nLiving-in-history\nhypothesis\nKeeping-history-alive\nhypothesis\nFigue 1. Hypothetical relationship between age cohorts and the importance attached to events.\noffensive and Watergate). Other studies have also shown that race is significantly associated with\nthe likelihood of identifying the civil rights movement and the election of Barack Obama as most\nimportant event in modern history, with Blacks attaching more value to these events than Whites do\n(Corning and Schuman, 2013; Schuman and Rodgers, 2004). In this article, we examine historical\nevents related to specific ethnic groups (e.g. the decolonization of Suriname and the arrival of Turk-\nish and Moroccan guest workers), predicting that immigrants are generally more likely to consider\nthem important than native Dutch people are:\nHypothesis 2b. Events related to specific ethnic groups are considered more important by mem-\nbers of these groups than they are by natives.\nConditionality of the critical years period\nFragmented evidence exists to support the idea that the critical years are especially influential dur-\ning certain circumstances or for special groups (e.g. Schuman et al., 1997; Schuman and Scott,\n1989). For example, studies have shown that the influence of the formative period can differ by\ngender. In a study on collective memory in Russia, Schuman and Corning (2000) examine knowl-\nedge of Katya Lycheva, an 11-year-old Soviet girl who travelled to the United States during the\nCold War with the peace mission. The results indicated that girls in their formative years were\nparticularly knowledgeable about this event. Similarly, Schuman et al. (1997) demonstrate that\nmen who were young during the Tet offensive were particularly well informed about this cam-\npaign. The fact that they knew more than either women of the same age or older men can be\nexplained by the fact that young men were the most threatened during the Tet offensive, as they\nwere of military age. Less evidence exists on interactions between age and educational level.\nSchuman and Scott (1989) report no evidence of interactions between age and educational level in\nyielding memories of events. It is nevertheless plausible that the influence of the critical period\ndepends upon educational level. The critical years hypothesis predicts that events occurring during\nadolescence and young adulthood are particularly likely to be considered important. This is likely\nto be especially true for those with higher levels of education. In general, people with more educa-\ntion are more capable of recognizing the uniqueness and impact of events (Schuman and Rodgers,\n2004), and young adults with a higher level of education should thus be particularly likely to be\ninfluenced by events occurring during their formative years. In short, several studies provide evi-\ndence that the critical years hypothesis is conditional. Much of this evidence is descriptive and ad\nhoc, referring to only limited number of events. In this study, we conduct an explorative, system-\natic test of the conditionality of the critical years hypothesis on educational level and/or gender.\nMethod\nParticipants\nTo test the validity of the critical years hypothesis, we use data from the Longitudinal Internet\nStudies for the Social Sciences Immigrant Panel (LISS-I panel) administered by CentERdata\n(Tilburg University, the Netherlands). In this Dutch panel, immigrants are oversampled in order to\nallow for the reliable investigation of differences between immigrant groups in the importance\nattached to historical events. Households that would otherwise have been unable to participate in\nthe panel are provided with a computer and/or Internet connection. Panel members complete an\nonline questionnaire monthly, being paid for each completed questionnaire. Data for this study\nwere collected in April 2014. In all, 1325 individuals participated in the study, for a response rate\nde Regt et al. 7\nof 77.7%. The youngest respondent in our sample was 16years old and the oldest respondent was\nMeasures\nImportance of events. In this study, we employed an open-ended question as well as a closed-ended\nquestion to measure the importance attached to historical events. Both formats have advantages\nand disadvantages. It is known, for example, that open-ended questions are generally less leading\nand can produce unanticipated findings, while closed-ended questions are generally easier for\nrespondents to answer and respondents' answers are easier to compare (Neuman, 2012). As the\ntwo methods are related, but different, both methods were used in this study in order to study the\nimportance attached to historical events thoroughly.\nImportance of events \u00ad open-ended \u00ad The respondents first answered the open-ended question\nabout the importance of historical events: Many national and international events and changes\nhave occurred in the last 70 years. Can you list 1 or 2 events or changes which you think were\nparticularly important? Similar questions have been employed successfully in most other studies\non the critical years hypothesis (e.g. Corning and Schuman, 2015). Consistent with these studies,\nwe combined first and second mentions. This is a measure not only of recall but also of perceived\nimportance, as it can be assumed that respondents mention the events they consider to be most\nimportant. It was technically impossible for the respondents to return to this question after answer-\ning it. This method prevented any bias resulting from respondents changing their answers after\nseeing the historical events presented in the closed-ended question.\nImportance of events \u00ad closed-ended \u00ad The respondents subsequently answered the closed-\nended question on the importance of historical events: Below is a list of events and changes that\noccurred in the last 70 years. Please indicate for each event and change how important you con-\nsider this to have been (1 = not at all important and 10 = very important). If you really don't know,\nthen you can choose `?'. (1) The arrival of Turkish and Moroccan guest workers, (2) The assassina-\ntions of Pim Fortuyn and Theo van Gogh, (3) The independence of Indonesia, (4) The establish-\nment of social security (e.g. the General Old Age Pensions Act and the Social Welfare Act), (5) The\nindependence of Suriname, (6) The terrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September 2011, (7)\nThe Second World War, (8) The fall of the enclave of Srebrenica in Bosnia, (9) The fall of the\nBerlin Wall and (10) Women's emancipation/feminism. The events were presented in random\norder, thus preventing biases resulting from the sequence in which the events were presented. We\nalso consciously included important events from different historical periods. Figure 2 shows when\nthe events in question took place.\nSuch a closed-ended question has rarely been employed by studies examining the validity of the\ncritical years hypothesis. Studies that did use closed-ended questions to test the validity of the criti-\ncal years hypothesis often used knowledge measures (e.g. Janssen et al., 2008; Rubin et al., 1998).\nIn our study, however, we are interested in the importance attached to historical events. It is\nFigure 2. Chronological order of events.\npossible that people have knowledge of historical events (e.g. because of commemorations in the\nmedia and/or the educational system), but do not consider this event important. In our study, we\ntherefore chose to employ another closed-ended question to examine the importance attached to\nhistorical events. For excellent reviews of previous studies on the importance attached to historical\nevents as well as the distinction between the two question formats, the interested reader is referred\nAge-cohorts \u00ad In order to be able to test our hypotheses, we empirically distinguished between\nfour age cohorts: (1) people who did not consciously experience the event, (2) people who experi-\nenced the event before their critical years, (3) people who experienced the event during their critical\nyears and (4) people who experienced the event after their critical years. The first category \u00ad people\nwho did not consciously experience the event \u00ad consisted of people who had not been born when the\nevent occurred and people who were in early childhood. More specifically, we set the boundary at\n5years old, as in general most adults cannot remember events that happened prior to the age of 5\n(see Erikson, 1950, on the developmental stages of children and Rubin et al., 1986, on childhood\namnesia). Therefore, it can be expected that both people who had not yet been born and people aged\nunder 5years old did not consciously experience the event. In line with many previous studies (e.g.\nCorning and Schuman, 2015), we define the critical period as being between the ages of 17 and\nyears. This means that in our study, individuals who experienced an event before their critical\nyears were between 5 and 16years of age when the event occurred, and people who experienced the\nevent after their critical years were over 25years old when the event took place.6\nGender \u00ad Gender was assessed by the dummy variable `Female' (1 = female and 0 = male). In\nImmigrant status \u00ad We used five dummy variables to measure ethnicity: Turkish (5.1%),\nMoroccan (5.8%), Surinamese (4.8%), other non-Western immigrants (24.5%) and Western immi-\ngrants (26.2%). Native Dutch respondents (33.2%) were the reference category.\nProcedure\nIn this study, we first compare the validity of the critical years hypothesis to two competing age\npatterns (i.e. the living-in-history hypothesis and the keeping-history-alive hypothesis). More spe-\ncifically, we compare (1) the mean importance attached to historical events (derived from the\nclosed-ended question) across age cohorts by means of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and (2)\ndifferences across age cohorts in the percentage of mentioning a specific event (derived from the\nopen-ended question) by means of chi-square tests. Second, we compare the explanatory power of\nage to other demographic aspects (i.e. gender and ethnicity). To examine the effect of age com-\npared to gender and ethnicity using the closed-ended question on the importance of historical\nevents, we use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Logistic regression is used to analyse the\nopen-ended questions on the importance of historical events, as mentioning an event has only two\ncategories (mentioned = 1 and not mentioned = 0). We report standardized coefficients, as this\nallows us to compare the strength of the effect of age on the importance attached to historical\nevents compared to other demographic factors.7 Third, we use interaction terms to test the condi-\ntionality of the critical years hypothesis. More specifically, interaction terms are created between\nthe critical years and educational level and gender. Unfortunately, the data did not contain responses\nfrom enough immigrants to test interactions between age cohort and ethnic background.\nResults\nBefore examining the extent of variation within Dutch society, we examine which events are gen-\nerally considered most important according to respondents in the Netherlands. In Table 1, we\nde Regt et al. 9\npresent descriptive statistics on the items concerning the importance of historical events (the\nclosed-ended question) and in Table 2, we present the events that were mentioned most often as\nimportant historical events (the open-ended question).8\nAs indicated in Tables 1 and 2, the Second World War was identified as the most important his-\ntorical event by respondents in the Netherlands (according to both the open-ended and the closed-\nended question). Other events that were identified as important include the 9/11 terror attacks and\nthe fall of the Berlin Wall. Although the respondents also identified the establishment of social\nsecurity as important based on the closed-ended question (M=8.14, Min.=1, Max.=10), only a few\nrespondents (0.9%) mentioned this in the open-ended question. Another interesting difference is the\nrelatively large number of respondents mentioning the coronation of Willem-Alexander as one of\nthe most important events in history. This result is likely due to the `recency effect'(O'Connor et al.,\n2000), given that this event occurred 1year before our data were collected.\nAge and importance attached to historical events. Table 3 shows the mean importance attached to\nhistorical events (derived from the closed-ended question) for different age cohorts. As we can see,\nthe results are not in line with the critical years hypothesis. Respondents who experienced the\narrival of Turkish and Moroccan guest workers, the emancipation of women, the independence of\nSuriname, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the fall of the enclave of Srebrenica, the terrorist attacks on\nthe United States on 11 September 2011 and the assassinations of Pim Fortuyn and Theo van Gogh\nduring their critical years do not consider these events significantly more important than do people\nwho experienced these events before or after their critical years. We also see that the results regard-\ning the validity of the living-in-history hypothesis and the keeping-history-alive hypothesis are\nTable 1.

In line with the living-in-history hypothesis, we see that people who experienced the Sec-\nond World War, the independence of Indonesia, the establishment of social security, the fall of the\nBerlin Wall and the fall of Srebrenica consider these events significantly more important than do\npeople who did not consciously experience them. On the other hand, we find that people who\nexperienced the arrival of Turkish and Moroccan guest workers, the emancipation of women and\nthe independence of Suriname do not consider these events more important than do people who did\nnot experience these events. This is in line with the keeping-history-alive hypothesis.\nTable 4 displays the results of the open-ended question.Again, no evidence is found for the criti-\ncal years hypothesis. People who experienced the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the terrorist attacks\nof 9/11 and the introduction of the euro in their critical years do not consider these events signifi-\ncantly more important than do people who experienced them before or after their critical years. We\nalso see that people who experienced the collapse of the Berlin Wall consider this event more\nimportant than do people who did not experience this event. This is in line with the living-in-his-\ntory hypothesis but contradicts the general idea of the keeping-history-alive hypothesis.\nOther demographic factors and the importance of events. Next, we compare the explanatory power of\nage compared to gender and ethnicity. In Hypothesis 2a we formulated the expectation that women\nwould consider the emancipation of women more important than men would. This hypothesis is\nconfirmed by the results of the analyses, as reported in Table 5. Women consider the emancipation\nof women significantly more important than men do. Additional analyses furthermore showed that\nthe effect of gender on the importance attached to the emancipation of women is significantly\nstronger than the effect of gender on the importance attached to fall of the Berlin Wall, the arrival\nof guest workers and the fall of Srebrenica. The results in Table 5 also provide support for Hypoth-\nesis 2b that events pointing to specific ethnic minority groups are considered more important by\nmembers of these groups than they are by those of ethnic majority groups. Respondents of both\nTurkish and Moroccan background regarded the arrival of Turkish and Moroccan guest workers as\nmore important than those of Dutch background did. Similarly, respondents of Surinamese back-\nground regarded the independence of Suriname as more important than was the case for those of\nnative Dutch background.

In the theoretical section, we suggested that critical\nyears might be important only for certain groups.

Following previous studies on the critical years, we defined the formative years\nas being between the ages of 17 and 25, although the exact boundaries have been the subject of\ndiscussion (see, for example, Holmes and Conway, 1999; Schuman et al., 1998; Schuman and Corn-\ning, 2012; Schuman and Rodgers, 2004). Subsequent analyses using different boundaries for the\ncritical years did not alter our main conclusions (results available from the authors upon request).\nIn this study, we used data from the LISS-I 2014 panel to test our hypotheses, as immigrants are\noversampled in the data set. This allowed us to conduct a reliable study of the differences between\nimmigrant groups with regard to the importance attached to historical events. We used data from a\nTable 4.

This did not alter the main conclusions stated\nthis article. None of these analyses provided convincing evidence for the critical years hypothesis.\nThe tables are available from the authors upon request.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we tested the validity of the critical years hypothesis, which predicts that events\noccurring during the critical years (between 17 and 25years old) are particularly likely to be con-\nsidered important. In addition to testing the critical years hypothesis, we tested two alternative age\npatterns with regard to the importance attached to historical events. More specifically, we tested the\nvalidity of the living-in-history hypothesis and the keeping-history-alive hypothesis. The living-in-\nhistory hypothesis predicts that everyone who consciously experiences an event may consider that\nevent important and that the critical years are not an exceptional period in this regard. The keeping-\nhistory-alive hypothesis predicts that all age cohorts will consider certain events important, regard-\nless of whether they experienced them. Our results provided no substantial supportive evidence for\nthe critical years hypothesis: respondents who experienced an event during their critical years did\nTable 5.

Results regarding the living-in-history hypothesis and keeping-history-\nalive hypothesis were mixed.\nIn addition to testing different age patterns regarding the importance attached to historical\nevents, we also examined the explanatory power of age compared to other demographic factors.\nWe predicted that the process of women's emancipation was considered more important by women\nthan it was by men. This hypothesis was supported by the analyses. We also predicted that several\nevents would be considered more important by immigrants than they would by natives. This\nhypothesis was also supported by the data. In other words, gender and ethnicity were generally\nmore consistently related to importance attached to historical events than the critical period was.\nFinally, we conducted a structural examination of whether the effect of critical period is depend-\nent upon education and gender, in order to gain more insight into the conditionality of the influen-\ntial critical years hypothesis. These results also provide hardly any support for the critical years\nhypothesis.\nIn this study, we used both open-ended and closed-ended questions. Interestingly, the two meth-\nods yielded similar conclusions. The Second World War, the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the\nterrorist attacks of 9/11 were found to be regarded as the most important historical events using\nboth methods. In addition, with regard to the validity of the critical years hypothesis, the two meth-\nods resulted in similar conclusions. With regard to gender, our data showed that women considered\nalmost all historical events more important than men did, and this was especially the case with the\nclosed-ended questions. One reason could be that women are generally more likely to answer ques-\ntions in socially desirable ways (e.g. Chung and Monroe, 2003). Unfortunately, because we had no\nreliable measure of social desirability, we were unable to take this aspect into account. In future\nstudies, it would be interesting to take the aspect of social desirability into account when studying\nthe importance attached to historical events by means of closed-ended questions.\nAs outlined in the theoretical section, the Second World War is actively commemorated in the\nNetherlands, both in the educational system and by means of annual commemoration days. We\ntherefore expected people who did not experience this war to consider it equally important as did\nthose who lived through it (the keeping-history-alive hypothesis). We demonstrated that Dutch\npeople do indeed consider this war to be by far the most important event in history. Both question\ntypes revealed the Second World War to be the most important event in history. In this regard, we\ncan conclude that commemoration does indeed matter (see also Corning and Schuman, 2013, on\nTable 7. Summary of logistic regression analysis (standardized coefficients) for variables and interactions\npredicting the importance of historical events.\n9/11 Fall of Berlin wall Coronation of\nWillem-Alexander\nIntroduction of\nthe euro\nMain effects\nInteractions\nSource: own calculations LISS-I panel 2014.\nthe influence of commemorations). Yet, in line with the living-in-history hypothesis, we also found\nthat people who lived through this war consider it more important than people who did not. In other\nwords, commemorations do seem to have the potential to increase the overall level of importance\nattached to historical events, but they do not seem to cause the age patterns predicted by the keep-\ning-history-alive hypothesis.\nWhen it comes to other events, we did find evidence for the keeping-history-alive hypothesis.\nMore specifically, we found that people who experienced the arrival of Turkish and Moroccan\nguest workers, the emancipation of women and the independence of Suriname do not consider\nthese events more important than do people who did not experience these events. At the time our\ndata were collected, these events had regained a certain degree of societal relevance. At a rally held\na few weeks before our data were collected, for example, the influential right-wing politician Geert\nWilders asked his supporters whether they wanted more or fewer Moroccans in the Netherlands.\nHis followers responded by chanting `Fewer, fewer, fewer!'and Wilders concluded `Then we'll see\nto that'. His statements were met with outrage and 6400 complaints to the police followed. Wilders\nhas also argued that immigrants rarely integrate well and do not share the same attitudes towards\nliberty and equality as native Dutch people, for example, on the issue of gender equality. A very\nheated debate was also taking place about Black Pete, the `servant' of Saint Nicholas, who is por-\ntrayed using controversial blackface make-up during Saint Nicholas celebrations on 5 December.\nPeople from countries who were exploited for slavery, such as Suriname, are prominent opponents\nof blackface. In the light of these societal developments, the arrival of Turkish and Moroccan guest\nworkers, the emancipation of women and the independence of Suriname had once again become\nvery relevant and important events for contemporary Dutch society. In other words, it seems that\nthe age pattern predicted by the keeping-history-alive hypothesis can be explained not by com-\nmemorations but by the (renewed) relevance of events in current society.\nThe results for several events were in line with the living-in-history hypothesis: the Second\nWorld War, the independence of Indonesia, the establishment of social security, the fall of the\nBerlin Wall and the fall of Srebrenica. It can be argued that most of these events exerted a particu-\nlarly strong impact on Dutch society at the time they occurred. With the exception of the fall of the\nBerlin Wall, all of the events are included in the Dutch canon, which includes the most influential\nevents in Dutch history (see, for example, Van Oostrom, 2007 for more information on Dutch his-\ntory and this canon). The fall of the Berlin Wall is not mentioned in the canon as it was not a Dutch\nevent.Yet, given the shared economic, social and political histories of Germany and the Netherlands\n\u00ad being neighbouring countries \u00ad the fall of the Berlin Wall also influenced Dutch society substan-\nIn sum, our findings suggest that when events exerted a strong influence on society at the time\nthey occurred, an age pattern consistent with the living-in-history hypothesis can be observed, and\nwhen events gain renewed societal importance, we see an age pattern consistent with the keeping-\nhistory-alive hypothesis. It seems that the societal importance of an event outweighs the influence\nof an individual's age when it occurred. More studies that investigate different events in different\ncontexts are needed in order to understand the exact reasons for age differences in the importance\nattached to historical events. Using additional methods besides survey data might enhance our\nunderstanding of the relation between age and the importance attached to historical events. In-depth\ninterviews, for example, could tell us more about why different age cohorts consider different\nevents to be important (see also Corning and Schuman, 2015, who used survey data to investigate\nwhy people feel that historical events are important).\nSeveral of the major theories on generations are based on Mannheim's observations on criti-\ncal years, including the influential theory on post-materialism developed by Ronald Inglehart\n(1971). He postulated that many societies were undergoing a transformation of individual\nvalues, switching from materialist values (which emphasize economic and physical security) to\npost-materialist values (which emphasize autonomy and self-expression). Generational replace-\nment was argued to be one of the main drivers of this value change. In this study, we tested the\nvalidity of the critical years hypothesis for a wide range of events from different historical\nperiods, using different methods (open-ended and closed-ended questions) and different sam-\nples. The results yield very little evidence to support the idea that people consider events occur-\nring during their critical years more important or influential than they do events occurring when\nthey are younger or older. This obviously does not negate the utility of such theories. According\nto our analyses, however, societal change resulting from the disappearance of older generations\nand the entrance of new generations might be slower than such general theories on generations\nmight predict. Although differences will remain between age cohorts in terms of attitudes,\nbeliefs and behaviours resulting from the events they have experienced, such differences are\nless likely to be restricted to experiences stemming from their formative years.\n"
