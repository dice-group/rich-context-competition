    "abstract": "Abstract\nNon- echnical ummary\nSection 340g of the German Commercial Code ('HGB') allows banks to build visi-\nble reserves for general banking risks (henceforth: GBR reserves). Obviously, these\nvisible reserves are meant to take account of any kind of general risks banks may\nbe exposed to. They have to be disclosed as a separate item on the liability side\nof the balance sheet and their allocation is clearly visible from the profit and loss\naccount. They are acknowledged as tier 1 capital and the decision to set them aside\nis taken by the bank's management. In addition to their risk provisioning function,\nthese visible reserves may also be used to enhance capital endowment, for internal\nfinancing and for signaling purposes.\nWe analyze the financial statements of German banks for the period from 1995\nthrough 2007 to reveal specific patterns in the use of GBR reserves. We explain our\nfindings with regulatory aspects and existing information asymmetries as well as the\nsize and the ownership structure of banks. Our results are as follows:\n\u00b7 Larger banks are more likely to use visible GBR reserves, and they also hold\na higher percentage of these reserves relative to their total assets. The same\nholds for banks with low regulatory capital endowment and for banks which\nare already using hidden reserves according to section 340f HGB.\n\u00b7 Banks subject to public law make use of GBR reserves less often and to a\nsmaller extent. The same relationship is found for banks with higher risks in\ntheir loan portfolios, i.e. for banks with relatively high non-performing loan\nratios.\n\u00b7 Banks with a higher return on assets and banks under IFRS tend to build GBR\nreserves more often and to a greater extent.\n\u00b7 Both the share of banks making use of GBR reserves and the ratio of these\nreserves to total assets increase over time. This almost monotonic trend is con-\nfirmed even when controlling for all other relevant factors in panel regressions.\nt s\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nDas deutsche Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB) erlaubt Kreditinstituten die Bildung eines\nFonds f\u00a8\nur allgemeine Bankrisiken nach \u00a7 340g.

These 'GBR reserves' may, in\naddition to their risk provisioning function, be used to enhance capital endowment,\nfor internal financing, signaling or earnings management purposes. We analyze fi-\nnancial statements of German banks for the period from 1995 through 2007 to reveal\nspecific patterns in the use of GBR reserves. Our empirical investigation is based on\na large, unbalanced panel of German banks including 32,023 bank-year observations.\nWe see an increase in the use of GBR reserves over time. Furthermore, we can say\nthat GBR reserves are primarily used by large banks, banks with comparatively low\nregulatory capital endowment, as well as those with lower risks. Furthermore, GBR\nreserves are used by fairly profitable banks, those reporting according to interna-\ntional financial reporting standards in addition to HGB, and banks which are not\nthrifts or cooperative banks. Finally, we find that banks which make use of hidden\nreserves according to section 340f HGB also tend to hold GBR reserves. We explain\nour findings with regulatory factors and existing information asymmetries as well as\nbanks' size and ownership structure.\nKey Words: Bank regulation, informational asymmetries, risk provisioning, visible\nreserves, hidden reserves.\n Introduction\nBanks are considered to be fairly opaque and intransparent institutions compared\nto many other industries.1 Insight into and understanding of the banking business is\nnot widespread among the public. Existing bank-specific accounting rules certainly\ndo much to add to this image. These special norms and the consequent lack of trans-\nparency in banks' financial reporting are justified by the particular kinds and levels\nof risk banks are exposed to. Confidence in and the stability of the banking sector\nare deemed to be vital for the well-being of the world's economies. This becomes\neven more evident when looking at the turmoil caused by the recent financial crisis.\nTo achieve financial stability and to foster confidence, on the one hand, regulatory\nbodies impose certain restrictions on the amount of risky assets held by banks in\nrelation to their capital resources.2 On the other hand, legal bodies generally allow\nthe building of reserves and loss provisions within banks' financial statements.\nThe German Commercial Code ('HGB') in particular contains two unique but very\ndifferent instruments permitting banks to build reserves. Firstly, section 340f HGB\nallows specified financial assets to be deliberately undervalued within certain lim-\nits. This is often referred to as creating hidden reserves (for simplicity called '340f\nreserves' hereinafter). Secondly, a bank may increase its visible reserves, so called\n'Reserves for General Banking Risks' in accordance with section 340g HGB (for sim-\nplicity called 'GBR reserves' hereinafter). These two types of reserves differ greatly\nwith respect to their visibility on the balance sheet. Thus, banks may use them\nfor very different reasons. Whereas the creation of hidden reserves has a very long\ntradition for German banks, GBR reserves, which are the main focus of this paper,\nwere not introduced into German law until 1993.\n340f reserves certainly contribute to the perceived opaqueness of banks, as they un-\ndermine the pre- and post-decision information functions of accounting regulations.3\nTo some extent, this also holds for GBR reserves. They are visible, but to external\nobservers it is not obvious whether they represent existing risks or whether they\nwere just built as part of the bank's earnings management or as a signaling device.\nFurthermore, they may also have been built to enhance capital endowment and for\ninternal financing purposes. However, these aims can also partly be achieved by\nother means, for instance (hidden) 340f reserves, retaining earnings, or by raising\nnew equity.\n2 In this context we refer to the rules of BCBS (2006) (henceforth Basel II ) which, for instance, have been\ntransformed into German law via the German Solvency Regulation since 2007/01/01.\n3 For a closer look at the information functions of accounting cf. Beaver/Demski (1979), pp. 43-45.\nIt is especially interesting to examine the use of GBR reserves, since they were not\nintroduced into German banking legislation voluntarily. Rather, the legislator was\nforced to do so during adoption of the EC Bank Accounts Directive in 1986, since\nGermany continued to allow the creation of hidden reserves according to section\n340f HGB. We are therefore mainly addressing two research questions in this paper.\nFirstly, we examine what factors determine the probability of a bank making use of\nGBR reserves. For this analysis, the level of GBR reserves is therefore irrelevant as\nlong as it exceeds zero. In a second step, we identify key factors that account for the\namount of GBR reserves that have been built. To this end, we analyze the evolution\nof the precise level of this balance sheet item at bank level over time, controlling for\nthe influence of variables such as the category a bank belongs to, its size and other\ncharacteristics such as regulatory capital endowment and the level of risk a bank\nis exposed to. Regulatory constraints as well as concepts focusing on informational\nasymmetries (such as the Pecking Order Theory) help to provide explanations for\nour findings and enable us to identify key factors responsible for the use of GBR\nreserves.\nOur empirical analysis is based on a large, unbalanced panel of 4,916 German banks\nderived from the Deutsche Bundesbank's BAKIS database. It covers the period\nfrom 1995 through 2007, yielding a considerable number of bank-year observations\n(32,023). Our findings are clearly consistent with the predictions implied by informa-\ntion asymmetry outlined above. We see an increase in the use of GBR reserves over\ntime. Furthermore, we can say that GBR reserves are primarily used by large banks,\nbanks with comparatively low regulatory capital endowment, as well as those with\nlower risks. Furthermore, GBR reserves are used by fairly profitable banks, those\nreporting according to international financial reporting standards in addition to\nHGB, and banks which are neither thrifts nor cooperative banks. Finally, we find\nthat banks that make use of hidden reserves according to section 340f HGB also\ntend to hold GBR reserves.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we review related\nliterature. Section 3 introduces the legal framework, whereas Section 4 presents\nmotives for (not) using GBR reserves. Moreover, the informational perspective on\nthe use of those reserves is evaluated and some practical issues surrounding the\ndecision-making process for building GBR reserves are discussed. Section 5 presents\nthe data set and the results of our empirical analysis. Finally, Section 6 provides\nsome concluding remarks.\n2 Related Literature\nTo the best of our knowledge, no empirical analysis of GBR reserves has been con-\nducted from the perspective of the economics of information. However, risk provi-\nsioning in general as well as bank loan-loss accounting in particular have been widely\ndiscussed in the past.\nDespite major differences between GBR reserves and loan-loss accruals (namely the\nfact that GBR reserves are, unlike loan-loss accruals, not associated with credit risk),\nliterature on loan-loss provisioning is still most closely related to our analysis. At\nan international level, several papers examine loan-loss provisioning empirically.\nfects of the announcement by Citicorp and other U.S. money-center banks that they\nwould increase loan-loss reserves for third world loans on the stock prices of those\nbanks. They find heterogeneous evidence among the banks. Docking et al. (1997)\nstudy differences in the contagion effects of bank loan-loss reserve announcements\nbetween money-center and regional banks in the USA for the period from 1985 to\n1990. Surprisingly, they find negative announcement effects as well as contagion ef-\nfects between regional banks. Ahmed et al. (1999) find strong support for loan-loss\nprovisions being used for capital management only. Wall/Koch (2000) review theo-\nretical and empirical evidence on bank loan-loss accounting. To do so, they take very\ndifferent perspectives on bank regulation and capital management. Laeven/Majnoni\n(2003) fathom the relationship between loan-loss provisioning and overall economic\nslowdowns. Recently, Anandarajan et al. (2007) found that Australian banks use\nloan-loss provisions for capital management.\nAnother important strand of literature mainly focuses on earnings management\nand its ties to bank loan-loss provisioning. Scheiner (1981) uses data from 107 U.S.\nbanks for the period from 1969 through 1976 but does not detect a correlation be-\ntween provision allowances and proxies for a bank's good or bad years. By contrast,\nGreenawalt/Sinkey (1988) find significant evidence for earnings management among\nU.S. banks. More recently, Bhat (1996), by analyzing a panel of U.S. banks from\n1981 through 1991, finds that low-growth banks with a high loans to deposits ratio\nand high leverage are more likely to carry out income smoothing. Lobo/Yang (2001)\nanalyze bank managers' decisions on discretionary loan-loss provisions to smooth in-\ncome and to manage capital requirements. Shrieves/Dahl (2003) take a closer look\nat the use of loan-loss provisions by Japanese banks during a period of financial\nduress and find evidence for earnings and regulatory capital management. Subse-\nquently, Kanagaretnam et al. (2004) find bank managers using loan-loss provisions\nas a means of communicating private information about the bank's future prospects.\nFurthermore, they find this propensity to be greater if a bank is performing badly\nand if it is undervalued. Last but not least, Fonseca/Gonz\u00b4\nloss provisions as a tool for income smoothing in a cross-country study and find the\nextent of income smoothing to be lower in countries with effective supervision.\nSince sections 340f and 340g HGB are specific German rules, most of the existing pa-\npers that deal with these sections merely discuss institutional and legal issues related\nto the German banking market and the underlying accounting system. Shortly\nafter their integration into German banking legislation in 1993, Waschbusch (1994)\nillustrated the main features of visible reserves. He argues that particularly inter-\nnationally operating German banks will increasingly use GBR reserves to improve\ntheir standing. Following up, Emmerich/Reus (1995) are the first to discuss visible\nand hidden reserves from a mainly informational perspective, while also showing\naccounting implications for banks' management in Germany.\nLooking at the German banking market, so far only Wagener et al. (1995) have\ntaken an empirical perspective, but that is limited to the year 1993. They study 125\nfinancial statements and 35 group financial statements. However, they do not focus\non the use of risk provisions but rather analyze all positions on the banks' balance\nsheets and profit and loss accounts. With respect to GBR reserves, their focus is on\ndescribing how many banks already held such reserves in the year they were first\nimplemented (1993). They do not try to explain their findings using informational\naspects as we shall do in the following.\nOur paper contributes to the literature in several ways. Firstly, we analyze the\nfinancial statements of a panel of 4,739 German banks, the largest sample examined\nso far. The analysis covers the period from 1995 through 2007, yielding a considerable\ntime series of up to 13 accounting years for each bank. Most importantly, by relating\nour empirical results to accounting and regulatory properties as well as informational\naspects of GBR reserves, we are able to test a number of hypotheses which shed light\non some serious agency issues.\n3 Legal Framework\nThe item on the liability side of banks' balance sheets called 'Reserves for General\nBanking Risks' is a direct consequence of the EC Bank Accounts Directive of 1986,\nof this directive, members of the EC that continued to allow their banks to build\nhidden reserves (e.g. Germany through section 340f HGB) had to enable disclosure\nof GBR reserves as well.4 The aim was to create a counterweight to the permission\nto create hidden reserves and thus to increase pressure on banks to turn away from\na policy of minimum disclosure.5\nThe creation of hidden reserves has a long tradition in Germany. Though this type\nof reserves is not the main focus of our paper, an awareness of the major differences\nas compared to GBR reserves is important for understanding the central arguments\nset out in the rest of the paper. 340f reserves are formed by deliberately undervaluing\nloans and certain securities designated the so-called `liquidity reserve' according to\nHGB. 340f reserves are referred to as hidden because their use is not apparent from\nthe balance sheet or income statement. The decision to undervalue these assets is\nin the hands of the bank's management alone. However, 340f reserves are limited\nto 4% of the overall value of the relevant financial assets before the undervaluation\ntakes place. They have to be eliminated when filing the tax statement, hence they\ndo not influence the bank's tax payments.\nUnder the leading international financial accounting regimes IAS/IFRS and US-\nGAAP6, there is no corresponding rule, i.e. hidden reserves cannot be created in\nthe same way. However, IAS 30.50 - which was still effective until the end of 2006 \u00ad\nallowed the disclosure of reserves for general banking risks.\nThe funding and release of GBR reserves have to be shown in separate items of banks'\nincome statements. Their variation within one year is visible from the balance sheets\nand the amount built during a year is shown in the income statement.7 According to\nsection 340g HGB, the amount of reserves must be 'reasonable'. It is not restricted to\nany particular level as long as it does not yield negative net income after raising GBR\nreserves. Similar to 340f reserves, the funding of GBR reserves does not influence\ntax payments. In a regulatory context, they are treated as tier 1 capital according\n6 For the sake of simplicity, we will, from now on, talk of 'IFRS accounting' when referring to IAS/IFRS or\nUS-GAAP, since if a bank in our sample uses these accounting rules in addition to HGB, the vast majority\ndoes so by means of IAS/IFRS accounting.\n7 However, if a bank chooses to convert hidden reserves into visible ones, the conversion does not affect the income\nstatement. In such a case, the level of GBR reserves increases on the balance sheet, while the corresponding\nitem on the income statement remains unchanged.\nto section 10 Section 2a of the German Banking Act ('KWG'), while, by contrast,\n340f reserves are merely recognized as tier 2 capital. The higher quality of regulatory\ncapital assigned to visible reserves can be regarded as another incentive to increase\ncorporate disclosure.8\nThe decision on whether or not to fund or release GBR reserves is entirely at the\ndiscretion of the bank's management. Approval by shareholders is not needed to\nbuild GBR reserves. These reserves must not be dedicated to covering the risks\narising from certain specified assets. GBR reserves display key features of equity\n(economically speaking). However, from a purely legal point of view, they have to\nbe reported separately on a bank's balance sheet.\n4 Theoretical Background\n4.1 Motives for (Not) Using GBR Reserves\nSince the aim of financial accounting is to provide information, we adopt the in-\nformation content approach in this paper.9 Clearly, information given via financial\nstatements can be useful in a pre- and a post-decision manner. On the one hand, dis-\nclosure of accounting information will help potential investors and depositors when\ncoming to an investment decision (pre-decision information function). On the other\nhand, financial accounting helps mitigate agency problems between bank managers\nand existing investors (post-decision information function). Informational aspects\nplay a leading role in understanding why management may prefer to build GBR re-\nserves rather than using other instruments that fulfill similar functions. Since bank\nmanagers are the ones to choose, we will predominantly take their perspective as\nthe basis for our evaluation.\nMost intuitively, GBR reserves are a means of risk provisioning and internal cap-\nital accumulation to cover general banking risks. German banks can also achieve\nthese aims by creating hidden 340f reserves or by retaining earnings. At least theo-\nretically, raising new equity may be a third alternative to cover unforeseen risks.\nAs they are hidden, 340f reserves may help hide a bad signal from potential in-\nvestors.10 As a result of informational asymmetries between investors and the bank's\nmanagement, increasing visible GBR reserves may be regarded as evidence of a risen\nrisk level at the bank. For short, we will refer to this as the 'bad risk signal' below. In\nother words, building visible reserves may lead to a loss of confidence in the bank's\neconomic prosperity. Hence, potential capital suppliers may refrain from investing\nin the company. However, this bad signaling effect is likely to vanish over time as\nmore and more banks use GBR reserves.\nIn addition, it is important to note that the bad risk signal is of different relevance\nfor different types of institution. Firstly, money-center banks are not exposed to this\nsignaling effect to the same extent as smaller ones. This is because the economic\nwell-being of large banks is assumed to have a huge impact on the stability of the\nwhole financial system. Bankruptcy or illiquidity of such an institution is likely to\ncause severe uncertainty regarding the safety of bank deposits. Therefore, money-\ncenter banks are often held to be 'Too Big To Fail' (TBTF), since governmental\n10 Disregarding all informational considerations for a moment, the existing limit on the amount of 340f reserves\n(to 4% of the valuation basis) may present a material drawback with respect to all functions. Confidential\nstatements from practitioners, however, suggest that this is not really a binding restriction.\ninstitutions are supposed to support ailing banks to avoid financial instability.11\nSecondly, banks subject to public law (for simplicity also called 'public banks' here-\ninafter), e.g. thrifts as well as federal and state banks, may also not be exposed to\nthis bad signal to the same extent as privately owned banks. Maintenance obliga-\ntion ('Anstaltslast') and guarantee obligation ('Gewaehrtraegerhaftung') formerly\nin place in Germany basically eliminated all likelihood of such banks becoming\nbankrupt or illiquid. Maintenance and guarantee obligations, which had been an\nimportant characteristic of the German banking market for a long time, had to be\nabolished in 2005 because they did not comply with European competition regula-\ntions. However, the consequences for the risk provisioning signal effects are still in\nplace, especially because debt issued before 2005 is still protected.\nRetaining earnings also serves the risk provisioning function. In terms of the decision-\nmaking process within the bank, managers may, however, prefer to increase GBR\nreserves. Shareholders' or owners' approval is essential for retaining earnings and also\nfor releasing them. Managers intending to use earnings to cover general banking risks\ncannot be certain that the owners will not choose to distribute them. Consequently,\nthey may prefer to use their discretionary powers to build visible or hidden reserves\ninstead. In other words, building these reserves deprives owners of their right to\ndecide on the appropriation of what would otherwise become the bank's equity. Since\ninvestors may anticipate this behavior, increasing GBR reserves may represent a bad\nsignal stemming from informational asymmetries. Building reserves may indicate\nthat bank managers are uncertain of obtaining shareholders' approval for retaining\nearnings, since there may be more profitable investment alternatives (with a similar\nrisk level). If so, the owners will try to extract money by claiming a higher dividend.\nDue to their informational head start, the insiders' conceivable skepticism about the\nbank's prospects can be seen as a bad signal to outside investors. In the following, we\nwill refer to this as a bad 'management signal' for short. Based on insiders' behavior,\nother capital market participants may be reluctant to invest money in the company.\nNevertheless, this bad signal may also disappear over time with the increasing use of\nGBR reserves. Like the bad risk signal outlined above, this bad signal is also much\nless relevant for banks subject to public law. Their specific ownership structure,\nwith municipal and state authorities as owners, makes them virtually independent\nof equity markets. There is no need to attract new shareholders and mechanisms of\nstock market valuation do not apply to this type of bank. Their owners, too, may\nprefer to have more rather than less profits available for redistribution.\n11 For more details on first evidence for TBTF policy used by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in\nto demonstrate that TBTF does not hold. The disruptions following the default, however, were such that\ngovernments all over the world officially acknowledged TBTF by assuring they would rescue any bank relevant\nto the financial system.\nThe theory of corporate control comes into play here. It is well proven that com-\npanies with only a few (possibly large and influential) owners are monitored more\nclosely than companies featuring a disperse ownership structure.12 Monitoring helps\nto reduce informational asymmetries between a bank's management and its share-\nholders. In Germany, banks subject to public law (mainly thrifts and federal state\nbanks) are usually owned by a small number of cities or municipalities, whereas\nownership of private and especially incorporated banks is usually widespread. Man-\nagers of closely monitored banks may prefer to make use of hidden 340f reserves\nrather than the visible alternative to avoid the bad management signal and pre-\nvent shareholders from demanding the distribution of profits. Combining this line\nof argument with the ones for the risk and the management signal yields conflicting\npredictions in terms of the choice between visible and hidden reserves for banks\nsubject to public law. On the one hand, they may not be exposed to the bad risk\nand the bad management signal and therefore make use of GBR reserves. On the\nother hand, their managers may be closely monitored, resulting in the primary use\nof hidden 340f reserves. The question as to which of these two effects outweighs the\nother will be the subject of our empirical analysis in Section 5.\nIn terms of raising new equity as a means of risk provisioning, the main conclusions\nhave to be taken into account. In short, companies prefer internal finance to debt\nand equity issuance. Once more, the basis for this theory are informational asymme-\ntries between the management of and potential investors in a company. If managers\nbelieve a company to be undervalued, they will not raise new equity for financing\npurposes because investors will need to pay less than the company is worth. Con-\nversely, managers who believe that their company is overvalued will likely issue stock\nsince investors will pay more than the company's value. Thus, the attempt to sell\nstock typically shows that a company is overvalued. Therefore issuing equity sends a\nworse signal about the managers' beliefs to capital markets than raising funds inter-\nnally. This may result in managers' preference for increasing GBR or 340f reserves\nor retaining earnings rather than issuing equity.\nBesides risk provisioning, increasing GBR reserves can also be used as a way of\ninternal financing and cash flow management. The level of earnings available\nfor distribution to owners (dividends, say) is lowered by building reserves. Thus,\nfree cash flow does not leave the bank but is instead at management's disposal for\nfinancing new projects.13 Creating 340f reserves may again be a wise alternative to\nusing GBR reserves from the management's point of view, since doing so will not\n12 Cf. Levine (2004), who comments on special features of corporate governance in banks.\nimpact on a firm's value.\nsend a bad risk or management signal to capital markets. This line of argument\nalso holds for retaining earnings, which likewise avoids conflicts in closely monitored\nbanks. However, in this case, management cannot decide about the development of\nretained earnings and therefore has to convince shareholders to supply funds.\nA bank's management may also decide to deliberately use GBR reserves as a sig-\nnaling device to reduce any informational asymmetries between themselves and\nthe bank's owners or depositors. Building these reserves shows that the bank is in a\neconomically strong position and that it is generating sufficient profits to build GBR\nreserves. We will from now on refer to this as the 'signal of strength' for short. This\ninterpretation of course runs counter to the effect, outlined above, whereby GBR\nreserves act as a bad risk signal. Which of the two effects outweighs the other is the\nsubject of our empirical analysis. The signal of strength may even be intensified by\nachieving a constant rise in GBR reserves as shown on the balance sheet over time.\nConfidential statements from practitioners indeed prove this to be an important\nmotive for which the profitability of a bank is certainly a key factor.\nIn terms of use as a signaling device, retaining earnings is the only valuable alterna-\ntive to building GBR reserves. It shows that the bank is generating sufficient profits\nand is in good shape. Boosting the equity ratio by retaining earnings avoids the bad\nrisk signal incurred by funding GBR reserves.\nCreating hidden 340f reserves is not an alternative in this context, since their level\nis not visible to external observers and capital markets. Banks are, of course, free\nto disclose the volume of hidden reserves they hold within the notes to the financial\nstatement. However, hardly any bank does so. Issuing new equity \u00ad if deemed to have\nany signaling effect at all in this context \u00ad is fairly counterproductive. According to\nPecking Order Theory, issuing new equity is a clear sign that management believes\nthe company to be overvalued. Such an overvaluation may stem from capital markets\noverestimating the bank's future earnings potential. Therefore, the wish to raise new\nequity will certainly reveal this error of judgment.\nAny kind of reserves may be used as a tool for earnings management. Bank man-\nagers often aim at assuring their stockholders a stable or \u00ad preferably \u00ad a slightly\ngrowing annual dividend. An increase in the regular annual dividend is usually\ninterpreted by investors as a sign of management's confidence in future earnings\nprospects. Therefore, stock prices and the company's value are likely to rise follow-\ning an increase in dividends.14 Obviously, this motive is closely connected to the\naforementioned use of GBR reserves as a signaling device.\n14 For further details, cf. the basic dividend model developed by Lintner (1956) and further research by\nIn terms of earnings management, the only reasonable alternative to creating GBR\nreserves is to use hidden 340f reserves. In years of economic well-being, profits will\nsuffice to distribute stable or slightly growing dividends. At the same time, bank\nmanagement may deliberately undervalue assets within the given limits (accord-\ning to section 340f HGB). These undervaluations can be reversed in economically\nbad periods to achieve dividend stability. Again, the bad management signal may\nbe avoided by using 340f rather than GBR reserves. Using retained earnings influ-\nences declared profits rather than net income and is thus inappropriate for earnings\nmanagement purposes. Raising new equity does not have any impact at all in this\ncontext.\nHaving introduced some aspects that are mainly driven by informational asymme-\ntries, some practical issues potentially driving the use of GBR reserves must not\nbe disregarded. Most closely connected to the aforementioned risk provisioning is a\nbank's need to enhance its regulatory capital endowment. Under Basel II and\nthe German Solvency Regulation, banks have to hold a certain amount of capital\nin relation to their risk-weighted assets. GBR reserves are acknowledged as tier 1\ncapital and can therefore help eliminate regulatory capital shortages.\nWith respect to boosting the tier 1 capital endowment, retaining earnings and raising\nnew equity are equivalent options to an increase in GBR reserves. A bank may also\ninfluence its regulatory capital endowment by reducing its risk-weighted assets, of\ncourse. However, we ignore this because it is related to changes on the asset side\nof the balance sheet, which we are not looking at. With respect to tier 1 capital\nendowment, 340f reserves are not equivalent because they are recognized as tier 2\ncapital only.\nAchieving an increase in a bank's tier 1 capital endowment by retaining earnings\navoids both bad signals described above stemming from a rise in GBR reserves.\nAnother alternative is to raise new equity. However, the line of argument concerning\nthe Pecking Order Theory (as mentioned before) holds here, too.\nMoreover, the obligation to disclose hidden 340f reserves when preparing financial\nstatements according to IFRS in addition to HGB (we will henceforth simply call\nsuch banks 'IFRS banks') may be another motive for using GBR reserves. Whereas\nbuilding hidden reserves is explicitly allowed under HGB accounting, IFRS prohibit\nthis. Consequently, if a German bank wishes or has to prepare its (group) financial\nstatements according to IFRS, it must disclose its former 340f reserves. Doing so\nin its HGB unconsolidated financial statements as well may then be beneficial for\ntwo reasons. Hidden reserves are revealed within the IFRS accounts, so they partly\nlose their latent characteristics anyway. However, it is unclear whether the extent\nof hidden reserves becomes fully evident when transferring HGB accounts to IFRS\ndue to the different categories of financial instruments and the different valuation\nrules. Nevertheless, we deem this aspect to be important. Furthermore, getting rid\nof hidden reserves is one step towards eliminating costly parallel book keeping.\nThe bank may also decide to disclose hidden reserves by putting these funds into\nretained earnings rather than increasing GBR reserves. Showing these disclosed re-\nserves as profits and distributing them to the owners of the bank is another option\nfor management. Since this distribution serves neither financing nor risk provisioning\npurposes, it will not be discussed in any further detail.\nTable 1 summarizes the most important results of our theoretical considerations.\nGBR\nreserves\nearnings\nnew equity\nrisk\nprovisioning\nvisible invisible visible\nfinancing no capital outflow capital inflow\nearnings\nmanagement\nvisible invisible n/a\nregulatory\ncapital\nuse in IFRS possible n/a possible n/a\ndecision-\nmaking\nby management by shareholders\nsignals bad risk and\nmanagement\nsignals, good\nsignal of\nstrength\nnone good signal of\nstrength\nbad signal\naccording to\nPecking Order\nTheory\nTable 1: Evaluation of GBR reserves and the alternatives.\nStarting from theoretical considerations, we arrive at the following hypotheses. To\nsimplify and enhance understandability, we will phrase the hypotheses in an eco-\nnomically rather than a statistically correct manner.\nH 1: The size of a bank has a positive impact on the management's decision to use\nGBR reserves.\nThis hypothesis refers to the fact that the bad risk signal from using GBR reserves\nmay not be as important for money-center banks as for smaller institutions. When\na large bank experiences financial distress, intervention by government authorities\nis very likely according to the TBTF theory.\nH 2: Being a bank subject to public law has an impact on the use of GBR reserves.\nThe particular ownership structure of public banks makes them less vulnerable to\neither of the two bad signals caused by GBR reserves. However, the fact that banks\nsubject to public law are usually owned by a small number of cities or municipalities\nmeans these banks are subject to a higher level of monitoring. Consequently, their\nmanagement may decide to use hidden 340f rather than GBR reserves as outlined\nabove. Which of those two effects outweighs the other is the subject of our empirical\nanalysis.\nH 3: The use of GBR reserves increases over time.\nThe more banks use visible reserves, the more the bad risk signal as well as the\nbad management signal will diminish. So we expect to see a continuous rise in the\nnumber of banks using GBR reserves as well as in the aggregate size of GBR reserves\nH 4: The risk level of a bank has an impact on the decision to use GBR reserves.\nSince GBR reserves are meant to prevent general banking risks, a bank's risk level\nwill presumably have an impact on their use. Hence, we expect to see a positive\ncorrelation. By contrast, high-risk banks may be in such financial distress that they\ncannot fund reserves. Accordingly, we cannot hypothesize in advance whether a high\nrisk level has a positive or a negative impact on the management's decision to fund\nGBR reserves.\nH 5: The regulatory capital endowment has a negative impact on the use of GBR\nreserves.\nUnder the German Banking Act, GBR reserves are recognized as tier 1 capital.\nTherefore, banks that are short of regulatory capital may prefer to build GBR rather\nH 6: Being a bank that publishes its statements according to IFRS as well as HGB\n('IFRS banks') has a positive impact on the use of GBR reserves.\nIFRS accounting does not allow for hidden reserves to be built as under section 340f\nHGB. Therefore, we would expect IFRS banks to convert hidden reserves into the\nvisible alternative upfront, and we anticipate a strong correlation between the use\nof GBR reserves and preparing financial statements according to IFRS.\nH 7: The profitability of a bank has a positive impact on the decision to use GBR\nreserves.\nThis hypothesis is closely connected to the use of GBR reserves as a signal of\nstrength. To be able to fund GBR reserves, a bank has to be fairly profitable. There-\nfore, we should see a bank's profitability having a positive influence on its likelihood\nof using GBR reserves and the extent to which it does so. One is tempted to interpret\nthis hypothesis in a way that assumes that GBR reserves will be used for earnings\nmanagement purposes. Since the corresponding coefficient in our regressions would\nhave the same sign if this were the case, it is not clear which of the two effects is\nresponsible. However, the analysis of earnings management behavior is the subject\nof further research.\n5 Empirical Analysis\n5.1 Data and Variables\nFor our empirical analysis, we use data from the Bundesbank's prudential database\nis the information system on bank-specific data which is jointly operated by the\nDeutsche Bundesbank and the German Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).\nThe database contains information on the financial statements and supervisory re-\nports of individual German banks. Therefore, our analysis is based on a micro panel\nof annual supervisory bank-level data for 4,916 German banks.15 We merely analyze\nunconsolidated accounts prepared according to HGB, since building GBR reserves\nis not allowed within financial statements prepared according to any international\naccounting regime.\nIn some parts of our analyses, we divide the German banking market into four dif-\nferent categories according to bank size and legal status: Savings banks (henceforth:\nThrifts), cooperative banks (Coops), small private banks (henceforth: Small Cred-\nits), and large banks (Large Banks). The latter category contains the five largest\nGerman private banks as well as the federal state banks and the central institutions\nof the cooperative banking sector. We are aware of the fact that this categorization is\nsomewhat unusual since German banks are commonly grouped merely according to\ntheir legal status into savings banks, cooperative banks and private banks. However,\nwe assume that much of banking institutions' behavior is mainly driven by their size\nrather than their legal status.\nWe deliberately excluded other types of financial institutions like home loan banks,\nmortgage banks or securities trading banks since they either do not fulfill the defi-\nnition of a bank according to section 1 KWG or they do not conduct core banking\nbusinesses such as lending and borrowing. Owing to a lack of data and mergers\nduring the observed time period, the panel is unbalanced and consists of 32,023\nbank-year observations.\nIt is noteworthy that coverage (meaning the proportion of banks included in our\npanel in relation to the overall number of banks in Germany) is always close to\nand mostly exceeds 90% for each bank category in each year. For Thrifts and Small\n15 Due to our treatment of mergers, this figure is higher than the actual number of existing banks. In case of a\nmerger, we, technically speaking, created a new bank that is independent of the merging ones. This new bank\nstarts operating in the year of the merger. For the purposes of our analysis, there is no need to distinguish\nbetween mergers, takeovers or any other kind of acquisition.\nYear Thrifts Coops Small Credits Large Banks\nTable 2: Coverage by bank groups for selected years (in %).\nThrifts Coops Small Credits Large Banks Total\nYear No. row% No. row% No. row% No. row% No. row%\nTable 3: Number of observations in the panel by bank categories over time.\nTable 3 gives detailed information on the number of banks observed in our panel and\nthe split between the bank categories over time. The share of each bank category is\nfairly constant over time, whereas the absolute number of banks decreases (almost)\nsteadily, reflecting mergers that have occurred in the German banking sector in the\nlast decade. Coops dominate our sample. They have a share of roughly 71%, followed\nby Thrifts (22%), Small Credits (7%), and Large Banks with about 1%.\nWe apply the following variables to measure the use of GBR reserves: GBRi,t\nis\nthe amount of GBR reserves of bank i in year t and GBRTA\ni,t\nis the share of GBR\nreserves in relation to total assets of bank i in year t. The binary variable D GBRi,t\ntakes the value 1 if bank i shows a positive amount of GBR reserves in year t (thus\nGBRi,t\n> 0) and 0 otherwise.\nRegarding H1, we use SIZEi,t\nas a proxy for the size of the bank, which is measured\nas the natural logarithm of total assets of bank i in year t. To prevent endogeneity,\nwe exclude the amount of GBR reserves included in a bank's total assets.\nWith respect to H2, D PUBLICi\nis 1 if bank i is subject to public law and 0\notherwise. This variable is constant over time because changes in legal status did\nnot occur.\nReferring to H3, we are including time dummy variables t\n. Hence, we can control\nfor changes in GBR reserves during the course of our analysis and find time-fixed\neffects.\nTo account for banks' individual risk levels (corresponding to H4), we use the non-\nperforming loan ratio of a bank i in year t and name it NPLi,t\n. The choice of this\nproxy is based on the assumption that banks with a high NPL ratio are also exposed\nto generally high risk levels. It is calculated as the ratio of non-performing to total\ncustomer loans. Loans are non-performing if the bank is waiting for payments which\nTo somehow control for banks using GBR reserves as a signal of strength, we finally\n, a dummy variable which takes the value 1 if a bank is using any\nhidden 340f reserves and 0 otherwise. If a bank is able to fund both types of\nreserves, it is likely in a strong economic position, and one way of showing this is by\nmeans of GBR reserves.\nTo analyze the endowment with regulatory capital (relevant to H5), we use the level\nof tier 1 capital a bank has in relation to its risk-weighted assets. Once more to\nprevent endogeneity when examining the influence of the tier 1 capital endowment,\nwe exclude the volume of GBR reserves inherent in tier 1 capital. The corresponding\nvariable is named TIER1i,t\n.\nThe dummy D IFRSi,t\nis used for H6, t. It takes the value 1 if bank i in year\nt prepares its (group) financial statements according to IFRS in addition to HGB\nand 0 otherwise. Note that this dummy is time-variant because many banks changed\ntheir status from 'non-IFRS' to 'IFRS' (but not the other way round) during the\nperiod of our analysis.\nFinally, we use ROAi,t\n, which is the return on assets (ROA) of bank i in year t,\nas a proxy for the profitability of a bank. With respect to H7, it is calculated as\nthe ratio of operating income (income before risk provisioning) to total assets of\nbank i in year t. Using operating income rather than net income or declared profits\neliminates any effects stemming from legal accounting policy on the one hand or\nmanipulation on the other hand.\nA relatively moderate outlier treatment is applied to the dataset, in which we trun-\ncate explanatory variables (except for dummy variables) at the 0.5% and 99.5%\nquantile. To account for the heterogeneity of the capital adequacy ratio (tier 1\n16 For technical reasons, the numerator of this ratio, on top of troubled customer loans also comprises non-\nperforming interbank lending, whereas the denominator merely contains the sum of a bank's customer loans.\nThus, the NPL ratios may be overstated to a certain extent. However, since the volume of troubled interbank\nloans has generally been low, at least before the start of the financial crisis, this should be negligible.\nCategory banks EUR 1,000 (in %) (in %) (in %) (in %) (in %) (in %)\nTable 4: Number of banks and mean of observations in the panel by category.\ncapital of a bank in relation to its risk-weighted assets), we use an upper-bound\ntruncation of this variable at the 97% quantile.\nTable 4 shows the number of banks per category as well as averages per category and\nacross all banks for these variables. Since the table shows the mean of observations\nand not the mean of banks, those banks with many observations in the panel have\na higher weight than banks which contribute only a few observations. The quite low\naverage of total assets for all banks is the result of the dominance of Coops in the\nsample. Generally speaking, correlation is low and multicollinearity is therefore not\na serious problem. Table 5 reports the correlation coefficients for the variables in\nour analysis.\nTable 5: Pairwise correlations.\nFirst of all, we compute the share of banks holding a positive volume of GBR reserves\nwith the help of the mean of D GBR17. For Thrifts, Figure 1 shows that this share\nslowly increased until 2000, followed by a steeper rise in recent years (reaching 34%\nin 2007). For Coops, a similar, even more pronounced development is characterized\nThe Large Banks take the lead in the use of GBR reserves, starting at a share of\nat these numbers, it has to be considered that the overall number of banks within\nthis category is fairly small. Since federal or state banks (being large and public) as\nwell as large cooperative central and the largest German private banks are included\nin this category, our findings are in line with hypothesis H1 (size). This is true for\nthe initially hesitant use of GBR reserves within Thrifts and Coops and the low\nshare of usage within Small Credits as well, since these groups primarily consist of\nsmaller banks. Further confirmation is provided by the correlation coefficients for\nD GBR and SIZE in Table 5.\nWith respect to H2 (public), our findings indicate that the extent of monitoring and\ncorporate control lowers the use of GBR reserves, since almost all banks subject to\npublic law are Thrifts and largely did not make use of GBR reserves, at least in the\nearly years of our analysis. The conflicting (since positive) sign of the correlation\ncoefficient of D PUBLIC with D GBR (as given in Table 5) calls for a deeper\nanalysis regarding the dummy for banks subject to public law, as we outline in the\nnext section.\nThe share of banks using GBR reserves within the banking sector as a whole rose\nCoops dominate our sample, Figure 1 clearly exhibits this rise. This confirms our\nhypothesis regarding time, H3.\nTo gain deeper insight into the use of GBR reserves, we counted the number of activ-\nities involving these reserves over time (cf. Table 6).

Apparently, an existing level is increased much more often than low-\nered. Similarly, we observed substantially more implementations than terminations.\nSupporting H3 (time), the number of implementations clearly increases over time,\nIn this paragraph, we will exclusively focus on those observations where banks use\nGBR reserves and on the question of what level of reserves those banks hold.18\nTo eliminate size effects, we use the ratio of GBR reserves to total assets GBRTA.\nFigure 2 shows how this ratio has evolved over time, broken down by bank category.\nIt reveals startling results especially for Small Credits. The ratio of GBR reserves\nto total assets is remarkably high in 1995 and falls to a lower level afterwards.\nOnce more, a steep rise is visible during 2001 and 2002 followed by a sharp decline\nto a fairly constant level of roughly 0.5% of total assets. When interpreting these\nfindings, the small number of banks showing these reserves within this group has to\n18 Technically speaking, we are neglecting all observations with D GBRi,t = 0, i.e. we take a bank into account\nonly in those years in which its level of GBR reserves is positive.\nYear First Imple- Raise Hold Hold Reduce Terminate Total\nyear ment (= 0) (> 0)\nTable 6: Number of activities involving GBR reserves over time.\nbe considered.

This is done in Model A.1, where\nwe examine the influence of the independent variables SIZE (referring to hypothesis\nD IFRS (H6) and ROA (H7) on the probability that a bank will use GBR reserves.\nMoreover, we include the time dummies (t\n) to find time-fixed effects (referring to\nH3). Since we do not control for any unobservable random or bank-fixed effects, it\nis simply a pooled time-fixed effects estimation. The formal design of Model A.1 is\ngiven in equation (1):\nP(D GBRi,t\n\u00b7 SIZEi,t\n\u00b7 NPLi,t\n\u00b7 TIER1i,t\n\u00b7 D IFRSi,t\n\u00b7 ROAi,t\n].\nThe estimated coefficients as well as the corresponding standard errors (in brackets)\nare shown in the second column of Table 7. Additionally, the AUR value as well as\nthe number of observations with D GBR = 0 are given at the bottom.19\nWith respect to the second research question, we investigate which factors are re-\nsponsible for the precise level of GBR reserves a bank's management chooses to\nhold. To this end, we employ a tobit model (Model A.2) with GBRTA as the de-\npendent variable. The tobit methodology20 accounts for the fact that the level of\nGBR reserves is naturally truncated at zero. Ignoring this and using OLS regression\nmodels, which allow for negative values of the dependent variable, would systemat-\nically underestimate the slope of the regression line. We are using the same set of\nindependent variables as in Model A.1 and again pooling the data while controlling\nfor time-fixed effects. The formal design of Model A.2 is given in equation (2):\n19 To assess the fit of the overall Model A.1, we calculate the AUR value, which equals the area under the so-called\nReceiver Operating Characteristic Curve. For a more detailed description of ROC curve analysis cf. Flach et al.\n(2003) and Fawcett (2006). In our case, the AUR value measures the ability of the model to correctly identify\nthose banks using GBR reserves (thus having D GBRi,t = 1) and those not using them. The larger the AUR\nvalue (equaling the area under the ROC curve), the more accurate the model in question is. The corresponding\nAUR value of roughly 86% means that our model has excellent accuracy.\nGBRTA\ni,t\n=\nYi,t\nif Yi,t\nYi,t\n\u00b7 SIZEi,t\n\u00b7 NPLi,t\n\u00b7 TIER1i,t\n\u00b7 D IFRSi,t\n\u00b7 ROAi,t\n] + i,t\n.\nThe estimated coefficients as well as the corresponding standard errors (in brackets)\nare shown in the third column of Table 7. Additionally, \u00af\npseudo\nand the number of\nobservations with GBRTA = 0 are given at the bottom.\nIn order to test whether an independent variable has an impact on D GBR (GBRTA\nrespectively), i.e. the corresponding  is non-zero, we should be able to reject the null\nhypothesis of  = 0 at a preferably high level of significance.21 Broadly speaking, the\nresults of both analyses are identical (with respect to the sign of the coefficients).\nTherefore, we conclude that the variables driving the probability of using GBR\nreserves also influence the level of GBRTA.22\nAs expected, we find a strongly significant positive influence of the variable SIZE,\n> 0, which means that large banks tend to use GBR reserves more often than\nsmall banks and show a higher level. Once more, our (economic) hypothesis H1 is\nconfirmed.\n< 0, the dummy variable D PUBLIC apparently has a negative and\nsignificant influence on the probability of a bank making use of GBR reserves. In\nother words, if a bank is subject to public law, it is less likely to use visible reserves\nthan if it is privately owned. Therefore, H2 is also confirmed.23 The effect of a close\nmonitoring of the management in banks subject to public law (suggesting that those\nbanks' managers will not make use of GBR reserves) obviously outweighs the lines\nof argument relating to both the risk and the management signal (suggesting that\n21 In the following, we say for short that the independent variable has a significantly positive impact on the\ndependent variable, meaning that the corresponding coefficient has a positive sign and significantly differs from\n0 according to the t-test.\n22 This proves that the choice of the tobit model is appropriate in our setting. If different variables influenced the\nlikelihood of the use of GBR reserves and the level of GBRT A, results would be different in those two model\ntypes. A Heckman approach would then be adequate for modeling our research questions correctly.\n23 At first sight, this result contradicts the positive correlation coefficient between D PUBLIC and D GBR (as\ngiven in Table 5). However, this may be owing to the considerable positive correlation between D PUBLIC\nand SIZE. In other words, the fact that large banks are usually more likely to use GBR reserves and that, at\nthe same time, public banks are fairly large may cause this correlation which more than compensates for the\nnegative effect of D PUBLIC on D GBR.\nControl variables SIZE & D PUBLIC Bank category\n(Probit) (Tobit) (Probit) (Tobit)\ndependent variable D GBR GBRTA D GBR GBRTA\n\u00af\npseudo\nTable 7: Results of pooled regression models.\nbanks subject to public law are likely to make greater use of GBR reserves than\nothers).\nThe coefficient on NPL, 3\n, is strongly significant and negative. This indicates that\nbanks with a low volume of non-performing loans in relation to their customer loans\nare more likely to use GBR reserves and they are doing so to a greater extent.\nSince the NPL ratio measures the risk level of a bank, the probability that low risk\nbanks will use GBR reserves, and with a higher intensity, is obviously higher. H4 is\nLooking at TIER1, the corresponding coefficient 4\nis significantly negative, meaning\nthat banks which are short of regulatory capital build higher levels of GBR reserves\nand do so more often. Thus, H5 is backed, too.\nAn interesting result is indicated by the positive coefficient 5\n(relating to the vari-\nable D 340f ). This positive coefficient shows that banks that already hold 340f\nreserves are more likely to use visible GBR reserves, too, and to use them with\nhigher intensity.25 This supports the hypothesis that reserves serve as a signaling\ndevice (inherent in H7) for the following reason. Banks which are able to build 340f\nreserves are assumed to be economically healthy. Thus, they may use GBR reserves\n(as a clearly visible balance sheet item) to signal their strength to outsiders. More-\nover, it might also be the case that some banks first build up 340f reserves to the\n4% limit of the overall value of the relevant financial assets, and later on they make\nuse of GBR reserves.\n> 0, the variable D IFRS has a positive and significant influence on the\nprobability and intensity of the use of GBR reserves. Banks that prepare accounts\naccording to IFRS are more likely to hold GBR reserves than other banks. Further-\nmore, they build higher levels of these reserves. Hence, H6 is supported as was the\ncase with respect to the correlation coefficients in Table 5.\nIn line with the function of GBR reserves as a signal of strength, 7\nis significant and\npositive, meaning that banks with a high ROA are more likely to use GBR reserves\nand are doing so to a greater extent than banks with a lower return in relation to\ntheir total assets. H7 is confirmed by the regression outcomes as well as the positive\ncorrelation coefficients in Table 5.\nFinally, all coefficients on the time dummies, 11\n, are significant at a high\nlevel except for the year 1996. Moreover, the coefficients are steadily increasing.\nThis is statistically strong evidence for hypothesis H3 predicting increasing use of\n24 The corresponding correlation coefficient in Table 5 confirms this result.\n25 This also holds when looking at the corresponding correlation coefficient in Table 5.\nGBR reserves over time. Furthermore, it reinforces the results shown in the merely\ndescriptive part of our analysis.\nIn the following step, we substitute the independent variables SIZE and D PUBLIC\nwith control variables for each but one of the four bank categories.26 Along the\nlines of Model A.1 and A.2, we first use the probit Model B.1 addressing the first\nresearch question, followed by the tobit model B.2 with respect to the second one.\nThe key findings of these models are shown in the last two columns of Table 7. When\ncontrolling for the bank categories, Large Banks are the basis, which is why their\ncoefficient is not stated.\nSince all coefficients of the other categories are significantly negative, it is striking\nthat Large Banks are most likely to use GBR reserves, followed by Small Credits,\nCoops, and Thrifts. The same order of precedence holds for the level of the reserves\nin relation to total assets. These results coincide with the previous finding of size\n(and being a bank subject to public law, respectively) having a positive (negative)\nimpact on the likelihood and intensity of a bank showing visible reserves. Thus, it\nconfirms H1 (H2). Regarding all other independent variables, the signs and (in the\nvast majority of cases) even the levels of significance are identical to the previous\nmodels. Thus, Models B.1 and B.2 may be considered as robustness checks for the\nmodels in block A.\nTo account for the possibility that the variables examined so far do not capture all\npotential determinants for using GBR reserves, which is indeed a pivotal assumption\nfor using pooled regression models, we conduct further robustness checks. To this\nend, we successively investigate a set of variables identical to the ones used in the\nlast four models. We now control for unobservable effects that are constant over\ntime and differ between banks by using a random effects panel methodology in the\nregressions.27 The outcomes of these models (which are given similar names to their\npooled forerunners by adding an asterisk (*) (as for instance Model A.1* )), are\nshown in Table 8, which exhibits an identical structure to Table 7.\nThe results of these models mimic those of the previous ones to a large extent.\nHowever, 6\nconcerning D IFRS and 7\nconcerning ROA change to a negative and\nsignificant sign, respectively.28 Obviously, the bank-specific effect causes the emerg-\n26 Owing to the way we distinguish between the different bank categories, it is necessary to do this rather than\nincluding all variables in one single regression equation. Otherwise, the effects of the size and the public character\nof a bank would not be isolated correctly. By definition, the Large Banks contain the largest banks within the\nsample and the category Thrifts consists (almost) entirely of public banks and contains most of these banks.\n27 Due to the very low variance of D GBR on a bank-individual level, a bank-fixed effects estimator would not\nyield reasonable results. Furthermore, it is not possible to isolate the effect of time-invariant variables (e.g.\nD PUBLIC) from the unobservable fixed effect using this regression technique.\n28 Moreover, 5 lost its significance within the tobit models, but did not change its sign.\nControl variables SIZE & D PUBLIC Bank category\n(Probit) (Tobit) (Probit) (Tobit)\ndependent variable D GBR GBRTA D GBR GBRTA\nTable 8: Coefficients of random effects models.\ning changes.29 The positive signs concerning ROA produced by the pooled models\nshow that banks with high ROA tend to be the ones that build high levels of GBR\nreserves and vice versa. However, the opposite signs produced by the panel regres-\nsions indicate that within banks an increase in ROA over time is accompanied by\na decrease in GBR reserves. Further investigation of this issue delivered the insight\nthat the variance of ROA is much larger between than within banks. This finding\nmay explain why it is reasonable to observe the coefficient of ROA turning from\npositive to negative.\nA similar line of argument holds for D IFRS. Among banks, we observe that IFRS\nbanks tend to build a higher level of GBR reserves. However, the panel regression\nindicates that within those banks GBR reserves are primarily used in years pre-\nIFRS. Moreover, since the vast majority of German banks still exclusively adheres\nto HGB accounting and since institutions that adopted IFRS at one point in time\ndid not reverse this decision later on, there are only very few changes to the variable\nD IFRS. In other words, D IFRS can be considered to be (nearly) constant over\ntime. This characteristic may make the variable somewhat vulnerable in the context\nof a random effects panel regression.\n29 Based on economic considerations, we feel comfortable making the crucial (but untestable) assumption that\nthe unobservable effect is orthogonal to all regressors. Note that it is not possible to test for the absence of\ncorrelation with the unobservable effect and thus to control for the appropriateness of applying a random effects\nmethodology.\n6 Conclusion\nBanks with a profitable business have several instruments at their disposal to set\naside money to cover their general risks and also to keep money in the bank for\nfunding further investments. Apart from earnings retention or raising new equity,\nGerman banks may deliberately undervalue certain assets to create hidden reserves\naccording to section 340f HGB or declare visible reserves, i.e. reserves for general\nbanking risks according to section 340g HGB. From an information and agency\nperspective, management should take into account the following aspects in making\na decision:\n\u00b7 Hidden reserves are the method of choice because managers gain some discretion\nin earnings management. However, such reserves are not allowed under IFRS\naccounting. Moreover, unlike the three other options, 340f reserves merely con-\nstitute tier 2, not tier 1 regulatory capital. Therefore, weakly capitalized banks\nshould be more likely to use GBR reserves than IFRS banks.\n\u00b7 Nevertheless, GBR reserves may also be used as a signal of strength. In that\nsense, fairly well capitalized and profitable banks should be more likely to use\nGBR reserves instead of or in addition to hidden reserves.\n\u00b7 Using GBR reserves may be interpreted as a bad signal stemming from in-\ncreased visible risk provisioning. In addition, the use of these reserves may be\na consequence of the management's fear that owners will not supply capital for\nfuture investments: without management's decision to increase GBR reserves,\nit would be at the owners' discretion whether to leave earnings in the bank\nfor future investments or to distribute them, as dividends say. The negative\nsignal is less relevant for banks which have some other way of demonstrating\ntheir good standing, particularly a very small probability of default. Therefore,\nbanks subject to public law should be more likely to make use of GBR reserves\ndue to their public guarantees. The same holds for large institutions if the 'Too\nBig To Fail' presumption holds true. Furthermore, both negative signals be-\ncome less relevant the more frequently they are sent by banks. Therefore we\nwould expect the number of institutions using GBR reserves to rise over time.\n\u00b7 The theory of corporate governance and control predicts that banks with a\nsmall number of shareholders are monitored more closely than those with a large\nnumber of shareholders. Since banks subject to public law are generally owned\nby just a few cities or municipalities, they are likely to be closely controlled.\nThis may induce their managers to use hidden reserves instead of visible ones\nand thus offset the effect described above.\nOur empirical analysis of the German banking market, including 32,023 bank-year\nobservations for the period 1995 through 2007, applies probit and tobit models in\nterms of pooled as well as random effects panel estimation techniques. We arrived\nat the following statistically significant results:\n\u00b7 Larger banks are more likely to use GBR reserves and tend to hold higher\nlevels than smaller ones. The same is true of banks with low regulatory capital\nendowment and banks already using hidden 340f reserves.\n\u00b7 Banks that are subject to public law make use of GBR reserves less often and\nalso to a smaller extent. The same holds for high-risk banks, meaning those\nwith relatively high non-performing loan ratios.\n\u00b7 The pooled regression analysis indicates that banks with higher levels of return\non assets tend to build GBR reserves more often and to a greater extent. How-\never, our random effects models show that an increase in profitability within\nbanks over time is accompanied by a decrease in the probability and extent of\nbuilding GBR reserves.\n\u00b7 Among banks we observe that IFRS banks are more likely to use GBR reserves\nand tend to hold higher levels. However, the panel regressions indicate that\nwithin those banks GBR reserves are primarily used in years pre-IFRS.\n\u00b7 Even when controlling for all other factors, the general use of GBR reserves as\nwell as their ratio to total assets increases, almost strictly monotonically, over\ntime.\nAgency issues are still sometimes seen as a fairly theoretical concept. However, the\npresent study is another contribution demonstrating that they may yield highly\nrelevant predictions. Their robustness deserves further attention. Moreover, looking\nat reserves building in banks as a joint decision-making process with respect to\nvisible GBR and hidden 340f reserves may yield interesting results. Further research\nis therefore needed to explicitly take this into account too.\nReferences\nAhmed, A. S./ Takeda, C./ Thomas, S.
