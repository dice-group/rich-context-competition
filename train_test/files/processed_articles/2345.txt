Using data from the 2006 and 2007 American Time Use Surveys, we\nexpand upon earlier research by including more detailed measures of time spent eating as well as measures of\nphysical activity time and sedentary time. We also estimate three alternative models that relate time use to BMI.\nResults: Our results suggest that time use and BMI are simultaneously determined. The preferred empirical model\nreveals evidence of an inverse relationship between time spent eating and BMI for women and men. In contrast,\ntime spent drinking beverages while simultaneously doing other things and time spent watching television/videos\nare positively linked to BMI. For women only, time spent in food preparation and clean-up is inversely related to\nBMI while for men only, time spent sleeping is inversely related to BMI. Models that include grocery prices,\nopportunity costs of time, and nonwage income reveal that as these economic variables increase, BMI declines.\nConclusions: In this large, nationally representative data set, our analyses that correct for time use endogeneity\nreveal that the Americans' time use decisions have implications for their BMI. The analyses suggest that both\neating time and context (i.e., while doing other tasks simultaneously) matters as does time spent in food\npreparation, and time spent in sedentary activities. Reduced form models suggest that shifts in grocery prices,\nopportunity costs of time, and nonwage income may be contributing to alterations in time use patterns and food\nchoices that have implications for BMI.\n",

As a consequence, the increasing prevalence of\nAmericans' weight problems portends a future where\nthe billions of dollars we currently spend on overweight\nand obesity-related health care [2] will continue to grow\nand life expectancy may actually begin to decline [3].\nIn an effort to identify the correlates of Americans'\ngrowing overweight/obesity risk, few studies have exam-\nined the relationship between time use and BMI. Those\nstudies that do investigate the role that time use may play\ngenerally fall into two categories. The first category\nincludes studies where the focus is on time spent in physi-\ncal activity and/or inactivity as it relates to BMI while the\nsecond category includes studies where the focus is on\ntime spent eating and BMI.\nCross-sectional studies of physical activity time and\nBMI conclude that higher levels of physical activity are\nassociated with lower BMI [4-6].

Studies focused on television/video viewing find that\ntelevision time is positively related to BMI [8-10]. Those\nthat have examined the relationship between sleep time\nand BMI find an inverse relationship between sleep time\nand BMI in the cross-section but not longitudinally\nSeveral studies have examined the relationship between\nsedentary behavior, physical activity, and BMI. One study\nfinds a positive relationship between television viewing\ntime and abdominal obesity risk even after controlling\nfor leisure-related physical activity [14]. Using data from\nthe American Time Use Survey (ATUS), another study\nfinds that individuals who spend less than 60 minutes per\nday watching television/videos and who spend more than\n60 minutes per day in moderate-to-vigorous leisure time\nphysical activity have significantly lower BMIs, than\notherwise comparable respondents who report spending\nfewer than 60 minutes watching television/videos and\nspending less than 60 minutes in moderate-to-vigorous\nphysical activity [15]. Research that makes use of data\nfrom the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES) finds that physical activity and inac-\ntivity (measured by steps per day and time) vary signifi-\ncantly across normal weight, overweight, and obese\nindividuals [16]. Finally, data from a cross-sectional Aus-\ntralian study reveal significant interaction effects of\nleisure-time sedentary and physical activities as they\nrelate to overweight/obesity risk [17].\nFewer studies assess the relationship between time\nspent eating and BMI. Bertrand and Schanzenbach [18]\nsurveyed adult women who completed a recall time\ndiary, a dietary time diary, and reported their height and\nweight. Their study focuses on describing the eating con-\ntext for normal and overweight women. They report that\namong overweight women, more calories are consumed\nwhile doing chores, socializing, relaxing, watching televi-\nsion, caring for others, and shopping [18].c While their\nlow cooperation rate (17 percent) and the focus only on\nwomen limits the generalizability of their study's findings,\nthe results are nonetheless suggestive that secondary eat-\ning (i.e., eating when something else, such as television\nviewing, is the primary focus of an individual's time) may\nbe linked to an increase in BMI. This contention is also\nsupported by nutrition studies that have found that peo-\nple tend to consume more calories when they are simul-\ntaneously engaged in other activities [19-24].\nHamermesh [25] uses ATUS data to explore the rela-\ntionship between the price of time, time spent in pri-\nmary eating and secondary eating spells (i.e., what he\ncalls \"grazing\" time), the number of spells, and BMI.\nUsing only the observations from employed individuals\nwho report their usual weekly earnings and their usual\nweekly hours worked, he finds a significant inverse rela-\ntionship between primary eating time and BMI. How-\never, when number of primary eating spells is also\nincluded, the average duration of primary eating is no\nlonger statistically significant. In addition, both average\nsecondary spell duration and number of spells of sec-\nondary eating are generally insignificant [25].\nIn the research that follows, we build on these earlier\nstudies to present a more complete picture of how time\nuse choices may be affecting Americans' BMI. Our\nresearch builds on past investigations in several ways.\nFirst, we investigate the relationship between BMI and a\nrange of time use categories that have typically only been\nexamined in isolation. Specifically, we focus on physical\nactivity time, television/video viewing time, sleep time, pri-\nmary eating time, secondary eating time, and food pre-\nparation time. Second, we estimate two alternative models\nthat allow for simultaneity in the choices individuals make\nabout time use and BMI - something that has not been\npreviously done. Third, we do not place any gender or\nemployment restrictions on the sample respondents thus\nenhancing the external validity of our findings.\nMethods\nData for the current investigation come from the 2006 and\n2007 public-use files of American Time Use Surveys\n(ATUS) and have the advantage of providing valid, reliable\nmeasures of time spent in both energy intake and energy\nexpenditure related activities over one 24-hour period\n[26,27]. The extraordinary level of detail in the ATUS\nallows us to separate time spent eating into time spent eat-\ning where eating is the respondent's primary focus and\nsecondary eating time (i.e., time when the respondent's\nprimary activity was something other than eating, but\nwhen eating was still taking place).\nATUS respondents are drawn from households that had\ncompleted their final interview for the Current Population\nSurvey in the preceding 2-5 months. Each respondent is\nrandomly selected from among each household's mem-\nbers, age 15 and older. Half complete a diary for a weekday\nand half complete a diary for a weekend day.\nInformation from the ATUS interviews is linked to\nmodule interviews [28,29] so that we also have data on\nthe respondent's height and weight. BMI is calculated\nfrom self-reported weight in kilograms divided by self-\nreported height in meters squared. It should be noted\nthat although self-reported BMI has been commonly\nused in past studies [30-34], some have found that it\nresults in a modest under-estimation of overweight and/\nor obesity rates [35-37] while others have found it to be\na valid and reliable way to measure BMI for nonelderly\nZick et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2011, 8:84\nWe restrict our ATUS sample to those respondents who\nare between the ages of 25 and 64, inclusive. Younger\nrespondents are excluded so as to avoid the inclusion of\nindividuals whose eating habits may be dictated by their\nparents. Respondents over age 64 are excluded because\nthese individuals are more likely to have health conditions\nthat may affect some aspects of their time use. We also\nrestrict our sample to those respondents whose BMI\nlead to the elimination of 5 male respondents (1 with BMI\nwe eliminate 12 respondents who report spending more\nthan 15 hours being physically active, 18 respondents\nwho report spending more than 20 hours sleeping and 4\nrespondents who report spending more than 20 hours\nwatching television. These restrictions are made to reduce\nthe potential influence of leverage points and outliers.\nFinally, we exclude women who are pregnant as their\nreported BMIs are likely not reflective of their usual BMIs.\nThese sample restrictions result in a sample of 8,856\nWe focus on seven time-use categories that are poten-\ntially related to energy balance. The first category mea-\nsures the amount of primary time the respondent spends\neating and drinking (i.e., time where eating and drinking\nhas her/his primary attention).d Secondary eating time is\ncaptured by the amount of time the respondent reports\neating as a secondary activity (i.e., time where something\nelse has her/his primary attention). Secondary time spent\ndrinking anything other than plain water is measured\nseparately. Other food related activities are measured by\nthe time spent in food preparation and clean-up excluding\nrelated travel time.\nPhysical activity cannot be adequately measured by\nsimply summing the time respondents report spending\nin exercise and sports as we would end up omitting\nthings like bicycling to work, chasing after a toddler,\nand doing physically demanding household chores.\nThus, rather than use only time spent in the ATUS\nsports and exercise categories, we sum time spent in all\nactivities in the ATUS activity lexicon that generate\nmetabolic equivalents (METs) of 3.3 or more. We select\nthese activities based on the work done by Tudor-Locke\net al. [39] who have linked the ATUS time use lexicon\nto the Compendium of Physical Activities. We choose a\nthreshold of 3.3 METs because this captures activities\nsuch as exterior house cleaning, lawn and garden work,\ncaring for and helping household children, playing\nsports with household children, active transportation\ntime (i.e., walking or biking), as well as most forms of\nsports, exercise, and recreation. It excludes such routine\nhousehold activities such as interior housekeeping and\nplaying with children in non-sports.e The compendium\nalso identifies time spent in certain occupations (i.e.,\nbuilding and grounds cleaning and maintenance, farm-\ning, construction and extraction) as generating a mini-\nmum of 3.3 METs. To control for occupational physical\nactivity requirements, we include a dummy variable in\nthe male equation that takes on a value of \"1\" if the\nrespondent works in one of these occupational cate-\ngories. Only a handful of female respondents report\nworking in these fields and thus we exclude this dummy\nfrom the female regressions. We sum only spells of 10\nminutes or more of physical activity time because prior\nwork has established 10 minutes as the minimum dura-\ntion necessary to impact an individual's energy balance\nFinally, we use two measures of inactivity: television/\nvideo viewing time and time spent sleeping. These two\nmeasures have been associated with BMI and/or obesity\nrisk in previous studies that have related single cate-\nAnalysis Approach\nTo examine the relationship between time use and BMI,\nideally one would have longitudinal data on time use in\nvarious activities. Unfortunately, longitudinal time diary\ndata do not exist. While some surveys do gather infor-\nmation on typical time use, methodological research has\nshown such questions provide less valid and reliable\nConceptually, cross-sectional time diary data of the\ntype available in the ATUS have two disadvantages.\nFirst, time spent in various activities on any given day\nmay deviate from an individual's usual time use pat-\nterns. As such, there is measurement error in the inde-\npendent time use variables that likely bias the coefficient\nestimates toward zero [42]. Second, any observed asso-\nciation between time use and BMI obtained using cross-\nsectional data may reflect reverse causality. For example,\nhaving a high BMI may lead one to spend less time\nbeing physically active. To address both data shortcom-\nings, we adopt a model of time use where BMI and time\nuse are simultaneously determined.\nIn our model, BMI is a function of time use, biologi-\ncal traits (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, health status)\nand socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., marital sta-\ntus, number of children, employment status, and educa-\ntion). Decisions about how much time to spend in\nvarious activities is a function of household roles (e.g.,\nself-identification as the primary meal preparer, self-\nidentification as the primary grocery shopper), structural\nfactors (e.g., number of children in the home, marital\nstatus, employment status, gender, race/ethnicity, age,\nweekend or weekday diary, season of the year, rural\nresidence, region of residence), prices (e.g., the respon-\ndent's wage rate, grocery prices), and income.\nZick et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2011, 8:84\nData on wage rates in the ATUS are limited to those\nindividuals who report both hours of work and earnings.\nTo avoid the possibility of selection bias that could be\nintroduced by excluding those who are not employed,\nwe elect to use predicted hourly opportunity costs of\ntime generated from wage regressions estimated using\nthe corresponding years of the March Supplement to\nthe Current Population Survey (CPS). We use indivi-\nduals age 25-64 in the March Supplement to estimate\nwage equations that correct for sample selection bias\nusing the techniques developed by James Heckman [43].\nEquations are estimated separately for women and men\nusing the appropriate CPS weights. Coefficients from\nthese equations are used to generate predicted hourly\nopportunity cost of time for each individual in our\nATUS sample. A random error is added to each pre-\ndicted wage based on a mean of zero and a variance\nthat is equal to the variance of the estimating equation.f\nEstimates of offered wage rates provide approximate\nopportunity cost estimates of the value of time for\nemployed individuals and lower-bound estimates of the\nvalue of time for non-employed individuals [43].\nThe ATUS contains a categorical measure of annual\nhousehold income. The categorical nature of this variable\ncoupled with item-specific non-response made it less\nthan ideal to use on our analyses. Consequently, we again\nturn to the March Supplement to the CPS. For indivi-\nduals age 25-64, we estimate a regression using the\nappropriate CPS weights where total, annual nonwage\nincome for the household is the dependent variable.\nCoefficients from this equation are then used to generate\npredicted nonwage income values for our sample of\nrespondents in the ATUS. A random error is added to\neach predicted nonwage income value based on a mean\nof zero and a variance that is equal to the variance of the\nestimating equation.g\nGrocery price information comes from the Council for\nCommunity and Economic Research's (C2ER) state-\nvides expenditure weighted, quarterly metropolitan and\nmicropolitan price information [44].h The only detailed\ngeographic information contained in the ATUS is the\nrespondent's state of residence and residential urbanicity.\nThus, our linkage of grocery price information is done\nbased on information about the respondent's state of\nresidence, urban/rural status, and the quarter in which\nthe respondent was interviewed. In those rare cases\nwhere the respondent was located in a micro area within\na state that had no micro grocery price index, we use the\nstate-wide average. Initially, we also included an index\nmeasuring non-grocery prices but this was dropped from\nour analyses once it was determined that the simple cor-\nrelation between the grocery price index and the non-\ngrocery price index was .89.\nWe estimate three different sets of equations sepa-\nrately for men and women. In the first formulation, we\nestimate a model where our time use measures are trea-\nted as predetermined variables that affect BMI. We then\nestimate an instrumental variables model that recognizes\nthat the time use and BMI causality may run in both\ndirections when one is analyzing cross-sectional data of\nthe sort used here. In the final formulation, we estimate\nreduced form models of BMI. In this formulation, BMI\nis estimated as a function of the biological and socio-\ndemographic variables and the strictly exogenous factors\nthat are posited to affect time use [45]. Essentially, these\nlatter two estimation approaches both incorporate the\nhypothesis that time use and BMI are simultaneously\ndetermined.\nKey to identifying the preferred model is undertaking\ntests for endogeneity and then, if endogeneity is con-\nfirmed, identifying \"instruments\" that are correlated to\ntime use but unrelated to the error term in the BMI\nequation [45]. We test for endogeneity by estimating the\nDurbin-Wu-Hausman F-statistic [46]. Strength of the\ninstruments is assessed by calculating a variation on the\nsquared partial correlation between the instruments\nexcluded from the second stage and the endogenous\nregressors [47]. Independence of the instruments from\nthe error term in the BMI equation is assessed by calcu-\nlating Hansen's J statistic [46].\nThe instrumental variables used to identify the system\nin our application are self-identification as the primary\nmeal preparer, self-identification as the primary grocery\nshopper, whether the diary day was a weekend, whether\nthe diary day was in the summer, whether the diary day\ncame from 2007, the grocery price index, the hourly\nopportunity cost of time, and the household's annual\nnonwage income. The instrumental variables approach\ninvolves first estimating the time use equations and using\nthe coefficients from these equations to generate pre-\ndicted time use values for all respondents in the sample.\nThese predicted values are then included as regressors in\nthe BMI equations. If all of the necessary conditions are\nmet, the estimated coefficients using this approach are\npurged of possible reverse causation. This approach has\nthe added advantage of also addressing the typical time\nuse measurement issue since the predicted values may be\nthought of as approximating usual time spent in the var-\nious activities.\nSeparate equations are estimated for women and men\nto allow for the possibility that there are biological factors\nrelated to gender that interact with time use and are\nassociated with BMI. All analyses are weighted using the\nappropriate ATUS weights. The ATUS weights compen-\nsate for the survey's oversampling of certain demographic\ngroups, the oversampling of weekend day diaries, and\nZick et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2011, 8:84\ndifferential response rates across demographic groups\nResults\nSample Characteristics\nDescriptive statistics for our samples of men and women\nappear in Table 1. The typical male in our sample is\nabout 44 years old, married, and has one minor child in\nthe home. He is often the primary grocery shopper\n(most often when he is not married), but not the pri-\nmary meal preparer in his household. He has some col-\nlege education and is currently employed. His hourly\nopportunity cost of time is almost $21/hr and he lives\nin a household that has approximately $1,669 in nonw-\nage income per year. The typical female respondent in\nour sample is very similar. She is also 44 years old, mar-\nried, and has one minor child in the home. She is most\noften both the primary grocery shopper and the primary\nmeal preparer. She has some college education and lives\nin a household that has approximately $1,604 in nonw-\nage income per year. The hourly opportunity cost of her\nterpart's, and she is also employed outside of the home.\nTable 1 also reveals that the typical man and woman\nin our sample are overweight (defined by a BMI that is\npercent of the males in our sample are overweight or\nobese while the corresponding figure for the females is\nlower at 57 percent. As a point of comparison, analysis\nof clinical data from the National Health and Nutrition\nfemales age 20-74 were overweight or obese [1]. While\nthe years and our sample age ranges are not entirely\ncomparable to those in the NHANES study (i.e., our\nsample age restriction is 25-64), the figures nonetheless\nsuggest that, on average, the self-reported height and\nweight in the ATUS do a reasonable job of classifying\nadults' BMIs. In a more extensive comparison of ATUS\nBMI measures to NHANES BMI measures, Hamermesh\n[23] reaches the same conclusion for men but notes a\nmodest downward bias in BMI reporting for women in\nthe ATUS relative to NHANES.\nThe descriptive information on the time-use measures\nappears in Table 2. It shows that women and men, respec-\ntively, spend an average of a little more than an hour a day\nin eating where that is the main focus of their attention.\nThey also spend more than 20 minutes per day on average\nengaged in eating as a secondary activity.i Secondary time\nspent drinking is much higher with the average time being\n57 minutes for men and almost 69 minutes for women.\nTime spent in food preparation and clean-up is substan-\ntially greater for women than men (about 2.6 times more).\nPhysically active time averages about 68 minutes a day for\nmen and 35 minutes a day for women. Sleep time averages\na little more than 8 hours for both men and women.\nFinally, the typical woman and man both spend consider-\nable time watching television/videos, with men averaging\nviewing television/videos.\nAlso presented in Table 2 are the fractions of respon-\ndents who spend any time in each of the seven activities\non the diary day. Note that virtually all respondents\nreport that they spend some time engaged in eating as a\nprimary activity and sleep. However, for most other activ-\nities, there are substantial numbers who report no time\nbeing spent in a particular time-use category. The cen-\nsored distribution of time use leads us to use a tobit rou-\ntine to estimate the first stage in our instrumental\nvariables analyses.\nMultivariate Results\nTable 3 shows the parameter estimates for all three mod-\nels for both women and men. The ordinary least squares\n(OLS) model suggests that all seven time use categories\nare linked to BMI while the instrumental variables model\nindicates that only a subset of the time use categories\nrelate to BMI. Which model is to be preferred? The\nanswer to that question hinges on three things: (1) an\nevaluation of whether endogeneity exists, (2) the strength\nof the instruments used to address any observed endo-\ngeneity, and (3) the independence of the instruments\nfrom the error process.\nTo test for endogeneity, we first estimate the reduced\nform equations for time use. The residuals from these\nequations are then included as additional regressors in the\nstructural equations. The Durbin-Wu-Hausman F-statistic\nassesses if the residuals are statistically significant which\nwould imply that time use and BMI are endogenous [46].\nOur set of seven time use categories have an associated\nfemales. Thus, we are confident that endogeneity exists.\nShea's partial R2 statistic can be used to assess the\nstrength of a set of instruments adjusting for their inter-\ncorrelations when estimating an OLS regression. How-\never, in our case the censored nature of the dependent\nvariables leads us to estimate the time use equations\nusing tobit rather than OLS. Consequently, we assess\ninstrument strength by estimating the c2 associated with\nthe instruments excluded from the second stage estima-\ntion and each endogenous regressor. This approach is\nparallel to an OLS approach suggested by Bound, Jaeger,\nand Baker [47]. The calculated c2 for males ranges from\na low of 72 in the case of secondary eating time to a\nhigh of 722 for television/video viewing time. For\nfemales, the range is 136 (secondary drinking time) to\n496 (sleep time). All are far above the critical c2 of\n21.67, suggesting that our instruments are strong.\nZick et al.

International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2011, 8:84\nIndependence of the instruments is assessed by Han-\nsen's J statistic which has a c2 distribution with degrees\nof freedom equal to the number of over-identifying\nrestrictions [46]. A statistically significant value suggests\nthat the instruments used in the first stage are not inde-\npendent of the second stage error term. In our model,\nfor men, indicating the instruments are not associated\nwith the error term in either instance.\nTaken altogether, the above statistical tests indicate\nthat there is endogeneity between time use and BMI\nand that the instruments used in our estimation meet\nthe criteria necessary to rely on the instrumental vari-\nables approach. Thus, we highlight the results for the\nsecond stage instrumental variables model along with\nthe alternative reduced form estimates. Parameter esti-\nmates of the first stage estimation appear in Appendix\nTables 4 and 5 for the reader's reference.\nIt is important to note that the time use coefficients\nestimated in the instrumental variables formulation are\nalways larger than their counterpart estimates in the\nOLS model. This is not surprising as past research has\ndemonstrated that \"small window\" measurements of the\ntype provided in a 24-hour time diary are likely biased\ntoward zero in multivariate analyses [42]. In this con-\ntext, the instrumental variables approach is also pre-\nferred as it provides estimates of the relationship\nbetween typical time use, rather than a single day's\nreport of time use, and BMI.\nFor both females and males, an increase in either pri-\nmary or secondary eating time is associated with a sig-\nnificantly lower BMI while an increase in secondary\ndrinking time translates into a significant increase in\nBMI. Increases in television/video time are also\nassociated with a statistically significant increase in BMI\nfor both men and women. An increase in sleep time is\nlinked to a significant decline in BMI for men but not\nwomen while more time spent in food preparation is\nassociated with a decline in BMI for women but not\nmen. Although time spent being physically active had a\nsignificant negative relationship to BMI in the OLS\nmodel, this relationship is not present for either women\nor men in the instrumental variables estimates. We\nattribute this null finding to the \"small window\" pro-\nblem associated with a single 24-hour time diary as phy-\nsical activity, particularly exercise and sports, may not\noccur on a daily basis. With the exception of secondary\neating time, the signs of all the statistically significant\ncoefficients are in keeping with our hypotheses.\nThe instrumental variables specification reveals several\ndifferences in socio-demographic variables by gender.\nAge, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, and\nemployment effects all vary by gender. For example, an\nincrease in age is associated with a statistically signifi-\ncant increase in BMI for women but not men. Conver-\nsely, married/cohabitating males have significantly\nhigher BMI's than single males, while marriage/cohabi-\ntation has no effect on BMI for women, ceteris paribus.\nOne of the few socio-demographic variables that do not\nvary by gender is health status. Being in fair/poor health\nis associated with a large increase in BMI for both\nwomen and men.\nThe reduced form estimates also demonstrate consid-\nerable socio-demographic differences by gender. But,\nthey reveal striking similarities with regard to the eco-\nnomic variables. For both women and men, increases in\ngrocery prices, opportunity costs of time, and nonwage\nincome are all associated with significantly lower BMI.\nTable 2 Descriptive Statistics for the Time Use Measures\nMales Females\nTime Use\nVariable\nDefinition Overall\nMean\nStandard\nDeviation\nPercent\nNon-Zero\nNon-\nZero\nMean\nOverallMean Standard\nDeviation\nPercent\nNon-zero\nNon-\nZero\nMean\nPrimary Eating\nTime\nTotal minutes over 24 hr\n(10 min. increments)\nSecondary Eating\nTime\nTotal minutes over 24 hr\n(10 min. increments)\nSecondary\nDrinking Time\nTotal minutes over 24 hr\n(10 min. increments)\nFood Preparation\nTime\nTotal minutes over 24 hr\n(10 min. increments)\nPhysical Activity\nTime\nTotal Minutes over 24 hr\n(10 min. increments)\nSleep Time Total minutes over 24 hr\n(10 min. increments)\nTelevision/Video\nViewing Time\nTotal minutes over 24 hr\n(10 min. increments)\nZick et al.

Specifically,\nbased on our instrumental variables model, we estimate\nthat an 11-minute decline per day in women's primary\neating time may have translated into a .73 increase in\nBMI for women. Likewise, a 23 minute per day decline\nin primary eating time over this historical period would\ntranslate into 1.70 increase in BMI for men.\nWhile time spent in primary eating activities has\ndeclined, trend analyses of time diary data show that sec-\nondary eating and drinking time has risen from an average\ndrinking time has risen from an average of 25 minutes per\nday to 70 minutes per day over that same historical period\n[49]. Surprisingly, in the instrumental variables model,\nsecondary eating time is associated with a significantly\nlower BMI for both men (p < .05) and women (p < .10).\nBut, secondary drinking time is associated with higher\nmen's and women's BMIs (p < .10). Our descriptive statis-\ntics reveal that secondary drinking time makes up approxi-\nmately three-quarters of all time spent in secondary eating\nand drinking activities. Past studies have found a positive\nrelationship between secondary eating and drinking time\nevidence of secondary eating/drinking effects on BMI.\nOurs is the first to parse out secondary eating and drink-\ning time. As such, it sheds some light on the mixed find-\nings in the literature, pointing the finger to increases in\nsecondary drinking time (rather than secondary eating\ntime) as a possible contributing factor to rising BMIs.\nThe social-psychological literature would suggest that\nless monitoring of caloric intake should occur when eat-\ning and drinking occur a secondary activities and thus\ntime spent in these activities should be associated with\nhigher BMI [20-23]. We find this is true with respect to\nsecondary drinking but not secondary eating. We do not\nhave a ready explanation for the inverse relationship\nbetween secondary eating time and BMI. Given the lim-\nited and very mixed evidence regarding any possible\nlinkage between time spent in secondary eating activities\nand BMI, further research on this point is sorely needed.\nFindings regarding the role that food preparation time\nplays in BMI are intriguing. For women, the more time\nspent in food preparation and clean-up, the lower their\nBMIs. Presumably, more time spent in food preparation\nand clean-up is associated with using more primary foods\nand fewer prepared foods when cooking. It may also be\nassociated with smaller serving sizes relative to those\nfound in prepared meals. Since 83 percent of women but\nonly 39 percent of the men identify themselves as the pri-\nmary meal preparer in their households, it is not surpris-\ning that we do not observe the same relationship for the\nmen. It would be interesting to investigate whether more\ntime spent preparing meals by women translate into lower\nBMIs for other members of their households as well.\nUnfortunately, this question cannot be addressed with the\nATUS data as only one member of each household in the\nsample provides time diary and BMI information.\nTaken together, our findings regarding primary eating\ntime, secondary drinking time, and time spent in food\npreparation and clean-up (by women) reinforce nutri-\ntional educators' emphasis on preparing meals and set-\nting aside time where eating is one's primary focus. The\nrole of secondary eating in healthy eating behaviours\nremains an open question, however.\nWhile we did not find support for a link between physi-\ncal activity and BMI, we found strong support for a link\nbetween physical inactivity - as measured by television/\nvideo viewing time - and BMI. This finding is consistent\nwith past research [8-10] and with public health programs\nthat encourage individuals to spend less time watching tel-\nevision/videos and more time being physically active [50].\nWhile our 24-hour diary may be too short to capture\ntypical time spent being physically active each day, this is\nnot true for television/video viewing time which is suffi-\nciently prevalent to be adequately measured with a single,\n24-hour diary. Indeed, it may be that television/viewing\ntime is a more general marker for a sedentary lifestyle\nthat could be used in place of the more infrequent physi-\ncal activity time when analyzing 24-hour time diary data.\nOur reduced form model estimates provide some\ninsights regarding the role that changing prices, oppor-\ntunity costs, and nonwage income may be playing in the\nrising overweight/obesity epidemic. Clearly, these eco-\nnomic factors matter. In the case of opportunity costs,\nwe show that an increase in the hourly opportunity cost\nof time is associated with a significantly lower BMI for\nboth women and men. It suggests that the recent eco-\nnomic recession, which precipitated a decline in work-\ners' opportunity costs, may lead to more weight gain for\nAmericans. And, this may be especially true for newly\nunemployed individuals who are drawing down on their\nsavings that historically was a source of interest (i.e.,\nnonwage) income. Indeed, it would appear that rising\nwage rates are not just good for the economy. They may\nalso be good for Americans' weight management.\nFinally, grocery prices are inversely related to BMI for\nboth males and females. This is consistent with past\nresearch that has linked the historical drop in prices for\nenergy-rich, processed foods to rising BMI in the United\nStates [51,52]. It also suggests a dilemma for policy\nmakers. Lower food prices may increase food access, but\nat the same time they may also be serving to fuel greater\ncaloric intake.\nOur study results must be tempered with a couple of\ncaveats. First, our proxies for biological differences in\nBMI are often statistically significant and there are clear\nsex-specific interactions with time use that merit further\nZick et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2011, 8:84\nexploration. Although sample size limitations prevent us\nfrom exploring age and race/ethnicity time-use interac-\ntions, such research could provide valuable insights\nabout the correlates of healthy body weight.\nSecond, our analysis presents a cautionary tale regarding\nthe use of \"small window\" measures of physical activity\ntime as it relates to BMI. Only about one-third of the\nwomen and two-fifths of the men in our ATUS sample\nreport doing any 10-minute spells of physical activity that\ngenerate 3.3 METs or more during the 24-hour time per-\niod (See Table 2). Recall that we do not find evidence of\nan inverse relationship between time spent in physical\nactivity and BMI. This is counter to a number of past stu-\ndies [4-6,15] but not surprising given that our estimates of\nphysical activity time are likely biased toward zero. The\nCenters for Disease Control recommends that adults age\nintensity aerobic activity, or that they spend 75 minutes\nper week in vigorous aerobic activity [40]. Thus, even\nthose who do follow these recommendations might not\nhave been exercising on the randomly chosen diary day.\nAlthough it would be costly, future time-diary data gather-\ning efforts should consider expanding the number of time\ndiaries gathered for each respondent and/or asking addi-\ntional questions about the usual time the respondent\nspends each week in certain infrequent, but potentially\nimportant activities.\nConclusions\nIn this large, nationally representative data set, our ana-\nlyses reveal that time use and BMI are endogenous. Cross-\nsectional analyses that do not adjust for endogeneity will\nlikely misstate the true relationship between time use and\nBMI. Based on our instrumental variables and reduced\nform estimates, we conclude that Americans' time use\ndecisions have important implications for their BMIs. The\nanalyses suggest that both eating and beverage drinking\ntime and context matters. In the case of women only, time\nspent in food preparation is inversely related to BMI while\nfor men only, time spent sleeping is inversely related to\nBMI. For both men and women, sedentary time, as mea-\nsured by television/video viewing time also matters. In\naddition, the reduced form models suggest that shifts in\ngrocery prices, opportunity costs, and non-wage income\nmay be contributing to alterations in time use patterns\nand food choices that have implications for BMI. These\ninsights should help scholars and practitioners working in\nthe area of weight management to better target interven-\ntion efforts.\nEndnotes\na Overweight and obesity are terms used to classify indi-\nviduals whose weights are greater than what health offi-\ncials deem to be healthy for a given height.\nb There are some indications that this upward trend\nmay be tapering off as a recent analysis of obesity trends\ning this most recent 10-year period [2].\nc Bertrand and Schanzenbach [19] do not include a\ntable that shows their multivariate analyses of how sec-\nondary eating time relates to BMI.
