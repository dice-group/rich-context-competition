Data are cross-sectional. Two satisfac-\ntion variables were created: very satisfied and dissatis-\nfied. Thirty-three specialty categories were analyzed.\nResults: After adjusting for control variables, the follow-\ning specialties are significantly more likely than family\nmedicine to be very satisfying: geriatric internal medi-\ncine (odds ratio [OR], 2.04); neonatal-perinatal medi-\n(OR,1.36).Thefollowingaresignificantlymorelikelythan\nfamily medicine to be dissatisfying: otolaryngology (OR,\ncine(OR,1.22).Amongthecontrolvariables,wealsofound\nnonlinear relations between age and satisfaction; high sat-\nisfaction among physicians in the west north Central and\nNew England states and high dissatisfaction in the south\nAtlantic, west south Central, Mountain, and Pacific states;\npositive associations between income and satisfaction; and\nno differences between women and men.\nConclusions: Career satisfaction and dissatisfaction vary\nacross specialty as well as age, income, and region.

The income category\nRoughly, 35% are full owners of their practices; 23% are\npart owners. These physicians spend an average of 54.6\nhours per week working.\nTable 1 also lists specialties ranked by the number\nof respondents. The greatest number of physicians are\nin family medicine followed by internal medicine and then\npediatrics.\nSpecialties that are consistently at the extremes and\nconsistently statistically different from all specialties\ncombined (P.05, 2 test) are geriatric internal medi-\ncine, dermatology, pediatrics, internal medicine, and ob-\nstetrics-gynecology. But these 2 tests in Table 1 do not\nadjust for confounders.\nThedistributionofsatisfactionneednotbeuniformfor\nany given specialty. The distribution might be bimodal.\nMETHODS\nDATA\nData were drawn from the Community Tracking Physician\nresentative sample of physicians not employed by the fed-\neral government, who reside in the continental United States\nandwhoprovidedirectpatientcareatleast20hoursperweek.\nThe survey followed a complex design with 60 sites and a\nsmall independently drawn national sample.20 Some special-\nists such as radiologists, anesthesiologists, and pathologists\nas well as all residents and fellows were excluded from the\nsample. Primary care physicians were oversampled. Physi-\ncians were randomly selected within sites as well as physi-\ncian strata.20 The overall response rate was 65%. Response\nrates by physician specialty were not available. However, the\nCTS data gatherers maintain that the data are representative\nof the physicians within the nation.20 Moreover, to enhance\nthe integrity of our findings, we analyzed only specialties for\nwhich we had data on at least 40 physicians.\nphysicians did not have useful answers for the satisfaction\nquestion, and 29 physicians had missing data on 1 or more\nofthecontrolvariables.Oursamplesize,therefore,was12474.\nTwodependentvariablesindicatedwhetherthephysicianis\nverysatisfiedordissatisfied.Theywerebothcreatedfroman-\nswerstothefollowingquestion:\"Thinkingverygenerallyabout\nyoursatisfactionwithyouroverallcareerinmedicine,would\nyousaythatyouarecurrentlyverysatisfied(n=5273),some-\nvery dissatisfied (n=518), neither satisfied nor dissatisfied\nphysician responded \"very satisfied,\" then our very satisfied\nvariable equaled 1; our very satisfied variable equaled 0 for\nallotherresponses.Thedissatisfiedvariablecombinedresponses\nin the \"somewhat dissatisfied\" (n=1679) with the \"very dis-\nsatisfied\" (n=519) categories.

We used the\nmostpopularcontrolvariablesidentifiedintheliteraturethat,\nin turn, rely on the Eisenberg model.21,22 These are most use-\nfully classified as physician characteristics, experience with\nmanaged care, community factors, and type of practice.\nPhysician characteristics included age, sex, whether\nboard certified, and whether a graduate of foreign medical\nschool. The physician's \"experience with managed care\" was\ncaptured by the variable \"percentage of revenue from man-\naged care.\" One community factor was whether the physi-\ncian resides in a town or area with a population less than\nand areas). We intended for this variable to capture the\n\"rural and small town\" effect. Other community factors\nincluded 9 regions of the country: New England (Maine,\nNew Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,\nand Connecticut); mid Atlantic (New York, New Jersey, and\nPennsylvania); east north Central (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,\nMichigan, and Wisconsin); west north Central (Minnesota,\nIowa, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and\nKansas); south Atlantic (Delaware, Maryland, District of\nColumbia, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South\nCarolina, Georgia, and Florida); east south Central (Ken-\ntucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi); west south\nCentral (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas); Moun-\ntain (Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico,\nArizona, Utah, and Nevada); and Pacific (Washington, Or-\negon, California, Alaska, and Hawaii).\nConsiderable information on type of practice was avail-\nable in the CTS. Annual income was included in the fol-\nmation was also available on ownership of practice. We cre-\nated 2 variables: whether the physician is full owner (sole\nproprietor) or part owner (partner). Finally, we also con-\nsidered average weekly work hours as a control variable.\nSpecialties are classified in 33 categories (Table 1).\nSTATISTICS\nInourunivariateanalysis,weperformed2 tests.Sampleweights\nand geographic design effects are accounted for with STATA\n6.023 programs.Inourmultivariateanalysis,whichwebelieve\ntobeamorecredibleanalysis,controlvariableswereaccounted\nforinlogisticregressionsthatadjustedforgeographicclusters\nusingsvglogitinSTATA6.0.23 Familypracticewaschosenas\nthecomparisoncategoryinthemultivariateanalysisfor2rea-\nsons.First,itcontainedthemostincumbentsofanyspecialty\nintheCTS.Second,thepercentagesforverysatisfiedanddis-\nsatisfied (43% and 17%, respectively) were very close to the\nmean for all specialties (42% and 18%, respectively).\n\u00a92002 American Medical Association.

These\nhigh satisfaction levels among most physicians, despite\nthe many challenges of our changing health care sys-\ntem, are testaments to the enduring rewards of the sci-\nence and practice of medicine. However, only about 2\nout of 5 physicians are very satisfied with their careers,\nand nearly 1 in 5 are dissatisfied. These somewhat mixed\nresults are disappointing given the enormous indi-\nvidual and societal investments required to prepare a fully-\ntrained physician.\nIn this discussion, we first consider the results on\nthe specialty variables and on the control variables. Then\nwe compare these results with the literature and con-\nsider the implications of our results and limitations of\nour study. Finally, we draw a conclusion.\nTheinterspecialtycomparisonsincludesomeexpectedand\nsome unexpected results. Obstetrics-gynecology special-\nists report high dissatisfaction, perhaps related to rising\nexpectations for perfect birth outcomes and high medi-\ncolegal risks.24 At the other end of the spectrum, derma-\ntology has consistently been viewed as one of the most at-\ntractive specialties by graduating medical students owing\ntoitscontrollablelifestyle,relativelynarrowfocus,andbur-\ngeoning scientific knowledge base.14\nMore surprising is the relatively high proportion of\ndissatisfiedphysiciansamongthosepracticingcertain\"pro-\ncedural\" specialties (eg, ophthalmology, pulmonary medi-\ncine, otolaryngology, and orthopedic surgery). In con-\ntrast,physicianspracticingsome\"cognitive\"specialties(eg,\ninfectious diseases, geriatrics, and pediatrics) were un-\nlikely to be dissatisfied. This is puzzling, especially given\nthe high income and prestige associated with the \"proce-\ndural\" specialties. But it may not be the historical income\nand prestige levels that are relevant but rather the change\nin these levels that has occurred in recent years that is rel-\nevant. There has been considerable loss of income, au-\ntonomy, and job openings for procedural specialties over\nthepast15yearswiththeadvanceofmanagedcare.25 Sharp\noccurred for most of the procedural specialties.26 Small de-\nclines and some increases (family medicine) occurred\namong the cognitive specialties.26 The surgical subspe-\ncialties in particular have been among the hardest hit by\nMedicare payment reform and managed care.27 Other CTS\nresults suggest that procedural specialties are more likely\nto perceive problems in providing high quality care un-\nder various managed care arrangements than are primary\ncare physicians.28 Although we enter covariates reflect-\ning $50000 increments of income and percentage of rev-\nenue from managed care into the equation, these covari-\nates are not likely to capture all of the subtle influences of\nincome and managed care. Moreover, we do not attempt\nto control for any direct measure of autonomy.\nSome of the interspecialty differences in satisfaction\nmay be explained by self-selection. For example, Fried-\nman and Slatt29 found personality differences in introver-\nsionandextroversionacrossstudentschoosingprimarycare,\nobstetrics-gynecology, and surgical specialties. The broad\nconcept of \"personality,\" therefore, could confound the re-\nlation between specialty and satisfaction.\nWe turn now to the control variables. The age re-\nsults suggest a nonlinear relation. A high percentage of\nyoung physicians are very satisfied and an even higher\npercentage of physicians aged 65 and older report being\nvery satisfied (Figure). This may be owing to the enthu-\nsiasm and idealism of youth and self-selection among the\nelderly. Physicians who dislike their careers probably re-\ntire by age 65 years. Physicians who do not retire by age\n65 years probably derive considerable satisfaction from\ntheir jobs.\nTheworkhoursvariableisstronglyandpositivelyas-\nsociatedwithdissatisfaction.Itisstatisticallyinsignificant\ninitsassociationwithbeingverysatisfied.Theseresultsun-\nderscore the point that being very satisfied is not just the\noppositeofbeingdissatisfied.Theresultscouldbeexplained\nby the marginal utility theory of work in economics. This\ntheory holds that leisure is preferred to work, in general,\nandthatincreasedworkhoursgenerateincreased\"disutil-\nity\"(unhappiness)atanincreasingrate.30 The\"increasing\nrate\" more likely occurs during a major shift from some-\nwhat satisfied to dissatisfied as opposed to the minor shift\nfrom very satisfied to somewhat satisfied.\nAge, y\nOdds Ratio for \"Very Satisfied\"\nOdds ratios for \"very satisfied\" with the covariate age.

All rights reserved.\nResults for foreign medical school graduates are\nstrong and consistent; they are much less likely to re-\nport being very satisfied and much more likely to report\nbeing dissatisfied than US graduates. These results are\nconsistent with the reported high rates of attrition among\nforeign medical school graduates in US residency pro-\ngrams, the reported clash of cultures between immi-\ngrants and US citizens, and possible discrimination.31\nHigher income is associated with increased likeli-\nhood of being very satisfied and a decreased likelihood\nof being dissatisfied. The income odds ratios also tend\nto rise or fall monotonically and generate relatively nar-\nrow confidence intervals compared with all other covar-\niates. These results are consistent with the view that feel-\ning adequately rewarded in financial terms is an important\npart of overall career satisfaction.\nMcMurray et al1 analyzed 5704 male and female physi-\ncians in the Physician Work Life Study, with a concern\nfor sex differences. They found that women were more\nlikely than men to be dissatisfied. We found women to\nbe neither more nor less likely than men to report being\nvery satisfied or dissatisfied. McMurray et al1 did not dis-\ncuss associations between either satisfaction or burnout\non one hand and specialty on the other.\nSchulz et al5 reported results on 545 physicians in\nDane County, Wisconsin. They created only 14 spe-\ncialty categories (eg, general surgery, general internal\nmedicine, pediatrics, obstetrics, and family practice).\nAfter adjusting for control variables such as age, sex,\nemployment in a health maintenance organization, and\nsolo practice, they found only 1 statistically significant\ndifference: psychiatrists reported less career satisfaction\nthan surgeons. But there are limitations to the study by\nSchulz et al.5 They surveyed physicians in only 1 county\nin Wisconsin, and the data were from 1986. They did not\ncontrol for as many variables as we did. Finally, they con-\nsidered 14 specialties. We considered 33.\nFrank et al2 analyzed a nationally representative\nsample of 4501 US female physicians. They considered\n18 specialties. Frank et al2 did not seek to produce a rank-\ning of specialties as we did. In multivariate regressions\nthat included a number of covariates (age, work hours,\nnumber of children in family), no statistically signifi-\ncant differences across specialties were found. How-\never, age was found to be positively and statistically sig-\nnificant in its association with high satisfaction. Marital\nstatus was not found to be statistically significant. They\nfound that 31% of female physicians had seriously con-\nsidered leaving medicine.\nIMPLICATIONS\nOur results might be useful to medical students making\ncareer decisions. Presumably, students would want a spe-\ncialty for which a high percentage of incumbents are very\nsatisfied and/or a low percentage are dissatisfied, other\nthings being equal.\nThese results will also be of interest to specialty soci-\netiesconcernedwithboththewellbeingoftheirmembers\nand the attractiveness of their specialty to future genera-\ntionsofstudents.Somespecialtiesalreadyconductdetailed\nsurveys of practitioner satisfaction and have used the re-\nsults to help plan interventions at the individual, organi-\nzational,andpoliticallevels.2,6 Totheextentthatpervasive\ndiscontent may be associated with adverse organizational\nand patient outcomes, these results should be of interest\nto managers, policy makers, and residence training direc-\ntors. For example, if discontent continues within some\nspecialties,notonlywillfewerstudentschoosethatspecialty,\nbut some incumbents will exit it.

It is generally acknowledged that a miscal-\nculation of demand within an influential study, loss of\njob autonomy, and income left students fearful of select-\nAnother implication involves the future mix of spe-\ncialists in the United States.9 If specialties that register high\non dissatisfaction are likely to shrink, our results are im-\nportant for forecasting the future mix of specialists.\nFinally, of particular interest is the potential effect\non quality of care that results when a high percentage of\nphysicians in otolaryngology, obstetrics-gynecology, oph-\nthalmology, orthopedic surgery, and internal medicine\nare dissatisfied. The health of the public, in general, may\nworsen.\nWe begin with limitations. First, the data are self-\nreported. However, this is true for all survey data sets.\nMoreover, only the physician knows his or her level of\nsatisfaction.\nSecond, the data are cross-sectional so that causal\nrelations are subject to interpretation. For example, the\nrural/town variable is consistent and strongly statisti-\ncally significant in its positive correlation with very sat-\nisfied. We cannot determine, however, whether it is work\nin rural areas that improves satisfaction or whether it is\nthe type of physician (already satisfied) who chooses to\nlive in a rural area. Similar problems plague the inter-\npretation of the strongly statistically significant correla-\ntions for the board-certified, foreign medical school gradu-\nate, geographic region, and full owner variables. These\ncorrelations, again, could reflect self-selection. Never-\ntheless, a number of authors have assigned a casual in-\nterpretation to the correlation between being a full owner\nand dissatisfaction. According to these authors, it is being\na full owner in the age of managed care that leads to lower\nBut our focus is not on rural residence, region, sole\nproprietorship, or managed care. We enter each of these\n\u00a92002 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nas control variables in our analyses. We are interested in\nproducing the first ranking of specialties according to sat-\nisfaction using the CTS data. Future researchers may im-\nprove on these rankings with longitudinal data or more\nsophisticated statistical models.\nThird, the data are limited in that some variables are\nnot available. Physician demographic characteristics such\nas race, marital status, and number of children in the fam-\nily have been shown to correlate with satisfaction and\nare standard covariates in economic studies of labor\nincrements in the CTS.\nFourth, response rates may differ across specialty. But\nthis is true for any covariate. The CTS administrators\nmaintain that these data are representative of physicians\nin the nation.20 Finally, we do not analyze specialties\nwith fewer than 40 incumbents.\nFifth, little solid evidence exists regarding why any\nspecialty would rank high or low. But the CTS data are\nhighly regarded, and the results on the control variables\nare believable (eg, experience with managed care, being\na foreign graduate, and increased work hours are asso-\nciated with dissatisfaction, whereas higher income and\nbeing young are associated with high satisfaction). We\nconclude that whereas the reasons for given specialties\nbeing high or low on the list may not be clear, the list is\nlikely to be accurate and will generate future research into\ndiscovering those reasons.\nThere are also strengths of this study. First, the CTS\ndata set is large and designed to represent the nation. The\nsample size of the CTS is larger than any previous data\nset used to analyze physician career satisfaction. Sec-\nond, we control for most of the variables identified in the\nliterature. Third, we consider more specialties than any\nprior study. Fourth, our findings (with respect to pedi-\natrics and obstetrics-gynecology, for example) are con-\nsistent with contemporary impressions of satisfaction\nacross specialties, thus leading credibility to our study.\nFinally, the data set is highly regarded and has been pro-\nductively analyzed within other rigorous studies.21,28\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe used a large, nationally representative sample of phy-\nsicians to assess differences in career satisfaction across\n33 specialties. Considerable variations were found; phy-\nsicians were not equally satisfied. These results may serve\nto bring greater research and policy attention to why some\nspecialists derive considerably more satisfaction from their\nwork than others.\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation, Alpha Center, Princeton,\nOccupational Safety and Health, Atlanta, Ga.\nWe acknowledge Kristen Enders, BS, and Penny Barath,\nBS, for providing programming assistance.\nCorresponding author: J.
