    "abstract": "Abstract\nLake ice depth provides important information about local and regional climate change, weather patterns,\nand recreational safety, as well as impacting in situ ecology and carbon cycling. However, it is challenging to\nmeasure ice depth continuously from a remote location, as existing methods are too large, expensive, and/or\ntime-intensive. Therefore, we present a novel application that resolves size, cost, and automation issues using\ncommercially-available soil water content reflectometer sensors from multiple manufactures. Analysis of sen-\nsors deployed in an environmental chamber using a scale model of a lake demonstrated accurate measure of\nthe change in ice depth over any time period to within 1 cm, through sensor response of liquid-to-solid\nphase change. A robust correlation exists between volumetric water content in time as a function of environ-\nmental temperature and ice growth. This relationship allows us to convert volumetric water content into ice\ndepth. An array of these sensors can be used in lake or river settings to create a temporally high-resolution\nice depth record, which fills in a needed gap for ecological or climatological studies as well as increasing pub-\nlic recreational safety.\nLakes are an important component of the Earth's climate\nsystem and climate change impacts to lakes include altera-\ntions to both physical and biological processes throughout\nall seasons (Magnuson et al. 1997). Long term winter records\nof lake and river ice cover have been compiled from Canada\nNorthern Hemisphere (Magnuson et al. 2000) and show\nshorter ice coverage periods. Global climate modeling efforts\nshow that lakes have strong connections to climate at the\nlocal (Deng et al. 2012) and regional scales (Strong et al.\n2014). Several lake-atmospheric observation data sets are\nyear round observational data including ice thickness from\nlakes that freeze are needed to better parametrize models.\nWinter lake ice cover has important implications beyond\njust local and regional climate, such as water quality, ecol-\nogy, and human use. Ice cover reduces surface energy and\ngas exchange. The partitioning of sensible and latent heat\nfluxes by lakes impact the local atmospheric surface layer's\nstability (Nagarajan et al. 2004) and can have effects at the\nregional scale (Rouse et al. 2005). Ice cover can lead to\nanoxic and low-light conditions, both of which can impact\nphytoplankton and their linked food-chains (Vanderploeg\net al. 1992). Man-made structures can be damaged by ice\nexpansion or drift and recreational activity safety depend on\nipating in ice fishing annually in the United States (United\nStates Department of the Interior and Wildlife Service 2013)\nand the majority of deaths being attributed to thin lake ice\n(Barss 2006), ice thickness measurements disseminated to\nthe public in near-real-time would greatly improve the safety\nconditions of recreational ice activities.\nHowever, measurements of lake ice is challenging due to\nthe physical properties of the water-liquid boundary. Several\ntypes of under-ice measurements are possible including sub-\nsurface solar radiation data which require knowledge of how\nice conditions that change radiative transfer throughout the\nwinter (Bolsenga 1978) and moored sub-surface sonar sensors\nwhich requires temperature dependent speed of sound cor-\nRecent advances in using X- and Ku-band radar is promising,\nbut requires information or assumptions on ice conditions\n(Gunn et al. 2015), in which in situ data is still needed. One\nof the larger datasets from oceanographic submarine sonar\ndata and the National Snow and Ice Data Center (2006) does\nnot apply to lake systems. Buoys have been used in the Arc-\ntic Ocean, but larger-scale deployment is limited by produc-\ntion cost of the buoys themselves (Polashenski et al. 2011).\nWeekly time-series data can be collected by hand, but is\nlabor intensive and can miss temporal processes between\n*Correspondence: dereed@wisc.edu\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons\nAttribution-NonCommercial License, which permits use, distribution and\nreproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly\ncited and is not used for commercial purposes.\nLIMNOLOGY\nand\nV\nC 2015 The Authors Limnology and Oceanography: Methods published by Wiley\nPeriodicals, Inc. on behalf of Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography\ncollections, including key parameters like seasonal ice maxi-\nmum and dangerous thin ice (Sleator 1995). Ice can also be\nmodeled using thermodynamic properties and optical satel-\nlite data to calibrate models (Liston and Hall 1995; Wang\net al. 2010). While short-scale temporal modeling is possible,\nmodels are sensitive to atmospheric wind speed, the condi-\ntion and depth of snow on top of the ice, surface albedo and\nradiation fluxes and uncertainties limit to model accuracy.\nRecently, to measure ice thickness Cui et al. (2015) demon-\nstrates new methodology that utilizes in situ measurements\nof electrical resistance to model ice thickness. This approach\nallows a direct measurement of the ice sheet, but requires a\ntemperature-dependent correction and a complex, custom\nbuild sensor array.\nHere, we demonstrate how commercially-available, rela-\ntively low-cost and low-power soil water content reflectome-\nter sensors can be repurposed as a tool to measure lake ice.\nThese sensors traditionally measure the volumetric water\ncontent of soils using time-domain reflectometry and hence\nare able to detect the phase change of water. Their temporal\nresponse, cost, and durability make them a cost effective way\nto record sub-hourly ice thickness directly with minimal\nmanual labor and measurement uncertainties that are associ-\nated with the other ice thickness methods. We discuss opera-\ntional characteristics of the sensors as well as the temperature\nrelationship of ice formation and melt in a lab setting.\nMethods\nExperimental setup\nWe built a model to simulate a lake freezing only from\nthe surface down, instead of freezing inwards from all sides\ntank (United States Plastic Corp., Lima, Ohio) was wrapped\naround the sides and bottom with fiberglass insulation\n4.25 cm thick on the sides and 8.5 cm thick on the bottom\nto limit heat transfer through those surfaces.\nWater content reflectometers (Campbell Scientific CS616,\nLogan, Utah) operate by generating an electromagnetic sig-\nnal and then measuring the signal attenuation and travel\ntime down the probe length and back. Normally used in\nsoil, changes in signal strength and travel time is used to cal-\nculate soil volumetric water content based on soil type\nstandard calibrations. When used in the simulated lake, the\nsensors measure water phase change between liquid and\nsolid states, resulting in a lower volumetric water content\nreading as the ice solidifies around the sensors.\nTwo of these sensors were attached to a wooden dowel\nwith the sensors placed on the bottom on either side of the\ndowel. A wooden dowel was used as it would conduct less\nheat, helping to ensure a level ice layer. The dowel was\nplaced upright in the center of the tank and secured so that\nit would not tilt. The tank was then filled with tap water\nuntil the top sensor's prongs had been covered, roughly\n10 L. Thermocouples (Omega; Type T Copper-Constantan)\nwere placed in the side insulation, both 10 cm from the bot-\ntom of the tank, as well as in the water, one at 1 cm off of\nthe bottom of the tank the other 1 cm below the water sur-\nface. This was done to measure water temperatures without\ninfluence of the tank sides.\nThe tank was placed in a programmable environmental\nchamber (Tenney Versa Tenn V, Tidal Engineering, Randolph,\nFig. 1. A conceptual figure of the experimental design using the simu-\nlated lake in a Tenney environmental chamber.\nFig. 2. Photo of the inside of the Tenney environmental chamber in\nbetween experimental runs showing the insulated polyethylene tank.\nWhitaker et al. Lake ice from soil water content sensors\nNew Jersey) (Fig. 2). The data logger (Campbell Scientific\nCR10X, Logan, Utah) was stored outside of the chamber and\ncollected volumetric water content data at 30-min intervals.\nand once at 2108C. After every experiment the ice growth\nwas removed, measured with a ruler and then melted before\nthe next experiment began, with one melting experiment at\ntemperature of 08C once. The length of each varied between\nSeveral experimental runs were needed to determine the\noperating characteristics of the environmental chamber and\ntank. The final design is shown in Fig. 1 and was a semi-\nfilled tank with insulation covering part of the sides and a\nfan to circulate air in the headspace above the waterline. A\nlower volume of water in the tank lead to faster experimen-\ntal runs as less thermal mass needed to change temperature.\nIn a smaller 7.5 L tank, we conducted a second set of\nexperiment to test the effects of sensor probe deformation\nand ion concentration variation on uncertainty in ice\nthickness-SWC relationship. For ionic concentration, a sim-\nple solution from 60 g of sodium chloride was used. In this\nmodified set up the effects of bending the rods, cutting\nthem, and placing a solid object between them were exam-\nined as well. This tank was also used to compare two water\ncontent reflectometers (10HS Soil Moisture Smart Sensor)\nfrom a second manufacture (Decagon Devices, Pullman,\nWashington) using a HOBO data logger (Onset Computer\nCorporation, Bourne, Massachusetts).\nData analysis\nThe relationship of CS616 sensors' soil water content\nresponse to ice depth was linear, thus require only two cali-\nbration coefficients, an intercept for maximum depth and\nsensor ice sensitivity. When the probes are fully covered in\nice, the sensor response is 0. Thus, we can derive ice depth\nusing the following equation, where a is the resting volumet-\nric water content reading, m is the slope and x is the sensor's\nmeasurement, along with the 30 cm length of the probe.\n0; if x  a\nmx t\n>\n>\n>\n>\n<\n>\n>\n>\n>\n:\nWe assume y is a linear function of temperature.\nThe response of the sensor with no ice varies by sensor,\nand thus require sensor specific calibration to derive resting\nvolumetric water content in liquid water with no ice. Tests\nso far found this value to be dependent on inherent charac-\nteristic and physical properties of the probes, including any\ndeformation or bending. For Sensor \"1\", the resting volumet-\nric water content was 0.74 in soil volumetric fraction, result-\ning in Eq. 1 where m is the slope at which ice forms.\nWhen solved we get the piece-wise function (Eq. 2) where\nx is the volumetric reading from the sensor, 240.75 was\nfound by solving Eq. 1 for m.\n>\n>\n<\n>\n>\n:\nSensor \"2\" had a different resting volumetric water con-\ntent reading in room temperature liquid water of 0.96. The\nsame method of converting water content to ice depth was\napplied. Changes to this calibration equation were needed\nwhen converting between volumetric water content and ice\ndepth for Decagon sensors due to shorter (15 cm) probe\nlength and different resting temperatures. Sensor accuracy\nand precision information were based off of the manufac-\nture's specifications.\nResults\nTwenty freezing and melting tests were run in the envi-\nronmental chamber. A photo of one run is shown in Fig. 2.\nThe lowest recorded air temperature was 2308C and the low-\nest water temperature was 2158C, while the highest air and\nwater temperature was 208C. The chamber was run for longer\nperiods of time at warmer conditions to ensure complete ice\nmelt between runs, and also allowed temperature equilib-\nrium throughout the volume. As designed, ice formation was\nprimarily top down with ice growth along the side and bot-\ntom not significant under test runs of less than 12 h. Longer\nFig. 3.

A small amount of ice (2 cm) was left from\nthe previous run to show volumetric water content sensor\nresponse is similar between melting of a surface lay of ice\nand melting ice at depth. There is a time lag between air and\nwater temperature changes, due in part to insulation of the\ntank, and water temperatures start above 08C. With a\ndecrease in temperature, a clear response from the sensors\nshowing 0.3 cm of ice growth in 15 min is noted. When\nthick and little new ice growth is noted. When water tem-\nperatures are positive, the sensor shows 0.7 cm of ice melt\nThe derived relationship between volumetric water con-\ntent and ice depth is shown in Fig. 4a, with this environ-\nmental run starting with above freezing water and no ice.\nAfter 3 h, water temperature cools to below freezing and ice\ngrowth begins. After the run, the ice layer was removed and\nmeasured to calibrate the sensors. Similar environmental\nruns were done at multiple temperatures (Fig. 4b) with 6 cm\nof ice growth taking 3 h longer at 2208C air temperature as\nThe comparison between Campbell and Decagon sensors,\nboth at 2208C, is shown in Fig. 4c. While there is a differ-\nence in insulation as the Decagon sensors where tested in\nthe smaller tank, there is the same amount of ice growth\nafter 18 h. To test melting conditions, several environmental\nruns were done with an existing ice sheet in place.

Lake ice from soil water content sensors\nrelationship was high and the 95% confidence interval over-\nlaps the zero temperature, zero ice change point. Probe\ndeformation ionic concentration experiments both changed\nwater content readings by 1\u00ad2%.\nDiscussion\nComparison to other ice thickness measurements\nCurrent measurements of lake ice thickness are either\nlabor intensive, sensitive to changing ice conditions or\ncost prohibitive, while ice thickness is an important eco-\nlogical and climatological measurement that is often\noverlooked in favor of only measuring the timing and\nextent of ice cover. We successfully showed in a lab\nexperiment that using soil water content sensors is a pre-\ncise and cost effective system to measure ice depth. Sen-\nsors from both Campbell Scientific and Decagon Devices\nperformed similarly, with the only noted difference\nbetween the two being probe length and compatibility\nwith logger systems. The system can be deployed season-\nally or left on the body of water year-round, either as a\nstand-alone sensor or as part of a water quality or water\nlevel measurement suite.\nIn comparison to other electrical resistance type methods,\nhere the entire rod is integrated over the measurement so air\npockets in the ice, liquid lens, or ice cracks are not a prob-\nlem unlike in other ice depth measurements and sensor soil\nwater response precision instead of placement of electrodes\ndetermines the maximum ice depth precision. Also of note\nis that, ice thickness can be measured at the sub-hourly scale\nthroughout the entire winter, previously only possible with\ncustom built buoys or electrical resistance sensors. However,\nsensor resting water content is quite variable between sen-\nsors (see section 4.2), and thus in situ calibration is recom-\nmended at least once per sensor to have a base reference\npoint for Eq. 3.\nIce temperature information is needed to calculate ice\nthickness with other techniques. The electrical resistance\nsensors of Cui et al. (2015) require air, ice and water temper-\nature measurements to correct resistance measurements\nbefore thickness is derived. The relationship between tem-\nperature and ice growth/decay shown in Fig. 5 is linear,\nmatching the predicted analytical ice models for small ice\nsheet volumes with no insulating snow (Lepp\nThis shows temperature corrections are not required for\ntime-domain reflectometry sensors and that the need to\nmeasure environmental temperature of other techniques is\neliminated. This has the results of reducing the complexity\nand error of the final ice thickness measurement.\nThe cost of the Campbell Scientific dataloggers that are\ncompatible with their soil water content sensors start at\n$1000, which could be cost-prohibitive, but Campbell Scien-\ntific soil water content sensors cost $120 each. The cost of a\npair of Decagon sensors to equal the same 30 cm probe\nlength and a HOBO logger was $600 total. Either option\nwould be well over an order of magnitude less expensive\nthan a comparable sub-surface sonar sensor which costs\nSensor limits and seasonal-scale errors\nThin ice sheets can be difficult to measure. With manu-\nfacture reported sensor accuracy of 2.5% percent for the\nCampbell Scientific CS616 probes and 3.1% for the Decagon\nsensors, this translates to ice thickness accuracy of 0.75 cm\nand 0.465 cm, respectively. Given that ice thickness can\nchange relatively fast for thin ice sheets (Thorndike 1992),\nmeasurements may not be fully reliable until nearly a full\ncentimeter of ice growth is present. For context, an ice thick-\nness of 5 cm is typically given as a minimum threshold to\nthe public for winter activity safety and a thickness of\n10.1 cm is advised for ice fishing.\nIn testing, it was noted that the resting volumetric water\ncontent reading of the sensor was affected by the ion con-\ncentration of the water. Readings were changed by only\n1\u00ad2% when a sodium chloride solution was used that was\nsignificantly higher than typically seen in the environment.\nThis can lead to errors of 0.3 cm in ice thickness, but would\nrequire a large change in dissolved ion concentration under\nthe ice, not just a high ion concentration. Except in rare\ncases, should not lead to systemic issues with the measure-\nment. If this is a concern, collocating a dissolved ion mea-\nsurement would allow for this effect to be corrected.\nIn potential cases of ice drift or heave deforming the sen-\nsor probes, another error of 1\u00ad2% in volumetric water con-\ntent would lead to error of 0.3 cm in ice thickness. This is\ndue to sensors being bent in a way that altered the proximity\nto nonwater solid objects, and hence the sensor's signal\ndelay and attenuation. In our laboratory setup, bending the\nprobes around the wooden support created an error of one\npercent in the measurement. Sensor location in the field is\nan important consideration if ice drift or heave is typical for\nthat lake. Solid mounting on a structure that is resistant to\nice damage (pier, bridge abutment or support) would remove\nthis error.\nCumulative errors from changing water ion concentra-\ntions or probe deformations can be limited with proper care\nin selecting measurement locations. For measurements in\ndifficult locations, these corrections can be addressed at the\nend of the winter season. A change in ice-free resting volu-\nmetric water content reading can be tested using prewinter\nand postwinter readings and corrections similar to snow\ndepth measurements can be applied (Johnson and Marks\nConclusion\nCurrently there are few cost effective methods to directly\nmeasure ice cover and thickness. This work demonstrates\nhow soil water content sensors can be repurposed to measure\nWhitaker et al. Lake ice from soil water content sensors\nice thickness without having to correct for environmental\ntemperature and at shorter timescales than possible with\nmost other methods currently used by the field. Response is\nlinear from 0 cm up to probe length, with estimate precision\nof 0.1% and accuracy of 2.5% for the Campbell sensors and\nprecision of 0.07% and accuracy of 3.1% for the Decagon\nsensors. Due to the change in travel time of a generated elec-\ntromagnetic pulse from the sensor that captures the phase\ntransition during ice grow/melt, the measurement is simi-\nlarly robust and comparable to time-reflectance sonic sensors\nthat measure changes in snowpack height during the cold\nseason compared to a snow-free reference point. Individual\nsensors probes can be deformed by ice drift with minimal\neffect on the measurement. Despite sensor-specific calibra-\ntion issues, this new sensor application allows the possibility\nof large-scale lake or river measurement networks in the\nfuture, with implications for safety, as well as environmental\nor climate change research.\nReferences\nBarss, P. 2006.
