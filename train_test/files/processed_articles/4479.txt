It takes its point of departure from current\ndebates about immigration and the challenges that the 21st\ncentury faces as a result of increased movement of human\ncapital across national borders. An expected shortage of\nlabor in the European market due to a decreasing population\nposes a challenge for politicians, who have to negotiate\nbetween a growing demand for an influx of non-European\nlabor and a promise to their voters to limit immigration. The\ndifficulty faced by immigrants in entering the Swedish labor\nmarket is a well-known problem among politicians, and the\neffort to come to terms with the issue has long been on the\npolitical agenda. Thus, despite policymakers' concern about\ndiversity and a relatively well-developed framework for inte-\ngrating immigrants into Sweden, immigrants continue to\nexperience discrimination in the labor market. This is evi-\ndent from studies showing not only that immigrants have\nhigher unemployment rates and lower incomes than native\nSwedes but also that they are overrepresented in low-skilled\nand low-status jobs (De los Reyes &Wingborg, 2002; Rydgren,\n2004 SCB - Statistiska Centralbyr\u00e5n, [Statistics Sweden];\nSCB, 2009). Figures from the Central Bureau of Statistics\nshow that the income of all immigrant groups is significantly\nlower than that of native Swedes, and this hits immigrants\nfrom Africa and Asia the hardest as these groups are also the\nmost exposed to unemployment. In 2008, the unemployment\n(SCB, 2009). It is noteworthy that their level of education is\noften higher than that of other immigrant groups as well as\nhigher than that of native Swedes. Studies further show that\nhighly educated immigrants often get stuck in low-skilled\njobs that do not match their qualifications, and that those\nwho get jobs within their professions earn lower incomes\nthan members of the native-born population with similar\ntraining. Immigrants who obtain employment are often found\nin poorly paid jobs that seldom correspond to their education\nor earlier experience (Rydgren, 2004). According to De los\nReyes and Wingborg's (2002) study, immigrants are particu-\nlarly overrepresented among manual workers, cleaners,\n1Lund University, Sweden\nCorresponding Author:\nAgneta Moulettes, Department of Strategic Communication, Lund\nUniversity, Box 117, Lund, Sweden.\nEmail: agneta.moulettes@isk.lu.se\nThe Darker Side of Integration Policy:\nA Study of Public Employment Officers'\nDiscursive Construction of Female\nImmigrants' Employability\nAgneta Moulettes1\n Keywords\nPublic employment officers, immigration, female immigrants, power asymmetry, poatcolonial lens, critical discourse analysis\n2 SAGE Open\nrestaurant assistants, and health care assistants. Furthermore,\nBakshi, Hatlevall, and Melchert (2009) call attention to the\nfact that only 20% of newly arrived immigrants receive pro-\nfessional support from the Public Employment Service\nAgency (PESA; Arbetsf\u00f6rmedlingen). Their study further\nshows that the number of male immigrants who are given the\nopportunity to participate in work-supportive activities is\nhigher than the number of female immigrants who are given\nsuch an opportunity. Besides the Swedish studies mentioned\nabove, a number of international studies draw attention to the\nfact that immigrants are still subjected to both explicit and\nimplicit prejudice in the labor market (e.g., Dietz, 2010;\nHakak, Holzinger, & Zikic, 2010; Hosoda & Stone-Romero,\nargue, for instance, that even if the economies of nations are\nmore interrelated and interdependent today, prejudice toward\nminority groups within the country as well as toward immi-\ngrants from other countries still characterizes the attitude of\nmany individuals.\nAlthough the integration of immigrants is fairly well doc-\numented in the literature, the main interest has so far been\nfocused on the existence of discriminatory practices among\nemployers and on unemployed immigrants' feelings about\nbeing excluded from the labor market. In spite of the appar-\nently large amount of interest in integration issues, little\nscholarly attention has been directed toward public employ-\nment officers and their role as professional mediators in the\nintegration process. Given the figures referred to above and\nthe fact that Sweden has one of the worst track records in\nEurope in terms of employing immigrants (Sanandaji, 2012),\nI contend that public employment officers' role in the inte-\ngration process deserves scholarly attention.\nThis article takes an interest in culture and gender dis-\ncourses and the language used by public employment offi-\ncers when describing how they help female immigrants to\nenter the labor market. The focus here on public employment\nofficers is mainly due to the fact that unemployed job seekers\nhave to register at their local employment agency to receive\neconomic support from the government. This means that\npublic employment officers are deeply involved in the\nemployment process. Also, because the study focuses on a\nmarginalized group, in terms of both nationality and sex, I\nam especially interested in how the power of prevailing dis-\ncourses on culture and gender is reflected in public employ-\nment officers' discursive accounts with respect to this group.\nThus, we seek to show (a) how public employment officers\nmake use of prevailing discourses to transform female immi-\ngrants from passive welfare beneficiaries into active and\nresponsible job seekers, (b) how prevailing discourses con-\ntribute to the reproduction of culture and gender differences\nreminiscent of colonial discourses, and (c) how unequal\npower relations may favor the segregation of mainstream and\nalternative cultures. For this purpose, we are drawing on\ndefinition of discourse as a collection of meaningful texts (in\nthis case, spoken words) that are embedded in powerful insti-\ntutions and practices. To achieve our aim, we will use a con-\nversation technique and analyze the language used by public\nemployment officers when they describe their encounters\nwith female immigrants. Conversation technique refers to\nthe use of open interviews resembling conversations rather\nthan traditional interviews that follow a strict interview\nguide. We will use ideas from postcolonial theory and critical\ndiscourse analysis (CDA), as we see them as a potentially\ninsightful lens for bringing to the surface representations of\ncolonial imprints that may be hidden in the discursive\naccounts. Furthermore, an interpretative method will be used\nin the analyses and the presentation of the study.\nThe article begins by introducing some theoretical discus-\nsions that we find relevant to our study. Following an expla-\nnation of the research design, findings from the study will be\npresented and discussed.\nLooking at Culture and Gender\nThrough the Postcolonial Lens\nThe conceptualization of culture and gender differences\nfinds its roots in the colonial discourse and its dichotomized\nand hierarchical ordering of the Western and the non-West-\nern worlds (Foug\u00e8re & Moulettes, 2012b; Jack & Westwood,\n1978) remind us, the colonial system favored colonizers over\ncolonized, males over females, and European patriarchy over\nother forms of gender construction. Succeeding in the colo-\nnial conquest and its endeavor to achieve modernity and\ncapitalism required a strategy imposing a social order that\nmade the Europeans masters of the universe. The concept of\ncoloniality and questions of colonialism and racism were\nhighlighted by the Latin Americans Mariategui in the 1930s\n(1978) who made Westerners aware of the way these ideas\nhave influenced our perception of the world. Said's ground-\nbreaking book, Orientalism, informs us that colonialism was\none of the most profound and significant experiences that\nshaped Europeans' perception not only of Orientals but also,\nand perhaps mainly, of themselves--as well as Orientals'\nperceptions of themselves (Foug\u00e8re & Moulettes, 2012a). As\nargued by Said, the imperialist powers needed to create the\nOrient as an \"Other,\" to define themselves as the center. To\nachieve success in this endeavor required a colonial strategy\nthat systematically led colonized people to understand them-\nselves as the inferior and backward Other. From a postcolo-\nnial or post-Occidental (a concept coined by Mignolo)\nperspective, it is not the fear of difference per se but rather\nthe fear of the superiority that the others may possess and of\nthe threat this may pose to our image of cultural identity that\ncauses ethnocentrism and the exclusion of those we perceive\nas different. Positioning culture as both resemblance and\nMoulettes 3\nmenace, Bhabha (1994) argues that \"the colonial mimicry is\nthe desire for a reformed, recognizable Other, as a subject of\na difference that is almost the same, but not quite\" (p. 86).\nFrom this standpoint, therefore, the notion of a homogeneous\nculture needs to be continuously repeated to be kept alive.\nThe construction of social labels is thus not just a way to\nmake existence easier to comprehend but a way to fix peo-\nple--a fixation that, in spite of an expressed desire among\nthe colonialists to mold the others into a common pattern and\nthe latter's effort to become integrated, will keep them apart.\nAs Fanon (1967) suggests, this is a culture that is \"fixed in its\ncolonial status . . . both present and mummified\" (p. 44), and\nas such, it determines minorities' place in society.\nThe strategy that was applied also favored men's posi-\ntion in society by attributing to them characteristics associ-\nated with power, while undermining women's position by\npresenting them as disregarded adjuncts to males (A.\nits representation of men as rational, active, assertive, mod-\nern, and normal, while women are characterized as emo-\ntional, passive, irresolute, backward, superstitious, and\nabnormal, is still present today (e.g., Hofstede, 2001). It is,\nas Lugones (2000) points out, \"what lies in the intersection\nof gender/class/race as central constructs of the capitalist\nworld system of power\" (p. 746). The continuous repetition\nof culture and gender differences has imposed a way of\nthinking about the world and the way we should live our\nlives. Like national culture, gender has traditionally been\nperceived as essentialistic and constituted as a homoge-\nneous group identity (Collison & Hearn, 1996; Mohanty,\ninhabitants of a country are assumed to be bound together\nby the notion of shared culture, men, and likewise women,\nare assumed to be bound together by a sociological notion\nof \"sameness.\" As a result, we see both culture and gender\ndichotomies operating normatively within an organization\n(Lugones, 2000) and thus contributing to the\nreproduction of gendered and cultural inequality outside\nthe organization.\nOne reason why the stress on culture and gender has\nbecome so important in contemporary society may be peo-\nple's enhanced vigilance in the effort to keep the discourse of\ncultural difference and the classification of people by race,\nethnicity, geographic origin, gender, and the like alive in\ntimes of increased migration and external pressure and\nuncertainty. Although professionals may be convinced that\nthey treat everybody the same, it is plausible that their sub-\njective notions and pressure from the environment to keep\nthe image of cultural and gendered homogeneity alive may\naffect their mind-set and actions. To judge from Meyer and\nRowan's (1977) findings, organizations are likely to mirror\nthe myths and values of their institutional environment, and\nirrespective of whether they wish to conform to these myths\nand values or not, people consequently contribute to the\nreproduction of the dominant discourse.\nAccording to P. Prasad (1997), organizations are places\nwhere colonial imprints are put into practice in the sense that\nthey contribute to the shaping of organizational values and\nactions. They are also, as scholars such as Gherardi (1994)\nand Pullen and Rhodes (2012) inform us, powerful places for\nthe (re)construction of gender. However, because the continu-\nous repetition has transformed them into taken-for-granted\nfeatures, it is a process that generally takes place unnoticed.\nLike our stereotyped images of culture, gender too passes, as\nPullen and Knights (2007) point out, \"as unnoticed, denied or\ndisavowed, partly because it is `done' routinely, repeatedly\nand unknowingly and with a degree of automaticity that con-\nceals its precariousness and performativity\" (p. 505). Keeping\nthis in mind, I ask to what extent these notions may influence\npublic employment officers and how much they are contribut-\ning to power asymmetries between them and those they are\nsupposed to assist in finding jobs. We further ask what atti-\ntudes they present when describing their encounters with\nfemale immigrants and to what extent colonial imprints are\ndiscursively reproduced in their accounts. One way to inves-\ntigate this is to combine postcolonial ideas with a discourse\nanalytic technique and scrutinize the language used by public\nemployment officers when they describe how they assist\nfemale immigrants to find jobs.\nDiscourse and Performativity\nAny presentation of discourse should perhaps start by paying\nhomage to de Saussure (1967), who introduced the idea that\nthe relationship between structure (langue) and practice\n(parole) is arbitrary; to Derrida (1967), who claimed that it is\nas a result of logocentrism that texts can be seen to be struc-\ntured around binary oppositions; to Lacan (1966), who\nclaimed that the idea of a true and whole self is a myth; and\nand the relations of power that characterize it are determined\nby discursive formations. Besides having been important\nsources of inspiration to postcolonial scholars (e.g., Bhabha,\n2001), they have also influenced scholars such as Fairclough\nturn have contributed to the expansion of discourse across\ndisciplines and to the development of CDA. Broadly under-\nstood as talk and texts embedded in powerful institutions and\npractices, CDA takes an interest in the exploration and delin-\neation of power relations in society. In practice, this approach\nto discourse generally combines discourse analytic tech-\nniques with a critical perspective to interrogate social phe-\nThere is, thus, a long tradition of critical research in the\nsocial sciences and humanities, but the view of what \"criti-\ncal\" means and how it is justified in different traditions var-\nies. Referred to as \"ideology critique,\" one of the versions of\n4 SAGE Open\ncritical discourse analysis targets the presumption, dissimu-\nlation, or manipulation of knowledge that shapes people's\nScholars within this tradition argue that power relations in\nsociety are accompanied by a hegemonic language that sys-\ntematically masks the world and claim that the aim of the\ncritique is, therefore, to subvert power by showing the reality\nbehind the ideology and what it really stands for (Winther\nJ\u00f8rgensen & Phillips, 1999). For example, although people\nmay say one thing, the continuous repetition of taken-for-\ngranted assumptions often makes them act in a completely\ndifferent way. Hence, the researcher's role is to unveil the\nideology so that people can see what is hidden behind it and\nget the chance to change the prevailing discourses. By and\nunderstanding of power as both productive and oppressive.\nan exclusively oppressive force, Foucault explains power\nboth as a discursively constructed subject position that peo-\nple occupy and perform and as the object of various dis-\ncourses that attempt to control and normalize people.\nDrawing on Bentham's design of a model prison, Foucault\n(1997) argues that all modern institutional forms mimic the\npatterns of a panopticon's way of organized surveillance and\nclaims that the establishment of rules and judgments around\nthe idea of norms \"has become one of the great instruments\nof power\" (p. 184). Rather than forcing people to follow the\nrules, according to Foucault, applying impersonal surveil-\nlance that produces subjects who act as if they are being con-\nstantly watched and thus discipline their own behavior so as\nto achieve normality has become a more successful means of\ncontrol in modern society.\nIn this article, we lean on the above approach to CDA, as\nI use CDA to challenge mainstream research and its essen-\ntialistic, monolithic, and static assumption regarding both\nculture and gender. We are particularly interested in how\npower asymmetries contribute to the reproduction of taken-\nfor-granted assumptions reminiscent of colonial culture and\ngender discourses. Said (1978) explains that language itself\nis a highly organized and encoded system, which uses many\ndevices to express, indicate, and exchange messages and\ninformation. Questioning whether there can be a true repre-\nsentation of anything, he concludes that \"we must be pre-\npared to accept the fact that a representation is eo ipso\nimplicated, intertwined, embedded, interwoven with a great\nmany other things besides the `truth,' which is itself a repre-\nRather than viewing culture and gender identities as\nessentialistic, monolithic, and static, we agree with the idea\nthat they are talked into being and performed according to\nprevailing discourses. As Perryman (2006) reminds us, the\nterm performativity was coined by Lyotard (1984), who, in\n\"The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge,\"\nargued that postmodern society is obsessed with efficiency\nand effectiveness, and that this efficiency is increasingly\n\"measured according to an input/output ratio\" (p. 88). Since\nthen, the idea of performativity has been used by a number of\nscholars who take an interest in the connection between\nstructures, institutions, and practice (Cameron, 1995;\nin her theory of performativity, Butler (1990) argues that\ngender identities do not simply exist; they are talked into\nbeing over time and are performed according to the dis-\ncourses that existed prior to one's performance of them. The\nidea that performativity is about performing the normal\nwithin a particular discourse is, as pointed out by Cameron\n(1995), equally valid for any fixed and substantive social\nlabel. The continuous striving for normality is also the reason\nwhy cultural and gender differences always need to be\nrepeated to be kept alive (Bhabha, 1994).\nDrawing on this insight, I argue that employment officers\nare socialized into prevailing discourses and influenced by\nmechanisms that impose efficiency (Lyotard, 1984) and nor-\nmality (Foucault, 1977). It is plausible to assume that they\nwill perform in accordance with prevailing discourses and, in\ntheir effort to obtain efficiency, will attempt to transform\nunemployed people into subjects who secure current dis-\ncourses, while excluding those deviating from normality.\nAnd as this often takes place routinely and unknowingly\n(Pullen & Knights, 2007), it is likely to favor power asym-\nmetries and the reproduction of prejudice about \"Others.\"\nThis may occur when values and behavior patterns are\nimposed on a person and/or when a person is reminded that\nhe or she does not belong. A classic example of the latter is\nprovided when a person with a foreign-sounding name, who\nlooks different or speaks with an accent, is asked where he or\nshe comes from and, hence, is presumed to be a foreigner.\nOther examples occur when it is presumed that he or she will\nnot behave according to the prevailing norms or when it is\npresumed that he or she lacks sufficient skills to perform effi-\nciently. The latter may occur due to differences in working\nmethods or when inadequate language skills are taken for\ngranted to hinder immigrants' work performance.\nIn this article, I will scrutinize the impact of power asym-\nmetries in the relationship between employment officers and\nunemployed female immigrants. I will pay particular attention\nto (a) how public employment officers make use of prevailing\ndiscourses to transform female immigrants from passive wel-\nfare beneficiaries into active and responsible job seekers, (b)\nhow prevailing discourses contribute to the reproduction of\nculture and gender differences reminiscent of colonial dis-\ncourses, and (c) how unequal power relations may favor the\nsegregation of mainstream and alternative cultures. These\nissues are interrelated, in the sense that they all contribute to\npower asymmetries related to the neocolonial discourse.\nMethodological Considerations and\nResearch Technique\nUsing the transcripts of our interviews, I sought to go beneath\nthe surface meaning in the participants'accounts and uncover\nthe meanings hidden within them (A. Prasad & Mir, 2002). I\nMoulettes 5\nused a convenience sampling as I was interested in the rich-\nness and nuances of the participants' accounts rather than\nfigures, objective facts, and general patterns (Broadbridge,\n2009). Given the limited number of participants, my study\ndoes not allow me to make any generalizations in the tradi-\ntional sense. Nevertheless, as Denzin and Lincoln (2000)\nargue, neither an individual nor a case is just an individual or\na case. The study of the particular is the study of the general,\nand the longer, more detailed, and more intensive the tran-\nscripts, the fewer the participants who are needed to saturate\nthe empirical material (Rudestam & Newton, 2007).\nThe sample included 12 in-depth interviews with public\nemployment officers in five PESA branches in the southern\npart of Sweden. The participants consisted of eight women\nand four men with different educational and career back-\ngrounds (e.g., they included a former teacher, a lawyer, a for-\nmer journalist, and several sociologists). They had worked\nfor between 1 and 25 years at the PESA. As it was important\nto the research that the participants should feel comfortable,\nI let them choose the location for the interview. In most\ncases, the choice fell on their office, while a coffee shop in\ntown and the home environment were chosen by some of the\nparticipants. The interviews lasted between 1 hr and 3 hr and\nwere transcribed word for word.\nAs the research was exploratory in nature, I wanted the\ninterviews to be respondent-driven rather than interview-\ndriven. The interviews were performed, therefore, as conver-\nsations instead of conventional interviews based on structural\nquestionnaires, which meant that I had prepared only some\nbroad questions that covered the main purpose of our\nresearch. It further meant that I had some general themes to\nguide the interviews, but I kept them as open as possible to\nallow respondents to answer as freely as they wished. The\ninterview technique I chose provided an opportunity for the\ninterviewees to reflect on the areas they found to be most\npertinent to the professional/client relationship. This meant\nthat in some instances, questions were initiated by the\nresearcher, while in other instances, they were asked as natu-\nral follow-ups to the preceding conversation. The chosen\napproach allowed for flexibility without a loss of focus on\nthe most salient points and enabled the collection of multi-\nlayered information without the superimposition of a rigid\nstructure by the researchers (Broadbridge, 2009). All meth-\nods have their advantages and disadvantages, and a research\nmethod based on a seemingly loose protocol is no exception.\nIts major disadvantage is that there is no guarantee that it will\nprovide a cohesive pattern, as the interviewees are allowed to\nspeak freely and tell their own stories. However, this can be\nseen as one of the advantages, as it may provide information\nthat would not be discovered in traditional interviews where\nstructured or semistructured questionnaires are used. Put\nbluntly, the stories that people provide may unveil attitudes\nthat would otherwise remain hidden.\nThe interview accounts analyzed in this study have been\nselected from a larger study of public and private labor\nmarket intermediaries' work in assisting immigrants to enter\nthe Swedish labor market. One reason for focusing on female\nimmigrants was that one of the questions asked in the larger\nstudy of the integration of immigrants was related to Bakshi\net al.'s (2009) earlier study, which showed that female immi-\ngrants receive less assistance from the public agency than do\nmen. Another reason was that the interviewees in the larger\nstudy often referred to female immigrants when they\nexplained how they helped immigrants to find jobs.\nAselection of material for an analysis is a sine qua non for\nany study, because for obvious reasons, it is neither useful\nnor even possible to include everything that is transcribed\nfrom interviews. As I wanted to draw attention to what is\noften silenced and suppressed due to the scholarly effort to\nobtain neutrality, I decided to interpret the accounts through\na postcolonial lens. It was thus important to select accounts\nthat contained material relevant to the aim of the article and\nto include statements about female immigrants. As a conse-\nquence of this process, the article does not provide a full pic-\nture of employment officers' perception of unemployed\nimmigrants. This means that the positive attitudes toward\nimmigration expressed by two of the interviewees, a man in\nhis 50s and a woman in her 30s, are not included in the analy-\nsis. Both of these interviewees defended immigrants' rights\nand emphasized the economic, social, and cultural benefits\nof immigration. They also expressed concerns about some of\ntheir colleagues' as well as employers' negative attitudes\ntoward immigrants.\nThe interviews were transcribed in Swedish and later\norganized into themes such as background and earlier experi-\nences, administration, receiving job seekers, and assisting\nimmigrants. The last-mentioned theme was divided into sub-\nthemes such as vocational guidance, vocational training,\nwork practice, attitudes toward immigrants, and statements\nabout female immigrants. In a second phase, a selection of\ninterview accounts that were considered especially interest-\ning for this article was translated into English. Due to the\ntranslation from Swedish to English, the excerpts do not\nalways render the exact words or expressions used. However,\nan effort was made to keep the translation as close as possi-\nble to the original texts.\nThe Swedish Public Employment\nService Agency\nThe first step toward the creation of a public employment\nagency was taken in 1940 with the establishment of the Labor\nMarket Commission. The aim was to help people earn their\nliving during World War II. Over time, the commission's\nactivities continually developed to reflect changes in the labor\nmarket and society. A major change came in the early 1990s,\nwhen public sector reforms became a priority and market\nsolutions were introduced within the PESA. Due to the influ-\nence of the neoliberal ideas that began to flourish in Europe in\nthe 1970s, new public management was implemented by the\n6 SAGE Open\nright-wing government of Sweden in the early 1990s as a\nway to come to terms with a bureaucracy that was considered\nby politicians to have grown out of proportion (Green-\nA significant change in employment officers' work rou-\ntines came with technological developments and the intro-\nduction of a standardized coding system aiming at facilitating\nlabor market control. This meant that the officers' conditions\nof work changed, in the sense that they now had to spend\nmore time at the computer producing statistics for the author-\nities. To make the system more efficient, new routines, such\nas individual activation plans and work applications reports,\nhave recently been introduced. The former are executed by\nthe employment officer at the first meeting with a client,\nwhile the latter, which aims at showing the unemployed per-\nsons' active search for a job, is produced on a regular basis\nby the unemployed persons themselves.\nAnother significant change came in 1993, when the\nemployment agency's monopoly expired and private labor\nmarket agencies were established Svensk f\u00f6r fattnings sam-\nling (SFS), 1993 [Swedish Code of Statutes]. However,\nalthough competition from private labor agencies is growing\nsteadily, job seekers are still obliged to visit the PESA on a\nregular basis to obtain their unemployment allowance.\nToday, the public employment service consists of 320 local\nbranches of the PESA and approximately 350 private\nemployment service agencies, of which 165 are operating as\ncoaching consultancies. The consultancies are financially\nsupported by the government but receive their clients from\nthe PESA.\nTransforming Clients From Passive\nWelfare Beneficiaries Into Active and\nResponsible Job Seekers\nOne of the reasons behind the implementation of market-\nbased reforms was the desire to provide cheaper and more\nefficient services (Green-Pedersen, 2002). Besides the fact\nthat officers have more clients to take care of, their adminis-\ntrative workload has also increased. Maria, a young employ-\nment officer, who had been at the agency for some years,\nexplained,\nI have one hour to prepare this [action plan] before I meet them\n[the clients]. \"Welcome to Sweden. I have 20 questions that I\nneed to ask you,\" dah, dah, dah . . . and that's it. \"I have written\nan action plan for you; here you are. This is our agreement.\nThank you and goodbye.\"\nJudging from Maria's account, it appears that she is not\nsatisfied with the current situation, as she now has to spend\nmore time at the computer, entering statistical data and pre-\nparing action plans, than in assisting her clients to find jobs.\nReflecting on how her work has changed, Maria explained,\nThere used to be those who literally took the immigrants by the\nhand and helped them getting to the right place. \"If you are\nunsure how to get to L., I can come with you.\" One might think\nthat it would be easy for them to get there by themselves,\nmaybe--if they have come all the way from Beirut . . . .\nEven if it was not part of their job description, some of her\ncolleagues used to help immigrants who, they considered,\nneeded special attention, to find their way to \"the right\nplace,\" which could be anything from a local authority office\nto an educational institution or a potential workplace. This\nkind of help was now considered too time-consuming and\ncostly and had therefore been abandoned. The abandonment\nof this kind of assistance may partly be explained by the gov-\nernment's effort to get rid of the image of Sweden as a\nbureaucratic nanny state (Green-Pedersen, 2002). However,\nMaria's statement also demonstrates that the officers' free-\ndom to act has been cut down and that they now are more\ncareful to perform according to the rules. An enhanced anxi-\nety among employment officers about being monitored was\nalso demonstrated in the interview with Marta, who, although\nshe was promised anonymity, was careful about her answers\nand, in response to several of the questions, claimed she did\nnot have the necessary statistics to answer them. Besides\ndemonstrating the existence of power asymmetries between\nemployment officers and their supervisors, the officers'\napparently enhanced caution may be seen as an indicator of\npanoptic performativity (Foucault, 1977).\nSupportive Activities for Those Who Deserve\nThem\nThe idea of the active society is that exclusion from the labor\nmarket can be avoided through social and cultural investment\n(Caswell, Marston, & Elm Larsen, 2010). In Sweden, this\nidea manifests itself in a push for cultural and social invest-\nment to counteract the exclusion of marginalized groups from\nthe labor market. At the time of the study, some of the staff\nmembers at one of the employment offices I visited were\nworking on the guidelines for a new integration policy for\nnewly arrived immigrants, which was going to be imple-\nmented later that year. Martin, an employment agency man-\nager, and one of the people responsible for this task, speaks as\na representative for the professional core when he explains\nthe politicians' intention in implementing the reform:\nWithin this new reform that we are preparing . . . there's a very\nimportant economic \"incentive,\" that is, you can no longer take\nadvantage of the Social Services Act and say that we have this\nfamily that needs money. Every adult has to apply for financial\nsupport and participate in activities to get it. This means that\n[for] the family or the woman . . . or whoever takes the ultimate\ndecision in the family that someone shouldn't work but stay\nhome and take care of the household and the children, it will hit\nthem financially.\nMoulettes 7\nWhat Martin describes is a reform that encourages a pol-\nicy where welfare benefits are associated with economic\nsanctions. Hence, the reform is intended to encourage all\nadult family members to register at the employment office,\nbut it is particularly intended to put pressure on female immi-\ngrants to leave their lives as housewives and register as job\nseekers. The idea that female immigrants often stay at home\nto take care of their families is a view that most employment\nofficers share; they also believe it to be the main reason why\nfemale immigrants receive less support from the PESA than\nmale immigrants do. According to employment officers'\nstatements, female immigrants' absence from working life\nfor an extended period of time is also believed to make their\nlater entry into the labor market more difficult. Philip, an\nemployment officer specializing in coaching, was one of\nthose who made the connection between child care and the\ndifficulty of finding employment on later entry to the labor\nmarket:\nI believe that [the difficulty] is because female immigrants stay\nhome and take care of their children. They stay away from\nworking life 10 years before they register. They take care of their\nfamilies. That's not common among Swedish women. Female\nimmigrants who have stayed home and taken care of their\nchildren are very far from the labor market.\nWhen Cesar was asked whether women are equally sup-\nported (i.e., to the same extent as men), he replied,\nYes, all clients are equally supported. We support them as much\nas we can. We even offer a coach who can assist them in finding\na position as a trainee. But as a trainee you have to show that you\ndeserve the job. So what happens if you stay home for a couple\nof days? [The mothers get a] call from the day care center and\nwell . . . there are women . . . I have heard them; [the preschool\nteachers] call them and say their child has got a cold and [the\nmothers] stop (ha-ha) and say, \"I'm on my way.\"\nJudging by Cesar's statement, one possible explanation\nfor the higher unemployment rate among female immigrants\nseems to be that they cannot be trusted to give their time to\ntheir jobs while they invest so much time in their children.\nThis seems to be what Cesar is suggesting when he explains\nthat these women will leave their job when they get a \"call\nfrom the day care center\" telling them that \"their child has\ngot a cold.\" Apparently, a job-seeking mother should not pri-\noritize her children. It would be intriguing to ask what a\nSwedish parent (man or woman) would do in this situation.\nBesides the fact that Cesar's conclusion is simplistic and\nbiased, it reproduces an image of female immigrants as a\nhomogeneous group of child producers who cannot be\ntrusted in employment as long as they give priority to their\nchildren. In this respect, Cesar seems to believe that all\nwomen coming from outside the Western world can be cate-\ngorized as one homogeneous group of unreliable female\nimmigrants. Cesar's statement that \"as a trainee you have to\nshow that you deserve the job\" indicates that the help offered\nis not guided by a genuine concern for clients' needs but\nrather conditioned by a counter performance. In this particu-\nlar case, the counter performance consists of showing that\none has proven to be worthy of a job. Unemployed female\nimmigrants, thus, seem to correspond to what Caswell et al.\n(2010) refer to as \"at risk\" clients, over whom officials, as\nprofessionals, have the power to generate consequences\n(Jenkins, 2000) if clients are not willing to adjust to the pre-\nvailing conditions and act as responsible job seekers. Besides\ndemonstrating the existence of power asymmetries between\nagency officers and the unemployed, Cesar's statement indi-\ncates that the officers, as professionals, feel they are being\nput under enhanced pressure to normalize female immi-\ngrants, so as to make them seem more employable.\nCorrection of Cultural Flaws to Maintain the\nNotion of Cultural Superiority\nThe interview accounts further reveal how the officials guide\ntheir clients to make them more attractive in entering the\nlabor market. An important feature of this work is to con-\nvince the immigrants of the importance of adjusting to\nSwedish culture. The view that cultural differences are flaws\nthat need to be corrected is illustrated in the following\naccount provided by Karin:\nWell, take the teaching profession, for example, where you have\ndifferent school systems in different countries and where you\nhave different views on teaching methods and we have our view.\nI had this problem with a woman from the Balkans once. There\nwere quite a few people from the Balkans who . . . it was more\nabout teaching methods and things like that. All the children are\nforced to write with their right hand. Such a teaching method\ndoes not work in the Swedish school. . . . But then I sit here as a\nwicked person when I tell this woman who has this education\nand who has worked for many years at home, \"You have to\nreconsider. You have to take a supplementary course.\" . . . If you\nare a craftsman you can work as a trainee in a company and a\ncompetent supervisor can make an evaluation and say, \"Yes, he\nknows this and this, but he seems to use other methods than the\nones we are used to and needs to learn how we work.\"\nKarin highlights the differences between countries with\nregard to teaching methods and ways of working. In doing\nso, she implies that other educational systems do not match\nthe Swedish standard and that immigrants therefore need to\ntake supplementary courses. She is unwavering in her belief\nthat the supervisor is \"competent,\" and she uses the example\nof different teaching methods to exclude a client from a pro-\nfession. She implicitly suggests that all members of a spe-\ncific group need further education to live up to Swedish\nstandards, rather than acknowledging that the Swedish sys-\ntem may benefit from incoming knowledge and practices. By\ndoing so, she reproduces a notion of logocentrism (Derrida,\n1967), which by its emphasis on ethnocentrism favors the\n8 SAGE Open\nimage of a Westernized center. The example given above\nindicates that help has become an instrument of training\n(Gronemeyer, 2010), in which the participants' cultural\nadjustment is an important component. For the sake of eco-\nnomic development, it is apparently not the needs of the indi-\nviduals that are prioritized, but society's need for cultural\nhomogeneity. It may seem a bit strange, though, that some-\nthing that seems so trivial should require so much further\neducation. However, the search for differences even in the\nmost trivial things may be seen as a strategy to keep the\nimage of cultural differences alive (Bhabha, 1994). Because\nthere were other interviewees who provided similar exam-\nples (e.g., that painters in Sweden learn to paint vertically,\nwhile painters in some other countries learn to paint horizon-\ntally), one may wonder whether the emphasis on further edu-\ncation is just used as a pretext or whether it is grounded on\nthe presumption that the educational system in other coun-\ntries never lives up to the Swedish standard.\n\"A Good Performance\" Needs Appropriate\nClothing?\nImplicit in the deficit discourse, one can discern the impor-\ntance of making immigrants break with their past to become\nintegrated into Swedish society. The call for adjustment\nreflects a fear of difference or a fear of the possible superior-\nity that the others might possess and what it might do to cul-\n1978). What is frightening today seems to be the influence of\nnon-Western cultures, and not least Islam and women dressed\nin veils. For example, while referring to a Muslim woman\nwho had refused to remove her headscarf when offered a\nposition as a trainee in a restaurant, Lisa, a career adviser,\nshared her own opinion of the political debate about the\nburka:\n. . . to get a job I do think that you actually may need to take off\nyour headscarf. For example, there was this discussion about the\nburka in preschool and in this case I do think that you should\ntake it off when you are at work . . . so that you are able to do a\ngood job. Then, in your private life, you can wear it if you like.\nLisa's description conveys a value judgment about\nMuslim women's style of dress, ultimately explaining that\nshe feels the implementation of a restriction is necessary for\na client to get a job. It is unclear, however, what kind of\nheadscarf or other covering she is referring to in this state-\nment and whether she makes a distinction between different\nkinds of coverings or not. Nevertheless, she considers them\ninappropriate clothing during working hours. She does not\nclarify what she means by \"doing a good job,\" and in what\nway a headscarf may be in conflict with a professional role\nand how it may hinder work performance. Yet her observa-\ntion implies that wearing any piece of unconventional cloth-\ning is unsuitable and might have consequences for the\nemployer. What is interesting about statements such as these\nis the frequency with which the \"headscarf issue\" surfaces\nwhenever integration is discussed, but not in terms of the\nactual way in which it can cause a problem in a Swedish\nworkplace. It is also surprising that Lisa refers to the wearing\nof a burka in preschools, considering that the number of\nwomen wearing the burka is strictly limited in Sweden and\nthus the use of this covering in schools does not seem to con-\nstitute a real problem. Whatever Lisa's general intention may\nbe, the statement reflects the impact of the social disadvan-\ntage that the headscarf is causing to the women who wear it\nand the anti-Muslim sentiments that have become a frequent\nfeature in the Western world including Sweden. The state-\nment also indicates that there is a link between the fear of\nmean for our supposed cultural identity. The discursive prac-\ntice of marginalizing those considered different demonstrates\npower inequality and the supremacy given to one's own\nculture.\nExercise of Power in the Name of Civilization\nMuslim culture is clearly regarded with suspicion, but this\nextends to any unfamiliar culture, behavior, and custom. An\nexample of suspicion of unfamiliar behavior is provided by\nEva, who admits to being provoked when a woman arrives at\na scheduled meeting accompanied by her husband:\nI have worked with many women . . . women who come from\nother cultures, where their husbands come along and insist in\njoining the discussion because they have this feudal culture. In\nthose cases . . . I don't think it's OK. We have to follow human\nrights. We have to follow the democratic principles and so forth.\n. . . But it's difficult because these women have to straighten\ntheir backs. I can say, \"No, I don't accept\" [that they bring their\nhusbands along to the meeting] and book a new appointment.\nThe example demonstrates how Eva makes use of her\npower as a professional to correct female immigrants' behav-\nior to make them adjust to what is presumably the expected\nbehavior in Swedish culture. It further demonstrates how the\nreproduction of colonial imprints is used in practice. Judging\nfrom Eva's statement, the type of behavior she describes is\nsimply not acceptable in a modern and democratic society.\nAccording to her, couples such as the one she describes come\nfrom a \"feudal culture\" that does not respect \"human rights\"\nand \"democratic principles.\" So now when they live in\nSweden, these women have to learn how to \"straighten their\nbacks,\" by which Eva presumably means that they have to\nbecome more independent. She assumes these women are\noppressed, that is, that their husbands prevent them from\ninteracting with society on their own terms, while instead\nthey may be bringing their husbands along for mental support\nor because they feel insecure about their Swedish language\nskills. Eva's use of words such as \"feudal,\" \"human rights,\"\nMoulettes 9\nand \"democracy\" disclose her view of her clients'cultures as\nbackward and undemocratic and, hence, an assumption that\nall women in these countries are oppressed by their hus-\nbands. If in fact this is her assumption, it could be argued that\nthese women are regarded as supplemental not only by their\nhusbands but also by the employment officers.\nBesides expressing a stereotypical and depreciatory view\nof both men and women from \"other cultures,\" Eva's state-\nment seems to be grounded in a fear that stems from views\nsimilar to those Lisa expressed about Muslim women who\nwear a headscarf. In essence, this line of thought corresponds\nto Jackson et al.'s (2001) suggestion that threat is the closest\nculturally universal link to prejudice and racism and the way\nin which people behave toward outgroups. The statements\nquoted above illustrate how power is exercised by the use of\nwords derived from the language of the dominant cultural\ndiscourse. Rather than taking a serious interest in diversity,\nthe statements point at the importance of protecting the\nnotion of cultural homogeneity. Besides supporting\nMeyerson's (2003) argument that people take advantage of\nthe language of the dominant culture, the statements show\nthat people also act in accordance with dominant ideas within\nthe institutional environment. This way of positioning domi-\nnance over female immigrants is clearly reminiscent of colo-\nnialism and its idea that failure to achieve a particular level\nof civilization must be corrected for development to take\nplace.\nConclusion\nWhat we have been concerned with in this article is how pub-\nlic employment officers discursively describe how they\nassist female immigrants in finding jobs. I have argued that\nthe transfer to a neoliberal society has affected public\nemployment officers' working conditions and that they have\nbeen equipped with tools aiming at facilitating a transforma-\ntion of clients from passive welfare beneficiaries into active\njob seekers. The aims set out in this article were to show (a)\nhow public employment officers make use of prevailing dis-\ncourses to transform female immigrants from passive wel-\nfare beneficiaries into active and responsible job seekers, (b)\nhow prevailing discourses contribute to the reproduction of\nculture and gender differences reminiscent of colonial dis-\ncourses, and (c) how unequal power relations may favor the\nsegregation of mainstream and alternative cultures.\nThe findings of the study indicate that employment offi-\ncers are working under increased pressure owing to a grow-\ning number of clients and changes in working routines.\nSociety's enhanced striving for efficiency probably puts\npressure on employment officers, as they, in their role as civil\nservants, have to follow political directives as well as meet\nemployers' requirements for a supply of appropriately com-\npetent workers. Furthermore, it is likely that the high unem-\nployment rate among immigrants and the fact that\nemployment officers have now been made responsible for\nmaking the immigrants employable have put even more\npressure on them.\nThe findings further demonstrate that some employment\nofficers blame immigrants' difficulty in finding jobs on their\nlack of education and cultural adjustment. This is manifested\nin the officers' discursive accounts and their performance as\ncultural role models, for example, when advising Muslim\nwomen to take off their headscarves in work-related situa-\ntions and when implicitly telling a female immigrant to\nbecome independent by adjourning a meeting because the\nfemale is accompanied by her husband. Taking into account\nthat one of the ideas behind the implementation of new pub-\nlic management was to make public organizations more effi-\ncient by measuring employees' performances, it may seem\nnatural to the officers to put the blame on immigrants'lack of\ncultural adjustment, because although the placement of\nimmigrants is beyond the officers'control, they may fear that\nthe difficulty in integrating immigrants into the labor market\nwill have a negative effect on the officers' performance mea-\nsures. This may be one explanation of the fact that female\nimmigrants are being presented as liabilities, who need to be\ncorrected to fit a supposedly necessary cultural mold. This\nmay explain why the higher unemployment rate among\nfemale immigrants is blamed on a lack of education and cul-\ntural adjustment.\nHowever, employment officers' discursive accounts seem\nparadoxical, as, on one hand, they lay stress on individuals'\nneed to take responsibility for finding a job, and, on the other,\nthey perceive of themselves as responsible for presenting\nemployable job seekers to the labor market. The policy of\nblame implicit in employment officers'emphasis on a lack of\neducation and cultural adjustment seems in this respect to\nsupport Eskelinen, Olesen, and Caswell's (2010) suggestion\nthat it is the employability of the clients rather than their situ-\nation that is the focus of employment officers' attention. It\nalso seems to support Esses et al.'s (2006) finding that cur-\nrent activation policies seek to mold unemployed people to\nfit them into changed conditions on the labor market. This in\nturn indicates that employment officers act under the influ-\nence of the dominant discourses and favor the \"work should\nbe rewarded\" strategy set out by governments to reward the\nworking population and thereby tone down the \"nanny state\"\nimage (Green-Pedersen, 2002). Considering, however, that\nthe number of unemployed in Sweden at present amounts to\nlation) while the available vacancies are estimated at approx-\nrather demoralizing strategy by the unemployed, who,\ndespite their desires and efforts, remain outside the labor\nmarket.\nThe findings further demonstrate how prejudices about\nfemale immigrants are being reproduced in employment offi-\ncers' discursive accounts. It demonstrates how female immi-\ngrantsarebeingdiscursivelylinkedtogetherasahomogeneous\ngroup of non-Western, perpetually pregnant housewives with\nlittle education. The findings further demonstrate that cate-\ngorizing immigrants as \"the others\" and ascribing stereotypi-\ncal qualities to them supports Meyer and Rowan's (1977)\nargument that people seek conformity and rely on myth and\ninstitutional values. The depreciatory views of female immi-\ngrants that some of the employment officers express indicate\nthat these officials, besides being constrained in a profes-\nsional role, are constrained by taken-for-granted assumptions\nabout immigrants and their background. The findings dem-\nonstrate how stereotyped and prejudiced images reminiscent\nof colonial discourse are put into discursive practice through\nroutines and tacit repetitions, thereby reinforcing the contin-\nuance of inequality and marginalization (P. Prasad, 1997;\nPullen & Knights, 2007). They also reveal how people unre-\nflectively lean on dominant discourses of differences charac-\nterized by ethnocentrism and cultural singularities (e.g.,\nHofstede, 2001), and how prejudices about female immi-\ngrants are normalized through the continuous reproduction\nof cultural hierarchy and patriarchy (Lugones, 2000; Said,\n1978). Judging by the examples provided by the employment\nofficers, it is evident that the immigrants find themselves in\nan inferior position that they have no or little power to\nchange. Their future in the labor market is in that sense very\nmuch in the hands of the employment officers.\nFurthermore, the continuous reproduction of dominant\ndiscourses means that competing discourses are excluded\nand that the concept of diversity is narrowed down to super-\nficial, essentialistic, dichotomized, and hierarchically\nordered categories of culture and gender. What is ignored in\nthe dominant discourses is that culture, independent of time\nand space, may travel across borders and transform itself into\nhybrid forms; that people have different histories and experi-\nence culture differently; and that countries are therefore\ncharacterized by cultural fragmentation (Bhabha, 1994;\nDiMaggio, 1997) rather than by fixed and homogeneous\nentities. The desire to make unemployed immigrants adjust\nto the norms points at the fact that the integration of immi-\ngrants follows the process of hegemony, privileging self\nwhile neglecting values and behavior systems that deviate\nfrom the norm. In response to the question on the effects of\nunequal power relations, it could thus be argued that unequal\npower relations between employment officers and immi-\ngrants favor the segregation of mainstream and alternative\ncultures.\nOne conclusion that can be drawn from the findings of the\nstudy is that integration is hard to achieve as long as immi-\ngrants are objectified and treated as \"the others,\" and no sin-\ncere effort is made to recognize them as individuals or to\nadmit our own bias and the fact that we may be blinded by\nethnocentrism and Western epistemology. From this perspec-\ntive, discrimination awareness training among employment\nofficers may be one way to confront the privileging of self at\nthe expense of others and their value systems. Bearing in\nmind that research addressing discrimination against immi-\ngrants in the labor market to date has been fairly limited in\nSweden, more research on this issue is needed. Because cat-\negorizations are always accompanied by human judgments,\nthere is a risk that those considered too difficult to help will\nbe unfairly classified in the coding system used at the\nemployment agency's offices. This leads me to the proposi-\ntion that more research should be carried out in connection\nwith the relationship between the classification system and\ndiscrimination against immigrants.\nHowever, as the blame placed on unemployed immi-\ngrants' lack of cultural adjustments may be a symptom of a\ndysfunctional system, this is probably not enough. What we\npropose is research focusing on structural changes and the\ntransformation of work and its consequences for immigrants'\nemployability. Studies of immigrants and their experiences\ncould help address potential problems embedded in the cur-\nrent system. For example, instead of evaluating employment\nofficers' performances based on measurements connected to\njob placement rates, evaluations could be carried out through\na survey of immigrants enrolled at the employment agency.\nAlso, considering that immigrants' voices are seldom heard,\naudit studies focusing on their experiences of the employ-\nment agency and their interactions with employment officers\ncould contribute to a further deepening of insights into\nemployment officers' role in the integration process. What\nwe suggest is studies investigating immigrants' opinions of\nthe employment agency and the help they receive from the\nemployment officers. What difficulties do they come across\nin their encounter with the PESA? Would their chances of\nfinding a job be improved if more time was spent on assisting\nthem to find a job rather than on administration? This leads\nto the question of whether there are alternative and more effi-\ncient ways to organize the employment agency's offices and\nemployment officers' work tasks. Another area of investiga-\ntion should focus on the ways in which immigrants resist the\nemployment agency. How do unemployed immigrants\nexpress their exclusion from the labor market? How do they\nresist employment officers' advice? Also, in consideration of\ntechnological advances such as computerization, robotiza-\ntion, and outsourcing, it could be worthwhile to investigate\nthe transformation of work and its future consequences for\nthose who are the most affected by unemployment, for exam-\nple, immigrants and women. Will further technological\nadvances make it easier or harder for immigrants to enter the\nlabor market?\nFinally, with new public management having been in\npractice for three decades, it has become more and more\nobvious that it has not been the success that politicians had\nhoped for. With regard to labor market policies and the inte-\ngration of immigrants, the question is whether it is not time\nto reevaluate the efficiency of the market-based reforms. A\nrecent survey (Holmberg & Sommerstein, 2013) of Swedes'\nconfidence in public institutions showed, for instance, that\nthe PESA ranked as the least successful performer. One of\nthe factors contributing to this crisis of confidence may be\nthe fact that the implementation of market-based reforms has\nleft the employment officers with too much power to steer\nand control the unemployed and too little power for the latter\nto decide on their own lives. Perhaps this is an indicator that\nthe time has come to take Denhardt and Denhardt's (2006)\nsuggestion into consideration and implement a more service-\nminded model based on negotiations, dialogue, and responsi-\nbility that is shared between the PESA and the unemployed\njob seekers.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAinsworth, S., & Hardy, C.
