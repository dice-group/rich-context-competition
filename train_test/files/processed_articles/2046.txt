Research\nhas revealed that even modest weight loss (5\u00ad10% decrease\nof initial body weight) is favorable, as it is associated with\nimprovement in blood pressure, lipid profile, and glycemic\ncontrol (4\u00ad6); thus, the reduction of excess weight is a target\nfor study and intervention.\nStill, despite the documented benefits of weight loss for over-\nweight and obese individuals, the prevalence of weight loss\neffort among overweight and obese individuals is relatively low.\nData from the National Health Interview Survey indicate that\nfewer than half of overweight men and women and less than\ntwo thirds of obese men and women were attempting weight\nloss in 1998 (7). Research suggests that physician involvement\nin weight loss is associated with increased intention to lose\nweight, commencement of weight loss, and improved weight\nloss maintenance in overweight and obese patients (8\u00ad10).\nHowever, physician care of obesity is infrequent and incon-\nsistent (11\u00ad13), and physicians are selective when diagnosing\noverweight and prescribing weight loss (11\u00ad14). Furthermore,\nphysicians are generally unfamiliar with the thresholds for\nobesity and abdominal obesity that indicate increased cardio\nmetabolic risk (15); thus, although physicians recognize that\ncounseling on weight loss is an essential component of their\nclinical practice (16), overweight and obese individuals may go\nundiagnosed.\nSome research suggests that counseling for weight manage-\nment delivered by health professionals may be decreasing over\ntime (17\u00ad19). However, the secular trends of physician diag-\nnosis of overweight and obesity and physician-directed weight\nloss during the past 20 years, using nationally representative\ndata and objectively measured height and weight, have yet\nto be examined at length. Furthermore, little is known about\nthe concurrent secular trends of self-care of overweight and\n\nobesity among adults in the United States.\nThus, the objectives of the following analysis were to evaluate\nthe secular trends in the care of overweight (diagnosed over-\nweight and directed weight loss), to investigate the association\nbetween obesity and care of overweight in primary care over\ntime, and by comorbidity status, and to examine the associa-\ntion between obesity and self-care of overweight over time.\nSecular Trends in the Diagnosis and Treatment\nof Obesity Among US Adults in the Primary\nCare Setting\nErika A. Yates1, Alison K. Macpherson1 and Jennifer L. Kuk1\nExcess weight afflicts the majority of the US adult population. Research suggests that the role of primary care\nphysicians in reducing overweight and obesity is essential; moreover, little is known about self-care of obesity. This\nreport assessed the secular trends in the care of overweight and investigated the secular association between obesity\nwith care of overweight in primary care and self-care of overweight. Cross-sectional evaluation of the National Health\nthe total sample comprised 31,039 nonpregnant adults aged 20\u00ad90 years. The relationship between diagnosed\noverweight, and directed weight loss with time and obesity was assessed. Despite the combined secular increase\nsecular change in the odds of being diagnosed overweight by a physician when adjusted for covariates; however,\noverweight and obese individuals were 40 and 42% less likely to self-diagnose as overweight, and 34 and 41% less\nlikely to self-direct weight loss in 2008 compared to 1994, respectively. Physicians were also significantly less likely to\ndirect weight loss for overweight and obese adults with weight-related comorbidities across time (P < 0.05). Thus, the\nsurveillance of secular trends reveals that the likelihood of physician- and self-care of overweight decreased between\n1994 and 2008 and further highlights the deficiencies in the management of excess weight.\n1Faculty of Health, School of Kinesiology & Health Science, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Starting in 1999, NHANES became a continuous survey\nthat released data on a biannual basis.\nFor data obtained at the mobile examination center, medical techni-\ncians undergo extensive training prior to and during data collection; all\nanthropometrics were measured during the physical examination and\ncomputed as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.\nWaist circumference was measured to the nearest 0.1cm at the midaxil-\nlary line of the body. Standard BMI categories for normal weight, over-\nweight, and obese, and sex-specific cutoffs for waist circumference (men:\nPhysician- and self-diagnosis of overweight and physician- and self-\ndirected weight loss were assessed using data collected by questionnaire;\nquestionnaire data assessing the care of obesity were not available in\nNHANES; thus, the assessment of diagnosis and treatment of over-\nweight were utilized in this analysis to represent that of excess weight as\na whole. Respondents were asked if ever told by a doctor that they were\noverweight, if ever told by a doctor to lose weight for hypertension or\nhypercholesterolemia, if they considered themselves overweight, and if\nthey had attempted weight loss during the previous 12 months. To evalu-\nate secular trends and associations, the survey year was used to represent\ntime. The combined sample (composed of NHANES III and NHANES\ncontinuous surveys) included 103,577 adults (total screened sample);\nafter exclusions, the combined sample comprised 31,039 nonpregnant\nadults, 20\u00ad90 years of age.

The unadjusted,\nweighted secular prevalence of overweight and obesity, diagnosed over-\nweight and directed weight loss, was assessed using the survey frequency\nprocedure; changes over time in these measures were examined using\ntrend analysis by logistic regression.

All analyses were performed\nusing SAS statistical software (version 9.2) (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\nAll multivariate analyses were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education\nlevel, and smoking status. Analyses of physician-diagnosed overweight,\nphysician-directed weight loss for hypertension, and physician-directed\nweight loss for hypercholesterolemia were further adjusted for health\ninsurance; the analysis of physician-directed weight loss for hyperten-\nsion was restricted to those taking antihypertensive medication, and the\nanalysis of physician-directed weight loss for hypercholesterolemia was\nrestricted to those taking lipid-lowering medication.\nResults\nWeighted sample characteristics are reported in Table 1.\nSecular prevalence of diagnosed overweight\nand directed weight loss\nNearly 70% of respondents were classified as overweight or\nsimilar increases in abdominal obesity were observed (results\nnot presented).

Accordingly, we elected to\nstratify the models by BMI category (overweight, obese) to\nfurther evaluate the interaction between time and BMI.\nThe secular evaluation of care of obesity herein is relative to\n1994 (the earliest year of measurement), with the exception\nof physician-diagnosed overweight, where 2000 is the earliest\nyear of measurement.

Similarly, overweight\nand obese individuals were less likely to be physician- or self-\ndirected to lose weight across time.\nEvidence suggests that the threshold for self-classification as\noverweight has increased during the past two decades (22\u00ad24).\nThat, in this analysis, overweight respondents were 29\u00ad42%\nless likely to self-diagnose as overweight in years successive to\n1994 may reflect the shifting threshold for self-perception of\noverweight across time. Evidence also reveals that self-reported\nideal body weight has increased over time (25,26). As those\nwho are satisfied with body weight are less likely to perceive\na weight problem (26), it is thus plausible that the decreasing\nlikelihood of self-diagnosed overweight over time observed in\nthis analysis is in part a product of these trends. Furthermore,\nresearch suggests that obesity in one's social network may\ninfluence acceptance of increased weight and may encourage\npoor eating and exercise behavior (27).

It has also been demonstrated that the tendency\nto misperceive BMI status affects physicians (28). Furthermore,\nthe BMI cutoffs used to classify adults as overweight were low-\nered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from\nPhysicians who were not aware of this change may have been\nless likely to diagnose overweight patients as such until they\nreached a greater BMI. Alternatively, these results may reflect\nthe tendency for physicians to skip making a clinical diagnosis\nof overweight; it is plausible that physicians may be prioritizing\nother issues in primary care ahead of documenting overweight\nas a clinical diagnosis. This possibility is even more compelling\nwhen considering that physicians often cite lack of time as a\nbarrier to the delivery of weight management counseling in\nTo investigate secular trends in physician-directed weight\nloss, directed weight loss among those with hypertension and\nhypercholesterolemia was evaluated. Overweight and obese\nindividuals with hypertension and overweight individuals\nwith hypercholesterolemia were significantly less likely to be\ndirected to lose weight by a physician across time. It is possible\nthat the pessimism among physicians in primary care about\nthe efficacy of weight loss counseling (11,12) may be contribut-\ning to these trends. Furthermore, reports indicate that the use\nof antihypertensive medication (33) and lipid-lowering agents\n(34) has increased significantly during the past two \ndecades.\nThe widespread popularity and selection of medications to\nmanage obesity-related comorbidities, combined with the lack\nof pharmaceutical treatment options for weight management,\nare likely contributing to the tendency among physicians to\naddress weight-related comorbidities with pharmaceutical\noptions rather than with weight reduction, even though weight\nreduction as a treatment for hypertension and hypercholeste-\nrolemia is endorsed by national guidelines (35,36).\nA growing body of evidence suggests that provider-directed\nweight reduction is associated with greater intentions to lose\nweight and commencement of weight loss among patients\n(8,10,17), and patients with whom the physician has greater\ncontact are more likely to be counseled on weight loss (12,18).\nThough physician involvement in weight management is by\nno means fulfilled by diagnosing a patient as overweight or\nprescribing weight loss, the monitoring of these behaviors\nnonetheless provides an indication of how the weight\nmanagement practices of US physicians are changing over\ntime. In this analysis, we observed that physicians are no\nmore likely to engage in weight management practices with\ntheir patients across time, despite the rise in obesity and the\ngreater frequency of visits to primary care by obese adults\ncompared to their normal weight counterparts (37). However,\nnumerousbarrierstoweight-relatedcounselinghavebeencited\nfrequently by physicians, including lack of time (11,29), lack\nof reimbursement (13,29), and poor confidence, knowledge,\nand experience in weight-related counseling (11,13,14); these\nfactors may, in part, explain the stagnant rates of provider-care\nof obesity. Additionally, though Medicare policy was revised in\n2004 stipulating the removal of language inferring that obesity\nshall not be considered an illness (38), research indicates that\nlittle more than financing bariatric surgery for patients with\ncomorbid conditions is available as a treatment option for\nobesity (39). Medicaid coverage of obesity assessment and\ntreatment in primary care is reflective of the limited scope\nof the Medicare policy (39). The secular interplay of obesity-\nrelated action among physicians in primary care and cited\nbarriers warrants further investigation.\nSeveral limitations of this analysis exist. Although the use\nof multiple surveys allowed for the evaluation of trends over\ntime, it also introduced potential inconsistencies between\nquestionnaires because of varying survey protocols, and the\nunavailability of data in some surveys limited the secular eval-\nuation of some analyses. Another inherent limitation is the use\nof self-reported data. Though the potential for respondents to\nmisreport information is a possibility, alternative methods for\ncollecting information on physician activity were not avail-\nable. Moreover, there were few questions assessing care of\nexcess weight available in NHANES; thus, we were unable to\naddress care of overweight, obesity, and abdominal obesity, as\nseparate entities; and, how recently physicians diagnosed over-\nweight and directed weight loss is not known. Additionally,\nchanging treatment option availability for obesity and obesity-\nrelated comorbidities over time introduces the possibility of\ninconsistency in the physician-directed weight loss variables.\nFurthermore, a large portion of the combined sample was\nexcluded from analysis (missing data for age, sex, and BMI),\nand we were unable to weight the multivariate analyses; thus,\nthese results cannot be generalized to the US population.\nThis study illuminates the lack of physician and individual\ndiagnosis of overweight and direction of weight loss between\nto the scarcity in the care of obesity in the United States and\nprovides the support needed for physicians, individuals, and\npolicy makers alike to address the deficiencies in the diagno-\nsis and treatment of obesity in the primary care setting and\nelsewhere.\n"
