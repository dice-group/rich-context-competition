Two key health-related behaviors in-\ncluded in the NSHAP survey are smoking and alcohol use.\nThe impact of these behaviors on health is well established.\nIn NSHAP, one of the primary interests is in how the degree\nto which individuals engage in these behaviors mediates the\nrelationship between social relationships and health. Higher\nquality social relationships, for instance, are associated with\nlower risk of problem drinking (Grzywacz & Marks, 2000).\nBoth close and distant ties in social networks influence\nsmoking behavior, and conversely, smoking influences the\nquality of social relationships, with smokers having more\nperipheral positions in their social networks than nonsmok-\nIn this paper, we describe the measures of smoking behav-\niors and alcohol use collected in the first wave of NSHAP,\nincluding their distributions by gender and age. We describe\nconstruction of widely used derived measures that are readily\nobtained from the NSHAP core variables, discuss key prop-\nerties of these variables, and present examples of associations\namong them. In addition to self-report of tobacco use, NS-\nHAP provides a biological marker of this activity, cotinine,\nwhich we describe in detail, with examination of its relation-\nship to selected self-reported smoking behaviors. Other\nhealth-related behaviors assessed by NSHAP, but not consid-\nered here, include physical exercise, sleep, elements of sexual\nbehavior, and certain aspects of health care utilization.\nThe remainder of the article is organized as follows. A\nMethods section briefly summarizes relevant aspects of the\nsurvey design, data collection methods, biomeasure pro-\ncessing, and the data analytic approach, followed by sepa-\nrate sections for alcohol consumption, self-reported smoking\nbehaviors, and the biological marker of tobacco exposure,\ncotinine. Each of the domain-specific sections includes a\ndescription of the measures and their properties, their distri-\nbutions by age group and gender, selected associations\namong the measures, response rates, and a brief discussion.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Data Collection\nNSHAP Wave 1 data were collected during in-home\nsample of 3,005 community-dwelling U.S. residents,\naged 57\u00ad85 years.

The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) assessed smoking behaviors and alcohol use\nas factors directly related to physical health, well-being, and social relationships. We describe self-report measures of tobacco\nand alcohol use, as well as an established biological marker of tobacco exposure, cotinine, collected in Wave 1 of NSHAP.\nMethods. We compare smoking behaviors and alcohol use by gender and age group. We report on derived measures\nof alcohol consumption and tobacco exposure widely used in medical and substance use literature, compare current and\npast users, and describe associations between self-reported smoking status and cotinine.\nResults. Men are more likely than women to report alcohol use, potential problem drinking, and ever smoking. Alco-\nhol use and smoking are lower among older age groups. Although current smoking is less prevalent than in the general\nU.S. adult population, 50% of current and 29% of past smokers have lifetime exposure of 40 pack-years or more. Cotinine\nis directly related to number of cigarettes per day but with considerable unexplained variation. Cotinine levels contradict\nself-report in fewer than 4% of nonsmokers.\nConclusion. NSHAP provides data useful for investigation of smoking and alcohol use and their association with\nhealth and social factors.\nKey Words: Smoking behavior--Tobacco--Alcoholuse--Cotinine--Older adult.\nfeatures of the design and data collection methods that\napply to measures of smoking behaviors and alcohol use.\nIn addition to self-report measures of these domains, re-\nspondents provided a saliva specimen, which was assayed\nfor cotinine, a biological measure of tobacco exposure.\nThe NSHAP sample was constructed to make compari-\n75\u00ad85 years) and was stratified accordingly.\nSelf-report measures were collected primarily through\ncomputer-assisted in-person interviews, supplemented by a\nleave-behind questionnaire. In order to obtain as much in-\nformation as possible within the time constraints of the in-\nhome interview, certain sections were modularized to apply\nto a subset of respondents or to be administered partly or\nwholly through the leave-behind questionnaire, or both.\nBiomeasures were modularized as well. Respondents were\nrandomized to paths that determined which modules they\nreceived and the mode of administration. All measures of\nsmoking behaviors and alcohol use, including the biomarker\nof tobacco exposure, were in the core set of measures, which\nNSHAP sought to obtain from all respondents. Moreover,\nall these measures were collected in the home, with one\nexception: A screening instrument for problem drinking be-\nhavior was administered to all respondents in the leave-\nbehind instrument.\nBiomeasure Processing\nNSHAP obtained cotinine levels through collection of\nsalivary specimens, a stable and noninvasive method that is\nwell accepted by respondents (Binnie et al., 2004). Saliva\nspecimen collection and processing are described by\nGavrilova and colleagues (this issue). Salivary enzyme im-\nmunoassay for cotinine concentration was conducted at\nSalimetrics, LLC. Details of the assay, as well as additional\ninformation about processing and properties of the measure,\nare described in Iqbal, Mendoza, Curran, and Lindau (2007).\nData Analysis\nSmoking behaviors and alcohol use are compared by gen-\nder and age group, overall and within each gender group.\nPrevalences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are given\nfor levels of categorical and ordinal variables, with associa-\ntions tested using the Pearson chi-square statistic, corrected\nfor survey design with the second-order correction of Rao\nand Scott (1987). CIs are based on a logit transform to ensure\nthat the confidence limits fall between zero and one. Means,\nstandard deviations, and quartiles are provided for continu-\nous variables, with associations evaluated through linear re-\ngression. For variables with skewed distributions, square root\nor logarithmic transformations were applied before analysis\nto achieve approximate normality. Linear, logistic, ordinal\nlogistic (McCullagh & Nelder, 1989), and generalized or-\ndered logit regression (Williams, 2006), which includes par-\ntial proportional odds models as a special case, were used to\nfurther evaluate associations and estimate adjusted effects.\nAll analyses accounted for the survey sampling design\nthrough incorporation of sampling strata and clusters as well\nas weights that adjusted for differential probability of selec-\ntion and differential nonresponse. Standard errors were com-\nputed using the Taylor linearization method (Binder, 1983).\nWeighted estimates are presented unless otherwise noted.\nResults are not adjusted for multiple testing. Analyses were\nAlcohol Consumption\nAmong many available instruments, NSHAP adopted two\nwell-established approaches to assessment of alcohol con-\nsumption behavior that were also used in the Health and\nRetirement Survey (HRS) 2002 (National Center for Health\nStatistics, 2002). The first utilizes the quantity-frequency\n(QF) approach (Room, 1990) and the second assesses poten-\ntial problem drinking behavior through a four-item screening\ninstrument, the CAGE (Cut back, Annoyed, Guilt, Eye-\nopener) assessment (Ewing, 1984). The QF approach incor-\nporates two domains: (a) quantity of alcohol intake within a\nreference period and (b) frequency of alcohol consumption\nwithin a reference period, as well as an additional question\non frequency of consuming four or more drinks on one occa-\nsion as an indicator of high-risk drinking behavior (Dawson,\n2003). The QF approach is recommended, albeit with limita-\ntions, when a quick and easy measure is needed due to time\nMeasures\nAll respondents were asked whether they ever drank alco-\nholic beverages such as beer, wine, or liquor. Respondents\nwho stated \"no\" or \"don't know\" or who refused to answer\nwere then asked if they had ever drunk alcohol. Those who\nresponded \"yes\" on this item were asked, \"Have you drunk\nalcohol in the last three months?\" Only respondents who\nindicated that they drank currently or within the past three\nmonths were then asked the three QF questions: \"In the last\nthree months (the reference period), on average, how many\ndays per week have you had any alcohol to drink?\" with\nresponse options 0 (none or less than one day a week), 1,\n2, ... , 7 (the frequency component). Next, respondents were\nasked to indicate how many drinks they had on those days\n(the quantity component). The quantity and the frequency\ncomponents allow measurement of the volume consumed\nby multiplying the number of drinks per day by the number\nof drinking days per week. Finally, respondents were asked\nto indicate on how many days in the same reference period\nthey had four or more drinks on one occasion.\nThe CAGE, a widely used clinical screening instrument\nthat has been used effectively with older adults (Beullens &\nscreen for problematic drinking. It is a brief, four-question\ninstrument, which Mayfield, Mcleod, and Hall (1974) found\neasy to administer and less intimidating than the full or\nshortened version of the Michigan Alcoholism Screening\nspondents were asked whether they had ever felt that they\nshould cut down on drinking, whether people had ever\nannoyed them by criticizing their drinking, whether they\nhad ever felt bad or guilty about drinking, and whether they\nhad ever had a drink first thing in the morning (eye opener)\nto steady their nerves or get rid of a hangover. A total of two\nor more positive responses have long been used to indicate\nalcohol abuse and dependence, with the cutpoint based\non a sensitivity analysis (Fiellin, Reid, & O'Connor, 2000;\nMayfield et al., 1974). The National Institute on Alcohol\nAbuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), in contrast, recommends\na screening cutpoint of one positive response for clinical use\n(Bradley,Kivlahan,Bush,McDonell,&Fihn,2001;NIAAA,\npoint more suitable for screening elderly hospital emergency\ndepartment patients. In our survey, the CAGE instrument\nwas self-administered in the leave-behind instrument.\nResults\nThe main descriptive findings for drinking behavior are\nsummarized in Table 1. The results are presented for men\nand women separately stratified by three age groups. The\nfirst distribution shown in Table 1 describes the drinking\nstatus variable that was constructed from the first three\nquestions on drinking behavior included in the interview. Its\nvalues are \"current drinker,\" \"former drinker,\" and \"never\ndrinker.\" Current alcohol consumption differs substantially,\ncomparing men with women across all age groups included\nin the NSHAP survey. For example, 55% of women versus\n72% of men in the youngest age group indicated current\nalcohol use. Additionally, women were significantly more\nlikely than men to report never consuming alcohol. Re-\nported alcohol use also declines across age groups among\nboth women and men.\nFigure 1 presents the distribution of volume of alcohol\nconsumed, calculated by multiplying the two components\n(quantity \u00d7 frequency), and also presents the frequency com-\nponent of this measure for men and women separately. As\nseen in the top panel of Figure 1, frequency of drinking was\nsignificantly higher among men than among women. Women\nwere more likely than men to drink one or fewer days per\n19%). Frequency of drinking also was significantly higher\namong older compared with younger men but did not differ\nby age among women (not shown). Quantity, in terms of the\nnumber of drinks consumed on days the respondent drank,\nwas also significantly higher among men and decreased\nacross age group for both men and women (not shown).\nA number of characteristics of the composite volume\nmeasure are illustrated in the parallel boxplots in the lower\npanel of Figure 1. Most notably, consumption was higher\namong men than among women at all frequencies of drink-\ning, and variability of consumption increased with fre-\nquency, particularly among men. By definition, minimum\nvolume consumed is the number of days per week the per-\nson drinks, which is realized when the number of drinks per\nday equals one. For women, this is also the median value\namong those who drink five or more days a week. For men,\nin contrast, the median is two drinks per day, except at the\nlowest frequency. Note that volume consumed is zero when\nthe respondent drinks on average less than one day a week,\nno matter how heavily. The overwhelming majority for\nwhom volume consumed was zero reported drinking three\nor fewer drinks on the occasional days when they drank, but\n15 (2.4%) respondents with this score reported an average\nof four or more drinks per occasion.\nThe last question included in the in-person interview\ndeals with risk behavior; the respondents were asked about\nconsumption of four or more alcoholic drinks on one occa-\nsion during the prior three months. The response to this\nquestion was an open-ended count, but due to its skewed\ndistribution, we generated an ordinal scale with four catego-\nries as shown in Table 1, with cutpoints chosen to corre-\nspond roughly to once a month and once a week. The\nmajority (77.2%) did not engage in heavy drinking behav-\nior, but men were significantly more likely than women at\nall ages to report doing so. This risk behavior decreased\nacross age groups, particularly for men.\nAs for the CAGE, a consistent and significant gender dif-\nference was observed across all four items, similar to what\nwas found among the in-person interview questions (Table\n1). For example, only 12% of women as compared with 36%\nof men aged 57\u00ad64 years had ever felt that they should cut\ndown on drinking. Among men and women, positive re-\nsponses to all CAGE items declined with age, although this\ntrend does not reach statistical significance among women\ndue to their low overall frequency of positive response. The\nfour self-administered CAGE items were summed and then\ndichotomized at two alternative cutpoints that are used to\nindicate potential alcohol abuse and dependence: two or\nmore positive answers (Fiellin et al., 2000) and one or more\npositive answers (Friedmann et al., 1999). These variables\nare also described in Table 1. Consistent with the other alco-\nhol consumption measures, we found a significant gender\ndifference for both. There is also evidence for a significant\ninverse relationship between age and potential alcohol abuse.\nWhen comparing CAGE responses with self-reported drink-\ning status, 4.3% of individuals who reported never drinking\nin the face-to-face interview responded positively to at least\none CAGE item, and 1.2% met the two or more positive re-\nsponse criterion for potential alcohol abuse.\nResponse rates were 98%\u00ad99% for drinking items asked in\nthe in-person interview. Response rates for the CAGE screen-\ning items, which were self-administered in the leave-behind\nquestionnaire for all respondents, ranged from 88% to 93%\non returned surveys and 76% to 80% overall.

However, a small\nbut non-negligible proportion of respondents (6.3%) an-\nswered some but not all the items, most often with some \"no\"\nresponses co-occurring with skipped items, which argues\nagainst regarding lack of response as a \"no.\"\nDiscussion: Alcohol Consumption\nThe most consistent finding concerning alcohol consum-\nption was the difference across gender. Women in all age\ngroups consumed less alcohol than men in terms of quan-\ntity, frequency, volume of alcohol use, and alcohol abuse.\nThe evidence found in NSHAP for a gender difference in\nalcohol intake is consistent with findings from recent re-\nsearch using data from The Health and Retirement Survey\n(United States) and the English Longitudinal Study of\nAging (Lang, Guralnik, Wallace, & Melzer, 2007).\nAttention should be paid to the volume consumed mea-\nsure that takes into account the average frequency and quan-\ntity of alcohol consumption. Although volume consumed is\na commonly used indicator, interpretation of its value can\nbe misleading. Very different patterns of drinking can yield\nFor example, data for a person who drinks one drink every\nday will generate the same volume of alcohol intake as data\nfor a person who drinks seven drinks only one day a week.\nTherefore, evaluation of a drinking pattern should be based\non the frequency and quantity components with supplemen-\ntal information from the risk behavior measure.\nCigarette Smoking and Other Tobacco Use\nSmoking assessment for adults typically includes informa-\ntion on smoking status (never, current, or ex-smoker), initia-\ntion, cessation, and intensity, which in turn yield measures of\nduration, cumulative exposure, and elapsed time since cessa-\ntion (Leffondr\u00e9, Abrahamowicz, Siemiatycki, & Rachet,\n2002)--all of which have been linked to disease risk.\nMeasures\nNSHAP assessed cigarette smoking status and history and\ncurrent use of other tobacco products (pipe, cigars, snuff, and\nchewing tobacco). Smoking status was ascertained through\ntwo survey items. Respondents were first asked, \"Do you\nsmoke cigarettes now?\" Those who answered \"yes\" were\nclassified as current smokers. All others were asked, \"Did\nyou ever smoke cigarettes regularly?\" and were classified as\npast or never smokers according to their response. Respon-\ndents who identified themselves as current cigarette smokers\nwere asked the age when they began smoking regularly and\nthe average number of cigarettes per day they usually smoke.\nSimilarly, past smokers were asked the age when they began,\nMale Female\nPercent\nHow many days per week do you drink?\nMale Female\nDrinks per Week\nVolume Consumed (weighted) by Days per Week Respondent Drinks\nVolume consumed = drinks per week = days per week respondent drinks x drinks per day.\nReference period: past 3 months.\nFigure 1.

The horizontal line in the box represents the median\nvalue, and the edges of the box are the first and third quartiles. The lines extending from the edges of the box end at the last value within 1.5 times the interquartile\nrange (third minus first quartile) from the edge of the box. Any values beyond this distance are considered outliers and are plotted individually. Note that in many\ncases, the median corresponds to the first or third quartile.\nthe age when they quit, and, on average, how many cigarettes\nper day they had usually smoked. Current use of other forms\nof tobacco was assessed by asking respondents, \"Do you use\nany of the other following tobacco products regularly now?\npipe, cigar, snuff, chewing tobacco, none,\" with instructions\nto choose all that apply. Note that for the variable assessing\nthe age of initiation of regular smoking, responses from\nsmokers and nonsmokers are in separate variables, which\nwere merged to apply to both groups before analysis or sub-\nsequent variable derivation. The same is true for the variable\nassessing the number of cigarettes per day.All items concern-\ning cigarette smoking are drawn from Established Popula-\ntions for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (Taylor,\nWallace, Ostfeld, & Blazer, 1998). The other tobacco items\nwere newly developed for NSHAP.\nCombining responses to the smoking history items yields\na number of variables useful for describing and evaluating\nsmoking behavior, including smoking duration in years,\nelapsed time since quitting for past smokers, and pack-\nyears. For current smokers, smoking duration is calculated\nas current age minus age when first smoked regularly, and,\nfor past smokers, as the difference between age last smoked\nand age first smoked. Pack-years is calculated as the num-\nber of years smoked times the average number of packs per\nday (20 cigarettes = 1 pack) (National Cancer Institute,\n2007). Pack-years is often categorized for analysis, with 20\nand 40 pack-years as commonly used risk thresholds (e.g.,\nCruickshanks et al., 1998; Straus, McAlister, Sackett, &\nDeeks, 2002; Sturmer, Glynn, Lee, Christen, & Hennekens,\n2000), whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion (CDC) designates 25 pack-years as \"heavy smoking\"\nin its report \"Cigarette Smoking Among Adults--United\nResults\nThe main descriptive findings for smoking are summa-\nrized in Table 2. A minority of respondents (15%) reported\ncurrent smoking, 44% claimed to be past smokers, and 41%\nresponded that they had never smoked regularly. Overall,\nsmoking status differed significantly by gender, age group,\nand age group within gender. Prevalence of current smoking\nwas similar for men and women and decreased with age for\nAmong men, there was a complementary increase in the pro-\nportion who reported past smoking, whereas the prevalence\nof never smoking was similar across age groups. In contrast,\nwomen in the oldest age group were significantly less likely\nto be past smokers and more likely to have never smoked\nthan their younger counterparts.\nFifty percent of current smokers and 29% of past smok-\ners met or exceeded the widely used high-risk threshold of\n40 pack-years. Men had higher cumulative exposure to cig-\narettes by this measure than did women. For current smok-\ners, this gender difference was a consequence of longer\nduration and higher intensity (cigarettes per day) among\nmen, whereas for past smokers, only intensity differed by\ngender. On average, men started smoking regularly at a\nyounger age than women (age 17 among men vs. ages 19\u00ad\n21 years among women, across age groups), but men who\nhad quit smoking also did so at a younger age than women\n(42.5 vs. 44.7 years) and had correspondingly longer elapsed\ntime since quitting.\nCurrent smokers had smoked an average of 47.6 years\nand past smokers an average of 25 years. Smoking duration\nincreased significantly with age for both men and women\namong past smokers and, as would be expected, among cur-\nrent smokers. Smoking intensity (cigarettes per day), in\ncontrast, varied by age only among current male smokers--\nexhibiting a decreasing trend with age. The net effect for\nthis subgroup was a significant association between age and\ncumulative exposure, with the youngest most likely to have\nreached 40 pack-years and the oldest most likely to be be-\nlow 20 pack-years. Past smokers reported significantly\nhigher smoking intensity than current smokers (on average,\n22 vs. 16.7 cigarettes per day), which may be due in part to\ndifferent reference periods and changes in smoking patterns\nover a lifetime. Nevertheless, current smokers had higher\ncumulative exposure whether pack-years was treated con-\ntinuously or categorized. Note that among current smokers,\nsmoking duration confounds with age due to the longer du-\nration of opportunity for older respondents to smoke. This\nconfounding does not occur with pack-years.\nCurrent use of other tobacco products was reported by\nthese products was more prevalent among men than among\ndid not differ significantly by age group and was only mod-\nerately associated with cigarette smoking, being more prev-\nalent among past smokers (never smokers 3.4%\ntwo or more of these tobacco products.

Although these rates are not directly\ncomparable, the fact that the NHIS interval includes all ages\n>85, and thus spans the NSHAP age interval, suggests con-\nsistency between NSHAP and NHIS estimates.\nBased on a review of approaches used in 40 articles pub-\nlished in epidemiological and clinical journals in 2000,\nLeffondr\u00e9 and associates (2002) used data from a case-\ncontrol study of lung cancer to investigate how modeling\nsmoking history impacts estimated effects of cigarette\nsmoking. Variations included criteria used to distinguish be-\ntween current and ex-smokers, whether never smokers were\nincluded when modeling continuous smoking exposure, re-\nplacing intensity and duration by a single measure (e.g.,\npack-years), and simultaneous modeling of several time-\nrelated smoking variables. They found that estimated effects\nmay depend substantially upon modeling strategies and\nmake specific recommendations for use of smoking history\nvariables in analysis. Although NSHAP differs in design\nand focus from the Leffondr\u00e9 study, these issues are still\npertinent and worthy of consideration in working with\nsmoking data from the NSHAP study.\nSalivary Cotinine\nSalivary cotinine provides an objective measure of tobacco\nexposure that can be used to detect and quantify second-hand\nexposure, validate self-reported nonsmoking status, and clas-\nsify smokers as occasional or regular. Cotinine is a primary\nmetabolite of nicotine that has a half-life of 16\u00ad18 hr and can\nbe detected in urine, saliva, or serum; it provides a reliable\nmeans of determining tobacco use or exposure over the prior\nA number of factors, including body mass index (BMI) and\nrecent food consumption, are known to affect nicotine me-\ntabolism and cotinine concentrations (Hukkanen, Jacob, &\nBenowitz, 2005) and may contribute to what is often wide\nvariation in cotinine at the same nominal exposure level--for\nexample, among smokers who report smoking one pack of\ncigarettes per day.\nMeasures\nIn the NSHAP core data set, salivary cotinine concentra-\ntions are reported in nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) for\neach of two duplicate assays performed on the individual\nsaliva samples. Iqbal and associates (2007) provide infor-\nmation on details of the assay. The core data set also in-\ncludes gender-specific derived variables, described in the\nfollowing, that classify respondents as nonsmokers, passive\nsmokers, occasional smokers, and regular smokers, based\non their mean cotinine concentrations. NSHAP recorded the\ntime of cotinine measurement and queried respondents about\nthe elapsed time since last food or drink consumption other\nthan water, which enables incorporation of these potential\nmodifying factors in analysis. In addition, a series of variables\nSignificant\nFactorsb Total\nWomen Men\nAmong past smokers\nRecent exposure: Salivary cotinine (ng/ml),d M (SE), first quartile, median, third quartile\nAmong current\nsmokere\nAmong respondents\nwho report no\ncurrent tobacco usef,g\nNone,\nsignificant\nNotes: CI = confidence intervals; SE = standard error; NSHAP = National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project.\na Estimates are weighted to account for differential probabilities of selection and differential nonresponse.

Smoking Behavior by Gender and Age Group in NSHAP Wave 1a (Continued)\nmark the status of the saliva sample and assay results (Iqbal\net al., 2007). In particular, flags for each of the duplicate as-\nsays identify (a) values below the lower limit of sensitivity\nof the assay (0.05 ng/ml), which have been recoded as 0; (b)\nvalues that are a \"lower bound\" on the true value; and (c)\nvalues missing due to insufficient sample quantity or a tech-\nnical problem with the sample. The lower bound flag indi-\ncates that the cotinine concentration remained above the\nupper assay limit of 200 ng/ml after final dilution to 1:20.\nValues flagged as lower bounds have all been set to the fixed\nvalue, 200 ng/ml, and thus are not approximations of the\ntrue cotinine concentration. To place this in context, note\nthat the maximum cotinine concentration in the NSHAP\nsample is over 2,400 ng/ml. Additionally, a variable that re-\nports the status of the saliva sample identifies 20 samples\nthat were not continuously frozen during transport. Calcula-\ntion of mean cotinine concentration from the duplicate as-\nsays is left to individual users, who may choose different\noptions for dealing with these special cases.\nImputed smoking status is derived from respondents'\nmean cotinine concentrations, based on the Wells\u00adStewart\nmethod described in a 1992 Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA) report on passive smoking (U.S. EPA, 1992,\np. 453). Under this method, cutoffs that divide smoking cat-\negories are calculated separately for men and women as\npercentages of the observed mean for self-reported smokers\nin the sample. Individuals with cotinine concentrations at or\nabove 30% of this mean value are classified as regular\nsmokers; those with concentrations between 10% and 30%\nof it are classified as occasional smokers. The EPA report\ndoes not address the boundary between passive exposure\nand nonexposed nonsmokers. Empirically determined lower\nbounds for passive smoking in the literature have ranged\nml generally recognized as sensitive and specific for delin-\neating nonsmokers from current smokers (Ogden, Morgan,\nHeavner, Davis, & Steichen, 1997). In NSHAP, the value\nthat best separates nonsmokers and passive smokers is\n15 ng/ml for both men and women, providing 91.4% sensi-\ntivity and 96.4% specificity for self-reported nonsmoking in\nCotinine values with the lower bound flag, aforementioned,\nwere excluded from these calculations.\nResults\nFigure 2 displays the distribution of salivary cotinine con-\ncentrations among women on the logarithmic scale. Vertical\nlines separate imputed smoking categories and mark the\nmean concentration for self-reported smokers. Notable fea-\ntures of the distribution include its clear delineation as a mix-\nture of three distinct components. The single bar on the far\nleft corresponds to cotinine concentrations below the level of\nsensitivity of the assay (19% of women). Moving to the right,\nthe majority of women (65%) are seen to have detectable\nconcentrations below the level of passive exposure, with values\nthatfollowaunimodal,mildlyright-skeweddistribution.These\ntwo components comprise nonsmokers with, at most, mini-\nmal passive exposure to tobacco. The third component cor-\nresponds to the continuum of exposure from passive through\noccasional and regular smoking (16% of women) and exhibits\nM\nNonsmoker Passive\nSmoker\nOccasional\nSmoker\nRegular\nSmoker\nFraction\nlog(cotinine)\nM = mean cotinine among females who report current smoking.\nBar on left corresponds to cotinine below level of detection.\nFigure 2.

The\ndistribution for men is similar to that of women.\nTable 2 presents the main descriptive results for cotinine,\nfirst in terms of imputed smoking status and then as a measure\nof the magnitude of recent exposure among self-reported cur-\nrent smokers. Cotinine concentrations indicate regular smok-\ning in 17.7% and occasional smoking in 1.8% of respondents,\nwhereas concentrations consistent with passive exposure\nwere observed in fewer than 1%. Age and gender trends were\nanalogous to those for self-reported smoking status, although\nthe age trend among women did not reach statistical signifi-\ncance (p = .11). Moreover, cotinine classification was consis-\ntentwithself-reportedsmokingstatusanduseofothertobacco\nproducts for the vast majority of respondents. Of particular\ninterest, cotinine concentrations were below levels indicative\n98.4%) of respondents who reported no current cigarette or\nother tobacco use. Breaking this down further, self-report of\nAmong current smokers, mean cotinine concentration was\nin both men and women. For comparison, the mean concen-\ntration among respondents reporting no tobacco use was 5.6\nng/ml, and the 75th percentile of the distribution was less than\n0.4 ng/ml across age groups for both men and women.\nFigure 3 illustrates several features of the relationship\nbetween cotinine and smoking behavior. Salivary cotinine\nincreased significantly with both current smoking intensity\n(cigarettes per day) and cumulative lifetime exposure\n(pack-years), although cotinine concentrations exhibited\nconsiderable variation at any given level of either variable\n(cigarettes per day: adjusted R2 =.18, pack-years: adjusted\nR2 =.16). In contrast, pack-years was a very strong predic-\ntor of current smoking intensity, explaining over 90% of the\nvariation in number of cigarettes per day (R2 =.93), thus\nRegular Smoker\nOccasional Smoker\nCotinine (ng/ml)\nCotinine versus Cigarettes per Day\nRegular Smoker\nOccasional Smoker\nCotinine (ng/ml)\nCotinine versus Pack-Years\nCigarettes per Day\nCigarettes per Day versus Pack-Years\nFitted lines from regression of square root transformed variables.\nFigure 3.

Values were missing for an additional 1.4% of respon-\ndents due to equipment problems during saliva collection (n =\n7), loss of specimens in transit (n = 25, 1.0%), inability to iden-\ntify the sample (n = 6), and a technical problem with the sam-\nple (n = 1). Cooperation rates during saliva collection did not\ndiffer significantly by gender, age group, or smoking status;\ncooperation is discussed in detail by Gavrilova and associates\n(this issue).Among respondents who were willing to provide a\nsample, women and those in the oldest age group were most\nlikely to be unable to do so. Likewise, a larger proportion of\nprocessed samples were insufficient for assay among women\ningness differed significantly by smoking status.\nIt should also be noted that among the values of cotinine\nobtained, 16.8% were below the limit of sensitivity of the\nassay for both duplicates and have been assigned the value\nof 0. These nondetectable concentrations were more com-\nmon in women and with increasing age. The gender differ-\nence remained after controlling for smoking status.\nConsistent with the nature of the measurement, nondetect-\nable concentrations occurred almost entirely among self-\nreported nonsmokers (never or past).\nDiscussion: Cotinine and Self-Reported Smoking Behavior\nSelf-reported nonsmoking was validated by cotinine levels\nfor the vast majority of past and never smokers, taking into\naccount use of other tobacco products. This high level of\nagreement speaks not only to the validity of self-reported\nsmoking status among NSHAP respondents but also to the\nsuccess of the EPA-recommended method for deriving cut-\npoints from cotinine concentrations to determine smoking, or\nexposure, categories. NSHAP provides these gender-specific\ncotinine-based classification variables in its core data set.\nMolander, Hansson, and Lunell (2001) found that older adults,\naged 65\u00ad76 years, had significantly decreased clearance of\ncotinine compared with adults aged 22\u00ad43 years, but the dif-\nference was not clinically important. When investigating coti-\nnine concentrations, factors such as body habitus and timing\nof the most recent meal should be considered as potential\nmodifiers. NSHAP reports BMI, which can be used for this\npurpose, as well as elapsed time since last food or beverage.\nIt is striking that cotinine concentrations, which measure\ntobacco exposure within the past two or three days, exhibit a\nsignificant positive association with pack-years, a measure of\ncumulative lifetime exposure--apparently due to a strong as-\nsociation between lifetime exposure and current smoking in-\ntensity. In contrast, less variation in cotinine is explained by\ncurrent smoking intensity than might be expected. Several as-\npects of smoking behavior, in addition to factors that affect\nnicotine metabolism and cotinine clearance, may account for\nthis unexplained variation. The manner in which a person\nsmokes, or smoking topography (e.g., number and frequency\nof puffs, portion of cigarette smoked, depth of inhalation), af-\nfects the amount of nicotine absorbed (Strasser, Pickworth,\nPatterson, & Lerman, 2004), so that persons who smoke the\nsame number of cigarettes per day may have very different\ncotinine levels. In addition, patterns of smoking (e.g., continu-\nously vs. at fixed periods during the day) could lead to differ-\nences in the elapsed time since the last cigarette was smoked at\nthe time of cotinine measurement (Campuzano et al., 2004).\nConclusions\nNSHAP successfully acquired a range of measures of\nsmoking behaviors and alcohol use. These variables will serve\nas important modifying or explanatory factors when examin-\ning key questions concerning social relationships, health, and\nsexuality. The measures are well established and have been\nused extensively in medical, social science, and other fields of\nresearch. The data are of high quality, with response rates that\ngenerally meet, or exceed, those of other comparable studies.\nPrevalences for selected measures were compared with those\nfrom other large national surveys and found to be similar.\nFunding\nThe NSHAP is supported by the National Institutes of Health--the Na-\ntional Institute on Aging, the Office of Women's Health Research, the Of-\nfice of AIDS Research, and the Office of Behavioral and Social Science\nCorrespondence\nAddress correspondence to Melinda L.
