    "abstract": "Abstract\nFaced with the perceived need to redefine education for more economic utilitarian purposes, as well as to encourage\ncompliance with government policies, Australia, like many other Anglophone nations, has engaged in numerous policy shifts\nresulting in performativity practices becoming commonplace in the educational landscape. A series of interviews with teachers\nfrom Queensland, Australia, in which they revealed their experiences of professionalism are examined archaeologically\nto reveal how they enact their roles in response to this performative agenda. Findings suggest that while there is some\nacceptance among teachers of the performative discourse, there is increasing resistance, which permits the construction of\nalternative or counter-discourses to the currently internationally pervasive performative climate.\n",

Some\nteachers have embraced the performance agenda, seeing it as\nan opportunity to advance successful careers and increase\nprofessional development opportunities (Goodrham &\nMcNamara, Stark, & Warne, 2002). Others see loss of\nmorale, identity, and autonomy, an overemphasis on account-\nability and a tightly surveilled, low trust working environ-\nment that stifles innovation and creativity (Avis, 2005;\nwriters such as Deem, Hilliard, and Reed (2008) posit that\nautonomy is an integral part of professionalism (Furlong,\nBarton, Miles, Whiting, & Whitty, 2000; Leaton Gray &\ning of performative practices into education, it is timely to\ninvestigate how teachers are performing their roles by\naccepting, reacting to, or challenging such a performative\ndiscourse. We argue that there is a need to dig deeper into\ndifferent landscapes to explore how teachers are responding\nto this redefinition of professionalism as performativity. We\nborrow from Foucault's (1972) archaeological toolbox to\nenable us to undertake this excavation.\nThis article first conceptualizes performativity in educa-\ntional contexts and then outlines how a performative dis-\ncourse and its associated practices have colonized the\nAustralian educational landscape with particular escalation\nsince the turn of the century. In this study, teachers' experi-\nences of these changes are captured through open-ended\ninterviewing techniques before their \"statements\" are sub-\njected to Foucauldian archaeological analysis to identify\ntheir reactions to the prevailing performative climate. These\nfindings are discussed in relation to the educational field,\nrevealing how teachers are playing what Foucault (1972) has\ndescribed as their \"truth game\" of professionalism and per-\nformativity. While some comply, many voices reveal teach-\ners who choose to \"jump past the hoops\" rather than \"through\nthe hoops\" in resisting the identified performativity agenda.\nPerformativity in Education\nResting on the fundamental economic assumptions that insti-\ntutional competition and consumer preferences are an effi-\ncient resource allocation system, the performance agenda has\nemerged as a counterpoint to older policy technologies of\nperformativity privileges measurable outcome goals.

Similarly, Avis (2005)\nclaims that other conceptualizations of good practice outside\nperformance criteria are silenced and denied legitimacy.\nA recent study by Vidovich and Currie (2011) found that\nAustralia is an extreme example of external regulation that\nprivileges corporate over academic modes, is characterized\nby coercion, and staff and students' voices are no longer\nheard as the trust gap widens and a performative agenda\ntakes hold. From this perspective, where once teachers were\npositioned as having specialized knowledges (Shulman,\n1987), a shared technical culture, and a strong service ethic\nLarson, 1977), many writers agree that teachers are increas-\ningly discursively repositioned as non-experts. With educa-\ntional decisions coming from outside the educational world,\nteachers all but work in standardized accountable environ-\nments as unquestioning supporters and implementers of a\ncompetency-based, outcome-oriented pedagogy related to\nthe world of work, in line with Australian government poli-\ncies (Sachs, 2003). For some, such conflict is highly person-\nalized, what Ball (2003) has referred to as struggles over\nteachers' souls. For such teachers, the ethics of competition\nand performance differ markedly from previous ethics of\nprofessional judgment and cooperation (Burnard & White,\n2008). To explore this contested space, we operationalize\nFoucauldian archaeology as our method of investigation.\nArchaeology is a comparative analysis designed to examine\nthe simultaneous exchanges between discourses influencing\nthe current policy and teacher context. We therefore begin\nwith a historical representation of the Australian educational\ncontext and then specifically refer to Queensland where the\ninterviews took place.\nThe Australian Historical Educational\nContext\nsubjected to various discourses of derision in government\ndocuments and the popular media, being blamed for wide-\nspread unemployment and used as scapegoats for the failure\nof governments' educational policies. Cultural conservatives\nand the then Liberal Government, followed by the subse-\nquent Labor Government, business leaders, and the New\nreiterated the myth of decline in standards and generated a\nsense of crisis in education that they intimated would lead to\nnational decline. This relentless onslaught resulted in\nemployer organizations being rewarded with a policy role in\neducation (Marginson, 1997). What employers wanted was a\ncompetency-based pedagogy directly related to the world of\nwork (Robertson, 1996). The result was that thinking skills,\nproblem-solving, coping with authority, and social skills\n(vocationalism) rose high on the priority list. Governments at\nthe time also thought it necessary that schools form school/\nbusiness partnerships (Robertson, 1996). Various interna-\ntional policy documents such as Investing in Our Children:\nBusiness and the Public Schools from the U.S. Committee\nfor Economic Development (CED) urged business to take\nthe challenge of improving schools by using the principles of\neffective organization and management (CED, 1985).\nTertiary institutions were also invited to forge business links\nthrough collaborative programs.\nThis phase in Australia became known as the \"Reorg\"\n(Ashenden, 1990). Education was presented with a new eco-\nnomic mission (Blackmore & Sachs, 2005), not just about\ndeveloping the skills and talents of theAustralian nation as in\nyears gone by but now about developing education and\nresearch as a way to increase the nation's global competitive-\nness. Essential to this objective was the restructuring of\nteachers' work and reconstitution of their professionalism\nwithin an economic and performative framework.\nThus, teachers were simultaneously blamed for all the ills\nin society and presented as the mechanism for national eco-\nnomic reconstruction. Organisation for Economic\nCo-Operation and Development (OECD) reports at the time\ncalled for globalization and a program of microeconomic\nreform, and this became the taken-for-granted international\nwisdom the Australian government took on board. Under the\nleadership of Dawkins, Minister of Employment, Education,\nstrategies to follow the OECD line. Education was further\nopened up to the business sector to ensure a productive\nworkforce, a competency-based curriculum was introduced\nto schools to meet industry requirements, and the Australian\nResearch Council (ARC) was formed to make Australia\nmore productive (Marginson, 1997). With business drawn\ninto education, more corporate forms of management were\nintroduced into educational establishments. Strategies such\nas the creation of market-based systems of accountability,\nthe formation of national systems (corporate federalism,\nLingard, 1991), devolution, and industrial mechanisms led to\nnew forms of educational management that inevitably weak-\nened the position of teachers. Education became redefined as\nan industry with inputs and outputs, operating as a national/\nglobal market in which choice and competition would\nenhance the quality of teaching, as parents (the education\nconsumers) shopped around.\nThis marketization of education (Sachs, 2003) saw\nschools marketing themselves with mission statements and\nstrategic plans expressed in \"business-speak.\" These market\nBourke et al. 3\nstrategies became the commonsense discourses of schooling.\nRather than being seen as problematic, they became the con-\ntemporary taken-for-granted way of thinking at that time,\nand schools that did not take on this approach were said to be\n\"out of touch.\" According to Sachs (2003, p. 18), the impera-\ntives of this market regime were for schools to produce stu-\ndents who were \"numerate, literate and able to take civic and\nsocial responsibility\" as multi-skilled, flexible workers who\nwould boost the economy and increase international\ncompetitiveness.\nIn pursuit of this goal, schools were transformed into car-\nriers of economic policy; corporations with line managers\nworking effectively and efficiently under direct ministerial\ncontrol. Teachers were repositioned as education workers\nsubject to this management. However, in what Sachs (2003)\nreferred to as a paradoxical strategy, devolved school man-\nagement (Blackmore, 2004) was introduced to give the illu-\nsion of a quest for quality that was controlled locally, but the\ndevelopment of policies and strategic control of teaching,\ncurriculum, and assessment remained firmly in the hands of\ncentrally located bureaucrats. This distancing by govern-\nments, or \"steering at a distance,\" was a successful strategy\nfor avoiding controversy while positioning teachers as the\nweak link in the educational supply chain.\nAs \"education workers,\" teachers became subject to\n\"industry\" award restructuring strategies whereby, to win\npay increases, employers and unions had to \"cooperate to\nreview their rewards in order to improve industry efficiency,\nproductivity and workers' career opportunities\" (Reid, 1993,\np. 131). Offsetting work reorganization and productivity for\nwage increases meant that industrial and educational issues\ncould no longer be separated and the government had a fur-\nther potent mechanism for reforming teachers' work.\nThese strategies redefined teachers as technicians whose\nrole it was to efficiently implement decisions made by their\nmanagers (Blackmore & Sachs, 2005). Their job was to\nimprove student performance, compete with neighboring\nschools for resources, and raise money from the business\nsector (Robertson, 1996). However, they were not to be\ninvolved in intellectual, philosophical, or epistemological\ndecisions (Reid, 1993). Governments were strategic, making\nsure that any consultation processes with teachers were\ntightly managed. The intellectual autonomy characterized in\ntraditional discourses of professionalism had well and truly\nbeen stripped from teachers.\n\"Discourses of derision\" continued into the 1990s, but\nthis time not only were teachers being attacked but also a\ndiscussion paper by the Department of Employment,\nEducation and Training in 1992 openly asserted that teacher\neducators in Australia had lost touch with classrooms as well\nas being too old and set in their ways (Department of\nEmployment, Education and Training [DEET], 1992).\nGovernments maintained that what was needed in pre-ser-\nvice teacher courses was a focus on classroom skills (Reid,\n1993) instead of philosophy, history, and sociology. This was\nfurther strengthened by the push for the development of\nnational competency standards.\nSince the turn of the century, performativity activities in\nAustralian education include, but are not limited to, the use\nof professional standards to enhance teacher quality and pro-\nfessionalism with the implementation of the National\nProfessional Standards for Teachers1 developed by the\nAustralian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership\n(AITSL); curriculum reform with the introduction of an\nAustralian National Curriculum; and the continuation of\nhigh-stakes testing programs such as the NationalAssessment\nProgram\u00adLiteracy and Numeracy (NAPLAN2). The latter\ntwo are both under the auspices of the Australian Curriculum\nReporting and Assessment Authority (ACARA).\nEven though the performative agenda has colonized the\nAustralian educational landscape extensively, in what Lingard\n(2010) has referred to as \"new national accountabilities\"\nwhere this study took place, has \"a tradition of respecting\nAfter the abolition of public examinations following the\ntinued a 40-year history of school-based curriculum and\nexternally moderated standards-based assessment in the\nsenior phase of schooling (Years 11 and 12) with a Core\nSkills Test having the effect of stretching teaching (Lingard,\n2010). Such practices were extended with the New Basics\ndards referenced moderation in Years 1 to 9 (known as the\nQueensland Curriculum,Assessment and Reporting [QCAR]\nFramework). Queensland conceptualized the framework\nfrom the view that assessment was an integral part of teach-\ning and learning. The tests were not about measuring school\nor teacher effectiveness; rather, the intention was to build\nteachers' assessment capacity and assessment literacy.\nTeachers, valued as a community of learners met to discuss,\ncritique, and analyze student responses (Klenowski, 2011;\nHowever, more recently, this trust seems to be disappear-\ning with pre-service teacher testing in literacy, numeracy,\nand science an important agenda item in response to the\nAustralian (National) Curriculum. In addition, Education\nQueensland has developed an initiative called Curriculum\ninto the Classroom (c2c), which outlines lesson-by-lesson\nand unit-by-unit exactly what teachers should be teaching.\nAlthough not yet mandatory for all state schools, it may\nappear inevitable that some principals and teachers will\nanticipate further encroachment of performativity practices\nand thereby exacerbate an ever more regulated educational\nenvironment.\nWhile teachers have always been rendered \"weak\" since\nthe advent of compulsory mass schooling (Jones, 1990), the\n21st century covert technologies include the increased modes\nof surveillance epitomized by Bentham's Panopticon\n(Foucault, 1995). Today's teachers, like Bentham's\n4 SAGE Open\nprisoners, perform as if surveillance is omnipresent.\nSubjection to the assumed gaze results in teachers'self-mon-\nitoring so that self-regulation occurs \"naturally.\" Whether\nthis is through parental or community demands, registration\nsystems, the online audit of professional learning or the pub-\nlication of high-stakes testing data, the monitoring system or\nthe \"eyes that must see without being seen\" (Foucault, 1995,\np. 171) produce information so that teachers are knowable\nand may hence be regulated. This \"visibility is a trap\"\ninvested with power relations that render them docile but\n\"productive.\" A hold is placed on their conduct as they are\ncoerced by means of observation. Teachers, in their quest to\nachieve enhanced professional status through conforming to\ncurrent performance criteria, become regulated and con-\ntrolled by disciplinary technologies of the self (Blackmore,\ntimely to investigate how teachers are \"performing\" their\nroles in this performative climate.\nMethodology\nAs teachers and teacher educators, the authors have become\nincreasingly aware that many teachers struggle with per-\nceived inconsistencies between the stated requirements of\ntheir employers and public discourse as a whole and their\npersonal beliefs about what it means to \"be a teacher.\" To\nconceptualize this awareness in a scholarly way, we looked\nto the work of Michel Foucault who was interested in the\nrelationships between power and knowledge as a form of\nsocial control, particularly in social institutions. Thus, in\nresponse to the core question of this article--How do teach-\ners enact their roles in a constantly changing performative\nclimate?--a qualitative methodology using open-ended\ninterviews was chosen for data collection.\nIn previous work, the present authors have applied\nFoucault's archaeological method to cross-analyze the aca-\ndemic literature on professionalism, policy documents, and\nthe statements made by currently practicing teachers. For the\npurpose of this article, the focus is on the latter: the continu-\nities and discontinuities in the statements of teachers, voices\nthe principles of Foucault (1972), teachers' statements were\nanalyzed to develop a uniquely detailed archaeology.\nFoucault delighted in others borrowing his tools and many\nhis theories of discourse for policy analysis. Relatively few\nhave applied the tools to the empirical evidence of teacher\nstatements in the way we have.\nTwenty Queensland teachers were invited to engage in\nindividual face-to-face recorded interviews of around 1-hr\nduration with one of the current writers. Interviewees were\nidentified by a process of snow-balling from professional\nlearning networks to achieve maximum variation. The final\npanel of respondents tabulated in the appendix reveals details\nabout gender, qualifications, school sector, position in the\nhierarchy, and years of experience. Following the ethical\nclearance guidelines from the university where the writers\nare employed, informed consent was obtained from the inter-\nviewees, and they were assigned a pseudonym for confiden-\ntiality purposes. After initial closed questions to ascertain\nparticipant demographics (see the appendix), the open-ended\napproach to interviewing was outlined, assuring the partici-\npants that there were no right or wrong answers and encour-\naging them to elaborate on their practices and experiences as\npart of a rich dialogue. This unstructured technique provided\ninsight into the interviewees' socially constructed worlds\n(Freebody, 2003) and reduced the risk of the researcher lead-\ning the interview. Furthermore, interviewees were specifi-\ncally asked to identify particular experiences as foci for the\ndiscussion that followed. Given the frequent use of the word\n\"professional\" in official and teacher discourses, the focal\nquestion of the interview was \"Please tell me about a time\nwhen you felt you were being professional or behaving in a\nparticularly professional manner.\" The conversation contin-\nued with probing from the interviewer using the stem-plus-\nquery design (Cavana, Delahaye, & Sekaran, 2001), for\nexample, \"I am interested in your concerns about unprofes-\nsional behavior. Would you tell me about some of these con-\ncerns?\" Or, \"you mentioned quite a few things . . . you\nmentioned OP results . . . achievements . . . different abilities\nin your classroom . . . so can you elaborate on your role as a\nprofessional teacher . . . looking at those things.\" Therefore,\neach interview took a different path as participants'responses\nwere explored.\nIn Foucauldian terms (1972), such teacher responses\n(statements) are the \"atoms\" or \"elementary units of a dis-\ncourse\" so when statements from the teachers in this study\nmake core repeatable claims, they emerge as the teachers'\nregimes of truth on professionalism. Foucault's insistence\nthat statements must have a material existence meant that\neach statement was recorded, placed, and dated against the\nperson who said it and their status (hierarchical level, years\nof experience); in other words, who produced the statement\nand with what authority (Ball, 1993). What follows is an\nelaboration of our application of the archaeological method\nto the interview data.\nThe first step in excavating the empirical data is looking\nfor homogeneity or continuity in the teachers' statements.\nThe repeatability is noted, counting the frequency of terms\nand words with particular attention given to their arrange-\nment and co-location with other words and terms. A coding\nmechanism is established that consists of numbering the\nrepeatable terms or words or overlapping themes (frequency\nor analysis of terminology) running through the transcripts.\nStatements from teachers are also analyzed to see whether\nthey present themselves as \"passive\" or \"active\" agents in\nteacher work. This reveals their subject position.\nBourke et al. 5\nThe second step involves the identification of \"distances\"\nbetween statements or, as Foucault (1972) prefers, the analy-\nsis of contradictions. These discontinuities are equally as\nimportant as the continuities and must be noted.\nAs noted above, archaeology yields a comparative analy-\nsis and accordingly we chose to present our comparisons in\nthe light of a discussion of the Australian and the Queensland\nhistorical educational context and the non-discursive domain\n(see above). Finally, in what Foucault refers to as the analy-\nsis of transformations, we reveal the interactions between\ndifferent elements of the system; for example, how different\ninterpretations of professionalism may vary in their implica-\ntions for how teachers perform their roles.\nGenerative collaboration between the researchers work-\ning independently noted and numbered identified themes\nbefore cross-referencing to look for comparability. This\nwhole process was conducted with a high degree of openness\nto new interpretations; it was a strongly iterative and com-\nparative process of sorting and resorting data (Akerlind,\nThe themes were continually reworked and refined until\nthe final set was determined. These themes represented the\n\"discourses\" of professionalism as revealed by Queensland\nteachers. For the purpose of this article, the discourses were\nfurther scrutinized to examine how teachers enact their roles\nin a performative climate.\nFindings\nThe analysis of teachers' statements revealed that teachers\nenact their roles in six main ways:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Unresisting acceptance: Regarding performance-\nrelated policies and practices as the uncontentious\ndefinition of \"professionalism\" in teaching,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Passive resistance: Choosing to ignore policy docu-\nments and other forms of external \"pressure,\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Subtle resistance: Enacting alternative truths,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Overt resistance: Publically questioning the efficacy\nof change agendas,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Assertive resistance: Declaring professional confi-\ndence and competence in the self as a reflective prac-\ntitioner, and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Aspirational resistance: Promoting leadership rather\nthan performativity.\nEach of these is addressed in detail below.\nUnresisting Acceptance\nFour of the participants in particular display unresisting\nacceptance of policies and practices tied to performativity. In\nthe following example, Kory focuses on the professional\nstandards for Queensland teachers (Queensland College of\nThetenQCTStandardsweredevelopedbytheStateGovernment,\nso they [teachers] can look at how well they are delivering\ncontent . . . how you are continually progressing to become a\nbetter educator . . . by taking a step back and looking at how you\nmeet each of the standards, you are able to tell, well I am not\ndoing this one really well, I can do this better.\nSally describes her use of the same document:\n. . . the last standard is for reflective practice, especially when\ndeveloping major assessment units--it is really important . . . to\ncritically and effectively reflect on the work that you have done\nto ensure that both the students and yourself are reflecting and\ngaining from the learning experiences . . .\nKory and Sally are first-year teachers who use this policy\ndocument \"to reflect,\" \"tak[e] a step back,\" and \"critically\nand effectively reflect.\" The repetition of statements such as\n\"continually progressing,\" \"becom[ing] a better educator,\"\nand \"gaining from the learning experiences\" allude to how\nthese new teachers accept the policy documents unquestion-\ningly as a means of reflection for improving their perfor-\nmance. They both concede that their knowledge of this\ndocument was obtained while at university, simultaneously\nillustrating the role of higher education institutions (HEIs) in\nreinforcing the standards and performance discourse, and the\ninfluence of the link between HEIs' funding and accredita-\ntion of courses to standards implementation. Mary also\naccepts the recently promulgated standards (Australian\nInstitute for Teaching and School Leadership [AITSL], 2011)\nand reveals how she interprets her role within her school as\nshe supervises pre-service teachers. She says,\nI meet with the beginning teacher, and go through the teacher\nstandards, and they need to show me . . . how they are reaching\nthose professional standards, or not reaching them--which ones\nthey think they are doing very well in, and not doing well in, and\nwhat is it that I can do to help them develop in those areas.\nRather than encouraging the use of the standards for self-\nreflection, Mary, a deputy principal with more than 20 years'\nexperience, uses this policy document to observe where new\nteachers are \"doing well\" or where they need to \"develop.\"\nWhile the overlapping theme or continuity is about improv-\ning performance, terms such as \"they need to show me . . . \"\nillustrate a subject position of power where Mary is active in\nboth promoting the reform agenda and establishing her own\nsuperior position. This is in contrast (a discontinuity) with\nKory and Sally who passively accept the standards document\nas a compliance discourse normalized and legitimized at uni-\nversity (\" . . . it is really important . . . \" [Sally]; \" . . . you are\nable to tell\" [Kory]).\nUnresisting acceptance may also be exemplified in cases\nwhere teachers have embraced the use of another policy\ntechnology, that of high-stakes tests, not just for measuring\n6 SAGE Open\nstudent performance--\"20% were under national bench-\nmark\" (Xanthe) and \"we had two trial tests, one in February\n. . . and that gave us the feedback we needed to see what they\n[the students] didn't know\" (Judy)--but also for determining\nteacher performance, the latter notion shown in a statement\nby Jan: \"There needs to be some discussion about each\nteacher and their performance.\" Jan has the responsibility for\nNAPLAN testing in her school, and Xanthe and Judy are also\nsenior managers where part of their job is to risk manage\nagainst poor public performance. Thus, it appears that all\nthese teachers (unresistingly) accept the performativity\nagenda as they are required to impose such policies within\ntheir hierarchical responsibilities. However, the majority of\nresponses from other teachers in this study reveal varying\ndegrees of resistance both to policies and practices.\nPassive Resistance\nPassive resistance is evident in the teachers' declared lack of\nknowledge about performance related policy documents. An\nexample of this can be found in the participants'responses to\nknowledge about the Professional Standards for Queensland\nTeachers (QCT, 2006) document, introduced by the QCT\nwith the ostensible purpose of improving teacher quality and\nenhancing professionalism in Queensland. As one respon-\ndent clearly articulates--\"never heard of them\" (Mike).\nOther participants show some knowledge of the standards\nrevealed in statements such as \"I am aware there are docu-\nments. I did read some of it at some stage but I wouldn't be\nable to articulate what the detail is\" (Barbara), or \"I flicked\nthrough them . . . but would not know explicitly what those\nstandards were\" (Tia). Such definitive common statements--\n\"I am aware\" and \"I did read\"--reveal some degree of\n\"awareness\" toward the Queensland standards. However,\nterms such as [I] \"wouldn't be able to articulate\" and [I]\n\"would not know explicitly\" indicate that both Tia and\nBarbara have chosen either not to engage with or to disregard\nthe current order for professionalism in Queensland. Both of\nthese teachers are middle managers with between 11 and\n19 years of experience in schools. However, their flippant\nresponses reveal that they perceive the standards to be, at the\nbest, irrelevant to their professional lives. This is in direct\ncontrast (discontinuity) to the first-year teachers, Kory and\nSally, and the other experienced teachers, Mary, Jan, Xanthe,\nand Judy, as outlined in the previous section. It is noteworthy\nthat these experienced teachers (Tia and Barbara) represent\nthe independent and state systems, but this appears to make\nno difference to their perception of the standards documents\nas having little influence on how they perform their roles.\nPerhaps these teachers do not wish to gain any further\npromotions.\nPassive resistance from teachers is also noticeable when\ndealing with demands from parents. Janice declares that \"it's\na very matter of fact type relationship.\" These sentiments are\nrepeated in other statements such as keeping parents \"at\narm's length\" and \"let the teachers move on with the educa-\ntion\" (Judy). In such cases, and despite the public rhetoric of\ncollaboration with parents, the teachers define and position\nthemselves as professional experts who deserve to have their\nexpertise recognized. Exasperation is also evident in the\nteachers' voices--\"just let me teach\" (Holly) and \"just tell\nme what to do and I will do it well\" (Jan). As a senior man-\nager, this comment from Jan is noteworthy reiterating her\nunresisting acceptance as outlined in the previous section.\nSubtle Resistance\nThe second subtly nuanced form of resistance is where teach-\ners seek to create alternative truth games. In playing the truth\ngame in a different way, teachers make other options visible\nby destabilizing performative discourses. Two examples of\nthis are evident in the interview data. The first subtle form of\nresistance is concerned with teaching as a human endeavor\n(Day & Smethem, 2009), involving emotionality on different\nlevels. Referring to teacher/student professional relation-\nships, interviewees speak of love and care for their students\nas well as passion for teaching their disciplines. Common\nstatements that illustrate the latter notion are \"each teacher\nhas to show their passion\" (Barney), \"they have got to love\nwhat they are doing\" (Janice), and \"you have to have a pas-\nsion for teaching\" (Mike). Passion is not just expressed in\ngeneral teaching terms but also about having a passion\ntoward students, as shown when Barney speaks of a \"love of\nstudents . . . you genuinely care about young people\"; \"you\ntreat them as individuals\" (Kate); and \"build their confi-\ndence\" (Xanthe). The lexical linking across these statements\nis one of care. These teachers' sense of professionalism is\ninternally ascribed; an intrinsic motivation to do their best in\nthe interests of the students in their care, and this is the model\nthat they see as the most appropriate for guiding their profes-\nsional practice. What is noteworthy is that four out of the five\nteachers quoted above have higher degree qualifications and\nhave been teaching for longer than 20 years. This is in con-\ntrast (discontinuity) to Jan, with an undergraduate qualifica-\ntion and less than 10 years' experience, who still maintains\nthat each teacher needs to \"[have] some discussion about . . .\ntheir performance.\"\nFurthermore, teachers declare and practice altruism, self-\nsacrifice, and conscientiousness as shown by statements such\nas \"putting the job first\" (Cecilia) and \"ensuring that they\n[students] have the best possible and best educational experi-\nence that you can provide\" (James). Once again, both these\nteachers have more than 20 years of experience. However,\nthe emotional dimension of teaching as alluded to in these\nteachers'overlapping statements is not included in performa-\ntive policy documents, as it is neither quantifiable nor audit-\nable. Whereas governments promote managerial practices\nand a construction of professionalism that values rationality\nwhere the emphasis is on being competitive (Bourke,\nBourke et al. 7\nwere under national benchmark\"--these teachers maintain a\nsubject position where a moral dimension of professionalism\nis prioritized over the performance agenda.\nThe second subtle form of playing the truth game differ-\nently to destabilize the dominant performative discourse\nincludes participants' references to specialized knowledge.\nAccording to participants, teachers need to be \"thorough in\ntheir understanding of their subject area\" (Barney), \"up-to-\ndate with developments in their subject area\" (Xanthe), and\nhave \"a great deal of expertise and knowledge in their area of\nteaching\" (Holly). Furthermore, Mike describes the need to\nbe \"competent\" and \"confident\" in a discipline area. Policy\ndocuments such as the National Professional Standards for\nTeachers (AITSL, 2011) or its predecessor, the Professional\nStandards for Queensland Teachers (QCT, 2006), both refer\nto \"content\" knowledge, with a clear intimation that knowing\ncentrally defined \"content\" and how to teach it has priority\nover any specific teacher specialist expertise. Thus, both of\nthese documents construct the parameters of teachers' work-\ning knowledge as \"content\"; content that is prescribed in a\nNational Curriculum or the c2c agenda in Queensland.\nFurthermore, through accreditation procedures, this con-\nstruction shapes teacher education to produce new kinds of\nteachers imbued with new approved forms of knowledge.\nThe responses from Kory and Sally and their training in a\ndiscourse of professional standards are testimony to this.\nHowever, the statement from Holly (a first-year teacher but\nalso the daughter of a long experienced teacher and teacher\neducator) reveals a discontinuity as she does not share the\nsentiments of the other newly qualified teachers.\nOvert Resistance\nThe next area, a more overt form of resistance, questions the\nefficacy of change agendas, particularly in relation to the\nareas of curriculum change and high-stakes testing regimes,\ntechnologies associated with performance. Many statements\nreveal the overwhelming feelings of frustration toward guid-\ning authorities because of the number and frequency of\nchanges being imposed.
