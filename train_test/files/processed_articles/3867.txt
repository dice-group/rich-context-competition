It has been\npreviously posited that preferences for facial masculinity in general might be explained by\nimpressions of health, dominance, or warmth (Johnston, Hagel, Franklin, Fink, and Grammer,\nthose who have documented a greater preference for facial masculinity as a STP than as a LTP\nhave suggested that women are actually varying in their preference for these traits across mating\nrepresentative sample of natural faces to examine whether these impressions can explain why\nwomen prefer men high in facial masculinity more as a STP than a LTP.\nWhen selecting a mate, women are thought to face a trade-off between finding a mate\nwith good genes and finding a mate willing to invest in offspring. Because of this, women\nshould be more concerned with genetic quality in a STP and paternal investment in a LTP\nWhy Masculine Faces Are Preferred in a Short-Term Mate\n(Gangestad and Simpson, 2000). Women might prefer men high in facial masculinity more as a\nSTP than a LTP because they are inferring genetic quality and potential paternal investment from\nimpressions of health, dominance, and warmth. When considering the heritable aspects of health\n(e.g. a strong immune system) apparent health might be thought of as a signal of genetic quality.\nHowever, it should be noted that health is also important for providing paternal investment, and\nthere are no obvious drawbacks to finding a healthy long-term mate. Even so, since facial\nmasculinity is thought to signal a strong immune system (Folstad and Karter, 1992; Rhodes,\nChan, Zebrowitz, and Simmons, 2003), women's increased preference for facial masculinity as a\nSTP might be explained by impressions of health. Facial dominance also appears to serve as an\nhonest signal of genetic quality, since it is associated with status and reproductive success\nwomen's increased preference for facial masculinity in a STP might be explained by impressions\nof dominance, particularly since men high in social dominance are more likely to engage in\nextra-pair copulations (Egan and Angus, 2004), making them less desirable as a LTP. Finally,\nwomen's lesser preference for facial masculinity in a LTP may be explained by impressions of\nlower warmth, since men who look warm should be perceived as more likely to provide paternal\ninvestment, while there is no evidence that they are especially high in genetic quality In sum,\nwomen may prefer men high in facial masculinity more as a STP than a LTP because they look\nhealthier, more dominant, or less warm...................................................................\nFor any of these attributes (i.e. health, dominance, or paternal warmth) to explain why\nwomen prefer masculine-looking men more as a STP than a LTP, a number of criteria must be\nmet. For one, we need to find a parallel effect of mating context for that attribute. This effect\nneeds to remain significant when controlling for facial masculinity. Furthermore, the effect of\nmating context on facial masculinity needs to be reduced when controlling for the attribute.\nAdditionally, facial masculinity needs to be correlated with impressions of the attribute (Baron\nand Kenny, 1986). If these criteria are met for any of the attributes, we can say that in fact,\nwomen prefer men high in facial masculinity more as a STP because they look healthier, more\ndominant, or less warm.\nMaterials and Methods\nTarget faces\nThe target faces were digitized images of black and white photographs of 122 men drawn\nfrom a longitudinal study, The Intergenerational Studies, archived at the University of California,\nBerkeley Institute of Human Development (IHD), and at the Harvard University, Henry A.\nMurray Center. The men in the photographs were White, between 17 and 18 years old, and most\ndisplayed neutral facial expressions. The photographs were taken of the nude men in a\nstandardized format for the purpose of assessing pubertal development and somatotype. We\nused only cropped photos of their face, and additionally added oval masks to hide hairstyle. The\nmen came from a representative sample of 5th and 6th grade elementary school students in\nOakland California at the time they entered the study in 1932, or from a representative sample of\nbirths in Berkeley California in 1928-29 (For further study details see Eichorn, Clausen, Haan,\nHonzik, and Mussen, 1981). Ratings previously made using these images have been found to\nhave predictive validity. For example, ratings of facial masculinity and apparent health are\nWhy Masculine Faces Are Preferred in a Short-Term Mate\ncorrelated with the men's actual health (Kalick, Zebrowitz, Langlois, and Johnson, 1998;\nRhodes, 2006), and ratings of general attractiveness are correlated with likelihood of marriage\nand age at marriage (Kalick et al., 1998) as well as IQ scores (Zebrowitz, Hall, Murphy, and\nFace ratings\nSTP and LTP attractiveness.\nThe attractiveness ratings were collected in sessions conducted by a female research\nassistant. Photographs were presented using a PowerPoint presentation projected on a large\nscreen. This allowed for multiple participants to take part in the experiment simultaneously. We\ncounterbalanced between groups the order in which the pictures were presented, and between\nparticipants the order of STP and LTP ratings.\nSixty female participants rated the attractiveness of 122 pictures in two different contexts,\nas a short-term (sexual) partner (STP) and as a long-term (someone they would consider\nmarrying) partner (LTP). Participants were either paid $10, or they received credit toward the\nresearch familiarization requirement of the introductory psychology class. Three of the women\nwere excluded from the analyses because they indicated their sexual orientation was not\nheterosexual. Thus, the analyses were carried out on 57 heterosexual women between 18 and 26\nyears of age (M = 19, SD = 2.0). Ratings were made on 7-point Likert-type scales with endpoints\nlabeled unattractive and attractive. There was high inter-rater reliability for both the STP\n(=.95) and the LTP (=.94) attractiveness ratings. We computed the mean STP (M = 2.53, SD =\n.70) and LTP (M = 2.61, SD = .66) attractiveness ratings for each face across participants for\nsome analyses.\nMasculinity and health.\nRatings of facial masculinity and apparent health were drawn from previous studies.\nEach measure was based on a 7-point Likert-type scale, and the mean rating for each face across\nraters was used. The measure of facial masculinity (not at all masculine/very masculine;  = .92)\nhealth (not at all healthy/very healthy;  = .83) was drawn from Kalick, Zebrowitz, Langois, and\nPerceived dominance and warmth\nThe measures of perceived dominance and perceived warmth were previously created by\nZebrowitz and colleagues, but have not yet been described in published research. In both cases\n16 raters (approximately equal numbers of males and females) rated the faces on a 7 point scale.\nFor perceived dominance, the endpoints were submissive-dependent and dominant-independent.\nFor perceived warmth the endpoints were warm-affectionate and cold-unaffectionate. As in\nother measures, the mean across raters was used for perceived dominance ( = .80; M = 2.41, SD\nWhy Masculine Faces Are Preferred in a Short-Term Mate\nGood father\nFor a subset of the faces (n = 80), we had available ratings of how good a father the men\nappeared to be. These ratings were obtained using the same procedure as outlined for the STP\nand LTP attractiveness ratings. Thirteen female participants (M age = 20, SD = 1.5) were asked\nto rate \"what kind of father do you think this man would make?\" on a 7-point Likert-type scale\nwith endpoints poor father and good father. Inter-rater reliability was acceptable ( = .71), and\nthe mean across raters was used, M = 4.04, SD = .58. Perhaps due to lower power, there were no\nsignificant effects with the good father ratings. Because of this, they are not included in the\nanalyses. However, the good father ratings were substantially correlated with the warmth\nratings, r = .57, p< .001, which suggests that warmth ratings can be used as a proxy for perceived\npotential paternal investment.\nSmile ratings.\nThe men in the photographs were not given instructions concerning facial expression at\nthe time the photographs were taken, and most had a neutral expression. Even so, we obtained\nsmile ratings because positive expression has been found to influence judgments of attractiveness\nmay be related to testosterone levels (Dabbs, 1997). At a lab meeting, 10 undergraduate research\nassistants and 4 graduate students rated the 122 faces. The smile ratings were made on a 7-point\nLikert scale with endpoints \"not smiling at all\" and \"very big smile.\" Inter-rater reliability was\nhigh,  = .98 (M = 2.5, SD = 1.62), and the mean across raters was computed for each face.\nResults\nEffects of mating-context\nThe first question was to determine whether preferences for each of the investigated\nfacial qualities were similarly affected by mating context. To assess this, we used hierarchical\nlinear regression models (HLM) that were computed using HLM 6.0 software (SSI Scientific\nSoftware). HLM works by calculating a regression slope for each woman using all of the faces,\nand then tests the null hypothesis that the average regression slope across women is zero. In\ndoing so, HLM uses both the faces and the women raters as the unit of analysis. All variables\nwere standardized prior to data analysis so that the HLM regression coefficients () could be\ninterpreted as the mean standardized beta coefficients across women. In order to directly\nexamine the effects of mating context on attractiveness, we used the difference between the STP\nand LTP ratings as the outcome measure (as in Roney et al., 2006). A positive relationship would\nindicate that men high in the tested facial attribute (facial masculinity, health, dominance, or\nwarmth) tended to be rated as more attractive as a STP than a LTP. Conversely, a negative\nrelationship would suggest that the men high in that attribute tended to be rated more attractive\nas a LTP than as a STP. Facial masculinity, health, dominance or warmth were entered in Step 1\nand Smile Ratings were entered in Step 2 to determine whether the effects of interest held true\nwith smiling controlled (see Table 1).\nWhy Masculine Faces Are Preferred in a Short-Term Mate\nTable 1: HLM analysis of the differential attractiveness of men's facial qualities in a short-term\nvs. a long-term partner\nMasculinity Health Dominance Warmth\nStep 1  (SE)  (SE)  (SE)  (SE)\nAs expected, facial masculinity predicted higher STP than LTP attractiveness ratings,\n< .001.

Although\nratings of masculinity were significantly correlated with apparent health and dominance (see\nTable 2), neither qualified as a mediator because both lost significance when masculinity was\n< 1, ns (see Table 1). Moreover, the effect for facial\nmasculinity was not reduced when entering either of these appearance qualities into the model,\nwhich can be seen by comparing the masculinity effect in steps 2 and 3 of Table 1.\nHaving determined that none of the appearance qualities mediated the greater preference\nfor masculinity in a STP, we examined whether masculinity mediated the greater preference for\nhealth or dominance. In both cases, masculinity qualified as a mediator because, as shown in\nTable 1, it remained significant when either apparent health or dominance was in the model and\nthe effects of health and dominance both lost significance. To determine whether there was\nsignificant mediation, we used the bootstrapping method outlined by Preacher and Hayes (2004)\nwith face as the unit of analysis.\nWhy Masculine Faces Are Preferred in a Short-Term Mate\nTable 2. Zero-order correlations among facial qualities using face as the unit of analysis.\n8. Smile rating --\nNote: STP is rated attractiveness as a short-term partner; LTP is rated attractiveness as a long-\nterm partner; STP-LTP is the difference between attractiveness as a short-term and long-term\npartner.\nWith regard to the increased preference for apparent health in a STP, we found that the\nindirect effect of facial masculinity was significant at the p < .01 level, since zero was not\nincluded in the 99% confidence interval, 99%CI: lower limit = .02, upper limit = .24. The more\ntraditional and conservative Sobel test was also significant, Z = 2.33, p = .02 (see Figure 1). It\nseems then that the effect of mating context on preferences for healthy-looking men was\ncompletely mediated by their tendency to look more masculine.\nFigure 1: The standardized beta-coefficients, which show the mediation effect of masculinity on\nthe increased preference for apparent health as a short-term partner, while controlling for\nsmiling.

Thus, the\neffect of mating context on preferences for dominant-looking men was completely mediated by\ntheir tendency to look more masculine.\nApparent Health\nattractiveness\nMasculinity\nSmile ratings\nWhy Masculine Faces Are Preferred in a Short-Term Mate\nFigure 2: The standardized beta-coefficients, which show the mediation effect of masculinity on\nthe increased preference for dominance as a short-term partner.

STP-LTP\nattractiveness is the difference between attractiveness as a short-term and long-term partner. *p <\nFacial masculinity and warmth were unrelated, so facial masculinity did not qualify as a\npotential mediator for the effect of mating context on preferences for warmth. However, smiling\ndid appear to mediate this effect since, as in the study by Roney and colleagues (2006), this\neffect lost significance when the smile ratings were added to the model. Because this possible\nmediation effect replicates previous work (Roney et al., 2006), we formally tested whether\nsmiling mediated the increased preference for warmth as a LTP compared to a STP using the\nbootstrap method (Preacher and Hayes, 2004). As expected, the indirect effect of smiling was\nsignificant at the p < .01 level, since the 99% confidence interval of the indirect effect did not\ncontain zero, 99%CI: lower limit = -.23 upper limit = -.68. The more traditional Sobel test was\nalso significant, Z = -4.64, p < .0001, (see Fig. 3). Thus, the effect of mating context on\npreferences for warm-looking men was completely mediated by their more positive facial\nexpressions.\nFigure 3: The standardized beta-coefficients, which show the mediation effect of the smile\nratings on the increased preference for warmth in a long-term partner. The number in\nparentheses represents the coefficient before the smile ratings were entered into the model. STP-\nLTP attractiveness is the difference in attractiveness between a short-term and long-term partner.\nDiscussion\nThe current study replicated the finding that women prefer men high in masculinity more\nrepresentative sample of real faces, which extends the generalizability of previous findings.\nAdditionally, this was the first study to directly test previous assertions that women prefer men\nhigh in facial masculinity more as a STP than a LTP because they look either healthier, more\nRoney et al., 2006). Our results indicate that this is not the case. Rather, women seem to prefer\nmen high in facial dominance or apparent health more as a STP than a LTP because those men\nWarmth\nattractiveness\nSmile ratings\nDominance\nattractiveness\nMasculinity\nWhy Masculine Faces Are Preferred in a Short-Term Mate\nlook more masculine. In addition, positive facial expressions accounted for women's greater\npreference for men who looked warmer as a LTP than a STP.\nThe greater preference for more masculine-looking men as a STP is consistent with\nprevious research showing that facial masculinity may serve as a cue for genetic quality. Men\nwith more masculine facial features report fewer respiratory infections, less antibiotic use\n(Thornhill and Gangestad, 2006), and have greater developmental stability as evidenced by lower\nlevels of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) (Gangestad and Thornhill, 2003). Furthermore, a sample of\nfaces almost identical to that used in the current study revealed that masculine facial features\npredicted overall health status as assessed through detailed medical records (Rhodes et al., 2003).\nThus it makes sense that women would prefer men high in facial masculinity more as a STP\nwhen genetic benefits are thought to be most important (Gangestad and Simpson, 2000). Indeed,\nwomen do take masculinity as a cue to health, not only in the present study where the two ratings\nwere highly correlated, but also in research demonstrating that increasing the masculinity of\ncomposite faces also increases impressions of apparent health (Johnston et al., 2001; Scarbrough\nAlthough perceived masculinity and apparent health are correlated, they are far from\nidentical. Not only did the greater apparent health of more masculine-looking men fail to\naccount for the greater preference for masculinity in a STP in the present study, but also\nBoothroyd and colleagues (2005) found that women who preferred faces high in apparent health\ndid not necessarily prefer more masculine faces. Furthermore, research has found that women\nshow the greatest preference for apparent health during the low-fertility phase of the menstrual\ncycle when progesterone levels are highest (Jones et al., 2005a; Jones et al., 2005b), which is\nopposite for what has been found with preferences for facial masculinity (Johnston et al., 2001;\nOne way to reconcile the disparity between preferences for masculinity and health is to\nconsider differences between heritable aspects of health and current health. Heritable aspects of\nhealth should be preferred more in a STP than a LTP. On the other hand, current health condition\nis also important for other aspects of mating, including avoiding contagion and securing paternal\ninvestment. Thus, women might prefer very healthy looking men in both short- and long-term\nmating contexts. This is consistent with the fact that we found no effect of mating context on\npreferences for healthier-looking men. However, such effects might be found if assessments of\napparent health differentiated perceptions of heritable aspects of health and current health. Future\nresearch should make such differentiations and also try to identify the facial cues are used to\nassess current and heritable health.\nThe relationship between dominance and facial masculinity is simpler. The two are\npositively correlated, and increasing the masculinity of a face also increases perceptions of\nReierson, 2002). The effects of mating context are also more straight-forward. Since facial\ndominance appears to honestly signal status and reproductive success (Mazur et al., 1994;\nMueller and Mazur, 1996; Mueller and Mazur, 1997), but also aggression and willingness to\nengage in extra-pair copulations (Egan and Angus, 2004), women should prefer dominance more\nin a STP than a LTP. This is exactly what we found, which conceptually replicates work done\nusing dynamic video stimuli (Gangestad, Simpson, Cousins, Garver-Apgar, and Christensen,\n2004). More surprising perhaps, is our finding that women did not prefer dominant-looking men\nmore as a STP than a LTP when the effects of facial masculinity were controlled, and that\nwomen preferred men high in facial masculinity more as a STP than a LTP whether or not\nWhy Masculine Faces Are Preferred in a Short-Term Mate\nperceived dominance was controlled. It seems that women are more sensitive to variation in\nfacial masculinity than to variation in perceived dominance when discriminating between\npotential STPs and LTPs.\nAnother potential mediator for the increased preference for men high in facial\nmasculinity as a STP was perceived warmth. We thought that perhaps masculine-looking men\nwere preferred less as a LTP because they looked less warm and therefore less likely to provide\npaternal investment. There is some research suggesting that testosterone is negatively related to\npaternal investment (Gray, Kahlenberg, Barrett, Lipson, and Ellison, 2002; Gray, Yang, and\nPope, 2006; Storey, Walsh, Quinton, and Wynne-Edwards, 2000), and circulating testosterone\nlevels have been linked to facial masculinity (Penton-Voak and Chen, 2004; Roney et al., 2006).\nYet our results revealed no correlation between facial masculinity and perceived warmth even\nthough women did prefer warmer-looking men more as a LTP than a STP. Similarly, Roney et\nal. (2006) found no relationship between facial masculinity and impressions of potential paternal\ninvestment in real faces. Thus, it seems that men high in facial masculinity are not perceived as\nless warm or as providing less paternal investment. Rather, there appear to be two independent\neffects: women prefer more masculine-looking men more as a STP, and women prefer warmer-\nlooking men less as a STP for reasons other than their less masculine appearance. More\nspecifically, the reason that warmer-looking men were preferred more as a LTP than a STP was\ntheir more positive expression. The fact that this effect was shown when smiling was minimal\nunderscores the importance of considering facial expression when conducting research on mating\npreferences.\nWhereas women do not prefer men high in facial masculinity more as a STP than a LTP\nbecause they look healthier, more dominant or less warm, this preference may reflect the fact\nthat that these men look more like men, and are therefore less likely to be women. Evidence that\nwomen are particularly sensitive to maleness when short-term mating is likely is provided by the\nfinding that women are better at categorizing men when they are in the most fertile phase of the\nmenstrual cycle (Johnston, Arden, Macrae, and Grace, 2003; Macrae, Alnwick, Milne, and\nSchloerscheidt, 2002). Further evidence that women are responding to the extent that the men\nlooked unmistakably male is provided by our findings that increased preferences for healthy and\ndominant looking men as a STP were explained by the fact that these men looked more\nmasculine. While our results are consistent with the idea that women prefer men high in facial\nmasculinity more as a STP simply because they look more like men, future research is needed to\ndirectly test this assertion.\nLimitations\nOur results suggest that women's increased preference for men high in facial masculinity\nas a STP are not due to impressions of some attribute associated with masculinity. However, we\nonly tested the three attributes of health, dominance, and warmth. It is possible that some other\nattribute, such as apparent fidelity or willingness to invest in the relationship, can explain why\nwomen prefer masculine-looking men more as a STP than a LTP.\nThere are also a number of individual difference variables that have been found to predict\npreferences for facial masculinity, such as relationship status, self- and other-rated attractiveness,\nposition in the menstrual cycle, etc. (Johnston et al., 2001; Jones et al., 2005a; Little, Burt,\nthese individual difference variables might moderate the mediation effects we examined. The\nWhy Masculine Faces Are Preferred in a Short-Term Mate\ncurrent study found that impressions of health, dominance, and warmth did not mediate the\nincreased preference for facial masculinity as a STP for women overall. However, there could\npossibly be a subgroup of women who, for example, prefer masculine men more as a short-term\npartner because they look more dominant.\nFinally, we used a representative sample of real faces, which gave us less control over the\nstimuli. However, we view this as more of a strength than a weakness, since we have shown that\nthe effect is sufficiently robust to be manifest over and above whatever noise is contributed by\nuncontrolled facial qualities. In addition, our findings concerning the mediating effects of other\nvariables can be generalized to a real population of faces.\nConclusions\nPrevious research suggests that facial masculinity is (or ancestrally was) associated with\ngenetic quality in men (Folstad and Karter, 1992; Gangestad and Thornhill, 2003; Rhodes et al.,\n2003; Thornhill and Gangestad, 2006). Thus it makes sense that women should prefer\nmasculine-looking men more as a STP than a LTP. However, a number of mechanisms could\npotentially explain this effect of mating context. The results of this study suggest that women do\nnot show an increased preference for masculine-looking men because they look healthier, more\ndominant, or less warm. Instead, it seems that women's greater preference for masculine-\nlooking men as a STP is fundamental. Evolution may have shaped women to obtain genetic\nquality when it is most important (e.g. when evaluating a STP) by simply looking to mate with\nthose who looked most like men (Enquist, Ghirlanda, Lundqvist, and Wachtmeister, 2002).\n"
