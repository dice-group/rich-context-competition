    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Data from the 1997 Robert Wood\nJohnson Foundation Employer Health Insurance\nSurvey provide the first national estimates of the\nprevalence of pooled purchasing under all major\narrangements. About one-quarter of all busi-\nnesses participate in a pool; smaller businesses\nare more likely to participate, and there is sub-\nstantial geographic variation in the prevalence of\npool participation. Pooling appears to have mod-\nest positive effects on the availability of em-\nployee choice among plans (especially health\nmaintenance organizations) and on the availabil-\nity of information about plan quality. On the other\nhand, pooling as now construed does not seem\nto have enhanced the accessibility or affordabil-\nity of insurance to employers.\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : M A R K E T W A T C H\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J u l y / A u g u s t 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The extent of\npooled purchasing may vary across markets.\nIn markets with high managed care penetra-\ntion rates, HMOs may have a greater incentive\nto participate in pools to seek market share,\nthereby increasing pools' attractiveness to\nemployers. On the other hand, greater man-\naged care penetration may lead to lower costs,\nblunting employers' incentive to seek cost-\ncontrol solutions through pooling. Finally, the\ngreater the heterogeneity of the workforce,\nthe more likely the business is to participate\nin a pooled arrangement, to cater to the varied\ntastes of its employees.\nThis paper draws on a large national sur-\nvey of employer health insurance to examine\nthe prevalence of pooled purchasing and to\ntest hypotheses about its effects and about\nemployers' participation.\nJohnson Foundation Employer Health Insur-\nance Survey to measure the extent and effects\nof pooled purchasing. The survey interviewed\nple was drawn from the Dun's Market Identi-\nfiers national census of employment estab-\nlishments, supplemented by list samples of\nemployers participating in specified health in-\nsurance purchasing alliances in three states\n(California Managed Risk Medical Insurance\nBoard, Connecticut Business and Industry\nAssociation, and Florida Community Health\nPurchasing Alliances).7 The sample was con-\ncentrated in the sixty communities followed\nby the Community Tracking Study and in\ntwelve states with significant small-group in-\nsurance reforms, the latter chosen for research\non small-group rating reforms or special\npooled purchasing programs for small\ngroups.8 Within geographic units the samples\nwere further allocated to strata defined by the\nnumber of workers at the establishment. The\nsample establishments are weighted for these\nanalyses to represent all private employment\nestablishments with at least one employee in\nthe continental United States.\nData were collected by computer-assisted\ntelephone interviews averaging thirty min-\nutes each. The interview was conducted with\nthe person or persons in each establishment\nwho were most knowledgeable about health\nbenefits and firm and worker characteristics.9\nThe response rate was 60 percent.\nbased our definition of pooled purchasing on\nthe respondent's assessment by asking all es-\ntablishments that offer insurance, \"Does your\ncompany purchase health insurance through:\na health insurance purchasing cooperative or\nalliance; a business coalition; a multiple em-\nployer trust (MET) or a multiple employer\nwelfare association (MEWA); or a trade or\nprofessional association, or other membership\norganization?\" For most analyses we classi-\nfied employers according to whether they en-\ngaged in pooled purchasing, regardless of the\nspecific type.10 For selected characteristics,\nwe compared employers participating in one\nof the three largest statewide small-employer\npurchasing cooperatives (named above) with\nemployers participating in other pooled\narrangements.\nAlthough the sample and analysis unit is\nthe establishment--the firm's physical loca-\ntion--for many analyses we categorized es-\ntablishments according to the firm's size,\nwhich includes employees at all locations na-\ntionwide. We did this because insurance de-\ncisions are typically made at a regional or na-\ntional level for firms with several\nestablishments.\nWe classified establishments by the state\nin which they were located and by the degree\nof HMO penetration in their area. The latter\nwas measured only for the sixty Community\nTracking Study sites; it was calculated from\nthe survey data as the share of employees in\nthe site enrolled in their employer-sponsored\nplan who were in an HMO. Classification of a\nplan as an HMO was based on the respon-\ndent's self-assessment, aided by complete\ndefinitions of plan types as needed.\nEmployers were classified as \"offering a\nchoice of plans\" if they offered two or more\nplans, whether of the same or different types\nand whether through the same or different\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : M A R K E T W A T C H\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 4\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The survey\ncollected these data only for firms offering a\nchoice of plans and having 500 or more em-\nployees nationwide. The specific types of in-\nformation considered were enrollee satisfac-\ntion ratings and plan performance measures\nsuch as Health Plan Employer Data and Infor-\nmation Set (HEDIS) measures.\nFinally, we measured both the current\nhealth insurance premium level and the\nchange from the previous year. The former\nmeasure was based on plan-specific data, re-\nported separately for single and family rates.11\nThe latter measure was based on an estab-\nlishment-level question about change in total\nhealth insurance cost per enrollee compared\nwith the last plan year.\nRESULTS\nTwenty-six percent of all businesses partici-\npate in some form of pooled purchasing for\nhealth insurance, including purchasing alli-\nances, business coalitions, multiple employer\narrangements, or trade and other associations.\nParticipation is more prevalent among smaller\nfirms, ranging from 33 percent of those with\nfewer than ten employees to 14 percent of\nthose with 500 or more employees (Exhibit 1).\nThe prevalence of pooled purchasing varies\nconsiderably across geographic areas. In the\nten states for which we had an adequate sam-\nple size to support state estimates, participa-\ntion rates ranged from 21 percent to 42 per-\ncent (Exhibit 2). Surprisingly, the three states\nwith the largest formal purchasing alliances\nfor small business--California, Florida, and\nConnecticut--represented the full range of\nparticipation rates among the ten states\nshown. Similarly, California and Connecticut\nhad the lowest and highest participation\nrates, respectively, when we limited our focus\nto establishments with fewer than fifty em-\nployees. The extent of managed care penetra-\ntion apparently has little to do with the de-\ngree of pooled purchasing (Exhibit 2).\nOne objective of pooled purchasing is to\nincrease the accessibility of insurance, espe-\ncially among small employers. If this objective\nis being met, we would expect to find that a\nhigher percentage of pool participants re-\ncently began to offer insurance. Yet this per-\ncentage, illustrated by establishments offer-\ning insurance for two years or less, is not\ngreater for small businesses participating in a\npool (Exhibit 3).\nWe did not see evidence of differential risk\nselection in pooled purchasing arrangements.\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : M A R K E T W A T C H\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J u l y / A u g u s t 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

We also\nfound little evidence to support the hypothe-\nsis that heterogeneity of workers within the\nestablishment, leading to more varied tastes\nfor health insurance products, increases the\nlikelihood of pooled purchasing. Equal pro-\nportions of businesses that did and did not\nparticipate in pools scored in the top quartile\nof a measure of age and income heterogeneity\nof workers (Exhibit 3).12 In analyses limited to\nsmall businesses in California, Connecticut,\nand Florida--that is, the states with estab-\nlished purchasing alliances--we also did not\nfind support for the risk-selection or worker\nheterogeneity hypotheses.\neral, participating in any pooled purchasing\narrangement has a modest positive effect on\nwhether small and medium-size businesses\noffer a choice of two or more health plans to\ntheir employees. Participation in a pool raises\nthe likelihood that a choice of plans is offered\nfrom 12 percent to 15 percent in firms of under\n500 employees (Exhibit 4). In contrast, how-\never, 80 percent of the participants in the\nthree state-specific purchasing alliances for\nsmall businesses offer a choice of plans, versus\n23 percent of employers in these three states\nwho participate in another type of pool and 15\npercent of those who do not participate in\npooled purchasing at all. Choice of plan is not\nuniversal under these alliances because not all\nalliances require participating employers to\nParticipation in pooled purchasing also\nslightly, but consistently, increases the likeli-\nhood that employees are offered an HMO. In\nsmall and medium-size businesses nation-\nwide, 43 percent of pool participants offered\ntheir employees an HMO option, compared\nwith 40 percent of nonparticipants. The rate\nis considerably higher in the three study alli-\nances--about 80 percent. HMO penetration\nin these three states is only somewhat above\naverage, yet alliance participants are consider-\nably more likely to offer an HMO, even com-\npared with other pooled purchasers in these\nstates.\nPooled purchasing also has a positive effect\non the provision of information to aid con-\nsumers in choosing among plans (not shown).\nPercentage Of Establishments Participating In Pooled Purchasing Arrangements In\nSelected States And By HMO Penetration, 1997\nState\nCalifornia\nNew Jersey\nMinnesota\nMaryland\nFlorida\nWashington\nOregon\nNew York\nMassachusetts\nConnecticut\nHMO penetration\nLowa\nHighb\nSOURCE: 1997 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Employer Health Insurance Survey.\nNOTE: HMO is health maintenance organization.\na Lowest quartile of market areas.\nb Highest quartile of market areas.\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : M A R K E T W A T C H\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 4\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

This may be because we com-\nbined all of the different forms of pooling. We\nfound much stronger effects when we consid-\nered the three small-business alliances\nseparately.\nWe found descriptive evidence that pooled\npurchasing has no effect on cost. Our evidence\nis far from definitive, however. For example,\nthere is a chance that higher-cost employer\ngroups choose pools in an effort to reduce\ntheir health insurance outlays, leading to\nhigher observed costs for pool participants\nand lower observed costs for nonparticipants.\nHowever, given the similarity of the age and\nsex distribution of participant and nonpar-\nPlan Choices Offered By Small And Medium-Size Businesses That Do And Do Not\nParticipate In Purchasing Pools, By Firm Size, 1997\nNumber of employees in firm\nCharacteristic\nFewer\nAll firms of\nPercent offering a choice of plans\nNationwide\nParticipate in any pool\nDo not participate\nCalifornia, Connecticut, Florida\nParticipate in alliancea\nParticipate in other pool\nDo not participate\n\u00adb\nPercent offering an HMO\nNationwide\nParticipate in any pool\nDo not participate\nCalifornia, Connecticut, Florida\nParticipate in alliancea\nParticipate in other pool\nDo not participate\n\u00adb\nSOURCE: 1997 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Employer Health Insurance Survey.\nNOTE: HMO is health maintenance organization.\na Includes California Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board, Connecticut Business and Industry Association, and Florida\nCommunity Health Purchasing Alliances.\nb Not applicable (alliances are limited to small employers).\nPremiums And One-Year Change In Premiums For Businesses That Do And Do Not\nFewer than 50 employees 50 or more employees\nIn pool Not in pool In pool Not in pool\nMonthly single premium\nMonthly family premium\nOne-year change\nSOURCE: 1997 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Employer Health Insurance Survey.\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : M A R K E T W A T C H\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 4\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

One possible ex-\nplanation for the similarity of costs in and out\nof pools is that the pools have led to market\nspillover savings through heightened compe-\ntition. But it seems likely that in many cases\npools are simply alternative ways to get to the\nsame products everyone else is offering.\nClearly, there is a need for more research\nbeyond what this first descriptive study can\ndo. The pooled purchasing we examined com-\nprised a broad range of arrangements.

Long and M. Susan Marquis\nPolicymakers at both the federal\nand state levels are interested in pooled\npurchasing of employer health plans as\na way of making insurance more accessible\nand affordable. They see pooled purchasing as\na way to control costs, especially for small\nemployers, by aggregating purchasing power\nacross many employers, coordinating admini-\nstration, and promoting the principles of\nmanaged competition.1 Even for medium-size\nand large employers, pooled purchasing looks\nlike a promising arrangement to provide the\nexpertise to undertake selective contracting\nwith plans, to negotiate prices, and to collect\nand share data on plan quality.2 On the other\nhand, some observers fear that purchasing\npools lead to greaterrisk selection. If the pools\nare open to all employers while the rest of the\nmarket is not, then they may become dump-\ning grounds for high-risk employer groups,\nleading to spirals of adverse selection.3 Yet if\npools are permitted to determine which em-\nployers are offered entry, they might work\nagainst access and affordability by selecting\nonly groups with favorable risk profiles.\nSeveral hypotheses have been advanced\nabout the likely effects of pooled purchasing.\nPools are expected to make insurance accessi-\nble to employers who otherwise would not\npurchase insurance. They also are expected to\nafford more choices to employees, both in the\nnumber of plans offered and especially in ac-\ncess to health maintenance organizations\n(HMOs) for employees in small groups.4 Em-\nployers participating in pools are expected to\nprovide workers with more information\nabout their health plan options, and particu-\nlarly about the quality of health plans.5 Fi-\nnally, pooled purchasing is expected to lower\npremium costs--at minimum for participat-\ning employers, and possibly through spillover\neffects to the rest of the market.6\nPolicymakers also have expectations about\nwhich employers will be most likely to par-\nticipate in pooled purchasing arrangements.\nSmall employers are expected to join pools\nmore often than large ones are, because large\ngroups already enjoy the advantages of lower\nclaims variability, economies of scale in ad-\nministration, and greater market power in ne-\n\u00a91999ThePeople-to-People Health Foundation,Inc.\nSteve Long and Susan Marquis are senior economists at RAND in Washington, D.C."
