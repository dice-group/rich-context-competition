It is well established that there are differences in exercise\ncapacities in the two sexes but how much of that difference reflects on disease severity or\ncorrelates to markers of severity in the two sexes is still not clear. Right heart catheterization\n(RHC) and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) have been widely used for assessing\nfunctional capacity, prognosis and treatment response in IPAH. We aimed to investigate the\n`sex-specific' CPET parameters in relation to hemodynamics in IPAH.\nMethods: Data were retrieved from 30 males and 53 females [mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD)\nShanghai Pulmonary Hospital from 2010 to 2016. Univariate and forward/backward multiple\nstepwise regression analysis was performed to assess the prognostic value of CPET and\nhemodynamic parameters.\nResults: There were no significant differences in clinical variables between men and women.\nPeak workload, peak oxygen uptake, anaerobic threshold (AT), peak minute ventilation, carbon\ndioxide output, O2\npulse and oxygen uptake efficiency slope were significantly higher in men\ncompared with women (p < 0.05). Several CPET indexes correlated with hemodynamics.\nPulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and cardiac output (CO) were distinctly different between\nthe sexes.

Peak maximum oxygen consumption (VO2\n) was\nindependently predictive of CO decline in all patients and in men. Only peak O2\npulse was an\nindependent predictor of increased PVR and decreased CO in women.\nConclusions: Even after adjusting for age, body mass index and World Health Organization\nfunctional class, different CPET parameters correlated with PVR elevation and CO decline in\nmen and women differently, which could potentially better predict severity in men and women\nwith IPAH.\n",

While new developments\nregarding epidemiology and therapeutic options\nin IPAH are being reported [Hoeper et al. 2013;\nHumbert et al. 2010], one important question has\nemerged over the years: how does a sex difference\nin the incidence of this disease reflect disease\nseverity? Identified as the earliest modifier in all\nthe epidemiological studies, IPAH occurs pre-\ndominantly in females [Badesch et al. 2010], with\nincidence of 1.9- to 10-fold higher, depending on\na specific subtype and registry of patients [Pugh\nand Hemnes, 2010]. With regards prognosis, the\ninfluence of sex is reversed [Shapiro et al. 2012].\nSex-specific cardiopulmonary exercise\ntesting indices related to hemodynamics in\nidiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension\nPing Yuan, Tian-Xiang Chen, Bigyan Pudasaini, Jie Zhang, Jian Guo, Si-Jin Zhang,\nLan Wang, Qin-Hua Zhao, Su-Gang Gong, Rong Jiang, Wen-Hui Wu, Jing He,\nJin-Ming Liu and Qing-Hua Hu\n Keywords: CO, CPET, IPAH, PVR, sex difference\nCorrespondence to:\nJin-Ming Liu, MD and\nQing-hua Hu, MD, PhD\nShanghai Pulmonary\nHospital, Tongji University,\nSchool of Medicine, No.\nand\nqinghuaa@mails.tjmu.\nedu.cn\nPing Yuan, MD\nTian-Xiang Chen, MD\nBigyan Pudasaini, MD\nJian Guo, MD\nSi-Jin Zhang, MD\nLan Wang, MD\nQin-Hua Zhao, MD\nSu-Gang Gong, MD\nRong Jiang, MD\nWen-Hui Wu, MD\nJing He, MD\nDepartment of Cardio-\nPulmonary Circulation,\nShanghai Pulmonary\nHospital, Tongji University,\nSchool of Medicine,\nShanghai, China\nJie Zhang\nThe Organization and\nPersonnel Department,\nQilu Children's Hospital\nof Shandong University,\nShandong University,\nShandong, China\nOriginal Research\nTherapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 11(3)\n136 journals.sagepub.com/home/tar\nBoth the French and the US-based registry\n[Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term\nPulmonary Arterial Hypertension Disease\nManagement (REVEAL)], characterized prog-\nnostic indicators and concluded that males have\nworse outcomes [Benza et al. 2010; Mathai et al.\n2015]. In recent years, many studies have already\ndemonstrated sex affects some signal pathways in\nthe development of PAH [Kandhi et al. 2015;\nthe majority of studies demonstrate effects of sex\ndifference on cause, treatment and survival in\nPAH [Martin and Pabelick, 2014]. The hypoth-\nesis we propose is that sex differences exist in the\nprognostic assessment indexes of the same test\nmethod. However, to date, there is no clear con-\nsensus of whether sex difference has an impact\non alteration of exercise capacity, metabolism,\nventilation, cardiovascular and gas exchange\nparameters in patients with IPAH. Gas exchange\nmeasurements during cardiopulmonary exercise\ntesting (CPET) must be looked at with regards to\ncellular respiration and how cardiopulmonary\nmechanisms are coupled to it. Most IPAH\npatients have gas exchange limitations attributed\nto an impaired vasodilator response of the pulmo-\nnary arteries to exercise [Tan et al. 2014]. CPET\ndescribes the underlying physiologic abnormali-\nties associated with the hypoperfusion of the pul-\nmonary vascular bed in IPAH [Oudiz et al. 2006],\nwhich has been used to gain insights into exer-\ntional abnormalities in patients with PAH for\ndecades. Exercise limitations in PAH are the\nresult of dysfunctions from various physiological\nsystems and CPET has been used extensively\nfor evaluating these dysfunctions. This is central\nto some recently published important reviews\nUsefulness of CPET owes to its ability to uncover\nabnormalities in the VO2\ncascade [Sherry et al.\n2016]. Additionally, CPEt allows reproducible\nassessment of functional capacity and treatment\nefficacy in patients with IPAH [Wensel, 2002].\nThere are massive differences in CPET parame-\nters between healthy male and female subjects,\nbut whether these differences are replicated in\npatients with IPAH is still unclear. In addition,\nwhether different CPET parameters can predict\noutcomes in male and female patients with IPAH\nis also unknown.\nThus, the objectives of the present study were to\nexplore whether sex difference has an impact on\nalteration of CPET parameters in patients with\nincident IPAH and to correlate CPET measure-\nments with hemodynamic variables as measured\nby right-heart catheterization (RHC).\nMethods\nPopulation study\n(30 males, 53 females) with incident IPAH, aged\nmore than 18-years old, were evaluated at\nShanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Shanghai. The\ndiagnosis of IPAH was established according to\nthe most recent pulmonary hypertension guide-\nlines, specifically, by the presence of a mean pul-\nmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) > 25 mmHg\nand a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure\n(PCWP)  15 mm Hg, as assessed by RHC\n[Hoeper et al. 2013]. Patients with PAH associ-\nated with a definite cause, such as connective tis-\nsue disease and congenital heart disease, and\nthose with portopulmonary hypertension, chronic\npulmonary obstruction, chronic pulmonary\nthromboembolism and pulmonary hypertension\ndue to left heart disease were excluded. We also\nexcluded patients with acute or chronic illnesses\nthat might influence hormonal metabolism (i.e.\nacute or chronic infections, chronic autoimmune\ndiseases, previously established primary endo-\ncrine disorders), and patients receiving any hor-\nmonal treatment (thyroid hormones, anabolic\nsteroids, corticosteroids) or drugs that markedly\ninhibit hormone production, either at the time of\nthe study or in the past.\nThe study protocol was reviewed and approved by\nthe Ethics Committee of Shanghai Pulmonary\nWritten informed consent was obtained from each\npatient for inclusion into the study and prior to the\nperformance of any study-related procedures.\nAssessment of patients\nPatients underwent RHC and a 6-minute walk\ndistance (6MWD) test within 3 months of each\npatient's CPET study, their World Health\nOrganization functional class (WHO FC)\nand N-terminal Natriuretic peptide type-B\n(NT-proBNP) were determined. RHC was per-\nformed following standard protocols [Jing et al.\ning to American Thoracic Society guidelines\n[American Thoracic Society, 2002], and a Borg\nP Yuan, T-X Chen et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tar 137\ndyspnea score was determined immediately\nafter the 6MWD test. Immediately prior to their\nCPET studies, patients had standard pulmo-\nnary function tests.\nEach patient performed a physician-supervised,\nstandard, progressively increasing work rate\nCPET to maximum tolerance on an electromag-\nnetically braked cycle ergometer. The protocol\ncomprised of 3 minutes of rest, 3 minutes of\nunloaded cycling at 55\u00ad65 revolutions per min-\nute (rpm), followed by a progressively increasing\nwork rate of 5\u00ad15 Watts (W)/minute for PH\npatients and 20\u00ad25 W/minute for the normal\nsubjects to the maximum tolerance, and 4 min-\nutes of recovery [Sue and Wasserman, 1991].\nPulse oximetry, heart rate (HR), 12-lead electro-\ncardiography, and cuff blood pressure were mon-\nitored and recorded. Minute ventilation (VE,\nBTPS), maximum oxygen consumption (VO2\n,\nSTPD), carbon dioxide output (VCO2\n, STPD),\nand other exercise variables were computer cal-\nculated breath by breath, interpolated second by\nsecond, and averaged over 10-second intervals\n[Sue and Wasserman, 1991]. The anaerobic\nthreshold (AT) ratio of oxygen pulse (O2\npulse)\nwas determined as previously described\n[Magalang and Grant, 1995]. Exercise, meta-\nbolic and cardiovascular capacity were expressed\nas workload, VO2\npulse and HR respectively.\nVentilatory efficiency during exercise was\nexpressed as VCO2\n, VE, the ratio of VO2\n/VE,\n(oxygen uptake efficiency plateau)\nOUEP, oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES)\nand the slope of VE versus VCO2\nover the linear\ncomponent of the plot of VE versus VCO2\n[Shi\net al. 2016]. Gas exchange efficiency was\nexpressed as carbon dioxide elimination/oxygen\nconsumption (RER) and end-tidal partial pres-\nsure of CO2\n). The rate of VO2\nincrease\nduring unloaded cycling was expressed as the\nmean response time (MRT) for a monoexpo-\nnential curve fit to the second-by-second VO2\nmeasurements during the 3 minutes of unloaded\ncycling [Sun et al. 2001]. If the first breath VO2\nequaled the 3-minute VO2\n, the MRT was consid-\nered equal to the duration of the first breath.\nStatistical analysis\nResults are expressed as mean with standard\ndeviation (SD) or medians (and interquartile\nrange) for continuous variables and absolute\nnumber for categorical variables. The sample size\nand the power were analyzed by NCSS-PASS (\u00a9\nCopyright 2011 NCSS LLC., Kaysville, UT)\nversion 11.0.7. Comparisons were performed\nusing Student's t test or Mann\u00adWhitney U test,\nfor continuous variables and chi-square test for\ncategorical variables. Correlations were assessed\nusing Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.\nTo determine the strength of the association\nfound between hemodynamic and CPET varia-\nbles found to correlate with IPAH at univariate\nanalysis, we performed forward/backward multi-\nple stepwise regression analysis with hemody-\nnamic variables as the dependent outcome. We\nforced age, body mass index (BMI) and WHO\nFC into the models to adjust multiple regression\nanalysis. p values < 0.05 were considered signifi-\ncant. The main analysis was performed using\nSPSS (Statistic Package for Social Science,\nResults\nPatient population\nDemographics, baseline and hemodynamic data\nare illustrated in Table 1. There was no difference\nin BMI between the two sexes and age was almost\n83 patients had WHO FC reported at diagnosis.\nYet there were no differences in overall WHO\nFC between the two groups.

Peak\nworkload and the metabolic parameter, that is,\nand AT was significantly higher in male\npatients with IPAH. Male patients also had higher\npeak VE and peak VCO2\n.

Peak VO2\n, peak VCO2\n,\nOUES, peak O2\npulse, peak PET\nand PET\nat AT were negatively correlated to PVR in\nmales, while only peak O2\npulse negatively cor-\nrelated with PVR in females only. Only VE/VCO2\nslope had significant positive correlation with\nPVR in all IPAH patients as a whole or in male\npatients when comparing them as three separate\ngroups.\nPeak workload, peak VO2\n, AT, peak VCO2\n,\nOUES, peak O2\npulse, peak PET\nand PET\nat AT correlated positively with CO in all patients.\nTable 1.

Evidence since the last 2 decades and\nbeyond have already established that there are\ndifferences in exercise capacities between the two\net al. 1973]. Also, work efficiency in humans is\nrelatively fixed for a given work task as well. While\nrace, body build and genetic predispositions can\nall influence exercise capacity, how a differently\nreduced exercise capacity between the two sexes\nreflects impaired hemodynamics is still not clear\n[Wasserman and Whipp, 1975]. It has been well\nestablished that VO2\n/kg fairly represents meta-\nbolic demand. Both peak VO2\nand VE/VCO2\nslope and their predicted normal for a particular\npatient would be fairly accurate in terms of their\npredictive ability [McLaughlin et al. 2013;\nSchwaiblmair et al. 2012]. The current paper per-\nhaps is the first to report that a relationship\nbetween CPET parameters and PVR as well as\nCO exists in IPAH. Sex differences of CPET\nparameters have received far less attention than\nhemodynamic parameters in IPAH. We hope this\npaper will serve its purpose of trying to reason\nwhy the difference in exercise capacities affects\nhemodynamics in a particular disease spectrum,\nin this case, IPAH. Although being an initial\nsmall sample study (n = 83), several CPET\nindexes reflected `sex-specific' differences and\nsome of them were able to predict PVR and CO\nindependently.\nThere were no significant sex differences in\nWHO-FC, 6MWD, NT-proBNP or hemody-\nnamics at the time of diagnosis and treatment in\nTable 4.

Thus, sex may affect\nthe hemodynamics in our study. The REVEAL\nRegistry indicated that male PAH patients\ncategorized as New York Heart Association\nFunctional Classification I-II (NYHA FCI-II),\nhad higher mPAP, mRAP, CO and 6MWD at\ndiagnosis [Shapiro et al. 2012].Their results are\nnot completely consistent with ours. One possible\nreason is our small sample size, while the REVEAL\nRegistry included 2969 patients, which is a large\nsample study. Another possible reason is that they\nclassified patients differently, that is, patients in\nour study labeled as IPAH, are classified as IPAH,\nFPAH, CTD-PAH, CHD-PAH and other asso-\nciated PAH subgroups in the REVEAL Registry\nThe actual values for all CPET variables were com-\npared between the two sexes because predicted val-\nues are often adjusted for some factors, that is,\nsex. Jarvis and colleagues demonstrated that dif-\nferences in muscle mass, fiber type or the way\nenergy production takes place in the two sexes in\nhealthy humans, suggesting male IPAH patients\ndemonstrate higher metabolism and ventilation\ncompared with female patients [Jarvis et al. 2011].\nOur data indicate that exercise capacity, metabolic,\nventilatory and cardiovascular parameters, the four\nkey aspects of any CPET, were all higher in male\nIPAH patients than in females. As described above,\nperhaps a larger muscle mass, as seen in males, is a\nreason that male patients probably have better car-\ndiovascular and exercise pliability. The role of sex\nhormones in causation of IPAH may be another\nkey factor as well when interpreting these sex differ-\nences. Sex hormones, especially estradiol and its\nmetabolites, may affect metabolic enzymes, some\nsignal pathway and epigenetics in cardiopulmonary\nvascular systems [Kandhi et al. 2015; Mair et al.\nlimitations are seen with cardiopulmonary function\nin female patients with IPAH.\nCPET with gas exchange measurements has the\npotential of noninvasively grading the severity of\nexercise limitation, quantifying the hypoperfusion\nof the lung and systemic circulation, and assessing\nresponses to treatment before overt right ventricu-\nlar failure, and PAH is evident even at rest [Wax\nleagues go even further by making class recom-\nmendations for CPET, for diagnostic evaluation\nTable 5.

Thus, a wide range of correlations\nbetween CPET parameters, and PVR and CO\nwere seen in all patients in the present study. Not\nonly due to sex difference, different body struc-\ntures, or because PVR is the product of mPAP\nand CO, but also because men may have higher\nbaseline mPAP, mRAP and CO [Lahm et al.\nAlong with gas exchange inefficiency and meta-\nbolic abnormalities, exercise and cardiovascular\nfunction are also impaired, which contribute to a\ndecline in CO in IPAH [Guo et al. 2015; Tan\n, as a metabolic parameter,\nassesses the subject's maximal exercise ability and\nthe maximal compensatory ability of the circula-\ntory system to raise CO [Sun et al. 2001]. The\ndecreased PET\nin IPAH or cardiac failure\npatients is considered derived from the ventila-\ntion\u00adperfusion mismatch and the increased ratio\nof physiologic dead space to tidal volume\npulse, as a cardiovascular parameter,\nlikely reflects a progressive reduction in peak\nstroke volume paralleling disease severity with its\nprogressive decline [Sun et al. 2001]. Although\nthe number of female patients was 1.33 times the\nnumber of male patients in the present study, the\nmultivariate analyses of all patients showed simi-\nlar results to that of men, suggesting that all\npatients perhaps have more severe gas exchange\ninefficiency and metabolic abnormalities than\ncardiovascular abnormalities. Multivariate analy-\nses also indicated that peak PET\nwere associated most with PVR elevation and\nCO decline in male patients with IPAH. These\nresults demonstrate that men may have worse gas\nexchange efficiency and metabolic abnormalities.\npulse can be considered as independent\npredictor of PVR elevation and CO decline in\nfemale patients, suggesting women may have\nworse cardiovascular dysfunction. Interestingly,\npeak PET\nwas an independent predictor of\nincreased PVR in all patients, while peak VO2\nwas\nalso an independent predictor of CO decline in\nsuch patients. However, the exact reason why\nmen and women had different results on multi-\nvariate analyses needs to be further explored, and\nwhether sex hormones contribute to this also\nneeds further research.\nIPAH patients included in this study were small,\nand without further PAH subgroup classifica-\ntion, that is, FPAH, CTD-PAH, CHD-PAH.\nTherefore, the sex differences of CPET variables\nare valid only specifically for IPAH patients for\nnow. Because CPET variables may be abnormal\nin patients with other PAH subgroups, the\nindependent predictors of increased PVR and\ndecreased CO perhaps could be reflected by\nother CPET variables in those disease groups as\nwell. In addition, other factors, that is, race and\ngenetic predisposition, could influence meta-\nbolic, ventilatory and exercise capacity, but were\nnot considered in the present study.\nIn summary, our findings suggest that several\nCPET indexes showed `sex-specific' differences\nand some of them could also predict PVR and\nCO independently. Further validation of these\nsex differences are needed from larger samples of\nPAH patients to determine if sex hormones con-\ntribute to the difference in CPET variables.\n"
