Given the high disease burden\namong young women, national recommendations encouraging an-\nnual screening of all sexually active young women under the age\nguidelines have led to a wealth of data on the epidemiology of\nchlamydia among women; the general population chlamydia prev-\nalence among young women aged 14 to 19 years is 4.9%, whereas\nrates in excess of 19% are found among young women (aged 20\nyears) in adult correctional facilities.1,5 However, the epidemiol-\nogy of chlamydia among men in the   has not been\ncharacterized thoroughly.\nIncreasingly, the importance of understanding and addressing\nchlamydia infections among men is being recognized.6 The role of\nidentifying and treating male infections in preventing adverse\noutcomes among women, such as pelvic inflammatory disease,\nectopic pregnancy, and infertility, has prompted some researchers\nto call for chlamydia screening guidelines directed at detecting\nmale infections.6 Untreated chlamydia infections may rarely have\ndirect adverse outcomes among men, including epididymitis and\nproctitis.7 Currently, males are opportunistically tested for chla-\nmydia; no recommendations for screening males for chlamydia\nexist.\nAlthough several existing studies have examined chlamydia\ninfections in men, these studies are typically geographically lim-\nited (restricted to one or several urban locales), targeted to a certain\nportion of the population, such as military recruits, or were con-\nducted a number of years ago.8\u00ad13 Using data from existing sources,\nwe sought to characterize and summarize genital C. trachomatis\ninfections among men in the  , both in the general\npopulation and in specific subpopulations.\nMaterials and Methods\nWe reviewed published data from national sources on chla-\nmydia infection among men in the  , including data\nfrom national surveys and programs.

Chlamydia was added to the nationally\nreported chlamydia cases to CDC. Cases are diagnosed based on\nthe current chlamydia case definition,14 but test technologies used\nvary across reporting areas. Data are not deduplicated; therefore, a\nsingle individual may contribute more than 1 case per year, if\nmultiple diagnoses are made. Morbidity data are reported in an\nannual summary produced by CDC using both absolute case\ncounts and case rates per 100,000 population, stratified on demo-\ngraphic factors such as sex, age, and race/ethnicity.1,15\u00ad18 Age\ngreater than 64. Race/ethnicity groups included in the annual\nsummary are non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic,\nAsian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native.\nPrevalence\nGeneral Population. NHANES is a cross-sectional survey that\nprovided data on demographics, sexual behavior, and chlamydia\nprevalence of the general US household population through inter-\nspecimens were tested for chlamydia using a ligase chain reaction\nassay (LCx, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). The NHANES\nsampling plan is a stratified, multistage, probability cluster design\nthat selected a sample representative of the US civilian noninsti-\ntutionalized population. Eighty-three percent of persons aged 14 to\nA prospective cohort study, AddHealth tracked a school-based\nprobability sample of 18,924 adolescents to adulthood (Wave I).\nWave III follow-up data were collected from April 2001 to May\n2002. Sixty-six percent of the original Wave I cohort provided\nurine specimens, approximately half of them were men. Men\nranged from 18 to 26 years.19 Urine specimens were tested by\nligase chain reaction assay to identify the presence of C. tracho-\nmatis. Prevalence rates were calculated while taking into account\nthe AddHealth sampling methodology.\nSpecific Populations. Male chlamydia positivity data are col-\nlected from participating juvenile corrections facilities and adult\ncorrections facilities and reported annually.1,15\u00ad18 Data are ob-\ntained through CDC's Corrections Prevalence Monitoring Project\nand the national Infertility Prevention Program. Chlamydia is\ndiagnosed based on the detection of C. trachomatis using locally\nselected laboratory tests, including both nucleic acid amplification\ntests (NAATs) and non-NAATs. Males were voluntarily screened\nupon entry into the correctional facility. Data consist of test results\nthat are not linked to individuals; a single individual could have\nmultiple tests during the course of a year. Therefore, positivity\nrates (not prevalence rates) are calculated using the total number of\npositive chlamydia tests as the numerator and the total number of\npositive and negative chlamydia tests as the denominator. Positiv-\nity rates have been found to accurately approximate prevalence\nrates in monitoring chlamydia rates in these populations.20 In\naddition to annual reports, a more detailed analysis was recently\nMen entering into the National Job Training Program, a program\nfor socioeconomically disadvantaged youth aged 16 to 24 years,\nwere routinely screened for chlamydia from July 2003 to Decem-\nber 2004; data were subsequently analyzed.22 Chlamydia cases were\nidentified via the use of a strand displacement assay (BDProbeTec\nET, Becton-Dickinson, Sparks, MD) performed using a urine spec-\nimen collected during the entrance examination. Chlamydia\nscreening has continued since December 2004, and limited Na-\ntional Job Training Program data from 2005 are also available.1\nThe final data included in our review are from the MSM Prev-\nalence Monitoring Project, a surveillance project consisting of data\ncollected from MSM of all ages attending STD clinics located in\n9 US cities. Based on either a urethral swab or urine specimen,\nchlamydia diagnoses are made according to local case definitions\nand locally available test technologies,1 which vary by site. Posi-\ntivity rates are reported, calculated using the same methodology as\ndata from corrections facilities, described earlier.\nData are reported as presented in the original publication; if\navailable, supporting statistics, confidence intervals (CI), ranges,\nand odds ratios (OR) are included.\nResults\nCase Reporting\nthe  , corresponding to a case rate of 161.1 cases per\nIncreases in reported cases among men occurred across all\nAmong racial/ethnic groups, non-Hispanic black men had the\nages) was 717.8, more than 11 times higher than that of non-\nCases among non-Hispanic black men accounted for more than\nhighest case rate across race/ethnic groups and age groups was\nobserved among non-Hispanic black men aged 20 to 24 years\nPrevalence\nGeneral Population.

Chlamydia positivity rates among men\nentering corrections facilities were consistently higher than prev-\nalence estimates for the general US population as identified in\nNHANES and AddHealth. Among young men (aged 12\u00ad20 years)\nentering juvenile corrections facilities in 2005, the median facility-\nspecific chlamydia positivity rate was 6.0% (85 facilities).21 The\nmedian rate was highest among men aged 18 to 20, at 8.7%, and\nthe median rate among 15- to 17-year-old men was 6.7%. Among\nyoung men aged 18 to 20 years entering adult facilities, the\nmedian positivity rate was 8.8% (11 facilities). The median\npositivity decreased slightly to 7.8% among men aged 21 to 25\nto decrease as age increased. Overall, among men entering adult\ncorrections facilities (all ages), the median facility-specific\nchlamydia positivity rate was 4.6% (11 facilities). Over time,\npositivity rates in both juvenile and adult corrections facilities\nhave consistently remained high. Median facility-specific rates\nwere greater than 5% in both types of facilities from 2001 to\nTwo additional sources, the National Job Training Program and\nthe MSM Prevalence Monitoring Project, provided data on more\nspecific groups of men than those described in the earlier data.\nAmong socioeconomically disadvantaged young men (aged 16\u00ad24\nyears) entering into the National Job Training Program, the median\nstate-specific chlamydia prevalence rates have been uniformly\nNational Job Training Program, from July 2003 to December\n2004, was further analyzed.

In 2005, the rate among black MSM attending STD clinics\nwas 7.0%, whereas the positivity rate among both white and\nHispanic MSM was 6.0%.\nDiscussion\nOur summary reveals that the prevalence of chlamydial infec-\ntion among men is substantial, especially in younger age groups,\nracial/ethnic minorities, and the incarcerated population.\nTABLE 1.

Race/ethnicity-specific chlamydia rates among men:\nTABLE 2. Chlamydia Prevalence Among Men, by Race/Ethnicity,\nSelected Populations\nData Source (yrs)\nRace/Ethnicity\nBlack White Hispanic\nNational Job Training Program\nMSM Prevalence Monitoring\nAcross data sources, the burden of chlamydia infection is gen-\nerally greatest among young men aged approximately 20 to 24\nyears. This differs from the epidemiology of chlamydia among\nwomen; the greatest burden among women occurs in a younger\nage group, those 15 to 19 years of age.1 The age difference may be\ndue to partnership characteristics, suggesting that young women's\nsexual partners are often slightly older men, as has been noted in\nprevious studies examining sexual mixing patterns.23 In addition,\nadolescent females may have a higher biologic susceptibility to\nacquiring chlamydia than do adolescent males, because of cervical\nectopy. Overall, the efficiency of C. trachomatis transmission\nduring heterosexual vaginal sex may be greater from men to\nwomen than from women to men.24\nWith the exception of the MSM population, chlamydia infec-\ntions were disproportionately found in black men compared with\nwhite and Hispanic men and in Hispanic men when compared\ndirectly with white men. These disparities were also observed in\nRacial/ethnic disparities also exist for HIV infections; increasingly\nhigh HIV rates among black men have recently been highlighted.26\nDisparities in chlamydia prevalence among women exhibit similar\npatterns and are highest among black women.1,15\u00ad18 Interestingly,\nthere are smaller differences between positivity rates by race/\nethnicity among MSM. This has also been observed in studies of\nother STDs.1\nChlamydia infection is highly prevalent in men entering correc-\ntions facilities, and among men entering the National Job Training\nProgram. Corrections data show that the burden of infection is\nhighest among men aged 18 to 20 years, both in juvenile and adult\nfacilities. However, rates are substantial among men aged 15 to 25\nyears (range 6.7%\u00ad8.8%), suggesting that this high-risk popula-\ntion may be reasonable to target for screening efforts. Other local\ncorrections data also demonstrate a high burden of disease among\nchlamydia case rates per 100,000 men. The increases may be at\nleast partially explained by increasing usage of NAATs,28 which\nare more sensitive than prior test technologies29 and thus may\nidentify more cases. In addition, the increasingly widespread avail-\nability of noninvasive testing by means of collecting urine speci-\nmens has likely led to more men agreeing to chlamydia tests.30\nFinally, case report data are subject to local and state reporting\npractices; although all states have reported chlamydia cases to\nCDC since 2000, reporting practices, rates, and completeness vary.\nAlthough there are possible explanations as to the increase in\nchlamydia case rates among men, a true increase in infection rates\ncannot be ruled out.\nImprovements in test technology and the availability of NAATs\nfor use on urine specimens have led to increased opportunities to\nmore easily test men for chlamydia. With test technology enhance-\nments, more programs are considering creating guidelines and\nimplementing chlamydia screening among men. Some programs\nhave moved forward with this initiative, but locally defined screen-\ning criteria, as well as the screening practices and coverage, vary\nsubstantially (Steven Shapiro, CDC, personal communication).\nAnother means to improve the detection and treatment of chla-\nmydia in men is to improve partner referral practices for women\nwith chlamydia.\nThe data used in our study have several limitations. First, the\ncase report surveillance system is dependent on provider and\nlaboratory reports, and underreporting may be significant. Al-\nthough widespread reporting requirements were adopted in every\nstate by 2000, actual reporting implementation dates and practices\nvary by area. Because of the asymptomatic nature of chlamydial\ninfections, underdetection is also a likely cause of underestimation\nof cases. Second, the prevalence data we present are dependent on\nthe test technology used. Increasingly sensitive tests are better able\nto detect any evidence of infection, resulting in fewer false nega-\ntives and more positives; changes in test technology have been\nassociated with increases in test positivity.31 Third, because of the\nlack of commercially available test technologies (beyond culture)\nthat are Food and Drug Administration-approved to test rectal\nspecimens, rectal chlamydia infections were not often ascertained.\nDespite the limitations, the data used in our summary demon-\nstrate consistent results across a variety of populations. Large\nsample sizes represent different populations, multiple regions of\nthe country, and varying socioeconomic and risk groups. Two of\nour data sources, NHANES and AddHealth, are nationally repre-\nsentative surveys of the US population at large.\nIn summary, our review provides important information on the\nepidemiology of chlamydia among men in the  .\nAlthough generally lower than disease rates among women, prev-\nalence rates among men are consistently substantial. The burden of\nchlamydia among men is most significant in a slightly older age\nhigher among black men. Data presented in this analysis support\nroutine chlamydia screening of young men in corrections settings,\nparticularly adult corrections facilities, and continued screening of\nmen entering the National Job Training Program. Further research\non the impact and cost-effectiveness of additional strategies to\ndetect chlamydia in men should be pursued.\nReferences\n1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
