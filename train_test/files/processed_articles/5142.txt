    "abstract": "Abstract\nObservation stays are an outpatient service used to diagnose and treat patients for extended periods of time while a decision\nis made regarding inpatient admission or discharge. Although the use of observation stays is increasing, little is known about\nwhich patients are observed and which are admitted for similar periods of time as inpatients. The aim was to identify patient\ncharacteristics associated with being observed rather than admitted for a short stay (<48 hours) within the Veterans Health\nAdministration (VHA). In our longitudinal analysis, we used logistic regression within a generalized estimating equation\nframework to model observation stays as a function of patient characteristics, time trends, and hospital fixed effects. To\nminimize heterogeneity between groups, we limit our sample to patients with a presenting diagnosis of chest pain. Our\nanalysis includes a total of 121\n584 hospital events, which consist of all observation and short-stay admissions for chest\npain patients at VHA hospitals between 2005 and 2013. Both the absolute and relative use of observation stays increased\nmarkedly over time. The odds of an observation stay were higher among women, but lower among older patients and\nrural residents. Despite strong evidence that chest pain patients are increasingly more likely to be observed than admitted,\nsuggesting a substitution effect, we find little evidence of within-hospital disparities in VHA observation stay use.\n",

With observation stays, the clinical\nteam must determine a disposition in a finite time (less than\n24 hours during our study period), whereas inpatient stays\nmay be longer. However, unnecessary inpatient admissions\nmay result in short lengths of stay (less than 48 hours) that\ncould be managed under observation status.\nThe effects this decision may have on patients makes it\nimportant to understand which patients get observed and\nwhich get admitted for short stays, particularly as observa-\ntion stays are being used more frequently in various settings.\nobservation stays in fee-for-service Medicare increased by\n26%.2 Similarly, the observation stay rate in the Veterans\nHealth Administration (VHA) more than doubled over the\nlast decade.3 However, it is unclear whether this increase\nrepresents a greater tendency to observe patients who would\nhave been discharged, or a substitute for patients who would\nhave been admitted.\nMoreover, there is a significant variation in observation\nstay use across hospitals in both Medicare and VHA\npopulations.2,3 This variation may be driven by differences\nin the treatment of patients by race, gender, rurality or\nother specific characteristics, or by differences in hospital-\nspecific factors.2,4-13 In the VHA, a number of hospital-level\nfactors have been identified that partially explain the variation\n1The University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA\n2The Comprehensive Access & Delivery Research and Evaluation Center,\nIowa City Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, IA, USA\n3Christiana Care Health System, Wilmington, DE, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nBrad Wright, Department of Health Management and Policy, College of\nPublic Health, The University of Iowa, 145 North Riverside Drive, Iowa\nEmail: brad-wright@uiowa.edu\nin observation stay rates across VHA hospitals, including\nbed size and patient case mix.14 However, to our knowledge,\nno prior studies have explored how patient-level factors may\ninfluence the physician's decision to place a patient in obser-\nvation status. To our knowledge, the VHA does not operate\ndedicated observation units, meaning that for a patient in a\ngiven bed, the decision to classify a veteran as an inpatient or\nplace one in observation status is merely a decision made\nusing a code in the electronic health record, with no distinc-\ntion in the care provided. However, this decision is important\nbecause observation stays are an outpatient service, leading\nto substantially different payments for hospitals and out-of-\npocket costs for beneficiaries. Specifically, observation stays\nsubject the veteran to a $50 copayment, whereas inpatient\nhospitalizations subject the veteran to a $1288 copayment.\nThus, the objectives of this study are to (1) identify patient\ncharacteristics associated with being observed rather than\nadmitted for a short stay (ie, 48 hours or less) and (2) deter-\nmine the extent to which observation stays are being used as\na substitute for short-stay admissions.\nMethods\nFor this study, we used acute admissions and enrollment data\n(Inpatient) files and VHA enrollment files. The inpatient\nfiles contain information on dates of service, diagnoses, pro-\nvider type, and provider location, for all veterans who used\nVHA hospital services in that year. The enrollment files con-\ntain veteran age, race, gender, and dates of enrollment, birth,\nand death, for all enrolled veterans.\nFirst, we identified all observation stays and short-stay\nadmissions (48 hours) in the data. Then, we limited our study\nsample to individuals who had at least 1 observation stay event\nor at least 1 short-stay admission with an initial diagnosis of\nchest pain (to minimize case mix heterogeneity between\ngroups) during a given year. Starting with over 4.4 million\nacute admission records, we excluded approximately 4.3 mil-\nlion records as shown in Figure 1, leaving 123\nduring our 9-year study period. We excluded individuals who\nwere identified as short-stay admissions because they died or\nwere transferred within 48 hours, as these stays might have\notherwise extended beyond 48 hours. Twelve VHA hospitals\nwere excluded from our model because they had no variation\nNext, we generated descriptive statistics by fiscal year\nacross 3 groups of veterans: those with observation stays\nonly, those with short-stay admissions only, and those with\nboth observation stay and short-stay admissions in each year.\nWithin each group, we identified unique individuals by their\nfirst event in each fiscal year, so that descriptive statistics\nwould not be skewed by high utilizers. We used chi-square\ntests to detect differences in categorical variables and the\nWilcoxon rank-sum tests to detect differences in continuous\nvariables between the 3 groups.\nFinally, we used logistic regression within a generalized\nestimating equation (GEE) framework to model placement\nin observation as a function of patient characteristics. Our\ndependent variable was a binary indicator for a hospital visit\nthat was set to 1 if the record was for an observation stay and\n0 if the record represented a short-stay admission. As indi-\nviduals could have multiple hospital events annually, we\naccounted for correlated data within patients using the GEE\nmethod with an exchangeable working correlation structure\nand robust standard errors clustered at the patient level.\nOur key independent variables were patient race/ethnicity\nand rurality of residence, as we aimed to identify racial, eth-\nnic, and/or geographic disparities in observation stay use\nwithin the VHA. We also controlled for other patient charac-\nteristics, including age, gender, homelessness, copayment\nstatus (based on a veteran's income and service connected\ndisability), and the number of comorbid conditions a person\nhad within 1 year of admission, based on International\nClassification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical\nModification algorithms originally developed by Charlson\nand updated by Quan and colleagues.15 To detect time trends\nin observation stay use, we included a series of year dummy\nMissing Gender\nFinal Sample\nMissing Copayment\nCategory\nMissing Rural\nCategory\nMissing Homeless\nStatus\nStarng Sample\nAdmissions\nNot VAMC Admission\nMissing Race\nNot Observaon or\nShort Stay\nIncomplete Data\nDied in Hospital\nTransferred within\nNon-Unique Person\nIdenfier\nPrincipal Dx CCS\nCategory Not Chest Pain\nNo Variaon in\nOutcome of Interest\nFigure 1.

Finally, we included hospital-specific fixed effects\nto capture any time-invariant hospital factors associated with\nobservation stay use. Inclusion of hospital fixed effects in the\nmodel implies that our estimates capture within-hospital\nvariation over time in observation stay use. This study was\napproved by the University of Iowa institutional review\nResults\nDescriptive statistics are shown in Table 1 separating patients\ninto 3 different groups based on the type of qualifying admis-\nsion they had each year. Due to the large sample size, all\ncomparisons between the 3 groups are statistically signifi-\ncant. Although these groups are not randomly assigned, dif-\nferences between groups are generally small, which suggests\nthat veterans with an observation stay, veterans with a short-\nstay admission, and veterans with both types of stays do not\ndiffer substantially from one another.\nThe regression model results are shown in Table 2. Female\ngender was the only patient factor significantly associated\nwith an increase in the odds of being placed in observation\nrather than admitted for a short stay. Specifically, women had\n10% greater odds of being placed in observation than men,\nholding all else constant. By contrast, both residence in an\nisolated rural area and increasing age were significantly\nassociated with a decrease in the odds of being placed in\nobservation. Compared with urban residents, residents of\nisolated rural areas had 10% lower odds of being placed in\nobservation. Relatively large age differences are needed to\nobserve a meaningful change in the odds of observation. For\nexample, a 10-year increase in age is associated with a 4%\ndecrease in the odds of being placed in observation rather\nthan admitted. Notably, other patient characteristics, includ-\ning race/ethnicity, homelessness, copayment status, and\nnumber of comorbid conditions, were not significant predic-\ntors of a patient's likelihood of being placed in observation\nrather than admitted for a short stay.\nThere was a very strong increase in observation stay use\nover time. All else being equal, a veteran presenting with\nchest pain had 14% higher odds of being placed in observa-\ntion rather than admitted for a short stay in 2006 compared\nwith 2005, and this trend continued over the study period.\nthe odds of being observed compared with 2005. Figure 2\nshows the trends in the absolute volume of both observation\nstays and short-stay admissions over the study period.\nAlthough it depicts an increase in observation stays over\nthe entire period, clear evidence of observation stays being\nused as a substitute for short-stay admissions first appears\nthe individual fixed effects for each VHA hospital, these\nwere also jointly significant (P < .0001), indicating that\ntime-invariant unobserved hospital-level characteristics\nalso contribute to a veteran's likelihood of being placed in\nobservation.\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics.\nVariable Observation stay only Short-stay admission only Both\nRurality of residence\nCopayment status\nRace/ethnicity\n \nNote. For all variables, P < .001.\nDiscussion\nWe examined a cohort of chest pain patients to identify patient\ncharacteristics associated with being placed in observation sta-\ntus versus admitted for a short stay (48 hours) while control-\nling for differences between VHA hospitals and the increase in\nobservation stays over time. We also examined the absolute\nvolume of observation stays and short-stay admissions over\ntime to gauge the extent to which the former are being used as\na substitute for the latter. Our results suggest that few observ-\nable patient characteristics are significant predictors of being\nplaced in observation rather than admitted. More importantly,\nwe find little evidence of within-hospital disparities in VHA\nobservation stay use. Finally, we document a striking increase\nin the tendency to place chest pain patients under observation\nrather than admit them for a short stay, which descriptive data\nsuggest is at least partially due to a substitution effect that\nWe identified a difference in observation stay use by gender,\nwhich particularly in the setting of chest pain is likely to reflect\nclinical uncertainty. VHA physicians typically treat fewer\nwomen (eg, women represented fewer than 10% of admissions\nin our study), and thus the 10% increase in likelihood of obser-\nvation may reflect a discomfort in predicting clinical course\ncompared with men. However, women more frequently present\nwith atypical chest pain, and clinicians are more likely to evalu-\nate a woman as having a low pre-test probability of significant\ncoronary artery disease causing the chest pain presentation, in\nwhich case an observation stay is a logical clinical decision\nWe identified a difference in observation stay use between\nurban and rural veterans, but we also hesitate to classify this as\nFigure 2.

CI = confidence interval.\nWright et al 5\na disparity. Veterans from isolated rural areas had 10% lower\nodds of being admitted to observation. One likely explanation\nis that veterans living in rural settings are more likely to live a\nlong distance from a hospital. Thus, they would have a lower\nthreshold for meeting criteria for an inpatient admission, as\nthey would have difficulty accessing care if their condition\ndeteriorated unexpectedly at home. In addition, physicians\ncould recognize that rural patients may have longer hospital-\nizations due to challenges coordinating care on discharge lead-\ning to a preference for inpatient admission. Last, this difference\nmay reflect that urban veterans are more likely to present to\ntheir local VHA hospital for minor complaints associated with\nan observation stay, whereas their rural counterparts, particu-\nlarly those with dual coverage through Medicare, may present\nto a non-VHA hospital for these conditions.\nRegardless of the various personal characteristics that may\ninfluence their likelihood of being placed in observation,\nsome well-informed veterans are likely to have a preference\nfor being placed in observation rather than admitted for a\nshort stay because of the financial implications of that desig-\nnation. A veteran admitted to observation status and paying a\nfull copay would pay approximately 4% of the amount paid\nby a veteran admitted to inpatient status but having a short-\nstay admission.20 Thus, for veterans subject to full copayment\namounts, being placed in observation status is financially\nbeneficial. Although the copayment category variables were\nnot significant in our model, a practice pattern may be emerg-\ning that defaults patients first to observation, with the knowl-\nedge that they will be converted to inpatient status if needed.\nFinally, we found that the largest odds ratios were for the\nyear dummy variables. This, in conjunction with the absolute\nnumber of observation stays and short-stay admissions over\ntime (Figure 2), suggests that, at least for chest pain patients,\nthe previously documented increase in observation stay use\nwithin the VHA over the last decade reflects a shift from\nshort-stay inpatient admissions to observation stays.3 As to\nwhat may be driving this trend, a VHA directive from\nFebruary 2014 notes that \"Mounting concerns about VA\nmedical facility overcrowding and the lack of available beds\nfor patients needing inpatient services have led to the more\nfrequent utilization of observation status and observation\nbeds as an alternative to hospital admission or discharge.\"21\nWhether this substitution has had any clinical impact is\nunknown and warrants further research.\nOur study has several limitations. First, not all veterans\nhad an observation stay or short-stay admission during our\nstudy period. This might have resulted in our sample being\nnon-representative of the overall veteran population. Second,\nthere may be unobserved differences between patients in our\nsample that we are unable to account for using administrative\ndata. However, we minimize this potential heterogeneity by\nlimiting our sample to patients presenting with a chest pain\ndiagnosis. Fortunately, both our descriptive statistics and the\nresults from a prior study found that patients held for obser-\nvation were generally similar to patients with short-stay\nadmissions.22 Third and finally, we are not able to say\nwhether the use of observation or short-stay admissions was\nappropriate for a given patient, which is a question that future\nresearch should address.\nOverall, our results suggest that after controlling for the\nrecent increase in observation stay use across the VHA, and\nthe marked variation in observation stay use between VHA\nhospitals, there are few differences in how observation status\nis used among different patients within the same VHA hospi-\ntal. However, observation stays are increasingly being used\nas a substitute for short-stay admissions among patients pre-\nsenting with a chest pain diagnosis. Identifying which\npatients are placed in observation and which are admitted is\nthe first step in developing clinical protocols and pathways to\naccurately identify which patients are appropriate for obser-\nvation. More research is needed to determine whether there\nare differences in clinical outcomes following observation\nstays versus short-stay admissions.\nAuthors' Note\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not\nnecessarily represent the views of the Department of Veterans\nAffairs.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nwork was funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of\nRural Health.
