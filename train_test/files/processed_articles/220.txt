This study examined whether economic and care obligations for family and kin salience influence retire-\nment decisions and whether such influences differ by race, gender, and marital status.\nData. Data from the first 2 waves of the National Survey of Families and Households were used. The sample con-\nsisted of individuals who were employed at baseline and aged 55\u00ad75 at follow-up (N  897). Cox proportional hazard\nregressions were used.\nResults. Economic kin obligations impeded the likelihood of retiring. Individuals who made financial contributions\nto children outside the household and White women with resident children in the household were less prone to retire.\nAmong Blacks, household composition effects were more complex and seemed to depend on the mix of care obliga-\ntions, financial obligations, and financial contributions by resident kin. Kin salience also impinged on retirement deci-\nsions. Some groups who lacked family ties (e.g., nonmarried childless men) were less inclined to retire, whereas other\nsubgroups (e.g., nonmarried men with monthly pre-retirement contacts with children) were more likely to retire.\nConclusions. Our data suggest the importance of family obligations and relationships in retirement decisions and\ndemonstrate considerable diversity in these processes. Models of retirement should pay greater attention to the interde-\npendence of work and family spheres and to the diversity of retirement processes among various population groups.\nREDICTORS of retirement behavior or labor force\nwithdrawal in the later years are typically derived from\nrational choice models that focus on individuals' own char-\nacteristics (Szinovacz & Ekerdt, 1995) and often rely exclu-\nsively on male samples (Hayward, Friedman, & Chen,\nO'Rand, 1996), we tested a model of retirement decisions\nthat pays tribute to marital and familial contingencies of re-\ntirement processes and cultural embeddedness. Our objec-\ntive was to assess whether selected family obligations and\nrelationships influence retirement decisions and whether\nthese influences differ by gender, race, and marital status.\nWe used data from the National Survey of Families and\nHouseholds (NSFH) for the analyses.\nTheoretical Background\nThe life course perspective emphasizes interdependence\nof life spheres and contextual embeddedness of life transi-\nInterdependence of life spheres means that work and family\nspheres are linked throughout individuals' lives and that life\nexperiences in one domain are connected with experiences\nin the other domain. This interdependence implies that re-\ntirement decisions derive not only from individual circum-\nstances but also from the family situation. Contextual em-\nbeddedness draws attention to individuals' placement in the\nsocial structure. Both work and family experiences differ\namong societal subgroups, and these divergent experiences\nare likely to inform retirement decisions. In line with these\nassumptions, we based our theoretical model on the premise\nthat economic and care obligations for family, as well as sa-\nlience of kin ties, influence retirement decisions. Further-\nmore, we expected that the impact of these family obliga-\ntions and ties would vary by gender, race, and marital status.\nInterlinked life spheres.--Family considerations that\nmay enter retirement decision processes include economic\nfamily demands, care responsibilities that compete with\nwork obligations, and the salience of the family sphere. Past\nresearch has suggested that retirement decisions are driven\nby economic considerations such as benefit eligibility, fi-\nnancial assets, and the expected economic utility of remain-\ning in or leaving the labor force (Burr, Massagli, Mutchler,\ncial obligations for family members can also impinge on re-\ntirement decisions. Individuals with financial obligations\nfor dependents tend to remain in the labor force and adopt\nless positive attitudes toward retirement (Clark, Johnson, &\nFinancial support to family members outside the household\nmay further curtail the feasibility of retiring. Because indi-\nP\nviduals' main financial responsibilities in later life are to-\nward their children, we focused on such obligations. Specif-\nically, we expected a lower probability of retirement among\nindividuals who either have children in the household or fi-\nnancially support children outside the household.\nWomen, especially, often find it difficult to simulta-\nneously attend to family and work obligations (Ferree,\ncompete with work demands during parents' early life and\nmidlife, care obligations for other family members (e.g., ill\nparents or spouses) may take precedence in the later years.\nEarlier research showed effects of care for ill spouses on la-\nbor force withdrawal, but the direction of this effect remains\nligations for kin may impinge on retirement decisions. Pre-\nvious research linking care obligations for ill relatives to\nemployment decisions yielded contradictory evidence\nincluded caregivers at different life stages. For persons who\nare close to or have reached retirement age, withdrawal\nfrom the labor force for caregiving purposes may be more\nfeasible than for younger caregivers. However, care for ill\nrelatives sometimes involves financial costs that may render\nretirement more difficult (Ruhm, 1996). Thus, the overall\nimpact of caregiving on retirement decisions most likely de-\npends on the balance between required care effort and the\nfinancial costs of the care arrangement.\nPast research has demonstrated the viability of disposi-\ntion factors for retirement decisions. Individuals' propensity\nto retire has been linked to work commitment, workplace at-\ntributes, and perceived benefits and costs of retirement for\npersonal or marital pursuits (George, Fillenbaum, & Pal-\nTaylor & Shore, 1995). Family ties may influence disposi-\ntion toward retirement as well. Employment curtails how\nmuch time individuals can devote to family activities, but it\nalso offers chances for social contacts and self-fulfillment\noutside the family context. We expected that salient kin ties\nwould motivate individuals to retire, especially if their work\nobligations precluded frequent kin interactions. On the other\nhand, individuals lacking salient family ties may be less in-\nclined to retire anticipating that withdrawal from the labor\nforce will curtail opportunities for social and personal ful-\nfillment.\nContextual embeddedness.--Family ties and obliga-\ntions differ among diverse subpopulation groups. Most im-\nportant among these are variations by gender, race, and\nmarital status.\nAlthough men continue to be viewed as main economic\nproviders, women carry major responsibility for noneco-\nnomic family responsibilities and the management of kin re-\nLawton, & Bengtson, 1994). This gender difference is likely\nto influence how kin obligations and relationships affect\nmen's and women's retirement decisions. We expected that\nmen's retirement decisions would reflect financial kin obli-\nBeehr, 1995), whereas care obligations and salience of kin\nties would be more influential for women's retirement deci-\nsions.\nIn view of data limitations (the small number of ethnic\nminorities other than African Americans), we were able to\nassess differences between Whites and Blacks only. Many\nstudies have indicated that the kin networks of African\nAmericans are particularly close and characterized by mu-\ntual economic and support exchanges, within and often\nacross households (Chatters & Jayakody, 1995; Scott &\nBlack, 1994). Furthermore, African American kinship net-\nworks seem to be matrifocal, that is, organized through fe-\nmale kinship ties (Scott & Black, 1994). We therefore ex-\npected a stronger influence of family obligations and\nrelationships for Blacks than for Whites and that this rela-\ntionship would prevail among women.\nBecause kin relationships are typically managed by\nwomen, men's access to kin is often mediated through their\nunmarried men sometimes lack close kin ties (Cooney &\nwomen rarely lose contact with kin, they may develop a\nstrong commitment to their work and the social contacts\nsuch employment affords, and they often lack financial re-\nsources (O'Rand, 1996). Consequently, we expected kin ob-\nligations and relationships to have a stronger impact on\nmarried than on nonmarried individuals' retirement.\nMETHODS\nSample\nWe used data from the National Survey of Families and\nThe NSFH is a multistage area probability sample consist-\ning of 13,008 respondents at Time 1 (for a detailed descrip-\ntion of the study, see Sweet, Bumpass, & Call, 1988).\nWeights adjust for nonresponses to the survey at Time 1 and\nattrition between waves.\nBecause labor force withdrawal and self-definitions of re-\ntirement can diverge (Ekerdt & DeViney, 1990; Flippen &\nMutchler, Burr, Pienta, & Massagli, 1997; Szinovacz &\nDeViney, 1999), we relied on a subsample that consisted of\nrespondents at \"risk\" of retirement and excluded individuals\nwho were looking for a job and those whose retirement was\nambiguous (i.e., who left the labor force but self-defined as\nnot retired or who were employed and self-defined as re-\ntiree). We considered individuals at risk of retirement if\nthey were employed 20 h/week or more at Time 1 and aged\neliminate individuals engaged in sporadic employment ac-\ntivities. These criteria led to exclusion of 13% of cases. Sen-\nsitivity analyses (comparison of results based on different\nsample specifications) indicated that effects of the family\nvariables considered in our analyses were unaffected by\nsample selection. Because of these exclusions, our findings\npertain to retirement and may not be applicable to displaced\nworkers or to persons with sporadic employment.\nMissing cases may lead to biased results, especially when\ncases are not missing completely at random, as was the case\nfor our data (Little's MCAR test p  .001; Little & Rubin,\n1987). To avoid such bias, we created nine complete-case\ndata sets using the imputation regression method provided\nby SPSS (SPSS, 1997). The results were based on multiple\nimputation inference using NORM (Schafer, 1997). Com-\nparison of results derived from the imputation regressions\nwith those we obtained using expectation-maximization im-\nputation suggested that imputation method did not alter\nfindings.\nDependent Variable\nThe dependent variable was time to exit from the labor\nforce, measured in months, from Wave 1 to the date the re-\nspondent stopped working. If he or she did not retire, time\nwas measured from the Wave 1 to the Wave 2 interview. A\ndummy variable for stopped working was used as right-\nhand censuring variable. In our weighted sample, 35% of\nrespondents retired between waves.\nFamily Obligations and Relationships\nPresence of children in the household served as an indica-\ntor of financial obligations. It was derived from household\nrosters and was captured by two dummy variables--those\nwith one child and those with more than one child in the\nhousehold. Those without children in the household served\nas reference. We also constructed other measures of chil-\ndren's presence in the household (by children's gender and\nage). Results pertaining to these measures are not shown in\nthe tables but are addressed in the text.\nAt baseline respondents were asked whether they or their\nspouse regularly provided financial assistance to children\naged 19 or more. Respondents indicated each child to whom\nsuch assistance was given. Because very few respondents fi-\nnancially supported more than one or two children, we cre-\nated a dichotomous measure (1  \"financial assistance\ngiven,\" 0  \"no financial assistance given\").\nCare obligations were based on questions about whether\nand for whom respondents provided care inside the house-\nhold and on questions pertaining to spouse's health. We\nconstructed two dichotomous measures, differentiating be-\ntween care for spouses and care for other family members.\nSpousal care was coded 1 for respondents who reported that\nthey cared for a disabled spouse in the household or whose\nspouses indicated that they either had limitations in activi-\nties of daily living or that their health was poor or very poor.\nCare for other family members was derived from questions\nabout respondents' care obligations. Those providing care\nwere coded 1. Note that care for spouses and other family\nmembers could overlap although this was very rare.\nWe relied on three indicators to assess salience of kin\nties: whether respondents had children, whether their par-\nents were still alive, and the frequency of contacts with chil-\ndren outside the household. Childlessness and both parents'\ndeaths (1  \"yes,\" 0  \"no\") were both represented as di-\nchotomous variables. The NSFH contains questions about\nfrequency of face-to-face contacts (\"How often do you\nsee . . . \") with each adult child outside the household (1 \n\"not at all,\" 6  \"several times a week\"). We constructed\ntwo dummy variables: respondents reporting at least weekly\nvisits with any child and those reporting fewer than weekly\nbut at least monthly visits (1  \"has weekly visits,\" 1 \n\"has monthly visits\"). Respondents who saw their children\nless frequently (several times a year or less) served as refer-\nence category.\nControls\nNumerous studies (for reviews, see Beehr, 1986; Feld-\nonstrated that retirement decisions are influenced by the\neconomic feasibility of retiring (i.e., whether continued em-\nployment is economically necessary or beneficial), barriers\nto continued employment (illness, job displacement), and\ndisposition toward retirement (psychological and social\nbenefits and costs of leaving the labor force). The NSFH\ncontains some indicators for each of these domains but\nlacks detailed information on pension eligibility and antici-\npated pension wealth. Because pension eligibility and\nwealth tend to be closely associated with industry (core ver-\nsus periphery), occupational characteristics, and work his-\nMaclean, 1986), we initially performed models that in-\ncluded indicators for core and periphery industry, major\nCensus occupation groups (managerial, technical, service,\nfarm, crafts, labor), earnings, work hours, years in the labor\nforce, and nonwage income and savings in addition to the\nwork and economic variables maintained in the models and\ndescribed later. These variables had no significant effect on\nlikelihood of retirement in our models, and their inclusion\nor exclusion did not influence the effect of the family vari-\nables. We consequently dropped them from the final analy-\nses to enhance parsimony and reduce potential multicol-\nlinearity. It is, of course, conceivable that other variables\nnot contained in the NSFH (e.g., pension eligibility and\nwealth) may alter the impact of the family variables consid-\nered here.\nIndividuals' economic ability to leave the labor force was\ncaptured by indicators of benefit eligibility, socioeconomic\nstatus, and variables related to employment history. The\nNSFH does not contain direct measures of Social Security\neligibility. Instead, we employed age categories (60\u00ad61, 62\u00ad\nConcerning pensions, NSFH respondents reported whether\nthey were enrolled in a pension plan and whether they ex-\npected to or were then receiving a pension. The wording of\nthe last two items is such that it was impossible to distin-\nguish individuals who had reached pension eligibility but\ndeferred their claims from those who had not reached eligi-\nbility. However, we could distinguish persons who were en-\nrolled in pension plans from those who were not (1  \"no\npension\").\nIn addition to benefit eligibility, we included indicators of\nwork context and employment history. Occupational pres-\ntige influences work commitment (Hayward et al., 1998)\nand also helps define pension eligibility (DeViney, 1995;\nO'Rand, 1996). Occupational prestige was obtained from\ndescriptions of respondents' current or most recent job and\nwas based on Stevens and Cho's (1985) recoding of the\n1980 Census occupational classification scheme. In view of\nthe restricted pension measure and reference to current\nrather than main career job, we further included several\nwork context variables that may help distinguish individuals\nin bridge jobs from those who were still in their main career\njob at Time 1. These variables were work disruptions between\nwaves (but prior to retirement if it occurred) and self-employ-\nment. The measure of work disruptions relied on detailed\nwork histories and was coded as a dichotomous variable (1 \n\"did disrupt employment\"). Self-employment was based on\nwhether respondents derived income from self-employment\n(1  \"yes\"). Because spouse's earnings or pensions contrib-\nute to an individual's economic situation and have previ-\nously been linked to retirement decisions (Anderson, Clark,\ntors for spouses' employment (1  \"employed at Time 1\")\nand enrollment in a pension plan (1  \"yes\") to our models.\nHealth in general and disability in particular exert a\nstrong influence on people's decisions to remain in the labor\nforce (Bound, Schoenbaum, & Waidmann, 1995; Burr et al.,\nreported health was measured with the question: \"Com-\npared to other people your age, how would you describe\nyour health?\" (1  \"very poor,\" 5  \"excellent\"). Disability\nwas measured by reporting of health problems that limit\nemployment (1  \"yes\"). Some individuals may have en-\ncountered health problems between waves. We could not date\nsuch changes, and their inclusion as a predictor of retirement\nwould hence be problematic. However, we tested whether\ninclusion of change in health between waves affected the in-\nfluence of the family variables and found no effect.\nPast research has further suggested that individuals' work\ncommitment may motivate them to remain in the labor force\nsured with an indicator of job dissatisfaction. Respondents\nwere asked if they agreed or disagreed with the following\nstatement: \"The job I do is one of the most satisfying parts\nof my life\" (1  \"strongly agree,\" 5  \"strongly disagree\").\nBackground\nBackground characteristics were marital status (1  \"not\nmarried\"), race (two dummy variables, one for Blacks and\none for all other minorities; White was the reference cate-\ngory), and gender (1  \"female\"). Some individuals' mari-\ntal status changed between waves. However, inclusion of\nsuch changes had no effect on the influence of the family\nvariables. We assessed all independent variables except age\nat baseline to ensure accurate causal attributions. Means and\nstandard deviations of the independent variables are shown\nin Table 1.\nData Analyses\nCox proportional hazard regressions were used for the\ntional hazard models (often called event history analysis)\nare a statistical method for the analysis of duration or sur-\nvival data. Cox models allow for censored data--that is, not\nall events (e.g., retirement) need to occur for all persons--\nand account both for the occurrence of an event (retirement)\nand when it occurred (time of retirement for those who re-\ntired). In Table 2 we present hazard ratios (the exponenti-\nated regression coefficient). A ratio greater than 1 means\nthat a predictor increases the chance of retirement, and a ra-\ntio less than 1 denotes a decreased chance of retirement.\nThe analyses proceeded in three steps. We first estimated\na model that included all variables other than family obliga-\ntions and relationships (Model 1 in Table 2). The second\nmodel added family obligations and relationships (Model\n2). We then tested (Models 3\u00ad5) systematically for interac-\ntions (Aiken & West, 1991) between the family variables\nand gender, race, and marital status, starting with three-way\ninteractions (either Gender  Race  Family Variable or\nGender     Family Variable). We had too\nfew cases to test for Race    interactions or\nfor higher order interaction terms. We tested interaction\nterms with each family variable in separate models to limit\nmulticollinearity. If the three-way interaction was not sig-\nnificant, we then tested (again in separate models) for lower\norder interactions (e.g., Gender  Family Variable, Race \nFamily Variable). Because higher interaction terms are of-\nten difficult to interpret from mere examination of the re-\ngression coefficients, we further calculated linear predic-\ntions from the estimated models for the pertinent subgroups.\nTable 1.

The NSFH Wave 2 weights accounted for over-\nsamples, nonresponses at baseline, and attrition. Use of\nweights, in combination with robust estimates of variance\nspecifically designed for complex samples, allows adjust-\nment for dependency within the primary sampling units in\nthe NSFH and for stratification (Stata, 1999). Variance in-\nflation tests (Fox, 1991) suggested that multicollinearity\nwas not a problem in our analyses.\nRESULTS\nResults from the proportional hazard regressions are pre-\nsented in Table 2. The first model presented in the table in-\ncludes exclusively individual characteristics, Model 2 adds\nfamily variables, and Models 3\u00ad5 add significant interaction\nterms. Because our main interest was in family variables,\nthe discussion focuses on results pertaining to these vari-\nables. The inclusion of family obligations and relationships\ncontributed significantly to model fit as indicated by com-\nparisons of fit statistics for the individual and family model\nTable 2.

This finding supported our main\nassumption that family experiences contribute to retirement\ndecisions. The only significant main effect, however, was\nthat persons providing financial help to children outside the\nhousehold were less prone to retire (Table 2, Model 2). This\ntrend seemed to hold across subpopulations (i.e., there were\nno significant interactions).\nAlthough only one main effect emerged, several interac-\ntion effects were detected. The effect of children in the\nhousehold differed by race and gender (see Table 2, Model\n3). Black women with one child in the household were more\nlikely to retire, whereas White women and Black men with\none child in the household were less inclined to retire. Addi-\ntional analyses (not shown) further revealed that Blacks (re-\ngardless of gender) with two or more children in the house-\nhold demonstrated a particularly high propensity toward\nretirement. Although the latter interaction by race was sig-\nnificant (b  1.23, p  .01), inclusion of this interaction\nterm did not contribute to model fit.\nBecause care obligations for ill relatives (other than\nspouses) inside the household were quite rare, we could\nonly test for simple interactions (by gender, race, marital\nstatus). Nonetheless, the data (not shown) suggested that ef-\nfects of care inside the household varied by race. Blacks\nshowed a decreased tendency to retire when they had care\nobligations for relatives inside the household (interaction b \n1.56, p  .05). However, inclusion of this interaction term\ndid not contribute to model fit.\nAn interaction effect involving childlessness, gender, and\nmarital status was also identified (Table 2, Model 4).\nWomen with children were more prone to retire, whereas\nchildless married women and childless nonmarried men\nwere less inclined to retire. Similarly, there were interaction\neffects comprising contacts with children, gender, and mari-\ntal status (Table 2, Model 5). Men who did not have weekly\ncontacts with their children were more and women lacking\nweekly contacts with children were less likely to retire. Fur-\nthermore, nonmarried men with monthly contacts were par-\nticularly prone to retire, whereas women (regardless of mar-\nital status) and nonmarried men who did not see their\nchildren on a monthly basis were less inclined to retire.\nDISCUSSION\nOur main objective in this study was to investigate\nwhether family obligations and relationships relate to retire-\nment decisions and whether such relationships differ by\ngender, race, or marital status. Our results suggest the im-\nportance of family obligations and ties for retirement deci-\nsions, as indicated by the substantial enhancement in model\nfit when family variables are added to individual predictors\nof retirement. Specifically, individuals with financial re-\nsponsibility for children are less likely to retire. This could\nsuggest that continued financial liabilities, even for adult\nchildren who have left the household, may render retirement\neconomically more difficult. It is also possible, however,\nthat respondents who do not plan to retire within the fore-\nseeable future are more willing than those with more imme-\ndiate retirement plans to provide financial supports to chil-\ndren. This finding is compatible with a life course\nperspective, which emphasizes the interconnection of work\nand family spheres (Moen, 1996; Szinovacz & Ekerdt,\n1995) and suggests that individual-oriented models of re-\ntirement processes are incomplete.\nThere also is evidence for gender, race, and marital status\nvariations in the influence of selected family variables, con-\nfirming the diversity of retirement processes across popula-\ncifically, Black women with one child in the household tend\ntoward retirement, whereas White women and Black men\nwith one child in the household are less prone to retire. Ad-\nditional findings (not shown) further reveal that household\ncomposition effects may differ by co-resident children's\ngender and age. Because gender, age, and number of chil-\ndren in the household correlate, we cannot determine which\nof these factors is most relevant. The complexity of the\nhousehold composition effects suggests that children's pres-\nence in the household reflects a variety of conditions with\ndiverse consequences for retirement decisions. It can imply\nan economic liability but may also denote care obligations\n(for younger or disabled children and, perhaps, co-resident\ngrandchildren) or even economic help from children to par-\nents. Clearly, more research is needed to unravel the mean-\ning of household composition for retirement decisions.\nThere is little support for our assumption that care for ill\nspouses or other disabled family members relates to retire-\nment decisions. This finding needs to be viewed with some\ncaution. Other analyses based exclusively on NSFH couples\nhave suggested that men with care responsibilities for their\nwives are more prone to retire (Szinovacz & DeViney,\n2000). As far as care for other family members is con-\ncerned, our analyses are seriously restricted by the small\nnumber of caregivers in the sample and the lack of informa-\ntion on extent of care responsibility. These limitations may\nalso account for contradictory findings concerning the im-\npact of caregiving on employment in previous studies\ncare may involve financial costs, thus hindering rather than\npromoting withdrawal from the labor force, and these ef-\nfects may cancel each other out.\nSalience of family ties seems to play some role in retire-\nment decisions. Effects are most pronounced for ties to chil-\ndren, most likely due to individuals' greater stake in rela-\ntionships with their offspring than with other kin (Giarrusso,\nStallings, & Bengtson, 1995). Once again, these influences\nseem to be subgroup-specific. Effects of childlessness differ\nby gender and marital status. That nonmarried childless men\nare particularly unlikely to retire is in line with our expecta-\ntion that lack of salient family ties may induce individuals\nto remain in the labor force. Of course, childlessness could\nitself derive from very high work demands or, alternatively,\nlong-term exposure to marginal economic positions that re-\nduce retirement benefits and hence options for voluntary\nearlier retirement (Hayward et al., 1998). Childless married\nwomen may be particularly career oriented and conse-\nquently inclined to postpone their retirement. Thus, lack of\nsalient family ties could influence retirement decisions ei-\nther through its direct impact on disposition toward retire-\nment or through its association with and reflection of career\nopportunities and decisions over the life course.\nThere also is some support for our contention that fre-\nquency of contacts with children relates to retirement deci-\nsions. The reduced likelihood of retirement among nonmar-\nried men who have no monthly contacts with children may\nagain be indicative of this group's special situation both in\nregard to kin salience and work history. Similarly, women\nwho lack weekly or monthly contacts with children are less\ninclined to leave the labor force. These women may be\nfaced with undue barriers (e.g., geographical distance, es-\ntrangement) to enhance contacts after retiring and thus be\nless disposed toward retirement. On the other hand, some\nmen (those who do not have weekly contacts with children\nand unmarried men with monthly contacts) may see in re-\ntirement an opportunity to catch up with their children.\nTaken together, our analyses suggest that kin relations\nplay a role in retirement decisions. However, data limita-\ntions and the complexity of findings (especially subgroup\ndifferences) preclude unambiguous causal interpretations.\nSpecifically, the relatively small sample size for the present\nanalyses and consequently small cell frequencies for se-\nlected subgroups render testing of interactions difficult.\nMultiple hypothesis testing involving the search for signifi-\ncant interactions can result in Type I error. Although we re-\nstricted our interpretation to interactions that significantly\ncontributed to model fit, the potential for such error cannot\nbe fully discarded. In addition, the NSFH lacks information\non several established predictors of retirement, especially\npension eligibility and wealth. Although we find that inclu-\nsion of pension-related variables in the models does not al-\nter results pertaining to the family variables, better indica-\ntors for the potential economic consequences of retirement\nmay be related to and modify effects of family variables on\nretirement decisions. The intersection of work and family\nspheres over the life span also may evolve into distinct pre-\nretirement conditions that can either deter or promote labor\nforce withdrawal. Future research should address these lim-\nitations. Furthermore, detailed measures of family eco-\nnomic liabilities, care responsibilities, and fulfillment of\ncontact needs with close relatives are necessary for re-\nsearchers to adequately assess family influences on retire-\nment processes. It may also be useful for researchers to in-\nvestigate economic transfers from relatives as possible\nanticipated sources of retirement income. Especially under-\nprivileged populations still rely to some extent on family\nstrategies to secure old age economic well-being, as was the\ncase prior to the establishment of Social Security (Haber &\nDespite these caveats, our findings have implications for\nretirement research and policy. They provide evidence that\ninclusion of both marital and family characteristics in retire-\nment models can help enhance model specification. It is im-\nportant to note, however, that addition of family variables\nhas no impact on the effects of other variables typically con-\nsidered in retirement models. Thus, models excluding mari-\ntal and family variables are not misspecified but incom-\nplete; that is, additional refinement of retirement models can\nbe achieved through inclusion of marital and family charac-\nteristics. Similarly, our findings underline the need for\ngreater "
