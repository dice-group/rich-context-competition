One wonders whether\nthe public actually profits from such pictorial information, since the space behind one's back does\nnot exist in visual awareness. In an experiment, a test image included six persons located at the\ncorners of an irregular hexagon centred at the camera. Two persons faced the camera, two turned\ntheir back to the camera and two others faced a direction at right angles to the camera. The\ndistances to the camera were unequal and varied from 1 to 2 m. Participants were asked to draw a\nground plan of the perceived configuration, including actors and camera, on the basis of viewing\nthe picture. As with any picture there exist many possible interpretations, the ambiguity grows\neven more when the angular scope of the picture is unknown. Almost all nai\n\u00a8ve viewers parse this\nplanispheric (Mercator) representation so as to have the whole scene in front of them, with the\nactors standing in a circle, facing each other. They take the viewpoint to be outside the circle. Only\na few placed the viewpoint inside the circle, which is indeed another reasonable interpretation\n(in this case the actual one).\n",

This\nhappens even when interactive panning is available. In popular `rolling ball' dynamic,\ninteractive renderings one routinely confuses the interior and exterior orientations\n(Koenderink & van Doorn, in press). The problems are due to a lack of intuitive grasp of\nthe topology, the fact that the horizon is a closed curve and that the viewing sphere is viewed\nfrom the inside, whereas rolling ball graphics show the outside.\nOne might say that the full horizon is a `magic circle' that \u00ad in depictions \u00ad cannot be\nentered by the observer (Buckland, 2002). Something similar applies to the full viewing\nsphere. In this contribution we explore that notion in more \u00ad also quantitative \u00ad detail.\nIn this article, the emphasis is on static images of the familiar `postcard' variety, that is,\nroughly A5-size viewed informally at normal reading distance. The most popular static\nrepresentations are cylindrical projections with the horizon represented as a (straight)\nhorizontal line. Various cylindrical projections, in which the verticals are rendered as\nvertical straight lines, are in common use. In this experiment the Mercator representation,\na planispheric, conformal map is used (Mercator, 1569). Its conformal property is nice whereas\nglobal deformations are limited if the elevations are not too close to either zenith or nadir.1\nSuch a cylindrical full-horizon rendering yields a rectangular picture. Its aspect ratio\ndepends on the range of elevations. So we skip two `polar-caps' centred at zenith and\nnadir. In practice, we decided on a desired aspect ratio (postcard format) and let that\nconstrain the extreme elevations. At first blush such a picture appears as a regular postcard.\nIn previous experiments (Koenderink & van Doorn, 2017, in press) we showed that human\nvisual awareness is simply unable to deal with such renderings. In these experiments we tried\nhard to make the visual task as simple as possible for the observers. In contradistinction, in\nthe present experiment we intentionally set up a spatial configuration in such a way as to\n`fool' the observer: By having the pictorial content conform to a familiar scene we enforce the\n`generic postcard' situational awareness and thus silently suggest an inappropriate scope. It is\nindeed not hard to design spatial configurations that will almost certainly be perceived in\nsome specific manner by the overwhelming majority of nai\u00a8ve observers. This is just intuition;\nthere is no science of the matter. This ability might well find applications in \u00ad for instance \u00ad\nthe movie business.\nWell-documented misinterpretations (Koenderink, van Doorn et al., 2010; Koenderink &\nvan Doorn, 2017) are due to the fact that a postcard type of image is routinely interpreted as\nthe rendering of a `normal' field of view, roughly spanning 40 to 80. In the case of regular\nphotographs the actual field of view may range from a few degrees (`tele' shots) up to 150\n(extreme `wide-angle') view. Observers typically do not know the actual field of view and\ninterpret any image in terms of their implicit `normal' view (Koenderink, van Doorn et al.,\n2010), sometimes leading to apparent `deformations' seen in perfect perspective renderings\nIn the case of extremely panoramic (horizontal field of view exceeding 180) images there is\nan additional complication in that they contain content that would be behind the observer's\nback. In generic visual awareness the space behind the back does not exist in a visual sense\n(Phillips & Voshell, 2009). We have already shown that this yields completely novel types of\ncharacteristic errors in pictorial perception (Koenderink & van Doorn, 2017) that go beyond\nthe usual `Ames room-type' (Ittleson, 1952) effects.\nThe effects can often be predicted at least semiquantitatively from simple models of the\nstructure of visual space, as we have shown for extreme wide-angle views (Koenderink, van\nDoorn et al., 2010). To extend this to cases that include the space behind the back is such an\nextreme extrapolation as to be a shot in the dark. As we show here, it actually works quite\nwell. Since most readers will be unfamiliar with the log-polar visual space model (Koenderink\n& van Doorn, 2008), we succinctly summarise the basics in the following.\nMethods\nThe aim was to design a spatial configuration in such a way that nai\u00a8ve observers would be\ngrossly deceived in their `reading' of the picture. We aim at categorical mistakes, rather than\nmere (even if large) quantitative errors. The aim was to produce a planispherical map that\ncould readily be confused with a regular photograph showing a `normal' scope of 40 to 80\nDesign of the Configuration\nOne would like to apply the Ames room technique (Ittleson, 1952) to create optically\nequivalent configurations. However, in the case of full-horizon renderings this is evidently\nnot possible, because the Ames room technique conserves the identity of `visual rays' and\nmerely shifts positions on these rays. For the present application one also needs to change the\nvisual directions. This can be done using a general model of visual space (Koenderink & van\nWe have shown the power of this model for the case of extreme wide-angle (e.g., fish-eye lens)\nviews (Koenderink, van Doorn et al., 2010; Koenderink & van Doorn, 2017). Effects are huge,\nobservers committing misjudgements of the spatial attitude of pictorial objects exceeding 100.\n(Perhaps surprisingly, the misjudgements are as extreme as that, although the textbooks do not\nmention them.) This still applies to the space in front of the camera though.\nHere we go categorically beyond that, including the space `behind the camera'. There exist\nno observations on such cases, so we are in no position to predict how this will work out.\nThe difference is indeed categorical because human observers are physiologically limited to\nthe optical space in front of them (Helmholtz, 1896). Going beyond that even introduces\nchanges of a topological nature, so all bets are off. We aim at a design that might be\ninterpreted in two, mutually very different, ways: In one interpretation, the camera is at\nthe centre of a group of people and in the other interpretation, the camera is outside the\ngroup. The mutual spatial attitudes in the two interpretations are also very different. Here is\nthe design:\nConsider a group of six persons facing each other, positioned on the vertices of a regular\nhexagon. In the case of a `normal' photograph, the camera will be outside the hexagon.\nUsually, the distance of the camera to the group will be large with respect to the diameter\nof the hexagon, on an axis of bilateral symmetry, with three persons on each side of the main\ncamera direction. Then, two persons will roughly face the camera, two will turn their back to\nthe camera and two will be seen in profile, facing the camera axis. The persons facing the\ncamera will be at the largest, those turning their backs to the camera at the shortest and those\nseen in profile at some intermediate distance from the camera.\nKoenderink et al. 3\nFor a full 360 panoramic view, one obtains a configuration in the ground plan shown in\nFigure 1 left. (Figure 1 right shows two areas defined by the points of the hexagonal\nconfiguration that will be discussed later in the article.) We picked a minimum distance of\n1 m in order to obtain an angular height of about 60, roughly equal to the spacing along the\nhorizon. In Mercator projection, this will then yield a reasonable (postcard variety) aspect\nratio.\nIn Figure 2 we show a simulation on a regular tiled floor with square tilings in Mercator\nprojection, thus fully exhibiting the actual layout. Yet, what we see (as colleagues that were\nshown the image) is a group of actors arranged in a circle, facing each other. This suggests\nthat observers are generally unable to make good use of such images, even if they know what\nthey are looking at. We already know that from experience with full-horizon images in\nvarious settings (urban scenes, natural landscapes and indoor scenes). Given the growing\nuse of full-horizon images, it is important to gain some notion as to the degree of veridicality\nof their immediate impressions.\nIn this report we test an actual image on a large number of observers. This allows us to\narrive at expectations of the kind of configuration observers are likely to report. Such\nexpectations depend on two generic principles, namely: firstly, the spatial attitude of visual\nFigure 1. Left: Ground plan for the photograph used in the experiment. The camera is at the central orange\ndisk. Notice that the actors are at distances of either 1 m, 141 cm (\nffiffiffi\np\nm) or 2 m from the camera, in\ndirections at 60 intervals. The formal `frontal' direction has been added for easy reference. Right: Here the\ncamera position is the white point, the points of the hexagonal configuration are indicated with the brown\npoints. The boundary of the orange region is an ellipse passing through the points, the boundary of the blue\nregion (to be discussed in detail later) also passes through the points. The camera is inside the orange region,\nbut outside the blue region. This is the topological relation that we are addressing in this study. The two\nregions are related through a remapping of visual directions, they are optically fully equivalent interpretations.\nEither region is an okay interpretation of the picture.\nobjects is judged with respect to the local line of sight, and secondly, depicted scenes are taken\nto be located in a half-space in front of the viewpoint. The scene designed here can be\ninterpreted in an infinity of ways, although two might be termed `cardinal'. In a later\nsection these cardinal views are compared in some detail. In the experiment we attempt to\nquantify the probability of obtaining one or the other cardinal view. As argued earlier, we\nexpressly set up the scene to suggest one of these. The depiction of the full-horizon scene is\ntypical for the images that are already widely used by the general public.\nThe configuration was set out in the Leuven city park. The locations of the actors were\npreviously constructed with the help of a measuring tape and indicated by hammering tent\npegs in the ground.\nIn Figure 3, it is shown what was in front and what at the back of the camera. Here the\n`frontal direction' has only a formal meaning (indicated in Figure 1 left), since the camera\nitself has no preferred `viewing direction' but is fully isotropic. The stereographic projections\neach show a full half-space. Notice that their (circular) outlines coincide.\nThe photograph destined to be used as the stimulus was taken with a Ricoh Theta S\npanoramic camera from roughly average navel or breast-height. Thus the horizon will\nroughly bisect the vertical extent of the figures, which is desirable in order to balance the\nmagnification increase with visual height of the Mercator projection.\nThe camera was remote controlled by means of an iPhone, so the photographer does not\nappear in the photograph. The Mercator map (see Figure 4) was computed by way of a\nsimple program written in Processing 3. It can hardly be distinguished from the raw camera\nimage (an equirectangular map).\nFigure 2. An artificial scene. The `actors' (mutually identical Daruma dolls) are placed on an infinite floor\nwith regular square tiling. By noticing the vanishing points of the grout lines at the horizon, you easily figure\nout the extent of the field of view. By following the curved grout lines (which are actually straight lines), you\nmay figure out the actual orientation of the figures with respect to each other. One should be able to work\nout the actual layout, all the necessary cues are explicitly present. Few observers can do this a prima vista\nthough.\nKoenderink et al. 5\nDefinition of coordinates and angles. The geometry of the experiment is sufficiently complex that\nit may be confusing for most, thus we clarify some definitions. The reader is invited to use\nFigure 5 as a reference.\nThe figure at top left shows the definition of the azimuth, the figure at top right shows an\nidealised response in which the azimuths and distance ratios are veridical and the figure at\nbottom shows the definition of the gaze angles. In the figure at top right we also indicate\nindices for the locations, which often come in handy in discussion.\nJust for exercise, in the figure at top left, the gaze angles for Indexes 1 to 6 are\nDesign of the Experiment\nIn the final experiment, observers were handed a piece of A4 paper (see Figure 6) in portrait\norientation with the Mercator map as shown in Figure 4 printed in the upper half. They could\nfill in their personal data (name, age, gender and date) on a line at top. The lower half had an\noutlined, square, empty area with the instructions in the right margin. No further instruction\nwas provided.\nAll analysis was done on the basis of the drawings, a typical one being shown in the\ndrawing area of Figure 6. These drawings were digitised by hand using a program\nspecially written for the occasion. The centres of gravity of the person marks and the\ncamera marks were judged by eye.\nObservers\nObservers were students and staff at the institutes of experimental psychology of\nthe universities of Leuven and Giessen. Median age was 32 and interquartile range was\nFigure 3. A stereographic map of what is `in front' (left) and what is `at the back' (right) of the camera. The\nscene layout is shown in Figure 1 left.

Like the Mercator map, the stereographic map is\nconformal, but not area true.\n27 to 37. The gender ratio was 39% female. A total of 61 persons participated in the\nexperiment, 24 from Leuven and 37 from Giessen.\nObservations\nParticipants had no conceptual problems with the task. As expected, no one asked what the\nfield of view was. (If anyone had done so we would have offered that information.) Problems\nthat occasionally occurred were due to the familiar fact that people often underestimate the\nfinal size of their drawing, thus finding themselves short of free space at some phase in the\nprocess. When the camera was drawn outside the frame, this was considered acceptable.\nIn cases where they inquired in retrospect whether they were `right', they often had trouble\nto make sense of the physical ground plan and to relate it to the picture. Even after `knowing\nthe solution', no one could intuitively `see' it. Quite a few even failed to understand the\n`solution' at all. This lack of ability to `see' the actual configuration also holds true for the\nauthors: Although we obviously know exactly what the actual scene was like, we can only\nrelate that to the picture in reflective thought, using geometrical and logical reasoning, we\ncannot spontaneously see it. In that respect it is similar to the classical geometrical illusions,\nwhere knowing the actual geometry does in no way help to get rid of the illusion.\nFigure 4. The photograph used as stimulus in the experiment. The ground plan of the physical configuration\nis shown in Figure 1 left. The projection is Mercator, with the horizon at the half-height of the picture. Notice\nthat the actors are equally spaced on the horizon. The pictorial vertical extent of the actors varies by about a\nfactor of two (the persons were not of exactly the same size). The actors are seen in either anterior,\nposterior or lateral (profile) view. The location of the feet is another cue to distance: since the terrain was\nroughly horizontal, higher in the picture plane indicates greater distance from the camera. The picture has a\nperiodic topology in the sense that the left and right edges show the same direction of view (purely\nposterior). Zenith and nadir are at \u00c61, upwards and downwards in the picture plane, they have been\narbitrarily cropped. The horizon roughly cuts the actors in half, thus indicating the height of the camera.\nKoenderink et al. 7\nThe drawings were digitised into ordered lists of Cartesian coordinate pairs. All\nsubsequent analysis was done on these data.2\nAnalysis\nVarious types of analysis can be done on this data. However, we are careful not to\noveranalyse the data in view of the fact that participants delivered quick sloppy drawings\nand did not use any drawing or measuring instruments.\nInitial Categorical Checks\nAt an initial stage we removed four items from the list because obviously they were\nincoherent. In one case this was known to be due to language problems. Formal reasons\nwere such factors as, for instance, a number of actors different from six, cases of all actors\nfacing the camera, evidently in conflict with the pictorial content, or extreme long time to\nreflect on the response. This left 57 cases.\nIn 55 out of 57 cases (96.5%), the camera was located outside the convex hull of the actor\nlocations. With a Bayes factor of 9.5 we have `substantial' evidence (using Jeffreys prior and\nscale) for the fact that the observers located the camera at some distance in front of the group.\nAnother coarse check involves the nose directions. In 50 out of 57 cases (88%), all noses\npointed into the interior of the convex hull. With a Bayes factor of 8.9 we have again\n`substantial' evidence for the fact that all observers faced into the interior.\nFigure 5. Top left. The azimuth is defined with respect to the forward direction defined in Figure 1 left,\nangles being counted in the clockwise direction (in this figure, all ranges have been set to the same value).\nTop right. This is a sketch of how the configuration appears to most observers, except that the ranges and\nazimuths have been set to their veridical values. Bottom. Gaze directions are reckoned with respect to the\nlocal direction of view, thus they are zero for actors in the dorsal, \u00c6180 for those in the ventral pose. Here\nwe show two example poses, one for negative and one for positive gaze angle.\nFigure 6. A sheet as used in the experiment. At top the stimulus and at bottom right the instructions. At\nbottom left the drawing area (which blank at the start of a trial). Here we show a typical drawing, this is the\n`response'. (All responses made available as a movie on the publisher's website). Notice that the method is\nself-documenting.\nKoenderink et al. 9\nParameter Estimates\nA very simple starting point is an overall average. First we computed the mean and\ncovariance matrix for the six actor locations. The drawing was then translated, rotated\nand scaled to place the mean at the origin, the orientation of the largest variance\nhorizontal, with the largest variance equal to 1. This brings all results into a common\nformat. This is a necessary stage because observers used different placements, orientations\nand sizes in their drawings.\nWe then averaged over the full group, using circular statistics for the nose directions. In\nFigure 7 we show the result. The ellipses for the locations and sectors for the directions have\nbeen drawn at one standard deviation.\nThe result is encouraging, for it shows that the normalised data is quite homogeneous.\nThis result is perhaps even better than expected.\nThe apparent scope. One simple measure is the apparent angular scope of the configuration as\nsubtended by the group seen from the camera location. The median is 104, with an\ninterquartile interval of 89 to 119. The histogram is shown in Figure 8.\nWith a median wider than a right angle, the scopes are quite wide. However, it is evident\nthat the scope is certainly less than 180. Thus, virtually all participants saw the picture as\npictorial content `in front of them' or perhaps `behind the picture plane'. This is a major\nqualitative result.\nAspect ratio. For this initial pass through the data we defined the `aspect ratio' as the square\nroot of the ratio of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the positions in the normalised\ndata. The eigenvectors are almost all (exceptions noted later) in the anterior\u00adposterior and\nleft\u00adright orientations, so this is a reasonable estimate in most cases.\nThe majority of the configurations have an aspect ratio quite different from 1. In all cases,\nthe elongated hexagon is oriented with its major axis at right angles to the principal direction\nFigure 7. The normalized (see text) and averaged configuration. The camera position is indicated in orange,\nthe actors in pink and the nose directions in blue. The thick black line suggests the spatial configuration of the\ngroup, the thin black lines the directions of the actors as seen from the camera location.\nof view (see Figure 7). The configurations are extended in the lateral orientation or \u00ad\nequivalently \u00ad flattened in the (frontal) depth direction.\nshow a histogram of the distribution. (In the discussion we have occasion to address the\naspect ratios from another perspective.)\nDepth ratios. The range ratios (camera to actors) are either 1,\nffiffiffi\np\ncan easily be obtained from the observed geometry. Since the depth ratios can easily be\nestimated from the relative sizes of the actors in the stimulus, one perhaps expects to find\nthem reflected in the results. In Figure 10 we show distribution data.\nThe unit range ratios are fd1=d6\n, d3=d4g (indices defined in Figure 5) as well as their\nreciprocals. Thus the median is not too interesting, only the spread is. The interquartile range\nis 0.927 to 1.08, which may be partly due to the fact that the actors were not identical in\nheight.\nFor the range ratios 2 we use fd3=d1\n, d4=d6g. The median is 1.76 and the interquartile range\nFigure 9. Histogram of the aspect ratios of the hexagonal group.\nFigure 8. Histogram of the apparent scope.\nKoenderink et al. 11\nThe range ratios square root of 2 show a bimodal distribution. Here we need to distinguish\nbetween the near and the far range. In the near range we consider the ratios fd2=d1\nin the far range, fd3=d2\n, d4=d5g. In the near range, the median ratio is 1.77 and the\ninterquartile range is 0.852 to 1.09. So, the near and far ranges are indeed very different and\nboth far from veridical, though in different directions.\nThus the results for the\nffiffiffi\np\nrange ratios are somewhat puzzling. After all, the veridical\nvalues are simply implied by a ratio of two linear stretches in the picture plane. Participants\napparently do not use the optical size\u00addistance relation to their best advantage, whereas it\nwould be natural for them to assume that the actors were of (very roughly) similar height.\nApparent azimuths. The azimuths at which the camera sees the actors are spaced\nat 60 intervals. This is reflected by a uniform spacing in the Mercator projection,\neven in the case of the left-most and right-most actors if one remembers the periodic\ntopology of the horizon. One might expect the observers to space the apparent azimuths\nequally since they are fully displayed in the picture plane. This turns out to be hardly the case\nthough.\nFigure 11 shows a plot of the observed azimuths against the veridical ones. Apparently,\nthe observed azimuths of the outermost actors are highly compressed. This is already evident\nfrom the average plot (Figure 7).\nNose directions. The veridical nose directions have been listed earlier, they are:\nFigure 10. Distributions of depth ratios. Notice that the cases of\nffiffiffi\np\nrange ratios have been split into near\n(`[\nffiffiffi\np\n]n') and far (`[\nffiffiffi\np\n]f') instances. The 1,\nffiffiffi\np\nand 2 levels have been indicated with the horizontal lines.\nAzimuth Gaze\nThe deviations (median observed nose direction minus the veridical direction) have been\nplotted against azimuth in Figure 12. (The figure also shows the interquartile ranges.) Clearly,\nthe observations differ appreciably from veridical.\nDiscussion\nFirst some special cases are discussed and a discussion on generic results follows. Although\nthe special cases get some attention here, one should not forget that the bulk of the data is\nbest represented by the averages shown in Figure 7. The special cases form only a small\nminority. That is not to say they are not of major interest though. Of the two interpretations\nsuggested in Figure 1 right (a fuller discussion follows later) one has the viewpoint interior to\nthe circle of actors and the other exterior to that circle. (Read `in the round', or something\nlike that for `circle' here, we obviously do not intend a perfect geometrical circle.) Both are\nquite reasonable interpretations. Whereas it is indeed very interesting to note that the large\nmajority voted `exterior', it is highly relevant that some voted `interior': It shows that\nparticipants have a choice.3 A formal analysis also reveals two categorically different but\nFigure 12. The deviations from veridical of the observed nose directions, plotted against the azimuth. The\ndots are medians, the interquartile range is also indicated, though hardly apparent.\nFigure 11. A plot of the observed azimuths against the veridical ones (Remember that \u00c6180 are the same\npoint on the horizon!). The azimuths of the outermost actors appear highly compressed.\nKoenderink et al. 13\noptically equivalent (Ittleson, 1952) interpretations. Thus, it is a notable fact that generic\nobservers have a very pronounced preference for one of these.\nInside the Magic Circle\nThere were two observers who entered the magic circle (see Figure 13). These are mutually\nvery different cases.\nIn the case of Observer 44 we see a standard configuration except for the location of the\ncamera. Here the view is from outside the magic circle, whereas the camera has been placed\ninside. Of course, this latter placement is fully inconsistent with the configuration. The fact\nthat two actors evidently had their back turned towards the camera is completely ignored.\nThis drawing is possibly a mixture of what the observer actually saw and some aspect of what\nthe observer knew about 360 cameras but could not integrate with the percept.\nThe case of Observer 51 is more interesting. This was in fact the only observer that entered\nthe magic circle in a qualitatively consistent manner, the inconsistencies (which are not at all\nminor) being of a quantitative nature. This observer marked the actors both in the stimulus\nand in the drawing, so we can be certain that the two noses pointing outwards belong to the\nactors seen from the dorsal side and that the noses pointing at right angles to the visual\ndirection belong to the actors seen in profile. The responses are indeed quite consistent,\nexcept for the fact that the distance ratios have been fully ignored. Apparently the urge to\nsee a `circle' was much stronger than the additional visual evidence.\nThere was actually another observer among the ones left out from the data set who started\nwith drawing a circle, putting the camera at the centre, the actors in a regular hexagon \u00ad fully\nignoring angular size and horizon dip cues. The observer then rounded this off by putting the\nnose directions as would fit a view from far out of the magic circle. In this case the drawing\nwas evidently made on the basis of guesses in reflective thought as was also evident from the\ntime taken to reflect (the reason for the decision to ignore this response).\nFigure 13. The two observers who entered the magic circle. Locations and directions of the nose are\nindicated by the white dots with thick black line elements. The cross denotes the origin of the (normalised)\ncoordinates. The black dot indicates the camera location.\nConvexity\nThere are three nonconvex responses, two of these trivial, because of minor sloppiness in\ndrawing, the remaining one is interesting and merits mention (Figure 14).\nThe configuration is evidently nonconvex and the scope is unusually large, about 180.\nThis is the only observer that noticed the huge scope, although still not entering the magic\ncircle. The response shows the observer to notice the nose direction with respect to the visual\ndirection, no other observer did that. Also the depth ratios are reasonably well reflected in the\nresponse (compare Figure 10). All in all, this observer picked up more cues than almost\nanyone else. The response is close to possible interpretations that include `the space behind\nthe back' (see later).\nWe do not discuss the convexity issue further at this point, since it will be more fully\ntreated in terms of the log-polar model introduced later. (A configuration that is nonconvex\nin physical space may well be convex in visual space.)\nThe Overall Qualitative Outcome\nThe major result of the experiment is neatly summarised in the average results depicted in\nFigure 7. Apparently the actors are perceived as arranged in a slightly flattened hexagon, its\nlong axis perpendicular to the principal direction of view (defined in Figure 7). The camera is\nlocated outside the hexagon. All nose directions point into the interior of the hexagon. Thus\nthe experience is of the magic circle as seen from the outside.\nSuch a result is not unexpected (Koenderink & van Doorn, 2017, in press). The impression\ncannot even be said to be `non-veridical' in the sense that the picture itself is not a touchstone\nfor veridicality. The result is due to these major factors:\n observers implicitly assume some finite scope, in many cases related to the extent of their\napparent field of view (Koenderink, van Doorn, & Todd 2009). The latter is almost\ninvariably smaller (usually much smaller) than a half-space;\n observers relate the apparent spatial attitude of pictorial objects to their local (apparent)\nvisual directions (Koenderink, van Doorn et al., 2010);\nFigure 14. The response of Observer 17. Locations and directions of the nose are indicated by the white\ndots with thick black line elements. The cross denotes the origin of the (normalised) coordinates. The black\ndot indicates the camera location.\nKoenderink et al. 15\n observers tend to apply templates in favor of `inverse optics' algorithms (Koenderink,\nThe same factors give rise to huge errors in regular wide-angle photographs, as we have\ndocumented in the past (Koenderink, van Doorn et al., 2010).\nNext we discuss these issues in more detail in terms of the log-polar model of visual space\nDiscussion of Selected Quantitative Details\nIn this subsection we discuss a number of remarkable regularities in the data.\nAzimuth pattern. One pictorial structure that might be thought to be obvious to all observers\nbecause immediately visually present is the pattern of azimuths. Even without fully parsing\nthe stimulus the regular spacing of the major pictorial objects (the actors) is evident. One\nmight expect that basic fact to be reflected in the responses. Perhaps remarkably, it is not, as\nis evident from Figure 11.\nThis might suggest that observers generally put the camera too close to the hexagonal\nconfiguration. This is indeed in accord with the generally wider than expected scopes.\nOne may speculate that it perhaps has to do with the limited drawing area. Of course, there\nis no way to check for that in the data, it would imply another (major) effort to address the\nissue empirically.\nDepth ratios. The distributions of depth ratios as plotted in Figure 10 gives rise to some\nconcern.\nThe depth ratios 1 are responded to veridically, with little spread. This is no more than\nexpected. The depth ratios 2 are underestimated, although only by about 10%, also, not\nmuch reason for concern. Their spread is large.\nThe depth ratios\nffiffiffi\np\nare wildly off the mark though. Moreover, the distributions are\nmarkedly bimodal with the ratios in the near ranges being treated quite differently from\nthose in the far range. Those in the near range are overestimated by about 30%, whereas\nthose in the far range are underestimated by about the same amount. In the far case the\nspread is moderate, in the near case rather larger.\nSuch effects are surprising in view of the clear pictorial cues. As seen in Figure 15 the\npictorial evidence leaves little doubt as to the depth ratios. Observers are expected to use such\ncues fully automatically. There is something going on here that is hard to put the finger on, at\nleast on the basis of the present data. Again, it would imply another (major) effort to address\nthe issue empirically.\nAspect ratios and scopes. The cases of the aspect ratios and the scopes are discussed together\nsince they appear mutually related.\nThe apparent scopes appear rather larger than expected. The median corresponds to a\nfocal length of about 14 mm on a 35-mm camera (the classical 24 \u00c2 36 mm Leica format),\ngenerally considered a fairly wide wide-angle (the shortest lens for the Leica is the 12 mm\nHeliar produced by Voigtlander). Of course, it is still fully located in the frontal half-space of\nthe (imagined) camera.\nFrom an earlier investigation (Koenderink et al., 2009) we know that the median `apparent\nfield of view' (perhaps the `diameter of the visual field') is about a right angle (as Helmholtz\nreports for his own subjective feeling) with a very wide distribution from about 10 to\nover 210. In the latter case, people feel to `see behind their ears', in the former, they feel\n`everything to be in front' of them.\nThe fact that people are not comfortable with a limited drawing surface may have played a\nrole, in that they perhaps place the camera closer to the configuration than they would have if\ngiven more drawing space. (Of course, being confronted with an essentially unlimited surface\nmight intimidate them even more, there is no obvious way to handle such inhibitions.) One\ncan only speculate.\nHere we reconsider the issue of aspect ratios. In Figure 9 we measured aspect ratios in the\ndrawing. It is probably more useful to consider these in the log-polar representation (see next\nsection). So we compute `aspect ratio' as measured in log-polar visual space. These aspect\nratios also have a large spread, in this case with an interquartile range of almost 0.3 to 0.5. On\ntheoretical grounds one expects a relation between the scope and the aspect ratio (see next\nsection). This can be tested via a scatterplot involving all cases (Figure 16). This graph should\nbe interpreted in terms of the log-polar model introduced later.\nApparent spatial attitudes. The nose directions with respect to the local camera-viewing-\ndirection are immediately given as pictorial evidence. Actors are clearly seen either in\nanterior or posterior frontal attitude, or in left or right profile.\nHowever, observers apparently distinguish between various directional frames. In this case\nthey show systematic deviations from what appears to be pictorially given, as documented in\nWe believe such systematic effects to be due to the same factors we have studied in some detail\nearlier (Koenderink, van Doorn et al., 2010), so it may be said that they meet our expectations.\nFigure 15. These are cutouts from an equirectangular map, thus the vertical dimension is simply the\nelevation \". For practical purposes, the height ratios in the Mercator projection are quit close. It is evident\nKoenderink et al. 17\nThe Log-Polar Model of Visual Space\nFor simplicity we only consider the horizontal plane at eye-height, thus, if we say `visual\nspace' (usually a hemisphere augmented with depth), we limit the discussion to the horizon\naugmented with depth. What is `optically specified' are just visual directions, the depths are\nadded in the psychogenesis of visual awareness.\nIn a model of visual space, one has to address the issue of depth values. The best known\nexample is `inverted optics': one simply computes the depths from the optical data (Marr,\n1982; Poggio, Torre, & Koch, 1985), if this does not work one guesstimates them (Knill &\nRichards, 1996). This appears reasonable enough, but what if none of this works to\nsatisfaction? Is it possible to say something about the structure of visual space anyway?\nHere is a kind of poor man's inference, based on Euclid's Optics (Burton, 1945):\n in the absence of specific knowledge, all visual directions are equivalent, none is preferred.\nHence the structure of visual space should be invariant with respect to angular translations\n(rotations about the nadir-zenith axis).\n in the absence of specific knowledge, there is no preferred `unit of distance'. Hence the\nstructure of visual space should be invariant with respect to distance scalings (dilations or\ncontractions about the view point).\nThese very basic invariances imply a minimal structure of visual space. It can\nbe formalised in various ways. A very simple formalisation is the log-polar model (see\nUse azimuth ' (angle from the anterior direction, ranging from \u00c0 (or \u00c0180) to \u00fe (or\n\u00fe180)) and the logarithm of the distance from the origin  \u00bc log % (% the distance from the\norigin in an arbitrary unit) as Cartesian coordinates. Thus  ranges from \u00c01 (where\nthe eye is) to \u00fe1 (the far distance). The invariances imply that arbitrary translations in\nthe '\u00adcoordinate system are irrelevant.\nThis model has many nice properties, for instance, it is conformal, thus has no\ndeformations of local details.\nFigure 16. Scatterplot of the aspect ratios against the scopes (red points). The curve is the theoretical\nprediction, the points are aspect ratios as measured in the log-polar visual space model. Although the spread\nis large, as was to be expected, the prediction is evidently in the right ballpark. (Two cases of interior views\nleft out.)\nFigure 17. The `log-polar' model of visual space. At left, a polar coordinate system in the Euclidean plane.\nThe system of `rays' is obviously invariant with respect to rotations about the origin. The radii of the system\nof circles concentric with the origin have been distributed such that the system is invariant with respect to\nuniform scalings about the origin. Thus, the whole system is invariant with respect to rotations and scalings.\nThis models the structure of optical information as discussed by Euclid in his book on optics. At right, this\nconfiguration has been transformed by the log-polar map. One obtains a Cartesian grid, small regions of the\ngrid are geometrically similar to the corresponding region in physical space. The map is conformal. Arbitrary\ntranslations of figures in log-polar space derive from optically equivalent figures in physical space. This model\nhas been shown to account quite well for observer responses with very wide fields of view.\nFigure 18. The configuration shown in Figure 1 right plotted in visual space according to the log-polar\nmodel. Now the strange blue banana shape is a perfect ellipse, whereas the orange ellipse is the orange area\nwhich extents all the way to \u00c01. It is also closed (although it may not look that way), because the left and\nright edges of the plot are actually the same visual ray, in the posterior direction.\nKoenderink et al. 19\nAs a first application we plot the map of the two regions plotted in Figure 1 right in visual\nspace (see Figure 18). Now it is immediately obvious why the strange blue banana shaped\nregion in Figure 1 is of interest: It is the unique ellipse that passes through the points of the\nstimulus hexagon in visual space. It is perhaps more difficult to see that the orange region is\nbounded by a closed curve too, but notice that the left and right vertical boundaries are\nactually the same visual direction. Remember that `the eye' is at f0, \u00c01g. In the log-polar\nmodel the eye is outside the plane, because the eye cannot see itself. It is of considerable\ninterest to compare the complementary depictions of the same areas in Figures 1 right\nStarting from this model picture, we may attempt a bold extrapolation: What if we scale\nthe azimuth?\nScalings of the depth dimensions are reasonably well understood. We have worked\non that for many years. Scalings of the azimuth dimension have \u00ad to the best of our\nknowledge \u00ad not been considered before, except in the (very special and limited) case\nof linear perspective (Pirenne, 1971). Scalings of the azimuth dimension are of\nimmediate importance in the perception of photographs for which the scope is essentially\nunknown.\nSimply scaling scope we obtain the interpretations shown in Figure 19. Of course, the\ncrucial application is to scale from the space behind your back (or, equivalently, in front of\nFigure 19. Here are examples of equivalent configurations in physical space (left) and visual space (right).\nLeft: The configuration at top left corresponds to the `true sized' configuration in physical space (Figure 1\nright). The other three cases involve scalings of the scope, by factors of 2, 4 and 8. Notice that for the factor\n4, the shape is `almost' convex, the change to convex happens at a factor of\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nffiffiffiffiffi\np\np\n=\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\np\n \nFor larger factors, the banana-shape gives rise to an ovoi\n\u00a8dal convex region as in the case at bottom right. In\nthese figures, the eye is indicated with the open dot. Right: The same four configurations in log-polar space.\nThese are all perfect ellipses, they have been scaled in scope, that is the horizontal dimension, and the vertical\ndimension is the same for all. Thus, this is a anisotropic scaling in visual space. In these figures, the eye is at\nf0, \u00c01g (far down the page!). The scaling allows a configuration that extends behind the observer (left figure\nat top-left), to be confined to the frontal region (the other three figures at left). Such scalings of the apparent\nscope appear quite natural when observers are not aware of the true scope of a picture.\nthe picture place) to the space in front of you (or, equivalently, behind the picture place).\nHere it is already quite clear from all kinds of data that visually, there is no space behind your\nback and that it is in bad taste, and almost impossible to pull off, to show objects in front of the\npicture plane.5\nThus it is extremely interesting to notice that the (trivially simple) log-polar model does\nquite a good job to post-dict the present data. The exterior view model fits the data quite well.\nIn the aspect ratio plot (Figure 16), the aspect ratios (square root of ratio of eigenvalues of\nthe covariance matrix of the locations in visual space) are evidently well fitted. Thus one may\nactually extrapolate from azimuths behind the camera to azimuths in front of the viewer (or\nbehind the picture plane), as demonstrated in Figure 19. (The corresponding figures for the\ncategorically different case of Observer 17 are Figure 1-right (physical space) and Figure 18\n(visual space), the bluish-tinted cases.)\nIn visual space (Figure 19 right) the scaling transforms an ellipse into another ellipse, thus\nthe plot of Figure 16, where the aspect ratios have been measured in visual space is very\n`natural'. The definition of `aspect ratio' in physical space (although formally fine) seems\nmore contrived.\nIn the past we have already shown that pictorial space allows for huge (anisotropic)\nscalings in the  \u00bc log %\u00addomain (Koenderink, van Doorn, & Kappers, 1994). Apparently\nany anisotropic scaling with principal axes along the '\u00addimensions can be admitted. That\nsuch an anisotropic scaling works so well is not something that could have been expected, it is\na major result that significantly extends our previous conclusions.\nWe know of no other data addressing this issue. It is evidently of great interest to attempt\nto collect more though.\nFigure 20. A picture of the scene after a 180 rotation of the frontal direction. Notice that the actors seen\nin profile are actually adjacent to each other. The configuration now appears nonconvex, a bit like looking at\nthe convex side of a banana.\nKoenderink et al. 21\nConclusions\nParticipants were confronted with a postcard-like photograph, obviously of a natural scene,\nwithout any information concerning the scope of the field of view captured by the camera.\nThis was intentional as it is closest to generic applications. Almost no newspaper, magazine\nor textbook prints the width of the field of view in the legends (often there is no legend to\nbegin with).\nAlthough an obvious fact, almost irrelevant to relate, this goes squarely against the grain of\nconventional understanding of correct depiction. The conventional theory of correct depiction\nFigure 21. A Postel map based on Riemann normal coordinates centred at the nadir. The whole circular\ncircumference represents the zenith, a single point. This map is neither conformal nor area true. It is quite\nnice near the origin (the nadir) though, essentially up to the horizon. Distances from the nadir and angles at\nthe nadir are perfectly represented. Notice that the tripod on which the camera was mounted is visible at the\ncentre. The camera cannot see itself. It takes two 190 back-to-back fish-eye photographs and stitches these\ntogether in the camera. The output is an equirectangular representation of the full optic array.\nis solidly based on linear perspective or, more generally, on the conservation of angular\nrelations between visual directions (Pirenne, 1971). On the one hand, it is generally (but\nsilently!) understood that pictures will `work', no matter what, on the other hand, it is a\nuniversally agreed fact that visual directions should be conserved. There is obviously some\nuneasiness here, in that many `wrong' depictions often still give rise to `normal' impressions.\nTo look `wrong', one typically needs to violate topological relations, as pioneered by artists\nThe familiar Ames room (Ittleson, 1952) still manages to induce wonder, yet it works\nbecause it conserves visual directions. Ames demonstrated this loud and clear, although the\nsignificance of his message tends to be underestimated. He demonstrated that pictures are\ninfinitely ambiguous, something that few scientists are ready to hear even today. For instance,\nit implies that `inverse optics' per se is impossible. But in viewing and (hopefully)\nunderstanding pictures, the public routinely goes way beyond Ames. The Ames\ndemonstration is trivial, but, because of that, important.\nThe really interesting cases involve deformations of the bundle of visual rays (Burton,\nIn this study we move away from the Ames case in that we do not conserve visual\ndirections. It is perhaps of some interest though, because it involves the space behind the\nback, or in front of the picture plane. Our empirical results at least suggest that a fairly simple\nmodel suffices to get at least the basics right. Why such a simple model would work is\nsomething we are not ready to comment on. We are not aware of any argument from\ncontemporary brain science that might conceivably illuminate this matter.\nAn interesting aside is that people who are (or have been made) intellectually aware of the\nactual physical layout of the scene are generally (we met no exceptions) still unable to `see'\nthis in terms of their visual awareness. A different approach would have been to tell the\nparticipants up front what they will be confronted with. Perhaps, it would not be too hard to\ninstruct participants so as to arrive at veridical judgements through a mixture of geometrical\nand logical reasoning. It does not work anyway. Even when people know what is there, they\nstubbornly see what they see at first blush. Awareness is not a cognitive judgement. Visual\nartists trust their eyes, ignoring their reflective thoughts.\nWhy the difficulties? We speculate that this has to do with the fact that there is no visual\nspace behind one's back (Phillips & Voshell, 2009). As a consequence, pictures are intuitively\nunderstood to only show part of what could be in front of one. Closely related to this is that\nthe two actors seen in profile in the stimulus are adjacent to each other in the physical scene\n(see Figure 20, compare Figure 1), yet look to be at maximum separation in the picture. The\nshortest connection between them would have to cross the posterior meridian of the optic\narray, an area behind one's back. In the picture, this connection would have to go by way of\nthe left and right edges of the picture, which actually should be identified, again something\nthat is not possible if everything is experienced as in front of the observer (Koenderink & van\nAn actual picture of everything in front of the observer only shows part of the\nconfiguration (Figure 3). The depicted part is seen as essentially veridical.\nA more or less veridical view of the whole scene can perhaps only (we are not aware of\nalternatives) be pictured in a bird eye's view of the scene (Figure 21). This is a Riemann\nnormal coordinates map (also known as Postel's projection (Flocon & Barre, 1968)) centred\nat the nadir. In this map, the full circular picture frame represents the zenith, that is a single\npoint, thus may have some counterintuitive properties. Such renderings have recently become\npopular as `small planet' images. Indeed, the horizon is a circle, and the full viewing sphere is\nmapped inside the disk.\nKoenderink et al. 23\nThe results from the analysis are clear enough. Virtually all participants are aware of a\nscene that fits the space in front of them, with the view point outside of the configuration. The\nrelevant pictorial cues available to the observer are the horizontal separations, the heights in\nthe picture plane, the relative heights of the actors and the apparent spatial attitudes with\nrespect to the local visual direction (frontal, posterior or profile view, in the latter case facing\nleft or right). The angular extent of the configuration is not indicated, thus it has to be\nassumed by the observer. It will necessarily be idiosyncratic. From previous experience\nwith picture perception one may expect values to lie about the right angle, albeit with a\nhuge spread. This is indeed what we find.\nIn any case, the results are clear evidence for the fact that the magic circle is almost\nimpenetrable, only 1 of our 61 participants spontaneously succeeding. As we have shown\nin a related study, the same holds for the magic sphere \u00ad the viewing sphere (Koenderink &\nvan Doorn, in press). For the latter case historical evidence for an intellectual awareness of\nthis topo-agnosia existed for centuries (Goldstein & Hon, 2007; Stevenson, 1921). We are not\naware of such evidence relating to the magical circle though.\nBy way of conclusion, it is easily possible to design configurations that will be interpreted\nby virtually all observers in some intended nonveridical manner. Since photographs (other\nthan drawings or paintings) tend to be taken for optical truth, this may well be of interest to\nmovie directors and illustrators. It may also serve as a warning against ill-considered use of\nwide panoramic images for applications in which a roughly veridical impression is desirable.\nThink of the real estate business, travel agencies and so forth. It is perhaps especially\nimportant in the court room (Carter, 2010; Sholik, 2015). Whether straight-out-of-the-\ncamera panoramic images might be admitted as legal evidence should be a serious issue.\n"
