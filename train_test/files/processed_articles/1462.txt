Galloway2\n1 Epidemiology and Public Health Group, Peninsula Medical School, University of Exeter, Exeter, United Kingdom, 2 School of Biosciences, University of Exeter, Exeter,\nUnited Kingdom, 3 School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, United Kingdom\n Introduction\nBisphenol A (BPA) is a man-made compound that is suspected\nto act as an endocrine disruptor, i.e. a compound capable of\ncausing dysfunction to hormonally regulated body systems [1].\nMore than 2.2 million metric tonnes of BPA are produced\nworldwide each year for use mainly as a constituent monomer in\npolycarbonate plastics, which are used extensively in drinks\ncontainers and food packaging, and in the production of epoxy\nresins used in the lining of canned goods [2]. Widespread and\ncontinuous human exposure to BPA is believed to be mainly\nthrough dietary intake [3], with additional exposure through\ndrinking water, dental sealants, dermal exposure and inhalation of\nhousehold dusts. It is one of the world's highest production volume\ncompounds and human biomonitoring data indicates that the\nmajority (over 90%) of the general population is exposed to BPA,\nevidenced by the presence of measurable concentrations of\nmetabolites in the urine of population representative samples\nThe potential for BPA to cause adverse human health effects is\nbelieved to be a consequence of its well-documented estrogenic\nactivity, with reports of both estrogen agonist [7] and androgen\nantagonist [8] activity. Reported additional modes of action [9]\ncell function [15], thyroid hormone disruption [16] and obesity\npromoting effects [17]. Many of these effects have been reported\nto occur at concentrations below recommended safe daily\nexposure levels, prompting much recent debate on the require-\nOnce ingested BPA is metabolised to form the highly water\nsoluble major metabolite, bisphenol A-glucuronide. Volkel et al\nreported that the half life for renal clearance of this metabolite\nfrom blood following oral administration was 5.3 hours in adult\nmale and female subjects [22]. Exposure studies in humans are\nrestricted due to ethical reasons and by the difficulties in finding\nindividuals completely unexposed to BPA from the environment.\nAs such there are no in vivo data on the rate at which unconjugated\nBPA is converted to bisphenol A-glucuronide in humans, only\npredictions [6]. Given the urinary route of clearance of the major\nmetabolite, urine is considered to be the most appropriate body\nfluid for BPA exposure assessment. Based on the animal and\nlaboratory evidence, we previously hypothesised that higher\nurinary BPA concentrations would be associated with adverse\nhuman health effects, especially in the liver and in relation to\ninsulin, cardiovascular disease and obesity. In 2008 data were\nreleased from the US National Health and Nutrition Survey\n(NHANES) 2003/04 providing the first large-scale population-\nrepresentative epidemiological data on urinary BPA concentra-\ntions with sufficient statistical power to detect low-dose effects [6].\nHigher BPA concentrations in NHANES respondents were found\nto be associated with cardiovascular disease diagnoses (Odds Ratio\n(OR) per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in BPA concentra-\nregression models). Higher BPA concentrations were also\nassociated with diagnosed diabetes (OR per 1SD increase in\nwith other common diseases [23,24,25],suggesting specificity of\nthe reported findings.\nThese first reports clearly need to be replicated in independent\nstudy samples, to ensure that the findings are robust and to refine\nestimates of effect sizes. Here we report an epidemiological\nwhich measured BPA levels on a new independent cross-sectional\nsample of the US non-institutionalized population. We re-tested\nthe originally identified associations of higher urinary BPA\nconcentrations associated with reported heart disease, diabetes\nand liver enzymes. We also estimated the strength of these\nassociations in all the available data (combining NHANES 2003/\nMethods\n[26]. The study assesses health and diet, and the samples are\nrepresentative of the non-institutionalized population of the\nUnited States. NHANES surveys are cross-sectional, recruiting\nnew samples for each wave. NHANES is administered by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics, the Health Statistics\nInstitutional Review Board of which approved the study.\nEthics Statement\nNHANES is a publicly available data set approved by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics institutional review board,\nand all participants provide written informed consent.\nAssessment of Bisphenol A Concentrations\nparticipants supplied urine samples which were analyzed for BPA.\nStudies of the temporal variability in urinary BPA concentrations\nhave reported single urinary measurements to show moderate\nsensitivity for predicting an individual's tertiary categorization\n[27]. A spot urine sample was collected from each respondent and\ntotal (free and conjugated) urinary concentrations of BPA were\nmeasured by the Division of Environmental Health Laboratory\nSciences (National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention) using online solid-phase extrac-\ntion coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography\u00adisotope\ndilution tandem mass spectrometry with peak focusing. The\ncomprehensive quality control system included reagent blanks to\nensure samples were not contaminated during handling, stor-\nage and analysis.

The lower limit of detection\nwith measured BPA and urinary creatinine levels) were replaced\nwith a value equal to the LLOD divided by the square root of two\nin order to distinguish between a non-detectable laboratory test\nresult from a measured laboratory test result. We assigned the\neither NHANES years with BPA concentrations below the\nHealth Outcomes\nQuestions relating to medical conditions were asked before the\nphysical examination, in the respondent's home, using the\nComputer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) system. Respon-\ndents aged 20 years and over were asked ``Has a doctor or other\nhealth professional ever told you that you have...'' for angina,\ncoronary heart disease, heart attack, stroke, asthma, emphysema,\nchronic bronchitis; arthritis, thyroid problems, any kind of liver\ncondition, or cancers. We defined `cardiovascular disease' (CVD)\nas any reported diagnosis of angina, heart attack or coronary heart\ndisease. Respondents of all ages were also asked ``(Other than\nduring pregnancy,) have you ever been told by a doctor or health\nprofessional that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes. We\ncombined self-reported diagnosed and borderline diabetes as\n`diabetes' for analysis. Unfortunately fasting blood glucose levels\nwere only available for the participant subset seen in the mornings,\nand were therefore not used in our analyses.\nData were analyzed for the three original liver enzyme markers\nwhich was measured by NHANES using an enzymatic rate\nmethod; lactate dehydrogenase, using an enzymatic rate method;\nalkaline phosphatase, using a 2-Amino-2-Methyl-1-Propanol\n(AMP) buffer. Full details of analyte extraction and measurement\nare available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe NHANES survey uses a complex cluster sample design,\nwith certain demographic groups (including those in low\nsocioeconomic positions and Mexican Americans) over-sampled\nto obtain adequate representation. To account for the complex\nsampling, weighted estimates were computed, in accordance with\nthe NHANES `Analytic and Reporting Guidelines' (http://www.\ncdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_general_guidelines_june_04.\nestimated by the Taylor series (linearization) method to take\naccount of stratification and clustering using the provided `masked\nvariance pseudo-psu' and `pseudo-stratum' variables. All analyses\nwere conducted using Stata SE Version 10. DM, NR and WH\nanalyzed the data.\nThe respondents included in our analyses were those aged 18 to\n74 years (of those randomly selected by NHANES for BPA\nmeasurement) in order to focus on adult health conditions. The 74\nyear age cut-off was selected to minimize biases caused by co-\nmorbidity and non-representation of seniors in institutions. Six\nindividuals with BPA concentrations greater than 80.1 ng/ml in\n2005/06 were excluded from our analyses, as these high levels\nwere outside the range of BPA in the original 2003/04 sample.\nOne respondent was excluded due to a missing urinary creatinine\nBisphenol A and Heart Disease\nStandardized BPA measures were calculated using single wave,\ncohort specific z-scores of BPA for independent NHANES wave\nanalyses and pooled wave, cohort specific z-scores of BPA for\npooled analyses. Logistic regression models were used to estimate\nodds ratios of self-reporting doctor diagnosed heart disease and\ndiabetes per one standard deviation increase in BPA concentra-\ntions. Linear regression models were used to estimate associations\nbetween logged levels of liver enzymes and standardized BPA\nconcentrations.\nRegression models were adjusted for potential confounders,\nincluding socioeconomic markers which Calafat and colleagues [5]\nreported to be associated with BPA concentrations, and urinary\ncreatinine to account for urine concentration [27]. Adjustment\nwas for: race/ethnicity, from self-description and categorized into:\nMexican American, other Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, non-\nHispanic Black, and other race (including multi-racial); education,\ncategorized into: less than high school, high school diploma\n(including GED), more than high school, and unknown education;\nannual household income, categorized into: less than $20,000;\nunknown income; smoking (from self-reported status asked in\nthose aged 20 and over), categorized into: never smoked, former\nsmoker, smoking some days, smoking every day, and unknown\nsmoking status; Body Mass Index (`BMI', measured weight in\nkilograms divided by the square of measured height in meters),\ncategorized into: underweight (BMI,18.5), recommended weight\nwaist circumference (in quartiles, with a missing value group); and,\nurinary creatinine concentration in mg/dl.\nGeneralized additive models with cubic regression splines [28]\nwere used to explore the functional form of the relationships\nbetween presence of a cardiovascular disease diagnosis and BPA\nconcentration. These models provide a method of identifying\ndepartures from linearity in exposure-response relationships.\nLinearity was assessed by visual inspection of the estimated spline\nfunctions and by consideration of the ``estimated degrees of\nfreedom'' (edf) for the smoothed BPA term. Values of the edf close\nto 1 were taken as evidence of linearity. These models were fitted\nin the statistical software `R' using the mgcv package for\ngeneralized additive modeling.\nPower Calculations\nPower calculations for analyses of diagnosis presence and liver\nenzyme concentrations were conducted using the approaches\nproposed by Hsieh et al [29] for logistic and linear regression\nunadjusted Odds Ratios of 1.4 for diagnoses of 5% prevalence per\nstandard deviation change in BPA concentration.

For liver enzymes,\nthe detectable effect size for 80% power was estimated using the\nsample after allowing for the reduction in variation in BPA\nexposure levels.\nResults\nthe two samples were otherwise similar (Table 1).\nBPA concentration adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity and urinary\ncreatinine, the difference in BPA levels between NHANES waves\nwas significant: (back transformed beta = 21.33 ng/ml, 95% CI:\nPer standard deviation increases in BPA concentration were\nassociated with positive responses to questions about physician\ndiagnoses of myocardial infarction in age, sex and ethnicity\np = 0.036), with OR estimates for reported angina and `coronary\nheart disease' being similar to 2003/04 but narrowly missing\nconventional two sided statistical significance (Table 2).

These analyses use the only\nlarge-scale (and high-quality) population-representative datasets\nthan in the earlier NHANES wave, with a geometric mean value\nof 1.79 compared with the earlier mean of 2.49. This represents a\nfall of around 30%. After adjusting for potential confounders, we\nfound that higher BPA concentrations were again associated with\nTable 1.

Associations of BPA concentration with\ndiabetes and liver enzymes were not statistically significant in the\n2005/06 data, although pooled estimates remained significant.\nCardiovascular disease results from a complex interaction of\ngenetic, lifestyle and environmental factors. Whilst several\npersonal risk factors for developing heart disease have been\nidentified, including smoking, diabetes and dyslipidemia, the\ncontribution of environmental contaminants has received com-\nparatively less attention. To date, the most widely reported\nassociations between cardiovascular disease and pollutants have\ncentred on exposure to air particulates, heavy metals, notably\narsenic and lead, and persistent organic pollutants.\nIt is pertinent to consider what is known of these previously\nreported associations, to place the current findings of associations\nwith BPA into context. Studies of over 100 million people across\nthe USA and Europe have shown that for every 10 mg/m3\nincrease in aerial fine particulate matter (PM10), there is a 0.3%\u00ad\n0.7% increase in cardiovascular mortality [30,31]. These effects\ncan appear and disappear quickly; transient increases in very fine\nparticulate matter are associated with an increased incidence of\nacute myocardial infarction within a few hours, highlighting the\nhigh sensitivity of cardiovascular tissues to the effects of\nenvironmental contaminants [32]. Such associations are plausible\nthrough several biological mechanisms, including alterations to\ninduction of systemic inflammation [36]. In the case of arsenic,\naltered vascular tone appears to be of more importance to the\nelevation in cardiovascular risk than vascular inflammation or\ndislipidemia [37,38]. Animal studies have implicated dysregulation\nof nitric oxide production and reactivity in arsenic's adverse effects\non cardiovascular risk [37], potentially via oxidation of protein\nthiol groups, including endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)\n[39]. A similar mechanism has been suggested for lead, which has\nbeen associated with hypertension in both animal and human\nepidemiology studies [40]. Both polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)\nand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) can induce\noxidative stress-mediated alterations to normal vascular endothe-\nlial cell function, leading to pro-inflammatory changes [41,42].\nTCDDs can in addition cause an increase in atherogenic serum\nlipid levels in animals and humans and a decrease in low density\nlipoprotein receptors in the liver [43,44]. Such a combination of\ndamage to endothelial cells with elevation in serum lipid levels\ncould be expected to increase cardiovascular risk.\nThe relevance of these mechanisms to the reported association\nbetween BPA and cardiovascular disease in the current study\nremains subjective. For example, inflammation is a dynamic\nresponse of vascularised tissues to injury, whilst excessive or\nprolonged inflammation is associated with various diseases in\naddition to cardiovascular disease [45]. Following oral ingestion,\nBPA is not considered a persistent compound, but neither is it\nimmediately cleared from the body, and there appears to be\nvirtually continuous human exposure [46]. It is lipophilic (the log\nof the octanol-water partition co-efficient (Kow\n) for BPA is between\nlipid rich tissues could occur with frequent exposure. This\npossibility is supported by recent findings that the population-\nbased half life for BPA is significantly longer than the previous\nestimates of around 6 hours [3]. The metabolism of BPA is\nreported to induce oxidative stress in rat hepatocytes following\nlong term (30 day) oral intake [10] and oxidative cellular damage\nhas been reported in a number of other experimental contexts\ncould theoretically lead to oxidative endothelial cell damage.\nFigure 1.

Hong et al [47]\nfound a significant dose-responsive relationship between BPA and\nthe oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-\ndeoxyguanosine (8-OHG) in a study of 960 adults, although the\nrelationship was not present in multiple regression models adjusted\nfor confounders including age and sex. Positive associations were\nalso reported between urinary BPA, MDA and 8-OHD, and with\nC-reactive protein, an inflammatory marker, in a cross-sectional\nstudy of 134 post-menopausal women, but not in men or pre-\nmenopausal women from the same study [48]. These gender\ndifferences suggest that occupancy and activation of the estrogen\nreceptor may have been a contributing factor in the induction of\noxidative stress.\nBPA is believed to exert its biological effects largely through\nloose occupancy of the estrogen receptor, and there are reports of\nboth estrogen agonist [7] and androgen antagonist [8] activity.\nBPA also binds strongly to the estrogen-related receptor-gamma\n(ERR-gamma), the function of which is unknown [9]. BPA\nexposure of cell suspensions results in lipid accumulation in\nadipocytes and hepatoma cell lines [49]. A variety of other effects\nof BPA have been noted, including disrupted pancreatic Beta-cell\nfunction producing insulin resistance in mice exposed to oral BPA\ndoses well below the current lowest observed adverse effect level\nconsidered by the US-EPA [15]. Two days of low-dose BPA\ninjections also produced insulin resistance in mice [50]. Associa-\ntions have been described previously between environmental\ntoxins, body weight, and diabetes [8,51] leading to suggestions that\nexposure to certain environmental pollutants may initiate or\nexacerbate the development of obesity [17] and associated health\nproblems [33]. Diabetes and dyslipidemia are recognized as\npersonal risk factors for developing heart disease. However,\nassociations with diabetes seen in the 2003/04 NHANES survey\nwas not evident in the current study, possibly because of the\nreduction in statistical power due to the lower levels of BPA in\n2005/06, resulting in wide confidence intervals around estimates.\nIt is possible that an as yet unidentified mechanism could be\ninvolved in the effects of BPA on cardiovascular function. The\nperoxisome proliferation activated receptor gamma, PPARc plays\na central role in the control of energy balance and lipid\nhomeostasis [52] and PPARc agonists such as rosiglitazone are\nused to treat insulin sensitivity. There have been reports that in\naddition to PPARc-mediated genome effects on genes important\nfor maintaining vascular tone (including eNOS), PPARc agonists\nmay activate or inhibit ion channel activity in vessel walls directly.\nIn studies of isolated vascular smooth muscle, rosiglitazone was\nable to attenuate inward calcium currents and enhance calcium-\nactivated potassium currents [53]. Certain BPA derivatives,\nincluding bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) are peroxisome\nproliferation activated receptor gamma (PPARc) antagonists and\nBADGE can block the adipogenic action of the receptor [54].\nAlthough BPA has been reported to increase adipocyte differen-\nTable 3.

Additional studies are clearly called for to\nexamine in detail the relationship between BPA and its derivates\nand PPARc signaling.\nA major limitation of our original analysis on NHANES 2003/\n04 [23] was that no replication data were available to help exclude\npresented here are based on an entirely new population sample,\nproviding an opportunity for independent replication of the\nearlier findings. BPA concentrations in 2005/06 were substan-\ntially lower than in 2003/04, resulting in a reduced power to\ndetect real associations. Despite this, we found near or significant\nassociations with responses to the three questions about heart\ndisease in NHANES 2005/06, and highly significant p-values for\nthe pooled estimates of association. We can now conclude that\nchance is an implausible explanation for the BPA association with\nheart disease. Replication of the BPA associations with diabetes\nand liver enzymes are less certain, with estimates for 2005/06\nhaving wide confidence intervals and not reaching statistical\nsignificance. Because of the lower BPA concentration levels in\n2005/06 a reduction in the strengths of association is to be\nexpected. The BPA measures in NHANES are based on single\nspot specimens, so misclassification from this single snapshot of\nbody burden will have resulted in a smaller (diluted) estimate of\nthe strength of association between BPA and the conditions of\ninterest: the true associations are likely to be much stronger. In\naddition, the pooled estimates of association suggest that the new\ndata is consistent with the original findings: larger samples will be\nneeded to provide accurate estimates of BPA associations with\ndiabetes or liver enzymes to exclude the possibility of real\nassociations being present.\nThe cross sectional nature of the associations reported need to\nbe treated with caution, as it is theoretically possible, for example,\nthat those with cardiovascular disease change their diets in such a\nway as to increase BPA exposure. In addition, it is possible that\nBPA exposure is associated with differential survival in cardiovas-\ncular disease. Longitudinal data demonstrating that high BPA\nconcentrations predict later onsets of heart disease or diabetes\nwould strengthen the evidence for BPA playing a causal role. More\nwork is also needed to understand the mechanisms of effect\nunderlying the BPA exposure heart disease association, including\nin vitro and in vivo studies.\nConclusions\nUrinary BPA concentrations in the NHANES adult population\nreplicated earlier findings that higher urinary concentrations of\nBisphenol A are associated with an increased prevalence of\ncoronary heart disease.\nAssociations between urinary BPA concentration and diabetes\nor liver enzyme increases were not statistically significant in 2005/\n06, but confidence intervals were wide and associations remained\nin pooled data.
