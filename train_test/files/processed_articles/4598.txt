The present study, which was conducted in two Sri Lankan Sinhala-medium rural schools, is a case study in which\nthe classroom observation, interviewing of the participants, and videotaping of students' interaction were included as data\ncollection tools. The spoken data were analyzed using the Communicative Orientation of Language Teaching (COLT) scheme\ndesigned by Fr\u00f6hlich, Spada, and Allen, while the numerical data obtained from the structured speaking test (Cambridge\nKey English for Schools Test) were analyzed using independent samples t test. The findings of the study indicate that the\ninstructional method used by English teachers does not provide the learners with adequate input of the target language to\nimprove their oral communication skills in rural school contexts. As a result, a majority of students from rural schools in Sri\nLanka demonstrate a limited or a low proficiency level in oral communication in English. Therefore, possible reasons for the\nlack of greater awareness towards more communicative teaching are discussed, and suggestions for promoting changes in\nteaching English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in rural school contexts are offered.\n",

Some studies that investigated the stu-\ndents' English proficiency in rural schools report that those\nstudents show relatively low or limited proficiency in English\nin general and in oral proficiency in particular (Karunaratne,\nEnglish to students in rural schools, the present study aims to\ninvestigate why a majority of students fail to achieve oral\nproficiency in the target language and how this problem is\naddressed in the domain of teaching English as a second lan-\nguage (ESL) in Sri Lankan context.\nResearch Problem\nIn most of the Sinhala-medium government schools (72%;\nMinistry of Education Sri Lanka, 2008) in Sri Lanka, English\nis taught as compulsory foreign language commencing from\nGrades 1 to 12. For classroom instruction, teachers use gov-\nernment textbooks, which are freely distributed to students.\nFor English language education, the Educational Publications\nDepartment provides teaching and learning materials for all\nschool grades. The materials consist of a pupil's book, work-\nbook, and a teacher's instructional manual. Sri Lankan stu-\ndents generally study English during their school period and\nalso receive opportunities to study various English courses at\nuniversity or other higher education institutions, provided\nthey gain entry into one of them through competitive exams.\nDespite all the opportunities and facilities which Sri Lankan\nstudents have for learning English, a majority of them, espe-\ncially rural students, do not gain mastery in oral proficiency\nreport mentions that the school completers and graduates\nhave low generic skills in English language fluency and\ninformation technology (IT), which are demanded by the\nlabor market, and as a result, they have to remain unem-\nployed even though they are educated.\nThe researcher's observations and the analysis of the data\ngathered from classroom teacher\u00adlearner interaction and\nreviewing the literature related to the current study have\n1Shinas College of Technology, Sultanate of Oman\nCorresponding Author:\nSarath Withanarachchi Samaranayake, Shinas College of Technology,\nAl-Aqr, P.O.

Therefore, students who study\nEnglish in such a background as described above find it dif-\nficult to engage fluently and accurately in conversations in\nreal-world situations. As a majority of students from rural\nareas fail to achieve oral proficiency in the target language in\nschool context, the present study was undertaken to investi-\ngate the factors that negatively affect learners achieving oral\nproficiency in English. Based on the findings, the present\nstudy suggests possible ways and means to improve teaching\nmaterials and the instructional practices that can help low\nachievers develop their oral communication skills. To engage\nwith the research problem as stated above, two research\nquestions were formulated as below.\nResearch Questions\nResearch Question 1: Why do a majority of students in\nrural schools show a low or limited oral proficiency in the\ntarget language?\nResearch Question 2: Do teachers of English in rural\nschools use the communicative language teaching (CLT)\napproach in their classroom teaching?\nTo answer the research questions as stated above, two\nhypotheses were postulated.\nResearch Hypothesis\nHypothesis 1: A majority of students studying in rural\nschools have a low or limited oral proficiency in the target\nlanguage.\nHypothesis 2: A majority of English teachers teaching in\nrural schools use the CLT approach in their classroom\nteaching.\nObjectives of the Study\nBy conducting this study, the researcher hoped to achieve the\nfollowing objectives:\n1. To find out why a majority of students in rural schools\nfail to achieve oral proficiency in the target language\nand suggest practicable measures.\n2. To examine the extent to which the instructional\npractices help learners develop their oral proficiency\nin the target language in such contexts as stated\nabove.\n3. To inform the English teachers, English language\ntraining (ELT) material producers, authorities, and\npolicy makers who are responsible for English edu-\ncation in Sri Lanka the extent to which the current\nELT teaching and learning materials used in govern-\nment schools are deviant from the pedagogical views\nof second-language acquisition (SLA) and how this\ngap is bridged.\nLiterature Review\nThis section focuses on theoretical base of communication\nskills and a brief description of CLT, and then provides a\ngeneral overview of empirical and pedagogical aspects of\nteaching oral English to ESL/English as a Foreign Language\n(EFL) learners. Moreover, the studies that have investigated\nthe instructional practices used in L2 classroom teaching in\nSri Lankan context are explored with reference to published\nliterature and their relevance to the current study.\nTheories of Basic Communication Skills\nAccording to Canale and Swain (1980), a theory of basic\ncommunication skills can be ascribed to one that empha-\nsizes the minimum level of (mainly oral) communication\nskills that a learner is required to cope with the most com-\nmon second/foreign language situations the learner is\nlikely to encounter. They, furthermore, suggest that more\neffective second-language training can take place if\nemphasis is placed on the meaning of the message rather\nthan on the grammatical appropriateness of one's utter-\nances. As a result of research on applied linguistics, psy-\nchology, and sociolinguistics, a lot of changes have taken\nplace in the field of second-language learning and teach-\ning. As Brown (2000) puts it, \"Foreign language learning\nstarted to be viewed not just as potentially predictable\ndevelopmental process but also as the creation of meaning\nthrough interactive negotiation among the learners\"\n(p. 245). Thus, the concept of communicative competence\n(Hymes, 1972) became established, and the CLT approach\nreplaced the traditional teaching methods used in most L2\nteaching contexts.\nIn general, CLT involves developing language profi-\nciency through interactions embedded in meaningful con-\ntexts. This approach to teaching provides authentic\nopportunities for learning that go beyond repetition and\nmemorization of grammatical patterns in isolation.\nAccording to adherents of CLT, the central concept of the\ncommunicative approach to language teaching is to develop\ncommunicative competence in the learners, so that they\nwill be able to understand and use language appropriately\nto communicate in real-world and academic environments.\nEven though CLT is not the only language teaching\napproach that can account for success in L2 acquisition,\nmost of the language teaching techniques (information gap\nactivities, language games, role-plays, and simulations) and\nthe type of materials (mostly authentic) used in CLT class-\nrooms, where ESL/EFL learners had limited chances to use\nthe target language, have been found helpful in that learners\nhave been able to develop proficiency in the target language\nSamaranayake 3\nTeaching Oral English\nAs discussed above, the main objective of teaching oral com-\nmunication skills to learners is to make them competent\nusers of a target language. It is evident that most rural stu-\ndents in Sri Lanka can read and write in English, but they do\nThey need to learn how to communicate in real-world situa-\ntions such as workplace, school, and other life-related events.\nGiven the present status of oral communication skills of the\nlinguistically disadvantaged rural students of Sri Lanka, it\nseems necessary for English teachers to figure out ways and\nmeans through which they can help their learners to improve\noral proficiency in the target language. To this end, teachers\ncan easily use several classroom techniques as suggested in\nCLT (role-plays, language games, information gap activities,\nand authentic materials) where learners will find the samples\nof real language spoken by real people outside the class. The\nidea of exposure to authentic materials is important in Sri\nLankan rural context as most students have limited opportu-\nnities for practicing the target language outside the class-\nroom. Several authors (Crookall & Oxford, 1990;\nrole-playing activities can provide learners with opportuni-\nties for them to engage in modified interaction with their\npeers and the teacher. Moreover, Crookall and Oxford (1990)\nand Littlewood (1992) have asserted that role-plays not only\nhelp learners develop their oral proficiency in the target lan-\nguage but they also provide opportunities for students to\nappropriate the kinds of linguistic behavior patterns which\nthey will need to produce outside the classroom.\nEmpirical Evidence of L2 Instructional Practice in\nSri Lanka\nThe studies cited below are similar to the current study in\nsome aspects. In a school-based study conducted by\nKarunaratne (2003), it has been reported that the teaching\nstyles adapted by teachers were not in line with the CLT\napproach and that the teachers heavily depended on the\nEnglish textbook. Therefore, in classroom teaching, no\nauthentic, teacher-prepared material or communicative\nactivities were used. The researcher concluded that the\nteacher\u00adstudent interaction was completely in their native\nlanguage. Therefore, learners received no opportunity to\nimprove their communication skills in the target language.\nA similar study, which was conducted by Perera (2001) to\nfind out the role of classroom interaction in L2 acquisition\nin Sri Lankan secondary school context, has found similar\nresults to those of Karunaratne's study. However, Perera\n(2001) used the Communicative Orientation of Language\nTeaching (COLT) scheme same as the researcher of the\ncurrent study did in classroom observation and found that\nsome teachers were not proficient enough to deliver lesson\neffectively in that they resorted to use the native language\nto explain the lesson. One of the weaknesses in both stud-\nies cited above is that both studies were conducted in urban\ncontexts where more facilities and opportunities to learn\nEnglish are readily available than in rural and semi-urban\ncontexts. However, the present study was conducted in\nrural school contexts.\nMethod\nIn this study, a mixed-methods research framework was\nused to investigate the type of teaching practices used by\nEnglish teachers in rural school context. The design of the\nresearch entailed a case study in which classroom observa-\ntion, interviewing of the participants (students), and video-\ntaping of students' interaction were included as research\ninstruments to gather data. The data gathered from the\nthree research instruments were analyzed qualitatively and\nquantitatively to answer the research questions posed in\nthe study. The study was conducted in two Sinhala-medium\nstate rural schools in Sri Lanka in two consecutive days in\nDecember 2015. The two schools were selected based on\nthe common assumption that students in rural schools fail\nto achieve oral proficiency in the target language even\nthough they can achieve proficiency in reading and\nwriting.\nParticipants of the Study\nThe participants in this study were school children studying\nin Grade 10 from two Sri Lankan state schools; as noted\nabove, both schools were from a rural area. The two schools\nare named A and B hereafter for identification purpose. The\nGrade 10 students from School A consisted of 11 boys and\nGrade 10 students from School B consisted of 14 boys and\n15 girls making a total of 29 students aged 15. All students\nfrom both schools belong to Sinhala ethnic group. Moreover,\nthe structured interview conducted with the students\nrevealed that most of the students in both schools come\nfrom low-income-generating families. These students have\nless or no opportunities to hear or use English except in the\nclassroom.\nData Collection Tools\nIn this study, to gather data, three research tools were used as\nfollows:\nClassroom observation: As noted above, classroom obser-\nvations were conducted in two schools (Grade 10) in two\ndifferent days, and each observation lasted 40 to 45 min.\nVideotaping of the students' interactions: Two teaching\nsessions were video recorded from the beginning to the\nend, and later the classroom data were transcribed and\nanalyzed using the COLT scheme designed by Fr\u00f6hlich,\n4 SAGE Open\nSpada, and Allen (1985) to identify the communicative\nfeatures of the lessons.\nStructured interview (students): To test the basic commu-\nnication abilities of the learners, the speaking test of the\nCambridge Key English for Schools Test (Cambridge\nEnglish: Key English Test, n.d.) was used because\nCambridge English: Key (KET) is an elementary level\nqualification set at Level A2 of the Common European\nFramework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).\nHowever, in Part 2 of the test, some adaptations were\nmade to suit the learners' social context.\nProcedure of the Data Collection\nAfter obtaining permission from the principal and the teacher,\nthe researcher first observed a lesson conducted at School A\nby a male English teacher for Grade 10 students. It was a\nspeaking activity in which one student interviewed his or her\nfriend to find out his future plans after he or she leaves the\nschool. The lesson was video recorded from the beginning to\nthe end. After the lesson, the researcher, with the teacher's\npermission, selected 15 students (seven boys and eight girls)\nrandomly from the same class, and they were interviewed\nafter the school in their classroom. The same procedure was\nfollowed with School B to gather research data.\nEthical Consideration\nThe researcher obtained the permission from the principals\nof the two schools after explaining the purpose of the study,\nand then met the two teachers and explained to them the pur-\npose of the research. The two teachers voluntarily agreed to\nconduct lessons for the researcher to observe and video\nrecord the classroom activities. For ethical reasons, the\nteachers and the students were informed that the data col-\nlected from them would be used for study purposes only.\nFurthermore, the researcher got the participants' permission\nto publish the date (samples of spoken data) anonymously in\nany referred local or international journal.\nData Analysis\nAnalysis of the Data Collected Through Class\nObservation From Students in Both Schools\nAnalysis of the data of the classroom interactions of both\nschools was done by using the COLT scheme designed by\nFr\u00f6hlich et al. (1985). The COLT scheme was selected to ana-\nlyze the classroom data because the COLT analysis can quan-\ntify the teacher\u00adpupil interactions in relation to the type of\nactivities (group work or individual). In addition, it includes\nthe modalities in which the students were engaged in each\nlesson as well as the type of learning materials and the way\nL1 and the target language were used in the class. Moreover,\nthe COLT scheme can address the research questions posed at\nthe beginning of this study. Finally, the analyses of the two\nlessons and interview data were used to answer the two\nresearch questions posed as well as to accept or refute the two\nhypotheses postulated at the beginning of the study. Table 1\nshows the summary of the lesson conducted in School A, the\ntime taken at each stage of the lesson, and the behavior of the\nteacher and the students.\nAnalysis of the lesson using COLT. As Table 1 indicates, the les-\nson was based on interviewing a friend to find out his or her\nfuture plans after he or she left school. The COLT analysis\ncategory \"Participant organization\" provides opportunities to\nanalyze the ways in which the students were organized\nwithin the task. Table 2 shows the participant organization of\nthe lesson as a percentage of class time. The total duration of\nthe lesson was 45 min.\nAs indicated in Table 2 below, the students involved in\nwhole class, pair, and individual work in this lesson. Most of\nthe class time (60%) was spent on student-involved activi-\nties, while the teacher played the role of a facilitator.\nIndividual and pair work occupied the 48% of the class time.\nMost students involved in the activity, and only four pairs\ncould not present their interviews due to time constraints.\nAs noted above, according to the COLT scheme, the next\ncategory is material which is discussed below. The teacher\nused the pupils' textbook to teach the lesson. Table 3 indi-\ncates the main modality for the majority of students as a\npercentage of class time. According to Table 3, most stu-\ndents spent a good amount of class time (40%) for speaking,\nwhile this lesson also involved the students in listening\nof the class time.\nThe content category in COLT scheme refers to the subject\nmatter of the activities. It includes what the teacher and the\nstudents were talking, reading, writing about, or listening.\nThe content of the lesson was an interview to find out what\nthey wanted to do after they left school. The teacher used sev-\neral structural patterns to ask questions and also to answer\nthem using different structures such as I wish to be/I would\nlike to be/I plan to do/I am going to be. The topic for the inter-\nview was selected from the class textbook (Educational\nPublications Department\u00adSri Lanka, 2014). Concerning com-\nmunicative activities embedded in the materials, it can be said\nthat this particular lesson was communicative, in that it\nincluded an information gap activity in which one student\nknew something (what he or she was going to be in the future)\nwhile the other did not know. Moreover, the speaker had a\nchoice of what he or she would say and how he or she would\nsay it (I wish to be/I would like to be/I plan to do). According\nto Johnson and Morrow (1981), another communicative fea-\nture of the activity above is the feedback, which the speaker\nreceives from his or her listener (Johnson & Morrow, 1981).\nDuring the presentation, it was observed that several students\nwho played the role of interviewer provided the interviewee\nwith feedback using utterance such as \"Really, that's great,\"\n\"I'm happy to hear that you want to be a nurse. I also like to\nhelp sick people.\" Moreover, the situation presented in the\nSamaranayake 5\nTable 1.

Gets students elicit language used\nwhen interviewing someone to ask about his or\nher future plans: \"What are you going to do after\nyou leave school?\" \"What is your ambition in the\nfuture?\" \"What do you hope to do in the future\nafter leaving school?\"\nListen to the teacher and answer\nteacher's question in L1 from time\nto time.\n 4 Speaks out the questions which are supposed to be\nused by the interviewer and writes them on the\nblackboard one by one. Teacher names a student\nand asks, \"What are you going to do after you leave\nschool?\" Teacher praises the boy who answered his\nquestion and asks a girl the same question.\nStudents repeat the questions after\nthe teacher and keep silent. A boy\nstands and answers, \"Business\"\nThe girl says that she wants to be a\nnurse in the future.\n 5 Teacher says, \"Now we will learn how to answer\nthe question,\" \"What are you going to do after\nyou leave school?\" in different ways. Teacher\nintroduces different structures such as \"I wish to\nbe a businessman,\" \"I would like to be an engineer,\"\n\"I plan to be a doctor.\" Teacher writes these\nstructures as full sentences on the blackboard.\nStudents write them down in their\nnote books.\n 4 Teacher asks the class to open their English textbook\nand refer to page 35. Teacher explains the activity\nto the class in L1 and tells them to do it in pairs.\nTeacher clarifies that they should ask two questions.\nTeacher writes them on the blackboard: (a) What\nare you going to do after you leave school? (b) How\nare you going to serve the country? To answer\nthe second question, you can say, an example: \"By\nbecoming a businessman, I help people to buy the\ngoods they want.\"\nStudents take out the book, refer to\nthe right page, get into pairs. One\nfemale student asks the teacher,\nhow many questions she should ask\nher friend.\n 5 Gets the class to do the interview activity pair by pair.\nTeacher monitors and answers students' questions,\nand corrects mistakes. Teacher limits the time of\nthe activity to 5 min, and after that each pair should\npresent their interview in front of the class.\nStudents write the questions and\nanswers in their note books before\nthey do the interview. They need\nmore guidance for the second\nquestion (How are you going to\nserve the country?) as it demands\nmore thinking and linguistic\nresources.\n 2 After the given time is over, teacher asks the class to\nstop practicing the activity and be ready to present\nit to the class.\nA few pairs say that they have not\nfinished. Others say that they want\nthe teacher to check their answers.\n 2 Teacher asks if there are any volunteers to present\ntheir interview before the class.\nOne pair raise their hands and go\nbefore the class with their note\nbooks in hands, and do their\ninterview, while others are looking\nat them patiently.\n 2 Teachers praise the first pair for presenting their\ninterview voluntarily and asks, \"What about boys?\"\nTeacher does not permit them but asks them to\ncome before the class without being shy.\nA pair of boys ask the teacher if they\ncan do the activity by being at the\nsame place.\nA pair go before the class and do their\ninterview (They look at what they\nhave already written and read out as\nthe first pair did).\n 14 Names another pair from girls and asks them to do\nthe activity. At the end, teacher praises the pair\nand asks to go back to their seats. Like this, teacher\ncontinues with seven pairs.\nThe nominated pair come before the\nclass and do the activity and go back\nto their seats, while the rest of the\nclass listens.\n 2 Teacher announces to the class that he is going to\nstop the activity as the time is over and tells that\nthose who did not present will be presented in the\nnext class. Teacher greets the class and ends the\nactivity.\nThe class greets the teacher.\nNote. Nine pairs presented, while four pairs did not.\n6 SAGE Open\nactivity above is related to real world that students are going\nto experience once they leave the classroom. Adherents of\nCLT favor the idea that the use of real-world activities will\nhelp students transfer what they learn in the classroom to the\n2007). Table 4 below presents the summary of the lesson con-\nducted in School B.\nAnalysis of the lesson using COLT. As Table 4 indicates, the les-\nson was based on how to ask for and give directions in a\ngiven social situation. Table 5 shows the participant organi-\nzation (COLT) of the lesson as a percentage of class time.\nThe total duration of the lesson was 47 min. As indicated in\nTable 5 below, the students were involved in whole class and\npair work in this lesson. A little amount of class time (27%)\nwas spent for teacher\u00adstudent interactions because these stu-\ndents are from Grade 10, and the majority could understand\nthe teacher's instruction although they could not express\nthemselves. Pair work occupied 21% of the class time, which\nis relatively higher than School A. Some pairs were not\nactively involved in the practice stage, and eight pairs were\nnot able to present their dialogue due to time constraints.\nAs indicated in Tables 5 and 6, according to the content\ncategory in COLT scheme, the content of the lesson was to\nteach how to ask for and give directions to people in real-\nworld situations. The teacher began her lesson with some\nquestions posed to the class to identify whether the stu-\ndents could decide what they would do in a situation where\nthey wanted to get to a certain place but did not know how\nto get there. Several students answered the teacher cor-\nrectly, and the topic for the lesson was selected from the\npupils' textbook. The students made use of 48% of the\nclass time for practicing the dialogue and speaking it out.\nGiven the time taken for speaking, it can be stated that the\nteacher was able to achieve the objective of this lesson to a\ngood extent.\nAs noted above, the next category of the COLT scheme is\nmaterial where the teacher used the pupils' textbook to teach\nthe lesson--On Your Way (Educational Publications\nDepartment-Sri Lanka, 2014). The dialogue, which takes\nplace between two boys, is that one wants to drink a cup of\ntea and he does not know how to get to a nearby hotel, so he\nasks the other boy for the directions to go to the hotel. The\ndialogue is scripted, and it is manageable by the students as\nit contains short utterances.\nAnalysis of the data collected through structured interview from\nstudents in Schools A and B. As described in \"Data Collec-\ntion Tools,\" to test the basic communication skills of the\nstudents in both school students, Cambridge Key English\nfor Schools Speaking Test was used. However, it should be\nnoted that these students need to acquire academic lan-\nguage proficiency as they progress from school to higher\neducation because most of the educational and profes-\nsional programs in higher education contexts are con-\nducted in the medium of English. The speaking test\nconsisted of two parts. In the first part, each candidate\ninteracted with the researcher, using the language normally\nassociated with giving factual information of a personal\nkind. Part 2 was based on prompt cards, and the interaction\nwas between two candidates. The researcher read out the\ninstruction and gave a question card to Candidate A and\nanswer card to Candidate B. After the candidates had asked\nand answered the questions, they changed the cards and\ndid the same. Each part of the test was scored out of 10.\nTable 7 shows the descriptive statistics of the speaking test\nmarks obtained by the students in both schools for the Key\nEnglish Speaking Test.\nAccording to the descriptive statistics shown in Table 7,\nthe students in both schools performed equally well in gen-\neral. However, in part wise, the results indicated that the\nstudents in both schools performed well only in the first\npart of the test. When it came to the second part of the test,\na majority of students in both schools did not perform well\nbecause the second part included an information gap activ-\nity in which two candidates were expected to ask each\nother questions to which they did not know the answers.\nAccording to Underhill (1987), these kinds of tasks have\nthe advantage of producing concrete evidence of oral pro-\nficiency or the lack of it. Moreover, the test results show\nthe t value to be 0.66 and the p value to be .50, and these\nstatistics indicate that the two samples are not significantly\ndifferent at p < .05.\nTable 2.

Teacher praises the students\nwho give correct answers to her question\nA few students answer \"Yes\" but others\nremain silent. The students who\nunderstood the question give various\nanswers as it is an open question.\nSome say, \"Ask from someone who\nknows how to get there.\" Others\nsay, \"We can use a map to find the\ndirection to that place\" while some\nremain silent but listening.\n 3 Teacher tells students that they are going to do a role-play\nabout asking and giving directions today. Teacher asks the\nclass to open their English book and turn to page 13 (on\nyour way). Teacher asks the class to skim it quickly.\nStudents skim the written dialogue\nquickly and some say finish, while the\nothers still keep on skimming.\n 5 Teacher asks a few questions such as \"What is the dialogue\nabout?\" \"What are the names of the two boys?\" \"Who\nwants to drink a cup of tea?\" \"Where is Leaf Caf\u00e9?\"\n\"What street does Arjun find when he turns left?\"\nA few students (about four) respond\ncorrectly to the teacher's questions.\nBut most do not.\n 3 Teacher asks the class to listen to her while she reads the\ndialogue loudly, and then the teacher tells them to repeat\nthe dialogue after her.\nTeacher writes the following words on the blackboard \"turn\nright/left, landmarks, pleasure\" asks the class whether they\nknow the meanings of them. Teacher explains the meaning\nof pleasure to them by providing the first language\nequivalent.\nStudents listen to the teacher, and then\nrepeat after the teacher.\nMost of the girls in the class say that\nthey understand the meaning and they\ntell the meaning in their first language\ntoo except pleasure. Students write\nthe words and their meanings in their\nmother tongue in their note books.\n 4 Teacher asks the class to practice the dialogue. First, she\ndivides the class into two halves (boys and girls). She\nassigns Arjun's role to boys and Bhuwane's role to girls,\nand tells the whole class to enact the dialogue.\nTeacher then and there corrects students' pronunciation\nproblems. When the dialogue is finished speaking, she says\ngood, and then students are put into pairs (boys with boys\nand girls with girls) and asks them to practice the dialogue\nseveral times changing their roles.\nBoys start at the teacher's command and\nsay loudly, \"Excuse me\" by looking at\nthe textbook. Then girls reply, \"Yes,\nwhat can I do for you?\" and then boys\nreply, \"Can you tell me where I can\nhave a cup of tea?\" Some boys don't\nsay anything just looking at the text.\nLike this, they continue until all lines of\nthe dialogue have been spoken.\nStudents practice the dialogue in pairs.\n 10 Monitors. Goes to each pair that asks for her help. Uses L1\nto explain the meanings of some words and phrases.\nSome pairs practice the dialogue\nenergetically, while a few pairs do not\nseem to have an interest in practicing.\n 3 Teacher asks the class to stop the activity and tells each pair\nto enact it in front of the class. Teacher starts from the\ngirls who are enthusiastic to come in front of the class.\nThe first pair (two girls) come forward\nwith their books in hands and start the\ndialogue. They speak the dialogue in a\nquite natural manner even though they\nrefer to the note book from time to\ntime.\n 3 Teacher praises the first pair, and then asks a pair from boys\nto come and enact their dialogue.\nBoys show reluctance first but with the\nteacher's repeated requests, one pair\nof boys come with their books and\nread out the dialogue. They are heavily\ndependent on the note book.\n 9 The same pattern follows until the bell rings.

SEM = standard error of the mean.\nFindings\nFindings related to classroom observation of School A. The spo-\nken data gathered from two video-recordings were tran-\nscribed separately. The researcher first analyzed the spoken\ndata gathered from School A using COLT. After analyzing\nthe data, it was found that the teacher used the Audio Lingual\nTeaching method to teach an oral task with some communi-\ncative features present in the lesson. However, the lesson\nwas not fully communicative. Even though the teacher in\nSchool A was quite successful in using the target language in\nclassroom instruction, the teacher displayed some problems\nrelating to pronunciation in particular and language fluency\nin general. Moreover, the students did not speak in a natural\nway where they did not display any features of spoken lan-\nguage such as body language or discourse markers (well,\nright, yes, oh); instead, they read out the dialogue to the class\nby looking at their note books. The activity was based on the\nlearners' textbook in which one student required to ask for\ndirections to get to a certain place, while the other had to tell\nthe directions. In an activity like this, learners should use\nbody language to make the spoken language more meaning-\nful and effective for the listener to understand. Therefore,\ngiven what was observed in the classroom in School A, the\nresearcher believes that the teacher was not entirely informed\nof the CLT approach.\nFindings related to classroom observation of School B.The\ninstructional procedure that the teacher carried out with\nGrade 10 children in School B was not much different from\nSchool A. However, in terms of content, focus, and organiza-\ntion of the activity, it was much better than School A. The\nteacher used the target language in classroom proficiently.\nThe teacher started the activity with a good introduction and\ntried to elicit more language from the class. Particularly, the\ngirls were very interested in the activity and they wanted to\ncommunicate. They got into pairs and practiced the activity\nwith the guidance of the teacher and presented it in front of\nthe class, showing several features of natural speech such as\neye contact and discourse markers to a certain extent even\nthough they also used their note books. However, the boys\njust read their scripts from the note books showing no fea-\ntures of spoken language as most of the students in School A\ndid. It was further noted that boys, except a very few, seemed\nto have no interest in the activity.\nDiscussion\nDiscussion related to the first and second research questions.The\nfirst research question the researcher formed at the beginning\nof the study was \"Why do a majority of students in rural\nschools show a low or limited oral proficiency in the target\nlanguage?\" To answer the first question, the researcher\nformed the following hypothesis that a majority of students\nstudying in rural schools have a low or limited oral profi-\nciency in the target language. This study has shown that the\nstudents in rural schools do not receive adequate language\ninput (Krashen & Terrell, 1983) that leads to oral proficiency\nof the learners. The researcher's classroom observation and\nthe analysis of the classroom interactions clearly indicate\nthat students of the two schools have potential and willing-\nness to communicate in the target language but the pedagogi-\ncal constraints imposed by the teachers were a barrier for\nthem to interact in the class. Another crucial factor that\nemerged from the study can be ascribed to the teachers' fail-\nure to provide learners with communicative activities in the\nclassroom context in which learners can practice and use the\ntarget language with ease.\nThe teaching approach employed by the two teachers in\ntheir class activities was not fully communicative oriented\neven though the classroom in School B displayed some fea-\ntures of communication focus class where students were\nTable 5.

Interaction has been identified as a neces-\nsary condition for language acquisition (Long, 1981; Pica,\n1994) even though interaction hypothesis has been subjected\nto criticism from several theoretical perspectives. The stu-\ndents in School A tended to read out the scripted dialogues\nfrom the textbook, while the students in School B chose to\nread the dialogue which they had already written in their note\nbooks. Given both situations, it can be argued that both\nteachers did not make use of the activities so interactive and\nengaging that learners could not use the target language\nauthentically. This kind of classroom practice will not guar-\nantee learners that they will become proficient users of the\ntarget language once they leave the classroom.\nAs the researcher has argued earlier, neither of the two\nteachers the researcher observed used the speaking activities\nin such a stimulating way that triggers interest in students to\ncontinue doing it. If the teachers had been careful in planning\nout their speaking activities, the learners would have been\nmotivated to do them as if they were doing in real world. The\nteacher who was from School A should have created the\nclassroom into an imaginary town just by moving desks and\nchairs to look like streets of a town and asked the learners to\nenact the situation where a student wanted to find out the\nway to a restaurant. Likewise, the teachers should have cre-\nated several situations where actually people ask for direc-\ntions to get to places they want. Given the factors described\nabove concerning the status of rural students' oral profi-\nciency, the first research hypothesis which the researcher\nformed that a majority of students studying in rural schools\nhave a low or limited oral proficiency in the target language\ncan be accepted. Likewise, the second research question\nwhich the researcher posed in this study was, \"Do a majority\nof teachers of English in rural schools apply CLT approach in\ntheir teaching?\" In order to answer this question, the\nresearcher formed the following hypothesis that a majority\nof English teachers teaching in rural schools use the CLT\napproach in their classroom teaching can now be answered\nwith evidence to prove that a majority English teachers\nteaching in rural schools are deviant from application of CLT\napproach in classroom teaching. The methodology that the\nteacher in School A used, as described in the section\n\"Findings Related to Classroom Observation of School A,\"\nwas the audio lingual method in which a lesson is generally\ntaught using the P-P-P cycle (Presentation, Practice, and\nProduction; Richards, 2006), which has been strongly dis-\ncredited and criticized for its principles are based on behav-\niorist theory (Larsen-Freeman, 2000). The teacher in School\nB used the speaking activity in line with some aspects of\nlanguage (purpose, setting, role, communicative event, lan-\nguage functions, grammatical and lexical contents; Richards,\n2006) that are said to be necessary for developing communi-\ncative competence. The greatest weakness that was observed\nin School B teacher could be ascribed to her negligence of\nthe communicative aspects of language as stated above and\nher unawareness of the extent to which her role as a teacher\nshould change in line with ESL/EFL pedagogy that has\nundergone many changes at present than it used to be a few\ndecades ago. Given the factors described above, the second\nhypothesis which states that a majority of English teachers in\nrural schools use CLT in their classroom teaching can be\nrefuted due to the lack of evidence to accept it.\nLimitations of the Study\nEven though the results of the present study indicated that\nthe oral proficiency of the study groups was low or limited\ndue to the fact that the teachers did not effectively use com-\nmunicative activities in classroom situation, there are limita-\ntions which must be acknowledged. The first limitation is the\nsample selection. Even though the two student samples\nselected from two different schools were from a student pop-\nulation, the sample size was limited to 54 participants; there-\nfore, the results of this study cannot be generalized to a\nbigger population of school students who study English in\nrural contexts in or out of Sri Lanka. The second limitation is\nthat the outcomes of this study cannot be generalized to\nlearners studying in schools with more opportunities to use\nEnglish for communicative purposes. Further research is\nneeded to make a more informed decision as to why a major-\nity of students in rural schools fail to achieve oral proficiency\nin the target language.\nImplications and Recommendations\nIn answering the research questions, the researcher investi-\ngated the classroom practices carried out in L2 classroom in\nSri Lankan rural school contexts and found that the current\ninstructional practices in rural schools are deviant from the\nCLT. The study, furthermore, found that the English teachers\nwere in need of proper training which should coincide with\nthe current theoretical, empirical, and pedagogical views of\nSLA. During the investigation, it, moreover, became evident\nthat the English Pupils Textbook series introduced by the\nDepartment of Educational Publications (DEP) under the\ndirectives of the National Institute of Education (NIE) in Sri\nLanka highly focus on reading, writing, and grammar while\nlistening and speaking skills are slightly tackled and some\nspeaking activities are intended for writing rather than speak-\ning. The instructional manuals produced by the NIE show\ninstances of mismatch with the textbook series where either\nthe material producers or the manual producers have failed to\ncome into a common agreement concerning the objectives of\nteaching and learning the target language.\nConcerning the application, the researcher concludes that\nthe classroom practices currently used in rural schools are\nnot effective in promoting oral proficiency in L2 learners.\nTherefore, the researcher believes that providing learners\nwith adequate opportunities to interact in the target language\nin the class and delivering instruction through unorthodox\nteaching approaches will promote students' oral proficiency.\nMoreover, using learner authentic materials in classroom\nteaching will help learners produce authentic language spo-\nken by real people outside the classroom.\nConclusion\nThis study has focused on the instructional practices of local\nL2 teachers teaching in rural state schools in Sri Lanka and\nits relevance to current theoretical, empirical, and pedagogi-\ncal perspectives of SLA. The study, which was conducted in\ntwo Sri Lankan state schools, revealed that instructional\npractices and teaching materials are not effective enough to\nhelp students improve their oral communication as the teach-\ning practices and materials are rather deviant from the prin-\nciples of CLT. Therefore, based on the findings of the current\nstudy, it is suggested that using unorthodox teaching\napproaches and classroom techniques along with the appro-\npriate materials can help students studying English in rural\ncontexts improve their oral proficiency.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBrown, H.
