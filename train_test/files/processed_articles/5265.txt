Using an in-depth case study of the controversial appraisal of\ncancer drug Herceptin in 2005/6 by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence\n(NICE), the article examines how `resilient' NICE was to external politicisation. It is argued that\nNICE was resilient because it was effectively `insulated' by formal procedures and informal norms\nof deference to scientific expertise.

Situated within the broader `critical' governance literature (Davies\n2011) depoliticisation highlights how alleged `hollowing out' through delegation to\n`arm's length' bodies actually enhances politicians' capacities to institute their ideo-\nlogical preferences within a set of concrete rules and `expert' decision making\nprocedures (Flinders 2008). These become embedded through the process by which\nthose decisions are made to appear unchallengeable or `non-political'\n(depoliticised).\nHow does this process work in practice, though? Do allegedly `expert' arm's length\ninstitutions remain embedded over time, and how are their decision-making pro-\ncesses resistant to challenge? Answering these questions involves, in part, exam-\nining how central state ministers resist pressure to intervene in (`re-politicise') these\n`arm's length' bodies, hence demonstrating their effective `institutionalisation'.\nExisting research has examined depoliticisation as a way of deflecting blame from\npoliticians for policy failure (Kettell 2008) and conversely on the success of\nre-politicisation strategies (Kuzemko 2014). It has not, however, analysed how\nputatively depoliticised bodies are resilient against pressures for re-politicisation in\nexternal policy networks. Hence, the question this article addresses is: how do\ndepoliticised bodies retain and maintain their depoliticised status under conditions\nof political stress? In addressing this question the article contributes distinctively to\nwhat Hay (2014) calls a `second generation' of depoliticisation research. This diver-\nsifies into new policy areas and examines distinctive research questions, but with a\ncontinued concern for critically interrogating the mechanisms that often prevent us\nin democratic societies from seeing substantively our collective choices.\nIn order to achieve this aim the article posits an analytical framework for examining\nthe tensions and stresses on depoliticised bodies, building on Hay's (2007) insights\non pressures for politicisation and utilising literature on policy networks and\nagencification. The framework is applied to an in-depth case study of the contro-\nversial appraisal process for Herceptin, a new biomedical drug for treating early-\nstage HER2-positive breast cancer in 2005/6 under the British New Labour\ngovernment. This case is ideal because it focuses on an ostensibly `depoliticised'\ninstitutional relationship operating within a context of high public pressure. A\ndelegated expert body--the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence\n(NICE)--was responsible for appraising Herceptin for free distribution on the\nNational Health Service (NHS), but there was severe pressure from media and\ninterest groups for ministerial intervention to approve the drug immediately. NICE\nhence provides a critical case of a `depoliticised' agency in a `politicised' context, and\nthus fertile empirical territory for uncovering the mechanisms through which the\n`depoliticised' nature of the institution is sustained in practice. This case is also\nempirically distinctive in relation to existing literature on depoliticisation, which\nfocuses almost exclusively on the economic policy field (Kettell 2008; Rogers 2009).\nIndeed, investigating depoliticisation in health technology regulation has arguably\neven greater pertinence, given the importance of long-term public trust and\nconfidence in organisations like NICE as truly autonomous judges of clinical\ncost-effectiveness.\n\u00a9 2014 The Author. British Journal of Politics and International Relations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of the Political Studies\nAssociation\nAnalysing the case, it is argued that high levels of pressure from outside the state to\nintervene in the appraisal did not lead to intervention--politicisation--in the deci-\nsion making process itself. This is because decision making was highly formalised\nwith strict procedures of stakeholder input, and informal norms of deference to\nscientific expertise created what this article terms `institutional double glazing' that\nprevented ministerial intervention. Formal and informal institutional mechanisms\nhence countered external politicisation to protect the depoliticised body from inter-\nference. In making this argument the article utilises qualitative and quantitative\ndata gathered from sixteen semi-structured elite interviews with critical actors1\nduring the appraisal, analysis of government documents, media coverage, parlia-\nmentary debates and a freedom of information request.\nThis article is hence organised around three central `hooks' or claims to distinctive-\nness at the micro (empirical), meso (analytical), and macro (theoretical) levels:\n(1) Micro (empirical): this article covers new empirical terrain in the study of\ndepoliticisation (health technology regulation) from a novel analytical per-\nspective (examining the resilience of depoliticised bodies).\n(2) Meso (analytical): this article posits a distinctive analytical framework for assess-\ning the resilience of depoliticised bodies, developing Hay's (2007) insights into\n(de)politicisation processes by engaging with cognate literatures on policy\nnetworks and agencification.\n(3) Macro (theoretical): this article offers important insights into the nature of\ndepoliticisation as a process, arguing it is the product of periodic contestation\nand resistance, rather than of top-down ideological assimilation.\nIn making these contributions, this article is divided into six sections. Firstly, it\nbriefly provides a critical review of the depoliticisation literature. Secondly, it draws\nfrom the policy network and agencification literatures, and Hay's (2007) model to\nconstruct a framework for assessing resilience. The third section introduces the\nHerceptin case before the fourth section examines the emergence of an `issue\nnetwork' during the Herceptin crisis, creating pressures towards politicisation, and\nthe fifth section analyses how NICE was resilient to this external pressure, retaining\nits `depoliticised' status. The conclusion then argues for further methodological\nintegration of `depoliticisation' with cognate literatures, building upon Kettell's\n(2008) methodology for assessing depoliticisation strategies, and for further com-\nparative analysis of the nature and form of depoliticisation in different policy areas,\ntheorised as the institutional embedding of particular modes of policy-making in a\ncontext of periodic political struggle and contestation.\nDepoliticisation, Governance and Resilience\nAcademic work on depoliticisation has blossomed in recent years, particularly in\nrelation to governance and public policy (Burnham 2001; Buller and Flinders 2005;\nrange of tools, mechanisms and institutions through which politicians can attempt\nto move to an indirect governing relationship and/or seek to persuade the demos\nthat they can no longer be reasonably held responsible for a certain issue, policy\n\u00a9 2014 The Author. British Journal of Politics and International Relations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of the Political Studies\nAssociation\n`tactics and tools' include, most prominently, the delegation of decision making to\nsupposedly `non-political' arm's length bodies (ALBs), which are widely interpreted\nby the public as being `non-political' (Flinders 2008, ch. 7). Empirical research has\nfocused on the success of depoliticisation (Kettell 2008; Rogers 2009; Beveridge\n2012), how depoliticised policy areas are re-politicised (Kuzemko 2014) and `the\nbroader relationship between depoliticising and politicising dynamics' (Jenkins\nWhile existing research has begun delving into this `broader relationship', it has not\nyet examined how the `indirect governing relationship' identified by Flinders and\nBuller (2006) is maintained, despite external pressures for politicisation. Scholars\nsuch as Moran (2003, 139), for example, note the prevalence of `hyper-\npoliticisation', or how `the quango world (being) drawn inexorably into an increas-\ningly open, partisan and juridified world'. The extent to which these `quangos' are\nable to resist such pressures is a key factor in determining whether they\nare `successful' in retaining their `depoliticised' status over time. Such questions are\nimportant for critically analysing the barriers or obstacles to `seeing clearly the\npolitical choices that govern our ostensibly democratic societies', which Hay (2014,\n310) highlights as a key objective of future research. A central point of this article,\nthen, is specifically to address the question: how do depoliticised institutions retain\ntheir depoliticised status during periods of political stress (crises)?2 This question is\ndistinctive with regards to the depoliticisation literature but, as we shall see, it is\nsituated within a much broader literature on governance and policymaking. This\nliterature offers important tools for addressing the resilience of depoliticisation\nsubstantively.\nThe Resilience of Depoliticisation: Towards an\nAnalytical Framework\nAs the previous section suggests, particular tactics of depoliticisation exist within a\nbroader political context that contains a range of tensions and pressures for politi-\ncisation, and the aim of this article is to bring out how depoliticisation strategies are\nresilient against politicising pressures in a way that existing work only suggests\nimplicitly. A useful heuristic starting point for this task is Hay's (2007) model of\n(de)politicisation processes, shown in Figure 1.\nHay's model posits three politicisation processes. Politicisation 1 refers to move-\nments from the `realm of necessity' where there is no capacity for human action to\nthe `private' realm as actors acknowledge humans have the capacity to govern their\nenvironment. Politicisation 2, movement from `private' to `public' realm occurs\nwhen an issue gains "
