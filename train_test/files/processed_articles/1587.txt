Specifically, the\nrole of cerebrovascular disease mortality as an underlying and associated cause of death was studied. The\nnumber of deaths where cerebrovascular disease was cited as the underlying cause of death declined much\nfaster than the number of deaths where cerebrovascular disease was cited as the associated cause of death.\nThis trend is indicative of a possible change in the role of cerebrovascular disease as an associated cause of\ndeath. Cause elimination life tables were constructed for cerebrovascular disease as the underlying cause of\ndeath and as any cause of death. In the general population, eliminating stroke as a cause of death is\nprojected to have less impact in 1978 than in 1968, for men than for women, and for whites than for\nnonwhites. Tables were also constructed to examine the life expectancy gains for the group of individuals\nwho died of cerebrovascular disease. For these individuals, the gain in life expectancy at birth ranges from 9\nyears for white males to 18 years for nonwhite females.\nTHE MARKED DECLINE in the mortality rates for\ncerebrovascular disease as an underlying cause from\nmented.13 However, a number of epidemiological\ndocumented the facts that a.) stroke frequently appears\non death certificates when some other condition is se-\nlected as an underlying cause of death and b) that\nstroke as a contributing cause of death often presents a\nclinically similar picture to those occasions when it\nappears as an underlying cause of death. Hence, the\nquestion is raised in the studies whether the impact of\nstroke on mortality is accurately represented by under-\nlying cause of death statistics.\nNot only have these epidemiological studies sug-\ngested the necessity of examining the nonunderlying\ncause occurrence of stroke on death certificates but\nthere are many other studies that suggest the necessity\nof using multiple cause mortality data to understand\nthe linkages and interactions between various chronic\ndiseases.\" Indeed the importance of multiple cause\ndata and concepts for examining chronic disease mor-\ntality has been stressed since 1917 with primary limita-\ntions to such studies having been the limitations of the\navailable data system. We are fortunate, therefore, that\nNCHS has recently made multiple cause mortality data\na component of its mortality data reporting system\nstarting with the 1979 public use mortality tapes. They\nhave also recreated the tapes for the period 1968 to\n1978. Thus the recent availability of multiple cause of\ndeath data warrants a review of the recent trend of\nstroke mortality to determine if the decline could be\nexplained by a change in how cerebrovascular disease\nis coded as a cause of death. In addition, despite the\ntrend being well documented, the implications of the\ndecline with respect to changes in life expectancy de-\nserve greater attention.\nFrom the Department of Demographic Studies.

Federal Building. 7550 Wisconsin Avenue, Bethesda.\nMaryland.\nIn order to comprehend mortality trends it is neces-\nsary to understand the standard terms used on a death\ncertificate and how this information is coded. Causes\nof death are cited on two parts of the certificate. Part I\non the death certificate is designed to be used by the\nphysician to list the morbid conditions which define\nthe causal sequence leading to death. Usually, but not\nalways, the underlying cause of death will be selected\nas the condition on the \"lowest used line\" of Part I.\nPart II of the death certificate is to be used by the\nphysician to list any other significant medical condi-\ntions which contributed to death but which were not\npart of the causal chain indicated in Part I.\nIn standard statistical computations all of the medi-\ncal information on Parts I and II is summarized in the\nselection of a single condition to represent the underly-\ning cause of death. The underlying cause of death is\ndefined to be the cause which began a morbid process\nthat lead to death. In this paper, any condition which is\nnot the underlying cause of death is referred to as an\n\"associated\" cause of death. A condition which is an\nunderlying or associated cause of death is referred to as\n\"any\" cause of death. Using the medical condition\nlisted on the death certificate in this way is consistent\nwith the Twentieth World Health Assembly which de-\nfined the causes of death to be entered in the cause of\ndeath statement as \"all those diseases, morbid condi-\ntions or injuries which either resulted in or contributed\nThe improved clinical management of cerebrovas-\ncular events, coupled with an improved understanding\nof the mechanism of these events, has resulted in a\nreevaluation on how physicians view a \"stroke\".\nStrokes are now viewed as both preventable and treat-\nable. If current methods of prevention and treatment\nare succeeding then survival rates should be improv-\ning. Examination of the coding of cerebrovascular dis-\nease as an underlying or an associated cause of death\nwill enable us to determine if part of the decline in the\nreporting of cerebrovascular disease as an underlying\ncause of death is a shift to coding it as an associated\ncause of death. Such a shift might be interpreted as\nevidence that there has been an improvement in the\nmanagement of these events.\nhttp://stroke.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nThough mortality rates for cerebrovascular diseases\nhave declined markedly, this does not necessarily\nmean that the lifetime significance of cerebrovascular\ndiseases has declined to a similar degree. This results\nfrom the fact that cerebrovascular diseases, as well as\nmany other chronic diseases, tend to contribute pro-\nportionately more to mortality at older ages. Hence,\nmortality reductions which increase the number of per-\nsons surviving to advanced ages will tend to increase\nthe lifetime contributions of the major chronic disease\nto total mortality. Furthermore the results of Kuller et\nal.\" are instructive in that they suggest the symptoms\nexpressed where stroke was an underlying versus non-\nunderlying cause of death on the certificate are the\nsame. Hence, nonunderlying cause mentions of the\nstroke may represent as severe and life threatening a\ndisease process as when it is the underlying cause. In\nthis case, for either rate or life expectancy calculations,\nthe multiple cause data would present a more accurate\nperception of the implications of the disease process.\nTo determine the implications of current declines in\nmortality rates for the total lifetime significance of\ncerebrovascular diseases, calculations on the change in\nlife expectancy attributable to the control of stroke as a\ncause of death are presented.\nThe standard measures of the lifetime consequences\nof specific causes of death are calculated in ways that\naverage the effect of the disease over all persons in the\npopulation. Since the mortality risk associated with\ncerebrovascular disease is, clearly, not distributed\nequally over each member of the population, such cal-\nculations do not tell us about the impact of the disease\nupon affected individuals. As a consequence life ex-\npectancy measures are calculated in a way so that they\nreflect the change in life span for persons directly af-\nfected by the disease. This would seem to give a more\naccurate picture of the actual changes in survival that\ncould be expected clinically if the disease processes\nwere eliminated.\nIn this paper, the mortality consequences of cerebro-\nvascular disease are evaluated in three ways: 1) the role\nof stroke as an associated cause of death, 2) the impact\nof recent stroke mortality declines on the entire life\nspan of the general population, and 3) the conse-\nquences of changes in the mortality rates for cerebro-\nvascular diseases on those who would have died from a\ncerebrovascular event. It is hoped that this treatment of\nthe problem will be a more realistic portrayal of the\npopulation implications of the trends.\nMethods\nThese analyses employ cause-specific mortality data\nfor the United States, provided by the National Center\ndiffer from the usual mortality data in that all medical\nconditions reported on the death certificate are coded.\nPrevious analyses have used only the ACME (Auto-\nmated Classification of Medical Entities) coded under-\nlying cause of death. Throughout the study period,\ndata were coded according to the 8th Revision of\nthe International Classification of Diseases, Adapted\n(ICDA). This prevents artifacts being engendered by\nrevisions in the coding scheme.\ncular event. If these codes are not present anywhere on\nthe death certificate, the death is considered to be non-\nstroke related. The reason for using the total range\nprecision of specific subdiagnoses. Furthermore, for\nmany national health policy decisions it is a trend in the\noverall category that is of most significance.\nStroke is considered to be the underlying cause of\ndeath if one of the aforementioned codes is so desig-\nnated. If one of these codes is present, but not as an\nunderlying cause, stroke is considered to be an associ-\nated cause of death.\nThe results will examine: a) basic frequencies and\nratio measures for stroke as an underlying cause of\ndeath or as any cause of death, b) life expectancy gains\nattributable to the elimination of stroke as an underly-\ning or as any cause of death in the general population,\nand c) life expectancy gains attributable to the elimina-\ntion of stroke both as an underlying or any cause of\ndeath among individuals who actually died of stroke.\nThe analyses are conducted using race/sex specific\ndata.\nLife expectancy (e,) is the expected number of years\nto be lived, on average, after a given age (x). Life\nexpectancy is one of many estimates derived from a\nlife table. The life table is a statistical model which\ncombines mortality data for various age groups.3 Using\ncurrent mortality patterns, age specific mortality risks\nand expectations can be derived from the life table.\nThere are various standard methodologies for calculat-\ning life table functions, and in this paper those of\nChiang6 will be used. Additional details concerning\nthese methodologies are presented in the appendix.\nThe difference between the life expectancy under\nobserved conditions (ex\n), and the life expectancy if the\nset of deaths did not occur (elA\n), represents the in-\ncrease in life expectancy that could be achieved by\neliminating condition \" A \" as a cause of death. As an\nyears. If malignant neoplasms were eliminated as a\ncause of death, life expectancy would be 73.2 years.7\nThe gain in life expectancy, 2.4 years, represents the\ndifference between these life expectancies. The basic\nassumption of the cause elimination technique is that\nmortality due to cause \" A \" is independent of the re-\nmaining causes of death. In the present context it\nmeans that the individual who would have died of a\nstroke, but did not, has an equal chance of dying from\nthe other remaining causes of death. An implicit as-\nsumption is that cerebrovascular events would still oc-\ncur but would no longer be fatal.\nWhen calculating the expected impact of eliminat-\ning a specific cause of death, it is necessary to recog-\nnize that the increases in life expectancy are averaged\nover the entire population. This can hide benefits\nwhich accrue only to those individuals who have a\ngiven disease or condition. Therefore, additional cal-\nculations were done to reflect the gain in life expectan-\nhttp://stroke.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\ncy among only those who would have died of stroke.\nWhen reviewing the increases in life expectancy, it\nis important to place them in perspective. This can be\ndone by examining age-specific data and relating them\nto table 1. The life table functions were calculated\nfrom single years of age data, but only reported for\nselected ages. A gain of 6.5 years for a white male\nyears shown in table 1.\nResults\ndardized mortality rates for stroke (cerebrovascular\nstroke was coded as a cause of death.\nwhere stroke was an underlying cause declined by 16.8\nof deaths where stroke was any cause decreased by\nthe number of deaths where stroke was cited as the\nrisen to 1.64. The ratio can be interpreted as meaning\nthat for every ten deaths where stroke was the underly-\ning cause, there were an additional six deaths where\nstroke was an associated cause. The aforementioned\nratio varies slightly by race/sex groups. In 1977 the\nratio for white males was the highest (1.72) with all\nother race/sex groups having a ratio of approximately\n1.61. Thus, the rate of decline of stroke mentioned as\nunderlying cause of death was 52.7 percent faster than\nits decline mentioned anywhere on the death certifi-\ncate.\nData on current life expectancy (ex\n), i.e., how long a\nperson could be expected to live if there was no change\nin the current mortality conditions, for the various age\nand race/sex groups are presented in table 1. As noted\nin the methods section, these life expectancies are the\ncomparison levels from which the gains in life expec-\nTABLE I Life Expectancy (in Years) at Selected Ages, by Race/\nWhite males\nWhite females\nNonwhite males\nNonwhite females\nBirth\nAge\n\u00b7Estimates for life expectancy in 1978 are computed solely from\nmortality and the latest estimate of the \"correct\" population for\ntancy are then measured. The data indicate that life\nexpectancy at birth is greater for whites than nonwhites\nand greater for females than males.\nUnder the hypothetical situation that both the force\nof mortality due to stroke could be completely elimi-\nnated and that the force of mortality due to stroke is\nindependent of the forces of mortality for other dis-\neases, the estimated gains in life expectancy (eK;A\n-- ex\n)\ncan be calculated. Though both these events are un-\nlikely, the figures serve to illustrate the total lifetime\nconsequences of stroke mortality given current condi-\ntions. The elimination of stroke as an underlying cause\nof death, in 1968, results in a gain in life expectancy at\nbirth of 0.90 years for white males. This means that if,\nin 1968, stroke were eliminated as an underlying cause\nof death, life expectancy at birth for white males would\nand 75 the increase in life expectancy remains constant\nat approximately 0.9 years. At age 75 this means that\nlife expectancy would increase from 8.1 years to 9.0\nyears. If stroke were eliminated as any cause of death,\nlife expectancy at birth would increase an additional\nyears).\nThe increase in life expectancy (at birth and ages 45,\nyears for eliminating stroke as an underlying cause of\ndeath and 2.3 years for eliminating stroke as any cause\nof death. Similar data for nonwhite males is about 1.5\nyears and 2.4 years. Nonwhite females showed the\nlargest increase, 2.6 years for underlying cause and 4.3\nyears for any cause. A comparison across the race/sex\ngroups indicates that the gains were smaller for men\nthan for women and for whites than for nonwhites.\nThe increases in life expectancy are smaller in 1978\nthan in 1968; reflecting the decline in mortality. If\nstroke were eliminated as a cause of death in 1978, the\nincrease in life expectancy among white males would\nbe approximately 0.7 years for underlying cause and\n1.3 years for any cause. Among white females the\nincrease would be 1.2 years and 2.0 years. Among\nnonwhite males the increase would be 1.1 and 1.9\nyears, respectively. Nonwhite females would still\nexperience the largest increase, 1.9 years and 3.3\nyears.\nThe aforementioned calculations are useful for re-\nflecting on the aggregate total effect of stroke mortal-\nity. However, the results are somewhat artificial, since\nthe effects of eliminating stroke mortality are averaged\nover the entire population. In order to understand the\nimpact of mortality for cerebrovascular disease, it is\nnecessary to examine a life table which represents the\nmortality conditions only among individuals who died\nof stroke (table 2).\nTo aid in comprehending this table another life table\nfunction, lx\n, is introduced. The function lx\nrepresents\nthe number of deaths, attributable to a specific cause,\nthat would occur at and after age x, if the current\nmortality conditions did not change.

By 1978 this\nwould have declined to 7,820 deaths. As is indicated\nby the data in the table, nonwhite females had the\nlargest number of people dying from stroke, and for\neach race/sex group the numbers were lower in 1978\nthan in 1968. The data also indicate that, for white\nstroke related deaths occurred after age 60. Compara-\nble percentages for white females, nonwhite males,\nThe data on strokes can be compared to data for all\ndeaths resulted from stroke as an underlying cause of\ndeath and 15.0 percent of all deaths occurred with\nstroke as any cause of death. This declined to 7.8 and\nutable to stroke increases with age. Among those indi-\nviduals age 75 and over the percentages are 11.4 and\nstroke related for white females, nonwhite males, and\nand 26.1 percent of all deaths respectively.\nIn Table 2, e, is interpreted as the average age of\ndeath due to stroke in a cohort subject to the current\nstroke mortality conditions. Thus, the average age at\ndeath for white males with stroke as an underlying\ncal to the average age for nonwhite females, five years\ngreater than the average age for nonwhite males, and\nfive years less than the average age for white females.\nBy 1978, as a result of the decline in stroke mortality,\nthe average age at death for white males and white\nfemales increased by two years, while the average age\nfor nonwhites increased more dramatically (4.5 years\nfor nonwhite females and 3 years for nonwhite males).\nThe data in table 3 represent the hypothetical situa-\ntion of Table 2 applied to the population in table 2, i.e.,\nthe expected increase in life expectancy among per-\nsons who died of stroke, if stroke were eliminated as a\ncause of death. The gains noted in this table are 5 to 7\ntimes greater than the gains noted for the general popu-\nlation. These data indicate that if stroke were eliminat-\ned as a cause of death in 1968, a white male who would\nhave died of stroke could be expected to live an addi-\n1978.

This was observed in each of the\nrace/sex groups, with the largest percentage declines\nbeing observed among the Birth--64 age group. This\nprobably implies either a decline in incidence coupled\nwith a decline in case fatality rates, or just a large\ndecline in case fatality rates. However, between 1968\nand 1978, not all age groups displayed a decline. The\n85 + age group registered an increase in the number of\ndeaths citing stroke as the underlying cause of death\nand as any cause of death. This increase was observed\nfor each race/sex group, except white males. For white\nand nonwhite females this increase was quite substan-\ntial (37 and 28 percent). This increase is significant\nfrom a public health viewpoint. In 1978, one-third of\nall stroke related deaths among white females occur to\nindividuals aged 85 and over, and half of all the stroke\nrelated deaths occur to white females. Therefore, an\nincrease in the number of stroke related deaths among\nwhite females aged 85 and over has a major impact\nupon the general stroke mortality rates.\nratio of stroke deaths cited as underlying cause versus\nany cause. The implication is that there was a shift in\ncoding of stroke away from an underlying cause and\ntowards an associated cause of death. One explanation\nof such a shift would be that there was improved sur-\nvival from stroke during the period. There is some\nevidence to indicate that, at least for cerebral infarc-\ntions, this may have been the case.8 In addition, the\ngeneral decline in death rates resulted in an increase in\nthe median age at death. The data indicate that, after\nage 45, the mean number of conditions reported on the\ndeath certificates goes up with age. This could be inter-\npreted, in layman's terms, that with increasing age\nthere are more things that go wrong with the body.\nGiven this, then there are more causes of death to\nchoose from as the underlying cause, and the proba-\nbility of stroke being the underlying cause would\ndecrease while the probability of stroke being an asso-\nciated cause of death would increase. Thus a nonun-\nderlying cause mention of stroke at more advanced\nages could represent a morbid process equally as seri-\nous as those occurrences when it is the underlying\ncause of death.\"\npercent in the rate of stroke mortality as an underlying\ncause of death. Since the mortality rate was declining,\nthe gains in life expectancy in 1978 should be less than\nthose in 1968. It was anticipated that the change in the\nlife expectancy gains would be strongly related to the\ndrop in mortality; however, the life expectancy gains at\nbirth decreased only moderately (16 to 27 percent).\nComparable data for stroke as any cause of death are\n14 to 23 percent. The smaller decline in life expectan-\ncy gains for any cause is another reflection of the shift\nin coding of stroke as an associated cause of death\nrather than as an underlying cause of death. It is un-\nclear as to why the decline in the gain in life expectan-\ncy is so much less than that for stroke mortality, but\nthis is probably related to the generally old age of the\nsurvivors.\nThe smallest change for life expectancy was ob-\nserved among white females. This possibly results\nfrom the large increase in stroke related deaths among\nthe 85 + age group for white females (see above), and\nthe modest increase for the 75-84 age group.\nLife expectancy measures have been used to argue\nthat the control of chronic disease will have only a\nmodest impact on the health of the population, since\nthere is usually only a small number of years of life\nexpectancy gain associated with the elimination of\nthese conditions. This statement is true when referring\nto life expectancy at birth. However, in 1978, nearly\n85 percent of all stroke deaths were to individuals aged\nhttp://stroke.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\n65 and over. Elimination of stroke as a cause of death\nhas minimal impact until the later years of life, and\ntherefore the reference point should be moved to re-\nflect this. Since the added number of years an individ-\nual could expect to survive remains fairly constant to\nage 65, the percentage gain increases with age. If the\nreference point were moved to age 60, then elimination\nof stroke as a cause of death would result in an 8.3\nfor white females, nonwhite males and nonwhite fe-\nmales, respectively. It is difficult not to call these gains\nsubstantial.\nIn addition, if the effects are restricted to the popula-\ntion at risk, i.e., those who died of a stroke, the effect\nof eliminating stroke as a cause of death is even great-\ner. These adjusted data (table 3) show a 14.6 percent\ngain in life expectancy at birth and a 49.8 percent gain\nin life expectancy at age 60, among white males. Large\ngains for the other race/sex groups can also be shown.\nThese adjusted gains are greater for nonwhites than for\nwhites, reflecting the larger mortality rates among\nnonwhites.\nThe frequency of stroke deaths is important to study,\nsince it defines the size of the clinical problem. The\ngain in life expectancy due to the theoretical elimina-\ntion of stroke as a cause of death is important because:\na) it represents the lifetime impact of the disease, and\nb) since it weighs each event by the number of years of\nincreased survival, it portrays the future effect of\nstroke mortality on the current population. Clearly, if\nmore persons survive to advanced ages, proportionate-\nly more people will die of the conditions with the\nhighest forces of mortality at those ages. Thus, the life\nexpectancy gain measure is useful in helping put\nchanges in the mortality risk of a given condition in\ncontext with the age specific changes in risk for other\nconditions.\nConclusion\nThis paper has examined various facets of mortality\ndue to cerebrovascular disease, stroke, and the\nThe number of deaths where stroke was cited as the\nunderlying cause of death declined much faster than\nthe number of deaths where stroke was cited as any\ncause of death; indicating that a change in the role of\ncerebrovascular disease as an associated cause of death\nhas probably occurred. An examination of cause elimi-\nnation life tables revealed that the life expectancy\nchange which could be expected from the elimination\nof stroke mortality had not declined as markedly as the\nstroke mortality rates and that at advanced ages the\nchange was positive. Adjusting the calculations to re-\nfer to those who died of stroke showed that the life\nexpectancy gains of eliminating stroke as a cause of\ndeath would be quite large.\nThese observations suggest that there has been pro-\ngress in the clinical management of cerebrovascular\ndisease; however, stroke still remains a major force of\nmortality. The various measures presented here indi-\ncate that the impact of stroke mortality is greater than\nthat indicated by the underlying cause of death data.\nTherelativedecline in stroke mortality was greater for\nnonwhites, though the demographic subgroup with the\nlargest number of stroke related deaths was white fe-\nmales. Overall, this study suggests that to adequately\ndescribe the population implications of chronic disease\nconditions it is necessary to examine a variety of as-\npects beyond the data relating to underlying cause of\ndeath.\nReferences\nI.

Similarly, definitions for the\nother functions can be derived.\nA further quantity of interest is the life expectancy gain to be expected\namong persons who died of cause A if cause A were eliminated. This\nrepresents the actual gain in life expectancy expected to occur if a\nclinical cure of A were achieved.
