    "abstract": "ABSTRACT There is a growing consensus that activating consumers to\nbecome better managers of their health is an essential component of US\nhealth care reform. We measured how activated blacks, whites, and\nHispanics are--that is, how confident, skillful, and knowledgeable they\nare about taking an active role in improving their health and health care.\nWe found that patient activation among blacks and Hispanics was low,\nrelative to that of whites. For example, 24.8 percent of Hispanics were at\nthe highest level of patient activation, compared to 39.5 percent of blacks\nand 45.3 percent of whites. Among Hispanic immigrants, low accultura-\ntion and lack of familiarity with the US health care system contribute to\nlow activation. The findings indicate that increasing activation levels\namong Hispanic immigrants may be as important as expanding insurance\ncoverage in reducing disparities in unmet medical need.\nMany Americans expect the Af-\nreduce racial and ethnic dis-\nparities in health care, pri-\nmarily by reducing the num-\nber of racial and ethnic minorities who are\nuninsured.1 Much of the attention paid to dispar-\nities has focused on the higher uninsurance rates\nof some minorities. However, differences in\nwhat is known as \"patient activation\" are also\nlikely to contribute to racial and ethnic dispar-\nities in access and health care.2\nPatient activation refers to the knowledge,\nskills, and confidence people need to manage\ntheir health and health care. The Patient Activa-\ntion Measure--part of the Robert Wood Johnson\nFoundation's Health Tracking Household Sur-\nwho score higher tend to be proactive in manag-\ning their health, and those who score lower tend\nto be more passive. Racial and ethnic differences\nin patient activation have been documented, and\nboth blacks and Hispanics have lower activation\nlevels than whites.4\nLess-activated people may have greater access\nproblems because their greater passivity about\ntheir health means that they are more likely to be\ndeterred by barriers to care. They are less likely to\nget preventive services, adhere to treatment reg-\nimens, seek out health information, or ask ques-\ntions during a medical encounter, and they are\nmore likely to have unmet medical need.5\u00ad9 Acti-\nvation levels have also been shown to predict\nclinical outcomes.10\nIn this study we examined differences in pa-\ntient activation among whites, blacks, and\nHispanics. We also examined reasons for lower\nactivation among blacks and Hispanics relative\nto whites, focusing on differences in socio-\neconomic status and immigration characteris-\ntics that reflect differences in acculturation\nand familiarity with the US health care system.11\nFinally, we examined the extent to which racial\nor ethnic differences in patient activation are\nrelated to differences in unmet medical need,\nindependent of differences in insurance cover-\nage, socioeconomic status, and health status.

The survey collected\ndata on all of the adults in each family and one\nrandomly selected child. The sample for this\nstudy was adults age eighteen and older who\nresponded to the Patient Activation Measure\nthe survey was 43 percent. We used survey\nweights to generate population estimates ad-\njusted for nonresponse based on age, sex, race\nor ethnicity, and education.\nSurvey questions used to obtain respondents'\nrace or ethnicity were based on those used by the\n2007 Current Population Survey conducted by\nthe Census Bureau.We excluded from the catego-\nries white and black people who also identified\nthemselves as Hispanic in origin, and we in-\ncluded all races in the category Hispanic. Whites\nwere overrepresented in the sample: About\n76 percent of the sample population was white,\ncompared to 66 percent of the US adult popula-\ntion in 2007. Blacks and Hispanics were under-\nrepresented: They constitute about 10 percent\nand 8 percent of the sample population, respec-\ntively, compared to 12 percent and 14 percent,\nrespectively, of the US adult population.\nSurvey weights used in the analysis adjusted\nthe estimates to reflect the actual distribution of\nthese groups in the population and to account\nfor any differences in nonresponse within each\nracial or ethnic group based on sex, age, and\neducation. A methodological report provides a\nmore detailed discussion of the weighting pro-\ncedures and standard error estimation.3\nMeasure Of Patient Activation As noted\nabove, the thirteen-item Patient Activation Mea-\nsure was included in the 2007 Health Tracking\nHousehold Survey (the online Appendix lists the\nthirteen questions).12 Our analysis focused on\nracial and ethnic differences in mean levels of\npatient activation. However, the analysis also\nincluded racial and ethnic differences in the per-\ncentages of people at the highest level of activa-\ntion, which is often easier to interpret than dif-\nferences in mean scores.\nPrior testing of the Patient Activation Measure\nidentified four levels of activation or engage-\nment, reflecting the fact that people move\nthrough levels as they become better self-\nmanagers. These four levels indicate people\nwho (1) may not understand that they must play\nan active role in their health; (2) lack the con-\nfidence and knowledge necessary to take action;\n(3) are just beginning to take action to maintain\nand improve their health; or (4) have adopted\nmany proactive health behaviors but still face\nchallenges in maintaining those behaviors over\ntime--for example, maintaining a healthy life-\nstyle. In this analysis we focused primarily on\nthose at the highest level of activation: people\nwho have attained much of the confidence,\nknowledge, and skill needed to effectively man-\nage their health and health care.\nOther Survey Measures The Health\nTracking Household Survey recorded respon-\ndents' age, sex, educational attainment (in\nyears), and family income. Health insurance\ncoverage was defined as being insured on the\nday of the interview and was coded as a single\ntwo-category variable indicating whether re-\nspondents had insurance (either public or pri-\nvate) or were uninsured. The survey also in-\ncluded a measure of perceived general health\nand a checklist of the most prevalent chronic\nconditions.13 Access to medical care or unmet\nmedical need was determined using the answer\nto the question: \"During the last twelve months,\nwas there any time when you didn't get the medi-\ncal care you needed?\"\nIn addition, respondents were asked to iden-\ntify themselves as US-born or foreign-born.\nThose who were foreign-born were asked\nwhether they were naturalized US citizens and\nthe length of time (in years) they had been in the\ncountry. Those who were US-born were asked\nwhether one or both of their parents were born\nin the United States or outside of the country.We\ndefined second-generation Americans as people\nwho had one or both parents born outside of\nthe United States. We defined respondents who\nhad two parents born in the United States as\nthird-generation American or higher.\nLimitations As with any research study, there\nare some limitations to these analyses. The data\nare cross-sectional, which means that we cannot\nconclude with certainty the causal relationship\nbetween patient activation and access to care,\nonly that there is an association. We used only\na single measure of access to care--unmet need--\nand the association with patient activation may\ndiffer for other measures of access. Furthermore,\nthe measure of self-reported unmet need did not\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

As a result,\nlevels of patient activation among all Hispanics\nin this study may be higher, and Hispanics' dif-\nferences with whites and blacks smaller, than is\nthe case in the population at large.\nStudy Results\nRacial And Ethnic Differences Average pa-\ntient activation scores for the study population\n(Exhibit 1) are comparable to those found in\nother studies using the Patient Activation Mea-\nsure.14 Both Hispanics and blacks had signifi-\ncantly lower average scores than whites. Further-\nmore, Hispanics' scores were significantly below\nthose of blacks. Only 24.8 percent of Hispanics\nwere at the highest level of activation (level 4),\ncent of blacks.\nDifferences By Immigration Status Al-\nthough there were differences in activation be-\ntween white and Hispanic foreign-born and\nsecond-generation Americans, there were no sig-\nnificant differences between whites and His-\npanics who were third-generation Americans\nor higher (Exhibit 2). But because only 20 per-\ncent of Hispanics in the sample were third-\ngeneration or higher (compared to 90 percent\nof whites; findings not shown), overall activa-\ntion levels for Hispanics were lower than for\nwhites. The sample included too few blacks\nwho were foreign-born or second-generation\nAmericans to enable us to make direct compar-\nisons with whites and Hispanics.\nLower activation among foreign-born and\nsecond-generation Hispanics compared to sim-\nilar whites may reflect the fact that foreign-born\nand second-generation whites--such as immi-\ngrants from Canada or Western Europe--may\nbe culturally more similar to US-born whites.\nIn addition, second-generation and foreign-born\nwhites havemuch highereducational attainment\nand income than similar Hispanics (findings not\nshown). Both factors were associated with\nhigher patient activation across all racial and\nethnic groups (findings not shown).\nExplaining The Differences To examine\nhow much of the racial or ethnic difference in\npatient activation reflected differences in socio-\neconomic status versus acculturation of immi-\ngrants, we used multivariate regression analysis\nto compute adjusted estimates of patient activa-\ntion. These adjusted estimates controlled first\nfor differences in socioeconomic status (income\nand education) and demographic characteristics\n(age, sex, region of the country, and metropoli-\ntan versus nonmetropolitan residence), and\nthen for differences in acculturation (US-born\nversus foreign-born, length of time in the United\nStates, citizenship, and generation).15\nExhibit 3 summarizes the results of the multi-\nvariate analysis. The first adjustment assumed\nthat blacks and Hispanics were similar to whites\non demographic and socioeconomic character-\nistics (that is, they have the same mean values),\nwith immigration and acculturation factors al-\nlowed to vary. Adjusting for these factors ex-\nplained much of the difference in activation be-\ntween whites and blacks. This is especially\nevident for the percentage in the highest activa-\ntion level, where the gap between whites and\nblacks in the adjusted estimates (45.3 percent\nfor whites versus 43.3 for blacks) was much\nsmaller than in the unadjusted estimates\nDifferences in activation between Hispanics\nand whites, however, were still large even after\nwe accounted for differences in demographic\ncharacteristics and socioeconomic status.

Patient activation was included as an\nindependent variable, in addition to health in-\nsurance coverage (coded as insured by any\nsource versus uninsured) and demographic,\nsocioeconomic, and health characteristics.\nThe negative regression coefficients for pa-\ntient activation in Exhibit 4 indicate that for\nwhites, blacks, and Hispanics, higher activation\nlevels were associated with less unmet medical\nneed. The association between patient activation\nand unmet need (accounting for other differenc-\nes) was statistically significant. To quantify the\nmagnitude of the association between patient\nactivation and access, we estimated the percent-\nage with unmet need assuming blacks and His-\npanics had the same average activation levels as\nwhites.16 In other words, how might access to\ncare change for blacks and Hispanics if their\nlevels of activation increased to a level similar\nto that of whites? We also estimated the percent-\nage with unmet need assuming all three groups\nwere at the highest level of activation.\nA comparison of the actual percentage of\nrespondents who had unmet need with the simu-\nlated percentage with unmet need assuming\nhigher activation levels shows that if Hispanics\nhad levels of activation similar to those of whites,\nthe percentage of Hispanics with unmet need\nwould decrease by a fifth (from 11.8 percent to\n9.4 percent) and would be similar to that of\nwhites with unmet need (9.2 percent). If blacks\nhad levels of activation similar to those of whites,\nthe percentage of blacks with unmet need would\ndecrease only slightly (from 13.4 percent to\n12.6 percent), a level still higher than unmet\nneed for whites (again, 9.2 percent). In sum,\nthe findings suggest that increasing patient\nactivation may have a bigger impact on reducing\naccess disparities for Hispanics than for blacks.\nTo compare the association of activation and\ninsurance coverage on unmet need, we also esti-\nmated whatunmet needwould be if alluninsured\npeople instead had coverage. Exhibit 4 shows\nthat in that case, the percentage of whites with\nunmet need would decline to 7.5 percent. The\npercentages for blacks and Hispanics are\nbining increased patient activation with univer-\nsal coverage would greatly reduce unmet need\nfor all three groups and would largely eliminate\ndisparities in unmet need between them: The\npercentage of each group with unmet need\nwould be at or close to 5.0 percent.\nDiscussion\nThe findings in this study indicate that increas-\ning patient activation can be an important com-\nponent of reducing racial or ethnic disparities in\ncare, particularly for Hispanics. Although His-\npanics have much higher uninsured rates than\neither whites or blacks, other studies have dem-\nonstrated these disparities in coverage usually\ndo not explain all of the disparities in access.17,18\nThe findings in this study suggest that lower\npatient activation may be an important reason\nfor greater unmet medical need, particularly\namong Hispanics.\nThese results suggest that strategies to in-\ncrease patient activation among Hispanics will\nalso need to address acculturation to US society\nand English-language proficiency. Evidence that\nsuch approaches can be effective is emerging. A\nstudy that examined the effect of a culturally\nappropriate intervention designed to increase\npatient activation among a largely Spanish-\nspeaking Hispanic population showed improved\nadherence to treatment and increased skills in\ncommunicating and negotiating about the medi-\nRegression Results: Effect Of Patient Activation On Unmet Need, 2007\nWhite Black Hispanic\nAdjusted percent with unmet need assuming the following\nAverage activation level for Hispanics and blacks is same as average for whites 9.2 12.6 9.4\nAll groups have average activation scores at highest level of activationa 6.2 10.5 6.2\nAdjusted percent with unmet need if all uninsured had coverage 7.5 9.2 10.1\nAdjusted percent with unmet need if all uninsured had coverage and all respondents had\nSOURCE Center for Studying Health System Change, 2007 Health Tracking Household Survey (Note 3 in text).

Patients who reported that their physician\nprovided specific help with self-management of\nhealth--such as help setting up an exercise pro-\ngram, instructions on monitoring their condi-\ntion, or assistance in setting goals--were more\nactivated than patients who did not get that kind\nof support.11 Other studies show that programs\nproviding peer support and skills development,\nsuch as the Stanford Chronic Disease Self-\nManagement Program, also increased patient\nactivation.21 Finally, when patients received sup-\nport tailored to their level of activation, they were\nmore likely to increase their activation and to\nhave improved health outcomes.22\nAll of this suggests that delivery systems can be\ndesigned to support patient activation. Ulti-\nmately, delivery systems and providers will need\nto view increased patient activation as an impor-\ntant outcome of care and provide culturally ap-\npropriate supports to achieve this end.\nAlthough our findings show a strong associa-\ntion between patient activation and access to\ncare--independent of insurance coverage--the\ncausal relationship between activation and ac-\ncess is likely to be more complex. Lack of cover-\nage and other barriers to health care probably\ncontribute to low patient activation, which in\nturn reinforces the perception that care is either\nunavailable or unaffordable. Removing eco-\nnomic barriers to care may be a necessary first\nstep, although not sufficient by itself, to increas-\ning patient activation among the uninsured. In\naddition, our analysis did not directly control for\nother factors that contribute to racial or ethnic\ndifferences in unmet need, such as cost sharing\non the part of the insured, the supply and avail-\nability of medical providers, patients' health lit-\neracy, and transportation barriers.\nConclusion\nHistorically, health policy makers have focused\non improving the functioning of various compo-\nnents of the delivery system and on addressing\ngaps in coverage. Yet evidence is mounting that\npolicy makers also need to focus on enabling and\nsupporting consumers so they can be effective\nparticipants in the system. In other words, just\nlike providers and facilities, consumers have a\nkey role to play in an efficient delivery system.\nUnderstanding which groups are less prepared\nto take an active role in their care, and delineat-\ning the consequences for those groups and the\nlarger system, is the first step toward developing\neffective policy. Reform of the health care deliv-\nery system will need to include mechanisms for\neducating and supporting patients who are not\nas well prepared as others to become more en-\ngaged, activated partners in their care. \nThis research was funded by the Robert\nWood Johnson Foundation.\nNOTES\n1 Families USA.
