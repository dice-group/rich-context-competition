Undiagnosed Opioid Abuse; Preva-\nlence; Costs\nIntroduction\nThe abuse of prescription opioids is a major public\nhealth problem in the United States. The 2012 National\nSurvey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) reported that\nan estimated 2.1 million Americans ages 12 or older\nhad prescription pain-reliever abuse or dependence\n(\"abuse\") [1]. Opioid abuse imposes substantial costs\non payers and society. Rice et al. estimated excess\nWiley Periodicals, Inc.\nannual per-patient healthcare costs of diagnosed opioid\nabuse of $10,627 among commercially insured patients\n[2]. A similar study by Rice et al. used a larger commer-\ncial claims database and reported consistent results,\nwith excess annual per-patient healthcare costs of diag-\nBirnbaum et al. estimated that the total costs of pre-\nscription opioid abuse, including direct costs and indi-\nA persistent challenge, however, is that a substantial\nshare of opioid abuse is not formally diagnosed [5].\nDespite a growing body of evidence regarding the pub-\nlic health and economic burden of diagnosed opioid\nabuse, little is known about the burden imposed by\nundiagnosed opioid abuse. Stigma associated with\nopioid abuse and its treatment [6] may hinder the diag-\nnosis and treatment of opioid abuse. In addition, opioid\nabuse is likely to be underreported in administrative\nclaims databases for several reasons, including poor\nawareness, reluctance to put a potentially damaging\ndiagnosis in the patient's record, and reimbursement\nconsiderations [7]. Recent literature has estimated that\nundiagnosed abusers outnumber diagnosed abusers,\nThese ratios represent preliminary estimates based on\nassumptions and the best-available data at the time.\nHowever, they did not account for differences in rates of\ndiagnosed and undiagnosed abuse across payers,\nwhich affect the calculations. There have been no stud-\nies published to date that have empirically estimated the\ncosts of undiagnosed abuse. In the absence of these\nresults, prior research has relied on expert opinion that\nthe costs of undiagnosed abuse are 80% of those of\ndiagnosed abuse [5]. The objective of this study was to\nimprove on the existing literature to more precisely esti-\nmate the prevalence and costs of undiagnosed opioid\nabuse among commercially insured individuals.\nMethods\nData Sources\nTo estimate the rates of undiagnosed opioid abuse\namong commercially insured individuals, we used a\ncombination of NSDUH [9] data on prescription pain-\nreliever abuse and published literature on rates of diag-\nnosed opioid abuse. The NSDUH is an annual survey of\napproximately 67,500 persons sponsored by the Sub-\nstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administra-\ntion (SAMHSA). It is the primary source of information\non the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco in the\ncivilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United\nStates aged 12 years old or older.\nNSDUH respondents were classified as having prescrip-\ntion pain reliever abuse or dependence if they\nresponded positively to several criteria based on the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\n4th edition (DSM-IV) (see further details in the NSDUH\nRecoded Substance Dependence and Abuse Variable\nDocumentation Appendix). The NSDUH also included\nquestions about respondents' general health insurance\ncoverage. For this study, we limited our analysis to\npatients reporting coverage by private insurance\n(excluding patients who also reported either Medicare or\nMedicaid coverage).\nRates of diagnosed opioid abuse among commercially\ninsured individuals were obtained from Rice et al.\n(2014), which used the OptumHealth Reporting and\nInsights (\"OptumHealth\") medical and pharmacy claims\ndatabase [2]. This same database was used to estimate\nthe costs of undiagnosed opioid abuse in the present\nstudy. The OptumHealth database includes commer-\ncially insured beneficiaries (employees, spouses, chil-\ndren, and retirees) of 60 large self-insured companies\nwith locations across the United States and representing\na variety of industries and job types. The data include\nde-identified medical claims (date of service, diagnoses\nreceived, procedures performed, place of service, and\npayment amounts), pharmacy claims (fill dates, national\ndrug codes, and payment amounts), and eligibility infor-\nmation (patient demographics and enrollment history).\nPrevalence of Undiagnosed Abuse\nOverall prevalence rates of abuse were estimated annu-\nally as the proportion of commercially insured individuals\nclassified as having opioid abuse or dependence among\nall commercially insured individuals in a year in the\nweights for the public-use file were used for this analysis.\nImportantly, we considered these estimates to reflect the\ntotal commercially insured population with opioid abuse\nor dependence in the United States, both diagnosed and\nundiagnosed. To verify that the subset of patients\nincluded in the public-use data were representative of the\nbroader set of respondents included in the full restricted-\nuse data, we compared our calculated rates of abuse to\nthe reported rates of abuse published in annual reports of\nPrevalence rates of diagnosed abuse reported by Rice\net al. [2] were assumed to represent the rates of diag-\nnosed abuse among all commercially insured individuals\nin the United States. For details regarding the study,\nincluding sample selection and the definition of abuse,\nsee Rice et al. [2].\nbetween the overall rate of abuse calculated using the\nNSDUH data and the rate of diagnosed abuse reported\nby Rice et al. [2] represented the rate of undiagnosed\nopioid abuse. The ratio of undiagnosed abuse to diag-\nnosed abuse was calculated as the rate of undiagnosed\nabuse divided by the rate of diagnosed abuse.\nHealthcare Costs of Undiagnosed Abuse\nPatients with at least one medical claim linked to an\nICD-9-CM diagnosis code for opioid abuse/dependence\nKirson et al.\n(\"abuse\") were identified in the OptumHealth database\nThe combination of diagnosis codes for both abuse and\ndependence is consistent with recent literature\nby the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-\norders, 5th edition (DSM-5) [20]. Hereinafter we refer to\n\"opioid abuse\" for simplicity.\nBecause the objective of the analysis was to assess\nrecent trends in abuse, patients were required to have\ntheir first diagnosis for opioid abuse/dependence during\n12\u00ad64 and to have continuous non-HMO coverage\nthroughout a 24-month study period to ensure that all\nrelevant drug and medical claims were captured for the\nfinal sample of patients. The \"diagnosis date\" was\ndefined as the date of the first medical claim with an\nopioid abuse/dependence diagnosis. The 24-month\nstudy period consisted of a 12-month period prior to\nthe diagnosis date and a 12-month period following the\ndiagnosis date (see Figure 1). Patients ages 65 and\nolder were excluded from our study, as their Medicare\neligibility may limit the ability to observe all relevant drug\nand medical claims.\nBecause no prior studies have examined the healthcare\ncosts of undiagnosed opioid abuse, this study devel-\noped a new approach to estimating the healthcare\ncosts of undiagnosed opioid abuse. Based on the rec-\nognition that that there is some period in advance of the\nactual abuse diagnosis during which the patient is abus-\ning opioids, it was assumed that the pre-diagnosis\nhealthcare costs of diagnosed opioid abusers could be\nused as a proxy for the healthcare costs of undiagnosed\nopioid abusers. Specifically, we calculated the mean\nper-patient healthcare costs across all patients diag-\nnosed with opioid abuse during a 12-month period cen-\ntered on the diagnosis date (see Figure 1). These\nhealthcare costs represented the mean annual per-\npatient healthcare costs of diagnosed abusers. The\ninclusion of healthcare costs during the 6-month pre-\ndiagnosis period was intended to reflect the fact that\nthe burden of abuse is usually present well before a cri-\nsis event requiring medical care (and resulting in a for-\nmal diagnosis of abuse). This approach is consistent\nwith prior literature [2,8,17]. We also calculated the\nmean per-patient 6-month pre-diagnosis period health-\ncare costs of abusers, and these costs were annualized\nas a proxy for the mean per-patient healthcare costs of\nabusers who remain undiagnosed for a 12-month\nperiod. In essence, for undiagnosed abusers, we\nassumed that the pre-diagnosis healthcare costs would\npersist on an annual basis, as undiagnosed abusers\nlikely avoid the type of crisis event that would lead to a\nformal diagnosis. The ratio of the mean annual per-\npatient healthcare costs of undiagnosed abusers to\ndiagnosed abusers was then calculated.\nAs a sensitivity analysis, we explored an alternative defi-\nnition of pre-diagnosis and post-diagnosis periods using\nnon-overlapping time periods. We calculated the mean\nannual per-patient healthcare costs across all patients\ndiagnosed with opioid abuse during a 12-month period\nprior to the diagnosis date and used these costs as a\nproxy for the mean annual per-patient healthcare costs\nof undiagnosed abusers. The mean per-patient health-\ncare costs during a 12-month period following the diag-\nnosis date represented the mean annual per-patient\nhealthcare costs of diagnosed abusers. The ratio of the\nmean annual per-patient healthcare costs for these two\ntime periods was then calculated.\nHealthcare costs were calculated as the total amount\npaid to the provider by the insurer for all covered serv-\nices, regardless of diagnosis. Out-of-pocket payments\nby patients (e.g., copays, deductibles) were excluded.\nHealthcare costs were inflated to 2012 U.S. dollars\nusing the medical care component of the Consumer\nPrice Index. All analyses were conducted using SAS\nsoftware for Windows version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc.,\nCary, NC).\nResults\nPrevalence of Undiagnosed Abuse\nreliever abuse reported by NSDUH (irrespective of\nwhen the rate was 0.8% (see Table 1). Our estimated\nrates, calculated using the subset of respondents\nincluded in the public-use data, matched the reported\nfigures within rounding error (see Table 1). Rates of\nprescription pain-reliever abuse estimated using the\npublic-use data stayed relatively stable from 2006 to\nrates of prescription pain-reliever abuse also experi-\n(0.56%) (see Table 2). As noted above, this rate was\nassumed to include both diagnosed and undiagnosed\nabuse.\nFigure 1 Study period.\nThe Burden of Undiagnosed Opioid Abuse\nIn terms of rates of diagnosed abuse, Rice et al.\nreported a trend of increasing rates of diagnosed abuse\n(see Table 2).\nFor each year, the difference between the NSDUH rate\nand the Rice et al.

Additional research is neces-\nsary to examine the impact of recent efforts to address\nprescription opioid abuse (e.g., introduction of prescrip-\ntion opioids with abuse-deterrent properties, state-level\nprescription drug monitoring programs) on heroin\nabuse.\nMore recent NSDUH data suggest that the overall rate\nof prescription pain-reliever abuse at the national level\n(irrespective of health insurance coverage) increased to\nAmong commercially insured individuals, the overall rate\nof prescription pain-reliever abuse at the national level\nTable 1 Prescription pain-reliever abuse or\nReported in\nNSDUH\nAnnual\nReports\nPrevalence of Prescription Pain Reliever\nAbuse or Dependence\nCalculated\nPublic-use\nData\nReported in\nNSDUH Annual\nReports (Using Full\nRestricted-use Data)\nTable 2 Opioid abuse rates among commercially insured individuals from 2006 to 2011, NSDUH and\nliterature\nOverall (diagnosed and undiagnosed)\nopioid abuse\nRatio of undiagnosed to diagnosed\nopioid abuse\nKirson et al.\nthe rates of diagnosed opioid abuse among commer-\ncially insured individuals reported in Rice et al.

The\nRossiter et al. ratio was derived from an earlier study [5]\nthe ratio of undiagnosed to diagnosed abuse has\ndeclined considerably over time. The Rice et al. study\nFigure 2 Opioid\nabuse rates among\ncommercially\ninsured individuals\nliterature.\nFigure 3 Costs of\nopioid abusers.\nThe Burden of Undiagnosed Opioid Abuse\nutilized data from 2011, but assumed that rates of\nabuse were identical across payers, including Medicare\nand Medicaid. However, preliminary analysis of NSDUH\ndata suggest important differences in overall rates of\nabuse (diagnosed and undiagnosed) across payers. For\nexample, in 2011, the overall rate of opioid abuse was\n0.6% for commercially insured individuals, 0.2% for\nMedicare beneficiaries, 1.4% for Medicaid beneficiaries,\n0.9% for individuals with other forms of health insurance\ncoverage (e.g., VA, TRICARE), and 1.2% for the unin-\nsured (results available on request). By focusing the\nanalysis of NSDUH data on commercially insured indi-\nviduals, our estimates of the rates of undiagnosed\nopioid abuse among the commercially insured are likely\nmore accurate than previous estimates.\nIn terms of the costs of undiagnosed opioid abuse, we\nestimated that the ratio of the mean annual per-patient\nhealthcare costs of undiagnosed abusers to diagnosed\nabusers was 69.2%. This new approach has several\nstrengths. The period over which the healthcare costs of\ndiagnosed opioid abusers were calculated was defined in\nan identical way to previously-published studies on the\nhealthcare costs of opioid abuse [2,8,23]. Because this\napproach used a time period that is consistent with the\nRice et al. (2014) study, we can apply the ratio of the\nmean annual per-patient healthcare costs of undiag-\nnosed abusers to diagnosed abusers to the excess\nannual per-patient healthcare costs of diagnosed opioid\nabuse of $10,627 among commercially insured individu-\nals from Rice et al. [2]. This yields an estimate of excess\nannual per-patient healthcare costs of undiagnosed\nopioid abuse of $7,354 among commercially insured\npatients. Note that while the previously published papers\nreported the burden of diagnosed opioid abuse in terms\nof excess costs of abusers over matched (non-abuser)\ncontrols, to account for potential confounding factors, the\npresent study calculated the cost ratio of undiagnosed to\ndiagnosed abuse using absolute dollar terms. As the\npresent study implemented a pre-post methodology in\nwhich the costs of the same diagnosed abusers were\ncompared at two different points in time, absolute costs\nwere an appropriate metric as fixed unobserved con-\nfounders were eliminated in the calculation.\nThis approach assumed that the annualized mean per-\npatient 6-month pre-diagnosis period healthcare costs\nof abusers can be used as a proxy for abusers who\nremain undiagnosed for a 12-month period. In actuality,\nhowever, the healthcare costs of undiagnosed opioid\nabusers may continue to increase after the initial 6-\nmonth period, as suggested by the increase in health-\ncare costs from the 6-3 month pre-diagnosis period to\nthe 3-0 month pre-diagnosis period (see Figure 3). If\nthis were true, this approach would be an underesti-\nmate of the costs of undiagnosed abuse.\nThe sensitivity analysis did not use overlapping periods\nto define the pre-diagnosis and post-diagnosis periods,\ncreating complete separation between the time periods\nused to estimate the diagnosed and undiagnosed cost\nof abuse. Further, there was no need for annualization.\nThe 12-month post-diagnosis period was used to calcu-\nlate the healthcare costs of diagnosed opioid abuse.\nHowever, the 12-month post-diagnosis period did not\naccount for the fact that diagnosed abusers may incur\nsubstantial healthcare costs in the 6-month period lead-\ning up to a formal diagnosis of abuse, which are impor-\ntant to include in calculating the healthcare costs\nassociated with diagnosed opioid abuse. In fact, there\nis evidence of rising healthcare costs even before the\nfirst diagnosis of opioid abuse (see Figure 3). In addition,\nbecause the sensitivity analysis used a time period that\nis not consistent with the previous literature, we cannot\napply the estimated ratios to prior estimates of the\nexcess healthcare costs of diagnosed opioid abuse. For\nthese reasons, the core analysis described above is the\nrecommended approach for estimating the costs of\nundiagnosed abuse.\nWhile the healthcare costs of undiagnosed abusers are\nestimated to be 69.2% of the healthcare costs of diag-\nnosed abusers, the higher prevalence of undiagnosed\nabuse implies that undiagnosed abuse represents sub-\nstantial costs to commercial payers. Many payers may\nbe unaware of the substantial burden of opioid abuse\n[24], perhaps due to underdiagnosis of the condition.\nLimitations\nIn addition to the aforementioned limitations specific to\nour core analysis and the sensitivity analysis for estimat-\ning the healthcare costs of undiagnosed opioid abuse,\nthis study has several general limitations. By definition,\nundiagnosed abusers are unobservable in claims data\nas they do not receive any of the ICD-9-CM diagnosis\ncodes for abuse. Therefore, we rely on the assumption\nthat estimates of prescription pain-reliever abuse calcu-\nlated using the NSDUH public-use data capture all diag-\nnosed and undiagnosed abuse among Americans aged\nThis study does not examine potential reasons for differ-\nences in medical costs between undiagnosed abusers\nand diagnosed abusers. The claims data used in this\nstudy do not lend themselves to decomposing the costs\nof undiagnosed abusers as we are unable to identify\nactual undiagnosed abusers (and have to rely on diag-\nnosed abusers pre-diagnosis as a proxy for undiagnosed\nabusers). Future research should examine other types of\ndata (e.g., surveys, medical records) to better understand\nthe costs (and characteristics) of undiagnosed abusers.\nIn addition, this study does not specifically examine\nwhether there have been any shifts in treatment that\nwould affect the medical costs of abuse. We conducted\na targeted literature search and did not find evidence of\nchanges in the treatment of opioid abuse that would\naffect medical costs. However, it is possible that there\nhave been changes over time in the way abuse is diag-\nnosed and treated. It is also possible that new technolo-\ngies may have affected the costs of abuse. Recent\nKirson et al.\nresearch has found that the introduction of reformulated\nextended-release oxycodone with abuse-deterrent prop-\nerties was associated with reductions in rates of diag-\nnosed abuse among chronic users of extended-release\nopioids [8]. Future research should examine whether\nprescription opioids with abuse-deterrent properties\nhave affected the costs of abuse.\nFinally, this study focuses on commercially insured indi-\nviduals. Future research should examine the burden of\nundiagnosed abuse among individuals with Medicaid,\nMedicare, and other health insurance coverage. As\nmentioned above, rates of diagnosed and undiagnosed\nabuse may differ for these individuals, as may the\nhealthcare costs.\nConclusions\nWhile the healthcare costs of undiagnosed abusers are\nlower than those of diagnosed abusers, the higher prev-\nalence of undiagnosed opioid abuse implies that\nundiagnosed opioid abuse represents a substantial bur-\nden to commercial payers. For every commercially\ninsured individual diagnosed with opioid abuse in 2011,\nwe estimated two additional commercially insured indi-\nviduals who were undiagnosed. The decline in rates of\nthe increase in rates of diagnosed abuse, suggests\nincreased awareness and diagnosis of opioid abuse\namong commercially insured individuals.\nReferences\n1 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services\nAdministration.
