Health centers provide a lot of behavioral health\nservices but many have difficulty accessing mental health and substance use professionals for their patients. To\nmeet the needs of the underserved and newly insured it is important to better estimate how many behavioral\nhealth professionals are needed.\nMethods: Using health center staffing data and behavioral health service patterns from the 2010 Uniform Data\nSystem and the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, we estimated the number of patients likely to need\nbehavioral health care by insurance type, the number of visits likely needed by health center patients annually, and\nthe number of full time equivalent providers needed to serve them.\nResults: More than 2.5 million patients, 12 or older, with mild or moderate mental illness, and more than 357,000\nwith substance abuse disorders, may have gone without needed behavioral health services in 2010. This level of\nneed would have required more than 11,600 full time providers. This translates to approximately 0.9 licensed\nmental health provider FTE, 0.1 FTE psychiatrist, 0.4 FTE other mental health staff, and 0.3 FTE substance abuse\nprovider per 2,500 patients. These estimates suggest that 90% of current centers could not access mental health\nservices or provide substance abuse services to fully meet patients' needs in 2010. If needs are similar after health\ncenter expansion, more than 27,000 full time behavioral health providers will be needed to serve 40 million medical\npatients, and grantees will need to increase behavioral health staff more than four-fold.\nConclusions: More behavioral health is seen in primary care than in any other setting, and health center clients\nhave greater behavioral health needs than typical primary care patients. Most health centers needed additional\nbehavioral health services in 2010, and this need will be magnified to serve 40 million patients. Further testing of\nthese workforce models are needed, but the degree of current underservice suggests that we cannot wait to move\non closing the gap.\nBackground\nFederally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) are non-\nprofit, community-directed health centers that provide\ncomprehensive health care to patients without regard to\nincome or insurance coverage. Often referred to as\nCommunity Health Centers or simply \"health centers\",\nthese safety net providers offer primary and preventive\ncare, mental health, substance use, dental, and pharmacy\nservices to patients in high-need communities. Commu-\nnity health centers address the physical, mental and so-\ncial needs of their patients by providing access to\ncomprehensive health and social services.\nHealth centers eliminate many barriers to health care,\nincluding cost, lack of insurance, geographic location,\nlanguage, and cultural competency for America's most\nmedically underserved populations. Health centers care\nfor 20% of all low-income, uninsured Americans, and 1\nin 7 Medicaid beneficiaries [1].

Roughly two-thirds of pa-\ntients are racial or ethnic minorities, and almost one-\nquarter of patients are best served in a language other\nthan English [2].\nEnsuring access to behavioral health services is a par-\nticularly important role for health centers since health\ncenter patients likely have rates of mental illness and\nsubstance use that are greater than the general popula-\ntion. Health centers serve a disproportionate number of\nuninsured, Medicaid insured, and patients below the fed-\neral poverty level compared to other primary care deliv-\nery sites. According to the National Survey on Drug Use\nand Health (NSDUH), these patients are more likely\nthan the general population to have a behavioral health\nsons and those with incomes less than 100 percent of\nthe federal poverty level had any mental illness in the\npast year, and almost one-third of Medicaid and CHIP\nenrollees over age 12 suffered from a mental illness [3].\nNearly 7 percent of uninsured respondents abused illicit\ndrugs or alcohol in the past year [3]. In contrast, 20 percent\nof the general population had any past year mental illness\nGiven the unique potential of health centers to provide\nbehavioral health services for the neediest populations, it\nis important to develop a method for quantifying how\nmany behavioral health professionals are needed to\nadequately serve patients. With no national standard\nfor behavioral health staffing, health centers vary sig-\nnificantly in the type and number of behavioral health\nprofessionals they employ. The Affordable Care Act pro-\nvided $9.5 billion in funding over 5 years through a dedi-\ncated Health Center Fund, beginning in 2011, to allow\nhealth centers to expand their operational capacity with\na goal of ensuring the newly insured would have access\npoints for care. These expansion efforts, which have\nalready commenced, provide an opportunity to plan for\nthe staff that will treat the whole person. This paper pre-\nsents a needs-based method for estimating the behav-\nioral health staff needs of community health centers\ncurrently, and projects the need for additional providers\nas health centers expand to 40 million patients as a fu-\nture target.\nThe numbers of health centers and patients served\nhave grown significantly in the last two decades; there\nare currently over 1,200 health center organizations pro-\nviding care to more than 20 million patients in over\nUnder full funding provided by the Affordable Care Act\n(ACA) of 2010 on top of health centers' federal discre-\ntionary base and mandated Medicaid expansions in\nevery state, health centers would have reached 40 million\npatients by 2015 [6]. Budget cuts to health centers' base-\nline federal funding during FY 2011 significantly\ncurtailed expansion. The Supreme Court's ruling effect-\nively changing the ACA's Medicaid expansion into a\nstate option rather than a mandate will also restrain\nhealth center growth in states that opt out. However,\ncontinued federal and state investments will allow the\nHealth Center Program to grow.\nCommunity health centers and behavioral health\nAt a minimum, all health centers that receive grant\nfunding from the Health Resources and Services Ad-\nministration (HRSA) under Section 330 of the Public\nHealth Service Act are required to provide referrals to\nsubstance abuse and mental health providers. Evidence\nsuggests many grantees exceed this standard. Nearly\nthree-quarters of health centers had onsite mental\nhealth or substance abuse staff in 2010, and they pro-\nvided more than 5.2 million encounters [2]. Among en-\ncounters with a reported primary diagnosis in 2010,\nencounters for depression were the third most fre-\nquent, surpassed only by hypertension and diabetes\n[2]. Given that most patients are uninsured or\nMedicaid-insured, many of these patients likely would\nhave gone unserved. A 2004 survey of health center di-\nrectors revealed that health centers without onsite\nmental health services reported more difficulty\naccessing specialty mental health services compared to\nthose that had these services onsite, particularly for\ntheir uninsured and Medicaid patients [7].\nAlthough epidemiologic evidence suggests a substan-\ntial need for behavioral health services among low\nincome, uninsured, and Medicaid-insured individuals,\nthere are often significant barriers to receiving ad-\nequate treatment. Historically, the behavioral health\nsector has been segregated from the medical sector in\norganization and financing, and research suggests this\nfragmentation creates barriers to identifying and\ntreating mental health problems, especially for unin-\nsured and Medicaid insured patients [8,9] Half of all\nmental health problems in the U.S. population go un-\ndiagnosed, and a significant portion of patients diag-\nnosed with a mental health or drug use disorder never\nreceive treatment [10,11]. Hispanics, non-Hispanic\nblacks, and those with less education are less likely to\nobtain specialty mental health care than the general\npopulation [12-14]. Even when patients recognize a\nneed for behavioral health services, many are unaware\nof their options for receiving that care, or have prob-\nlems accessing the system due to availability of pro-\nUnder the current system, patients who seek behav-\nioral health care overwhelmingly seek it from general\nmedical providers, which have been described as the \"de\ncades of research have demonstrated the inseparability\nof mental and physical health, and new models that\nbring mental health providers into the primary care set-\nting as members of the health care team are proving ef-\nfective at increasing the accessibility and acceptability of\nmental health treatment [20]. In fully integrated care,\npatients become accustomed to behavioral health care as\na \"routine part\" of primary care [21]. Care provided in\nthis manner has been shown to reduce stigma for\npatients, increase patient engagement, and reduce at-\ntrition after care is initiated [22-24]. Rural areas and\nunderserved urban areas also benefit significantly from\nintegrated care, since shortages of behavioral health pro-\nviders create long wait times for patients needing ap-\nDespite a significant number of integrated behavioral\nhealth-primary care initiatives in the U.S., no standards\nexist for staffing. In 2003, Faulkner published a needs-\nbased approach to modeling the psychiatric workforce\nbased on disease prevalence, need for treatment and\navailable resources [25]. In recent years, the federal gov-\nernment has recognized the need for behavioral health\nworkforce planning at the national level to improve ac-\ncess and quality across distributed delivery sites. For ex-\nample, five years after deploying the largest integrated\nbehavioral health-primary care system in history, the\nVeterans Administration (VA) concluded delivery sites\nneed more \"central guidance on best practices in deter-\nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Task Force on Mental\nHealth recommended the DOD adopt a risk-adjusted\npopulation-based model for estimating the number and\nclinical specialty ratios for behavioral health providers in\nmilitary medical departments [27]. The model, the\nPsychological Health Risk-Adjusted Model for Staffing,\nanalyzes input on need for services among Defense\nHealth Plan beneficiaries, provider productivity, and non-\nencounter based factors to project the number and ratio\nof mental health staff needed [28].\nMethods\nWe developed a method to estimate how many full time\nequivalent (FTE) behavioral health providers were needed\nacross the health center program using data on prevalence\nof behavioral health disorders and existing staffing and\nutilization patterns among grantees. Using data on com-\nmunity health center staffing and service patterns from\nthe 2010 Uniform Data System (UDS) and nationally rep-\nresentative data on mental illness and substance abuse\nfrom the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health,\nwe estimated the number of patients likely to need behav-\nioral health care by insurance type, the number of visits\nlikely needed by these patients in a year, and the number\nof full time equivalent providers needed to serve them\n(Figure 1).\nThe Uniform Data System is an annual collection of\ndata by HRSA on health center organizational character-\nistics and performance. Recipients of grants under Sec-\ntion 330 of the Public Health Service Act are required to\nreport UDS data annually. This study used counts of\nFTE psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social\nworkers, other licensed mental health professionals (psy-\nchiatric social workers, psychiatric nurse practitioners,\nfamily therapists, and other licensed master's degree-\nprepared clinicians), mental health staff (certified indi-\nviduals who provide counseling, treatment or support\nservices related to mental health professionals), and sub-\nstance abuse staff from the UDS. The UDS also provided\ncounts of medical patients, mental health patients and\nencounters by provider type, and the number of sub-\nstance abuse patients and encounters.\nEstimates of need for behavioral health services were\nderived from the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and\nHealth. Sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental\nHealth Services Administration (SAMHSA), the NSDUH\nis an annual survey of approximately 70,000 individuals\naged 12 or older across the U.S. on the use of illicit\ndrugs, alcohol, tobacco, and mental health conditions.\nFor this study, the NSDUH provided estimates of past\nyear mental illness and illicit drug or alcohol abuse\nby insurance type, which included Medicare, Medicaid/\nCHIP, private insurance, and uninsured. The NSDUH\ncreates a categorical mental illness indicator from re-\nsponses to survey questions, including total scores from\nthe psychological distress and impairment scales, the\npredicted probability of serious mental illness (SMI), and\nindicators of various levels of mental illness. Categories\ninclude no mental illness, mild mental illness, moderate\nmental illness, and serious mental illness. The NSDUH\ncreates an indicator for illegal drug or alcohol abuse for\nrespondents that provide a positive response to one or\nmore criteria for alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin,\nhallucinogen, inhalant, pain reliever, tranquilizer, stimu-\nlant, or sedative abuse. Respondents are either classified\nas positive or negative for substance abuse.\nWe started our estimation by examining annual behav-\nioral health service utilization at the grantee level from\nthe 2010 UDS (Table 1). The annual number of mental\nhealth visits per mental health patient and substance\nabuse visits per substance abuse patient were calculated\nfor each grantee with onsite behavioral health staff. The\ndistribution of mental health visits to psychiatrists, li-\ncensed mental health providers (psychologists, licensed\nclinical social workers, psychiatric social workers, psy-\nchiatric nurse practitioners, family therapists, and other\nlicensed master's degree-prepared clinicians), and other\nmental health staff was calculated by summing visits\nacross grantees with onsite mental health staff and cal-\nculating the percent of visits to each provider type. We\nestimated the annual visit load for each provider type by\ndividing the number of visits in each provider category\nby the number of FTE for grantees with onsite behav-\nioral health staff.\nEstimating the need for mental health staff\nNext, we estimated the need for mental health services\namong medical patients age 12 and over. We selected\nhealth center medical patients as opposed to all health\ncenter patients (e.g. dental patients) because we assume\nmost mental health and substance abuse patients are\nalso medical patients, and more importantly, because\nhealth centers aim to integrate these services within\nphysical health care to address patients' full and inter-\nrelated health care needs.\nThe NSDUH indicates those covered by Medicare have\nsimilar rates of mental illness to those with private insur-\nance. Similarly, the uninsured and those with Medicaid/\nCHIP have similar rates of mental illness (Figure 2). We\nused insurance data from the UDS to group medical pa-\ntients for each grantee into two categories: 1) Medicaid/\nCHIP/Other public insurance and uninsured, and 2)\nMedicare and private insurance. Applying prevalence data\nof past year mental illness by insurance type from the\nFigure 1 Flow diagram for estimating FTE needed to serve mental health patients. *Psych. refers to psychiatry.\nNSDUH, we estimated the number of patients age 12 and\nover likely to have mild or moderate mental illness , our\ntarget population for mental health treatment. Estimates\nwere calculated for all grantees, including those without\ncurrent mental health staff or patients. We excluded ser-\nious mental illness from this analysis because we assumed\npatients with SMI had a high likelihood of receiving men-\ntal health care in other safety net mental health settings,\nand the median number of visits per patient would greatly\nunderestimate the need for providers to serve this\npopulation.\nUsing the median annual number of visits per mental\nhealth patient, we calculated the annual number of visits\nlikely needed by patients with mild or moderate mental\nillness for all grantees. We divided these visits into those\nprovided by licensed mental health providers, psychia-\ntrists, and other mental health staff using the distribu-\ntion of visits by provider type from the UDS. We divided\nthe number of visits required by each provider type by\nthe estimated annual visit load to determine the total\nnumber of FTE needed per grantee. Provider shortages\nwere calculated by subtracting existing FTE from esti-\nmates of needed FTE.\nEstimating need for substance abuse staff\nWe estimated the need for substance abuse services by\napplying prevalence data of past year illicit drug or alco-\nhol abuse by insurance type from the NSDUH to the\ntwo groups of medical patients, Medicaid/CHIP/Other\npublic insurance and uninsured, and Medicare and pri-\nvate insurance (Figure 2). We excluded patients with\nillicit drug or alcohol dependence from this analysis. Pa-\ntients with dependence are different from patients with\nabuse and likely receive treatment in inpatient specialty\nsettings. Using the median annual number of visits per\nsubstance abuse patient from the UDS, we calculated\nthe annual number of visits likely needed by patients age\n12 and over at each grantee, including those currently\nwithout onsite staff or patients. We divided the number\nof visits required by the estimated annual visit load per\nsubstance abuse FTE to determine the total number of\nTable 1 Annual behavioral health service utilization, 2010\nMedian visits per mental health patient 3.7\nPercent of visits to licensed MH providers* 59.9%\nPercent of visits to psychiatrists 23.3%\nPercent of visits to other mental health staff** 16.8%\nMedian visits per licensed MH provider** FTE 889\nMedian visits per psychiatrist FTE 2,210\nMedian visits per other mental health staff FTE 648\nMedian visits per substance abuse*** patient 5.8\nMedian visits per substance abuse*** provider FTE 1,012\n*Psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, and other licensed mental\nhealth professionals were grouped together for analyses as \"licensed mental\nhealth providers\".\n**Includes unlicensed individuals, including \"certified\" individuals who provide\ncounseling, treatment or support services related to mental\nhealth professionals.\nThe UDS reports the number of patients by medical insurance type for two\ndistribution was used to calculate the number of patients by insurance type\nand over for our analysis, since the NSDUH provides mental health and\nsubstance abuse prevalence data on persons age 12 and over.\n***The UDS defines a substance abuse visit as \"a visit between a substance\nabuse provider (e.g., a mental health provider or a credentialed substance\nabuse counselor, rehabilitation therapist, psychologist) and a patient during\nwhich alcohol or drug abuse services (i.e., assessment and diagnosis,\ntreatment, or after care) are provided\".

Provider shortages were calcu-\nlated by subtracting existing FTE from estimates of\nneeded FTE.\nExpansion to 40 million patients\nWe then used our method to project the need for men-\ntal health providers at health center capacity of 40 mil-\nlion medical patients. Given the Supreme Court's ruling\nof the ACA, states now have the option of expanding\nMedicaid eligibility to all U.S. citizens with incomes up\nto 133 percent of the federal poverty level. Under the\nACA, those with incomes up to 400 percent of the FPL\nwill receive subsidies to purchase private insurance\nthrough the exchanges, starting in 2014. This will\nchange the distribution of insurance at health centers.\nModels suggest the vast majority of new Medicaid\nenrollees will be previously uninsured, but estimates vary\nbased on their assumptions [29]. Research also suggests\nincome fluctuations will cause people to cycle between\nMedicaid and the insurance exchanges as their eligibility\nchanges [30]. Although changes in the ACA and health\ncenter federal funding may restrain their growth, we\nmaintain 40 million as a reasonable patient goal given\nsubstantial levels of unmet health care needs across the\nUnited States.\nGiven the uncertainty over how the ACA will alter the\ninsurance coverage of health center patients, we made\nseveral assumptions for our projection. Since 72 percent\nof patients were below 100 percent of the FPL and 93%\na large portion of uninsured health center patients\nwould become eligible for Medicaid. We also assumed\nthe portion of patients covered by Medicare or private\ninsurance would not change dramatically as the number\nof patients increased. Significantly fewer providers\naccept public insurance compared to those that accept\nprivate insurance or Medicare, giving Medicare and pri-\nvate insurance patients greater flexibility in choosing a\nprovider. We assumed this would remain true under\ninsurance expansion, and that health centers would con-\ntinue to serve a large portion of patients on public insur-\nance and a significant number of patients remaining\nwithout insurance.\nBehavioral health staff for 40 million patients\nUsing the 2010 UDS, we applied the mean percentage of\npatients on public insurance or uninsured by grantee to\nsort the 40 million medical patients into our two cat-\negories, Medicaid/CHIP/Other public insurance/unin-\nsured, and Medicare/private insurance. Applying the\naverage prevalence data of past year mild or moderate\nmental illness and illicit drug or alcohol abuse by insur-\nance type from the NSDUH, we estimated the number\nof patients age 12 and over likely to need behavioral\nhealth treatment.\nUsing the median visit data from our model (Table 1),\nwe estimated the annual number of visits likely needed\nby patients with mild or moderate mental illness, and\nsubstance abuse disorders. We divided mental health\nvisits into those provided by licensed mental health pro-\nviders, psychiatrists, and other mental health staff using\nthe distribution of visits by provider type. We divided\nthe number of visits required by each provider type by\nthe annual visit load to determine the total number of\nFTE needed per grantee.\nNo IRB or ethical approval was sought for this study\nsince it is a secondary analysis of using entirely public,\nde-identified data. We do not display U.S. territories and\nstates with fewer than three grantees to avoid indirect\nidentification.\nResults\nThe results from our model suggested a substantial\nnumber of medical patients age 12 and over likely had a\nneed for behavioral health services in 2010 (Table 2).\nThis included more than 2.5 million patients with mild\nillicit drug or alcohol abuse disorders. Using the median\nnumber of visits per behavioral health patient from the\nUDS, we estimated more than 11,600 behavioral health\nFTE were needed to serve them in 2010. The model sug-\ngested the need for approximately 0.9 licensed mental\nhealth provider FTE, 0.1 FTE psychiatrist, 0.4 FTE other\nmental health staff, and 0.3 FTE substance abuse pro-\nunable to provide onsite mental health services to some\nsegment of their patients in 2010 due to capacity con-\nstraints (Table 2). Across all grantees, an additional 1.7\nmillion patients likely would have benefited from onsite\nmental health services, with an additional 6,992 mental\nhealth FTE (licensed MH providers, psychiatrists, and\nother MH staff) needed to serve them. The greatest ab-\nsolute shortage was in licensed mental health provider\nFTE (4,328). The model suggested a need for as many as\n2.5 times the number of psychiatrist FTE over existing\nstaff across all grantees.\nOne hundred twelve grantees (10%) provided mental\nhealth care to a greater number of patients in 2010 than\nour method identified as a target for mental health treat-\nthe model identified as likely to have mild or moderate\nmental illness. This suggests that patients at these health\ncenters had particularly high prevalence of mild or mod-\nerate mental illness, they treated patients with more se-\nvere mental illness, or patients were treated for mental\nhealth that did not use general medical services.\nexpand their onsite substance abuse services in order to\nfully meet patients' needs in 2010 (Table 2). Across all\nhave benefited from onsite substance abuse services. An\nadditional 1,785 substance abuse FTE would have been\nneeded to serve them.\nOne hundred twenty-two (11%) grantees treated a\ngreater number of patients for illicit drug or alcohol\nabuse in 2010 than our model identified as a target popu-\nlation for substance abuse treatment. These grantees\nserved nearly 44,000 more patients than our model iden-\ntified as likely to abuse illicit drugs or alcohol, again\nsuggesting that some health center patient populations\nhave higher than expected rates of illicit drug or alcohol\nabuse, grantees treated patients with more severe substance\nuse problems, or patients were treated for substance use\nthat did not use general medical services.\nAssuming utilization patterns and provider productiv-\nity remain similar, we estimated more than 27,000 be-\nhavioral health FTE will be needed to serve 40 million\nmedical patients (Table 3). The target number of behav-\nioral health patients would be approximately 6.7 million\nannually. The model suggested grantees will need to in-\ncrease behavioral health staff more than four-fold over\n2010 levels to meet the needs of the additional patients.\nState level findings\nStates and communities vary in their staffing needs given\na wide variety of national, state, and local factors that in-\nfluence provider location and practice decisions. Our\nanalysis also generated state-level estimates of additional\nbehavioral health staff currently needed in order to ex-\npand access to care for health center patients (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study suggested most health center\ngrantees needed additional capacity for providing onsite\nbehavioral health services in 2010, and the current con-\nstraints are likely to be magnified as health centers ex-\npand to 40 million patients. This may be reflective of\nconstraints in the behavioral health workforce in the\nU.S. in general. Shortages of providers, particularly psy-\nchiatrists, have been described, and the workforce is\naging as fewer graduates are entering some behavioral\nhealth professions [31,32]. The need for additional pro-\nviders in rural and less affluent areas has also been well\ndocumented [33]. There are currently no complete na-\ntional data on practicing behavioral health providers, but\nEllis et al estimated the mental health workforce was\npractice psychiatric nurses in shortest supply [33]. State\nand federal programs designed to bring behavioral health\nprofessionals to medical underserved areas, such as the\nNational Health Services Corps, play a vital role in\nTable 2 Estimated behavioral health staff needed to\nShortage\nActual \u00ad\nModel\nresults*\nNumber of\ngrantees\nShortage**\nBehavioral health patients\nBehavioral health\nFTE\nLicensed mental\nhealth providers#\nOther mental\nhealth staff\nSubstance abuse\nproviders\n*Estimated number based on the model used by the authors.\n**Calculated after subtracting out patients and providers in the small number\nof grantees treating more patients than our model would suggest.

As of 2010, the White River Junction clinics\nemployed one therapist, one psychiatrist, and twelve pri-\nmary care physicians for every 14,000 primary care pa-\ntients [26]. Compared to our model, the WRJ clinics\nemployed significantly fewer therapists per capita, but\nnearly the same ratio of psychiatrists.\nOur estimates are shaped and limited by health cen-\nters' current staffing patterns. Communities will need to\naccount for their own local preferences, partnerships,\nand available resources when making staffing and deliv-\nery decisions. For instance, both urban and rural com-\nmunities experience a high rate of psychiatrist vacancies,\nwhich likely will hinder recruitment [34]. For these rea-\nsons, the total number of FTE needed to reach 40 mil-\nlion patients may be more informative than the number\nof FTE for each provider type.\nIt is also important to note primary care providers play\na major role in screening, treating, and referring patients\nto appropriate behavioral health services. They are often\nthe first point of contact for behavioral health needs,\nand they are responsible for most anti-depressants pre-\nscribed in the U.S. [35,36]. Integrating behavioral health\ninto primary care does not reduce the need for primary\ncare providers, but redistributes some of that care as a\nteam of providers shares responsibility for the whole\npatient.\nFuture staffing needs, particularly as more health cen-\nters move to fully integrate behavioral health services\ninto primary care and adopt new patient empanelment\nprocesses, are difficult to predict because staffing models\nand the location of behavioral health service delivery are\nchanging. Health centers across the nation are fully inte-\ngrating behavioral health into routine primary care prac-\ntices and transitioning into recognized Patient-Centered\nMedical Homes (PCMH). Accordingly, the use of inter-\ndisciplinary primary care teams along with more robust\nself-management support and patient education re-\nsources will influence how care is practiced. What is\nclear is the need to significantly increase the behavioral\nhealth workforce, as well as evolving their competencies\nand skills required to effectively function in an interdis-\nciplinary primary care team.\nThere are several issues that must be addressed as we\nwork toward filling the behavioral health workforce gaps\nin health centers:\n1) Behavioral health provider supply: The overall\nsupply of behavioral health providers in all\nprofessional categories will likely limit health\ncenters' ability to recruit providers.\n2) Training and education: The majority of primary\ncare and behavioral health providers were not\ntrained to work together. Retraining providers to\nadapt to the professional culture of integrated\nbehavioral health and primary care will be necessary\nto maximize the effectiveness of the model.\n3) Financing for sustainability: Achieving financial\nsustainability to continue to support integration is\nparamount due to the historic separation of mental\nhealth funding from physical health funding.\nFunding for these services will need to be protected\nagainst reallocation to other pressing needs. This\nrequires continued federal and state investment in\nhealth centers, including the availability of health\ncenter Expanded Medical Capacity grants for\nbehavioral health services made available under\nfederal health center funding.\n4) Measurement and evaluation: Continuing to\nexamine the impact of integrated services, both in\nhealth centers and other sites, will shape the more\nwidespread adoption of this new model of\nTable 4 Estimates of the need for additional behavioral health patients and staff in 2010 by state1 (Continued)\n1States and U.S. territories with fewer than 3 grantees were excluded from this table.\n2Psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, other licensed mental health professionals (psychiatric social workers, psychiatric nurse practitioners, family\ntherapists, and other licensed master's degree-prepared clinicians).\n3Certified individuals who provide counseling, treatment or support services related to mental health professionals.\nhealthcare across the system. Assessing clinical,\noperational and financial outcomes upon achieving\nthe recommended staffing is also encouraged to\ndetermine what improvements in clinical outcomes\nand savings are seen in the system.\nSeveral provisions of the ACA are aimed at mitigating\nthe shortage of behavioral health providers in commu-\nnity based settings, through fostering care integration or\ntraining. In addition, a joint collaboration between the\nfederal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services\nAdministration and HRSA has funded community-based\npartnerships that promote the integration of primary\nand behavioral health care.\nLimitations\nFirst, the UDS data create some limitations. The UDS\nincludes encounters and patients for services provided\noff-site (i.e., not through a health center-employed clin-\nician) but paid for by the health center. We limited our\nutilization analysis to grantees with behavioral health\nstaff onsite, but we may have overestimated the number\nof visits a health center provider can reasonably provide\nif some patients from those grantees also received ser-\nvices offsite. Furthermore, the UDS does not break out\nstaffing categories beyond what is provided here.\nUtilization data from the UDS were significantly\nskewed, with a small number of grantees reporting large\nnumbers visits per provider and/or visits per behavioral\nhealth patient. Variations in disease severity, staffing\nmodels, and treatment modalities will influence the an-\nnual number of visits per patient and per clinician. It is\nlikely that certain health centers treat a significant num-\nber of patients with SMI, which we excluded from this\nstudy. We used median values to estimate the number\nof providers needed, but the model could be run with\nother cut-points to account for differences in service\nuse. It is likely an underestimation of actual need but ab-\nsent data on what number of visits is adequate for this\npopulation, it is at least rooted in the experience of pa-\ntients receiving care in these settings. We chose the me-\ndian to estimate the midpoint of those experiences\nacross all health centers with such services. It offers a\nmeasure of equity across FQHCs even if it doesn't\nachieve adequacy. That is, it offers a measure of what\nworkforce would be needed to achieve the same level of\nservice across all health centers given the evidence-\nbased prevalence of need for such care. This analysis\nalso used only one year of data, though it was the most\nrecent at the time. Changing staffing models may be ap-\nparent when exploring future or more years of UDS.\nSecond, we acknowledge that under broad insurance\nexpansion, most uninsured patients will likely gain\ncoverage through Medicaid, though many will also gain\nprivate insurance through the exchanges. Because our\ntwo categories of insurance represent applied bench-\nmarks for assessing workforce needs, we recognize that\nour estimates under these insurance-based assumptions\nare relatively conservative.\nThird, our estimates are still based on current staffing\npatterns in FQHC. Research has highlighted that health\ncenters often experience staffing shortages and that they\nserve more patients per provider compared to other pro-\nviders [37]. It remains unclear whether the allocation of\nbehavioral health positions would be made according to\nhistoric staffing patters or a new model. Further, esti-\nmates for staffing in general may be low given the pre-\nsumption that by expanding behavioral health services,\nmore patients may be retained over time in the FQHC.\nFourth, data from the NSDUH may likely underesti-\nmate need for behavioral health in FQHCs as it is based\non general estimates from a national survey not neces-\nsarily reflective of the population seen in FQHCs.\nFinally, because our study data sources were\nconstrained to those age 12 and older, we likely under-\nestimate behavioral health service needs for the full\nrange of patients served in these settings and neglect\nspecific counts of child behavioral health specialists.\nConclusions\nIntegrating behavioral health providers into primary care\ncreates a promising opportunity to better meet the be-\nhavioral health needs of health center patients by redu-\ncing the fragmentation that creates so many barriers for\nvulnerable populations. More mental health is seen in\nprimary care than in any other setting, and the number\nof primary care patients served by community health\ncenters is expected to expand significantly. As health\ncenters grow, so will access to needed health care ser-\nvices, but only with appropriate planning. We need a\nbetter understanding of how many behavioral health\nproviders are needed in health centers. This paper adds\nto the literature by proposing one way to assess the be-\nhavioral workforce need as well as the implications of\nthese recommendations for health policy.\nCompeting interests\nThis publication was supported by Grant/Cooperative Agreement Number\nU30CS16089 from the Health Resources and Services Administration, Bureau\nof Primary Health Care (HRSA/BPHC).
