    "abstract": "Abstract\nEnvironmental sustainability may be seen as a collective challenge that can only be met if a sufficient number\nof individuals cooperate. Whether or not individual tourists are willing to contribute their share may thus\ndepend not only on the degree to which they think that environmental sustainability is important (attitudes),\nbut also on the degree to which they think that other tourists hold similar attitudes (social comparison). Other\npossible influences are beliefs that one's own behaviour can make a difference (self-efficacy beliefs) and that\ntourists as a group together can make a difference (collective efficacy beliefs). This paper reports on findings\nfrom a study (N \u00bc 358) that investigated the role of these factors in explaining people's willingness to pay for\nenvironmental protection when travelling. Attitudes, self-efficacy and collective efficacy accounted for 30% of\nthe variance in willingness to pay for environmental protection; social comparison did not explain additional\nvariance. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.\n",

A broad\ndistinction can be made between research focusing\neither on structural or on informational strategies (cf.\nSteg and Vlek, 2009). Structural strategies aim at\nimplementing behavioural change through changing\nthe situational circumstances in which decisions are\nmade. One common approach within this stream of\nresearch is to identify and eliminate external factors\nthat may hinder people from engaging in pro-\nenvironmental behaviour (e.g. costs and benefits of\ndifferent behavioural alternatives; Van Raaij, 2002).\nInformational strategies seek to achieve behavioural\nchange through targeting internal factors such as atti-\ntudes and beliefs without intervening with the situ-\national circumstances. Research in this vein often\ndraws upon psychological theories that view human\nbehaviour as planned and deliberate (e.g. theory of\nplanned behaviour; Fishbein and Ajzen, 2010). The\npresent paper follows up on the latter line of research\nCorresponding author:\nRouven Doran, Department of Psychosocial Science, University of\nEmail: rouven.doran@psysp.uib.no\nTourism and Hospitality Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nthr.sagepub.com\nand examines individual characteristics of people who\nare willing to pay for environmental protection when\ntravelling.\nIn order better to understand what influences deci-\nsions to pay for environmental protection, it may be\nhelpful to conceive of environmental sustainability as a\nlarge-scale social dilemma \u00ad a situation in which the\nattainment of a desired collective outcome depends on\nthe cooperation of many individuals (cf. Van Lange\net al., 1998). The crux of social dilemmas is that\neach individual (or group member) is to decide\nbetween behavioural alternatives that maximize per-\nsonal interests and behavioural alternatives that maxi-\nmize collective interests. While the rational choice for\neach individual is to pursue personal interests, the\ngroup as a whole will only achieve the best possible\noutcome if everybody subordinates own interests to\nthose concerned with collective benefits (Dawes and\nMessick, 2000). With regard to travelling, the choice\nof environmentally sustainable travel options (e.g.\ntransportation with low carbon dioxide emissions)\ncan be regarded as an alternative that maximizes col-\nlective interests (e.g. mitigating global climate change,\npursuing environmental sustainability), and the choice\nof conventional travel options can be regarded as an\nalternative that maximizes personal interests, because\nit is usually associated with lower individual costs (e.g.\ncheaper, less time consuming).\nIn large-scale social dilemmas, such as in the case of\nenvironmental sustainability, individuals may feel that\ntheir own efforts to foster collective interests make\nlittle difference. People's beliefs in their ability to\nmake a difference are often referred to as self-efficacy\nbeliefs, and research has shown that individuals with\nstronger self-efficacy beliefs are more likely to contrib-\nute to collective benefits in social dilemmas (Kerr,\n1992) and to help foster sustainable development\nIn addition, strong collective efficacy beliefs, that is, the\nbelief that the members of a group (e.g. tourists) can\ntogether achieve desired outcomes might be decisive\nfor individual contributions in social dilemmas (De\nefficacy and collective efficacy beliefs are concerned\nwith questions about uncertainties that people may\nthink about when they are involved in a social\ndilemma: Can I personally make a difference? Will\nwe together be able to make a difference? Another\nuncertainty that characterizes social dilemmas has to\ndo with perceptions about the individual characteris-\ntics of other group members (Van Lange et al., 1992).\nFor example, people may ask themselves whether\nothers are similarly concerned about environmental\nproblems associated with tourism. We assume that if\npeople believe that they hold stronger views regarding\nthe importance of mitigating these problems than the\ntypical tourist, they are less likely to choose environ-\nmentally sustainable travel options because they may\ndoubt that others will contribute their share. In the\npresent study, we refer to comparisons between own\nand others' attitudes towards environmentally sustain-\nable tourism as social comparison.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate whether social\ncomparison contributes to explaining choices of environ-\nmentally sustainable travel options, conceptualized as\nwillingness to pay for environmental protection when\ntravelling, along with absolute judgments of own atti-\ntudes, self-efficacy beliefs and collective efficacy beliefs.\nLiterature review\nAttitudes\nAttitudes are evaluative judgments towards an object\nwith respect to some degree of favour or disfavour\n(Eagly and Chaiken, 1993). Supporting the view that\nthese judgments play a major role in determining\nhuman social behaviour (e.g. Ajzen and Gilbert Cote,\nempirical evidence linking attitudes to pro-environ-\nmental behaviour (for two recent meta-analyses, see\nBamberg and Mo\nical finding in this research is that favourable attitudes\ntowards environmental preservation are associated with\npro-environmental behaviour. For example, Han et al.\n(2010) demonstrated that environmental attitudes are\npositively associated with intentions to stay at a green\nhotel. Other contexts in which attitudes have been asso-\nciated with pro-environmental behaviour include, for\ninstance, travel mode choice (e.g. Th\u00f8gersen, 2006),\nsustainable consumption (e.g. Tanner and Wo\n\u00a8lfing\nKast, 2003) or energy conservation (e.g. Hansla\net al., 2008). In line with this research, we assume\nthat people with strong positive attitudes towards envir-\nonmentally sustainable tourism are more willing to pay\nfor environmental protection than people with less posi-\ntive attitudes towards environmentally sustainable\ntourism. By referring to positive attitudes towards\nenvironmentally sustainable tourism, we mean evalu-\native judgments in favour of actions that aim at limiting\nthe negative impacts of tourism on the natural environ-\nHypothesis 1 (attitudes): Positive attitudes towards\nenvironmentally sustainable tourism will be positively\nrelated to willingness to pay for environmental\nprotection.\nAs mentioned earlier, own attitudes towards envir-\nonmentally sustainable tourism may not be the only\nfactor that influences people's willingness to pay for\nenvironmental protection; social comparison may\nalso play a role. The rationale behind this assumption\nis that people have an inherent need for self-evaluation\nthat motivates them (if there are no objective criteria\navailable) to compare own opinions and abilities to\nthose of others (Festinger, 1954). Previous research\non social comparison has demonstrated that the out-\ncomes of these evaluations are often biased in the sense\nthat there are systematic differences in the perception\nof oneself and others (for a review, see, e.g., Chambers\nand Windschitl, 2004). One such bias is the tendency\nto view own characteristics more favourable than those\nof similar others (Alicke and Govorun, 2005). An illus-\ntration of this is provided by White and Plous (1995)\nwho found that people perceive themselves as being\nmore concerned about the environment and as show-\ning more environmental activism than most others.\nAdditionally, more than half of the participants in\nthat study expressed that they would be willing to do\nmore about protecting the environment if others would\nbe more concerned about the issue. These findings are\nsimilar to those of Pieters et al. (1998) who demon-\nstrated that people tend to attribute more pro-environ-\nmental behaviour and motivation to their own\nhouseholds than to other relevant societal actors such\nas other households, the government, agriculture and\nindustry.\nAlthough an increasing body of literature indicates\nthat people wish to dissociate themselves from other\ntourists (e.g. Doran et al., 2014; Prebensen et al.,\n2003), there are yet few studies investigating social\ncomparison within the domain of environmentally sus-\ntainable tourism. One notable exception is a recent\nstudy that investigated whether tourists perceived\ntheir own attitudes to be different from those of\nWhile one group of participants was asked to judge\ntheir own attitudes towards environmentally sustain-\nable tourism, two other groups of participants were\nasked to indicate what they thought to be the attitudes\nof either a typical or an average tourist. It turned out\nthat judgments of own attitudes were more favourable\n(i.e. more positive views about preserving the environ-\nment) than those concerning the other two groups,\nand that there was no difference between judgments\nof a typical or an average tourist (for similar findings,\nsee Doran and Larsen, 2014, Study 2). Another study\nexplored how people who frequently engage in eco-\nfriendly activities at home view themselves and their\nbehaviours in a vacation context (Juvan and Dolnicar,\n2014). While participants interviewed in this study\nwere generally aware about negative environmental\nconsequences linked to tourism activities, they also\nacknowledged that their vacation behaviours were\nmostly inconsistent with their attitudes towards envir-\nonmental preservation. One of the strategies to justify\nsuch inconsistencies in retrospect was downward\nsocial comparison (i.e. comparison with others who\nare perceived as doing worse than oneself).\nIt has been suggested that viewing oneself more\nfavourable than others may hinder people from enga-\nging in pro-environmental behaviour (Leary et al.,\nism, we propose that people who believe that they hold\nmore positive attitudes towards environmentally sus-\ntainable tourism than the typical tourist should be less\noptimistic that others will contribute their share and,\nhence, be less likely to contribute themselves. More\nspecifically, we assume that social comparison (in\nthis study conceptualized as comparing own attitudes\nto those of typical tourists) contributes to explaining\nvariance in people's willingness to pay for environmen-\ntal protection when travelling, in addition to absolute\njudgments of own attitudes.\nHypothesis 2 (social comparison): Favourable social\ncomparison will be negatively related to willingness\nto pay for environmental protection.\nEfficacy beliefs\nIf people think that environmental preservation is\nimportant but believe that their personal behaviour\nhas little impact on the environment, it is unlikely\nthat they will act in accordance with such attitudes.\nBandura (2006) stated that ``[u]nless people believe\nthat they can produce desired effects by their actions,\nthey have little incentive to act, or to persevere in the\nface of difficulties'' (p. 170). A person's beliefs about\nhow efficacious his or her behaviour is for achieving\ndesired outcomes are commonly referred to as self-\nSelf-efficacy is assumed to be another important deter-\nminant of behavioural intentions, and indirectly, of\nactual behaviour (Fishbein and Cappella, 2006).\nSelf-efficacy beliefs may be particularly important\nwhen people decide whether or not they should\npursue collective interests in large-scale social dilem-\nmas. In line with this assumption, Kerr (1989,\nExperiments 1\u00ad3) found that self-efficacy declined\nwith increasing numbers of people being involved in\nsocial dilemmas and that self-efficacy was positively\nrelated to pursuing collective interests. In an early\nreview of psychological determinants of global envir-\nonmental change, Stern (1992) concluded that vari-\nables dealing with perceived personal control were\nthe only personality variables that showed systematic\nrelationships with environmentally relevant\nbehaviours. Empirical support for the relationship\nbetween self-efficacy and pro-environmental behav-\niour also comes from recent cross-sectional studies\nA common finding in these studies is that a stronger\nsense of self-efficacy is associated with a greater ten-\ndency to engage in behaviours that foster sustainable\ndevelopment (e.g. purchasing eco-friendly consump-\ntion products). A novelty in Hanss and Bo\n\u00a8hm's study\n(2010) was that the authors investigated self-efficacy\nconcerning people's perceived direct impact on sus-\ntainable development (i.e. through their own actions)\nand people's perceived indirect impact on sustainable\ndevelopment (i.e. through encouraging others to con-\ntribute to sustainable development). They found that\nboth aspects of sustainable development self-efficacy\npredicted sustainable consumption behaviours.\nConsidering that self-efficacy beliefs were found to\nbe associated with various types of pro-environmental\nbehaviour, it is somewhat surprising that self-efficacy\n(as conceptualized in the present study) has so far\nreceived little attention in research on environmentally\nsustainable tourism. A notable exception is a study by\nGustin and Weaver (1996) that showed that self-effi-\ncacy, together with knowledge about environmental\nissues and attitudes towards environmental strategies,\nwas positively related to people's intentions to stay in a\nhotel that applies environmental strategies. Findings\nfrom other studies further indicate that perceived\nlack of ability can be used to justify personal inaction\nstudy by Juvan and Dolnicar (2014), for example,\ndownward social comparison was not the only strategy\nused to justify discrepancies between home and vac-\nation behaviours. Another strategy was denial of\nresponsibility, which is, denying personal responsibility\nto take action and/or denying personal ability to\nmake a difference. Based upon these findings, we\nassume that self-efficacy concerning environmental\npreservation is positively associated with people's will-\ningness to pay for environmental protection when\ntravelling.\nHypothesis 3 (self-efficacy): Self-efficacy beliefs will be\npositively related to willingness to pay for environmen-\ntal protection.\nBuilding upon the view that mitigating environmen-\ntal problems is a collective effort, individual tourists\nmay derive efficacy expectations not only from judg-\nments of their own ability to make a difference but also\nfrom the degree to which they think that tourists\ntogether can affect the state of the environment. The\nbeliefs of an individual member of a group about the\ngroup's ability to achieve desired outcomes are\nreferred to as collective efficacy beliefs (Bandura,\n1997). Just like self-efficacy may affect behaviour on\nthe individual level, this type of efficacy beliefs may\ndetermine how much effort group members put into\nthe pursuit of collective interests (cf. Bandura, 2000).\nHomburg and Stolberg (2006) found some support for\nthis assumption by showing that people's engagement\nin activities to cope with environmental stressors can\nbe predicted by collective efficacy (Studies 3 and 4)\nbut not by self-efficacy (Studies 1 and 2). Likewise,\nThaker (2012) found that collective efficacy predicted\nthe degree to which local residents engaged in behav-\niours to secure the supply of safe drinking water in\ntheir community (e.g. participate in demonstrations,\nencourage other community members to save water).\nPeople with higher levels of collective efficacy did more\nto help secure drinking water than people with low and\nmoderate levels of collective efficacy. Another study\nthat is important in this context comes from\nBonniface and Henley (2008) who used focus groups\nto explore efficacy beliefs among environmental activ-\nists and non-activists. One of their findings was that\npeople participating in household waste management\nwere more likely to believe that the waste problem\ncould be reduced if everybody contributed their\nshare than people who did not participate in house-\nhold waste management.\nAccording to Bandura (2000), one way of measur-\ning collective efficacy beliefs is by asking members of a\ngroup to judge the group's ability to jointly achieve\ndesired outcomes. This method of assessment takes\naccount of group dynamics that may influence the\nfunctioning and efficacy of the group. With regard to\ngroup membership, different levels of aggregation may\nbe distinguished (cf. Homburg and Stolberg, 2006).\nFor example, tourists can be grouped at very general\nlevels, such as tourists from a specific continent or\ncountry, or more specific levels, such as tourists from\na specific city. In this study, we measured collective\nefficacy at the highest possible level of aggregation,\nthat is, people's beliefs about the ability of tourists in\ngeneral to jointly help preserve the environment. We\nchose this level of aggregation because many of the\nenvironmental problems linked with tourism activities\nare global (UNEP-UNWTO, 2012) and thus their\nmitigation requires the cooperation by individuals\nfrom all over the world. Based on the findings from\nother domains (see above), we assume that collective\nefficacy is positively associated with people's willing-\nness to pay for environmental protection when\ntravelling.\nHypothesis 4 (collective efficacy): Collective efficacy\nbeliefs will be positively related to willingness to pay\nfor environmental protection.\nMethod\nParticipants\nA cross-sectional survey using a convenience sample\n(N \u00bc 358) was used to investigate the hypotheses. Data\nwere collected by the authors and research assistants\namong domestic and international tourists visiting\nBergen, Norway. Potential participants were contacted\nat waiting areas (e.g. tourist information, hotel lobby)\nand recreational areas (e.g. scenic nature spots,\nfamous sights). After information about the study\nwas provided (i.e. topic, purpose and duration, confi-\ndentiality, language of the questionnaire, contact infor-\nmation of the project leaders), people were asked\nwhether they were willing to take part in the study.\nThose who agreed to participate were provided with\na self-administered paper-and-pencil questionnaire\n(English language). Completed questionnaires were\ncollected and the participants were asked whether\nthey had any questions regarding the study.\nQuestions were answered immediately on-site.\nferent continents: The majority was from Europe\n(68%); thereof most participants were from\nGermany, Norway, the United Kingdom, Sweden\nand France. The second largest group was from Asia\n(16%), thereof most participants were from China.\nThe remaining participants were from North\nAmerica (9%), Oceania (4%), South America (2%)\nand Africa (1%). Although the questionnaire did not\nask specifically whether participants were domestic or\ninternational tourists, some 11% (n \u00bc 38) indicated\nthat they were Norwegian by nationality. This might\nserve as an estimate concerning the number of domes-\ntic tourists participating in this study.\nMaterials and procedure\nIn addition to questions about participants' age,\ngender and nationality (see above), the questionnaire\nconsisted of items to measure various aspects of travel-\nling. At this point, we will only report self-report meas-\nures for willingness to pay for environmental\nprotection, attitudes, social comparison, self-efficacy\nbeliefs and collective efficacy beliefs.\nWillingness to pay for environmental protection.\nFrom a theoretical perspective (e.g. Fishbein and\nto pay for environmental protection reflects a person's\nintention to engage in a specific type of pro-environ-\nmental behaviour. Three questionnaire items measur-\ning this construct were constructed for the purpose of\nthis study (see Table 1). Formulations resembled pre-\nviously used measures of stated willingness to accept\neconomic sacrifices in order to protect the environ-\nitems (i.e. WTP1-WTP3) entered a principal compo-\nnent analysis (PCA; direct oblimin, listwise deletion),\nKaiser\u00adMeyer\u00adOlkin (KMO) measure of sampling\nadequacy \u00bc.68; Barlett's test of sphericity: approxi-\nan eigenvalue greater than one was retained, which\nexplained 69.81% of the variance in stated willingness\nto pay for environmental protection. An index variable\nwas computed by averaging participants' answers to all\nthree items (see Table 2).\nAttitudes. Attitudes were measured by three question-\nnaire items (see Table 1), adopted from Doran and\nLarsen (2014). Because one aspect addressed in this\nstudy was social comparison, these attitude items were\nprovided in two different variants: one to measure par-\nticipants' own attitudes and one to measure what par-\nticipants thought to be the attitudes of typical tourists.\nAll six items (self and typical) entered a PCA (direct\noblimin, listwise deletion), KMO \u00bc.75; approximate\neigenvalue greater than one were retained, which\nexplained 79.12% of the variance in attitudes: one\ncomprising judgments of own attitudes (i.e. EAs1-\nEAs3) and one comprising judgments of typical tour-\nists' attitudes (i.e. EAt1-EAt3). Index variables were\ncomputed by averaging participants' answers to each\nset of items (see Table 2).\nFavourable social comparison can be measured\nusing direct or indirect methods of assessment (see\nWindschitl, 2004). The present study used an indirect\nmethod of assessment where participants are asked to\nmake separate judgments about themselves and others\n(here: typical tourists). Favourable social comparison\ncan then be measured by subtracting judgments of\ntypical tourists' attitudes from judgments of own atti-\ntudes (cf. Alicke and Govorun, 2005). Higher positive\nscores were interpreted as stronger contrasts, that is,\npeople view their own attitudes more favourably than\nthose of typical tourists. We further used two question-\nnaire versions that differed with respect to the order in\nwhich the item measures were presented. One part of\nthe participants was first asked to judge their own atti-\ntudes and then the attitudes of typical tourists (i.e. self\n! typical, n \u00bc 163). Another part of the participants\nfirst judged the attitudes of typical tourists and then\ntheir own attitudes (i.e. typical ! self, n \u00bc 195).\nEfficacy beliefs. Self-efficacy beliefs were measured by\nmeans of three questionnaire items (see Table 1).\nTable 1.

Two items\n(i.e. SE1_d, SE2_d) were newly formulated for the\npurpose of this study and dealt with the perceived\ndirect impact on environmental outcomes, such as\nprotecting wildlife or reducing carbon emissions. The\nthree items entered a PCA (direct oblimin, listwise\np <.001. One component with an eigenvalue greater\nthan one was retained, explaining 60.86% of the vari-\nance in self-efficacy beliefs. An index variable was\ncomputed by averaging participants' answers to these\nitems (see Table 2).\nCollective efficacy beliefs were measured by four\nquestionnaire items (see Table 1). While some items\n(i.e. CE3_d, CE4_i) were newly formulated for the\npurpose of this study, other items (i.e. CE1_d,\nCE2_d) were adapted from Homburg and Stolberg\n(2006) but adjusted to measure collective efficacy in\nthe context of tourism. Three of these items consisted\nof a statement that tourists can together help solving\nenvironmental problems, such as pollution or global\nclimate change (i.e. CE1_d-CE3_d). The fourth item\ndealt with the ability of tourists to indirectly mitigate\nenvironmental problems through encouraging an\nincreasing number of people to travel in an environ-\nmentally friendly manner (i.e. CE4_i). One compo-\nnent with an eigenvalue greater than one was\nretained when the four items entered a PCA (direct\noblimin, listwise deletion), KMO \u00bc.83; approximate\n74.73% of the variance in collective efficacy beliefs.\nAn index variable was computed by averaging partici-\npants' answers to the four items (see Table 2).\nData handling and analysis\nSome participants did not respond to all items (n \u00bc 24,\n7%) and therefore had missing values on some of the\nvariables. Missing values were deleted listwise in the\nanalyses. Data were analysed with the statistical pack-\nage IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 21.\nThe correlational structure of each construct was\nexplored by means of principal component analyses\nand index variables were computed for each of the\nconstructs (see Materials and procedure). Index\nscores were also computed for those participants who\nhad missing values on some of the variables and thus\nwere excluded from the principal component analyses.\nTwo-way mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA)\nexamined social comparison outcomes. Correlation\nand regression analyses tested the hypothesized asso-\nciations. Preconditions for performing multiple regres-\nsion analysis (cf. Field, 2013) were satisfied (i.e. no\nsignificant outliers, imperfect multicollinearity of pre-\ndictors, unbounded criterion variable, independent\nand normally distributed residuals, homoscedasticity\nand linearity, non-zero variances).2\nResults\nAnalyses of social comparison outcomes\nWe conducted a 2 (social comparison) \u00c2 2 (item order)\nmixed ANOVA with social comparison (self vs. typical)\nas a within-subjects and item order (self ! typical vs.\ntourists ! self) as a between-subjects factor. There was\na significant main effect for social comparison, F(1,\nfavourable social comparison in the sense that partici-\npants perceived themselves as holding more positive\nattitudes towards environmentally sustainable tourism\nthan typical tourists.

Attitudes\n(self), social comparison, self-efficacy beliefs and col-\nlective efficacy beliefs were all positively and signifi-\ncantly associated with willingness to pay for\nenvironmental protection. Attitudes (typical) were\nnot significantly associated with willingness to pay for\nenvironmental protection. In order to check the\nrobustness of these findings, we also calculated partial\ncorrelations with item order being controlled for. Since\nnone of the hypothesized associations were affected\nsubstantially by this procedure, these results are not\ndiscussed further.\nExplaining willingness to pay for\nenvironmental protection with attitudes,\nsocial comparison, self-efficacy beliefs and\ncollective efficacy beliefs\nFollowing up on results from the correlation analyses,\nwe also computed a hierarchical regression analysis\n(see Table 4). In the first step, attitudes (self) and\nsocial comparison were entered as independent vari-\nables. The model explained about 13% of the variance\nin willingness to pay for environmental protection,\nwith only attitudes (self) being significantly associated\nwith willingness to pay for environmental protection\n(positive association). In the second step, both types\nof efficacy beliefs were added as independent variables.\nThis improved the model significantly, R2\nchange\nexplained about 30% of the variance in willingness to\npay for environmental protection. With the exception\nof social comparison, all other independent variables\nwere significantly associated with willingness to pay for\nenvironmental protection (positive associations). A\ncloser inspection of standardized regression coeffi-\ncients further indicated that stated willingness to pay\nfor environmental protection appears particularly sen-\nsitive to changes in collective efficacy beliefs.\nIn sum, these findings provide support for\nHypothesis 1 (attitudes), Hypothesis 3 (self-efficacy)\nand Hypothesis 4 (collective efficacy).

The decision to include\nsocial comparison as an independent variable was\nbased on the assumption that people who believe\nthat they hold more positive attitudes towards envir-\nonmentally sustainable tourism than the typical tourist\nmay doubt that others will contribute their share, and\ntherefore be hesitant about contributing themselves.\nWhile social comparison did not explain extra variance\nin stated willingness to pay for environmental protec-\ntion, absolute judgments of own attitudes as well as\nself-efficacy and collective efficacy beliefs were all posi-\ntively and significantly associated with stated willing-\nness to pay for environmental protection.\nOur findings corroborate recent studies indicating\nfavourable self-views when people compare themselves\nwith others on dimensions related to issues of environ-\nmentally sustainable tourism (Doran and Larsen,\ntrary to our hypothesis, this type of social comparison\ndid not explain variance in willingness to pay for envir-\nonmental protection additionally to own attitudes.\nOne possible explanation is that social comparison of\nattitudes is a matter of retrospectively justifying coun-\nter-attitudinal behaviour rather than being decisive in\nsituations where people choose between different\ntravel alternatives. The underlying assumption here is\nthat perceived discrepancies between own attitudes\ntowards environmental preservation and actual travel\nbehaviours may lead to cognitive dissonance (i.e. feel-\nings of discomfort caused by inconsistencies between a\nperson's behaviours, attitudes or beliefs; Festinger,\n1957). Based on semi-structured interviews with\nenvironmental activists, Juvan and Dolnicar (2014)\nconcluded that tourists may rely on different types of\nbeliefs (or strategies) to re-establish cognitive conson-\nance, one of which they identified as comparisons with\npeople who are thought of as behaving less environ-\nmentally friendly. It can be speculated that similar pro-\ncesses take place in situations where people decide not\nto pay an additional cost for environmental protection\neven though environmental preservation is important\nto them (see also Doran and Larsen, 2014).\nAs mentioned earlier, decisions to pay for environ-\nmental protection can be regarded as a large-scale\nsocial dilemma. In these situations, people may have\nstronger doubts regarding their personal ability to\nmake a difference (cf. Kerr, 1989) and perhaps also\nregarding the ability of the collective to achieve desired\noutcomes. One reason could be that in larger groups\npeople are less familiar with the other group members\ninvolved, and predictions of group dynamics that may\naffect the performance of the group are thus difficult.\nFollowing this line of reasoning, we assumed that\nuncertainties concerning the ability and effectiveness\nof oneself and others in producing a desired outcome\n(e.g. environmental preservation) may be particularly\ndecisive. Consistent with this view, our findings\nshowed that self-efficacy and collective efficacy beliefs\nwere both positively associated with willingness to pay\nfor environmental protection. Targeting efficacy beliefs\ncould therefore be one promising approach of\nencouraging people to travel in an environmentally\nsustainable manner. One way of strengthening percep-\ntions of efficacy could be to reduce the perceived size\nof the social dilemma through informational cam-\npaigns that implement strategies of scope reduction\n(cf. Hanss, 2012). Scope reduction (Wiener and\nDoescher, 1991) refers to breaking down large-scale,\nglobal challenges (e.g. environmental sustainability,\nmitigating global climate change) into small-scale,\nlocal problems (e.g. extinction of local species, air pol-\nlution at a specific tourist destination). Applied to the\ncontext of tourism, scope reduction allows communi-\ncating environmental problems as small-scale social\ndilemmas and may thereby help increase perceptions\nof self-efficacy and collective efficacy in the tourism\ndomain.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study that exam-\nined different types of efficacy beliefs in the context of\nenvironmentally sustainable tourism. While both effi-\ncacy constructs explained separate amounts of vari-\nance in willingness to pay for environmental\nprotection, stated willingness was particularly sensitive\nto changes in collective efficacy. This finding supports\nthe view that the degree to which people perceive tour-\nists as a group to be capable of helping to protect the\nenvironment may motivate reparative actions, and\npotentially more so, than self-efficacy (see also\nstrengthening perceptions of collective efficacy could\nbe to provide people with information about the\naccomplishments of similar others (i.e. vicarious\nexperiences; Bandura, 1997). For instance, providing\nexamples of tourist destinations in which the coopera-\ntive behaviour of many individuals (e.g. using public\ntransportation instead of renting a car) contributed to\nmitigating environmental problems (e.g. air pollution)\nmay enhance perceptions of collective efficacy in the\ntourism domain. Another option for strengthening\nperceptions of collective efficacy is to provide evalu-\native feedback that endorses the group's ability for\nachieving the desired outcome (i.e. verbal persuasion;\nBandura, 1997). For instance, people who decide on\nwhether to pay extra in order to protect the\nenvironment (e.g. via participation in carbon offsetting\nschemes) could be confronted with information illus-\ntrating how the joint contributions of many individuals\nwould potentially benefit the state of the environment\n(e.g. global reduction in carbon dioxide emissions).\nThe potential impact of using verbal persuasion as a\nmeans of strengthening perceptions of efficacy\ndepends on whether the persuading actor is perceived\nas knowledgeable and credible (Bandura, 1997).\nWillingness to pay for environmental protection\nmay not only depend on beliefs that people (or tourists\nas a group) can make a difference through their own\nactions but also that these actions can serve as an\ninspiration to others (cf. Hanss and Bo\nThe present study therefore included measures for\ndirect and indirect components of efficacy beliefs. In\nboth cases (self- and collective efficacy), items measur-\ning each of the two components loaded on the same\nfactor. This indicates that the belief that people can\nencourage others to contribute their share (e.g. by set-\nting a good example) also seems to be an important\naspect of efficacy beliefs in connection with environ-\nmentally sustainable tourism. One way to increase\npeople's perceived impact on the behaviour of other\ntourists may be to increase the social visibility of\ncooperative behaviours, thereby creating social norms\nto join in (cf. Hanss and Bo\ntourists who make economic sacrifices in order to help\npreserve the environment could be provided with an\neye-catching sticker or a tag to be attached to their\nluggage whilst travelling. Empirical support for this\nview comes from Goldstein et al. (2008) who demon-\nstrated in two field experiments that making pro-envir-\nonmental behaviours public can have powerful effects\non people's behaviours. For example, when hotel\nguests received an appeal to reuse their towels in\norder to help protecting the environment, and, in add-\nition, were told that other hotel guests also had reused\ntheir towels (i.e. social norm), towel reuse was greater\nthan when hotel guests only received the appeal to\nreuse. Illustrations of this type of empirical research\nmay also be used in informational campaigns to fur-\nther convince tourists that their own actions may have\nan actual impact on the behaviour of others.\nLimitations and future directions\nThere are some limitations to this study that could be\naddressed in future research. First, cross-sectional data\nwere used to investigate associations between atti-\ntudes, efficacy beliefs, and willingness to pay for envir-\nonmental protection. Although there is empirical\nevidence to suggest that these variables influence\nbehaviour in the proposed direction, cross-sectional\ndata are nonetheless insufficient to test for causal\nrelationships. It follows that, based on the findings of\nthis study, interpretations regarding how to encourage\npeople to travel in an environmentally sustainable\nmanner must be taken with caution.\nSecond, behavioural intentions are often regarded\nas the main determinant of actual behaviour (e.g.\nFishbein and Ajzen, 2010). Previous studies (e.g.\nHanss and Bo\nintentions are not perfectly related to sustainable con-\nsumption behaviour. Future studies should thus ide-\nally include measures of actual behaviour as well. One\noption could be to include self-reports of behaviour,\nfor example, by asking people to fill out travel diaries.\nThis type of approach would also produce longitudinal\ndata that allow for detecting changes in the focal vari-\nables over time.\nThird, collective efficacy beliefs were measured at\nthe highest possible level of aggregation, that is, beliefs\nabout the ability of tourists in general to jointly help\npreserve the environment. It could be that people may\nnot consider themselves as being part of such a het-\nerogeneous and large group and, as a consequence,\nreport lower levels of collective efficacy. Future studies\nmay benefit from choosing more specific levels of\naggregation in order to clarify the relationship between\ngroup size and collective efficacy (cf. Homburg and\nStolberg, 2006). This could be done, for instance, by\nreferring to tourists at a certain destination or tourists\nwith similar socio-demographic profiles.\nFourth, the indirect component of efficacy beliefs\nwas measured with only one item for each construct,\nwhich is, encouraging others to travel environmentally\nfriendly themselves. Future studies that employ a more\ncomprehensive measurement (e.g. multiple items)\nwould further facilitate the understanding of how per-\nceptions of efficacy may influence decisions to travel in\nan environmentally sustainable manner.\nDespite these limitations, this study provides\nimportant insights into individual characteristics of\npeople who are willing to contribute their share in\nhelping to protect the environment. From a research\nperspective, we hope that our findings will stimulate\nfurther research (in particular experimental studies)\ninto the roles of self-efficacy and collective efficacy as\nantecedents of pro-environmental behaviour and, in\nparticular, with regard to choices of environmentally\nsustainable travel options. An important area for\nfuture investigations is to examine whether targeting\nperceptions of efficacy offers a fruitful approach for\nencouraging people to consider environmental issues\nwhen making travel choices, and whether efficacy\nbeliefs on a collective level are more decisive than\nthose on an individual level. From a managerial per-\nspective, the findings of such studies may inform those\ninvolved in the planning and implementation of\ninformational strategies that seek to promote behav-\nioural change among tourists. For example, previous\nresearch suggests that people often fail to ascribe per-\nsonal responsibility for solving environmental prob-\nlems associated with tourism activities (Hares et al.,\nin line with our present findings, communications\nabout the necessity to take reparative actions may\nbenefit from shifting the focus away from emphasizing\npersonal responsibility towards positioning each indi-\nvidual tourist as being part of a larger group that shares\na collective responsibility (see also Moisander, 2007).\n"
