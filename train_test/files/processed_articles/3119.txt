Negative binomial regression was used to incorporate every year of\ndata into estimated percentage changes in CO emissions and mortality rates over time.\nResults During 1968-1998, CO-related mortality rates in the United States declined\nfrom 20.2 deaths to 8.8 deaths per 1 million person-years (an estimated decline of\nof the catalytic converter to automobiles in 1975, CO emissions from automobiles\nunintentional motor vehicle\u00adrelated CO death rates declined from 4.0 to 0.9 deaths\n-77.0%). Rates of motor vehicle\u00adrelated CO suicides declined from 10.0 to 4.9 deaths\n-18.4%) in the annual unintentional motor vehicle\u00adrelated CO death rate and a 5.9%\ndecrease (95%CI, -10.0% to -1.8%) in the annual rate of motor vehicle\u00adrelated CO\nsuicides.\nConclusions If rates of unintentional CO-related deaths had remained at pre-1975\nlevels, an estimated additional 11700 motor vehicle\u00adrelated CO poisoning deaths might\nhave occurred by 1998. This decline in death rates appears to be a public health ben-\nefit associated with the enforcement of standards set by the 1970 Clean Air Act.\nSee also Patient Page.\nof automobile emissions standards set\nwith these standards, the first catalytic\nconverters were introduced for automo-\nimproved the completeness of engine\ncombustion and reduced CO emis-\nsions from passenger vehicles.8-11 How-\never, an evaluation of the influence of\nnational vehicle emissions policies and\npractices on trends in CO-related mor-\ntality has not been undertaken. Exist-\ning surveillance reports have presented\nmortality data only for periods follow-\ning the introduction of the catalytic con-\nbaseline rates of CO-related deaths\nunestablished. In addition, multivari-\nate analyses have not been used to re-\nlate changes in national rates of CO-\nrelateddeathstoannualindicatorsofCO\nemissions from automobiles. To ad-\ndress these issues, we examine 31 years\nmotor vehicle emissions data and also\nprovide updated surveillance for CO-\nrelated deaths in the United States.\nMETHODS\nData Source\nDeath certificates contain demo-\ngraphic and geographic information of\nthe decedent, as well as International\nClassification of Diseases (ICD)12,13 codes\nfor up to 20 conditions that contrib-\nuted to the death. All US death certifi-\ncate information is compiled by the Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics,\nCenters for Disease Control and Pre-\nventionintotheMultipleCauseofDeath\nMortality Data Tapes. These cause of\ndeath codes are compiled in 2 forms: the\nentity axis, which contains conditions\nas stated on the death certificate; and the\nrecord axis, which is edited by a com-\nputer algorithm to revise some ICD\ncodes to best describe the overall medi-\ncal certification portion of the death cer-\naxis portion of these data. The ICD,\nEighth Revision (ICD-8) was in effect for\nRevision (ICD-9) was in effect for the\nCase Definition\nWe searched the data tapes for records\n(toxic effect of CO) as a contributing\ndeaths. A previous national surveil-\nlance report used this case definition for\ncase ascertainment.1 In a slight depar-\nture from the previous report, we also\nsearched the data tapes for deaths where\nN986 was not listed on the death cer-\ntificate, but where ICD external cause of\ninjury codes (E-codes) exclusive to CO\nsoning from motor vehicle exhaust\nlisted on the death certificate. Since CO\nis the only acutely poisonous gas in mo-\ntor vehicle exhaust,8 we also consid-\nered these codes to indicate CO poison-\ning. This change in case definition led\nto the inclusion of 716 additional deaths\nduringthe31-yearperiodthatwouldnot\nhave otherwise been captured (716/\ndeaths).Asdatawereonlyavailablefrom\na 50% sample of death certificates for\nwere weighted by a factor of 2.15\nClassification of Intent\nand Mechanism of Death\nWe classified each CO-related death by\nintent (unintentional, suicide, homi-\ncide, intent undetermined, and other)\nand mechanism (motor vehicle\u00ad\nrelated,non\u00admotorvehicle\u00adrelated,and\nmechanism undetermined), as defined\nby the E-codes listed on the death rec-\nord(BOX 1).RecordscontainingE-codes\nBox 1.

We excluded\nfrom the study any record containing\ncodesforinjuriesrelatedtofireandflames\nlic health prevention strategies pertain-\ning to this group of deaths focus more\non preventing house fires than CO poi-\nsoning per se.1\nCalculation of Death Rates\nand Trend Analyses\nWe used US Census Bureau national\nresident midpoint population esti-\nculate all national rates and trend lines.\nLog-linear negative binomial and Pois-\nson regression analyses were used to es-\ntimate change, and 95% confidence in-\ntervals (CIs) for change in rates during\nthe study period.16 Estimates of change\nin mortality rates by intent and mecha-\nfinal year of implementation of the\nICD-8 coding scheme, there was no\nchange in ICD coding within each of\nthese 3 study periods.\nExamining the Influence\nof National Vehicle Emissions\nPolicies and Practices\nWe calculated trends in annual esti-\nmated CO emissions from automobiles\nusing data provided by the US Environ-\ntion Agency collected vehicle model and\nvehicle age\u00adspecific CO emission rate\nhiclesintheUnitedStates.Themeasure-\nment of CO emissions was undertaken\nin a controlled setting during the cold\nstart of the motor vehicle and also dur-\ning 23 minutes of continuous station-\nary vehicle operation.17 This testing pro-\ncedure resulted in estimates of total\nvehicle emissions (specified as grams/\nmile of CO per test mile) that are di-\nrectly comparable across vehicles of dif-\nferentmakeandmodelyears.Weapplied\nthese emission rates (specific to vehicle\nage and model-year, within calendar\nyear) to annual data on the composi-\nduce annual estimates of CO emissions\nper motor vehicle in the United States.\nTrend lines of these emissions data\nwere calculated using a normally dis-\ntributed linear regression model for the\nNegativebinomialregressionmodelsad-\njusting for the age, sex, and race of the\ndecedent were used to calculate corre-\nsponding trends in rates of motor vehi-\ncle\u00adrelated CO deaths. The cutoff of\ntheintroductionyearofthecatalyticcon-\nverter may have had on these trends.\nWe also used negative binomial re-\ngression models to directly examine as-\nsociations between the annual auto-\nmobile emissions estimates and annual\nrates of motor vehicle\u00adrelated CO poi-\nsoning deaths. To estimate the num-\nber of unintentional poisoning deaths\nels, we calculated the average annual\nrate of unintentional CO-related deaths\nthis rate to US population estimates dur-\nstitute, Inc, Cary, NC) was used and the\na priori significance level for all statis-\ntical tests was set at P.05.\nExamining the Influence\nof Hospital-Based Treatment\nTo determine whether better medical\ntreatment may have reduced mortality\nfrom CO poisoning, we classified deaths\ninto 2 categories. First, deaths in home\nor nonclinical settings were classified as\ndeaths without treatment. As these\ndeaths likely involved no medical care,\nthey could not have been prevented by\nimprovedhospital-basedtreatment.Sec-\nond, persons who died during hospital-\nization, who died during an outpatient\nvisit to an emergency department, or\nwho were dead on arrival at a hospital,\nclinic, or medical center were classified\nas deaths possibly following treatment.\nWe compared changes in the rate of\ndeaths without treatment and deaths\npossiblyfollowingtreatment.Thisanaly-\ndeath data were available on the death\ncertificates.\nRESULTS\nrelated CO poisoning was listed as a\n(TABLE 1).

Declining trends in death rates\nwere observed across selected catego-\nries of intent and mechanism of death\n(TABLE 2). However, greater declines\nwere observed in CO-related uninten-\ntional death rates than suicide rates.\n(Table 2 and FIGURE 1).
