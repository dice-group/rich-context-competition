Five types of UL are delineated\nand conceptualized on a continuum from lower to greater levels of interdependence: crush on someone unavailable, crush\non someone nearby, pursuing a love object, longing for a past lover, and an unequal love relationship. Study 1a found all types\nof UL relationships to be less emotionally intense than equal love and 4 times more frequent than equal love during a 2-year\nperiod. Study 1b found little evidence for limerent qualities of UL. Study 2 found all types of UL to be less intense than equal\nlove on passion, sacrifice, dependency, commitment, and practical love, but more intense than equal love on turmoil. These\nresults suggest that UL is not a good simulation of true romantic love, but an inferior approximation of that ideal.\n",

The prototype of\nconsummate romantic love is that it will be reciprocal, ful-\ntrusting, caring, and, intimate (Fehr, 2006). Unrequited love\n(UL) occurs when differences in the aspirations or the expe-\nriences of love result in a yearning for more complete love by\none of the individuals in the relationship. The experience of\nUL may be an ephemeral mood state, a developmental stage\nin a relationship, idiosyncratic to the combination of two\nindividuals, or the result of a stable attribute (e.g., anxious/\nambivalent attachment; Aron, Aron, & Allen, 1998). UL has\nbeen found to be more prevalent among individuals who\nreported an anxious/ambivalent attachment style (Aron et al.,\n1998) and who were low on defensiveness (K. K. Dion &\nDion, 1975). This research is focused on evaluating the ques-\ntion of whether or not UL is a type of romantic love and the\nways in which UL aligns with the attributes of romantic love.\nTypes of UL\nBaumeister, Wotman, and Stillwell (1993) described several\nways in which UL can develop (e.g., growing out of friend-\nship, loving from afar) and Aron and Aron (1991) described\nthree types of UL (secret, jilted, hanger on). We conceptual-\nized UL as occurring in different kinds of relationships that\nare assumed to be located on a continuum of interdepen-\nBaumeister et al., 1993).

An extreme\nexample of a relationship with low interdependence is an\nimaginary lover. A love relationship that is equal in\nexchanges encompasses high levels of interdependence\nuum of presumed interdependence organizes the following\ntypes of UL relationships.\nCrush on Someone Who Is Unavailable\nSomeone can have a crush on a love object who exists, but\nwho is seldom proximal (e.g., a rock star, a movie star). The\nperson has little or no chance of forming an equal, reciprocal\nrelationship because the love object is unavailable. There are\noften large disparities between the two persons in their desir-\nability and the desirability of their alternatives, decreasing\n1Appalachian State University, Boone, NC, USA\n2Indiana University\u00adPurdue University Indianapolis, USA\n3Ohio State University, Mansfield, USA\n4Indiana University, Bloomington, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nRobert G.

Furthermore, relationships that might form\nare superficial, asymmetrical, and incomplete (e.g., talking at\nan autograph session, a one-night sexual relationship). Thus,\nthe love object is more accessible to, more important to, and\nexercises more behavioral control over the enamored than\nvice versa. However, there is interdependence. As Ferris\n(2001) documented, fans collect information about their par-\namours, experience emotions when good and bad events\noccur in the paramour's life, alter their behavior to be near\nthe paramour (e.g., go to concerts) (Spitzberg & Cupach,\n2007). Furthermore, the star's behavior can be influenced by\nfans (e.g., changing behavior to appeal to them).\nCrush on Someone Nearby Without Initiating a\nRomantic Relationship\nSome potential romantic partners may be physically nearby.\nAwareness may be unilateral or mutual (Levinger & Snoek,\n1972). Because of the person's proximity, interdependence\ncan be greater than that for the previous type. The presence\nof the love object may influence the enamored person's\nbehavior (e.g., attempts at contact are made). There can be\ninteraction, which may be perfunctory and contain no disclo-\nsure of romantic interests, or the relationship may develop\ninto a friendship without clear revelation of romantic inter-\nPursuing the Love Object\nAt some point, the enamored may decide to initiate a\nromantic relationship, either through somewhat passive\nroutes (increasing contact, ambiguous statements), or more\nactive communication of romantic interests (asking for a\ndate). The intentions may or may not be accurately per-\nceived by the love object (Baumeister & Wotman, 1992),\nresulting in varying degrees of emotions and differences in\nexpectations for the future of the romantic relationship\nThe attraction can be rather sudden (which Shaver,\nMorgan, & Wu, 1996, describe as a love surge) and the \"love\nstruck\" person assumes the task of communicating romantic\nintentions, eliciting reciprocation, and initiating a romantic\nrelationship (Baumeister & Wotman, 1992). Alternatively,\nunilateral romantic inclinations can develop within the con-\ntext of a friendship. In either case, the fate of the relationship\nlikely depends on many factors (e.g., clear communication,\navailability of the prospective partner). Barelds and Barelds-\nDijkstra (2007) found that partners who \"fell in love at first\nsight\" had more dissimilar personalities than those who fell in\nlove more gradually. In addition, differences in desirable\nqualities may result in the person \"falling upward\" (i.e.,\nattempting to initiate a relationship with someone of greater\noverall desirability) to be thwarted by the more desirable per-\nson (Baumeister & Wotman, 1992). Thus, one consequence\nof expressed romantic interests may be that they are either\ninitially or regularly rejected. However, the UL relationship\nmay blend into the courtship process in which the couple pur-\nsues a romantic relationship (Cate & Lloyd, 1992).\nLonging for a Past Lover\nDissolution of a relationship is often not mutual (Davis, Ace,\nthose who leave a dating partner, those who are committed to\na deteriorating relationship continue to invest in the relation-\nship, find the relationship satisfying, devalue alternative\nrelationships, stalk, and profess commitment after the rela-\nBecause there once was a relationship, there was a rather\nhigh level of interdependence, including familiarity with and\nknowledge of the love object. Thus, individuals who are left\nby a lover can harbor lingering feelings of attraction for their\npast lover, longing for the resumption of the relationship\n(Baumeister & Wotman, 1992; Sprecher, Felmlee, Metts,\nattraction\" may have a biological basis that explains why\nrejection produces more passion (Fisher, 2004), and attempts\nto reestablish the relationship can intensify into stalking\nUnequal Love Relationship\nOnce a romantic relationship has been initiated, there may be\ndifferences in the intensity of love, in the nature of the love\nexperienced by the two individuals, or differences in the\nexpectations about the pace of relationship development.\nQuantitative asymmetry refers to differences in the intensity\nof the love experienced or differences in the various dimen-\nsions of intensity, such as onset latency, duration, action\nreadiness, and overall intensity (Arriaga, 2001; Frijda,\nQualitative asymmetry occurs when two individuals\nobtain different types of outcomes from a relationship. Love\ncan involve numerous distinct qualities, such as passion, inti-\nmacy, and commitment (Sternberg, 1986); attachment, care-\ngiving, and sexuality (Shaver & Hazan, 1988; Shaver &\nand companionate love (Berscheid & Walster, 1978); caring\nand needing (Kelley et al., 1983); and mixes of eros, ludus,\nAn imbalance can occur in any of these qualitative aspects of\nlove. For example, a lover can be dissatisfied because high\npassion and low commitment are experienced and desired\nfrom the partner, but the partner experiences and seeks low\npassion and high commitment (Regan, 1998).\nBringle et al. 3\nBaumeister et al. (1993) reported the prevalence of three\ntypes of quantitatively differentiated UL experiences: a casual\nattraction; a moderate attraction; and a powerful, intense, and\nserious attraction.

Hill, Blakemore, and\nyears) and found that the frequency of UL was significantly\nhigher for males (3.06) than the frequency of mutual love in\nwas significantly lower than mutual love for females: 2.50).\nStudy 1a sought descriptive information about the preva-\nlence of ULby measuring the frequency and intensity of the five\ntypes of UL relationships and equal, reciprocated love. Because\nUL is an \"easy\" kind of love (low investment, low interdepen-\ndence; Baumeister et al., 1993), UL was expected to be more\nfrequent than equal love. Because equal love is emotionally ful-\nfilling love (Aron & Aron, 1986), and because Berscheid and\nAmmazzalorso (2001) predicted more intense emotional\nresponses for more interdependent relationships, the general\nintensity of the emotional experience for equal love was hypoth-\nesized to be greater than that for UL and to be greater for types\nof UL with presumed higher interdependency.\nMethod\nParticipants. Respondents were 153 high school students (60\nUniversity students were given extra credit in a psychology\ncourse for their participation.\nQuestionnaire.The questionnaire presented descriptions of\nsix different types of love relationships:\n1. A huge \"crush\" on someone you do not know person-\nally, nor ever really expect to know, like a movie star,\nrock star, or athlete.\n2. A huge crush on someone you know, but for one rea-\nson or another you have not let that person know of\nyour feelings for him or her.\n3. A relationship in which you are (were) actually pur-\nsuing the person you are (were) in love with, but so\nfar have been unsuccessful in winning that person's\nlove in return.\n4. A love relationship that has ended for whatever rea-\nson, but one in which you still long for that partner\nalthough there is no prospect of reuniting.\n5. A love relationship in which you are (were) currently\ninvolved romantically, but one in which you feel that\nyou love the partner more, were more committed to,\nand put more effort into the relationship than did your\npartner.\n6. A love relationship involving an equal love--rela-\ntionships in which you are (or were) in love with\nsomeone who loves (or loved) you just as much in\nreturn.\nRespondent were asked to consider instances of love in\nthe last 2 years. A period of 2 years was selected because\nhigh school students were included in the sample and a lon-\nger time frame might have included years during which they\nhad little interest in romantic relationships. Respondents\nwere asked to indicate all instances of each type of love rela-\ntionship by writing the initials of the love object. For each\nrelationship listed, they were asked to indicate the age at\nwhich the relationship began, the length of time that the\nrelationship lasted, whether it was a current relationship,\nand the intensity of the feelings that they had for the love\nobject on a scale ranging from 1 (no feelings) to 7 (extremely\nintense feelings).\nResults\nTwo indices of frequency were examined: whether the\nrespondent reported any occurrence of a type of relationship\nand the number of instances of each type of relationship (see\nTable 1). Equal romantic love was experienced by 70% of\nthe sample during the past 2 years; respondents reported pur-\nsuing a relationship with someone for whom they had roman-\ntic thoughts or feelings less frequently than they had those\nfeelings; and instances of all types of UL were over 4 times\nmore prevalent than equal love.\nDue to the statistical interdependence of different types of\nlove (i.e., one participant could report on several different\ntypes of love relationships or more than one instance of the\nsame type of love relationship), it was not possible to con-\nduct statistical analyses that assume either independent or\ndependent observations. Therefore, a comparison of types of\nrelationships on intensity was conducted by computing a z\nscore for the mean intensity score for each UL group by\nthe equal love group (see Table 2). This method of analysis\nprovides a way to compare each type of UL with equal love\n(e.g., the absolute value of the average z scores is an indica-\ntor of the magnitude of difference), avoids the problems of\nmissing data and unequal occurrences of different types of\nlove relationships, and makes the results more readily inter-\npretable (J. Cohen & Cohen, 1975). Respondents reported\nsignificantly lower intensity for each type of UL relationship\n(z > 1.96), and the average intensity across all types of UL\nwas significantly lower than equal love.\n4 SAGE Open\nA similar analysis was conducted for duration. On the\nquestionnaire, respondents indicated if a relationship were\ncurrent and these relationships were excluded from this anal-\nysis of duration because they had not been terminated.\nApproximately one third of the respondents reported an\nongoing equal love relationship (.33), whereas the average\nnumber of ongoing UL relationships per respondent was\nlong for = .04). However, the cumulative frequency of all\nongoing UL relationships (.59) was greater than equal love.\nFor those relationships that had ended, loving someone\nnearby and pursuing someone were of shorter duration than\nequal love (Table 2). A terminated relationship may have\nstarted before the 2-year period; therefore, the relationship\nduration could exceed 24 months. The other types of UL\nrelationships, and UL in general, were not markedly different\nin duration from equal love.\nDiscussion\nStudy 1a assessed the prevalence and intensity of five differ-\nent types of UL and equal love occurring during a 2-year\nthree intensities of UL per year were reported and Hill et al.\nthe 16- to 20-year age group. The current research found a\ngreater number of instances (1.91 reported instances of all\ntypes of UL per year) than both of these studies. The higher\nnumber in the current research may have resulted from the\nmultiple, specific prompts given to respondents for the dif-\nferent types of UL relationships. Nonetheless, the conclusion\nfrom all three studies is that UL is common among young\nadults.\nIn addition, UL was over 4 times more frequent than\nequal love, which is very different from Hill et al.'s (1997)\nstudy, in which the frequencies of UL and mutual love\nwere similar for the 16- to 20-year age group. Hill et al.\n(1997) also reported the highest frequency of UL for the\n16- to 20-year age group. One explanation for the higher\nfrequency in the current research is that equal love is more\nenduring than UL. This is the case in general and, specifi-\ncally, for two types of UL (nearby lover and pursued lover).\nDuration was analyzed only for those relationships that\nhad terminated, which may disproportionately exclude\nequal love relationships. However, the frequency of all\nongoing UL relationships exceeded ongoing equal love\nrelationships. The higher frequency of UL relationships,\nthen, is partially accounted for by their shorter duration,\nbut is not attributable to differential inclusion in the analy-\nses of duration.\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics for Each Type of Relationship in Study 1a.\nPercentage indicating at least one instance Average frequency per respondent\nAt least one type of unrequited love 88 \nAll types of unrequited love 3.82\nAt least one instance of all types 97 \nTable 2. Intensity and Duration for Each Type of Relationship in Study 1a.\nIntensity z score Duration z score\nNote. The z scores show the degree of difference between equal love relationships and the type of unrequited love relationship represented in each row.\nBringle et al. 5\nAnother factor that contributes to the higher frequency of\nUL is that multiple instances were reported. Only 1 partici-\npant out of 104 reported two simultaneous, ongoing equal\nlove relationships. But equal love does not preclude the\nexperience of UL. Just more than 25% (n = 29) of those cur-\nrently in equal love relationships also reported that they were\nexperiencing some form of UL. In addition, 33 participants\nreported multiple ongoing UL relationships. Thus, UL rela-\ntionships were more prevalent than equal love relationships\nbecause they coexisted with other types of love relationships\nduring the sampled time frame.\nAs hypothesized, forms of UL that are presumed to be less\ninterdependent were more common. Consistent with\nBerscheid and Ammazzalorso's (2001) theory, the pattern of\nz scores supports the ordering of types of UL relationships\nfrom highly interdependent to less interdependent because\nthose that are presumed to be more interdependent yielded\nmore intense emotions and were closer approximations to\nequal love. In addition, UL, in terms of general emotional\nresponses, was less intense than equal love. This is consistent\nwith psychological theories of love that posit an emotionally\nrich prototype of consummate love (e.g., Aron & Aron,\n1986). However, this finding is inconsistent with conjectures\nthat emphasize how fantasy can feed UL (Berscheid &\n1979), and how reality constraints can reduce the emotions\nexperienced in an actual relationship (Murray et al., 1996;\nResearchers typically define love in terms of the essential\ncharacteristics of consummate romantic love (e.g., Aron &\nqualities that may be typical of actual romantic relationships\nthat fall short of the ideal, prototype (Fehr, 1988), or para-\ntrates the variety of attributes that can be associated with as\nmany as 15 types of love, not all of which are measured\nadequately in romantic love scales.\nFurthermore, there may be an important conceptual dis-\ntinction between theories and descriptions of \"love\" and\ntheories and descriptions of \"falling in love\" (Aron, Dutton,\nWiesmann, 1997), with the latter being more germane to\nexperiences of UL. For example, Aron et al. (1989) found\nthat accounts of falling in love failed to reflect some of the\nqualities (arousal, perceived similarity) that are central to\ntypical conceptualizations of love.\nTennov's (1979) discussion of limerence identifies sev-\neral qualities that are not well captured in extant measures\nof love and that are posited to be components of UL (see\nFor example, her characterization of limerence details an\nobsessive quality of intrusive thoughts about the love object.\nHowever, there are divergent views in the literature concern-\ning how obsessiveness might be related to UL versus equal\nlove and how it might be related to the five types of UL in\nthis research. For example, Brehm (1992) speculated that\nobsessiveness will be more likely when a person has little\nreal information about the love object. Thus, UL relation-\nships should possess greater obsessiveness than equal love\nrelationships and less interdependent types of UL should\nshow greater obsessiveness than more interdependent types.\nHowever, Tesser and Paulus (1976) found positive associa-\ntions between thoughts about the love object, contact with\nthe love object (dating), and reports of love. This would lead\nto the expectation of greater obsessiveness in more interde-\npendent types of love relationships.\nA second characteristic of limerence is idealizing or glori-\nfying the love object. As Money (1980) noted, \"the person\nprojects onto the partner an idealized and highly idiosyn-\ncratic image that diverges from the image of that partner as\nperceived by other people\" (p. 65). Gaining information\nabout the love object that conflicts with idealized expecta-\ntions should produce decreased idealization of the love\nTesser and Paulus found little evidence that these reality con-\nstraints reduced love, this line of reasoning predicts that UL\nrelationships would exhibit greater idealization than equal\nlove relationships, and less interdependent types of UL rela-\ntionships would exhibit more idealization than more interde-\npendent ones.\nOne quality about which the lover can idealize is the per-\nceived similarity between the self and the love object. In\ninterpersonal attraction research (e.g., Byrne, 1971), similar-\nity is a relatively powerful determinant of attraction.\nMontoya, Horton, and Kirchner (2008) found in a meta-\nanalysis of research that perceived similarity was a signifi-\ncant correlate of attraction across a wide range of relationship\ntypes (e.g., limited interactions, short-term relationships,\nexisting relationships) and a better predictor of attraction\nthan actual similarity. Distortions of perceived similarity\ncould be easiest when there is scant information about the\nlove object. In the absence of accurate information conveyed\nthrough firsthand experience and prolonged interactions, the\nperson loving from afar should be able to imagine that the\nlove object constitutes a perfect match. Therefore, UL (vs.\nequal love) could be fueled by the perception of exaggerated\nsimilarity and less interdependent types of UL relationships\nwould be most susceptible to this effect. The perceived\nknowledge of the love object was predicted to show similar\nresults.\nBaumeister et al. (1993) found that about half of their\nenamored respondents reported diminished self-esteem and\nfeelings of inferiority as a result of their plight. Fiske and\nPeterson (1991) found a positive association between depres-\nsion and UL. Furthermore, Smith and Hokland (1988) found\nthat greater depression and anxiety, and lower self-confidence\n6 SAGE Open\nand well-being were more characteristic of UL relationships\nthan equal love relationships (see also Murray, Holmes,\nGriffin, Bellavia, & Rose, 2001). Therefore, feelings of infe-\nriority were expected to be greater for UL than equal love, but\nthe more interdependent types were expected to engender\ngreater feelings of inferiority (vs. the less interdependent\ntypes) due to the greater sense of rejection and lack of fulfill-\nment inherent in them.\nMethod\nParticipants.Respondents were 239 high school students\n6.36). University students were given extra credit in a psy-\nchology course for their participation.1\nQuestionnaire.\nSome items for the questionnaire were\nselected from existing scales to represent the following\ndomains: commitment, idealization of the love object,\nobsessive thoughts for the love object, ambivalent feelings\nfor the love object (e.g., inferiority, rejection), perceived\nsimilarity of the love object, and presumed knowledge of\nthe love object.2\nProcedures. Questionnaires provided a description of one of\nthe six types of love relationships (the five types of UL and\nequal love) and were randomly distributed to respondents.\nRespondents were asked whether they were currently experi-\nencing that type of love relationship. If yes, they completed\nthe questionnaire referring to that relationship. If not, they\nwere asked whether they had experienced that type of love\nrelationship within the past 2 years. If yes, they were\ninstructed to choose the most intense example of that type of\nrelationship that had occurred in the past 2 years and com-\nplete the questionnaire referring to that relationship. If not,\nthey were instructed to contact the researcher, who gave\nthem another questionnaire with a different type of love rela-\ntionship. This procedure was continued until the respondent\ncould complete a questionnaire.\nResults\nThe following frequencies were obtained for the types of\nlove relationships: crush on a star (n = 36, 8.9%), nearby (n\nfrom a past relationship (n = 56, 13.8%), unequal love (n =\nFactor analysis. Numerous principal components factor anal-\nyses were conducted on all items measuring qualities that\nmay be distinct to UL relationships. Factor analyses were\nconducted using all respondents, only respondents in longing\nfor a past lover or in equal and unequal love relationships,\nand only those in equal and unequal love relationships. In\naddition, each of these principal components factor analyses\nwas conducted imposing various constraints on the number\nof factors extracted. Finally, principal components factor\nanalyses were conducted with both orthogonal (varimax) and\noblique (oblimin) rotations. The factor structure was rela-\ntively stable across these different analyses.3 Four items\nloaded on several different factors in different analyses or\nthey formed idiosyncratic factors; these items were elimi-\nnated from additional analyses.\nThe first factor, Fulfillment ( = .91), was composed of 13\nitems measuring relationship satisfaction (e.g., For me,\n______ is the perfect romantic partner; I believe a relation-\nship with ______ is capable of satisfying me overall, for-\never). The second factor, Ambivalence ( = .83), contained\neight items related to both the positive and negative qualities\nof love (e.g., Sometimes I feel my life would be much better\nif I didn't love ______; but other times ______ makes me\nhappy; concerning my relationship with ______, I some-\ntimes feel that I can't live with ______ and I can't live with-\nout ______). The third factor, Obsession ( = .86), contained\nsix items intended to measure preoccupation with the love\nobject (e.g., I find it hard to concentrate on my work because\nI can't get ______ off my mind; I find myself thinking about\n______ all the time). The fourth factor, Homogamy ( = .85),\ncontained seven items intended to measure perceived simi-\nlarity between the love object and the respondent (e.g.,\n______ and I are very much alike in many ways; I believe\nthat ______ and I could talk about the same things for hours\non end). The fifth factor, Knowledge ( = .88), contained\nthree items intended to measure perceived knowledge of the\nlove object (e.g., I am aware of ______'s shortcomings and\nfaults; I am aware of what kind of person ______ is for I\nknow all about his/her past). The final factor, Inferiority ( =\n.67), contained four items intended to measure feelings of\ninferiority and rejection (e.g., I am afraid ______ will reject\nme in the future; sometimes my relationship with ______\nmakes me feel inferior).\nTable 3 shows the correlations between factors. The scales\nmeasuring Fulfillment, Obsession, Homogamy, and\nKnowledge were moderately intercorrelated (average r =\n.46). Inferiority and Ambivalence were correlated, but rela-\ntively independent of the other scales.\nAnalyses. To provide comparisons with equal love, z scores\nwere computed for each scale using the mean and standard\ndeviation of the equal love group on that scale. A two-way\nMANOVA (Type of relationship \u00d7 Gender) based on all stan-\ndardized scale scores revealed a significant multivariate\n.01, Wilks's lambda = .67, and a significant interaction of\nFor the Type of relationship main effect, Table 4 reports\nthe results of the analyses on the significant univariate main\neffects (all variables except Obsession). The planned contrast\nBringle et al. 7\nof equal love to all types of UL showed a significant differ-\nence for all measures except Obsession. UL relationships, as\na group, demonstrated lower Fulfillment, Homogamy, and\nKnowledge, but greater Ambivalence and Inferiority. The lin-\near and quadratic trends were calculated across the types of\nUL relationships. There were dominant linear trends for\nFulfillment, Ambivalence, and Knowledge. In addition, there\nwas a significant quadratic trend for Inferiority. Furthermore,\nDuncan's multiple range tests indicated that, forAmbivalence,\ncrush on a star, loving someone nearby, and equal love were\nassociated with significantly less Ambivalence than the\nremaining relationships.\nTable 5 reports the means for the two significant univari-\nate interactions. In general, male and females responses for\nFulfillment were the same except that Duncan multiple range\ntests revealed that males scored significantly lower than\nfemales on Fulfillment when pursuing, and males scored sig-\nnificantly lower on Fulfillment than females when in equal\nlove relationships. For Inferiority, females scored signifi-\ncantly higher than males when pursuing.\nDiscussion\nStudy 1b was designed to detect the presence of several\nqualities (perceived similarity, perceived knowledge, and\nobsessiveness) that theorists (e.g., Aron et al., 1998; Noller,\nUL. Some of the items measuring these qualities were\nrevised so that they would apply to the UL relationships.\nThese revisions, if anything, would have allowed respon-\ndents more latitude to endorse the item when considering\nUL relationships.\nThe results failed to demonstrate that the presence of per-\nceived homogamy and perceived knowledge were distinctive\nof any type of UL, relative to equal love. Contrary to the\npredictions associated with limerence (Tennov, 1979),\nknowledge and obsessiveness were positively, not negatively\nTable 3.

In addition, level of obsessiveness was similar in UL\nrelationships and equal love relationships. Thus, the findings\nfor perceived similarity, perceived knowledge, and obses-\nsiveness were not consistent with the presumption that limer-\nence is a dominant characteristic of UL, even when a test of\nthis hypothesis was biased toward confirmation. The results\nconcerning inferiority conceptually replicated those showing\nthat UL relationships were associated with more negative\noutcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety, poorer well-being) than\nequal love relationships (Smith & Hokland, 1988).\nThe experience of love has been described in theories as sub-\nsuming a variety of attributes. Love involves passion, inti-\nmacy, and commitment (Sternberg, 1986); attachment,\ncaregiving, and sexuality (Shaver et al., 1996; Shaver &\ncompanionate (Berscheid & Walster, 1978); caring and need-\nThe prototype of UL occurs when the imbalance is such that\nit generates longing, obsession (Tennov, 1979), and \"empti-\nnot typically associated with romantic love. As most roman-\ntic relationships fall short of the ideal (e.g., Sprecher et al.,\n1998), actual romantic love, including UL, may incorporate\nthese and other negative emotions, even though Baumeister\net al. (1993) found that would-be lovers reported more posi-\ntive than negative emotions.\nThe most dominant dimension in C. Hendrick and\nHendrick's (1989) analysis of romantic love was passion\n(Grote & Frieze, 1994). The literature, however, provides\ncontradictory bases for predicting whether UL contains\ngreater, equal, or less passion than equal love. Sternberg's\n(1986) theory differentiates equal, consummate love (pas-\nsion, commitment, and intimacy) from infatuation (passion\nwithout commitment and intimacy), suggesting that passion\nshould be high for both types of love.\ntheory of love suggests that relationship development toward\nconsummate love should show growth of all positive out-\ncomes, such as interdependence, friendship, commitment,\nand passion. This perspective leads to the expectation that\npassion increases as the level of interdependence in this type\nof love relationship increases. Alternatively, limerence\n(Tennov, 1979) suggests that UL would have a higher level\nof passion than commensurate love.\nWhile Study 1a measured the intensity of emotional reac-\ntions in general and Study 1b measured limerent qualities of\nlove, Study 2 was designed to differentiate the components\nof consummate and UL, determine how UL might differ\nfrom equal love on these dimensions, and determine how\nthese emotions (e.g., passion, intimacy, commitment) varied\nfor different types of UL relationships. In addition, Study 2\ndirectly tested the assumption that types of UL can be orga-\nnized by levels of presumed interdependence. Specifically,\nthe level of commitment (a dimension of love and interde-\nbe lower for less interdependent types of UL (i.e., crush on\nsomeone who is unavailable, crush on someone nearby with-\nout initiating a romantic relationship) and highest for unequal\nlove. In addition, all types of UL were expected to show\nlower levels of commitment than equal love.\nFinally, discriminate validity of these dimensions was\nsought by comparing both types of love relationships with a\nnonlove relationship (friendship). Davis and Todd (1982)\ndemonstrated that love and friendships have unique character-\nistics (see also Grote & Frieze, 1994); love was found to have\nstronger passion, fascination, and sexual desire. However,\nboth relationships provide important social support.\nMethod\nParticipants. Respondents were 44 high school students (23\nversity students were given extra credit in a psychology\ncourse for their participation.\nQuestionnaire. C. Hendrick and Hendrick (1989) provided a\nsynthesis of the various approaches to measuring love and\nidentify the underlying dimensions inherent in these mea-\nsures. Their factor structure for scale scores served as a pre-\nliminary basis for sampling items from existing scales. Items\nfor the questionnaire were selected from existing scales to\nrepresent the following four factors identified in C. Hendrick\nand Hendrick's (1989) study: (a) passionate love, intimacy,\nand commitment; (b) absence of conflict; (c) anxiety, depen-\ndency, and jealousy; and (d) friendship. To represent the self-\nwere also identified and sampled.4\nThe questionnaire also contained Rusbult's (1983) mea-\nsure of commitment. Four-item subscales measuring satis-\nfaction,alternatives,andinvestmentswereused.Commitment\nwas computed as the following linear combination of rela-\ntionship satisfaction (RSAT), investments (INV), and alter-\nnatives (ALT): COMM = RSAT + INV - ALT.\nProcedures. Respondents were presented with descriptions of\nthe types of love relationships from less interdependent to\nhighly interdependent. The next-to-last choice described an\nequal love relationship and the last choice gave the following\ndescription of a friendship: You are in a relationship in which\nyour feelings for the person you have in mind could best be\ndescribed as a genuine, caring friendship. Respondents were\ninstructed to choose the first description that described a cur-\nrent relationship and complete the questionnaire referring to\nthat relationship. The descriptions were ordered by\nBringle et al. 9\ninterdependence to obtain sufficient numbers of persons\nchoosing the less interdependent types of love relationships,\nassuming that everyone would have a current friendship.\nResults\nIn spite of the instructions that respondents were to choose\nthe first type of relationship that described a current relation-\nship, crush on a star had a low frequency of being chosen (n =\n5, 1%). The other types produced more proportionate selec-\nfor someone from a past relationship (n = 77, 15.2%),\nFactor analyses. Numerous principal components factor anal-\nyses were conducted on all items except Rusbult's scales.\nRusbult's measure was retained separately because it consti-\ntuted a more direct examination of the hypothesis that the\nfive types of UL were ordered according to the level of inter-\ndependence. Factor analyses were conducted using all\nrespondents. However, the entire sample included some per-\nsons who completed the questionnaire while referring to a\nfriendship. Having respondents complete the \"love\" scale\nwhile referring to a friendship is useful for purposes of com-\nparison across types of relationships, but is not entirely\nappropriate for examining the factor structure of a love scale.\nTherefore, the principal components factor analyses were\nalso conducted excluding respondents in the friendship con-\ndition. In addition, respondents in C. Hendrick and Hen-\ndrick's research were undergraduates who were asked to\nrefer to their current dating partner or their last dating part-\nner. Because our sample also included respondents who were\nreferring to other types of love relationships, the factor anal-\nyses were also conducted for only those respondents who\ncompleted the questionnaire for unequal and equal love rela-\ntionships. In addition, each of these principal components\nfactor analyses was conducted imposing various constraints\non the number of factors extracted. Finally, principal compo-\nnents factor analyses were conducted with both orthogonal\n(varimax) and oblique (oblimin) rotations.\nThere were some differences in the factor structure across\nanalyses. On some analyses, the first factor split into two fac-\ntors; however, the correlation between these two subscales\nwas very high (r > .75). Five items loaded on several differ-\nent factors, depending on the subsample selected and the\nrotation procedure employed; these 5 items were eliminated\nfrom additional analyses. The remaining 50 items demon-\nstrated remarkable consistency in factor structure across\nanalyses.\nThe factors identified from the analysis of items partially\ncorroborated C. Hendrick and Hendrick's factor structure\nwhen they analyzed scale scores. There was a dominant fac-\ntor (based on all love relationships and varimax rotation, per-\ncentage variance = 33.7) that was labeled Passion ( = .97)\nand corresponded to C. Hendrick and Hendrick's first factor\n(e.g., I melt when I look deeply into ______'s eyes; I would\nrather be with ______ than anyone else). The second factor\nconsisted of eight items and was labeled Sacrifice ( = .90,\nfor example, If I were going through a difficult time, I would\nput away my own concerns to help ______ out; I would do\nalmost anything for ______). This factor does not correspond\nto any of C. Hendrick and Hendrick's factors (Agape loaded\non their first factor). The third factor extracted contained\nseven items dealing with turmoil and tension ( = .83, for\nexample, Sometimes I feel that loving ______ have changed\nme for the worse; There is tension in my relationships with\n______). The fourth factor was composed of five items creat-\ning an index of Dependency ( = .83, for example, It would\nbe hard for me to get along without ______ in my life; I\nbelieve that ______ is almost completely responsible for my\nfeelings of sadness and happiness). Another factor, Practical,\nwas composed of three items ( = .50, for example, I con-\nsider a relationship with ______ would reflect favorably on\nmy career; I believe an important factor in choosing a partner\nis whether or not he/she would be a good parent). Although\nthe reliability was low, because the score was based on only\nthree items, it was included in subsequent analyses.\nRusbult's 12-item measure of commitment (4 items each\nfor satisfaction, alternatives, and investments) had a coeffi-\nTable 6 reports the correlations between the factor scores,\ncomputed with unit weighting. In general, the scores were\nmoderately correlated with each other, with the exception of\nTurmoil. The average of the absolute values of the correla-\ntions of other variables and Turmoil was .12, whereas the\naverage of the absolute values of the correlations of the other\nvariables with each other was .55.\nTable 6. Correlations Between Factor Scores in Study 2.\nPassion (1) Sacrifice (2) Turmoil (3) Dependency (4) Practical (5) Commitment (6)\nAnalyses. To provide a comparison with equal love, z scores\nwere created for each scale extracted by the factor analysis\nusing the mean and standard deviation of the equal love\ngroup. Because of the small size of the group describing a\ncrush on a star, this group was deleted from all inferential\nanalyses.\nThe MANOVA based on all scales found a significant\nmultivariate main effect for Type of relationship, F(30, 1726)\nparisons were computed for each significant univariate type\nof relationship main effect. First, the average of all types of\nlove relationships was compared with friendship. Second,\nequal love was compared with friendship. Third, the average\nof all types of UL relationships was compared with equal\nlove. In all cases, except Turmoil and Sacrifice (see Table 7),\neach contrast was significant. The lack of significance for the\nfirst contrast on Sacrifice indicates that love, in general, and\nfriendships both involve similar amounts of sacrifice,\nalthough the types of love differed. The lack of significance\nfor the second contrast on Turmoil indicates that the level of\nTurmoil was similar in friendships and equal love relation-\nships, but it was significantly lower than that in UL\nrelationships.\nTo evaluate the rationale for ordering types of UL on a\ncontinuum of interdependence, the linear trend was calcu-\nlated for the types of UL relationships (equal love was not\nincluded in these analyses; when it was included, the linear\ntrends were more pronounced). The linear trend was signifi-\ncant for each of the dependent variables except Practical (see\nDiscussion\nThe primary purpose of Study 2 was to identify similarities\nand differences between types of love relationships and\nfriendships on dimensions of love. UL was found to be quite\ndistinct from equal love in terms of the intensity of each\ncomponent of love. On each of the positive dimensions (pas-\nsion, sacrifice, dependency, commitment, and practical love),\nUL relationships as a group reported less intense feelings and\nbeliefs, which corroborates and expands on the findings of\nStudy 1a. In addition, the most interdependent type of UL\n(unequal love) showed significantly more passion, sacrifice,\ndependency, and commitment than did the least interdepen-\ndent type (loving someone who is nearby), again supporting\nthe conceptual ordering of UL relationships on the presumed\ndimension of interdependency.\nIf infatuation is a characteristic of the less interdependent\nforms of UL (e.g., S. S. Hendrick & Hendrick, 1992), then\npassion should have been high for all types of UL (Sternberg,\n1986). However, a significant linear component was found\nacross the four types of UL, such that persons in the more\ninterdependent types reported higher levels of passion.\nUnbridled passion, then, is not uniformly experienced in all\nforms of UL (Regan, 1998). Nor is there evidence that actual\nrelationships supply \"reality constraints\" that reduce passion\nalso consistent with earlier results that failed to support pre-\ndictions about limerence (Study 1b).\nHowever, the experience of love is not limited to just pos-\nitive feelings. Interestingly, the most significant deviation\nfrom the pattern of correlated factors was for Turmoil, which\nsuggests that such negative feelings can coexist with various\nlevels of positive feelings (cf. Berscheid & Walster, 1978).\nFurthermore, these negative feelings (turmoil) were more\nevident in UL than in either equal love or friendships.\nHowever, turmoil was more evident in more interdependent\nthan in less interdependent types of UL. Thus, the less inter-\ndependent forms of UL provide not only low positive emo-\ntional payoffs (e.g., passion) but also fewer emotional costs\nTable 7.

However, to the extent that the types are viewed as a\nprogression toward equal romantic love, there were increas-\ning costs (turmoil) as a love relationship became more inter-\nThe results also provide evidence of discriminate validity\nfor these dimensions of love. In comparison with equal love,\nindividuals who completed the questionnaire for a friendship\nscored significantly lower on all dimensions except Turmoil\n(Davis & Todd, 1982). In addition, all types of love (equal\nand unrequited) were rated significantly higher than friend-\nship on all dimensions except Sacrifice.\nGeneral Discussion\nWith few exceptions (e.g., Aron & Aron, 1991; Aron et al.,\net al., 1997), empirical research on romantic love has neither\ndifferentiated UL nor studied it as a separate construct.\ntheory of love, and different kinds of love warrant different\ntheories. Sternberg and Weis's (2006) compendium of\nresearch on love does not have UL in the index and authors\ngenerally fail to differentiate UL as a type of love (with the\nexception of cursory mention of infatuation, lust, and incom-\nplete love). However, Berscheid (2010) contended that con-\nfusion around the conceptualization of love and clear\ndifferentiation of love is necessary for enhancing the quality\nof research on love. The current research demonstrates the\nhigh prevalence of UL, relative to equal love, and the distinc-\ntive nature of UL (e.g., emotional and behavioral manifesta-\ntion). Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the causes\nand consequences of UL warrant separate theoretical and\nPrevious attempts to describe and understand the nature\nof UL have found placing analyses of love within a com-\nparative context useful. Baumeister et al. (1993) chose to\ncompare the experiences of the enamored with the experi-\nences of the person being pursued. Hill et al. (1997) com-\npared frequencies of UL with mutual love. Aron and Aron\n(1991) differentiated three types of UL (secret, jilted, and\nhanger on) and compared them within the context of self-\nexpansion theory, and Aron et al. (1998) analyzed how\nstrengths of three motives were related to the intensity of UL\nfor persons with different adult romantic attachment styles.\nThe current research expanded on these research strategies\nby differentiating five types of UL that are assumed to be\nconceptually organized in terms of interdependence, and\nthen measured their prevalence, emotional experiences in\ngeneral, emotional experiences common to romantic love,\nand experiences assumed to be unique to UL. Several find-\nings support the conceptualization of different types of UL\nbased on levels of presumed interdependence. Study 1a\nshowed that the more interdependent types of UL relation-\nships elicited reports of greater intensity and were longer in\nduration (Berscheid & Ammazzalorso, 2001). In Study 1b,\nless interdependent types of UL were less fulfilling than\nmore interdependent types of UL and persons involved in\nUL love relationships with less interdependence were less\nknowledgeable about the partner than those in more interde-\npendent love relationships. Study 2 provided additional sup-\nport for the distinction by demonstrating that more\ninterdependent UL relationships were characterized by more\ncommitment, dependency, passion, and sacrifice.\nThis research expanded on Baumeister et al.'s (1993)\nresearch by comparing the reported experiences of those in\ndifferent types of UL relationships with the reported experi-\nences of persons in equal love (Studies 1a, 1b, and 2) and\nfriendship relationships (Study 2). This research expanded\non Hill et al.'s (1997) study by comparing five different types\nof UL and equal love on not just frequencies but also intensi-\nties of various emotions (e.g., passion) and beliefs (e.g.,\ncommitment). These different research strategies begin a\nprocess of triangulation from which a greater understanding\nof the nature of UL can proceed.\nFor example, Baumeister et al. (1993) found that the\nenamored reported more positive feelings than did the reject-\ners. Lemieux and Hale (1999) found passion and intimacy to\nbe stronger than commitment in young dating adults. The\ncurrent research found that the enamored in all five types of\nUL relationships reported less intense positive feelings than\ndid those in equal love relationships (Hill et al., 1997, did not\nreport results on intensity). These results are inconsistent\nwith the assumption that UL is a euphoric type of love in\nwhich the enamored reaps some of the benefits of being in\nlove (the feelings of excitement, passion, lust, identification,\ndistortions of presumed similarity) unencumbered by the\ncosts and hassles of a real romantic relationship (cf.\n1976). These results are also inconsistent with the assump-\ntion that the distortion, imagination, and fantasies of UL pro-\nvide exaggerated benefits (and very high costs such as\nsuffering) that approximate or exceed those reported in con-\nsummate love relationships (Murray et al., 1996; Tennov,\n1979). If these states do exist in UL, then the retrospective\naccounts suggest that they are more ephemeral than or not as\nsalient as equal love relationships. Real love may not be a\nstate of unqualified bliss; however, this research shows that\nUL is inferior to equal love on positive qualities and is not a\ngood approximation of it.\nBaumeister et al. (1993) also found that the enamored\nreported less intense negative feelings than did rejecters in\nUL. The current research found that the enamored in UL\nrelationships generally experienced more intense negative\nfeelings than did those in equal love relationships. Thus,\nthese results are inconsistent with speculation that UL avoids\ncertain costs that are embedded in equal love relationships\n(e.g., Baumeister & Wotman, 1992). However, these results\nare consistent with the portrayals that those in UL relation-\nships suffer from turmoil, suffering, ambivalence, misery,\nUL, then, is not a fulfilling emotional state, circumstance,\nor relationship that provides the benefits of love at low costs\nto the enamored. At best, it provides small rewards at some\ncosts. Furthermore, as the type becomes more interdepen-\ndent and rewards increase, so do the costs until equal love\noccurs or the relationship is terminated (Arriaga, 2001;\nRegan, 1998). This picture of UL highlights its paradoxical\nnature. From the point of view of exchange theory, relation-\nships with this status (low fulfillment, moderate costs) should\nbe infrequent, unstable, and ephemeral. Indeed, UL relation-\nships were found to be of somewhat shorter duration. Yet,\nUL relationships persisted and occurred with a much higher\ncumulative frequency than consummate love. Why? There\nare at least three ways to understand why UL is so prevalent\nand is tolerated by many persons: (a) imperfect practice, (b)\nerrors in the education of attention (Gibson, 1966), and (c)\nincentive.\nThe research started with the question, \"Is UL a type of\nlove?\" In many ways, UL did not measure up to consummate\nlove. However, this research demonstrates that UL does pro-\nvide some of the experiences of love that are not realized in\nfriendships. Aron et al. (1998) found that the intensity of UL\nwas related to the desire to be in love. Thus, one of the\nmotives for pursuing romantic relationships and allowing UL\nrelationships to persist is that they provide the person with\n\"practice at being in love.\" The one characteristic on which\nUL was indistinguishable from equal love was obsessive-\nness. UL does provide the enamored with the opportunity to\nthink about a relationship with the love object and what the\nperson would, for example, do and what they would talk\nabout. The costs for this cognitive practice and preparation\nare comparatively high, particularly when one acts on these\nemotions (Baumeister et al., 1993); but emotional returns\nfrom an UL relationship may be better than no romantic rela-\nThe matching hypothesis predicts that phenotypically\nsimilar persons are more likely to bond (Berscheid & Reis,\n1998). This pattern of positive assortative mating is found to\ngeneralize to various types of relationships (friendships, dat-\ning, marriages), is found for a wide range of characteristics\n(e.g., physical, demographic, social-psychological), and is\nconsistent with numerous theoretical perspectives (e.g.,\ngists have frequently assumed that the matching hypothesis\nis caused by a preference for similarity because similarity is\nrewarding (e.g., Berscheid & Reis, 1998). Thus, individuals\nseek out similar others because they prefer similar others.\nThe matching hypothesis rests on the presumption that\nindividuals develop a means for accurately evaluating the\ndesirability of self and others and selecting another who\nmatches (e.g., Berscheid & Reis, 1998). Thus, the evaluation\nof attributes and matching on those attributes are probably\nacquired skills, and errors would be made in learning these\nskills (Barelds & Barelds-Dijkstra, 2007; Epstude & Forster,\n2011). Some instances of UL may then be evidence of those\nerrors. If so, then UL may occur before persons develop a\ngood sense of self-knowledge, self-appraisal, and the \"edu-\ncation of attention\" (Gibson, 1966) that is necessary to eval-\nLykken and Tellegen (1993) presented provocative data to\nsupport the position that similarity does no more than elimi-\nnate 50% of the pool of potential mates. Within the remain-\ning 50% \"mate-worthy\" group, bonding is, according to\nthem, unpredictable, adventitious, and dependent on idiosyn-\ncratic factors that foster reciprocation. This suggests that\nlust, infatuation, and crushes (Shaver et al., 1996) are gener-\nalized responses that can be easily evoked by a sizable por-\ntion of potential romantic partners. Consistent with this, the\ntype of UL with the highest prevalence was having romantic\nfeelings for someone nearby (Hill et al., 1997). This is con-\nsistent with Lykken and Tellegen's contention that adoles-\ncence may be a critical period predisposed toward infatuation,\nwhich produces a wide array of internal responses (sexual\nfantasies, behavioral intentions) and external responses\n(glances, conversations, propositions, proposals). Lust, then,\ncan be viewed as a fundamental drive with unique biological\nAs previously mentioned, the results describe UL as a\nrelationship providing low rewards at relatively high costs.\nThus, the frequency and persistence of UL may be better\nunderstood in terms of its long-term promise for outcomes\nrather than in terms of immediate payoffs (e.g.,Aron &Aron,\n1996). As the song warns, \"you're nobody 'til somebody\nloves you,\" that message represents a powerful motivator if\npersons believe that they are fundamentally deficient without\nlove and that they can only become whole through love.\nThus, the plight of enamored persons, particularly in the\nmore interdependent types of UL, is partially understood not\nin terms of the immediate net payoffs (e.g., positive and neg-\native feelings, personal and interpersonal fulfillment) in their\nrelationships but in terms of the incentive value of potential\npayoffs as love increases in a relationship (Sprecher, 1999).\nIndeed, Aron et al. (1998) demonstrated that the perceived\ndesirability or value of the potential romantic relationship,\nthe perceived probability of having a romantic relationship,\nand desirability of the state or benefits to the self of the\npotential relationship were each independently important for\nunderstanding the motivation to enter and maintain a UL\nrelationship. For the enamored, pursuing the relationship is a\nhigh-stakes gamble in which the potential for high payoffs\njustifies the use of unscrupulous tactics along with the risks\nof failure, embarrassment, and lowered self-esteem\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. The same participants from Study 1a with 100 additional high\nschool students (who did not complete the measures from\nStudy 1a) completed several other measures of romantic rela-\ntionships at a separate time. Because of the addition of new\nparticipants and the change in focus of the research questions\nexamined in these later questionnaires, these results are pre-\nsented as part of a related study.\n2. The following items were utilized in the questionnaire and\nsubsequent factor analyses: Hatfield and Sprecher's (1986)\nAron, Dutton, Aron, and Allen's (1989) measure of love as\nself-enhancement (1R, 5R), and C. Hendrick and Hendrick's\n47). The \"R\" behind an item number indicates that the item\nwas revised. This also applies to Study 2. Items were revised\nso that they were in the same format and so that they could\nreasonably apply to all types of love relationships as well as\nequal love relationships. For example, Sternberg's item 45 was\nchanged from \"I fantasize about my partner\" to \"I frequently\nfantasize about taking part in romantic activities with _____.\"\nIn addition, 13 original items were included in the question-\nnaire to provide additional measures of each domain.
