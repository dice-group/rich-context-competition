To this end, the focus of this research includes investigating 1)\nwhether friendship between a mate poacher and the person s/he is attempting to attract (the\npoached) influences others' perceptions of the likely success of the mate poacher, 2) the\nrole that friendship may play in mitigating risks and costs associated with the mate\npoaching strategy, and 3) whether friendship modulates perceived personality and\nevolutionarily relevant mate characteristics of the poacher and poached.\nFriendship as a relationship infiltration tactic\nFriendship and mate attraction\nFriendship between a male and female can sometimes act as a precursor to the\nformation of a romantic relationship. Previous friendship is often a very important stage in\nthe development of a long-term romantic relationship (Guerrero and Mongeau, 2008;\nHendrick and Hendrick, 2000). Bleske-Rechek and Buss (2001) found that single men and\nwomen report a more frequent desire to form a committed romantic relationship with their\nfriends than do those already in a relationship. Furthermore, both sexes report a desire for\ncompanionship and emotional support from friends; however, men are more likely to report\npotential sexual access as an important reason to start a friendship than are women,\nwhereas women report social and physical protection from others as more important than\ndo men. These preferences are consistent with Sexual Strategies Theory, suggesting that\nopposite-sex friendship formation may, in some cases, be motivated by factors that can\nsubsequently lead to romantic interest and facilitate the formation of a romantic\nrelationship. Not only does friendship help foster the initiation of a romantic relationship,\nbut it seems to play a major role in relationship maintenance. The degree of friendship\nbetween individuals in a romantic relationship is positively related to both relationship\nsatisfaction and length (Graham, 2011). Furthermore, valuing friendship in a relationship is\na strong positive predictor of feelings of love, sexual gratification, and romantic\ncommitment over time (Vanderdrift, Wilson, and Agnew, 2012).\nGiven friendship's importance in general romantic relationships, friendship between\na mate poacher and poached may be an effective poaching tactic. Previous literature\nsuggests that insertion of the self into the social context of an existing relationship may\nallow for deployment of more direct mate poaching tactics later on (Schmitt and Buss,\n2001; Rusbult and Buunk, 1993). This strategic friendship might not only increase the\nlikelihood that a poaching attempt is successful by appealing to between-sex and across-sex\nmate preferences but may also simultaneously mitigate risks that are unique to mate\npoaching.\nPoaching goals and benefits\nSchmitt and Buss (2001) define mate poaching as behavior intended to attract\nsomeone who is known to already be in a relationship. Studies examining the prevalence of\nmate poaching reveal that mate poaching occurs at a considerable frequency cross-\nwith 30-50% of men and women reporting having engaged, at least once, in mate poaching\nwith the goal of starting a short-term relationship (e.g., one-night stands, brief affairs), or a\nlong-term relationship (e.g., potential marital relationships).\nThe prevalence of mate poaching suggests that it may confer advantages to those\nwho use it and to those targeted by it. Those who engage in mate poaching may benefit\nfrom attempting to attract an individual who has proven to be a viable mating partner.\nHumans partly use others' experiences and mate choices to determine their own mate\nchoice decisions (Grammar, Fink, M\u00f8ller, and Thornhill, 2003; Miller and Todd, 1998;\nTodd, Place, and Bowers, 2012), a process referred to as non-independent mate choice\n(Pruett-Jones, 1992). For example, after observing real speed-date video recordings, both\nmen and women show greater short-term and long-term relationship interest towards\nFriendship as a relationship infiltration tactic\nindividuals in dates they perceive as successful (Place, Todd, Penke, and Asendorpf, 2010).\nThis effect also occurs when assessing individuals who are currently in a relationship.\nWhen presented opposite-sex targets who are either currently in a relationship or single,\nwomen report being more interested in pursuing attached versus unattached targets (Eva\nand Wood, 2006; Parker and Burkley, 2009). This evidence suggests that others' mate-\nchoice decisions help an individual decide which characteristics are desirable in a potential\nmate for both unattached and attached targets.\nSimilarly, someone already in a relationship may benefit from being the target of\nmate poaching. Though the reasons to break-up with one's current mate are numerous and\ncan vary across context and individual factors (Le, Dove, Agnew, Korn, and Mutso, 2010),\nquality of and access to alternative romantic partners can influence mate expulsion\nindividuals may require a realistic mate replacement before leaving their current\nrelationship for a different long-term relationship (Rusbult and Buunk, 1993). Men and\nwomen can also benefit from choosing to go along with a short-term poaching attempt. In\naccordance with a pluralistic mating strategy (Gangestad and Simpson, 2000), having\naccess to a greater variety of sexual partners can afford a male the opportunity to have more\noffspring whereas a female could cuckold her current partner and have children by another,\npotentially higher quality and genetically robust male.\nPoaching risks\nThe goals of a mate poacher include not only acquisition of a mate but subversion\nof that mate's current partner. To protect against this subversion, humans need to identify\npotential mate poachers and also prevent their partner from being poached (Buss, 2002;\nreported that someone had tried to attract a romantic partner away from them in the past, in\ncontrast to 50% of participants who report having attempted to poach, showing that people\nmay have a tendency to over-perceive threats to their relationship. However, only 30%\nreported that their partner was successfully attracted away from them, which suggests this\nsensitivity to potential infidelity may not be without benefit. Types of mate retention\nbehavior and their frequencies were studied in an undergraduate (Buss, 1986) and in a\nmarried couples sample (Buss and Shackelford, 1997). Men's mate retention behavior\npositively covaried with their partner's youth and physical attractiveness and women's\nmate retention behavior positively covaried with their partner's income and status striving.\nAlso, men reported using resource display, submission and debasement, and intrasexual\nthreats to retain their mates more often than women, whereas women reported using\nappearance enhancement and verbal signals of possession more than men.\nTo be successful a mate poacher must be able to successfully avoid or subvert the\nretention tactics of the current partner. Failure to do this can have costly consequences. For\nmen, resource depletion, concerns for a mate's future infidelity, increased risk for disease,\nand physical retribution from the female's mate have all been identified and judged as\ngreater potential costs associated with mate poaching (Buss and Shackelford, 1997; Schmitt\nand Buss, 2001). For women, future infidelity of the man, self-degradation, worries of\nunwanted pregnancy, risk of disease, acquisition of a bad reputation, and physical harm by\nFriendship as a relationship infiltration tactic\nthe partner of the poached are judged as greater potential costs (Davies, Shackelford, and\nHass, 2010; Schmitt and Buss, 2001). Some violent mate retention behaviors can involve\nparticularly serious costs to both the poacher and poached (Shackelford, Buss, and Peters,\nIt would appear, then, that although mate poaching may aid mate acquisition, mate\npoaching entails more and greater risks than those involved in general romantic courtship.\nDavies et al. (2010) found that neither sex perceives the potential costs of mate poaching as\noutweighing the benefits. Hence, the primary objective of the current research is to test the\ngeneral hypothesis that mate poaching is less risky when the mate poacher is a friend with\nthe poached.\nPresent study\nThe current research utilized a true experimental design. Because actual mate\npoaching behavior is difficult to manipulate, we acquired individuals' perceptions of\nhypothetical mate poaching situations. To test how friendship between a poacher and\npoached affects perceptions of mate poaching outcomes and perceptions of the poacher and\npoached's personality traits, participants read one of four fictional accounts of a mate\npoaching attempt. Vignettes and imagined or fictional scenarios have been used in studies\nlooking at impression formation (Sherman and Klein, 1994), infidelity and jealousy (Buss,\nLarsen, Westen, and Semmelroth, 1992; Wade, Kelley, and Church, 2012), and have been\nshown to induce physiological responses similar to experiencing the imagined scenario\n(Buss et al., 1992; Malta et al., 2001). Each vignette varied by whether the poacher was a\nman or woman and whether the poacher and poached were close friends or acquaintances.\nParticipants then rated the likelihood of several poaching outcomes, poacher and poached\nmate attributes, and poacher motivations.\nHypothesis 1: Increased poaching success\nIt was hypothesized that the poacher would be rated as more likely to be successful\nin the poaching attempt when the poacher and poached were close friends than when they\nwere not friends. Friendship may signal attributes important for continued investment in the\nrelationship and future offspring (Guerrero and Mongeau, 2008; Graham, 2011; Hendrick\nand Hendrick, 2000; Vanderdrift et al., 2012); therefore, the poacher may be perceived as a\ndesired replacement for the poached's current mate (Rusbult and Buunk, 1993; Rusbult et\nHypothesis 2: Mitigated costly outcomes\nIt was predicted that when participants observed a mate poaching scenario in which\nthe poacher and poached were close friends as opposed to acquaintances, they would\nevaluate costly outcomes as less likely to occur. Participants rated the likelihood of the\nfollowing risky/costly outcomes: physical retaliation and suspicion from the poached\nindividual's partner, future poached infidelity, shortened relationship duration, peer and\nfamilial disapproval of the relationship, and the poached individual's resentment toward the\npoacher. These outcomes were risky/costly outcomes implicated in Schmitt and Buss\nFriendship as a relationship infiltration tactic\nFriendship may not mitigate every risk; however, we included several types of outcomes to\ncharacterize how friendship moderates poaching success and observer perceptions. For\nexample, if friendship decreases the likelihood of physical retaliation and partner suspicion,\nperhaps friendship functions to avoid third-party detection and punishment. Alternatively,\nif friendship increases the likelihood of poacher/poached relationship longevity, decreases\nthe chance of the poached cheating on the poacher in the future, or is more likely to result\nin approval of friends, family, and the poached, perhaps friendship functions to avoid long-\nterm risks and costs.\nHypothesis 3: Favorable mate attributes\nIt was also predicted that individuals would judge the poacher and poached more\nfavorably across several important mate attributes if they were close friends as opposed to\nacquaintances. Schmitt and Buss (2001) found that those who engaged in mate poaching\ntend to rate themselves lower in Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Those who were\nmore likely to receive poaching attempts tended to be high in Extraversion and Openness to\nExperience, and those who were low in Agreeableness and Conscientiousness and high in\nNeuroticism tended to go along with poaching attempts made upon them. Furthermore,\nmeasures from the \"Sexy Seven\" sexuality attributes inventory (Schmitt and Buss, 2000)\nindicated that those who engage in mate poaching rated themselves as low in relationship\nexclusivity, having an erotophilic disposition (the tendency to react positively to sexual\ncues), being sexually attractive and lacking sexual exclusivity. Those who were more likely\nto receive poaching attempts rated themselves as more sexually attractive and lower in\nrelationship exclusivity, whereas those who were more likely to go along with a mate\npoaching attempt rated themselves low on relationship exclusivity, had a masculine gender\norientation, were low on emotional investment, and were high on erotophilic disposition.\nThis evidence suggests that people may already possess a priori perceptions about those\nwho engage in mate poaching. The positive relationship qualities signaled by friendship\nbetween two mates may lead participants to perceive the poacher and poached as\npossessing more desirable personality and mate attributes than when they are\nacquaintances.\nHypothesis 4: Greater friendship effectiveness for male poachers\nWe hypothesized that participants' perceptions of outcomes and mate attributes may\nbe moderated by the sex of the poacher. Both sexes launch romantic relationships out of\nfriendships (Bleske-Rechek and Buss, 2001); however, men's and women's mate\npreferences may differ on the basis of minimal levels of parental investment in offspring\n(Buss and Schmitt, 1993). Sexual Strategies Theory predicts that females have evolved a\nstronger preference than men for potential long-term mates who are able and willing to\ndevote resources to themselves and their offspring (Buss and Schmitt, 1993; Ellis, 1992).\nAccordingly, if friendship signals traits associated with investment, participants may rate\nfriendship as more effective when the scenarios depicted a male poacher and a female\ntarget.\nFriendship as a relationship infiltration tactic\nHypothesis 5: Poacher motivations\nLastly, we hypothesized that a greater proportion of observers will predict that a\nfriend-poacher is motivated to start a long-term relationship than is an acquaintance-\npoacher. This would further suggest that friendship signals that the poacher is a viable\nreplacement for the poached's current mate and possesses desirable long-term mate\ncharacteristics.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nfrom two populations: 282 Mechanical Turk (MTurk) users and 100 undergraduate students\nfrom a private University in the Northeastern US. MTurk is a crowd-sourcing service\nhosted by Amazon through which participants were paid $0.25 for completion of the\nexperiment. MTurk has been gaining popularity in recent psychological research and has\nbeen shown to be a high quality source of data (Buhrmester, Kwang, and Gosling, 2011).\nAny MTurk participant who completed the survey in less than five minutes was excluded\nfrom analyses to control for individuals who rushed through the survey, resulting in the 282\nparticipants who were used. Undergraduate students were recruited from the psychology\ndepartment research participant pool and received credit in their introductory psychology\nclasses. All procedures of this study were approved by the local Institutional Review\nBoard.\nmajority of the sample was heterosexual (81.1%) with some identifying as homosexual\n(9.7%) and other (9.25%). About three-fourths of the sample reported having ever been in a\nsexual relationship (74.1%). More than half of the sample reported currently being in a\nrelationship (56.8%), whereas 39% reported being currently single and 3.3% were unsure.\nA majority of the sample (83.95%) reported that they were not currently on birth control\nmedication of any type.\nMaterials and procedures\nAfter signing the informed consent, participants were presented with the following\ninstructions:\nFor the following experiment, you will be asked to read a short paragraph detailing\nthe relationship between three individuals. Please take your time to fully read the\nparagraph and form some initial impressions about the individuals described. To do\nthis, you will be asked to imagine that you know these individuals and that you are\na friend, acquaintance, or bystander who happens to observe what is\nhappening between them. After hearing their story, you will be asked to make\nseveral ratings pertaining to the likelihood of certain events happening between\nthese individuals. You will also be asked to rate the individuals on several measures\nof their personality and sexuality. While we realize that you cannot learn everything\nabout a person or group of people from one, short story, we ask that you\nFriendship as a relationship infiltration tactic\nplease make these ratings based on your initial impression of the individuals\ndescribed.\nParticipants were then presented with one of four short vignettes depicting a\nheterosexual mate poaching situation involving three individuals. These individuals were\nthe poacher (the person doing the poaching), the poached (the target of the poaching\nattempt), and the poachee (the person currently in a relationship with the poached). These\nfour vignettes varied across two variables: sex of the poacher/poached and whether the\npoacher and poached were friends. The following two vignette examples demonstrate how\nthe friendship variable was manipulated (See bolded text):\nFriendship Condition\nImagine the following:\nYou happened to hear an interesting story the other day about three people, John,\nSarah, and Chris. Through your own experiences and a few rumors, you piece\ntogether the following information about them.\nJohn and Sarah have been in an exclusive relationship for about a year. Recently,\nJohn and Sarah have been having problems in their relationship and their\nrelationship has been uneasy. Sarah often talks about the problems in her\nrelationship with Chris, a close friend she goes to for advice and comfort, and\nwith whom she enjoys spending time. Chris is attracted to Sarah. He realizes that\nshe is in an exclusive relationship, yet he still flirts with her in hopes that something\nmay happen between Sarah and him.\nFriendship Absent Condition\nImagine the following:\nYou happened to hear an interesting story the other day about three people, John,\nSarah, and Chris. Through your own experiences and a few rumors, you piece\ntogether the following information about them.\nJohn and Sarah have been in an exclusive relationship for about a year. Recently,\nJohn and Sarah have been having problems in their relationship and their\nrelationship has been uneasy. Chris is an acquaintance of Sarah's and they know\nvery little about each other. Chris is attracted to Sarah. He realizes that she is in\nan exclusive relationship, yet he still flirts with her in hopes that something may\nhappen between Sarah and him.\nTo manipulate the sex of the poacher, the vignettes remained the same except that\nChris' name was replaced with \"Rachel,\" and Sarah and John switched roles as poached\nand poached.\nAfter, participants were asked to make several ratings about the poacher's likelihood\nFriendship as a relationship infiltration tactic\nof 1) being successful and 2) incurring future costs/risks. On a 1 to 7 scale from \"Highly\nunlikely\" to \"Highly likely,\" participants were asked:\n1) How likely is it that Chris will succeed in attracting Sarah away from John?\n2) How likely is it that John will suspect that Chris is trying to attract Sarah away\nfrom him?\n3) How likely is it that John will inflict physical harm on Chris for trying to attract\nSarah?\n4) If Chris and Sarah formed a new long-term relationship, how likely is it that the\nrelationship would last for more than a year?\n5) If Chris and Sarah start a new long-term relationship, how likely is it that\nSarah would cheat on him in the future?\n6) How likely is it that their friends will not approve of how Chris and Sarah started\ntheir relationship?\n7) How likely is it that either of their families will not approve of how Chris and\nSarah started their relationship?\n8) How likely is it that Sarah will later resent Chris for the way they started their\nrelationship?\nIn order to collect novel descriptive information not examined in previous literature,\nparticipants were also asked to indicate the following:\n1) In your opinion, is it OK that Chris is trying to attract Sarah away from John?\n(Yes No)\n2) What is most likely the type of relationship that Chris intends to start with Sarah\nby attracting her away from John?\n(A one-night stand. A short-term affair. A new long-term relationship.)\nParticipants were then asked to indicate their impressions of the poacher and poached\nacross several evolutionarily relevant mate characteristics. Using measures from Wade,\nAuer, and Roth (2009), participants rated them on a 1 (Not Very) to 7 (Very) scale for 1)\nintelligence, 2) physical attractiveness, 3) sexual attractiveness, 4) warmth, 5) dominance,\n6) friendliness, 7) masculinity, 8) nurturance, 9) social competence (possessing good social\nskills) and whether they would be a good: 10) parent or 11) mate. They finished by filling\nout a demographic questionnaire indicating age, sex, race, current relationship status,\nsexual relationship experience, and birth control usage.\nResults\nMate poaching outcomes\nand Klett (1972), and Tabachnick and Fidell (1996), we ran two MANOVAs rather than\nseparate ANOVAs for the dependent variables in order to control for inflated Type I error\nthat would occur with conducting numerous separate ANOVAs. Univariate comparisons\nwithin each MANOVA were also Bonferroni adjusted. Correlations between dependent\nvariables were below 0.3, suggesting there was no issue of multicollinearity between\nFriendship as a relationship infiltration tactic\nmeasures. Descriptive statistics and effect sizes for tests relevant to hypotheses 1, 2, and 3\nare reported in Table 1.\nTo test hypothesis 1 and 2, a 2(Friendship) X 2(Sex of Poacher) between subjects\nMANOVA was performed to examine whether participants' mean ratings of the likelihood\nof the eight risky/costly outcomes differed between conditions. This analysis revealed a\nwho were close friends with the poached were rated as more likely to successfully mate\npoach than when the poacher was an acquaintance. Similarly, the resulting relationship\nbetween the poacher and poached was rated as more likely to last beyond a year when they\nwere friends than if they were acquaintances. The poached was also rated as less likely to\ncheat on the poacher in the future if they were friends as opposed to acquaintances.\nThere was also a main effect for poacher sex for which no hypotheses were\nwere rated as more likely to be suspect of poaching than were male poachers (M = 4.36, SD\n1.70) were rated as more likely to suffer physical retaliation from the poached's partner\nParticipants also reported that family members were more likely to approve of the resulting\nrelationship more likely to be approved if the poacher was female (M = 4.75, SD = 1.62)\nMate attributes\nTo test hypothesis 3, participants rated the poacher and poached on several\nimportant mate attributes based on the initial impressions they formed from the vignette. A\nsecond 2(Friendship) X 2(Sex of Poacher) between subjects MANOVA was performed to\nexamine whether participants' mean ratings of these characteristics differed by condition.\nThe poacher was rated as more intelligent, warm, friendly, and nurturant when the poacher\nand poached were portrayed as acquaintances as opposed to friends. There were no\nsignificant differences for ratings of the poached.\nThere was also a main effect for sex of the poacher for which no hypotheses were\na woman (M = 3.19, SD = 1.42), he was rated as more sexually attractive than when the\nd = 0.25. The poached was also rated as more intelligent when the poacher was male (M =\n0.42. Interestingly, male poachers (M = 2.94, SD = 1.33) were rated as less masculine than\nbeing poached were rated as more masculine when the poacher was male (M = 4.84, SD =\nFriendship as a relationship infiltration tactic\nTable 1.

There was neither a significant interaction of\npoacher sex and the friendship manipulation for mate poaching outcomes, F(8, 371) = 0.61,\nPoacher motivations\nTo test hypothesis 5, participants were asked to indicate what type of relationship\nthey thought the poacher wanted to initiate with the poached: a one-night stand, a short-\nterm affair, or a new long-term relationship. A Chi-square Test for Independence indicated\nthat participants' predictions significantly differed across the friendship status of the\nGoodness of Fit analyses were used to address pair-wise comparisons. There was no\nsignificant difference between the number of participants that predicted a one-night stand\nHowever, significantly more individuals predicted that acquaintance poachers were more\nwhereas friend poachers were more interested in a new long-term relationship than were\nin Table 2.\nTable 2. Observed frequencies for predicted motivation of mate poacher across friendship\nconditions\nFriendship Condition Predicted Motivation\nOne-night stand Short-term affair Long-term relationship\nSample comparisons\nTo address potential differences between the MTurk and undergraduate samples,\nthe two MANOVAs and Chi Square Test for Independence were run separately for each\ngroup. Significant findings were similar in these two samples. In the MTurk sample, there\nwas a main effect of the friendship manipulation for costly/risky outcomes, F(8, 271) =\neffect of friendship manipulation for costly/risky outcomes, F(8, 89) = 2.92, p = .006, and\nno interaction of poacher sex and friendship, F(8, 89) = 1.13, p = .350, as well as a main\np = .448. Post-hoc analysis revealed similar group differences for each outcome and mate\nattribute.\nFriendship as a relationship infiltration tactic\nThe Chi Square Tests of Independence indicated participants' predictions of the\npoacher's motivation significantly differed in the same direction across friendship status in\nDiscussion\nThe role of friendship as a relationship infiltration tactic for mate poaching was\ninvestigated by asking participants to read one of four vignettes depicting a heterosexual\nmate poaching scenario in which the mate poacher and the poached were friends or\nacquaintances, as well as whether the poacher was male or female. Participants then rated\nthe likelihood of several outcomes as well as their impressions of the poacher and poached\nacross several evolutionarily relevant mate characteristics.\nHypothesis 1 was supported. Friendship between the poacher and poached\nincreased the perceived likelihood that the mate poacher would be successful. Hypothesis 2\nwas also partially supported. When the poacher and poached were friends, their new long-\nterm relationship was rated as more likely to last longer than a year. Furthermore, within\nthis long-term relationship, the poached was rated as less likely to cheat on the poacher in\nthe future. Together, hypothesis 1 and 2 characterize how friendship may assist a mate\npoacher. One interpretation is that friendship may be a useful tactic for signaling future\ninvestment in a long-term relationship to a potential mate. This is consistent with literature\nshowing that friendship is an important factor in long-term relationship formation and\nVanderdrift et al., 2012). Also, both men and women recognize opposite-sex friendships as\none strategy for initiating romantic relationships (Bleske-Rechek and Buss, 2001).\nOur data also indicated the likelihood of being suspected by the poached's current\nmate and suffering physical retaliation from that mate was the same for the friend and the\nacquaintance poachers. Furthermore, friends and family were perceived as just as likely to\napprove of the new relationship whether the poacher and poached were friends or not, and\nthe poached was just as likely to resent the poacher afterwards. Schmitt and Buss (2001)\nfound that participants rated future infidelity concerns and an uncertain future as more\ncostly for long-term than short-term mate poaching. This pattern seems to indicate that\nfriendship is perceived to be most effective for reducing long-term relational instability\nbetween the poacher and poached and less effective for mitigating risks associated with\nthird-parties such as the poached's current mate and family/friends. It would appear that\nparticipants recognize that friendship between partners can play an important role in\nrelationship maintenance and that friendship may signal traits desired in a long-term mate.\nInterestingly, hypothesis 3 was not supported. In fact, the opposite effect was found.\nAcquaintance-poachers were rated as more warm, friendly, and nurturant than were friend-\npoachers. A possible explanation for this pattern is that as observers, participants may have\ngreater doubts about whether the poacher's friendship is an intentional strategy rather than\ngenuine friendship. From the perspective of the poacher and poached, their friendship may\nappear to serve no functional purpose related to mate poaching. In this way, the benefits of\nfriendship in signaling investment, compatibility, and traits desired in a long-term mate are\nFriendship as a relationship infiltration tactic\nmaintained as genuine, honest signals for those directly involved. However, observers may\nbe more knowledgeable of the mate poacher's intentions. Schmitt and Buss (2001) found\nthat agreeable and conscientious people are less likely to be poachers. Perhaps raters\nassociate poachers with those traits and thus view friend-poachers more negatively because\nfriends should be kind and reliable, not attempting to dissolve a friend's relationship for\ntheir own benefit. Bleske and Shackelford (2001) found that people experience more upset\nin response to imagined mate rivalry from a friend than from a stranger.\nAlternatively, observers may judge others' mate poaching behaviors with a double\nstandard. It would be adaptive for individuals to disprove of another's tactical use of\nfriendship to mate poach while also understanding its effectiveness and endorsing the\nstrategy for one's own use. Humans possess a wide variety of tactics for engaging in self-\npromotion as well as competitor derogation (Schmitt and Buss, 1996; Tooke and Camire,\n1991). Bleske and Shackelford (2001) found that people report being deceived by friends\nabout mating rivalry more often than they themselves report engaging in deceit. Therefore,\nperhaps the disparity between observers' view of friendship as effective and their negative\nevaluation of friend-poachers is a manifestation of strategic deception.\nHypothesis 4 was not supported. There were no sex differences in how effective\nfriendship was for a mate poacher. One possible explanation is that friendship serves to\nsignal romantic compatibility across important mate characteristics that are not necessarily\nsex-specific. In a potential long-term mate, both sexes tend to value traits such as being\nkind, understanding, exciting, intelligent, and creative (Buss and Barnes, 1986; Buss and\nSchmitt, 1993). These complex personality traits may arguably be more difficult and take\nmore time to assess than other signals of mate quality such as physical attractiveness, social\nstanding, or wealth. Friendship may afford men and women information about a potential\nmate that can be used to more accurately assess how compatible they may be as romantic\npartners. In their review, Montoya, Horton, and Kirchner (2008) found that both actual and\nperceived similarity between individuals strongly predicted interpersonal attraction in both\nexisting and potential romantic relationships. Therefore, participants may have believed\nthat poachers and those poached who were close friends had already acquired information\nabout one another and were more likely to be compatible and attracted to one another than\nnot.\nHypothesis 5 was supported. It was predicted that participants would think that\nfriend-poachers were more interested in starting a long-term relationship than either a one-\nnight stand or a short-term affair. It was also predicted that they would think acquaintance-\npoachers would be more interested in a one-night stand or short-term affair than a long-\nterm relationship. Both of these predictions were supported. This evidence is further\nsupport that friendship signals long-term poaching goals.\nConclusions and future directions\nSeveral characteristics of this study demand that the results be interpreted with care.\nPrevious research from which hypotheses were generated used largely college-aged\nsamples (Schmitt and Buss, 2001; Schmitt 2004). The current study sampled participants\nfrom both an exclusively college-aged population as well as from a more diverse MTurk\npopulation (Buhrmester et al., 2011). Nevertheless, we found that both samples separately\nFriendship as a relationship infiltration tactic\nfollowed the same pattern of findings. Also, a majority of the population reported not\ncurrently using hormone-based birth control, which has been shown to affect long-term and\nshort-term mate preference, perceptions of masculinity, and attraction (Cornwell et al.,\nVoak, Little, Jones, Burt, and Perrett, 2003; Smith, Jones, Little, DeBruine, and Welling,\n2009). Most importantly, these results measure perceptions of those observing fictional\nscenarios and may not generalize beyond the perceptions of an unrelated or uninvolved\nobserver. Perceptions of observers are important for measuring costly behavior largely\nbecause mate poaching entails risks closely associated with social stigma and the reactions\nof others. However, it is also important in that observers may see themselves in the mate\npoaching scenarios, referencing their own romantic relationships (Andersen and Cole,\n1990), experiences with mate poaching (Schmitt and Buss, 2001), and personal beliefs\nmay have been shaped in part by evolved mechanisms for engaging in and combating mate\nand Buss, 1997). Nevertheless, it would be important for future studies to use other, more\ndirect measures to verify whether friendship is effective beyond altering observer\nperceptions of success and risk. It would also be informative to gather descriptive\ninformation from participants about whether and how often they have personally used\nfriendship as a poaching tactic and its effectiveness.\nThere are several design changes that could be useful for future investigations.\nRather than participants rating \"how likely\" each cost would be to occur, it may be helpful\nto have participants indicate \"how costly\" each outcome would be. An investigation of\nlikelihood is conceptually similar to a forced-choice paradigm where participants are lead\nto believe something can either occur or not occur (e.g., how likely is physical retaliation to\noccur (or not occur)?). If participants were to indicate \"how costly\" an outcome would be,\nthey would instead indicate the severity of the cost on a continuous scale (e.g., how\nsevere/costly would the physical retaliation be?).\nAlso, no previous study has looked at what observers predicted were the poacher's\nmotivations. Participants viewed friend-poachers as more likely to be motivated by long-\nterm goals and acquaintance-poachers motivated by short-term goals. It would be important\nfor future studies to test whether having these predictions or being primed to have these\npredictions alters observers' perceptions of mate poaching. Furthermore, if observers have\na personal connection to the mate poacher, poached, or poachee (such as through a friend,\nfamily member, or other associate), it may influence the observers' evaluations. Similarly,\nwe presented the relationships within our scenario as unstable, a condition that may\nincrease the perceived effectiveness of friendship as a tactic (Schmitt and Buss, 2001).\nFuture studies should examine how experimental manipulation of the relationship context\naffects perceptions of tactical effectiveness not only for friendship but other strategies.\nAside from participants' ratings of the poached individual's mate characteristics,\nthis study focused almost exclusively on the benefits of friendship for the poacher.\nHowever, the poached individual has as much to benefit and lose from being poached\n(Schmitt and Shackelford, 2003). Friendship with the poacher may also function to mitigate\nrisks face by the poached individual. Though some of the risks investigated in this study are\nFriendship as a relationship infiltration tactic\nthe same for poachers and those poached (Schmitt and Buss, 2001), some questions were\nnot framed to evaluate poached risks. For example, participants were asked \"the likelihood\nthat the poached individual would cheat on the poacher,\" but were not asked the likelihood\nof whether the poacher would cheat on the poached individual. Furthermore, the current\nstudy did not look at risks that may be unique to those poached, such as loss of resources,\ndissolution of the current relationship, and retaliation from the poachee against the poached\nindividual or restrictive/violent mate guarding behavior. It would also be interesting to see\nwhat participants thought was the motivation of the poached individual during a mate\npoaching encounter and whether the poached individual was more interested in a long-term\nor short-term relationship.\nThis study contributes experimental evidence to a body of work that has largely\nbeen descriptive or quasi-experimental. It also introduces a methodology by which mate\npoaching may be experimentally studied indirectly through the perceptions of others.\nOverall, these data support the claim that, by increasing the likelihood of success and\ndecreasing several costs unique to poaching, friendship is seen as an effective tactic for\ninfiltrating an existing relationship. These findings support hypotheses formulated from\nprevious data on mate poaching and provide several novel findings from which new,\ntestable predictions can be generated.\nReferences\nAnderson, S.
