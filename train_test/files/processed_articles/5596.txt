    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe use data from a 12-month ethnographic study of two medical-surgical units\nin a U.S. hospital to examine how members from different occupations can col-\nlaborate with one another in their daily work despite differences in status,\nshared meanings, and expertise across occupational groups, which previous\nwork has shown to create difficulties. In our study, nurses and patient care\ntechnicians (PCTs) on both hospital units faced these same occupational differ-\nences, served the same patient population, worked under the same manage-\nment and organizational structure, and had the same pressures, goals, and\norganizational collaboration tools available to them. But nurses and PCTs on\none unit successfully collaborated while those on the other did not. We demon-\nstrate that a social structure characterized by cross-cutting demographics\nbetween occupational groups--in which occupational membership is uncorre-\nlated with demographic group membership--can loosen attachment to the\noccupational identity and status order. This allows members of cross-\noccupational dyads, in our case nurses and PCTs, to draw on other shared\nsocial identities, such as shared race, age, or immigration status, in their inter-\nactions. Drawing on a shared social identity at the dyad level provided mem-\nbers with a ``dyadic toolkit'' of alternative, non-occupational expertise, shared\nmeanings, status rules, and emotional scripts that facilitated collaboration\nacross occupational differences and improved patient care.\n",

Kellogg1\n Keywords: cultural toolkit, coordination, cross-occupational collaboration, pro-\nfessions, intergroup relations, group diversity, demography, status, hospitals,\nhealthcare, sociology of work and occupations, medical sociology\n1 MIT Sloan School of Management\nScholars of work and occupations have demonstrated that because different\noccupations have different status, shared meanings, and expertise, it is difficult\nfor people to collaborate with one another across occupational boundaries\nBechky, 2008). Difficulties from status differences can occur because an occupa-\ntional group's prestige, authority, and autonomy result from occupation members\nhiving off lower-status dirty work to subordinate occupation members and pro-\ntecting occupational boundaries rather than collaborating with members of differ-\n2013). Difficulties over meanings can occur because occupation-specific identities\nand beliefs often make it hard for members of different occupations to under-\nstand and appreciate each other's actions (Perlow and Weeks, 2002; Bechky,\nbecause incompatible codes, routines, or protocols often make it challenging for\nmembers of an occupation to share knowledge with non-members (Barley, 1986;\nBut scholars have also found that, despite these difficulties, when organiza-\ntions provide certain tools to foster collaboration, cross-occupational collabora-\ntion can be successful (see Okhuysen and Bechky, 2009, for a review). Rules\nand routines can improve collaboration by bringing interdependent groups and\nindividuals together and specifying responsibility for tasks (e.g., Feldman, 2000;\nby multiple occupational groups to coordinate their work--can support the\ntranslation of meanings and the negotiation of status across occupational\nLevina and Vaast, 2005). Also, common spaces can help promote communica-\ntion and camaraderie among team members (e.g., Bechky, 2003b; Kellogg,\nOrlikowski, and Yates, 2006). What they have not explained well, however, is\nwhy such tools are not always effective in fostering cross-occupational colla-\nboration. In this paper, we demonstrate that the answer may lie in demo-\ngraphic differences, which are important determinants of intergroup relations.\nDespite the long history of work on the impact of demography in single\noccupations in the sociology of work and occupations literature (e.g., Blair-Loy,\nies have investigated the impact of demography on collaboration between\nmembers of different occupational groups. Cross-occupational collaboration\nscholars typically do not report or theorize about demographic information,\neven though demography may have shaped the collaboration (or lack of it) that\nthey observed. For example, we are never told the demographic characteristics\nof occupational groups in the cross-occupational collaboration between Barley's\nteam members. And though Kellogg, Orlikowski, and Yates (2006) and Bechky\n(2003a) referred to the demographic differences among members of the differ-\nent occupations they studied, they did not investigate the implications of these\ndemographic differences for cross-occupational collaboration.\nScholars of demography and intergroup relations have found that it is not\nalways the overall diversity of a social system that explains how different groups\ninteract with one another but, rather, the extent to which the social structure is\ncharacterized by ``cross-cutting'' demographics (e.g., Blau and Schwartz, 1984;\nLau and Murnighan, 1998). In social structures with cross-cutting demographics,\npositional characteristics, such as occupation, and nominal characteristics, such\nas race, are uncorrelated so that people who share a high-status characteristic\non one dimension do not also always share high-status characteristics on other\ndimensions (e.g., race, age, and immigration status).\nCross-cutting demographics promote three kinds of intergroup dynamics.\nFirst, members with traditionally devalued social identities are relatively equally\ndistributed among members in higher-status and lower-status positions. This\nleads members to view traditionally devalued identities more positively and to\nthat in sex-integrated firms, the proportional representation of low-status group\nmembers (women) in senior positions can signal to low-status group members\nat lower levels that positions of power are attainable by members of their\ngroup. This greater integration at senior levels creates conditions for more posi-\ntive identification experiences and more constructive relationships between\njunior and senior members of traditionally devalued groups.\ngraphics put ``individuals at the intersection of a web of group affiliations that exert\ndiverse and often counteracting pressures, weakening the hold any one group has\non its members, widening the options of individuals, and increasing their free-\ndom.'' Scholars have shown that individuals who identify with a social group adopt\nits norms and values and act according to the group's prescriptions (Turner, 1987;\nHogg and Terry, 2000). In settings with cross-cutting demographics, members are\ninfluenced not only by ties to one group (e.g., occupation), but also by ties to other\ngroups with whom they identify (e.g., Haitians). This reduces the control that any\nsingle group has on members' thoughts, actions, and loyalties.\nThird, cross-cutting demographics facilitate intergroup liking and trust via the\ndirect and indirect effects of homophilous cross-group interactions. Because\ngroup members tend to associate informally with colleagues who share salient\ndemographic characteristics (e.g., McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Cook, 2001),\nwhen many members from one group have some demographic similarity with\nmembers of the other group, there is a higher degree of intergroup contact\nthat, under particular conditions such as sharing a superordinate goal and the\nsupport of authorities (e.g., Allport, 1954), can lead to liking and comfort. The\ndirect effect of this is liking and attraction between members of the two groups\nwho share demographic characteristics (e.g., Byrne, 1971; Tsui and O'Reilly,\nliking, even between members of the two groups who do not share at least\none demographic characteristic, because of members' enhanced knowledge\nabout the other group, reduced anxiety about intergroup contact, and increased\nempathy and ability to take the perspective of the other group (e.g., Pettigrew\nWe find that by promoting these three dynamics, cross-cutting demo-\ngraphics can loosen attachment to identity and status distinctions, readying the\nway for actors from different groups to interact with one another. Drawing on a\nwide array of social identities (e.g., immigrant, young person), rather than on\none dominant identity such as occupation, can provide cross-occupational\ndyads with an expanded ``cultural toolkit'' (Swidler, 1986) of shared resources\nto guide their interactions. While cultural theorists demonstrate that people\ndraw on the cultural tools afforded by their social identities to shape their\nactions (Swidler, 1986), symbolic interactionists remind us that our actions also\ndepend on the specific interaction partners with whom we deal. People take\nthe point of view of the other person involved in the interaction and modify what\nthey are doing to fit in more or less easily with what their interaction partner is\nof different occupations have access not only to the cultural toolkits provided by\ntheir occupational identities and the organizational toolkits provided by top man-\nagers, but also to what we call ``dyadic toolkits'' provided by the non-\noccupational social identities they share at the dyad level (e.g., shared race, age,\nimmigration status, motherhood, etc.). By drawing on these shared social identi-\nties, cross-occupational dyads gain access to an alternative, non-occupational\ntoolkit of expertise, shared meanings, status rules, and emotional scripts they\ncan use to work successfully with one another across occupational differences.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a 12-month ethnographic study of collaboration between nurses\nand patient-care technicians (PCTs) on two different units at Huron Hospital (all\nnames are pseudonyms). Nurses and PCTs on both units faced similar chal-\nlenges in collaboration due to differences in occupational status, meanings, and\nexpertise and had similar organizational tools available to them.\nThe first author interviewed and observed nurses and PCTs for two- to\nthree-and-a-half-hour sessions. This author dressed in scrubs and accompanied\nnurses and PCTs while they went about their work and also conducted ``real-\ntime'' interviews (Barley and Kunda, 2001) during moments of privacy in supply\nrooms, medication rooms, the kitchenette, and break room. During the first\nmonth of observation, we noticed interesting dynamics occurring on the night\nshift, which led us to focus observations on this shift; cross-occupational colla-\nboration is particularly valuable on the night shift because patients have no visi-\ntors to monitor them. The first author conducted 42 observations of nurses and\nPCTs working on two medical-surgical units (Units A and B) during the night\nshift. The observations were conducted across all days of the week and all\ntimes of the night. In addition, the first author conducted 42 background inter-\nviews with nurses and PCTs. These interviews averaged between 30 and 45\nminutes and were conducted at various times during the observational session,\ntypically when the nurse or PCT had a period of downtime.\nThe units were well matched on factors shown to affect cross-occupational\ncollaboration (see Okhuysen and Bechky, 2009, for a review). Because they\nwere part of the same hospital, they shared the same management and organi-\nzational structure, were subject to the same pressures and goals, and had the\nsame procedures, protocols, and collaboration tools, as shown in table 1. The\nunits also served the same patient populations--medical-surgical patients--and\nboth units ran at full capacity. Unit A had fewer patient beds than Unit B (24 vs.\n36 beds), but the units were staffed according to hospital-wide staffing guide-\nlines so that patient-to-staff ratios were the same on each unit.\nWe used interviews to triangulate our observations with occupation mem-\nbers' own interpretations of the cross-occupational interactions in which they\nhad recently participated to reduce possible researcher bias in interpreting\nnurse\u00adPCT interactions. Interviews that did not focus on members' own inter-\npretations of recent nurse\u00adPCT interactions centered on four main themes:\nbackground and career histories and goals, including what collaboration had\nbeen like when the member first joined the unit; the beliefs of each occupa-\ntional group about what constitutes good patient care; how members decided\nwho performed each task, particularly when one member of the nurse\u00adPCT\ndyad was busy; and how their unit compared with other units they had\n``floated'' on (worked on temporarily when another unit was short-staffed). The\nfirst author took extensive notes during observations and interviews, which\nwere typed up within 24 hours.\nNurse and PCT pairings were made in the same way on both units each eve-\nning by the resource nurse--a shared, rotating position held by a different nurse\neach night on each unit. The assignment of nurses and PCTs was to patients,\nhowever, and not to specific nurse\u00adPCT dyads, as every effort was made to\nensure that nurses and PCTs were assigned to patients to whom they had been\nassigned on previous nights to facilitate continuity of care. Because patients\nstayed on the unit an average of 36 hours, in this assignment system, all nurses\nworked with all PCTs regularly; there were no consistent nurse\u00adPCT dyads.\nThe first author observed 137 unique nurse\u00adPCT dyads working together: 56\non Unit A and 81 on Unit B. We used a sampling spreadsheet to select for\nobservation of an equal number of nurses and PCTs on each unit for an equal\nnumber of days of the week, weekdays vs. weekends, and times of the night,\n11 P.M.\u00ad2 A.M., 2 A.M.\u00ad5 A.M., and 4 A.M.\u00ad7 A.M. We did not know ahead of time\nwhich nurses and PCTs would be working, except for the nurses and PCTs\nwho had steady schedules. When the first author arrived, the resource nurse\nselected the nurse or PCT to be observed, typically by asking the closest nurse\nor PCT if she was willing to be ``shadowed.'' Nurses and PCTs at Huron were\nused to being followed around by trainees, and they were usually quite willing\nto be shadowed. There were only a handful of times when the first author did\nnot shadow the randomly selected nurse or PCT, and this occurred when the\nnurse or PCT selected had already been observed recently. This sampling led\nby which we mean that we shadowed one or both parties of the dyad one on\none while they were working together and collected enough data to reach\nsaturation on the dyad's typical social and work interactions. All staff on both\nunits were female except for three male nurses on Unit A, and one on Unit B.\nTable 1.

In the first two months, we\nfocused on understanding the PCT and nursing occupations and the nature of\nthe cross-occupational collaboration of nurses and PCTs at Huron. Collaboration\nbetween nurses and PCTs is imperative for delivering high-quality patient care\nbecause many tasks require more than one person to complete. For example,\nbedridden patients need to be repositioned at least every two to four hours, a\ntask that requires more than one person. In addition, the high workload on\nmedical-surgical units and the unpredictability of patients' demands make it dif-\nficult for any one nurse or PCT to provide good care to all assigned patients\nindependently. Because nurses or PCTs can easily get stuck in patients' rooms\nresponding to unanticipated problems, they need to cover one another's\nassigned patients when this happens. In addition, PCTs have higher patient\nloads than nurses (1 PCT to 12 patients vs. 1 nurse to 6 patients), and when\nPCTs are busy, nurses are expected to pitch in and help with PCTs' tasks.\nNext, we took a month to code our data for preliminary themes and pat-\nterns. We analyzed all instances of nurse\u00adPCT collaboration. We saw clear dif-\nferences in the collaboration practices on the two units studied, with\nsuccessful cross-occupational collaboration occurring among many nurse\u00adPCT\ndyads on Unit A and not on Unit B. We re-read in detail the literature on cross-\noccupational collaboration, which highlighted that the failed collaboration on\nUnit B was expected because of occupational differences in expertise, shared\nmeanings, and status, while the successful collaboration on Unit A was\nunusual.\nWe used the second phase of data collection (five months) to understand\nhow and when successful versus unsuccessful cross-occupational collaboration\noccurred on the two units. In the final phase of data collection (four months),\nwe more closely followed the work and social interactions of nurse\u00adPCT dyads\non Unit A to understand why most dyads collaborated well. In this phase, we\nalso used in-situ interview questions to test our emerging understanding of\nhow successful cross-occupational collaboration was occurring.\nWhen we determined that high levels of collaboration were occurring on\nUnit A but not Unit B, we contrasted the two cases to identify practices associ-\nated with successful cross-occupational collaboration. Our inductive analysis\n(Glaser and Strauss, 1967) consisted of multiple readings of field notes and\ninterview notes, writing analytical memos, and tracking patterned activities and\nissues related to collaboration in ATLAS/ti, a qualitative data analysis program.\nTo understand why many dyads on Unit A successfully collaborated while\nthose on Unit B did not, we analyzed each nurse\u00adPCT dyad's social and work\ninteractions. Online Appendix A (http://asq.sagepub.com/supplemental) pro-\nvides descriptions of the characteristics of the dyads we studied on both units,\ntheir occupational and social identities, and whether they made use of shared\nsocial identities in their work interactions.\nOur analysis showed that Unit A was characterized by cross-cutting demo-\ngraphics at the unit level that loosened attachment to occupational identity and\nstatus distinctions and created space for nurse\u00adPCT dyads to connect around a\nshared social identity. Even though most dyads on Unit A differed on at least\none visible demographic characteristic, most identified at least one shared iden-\ntity that provided them with a non-occupational toolkit at the dyad level that\nthey used to overcome occupational differences and collaborate to provide\npatient care. In contrast, on Unit B, collaboration failed. What makes the differ-\nence in collaboration on the two units interesting is that they were so similar in\nterms of barriers previously shown to make cross-occupational collaboration\ndifficult. On both units, nurses and PCTs needed to overcome occupational dif-\nferences in status, emotional scripts, shared meanings, and expertise in order\nto successfully collaborate with one another, as shown in table 2.\nCross-occupational Differences in Status\nWe observed that because occupational members maintain their status, in part,\nthrough the tasks they do in everyday work and through the communication\nrules they use with one another (see Sauder, 2005, for a review), asking nurses\nto help with ``PCT work'' was problematic on both units. Nurses primarily per-\nformed higher-status cerebral work associated with patient management, while\nPCTs spent most of their shifts engaged in low-status, physically taxing work\nthat put them in close contact with patients with contagious infections and dis-\neases. But delivering responsive care sometimes required nurses to perform\n``PCT tasks,'' such as helping patients with toileting needs, changing linens,\nand bathing, feeding, and repositioning patients, which violated the nurses' jur-\nisdiction. This was problematic because nurses had hived off hands-on care\nwork to PCTs years earlier in response to pressures for cost-cutting (Weiss and\nmore abstract issues associated with patient management, such as conducting\ndocumentation activities and coordinating care activities among various hospital\nTable 2. Occupational Differences between Nurses and PCTs at Huron Hospital\nNurses PCTs\nDifferent occupational status\nOccupational tasks Administrative and clinical work Dirty work (e.g., changing bedpans)\nOccupational communication rules Order giving and speaking up Order taking and not speaking up\nDifferent occupational emotion\nrules\nOccupational feeling rules for\nexpressing negative emotions\nwith other staff members\nExpressing negative emotions with nurses\nand PCTs\nSuppressing negative emotions\nwith nurses\nOccupational feeling rules for\nexpressing positive emotions with\nother staff members\nExpressing positive emotions only with\nother nurses\nExpressing positive emotions only\nwith other PCTs\nDifferent occupational meanings\nOccupational beliefs and values Best nurse: ``OCD'' [obsessive\ncompulsive], conscientious, and accurate\nBest PCT: ``Angel,'' treats patients\nlike family\nOccupational demeanor Assertive and efficient with patients Empathetic and attentive with\npatients\nDifferent occupational expertise\nOccupational knowledge bases Abstract knowledge Patient-specific knowledge\nOccupational skills and information Computer skills and information Sensory skills and information\nworkers. In part because of this more abstract work, the nursing occupation is\nconsidered more prestigious than the PCT occupation; in the U.S., for example,\nnurses had four-year college degrees, the majority of PCTs had only a high\nschool education and a six-week PCT training course. Some nurses in our study\nfelt that doing PCT work was not a good use of their time given their more\nadvanced skill sets and education.\nNurses and PCTs also had different occupational rules for communication\nthat reflected and maintained status differences between groups. We observed\nnurses give direct commands to PCTs, speak more frequently when interacting\nwith PCTs, and often sit down during ``report''--a time each night when nurses\nupdated PCTs on their shared patients. The PCTs we observed frequently took\norders or gave orders only indirectly, for example, ``51 is requesting his nurse''\ninstead of ``go to 51.'' PCTs usually spoke less than nurses, stood up during\nreport, and were more attentive to nurses than nurses were to them.\nCross-occupational Differences in Emotion Rules\nNurses and PCTs on both units also faced challenges due to differences in\noccupational feeling rules for expressing emotions with other staff. When\nnurses were upset with PCTs, we saw nurses confront PCTs directly and often\npublicly. We also observed nurses openly express negative emotions, including\nstress (``Tonight is crazy. It's a full house!'') and frustration (``We're short on\nstaff `cause someone on [another unit] was sick so they took one of ours''), to\nboth fellow nurses and PCTs. In contrast, when PCTs were upset with a nurse,\nwe often observed them suppress these negative emotions and not confront\nthe nurse. In addition, PCTs typically responded to nurses' expressions of anxi-\nety by appearing calm, for example, when told they would have an increased\npatient load due to short-staffing. We typically saw PCTs express negative\nemotions privately only to other PCTs. These differences in occupational feeling\nrules for expressing negative emotions between staff members often made it\ndifficult for nurses and PCTs to relate to one another effectively, particularly\nwhen dealing with conflict or when mistakes were made.\nNurses and PCTs also differed in how they expressed positive emotions.\nWe frequently observed nurses publicly express positive emotions, such as\ngratitude and pride, and share patient triumphs with other nurses but not with\nPCTs. For example, we often saw nurses go out of their way to find and per-\nsonally thank other nurses who had done something to help them out without\nbeing asked during the shift, such as changing another nurse's patient's IV bag.\nBut nurses did not typically demonstrate the same level of gratitude toward\nPCTs when PCTs helped out unasked. PCTs were less publicly expressive than\nnurses about positive emotions, and when they did express those emotions,\nsuch as feeling proud because of compliments patients had given them, they\ntypically oriented them toward other PCTs rather than toward nurses. Perhaps\nbecause positive emotions such as gratitude and pride were most often\ndirected toward members of one's own occupational group, nurses and PCTs\nhad no available occupational scripts for showing appreciation to or sharing\ntheir triumphs with one another.\nCross-occupational Differences in Meanings\nCross-occupational collaboration was also difficult because nurses and PCTs\ndrew on occupation-specific beliefs, values, and demeanors that often led them\nto judge the actions of members of the other group as unnecessary or even\ninappropriate. Nurses and PCTs on both units had different occupational beliefs\nand values. Nurses reported that the best nurses were the ones who easily\nengaged in the critical thinking needed to analyze lab results and who demon-\nstrated accuracy and precision when documenting, filling, and administering\nmedications. Common sayings by nurses on both units included ``Always dou-\nble check your books''; ``Cross your T's and dot your I's''; and ``Being OCD\n[obsessive compulsive] is a good thing.'' In contrast, PCTs valued providing\nresponsive, hands-on care to patients by physically helping them, and they con-\nsidered the best PCTs to be those who won the affection of patients and\ntreated patients with dignity and respect, especially when patients were in\nembarrassing situations: ``You have to do your work with heart, with love'';\n``Give the kind of care you'd want your mother to receive''; ``It's a heartfelt\nthing''; and ``You know when it's genuine and they know too--the patients can\ntell.'' Differences in occupational values and beliefs often led nurses and PCTs\nat Huron each to perceive the other to be providing inappropriate care; nurses\noften referred to PCTs as ``overly familiar'' with patients, while PCTs often\nreferred to nurses as ``cold.''\nNurses and PCTs on both units also displayed different occupational demea-\nnors in their interactions with patients. Nurses often acted assertively with\npatients and used humor to speed up or avoid potentially emotionally laden\ninteractions for which nurses felt they did not have time given their many time-\nsensitive responsibilities (e.g., all patients had to have their medications admi-\nnistered within the same two-hour window). PCTs, in contrast, were reserved\nand quiet when interacting with nurses or in the presence of a physician, and\nthey often gave patients physical support and affection by holding their hand,\nstroking their hair, or touching them gently on the hand or arm when talking to\nthem. These differences in occupational demeanor sometimes made it difficult\nfor nurses and PCTs to understand and appreciate each other's actions. Nurses\non both units sometimes described PCTs as getting ``walked all over'' by\npatients and were often impatient when PCTs were unavailable to help\nbecause they were spending ``excessive'' time in patients' rooms; PCTs on\nboth units often described nurses as being ``too short'' with patients.\nCross-occupational Differences in Expertise\nFinally, nurses and PCTs at Huron faced challenges due to differences in occu-\npational expertise. Nurses and PCTs on both units drew on occupation-specific\nbodies of knowledge, sources of information, and patient-care skills, and this\noften made it difficult for them to share their expertise with one another. We\noften saw nurses draw on the deep clinical knowledge of anatomy, medica-\ntions, and medical tests and procedures they had gained from their formal edu-\ncation. In contrast, the PCTs we observed usually diagnosed patients'\nproblems using informal, concrete rules-of-thumb grounded in everyday prac-\ntice, such as comparing a patient's current state to the same patient's state on\nprior shifts on which these PCTs had worked. Because nurses privileged\nabstract, formal knowledge of diseases, medications, and lab results in guiding\ntheir decision making, they often considered PCTs' knowledge to be irrelevant.\nPCTs often noted that nurses did not take seriously their concrete knowledge\nof subtle changes in patients' states and patients' idiosyncratic needs.\nRegarding occupational skills and information, we saw nurses use computer\nskills and computerized information to track patients' detailed medical histories,\ntest results, current medications, and overall care plans. In contrast, we saw\nPCTs rely primarily on sensory skills and information gained from directly inter-\nacting with patients in the patients' rooms. Nurses and PCTs often appeared to\nbe unaware of the unique skills and information possessed by the other occu-\npational group. The routine of ``report'' was in place so that nurses would\nupdate PCTs at the beginning of the shift to ensure that they had the basic care\ninformation they needed to begin taking vital signs. But nurses frequently\nignored this routine, and PCTs often told us that waiting for nurses to give\nthem report at the beginning of the shift slowed them down.\nHospital Tools to Facilitate Cross-occupational Collaboration\nThe hospital provided several tools to facilitate collaboration between nurses\nand PCTs despite occupational differences. First, rules and routines were in\nplace on both units that governed the order and timing at which certain patient\ncare tasks needed to occur. Report was one of those routines. In addition, vital\nsigns were expected to be taken on both units between 11 P.M. and 1 A.M.,\nmedications were expected to be given at midnight, vital signs of those on\nheart monitors were expected to be done at 4 A.M., and documentation of\npatient input and output was expected to be conducted by 6 A.M. These rou-\ntines were designed so nurses and PCTs could understand when the other\ngroup's workload was heavy so they could offer assistance during these times\nin order to meet ongoing deadlines.\nSecond, boundary objects existed to facilitate collaboration between nurses\nand PCTs. Patient charts, templates assigning patients to nurses and PCTs,\nelectronic patient records, call-light phone technology, pagers and the paging\nsystem, and whiteboards in patients' rooms were available on both units. Such\nboundary objects were designed so nurses and PCTs could be aware of when\nthe other required help. The hospital also did not require nurses and PCTs to\ndress differently, which minimized status differences.\nFinally, common spaces existed for collaboration. On both units, there was a\nreception desk containing the call-light phone monitor and one computer termi-\nnal followed by rows of computer terminals with enough seating for all nurses\nand PCTs. Both units also contained similar enclosed spaces for use by both\nnurses and PCTs, including a locker room and break room, small kitchenette,\ntwo medication rooms, and a main supply room. These common spaces\nallowed for informal information sharing between nurses and PCTs.\nCross-occupational Collaboration Outcomes\nDespite similar barriers to and tools for cross-occupational collaboration on\nunits A and B, collaboration largely succeeded on Unit A and failed on Unit B.\nThese differences in cross-occupational collaboration had a real impact on\npatient care. A vignette is helpful in describing what successful versus failed\ncollaboration looked like in practice. One night on Unit A, Mr. Smith, a patient,\nlost control of his bladder and saturated his sheets with urine. Because Huron\nrequired visitors to leave each day at 8 P.M., no family member or friend was\nthere to help him. When Jessica, the assigned nurse, came into his room a few\nminutes later to assess his wounds, she began right away to clean Mr. Smith.\nWhen Jessica realized that she could not do it on her own, she asked Anna, the\nPCT, for help. Anna said yes and came in as soon as she was done assisting\nanother patient. Mr. Smith was cleaned within 10 minutes by Jessica and Anna.\nContrast this with a similar situation on Unit B with a different patient,\nMr. Johnson. He similarly lost control of his bladder. Jill, the nurse assigned to\nMr. Johnson, came into his room a few minutes later to deliver medications.\nShe cursed under her breath and said defiantly, ``I am not cleaning this up.\nSomeone will get to it later.'' Cara, the PCT assigned to Mr. Johnson, came in\nsoon after and realized that helping Mr. Johnson was a two-person job. She\nasked Jill for help. Jill said yes but then ignored her. An hour later, another nurse\ntold Jill that the patient was calling again and requesting to be changed. Cara\nwas busy just then, and Jill refused to start without Cara. Mr. Johnson ended\nup lying in his own urine for an hour and a half before he was finally cleaned by\nJill and Cara.\nIncidents such as these occurred regularly on the respective units. On Unit\nA, there were more instances in which nurses helped with PCT tasks when\nPCTs were busy, fewer ignored patient calls, fewer ignored heart monitor\nalarms, and fewer patient complaints than on Unit B, as shown in table 3. The\noutcomes in table 3 were selected because they directly or indirectly resulted\nfrom the quality of nurse\u00adPCT collaboration.

Promptly attending to telemetry (heart monitor) alarms is defined\nas a nurse or PCT responding to the alarm within the first few minutes. On\nUnit B, there were many sessions in which telemetry alarms sounded for\nnearly the entire observational session.\nCross-cutting Demographics in a Unit's Social Structure\nOur analysis suggests that the high degree of cross-cutting demographics within\nthe social structure of Unit A, but not Unit B, shaped the difference in cross-\noccupational collaboration outcomes. On the Unit A night shift, nurses and PCTs\ndiffered along occupational lines but were mixed in terms of the immediately\nvisible identities of race, age, and immigration status, which was visible because\nof accented speech. On Unit B, as well as on most other hospital units at Huron\nand other shift times on Unit A, the demographic composition of the nursing and\nPCT groups was consolidated in terms of race, age, and immigration status,\nmeaning that occupational differences between nurses and PCTs coincided with\nother demographic differences. As table 4 illustrates, most nurses on Unit B\nwere white, mid-20-year-olds who grew up in the U.S., while most PCTs on Unit\nB were minorities, older (in their 40s to 50s), and non-U.S.-born.\nIt was not simply occupational group membership aligning (or not) with\ndemographic characteristics that shaped differences in the intergroup dynamics\non the two units; it was also, more importantly, the extent to which demo-\ngraphic characteristics were associated with status differences that loosened\nattachment to the occupational identity and status order on Unit A and rein-\nforced it on Unit B. On Unit A, the higher-status nursing group had many mem-\nbers with traditionally devalued social identities in this context--non-white,\nolder, and non-U.S.-born--while the lower-status PCT group had many mem-\nbers with traditionally valued social identities in this context--white, younger,\nand U.S.-born.1 The mismatch in status between occupational identities and\nTable 4. Demographic Composition of Units A and B Night Shift Staff\nUnit A Unit B\nOverall Nurses PCTs Overall Nurses PCTs\n1 In this context, members considered being younger (20s and 30s) more valuable than being older\n(over 40), particularly on medical-surgical units like Units A and B where computer literacy and\nspeed, quick reaction time, and physical fitness and stamina--all traits associated with the young--\nwere prized among nurses and PCTs.\nother readily apparent social identities loosened attachment to the occupational\nidentity and status order on Unit A.2 On Unit B, in contrast, most members\nwho had higher-status occupational characteristics also had higher-status\ndemographic characteristics--nurses were nearly all in their 20s and 30s,\nwhite, and U.S.-born, while PCTs were nearly all older, non-white, and non-\nU.S.-born--which reinforced the occupational identity and status order.\nThe cross-cutting demographics of Unit A promoted three kinds of inter-\ngroup dynamics between nurses and PCTs that created space for nurse\u00adPCT\ndyads to draw on a shared, non-occupational social identity to guide their inter-\nactions with one another: (1) the valuing of traditionally devalued identities and\nthe building of relationships around them because of the presence of members\nin higher-status positions with traditionally devalued identities (e.g., black\nnurses), (2) low occupational in-group pressure resulting from a high degree of\nintersecting group affiliations that exerted diverse and often counteracting iden-\ntity pressures on nurses and PCTs, and (3) feelings of comfort and liking even\nbetween nurses and PCTs who did not share demographic characteristics\nresulting from a high degree of homophilous cross-occupational contact.\nthat when traditionally devalued social identities are relatively equally distribu-\nted among the higher- and lower-status groups, they are often viewed posi-\ntively. On Unit A, where the higher-status nursing group had many members\nwith traditionally devalued social identities, members fondly referred to their\nshift as the ``United Nations,'' and nearly all noted that they viewed the diver-\nsity in age, race, and immigration status in a positive light. For example, a\nyoung, white, U.S.-born Unit A nurse related:\nI like the diversity. We have older nurses and people from different nationalities and I\nlike it better. When I float to other floors, it's all white women in their 20s and 30s.\nIt's weird. We get patients here from all different countries so it helps that so many\nof our nurses and PCTs can speak another language.\nOn Unit A, the positive view of traditionally devalued social identities allowed\nnurses and PCTs to draw on these and other shared identities without fear of\nstatus loss. For example, a nurse on Unit A explained how she tried to over-\ncome her traditionally devalued social identities when floating on other units\nbut did not need to do so on Unit A:\nWhen I float, I will sometimes name drop that I went to [a good college near the hos-\npital that many nurses attended] so they [the nurses] don't think I'm off the boat [a\nrecent immigrant] `cause I'm black and have an accent. Here, I don't need to do stuff\nlike that, since like half of us [nurses] are black and have an accent.\n2 The loosening attachment to the occupational identity and status order on Unit A did not lead to\ncontestation over the general prestige and status ranking of the nursing versus PCT occupation on\nthe unit. Members do not contest and protect the status order unless they believe that lower-status\nmembers have the opportunity to move into the higher-status group (e.g., Bendersky and Hays,\n2012; George, Chattopadhyay, and Zhang, 2012). Here, PCTs had no opportunity to move into the\nnursing ranks without leaving Huron and going back to school for four years to train as nurses.\nIn contrast, on Unit B, the immediately visible association between occupa-\ntional position and race, age, and immigration status activated the use of com-\nmon negative stereotypes about traditionally devalued social identities. We\noften heard Unit B nurses use common stereotypes about non-whites, older\npeople, and members of certain immigrant groups to describe PCTs (e.g.,\n``slow,''``lazy,''``incompetent,'' and ``can't be trusted''), even though we\nobserved the PCTs on Unit B to be just as industrious as those on Unit A. For\nexample, a young, white, U.S.-born nurse on Unit B related, ``You can't count\non them [PCTs]. Most are lazy and try to do the bare minimum so you really\ncan't trust them . . . they'll take forever to do something that you ask.'' And, in\ncontrast to the nurses on Unit A who valued staff who could speak another lan-\nguage, the Unit B nurses had little patience for PCTs' accented speech. One\nnoted, ``Language is an issue here since some [PCTs] aren't fully versed in\nEnglish and don't feel comfortable. That always disturbs me because I think if\nyou get to a certain position and you can't speak English . . . I just don't get it.''\nDespite such seemingly racist comments, our data suggest there was no dif-\nference in racial attitudes among nurses prior to joining their respective units.\nWe address this issue in Online Appendix B.\nOccupational in-group pressure. Cross-cutting demographics on Unit A\nalso put nurses and PCTs at the intersection of many different group affiliations\nthat exerted diverse and counteracting pressures, increasing their freedom by\nweakening the power any one particular group affiliation had over their\nthoughts, actions, and loyalties. For example, nurses and PCTs on Unit A were\nless beholden to the occupational dress norms typical of most other units and\nother shift times on Unit A. While nurses and PCTs on Unit B dressed in a way\nthat distinguished them from one another, with most nurses wearing plain blue\nor subdued monochromatic scrubs and most PCTs wearing bright, colorful,\nmatching patterned and cartooned scrubs, on Unit A they did not. On Unit A,\nnurses and PCTs wore a mixture of dress styles, and individual nurses and\nPCTs often mixed up their dress styles from night to night. In addition, on Unit\nB, nurses and PCTs sat in separate locations in the nursing station, with nurses\nforming a circle with their workstations in the center of the nursing station\nwhile PCTs sat along the periphery. On Unit A, in contrast, nurses and PCTs\nsat interspersed in the nursing station.\nThe conversational topics of the Unit A nursing group were also highly\naccessible to people with diverse age, racial, national, and class backgrounds;\nUnit A nurses talked about the weather, work schedules, cleaning, vacations,\nand hospital or unit-related events. PCTs were included in these discussions as\nrespected members of the team, and gossip about other staff was rare. On\nUnit A, the low occupational in-group pressure also allowed nurses and PCTs\nto interact with one another without sanction in ways that conformed to the\nnorms of shared social identities, such as immigrant or mother, rather than just\nto the norms of their occupational identities. As one first-generation Haitian\nnurse in her 30s explained:\nDifferent shifts have different dynamics. It's nice here that I have people like [PCT5A]\nand [PCT10A] here [both of Haitian descent]. . . . And it's no big deal if I want to sit\nwith [PCT5A] and talk about the earthquake [that devastated Haiti] or anyone [PCT or\nnurse] for that matter--no one's going to blink an eye.\nOn Unit B, socializing was highly segregated by occupational group. Here\nthe nurses primarily talked about topics that aligned with their age, racial,\nnational, and class backgrounds as young, white, Northeastern middle-class\nwomen. Their conversations revolved around dating, marriage proposals, wed-\nding planning, pregnancy and getting pregnant, baby showers, vacation plans\nto places like Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod, and music, movies, and televi-\nsion shows featuring primarily all-white, American artists and casts. PCTs on\nUnit B socialized only with other PCTs.\nIn addition, we noted in our field notes several situations on Unit B in which\nnurses or PCTs attempted to act outside of the bounds of occupational norms\nand were reproached by their occupational group members. For example, one\nevening, Nurse23B on Unit B fielded a few calls for a busy PCT and was made\nfun of by the other nurses for acting like a PCT: ``Nurse23B hangs up the call\nlight phone and Nurse14B calls out loudly, `So you're the new secretary now,\nhuh?' She and the other nurses nearby laugh and Nurse23B looks embarrassed\nand makes a joke of it. Nurse23B does not pick up any more calls that night.''\nDuring the course of the study, only one nurse moved between units.\nNurse16, who was young, white, and U.S.-born and had recently graduated\nfrom a local nursing school near the hospital, worked on Unit A for a few\nmonths before switching to Unit B. On Unit A, she collaborated well with most\nof the PCTs she worked with. We observed her make the transition from Unit\nA to Unit B. During her first week on Unit B, she wore colorful and festive\nscrub outfits typical of those worn by both nurses and PCTs on Unit A but only\nby PCTs on Unit B. During this week, we also observed her attempt to find\ncommonalities with the PCTs she worked with, talking with one of the younger\nPCTs about a popular musical group. We saw her openly praise and thank one\nof the PCTs in front of the other nurses. Unfortunately for Nurse16, her actions\nwere condemned by the other nurses on Unit B. We saw the other nurses on\nUnit B gossip about her ``inappropriate'' behavior, and we saw them avoid help-\ning her in several situations even though they went out of their way to help\nother nurses. When Nurse16 had to deal with a patient with an unexplained\nhigh heart rate at the same time that one of her other patients was bleeding,\nnone of the Unit B nurses assisted her, even though this was their common\npractice with other nurses. During this first week, she sat alone on the periph-\nery of the nursing station, and the other nurses did not include her in social\nconversations.\nOver the course of several shifts on Unit B, we saw Nurse16 distance her-\nself socially from the PCTs. She also started conforming to the norms of her\nUnit B occupational group and began exclusively wearing plain blue scrubs like\nthe other nurses. When we left the field, she was demonstrating occupation-\nally prescribed behavior and had gained acceptance from her fellow nurses on\nUnit B.\nFeelings of comfort and liking between groups. Finally, on Unit A, many\nnurses and PCTs shared at least one demographic attribute with members in\nthe other occupational group, leading to higher levels of homophilous\ninteraction and liking across groups. For example, 80 percent of observed\nnurse\u00adPCT dyads on Unit A shared at least one visible social identity in terms\nof race (white, black/African-American, Hispanic, or Asian), age (within 10 years\nin age), or immigration status (U.S.-born or non-U.S.-born), compared with only\n19 percent on Unit B. And more than half of the observed dyads on Unit A (52\npercent) shared at least two visible identities, while none of the observed\nnurse\u00adPCT dyads on Unit B shared two or more visible social identities.\nBecause nurses and PCTs on both units had a superordinate goal of provid-\ning patient care, and hospital authorities supported collaborative nurse\u00adPCT\nrelations, this high degree of homophilous intergroup contact on Unit A had\nboth a direct, interpersonal effect and an indirect, intergroup effect on the\ndynamics of Unit A. The direct, interpersonal effect was that, for members of\nthe nursing and PCT groups who shared at least one demographic characteris-\ntic, positive affect and liking stemmed from having a meaningful social identity\nin common. For example, Nurse7A and PCT12A were both middle-aged,\nHispanic immigrants who frequently communicated in Spanish with one\nanother and expressed interpersonal liking:\nNurse7A steps out into the hallway and PCT12A comes over. . . . Nurse7A says, ``His\n``Okay.'' They then start speaking in Spanish, and Nurse7A is beaming as she puts\nher arm around PCT12A and hugs her.\nThe indirect effect was enhancing nurses' and PCTs' knowledge about the\nother group, reducing anxiety about intergroup contact, and increasing empathy\nand perspective taking across groups. This, in turn, led to increased feelings of\ncomfort and liking even among members of the two groups who did not share\nany demographic characteristics. For example, many nurses on Unit A were\nempathetic to the working conditions of the PCTs with whom they worked,\nwhich led to good relationships even when nurses and PCTs did not share a\nvisible demographic attribute. One young, white, U.S.-born nurse related:\nPCTs, they have a heavy, heavy job. They need our help, just like we need it from\nthem. . . . It's definitely a give and take as they have a hard enough job. . . . I've got-\nten to know some [PCTs] pretty well and honestly, their job is more exhausting and\nthey are paid almost nothing. Some work two jobs.\nIn contrast, on Unit B, few nurses and PCTs shared visible social identity\ncharacteristics. The consolidation of social identity characteristics with occupa-\ntion led to intergroup dislike, discomfort, and anxiety, and it reduced empathy\nand perspective taking during cross-occupational social and work interactions.3\nMany PCTs on Unit B told us they felt uncomfortable approaching the nursing\ngroup in the nursing station, even when they had important questions, and\n3 Gender was not used by nurse\u00adPCT dyads as a shared social identity to draw on in these two\nfeminized occupations. Because nearly all the nurses and PCTs at Huron were women, gender was\nnot a salient social identity relative to other social identities in which there was variation, such as\nrace, age, and immigration status. Gender alone may also have been too broad an identity to pro-\nvide a platform as a meaningful commonality. For example, some white women may want to con-\nnect on gender, but some women of color resist because they feel their experiences are distinctive\n(Cole, 1986; hooks, 1984). But many of the shared social identities drawn upon on Unit A had fem-\ninized elements, such as motherhood.\nmultiple PCTs commented on the poor interpersonal relations between nurses\nand PCTs. One stated, ``No nurse is going to be your friend here. . . . They\ndon't care about me or love me.'' Another stated, ``PCTs and nurses are not so\nclose . . . we only have love for our own.'' In addition, nurses on Unit B, unlike\nUnit A, rarely greeted PCTs when seeing them for the first time during their\nshift. As one PCT said, ``[Nurses] won't even say hi to you. They pretend you're\nnot there or they come up to you and just give you an order or tell you some-\nthing, being all business you know, without asking how you're doing.''\nUse of Dyadic Toolkits\nOn Unit A, the use of non-occupational social identities in interactions broa-\ndened the set of status rules, emotional scripts, meanings, and expertise avail-\nable to nurse\u00adPCT dyads and allowed them to work with one another in non-\ntraditional ways across occupational boundaries. In contrast, the consolidated\ndemographics of Unit B inhibited nurses' and PCTs' use of non-occupational\nsocial identities in interactions. Even the nurses and PCTs who shared social\nidentities did not draw on them to help them collaborate. In addition, the many\nsalient differences in social identities between nurses and PCTs on Unit B exa-\ncerbated collaboration challenges that stemmed from occupational differences,\nand collaboration on Unit B failed.\nCollaboration across different occupational status. The cross-cutting\ndemographics on Unit A allowed nurses and PCTs to draw on shared social\nidentities and successfully negotiate tasks and communicate across occupa-\ntional differences in status. For example, Nurse17A and PCT6A differed in\noccupation and race--Nurse17A identified as white while PCT6A identified as\nAfrican-American--but were both older and U.S.-born. In their social interac-\ntions, they often drew on their common status position as older people to act\naccording to prescriptions of older, hard workers even though doing so ran\ncounter to occupational status rules. Nurse17A told PCT6A, ``Once [a manager\nNurse17A had in the past] wrote me up for being too conscientious, like it was\na negative thing. . . . I think there is just a different work ethic with this new\ngeneration and I'm old school.'' And PCT6A said to us:\nI like a nurse who works as hard as we [PCTs] do and pulls their weight equally\naround here. If they have the same idea as me and want to come here and work hard\nand get the job done, I like that. That's just how I was raised--my generation is like\nthat you know. [Nurse17A] is just like me in that way.\nNurse17A often emptied bedpans for patients when working with PCT6A\neven though this was considered to be PCT work, but the occupational order\nwas by no means overturned. Our field notes show that when they were both\nfree, PCT6A did the PCT work, but when PCT6A was busy, Nurse17A often\nhelped by performing this lower-status work.\nIn addition to drawing on shared social identities to perform tasks across jur-\nisdictional boundaries, nurses and PCTs used the broadened dyadic toolkit pro-\nvided by these shared social identities to communicate in non-traditional ways.\nFor example, Nurse44A and PCT10A differed in occupation, but they shared a\ncommon identity as young, French-Creole-speaking women from families of\nHaitian immigrants. In social interactions, they frequently spoke in French-\nCreole and talked about their relatives still in Haiti. They also followed egalitar-\nian communication rules when socializing. For example, PCT10A initiated joking\nand socializing with Nurse44A, and they frequently touched each other on the\nshoulders or arms when they spoke, as is customary in Haiti. When they com-\nmunicated with one another during work interactions, they drew on the social\nidentity of two equal-in-status Haitians rather than drawing on the social identi-\nties of a higher-status nurse and a lower-status PCT. Our field notes show, for\nexample, that contrary to occupational communication rules, one evening when\nPCT10A was with a patient in a ``contaminated'' room, she initiated an order to\nNurse44A, because if PCT10A had left the room, she would have needed to\nput on new gear to reenter the room:\nPCT10A, who is dressed in full contact precaution attire [a disposable one-time-use\nyellow gown, gloves, and facemask], sticks her head out of a patient room. She calls\nout to Nurse44A, who is a little bit further down the hallway, ``[Nurse44A], can you\nget me some more towels?'' Nurse44A replies, ``Sure,'' and runs to grab PCT10A\nsome towels and brings them to her.\nIn contrast, in Unit B's consolidated social structure, nurse\u00adPCT dyads\ndid not draw on shared social identities in interactions. For example, PCT3B\nand Nurse1B differed in occupation, race, and immigration status, but both\nwere older. Nurse1B did not help PCT3B with her work because she felt\nconstrained by occupational in-group pressure. She said, ``I'm from a genera-\ntion that was trained in the old school way of doing everything for the patient--\ntoileting, bathing, feeding--stuff the PCTs do now. Sometimes I miss doing\nthat stuff because you get more time at the bedside, but it doesn't go over well\nwith the girls here.'' The in-group pressure on Unit B was so strong that, on\noccasions when Unit B nurses did perform PCT tasks such as toileting, many\ndemonstrated they knew this was counter-normative behavior by gagging,\nswatting the air in front of their faces, and plugging their noses.\nThe consolidated demographics on Unit B also meant that most nurses\nand PCTs at the dyad level did not share any visible social identities. In these\ndyads, status differences in race, age, and immigration status frequently exa-\ncerbated occupational status differences. For example, Nurse7B and PCT4B\ndiffered not only in occupation but also in terms of race, age, and immigration\nstatus--Nurse7B identified as white and was young and U.S.-born, while\nPCT4B identified as black and was an older Jamaican immigrant. One eve-\nning, PCT4B informed Nurse7B about a bleeding patient. Nurse7B listened to\nPCT4B but did not go check on the patient. Later that evening, PCT4B\nattempted to handle this issue on her own, even though it was a matter that\nrequired assessment by a nurse. She said that she did not feel comfortable\nspeaking up to challenge Nurse7B's judgment. As we recorded in field\nnotes:\n``I told [Nurse7B], and she said it's not very much [blood], but she didn't even come\nlook. But look--it's a lot of blood!'' She pulls up his Johnny [gown] and there is a\nlarge amount of dried blood on his leg as well as a trickle of bright red blood coming\nfrom his stomach. PCT4B takes a wash cloth and dries the blood up and finds the\nsource on his stomach saying, ``It's still bleeding--fresh blood. I'm gonna need to\ntape on some gauze.''\nCollaboration across different occupational emotion rules. Drawing on\nshared social identities helped nurses and PCTs on Unit A relate effectively\ndespite differences in prescribed occupational emotional rules and scripts, such\nas by helping them to disagree constructively with one another. For example,\nNurse14A and PCT12A differed in occupation and age--Nurse14A was young,\nwhile PCT12A was older--but they shared the identity of black immigrants,\nthough from different countries. They frequently chatted about planning long-\nawaited vacations home to visit their families and expressed frustration over\ntheir limited number of vacation days and rules about how much vacation they\ncould take at once. They also challenged one another's judgment about strate-\ngies for asking their manager for large chunks of time off and contested one\nanother's ideas in a playful manner by jokingly hitting one another when they\ndisagreed. Our field notes show that when Nurse14A and PCT12A worked\ntogether, they drew on this broadened dyadic toolkit of feeling rules for expres-\nsing disagreement:\nNurse14A stops us in the hallway, touches PCT12A on the shoulder and says, ``You\nknow, we picked up two people in 45.'' PCT12A seems confused and says, ``What\ntime? 11? It's not on the paper.'' She checks her notes and playfully pushes\nNurse14A away, saying, ``I don't have them; they're not on my paper!'' Nurse14A\nsmiles and pushes PCT12A back saying, ``No I put them on at 11. You have 45. It's on\nthe schedule.'' PCT12A playfully flicks her wrist and lightly hits Nurse14A on the arm\nand says, ``No you didn't.'' Nurse14A smiles and laughs, ``Yes, it's on the schedule.''\nNurses and PCTs on Unit A also drew on shared social identities to forgive\none another for mistakes. For example, Nurse45A and PCT6A differed in occu-\npation and race--Nurse45A identified as white, while PCT6A identified as\nAfrican-American--but they were both older and U.S.-born. They often drew on\na broadened set of emotional scripts related to their shared identity as grand-\nmothers who were thrifty shoppers to express emotions such as empathy\ntoward one another in social interactions. For example, they frequently sat next\nto one another in the nursing station clipping coupons during downtime while\nlistening to each other's problems, particularly related to their grandchildren\nand to feeling extremely busy with home responsibilities. During these ses-\nsions, they provided one another with emotional support and advice. They\ndrew on this broadened set of emotional scripts in work interactions with one\nanother. For example, even though nurses were often quick to express nega-\ntive emotions toward PCTs when PCTs made mistakes, we observed\nNurse45A being empathetic and forgiving with PCT6A one evening when\nPCT6A forgot to take a needed sample:\nNurse45A says to PCT6A, ``Remember, we need to guaiac him too [take a sample].''\nPCT6A sighs and says, ``Sorry, next time I will. There was just so much.'' Nurse45A\nlaughs and PCT6A laughs as well. Nurse45A says, ``Don't worry about it! Oh, and I\ndid signs on 40 at 10 [took vital signs at 10 P.M.], so don't worry about that.'' PCT6A\nsmiles and replies, ``Thanks!''\nIn contrast, the consolidated demographics on Unit B did not facilitate\nnurses and PCTs relating effectively with one another. Perhaps because of the\nstrict enforcement of occupational norms on Unit B, even when Unit B nurse\u00ad\nPCT dyads did share a common identity, such as mothers or older workers, we\ndid not observe them drawing on this shared social identity in social or work\ninteractions. For example, PCT2B and Nurse4B differed in occupation, race,\nimmigration status, and age, but PCT2B was a mother of three, and Nurse4B\nwas visibly pregnant with her first child. One evening we observed PCT2B\nattempt to relate with Nurse4B by talking about her own experience with preg-\nnancy. Nurse4B rejected PCT2B's attempts with short, one-word answers:\nPCT2B says to Nurse4B, who is seven months pregnant with her first child: ``My first\nused to kick me all the time at work. Does yours do that?'' Nurse4B replies, ``What?\nNo.'' Nurse4B quickly changes the subject and asks PCT2B whether a patient's blood\nsugar has been taken yet.\nThough Nurse4B did not talk with PCT2B about her pregnancy, we observed\nher talking at length to other nurses about it.\nIn addition to promoting negative dynamics between nurses and PCTs who\nshared social identities, the consolidated demographics on Unit B also meant\nthat most nurse\u00adPCT dyads shared no obvious social identities. In these dyads,\nthe differences in emotion rules stemming from different non-occupational\nsocial identities exacerbated differences stemming from occupational identi-\nties. For example, Nurse37B and PCT18B differed in race, age, and immigration\nstatus. In addition to drawing on different occupational feeling rules, Nurse37B\nand PCT18B also drew on different feeling rules related to their non-\noccupational social identities. One evening PCT18B shared with us that, a few\nnights earlier, Nurse37B had left her midway through cleaning a patient right\nbefore the shift change so that PCT18B had to stay late to finish on her own.\nPCT18B explained that she hadn't expressed her annoyance to Nurse37B, in\npart, because she was concerned about being labeled as having an ``attitude''\n(a term associated with negative racial stereotypes for blacks) and being reta-\nliated against: ``You know me, I cooperate. I act like nothing happened. I never\nlet her know. I didn't tell her because that would lead to more issues. She'd\nsay I have an `attitude' if I tried fighting back.''\nCollaboration across different occupational meanings. Many nurses and\nPCTs on Unit A were able to collaborate successfully with one another by\ndrawing on a broader cultural toolkit of shared meanings afforded by a common\nsocial identity at the dyad level. Drawing on these shared social identities\nhelped nurses and PCTs respect one another's beliefs and values. For example,\nNurse9A and PCT21A were similar in age but differed in occupation, race, and\nimmigration status--Nurse9A was an Indian immigrant, while PCT21A was\nU.S.-born and white. But they had found the nonvisible identity of mother to\nhelp frame their interactions with one another. They frequently talked about\ntheir children, and they often shared parenting philosophies, such as the impor-\ntance of doing reading and writing exercises with their children at home in addi-\ntion to sending them to preschool. Their demonstrated appreciation of one\nanother's beliefs and values about parenting sometimes spilled over into their\nwork interactions, where we saw them indulge and appreciate one another's\noccupation-related beliefs and values. For example, one evening, PCT21A\nexplained her belief about speaking kindly to a comatose patient to Nurse9A,\nand Nurse9A, though initially not understanding, proceeded to go along with\nPCT21A, changing her interaction with the patient to suit PCT21A's preferred\nstyle:\nNurse9A and PCT21A head over to their patient's room. PCT21A brightly greets the\npatient and says, ``Hi Christopher!'' Nurse9A looks at PCT21A quizzically and says,\n``He doesn't respond. He's completely dependent--a veggie.'' PCT21A replies confi-\ndently, ``I know but I like to say hi anyway.'' PCT21A continues [to the patient],\n``We're gonna reposition you now.'' Nurse9A begins to copy PCT21A's interaction\nstyle and says softly and sincerely, ``Hi Christopher! I'll clean your mouth, ok?''\nPCT21A and Nurse9A continue to talk to the patient as if he were sentient while they\nclean and change him.\nDrawing on shared social identities also helped nurses and PCTs on Unit A\nadjust their demeanor to suit one another's preferred patient interaction style.\nFor example, Nurse72A and PCT26A were members of different occupations,\nbut they were both young, white locals. In their social interactions with one\nanother, they often shared stories of their weekend escapades and drew on\nthe common demeanor of young partiers as they assertively joked with one\nanother. When interacting with Nurse72A, PCT26A often acted counter to the\noccupationally prescribed reserved and quiet PCT demeanor:\nNurse72A asks PCT26A, ``How was your weekend? Did you end up going to that\nparty?'' PCT26A replies, ``My weekend was good. I ended up staying out last night\nway later than I wanted to. . . .'' Nurse72A laughs and then holds up in the air a plas-\ntic bag containing three pairs of underwear that a discharged patient left behind in\nher room. She gestures toward PCT26A and jokes, ``Are those yours? Do you want\nsome new underwear?'' PCT26A jokes back, ``No, you should take them since you're\nprobably not wearing any.'' They both laugh.\nWhen they worked together, they drew on this broadened set of demeanors\nto act assertively toward patients. For example, while the PCT occupational\ndemeanor prescribed being reserved with patients when in front of nurses, we\nsaw PCT26A openly joke with patients in Nurse72A's presence:\nWe head into the room of a new admission to take vital signs. Nurse72A is in the\nroom introducing herself to the patient saying, ``My name is [Nurse72A] and I'll be\nyour nurse . . . [she sees PCT26A come in] and this is [PCT26A]. She's working with\nme.'' PCT26A greets the patient warmly saying, ``How are you tonight?'' The patient\nreplies, ``I'm great, thanks.'' PCT26A jokes back saying, ``Then why are you here?''\nNurse72A laughs and the patient replies, ``Well I guess I could be better.'' Everyone\nlaughs.\nThe situation on Unit B differed greatly. For example, PCT18B and Nurse23B\ndiffered in occupation, race, and immigration status, but both were older. While\nwe observed many nurse\u00adPCT dyads on Unit A draw on a shared social identity\nlike age to judge the actions of members of the other group as appropriate\neven though doing so ran counter to traditional occupational meanings, we did\nnot observe PCT18B and Nurse23B do this. Being older was a devalued iden-\ntity in this context and, on Unit B, the immediately visible association between\noccupational position and race, age, and immigration status activated the use\nof common negative stereotypes about traditionally devalued social identities.\nPerhaps for this reason, Nurse23B did not connect with PCT18B over this\nshared identity:\nNurse23B stands at the outside of the nursing station and stretches her back.\nPCT18B notices her and says, ``My back hurts too. Guess we're just getting old!''\nNurse23B appears caught off guard, and as the other nurses turn to look at her,\nNurse23B replies curtly, ``My back is fine. You're only as old as you feel.''\nOn Unit B, occupational meaning differences were also intensified by differ-\nences in cultural beliefs and values and identity-appropriate demeanors that\nstemmed from differences in visible social identities. For example, Nurse8B\nand PCT4B differed not only in occupation but also in race, age, and immigra-\ntion status. Nurse8B had grown up in the Northeast where the ethic of a fast-\npaced life oriented around efficiency was the norm, while PCT4B had spent\nmore of her life in Jamaica, which she described as having a slower pace of life\nand as valuing relationships. PCT4B often interpreted Nurse8B's quick pace as\ntypical of ``work-obsessed'' Americans, and said she refused to let herself be\nrushed when Nurse8B was working rapidly to accomplish certain tasks:\n``People here [in the U.S.] don't know how to relax. Where I come from, it's\nnot like that. You know I work hard. But there's no need to act like that'' (she\npoints to Nurse8B who just ran by us, sighing and calling out behind her to\nanother nurse). Nurse8B likewise had difficulty appreciating PCT4B's\n``Jamaican'' demeanor at work: ``Nurse8B says to me, `I'm gonna page PCT4B.\nIt will probably take her like 10 minutes to get in there' (she rolls her eyes as\nshe speaks). She goes over to the call-light computer and sends her a text page\nthat reads, `New admit in 9. Can you do [vital] signs?'''\nCollaboration across different occupational expertise. Finally, many of\nthe nurse\u00adPCT dyads on Unit A drew on broader sets of expertise afforded by\na shared social identity, despite the fact that nurses relied primarily on compu-\nterized information while PCTs relied primarily on sensory information to do\ntheir work. For example, Nurse17A and PCT2A differed in race and age--\nNurse17A identified as white and was older, while PCT2A identified as black\nand was younger. But both were born in the U.S., and they shared social identi-\nties as locals who were raised in the surrounding area and were avid fans of\ntheir city's sports teams. In their social interactions with one another, they\noften discussed highlights from recent games and shared player statistics and\ntheir own feel for their team's chances of beating rival teams and advancing to\nthe playoffs. During these exchanges, they often went to the computer for\ngame updates. PCT2A acted outside of the bounds of PCT occupational norms\nby using the computer, but the cross-cutting demographics on Unit A wea-\nkened occupational in-group pressure, and they appeared unconcerned about\nbeing sanctioned for their behavior; they were quite vocal in front of other\nnurses and PCTs about going to the computer to check scores.\nWhen they engaged in work interactions, they drew on the same routines\nthey used for sharing information about player statistics and how their teams\nwere performing. For example, one evening, Nurse17A asked for PCT2A's sen-\nsory information about how a patient had been breathing the evening before,\nand Nurse17A shared with PCT2A some computerized nursing information and\nexplained the medical reasoning around a care decision:\nNurse17A and PCT2A roll the patient so Nurse17A can assess his skin. . . . The\npatient begins to wheeze violently. Nurse17A looks concerned and asks PCT2A, ``Did\nhe get like this yesterday?'' PCT2A, ``Yes, he was just like this.'' Nurse17A tries to\nsoothe the patient and listens again to his throat with the stethoscope. Nurse17A\nthen says to PCT2A, ``I think I'm going to get a humidifier for him, to help loosen the\nsecretions in his throat.'' PCT2A replies, ``I think that's a good idea.'' Nurse17A adds,\n``And I checked the computer earlier, and he is at risk for a seizure, so he should have\na green pad.''\nNurses and PCTs on Unit A also drew on common social identities to share\nexpertise despite differences in occupational knowledge bases. For example,\nNurse24A and PCT12A differed in race, age, and immigration status, but we\nsaw them use their common, nonvisible identity of working mother to help\nframe their interactions. Nurse24A was a new mother, and PCT12A was the\nmother of two older boys. In their social interactions with one another,\nNurse24A often asked for advice about taking care of a newborn, and PCT12A\noften provided her with advice about being a working mother. In these interac-\ntions, they discussed both abstract expertise (e.g., different theories of mother-\ning) and idiosyncratic, child-specific expertise, such as how to help this\nparticular baby sleep.\nBecause nurses privilege abstract, formal knowledge of diseases, medica-\ntions, and lab results in guiding their decision making, they often consider\nPCTs' knowledge to be irrelevant. But Nurse24A and PCT12A's expertise-\nsharing routines around being working mothers carried over into work interac-\ntions in which Nurse24A expressed interest in PCT12A's occupational knowl-\nedge and expertise. For example, one evening, Nurse24A asked for PCT12A's\npatient-specific expertise around a patient PCT12A had just attended to. And\nNurse24A shared with PCT12A her abstract expertise on interpreting this\npatient's unusual behavior, even though most nurses did not spend time teach-\ning PCTs the medical rationale behind their work:\nNurse24A and I leave the room and pass PCT12A, who had just attended to the bed\nalarm on a shared patient. Nurse24A says to PCT12A, ``How is he? Is he acting up?''\nPCT12A says, ``He's confusing me. He says he wants to eat. So I ask him what he\nwants to eat and he says he wants a sandwich but now he's saying no to a sandwich\nand he said he lost $50 and has to go get it.'' Nurse24A replies sympathetically,\n``Well he came in drunk. The most dangerous thing having to do with withdrawal is\nwithdrawing from alcohol, that's why we have to keep watching him.''\nIn contrast, the consolidated social structure on Unit B prevented nurses\nand PCTs from drawing on non-occupational social identities to share expertise\nwith one another across occupation-specific bodies of knowledge, sources of\ninformation, and patient-care skills. For example, PCT22B and Nurse11B dif-\nfered in occupation, race, age, and immigration status. Based on private\nconversations with them, we knew they shared a common social identity as\nmothers of two boys, but to our knowledge they never discovered this com-\nmonality, perhaps because of the strong levels of dislike between occupational\ngroups on Unit B. For example, one night Nurse11B asked every nurse what\ntype of frozen yogurt they wanted to order in but did not ask PCT22B or any of\nthe other PCTs working nearby.\nThe lack of cross-cutting demographics on Unit B not only promoted nega-\ntive dynamics among nurses and PCTs at the unit level but also meant that\nnurses and PCTs at the dyad level rarely shared visible social identities.\nDifferences in occupational expertise were magnified by differences in cultural\nknowledge, proficiency with information technology, and assumptions about\nskills that stemmed from differences in race, immigration status, and age, in\naddition to differences in occupation. For example, Nurse39B and PCT3B dif-\nfered not only in occupation but also in race, age, and immigration status. Their\noccupational differences in fluency with computerized information were exacer-\nbated by differences in life experience with computers, which stemmed from\ntheir other differing non-occupational social identities. As a young, upper-\nmiddle-class woman, Nurse39B had grown up with computers, owned a\npersonal computer, and was extremely adept at using computers for work and\nleisure. In contrast, PCT3B had come from a farming family in Liberia before\nimmigrating to the U.S. and had never owned a computer.\nOne evening, Nurse39B related to us that she did not see the value in meet-\ning to share information with PCT3B because ``[PCT3B] can just check the\ncomputer.'' Later that evening, we saw PCT3B trying to access Huron's elec-\ntronic patient management portal to review the basic care information on her\npatients, but she had difficulty doing so (in part because the portal underwent\nmultiple major updates during the 12 months we observed). Giving up on\naccessing the computer to find out a new patient's restrictions on taking blood\npressure, she went to see the patient and asked him to tell her the arm on\nwhich he preferred to have his blood pressure taken. He said the left arm, and\nshe began checking his blood pressure. Nurse39B came in, gasped, and said in\nan annoyed tone of voice, ``[PCT3B]! Can you use the other arm? The IV is in\nthis one.'' PCT3B replied calmly, ``I know, but he told me this arm and I listen\nto them.'' Nurse39B's eyes got big, and she huffed out a puff of air. Ignoring\nPCT3B, she turned to the patient and said, ``[PCT3B] will take your blood pres-\nsure and I'll be back.''\nPossible Alternative Explanations\nThough our analysis showed that cross-cutting demographics between occupa-\ntional groups on Unit A generated intergroup dynamics that allowed members\nof cross-occupational dyads to collaborate successfully by drawing on a shared\nsocial identity in their interactions with one another, there are two important\nalternative explanations for the successful cross-occupational collaboration we\nobserved, as well as others that we address in Online Appendix B. First, can\nthe successful cross-occupational collaboration on Unit A and its failure on Unit\nB be explained by unit-wide differences in culture or selection and retention\nprocesses? If this were so, we would have expected to see all nurse\u00adPCT\ndyads on Unit A engage in successful cross-occupational collaboration, and\nwe did not. Even though Unit A's social structure was characterized by\ncross-cutting demographics, there were a handful of nurse\u00adPCT dyads on the\nunit that did not collaborate well because they did not share or discover a social\nidentity that enabled sufficiently strong identification to overcome their other\ndifferences. Two of these six dyads had no visible common social identity in\nrace, age, or immigration status; their life experiences stemming from their\nother social identities were extremely different and did not provide any com-\nmon platforms for shared identification. The other four dyads on Unit A that did\nnot collaborate well with one another did share at least one visible common\nsocial identity. One shared an immigrant identity (but differed in age and race),\none shared an age identity (but differed in race and immigration status), one\nshared a racial identity (but differed in age and immigration status), and one\nshared both age and racial identities (but differed in immigration status). In each\ncase, the dyads either did not experience their common identities as truly\nshared or there were too many other differences to overcome for the common-\nality to create a sufficient bridge (e.g., they also differed in marital status, ethni-\ncity, motherhood status, and/or country of origin). For example, in one dyad,\nboth members were black but had different ethnicities--one was African and\none was African-American--and they experienced their racial identities\ndifferently.\nSecond, was it individual personality characteristics that drove the uncolla-\nborative interactions between the nurses and PCTs? Our data suggest this is\nnot the case. We observed members of each of these six Unit A dyads have\nsuccessful social and working relationships with other nurses and PCTs with\nwhom they drew on shared non-occupational social identities. For example,\nPCT2A and Nurse7A did not share or discover a common social identity and did\nnot collaborate well with one another. But they were each able to collaborate\nwell with other staff with whom they had identified a shared social identity.\nDISCUSSION\nDifferences in occupational status rules, emotional scripts, meanings, and\nexpertise can make it difficult for members of different occupations to collabo-\nrate with one another even when the organization provides collaboration tools.\nWe found that these differences can be overcome in social structures where\ncross-cutting demographics facilitate cross-occupational dyads' use of shared,\nnon-occupational social identities in their interactions with one another. Using\nshared social identities expands their dyadic toolkit of available status rules,\nmeanings, emotional scripts, and expertise, guides their interactions, and\nallows them to work successfully with one another across occupational differ-\nences, as figure 1 illustrates.\nIn our study, Unit A was characterized by a social structure in which occupa-\ntional status was uncorrelated with demographic characteristics, meaning that\nthose who occupied a high-level position in the occupational hierarchy (nurses)\nfrequently did not possess only high-status social identities, and members who\noccupied a low-level position in the occupational hierarchy (PCTs) frequently did\nnot possess only low-status social identities. The cross-cutting demographics\non Unit A promoted three kinds of intergroup dynamics between nurses and\nPCTs: (1) the valuing of traditionally devalued identities, (2) low occupational in-\ngroup pressure, and (3) feelings of intergroup comfort and liking even among\nmembers who did not share visible demographic characteristics.

Even though most dyads on Unit A differed\non at least one visible demographic characteristic, most of these dyads drew\non a shared identity in their interactions with one another. This shared identity\nafforded them a dyadic toolkit of shared non-occupational status rules, mean-\nings, emotional scripts, and expertise that they used to collaborate successfully\nwith one another across occupational differences.\nOn Unit B, in contrast, the consolidated demographics activated the use of\ncommon negative stereotypes about traditionally devalued identities, led to\nstrong occupational in-group pressure, and fostered discomfort and disliking\nbetween occupational groups. This social structure inhibited nurses' and PCTs'\nuse of shared social identities in interactions. Even the nurses and PCTs who\nshared social identities did not draw on them to help them collaborate. In addi-\ntion, the many salient differences in social identities between nurses and PCTs\non Unit B exacerbated collaboration challenges that stemmed from occupa-\ntional differences, and collaboration on Unit B failed. These findings about\ncross-cutting demographics and dyadic toolkits contribute to both the literature\non cross-occupational collaboration and the literature on demography and inter-\ngroup relations.\nCross-occupational Collaboration\nWe make three contributions to the literature on cross-occupational collabora-\ntion. First, in terms of barriers to successful cross-occupational collaboration,\nprior studies have shown that differences in occupational status, shared mean-\nings, and expertise make it challenging for members of different occupations\nto collaborate (e.g., Carlile, 2004; Kaplan, 2008). Our findings demonstrate that\ncross-occupational collaboration difficulties can stem not only from occupa-\ntional differences but also from demographic differences and suggest that the\ncurrent literature may be overstating the occupational character of cross-\noccupational collaboration difficulties and understating their demographic char-\nacter. Our findings suggest that previous studies may be attributing more to\noccupational differences than justified. We find that, in consolidated social\nstructures, which occur frequently given strong occupational clustering by race,\ngender, age, and immigration status, dyad-level differences in status rules,\nemotion rules, meanings, and expertise stemming from different non-\noccupational social identities can exacerbate occupational differences and lead\nto failed collaboration.\nSecond, in terms of when successful cross-occupational collaboration can\noccur, the current literature demonstrates that it can occur when members\nhave access to organizational tools provided by top managers such as rules and\nroutines, boundary objects, and common spaces (see Okhuysen and Bechky,\n2009, for a review). Even when such tools are available, however, collaboration\noften fails, as members of higher-status occupations use these very tools to\nenforce occupational boundaries to protect their privilege (Bechky, 2003a).\nBecause nurses and PCTs on both units had access to the same rules and rou-\ntines, boundary objects, and common spaces but collaborated differently, our\nresearch shows that the use of such collaboration tools to overcome or rein-\nforce boundaries can be shaped by the degree of cross-cutting demographics\nin the social structure. Cross-cutting demographics at the unit level promote\nparticular intergroup dynamics that loosen attachments to the occupational\nidentity and status order and allow members of different occupational groups\nto draw on a shared social identity at the dyad level that enables collaboration.\nThird, in terms of how successful cross-occupational collaboration occurs,\nthe current literature shows that it occurs when members use organizational\ntools to facilitate the negotiation of status, translation of meanings, and com-\nmunication of expertise across occupational boundaries (e.g., Bechky, 2003b;\nKellogg, Orlikowski, and Yates, 2006). Our findings show that successful colla-\nboration can also occur when members of different occupational groups draw\non a shared non-occupational social identity that broadens their dyadic toolkit.\nThis dyadic toolkit provides them with alternative status rules that allow them\nto successfully negotiate tasks and communicate across occupational differ-\nences in status, alternative emotional scripts that allow them to express dis-\nagreement and forgiveness with one another, alternative beliefs, values, and\ndemeanors that allow them to understand and appreciate one another's\nactions, and alternative bodies of knowledge, information, and skills that allow\nthem to share occupation-specific expertise. In some ways, our finding about\nthe importance of a shared social identity is akin to Bechky's (2003b) finding\nabout the importance of ``common ground'' to cross-occupational collaboration.\nBut Bechky's design engineers, technicians, and assemblers found common\nground by coming into one another's physical work spaces, and our nurses and\nPCTs found common ground by drawing on a shared, non-occupational identity\nin interactions.\nDemography and Intergroup Relations\nThis paper also makes several contributions to our understanding of demogra-\nphy and intergroup relations. First, scholars have shown that occupational\ndemography matters for individual outcomes such as members' experience,\naccess to advancement, and equity with regard to pay and other privileges\ndemonstrate that it also matters for organizational outcomes such as cross-\noccupational collaboration. Cross-cutting demographics promote positive inter-\ngroup identification experiences that provide dyads with an expanded toolkit of\nstatus rules, emotional scripts, meanings, and expertise to help them over-\ncome differences and collaborate successfully.\nSecond, scholars have shown that cross-cutting demographics facilitate\nthree psychological processes that promote positive intergroup relations: the\nvaluing of traditionally devalued identities because of the proportional represen-\nlow in-group pressure because of a high degree of intersecting group affilia-\ntions that exert diverse and often counteracting identity pressures (e.g., Blau\nand Schwartz, 1984), and intergroup liking and trust via direct and indirect\neffects of homophilous cross-group interactions (e.g., Pettigrew and Tropp,\nloosen attachment to the dominant identity and status order and allow inter-\ngroup dyads to discover a shared identity that can serve as a source of connec-\ntion, identification, and collaboration. These findings also help explain the\nmechanism underlying what other scholars refer to as ``weak faultlines'' (e.g.,\nLau and Murnighan, 1998). Previous scholarship in the faultlines tradition has\nattributed positive outcomes from weak faultlines to the absence of polarizing,\nstrong faultlines. We specify a mechanism that suggests how weak faultlines\nmay lead to better intergroup relations and outcomes: the loosening of attach-\nment to the dominant identity and status order enables intergroup dyads to\nconnect around other shared social identities and improves intergroup relations\nand collaboration.\nThird, the current literature suggests that intergroup contact facilitates posi-\ntive intergroup relations under a particular set of conditions: when the two\ngroups are equal in status, when authorities support interaction between the\ntwo groups (Pettigrew et al., 2011), when the groups share a superordinate\ngoal (Allport, 1954), when the teams' learning environment is seen as suppor-\nwhen cultural differences are valued (Ely and Thomas, 2001; Apfelbaum,\nNorton, and Sommers, 2012). Our findings demonstrate that positive inter-\ngroup dynamics can result even when the two groups are unequal in status\n(e.g., occupation) as long as there are cross-cutting demographics so that other\nstatus-laden characteristics are equally distributed across groups. Our findings\nalso suggest that organizations responding to calls to ``increase diversity'' need\nto attend to issues of status and hierarchy. And that means ensuring diversity\nacross all levels of the occupational hierarchy within the organization.\nFuture Research\nThese findings raise several questions for future research. First, we have\nadvanced a model of how cross-occupational dyads can use the dyadic toolkits\nprovided by their shared social identities to collaborate successfully with one\nanother, but we were not able to model the process by which dyads come to\nfind these shared social identities. On Unit A, even dyads with no visible, com-\nmon demographic characteristic often used a shared, nonvisible identity to help\nguide their interactions. Future research could gather data on cross-\noccupational dyads from when they first encounter one another to map the pro-\ncess by which dyads discover shared social identities.\nSecond, we show that cross-occupational dyads may fail to collaborate suc-\ncessfully even when they both work in a social structure with cross-cutting\ndemographics and share a visible social identity. We suggest this happens\nwhen the dyads do not experience their common identities as truly shared or\nbecause there are too many other differences to overcome for the commonal-\nity to create a sufficient bridge. This is consistent with research on intersection-\nality, which shows that it is imperative to examine all the ways different social\nidentities interact. For example, important variation is missed when scholars\nlump together all black people without considering how their other social identi-\nties, such as age, nationality, gender, or immigration status, affect cognition\n2013). Because we observed only a handful of these cases of failed cross-\noccupational collaboration among dyads working in a social structure with\ncross-cutting demographics who share a visible social identity, we were not\nable to fully explore the mechanisms associated with their failure. For example,\nwith our data, we cannot rule out the possibility that these dyads failed to colla-\nborate because of interpersonal issues or conflict within the dyad rather than\nbecause of identity differences. Future research could investigate these\nmechanisms. What our study has shown, however, is that demography and\nshared social identities are critical to increasing our understanding of how peo-\nple can move beyond occupational differences to work effectively together.\n"
