The Design Value Index 2016 confirms\nthat organizations that use design to innovate outperform rivals (Rae, 2016).\nUltimately, as Buchanan (2015) states, the outcome of design capability within\norganizations is to improve the lives of customers, stakeholders and employees\nwho daily interface with a particular organization. Buchanan's perspective consid-\ners the journey toward design integration not just a matter of profitability, but of\ncreating a better future for generations to come. However, the challenge remains\n(and is particulary relevant for organizations that wish to adopt design), how is\ndesign capability developed.\nThe research landscape lacks contributions that reveal how design becomes\nintegrated within the fabric of an organization as a new way creating and capturing\nvalue. Such a gap in knowledge determines that a researcher in this space must\nmove beyond the traditional boundaries of organizational research toward flexible\nand context orientated inquiries. Within the design research society there is recog-\nnised need to promote diverse and impactful new modes of research that integrate\ndeeply into the design process (Dorst & Hendriks, 2007). However, context bound\nand flexible approaches to organizational research such as action research have\nfaced critique from positivist sections of the design society \u00ad even while conceptual\nThe purpose of this paper is to explore the extended role of action researcher as\ndesign innovation catalyst. To date this extended role has been utilized in numer-\nous studies seeking to build design capability in organizations, and in such contexts\nas aged care (Nusem, Wrigley, & Matthews, 2017), manufacturing (Doherty,\nWrigley, Matthews, & Bucolo, 2015; Krabye, Wrigley, Matthews, & Bucolo,\n(Garrett, Straker, & Wrigley, 2017), and the automotive industry (Bryant &\nWrigley, 2014). These studies involved partnerships between action researchers\nas design innovation catalysts and Australian small to medium enterprises that\nwere facing respective innovation challenges. The outcomes of the studies above\nemphasized reporting on the journey of the organizations involved to strengthen\nthe conceptual legitimacy of design-led innovation (DLI) \u00ad or a third-person inqui-\nry. To date there has been limited evaluation or reflection upon this extended role\nof action researcher as design innovation catalyst to benefit the research commu-\nnity \u00ad second person inquiry (Torbert, 2001). It is to this research gap that this\narticle responds by providing new knowledge from a second-person inquiry of\naction researcher as `catalyst'. The first author undertook a period of 18 months\nembedded within an Australian Airport Corporation (AAC), working in partner-\nship with stakeholders to develop design capability.\nBackground\nIt is important from the outset of this article to establish four key concepts that are\nin a state of interplay throughout this article. First, DLI is a framework with\nparticular focus on developing design capability. In this context, design is\nviewed explicitly in a practical sense as a way of thinking and doing, underpinned\nby abductive reasoning that can be learnt and therefore applied to solve problems\n(Dorst, 2011). Second, the design innovation catalyst (at times shortened to\n`catalyst' throughout the article) is an expert of DLI who demonstrates, engages\nand coaches an organization in their journey toward design capability. Third,\naction research provides an action-orientated inquiry (Bradbury, 2015) that is\nharnessed to deepen intellectual efforts to understand and improve knowledge of\nDLI as an emerging field, while simultaneously developing design capability within\nthe partnering organization. These three concepts interplay and form the basis for\nthis inquiry, but remain conceptually distinct. The fourth concept is the role of the\naction researcher as an active shaper of collaboration (Huzzard, Maina Ahlberg, &\nEkman, 2010). The role of the action researcher is extended by that of the design\ninnovation catalyst. Enriching the current practice of action research will be the\nfocus of this article.\nDesign-led innovation\nIn an increasingly competitive and uncertain world, the ability of an organization\nto innovate becomes a means not only for growth, but also survival. DLI as a\nframework is intended to support the learning and consequent application of\ndesign across an organization. Implementation of DLI has been observed to pos-\nitively influence firm innovation performance by aiding the realization of new\npossibilities (Wrigley, 2016). The DLI framework is illustrated in Figure 1 and is\ncomprised of the `external' and `internal' spaces of organization, intersected by\n`operational' and `strategic' activities. According to Bucolo, Wrigley, and\nMatthews (2012), moving through the framework involves three key phases.\nThese phases are:\n1. Gathering customer insights from customers and stakeholder that reveal deeper\nlatent needs;\n2. Proposing future orientated solutions that capture value from these customer\nand stakeholder insights, prototyping and testing solutions with stakehold-\ners and;\n3. Shaping strategy that leverages the value unlocked by future orientated propo-\nsitions \u00ad these propositions being grounded in customer and stakeholder insight.\nPrice et al. 3\nOrganizational context for action research\nAirports operate and grow upon the strength of reputation. The reputation of\nbeing a fast airport with excellent passenger experience attracts customers to do\nbusiness at that location. Innovation becomes a necessary activity to take leader-\nship and continually improve operations to maintain good reputation in an indus-\ntry that is concerned by rankings and awards. Profitability matters aside, airports\nplay a crucial role as the enabler of mobility on which modern society has become\nhighly reliant. There is much to be learnt from organizations which operate under\nthe associated pressures of high reliability status such as airports (Chivers, 2014).\nThe AAC engaged the design innovation catalyst to implement DLI as a new\napproach to creating and capturing value. At the time, the design innovation cat-\nalyst was beginning doctoral research in the field of DLI and entered the AAC. The\naction-orientated inquiry allowed the design innovation catalyst to work within the\nAAC for a period of 18 months. Three cycles of action research occurred, with\neach cycle corresponding to an industry project (see Figure 2). Semi-structured\ninterviews and focus group discussion provided the catalyst greater visibility within\nthe organization and opportunities to involve a greater number of participants\nwith DLI, a strategy described by Agostinone-Wilson (2012). Further, data gen-\nerated as an outcome of action were captured in field notes and a reflective journal\nkept by the catalyst to capture, monitor and assess the participants' growing sense\nof awareness (Brodsky, 2008). Additional details of each project can be viewed in\nAppendix 1.\nFigure 1. Design-led innovation framework.\nEach cycle of action research corresponded to the tasks set out by Wrigley\nstates the catalyst must; `dissect' (understand the organization); coach DLI\nenabling employees to `learn' design, and; `integrate' DLI before concluding the\nembedded period within the organization. Therefore, action research cycle one\nsought to `dissect' the AAC context; action research cycle two sought to coach\nand `learn' DLI with AAC employees, and; action research cycle three sought to\n`integrate' DLI as an accepted way of working across the AAC.\nDesign innovation catalyst\nTo facilitate the journey of organization to adopting DLI, the design innovation\ncatalyst described by Wrigley (2016), becomes vital to guiding an organizations'\nprogression toward design. The design innovation catalyst coaches the use of\ndesign methods and skills. Further, the catalyst works with an organization's\nemployees and stakeholders to complete real projects. The catalyst operates\nbetween business and design to translate abstractions of research and the realities\nof practice into value for the organization. The framework for the design innova-\ntion catalyst (Wrigley, 2016), mirrors that of DLI in that there is an underpinning\naxis for related contexts intersected by activities (see Figure 3). The catalyst must\ntraverse academic and industry domains while undertaking teaching and learning\nactivities. Such a role requires a pragmatic attitude and a set of capabilities that\npromote adaptability. Wrigley (2016; 2017) further describes the capabilities and\npractice required to fulfil this role which can be viewed in Table 1.\nFigure 2. Extended role of action researcher as Design innovation catalyst framework.\nPrice et al. 5\nAn intersection with the capabilities of an action researcher and the design\ninnovation catalyst can be determined as both roles concern understanding and\nimproving situations encountered (Bradbury, 2015). However, there are also\nunique nuances between the two roles. The defining characteristics of an action\nresearcher can be conceptually extended by that of the design innovation catalyst.\nThis extension can be viewed in Table 2.\nAction research cycle (ARC) 1 \u00ad understanding the AAC and building trust\nARC1 challenged the design innovation catalyst to understand and describe\nthe AAC from within, to develop rapport with stakeholders and employees, dem-\nonstrate DLI and convince the organization of the framework's value. Getting to\nknow the employees within the corporation was the first step. As noted in\nthe catalyst's written reflections, `The first cycle consisted of learning about the\norganization'. The key task for me was to `understand and make sense of the\nvalue chain, pick up aviation lexicon and place myself in contact with various\nstakeholders across the business' (Reflective Journal). While interview and focus-\ngroup discussion belong to ethnographic domains of research inquiry, the catalyst\nchose to apply these research methods as a formal way of meeting employees\nwithin the corporation. Interviews were conducted across senior management,\nmiddle management and operational levels from all of the nine departments.\nFigure 3. Design innovation catalyst framework.\nThese interviews also increased the visibility of the catalyst and the mandate to\nimplement DLI across the organization.\nThis first round of interviews occurred in addition to day-to-day activities such\nas attending meetings, lunches and informal staff activities. The catalyst even\njoined the AAC football team in order to meet a diverse range of employees.\nThis unconventional channel outside workplace activities provided opportunities\nfor the catalyst to meet with senior management and advocate the possibilities of\nDLI for the organization. Similarly, the focus group discussion brought together\nmembers of the business development team in which the catalyst was based to\ndiscuss innovation and current perceptions of design. A mix of formal research\nmethods and informal engagements with employees proved crucial in building a\nsolid foundation for later learning and integration of DLI within the organization.\nOne of the challenges for the researcher in the cycle 1 was to gain a deeper\nunderstanding of the organization \u00ad the culture, processes and vision of the AAC\nwhile retaining a design mindset. This was one of the notable tensions of the role of\naction research as catalyst. Having a concise elevator pitch was necessary to ensure\nall contact with employees and stakeholders added to the aim of developing design\ncapability. Many approaches were tried including such as, `I am helping your\norganization innovate by engaging with customers not just spreadsheets', to\n`I am here to help your organization realise its vision to be world best by\nTable 1.

In addition, the design catalyst\nhad to withstand critique from employees who questioned the qualitative and\nparticipatory nature of DLI. For a data-driven organization like an airport oper-\nating in a high-reliability setting, the notion of asking passengers how they liked to\ntravel was deemed by some as an uncertain practice. The catalyst had to be resilient\nto overcome such critique especially given their short history with the organization.\nTwo critical factors emerged here. First the catalyst was advocating a design-led\napproach to innovation which differed to the predominant data-driven approach\nof the AAC. Second, the catalyst was not a full-time staff member of the AAC,\ninstead a `researcher from a university'. Building trust for the catalyst and DLI as a\nframework was therefore identified as a priority during ARC1.\nDuring ARC1, one of the key observations by the catalyst was that discussing\nthe benefits of a design-led approach to innovation was not sufficient to create\ninterest in DLI. A demonstration of DLI within a project was required. This\ninsight is consistent with experiential learning theory identified by Beckman and\nBarry (2007) as part of the foundations of design thinking. Project 1 was created in\nan opportunistic manner with an interested AAC employee who was eager to know\nmore about DLI. The project involved limited financial risk for the company, a\nshort timeline and involved a trusted business partner of the AAC. The project\nsought to understand under what conditions, passengers did and did not engage\nwith money exchange services within the airport terminal, in order to shape new\nservices that would increase the performance of the AAC business partner. Instead\nof using sales data to suggest new services, the catalyst demonstrated to interested\nstakeholders how design methods could be used to involve customers as co-\ncreators of new monetary exchange services. One AAC stakeholder who worked\nclosely alongside the catalyst describes some of the challenges of undertaking DLI:\nThe most challenging element [about this project] was gaining the `trust' from col-\nleagues and [the retail partner] that this [design-led] process would actually work.\nMost people are numbers driven and have not done this type of research before.\nAs a result it was a bit of a challenge to help people fully understand why we\nTable 2.

(Participant)\nThe project proved successful for the business partner, with the solution adopted\nacross the eastern sea board of Australian Airports. With this success, necessary\ntrust amongst AAC employees for both the catalyst and DLI as a new way of\nworking was sparked. This trust now needed to be leveraged to create change in\nthe following cycles of action research. The key learning from ARC1 was, `show\nnot tell' how DLI works and the benefits that come from this alternative approach\nto innovation. Further details and insights from this project are described in Price,\nWrigley and Dreiling (2015). The notion of `show not tell' is consistent with expe-\nriential learning theory that can be traced back through the work of Beckman and\nAction research cycle (ARC) 2 \u00ad teaching and learning DLI\nARC 2 sought to build upon the trust gained in cycle one. In the catalyst's own\nwords, `Action Research cycle 2 consisted of the \"core\" of DLI project work.\nBuilding upon the successful platform of AR1, AR2 sought to promote the full\npossibility of DLI' (Reflective Journal). The platform to coach a broader range of\nemployees on how to apply DLI occurred during Project 2 (see Appendix 1).\nProject 2 was assigned to the catalyst and involved a diverse range of AAC depart-\nments and an external software consultant. This project had a budget, a strict\ntimeline and therefore required financial evaluation and approval from the\nAAC. The catalyst's role within Project 2 was to coach employees DLI \u00ad to\ngather deep customer insights using design methods, facilitate the development\nof future-orientated propositions by reframing (a design activity) and then to eval-\nuate current AAC strategy. This coaching occurred through work in small teams\nwith two to three AAC employees and the catalyst. The tools, methods and\napproaches of DLI were experienced together in workshops and at the airport\nterminal with passengers. Employees and stakeholders were also encouraged by\nthe catalyst to use design methods in other projects.\nDuring Project 2, it became clear that the AAC had not yet considered a unified\ndigital business strategy and various departments were conducting digital value\ncreation in silos. The absence of a digital business strategy and the information\nthat various departments were conducting separate digital value creation was\nreframed as the second opportunity to demonstrate the value and possibilities of\nDLI with employees. However, instead of just demonstrating DLI, the catalyst\nemphasised participation, coaching employees on how to gather insights them-\nselves, reframe propositions and shape a digital strategy during their own practice.\nThis coaching occurred closely with three key senior corporation leaders; the\nManager of Research and Innovation; the Manager of Business Development,\nand; the Senior Manager of Strategic Planning and Development. The Senior\nManager in particular was a gatekeeper to gaining top level support for DLI as\nan appropriate way of innovation within the corporation. If the Senior Manager\nbelieved in DLI and was able to articulate the framework and its potential orga-\nnizational contribution to colleagues, then the catalyst felt as if critical progress\nwas being made. Fortunately the Senior Manager was eager to shape future serv-\nices and products around the AAC's customers' needs and desires, but was without\na framework or the resources to do so.\nThe catalyst seized this opportunity to demonstrate how DLI could support the\norganization's ambitions to become passenger-centric. Top down support was later\nachieved, with a mandate from the CEO and Senior Management Team to launch\nProject 2 to market. The solution involved a world first service that would create\nvalue for the AAC and its customers. The breakthrough nature of Project 2 also\naligned with the AAC's vision to be innovative \u00ad creating valuable evidence that\nDLI could help move the corporation toward a position of leadership within the\ninternational aviation industry. Further, the act of co-creating a digital strategy\nbenefited the organization as described within the design innovation catalyst's\nreflection, `As part of the production of this strategy, the term `digital' was defined.\nThis activity required confidence to define what such a term would mean to\n[the Airport's] own vision and future operation' and, `this is a healthy activity\nfor the organization and developed discourse regarding new concepts, technologies\nand social trends' (Reflective Journal). The catalyst felt at this moment that the\nplanning and execution of interviews and focus group discussions would have\nslowed the momentum of Project 2. Instead, daily events were documented\nthrough field notes, for example, `[Business development] stakeholders are reading\nmore widely about innovation, purchasing innovation books and sharing interest-\ning online articles via email with each other. This did not occur during ARC1'\nthe protocol of participatory observation. The catalyst also engaged in reflective\njournal writing to support a growing internal awareness of the events that were\nunfolding in the AAC, for example the catalyst reflects:\n[In ARC2] there was a clear increase in the use of `innovation', `passenger experience'\nand, `customer needs and wants' within the general language of the business devel-\nopment team. I took this as a sign that my project-orientated approach to coaching\nDLI was having a positive impact. (Reflective Journal)\nIncreased emphasis on the reflective journal and field notes matched the action-\norientated and pressure filled nature of ARC2. The key learning from this\ncycle was that DLI as a framework could assist the corporation to define and\nsolve the right innovation challenges, rather than mimic or follow the actions of\nother industry leading airports \u00ad contributing new knowledge to the steps required\nto move from an innovation-adopting toward an innovation-generating organiza-\ntion (Damanpour & Wischnevsky, 2006). Further new knowledge of the transfor-\nmation required to shift from innovation adoption to generation was formed\n(also see Price & Wrigley, 2016). DLI offered the AAC a level of autonomy and\ngreater confidence in a highly competitive industry. Initiative and leadership was a\npositive step for an organization self-described by employees as `smart follower'.\nWith this success of this evidence-based practice came acceptance of the catalyst as\na trusted member of the AAC.\nAction research cycle (ARC) 3 \u00ad integrating DLI\nARC 3 began after 12 months of inquiry within the AAC by the catalyst and built\nupon learning and success of previous projects. Project 3 sought to design a pas-\nsenger transfer system between the domestic and international terminals of the\nAAC. Cycle three differed from the two previous cycles in this period, as the\ncatalyst was not a project leader. Instead, the catalyst was brought into Project\n3 to observe events and the actions of the Manager of Business Development and\nSenior Manager of Strategic Planning and Development who were both partici-\npants in Project 2. In particular, the catalyst was seeking to observe how these two\nmanagers applied DLI in their own practice. The Manager of Business\nDevelopment played an important role in questioning technology and efficiency\ndriven approaches to Project 3 by operationally orientated stakeholders, `Any\ntechnology or potential service was met with an evaluation built on the following\nsmall but powerful questioning, \"Does the customer need or want this, will this\nimprove our the customer's experience?\"' (Reflective Journal). It became clear that\nthe two senior managers were able to articulate what DLI was and openly advo-\ncate this framework to colleagues, but considered themselves to be project man-\nagers rather than implementers of DLI. Following this realisation, the catalyst and\nsenior managers amended the brief for the Manager of Research and Innovation to\ninclude activities related to DLI, such as gathering customer insights and reframing\npropositions. This structural change coincided with the position's vacancy follow-\ning the recruitment of the previous Manager of Research and Innovation to a gulf\nairport \u00ad and prior to the appointment of an incoming Manager. This recruitment\nwas viewed by the catalyst as evidence of external "
