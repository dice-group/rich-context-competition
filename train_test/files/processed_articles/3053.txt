Data from the medical\nchart included diagnoses, comorbid illnesses, and physi-\nological data including the acute physiology score from the\nAcutePhysiology and ChronicHealthEvaluation(APACHE)\nIII.19 The SUPPORT prognostic model generated 2-month\nand 6-month survival estimates for each patient based on the\nburden of illness at the time of admission to the study.20 The\nSUPPORT model has been shown to adjust well for severity\nof illness and has an area under the receiver operating char-\nacteristic curve of 0.78 for predicting survival.20\nPatients were interviewed between 2 and 5 days after\nadmission to the study (the day-3 interview) and again\nbetween 7 and 11 days after admission to the study, if the\npatient remained hospitalized, or within 5 days of dis-\ncharge from the hospital. During the day-3 interview, pa-\ntients were asked about demographic characteristics (in-\ncluding age, race, sex, marital status, and educational level)\nand functional status 2 weeks before hospitalization as mea-\nsured by a modified Katz Index of Activities of Daily Living\n(ADL) scale.21 Mood assessment was performed during the\nsecond interview, approximately 1 to 2 weeks after admis-\nsiontothestudy,ifthepatientremainedhospitalized,orwithin\n5 days of discharge from the hospital. Of the patients eli-\ngible for an interview, 74% completed the second interview.\nFor 5% of these patients, data were missing for 3 or more de-\npressed mood items. We included only patients who pro-\nvided information about mood in this analysis (N=3529).\nVARIABLES\nClinical\nWe used a modified Katz ADL scale as a guide to ask pa-\ntientsaseriesofquestionsabouttheirself-careabilityforbath-\ning, washing, eating, walking, toileting, dressing, transfer-\nring (ie, independent moves in and out of bed and chair),\nand continence.21 The surrogate (the person identified by the\npatient or physician as the person who would make deci-\nsions for the patient if the patient were unable) was asked\nto assess the patient's ability using the same questions. If re-\nsponses about ADLs were unavailable from the patient, the\nsurrogate's responses for the ADL scale were used to calcu-\nlate the ADL score. If data from the patient and surrogate\nwere missing, an imputed score was used.22 The ADL scores\nranged from 0 to 7, with 0 indicating independence in all\nactivities and 7 indicating the worst physical functioning.\nThree measures of the severity of illness were used in\nthis analysis: the acute physiology score (APS) of the\nAPACHE III score on day 3 after admission to the study;\nthe number of comorbid illnesses present at the time of\nadmission to the hospital and the estimate from the\n\u00a91998 American Medical Association.

Table 3 gives the coefficients, standard errors of\nthe coefficients, the exponential value of the coeffi-\ncients, and the 95% confidence intervals for each covar-\niate in the model.\nIn this model, the ADL score (P.001), the num-\nber of comorbid illnesses (P.001), the 6-month esti-\nmate of survival from the SUPPORT model (P.001), age\npredicted survival time. The 2 of the model was 308 when\nthe df was 7. For example, an increase of 1 ADL depen-\ndency increased the odds of a shorter survival time by\n9.5%. An increase of 1 comorbid illness increased the odds\nof a shorter survival time by 13%. The odds associated\nwith survival time decreased by 13.4% with every unit\nincrease in depressed mood score. Thus, compared\nwith the odds of shorter survival time, depressed mood\nis in the same range as ADL dependencies and comor-\nbid illnesses.\nFigure 2 shows the estimated probability of sur-\nvival time for increments of the POMS depressed mood\nscore, the number of comorbid illnesses, and age. The\nestimated survival for each increment of the variable was\ncalculated separately, holding all other variables in the\nmodel constant at their median. The difference between\na score of 0 (ie, no depressed mood) and a score of 2 (ie,\nmoderate level of depressed mood) was associated with\nan 11% decrease in the estimated survival time, whereas\nthe difference between having no comorbid illnesses and\n4 comorbid illnesses was a 17% decrease in the esti-\nmated survival time. On the other hand, differences in\nage were related less strongly to the estimated survival\ntime: a 40-year increase in age led to a difference of a 9%\nreduction in the estimated survival time.\nSUPPORT project model for 6-month survival,20 which con-\nsiders several clinical indicators of severity of illness.\nMortality\nSurvival time was calculated by subtracting the patient's date\nof death from the date of admission to the study. The re-\nsult was the number of days the patient survived from ad-\nmission to the study until death.\nFor analysis, the final vital status was defined by\nwhether the patient was known to be alive 41/2 years after\nadmission to the study. We continued contacting patients\nup to 180 days from admission to the study for interviews,\nor next of kin to document deaths. After 6 months, the\nnames and social security numbers of patients were traced\nthrough the National Death Index (US Dept of Health and\nHuman Services, National Center for Health Statistics, Bal-\ntimore, Md) for a 4-year period to determine vital status.\nDepressed Mood\nDepressed mood was measured using the depression\nsubscale from the shortened version of the Profile of\nMood States depression scale (POMS).23 The subscale\nconsists of 8 items (ie, unhappy, sad, blue, hopeless, dis-\ncouraged, miserable, helpless, and worthless). For each\ndescriptor, patients were asked whether they had felt\nthis way during the past week. The possible responses\nwere as follows: 0, not at all; 1, a little; 2, moderately; 3,\nquite a bit; and 4, extremely. A depressed mood score\nwas obtained by summing the points and dividing by the\nnumber of items in the scale. The range of depressed\nmood scores was thus 0 to 4, with a higher score indicat-\ning a more depressed mood. If 1 or 2 items were miss-\ning, the score was calculated by using mean substitution.\nIf 3 or more items were unanswered, the depressed\nmood score was considered missing (n=181). The Cron-\nbach  for this version of the POMS was .89, indicating\ngood internal consistency or reliability.\nAge, years of education completed, marital status, and sex\nwere used to describe the patient population. Because many\nof the variables had skewed distributions, nonparametric\nstatistical procedures were used to compare groups within\nthe sample and to study bivariate relationships. To deter-\nmine whether significant differences existed between the\n2 groups, independent sample Wilcoxon rank sum tests were\nused to compare the sample that completed the depressed\nmood assessment with the sample that did not complete\nthe assessment. The Spearman rank correlation was used\nto evaluate the bivariate relationships between depressed\nmood and patient characteristics, illness characteristics, and\nmortality.\nThe mortality rates for the 9 disease categories in the\nSUPPORT project varied during the 6 months of observa-\ntion. For example, patients with a primary diagnosis of acute\nrespiratory failure or multisystem organ failure had higher\n30-day mortality rates than patients with colon or lung can-\ncer, but they all had similar 180-day mortality rates.20 These\ndifferential mortality rates violate the assumption of the Cox\nproportional hazards model that baseline risk is the same\nacross disease groups. Therefore, a Cox proportional haz-\nards model stratified by disease group was used to test\nwhether depressed mood had an independent effect on sur-\nvival time. The disease groups included acute respiratory\nfailure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic heart\nfailure, liver disease, cirrhosis, colon cancer, lung cancer,\nand multisystem organ failure with a malignant neoplasm\nor sepsis. The independent variables in the model in-\ncluded age, ADL score, APS, the number of comorbid ill-\nnesses, sex, the 6-month survival estimate from the\nSUPPORT model, and the POMS depressed mood score.\nThe interaction of ADL with depressed mood also was tested.\nHowever, results proved to be insignificant and, there-\nfore, are not included in the final analysis. All the analyses\nwere performed using statistical software (SPSS for Win-\ndows, release 6.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill).\n\u00a91998 American Medical Association.

What\nmade the present study unique was our ability to assess\na demographically and medically diverse group of hos-\npitalized adults, whereas past research on depression or\ndepressed mood had used mainly homogeneous groups\nof subjects, thus, limiting generalizability.\nDepressive symptoms, or affect, have been found to\nbe associated with increased mortality rates in patients\nin nursing homes.1,2 Many studies have found a predic-\ntive effect of depressive symptoms on mortality in pa-\ning a Cox proportional hazards model stratified for disease\ngroup, we found that depressed mood and severity of ill-\nness independently predicted survival time. Depressed\nmood had a significant association with survival while\naccounting for severity of illness, physical functioning,\nand patient demographics.\nIn contrast, some investigators have not found a re-\nlationship between depressive symptoms and mortal-\nity.5,30-32 Most studies with negative results have studied\nmortality in elderly populations in nursing homes rather\nthan community-based samples. For an older popula-\ntion in poor health, factors other than depression may\nbe stronger determinants of mortality; depression may\nbe minimal and, thus, may not be significantly associ-\nated with mortality. Or, older persons may be more likely\nto die regardless of mood.\nVariable Percentage Mean\nPercentile\nSex, male 58.0 . . . . . . . . . . . .\nWhite 81.0 . . . . . . . . . . . .\nMarried 52.0 . . . . . . . . . . . .\nDisease\nAcute respiratory failure 28.7 . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCongestive heart failure 24.1 . . . . . . . . . . . .\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease 14.3 . . . . . . . . . . . .\nLung cancer 11.9 . . . . . . . . . . . .\nColon cancer 7.8 . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCirrhosis 7.5 . . . . . . . . . . . .\nMultisystem organ failure 5.2 . . . . . . . . . . . .\nNontraumatic coma 0.4 . . . . . . . . . . . .\nDeath by 4\u00bd years 42 . . . . . . . . . . . .\n*Ellipses indicate not applicable; POMS, Profile of Mood States; and SUPPORT, Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of\nTreatments.\nOf the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III.\nPOMS Depressed Mood Score\nFrequency\nFigure 1.

Our results suggest that pa-\ntients who reported low levels of physical functioning,\nas measured by the ADL scale, also were more likely to\nreport a greater magnitude of depressed mood than pa-\ntients with higher levels of physical functioning.\nSome have argued that for patients with chronic and\nsevere illness, it is the illness that produces a decline in\nphysical functioning and not depression. However, Wells\net al16 found that although chronic illness alone did not\naffect physical functioning, the addition of depressive\nsymptoms was associated with a significant reduction in\nfunctioning. Koenig et al14 studied consecutive admis-\nsions to the neurologic service of a Veterans Adminis-\ntration medical center and found that physician-rated\nglobal severity of illness, as measured by a general summed\nrating of illnesses and the number of prescribed medi-\ncations, explained 17.3% of the variance in depression.\nParkerson et al15 also found that subjects with the high-\nest combined severity of illness and disability scores also\nscored worse on depression scales than subjects with low\nseverity of illness and disability scores.\nWhen severity of illness is measured by patients' per-\nceptions of their illness, the association with depression\nis significant, but when severity is assessed by using clini-\ncal data, the relationship diminishes.5 While clinical data\nmay be important to the study of clinical outcomes, they\nmay have little effect on specific patients' perceptions or\nunderstandings of their illness. Depression also may af-\nfect how patients interpret clinical information.\nIn the present study, the associations between de-\npressedmoodandseveritywereweak,butinthepredicted\ndirection.Itispossiblethatbecauseoftheongoingnature\noftheirillnesses,patientsinourstudymayhavebetterclini-\ncal understanding of their medical conditions compared\nwith patients in previous studies. This understanding, in\nturn, may have been reflected in their mood.\nOur study had several limitations. First, our analy-\nsis was based on interviews of patients who agreed to par-\nticipate in the study and were able to be interviewed. The\nsickest patients in the study could not be interviewed.\nWe do not have data to suggest that the responses of the\nsicker patients would be different from or similar to those\nof the patients who were interviewed. Even so, our study\nincluded patients with greater severity of illness than in\nprevious studies.\nSecond, our interview did not include a structured\npsychiatric evaluation. Therefore, we could not diag-\nnose major depression or depressive disorders or assess\nthe relationship between clinical depression and mor-\ntality. However, our analysis does show that a simple easy-\nto-administer depressed mood inventory is indepen-\ndently associated with mortality, emphasizing the\nVariable Increments\n41/2-Year Survival Estimates (Probability)\nAge, y\nNo. of Comorbid Illnesses\nDepressed Mood\nFigure 2.

Still, we were able to\ncontrol for some factors believed to confound the rela-\ntionship between depressed mood and survival, so that\nwe can conclude from our data that depressed mood has\nan independent relationship with survival time.\nCONCLUSION\nWe found that depressed mood was independently re-\nlated to the survival of seriously ill hospitalized pa-\ntients. The relationship between depression and mortal-\nity is complex. Our study extends previous research\nbecause we controlled for the confounding effects of physi-\ncal functioning and severity of illness on depression. How-\never, our study does not explain the mechanisms under-\nlying the relationship between depressed mood and\nmortality. Depressed mood may contribute to mortality\nthrough biological mechanisms, perhaps mediated by a\nlink between mood and immunologic function.33 De-\npressed mood may affect mortality because depressed\nmood can reduce social and psychological functioning\nand, thus, reduce a person's ability to cope with severe\nillness, which, in turn, may affect survival.34-38\nWhy does depressed mood affect survival? Is it be-\ncause patients who have a depressed mood are more likely\nto be pessimistic about their future and make decisions\nthat have a negative effect on outcome? Are patients with\ndepressed moods more willing to forgo aggressive treat-\nments than patients without depressed mood? Research\nto better answer these questions is urgently needed. We\nhope to address these questions in future research.\nOur study indicates that clinicians need to be aware\nof the patient's mood, even if the patient has not been\ngiven a diagnosis of major depression. Because treating\ndepression is easier than increasing the physical func-\ntioning of an ill patient, the treatment of depressed mood\nmay be the most effective of available interventios.\nSupportedbytheRobertWoodJohnsonFoundation,Prince-\nton, NJ.
