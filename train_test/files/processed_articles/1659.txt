However, one water recommenda-\ntion may not be appropriate for all age groups (2). Both in-\nsufficient water intake and increased water excretion make\naged individuals susceptible to dehydration. Consequently,\nsome researchers contend that promoting adequate fluid in-\ntake is the most important modifiable health behavior for\nensuring fluid homeostasis in older adults (3).\nAge-related changes in behavior and health status predis-\npose all older adults (65 years) to dehydration (4,5). Many\nolder adults deliberately avoid drinking beverages because\nthey fear nighttime incontinence (6). In addition, older\nadults may not recognize that they are thirsty as the sensa-\ntion of thirst decreases with age, probably due to changes in\nthe activity of osmoreceptors (7). Although it is difficult to\nexamine the effects of aging independently of chronic dis-\nease, research suggests that aging is associated with kidney\natrophy, decreased cortical blood flow and glomerular filtra-\ntion rate, and diminished maximal urinary concentrating\ncapacity (8,9). These changes can lead to electrolyte imbal-\nances and enhanced water diuresis (10). Often, dehydration\nis cited as a reason for emergency room visits and as a second-\nary diagnosis for hospitalization in the elderly; however, oth-\nerscontendthatdehydrationmaybemisdiagnosedinlong-term\ncare patients (11\u00ad13). Unchecked dehydration can cause\nchanges in body chemistry, kidney failure, kidney stones, uri-\nnary tract infections, bowel cancer, and death (14\u00ad18).\nDespite the consequences of poor hydration, very little\nattention has been devoted to the measurement of total daily\nwater intake of community-dwelling older adults (19). Stud-\nies reported include those with area-specific populations\n(20), limited sample size (21), or middle-aged participants\n(50 years) included in the analysis (22). Other researchers\nhave examined total water intake in countries other than the\nUnited States, particularly Germany and Hungary (3,23,\n24). To our knowledge, estimates of total water intake for\nthree older adult age groups, including the oldest-old\n(85 years), from a national U.S. sample have not been\nreported.\nUsing a national sample of independent, community-\nliving older adults, we evaluated differences in total water\n85 years). The relative contributions of drinking water,\nbeverages, and food sources to total water intake were de-\ntermined for these older age groups. Differences in water\nintakes from beverages at meals versus beverages at snack\noccasions were also evaluated. Finally, the time of day that\nthe beverages were consumed and the major beverage\nsources of water for each age group were identified.\nTotal Water Intakes of Community-Living Middle-Old\nand Oldest-Old Adults\nClaire A. Zizza,1 Kathy Jo Ellison,2 and Catherine M. Wernette1\n1Department of Nutrition and Food Science and 2School of Nursing, Auburn University, Alabama.\nBackground. Literature reporting total daily water intake of community-dwelling older adults is limited. We evaluated\ndifferences in total water intake, water sources, water from meal and snack beverages, timing of beverage consumption,\nand beverage selection for three older age groups (young-old, 65\u00ad74 years; middle-old, 75\u00ad84 years; and oldest-old, 85\nyears).\nused for this study. Multivariate analyses controlling for age, sex, race\u00adethnicity, education, and marital status were con-\nducted to determine differences in water intake variables across the age groups.\nResults. Total water intakes found for the middle-old and oldest-old age groups were significantly lower than those\nfound for the young-old age group. The relative contributions of beverages to total water intake were 40.8%, 38.3%, and\n36.4% for the young-old, middle-old, and oldest-old, respectively. The water intakes from beverages consumed at snack\noccasions were significantly lower for the middle-old and oldest-old groups than those for the young-old group. All\ngroups consumed the greatest amount of water in the morning. Coffee was the predominant source of water from bever-\nages for all groups.\nConclusions. This study fills a gap in the literature by providing an analysis of the daily water intake of middle-old\nand oldest-old adults. We found that the total water intake for the middle-old and oldest-old was significantly lower than\nthat for the young-old. Future research needs to investigate the clinical outcomes associated with declining water intakes\nof community-dwelling older adults.\nKey Words: Fluid intake--Beverage consumption--Aging--Population.\nMethods\nData Set\nThe data source was the U.S. Federal Government's Na-\ntional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\nhealth, demographic, socioeconomic, and food and nutrient\ncomplex, multistage probability sample of the civilian, non-\ninstitutionalized population of the United States. Although\nindividuals of all ages were sampled, we selected those re-\ntime of their interview. Statistical weights were applied to\nmake the sample representative of the U.S. population.\nDietary Assessment\nwere collected for 1 day. Although the reliability of total\nwater intake measurements has not been reported, research-\ners have indicated that food intake data using a 1-day di-\netary recall are reliable measures of the usual intakes of\nenergy, macronutrients, and several micronutrients of popu-\nlation groups (25). Data were collected with the Automated\nMultiple-Pass Method, a five-step computer-assisted inter-\nview that has been validated with doubly labeled water and\ninvestigator-observed food intakes (26\u00ad28). Specific probes\nwere used to collect detailed information about each food\nand beverage item and the amount consumed. Respondents\nwere asked to report the time each food and beverage was\neaten and what they would call the eating occasion (e.g.,\nmeal vs snack) for that item. Following the 24-hour recall,\nrespondents were asked to estimate their plain drinking wa-\nter consumption during the previous 24-hour period.\nIn this analysis, total water intake is defined as the sum of\nthe amount of drinking water consumed and the amount of\nwater consumed from food and beverage sources (NHANES\ntotal nutrient intake file). The coding and nutrient calcula-\ntions of the 24-hour recall were detailed elsewhere (29, 30).\nTotal water intake is presented as grams, grams per kilo-\ngram body weight, and grams per 1,000 calories. Total wa-\nter intakes (g) were compared with the Adequate Intake\nwomen) (2).\nTo determine the contribution of water from food and\nbeverages, the NHANES individual foods file was used.\nThis file contains detailed information about the type and\namount of individual foods and beverages reported by each\nrespondent and the amount of water from these foods and\nbeverages. The United States Department of Agriculture\n(USDA) Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies\n1.0 was used to identify beverages in the individual foods\nfile (the specific USDA food codes are available from the\nauthors). The relative contributions of water (g) from bever-\nages, foods, and plain drinking water were calculated.\nThe specification of snack and meal occasions was de-\nscribed elsewhere (31). The individual foods file contains\nthe time each beverage was consumed. The relative contri-\nbution of beverages to water intake was calculated for four\ntime blocks in a 24-hour period: (i) midnight to 4:59 am, (ii)\nStatistical Software and Analysis\nData manipulation was conducted using SAS software\nNHANES are multistage, stratified area probability sam-\nples. To account for sample design and sampling weights,\nwe used STATA (Version 10; College Station, TX) to esti-\nmate descriptive and inferential statistics (32).\nLinear regression models controlling for gender, race\u00ad\nethnicity, education, and marital status were used to exam-\nine the association between age and total water intake and\nbetween age and water intake from beverages consumed at\nmeal and snack occasions.\nAge groups are defined as young-old (65\u00ad74 years),\nethnicity information included Mexican Americans, other\nHispanics, non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and\nother race. Because of the small sample sizes, Mexican\nAmericans and other Hispanics were combined to form\nHispanics, and the other race was combined with non-\nHispanic Whites. The level of education was defined as less\nthan a high school degree or greater than or equal to a high\nschool degree. The married group also included those who\nreported living with their partner. The single group included\nthose who were widowed, separated, or never married.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the characteristics of the study population.\nThe total water intake for both the middle-old (p < .001,\nfor g, g/kg, or g/1,000 kcal, respectively) was significantly\nlower than that for the young-old (Table 2). When compared\nyoung-old, middle-old, and oldest-old, respectively, met or\nexceeded their AI.\nThe relative contributions of beverages to total water in-\nmiddle-old, and oldest-old, respectively. The relative contri-\nbutions of plain drinking water to total water intake were\nmiddle-old, and oldest-old, respectively. Because we found\nan age-related decrease in the relative contribution of bever-\nages to total water intake, our subsequent analysis focused\non beverages.\nTable 3 shows the water intakes from beverages con-\nsumed during snack and meal occasions. Water intake from\nbeverages consumed at meal occasions did not differ sig-\nnificantly for the middle-old (p = .172) or the oldest-old\n(p = .057) compared with the young-old. However, the water\nintake from beverages consumed at snack occasions was\nsignificantly lower for both the middle-old (p < .001) and\nthe oldest-old (p < .001) compared with the young-old.\nWater intakes from beverages consumed during the\n24-hour period are presented in Table 4. We found similar\nconsumption patterns in the three age groups. All elderly\nconsumed the greatest amount of water early in the day\ncreased with the time of day: Less water was consumed in\nthe afternoon (1:00 pm to 6:59 pm) and still less in the eve-\nany group between midnight to 4:59 am.\nThe major beverage contributors to water intakes are pre-\nsented in Figure 1. Coffee was the predominant beverage\nsource of water for all three groups. Although soft drinks\nwere the second leading source of water for the young-old,\nmilk beverages were the second leading source for the\nmiddle-old and oldest-old. The third leading sources of water\nwere the milk beverages group, the soft drinks group, and\nthe tea group for the young-old, the middle-old, and the\noldest-old, respectively.\nDiscussion\nThis study fills a gap in the literature by defining the wa-\nter intakes of a nationally representative sample of middle-\nold and oldest-old adults. Results from this study indicate\nthat total water intakes appear to decrease with age. This\ndecrease is observed even when considering body weight\nand caloric intake. Contrary to our results, two smaller area-\nspecific studies found no differences in fluid intake between\nyounger and older adults (21,33). However, neither study\nincluded participants in the oldest-old age group. Compa-\nrable with our study, but using a representative sample of\nolder German adults, Volkert and colleagues (3) reported\nthat total daily water intake and daily beverage intake de-\ncreased with age and found that those 85 years or older had\nthe lowest water intakes. Using hydrogen-labeled water,\nRaman and colleagues (34) found that water from ingested\nfoods and beverages did not differ significantly among age\ngroups until the eighth decade of life.

AI is based on the intakes of healthy indi-\nviduals who appear to be adequately hydrated; however,\nindividuals can be adequately hydrated at lower or higher\nlevels. However, having so few study participants meeting\ntheir AI warrants further investigation.\nThe credibility of the \"8 \u00d7 8\" (eight 8 ounce glasses daily)\nwater recommendation has been questioned (36). No single\nmeasure completely discriminates between dehydrated and\nnondehydrated individuals (5). Lindeman and colleagues\n(20) suggested that eight glasses of liquid a day may be in-\nappropriate and actually may contribute to incontinence\nand/or water overload. More recently, Negoianu and Gold-\nfarb (1) questioned the validity of the commonly held belief\nthat adults should drink eight glasses of water per day. Over-\nall, there has been little research to measure the fluid intake\nof community-dwelling older adults, and fluid intake rec-\nommendations for all adults should be evidence based (19).\nThus, our aim was to provide a population-level assessment\nof water intake to assist in the development of evidence-\nbased fluid intake recommendations for older adults.\nThere were interesting differences between the water con-\ntributions of meal and snack beverages. The water intake from\nbeverages consumed as snacks decreased significantly as the\nage of the population increased. The role of snacking in a\nhealthful diet has been questioned (31). Our results suggest\nthat the consumption of beverages during snack occasions\nmay play an important role in maintaining fluid homeostasis.\nThere were also differences in the timing of beverage\nconsumption; most beverages were consumed in the morn-\ning, whereas few were consumed at night. This finding, and\nthat of De Castro, supports the claim that older adults may\ndeliberately avoid drinking in the evening in order to avoid\nnighttime incontinence (6,21).\nAlthough there has been a clear societal trend toward\nsoda consumption and away from milk consumption (37),\nwe found that milk beverages were the second leading\nsource of water for the middle-old and oldest-old and that\nsoft drinks were the second leading source of water for the\nyoung-old. Some have suggested that these differences may\nbe a cohort effect rather than an effect of aging (21). How-\never, this may be an actual behavior change associated with\naging. Jungjohann and colleagues (23) found that elderly\nmen drank significantly fewer soft drinks than the same\nmen did when they were younger. Researchers examining\ntotal diet quality have shown that dietary behaviors become\nmore health promoting as individuals age (38).\nCoffee and tea consumption were common in our study\npopulation. Many health professionals advise individuals to\navoid coffee and teas because they contain caffeine and re-\nlated methylxanthine compounds (39). It is commonly be-\nlieved that these beverages may trigger dehydration because\nof their diuretic effects (3). However, Maughan and Griffin\nTable 3.

Top contributors to water intake from beverages for each of the\nolder age groups. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nNutrient Database for Dietary Studies, 1.0.\n(39) found little evidence supporting this hypothesis. The\nauthors noted that little is known about the influence of age\nand gender on the diuretic effect of caffeine. However, rec-\nommendations for older adults to decrease caffeine con-\nsumption may be appropriate considering its other stimulant\neffects and the potential for drug interactions.\nOne drawback to this analysis is the use of only one\n24-hour dietary recall interview. Water intake may vary\nfrom day to day. In addition, underreporting issues can\nbe an issue with self-reported data such as a 24-hour\ndietary recall interview. In a study that examined under-\nreporting issues, the results obtained from 30-year-olds\nwere significantly different than those obtained from\nences were not found when comparisons were made be-\ntween the older three age groups (40). All our participants\nwere noninstitutionalized; however, there may be the\npossibility of cognitive impairment in these participants,\nand this would affect their ability to recall their diet.\nAnother drawback is that we were unable to control for\nenvironmental variables (geographical location, season-\nality) that could influence water intakes. The AI is for\nindividuals living in temperate climates; thus, we may\nhave misclassified individuals residing in warm climates.\nWith our analysis, we are unable to determine the clini-\ncal significance of the observed decrease in water intake.\nA review of literature in the dietary reference intakes\nreport suggests that increased total water intake may be\neffective therapy to prevent recurrent kidney stones, gall-\nstones, distal colon tumors, and bladder cancer (41).\nAn advantage of our study is that we used a nationally\nrepresentative sample that allows us to generalize to the\nU.S. population. Another advantage is that we were able to\nexamine adults 85 year or older. Finally, a 24-hour dietary\nrecall allowed us to describe behaviors affecting beverage\nintake such as timing and beverage selection, which are\nimportant considerations when trying to implement be-\nhavior change.\nOur results suggest that water intakes, particularly the\ncontribution from beverages, appear to decline with age.\nFuture research needs to investigate the clinical outcomes\nassociated with declining water intakes of community-\ndwelling older adults. Identifying the associations between\nwater intakes and clinical outcomes will also assist in evalu-\nating and determining evidence-based water intake recom-\nmendations for older adults.\nFunding\nThis study was supported in part by funds from the Alabama Agricul-\n"
