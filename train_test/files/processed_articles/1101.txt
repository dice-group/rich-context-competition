Macroeco-\nnomic trends affecting employment, job quality, and incomes drove most of the coverage\nchanges, although key factors varied during the two periods. Take-up rates affected cover-\nage, mostly reflecting the interaction of premium cost trends and labor-market tightness,\nbut take-up also was influenced by the implementation of the State Children's Health Insur-\nance Program (SCHIP) during 1997\u00ad2001.

The first period was\ncharacterized by robust economic growth and\nmodest growth in health care premiums; the\nsecond period, by a short but sharp recession\nin 2001 and a slow recovery along with double-\ndigit annual premium increases. Comparing the\nfactors driving changes in employer coverage\nduring these two periods provides insights into\nthe underlying dynamics of employer coverage.\nStudy Data And Methods\nn Data source. Our analysis used the\nCommunity Tracking Study (CTS) Household\nSurvey, a large, representative telephone sur-\nvey of the civilian population in the contigu-\nous forty-eight states that covers a broad array\nof health-related topics. We used Rounds One,\nThree, and Four of the survey, conducted in\nsponse rates ranged from 59 percent to 65 per-\ncent. For simplicity, we refer to the periods de-\nfined by the three surveys as covering 1997\u00ad\nweights, and standard errors account for com-\nplex survey design. Our unit of analysis was\nnonelderly people, providing sample sizes for\nn Analysis. We used a shift-share analysis\nto decompose changes in the coverage rate\nover time into structural components. We\nspecified an equation explaining the coverage\nrate as a function of nine factors and then as-\nsessed the contribution of each factor to rate\nchanges by, in essence, comparing actual cov-\nerage rates with those calculated to have oc-\ncurred had each factor been individually held\nconstant at its prior time-period value.5\nn Components of coverage. Employment,\noffer, eligibility, and take-up. As in most previous\nshift-share analyses of employer coverage\nrates, we investigated the role of employment\nrates and conditional offer, employer coverage\neligibility, and take-up rates (the product of\nwhich equals the job-based coverage rate).6 Be-\ncause the option of family coverage is virtually\nubiquitous, provided to 99 percent of all\nworkers offered coverage in 2005, employ-\nment, offers, and eligibility are all defined in a\nfamily context.7 For instance, if one family adult\nhas an employer coverage offer, all family mem-\nbers are assumed to have access to the offer.\nTo better characterize how employment af-\nfects access to employer coverage, we charac-\nterized family employment not as simple rate,\nbut in terms of the percentage of the population\nin families with two full-time workers, one full-\ntime worker, or part-time workers only.\nJob quality. We extended the previous shift-\nshare analyses of employer coverage by adding\nseveral additional components. We investi-\ngated the hypothesized structural employ-\nment changes toward jobs that are less likely\nto provide health benefits: those in smaller\nfirms, in certain industries, and with lower\nwages. We combined these various dimen-\nsions into a \"job-quality\" scale. Adding job\nquality (conditioned on family employment)\nallowed us to assess whether any changes in\noffer, eligibility, or take-up rates are attribut-\nable to firms' altering their benefit policies as\nopposed to changes in the mix of jobs in the\nU.S. economy toward or away from those his-\ntorically likely to provide any health benefits\nor health benefits of greater or lesser generos-\nity. To create the job-quality scale, we used a\nsample of full-time workers from all four\ngressed the likelihood that their job carried\nhealth benefits on interactions between six\nemployer-size variables, fourteen industry and\ngovernment categories, and four wage catego-\nries. Predicted values were then divided into\neight equal-size groups and assigned to work-\ning families. In families with multiple workers,\nthe best-quality job is assigned.8\nFamilyincomeandSCHIPeligibility. We also in-\ncluded two components that are related to the\nlikelihood of taking up employer coverage; this\nallowed us to better isolate the role of insur-\nance costs on take-up. We accounted for\nchanges over time in the distribution of family\nincomes among those with access to job-based\ncoverage. Because we already controlled for\nfamily employment and job quality, changes in\nthe distribution of family incomes (expressed\nT r e n d s\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 5 , N u m b e r 3 7 7 5\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Consequently, the final two compo-\nnents represent shifts in the coverage rates of\nthese two groups.\nAltogether, we examined nine components:\nfamily employment; quality of best job in the\nfamily; insurance offer rate; insurance eligibil-\nity rate; family income; SCHIP eligibility rate;\ntake-up rate; coverage rate among people in\nnonworking families; and coverage rate among\npeople in self-employed families.

Shifts in job quality had siz-\nable effects on coverage rates. However, rather\nthan the secular decline in job quality that\nsome have posited, job quality appears to re-\nflect business cycles.12 During the period of\neconomic growth in the late 1990s, job quality\nimproved (Exhibit 1), translating into a gain of\nerage. However, average job quality fell dra-\nwith a decline of 2.8 million people with job-\nbased coverage. The effect of declining job\neven greater had we used the simplified em-\nployment variable, which suggests that it was\noften the best-quality job in families that was\nlost.\nn Offer and eligibility rates. After job\nquality is controlled for, rising offer rates dur-\ners with employment-based coverage by about\nSomewhat surprisingly, eligibility rates in-\ncreased during both periods, resulting in in-\ncoverage. Had we not controlled for shifts in\njob quality, a greater portion of the change in\ncoverage would have been attributed to offer\nand eligibility rates.\nn Income, crowd-out, and take-up. Not\nonly did the number of people with access to\nemployer coverage increase during the period\nof economic growth in the late 1990s, but\namong those with access to employer insur-\nance, incomes rose. Even after family work-\nforce participation and job quality are con-\ntrolled for, higher real incomes resulted in 1.1\nmillion people taking up employer coverage\nGrowth in public insurance eligibility for\nchanged little, and their effect on coverage\nrates was negligible. After allowing for family\nincomes and the effect of the SCHIP imple-\nmentation, we saw take-up rates as increasing\nemployer coverage over the earlier period by\ncoverage over the later period by about 1.5 mil-\nlion. The sizable drop in take-up during the\nlater period is consistent with sharp increases\nin employee premium cost sharing (particu-\nlarly for family coverage) and in consumer cost\nsharing for health care services.13\nThe contribution of higher take-up rates on\nlarger had we not accounted for gains in job\nquality, which indicates that higher-quality\njobs provide more-attractive insurance bene-\nfits. Similarly, higher family incomes during\nthis period promoted take-up of insurance of-\nfers, both directly and by making fewer chil-\ndren eligible for public coverage. Had we ac-\ncounted for neither family income nor SCHIP\neligibility, take-up in the earlier period would\nhave been shown as modestly suppressing em-\nployer coverage, consistent with the modest\nincreases in insurance costs. In contrast, con-\ntrolling for income levels or public insurance\neligibility had negligible impacts on the take-\nup effects in the later period.\nn Employer coverage among nonwork-\ning families. Consistent with the patterns ev-\nident in Exhibit 1, more than a third of the in-\nis attributable to an increase in the percentage\nof people in nonworking families with job-\nbased coverage.

As a result, had we de-\nfined the groups based on current income, we\ncould not have distinguished the underlying\nreasons for changes in coverage from changes\nin the composition of the subpopulations we\nwere investigating. Therefore, we defined our\ngroups based on predicted (or \"permanent\")\nfamily incomes, based on a model in which\nfamily income was regressed on \"human capi-\ntal\" variables: age, race, sex, family composi-\ntion, education, and health status.

This is not surprising,\nsince the take-up rate among higher-income\npeople was already well above 90 percent. Yet\ncoverage rates among low-income people fell\nbecause of lower take-up, after income is con-\ntrolled for.\nEffects of cost sharing and take-up. Although in-\ncreases in average worker contributions to\npremiums and cost sharing for health care ser-\nwage workers were most affected.15 During the\nlater period, all income groups lost coverage\nbecause of lower take-up, with the greatest ef-\nfect among middle-income people, accounting\nfor more than one percentage point of their\n5.8-percentage-point decline in coverage. Even\namong high-income people, lower take-up ac-\ncounted for 0.4 points of their 1.3-percentage-\npoint decline in coverage.\nSummary And Discussion\nn Business cycles and other drivers of\nchange. Many interrelated factors influence\nemployer-sponsored health insurance rates.\nForemost, business cycles are important driv-\ners of short-term trends in employer coverage.\nThese operate primarily through workforce\nparticipation but secondarily through the av-\nerage quality of jobs and family incomes.\nHigher-quality jobs are more likely to provide\nboth access to employer-sponsored coverage\nand conditions that encourage insurance take-\nup: higher wages, lower employee cost sharing,\nand more generous plan benefits.\n2001, the gain in employer coverage was mod-\nerated by dramatic expansions in public insur-\nance eligibility for children as a result of\nSCHIP. Although crowding out can occur\nthrough other, less direct mechanisms, the ef-\nfect on take-up is likely to be the most impor-\ntant component. Yet the estimated loss of cov-\nis quite modest compared with the 3.7 million\nchildren enrolled in SCHIP and Medicaid ex-\nAfter workforce participation, job quality,\nfamily incomes, and SCHIP eligibility are con-\ntrolled for, we would expect take-up rates to\nfollow trends in health insurance premiums\nand benefit packages. Indeed, we found a\ntion of double-digit premium increases were\nshifted to workers in the form of greater pre-\nmium cost sharing and benefit buy-downs. Al-\nthough premiums grew at a modest rate dur-\ning the late 1990s, we found that take-up\nincreased. This suggests that benefit packages\nand hence take-up are influenced by the inter-\naction of both underlying costs and the tight-\nness of the labor market.\nLower- and middle-income workers are\nmost susceptible to business cycles.

They alone lost cover-\nage because of lower take-up during the late\nn Future trends. What do the results por-\ntend for the future? Although the improving\neconomy foreshadows gains in the number of\npeople with employer-sponsored insurance,\nthe recent Census Bureau numbers suggest\nthat other forces could continue to weaken the\nemployer coverage system over the long term.\nMost important and well established is that\nhealth care costs grow faster than wages, a\ntrend largely driven by improvements in\nhealth care technology.17 Although this trend\nbriefly reversed itself in the mid-1990s at the\nheight of managed care's influence, there are\nfew technical, market, or policy tools on the\nhorizon likely to reverse it anytime soon.18 In-\ncreasing health care costs will likely continue\nto depress take-up rates and, for firms that\nemploy mostly low-wage workers, perhaps of-\nfer and eligibility rates as well. Although\nhigher-wage workers are likely to see the effect\nin the form of lower wages and less generous\nhealth benefits, low-income workers are the\nmost likely to lose employer-sponsored cover-\nage altogether.\nThe second long-term trend concerns the\ndecline in job quality. Whether or not such a\ndecline actually exists is in dispute.19 Although\nour research suggests that job quality is an im-\nportant driver of employer coverage, we also\nfound that coverage is responsive to business\ncycles. Our data series, which covers a single\nbusiness cycle, is too short to establish\nwhether a long-term trend exists.\nFinally, the strong association between\nmacroeconomic trends and employer coverage\nsuggests that publicly sponsored health insur-\nance programs have an important countercy-\nclical role. Most of the decline in employer\nincreases in public coverage through a combi-\nnation of automatic stabilizers (job loss makes\nsome eligible) and policy changes.20 Policy-\nmakers should keep this in mind as they grap-\nple with Medicaid and SCHIP's severe budget-\nary strains.\nTheauthorsaregratefultotheRobertWoodJohnson\nFoundationforfinancialsupport.Theyalsothank\nEllenSingerandValeriyBakaushinofSocialandSci-\nentificSystemsforexcellentprogrammingassistance;\nJonGabelforhelpfulcommentsonanearlierdraft;and\nHeidiWhitmoreforgeneratingatabulationfromthe\nHenryJ.KaiserFoundation/HealthResearchandEdu-\ncationalTrustannualemployersurvey.\nNOTES\n1.
