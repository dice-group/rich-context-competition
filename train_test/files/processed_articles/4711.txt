    "abstract": "Abstract\nBy analyzing the differences between the corporate and public governance, theoretical and empirical research seems to\nindicate that the two domains of governance are far too different to share any common aspect. However, in this particular\nresearch, it has been argued that public governance is an application of corporate governance. Thus, the research question\nentails the description and analysis of this possible convergence of the two. Extensive research from literature on corporate\ngovernance has been undertaken to establish a relationship between the boards process and the roles that acts as a framework\nto bridge the gap separating corporate governance from public governance. Corporate governance, at a global level, exists in\nthe for-profit as well as nonprofit organizations. Thus, the definition of this concept needs to be viewed from \"an innovative\"\neye, considering the relationship between the process of the board and roles as characteristic of the public organization\nand private ones. As the private as well as public organizations are an application of corporate governance, the difference\nbetween the two gets narrowed. For the purpose of this research, the case of the French hospitals' board has been taken\ninto consideration. The members of the public board have been considered for the board process to perform their roles.\n",

By introducing a change in the ruling board, the\nreforms have instigated a debate among the physicians,\npatients, and authorities.\nIndustry in France has been the main reason for choosing\nthis industry for the purpose of this research. The recent French\nArticle L6143-8) requires public hospitals to substitute the\nunitary system (the board of directors) with the dual one (the\nsupervisory and the management boards) under the aegis of\nthe reform known as \"Loi, Hopital, Sant\u00e9, Patients, Territoire\"\n(The HSPT). This change in the structure of governance is\none of the most important reforms in the history of the French\nhospital governance structure change. Until recently, the gov-\nernance of organizations (public and private) in France has\nbeen predominantly characterized by the unitary board sys-\ntem.As the private firms have benefited from the option of the\nthe \"droit des societies\" (the Companies Law) in 1966, the\nFrench legislator is keen on adopting the dual system for the\npublic hospital board, as well. According to the health care\nauthorities, by changing the governance system, the public\nhospitals would be able to achieve the desired performance\nobjectives. The main point is that the supervisory board (SUB\nhereinafter) and the management board (MGB/Mgt. hereinaf-\nter) constitute the basis of the hospital governance reforms. As\nfar as the SUB is concerned, some observers of the French\nhospitals' governance say that the decision-making power, as\ndetermined by the law, seems to be in favor of the MGB and\nprecisely the director. It is felt that the role of SUB is being\nundermined as the government wants the director to be the\nhighest ruling authority within the French public hospital.\n1IRGO University Bordeaux 4, France\nCorresponding Author:\nRadhoine Laouer, P\u00f4le Universitaire de Sciences de Gestion, IRGO\nEmail: radhoine.laouer@u-bordeaux4.fr\nConvergence of Corporate and Public\nGovernance: Insights From Board Process\nView\nG\u00e9rard Hirigoyen1 and Radhoine Laouer1\n Keywords\ncorporate governance, public organization, nonprofit organization, board process\n2 SAGE Open\nIn the light of this French public hospital topicality, the\nresearch aims to establish that the board process can create a\nconvergence between public and private governance. The\nresearch first describes the theoretical background for this\nconvergence, and then offers the board making process as a\npractical suitable alternative.\nTheoretical Background\nThe Nonprofit and the Public Governance as \"an\nApplication\" of Corporate Governance\nIn the first stage, the public sector is considered as a set of\nproduction units including firms, programs, agencies, and\ndepartments such as the social security administration,\nrailways, national health care, education, and national\ndefense. Each unit is supposed to use a limited number of\nresources within a particular institutional and geographical\nsetting and produce a number of outputs, quantitative and\nqualitative. Those outputs are related to the objectives that\nhave been assigned to the production unit by the principal,\nthe authority in charge, that is, the government. However,\nprivate-sector organizations are entities that operate on a\nfor-profit basis and include the private industry or com-\nmercial sector units like the large- and medium-sized phar-\nmaceutical companies, small firms, and biotechnology\nstart-ups.\nCorporate governance refers to the mechanism by which\nthe owner of the corporation governs and regulates the activ-\nities of the managers. Another way to understand the concept\nof corporate governance is the manner in which the suppliers\nof finance to corporations assure the flow of a return on their\ninvestment. This conceptualization remains valid for the\npublic as well as the private sectors. Even though this defini-\ntion of corporate governance concurs with the objective of\nthe private sector, it is equally valid for the public organiza-\ntions. In the public sector, the suppliers of finance are the tax\npayers who assure a safe return in the form of services of the\npublic administration.\nGortner, Nicols, and Ball (2006) argued that \"Thus, far\nwe've addressed the differences between public sector, non-\nprofit organizations and the for-profit organizations. This is\nthe key to understanding organization theory from the public\nand non-profit organization's perspective\" (p. 44). This cita-\ntion is in concordance with the Figure 1 that implies that when\nauthors conduct research on the nonprofit organization gover-\nnance, they generally evoke the cases of the public and the\nprivate sectors simultaneously. However, researchers deal\nwith the private sector when they take an interest in the for-\nprofit organization governance. Thus, this categorization high-\nlights a kind of \"governance profiling,\" and the classification\nof organizations as public, nonprofit, or private, in which each\ncategory is supposed to adopt a specific governance model.\nAgain, researchers define corporate governance in rela-\nstates that \"the word `Corporate' in Corporate Governance is\nno longer restricted to Non-profit and For-profit\nOrganizations,\" that is, the corporations, he defends\n\"Corporate Governance as confined to non-profit\nGovernance.\" This necessitates the assessment of corporate\ngovernance at a global perspective. Moreover, this change in\nthe interpretation of the term Corporate, transforms the\nimportance of the concept as a theory, as it considers all the\npossible spheres of an organization. In fact, the passing from\nthe for-profit arena to the nonprofit or public one underlines\nthe prevalence of corporate governance as a theory. Following\nthe definition of the term \"application\" given by the Oxford\nDictionary (4th edition, p. 47), as the \"Act of putting a the-\nory, discovery, etc. to practical use,\" the corporate gover-\nnance that emanates from corporation studies or practices\ncan also be applied to any organization. Thus, with some pre-\ncautions, corporate governance can be identified as a theory\nthat embraces the nonprofit as well as the for-profit\norganizations.\nThese precautions are not inferred from the theory, but,\ndepend on the specific characteristics of each organization\nfound in Figure 1. The first precaution may be defined in\nterms of conceptualization: For example, authors analyze the\ngovernance of nonprofit or/and for-profit organizations in\nthe light of the stakeholders, which forms an important\nbranch of corporate governance. They specify that each orga-\nnization has its stakeholders and with a small distinction of\nshareholders as \"a denomination\" of those who try to defend\ntheir own interests on behalf of the owners of the firm, as a\nfor-profit organization.\nThe second precaution may be defined in terms of impli-\ncations such as problems; as given by Glaeser (2002), \"the\nnon-profit organizations have governance problems that\nresemble the problems faced by for-profit firms, but are often\nmore extreme\" (p. 54).\nFigure 1. The possible spheres of the corporate governance.\nHirigoyen and Laouer 3\nThe third precaution relates to safeguarding the interests\nof the stakeholders as the statute of the organization is\nchanged, for instance, transforming the organization from a\npublic entity to a private one (privatization). According to\nthe stakeholder's approach, this may increase, decrease, or\neven change the nature of the stakeholders, without changing\ntheir ultimate goal, which is defending their own interests.\nIn addition, in terms of the adoption of corporate gover-\nnance insights by the nonprofit organizations, Alexander and\nWeiner (1998) tried to determine the required conditions\nwithin the nonprofit hospital industry. Likewise, Alexander,\nYoung, Weiner, and Herald (2008) have studied the possibil-\nity of applying the Sarbanes\u00adOxley Committee's firm gover-\nnance codes to the same industry. According to the\ncommittee's codes, private companies listed in the United\nStates and their directors have to obey various norms relating\nto disclosure and internal control, subject to significant pen-\nalties, including imprisonment. As it is applicable to all pub-\nlic-listed companies, U.S. companies and non-U.S.-listed\ncompanies in the United States, these companies are now\nrequired to submit an annual report of the internal accounting\ncontrols to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe authors recognize that\nAlthough Sarbanes-Oxley does not apply to non-profit\ncorporations, the legislation has been an impetus to policy\nmakers to consider whether non-profit should be subject to\nsimilar types of governance requirements, as a number of these\norganizations have also been involved in widely publicized\nscandals. (Alexander, Young, Weiner, & Herald, 2008, pp.\nThis reasoning further establishes that the overlapping and\nthe distinguishing zones between nonprofit and for-profit are-\nnas, even with governance theories, other than the stakehold-\ners' theory, point toward the application of corporate\ngovernance to the for-profit as well as the nonprofit organiza-\ntions. The corporatization of an organization is the adoption\nof those assumptions, and therefore, it is different from the\nconcept of privatization, in the sense that organizations may\ncorporatize their governance mechanisms without privatiza-\ntion (Aivazian, Ge, & Qiu, 2005). Consequently, this research\non corporate governance proposes to study different mecha-\nnisms that are applicable to nonprofit as well as for-profit\norganizations. Moreover, when authors have to classify these\nmechanisms, they choose the organization as a frontier\nbetween external mechanisms (the market, law and economy)\nand internal mechanisms (the board, committees and manage-\nrial incentives). Given that this research article does not pro-\npose to analyze all of these mechanisms and/or their\nefficiencies or inefficiencies (Walsh & Seward, 1990), it is\nherein suggested to emphasize the possibility of applying\nsome of the corporate governance insights from the private\nsector to the public organization's board. It can be argued that\nthe public and the private governance can interchange\nbetween them some of the mechanisms of governance. In this\nsense, Benz and Frey (2007) contended that the firm's gover-\nnance can learn and gain from the public governance and vice\nversa. Indeed, the two authors encourage the private field,\nunder the scandals--which infected earlier its Governance--\nto adopt some lessons from the public domain in terms of\n\"manager compensation,\" \"the division of power within\nfirms,\" \"rules of succession in top positions,\" and \"institu-\ntionalized competition in core areas of the corporation.\"\nThis research first deals with some specificities of public\ngovernance concerning the board of directors. Then, the\nresearch evokes how the board process, as described by the\ncorporate governance literature, influences the performance\nof the public board by analyzing the functioning of the\nFrench Hospital Board.\nIn What Ways Is the Public Board Specific?\nThe term \"governance,\" in the public sphere, has been empha-\nsized through the doctrine of \"New Public Management\"\n(NPM), with Hood (1991) stating that \"it is the result of the\nmarriage between the Neo-Institutional Economic approaches\n(public choice, transactions cost and principal-agent theories)\nand the Managerialism perspective\" (p. 6). According to\nKickert (1997) \"The Public Management should be broad-\nened into Public Governance\" (p. 732). This implies that the\nNPM and the governance theory in general, share some of the\ninstitutional, economic, and theoretical roots such as the\nTransactions'Cost Theory and the agency theory. While those\ntheories are an emanation of corporate governance, they seem\nto constitute the basis of the nonprofit governance as well. In\nfact, Cornforth (2006) remarked that the nonprofit and public\ngovernance are \"relatively under-theorised\" and enunciates a\npanel of corporate governance theories likely to explain some\naspects of the nonprofit and public boards (p. 6). Besides, in\ntheir work, Stone and Ostrower (2007) argued that the\nNonprofit governance and public governance are \"fluid and\noverlapping,\" and the breakable limits between the two\nspheres get manifested by the fact that the governance litera-\ntures of both firms are almost the same, and drawn from the\nfor-profit governance research. Thus, the corporate gover-\nnance research has a certain theoretical leg up as compared\nwith the nonprofit and public governance ones. And, if Benz\nand Frey (2007) stated that the corporate governance may\n\"learn from Public Governance,\" this means otherwise that\nthe \"lessons\" are about the governance practices and not the\ngovernance theories (p. 92). These practices constitute the\nspecificities of public governance. The same authors defend\nthe idea of the existence of some differences between corpo-\nrate and public governance, in terms of \"manager compensa-\ntion, the division of power within firms, rules of succession in\ntop positions and institutionalized competition in core areas\nof Governance.\" In addition, the board of directors can be\ntaken as a mechanism of governance to look for a certain con-\nvergence between corporate and public governance. As\nresearchers have already explored the effectiveness of the\n4 SAGE Open\nboard of directors of the for-profit organizations, the non-\nprofit domain seems to be fertile to lead an investigation\nabout the decision process within it. Thus, the nonprofit orga-\nnizations in Europe adopt the dual system of management\nand supervisory boards, unlike the prevalence of the Unitary\nBoard system in the for-profit organizations, leading to the\nconsideration of the case of the French public hospital, and\nthe possibility of the adoption of the dual system in the for-\nprofit as well as the nonprofit organizations.\nThe board's demography acts as the input in the input-\nprocess-output Model emphasizing the relationship between\nthe characteristics of the incumbents of the board and the\nperformance and efficiency of the organization. This particu-\nlar research adds another dimension by establishing the rela-\ntionship between the board's demography and board's\nprocess, as well as that between the board's process and\nboard's performance.\nThe Public Organization's Board Demography\nGenerally, matters relating to the board like that of the deter-\nmination and change of tenure, the size, and the colleges of\nthe public board are always defined by the law. However, the\nsubject of the research on board governance analyzes the\ndemography of the board as follows.\nThe board size. As has been stated above, the law determines\nthe different components of the supervisory board. The size\nof the board is determined according to the number and size\nof colleges that compose the supervisory board of the French\npublic hospital. The three colleges are (a) at most five repre-\nsentatives of the territorial authority, (b) at most five repre-\nsentatives of the medical and nonmedical staff, and (c) at\nmost five qualified personalities, including two representa-\ntives of the patients. As put by the law, the number of the\nSUB members logically should not exceed 15. Prior to the\nreforms, the number of the board of directors permitted by\nthe law was 30. All things held constant, the size of the SUB\ncan affect the extent of deliberation on the decision, as a\nhigher number of members in the SUB implies that it will be\nmore difficult to arrive at a consensus.Assuming that the size\nof the Board is another side of the board composition, Zahra\nand Pearce (1989) proposed to incorporate the board size\nwithin the board composition. This Board size will not be\nevoked, later during the course of this research, when the\nFrench public hospital's SUB composition is described.\nThe board composition.Almost all academic researchers\nhave approximately a similar description of the board com-\nposition, an important part of the board's demography.\nAccording to them, the duality outsiders/insiders distinguish\nbetween individuals who operate the strategic Apex of the\norganization (the insiders) and those who do not (the outsid-\ners; Huse, 2007). With regard to this distinction, the French\npublic hospital SUB is composed mostly by outsiders. This\nis normally related to the nature of the SUB, unlike the\nMGB, which is constituted completely by the insiders.\nTherefore, compared with the proposed composition of the\nboard of directors, there is a quasi-separation between the\ninsiders and the outsiders. Thus, the question is about the\neffect of this isolation on the decision-making process of the\noutsiders (i.e., the SUB). Does this autonomy from the\ninsiders insure the requisite performance of roles by the\nmembers of the SUB?\nThe board diversity.The third demography--the \"board\ndiversity\"--implies the presence of diverse skills and knowl-\nedge within the Board (Forbes & Milliken, 1999). The\nFrench public hospital SUB is composed of qualified person-\nalities having competencies in several domains (law, finance,\nmanagement, and accounting). It has also added representa-\ntives of patients with expert knowledge in social matters.\nThen, there is the trade union with field-experience of the\nactual work conditions. Again, the presence of physician's\nrepresentative within those trade unions manifests a posses-\nsion of skills in terms of functioning of the hospital's internal\nprocess. For instance, the public university hospital, a public\nhospital, has the dean of the university as a member of the\nSUB, who has full knowledge about the state of medical\nresearch. Consequently, the presence of this diverse mosaic\nof knowledge and skills is imperative for the apt performance\nof roles of the French public hospital's SUB.\nThe three factors of board size, board composition, and\nboard diversity make up the demography of the public\norganizations. As this research assumes the effect of\ndemography on the board process and the similar relation\nbetween the board process and the board performance, it\nbecomes imperative to understand the board performance\nthrough its roles.\nThe Public Organization's Board Roles\nAccording to the literature review of Hinna, Nito, and\nMangia (2010) concerning the public organization board, the\nmembers of the board have a few governing roles that vary\nwith the corporate governance theories (see Table 1).\nWithin the context of the French public hospital, several\nroles are supposed to be played by the SUB. As this article\nconstitutes almost the first contribution after the reforms, the\nresearch has been based on the French health care code for\nthe purpose of defining and describing the SUB tasks and\nroles. Therefore, the only basis to answer the question about\nthe public and nonprofit organizations' boards--\"What does\nthe Board do?\"(Cornforth, 2006)--lies with the law.\nHowever, as stated above, this source does not clearly clas-\nsify the different roles of the SUB. Such clarification is sup-\nposed necessary according to the board's behavior process,\nto appreciate how the members of the SUB contribute to the\ncreation of value. In fact, the multitheory approach (Macus,\n2008) explains the variety of roles as shown in Table 1.\nHirigoyen and Laouer 5\nHowever, the common roles of the board cited in the theo-\nretical researches (Forbes & Milliken, 1999; Huat & Tai Wai,\nvice, and control roles.\nThe strategy public board role. This part of the research estab-\nlishes the scope of the strategic arena for the public boards.\nIn fact, the term strategy emanates from the extent of respon-\nsibility of the MGB, across a wide array of analysis and deci-\nsions from the financial documents like the \"Projected State\nof the Incomes and Expenses,\" Annual Activity Report, to\nthe planning, deliberating, and framing of the medical and\nsocial projects. Therefore, the responsibility of the strategy\ndecision process has to be shared by both of the organs, the\nMGB and the SUB, where the latter plays the role of discuss-\ning and analyzing the plans.\nThe service public board role. The SUB is required to offer its\nconsultation and opinion on documents like the quality\nimprovement policy, reception patients' condition, land pol-\nicy, internal policies, and procedures prepared by the MGB.\nSimilarly, the board governance literature indicates that the\nboard service role includes the advice given by the board of\ndirectors to the CEO (chief executive officer). In fact, Douma\n(1997), the SUB, with an outsider's vision, is supposed to\nhave a lesser involvement in the running of the organization\nas compared with the MGB, which is more concerned about\nthe day-to-day operations. This underlines the paramount\nimportance of assigning an autonomous service role to the\npublic board; wherein the SUB creates value by offering its\nindependent advice and consultancy.\nThe control public board role. As laid down by the law, while\nrealizing the board strategy role, the SUB controls the\nactual execution of plans to be implemented by the MGB.\nAnd, if necessary, the SUB's members can also nominate\nan auditor to check whether the MGB is carrying on the\nHospital's strategy according to the terms stipulated by the\nSUB. In fact, his task probably is the most important one.\nThe corporate governance theories intervention lets the\nstakeholders of the hospital empowers the SUB to play the\nrole of the principal toward the MGB that is considered as\nthe agent, according to the agency theory (Fama & Jensen,\n1983) and the stakeholder-agency theory (Hill & Jones,\nAs is evident, the literature on the relationship between\nboard demography or its characteristics and the board roles\nof the public Board shows some ambiguity. This research\nbanks on recent works in corporate governance, relating to\nthe behavior of the board, arguing that the board process can\nbring some ideas to the public board, therein redefining the\nrelationship between the board demography and the roles\nperformance.\nThe research further moves to the assessment of a possible\nconvergence between the corporate and public governance.\nAre Some of the Corporate Governance Insights\nApplicable in the Public Arena?\nAs has been shown, the French hospital SUB demography\nand roles can be described similarly as is done in the private\nsector. However, while the public services were considered\nas an image of the bureaucratic regime, the emergence of the\nnew public governance is supposed to bring a new vision of\nthe public organization policy (Hood, 1991).\nTable 1.

Adapted and Adopted from Hinna, Nito, and Mangia (2010, p. 143).\nNote. SUB = supervisory board; MGB = Management Board.\n6 SAGE Open\nIn fact, the agency theory with its roots in economic theo-\nries acted as the foundation of the disciplinary board gover-\nnance approach. This was subsequently influenced by the\nbehavioral side of the board. The elites within the governing\nboard would eventually substitute performance with confor-\nmance (Figure 2), under the aegis of value creation (Huse,\nHambrick, Werder, and Zajac (2008) dealt with \"New\nDirections in Corporate Governance Research\" among oth-\ners with the behavioral process within the board of directors.\nThis matter constitutes a serious pathway of research to\ncounter the ambiguity about the relationship between board\ncharacteristics and the organization's performance. In fact,\nEldenburg, Hermalin, Weisbach, and Wosinska (2004) found\na little evidence about this relationship within the nonprofit\nhospital industry.\nThe board process issue is inspired from the group social\npsychology approach and precisely the input-process-output\nmodel (McGrath, 1964). In the particular research, the group\ntaken into consideration is the SUB. The inputs are its char-\nacteristics (composition and diversity), while the output is\nthe performance of its roles, and the process is \"the decision-\nmaking related activities and styles of the board\" (Zahra &\nWhy does the decision-making process matter, given that\nthe public board members do not expect any material com-\npensation compared with their for-profit counterparts? The\nanswer to this question lies in the link between the Public\nHospital SUB's characteristics and its roles via certain\npropositions.\nIn fact, to apprehend this board process clearly, Forbes\nand Milliken (1999) classified it into three main parts,\nnamely (a) the use of skills and knowledge, (b) the cognitive\nconflict, and (c) the effort norms.\nThe use of knowledge and skills.The public hospital's SUB\ncomprises of qualified personalities and other experts in sev-\neral domains such as medicine, medical research, social\naffairs, political matters, and hospital management. These\nexperts, coming from varied backgrounds, apply their knowl-\nedge and skills to the tasks of strategy, service, and control.\nIn fact, the medical and nonmedical staff representatives can\nratify the medical and social projects based on their social\nand medical affairs' expertise. Other qualified personalities\ncan use their managerial competencies to approve the pro-\njected state of incomes and expenses. Moreover, the capital\nof those skills and knowledge should be utilized to ensure the\nfulfillment of the roles of control and service. The favorable\naspect is that the Law also allows the SUB members' experts\nto criticize and give their opinions about the orientations of\nthe MGB. Thus,\nProposition 1: The research affirms that skills and knowl-\nedge are present within the public hospital SUB and, if\nused effectively, can perform the three roles of strategy,\nservice, and control.\nThe effort norms. Wageman (1995; as cited in Forbes & Mil-\nliken, 1999) argued that \"Effort norms are a group-level\nconstruct that refer to the group's shared beliefs regarding\nthe level of effort everyone is expected to put towards a\ntask\" (p. 493). These norms are shared expectations about\nhow the members of a group ought to behave (Levin &\nMoreland, 1990). This element plays the role of the catalyst,\nin the sense that the board should be accomplished by the\ndirection of the hospital and the members of the board them-\nselves. This well-laid direction of the hospital should ensure\nthe best conditions before, during, and after the course meet-\nings. In reality, the effort norms can be manifested by the\npreparations like sending the required documents to the\nboard members before the meetings, framing an effective\nagenda, and training members in matters of governance.\nFrom the point of view of the members, there should be a\ncertain level of vigilance on the preparation of elements to\nbe discussed, members should consecrate with ample time\nassigned to do it and participate actively during the gather-\nings. By doing this, the SUB members and hospital's direc-\ntions provide a favorable environment to ensure that the\nmeetings go on smoothly. Then,\nProposition 2: Enhancing effort norms by the SUB and\nthe Hospital direction provide favorable conditions to\nperform the service, strategy, and control roles.\nBehavioral Approaches\nDisciplinary Approaches\nActive Proactive\nAdoptative Reactive\nValue Creation\nBoard Approaches\nConformance Performance\nFigure 2. The public board governance: Passing from disciplinary to behavior approach of the board.\nHirigoyen and Laouer 7\nThe cognitive conflict.According to Forbes and Milliken\n(1999) the cognitive conflict \"refers to task-oriented differ-\nences in judgment among group members\" (p. 494). In fact,\nthe diversity that characterizes the public hospital SUB may\nopen a dialog between ideas about the eventual strategic ori-\nentations. As experts discuss and debate conflicting ideas,\nthe alternatives discussed among the different representa-\ntives are insured within a kind of \"positive\" interaction.\nTherefore, \"the brewing\" of ideas enhances the debate about\ncritical issues. In a way, the SUB members prove a capability\nto review all management orientations with some hindsight.\nThey can advise, monitor, and ratify decisions of the MGB,\nbased on their dynamism. Given that they are supposed to be\nacting separately from the Hospital's managers, this avoids\nthe rubber stamp role of MGB's management decisions.\nAccordingly,\nProposition 3: The presence of cognitive conflict within\nthe French hospital SUB performs its strategy, service,\nand control roles.\nConclusion\nThe corporatization of the French public hospital:  Gortner et al.\n(2007) drew a line while linking the private and public orga-\nnizations (positioning in the extremities) via the nonprofit\norganizations. This conception seems to underline a state of\norganization metamorphosis.\nResearchers, from various administrative and manage-\nrial approaches, usually differentiate between the processes\nof privatization and publicization (Heilman & Watson,\n1993) and try to argue which of them may be more efficient\nfor the organization. Then, the governance approach takes\nover and opens the pathway to study the nonprofit (includ-\ning public) and for-profit sectors in the light of the gover-\nnance board theory. This research shows how public\ngovernance may be an application of the corporate gover-\nnance through the board process approach. Generally, under\nthe conditions of autonomy of the SUB, there will be a con-\ncrete expression of the corporatization of the French public\nhospital. In addition, the study reveals that the MGB and\nSUB include reputed physicians, a fact that seems to create\nan ambiguity: Some of them make a decision (within the\nMGB) and the others who ratify (within the SUB; Laouer,\nFuture Research Possibility\nThe incidence of corporatization when analyzed under the\nperspective of the board process, within the French hospital\nindustry can also be applied to the public universities in the\nsame country, which are also in the process of privatization.\nLike the public hospitals, the governance of the universities\nin France faces the same choices in corporatization or publi-\ncization. Just like the public hospitals, the universities have\nthe board of directors with varied stakes and opinions, mak-\ning the board process an integral part in decision making,\nstrategic as well as regular.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAivazian, V.
