Our aim was to explore the relative\ncontributions of these neurons to color perception. We measured the perceptual scaling of\ncolor saturation for equiluminant color checkerboard patterns (designed to stimulate double-\nopponent neurons preferentially) and uniformly colored squares (designed to stimulate only\nsingle-opponent neurons) at several cone contrasts. The spatially integrative responses of single-\nopponent neurons would produce the same response magnitude for checkerboards as for uniform\nsquares of the same space-averaged cone contrast.

The perceptual results therefore\nimply that double-opponent cells are involved in color perception of patterns. We also measured\nthe chromatic visual evoked potential (cVEP) produced by the same stimuli; checkerboard cVEPs\nwere much larger than those for corresponding squares, implying that double-opponent cells also\ncontribute to the cVEP response. The total Fourier power of the cVEP grew sublinearly with cone\ncontrast. However, the 6-Hz Fourier component's power grew linearly with contrast-like saturation\nperception.

Previous research established that color-responsive\nneurons in the primary visual cortex, V1, of macaque monkeys can be assigned to color-\npreferring and color-luminance cell classes (Johnson, Hawken, & Shapley, 2001). Later work\nshowed that color-preferring cells were mostly single-opponent cells and color-luminance\ncells were mostly double-opponent cells (for a review, see Shapley & Hawken, 2011). As a\nconsequence of this formative work, we now know that all color-responsive neurons in V1 are\ndivided into just two known groups that mediate color: specifically, single- and double-\nopponent neurons. Therefore, if a V1 response to color is not due to single-opponent\nneurons, it must be due to double-opponent neurons, and vice versa.\nGiven that in V1, the only color-responsive neurons are single- and double-opponent cells,\nwe sought to answer the fundamental question, what is the relative contribution of each class\nof cells to color perception (cf. different opinions published previously: Shapley, Hawken, &\nSingle- and double-opponent V1 neurons have quite different selectivities for spatial\npatterns of color. Single-opponent cells respond best to equiluminant color patterns with\nspatial frequency <0.5 c/deg and not at all to color patterns >2 c/deg, while double-opponent\ncells respond best to color patterns at 2 c/deg and very little <0.5 c/deg (Johnson et al., 2001;\nDe Valois, & Albrecht, 1984). The different spatial properties allow experimenters to\nstimulate only one class of color-responsive cells by choosing a pattern that is not visible\nto the other class.\nTo answer the question, to what extent do different cell classes contribute to color\nperception, we measured the color appearance of fine checkerboard patterns (comprising\nequiluminant color checks) that have fundamental spatial frequencies around 2 c/deg. Such\npatterns should activate V1 double-opponent cells preferentially. We also measured color\nappearance of large, uniform color squares that should activate the single-opponent cells in\nV1. The participants' color experience was estimated with saturation scaling (see Methods\nsection). The perceived color saturation of both the checkerboards and the uniform squares\nincreased with increasing cone contrast. However, participants assigned larger saturation\nvalues in response to an equiluminant color-gray checkerboard than to a uniform square\nof the equivalent size and cone contrast (see Results section). These results suggest that for\nstimuli designed to stimulate double-opponent cells optimally, the amount of color observed\nwas greater than the amount of color in stimuli chosen to excite only single-opponent cells.\nPreviously, it was hypothesized that double-opponent cells were important for color contrast\n(Livingstone & Hubel, 1984) or color constancy (Gegenfurtner, 2003). Now, we are\ncompelled by the data to propose that double-opponent cells have a major role in the\nperception of color in most spatial patterns. More about our proposal is in the Discussion\nsection.\nA second aim was to compare behavioral and electrophysiological measures of color\nresponsiveness in humans. We compared behavioral, perceptual-scaling data with the\nresponses to color of neuronal populations in human V1 cortex by measuring the\nchromatic visual evoked potential, the cVEP (Crognale, 2002; Crognale, Duncan,\nShoenhard, Peterson, & Berryhill, 2013; Murray, Parry, Carden, & Kulikowski, 1987;\nRabin, Switkes, Crognale, Schneck, & Adams, 1994; Souza et al., 2008), over the same\nrange of color contrast and for the same stimulus patterns as in the behavioral\n2 i-Perception\nexperiments. As reported in the Results section, the cVEP response to equiluminant\ncheckerboard patterns was much bigger than the response to large, uniform, equiluminant\ncolor squares, in agreement with much of the earlier work on the spatial selectivity of the\nearlier results on cVEP spatial selectivity, combined with the known spatial properties of\nV1 single- and double-opponent cells (e.g., Schluppeck & Engel, 2002), imply that the\ncheckerboard cVEP is driven by V1 double-opponent cells. Comparison of the cVEP and\ncolor saturation perception was not straightforward and led to interesting results.\nMethods\nParticipants\nAll observers gave written informed consent to participate in this study. The experiments\nwere conducted in accordance with the principles embodied in the Declaration of Helsinki\nand were approved by the Hunter College/City University of New York and the New York\nUniversity institutional review boards.\nNine observers (three male, six female) aged 19 to 48 years (M \u00bc 27, SD \u00bc 10) participated\nin this experiment. All participants had normal color vision, assessed with the 18-plate series\nPseudo-isochromatic Plates for Testing Color Perception compiled in 1940 by the American\nOptical Company; Farnsworth dichotomous test for color blindness--Panel D15; Lanthony's\ndesaturated 15 hue test; and the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test for color vision. The\nparticipants also had at least 20/20 (or corrected to 20/20) visual acuity, measured using a\nSnellen chart at 114 cm (the distance to the screen during experiments).\nVisual Stimuli\nA Sony PVM-1741A OLED monitor was used to present the stimuli. The monitor had a\nThe screen was calibrated using a Photo Research PR670 Spectrascan Radiometer/\nPhotometer, and this was used to calculate a gamma correction to linearize the screen\noutput to ensure complete control of the intensities on the screen.\nThe stimuli for both the perception (scaling) experiments and for measuring cVEPs were\nequiluminant red\u00adgray color checkerboard patterns and large, uniformly colored red squares\nembedded in an equiluminant gray background. The stimulus size was 20 cm \u00c2 20 cm which\nat a distance of 114 cm corresponded to 10 \u00c2 10 of arc subtended at the eye. For the\nperceptual scaling experiments, each pattern appeared for 0.5 s and then disappeared, at\nwhich time the participant rated the color saturation. In the cVEP experiments, the\npattern appeared for 0.5 s and then disappeared for 1.5 s, with this cycle being repeated in\na block of 30 trials (lasting a total of 60 s) for each stimulus. This rectangular-wave\nmodulation from gray background to color and back to gray (0.5 s on, 1.5 s off; i.e.,\nmodulated at 0.5 Hz with a duty cycle 0.25) is so-called appearance-disappearance\nmodulation. The temporal modulations of the stimuli for both experiments are represented\ndominant spatial frequency of 1/0.4419 \u00bc 2.26 cycles per degree, near the peak of the spatial\nfrequency response reported by Rabin et al. (1994). The background gray color corresponded\nto a color temperature of 5800 K and the pattern color was one of six saturation levels of red\nalong the direction in CIE space from the white point to the red phosphor of the screen, with\nroot mean square (RMS) cone contrast ranging from 0.03 to 0.40. The spatio-chromatic\nNunez et al. 3\nstimuli were chosen so that participants could perceive a definite color in the colored checks\nand squares for the hue and saturation scaling experiments (Gordon, Abramov, & Chan,\n1994). The corresponding chromatic excitation purities and CIE coordinates are provided in\nTable 1. For all stimuli, the luminance was 31 cd/m2.\nStimulus presentation was controlled using the Psychophysics Toolbox extensions\nInc., Natick, MA, USA), which ran on a Dell Inspiron-3847 computer using the Microsoft\nWindows 7 operating system. To ensure tighter control of timing, particularly for changing\nimages on the screen from one frame to the next, we followed methods similar to those\nproposed by Scarfe (n.d.). A trigger signal was sent via the serial port to the recording\nsystem directly before each stimulus was presented.\nDuring each experiment, the participant was seated such that her or his eye level was\naligned with the center of the screen and the viewing distance was 114 cm. Stimuli were\nSaturation scaling\nstimulus\nFigure 1. Representation of the appearance\u00addisappearance stimulus with time during the cVEP and scaling\nexperiments. For 0.5 s, a checkerboard of squares was visible. In the checkerboard, squares of equiluminant\nred of a specific cone contrast alternated with squares that were gray like the background. This ``on'' pattern\nconsisted of 32 \u00c2 32 squares covering 10 \u00c2 10 of arc subtended at the eye and was followed by an interval\nduring which the entire screen was uniform gray (``off''). The transition between ``on'' and ``off'' patterns\noccurred suddenly; thus, the temporal modulation signal was a rectangular wave. All checks and the\nbackground were the same luminance. During cVEP experiments, the ``off'' pattern of duration was 1.5 s, with\nthe ``on/off'' cycle being repeated 30 times per stimulus. During scaling experiments, the ``off'' pattern lasted\nuntil the participant had completed the saturation ratings for the stimulus, after which the next stimulus was\npresented.\nTable 1. RMS Cone Contrast and Corresponding Color Excitation Purity and CIE\nColor Coordinates for Each Stimulus Presented.\nCIE color coordinates\nCone contrast Color excitation purity x y\n4 i-Perception\nviewed binocularly. During cVEP runs there was one block of stimulus presentations for each\ncone contrast and the blocks were presented in random order. Each participant was asked to\nfocus on the center of the screen and to blink as little as possible, particularly when a stimulus\nwas visible on the screen.\nSaturation Scaling\nWe employed a form of hue and saturation scaling used by Gordon et al. (1994) derived from\nJameson and Hurvich (1959). The technique is essentially the same that we have used before\nin other experiments (Gordon et al., 1994; Gordon & Shapley, 2006; Xing, Ouni, Chen,\nSahmoud, Gordon, & Shapley, 2015). For the purposes of this report, we consider only\nsaturation ratings. Each stimulus was presented a total of four times in random order for\nrating purposes. For each stimulus presentation, the screen showed the gray background, and\nthen the stimulus was presented for a duration of 0.5 s before the screen was switched back to\nthe gray background (as in Figure 1). The observers described saturation as the percentage of\nthe entire sensation, chromatic and achromatic, that was chromatic. The experimenter\nexplained that the total absence of hue (i.e., gray) would be represented by 0% saturation,\nand a total absence of any achromatic sensation (i.e., pure color) would be 100% saturation.\nParticipants were given as many practice trials beforehand as were needed for them to be\ncomfortable with the scaling process, usually corresponding to a minimum of 10 practice\ntrials.\nSaturation can be a problematic concept for participants. In spite of the difficulty, we have\nobtained consistent saturation scaling across observers (for instance in Gordon & Shapley,\n2006). Many other groups have studied color appearance using similar hue and/or saturation\nscaling methods (e.g., Bimler, Paramei, & Izmailov, 2009; De Valois, De Valois, Switkes, &\ncVEP Data Acquisition\nData were recorded using a BioSemi ActiveTwo system (BioSemi, Amsterdam,\nNetherlands); with 64 electrodes, we obtained the spatial resolution of a 128-channel\nsystem by positioning 63 electrodes on the back half of a 128-channel BioSemi electrode\ncap setup with the extended 10-20 system (based on the Oostenveld and Praamstra (2001)\n5% system). One electrode was positioned at Fpz and all data were re-referenced to Fpz\nafter data acquisition. When aligning the electrode cap, we ensured that the electrode for\nOz was correctly positioned at 10% of the inion-nasion distance along the midline of the\nscalp. The trigger and electroencephalography (EEG) signals were sampled at a frequency\nof 2048 Hz, with an open passband from 0 to 400 Hz. Usually, each experimental run\nconsisted of 30 trials \u00bc periods of the 0.5 Hz stimulus. Thus, each cVEP point is usually\nbased on 60 s worth of data.\ncVEP Data Analysis\nUsing functions from the FieldTrip toolbox for EEG/MEG analysis (Oostenveld, Fries,\nMaris, & Schoffelen, 2011; http://www.ru.nl/neuroimaging/fieldtrip), we imported the\nresponse data for each stimulus and separated them into trials containing a prestimulus\nNunez et al. 5\nThe EEG data in each trial were re-referenced with respect to electrode Fpz, and then were\nbaseline-corrected with respect to the average voltage across each entire trial. The data were\ninspected visually (all channels simultaneously on a trial-by-trial basis) to remove blinks and\nartifacts due to movement or extreme electronic noise transients (greater than 150 mV). At\nthis point, the trial data were baseline-corrected with respect to the prestimulus period and\nwere grouped into epochs of three trials before a Discrete Fourier Transform was calculated,\nusing a period of 0.5 s, covering the duration of the stimulus. This resulted in a Fourier\nfundamental frequency of 2 Hz. Note that we chose not to conduct Fourier analysis over\nthe whole stimulus on\u00adoff period because our purpose was strictly to focus on the waveform\nshape over the time when the stimulus was visible. This was partly because the participants\ntended to blink more after the stimulus disappeared but mainly because the responses in\nwhich we are interested were in this range. The first 100 Fourier harmonics were used to\nconstruct inverse FT waveforms. Before the reconstruction step, the data were filtered for\n60 Hz noise and its harmonics by setting the amplitudes of the corresponding harmonics to\nzero. No additional filtering, including any high-pass band filtering, took place. Note that\nwhen further analysis involved the grand averaging of Fourier data across all participants, a\nfew data points were excluded from the averaging due to excessive electrode noise or drift for\na given participant or stimulus.\nResults\nPerceptual Scaling Results\nNormalized saturation scaling data averaged across all participants are drawn in Figure 2.\nThe color of the red checks in the high-frequency checkerboard scaled in saturation fairly\nlinearly with cone contrast. Participants' scaling data were very similar to one another as\nindicated by the small error bars in Figure 2. For the range of cone contrasts used, there is no\nevidence of the ratings hitting a response ceiling with increasing cone contrast; the perceived\nsaturation grew monotonically and directly proportional to the cone contrast.\nPerceived saturation of color checkerboards was higher than that of a large, uniform\nsquare of the same space-averaged cone contrast (Figure 2). Why did we compare the\ncheckerboard appearance to that of a square of equivalent space-averaged contrast?\nRMS cone contrast\nMean Normalized\nSaturation\nCheckerboard\nUniform square\nStimulus Type\nFigure 2. Normalized saturation scaling data averaged across all participants, presented as a function of\nRMS cone contrast for the checkerboard (red) and uniform colored square (blue) patterns. Error bars\nrepresent \u00c61 SEM. Note that the cone contrast of the uniform square was scaled to take into account the\nfact that the space-averaged cone contrast of the red\u00adgray checkerboard was one-half that of a uniform\nsquare of the same chroma or cone contrast (compared with the equiluminant gray).\n6 i-Perception\nThe reason is, if the responses to both types of stimuli were due only to contributions from\nsingle-opponent neurons, the response to the fine checkerboard would be to its space-\naveraged cone contrast because single-opponent cells cannot resolve such fine patterns (see\nIntroduction section). Therefore, to test the hypothesis that all color perception must go\nthrough the single-opponent cells, one ought to compute the spatial average of the\ncheckerboard cone contrast to match the responses from the square. The fact that the\ncheckerboard pattern evokes a greater response than the square of equivalent cone\ncontrast suggests that there must be a visual response to color in addition to that of\nsingle-opponent neurons. In the early visual cortex V1, the only other possible neural\nsubstrate of color perception is the population of double-opponent neurons. The space-\naveraged cone contrast of a red-gray checkerboard is one-half that of a large, uniform\nsquare of the same chroma or cone contrast (compared with the equiluminant gray).\nTherefore, for the checkerboard, we plotted the data at the same x-axis value as the\nsquare that had half the cone contrast. Figure 2 reveals that color checkerboards were\nespecially good stimuli for evoking the appearance of color and that much of their color\nappearance must be caused by higher frequency components in the color checkerboard rather\nthan the space-averaged DC component. Since the checkerboard pattern is fairly fine and\nwould be sensed much better by double-opponent than by single-opponent cells in V1 cortex\n(Schluppeck & Engel, 2002), Figure 2 is evidence that double-opponent cells contribute very\nsignificantly to color perception.\ncVEPs: Waveforms and Topography\nThe cVEP waveforms were predominantly negative deflections, consistent with earlier reports\n2008). The cVEP was recorded with a dense multielectrode array (Methods section) from\nwhich we could estimate the regions of the cerebral cortex activated by the spatio-chromatic\nstimulus. The waveforms and topography of the cVEP responses to the checkerboard were\ndiscussed in detail in previous work (Nunez, Shapley, & Gordon, 2017). The conclusion from\nour analysis of cVEP topography was that most of the cortical activity we studied was\ngenerated within primary visual cortex, V1. This was in agreement with work of other\nresearchers (e.g., Crognale et al., 2013; Xing et al., 2015). There was no notable activity in\nextra-striate cortex or in nonvisual cortex preceding the rise of the cVEP to its peak. Finally,\nthe largest cortical response was consistently observed at Oz, also consistent with prior work\n(e.g., Murray et al., 1987). As a result, data in this article focus solely on cVEP recordings\nfrom electrode Oz.\ncVEPs: Nonlinear Dynamics With Color Contrast\nFigure 3 depicts the cVEPs of one participant over a range of cone contrasts to illustrate\ncVEP waveforms and dependence on cone contrast. In the upper panel are responses to\ncheckerboard patterns; in the lower panel are responses to large, uniform squares, also\nover a range of cone contrasts. The results (Figure 3) support earlier findings that the\ncVEP is spatially tuned; the cVEP is much larger in responses to equiluminant patterns of\nintermediate spatial frequency and its response is much weaker to low frequency or spatially\nThe cVEP generated in V1 by the checkerboard patterns exhibited nonlinear dynamics in\nresponses to different cone contrasts, that is, the temporal waveform of the response changed\nNunez et al. 7\ndramatically from low to high cone contrast (Nunez et al., 2017). The cVEP for lower cone\ncontrast was (a) slower to rise (Crognale et al., 1993; Porciatti & Sartucci, 1996; Rabin et al.,\n1994; Souza et al., 2008) and (b) more prolonged than at higher contrast. We analyzed these\nnonlinear dynamics further in a number of ways. We replicated results on shorter cVEP\nlatency at higher cone contrast (Crognale et al., 1993; Porciatti & Sartucci, 1996; Rabin\net al., 1994; Souza et al., 2008) by Fourier analyzing the cVEP waveform into harmonics\nof a fundamental frequency, 2 Hz, which is the frequency that has 0.5 s, the duration of the\nstimulus, as its period (see Methods section). The largest harmonic amplitude was usually at\n4 Hz, so we analyzed the phase shift of the 4 Hz component in the Fourier transform of the\ncVEP. Consistently across all observers, there was a very large phase advance, greater than or\nequal to 100 of phase, from low to high cone contrast (Nunez et al., 2017), replicating results\nof many previous studies that found decreasing latency with increasing cone contrast\nWe analyzed the Fourier representation of the checkerboard responses further (see\nMethods section). The main analysis was of the contrast dependence of the amplitude\nspectrum of the cVEP. This analysis extended only up to the first five harmonics of the\nfundamental frequency based on an analysis of the cumulative power spectrum (e.g.,\nJospin et al., 2007), the sum of the power up to and including a specified harmonic.\nCumulative power spectra indicated that most of the power of the cVEP was contained in\nAnalysis of Fourier amplitude spectra of the color-checkerboard-evoked cVEP waveforms\ndemonstrates the profound change in response dynamics with cone contrast.

Note that the pattern\n8 i-Perception\nThe Fourier spectra were normalized to 1 at peak amplitude. Figure 4 shows the spectra\nchange with cone contrast; there is much more power in the higher harmonics at high\ncontrast than at low. This change of spectrum with contrast is a nonlinear effect\nColor Perception and cVEP Comparison\nFourier analysis also was used to study the dependence of cVEP response power on cone\ncontrast (Figure 5). Figure 5 top panel depicts response power versus cone contrast averaged\nacross all nine participants in this study: power summed across the first five harmonics\n(2\u00ad10 Hz) of the stimulus period. As we reasoned earlier, the cumulative power spectra\nindicated that most response power was contained in these five harmonics so the power\nsummed over them should give a good estimate of total response power (Parseval's\nTheorem). Two separate contrast-response functions are graphed for the two kinds of\nstimuli used: (a) checkerboard and (b) large, uniformly colored square. For the\ncontrast and then levels off so that response power at 0.09 contrast is already 80% as large as\nthe response to the highest cone contrast used, 0.4. In other words, response power of the\nresponse to color checkerboards grows sublinear with cone contrast. Also in Figure 5 upper\npanel, the data for total power of the response to large, uniformly colored squares are\nplotted. Consistent with the spatial tuning evident in our data (Figure 3), the total\nresponse power of the responses to the large, uniform red squares was much less than that\nof the checkerboard responses at the same space-averaged cone contrast.\nThe cVEP power summed across the first five harmonics (that we had previously\nascertained as constituting the response power of the cVEP, as stated before) did not track\nthe perception (scaling data in Figure 2) but rather rose more quickly with cone contrast than\nthe scaling data, and flattened at cone contrast > 0.1. This flattening of cVEP power with\ncone contrast replicates earlier results on sublinear response versus color contrast. Peak\namplitude of the cVEP versus contrast was previously found to be roughly proportional to\nthe log of the cone contrast (Fiorentini, Burr, & Morrone, 1991; Gomes et al., 2010; Souza\nFrequency (Hz)\nFourier amplitude (normalized)\nFrequency (Hz)\nFourier amplitude (normalized)\nFigure 4. Normalized Fourier amplitude spectrum of checkerboard responses for two different RMS cone\ncontrasts (0.09 on the left and 0.4 on the right) for a typical participant.\nNunez et al. 9\nWhen we plotted individual Fourier component power versus cone contrast for the\ncheckerboard data (for a range of individual harmonics as well as for various harmonic\ncombinations), we found that the dependence of the power of the 6 Hz (H3) component\nwas roughly proportional to cone contrast like the saturation scaling data (Figure 2). This\nresult is accentuated in Table 2 which presents the correlation coefficients for Fourier power\nversus saturation rating for each participant, where Fourier power was calculated for just the\n6 Hz component as well as for the combined 2 to 10 Hz Fourier components. For seven of\nthe nine participants, the correlation coefficients were higher for the 6 Hz component than for\nthe total 2 to 10 Hz Fourier components.\nIt is possible that this result means that a dynamic component of the neuronal population\nactivity is more salient for perception than the total power or peak response, as we will\ndiscuss later.\nDiscussion\nScaling and Color Perception--Double-Opponent Versus Single-Opponent Cells\nas the Source of Color Perception\nIt is important to consider the neural origins of color appearance.

The color checkerboards that were our\nstimuli were equiluminant color checkerboards; therefore, they evoke responses only from\nsubpopulations of V1 neurons that are responsive to color: single-opponent and double-\nopponent cortical neurons (Schluppeck & Engel, 2002).\nIt is possible to infer what population of color-responsive neurons supports color\nappearance based on previous work on the spatial frequency sensitivity and selectivity of\n2014). Cortical color computations are based on the combined activity of two kinds of\ncortical cone-opponent neurons, single- and double-opponent cells, and also on the cone-\nnonopponent neurons that respond strongly to achromatic patterns (reviewed in Shapley\net al., 2014). Single-opponent cells integrate and double-opponent cells differentiate color\nsignals across visual space. Single-opponent cells respond to large areas of color and to the\ninteriors of large patches. Double-opponent cells respond to color patterns (Johnson et al.,\n2001) and color boundaries (Friedman, Zhou, & von der Heydt, 2003). Single- and double-\nopponent neurons have different spatial frequency responses and this fact can be used to test\ntheir contributions to color appearance. As shown by Schluppeck and Engel (2002), single-\nopponent neurons not only respond to lower spatial frequencies but their responses cut off at\nlower spatial frequencies than those of double-opponent cells. The spatial frequency tuning of\ndouble-opponent cells (and also nonopponent cells) are spatially band pass (Schluppeck &\nEngel, 2002). There is a spatial frequency range (1 to 4 c/deg) where double-opponent\ncells respond and single-opponent neurons respond weakly or not at all. In this range,\ncolor stimuli are mainly stimulating double-opponent neurons. This is the range in\nwhich we measured saturation scaling with the checkerboards, by design exploring whether\nor not color was perceived in moderately fine patterns when one would expect that\nonly double-opponent cells contributed to the percept. Under these conditions, there was\nreliable color scaling that was roughly proportional to cone contrast in all our participants\nand that was in fact considerably larger than the perceived saturation of uniformly colored\nsquares of the same space-averaged cone contrast. These results are evidence that double-\nopponent cells indeed contribute to color appearance over the full gamut of cone contrasts\nstudied.\nThere was a DC component of color in the red\u00adgray checkerboard patterns that could\nhave been an effective stimulus for single-opponent cells. The DC component is half of the\nstrength of a large, uniformly colored square stimulus of the same chroma as the checks in the\ncheckerboard because half of the checks were neutral gray and the chromatic DC component\nis the average of the chroma in the red and gray checks. In the scaling experiments with large,\nTable 2.

Note that the correlations between participants reflect individual differences in cVEP results and saturation ratings\nacross the range of cone contrasts.\nuniformly colored square stimuli (Figure 2), we found that the perceived saturation of the DC\ncomponent was much less than the saturation perceived in the checkerboard so that the\nmajor contributor to the perceived color of the checks was a neural mechanism that\nresponded to the checks--and we conclude that this is the double-opponent population\n(because there are no other color-responsive neurons in V1). These results led to our\nproposal that double-opponent cells are major contributors to the perception of color in\nall color patterns. Most double-opponent cells in V1 respond to both color and achromatic\nluminance patterns (Johnson et al., 2001, 2004). If double-opponent cells comprise the\nneuronal substrate of color perception in spatial patterns, as we propose, cortical decoding\nof population activity would be necessary to recover the stimulus color (discussed in Shapley\nV1 Double-Opponent Cells as the Source of cVEP Signals\nTo compare the electrophysiologically recorded cVEP signals with color perception, one\nneeds to infer what is the source of the cVEP signal. We found that for spatial patterns\nsuch as checkerboard patterns, the cVEP was localized mostly over posterior occipital cortex\n(Nunez et al., 2017) consistent with the hypothesis that the cVEP is generated in V1 cortex\n(Crognale et al., 2013; Xing et al., 2015). More evidence that the cVEP reflects color-evoked\nactivity in the primary visual cortex is as follows. The cVEP does not vary with attention, a\nresult that strongly suggests it is evoked early in cortical visual processing (Highsmith &\nCrognale, 2010). Furthermore, normal cVEPs have been recorded in cases of cerebral\nachromatopsia where color appearance was lost and lesions were observed in ventromedial\nextrastriate cortex, but V1 responses to color were unaffected by the lesion (Crognale et al.,\n2013; Victor, Maiese, Shapley, Sidtis, & Gazzaniga, 1989). The combined evidence from\nsource localization, lack of attentional effects, and cerebral achromatopsia indicates that\nthe cVEP is an index of early cortical responses to color, and the topography (Nunez\net al., 2017) supports this conclusion. However, for the low contrast cVEP, there seems to\nbe spreading activity to lateral posterior cortical areas indicating that the cVEP may involve\nextra-striate cortex at low cone contrast (Nunez et al., 2017).\nDouble-opponent cells comprise approximately 80% of all color responsive cells in the\noutput layers two thirds of macaque V1 cortex (Friedman et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2001)\nand that may be why they might contribute most to the cVEP signal. It also is noteworthy\nthat macaque cortical responses to color measured with voltage-sensitive-dye-imaging or\nVSDI also are consistent with a preponderance of edge-sensitive double-opponent cells in\nprimate V1 cortex (Zweig, Zurawel, Shapley, & Slovin, 2015).\nIt is well known that the cVEP signal is tuned for spatial frequency like double-opponent\ncells and unlike single-opponent cells. cVEP amplitude is much smaller for lower spatial\nfrequencies than it is at its peak spatial frequency, between 1 and 2 c/deg, a consistent\nresult across many studies of cVEP (Murray et al., 1987; Porciatti & Sartucci, 1996; Rabin\net al., 1994; Tobimatsu et al., 1995). Our results in Figure 5, about total response power for\ncVEP responses to checkerboards versus those to large, uniform squares, strongly support\nthe earlier findings about spatial tuning of the cVEP. Taken together with results from single-\ncell recording in primates (Johnson et al., 2001; Schluppeck & Engel, 2002), the spatial tuning\nof the cVEP suggests that it is mainly driven by V1 double-opponent cells that also are\nspatially tuned. Unlike double-opponent cells, cortical single-opponent cells respond best\nto patterns of low spatial frequency or to uniform fields of color (Johnson et al., 2001;\nWhy Do Scaling and 6-Hz cVEP Component Have Similar Contrast-Response Functions\nThe results on the sublinear cone contrast dependence of total cVEP power confirm results of\npossible coding of apparent saturation as the integration of the total power of neuronal\nresponses in V1 is not supported by the earlier studies or by our own results. However,\nwhen we dissected the cVEP response into Fourier components, surprisingly we found that\nthe power of the component at 6 Hz was linear with cone contrast like saturation perception.\nThus, we can propose the hypothesis that color saturation is encoded in the 6 Hz component\nof the cVEP. This hypothesis needs to be tested with a wide range of color stimuli in the\nfuture. The hypothesis could be a powerful tool for linking neuronal responsiveness to color\nperception.\nStill, it is mysterious why a dynamic component of the response should be what the brain\nis using for gauging color saturation. The most straightforward explanation is that the\ncortical readout of V1 activity has a temporal resonance or tuned filter that is especially\nsensitive to 6 Hz or frequencies near it. This can only be speculation at this point in time, but\nthe curious result about perception and 6 Hz could be a useful clue to mechanisms that link\nneural activity to perception.\n"
