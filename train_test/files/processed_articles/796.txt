In the present study, we used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry\nmeasurements of femoral bone mineral density (BMD) from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III, 1988\u00ad1994) to estimate the overall scope of the disease in the older U.S. population.\nSpecifically, we estimate prevalences of low femoral BMD in women 50 years and older and explore different\napproaches for defining low BMD in older men in that age range. Low BMD levels were defined in accordance with\nan approach proposed by an expert panel of the World Health Organization and used BMD data from 382\nnon-Hispanic white (NHW) men or 409 NHW women ages 20\u00ad29 years from the NHANES III dataset.

Although the\netiology of osteoporotic fractures is multifactorial, bone\nmineral density (BMD) has been identified as one of the\nprimary predictive risk factors.(1\u00ad3) Based on this fact, an\nexpert panel of the World Health Organization (WHO)\nrecently proposed diagnostic criteria for osteoporosis based\non bone density.(4,5) The applicability of these criteria to\ngroups other than white women is not certain; but osteo-\nporosis is not only a disease of white women.(6,7) For ex-\nW. Edward Bacon). The proportion of men may increase in\nthe future because the hip fracture incidence rate in U.S.\nmen appears to be going up over time, while rates in women\nmay have plateaued.(8,9)\n*Portions of these data were presented at the annual meeting of\nthe American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, Baltimore,\n1Division of Health Examination Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hyattsville, Maryland, U.S.A.\n2Portland VA Medical Center, and Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, Oregon, U.S.A.\n3Indiana University Medical Center, Indiana University, Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.A.\n4Regional Bone Center, Helen Hayes Hospital, West Haverstraw, New York, U.S.A.\n5Diagnostic Radiology, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, Minnesota, U.S.A.\n6Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, Washington, D.C., U.S.A.\n7National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A.\n8National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A.\nBlackwell Science, Inc.\n\u00a9 1997 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research\nWe recently estimated the prevalence of older U.S.\nwomen with low femoral BMD using the WHO diagnostic\ncriteria in conjunction with femoral BMD data collected in\nthe first 3-year national sample of the third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).(10) We\nincluded estimates for nonwhite women from two minority\ngroups with BMD values that fell below cutoffs based on\nwhite women. Since that time, the second 3-year national\nsample of NHANES III has been completed. In this paper,\nwe update the estimates of osteoporosis in older U.S.\nwomen, including minority women, using the full 6 years of\nNHANES III. In addition, we explore the application of the\nWHO criteria to older U.S. men.\nData source\nEstimates of low femoral bone density are based on data\ncollected in NHANES III. The NHANES are conducted\nperiodically by the National Center for Health Statistics,\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, to assess the\nhealth and nutritional status of the civilian noninstitution-\nalized population of the United States. NHANES III is a\nnational probability samples. The survey uses a stratified,\nmultistage probability design to select the sample and has\nbeen described in detail elsewhere.(11)\nAll men and nonpregnant women age 20 years and older\nwere eligible for bone densitometry unless they had fractured\nboth hips previously. Bone mineral measurements were per-\nthe full survey. This represents 63% of the eligible selected\nsample, 78% of the eligible interviewed sample, and 88% of\nthe eligible examined sample. The left hip was scanned unless\nthere was a history of previous fracture or surgery; only 1%\nreceived a scan of the right femur. Because their inclusion\ndid not alter prevalence estimates, those who received a\nscan of the right femur were included in the analyses.\nPrevalences were estimated for men and women age 50\nyears and older because the predictive relationship between\nfracture and femur BMD has been studied exclusively in\nolder persons.(1\u00ad3) Bone mineral measurements were per-\nwere rejected for technical reasons after review, leaving 3090\nolder who received scans, 68, or 2%, were rejected, leaving\n3311 with acceptable BMD data. The race/ethnic composi-\ntion of the sample of older persons with acceptable BMD\nRace and ethnic categories were based on self-reported\ndata using U.S. Census Bureau definitions. There were too\nfew persons of other race and ethnic groups (n  95 and\n136 older men and women, respectively) to report preva-\nlences separately for these groups, although they were in-\ncluded in estimates for the total population.\nBone density measurements\nBMD of the proximal femur was measured using dual-\nenergy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at five regions of\ninterest. In this study, we present data on four regions:\nfemoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter, and total femur.\nData for the fifth region, Ward's triangle, was not included\nbecause (1) it represents a calculated area of low bone\ndensity rather than a true anatomic region; (2) Ward's\ntriangle data from the two phases of NHANES III are not\ndirectly comparable due to software changes that allowed\nthe location of Ward's triangle to vary in phase 1, but fixed\nit midcervically in phase 2; and (3) it had a larger in vivo\nmeasurement error (5%) than the other regions (2\u00ad3%).(12)\nThree densitometers (Hologic QDR 1000; Waltham, MA,\nU.S.A.), located in mobile examination centers, were used\nto obtain the measurements. A rigorous quality control\n(QC) program, including use of anthropomorphic phan-\ntoms and review of each QC and respondent scan at a\ncentral site, was used throughout the study to ensure data\nquality. QC results for the first phase of NHANES III have\nbeen published elsewhere(12); QC results from the second\nphase were similar to those for phase 1.\nDefinition of low bone density\nThe WHO diagnostic criteria for osteopenia and osteo-\nporosis(4,5) were used to define low bone density among\nmen and women age 50 years and older. This approach\ndefines cutoff values using BMD data from a young adult\nreference group. The WHO criteria did not specify details\nabout the reference group in terms of age, race, or gender.\nNHW men or women between 20 and 29 years of age were\nused as the reference group in the present study because\nthere are prospective data indicating that bone loss occurs\nat the femur in women during their 30s.(13) In addition, the\nInternational Committee for Standards in Bone Densitom-\netry recently chose the 20\u00ad29 year age range as the refer-\nence range for standardizing cutoffs between different bone\ndensitometry instruments (personal communication, Dr.\nPeter Steiger). Of the scans performed on the young white\n(1.5%), excluded for technical reasons in each group, were\nused for the reference group. For each of the four regions\nof interest, low bone density was defined as: (1) osteopenia:\na BMD value between 1 standard deviation (SD) and 2.5\nSD below the mean of white men or women age 20\u00ad29\nyears; and (2) osteoporosis: a BMD value 2.5 SD below\nthe young reference mean.\nThese cutoff points were applied to minority men and\nwomen in this study as well as to NHWs because data on the\npredictive utility of femur BMD for hip fracture in non-\nwhites is lacking to date. In addition, estimates for men\nwere made using cutoffs derived from both the young male\nand female reference groups, since currently there are in-\nsufficient data to identify clearly the most appropriate ap-\nproach for men.\nData analysis\nSampling weights were used to calculate prevalence esti-\nmates and to account for oversampling and nonresponse to\nthe household interview and physical examination. The\nsampling weights for phases 1 and 2 were based on the\nvalues for the civilian noninstitutionalized population, both\nadjusted for undercounts.(14) All analyzes were performed\nBoth unadjusted and age-adjusted prevalences of low\nBMD among men and women age 50 years and older were\ncalculated by race and ethnic group. Unadjusted preva-\nlences were used to calculate the number of men and\nwomen with low BMD in the U.S., while age-adjusted\nprevalences were used for comparison of prevalences be-\ntween genders and race/ethnic groups, since bone density is\nrelated to age(16) and the age structure of the different\ngender and race/ethnic groups varies in the U.S. population.\nPrevalences were age-adjusted using the direct method to\nthe age distribution of the 1980 population.\nRESULTS\nMean BMD, SDs, range of BMD, and the cut-off values\ncorresponding to the WHO diagnostic criteria for low bone\nmass in the four regions of interest for the reference group\nof young white men and women are shown in Table 1.\nUpdated prevalences of osteopenia and osteoporosis in\nwomen in the four femur regions using the WHO diagnostic\ncriteria are shown by population in Table 2. Estimates of\nosteopenia in older women ranged from 37 to 50%, or\n18%, or 4\u00ad6 million. Prevalences of each condition were\nhigher in the femoral neck region than in the other femoral\nregions. Age-adjusted prevalences of both osteopenia and\nosteoporosis were higher in NHWs than in NHBs; preva-\nlences in MAs were similar or slightly lower than in NHWs.\nThe ratio of age-adjusted prevalences in NHWs versus\nNHBs ranged from 1.5 to 2.8, depending on the femoral\nregion and definition of low BMD used (data not shown).\nCorresponding ratios of prevalences for NHWs versus MAs\nPrevalences of osteopenia and osteoporosis in men of all\nraces based on male versus female cutoff values are shown\nin Table 3. Prevalences of osteopenia were noticably higher\nwhen based on male cutoffs than female cutoffs, ranging\nlences of osteoporosis were only slightly higher when based\non male versus female cutoffs.\nWhen age-adjusted prevalences in men and women are\ncompared, the female-to-male ratios were 1.1\u00ad1.6 for os-\nteopenia when prevalence in men was based on male cutoffs\nand 1.5\u00ad2.8 when based on female cutoffs (data not shown).\nFor osteoporosis, the female-to-male ratios were 2.7\u00ad4.3\nwhen using male cutoffs for men and 4\u00ad7.5 when using\nfemale cutoffs.\nPatterns of osteopenia and osteoporosis by race or eth-\nnicity in men using the two sets of cutoffs are compared\nwith the patterns seen in women as shown in Fig. 1. The\npattern for osteopenia is similar in men and women regard-\nless of the cutoff used in men, with NHWs of both genders\nhaving the highest prevalences, followed by MAs, and\nNHBs having the lowest prevalences. The prevalences of\nosteoporosis were also greatest in NHW men regardless of\nthe cutoff used. Prevalences of osteoporosis in men of\neither minority group were so small that they did not\nachieve statistical reliability, and so the pattern must be\ninterpreted with caution. It suggests, however, that, unlike\nwomen, MA men may have a lower prevalence of osteopo-\nrosis than NHB men.\nDISCUSSION\nA considerable number of noninstitutionalized older cit-\nizens in the U.S. have low femoral bone density, as defined\nRegion of interest\nMean\nStandard\ndeviation\n(g/cm2) Range\nBMD cutoff values for:\nOsteopenia* Osteoporosis*\n* WHO diagnostic criteria4,5: Osteopenia, BMD value between 1\u00ad2.5 SD below mean of young adult reference group; Osteoporosis,\nBMD value 2.5 SD below mean of young adult reference group.\nby WHO diagnostic criteria.(4,5) For women, updated esti-\nmillion have osteopenia. For men, these numbers depend\non whether male versus female cutoff values are used.\nWhen based on male cutoffs, 1\u00ad2 million men have osteo-\nporosis and 8\u00ad13 million have osteopenia; when based on\n4\u00ad9 million have osteopenia. Regardless of which cutoffs\nare used for men, the numbers are substantial.\nThe updated prevalences of osteopenia in women are\nsimilar to those published previously using phase 1 data\nonly, while the updated prevalences of osteoporosis are\nslightly lower.(10) The latter is a result of the larger SDs and\nconcomitantly lower osteoporosis cutoff values when based\non the larger reference group of 409 young NHW women.\nBy chance, the representative sample in phase 2 of the\nsurvey included a small number of young women with BMD\nvalues that exceeded the BMD range observed in phase 1.\nThis wider BMD distribution contributed to the larger SD\nfor the total sample of these young women. Because of the\nlarger sample sizes, we believe the updated prevalence\nestimates are the most reliable estimates of osteoporosis\nand osteopenia in women.\nThe definitions of low BMD used in this study were based\non the WHO diagnostic criteria.(4,5) These guidelines rep-\nresent an important step in describing the extent and char-\nacteristics of osteoporosis, but the panel was aware that the\nguidelines had limitations and would likely change with\nmore experience. A major issue for the current study is the\napplication of the guidelines to men, since they were devel-\noped for women. The WHO panel noted that the criteria\nlikely should be modified for men, but there were insuffi-\ncient data to do so. To firmly resolve the issue, prospective\ndata on the absolute risk of fracture at any given BMD level\nin men must be obtained. In the absence of such data, the\npanel suggested either applying female cutoffs to men or\nusing a more stringent criterion of 3\u00ad4 SD for osteoporosis\nif cutoffs were based on a male reference group.\nOur cross-sectional study can illustrate some of the issues\nto be addressed in determining the appropriate definitions\nof osteopenia and osteoporosis in men. For example, in our\nsample of older men, 1.5% had BMD values more than 3\nSD below the young men's mean, which suggests that this\ncriterion may be too stringent. When we used the 2.5 SD\ncriterion, the prevalence of femoral osteoporosis in older\nmen was similar regardless of the gender of the reference\ngroup. This is probably because the osteoporosis cutoff\nvalues fell in the tail of the BMD distribution of older men,\nwhere small differences in cutoff values will not result in\nadding or subtracting many individuals. Our estimates of\nosteoporosis in older men using either male or female\ncutoffs were similar in magnitude to the estimates of life-\ntime risk of hip fracture for men from other studies(17); this\ntype of similarity was cited by the WHO panel to support\nthe validity of the guidelines for women.(4,5) Until the ap-\npropriate prospective data on fracture risk in men are\navailable, it seems reasonable to use the 2.5 SD criterion to\nestimate prevalence of osteoporosis among older men in\nthe population. This approach for defining osteoporosis in\na population does not, however, constitute a clinical diag-\nnostic criteria for men.\nAn interim definition of osteopenia for the male popu-\nlation is not clear though, since prevalences of osteopenia\ndepended on the gender of the reference group used to\nderive the cutoff values. When based on male cutoffs, the\nprevalences of osteopenia in older men were almost as high\nas those in older women, which may seem too high given the\nlower fracture rate in men. When considering how to define\nosteopenia in men, it may be pertinent to recall that this\ncategory was defined for women primarily to identify those\nin whom preventing further bone loss would be most use-\nful.(4,5) The gradient of risk between BMD and fracture is\ncontinuous,(4,5) so men with osteopenia are likely to be at\nsome increased risk of developing osteoporosis compared\nwith men with higher BMD values. In addition, femoral\nBMD also declines progressively with age in men.(18) Given\nthis, an osteopenia category in men may be useful to help\ndirect prevention efforts regardless of whether it is defined\nby male or female cutoffs.\nOther issues may be important to consider in defining\nlow bone mass for men. For example, uniform criteria for\nmen and women have been used for other disease risk\nfactors, such as hypercholesterolemia and hypertension.\nThe assumption of similar mechanisms, levels of risk, and\nresponse to treatment in men and women is inherently\nappealing and also provides clinical simplicity. However,\nFIG. 1. Age-adjusted prevalence of low femur neck BMD\nby race or ethnicity, ages 50 years. NHW  NonHispanic\nwhite; NHB  NonHispanic black; MA  Mexican Amer-\nican.\nthese considerations must be reconciled with factors that\nmay favor gender-specific cutoffs. For example, male frac-\nture cases have higher BMD levels than female fracture\ncases(19 \u00ad22); it is unclear, however, whether this finding\nreflects a truly higher fracture risk for a given BMD in men\nor simply that the entire male BMD distribution is higher\nthan that of women. Fracture risk at a given BMD level\nmight truly differ between genders because of differences in\nskeletal loads from the larger male body mass or gender\ndifferences in structure\u00adresistance relationships.(23)\nAlternatively, fracture risk in men could appear to differ\nbecause areal bone density, as measured by DEXA, does\nnot completely account for the confounding effect of bone\nsize.(24) Young adult men and women have similar spinal\nvolumetric bone density, as measured by computed tomog-\nraphy, but spinal areal bone density by DEXA is greater in\nhigher areal femoral BMD than women before adjusting for\nbody size,(16) but levels are similar after this adjustment,\nwith the possible exception of the femoral neck.(25\u00ad27) The\ncurrent DEXA reports do not adjust BMD for body size, so\ngender-specific cutoff values may be necessary to account\nfor this artifact even though men and women may have\nsimilar true volumetric bone density levels.\nRegion of interest\nOsteopenia Osteoporosis\nPrevalence* 95% CI Millions Prevalence* 95% CI Millions\nAll races\nNonHispanic whites\nNonHispanic blacks\nMexican Americans\n* Prevalences shown in parenthesis are age-adjusted to the 1980 U.S. census population.\n Pertain to unadjusted prevalences.\n Based on the average of undercount-adjusted population estimates from the March 1990 and March 1993 Current Population Surveys.\nRegion of interest\nOsteopenia Osteoporosis\nFemale cutoffs Male cutoffs Female cutoffs Male cutoffs\n* Not age-adjusted. Age-adjusted prevalances equal unadjusted prevalences except where noted with dagger.\n Age-adjusted prevalence is 1% higher.\nAnother unresolved issue in using the WHO criteria is\nthe appropriate cutoff values for minority men and women.\nWe applied cutpoints based on young whites to the minority\ngroups in this study, as well as previously,(10) because the\nrelationship between femur BMD and hip fracture risk has\nbeen studied exclusively in whites to date.(1,2,3) Prevalences\nof osteoporosis for whites and blacks in our study are\nsimilar to estimated lifetime fracture risks for these\ngroups.(17) We also found a similar ratio of age-adjusted\nprevalences in whites versus blacks in our study as the\nwhite\u00adblack fracture ratio reported by others.(7,28 \u00ad31) Both\nof these findings provide some indirect support for our\napproach. The validity of applying white cutoffs to MAs is\nmore difficult to assess, since very little data are available\non hip fracture rates in U.S. Hispanics. The few studies\ndone to date suggest that they have lower rates than\nwhites.(31\u00ad33) We found lower prevalences of osteopenia in\nMAs than in NHWs, but prevalences of osteoporosis in\nwomen were similar in the two groups (prevalences in men\nwere too small to compare reliably). However, due to their\nhigher mean BMD levels,(16) cutoffs based on young MAs\nwould have resulted in even higher prevalences in this\ngroup compared with NHW, which is less consistent with\nfracture patterns. Finally, fracture risk is also influenced by\nother, non-BMD factors such as hip axis length, muscle\nstrength, or falls, which may differ among race or ethnic\nOther issues noted previously in our application of the\nguidelines to older women in the U.S., such as accounting\nfor the individual's age in addition to BMD when consid-\nering risk,(40 \u00ad 42) still remain to be resolved. In addition, as\nnoted previously,(10) the young white male and female ref-\nerence groups in our study had a lower mean BMD and\nhigher SD than the male and female references group\nprovided by the densitometer manufacturer,(43) so that\nfewer individuals will be identified with low bone mass than\nif the manufacturer's cutoff values are used. Finally, it\nshould be noted that the absolute BMD values presented in\nthis paper, including the cutoff values, are densitometer-\nspecific and cannot be compared directly with BMD results\nfrom other DEXA instruments without a conversion factor\nfor the femur.\nLimitations of this study include potential nonresponse\nbias in the sample and the exclusion of institutionalized\npeople from the NHANES III sample frame. Nonresponse\nbias in the sample who came to the mobile exam centers in\nNHANES III is reduced to some extent by a nonresponse\nadjustment factor included in the calculation of the sample\nweights.(11,14) After applying these weighting adjustments,\ndifferences between examinees and nonexaminees were mi-\nmobile exam centers did not have usable BMD data, and\nthis nonresponse is not addressed by the sample weight\nadjustments. A nonresponse bias study for phase 1 of\nNHANES III found differences in weight, self-reported\nhealth status, and vitamin supplement use between those\nwith bone density data compared with the examined sample\nas a whole.(45) We explored nonresponse bias among the\nyears to assess the possible impact on means and preva-\nlences. Nonrespondents in the young female reference\ngroup weighed more than respondents, but mean total fe-\nmur BMD did not differ greatly when imputed data for\nnonrespondents (based on their body weight) were added\nto the dataset (i.e., 0.941 g/cm2 based on actual and imputed\ndata vs. 0.937 g/cm2 based on actual data only). Likewise,\ndifferences in weight, self-reported health status, and age\nbetween respondents and nonrespondents age 50 years\ndid not appear to impact greatly the prevalence estimates\n(e.g., 16% of women and 2\u00ad4% of men had total femur\nosteoporosis whether based on actual and imputed data or\non the actual data alone). Studies to assess the effect of\nmissing BMD data in phase 2 are continuing as more data\nbecome available from NHANES III. It is also important to\nnote that the prevalence estimates in this study pertain only\nto the noninstitutionalized U.S. population. Institutional-\nized persons may have lower bone mass,(46,47) so the prev-\nalence of low bone mass in the total U.S. population is\nprobably higher than our estimates.\nIn conclusion, the number of older U.S. adults with low\nfemur BMD using the WHO criteria is substantial. Most of\nthese are women, but the number of older U.S. men with\nosteopenia or osteoporosis of the femur is not small, re-\ngardless of whether these are defined with male or female\ncutoffs. Much remains to be learned about BMD and frac-\nture risk in men, but it is likely that men with osteopenia\nand osteoporosis would benefit from taking steps to prevent\nfurther bone loss.\n"
