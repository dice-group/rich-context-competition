This study elucidates the relationship between SES and self-rated health (SRH) in four societies of East Asia: China, Japan, South\nKorea and Taiwan. Methods: We used the data from the East Asian Social Survey 2006, which consists of nationally representative samples\nfrom each of the four countries. Logistic regression analysis of SRH was performed using four standardized SES indices (income, education,\noccupation and class identification) as explanatory variables to compare the degree of association of each SES index with SRH. Results: A\ntotal of 8120 respondents in the age range of 20\u00ad69 years were analysed. Overall, social gradients in health were observed in the East Asian\nsocieties. In China, South Korea and Taiwan, three of the four SES indices showed a statistically significant association for both male and\nfemale groups. In Japan, except class identification, no other SES index showed a significant relationship with SRH. With regard to the\ndifferences between the SES indices, class identification exhibited the strongest association with SRH, while occupational class displayed the\nweakest association. Conclusion: Our study results indicate that Japan has low levels of health inequality compared to other East Asian\ncountries. Furthermore, an index of occupational classes may be insufficient to explain health inequalities in East Asia.\n.................................................................................................................................\nIntroduction\nSince publication of the `Black Report',1 it has been well established that\na social gradient in health is a common feature of societies in Western\ncountries.2,3 In addition, many studies have compared among Western\ncountries4\u00ad8 as well as between Western and Asian countries.9 These\nstudies have shown that the relationship between socio-economic status\n(SES) and health varies in strength among countries according to the SES\nindex that was used in the study.\nHowever, cross-national comparative studies of East Asian countries\nare rare, although some have assessed SES and health in individual\ncountries of the region.10\u00ad15 In addition, cross-national studies that\ninclude samples from East Asia--for example, Martikainen et al.9--\noften do not use nationally representative samples. To our knowledge,\na data set drawn from a standardized questionnaire that facilitates a\ncross-national comparison has so far been limited in East Asia.\nUsing cross-national surveys, Yamaoka16 investigated the relationship\nbetween SES, social capital at the individual level, and health across Japan,\nSouth Korea, Singapore, five areas in mainland China and Taiwan.\nHowever, as Yamaoka's work focused mainly on general trends in the\nrelationships between social capital and health, the differences in SES and\nhealth among East Asian countries may need further consideration. For\nexample, the categorization criteria used for SES indices were unclear,\nand this makes it difficult to compare the relationships between SES and\nhealth across these countries.\nMoreover, some previous studies question the interchangeability of\nSES indices, such as income, education and occupational class, and\nhave shown that the association between SES and health can vary by\nSES indices, health outcomes and countries.17,18 To explore which SES\nindices are important for health in East Asian societies, we need appro-\npriate data and methods that allow for the comparison among countries\nand between SES indices.\nThis study uses the East Asian Social Survey (EASS) 2006 data set, a\ncross-national survey consisting of nationally representative samples from\nChina, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. We sought to compare the SES\ngradient in health among the four societies using the index of self-rated\nhealth (SRH) and standardized SES indices of income, education,\noccupation and class identification.\nMethods\nData\nData used in this study are from the EASS 2006 provided by the EASS\nData Archive. The archive provides data from respondents whose\nidentities are undisclosed, for the secondary analysis of cross-national\ncomparisons in East Asia. These data consist of a common module, set\ninto a General Social Survey (GSS) type questionnaire, which is a\nnationally representative sample survey from each of the four societies.\nSamples were selected by multistage stratified random sampling.\nRespondents were surveyed from June to December 2006 by interview\nin China, South Korea and Taiwan and by interview and placement\n(self-administered) methods in Japan. Valid response rates were 38.5%\nDetails for EASS data are described at the EASS website (http://eass.info).\nSES and health in East Asia 47\nEASS 2006 includes information on income, education, occupation\nand class identification, allowing us to compare the validity of the SES\nindex to analyse the social gradient in health. Given that many studies\nhave claimed the necessity of using cross-national data but instead have\nactually only used limited samples from specific regions or organizations,\nthe EASS 2006 is considered a valuable data set that consists of represen-\ntative samples from four East Asian countries. The target ages of samples\nKorea and 19 or over in Taiwan. This study used the sample drawn from\n20- to 69-year olds, a common age group throughout the four countries.\nAccordingly, 8120 samples were included in our analysis.\nDependent variable: SRH\nThe dependent variable was SRH. Respondents were asked, `How would\nyou rate your health?' and were prompted to answer on a 5-point scale\nfrom 1 (Very good) to 5 (Very bad). We dichotomized responses into 0\nand 1, with 0 representing responses 1 through 3 (`good') and 1 repre-\nsenting responses 4 and 5 (`poor').\nIndependent variable: SES index\nOur study made use of four items of the SES index: income, education,\noccupation as an objective measure and class identification as a subjective\nmeasure. These original variables were recoded and categorized as\nfollows.\nIncome\nEquivalent income was calculated by dividing household income by the\nsquare root of the number of family members. However, household\nincomes in Japan and Taiwan were categorical values (19 and 26\ncategories, respectively); therefore, we took the median value of each\ncategory for our calculation. The equivalent incomes we calculated\nwere categorized into four levels (lowest, low, high and highest) by\nusing one-half of the median equivalent income as a cut-off value in\neach country. This follows the criteria that are often used as a\ndefinition of relative poverty.19\nEducation\nHighest education level was used as an indicator of education. The\noriginal variable had six categories: 0 (No formal qualification), 1\n(lowest formal qualification), 2 (Above lowest qualification), 3 (Higher\nsecondary completed), 4 (Above higher secondary level) and 5\n(University degree completed). We converted the original six categories\ninto four (lowest, low, high, highest) by combining categories 0, 1 and 2\ninto one category. This procedure seemed reasonable, considering that\nsome countries have few or no applicable cases for the three lower\ncategories. Particularly, there were no valid cases of 0 (No formal quali-\nfication) and 2 (Above lowest qualification) in Japan.\nOccupational class\nspondents' occupational information. By using this detailed occupational\ncode, we applied internationally comparable occupational measures,\nnamely the International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status\n(ISEI).21,22 On the basis of the ISEI score, all samples from the four\ncountries were categorized into a quartile (lowest, low, high and\nhighest), not in each countries but within whole samples.\nClass identification\nIn addition to the aforementioned three objective measures of SES, we\nemployed a subjective variable of class identification. `Top-bottom\nself-placement' on a 10-point scale can be used in Japan, South Korea\nand Taiwan and `Class identification' on a 5-point scale is available in\nChina. The question involving `Top-bottom self-placement' was: `In our\nsociety there are groups which tend to be towards the top and groups\nwhich tend to be towards the bottom. Below is a scale that runs from\nbottom to top. Where would you put yourself on this scale?' Available\nchoices were numerical on a 10-point scale from 1 (lowest) to 10\n(highest). The question regarding `Class identification' asked: `In your\nopinion, which level do you and your family respectively belong to in\nterms of your personal and family socio-economic status? (Choose one in\neach column)'. Choices were 1 (Upper level), 2 (Upper middle level),\n3 (Middle level), 4 (Lower middle level) and 5 (Lower level). As the class\nidentification variable for China we used responses to questions about\n`Your socio-economic status' rather than `Your family's socio-economic\nstatus'.\nWe converted the 10-point scale of `Top-bottom self-placement' into a\n5-point scale and merged the two highest categories of class identification\nbecause of the smaller number of applicable cases in these groups.\nMoreover, we reversed the scale of `Class identification' and merged\nthe two highest categories. As a result, we obtained four levels (lowest,\nlow, high and highest) of class identification index for analysis.\nStandardized score of SES\nIn order to make comparisons of magnitude of the association with\ndifferent SES indices among different populations (by countries and\ngender), we converted each category of the SES to a standardized score\nranging between 0 and 1 according to the proportion of population in\neach SES index. This score is used for calculating the Slope Index of\nInequality (SII) or the Relative Index of Inequality (RII) based on the\ncumulative proportion of the SES categories and the midpoint of its\nrange.23 The score represents the mean relative rank of the SES\ncategories, and it can be considered as a standardized SES index that\nenables comparison among different indices.\nModels\nWe performed a logistic regression analysis using SRH as a dependent\nvariable and each standardized score of SES as an independent variable.\nThe odds ratio (OR) estimated from the analysis shows the ratio of the\nrisk to be poor SRH for the top rank (standardized SES score = 1)\ncompared to that for the bottom rank (standardized SES score = 0).\nThe lower the OR of the standardized SES score, the steeper the social\ngradient in health. In the model 1, each of the four standardized SES\nscores was included separately, while in the model 2 all the SES scores\nwere included simultaneously, for the mutual adjustment. In order to\nargue whether there were regional and gender differences in the social\ngradient in health, we applied the models using the samples stratified by\nthe four countries and by gender. Our control variable was age,\n69). The basic statistics of variables are shown in table 1.\nResults\nTable 2 shows the results of logistic regression analysis.\nOn the whole, the model 1 showed strong associations between SES\nand SRH for South Korean males and for Taiwanese males and females.\nThe associations for Japanese males and females were weak. In the three\ncountries other than Japan, three of the four SES were statistically sig-\nnificant for both gender groups. As for differences in SES indices, class\nidentification had the strongest relationship to SRH, while occupation\nhad the weakest association. In regard to gender difference, in many\ncountries and SES indices, ORs were lower for the male population\nthan the female population, suggesting the social gradient in health\ntends to be steeper for males. However, the differences were not large.\nIn the analysis of samples from China, all SES indices showed a sig-\nnificant relationship with SRH, except for occupation among males and\neducation among females. Income showed the strongest relationship,\nin females. Except for the remarkable relationship between class identifi-\n0.64), no other significant relationships were confirmed in Japan in male\nand female samples. In South Korean samples, all SES indices except for\noccupation exhibited significant relationships. Especially, estimated ORs\n48 European Journal of Public Health\nin South Korean males were the lowest among the four countries' male\nof males were lower than for females. In Taiwan, income, education and\nclass identification showed a similar relationship with SRH as in South\nKorea. However, among the eight stratified populations, Taiwanese\nfour countries' female populations.\nTable 2 also includes the results of the model 2 in which the four SES\nindices were adjusted simultaneously. Only a few indices were significant-\nly related to SRH in each country. Those were income for Chinese males\nDiscussion\nSummary of findings\nFindings obtained from our analysis were as follows. Overall, a social\ngradient in health is apparent in East Asia. The magnitude of the rela-\ntionship with SRH varies in SES indices; class identification was the\nstrongest, while occupation was the weakest and least clear in many\npopulation groups. As for differences among countries, Japan showed\nthe weakest relationship between SRH and SES among the four\ncountries. The differences observed in SES indices and in countries\nwere common for males and females, although the association between\nSES and SRH was somewhat stronger among males.\nTo date, a social gradient in SRH has been reported from a\ncross-national data set that targeted a number of countries--for\nexample the World Values Survey24,25 or the World Health Survey.26\nConsidering that previous studies showed the association between SRH\nand both income and education across the world, it is not surprising that\nthe same tendency was observed from EASS 2006. However, since\ncross-national surveys like World Values Survey often have difficulties\nin the translation of the question and unified survey methods27, it would\nbe important to accumulate the findings from multiple data sources,\nparticularly in East Asia, where cross-national data has been of limited\navailability. Moreover, we should look carefully at the differences among\ncountries in the same region. Therefore, our results highlight that the\nmagnitude of associations between SRH and SES were often varied by the\ndefinitions of SES indices and by countries.\nClass identification\nRegardless of gender and countries, class identification showed strong\nassociation with SRH, suggesting this index can be highly sensitive to\nSRH. In addition to the objective status at the time the survey was\nconducted, class identification may also reflect more complex elements,\nsuch as SES of the respondent's parents or anxiety about future\nuncertainties.\nSince both class identification and SRH can be regarded as subjective\nindices, there is a possibility of reverse causation; that is, poor SRH of the\nrespondents may cause lower ratings for their class identification. In\naddition, the variable we used in this study was not ideal. For\ncross-national comparison, it must be noted that the original question\nand scale used in China differed from that used for other countries, and\nthat the question inquiring about respondents' subjective identification\nmay be affected by the translation. Although we are aware that creating\none variable from two similar but originally different questions may be\nproblematic, this was the last expedient for considering subjective\nmeasure in our analysis.\nAt any rate, the results imply that each objective index alone is\ninadequate for constituting the dimensions of SES. Wilkinson28,29 has\nTable 1 Basic characteristics of respondents\nn (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%)\nSRH\nAge\nSex\nIncome\nEducation\nOccupation\nIdentification\nSES and health in East Asia 49\ndocumented a psycho-social process through which people lower on the\nsocial ladder reduce their health by comparing themselves with higher\nsocial classes. Class identification, as a subjective index of SES, can be\nconsidered to be a measurement that reflects the psycho-social process\nbetter than other objective indices such as income or education.\nOccupational classifications\nAs typified by the `Black Report' in the UK, occupational class often has\nbeen used in studies as a standard for social gradients in health because it\naccurately reflects social classes in Western societies. However, in the\npresent study the relationship between occupational class and SRH was\nunclear and showed a moderate gradient compared to other SES indices.\nAlthough it is possible that the result might be caused by a validity of the\nscoring procedure of ISEI, the result was basically the same when we used\nother classifications (the results are not shown).\nAnother possible explanation may be that occupational classifications\ndo not fully reflect social classes in an East Asian context. `Occupation' as\nreferred to here indicates, `what they do at work' and is generally\nunderstood as the division between white-collar/blue-collar or manual/\nnon-manual labour. However, factors other than occupation might be\nimportant for reflecting East Asian social classes, especially compared to\nWestern societies, because company size, position at work, employment\nperiod or types of job contract may affect workers' income, job security,\nbenefits and social security. Arita30 made cross-national comparisons of\noccupation and social stratification in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan\nbased on data surveyed in 2005. He discovered that employment status as\nwell as the size and type of company are as important as occupation for\nunderstanding social stratification in East Asia. For the status and identity\nof workers, `which company they belong to' might be more important\nthan `what they do at work.'\nJapan\nCompared with samples from the other three countries, the social\ngradient in SRH was moderate in Japan, except for the case of class\nidentification. Several possibilities might account for this.\nOne possible explanation, at least from a comparative perspective, may\nbe that social inequalities and their influence on health in Japan have\nremained low. In the past, Japan has been regarded as an egalitarian\ncountry that has achieved the world's highest standards in longevity.\nAccording to Kagamimori et al.,15 who reviewed previous studies\nregarding SES and health in Japan, socio-economic differences in\nmortality, morbidity and risk factors are not uniformly small in Japan,\nbut they do occur to a smaller degree than in the US or Europe. Results of\nour study indicate that Japan exhibits relatively small health inequalities,\nnot only in comparison with the US and Europe but also among East\nAsian countries.\nHowever, it must be noted that the response preference to SRH may\nvary between countries. It is believed that the Japanese generally prefer to\nTable 2 OR and 95% CI of standardized SES scores for reporting poor SRH (estimated by logistic regression analysis)\nMale\nChina\nJapan\nSouth Korea\nTaiwan\nFemale\nChina\nJapan\nSouth Korea\nTaiwan\n50 European Journal of Public Health\ngive a midpoint or close-to-the-middle response rather than express\ndefinite agreement or disagreement.31 The wording of the response\ncategories from `Very good' to `Very bad' with the qualifier `very'\nmight have biased the response toward the midpoint especially for\nJapanese respondents.\nIn fact, table 1 shows that SRH was the `best' in Japan, however if we\nused a different cut-off point (only responses 1 and 2 representing\n`good'), Japan would be the `worst' because of the larger share of\nresponse 3 (midpoint). The weakest association of SRH and SES in\nJapan was the same; even if we used a different cut-off point (the result\nis not shown). Therefore, the Japanese response preference might explain\nboth the `best' SRH status and its weakest association with SES.\nHowever, considering the observed strong association in class identi-\nfication, this response preference alone is not convincing enough to\nexplain the results. We need further research on the effect of response\nscale for an analysis of SRH, especially in cross-national comparison.\nLimitations\nLow response rate, especially in China and Taiwan, was a limitation of\nthis study, although the age distribution of the respondents was very\nsimilar to that of the national population in China and Taiwan (the\ndifference was up to the 3.1 percentage point at 10 years intervals of\nage). In general, it can be considered that the samples with low SES\nmay tend to have a lower response rate, thus causing the SES gradient\nin health to be underestimated. However, this tendency cannot explain\nwhy Japan exhibits the weakest association, because the response rate in\nJapan was relatively high among the four countries.\nAnother limitation in the present study may be that the target\npopulation for analysis was limited to 20- to -69-year olds. The older\npeople might exhibit a different pattern in the relationship between SRH\nand SES (cf. Nakaya and Dorling32), and the country differences in life\nexpectancy may also influence the result. This needs to be assessed in the\nfuture by using the upcoming EASS data set.\n"
