    "abstract": "Abstract\nLimited data exists on alcohol, illicit drug, tobacco, gambling, and non-\nmarital\nsexual intercourse among Muslim college students; behaviors which are either\nprohibited or strongly discouraged in Islam. To provide preliminary baseline data,\nwe assessed prevalence of these risk behaviors using a U.S. 2001 national college\nin Muslim families. The past year prevalence of risk behaviors among the 135\nand 30.4% for gambling. Of the never married students, 53.8% reported ever hav-\ning had sexual intercourse. Gender differences were significant for tobacco use\nand gambling. Most Muslim students (58.5%) reported engaging in at least one\nrisk behavior during the past year, of whom a majority (77.6%) engaged in two or\nmore behaviors. In multivariate analyses, higher religiosity was protective against\nany past year risk behavior. These findings provide critical baseline data on risk\nbehaviors among Muslim students. They also underscore the need for updated\ninformation and prevention programs.\n6 Sameera Ahmed, Wahiba Abu-Ras, and Cynthia Arfken\n",

Risk behaviors refer to those behaviors\nwhich have the potential to negatively impact the psychosocial aspect of suc-\ncessful adolescent development (Jessor, 1991). Risk behaviors, such as alcohol\nand drug use, can have long term negative impact on public health and have\nbeen associated with negative mental health outcomes for the individual (Glied\nStroup, & Gerberding, 2004). Despite potential negative impact of risk behav-\niors, it is theorized that engaging in such behaviors are often purposive and\nmay serve a number of functions such as increasing peer acceptance, assisting\nin individuation from family as well as community, and coping with anxiety\n(Jessor, 1991). Thus, risk behaviors are rarely isolated but are often interrelated\nand functional, highlighting the need for prevention efforts to focus on lifestyle\nrather than individual risk behavior (Jessor, 1991).\nSuch a conceptualization of risk behavior may be particularly helpful in un-\nderstanding religious minority emerging adults. As a religious minority in the\nU.S., American Muslim college students may encounter and navigate between\nmultiple groups' behavioral expectations (i.e., societal, religious, and cultural)\nas well as experience additional stressors (e.g., discrimination) (Ahmed, 2012).\nThese stressors coupled with a decrease in parental monitoring, common\namong college students, may result in an increase in the prevalence of risk be-\nhaviors among Muslim college students. Previous research suggests differences\nin prevalence of risk behaviors among ethnic minorities (Factor, Kawachi, &\nWilliams, 2011), which could potentially be extended to religious minorities.\nHowever, many young people do not engage in risk behaviors due to the\nbuffering effects of protective factors. Religious involvement and religiosity,\nacross religious affiliations, has found to serve as a protective factor against risk\nbehaviors such as substance use (Ghandour, Karam, & Maalouf, 2009; Luczak,\n& Windle, 2002; Michalak, Trocki, & Bond, 2007). Still, it is also possible that\nreligiosity may simultaneously serve as both a protective and risk factor, as\nevidenced by Zaleski and Schiaffino (2000), who observed that increased reli-\ngious identification protected against initiation of sexual activity but resulted\nin increased risk of unprotected sex among those who were sexually active.\nCurrently, scant data exist on the prevalence of risk behaviors among U.S.\nMuslim college students. In our review of published literature, we found stud-\nies on risk behaviors of middle and high school Muslim students in Western\nPrevalence of Risk Behaviors among U.S. Muslim College Students 7\nJayakody et al., 2011), but none on college students. The limited information\nthat exists suggests that Muslim students report low prevalence of most be-\n2011), with female Muslim students reporting even lower prevalence than male\nMuslim students (e.g., Islam & Johnson, 2003). Furthermore, previous research\ndid not explore whether Muslim engagement in risk behaviors were isolated\nincidents of risk, or a cluster of behaviors, as suggested by Jessor (1991). Only\none study, to our knowledge, explored the protective influence of Islam on a\nrisk behavior in Western nations (Islam & Johnson, 2003).\nIslam, Muslims and Risk behaviors\nAlcohol and Drug Use. Alcohol use is strictly prohibited in Islam and any use\nwould be considered risky. However, alcohol use in the U.S. is prevalent with\n63.3% of fulltime U.S. college students reporting past month use (Substance\nAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMSHA], 2010), with\nmales reporting greater prevalence than females (O'Malley & Johnston, 2002).\nOur previous work using secondary data analysis of a large representative col-\nlege survey found 46.6% of Muslim college students drank alcohol in the past\nyear (Abu-Ras, Ahmed, & Arfken, 2010). However, in a pilot respondent-driven\nsampling study of Muslim students at one university, 9% reported lifetime alco-\nhol use (Arfken, Ahmed, & Abu-Ras, 2013). The differences may reflect tempo-\nral trends, characteristics of the sample, or the context of one university. To the\nauthors' knowledge, there are no other studies on the prevalence of alcohol use\namong Muslim college students in the U.S.\nSimilar to alcohol, illicit drug use is prohibited in Islam and any use by a\nMuslim is considered risky behavior. Among U.S. college students, 22.0% of full\ntime college students reported using illicit drugs at least once in the past month\n(SAMHSA, 2010), with use higher among males (Johnston, O'Malley, Bach-\nman, & Schulenburg, 2012). To the authors' knowledge, there are no studies\non illicit drug use among U.S. Muslim college students. The most comparable\nstudy on illicit drug use among Muslim religious minorities living in Western\ncountries was conducted in Glasgow, Scotland among a cohort of South Asian\nhigh school students and their classmates (Bradby & Williams, 2006). Of the\nSouth Asians in the sample 79% of students identified as Muslim. Four years\nyears old), reported lifetime illicit drug use (Bradby & Williams, 2006). How-\never, there is no mention if the participants were enrolled in college.\nTobacco Use. Within Islam, tobacco use can be considered a risk behavior\n8 Sameera Ahmed, Wahiba Abu-Ras, and Cynthia Arfken\nas religious scholars' views on tobacco use range from prohibited to strongly\ndisliked (makruh). Anecdotally, due to the growing knowledge of the nega-\ntive health impact of tobacco, scholars are increasingly prohibiting tobacco\nuse. Past month cigarette use among U.S. full time college students was 24.8 %\n(SAMHSA, 2010), with no difference observed between genders (Johnston et\ndriven sampling of U.S. Muslim college stu-\ndents at one university found 50% had ever consumed tobacco in some form,\nincluding cigarettes and waterpipe (Abu-\nabove mentioned study on South Asian Muslims from Glasgow, Scotland, 24%\nof males and 14% females reported being current smokers (Bradby & Williams,\nGambling. In Islam, any form of gambling is prohibited and considered a\nrisk behavior. Researchers have referred to gambling as an emerging risk be-\nhavior among American college students, with a past year prevalence ranging\nfrom 35% to 42%, with males reporting greater prevalence (Atkinson, Sharp,\nthe authors' knowledge, there are no studies investigating gambling behavior\namong Muslim college students in the U.S. or Europe.\nSexual Behaviors. In Islam any form of non-\nmarital intimacy, including\nsexual intercourse, is prohibited and considered a risk behavior. In the U.S.,\nthe lifetime prevalence of non-\nmarital sexual intercourse was 76% of college\nstudents according to one study; however gender differences were not report-\ned (Higgins, Mullinax, Trussell, Davidson, & Moore, 2011). To the authors'\nknowledge, there are no studies reporting the lifetime prevalence of non-\nmarital sexual intercourse among U.S. or European Muslim college students.\nObjectives\nThe focus of this study is to address the current gap in literature on the preva-\nlence of risk behaviors among U.S. Muslims college students by establishing\na baseline for more detailed future research. We expand upon our previous\nanalysis examining alcohol use among U.S. Muslim college students (Abu-\nRas\net al., 2010) to explore illicit drug use, tobacco use, gambling, and non-\nmarital\nintercourse. Based upon the literature among younger European Muslim stu-\ndents, we hypothesize: (a) that the prevalence of risk behaviors among U.S.\nMuslim college students will be low (b) that the prevalence of risk behaviors\namong female Muslim college students will be lower than males, (c) those who\nengage in risk behavior are more likely to engage in more than one risk behav-\nior, and (d) students reporting religious activities as important will have lower\nprevalence of risk behaviors.\nPrevalence of Risk Behaviors among U.S. Muslim College Students 9\nMethod\nSurvey\nFor this analysis, we used data from the 2001 Harvard School of Public Health\nCollege Alcohol Study's (CAS) public access database (Wechsler, 2001, http://\nwww.icpsr.umich.edu). The database contains surveys from a national sample\nof students at accredited four-\nyear colleges and universities (119 colleges in 38\nstates and the District of Columbia). Additional information regarding sam-\npling and methodology are available elsewhere (Wechsler, Lee, Kuo, & Lee,\nMeasures\nreported measures of alcohol, tobacco, il-\nlicit drug use, gambling, and sexual behaviors. The survey also included infor-\nmation on religious heritage of the students and one question on religiosity.\nDemographic measures were also used to contextualize the findings.\nDemographic variables. Variables assessed included: age, gender, mari-\ntal status, ethnicity and living arrangements. Racial identification was limited\nto one of the following choices: White, Black/African American, Asian/Pacific\nIslander, Native American, and Other. Ethnicities, such Arab or Persian, were\nnot a choice for participants. Living arrangements were assessed by asking par-\nticipants, \"With whom do you currently live?\" Participants could select one or\nmore of the following responses: alone, roommates or housemates, spouse or\npartner, parents or other relatives.\nReligious heritage and religiosity. Religious heritage was determined\nbased on the participant's response to the question, \"In what religion were you\nraised?\" The answers included six categories: \"None\", \"Catholicism,\" \"Judaism\",\n\"Islam\", \"Protestantism\", and \"Other\". We refer to students who answered \"Is-\nlam\" as Muslim students and students who responded with any other category\nas Non-\nMuslim students. No questions were asked about current affiliation or\nspecific religious behavior. Religiosity was assessed based on the participant's\nself-\nreport on the importance of participating in religious activities in college\nwith answers range from \"Very Important\", \"Important\", \"Somewhat Important\"\nto \"Not at all Important\". No other question in the survey assessed religiosity.\nAlcohol. Participants were asked, \"When did you last have a drink (that is\nmore than just a few sips)?\" The questionnaire instructed participants to define\na \"drink\" in equivalent amounts of alcohol: a 12-\nmL) bottle or can of\nbeer, a 4-\nmL) glass of wine, a 12-\nmL) bottle or can of wine\n10 Sameera Ahmed, Wahiba Abu-Ras, and Cynthia Arfken\ncooler, or a shot (1.25 oz or 37mL) of liquor, either straight or in a mixed drink.\nPossible responses included: \"I have never had a drink\"; \"not in the past year\";\n\"more than 30 days ago, but in the past year\"; \"more than a week ago, but in\nthe past 30 days\"; and \"within the last week\". For the purpose of this study, the\nresponses were collapsed into the following categories: ever, past year, never.\nIn addition, participants were also asked \"How old were you when you first\ndrank alcohol regularly.\" Three Muslim students did not answer the alcohol use\nquestion.\nIllicit drug use. Illicit drug use was assessed by asking participants \"How\noften, if ever, have you used any of the drugs listed below?\" Participants were\nspecifically asked about the following substances: marijuana, crack or other\nforms of cocaine, barbiturates (e.g. Seconal, Nembutal, downs, or Yellow Jack-\nets), Ritalin/Dexedrine/Adderall, other amphetamines (e.g. methamphet-\namines, crystal meth, speed, uppers, ups), tranquilizers (e.g. Valium, Librium,\nXanax, Ativan, Klonopin), heroin, other opiate-\ntype prescription drugs (e.g.,\nCodeine, Morphine, Demerol, Percodan, Percocet, Vicodin, Darvon, Darvo-\ncet), LSD, other psychedelics or hallucinogens (e.g., mushrooms, mescaline, or\nPCP), ecstasy (MDMA), other \"party drugs\" (e.g., Ketamine, Special K, GHB),\nanabolic steroids (either injections like Depo-\ntestosterone or Durbolin, or pills\nlike Anadrol, Dianabol, or Winstrol), and other performance-\nenhancing drugs\n(e.g., growth hormone, diuretics, fluid pills, ephedrine). Participants were in-\nstructed not to include drugs that were being taken under physician supervi-\nsion. Information on marijuana use was obtained by asking participants, \"How\noften, if ever, have you used marijuana\", and \"How old were you when you first\nused marijuana.\" For all illicit drugs, possible responses included: never used,\nused but NOT in past 12 months, used but NOT in the past 30 days, used in the\npast 30 days. For the purpose of this study, the responses were collapsed into\nthe following categories: ever, past year, and never. Eight Muslim students did\nnot answer the question on illicit drugs but all Muslim students answered the\nquestions on marijuana. The eight Muslim students with missing information\non illicit drugs reported that they had not used marijuana.\nTobacco use. Tobacco use was measured by asking participants \"How of-\nten, if ever, have you used any of the drugs listed below?\" Participants were\nasked about their use of the following forms of tobacco: cigarettes, cigar, pipe\ntobacco, bidis and chewing tobacco, dip, or snuff. Waterpipe use was not in-\ncluded. Participants were also asked specifically about their cigarette use. \"How\noften, if ever, have you used cigarettes,\" and \"How old were you when you first\nused cigarettes.\" Possible responses for tobacco use were: never used, used but\nNOT in past 12 months, used but NOT in the past 30 days, used in the past\n30 days. For the purpose of this study, the responses were collapsed into the\nfollowing categories: ever, past year, never. One Muslim student did not an-\nswer question about tobacco use, and eight Muslim students did not answer the\nPrevalence of Risk Behaviors among U.S. Muslim College Students 11\nquestions about cigarette use. The one Muslim student with missing informa-\ntion on tobacco use reported no cigarette use.\nGambling. Students were questioned about their gambling behaviors in\nthe past school year only. The following forms of gambling were specifically\nqueried: betting on professional sports; betting on college sports; betting on\nhorse or dog races; casino gambling; betting on the lottery or the \"numbers;\"\ninternet betting or gambling; and betting with a bookie, card, dice, or other\ngames of chance while at school. Possible responses included: never, a few\ntimes a year, monthly but not weekly, weekly but not daily, daily. For the pur-\npose of this study, the responses were collapsed into the following categories:\never, past year, never. Data was missing for two Muslim participants.\nSexual activity. Participants were asked, \"If you have ever been sexually\nactive, has it been with . . .\" Participants were given the following choices: \"I\nhave never been sexually active\", \"opposite sex\", \"same sex partner\", or \"both\nopposite and same sex partners\". For the purpose of this study, the responses\nwere collapsed into the following categories: ever been sexually active or never.\nIn addition, participants were asked, \"When you have sexual intercourse, how\noften do you and your partner use a condom.\" Possible responses include: nev-\ner, rarely, sometimes, and always. For the purpose of this study the responses\nwere collapsed into always or sometimes/rarely/never. Analysis was limited to\nparticipants who said they had never been married. Data was missing for 16\nMuslim students.\nProcedures\nThe original researchers mailed the survey to students beginning in February\ndents returning the survey as late as August 2001. The reported response rate\nData analysis\nThe analysis used weights provided by the original researchers. Descriptive\nstatistics were used to describe the sample characteristics and prevalence of\nrisky behaviors. Chi-\nsquare analyses were conducted to test for associations in\nsample characteristics and prevalence by gender. For bivariate analysis, each\nrisk behavior was analyzed individually, which may result in slightly different\nsample sizes due to missing data. For non-\nmarital intercourse, the analysis was\nlimited to students who had never been married. Imputation was not conduct-\ned as less than 10% of the data was missing and the sample size was relatively\nsmall. For multivariate analysis, logistic regression analysis was used to assess\nthe independent associations with any past year risk taking behavior. Data was\n12 Sameera Ahmed, Wahiba Abu-Ras, and Cynthia Arfken\nmissing for 2 Muslim students. Associations were summarized as odds ratios\n(OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).\nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nin Muslim families.

As previously reported (Abu-\nlim students had consumed alcohol in the past year, with no significant differ-\nence by gender (males 44.8% versus females 47.7%) (Table 1). For the Muslim\nstudents who reported drinking, 60% reporting regular alcohol use began at\nage 18 or older. To contextualize these results, past year alcohol consumption\namong non-\nMuslim students was 80.7%, with over half of individuals (56.1%)\nbeginning regular consumption at age 18 or older. Among the non-\nMuslim\nstudents, no gender difference in prevalence of alcohol consumption was ob-\nserved. More in depth analysis of patterns of alcohol use among U.S. Muslim\ncollege students within this sample can be found in Abu-\nIllicit Drug Use. Muslim students past year prevalence of illicit drug use\nwas 24.6% with no significant difference by gender (males 27.9% versus fe-\nmales 19.1%). Similarly, past year reported marijuana use was 23.9%, with no\nstatistically significant gender difference (males 27.6% and females 17.0%). For\nthe Muslim students reporting marijuana use, 52.4% indicated their first expe-\nrience using marijuana occurred before 18 years of age.

To contextualize\nthese findings, non-\nMuslim students, 42.1% reported past year prevalence of\ngambling, with males reporting greater prevalence than females (52% males\nning gambling before 18 years of age.\nSexual behaviors.

Among sexually active,\nnever married Muslim students, 66% never to sometimes use condoms dur-\ning non-\nmarital intercourse. A comparison of condom use by gender among\nnever-\nmarried Muslims was not conducted due to small sample size. Informa-\ntion about the age of first sexual intercourse experience was not collected by\nthe original researchers and thus could not be examined. To contextualize the\npresent findings, prevalence of lifetime sexual intercourse among never mar-\nried non-\nMuslim students was 68.2%, with no gender difference observed.

Of the individu-\nals engaging in at least one risk behavior during the past year, 77.6% engaged\nin two or more risk behaviors. To contextualize these findings, 86.6% of non-\nMuslims students engaged in at least one risk behavior within the past year. Of\nthose engaging in past year risk behavior, 72.0% engaged in two or more risk\nbehaviors.\nLogistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the association of\nmeasures with any of the four past year risk behaviors (alcohol, illicit drugs,\nPrevalence of Risk Behaviors among U.S. Muslim College Students 15\ntobacco, and gambling). Sexual intercourse among non-\nmarried students was\nnot included due to lack of data on past year behavior. The independent vari-\nables included in the model were gender, living at home (to reflect greater pa-\nrental monitoring), and religiosity. In the analysis religiosity was found to be\nindependently associated with absence from any risk behaviors in the past year\n(p <.05). Each one point increase (on the four point religiosity measure) in\nreligiosity was protective against past year risk taking behavior (OR= 0.60, 95%\nCI 0.43\u00ad0.84). Living at home was in the direction of being protective (OR=\nTo contextualize the results, the model was then conducted with non-\nMuslim\ngaging in any risk behavior in the past year\nDiscussion\nThis analysis extends our prior research on alcohol use among U.S. Muslim\ncollege students (Abu-\nRas et al., 2010) to other risk behaviors and provides\ncritically needed baseline data on risk behaviors among U.S. Muslim college\nstudents.\nOf concern, U.S. Muslim college students reported high levels of risk be-\nhaviors, given religious prohibitions. The current findings were comparable to\nthe prevalence rates of illicit drug and tobacco use found among 18\u00ad20 year\nold Scottish Muslims (Bradby & Williams, 2006). In addition, our hypothesis\nregarding statistical differences based on gender was only supported for gam-\nbling and tobacco. Consistent with our hypothesis, students who engaged in\nany risk behavior often engaged in multiple risk behaviors. These findings pro-\nvide additional support to Jessor's (1991) notion that risk behaviors often occur\nas interrelated clusters. Furthermore, the analysis supports our hypothesis for\nthe protective effect of religiosity against risk behaviors (Haber, Grant, Jacob,\nTable 2. Number of risk behaviors reported by Muslim students by lifetime and past\nyear prevalence\nNumber of behaviors Past year Male Female\nNote: Risk behaviors included alcohol, illicit drugs, tobacco, and gambling.\n16 Sameera Ahmed, Wahiba Abu-Ras, and Cynthia Arfken\n& Bond, 2007). However, it is important to note that even Muslim students\nwho ranked religious activities as very important also reported risk behaviors.\nAlthough this analysis highlights the prevalence of certain risk behaviors,\nit cannot address the mediators (e.g., sources of influence, situational factors,\nfunctional aspects of risk) that influence engaging in risk behaviors. Hence,\nadditional studies identifying mediators of risk behaviors in American Muslim\ncollege students are needed. Potential mediators and moderators include family\ndynamics (e.g., parent-\nchild communication, family cohesion, parental moni-\ntoring, and parenting style), peer relationships (e.g., influence, socialization,\npeer risk behaviors), neighborhood context (e.g., presence/absence of Muslims\nand community cohesion), religious community (e.g., degree of interaction,\ncongregational culture), and societal context (e.g., group status, perceived dis-\ncrimination). In addition, further studies are needed to address mental health\noutcomes of engaging in risk behaviors.\nThis present study highlights that Muslim students are not immune to\nengaging in risk behaviors and, like other emerging adults, often engage in\na cluster of risk behaviors (Jessor, 1991). At present, evidence-\nbased preven-\ntion services specifically tailored to Muslim students do not exist. As such, it is\nimperative that comprehensive, religiously and culturally sensitive prevention\nand intervention programs be developed to address risk behavior life styles for\nthis population. From prior research (Arfken, Owens, & Said, 2012), we know\nthat at least some Muslim students exposed to prevention programs in high\nschool considered them irrelevant to their community due to lack of known\nprevalence estimates of Muslims engaging in risk behaviors. Developed tai-\nlored programs must target both males and females, given the lack of signifi-\ncant difference in prevalence rates, however researchers should make sure to\nexplore possible difference in engagement and circumstances that could be\nincorporated in applied settings. The findings also highlight the need to bet-\nter understand the functional purpose of the risk behavior with the realiza-\ntion that risk behavior occurs in a larger social context, as suggested by Jessor\n(1991). For example if a student's use of substance is recreational, a different\nintervention approach would be used as opposed to student's using substance\nas a coping mechanism to deal with stress. Importantly, these interventions\nmust begin at the minimum in high school and continue throughout college\nbecause a substantial proportion of students reported first time use of regular\ndrinking, marijuana, and cigarette use prior to college.\nDespite the numerous implications of the current findings, there are also\nsome limitations. Specifically, the sample size of Muslim students was small\nand analysis was limited by using a secondary data source. As such we did\nnot know country of birth/immigration status of participants, current religious\npractice, and presence of other Muslims on campus. In addition, the data was\nPrevalence of Risk Behaviors among U.S. Muslim College Students 17\nincreased attention on Muslims in America. Lastly, water pipe smoking, an\nincreasingly popular risk taking behavior among college students in general\nand Muslim students in particular (Abu-\nthe public access database and should be included as a form of tobacco use in\nfuture studies. These limitations emphasize the need for a new survey to update\nand expand the present findings to develop appropriately tailored prevention\nprograms.\nReferences\nAbu-\nRas, W., Ahmed, S., & Arfken, C.
