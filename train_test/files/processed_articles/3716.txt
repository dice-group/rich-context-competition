    "abstract": "Abstract\nSocial identity voting (SIV) is a new model of voting behavior based on the principles of social identity theory. We\nintroduce and use this model to analyze roll call votes for the 35th through 112th US Congresses. Comparing out-of-sample\naccuracy of SIV and Poole and Rosenthal's Weighted NOMINAL Three-step Estimation (W-NOMINATE), we find that\nSIV performs better than the one- or two-dimensional W-NOMINATE model and that generally, W-NOMINATE needs\nup to 10 dimensions to produce accuracy comparable to that of SIV. The differences between SIV and W-NOMINATE\nare further clarified in three case studies: first, a longitudinal examination of all Congresses; second, an analysis of the\n112th House of Representatives; and third, a study of the Tea Party caucus in the 112th House of Representatives. Each\nstudy sheds new light on the potential motivations driving voting behavior, supporting our assertion that the SIV and\nW-NOMINATE models provide two distinct approaches to understanding voting records. SIV, with its emphasis on\npolitical identity derived from group membership, expresses combinations of individual and group preferences which\ncontribute to legislators' ideological classifications.\n",

This\nobservation provides the foundation for many models in\npolitical science used to determine ideological categories.\nSpatial models, most notably the NOMINAL Three-step\nEstimation (NOMINATE) models (Poole and Rosenthal,\n1985), place both legislators and roll call votes into a spa-\ntial context where the relative positions of the legislators\nand the votes create the categories. In these systems, the\npositions of legislators, which are given as ideal points in\nthe geometric space, serve as ideological markers.\nOne of the main findings in the NOMINATE literature\nis that for most of the history of the United States Congress,\none-dimensional models reflecting our colloquial \"liberal/\nconservative\" dichotomy are sufficient to explain the great\nmajority of roll call votes. The ideal points of the legisla-\ntors on this ideological axis are estimated from the roll call\nvotes. As such, they serve as summarizations of various\nforces that can influence the legislators' votes, including\npersonal preferences, party preferences, and constituent\nopinion. Ideological groups are then determined by\ngroupings of ideal points. In this way, ideal point methods\n(spatial models) derive ideological categorizations from\nthe characteristics of the individuals.\nWe take a different approach to the problem of identify-\ning ideology and sorting legislators into ideological catego-\nries. While spatial models summarize legislators as ideal\npoints measured relative to the positions of votes, our\nmodel, which we call social identity voting (SIV), views\nthe legislator's ideology in terms of a weighted sum of the\nideologies of the groups to which they belong. This is moti-\nvated by social identity theory (SIT), which posits that an\nindividual's social identity is determined by the collection\nof groups to which the individual belongs (for a review, see\nHogg, 2006). Legislators derive utility from voting with the\nThe social identity voting model: Ideology\nand community structures\nScott D Pauls1, Greg Leibon1 and Daniel Rockmore2\n Keywords\nCongress, roll call voting, legislative behavior, nominate\n1Department of Mathematics, Dartmouth College, Hanover, USA\nDepartment of Mathematics, Dartmouth College, Hanover, USA;\nDepartment of Computer Science, Dartmouth College, Hanover,\nUSA; The Santa Fe Institute, USA\nCorresponding author:\nScott D Pauls, Department of Mathematics, Dartmouth College, 6188\nEmail: scott.pauls@dartmouth.edu\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \ngroups to which they belong and from voting against those\nto which they do not belong. As a consequence, legislators\nwill select groups with ideologies consistent with their\nown; subsequently, as group members, they face pressure\nto conform in ideology to the majority ideology of that\ngroup. Furthermore, in this model groups benefit from\nlarger memberships, as determining the outcome of votes\ngenerates political power for the group and detracts from\nother groups' political power.\nThus, the SIT framework suggests a model \u00ad the social\nidentity voting model \u00ad whose components can be esti-\nmated from roll call data. First, we create the communities\nusing the roll call votes to group legislators together.\nSecond, we use the resulting mean votes of the communi-\nties to define their common ideological positions. Doing\nthis allows the communities to evolve over time, without\nimposing groupings and labels that may not be universally\nappropriate. We make one exception to this principle \u00ad we\nfix the party caucuses as the dominant communities for all\nthe Congresses we study. We do this for three reasons. First,\nin the United States, party affiliation carries a great deal of\ninformation and weight \u00ad parties often provide infrastruc-\nture and money to support campaigns, and within Congress,\nthe legislative structure is defined entirely in the context of\nparty caucuses. Second, parties form the largest coherent\nideological units in a two-party system. Third, applying the\nalgorithms described below to the data yields partisan com-\nmunities broadly consistent with other results in the litera-\nture in almost all years (e.g. Porter et al., 2005; Waugh\nTo detect the communities, we use a variant of the parti-\ntion decoupling method (PDM) (Leibon et al., 2008)\napplied to roll call data. In this setting, the PDM detects and\ndelineates multiple partitions of a legislature at different\nscales or layers. A first layer in the data is defined by party.\nAfter identifying and removing the effect of the first layer\nin the voting record, we derive the second layer from the\nresidual data. This layer reveals ideological groupings that\ncannot be explained by party identification.\nSIV applied to the US Congresses yields three main\nfindings. First, SIV outperforms W-NOMINATE with\nrespect to out-of-sample accuracy when we restrict to one-\nor two-dimensional spatial models. In order to obtain com-\nparable accuracy for the Senate, W-NOMINATE requires\n10 dimensions. Even with this, in contrast to higher dimen-\nsions in the W-NOMINATE model, the SIV clusters are\nreadily interpretable. For the House of Representatives, the\ntwo are comparable except for two periods \u00ad after the Civil\none layer based on party and substantially outperforms\nW-NOMINATE. Second, we find that in many instances\nSIV and W-NOMINATE contain different information:\nthere is no clear mapping from ideal points to SIV groups.\nThis indicates that SIV is a new explanatory model for ide-\nological voting behavior. Third, SIV reveals interesting and\nsubtle details about the divisions between groups. In our\nanalysis of the 112th House of Representatives, for instance,\nwhile some issues reveal groups whose members are defy-\ning their party's position, we find that several groups are\ndifferentiated from each other by journal votes taken in\nadvance of contentious votes. Following Patty (2013), we\ninterpret this as intra-party signaling, demonstrating a\nmilder break from party orthodoxy for some groups than\nothers. Building on this new fine-grained ability to differ-\nentiate inter-party signals, we also use SIV to understand\nthe extent to which the Tea Party is an independent ideo-\nlogical unit within the Republican Party at that time. We\nfind that it is not, but that it is rather two dominant, ideo-\nlogically distinct subgroups defined in opposition to the\nbroader party. In total, these findings demonstrate the nov-\nelty and utility of SIV.\nTheoretical underpinnings\nGroup membership and SIT\nSIT is a theoretical framework for understanding group\ndynamics. The foundation of SIT (Tajfel and Turner, 1979,\n1986) rests on a distinction between personal and social\nidentities, where social identity is largely constructed\nthrough group membership. Central to SIT is the thesis that\nin social situations, social identity is the dominant force in\ndecision-making and action.\nThere is a large volume of literature on the construc-\ntion and maintenance of social identity through group\naffiliation (see Hogg, 2006), and while the full properties\nof these mechanisms are not yet settled, there are some\nbasic principles that form a common foundation. First,\nindividuals aim to create and sustain a positive social\nidentity through group membership. Positivity is derived\nfrom favorable comparisons between the individual's\ngroup(s) and groups to which the individual does not\nbelong. Thus, individuals are motivated both to accentu-\nate the differences between groups and raise the reputa-\ntion of their group(s). Second, once formed, groups can\nexhibit in-group bias (Messick and Mackie, 1989; Mullen\net al., 1992). Bias can be both a result and a source of\ngroup cohesion, although it is not a necessary accompani-\nThese kinds of ideas carry over to the political arena. In\npolitical bodies, social identity is formed through member-\nship in many different types of groups, including political\nparties, caucuses, and committees. We posit that the public\nideology of a legislator is largely determined by their social\nidentity, which in turn is at least in part articulated through\ntheir group memberships. Not all group memberships are\nexplicitly declared; some can be revealed through action.\nTo this end, the theoretical underpinnings of SIT motivate\nthe articulation of group structure derived from legislator's\nvotes.\nPauls et al. 3\nSocial identity voting\nSIV, based on SIT, thus emphasizes the construction of\nsocial identity and its role in ideological identification. SIV\nis built by delineating groups within the legislative body,\nwhich in turn enables the estimation of weights measuring\ndegrees of group membership for each legislator. To com-\nport with the other aspects of SIT, groups must be coherent\nand facilitate intergroup comparison, which we accomplish\nby assigning utility to the legislator based on his/her actions\nwith respect to the group's positions. We assess the utility\nthrough the observation of public votes: legislators will\nhave high utility when voting in line with their group(s) and\nlow utility when voting against them. A central component\nof group reputation is political power \u00ad large, ideologically\ncoherent groups have greater ability to determine the out-\ncome of votes. Thus, groups strive to maximize member-\nship without compromising their ideological profiles.\nThe NOMINATE family of models makes the strong\nbasic assumption that both legislators and bills can be\nembedded into a spatial landscape where their relative posi-\ntions determine voting behavior. One of the key novel fea-\ntures of SIV is a relaxation of this assumption: in SIV,\nlegislators'votes are determined by the potentially conflict-\ning ideological markers of the groups to which they belong.\nMethodology\nFormal presentation of SIV\nThe vote data of legislator l who casts n votes is recorded\nas a voting vector v l\nj j\nn\n( )\n{ }\n. Given a grouping of legisla-\ntors, an ideological motivation is a voting vector\nM v v\ni\ni\nn\ni\n= ...\n( )\nwhere i k\n ...\n{ , , }\n1 is an ideological group label, and vj\ni is\ndefined as the mean of group i's votes on vote j.\nThe motivations Mi are the ideological markers of the\ndifferent groups present in the legislative body. To each leg-\nislator l m\n ...\n{ , , }\n1 we associate a vector of weights,\nw l w l w l\nk\n( ) ( ( ), , ( ))\n= ...\n1 indicating the degree of the legis-\nlator's membership in the different groups. Note that a\nweight can be fractional \u00ad a legislator need not be \"all in\"\nor \"all out\" with respect to a given group.\nFor a given vote, v l\nj ( ) , the legislator's utility is given by:\nu v l w l v l v\nj\ni\ni j j\ni\n( ) ( ) ( ( ) )\n( ) = -\nwhere ( )\nx is a smooth positive symmetric function with a\nmaximum at x = 0 and decaying to 0 as x  2 . Over all\nvotes, the total utility for legislator l is given by:\nU l w l v l v\ni j\ni j j\ni\n( ) = -\n\n,\n( ) ( ( ) ).\nIt is easy to maximize utility if there are no other constraints\nby simply placing each legislator into his or her own ideo-\nlogical group. Then, the motivation of such a (singleton)\ngroup is simply the vote vector of the legislator, and utility\nis maximized. But this group consisting of a single legisla-\ntor has little political power. Consequently, we require\ngroups which are simultaneously large and have high total\nutility over all members to balance political power and\ncoherent ideology.\nAfter computing a set of motivations and weights, we\nhave an ideological representation of each legislator and an\napproximation of their voting pattern according to their\nideology:\n( ( ), , ( )) .\nv l v l w l M\nn\ni\ni i\n1 ...  ( )\nThe initial application of SIV produces the components of\nthis representation: the partitioning of the legislators into\ngroups, the ideological marker associated with those\ngroups, and the social identity of the legislators derived\nfrom group membership. Moreover, we can iterate SIV\nmultiple times, revealing different overlapping layers of\nideological composition.\nDetermining the elements of SIV\nThere are many different methods to find the groups that\ndefine SIV. At one extreme, we can fix the groupings\naccording to information external to the roll call votes. At\nthe other, the groupings are determined from iterative\nanalysis of the roll call data itself. The latter thus shares\nsome similarities with NOMINATE, where the compo-\nnents of the model are estimated directly from the data.\nWe take something of a hybrid approach and construct a\nSIV model with two layers, one fixed a priori and the\nother derived from data. The groups forming the first\nlayer, G G\n, ,\n{ } are the major party caucuses. From these\nwe compute the components of the corresponding motiva-\ntions (vote vectors)\nv\nG\nv l\nj\ni\ni l G\nj\ni\n=\n\n\nThe associated weight vector is the least squares solution to\nw\nw\nv\nv\nk\nk n\n...\n( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Research and Politics \nWe then consider the residual data set consisting of the vot-\ning data not accounted for in the approximation given by\nequation (4):\nv l v l v l v l w l M\nn n\ni\ni i\n \n( ) ...\n( )= ... - ( )\n\n, , ( ) ( ( ), , ( )) . (7)\nThe various pieces of the model for a second layer are now\ncalculated using a network theoretic formulation wherein\nlegislators are linked together by edges weighted by the\nsimilarity of their voting records. Groupings are derived as\nan optimal partitioning of the network. We use spectral\nclustering to partition the legislator set into k clus-\nters,{ ,..., },\nG Gk\n1 which serve as the communities within\nthe legislature. These are subsidiary to the explicit party\nstructure. Using (5) and (6), we calculate the motivations\nand weights for the second layer.\nSpectral clustering requires two parameters: k, the num-\nber of clusters, and r, a parameter internal to the algorithm\nrelated to the innate dimensionality of the data. To estimate\nthese, we use a holdout validation framework often used in\nmachine learning. We form a testing and training set from\nthe data. Using the training data to fit the model, we then\npredict the testing data and measure the out-of-sample\naccuracy of the model:\noos\nv l sign w l M\nmn\nl\nm\ni\nk\ni i\n=\n( )- ( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n= =\n \n\n\n,\n( ) = and is zero otherwise. To estimate the\nparameters, we record the out-of-sample accuracy for\nk r\n, { , , }\n ...\n1 10 and select the k and r which achieve the\nhighest average accuracy over 10 holdout trials with the\ntesting data in each trial comprising 10% of the entire data\nset. If multiple pairs achieve the highest average accuracy,\nwe choose the one with smallest k and, if necessary, small-\nest r. SIV is a version of the PDM (Leibon et al., 2008). The\nonly modification is the deliberate choice of the first layer.\nOthers have used singular value decomposition (Porter\nZhang et al., 2008) for network community detection in\nvoting data. These methods differ by optimizing different\nobjective functions than does spectral clustering, but the\nmain difference between SIV and these approaches is the\nconstruction of a subsidiary layer of overlapping structure.\nFor purposes of exposition and considerations of length,\ntechnical details, code, and instructions for its use appear in\nAppendix 1.\nData\nWe retrieved roll call vote data for the 35th through 112th\nsessions of the US Congress from Keith Poole's Voteview\nwebsite. In order to make comparable the results of SIV to\nW-NOMINATE, we use the standard pre-processing used\nin W-NOMINATE's implementation in R: votes with less\nthan 2.5% of the total legislative body in the minority are\nremoved, as are legislators who voted on less than two\nthirds of the votes. For SIV, we code \"yea\" votes as 1,\nabstentions as 0, and \"nay\" votes as -1.\nResults and discussion\nOne layer SIV: Party labeling carries a great deal\nof information\nThe one-layer model, encoding only party identification,\nhas excellent out-of-sample accuracy (median 84.3% in the\nHouse of Representatives and 80.6% in the Senate). This\nresult is consistent with literature that demonstrates party as\na dominant factor in determining voting patterns and fur-\nther supports our choice of the fixed first layer.\nSIV outperforms W-NOMINATE\nIn out-of-sample accuracy, SIV generally performs as well\nor better than high dimensional NOMINATE models.1\nComparing SIV to what Poole calls the \"substantive dimen-\nwe find a persistent small advantage to using SIV. Figure 1\nshows the out-of-sample accuracy of the SIV one- and two-\nlayer models (denoted SIV-1 and SIV-2) and that of\nW-NOMINATE with at most 10 dimensions (WN-10).\nTable 1 shows the quartiles of the differences between the\nout-of-sampleaccuracyofSIVvs.WN-10orW-NOMINATE\nwith one or two dimensions (WN-2). In the Senate, SIV-2\nalways outperforms SIV-1 and WN-2, while it is very simi-\nlar to WN-10. The picture in the House of Representatives is\nmore complicated. In two periods, after the Civil War\nperforms all models and the better of the two SIV models\noutperforms both WN-10 and WN-2.\nThis is a new contribution to the discussion of the\ndimensionality of roll call data (Cragg and Donald, 1997;\ndimensionality has been lively at times, but the general\nconclusion that has emerged is that one or two substantive\ndimensions explain virtually everything for US Congresses\n(Poole, 2005). Additional dimensions seem to be \"largely\n64), a point of view justified in part by the difficulty\nresearchers have finding apt descriptions for the higher\ndimensions (the first dimension is interpreted in terms of\neconomic issues and the second, when relevant, is tied to\nsocial issues). In distinction, SIV provides a different set of\ndimensions which, when used predictively, significantly\nbest WN-2 in out-of-sample accuracy. These dimensions\nPauls et al. 5\nare also interpretable: the contrast between the motivation\nvectors of the groups provides ideological markers with\nwhich to discriminate between them.\nBoth W-NOMINATE and SIV have a comparable\nnumber of variables that are estimated or calculated from\nthe roll call data. We can encode the W-NOMINATE\nmodel with d dimensions using d m n\n( )\n+ real numbers\n\u00ad coordinates of the ideal points for the m legislators and\ncutting hyperplanes for the n votes. We can summarize\nSIV with ( )( )\nk m n real numbers where k is the\nnumber of groups in the second layer. The difference in\nthis measure of complexity for W-NOMINATE and that\nof SIV is ( ( ))( )\nd k m n\n- + +\n2 . Over all the legislatures we\nstudy, this quantity is at times positive and negative, but\nthe median of the difference is 0 with quartiles{ , , }\nConsequently we have that, generally, models with com-\nparable accuracy have similar complexity. Thus, if\nout-of-sample accuracy and interpretability of the dimen-\nsions are desirable, the use of SIV is warranted.\nThe 112th House of Representatives: a closer look\nA detailed analysis of the 112th House shows two things:\nSIV and W-NOMINATE uncover different information\nabout the legislators, and the motivation vectors give natu-\nral interpretations of the SIV groups.\nTo start, suppose the two models contain similar infor-\nmation. We then would expect similar W-NOMINATE\nscores for SIV group members and score separation between\ndifferent groups. We find some groups follow this pattern, but\nothers are not well-characterized by W-NOMINATE scores.\nFigure 2 shows groups 1\u00ad6 are bipartisan and contain mem-\nbers with very disparate W-NOMINATE scores. Groups 7\u00ad9\nare partisan \u00ad one group of moderate Democrats (7) and two\nRepublican groups (8, 9) \u00ad and while their W-NOMINATE\nscores are fairly coherent, they still overlap with those of\nother groups. Table 2 in Appendix 2 lists group membership.\nWe can assess what distinguishes these groups by con-\nsidering their motivation vectors. To compare group i and\ngroup j, we record the 10 votes that best distinguish the two\ngroups: those with the highest value of v v\nk\ni\nk\nj\n \n- . Most of\nthese votes concern appropriations for various agencies\n(Defense; Homeland Security; Interior; Transportation;\nEnergy and Water; and Agriculture, Rural Development\nand the Food and Drug Administration [FDA]). Other bills\ndeal with foreign policy, including votes relating to the War\nPowers Act and withdrawing troops from Afghanistan and\nLibya. Some groups are distinguished by their positions on\nissues such as concealed carry laws, the Education Science\nReform Act, tax relief, small business investment, a bill\nconcerning asthma inhaler regulation, and the repeal of the\nFigure 1.

Table 3 in Appendix 2 provides com-\nplete details.\nA significant number of these votes are journal votes, or\nprocedural votes that record the day's work. Some have\nargued these journal votes serve a vital organization role as\na form of intra-party signaling: party leaders call for such\nvotes as a type of quorum call in advance of important or\ncontroversial votes to ensure that a sufficient number of\ntheir votes are present before proceeding (Patty, 2013;\nAppendix 2 details the Congressional votes before\nwhich the journal votes were called. While these votes\nappeared as distinguishing votes between several pairs of\ngroups, they were most significant in distinguishing Group\n1 from 2, and 2 from 3 and 4. In these cases, the journal\nvotes give a measure of the members' loyalty to their party.\nFor example, most of the members of Group 1 vote with\ntheir party on both the journal votes and the associated con-\ntroversial votes that follow, while most of the members of\nGroup 2 vote against their party on journal votes but vote\nwith their party during the subsequent Congressional vote.\nOther than journal votes, these groups are defined pri-\nmarily along issues of appropriations and matters of\nnational security. This illumination of ideological structure\nis not directly available via spatial models such as\nW-NOMINATE, where one would need to look directly at\nthese votes and the groups of legislators to parse the same\ninformation. One of the strengths of SIV over such spatial\nmodels is the ability to identify such groups and their moti-\nvation vectors automatically.\nCase study: the Tea Party caucus\nThe \"Tea Party\" is a faction of the Republican Party that, in\nthe 112th Congress, formalized its membership as a recog-\nnized caucus. Using SIV, we can analyze the ideological\nstructure of the Tea Party to understand the extent to which\nit is an independent ideological faction.\nIn the 112th House, the Tea Party caucus splits mainly\nbetween groups 3 and 9, with 40% of the Caucus in each of\nthese groups. Group 3 includes Representatives King\n(R-IA), Bachmann (R-MN), and Gohmert (R-TX), while 9\nincludes Miller (R-CA), Barton (R-TX), and Sessions\n(R-TX). Figure 3 shows a version of Figure 2 with the\nDemocrats removed and the Tea Party caucus highlighted.\nAs noted, groups are separated from one another on issues\nof foreign policy and Defense \u00ad specifically on a resolution\nto remove troops from Libya, appropriations for the\nDepartment of Defense, and bills funding military con-\nstruction and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\nThey are also separated by two other bills: a bill funding the\nDepartment of Agriculture, Rural Development and the\nFDA, and one concerning the Education Sciences Reform\nAct. The clearest delineation between the Tea Party por-\ntions of the groups comes on an amendment to the Defense\nAppropriations bill: the majority of the Tea Party members\nin Group 9 voted against the amendment, while a majority\nof those in Group 3 voted for it.\nIf the Tea Party caucus is an independent ideological\nunit, we would expect that the Tea Party would largely\naggregate against other factions of the Republican Party\nafter we remove the first layer. Instead, it breaks down\ninto two primary groups with particular issues separating\nthe subsets. While the one-dimensional W-NOMINATE\nmodel also demonstrates that the Tea Party is diffused\nthroughout the Republican Party, with ideal points scat-\ntered through the ranks of the entire party, the one-dimen-\nsional model misses the multiple party divisions that only\nthe SIV approach can illuminate.\nConclusion\nSIV provides a new method for understanding ideological\ncategorizations based on voting behavior. SIV solidly out-\nperforms W-NOMINATE in out-of-sample accuracy when\nthe latter is restricted to one or two dimensions. Allowing\nW-NOMINATE to use more dimensions brings its out-\nof-sample accuracy roughly in line with SIV, but at a cost:\nhigher dimensions in NOMINATE models are difficult to\ninterpret, while the groups in SIV are easily compared\nthrough differences in their motivation vectors.\nSIV expresses ideological information differently from\nW-NOMINATE, providing an alternate analysis comple-\nmentary to the analysis of ideal points. A direct comparison\nof the two for the 112th House of Representatives shows\nthat there is no clear mapping between the two descriptions,\na result that is typical of many sessions of Congress.\nConsequently, we conclude that SIV and W-NOMINATE\nprovide different but equally valid methods for distilling\nroll call voting data into manageable representations.\nThree investigations demonstrate the potential useful-\nness of SIV over NOMINATE. We identify two periods \u00ad\n\u00ad where the one-layer SIV model, using only party identifi-\ncation, outperforms W-NOMINATE significantly. This\nindicates that situating legislators with respect to the mean\nvoting vectors of the two party caucuses is in those periods\na superior predictive model. Second, we discover that sev-\neral groups distinguished from each other by journal votes\nin the 112th House. These votes, interpreted as within-party\nsignaling near contentious votes, show that SIV detects\nfractures within party caucuses on two levels. When journal\nvotes distinguish groups, the groups are loyal to their cau-\ncus, but are willing to send discordant signals to their lead-\nership. On the other hand, when the actual votes distinguish\ngroups, we see groups whose members are publicly and\ndirectly voting against the party wishes. Lastly, an SIV-\ndirected analysis of the Tea Party in the 112th House shows\na split into essentially two subgroups which have issue-\nspecific ideological differences, demonstrating that the Tea\n8 Research and Politics \nParty is not an ideologically distinct faction of the\nRepublican Party.\nNone of these findings are easily derived from the ideal\npoints produced by W-NOMINATE. By focusing on group\nrather than individual preference, SIV provides a new lens\nthrough which to view the forces that impact legislators'\nvoting behaviors and motivations.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by AFOSR under award\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nNote\n1.

We approach this by viewing\nthe legislature as a network (a collection of nodes and edges) and re-formulating the maximization problem as a problem\nof clustering on the network. The legislators are the network nodes. These are connected by edges weighted according to\nthe similarity of their voting records. For m legislators, this is represented by an m x m adjacency matrix A whose (i,j)\nentry is the edge weight (possibly zero) between legislators i and j.\nIn this setting the utility maximization is re-framed as the graph (network) cut problem: finding a partition of the net-\nwork into k groups that simultaneously maximizes a within-group total edge weight measure while minimizing the total\nin social network analysis (Girvan and Newman, 2002), we use the solution of the graph cut problem to identify communi-\nties within a larger group.\nFormally, a solution to the graph cut problem is a partition of the nodes into k groups {G1\n, ..., Gk\n} so that\ncut G G\nvol G\ni i\ni\ni\nk ( )\n( )\n,\n=\n\nis minimized, where cut G G A\ni i ab\na G b G\ni\nk\ni i\n( , )\n,\n=\n \n=\n\n\nand vol G A\ni ab\nb\nn\na Gii\n( ) =\n=\n\n\n\nSolving the graph cut problem for this network therefore breaks legislators into groups that have high intra-group vot-\ning agreement but where intergroup voting agreement is relatively low (making cut G G\ni i\n( , ) small), while keeping the\ngroups relatively large (making the vol Gi\n( ) large).\nThe similarity structure that we use is derived from a modification of the correlation of the voting profiles of the legisla-\ntors. Given two voting vectors (1\n(i),...,n\n(j)) and 1\n(j),...,n\n(j)), we define the correlation between them as\nc\nv i v j\nn s s\nij\nk i k j\nk\nn\ni j\n=\n- -\n-\n=\n ( ( ) ) ( ( ) )\n( )\n\u00b5 \u00b5\nwhere \u00b5i\n, \u00b5j\nand si\n,sj\nare the means and standard deviations of the voting vectors (respectively). We further define aij\n=e-d\nij\nwhere dij\n=sin (cos-1(cij\n)). This is a standard transformation of a similarity matrix (von Luxburg, 2007; see the case of \"the\nfully connected graph\") into an adjacency matrix.\nAlas, solving the (combinatorial) graph cut problem is NP-hard (all known algorithms have Non-Polynomial compu-\ntational complexity) \u00ad essentially, it requires evaluating all possible partitionings into k groups \u00ad and as such is intractable.\nShi and Malik (2000) showed that the exact solution can be approximated by the solution to a \"nearby\" eigenvector/\neigenvalue (\"spectral\") problem. We use this spectral clustering algorithm to determine the groups within the legislature.\nThe details can be found in von Luxburg's excellent tutorial (2007).\nAppendix 2\nThe journal votes of the 112th Congress distinguishing the clusters came before other votes of import to the body,\nincluding:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA);\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The Cut, Cap, and Balance Act;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The Small Business Tax Cut Act;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Appropriations for Defense and the Department of the Interior;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Various regulatory bills;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Act;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission Act.\n10 Research and Politics \nTable 2.
