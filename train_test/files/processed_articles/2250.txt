Serum\nuric acid (SUA) was determined by the spectrophotometric method. No\nstatistically significant relationships were found between SUA and intelli-\ngence quotientor average academic grades. There was also no significant\ndifference in SUA among the overachievers (higher grade point average\nthan predictedby IQ)as comparedto the underachievers.\nHistorians have made the interesting obser-\nvation that men of genius and distinction are\nfrequently troubled with gout (1,2) which in\nturn is associated with high concentrations of\nuric acid in blood serum. This has led one au-\nthor to speculate that serum uric acid (SUA)\nmight correlate with intellectual vigor because\nuric acid shares with certain other purines the\ncapacity to stimulate the cerebral cortex (2). It\nwas of interest, therefore, to study the relation-\nship of SUA and achievement in high school.\nAn entire community, Tecumseh, Mich, has been under\nSupported in part by the Center for Research in Diseases\nof the Heart, Circulation and Related Disorders, University\nof Michigan under Program Project Grant HE-09814 from\nthe National Heart and Lung Institute, Research Grant\nHE-127.55, both of The National Institutes of Health, US\nPublic Health Service.

Serum uric acid determinations have been\ndone as one of the laboratory procedures during each of the\nthree examinations of the participants in this study.\nApproximately 83%of the eligible residents in `I'ecumseh\nparticipated in the second series of examinations. The re-\nspondents came to the clinic, usually in families, wherr a\nblood sample was drawn. The subjects were not necessarily\nin a postabsorptive state. Serum urir acid was determined\nby the spectrophotometric method of Liddle rf a1 (4).\nMost of the children who attend the Tecumseh, Michi-\ngan High School are also participants in the health study.\nThe numbers at each age, for whom uric acid determina-\ntions and other data were available, are shown in Table 1.\nThe data on their high school achievement was obtained\nschool year. Since the second series of laboratory exam-\ntween drawing blood and recording the scholastic data var-\nied from 9 to 38 months. Moreover, SUA increases with age\nat this time of life, particularly in boys (5). Therefore. a\nnegative correlation between data collection interval and\nSUA was anticipated. An analysis of the data confirmed our\nsuspicions and the relationship was found to be linear.\nRegression analysis within each age-sex group was there-\nfore used to correct the SUA for months since clinic visit.\nThe average correction was small, only 0.24 mg%. The\nmeans and standard deviations of the corrected SUA are\nshown in Table I. The corrected SUA values were used in\nall analyses.\nThe following data were obtained from the school\nrecords:\nI.

Rank in graduatingclass (seniors only)\nAll of the analyses were done separately for boys and\ngirls and by class standing (Freshman, Sophomore, etc). In\nall but one set of the analyses, the xztechnic was employed\nto study the relationships. When this technic is used, it is\npossible to add the separate xz analyses (one for each sex-\nclass standing group) and the degrees of freedom to study\nthe overall relationships. The one exception to using a x2\nanalysis was in the case of class standing at graduation for\nseniors. The relationship of class standing and SUA was\nstudied by means of the rank order correlation\ncoefficient (Rho).\nRESULTS\nThe relationship between SUA and IQ was\nstudied in freshman girls by recording the num-\nber of girls a) whose SUA and IQ values placed\nthem in the upper half of both distributions; b)\nthe number of girls who fell in the upper half of\nthe SUA and lower half of the IQ distributions;\nc) the number in the lower half of the SUA and\nupper half of the IQ distributions and finally d)\nthe number of girls in the lower half of both\nSUA and IQ distributions. Under the hypothe-\nsis that there is no relationship between SUA\nand IQ, one should expect about one-fourth of\nthe subjects in each quadrant (the theoretical or\nexpected frequencies). These theoretical fre-\nquencies were compared to the observed fre-\nquencies. If the discrepancy is large, the x2 will\nbe large and evidence is available that the hy-\npothesis of no relationship between SUA and\nIQ is not tenable. In the analysis for freshmen\ngirls, the x2 was only 0.65; hence, insufficient\nevidence is available to reject the hypothesis.\nThus, one cannot conclude that SUA and IQ\nare related. The same procedure was followed\nwith the other class standing groups, for boys\nand girls. In no individual group or in the over-\nall analysis was the x2 sufficiently large to sug-\ngest a relationship between SUA and IQ.\nSimilar analyses were done for the relation-\nship between academic grade point average\nsuch sex-class standing group was divided into\napproximately three equal subgroups on the ba-\nsic of academic grades. This provided a series of\n2 x 3 x2analyses. Again, none of the x2analyses\nwere statistically significant. Thus, there was\nno evidence that those children who received\nhigh grades had significantly different SUA\nthan those whose grades were low.\nStudents in the 1966 graduating class were\nranked on the basis of their academic grades\nover the 4 years in high school. These children\nwere also ranked on the basis of their SUA. The\nrank order correlations for the 56 male seniors\ndicating no significant relationship between\nSUA and rank in class. Since there is evidence\nthat SUA is related to drive (6),it was thought\nthat perhaps SUA might be higher in over-\nachievers in school. Therefore, the seniors were\nranked by IQ and academic grades (males and\nfemales, separately) and the difference in these\ntwo ranks calculated for each child. Thus, an\noverachiever would be one whose rank in class\nwas considerably higher than his rank in IQ.\nThe differences in ranks were in turn ranked\nwith highest positive difference (grade rank-IQ\nrank) at the top. These ranks were then com-\npared with rank in SUA. The coefficients were\nAs another way of studying the over-\nachievers, the children who were in the lower\nhalf of the IQdistribution in each class standing\ngroup were studied separately. These children\nwith the lower IQs were tabulated as to\nwhether they were in the upper or lower SUA\ndistributions and the upper or lower grade\npoint distributions. This provided a 2 x 2 x2\ntable for each class standing group. The result-\ning insignificant x2 analyses indicated that the\nSUA of overachievers was no different from\nthat of underachievers.\nDISCUSSION\nThe lack of relationship between IQ and\nSUA is not surprising. Although one investiga-\ntor (7) reported a statistically significant corre-\nlation between these two variables among 817\narmy recruits, the relationship was very weak (r\nfound a low correlation between IQ and SUA in\nhigh school students (r = .lo). Dunn et af (10)\nreported no correlation between SUA and col-\nlege aptitude scores among 96 medical students.\nSimilarly, these investigators reported SUA to\nbe unrelated to grades (high school and medical\nstudents) or the difference in grades and apti-\ntude (medical students). Our results were much\nthe same. On the other hand Kasl and col-\nleagues (8) reported a significant but low corre-\nlation coefficient (r = .20) between SUA and\ngrade point average in high school students.\nFurthermore, when IQ and grade point average\nwere compared, the overachievers (higher\ngrade point average than would be predicted by\nIQ had significantly higher SUA than under-\nachievers. These results are different from\nours. However, Kasl et a\nf (11) reported vary-\ning results in different high schools and postu-\nlated that the school setting and selection of\nsubjects may be factors of importance. Evi-\ndence for a relationship of SUA to psycho-\nsocial factors has been reviewed in other\nIt is possible, also, that the lag of from 9 to 38\nmonths between time when blood samples were\ntaken and the time when school achievement\ndata were obtained may have vitiated the rela-\ntionships among the variables. This does not\nseem likely since SUA is fairly stable over a pe-\never, we have no measure of this effect in our\ndata.\n"
