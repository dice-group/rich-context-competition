Community processes are key determinants of older adults' ability to age in place, but existing scales measuring these\nconstructs may not provide accurate, unbiased measurements among older adults because they were designed with the concerns\nof child-rearing respondents in mind. This study examines the properties of a new theory-based measure of collective efficacy\n(CE) that accounts for the perspectives of older residents. Methods. Data come from the population-based Chicago Neighborhood\nOrganization, Aging and Health study (N = 1,151), which surveyed adults aged 65 to 95. Using descriptive statistics, correlations,\nand factor analysis, we explored the acceptability, reliability, and validity of the new measure. Results. Principal component analysis\nindicated that the new scale measures a single latent factor. It had good internal consistency reliability, was highly correlated\nwith the original scale, and was similarly associated with neighborhood exchange and disorder, self-rated health, mobility, and\nloneliness. The new scale also showed less age-differentiated nonresponse compared to the original scale. Discussion. The older\nadult CE scale has reliability and validity equivalent to that of the existing measure but benefits from a more developed theoretical\ngrounding and reduced likelihood of age-related differential nonresponse.\n1. Introduction\nEvidence suggests that community processes are important\nto older adults' ability to age in place [1, 2]. Of the eight fac-\ntors identified in the World Health Organization's report on\nage-friendly cities [3], three seem fundamentally dependent\non community processes. These three, Age-Friendly Outdoor\nSpaces (WHO factor 1), Social Participation (WHO factor 4),\nand Respect and Social Inclusion (WHO factor 5) may all be\nsupported by structural innovations and resource infusion,\nbut, in all likelihood, cannot be sustained without on-\ngoing community involvement. Community-level behavior\nis important not only for the immediate results produced by\ndiscrete actions and social exchange, but also for its role in\nshaping the perceptions and norms of behavior held by the\ncommunity's residents.\nThe perceptions and norms of behavior likely relevant\nto the three WHO factors fall under the rubric of a well-\ndeveloped sociological construct, collective efficacy. Collective\nefficacy (CE) refers to perceptions and norms of two cate-\ngories of social processes that represent two kinds of com-\nmunity social resources: trust and connection, commonly\nreferred to as social cohesion, and expectations for action,\ncommonly referred to as informal social control. Studies have\nshown the importance of CE for multiple aspects of well-\nbeing among older adults [4\u00ad7]. In particular, CE has been\nshown to play a role in enhancing older adults' physical\nhealth and neighborhood satisfaction, which may predict\ntheir intentions to move and actual migration [2, 5, 8\u00ad14].\nUnfortunately, existing scales measuring this construct may\nnot be ideal for use with older adults because they were\n2  \ndesigned with the concerns of child-rearing respondents in\nmind [15]. For example, scale items that ask about ex-\npectations of neighbor cooperation in monitoring children\nmay be less relevant to adults whose children are grown.\nAt the same time, the priorities of older adults are not\nnecessarily reflected in these existing scales.\nAt the individual level, a number of scales measuring\nsuch constructs as anxiety and life satisfaction have been\ndeveloped based on theory and evidence regarding the\ndistinctiveness of older adults' experiences (e.g., [16\u00ad19]).\nThese and similar scales are able to measure the constructs\nof interest among older adults more accurately and with\nless response bias because they take into account the unique\nconcerns, challenges, and goals of adults in the later decades\nof their lives [20]. For example, scales that feature items that\nare more salient to older adults show increased instrument\nacceptability in the form of higher response rates and lower\ndifferential nonresponse [21]. Such scales, by providing\nmore easily recognized and comprehended items, also reduce\nresponse burden [22]. By following the same principles,\nscales measuring neighborhood social processes can be\ndesigned such that they produce more accurate measurement\namong older adults.\nIn this study we describe and test a new measure of\nCE. This measure was developed specifically for use in\nolder populations, taking into account the unique ways that\npeople of their age and cohort interpret and respond to\ncommon environmental cues, and the particular cues that we\nhypothesized would be uniquely important to older adults.\nIn the first part of this paper, we explain the theoretical\nframework guiding our identification of environmental cues\nfor CE likely to be salient to older adults. In the second part of\nthe paper, we test the new measure's instrument acceptability,\ndimensionality, reliability, and criterion validity in an older\nadult population. In the third part of the paper, we appraise\nthe new measure's construct validity by examining its\nassociation with individual health-related outcomes. Our\naim was to construct a scale that can be used in research\non neighborhood social processes, the health of older adults,\nand other factors that relate to aging in place.\nOur theoretical framework combines CE theory with a\nconsideration of the particular challenges and opportunities\nof the older adult life stage. As alluded to above, CE theory\nattempts to explain the association between neighborhood\nstructural factors, social processes, and individual-level out-\ncomes by positing that the neighborhood processes of social\ncohesion and informal social control mediate the relation-\nship between the structural factors and individual outcomes\n[23, 24]. For example, compositional socioeconomic status\nmay impact social cohesion, which in turn affects self-rated\nhealth, asthma rates, and inflammatory marker levels by\nreducing stress and fear [4\u00ad7, 25]. CE is therefore likely\nto be a part of the societal system that supports healthy\nliving, safeguards individuals against adverse health events,\nand thereby enables aging in place [26]. CE is related to,\nbut distinct from, social network interaction and exchange\nand social and physical disorder. The first is concerned with\nnorms and expectations, while the second and third refer to\nactual behavior and conditions.\nA range of theories from the aging and life course lit-\nerature provide us with a framework for generating a set\nof cues for social cohesion and informal social control that\nwould be particularly salient to older adults [27\u00ad33]. A key\nfocus of later life is to develop mechanisms to adapt to new\nchallenges, including frailty and morbidity and decreased\napplied to the CE framework, these perspectives suggest\nthat perceptions of neighbors' willingness to assist older\nadults with tasks, and perceptions of neighborhood norms\nrelated to regulating behavior with the goal of enhancing\nneighborhood safety and traversability, will be particularly\nimportant. At the same time, older adults are not only\nconcerned with compensating for losses and coping with\nchallenges. Generativity is also a key component of later\nlife, defined as helping the next generation by, for instance,\npassing on wisdom and thereby leaving a legacy [27\u00ad29].\nWithin the CE framework, this perspective incorporates the\nnotion that intergenerational exchange may contribute to a\nprosocial orientation and a mutual respect for community\ncontributions across the life course.\nIn the remainder of this section, we discuss the research\nliterature underlying our selection of the four specific types\nof cues for CE that we believe would be particularly salient\nto older adults. The two types of social cohesion cues that we\nhypothesize to be particularly salient to older adults, based\non theory in urban sociology and literature on aging, are\nthose that relate to active caretaking of vulnerable residents\nand age integration/lack of ageism. The two types of informal\nsocial control cues that we hypothesize to be particularly\nsalient to older adults, based on the theory and literature on\naging, are those that relate to minimizing social incivility and\nmaximizing accessibility.\nOlder adults may be particularly attuned to displays of\nsolidarity in the form of social cohesion cues related to active\ncaring and caretaking. Frailty and decreased mobility make\nsome tasks that are easy in middle age significantly more\ndifficult in later life [38, 39]. Simultaneously, many older\nadults experience a decrease in the scope and density of their\nsocial networks [40, 41]. As a result of this combination of\nchanges, older adults are often more reliant on assistance\nfrom community members [42, 43]. Perceptions of the avail-\nability of neighbor assistance may be particularly important\nto the well-being of older women compared to older men\nand older single men compared to older married men, who\nare unlikely and unable, respectively, to rely on their spouses\nfor help [44]. Older adults who believe that their neighbors\nwill provide active caretaking may be more confident about\ntheir ability to stay in their homes. Our new measure of CE\nincludes two items designed to capture the tendency toward\nactive caretaking facet of the social cohesion construct.\nOlder adults may also be particularly attuned to, and able\nto benefit substantially from, social cohesions cues related\nto age integration and lack of ageism. Aging societies have\nexperienced an increase in social separation of age groups,\neven as age heterogeneity within most neighborhoods has\nincreased [45\u00ad48]. One reason for the persistence of social\nsegregation by age despite decreased logistical barriers to\nsocializing across age boundaries may be ageism, which may\n  3\ninterfere with communication across agelines [49]. Another\nfactor impeding such communication is the decrease in\ninformation processing speed and loss of hearing that com-\nmonly occurs at older ages [50\u00ad52]. These factors combine\nto create a situation in which sustained effort is required for\ncross-generational socializing.\nPerceptions of opportunities for cross-generational inter-\nactions are relevant to older adults priorities, and ability to\nage in place, for a number of reasons. Communities in which\nolder and younger people associate may be communities in\nwhich there are fewer age-based misunderstandings, biases,\nfears, and resentments, and greater empathy on the part of\nyounger people for the challenges that come with later life\nas age integrated may therefore feel safer venturing outside to\nparticipate in community life, because they would have less\nreason to fear and more reason to feel connected to a wider\nrange of their neighbors. Expectations of communication\nacross age lines also encompass expectations for the ability to\npotentially pass on wisdom, neighborhood history, or prac-\ntical advice and thereby feel and be useful [54]. Such oppor-\ntunities for generativity are likely to be crucial to neigh-\nborhood satisfaction; being able to fill this social role has\nbeen associated with lower mortality [55]. Our new meas-\nure of CE includes three items designed to capture the age\nintegration facet of the social cohesion construct.\nRegarding the domain of informal social control, we\nexpect that older adults pay increased attention to the\ncommunity's expectations for behaviors that minimize social\nincivility, as a result of reverse ageism (prejudice of older\npeople against younger people), the increase in frailty that\noften accompanies advancing age [48, 56]. Older people with\nimpaired balance, reduced muscle strength, and limited gait\nspeed may be more likely than spry younger adults to find\nthe loud, unpredictable peregrinations of rowdy teenagers\nthreatening [48]. Furthermore, as a result of reverse ageism,\nelderly residents may perceive even subdued teenagers as\na threat [56]. Their perceptions of the neighborhood's\nexpectations for protecting vulnerable residents from mali-\ncious young people may be particularly important for older\nresidents' willingness to venture outside on a regular basis\nand for their neighborhood satisfaction. Our new measure\nof CE includes one item designed to capture the expectation\nfor actions that minimize social incivility, a component of the\ninformal social control construct.\nLastly, increased frailty and disability may also increase\nthe salience of cues for informal social control in the form\nof expectations for behaviors that maximize accessibility. For\nmany older adults, navigating their neighborhoods becomes\nmore difficult as their mobility decreases and their vulnera-\nbility for adverse health outcomes resulting from interactions\nwith environmental hazards increases [57\u00ad60]. Older frail\nadults may be more attuned to obstacles and hazards in\nthe physical environment, particularly as those environments\nbecome dilapidated [61]. Increased expectations for actions\naimed at improving the safety and integrity of the environ-\nment may be related to increased likelihood of maintaining\nand using physical abilities and competencies for two\nreasons: (1) it may be related to increased confidence about\nventuring outside, and (2) it may relate to actual improved\nconditions [8, 61, 62]. Maintenance of the environment can\nin turn prevent the adverse health events that constitute\nCE includes two items designed to capture the expectations\nfor actions that maximize accessibility, a component of the\ninformal social control construct.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Data and Sample. We used data from the Chicago\nNeighborhood, Organization, Aging and Health study\nliving in 80 selected Chicago neighborhood clusters. Each\ncluster was defined by two to three census tracts consisting\nof approximately 4,000 housing units. The sample frame\nconsisted of all households in the city of Chicago containing\nat least one member 65 years of age or older. The weighted\nresponse rate for households with a phone number was\n55.3% while the rate for those households for which a phone\nnumber could not be identified was 12.4%. The overall\nweighted response rate for the survey was 44.3%, a good rate\nfor a telephone interview by contemporary standards [63,\n64]. Interviews were conducted over the phone in English\nNOAH study was approved by the institutional review boards\nof both NORC and the Division of Biological Sciences at\nthe University of Chicago. All participants provided verbal\nconsent.\ndents with complete demographic, health, and community\nprocess data (N = 1, 151). Descriptive statistics are shown in\nfemale. Over two fifths (44%) were non-Hispanic White,\nover a third were Non-Hispanic Black (35.8%), and the rest\nwere married, and about a tenth (9.8%) lived with someone\nunder the age of 18. About a quarter had less than 12 years of\neducation, about another quarter had graduated from high\nschool, and a little under half had some college or more.\nA little more than a tenth of the sample had lived in their\nneighborhood for less than 10 years, while a little less than\nthree quarters had lived in their neighborhood for more than\n20 years. Those missing data, who were therefore excluded\nfrom the sample as described above, were more likely to\nbe White Non-Hispanic than to be any other race/ethnicity\ncombination.\n2.2. Measures of CE. The CE questions were presented to the\nrespondent in two blocks. The first block was introduced\nwith the sentences, \"Now I'm going to read some statements\nabout things that people in your neighborhood may or may\nnot do. For each of these statements, please tell me whether\nyou strongly agree, somewhat agree, somewhat disagree, or\nstrongly disagree.\" The second block was introduced with the\nsentence, \"For each of the following, please tell me if it is very\nlikely, somewhat likely, somewhat unlikely, or very unlikely\nthat people in your neighborhood would act in the following\nmanner.\"\n4  \nTable 1: Descriptive statistics.\n%\nAge (years)\nSex\nRace/ethnicity\nEducation, in years\nYears in neighborhood\n2.2.1. Collective Efficacy--Original Scale Items. The original\nCE scale, composed of eight items, first appeared in the\nProject on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods\n[65]. In the NOAH survey, the items were administered\nalongside the new CE items. The following three items were\nin the first block: this is a close knit neighborhood; people\naround here are willing to help their neighbors; people in\nthis neighborhood can be trusted. The next five items were in\nthe second block: your neighbors would break up a fight in\nfront of your house in which someone was being threatened\nor beaten; your neighbors would do something about it if a\ngroup of neighborhood children were skipping school and\nhanging out on a street corner; your neighbors would do\nsomething about it if some children were spray-painting\ngraffiti on a local building; neighborhood residents would\norganize to try to do something to keep the fire station open\nif because of budget cuts the fire station closest to your\nhome was going to be closed down by the city; people in\nyour neighborhood would scold a child who was showing\ndisrespect to an adult.\n2.2.2. Collective Efficacy--New Scale Items. The new CE\nscale, composed of eight items, was created by two of the\nauthors. The age integration facet of social cohesion was\nmeasured with three items in the first block: people in your\nneighborhood treat older people in this neighborhood with\nrespect; younger adults and children generally know who\nthe older people in the neighborhood are; older people in\nthis neighborhood socialize with younger adults as well as\npeople their own age. The answer options for each of these\nwere strongly agree, somewhat agree, somewhat disagree,\nand strongly disagree. The active caretaking facet of social\ncohesion was measured with two items, one in each block:\nyour neighbors would shop for groceries for you, if you were\nsick; people in your neighborhood would check on older\nor more vulnerable residents if there was a heat wave. The\nanswer options for the first item were the same as those\nfor the age integration items. The answer options for the\nsecond item were very likely, somewhat likely, somewhat\nunlikely, and very unlikely. The maximizing accessibility\nfacet of informal social control was measured with two\nitems in the second block: people in your neighborhood\nwould help to keep the sidewalks and other public spaces\nclear if there was a snowstorm; people in the neighborhood\nwould help to get the problem corrected, if there was a\nproblem in the neighborhood that affected older adults, like\ncrumbling sidewalks or unsafe parks. The answer options\nfor both items ranged from very likely to very unlikely.\nThe minimizing social incivility facet of informal social\ncontrol was measured with a single item in the second block:\nneighborhood residents would intervene if an older person\nin your neighborhood was being threatened by a group of\nteenagers. The answer options for this item again ranged\nfrom very likely to very unlikely.\n2.3. Demographic and Health Measures. Sociodemographic\nmeasures included age, race/ethnicity, and marital status. An\nindicator for the presence of a child under the age of 18 in\nthe household of the respondent was constructed using the\nlist generated by a household roster. Health was measured\nusing a self-report measure that asked: overall, how would\nyou rate your health in the past 4 weeks: excellent, very good,\ngood, fair, poor, or very poor? We treated self-rated health as\nan ordinal categorical variable, collapsing the categories poor\nand very poor into one, because less than 2% of the sample\nanswered \"very poor\". A measure of mobility was constructed\nusing two measures taken from the Health and Retirement\nSurvey (2002) and two measures adapted from the California\nHealth and Interview Survey (CHIS). The resulting ordinal\nvariable had the following categories: has difficulty walking\nacross a room, has difficulty walking one block, walks less\nthan 10 minutes or more each week, walks 10 minutes or\nmore once or a few times each week, walks 10 minutes or\nmore daily, walks 10 minutes or more multiple times a day.\nLoneliness was measured using Hughes et al. [66] three-item\nscale. It has a range of 0 to 3 and a mean of 1.4.\n2.4. Neighborhood Process Measures. Besides CE, NOAH\nmeasured two other neighborhood processes. Neighborhood\ndisorder was measured with a four-item scale from the\nPHDCN and was introduced with the sentence, \"I'm going\nto read a list of things that are problems in some neigh-\nborhoods. For each, please tell me how much of a problem\nit is in your neighborhood--a big problem, somewhat of a\nproblem, or not a problem.\" The four items asked about litter,\ngraffiti, drug use and sale, and public drinking. The scale was\n  5\nreliable in this sample (Cronbach's alpha = 0.74) and had a\nrange of 1 to 3, with a mean of 1.54. Neighborhood exchange\nwas measured with a four-item scale from the PHDCN and\nwas introduced with the sentence, \"Now I am going to\nask about some things you might do with people in your\nneighborhood. For each, please tell me if it happens often,\nsometimes, rarely or never.\" The four items asked about\ndoing favors, watching over homes of absent neighbors,\nasking for advice, and visiting. The scale was reliable in this\nsample (Cronbach's alpha = 0.75) and had a range of 1 to 4,\n2.5. Analysis. In the first section of the analysis, the prop-\nerties of the new CE scale were examined. Instrument ac-\nceptability and item salience were examined by comparing\nresponse rates and differential nonresponse for each item\nin the original and new CE scales. Next, the new scale\nwas examined for dimensionality using principal component\nanalysis. Because only one factor was identified, the next step\nwas to estimate internal consistency reliability by calculating\nCronbach's alpha for the new scale. Criterion validity of the\nnew scale was tested by calculating correlations with the\noriginal CE scale. Convergent validity of the new scale was\ntested by calculating the correlations of the new CE scale with\nother NOAH measures of neighborhood processes.\nIn the second section of the analysis, the construct\nvalidity of the new CE scale was tested in a two-step process.\nFirst, we examined the correlations between the new scale\nand the health, mobility and loneliness measures, comparing\nthe results to those from identical analyses using the original\nCE scale. Second, we examined whether the new scale can\npredict well-being more accurately in certain demographic\nsubgroups by comparing the fit statistics of regressions\nestimated in those subgroups.\n3. Results\n3.1. New Collective Efficacy Scale: Instrument Acceptability.\nWe first examined percentage missing for each of the items\nin the original and new CE scales. The items most likely\nto be missing in the original CE scale were \"do something\nabout kids skipping school\" (4.4%) and \"scold child for\nshowing adult disrespect\" (3.7%). The items most likely to\nbe missing in the new CE scale were \"younger people know\nolder people\" (5%) and \"older people socialize with younger\nadults\" (4.6%). The percentage missing one or more item\nfrom the original CE scale was 10.9%, while the percentage\nmissing one or more item from the new CE scale was 13.0%.\nNo clear pattern emerged of one scale showing more missing\nthan the other.\n3.2. New Collective Efficacy Scale: Differential Nonresponse.\nThe results of the differential nonresponse analysis are shown\nin Table 2. Consistent with previous research, respondents in\nthe middle and oldest age categories were more likely than\nthose in the youngest age category to be missing at least\none item from both the original and older adult CE scales\n[22]. The extent of this differential nonresponse by age was\nnot equal between scales, however. Those in the oldest age\ncategory were more likely to be missing five of the eight items\nin the old CE scale: the trustworthy neighbors item (7.9%\nversus 1.4%, P < 0.01), the scold a disrespectful child item\nP < 0.05). In comparison, those in the oldest age category\nwere only more likely to be missing three of the eight items in\nthe new CE scale: the young people know older people item\nneighbors intervene to protect threatened elder item (6.3%\nversus 1.7%, P < 0.05). Those in the middle age category\ndid not differ from those in the youngest age category in\ntheir likelihood of missing any of the items in the new scale\nbut did differ in their likelihood of missing one item in\nthe original scale: the scold a disrespectful child item (4.9%\nversus 2.4%, P < 0.05). Because such a small percentage of\nthe respondents were in the oldest age category (9%), we\nrecalculated these percentages comparing the youngest old\nto the two older groups combined. In this case, those in\nthe middle and oldest age categories were more likely to be\nmissing four of the items from the original scale, but were\nonly more likely to be missing two of the items from the\nnew scale. In the old scale, these items were the trustworthy\nitem (3.7% versus 1.8%), the scold a disrespectful child item\nIn the new scale, these items were the young people know\npeople socialize with young adults item (6.0% versus 3.7%,\n3.3. New Collective Efficacy Scale: Dimensionality, Reliability,\nCriterion and Convergent Validity. The results from the\nprincipal component analysis suggested that the eight items\nin the new CE scale represented a single latent factor, since\nonly one component had an eigenvalue greater than one. The\ninternal consistency reliability of the scale, as measured by\nCronbach's alpha, was 0.81. It was slightly higher for those\nover 77 and men (0.82 for both groups) and slightly lower for\nconsistency reliability of the theoretically defined subscales\nwas 0.65 (informal social control) and 0.72 (social cohesion).\nTo examine the criterion validity of the new scale,\nwe calculated its correlation with the old CE scale. The\ncorrelation of the scales with each other was 0.81, the\ncorrelation of the theoretically defined old and new social\ncohesion subscales was 0.68, and the correlation of the\ntheoretically defined old and new informal social control\nWe next tested for convergent and divergent validity by\nexamining the association of the new CE scale with the\ntwo other NOAH measures of neighborhood quality, neigh-\nborhood disorder and neighborhood exchange (Table 3).\nNeighborhood exchange was more highly correlated with\nthe new CE scale than it was with the original scale,\n6  \nTable 2: Percent missing each collective efficacy xcale item, by age group.\nYoung old\nsample\nMiddle old\nsample\nOldest old\nN = 9% of the\nsample\nOriginal collective efficacy scale items\nNew collective efficacy scale items\nNeighbors help fix issue affecting older adults 1.5 1.7 5.5+\na% missing differs from % missing among middle/oldest old, P < 0.01P < 0.05 + P < 0.1.\nwhile neighborhood disorder was more highly (negatively)\ncorrelated with the original CE scale than the new CE scale.\nAlso, disorder was more highly (negatively) correlated with\nthe new theoretically defined CE subscale of informal control\nthan with the new theoretically defined CE subscale of social\ncohesion, while the reverse was true for exchange.\n3.4. New Collective Efficacy Scale: Construct Validity. In the\nsecond part of the analysis, we examined the construct\nvalidity of the new scale by comparing its correlation with\nvarious health measures with similar correlations between\nthe original scale and those measures. The correlations\nbetween the original and the new CE scales and the self-\nrated health, mobility, and loneliness measures are shown in\nTable 4. The correlation between self-rated health and CE,\nwhether measured with the original or the new scale, was\nCE, whether measured with the original or the new scale, was\n0.07 (P < 0.05). The correlations between loneliness and the\noriginal and new CE scales differed. The correlation with the\nLastly, we regressed each of these three measures on\nthe two CE measures one at a time and compared the fit\nstatistics. The fit of the models, as measured by the r-\nsquared statistic, was not better for one scale than for the\nother (not shown). We also compared the fit statistics of\nthese models estimated for the male and female subsamples,\nthe married and unmarried subsamples, each of the age\nsubgroups, and the sub-samples with and without children\nin their households (not shown). There were no differences\nin fit.\n4. Discussion\nThe aim of this paper was to describe the development\nand examine the properties of a new theory-based measure\nof CE that incorporates the perspectives of older residents.\nOne motivation for creating a new scale customized for a\nparticular subpopulation is that the increased instrument\nacceptability and salience of the customized items may\nincrease the response rate for the scale items. The results from\nour examination of the percentage missing the individual\nitems, as well as percentage missing one or more items from\nthe old versus the new CE scales, did not show such effects.\nNeither at the individual item level, nor at the scale level, did\nit appear that one scale is less or more likely to have missing\nvalues.\nHowever, another motivation for creating a new scale\ncustomized for a particular subpopulation is that the\nincreased salience of the customized items may decrease\nor eliminate differential nonresponse by the variables that\ndefine the subpopulation. The results from our analysis\nsuggest such an effect in our new CE scale. The likelihood\n  7\nTable 3: Correlations of collective efficacy scales and subscales with other neighborhood scales.\nOriginal CE scale New CE scale\nNew CE scale--social\ncohesion subscale\nNew CE scale--\ninformal social\ncontrol subscale\nAll correlations are significant at P < 0.0001, except that between disorder and exchange, which is significant at P < 0.01.\nTable 4: Correlations of collective efficacy scales with health and\nwell-being.\nOriginal CE scale New CE scale\nof missing was greater among the oldest old than the rest of\nthe sample for five of the eight items in the original scale,\nbut only three of the eight items in the new scale. The new\nscale is therefore better suited for use in older populations,\nbecause nonresponse will be less likely to be a function\nof age. This pattern was also in line with our hypothesis\nthat items related to children would be less relevant and\ntherefore harder to answer for older adults. Of the items with\ndifferential nonresponse, three of the five from the original\nscale and one of the three from the new older adult scale\nconcerned young people.\nThe results of our dimensionality and reliability analysis\nsuggest that the scale measures one factor, with good re-\nliability. It has reasonable criterion validity, in that it was\nclosely correlated with the original CE scale and the other two\nneighborhood scales, neighborhood exchange and disorder.\nIt was perhaps to be expected that neighborhood exchange\nwould be more highly correlated with the new CE scale than\nwith the original scale, while neighborhood disorder would\nbe more highly (negatively) correlated with the original CE\nscale than with the new CE scale, since the original CE scale\nhas an equal number of social cohesion and informal social\ncontrol items, while the new CE scale has 5 social cohesion\nitems but only 3 informal social control items. This difference\nin the number of items measuring each part of CE may also\nexplain why disorder was more highly (negatively) correlated\nwith the new theoretically defined CE subscale of informal\ncontrol than with the new theoretically defined CE subscale\nof social cohesion, while the reverse was true for exchange.\nThe results of the construct validity analysis suggest that\nthe new CE scale predicts health and mobility just as well as\ndoes the original CE scale and may predict loneliness slightly\nbetter--an important finding given recent literature on the\nprevalence and salience of loneliness among older adults.\n4.1. Limitations. The primary limitation of this study is\nits geographic specificity. Because it is limited to a single\ncity, replication studies will need to examine the measure's\npsychometric properties in rural and suburban contexts,\nas well as in other urban areas. The other limitations of\nthis study relate to its survey modality. Phone surveys are\nsubject to sampling and response bias, the first exacerbated\nby increased use of call screening technology and the rapid\ngrowth of telephone marketing [64, 67]. However, the risk\nof social desirability bias inherent in the telephone survey\nadministration modality should be relatively minor given the\nnon-personal and therefore non-sensitive nature of most of\nthe questions asked [68, 69]. Also, sampling or response bias\ndue to hearing impairment is likely to be less significant than\nsuch bias due to vision and fine motor impairment in studies\nusing self-administered questionnaires [22, 70].\n5. Conclusions\nThe importance of neighborhood context, and in particular\nits potential ability to modify adverse health event risk,\nprevalence, and severity is being increasingly recognized.\nFor example, the original measure of CE has just recently\nbeen added to the PhenX toolkit, a set of consensus\nmeasures intended to standardize genetic and epidemio-\nlogical research (http://www.phenxtoolkit.org/-February 4\nmeasures include comparability across studies and the\npotential to easily combine results in meta-analyses, there\nare also benefits to using measures customized to particular\npopulations. The new measure of CE presented in this study\nhas reliability and validity equivalent to that of the existing\nmeasure but benefits from a stronger gerontology-related\ntheoretical grounding and reduced likelihood of age-related\ndifferential nonresponse.\nThe two measures exhibited both high correlation and\ncomparable effects on the health outcomes considered. These\nfindings raise the larger question of the extent to which\nmeasures of distinct forms of CE are capturing an underlying\nlatent neighborhood capacity.\nCE theory underscores the goal-directed nature of mobi-\nlization capacity, suggesting that a given neighborhood may\nhave differing levels of CE depending upon the specific\nchallenge under consideration. In this view, communities\nwith high levels of CE with respect to the social control of\npublic space may or may not share a comparable willingness\nto maintain and promote the health and well-being of local\nolder adults.\nYet, in practice, evidence suggests that high levels of CE\nacross multiple objectives are likely to cluster together in the\nsame communities. This may be due to the shared origins\nof distinct forms of CE in the structural (e.g., economic\nadvantage, residential stability) and social (e.g., informal\n8  \nnetwork density, voluntary organization participation) con-\nditions of urban neighborhoods. Cohesive neighborhoods\nwith high levels of mutual trust and solidarity may provide\nthe conditions under which generalized prosocial norms\nemerge, benefiting a broad base of residential constituencies.\nAlthough the current analysis offers evidence consistent\nwith the notion of a generalized collective capacity, we do\nnot view these results as grounds upon which we reject the\nhypothesis that CE exhibits distinct dimensions. First, CE\nwith respect to the social control of public space may have\nindirect benefits for older adults. Fear and the associated\nwithdrawal from neighborhood environments may have\nimportant health implications for older adults and may be\nstrongly related to local norms regarding the social control\nof children (a significant component of the original CE\nscale). Thus it may be the case that the original CE operates,\nin part, indirectly to produce comparable associations with\nthe health outcomes considered. Second, research on the\ndynamics of neighborhood collective capacities is incipient.\nAnalyses of the association and impact of CE measures\nfocused on other shared goals (e.g., expectations regarding\ninfluence of local institutions) may reveal different patterns,\nwarranting more extensive research.\nIn the case of older adult's perceptions of their commu-\nnities' association with the factors that predict whether and\nhow older adults age in place, the strength and mechanisms\nare still not fully understood. For example, it may be that\neven before health deteriorates, specific expectations that\nneighbors will provide help when needed and will take steps\nto maintain the safety of the common areas are the particular\nperceptions that predict intentions to stay. Similarly, it may\nbe that when health and functionality deteriorate, the specific\nperception that neighbors are assuming the caretaking\nrole usually shouldered by family may be the particular\nperception that forestalls a move. This new measure of CE\ncan be used to test these hypothesized pathways, as well as\nthe others discussed in the introduction (Section 1), that may\nlink CE to neighborhood satisfaction, health, and the other\nfactors that predict intention to move and actual migration.\nAuthor's Contribution\nC.
