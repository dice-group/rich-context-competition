Abdominal obe-\nsity appears to be more strongly correlated with meta-\nbolic and cardiovascular risk than BMI [9,10], and thus\nwhether the nature of the obesity epidemic is changing\nto one of greater abdominal obesity may have important\nimplications for the burden of obesity-related disease.\nHowever some studies exploring this question have\nbased their conclusions on different proportional\nincreases in the two measures of excess body weight\n[3-5,7,8]. This method is flawed, due to the nature of\nthe relationship between WC and BMI.\nMethods\nWe analysed data from two nationally representative\ncross-sectional surveys of the US population, the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Studies\n(NHANES), conducted by the US National Center for\nHealth and Statistics. The surveys were conducted dur-\nusing a multistage, stratified cluster sampling design to\nbe representative of the civilian, non-institutionalised US\npopulation.\nWe analysed in two ways the change in WC and BMI\nbetween these two periods. First, we calculated the per-\ncentage change in the average BMI and the average WC\nbetween the two time points. Second, we fitted a regres-\nsion equation with WC as the dependent (outcome)\nvariable and BMI and time as predictor variables\u00adalong\nwith a number of potential confounder variables [2].\nResults\nIn our analysis there was a marginally greater crude per-\ncentage change in BMI (5.8%) than WC (5.1%), but\nusing regression analysis we demonstrated that increases\nin WC were in fact greater than expected based on\nincreases in BMI [2]. Differences in the percentage\nchange in BMI and WC do not indicate that one\n* Correspondence: helen.walls@anu.edu.au\nDepartment of Epidemiology & Preventive Medicine, Monash University,\nAlfred Hospital, Victoria 3004, Australia\n\u00a9 2011 Walls et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

There is a well-defined struc-\ntural relationship between Fahrenheit (\u00b0F) and degrees\nCelsius (\u00b0C), whereas the example we are exploring of\nbody weight is a data-driven regression relationship.\nHowever, the example of the two temperature scales\nprovides a clear and simple example of the underlying\nissue.\nThe relationship between these measures of tempera-\nture is described by:\nAn increase in temperature from 25\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C corre-\nsponds to an increase from 77\u00b0F to 86\u00b0F, and the actual\nincrease in temperature is of course identical, just mea-\nsured on two different scales. But if the proportional\nincreases in these measures are calculated without con-\nsideration of the relationship between them, there\nappears to be a much greater proportional increase in\ntemperature when measured in degrees Celsius (20.0%)\nthan in degrees Fahrenheit (11.7%). The size of the\nmodel intercept term relating the measures (in this case,\n32) drives the misconception.\nTo explore this in a more theoretical manner using\nthe relationship between WC and BMI, let's assume the\nrelationship between WC and BMI does not change\nover time (and is not affected by confounders - assumed\nthroughout these examples for ease of explanation).\nSuch a relationship is based on this regression equation:\nWC =  +   BMI (1)\nIn this equation,  is the model intercept term and a\nis the coefficient of BMI. Thus, rearranging (1) to calcu-\nlate the percentage change in WC gives us:\n)\n=\n)\nIn this equation, WCi\n, BMIi\nand ti\nare the values of\nWC, BMI and time at time i. If the model intercept\nterm () is zero, the BMI coefficients (a) cancel out and\nthe percentage change in WC is equal to the percentage\nchange in BMI. There is a theoretical common zero for\nBMI and WC\u00ada person with zero BMI would have zero\nWC\u00adbut in reality this zero is never reached. Over the\nrange of observable values BMI and WC generally have\na relationship where the model intercept term () is not\nzero. Thus, whether WC increases more or less than\nBMI is dependent on the value of .\nLet's explore a real-life scenario using estimates from\nour data [2]. The estimated mean values for BMI and\nWC were:\nresponds to a 5.8% increase and the WC increase from\nHowever we cannot directly compare these percentage\nincreases and conclude that the change in BMI is\ngreater than the increase in WC due to the fact that the\nrelationship between the two measures is described by a\nregression equation with a model intercept term that\ndoes not equal zero. In fact, if we fit the regression\nmodel specified in equation (1), then we get the follow-\ning estimates:\nIf this were a structural relationship like the tempera-\nture example described above, we could subtract 37.2\nfrom WC. Our adjusted WC would then have a zero\ncoinciding with that of BMI so that the  term in equa-\ntions (1) and (2) would be zero. Hence we could directly\ncalculate a percent increase in WC\u00adin this case 8.5%\u00ad\nto compare with the 5.8% increase in BMI. There are\ntwo problems with this. Firstly, this is a data-driven rela-\ntionship not a structural relationship so that the value of\nthe  term will depend on the specific data set we are\nexamining and on any co-variates included in the\nmodel. Secondly, if our aim is to compare the increase\nin WC with that in BMI, then we should have a way of\ntesting whether any observed difference between\nincreases in BMI and WC could have arisen by chance.\nA better way to explore whether BMI or WC has\nmoved to a greater extent relative to the other is to con-\nsider regression equation (1) with the addition of a time\nvariable:\nWC =  +   BMI +   t (3)\nEquation (3) implies that the coefficient of time (g)\nwill determine whether or not WC is on average larger\nfor a given BMI at the second time point compared\nwith the first time point.\nThe parameter estimates from our data were:\nNote the very different estimate of \u00ad21.8 compared\nto our earlier estimate of 37.2. Equation (3) implies that\nfor a given BMI, the WC at the second time point will\nbe on average 0.85 cm higher than the WC at the first\ntime point. This clearly shows that for a given increase\nin BMI, the increase in WC is higher than expected, not\nlower, as predicted by the comparisons of proportional\nincreases in BMI and WC. Further, we can formally test\nwhether the g term is statistically significantly different\nto zero\u00adthat is whether the higher increase in WC is\ndue to chance. In our case the p value associated with g\nis p < 0.0001, so the relationship is unlikely to have\narisen by chance.\nThis model is theoretical; the real-life application of\nthis model will require adjustments needed for interac-\ntions between variables such as BMI and time, and con-\nsideration given to non-linear temporal effects.\nHowever, it does illustrate the problems arising in a\ndirect comparison of percentage changes in BMI and\nWC. Further, while our model is data-driven, this issue\nis not unique to our analysis. For example, Elobeid et al.\n[1] found a non-zero intercept when relating BMI to\nWC using a different modelling analysis.\nThe relationship could equally be described with BMI\nas the dependent variable and WC as the independent\nvariable. In this case equation (3) would be reformulated\nas:\nBMI =  +   WC +   t (4)\nNote that one feature of regression analysis is that this\nwill generally not be the same equation as equation (3).\nThe parameter estimates from our data were in this\ncase:\nEquation (4) implies that for a given WC, the BMI at\nthe second time point will be on average 0.02 kg/m2\nsmaller than the BMI at the first time point.\nConclusion\nThe relationship between the percentage change in WC\nand the percentage change in BMI is not simple and dif-\nferences in their percentage increases cannot be directly\ncompared. Comparisons of increases in the two mea-\nsures must account for the relationship between them\nas described by the regression equation.\n"
