    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nOLs (oligodendrocytes) are the myelinating cells of the CNS\n(central nervous system), wrapping axons in conductive\nsheathes to ensure effective transmission of neural signals.\nThe regulation of OL development, from precursor to\nmature myelinating cell, is controlled by a variety of\ninhibitory and inductive signalling factors. The dorsal spinal\ncord contains signals that inhibit OL development, possibly\nto prevent premature and ectopic precursor differentiation.\nThe Wnt and BMP (bone morphogenic protein) signalling\npathways have been identified as dorsal spinal cord signals\nwith overlapping temporal activity, and both have similar\ninhibitory effects on OL differentiation. Both these\npathways feature prominently in many developmental\nprocesses and demyelinating events after injury, and they\nare known to interact in complex inductive, inhibitive and\nsynergistic manners in many developing systems. The\ninteraction between BMP and Wnt signalling in OL\ndevelopment, however, has not been extensively explored.\nIn the present study, we examine the relationship between\nthe canonical Wnt and BMP pathways.

OLs are generated through a series\nof specific developmental stages (Pringle and Richardson,\nrange of signalling factors that can be inductive or inhibi-\ntory, extracellular or intracellular (Miller, 2002). OPCs (OL\nprecursor cells) originate in ventricular zones at E12.5\n(embryonic day 12.5) in the rodent CNS and migrate dorsally\nand radially, expressing markers such as A2B5, NG2 and\nPDGFr-a (platelet-derived growth factor receptor a). Once\ndifferentiation begins, OPCs progress to immature OLs,\ngenerating processes and expressing GalC (galactocerebro-\nside). After contacting neurons, OPCs begin to extend\nprocesses, express myelin proteins, including PLP (proteolipid\nprotein), MBP (myelin basic protein) and CNP (29,39 cyclic\n1 To whom correspondence should be addressed (email Grinspan@email.chop.edu).\nAbbreviations: b-Cat-null, b-catenin loss of function mutant mice; Bmpr1 DKO, Bmpr1 double knockout; BMP, bone morphogenic protein; CNP, 29,39 cyclic nucleotide\n39-phosphodiesterase; CNS, central nervous system; DAPI, 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Dkk-1, Dikkopf-1; DKO, double knockout; DM, differentiation medium; GalC,\ngalactocerebroside; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; HDAC, histone deacetylase; HRP, horseradish peroxidase;\nID, inhibitor of DNA-binding protein; IHC, immunohistochemistry; KO, knockout; LEF, lymphoid enhancer factor; MBP, myelin basic protein; OL, oligodendrocyte; OPC, OL\nprecursor cell; PLP, proteolipid protein; QPCR, quantitative real-time PCR; Shh, sonic hedgehog; TCF, T-cell factor.\nE 2011 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\nnucleotide 39-phosphodiesterase), then ensheathe axons in\nWhile the signals that influence this development are\nbeginning to be characterized, the extent of their interactions\nremains to be fully explored.\nInitially, signals in the ventral spinal cord, especially Shh\n(sonic hedgehog), induce expression of transcription factors\nessential for OL specification and development, including\nAnderson, 2002). In contrast, signals emanating from the roof\nplate in the dorsal spinal cord can inhibit this development\n(Wada et al., 2000), possibly to control the exact times when\nthese cells reach and myelinate dorsal regions. There are,\nhowever, dorsal populations of OPCs whose generation is\nShh independent, although their overall contributions ap-\npear to be limited and their distinct functions are unknown\nKessaris et al., 2006). Two families of dorsal signalling factors,\nthe BMPs (bone morphogenic proteins) and the Wnts, have\nbeen shown to exert inhibitory effects on OPC differentiation.\nBMPs are members of the TGFb (transforming growth\nfactor b) signalling family, and they have many roles in the\ndeveloping nervous system involving embryonic patterning,\ncell proliferation, specification, differentiation and apoptosis\nBMP families, BMP has been more extensively investigated\nwith regard to OL development, exerting time- and stage-\nspecific effects. BMPs drastically inhibit OPC differentiation\ninto mature OLs, instead promoting astrogliogenesis\nThe Wnts are another family of dorsal-secreted factors\ninvolved in many of the same roles as BMPs in the nervous\nsystem, including embryonic patterning, cell specification,\nproliferation, migration and differentiation (Dorsky et al.,\nMarti, 2010 for review). Recent studies have investigated the\ninfluence of canonical Wnt signalling on OL development,\nboth in vitro and in vivo, indicating that the Wnts and BMPs\nhave similar effects. In spinal cord explants and OPC cultures,\nectopic Wnt3a application inhibits the differentiation of OPCs\nmice in which Wnt signalling is constitutively activated in\ncells of OL lineage display an early developmental decrease\nin mature OLs. This effect diminishes as the mice age,\nhowever, suggesting that the importance of Wnt signalling\nmay vary over the course of OL development (Fancy et al.,\nThe interaction of BMPs and Wnts is well documented in a\nvariety of different systems, their expression is spatially and\ntemporally similar, and they are functionally involved in many\nof the same processes. Their relationship, however, varies\nbased on tissue and developmental timeline: depending on\ncontext, they can directly or indirectly be inductive,\nantagonistic or synergistic (Soshnikova et al., 2003; Guo\nis evidence that Wnt signalling prevents oligodendroglial\nspecification at the neural stem cell stage by up-regulating\nBMPs through neurogenesis (Kasai et al., 2005), but how\nthese two pathways may interact in OL development has not\nbeen explored in detail. An understanding of the interaction\nof these pathways is an important avenue for developing\ntreatments and therapies for demyelinating events. It is well\ndocumented that BMPs are up-regulated in CNS injury and\nmodels of demyelinating disease (Setoguchi et al., 2001,\net al., 2010), and can play roles in preventing remyelination.\nIn parallel, several recent studies have also found that\nmembers and effectors of the Wnt family are up-regulated in\nsimilar paradigms, and may have similar inhibitory effects on\nBecause Wnts and BMPs have similar sites of origin and\neffects on OLs during development and demyelinating events,\nwe hypothesized that these two signalling factors mutually\nregulate OL development. To explore this interaction, we have\nemployed effectors and antagonists of both canonical Wnt\nand BMP signalling on both mutant and normal OPC cultures.\nWe find that while both BMP4 and Wnt3a inhibit the\ndifferentiation of OPCs, when the BMP pathway is blocked \u00ad\nby either chemical or genetic means \u00ad the effects of both\nWnt3a and BMP4 are abrogated. In contrast, the effect of\nBMP4 on OPC differentiation is not altered when the\ncanonical Wnt signalling pathway is blocked. Our results\nindicate that the BMP pathway is necessary for canonical\nWnt signalling to inhibit OPC differentiation.\nEXPERIMENTAL\nCell culture generation and treatment\nAll experiments were performed in accordance with the\nguidelines set forth by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia\nInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee. To generate\npurified OPC cultures from newborn Sprague\u00adDawley rats or\nmixed background mice, forebrain cells were harvested and\nseeded on 100 mm Petri dishes in serum containing medium\nas previously described (See et al., 2004; Feigenson et al.,\ngrowth medium containing Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen)\nfibroblast growth factor (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN,\nU.S.A.), 2 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor (R & D), and 1\nng/ml neurotrophin-3 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, U.S.A.).\nRat cultures were purified 6\u00ad8 days after plating by\nimmunopanning as previously described (Grinspan et al.,\nK.

Cells were successively seeded on to two sets of dishes\ncoated with Ran-2 antibody to bind type-1 astrocytes,\nmeningeal cells and microglia. Cells were then put on dishes\nplated with A2B5 antibody (undiluted, hybridoma supernat-\nant, ATCC, Rockville, MD, U.S.A.; Eisenbarth et al., 1979) to\nbind the OPCs. When cells reached confluency, they were\nsub-cultured in polylysine-coated flasks, 12 mm polylysine-\ncoated coverslips, 100 mm polylysine-coated Petri dishes or\n50 mm polylysine-coated Petri dishes. Cells could be passaged\n3\u00ad4 times. Cultures were considered purified if they\ncontained fewer than 5% astrocytes.\nTo culture mouse OPCs, cells were harvested from the\nforebrains of individual animals using the same methods and\nmedia as previously described. Individual mouse brains were\ncultured singularly until genotypes were identified by PCR of\ntail DNA. At this stage, identically genotyped cultures were\ncombined. OPCs were purified using a gentle modified\nwashdown procedure as previously described (Feigenson\net al., 2009). Briefly, 4 ml of Hanks-buffered salt solution\nwithout Mg+ and Ca+ was drawn into a Pasteur pipette, and\nthen forcefully released on the cell monolayer at an angle.\nOPCs would detach, leaving any astrocytes adherent to the\nplate. OPCs and the Hanks medium were then drawn up into\nthe pipette and the procedure could be repeated several times\nuntil enough cells were collected. The detached OPCs were\ncollected in Hanks medium, triturated several times with the\nPasteur pipette and centrifuged at 100 g for 5 min. The pellet\nwas then plated on to a polylysine-coated flask. Cultures were\nconsidered purified if they contained fewer than 5%\nastrocytes.\nWhen OPCs were differentiated into mature OLs, growth\nmedium was removed, and cell cultures were fed with\nDM (differentiation medium), consisting of 50% DMEM\n(Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) and 50% Ham's F12,\nwith 50 mg/ml transferrin, 5 mg/ml putresine, 3 ng/ml\nCells were allowed to differentiate for 3 days to examine\nmarkers of immature OLs or 5 days to look at markers of\nmature OLs. Treatment conditions involved the application of\nsignalling factors to some cultures; these were 50 ng/ml\n1 (Dikkopf-1) (R & D) and 500 ng/ml Noggin (R & D).\nImmunofluorescence\nImmunostaining and preparation of coverslip-plated cells were\nperformed as previously described (Grinspan and Franceschini,\nsurface antibodies were anti-A2B5 with goat anti-mouse IgM\nand anti-galactocerebroside (RmAb GalC, undiluted, hybri-\ndoma supernatant; Ranscht et al., 1982) with goat-anti-mouse\nIgG3.

For all cell counts, positively\nlabelled cells and DAPI+ (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) cells\nwere counted in ten fields in each of two coverslips from each\nof at least three separate in vitro preparations, using a Leica\nApprox. 3000 cells were counted per experimental data point\nWestern-blot analysis\nRat cells were collected for Western-blot analysis as\npreviously described (Feigenson et al., 2009). Cells were\nmin, 3 or 48 h.

Blots were stripped and\nreprobed with GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehy-\ndrogenase; 1:2,500, Chemicon International) as a loading\ncontrol for protein quantification.

QPCR was performed using SYBR\nGreen (Applied Biosystems) with the MXPro 3000P.\nQuantification was determined using the SYBR Green with\nthe Dissociation Curve method, as per the protocol of the\nmanufacturer.

All images were mounted using Vectashield\n(Vector). Images were acquired with a Leica DFC360 Fx\ncamera, using Leica Application Suite 2.1.0 software. Images\nwere evenly enhanced using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe\nSystems, Mountain View, CA, U.S.A.).\nRESULTS\nWnt and BMP inhibit OL differentiation\nTo observe the effects of Wnt and BMP on OL development in\nvitro, we established primary cultures of OPCs from mouse or\nrat brain and purified them to remove astrocytes and other\nnon-OL lineage cells. Cells were grown to confluency on\ncoverslips or dishes, subsequently growth factors were\nremoved and DM was added with or without BMP4 (50 ng/\nml) or Wnt3a (50 ng/ml). We selected BMP4 because, of all\nthe BMP signalling effectors, it is the most intimately\ninvolved and most abundant during OL development (Ara et\nmaximal effect in our previous studies (Grinspan et al., 2000;\nSee et al., 2004). We selected Wnt3a as an effector of\ncanonical Wnt signalling based on its location in developing\ndorsal spinal cord and its effects on OPCs from previous\ndose2response curve showed that 50 ng/ml Wnt3a most\neffectively inhibited OPCs from differentiating (K. Feigenson\nand J.B. Grinspan, results not shown). After 3 days in DM, the\ntreated samples were processed for IHC (immunohistochem-\nistry), and labelled with antibodies directed against GalC, a\nmarker of early differentiation, and A2B5, which labels OPCs.\nIn control conditions, 26% of rat cells expressed GalC, and\n67% were labelled with A2B5, as observed in previous studies\n(Feigenson et al., 2009). The overlap in labelling between\nA2B5 and GalC is temporary and the A2B5 labelling will\nslowly disappear as the OLs mature (Crang et al., 2004;\nFeigenson et al., 2009). In contrast, GalC labelling was almost\ncompletely absent in BMP4 treatment conditions, while\nA2B5 labelling was unchanged. Wnt3a treatment reduced\ndecrease we have observed previously, and also did not\nsignificantly affect the amount of cells being labelled with\nA2B5 or alter their morphology (Figures 1A and 1C).\nTo observe the effects of BMP4 and Wnt3a on the number\nof astrocytes in culture, we also immunolabelled cells with\nantibodies directed against GFAP. Control cultures and\ncultures treated with Wnt3a contained fewer than 5%\nastrocytes, while in BMP4-treated cultures the number\n1D). We have previously shown that neither signalling factor\nhad any significant impact on the amount of cells undergoing\napoptosis, proliferation or differentiation into neurons\nindicate that BMP4 can completely inhibit OPC differenti-\nation and induce astrogliogenesis, while Wnt3a can partially\ninhibit OPC differentiation without having an impact on\nastrocyte cell fate.\nA BMP inhibitor blocks the effects of both BMP4\nand Wnt3a signalling but a Wnt inhibitor blocks\nonly Wnt3a signalling\nTo determine whether there is a relationship between the\nWnt and BMP signalling pathways, pharmacological inhibi-\ntors of canonical Wnt signalling were added concurrently\nwith BMP4 and pharmacological inhibitors of BMP signalling\nwere added concurrently with Wnt3a. Noggin (500 ng/ml), an\ninhibitor of canonical BMP signalling, was added to confluent\ncell cultures along with DM, 50 ng/ml BMP4 or 50 ng/ml\nWnt3a. Noggin treatment alone did not alter the number of\nGalC+ cells relative to control conditions (Figure 2A).\nAlthough OPCs secrete both BMP and noggin, the secreted\nnoggin normally limits the endogenous effects of BMP\n(Kondo and Raff, 2004). Noggin added with BMP4 completely\nblocked the effect of BMP4 and the number of GalC+ cells\nwas not significantly different from the untreated control\ncondition (Figure 2A). Similarly, when noggin was added\nalong with Wnt3a, the number of GalC+ cells was the same as\nin the untreated control condition, indicating that blocking\nthe BMP signalling pathway blocks the inhibitory actions of\nBMP4 and Wnt3a on OPC differentiation in vitro (Figure 2A).\nTo determine whether blocking the canonical Wnt\nsignalling pathway could block BMP signalling, we treated\nOPC cultures with Dkk-1, an inhibitor of canonical Wnt\nsignalling. Dkk-1 treatment (100 ng/ml) alone did not alter\nthe number of GalC+ cells relative to control conditions.\nWhen used concurrently with Wnt3a, however, Dkk-1 blocked\nK.

In contrast, BMP4 completely\ninhibited GalC expression in cells even when treated\nconcurrently with Dkk-1 (Figure 2B), indicating that blocking\nthe canonical Wnt signalling pathway does not block the\nBMP signalling pathway in vitro. These results suggest that\nBMP4 does not signal upstream of the canonical Wnt\npathway, and that the BMP pathway is not dependent on\nthe Wnt signalling pathway.\nGenetic ablation of the BMP signalling pathway\nblocks the effects of BMP4 and Wnt3a\nWe next used a genetic model to help determine the\nrelationship between BMP4 and Wnt3a and confirm our\npharmacological results. We obtained Bmpr1 DKO mice in\nwhich both BMPR1A and BMPR1B have been functionally\ninactivated in the neural tube by E10.5 using the Bcre-32\ntransgenic allele. These mice have been characterized\ncultured from the animals are able to differentiate, do not\ntranslocate Smad (a downstream effector of BMP signalling)\nto the nucleus, and do not respond to BMP treatment\n(See et al., 2007). We generated cultures from these DKO\n(double-knockout) animals as well as from single KOs\n(knockouts; Bmpr1b KO, Bmpr1a KO) and normal littermates.\nWe then treated these cultures with DM alone or DM\ncontaining BMP4 or Wnt3a.\nBMP4 completely eliminated GalC expression in normal\nmouse OPC cultures after 3 days in DM, and Wnt3a reduced\nthe number of GalC+ cells by 41%. The number of A2B5+\ncells did not vary from control conditions, replicating our\nprevious findings in control cultures. These results were\nfurther replicated in OPC cultures from Bmpr1a KO and\nBmpr1b KO mice (Figure 3A). In the Bmpr1 DKO OPC cultures\nthat were untreated or treated with BMP4, the cells\ndifferentiated to the extent of the normal cells, as we have\npreviously shown (See et al., 2007). This indicates that the\nOPCs from animals without BMP signalling are able to\ndifferentiate normally but do not respond to BMP4. Similarly,\nwhen the Bmpr1 DKO OPC cultures were treated with Wnt3a,\nthe number of GalC+ cells was not significantly different\nFigure 2 Pharmacological inhibition of the BMP pathway blocks the\neffects of Wnt3a and BMP4 on OL differentiation\nOPC cultures were placed in DM for 3 days, alone or with BMP4 or Wnt3.\nNoggin or DKK-1 was added to similarly treated cells.

Similarly, Wnt3a treatment reduced the\nnumber of GalC+ cells by 39% relative to controls (P,0.05), but concurrent\nnoggin treatment rescued this effect (n57).

These results indicate that when the BMP\nsignalling pathway is completely abrogated, the canonical\nWnt signalling pathway is similarly prevented from exerting\nan inhibitory effect on OPC differentiation. Further, when\neither Bmpr1a or Bmpr1b is individually deleted, the other\ntype I receptor can compensate to maintain the integrity of\nthe BMP signalling pathway and allow it to influence OL\ndevelopment. Our combined pharmacological and genetic\nresults suggest that we can successfully block the effects of\nWnt3a on OL differentiation by abrogating the BMP\nsignalling pathway via two independent methods.\nGenetic inhibition of the canonical Wnt\nsignalling pathway blocks the effect of Wnt3a,\nbut not that of BMP4, on OL differentiation\nTo observe the effectiveness of canonical Wnt signalling and\ncanonical BMP signalling on OL development when the Wnt\nsignalling pathway has been effectively eliminated, we\nemployed mutant mice with a conditional KO of the nuclear\neffector of canonical Wnt signalling, b-catenin [b-Cat-null\n(b-catenin loss of function mutant mice)].

In these mutant mice, the Wnt\nsignalling pathway is inhibited in all cells of OL lineage by\npreventing active b-catenin from being produced.\nMice were viable at P1 and OPC cultures were generated\nfrom mutants and normal littermates as previously described.\nCultures were treated with DM with or without BMP4 or\nWnt3a. Treatment with Wnt3a did not change the number of\nGalC+ cells relative to DM in the b-Cat-null OPC cultures,\nindicating that canonical Wnt signalling was effectively\neliminated from OPCs (Figure 3B). In contrast, BMP4\ncompletely eliminated the expression of GalC in treated cells.\nThese results indicate that blocking the canonical Wnt\nsignalling pathway prevents the inhibitory effect of Wnt3a\non OL development, but not that of BMP4, and that the BMP\nsignalling pathway is not upstream of the Wnt signalling\npathway or dependent on the Wnt signalling pathway in this\nsystem.\nWnt3a does not up-regulate the canonical BMP\nsignalling pathway\nTo identify if Wnt signalling directly increases the BMP\nligand, we treated cultured OPC cultures with Wnt3a and\nlooked for changes in BMP4 protein by Western-blot analysis.\nWnt3a treatment did not result in an increase in BMP4\nprotein after 30 min or 3 h, when compared with untreated\nconditions or BMP4-positive control conditions (Figure 4A).\nLater time points at 2 and 5 days post-treatment also showed\nno sign of BMP4 up-regulation (results not shown). To see if\nWnt3a could up-regulate the canonical BMP signalling\npathway independently from increasing the amount of BMP\nligand, we treated cultured OPCs with BMP4 and Wnt3a and\nlooked for increases of phosphorylated-Smad 1/5/8.

If BMP and Wnt signalling reduce the\npercentage of GalC+ cells independently, we could expect to\nsee additional decreases in the number of mature OLs with\ncombined treatment. There were no significant decreases in\nGalC expression, however, in the combined treatment\ncondition when compared with conditions when either 10\nng/ml BMP4 or 50 ng/ml Wnt3a were added separately\n(Figure 5).\nTo determine what could restrict the effect of Wnt3a to a\nsubset of cells, we labelled OPC cultures with antibody to\nTCF4, the downstream transcriptional effector of canonical\nWnt signalling. Nuclear TCF4 labelling was observed in 46.7%\nof cultured OPCs (Figure 6), suggesting that it is the nuclear\nexpression of TCF4 that facilitates the effects of Wnt3a on OL\ndifferentiation. Taken together, these results are consistent\nwith the interpretation that the same downstream pathway\nis used by both signalling factors to inhibit OL maturation.\nIt is also consistent with our data that Wnt only affects a\nsubset of TCF4 expressing cells that are targeted in parallel by\nWnt3a and BMP4 increase expression of Id2\nWe used QPCR (quantitative real-time PCR) to determine\nwhat downstream effectors are influenced by both Wnt and\nBMP treatment. OPC cultures were obtained from normal rats\nas previously described. Cells were grown on 50 mm dishes\nand treated with Wnt3a or BMP4 for 6 and 48 h. We observed\na decrease in Mbp transcripts at 48 h after treatment with\nWnt3a and BMP4, mirroring our IHC results (Figure 7A).\nWhen assaying for Id2 mRNA, however, both Wnt3a and\nBMP4 significantly increased transcript levels (Figure 7B). IDs\n(inhibitor of DNA-binding proteins) are known inhibitors of\ndifferentiation, and previous studies have revealed that they\nare targets of BMP and Wnt signalling (Samanta and Kessler,\nBMP4 can target the same effectors of OL differentiation.\nWnt3a and BMP4 reduce levels of nuclear Olig2\nin OPCs\nID2 prevents the nuclear localization of Olig2 after\nstimulation with BMP4, thus inhibiting BMP signalling\n(Samanta and Kessler, 2004). We used IHC to examine the\nlocalization of Olig2 after treatment with either BMP4 or\nWnt3a. After 2 days of treatment, we observed a significant\ndecrease in the total number of cells in which Olig2 was\nclearly visible co-localized with cell nuclei in both BMP4- and\nWnt3a-treated cultures. There was a 55% reduction in Olig2\nand DAPI co-labelling in BMP4-treated cultures and a 19%\nreduction in Wnt3a-treated cultures relative to controls\n(Figures 8A and 8B). These results further indicate that\nBMP4 and Wnt3a are targeting common factors in OPC\ndifferentiation.\nFigure 5 Collective treatment with BMP4 and Wnt3a does not inhibit\nprecursor differentiation greater than individual treatment with BMP4 or\nRat OPCs were cultured and then placed in DM with 50 ng/ml BMP4, 10 ng/ml\ndays, 50 ng/ml BMP4 decreased GalC+ cells by 92% relative to control\n50 ng/ml Wnt3a combined with 10 ng/ml BMP4 decreased OPC differentiation\nby 44% (P,0.05).

In primary rodent OPC cultures, BMP4 by itself\nalmost completely eliminates OPC differentiation and signifi-\ncantly increases the number of astrocytes. Wnt3a by itself\ndecreases OPC differentiation by 30\u00ad40% without a corres-\nponding increase in astrocyte generation. Blocking the BMP\nsignalling pathway with pharmacological or genetic tech-\nniques at different points on the BMP pathway prevents the\neffects of both BMP4 and Wnt3a. In contrast, blocking the ca-\nnonical Wnt signalling pathway was able to counter the effect\nof Wnt3a on OPC differentiation, but not that of BMP4.\nTo address why Wnt3a only partially inhibits OL differ-\nentiation, in comparison with the complete inhibitory activity\nof BMP4, we examined downstream expression of Wnt\neffectors. We observed that 46.7% of OPCs in culture express\nTCF4, which corresponds to the decrease in differentiation\nafter Wnt3a treatment. This suggests two possibilities: TCF4\nis expressed only in a subset of OPCs or TCF4 is only\ntransiently expressed in all OPCs and 46.7% of these cells\nexpressed TCF4 at the time of treatment. Both possibilities\nindicate that the nuclear expression of TCF4 appears to\ncontrol the ability of Wnt3a to affect OL differentiation. This\nis consistent with the conclusions drawn by Fancy et al.\nTo find at what level BMP4 and Wnt3a may be inhibiting\nOPC differentiation, we performed QPCR and assayed for Id2\ntranscript levels. Both BMP4 and Wnt3a consistently re-\nduced transcript levels of Mbp, complementing our IHC\nresults, and also increased levels of Id2, in keeping with earlier\nactively involved in preventing OPC differentiation and OL\nmyelination, largely by preventing nuclear localization of Olig\nproteins to keep the timing of differentiation precise and\nBMP4 reduced the number of cells co-labelled with Olig2 in\nthe nucleus, indicating that both factors were actively\npreventing the nuclear activity and differentiating capabil-\nities of Olig2, possibly via ID2 induction. There was a larger\neffect of BMP4 treatment on both Olig2 and ID2 treatment\nwhen compared with Wnt3a treatment, consistent with our\ndifferentiation results.\nThe BMP and Wnt pathways have many contextually and\ntemporally dependent interactions throughout development\n(Itasaki and Hoppler, 2010). In the developing spinal cord,\noverexpression of either signalling factor alone induces a dor-\nsalized phenotype, whereas their removal produces ventralized\nphenotypes, indicating that both signals may have func-\ntionally similar, interacting or redundant effects (Nguyen et al.,\nsystems, the BMP pathway up-regulates or acts upstream of\nWnt signalling, such as in neural crest delamination (Burstyn-\nand dorsal/ventral patterning (Zechner et al., 2007). Conversely,\nFigure 7 BMP4 and Wnt3a regulate Id2 and Mbp transcript levels\nRat OPCs were cultured and treated with Wnt3a or BMP4 and assayed for\nQPCR. (A) After treatment for 48 h, levels of Mbp mRNA were calculated\ncompared with untreated control OPCs. DM-treated cells had a 7-fold\nincrease in Mbp expression over that of untreated cells and BMP4-treated\ncells (P,0.05). This expression was also 2.33-fold more than that of Wnt3a-\ntreated cells (P,0.05, n54). (B) After treatment for 6 h, levels of Id2 mRNA\nwere calculated compared with untreated control OPCs. BMP4 and Wnt3a\ntreatment increased Id2 transcript expression 4.7- and 2.2-fold, respectively\nFigure 8 BMP4 and Wnt3a decrease levels of Olig2\nMouse OPCs were cultured, placed in DM, and treated with Wnt3a or BMP4.\n(A) Two days after treatment, cells were labelled for Olig2 and A2B5.

In\nother contexts, Wnt and BMP signalling can be directly\nantagonistic, such as in neuroepithelial cell development\n(Ille et al., 2007), aspects of neural development (Gomez-\nHonda et al., 2010). In some systems, such as during aspects of\nlimb bud and apical ectodermal ridge formation, the BMP and\nWnt pathways can complexly regulate each other through\nparallel signalling and feedback systems (Soshnikova et al., 2003;\nOur results clearly demonstrate that the BMP pathway is\nessential for the Wnt pathway to inhibit OPC differentiation,\nas eliminating BMP signalling effectively blocks the effects of\nWnt3a. This is not just a result of the BMP antagonist\nsimultaneously blocking Wnt signalling, because genetic\nremoval of BMP receptors also prevented Wnt3a from\ninhibiting differentiation.\nThere are three potential mechanisms through which the\nBMP and Wnt pathways could interact. The most direct\nidentifiable interaction would be through the canonical Wnt\nsignalling pathway up-regulating phosphorylated-Smad, the\nmajor effector of canonical BMP signalling. However, we did\nnot detect increases in phosphorylated-Smad levels on Wnt3a\ntreatment, although we were able to consistently detect\nphosphorylated-Smad increases after standard BMP4 treat-\nment. It is possible that Wnt signalling may directly activate\nthe BMP signalling pathway at levels below detection in\nSmad assays. We also did not detect up-regulation of BMP\nprotein after Wnt3a treatment using Western-blot analysis.\nThe second interaction could involve activation of non-\ncanonical BMP pathways, including kinase mTOR (mammalian\ntarget of rapamycin)/FRAP via STAT3 (signal transducer and\nactivator of transcription), activated mitogen kinases and LIM\nkinase (Chen and Panchision, 2007 for review). In other\nsystems, such as multipotent neural precursor cells, BMP4\nactivates both canonical and non-canonical pathways for\nseparate effects (Rajan et al., 2003). It is possible that Wnts\nand BMPs interact through one of the non-canonical routes.\nThe possibility of signalling through multiple, alternative\npathways could also explain why both BMP4 and Wnt3a\ntreatment inhibit OPC differentiation and maintain similar\nlevels of A2B5+ cells, despite only BMP4 directly increasing\nthe number of astrocytes.\nFinally, If Wnt signalling does not up-regulate BMP signalling,\ndownstream mechanisms could be evoked. Some common\ntranscriptional targets of both pathways have Smad and TCF/\nLEF-binding sites in close proximity, indicating that the two\npathways have synergistic activity among their downstream\neffectors, including Emx2 (Theil et al., 2002), Msx2 (Willert et al.,\net al., 2001). The BMP and Wnt signalling pathways may also\ninteract during epigenetic regulation of OL differentiation.\nRecent studies have shown that HDACs (histone deacetylases)\ncompete with activated b-catenin to bind with TCF4. Bound to\nb-catenin, TCF4 acts as a transcriptional repressor of OL\ndifferentiation by up-regulating factors such as ID2/4. Bound\nto HDACs, TCF4 acts as a transcriptional repressor, inhibiting the\nactivity of ID2/4 and up-regulating myelin-promoting genes\ncanonical Wnt signalling depends on the BMP pathway to\ninhibit OL development; it is possible that the TCF transcriptional\ncomplex requires inherent Smad elements or other downstream\neffectors of BMP signalling to interact with IDs or other\ninhibitory elements. The transcriptional activity of the Wnt\nsignalling pathway may then rely on endogenous BMP func-\ntioning, and will therefore be inhibited when BMP signalling is\nabrogated.\nUnderstanding what signals regulate the timing mechanisms\nof OL maturation will facilitate the development of therapies for\nmyelin disorders. BMP up-regulation has been well documented\nin many types of CNS disease and demyelinating paradigms (See\nand Grinspan, 2009). Furthermore, several recent studies\ndemonstrate that Wnt signalling is active during white matter\ninjury as well, including aspects of axonal regeneration (Liu\net al., 2009). BMPs and Wnts interact in many intricate ways\nduring development, and it is likely that they have similar\ninteractions during CNS injury and recovery. It is, therefore,\nimportant to understand how these pathways function inde-\npendently and in relationship to one another. We have shown\nthat the BMP pathway is a competence factor for canonical Wnt\nsignalling to inhibit OPC differentiation in cell culture\nparadigms. Further experiments should investigate this inter-\naction during remyelination events and in CNS injury models.\nFUNDING\nThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health\nSclerosis Society [grant number RG4105A].\nREFERENCES\nAhn K, Mishina Y, Hanks MC, Behringer RR, Crenshaw EB III (2001) BMPR-IA\nsignaling is required for the formation of the apical ectodermal ridge and\nAlvarez-Medina R, Cayuso J, Okubo T, Takada S, Marti E (2008) Wnt canonical\npathway restricts graded Shh/Gli patterning activity through the\nK.
