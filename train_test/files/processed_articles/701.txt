A review, pub-\nlished in 1990, summarized the results from two cross-\nsectional studies (1, 2), four case-control studies (3-\n6), and two prospective studies (7, 8) and concluded\nthat a weak positive association between male pattern\nbaldness and coronary artery disease was supported by\nthe available data (9).

Although the odds ratio for any\nvertex baldness compared with no hair loss was 1.4\nratio increased with increasing degrees of vertex bald-\nbaldness. Another recently published study of a sam-\nple of Italian men examined the relation between car-\ndiovascular disease risk factors and baldness, finding\nthat men with fronto-occipital baldness had higher\ncholesterol levels and systolic blood pressure levels\nthan did men with no baldness or only frontal baldness\nBecause few data are available on this topic, espe-\ncially from prospective studies, we examined the re-\nlation between baldness and ischemic heart disease in\nthe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nI (NHANES I) Epidemiologic Follow-up Study.\n12-74 years participated in NHANES I, of whom\nexamination were subsequently followed. The meth-\nods of the original NHANES I survey and the\nNHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study have\nbeen presented in detail elsewhere (12-16). Cohort\nmembers have been followed through 1987.\nOnly participants from the first 65 sampling loca-\ntions received the dermatologic examination. This\nsample with proper weighting is representative of the\nUnited States population. Analysis in this study was\nlimited to the 4,479 male participants who had a\ndermatologic examination. A summary description of\nthe dermatologic examination, which was performed\nby third-year dermatology residents, has been pub-\nlished previously (17). Four levels of alopecia were\ncoded: none, minimum, moderate, and severe. Mini-\nmum baldness corresponded to no obvious baldness\nwhen the participant walked into the examination\nroom, but baldness was detected during the examina-\ntion. Moderate baldness corresponded to observable\nbaldness upon the first encounter with the participant.\nSevere baldness corresponded to obvious baldness at\nfirst encounter, and if the participant had any hair, it\nwas confined to the fringes (M. T. Johnson, personal\ncommunication, High Falls, New York, 1995). The\nexaminers recorded their evaluation of the level of\nbaldness for each participant, but made no distinction\nbetween frontal or vertex baldness.\nPotential confounders in the analysis were age, race,\neducation, cigarette smoking, systolic pressure, anti-\nhypertensive medication, cholesterol, body mass in-\ndex, and self-reported diabetes. For smoking, we used\na variable that was constructed in part from responses\nobtained during the baseline interview and in part from\nthe first follow-up interview, conducted from 1982\nthrough 1984. The validity of this approach has been\nA single blood pressure measurement was obtained\nin the sitting position for some participants, and two\nblood pressures were obtained for a subgroup of par-\nticipants. Only the first blood pressure was used. A\nsingle cholesterol measurement was obtained by using\na modification of the Abell-Kendall method (16). Di-\nabetes status was defined from affirmative answers to\nthe question, \"Has a doctor ever told you that you have\ndiabetes, and if so, do you still have it?\" or to the\nquestions. \"Do you have any reason to think that you\nmay have diabetes, sometimes called sugar diabetes or\nsugar disease?\" and \"Did a doctor tell you that you had\nit?\"\nDeaths were classified as being due to ischemic\nheart disease if the underlying code listed one of the\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-\nsion, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes 410-\n414. Ischemic heart disease incidence was defined as\nthe earlier occurrence of a death based on the under-\nlying code or a hospitalization with the ICD-9-CM\ndiagnoses. Participants who reported at baseline that\nthey had had a previous heart attack were excluded\nfrom the analysis.\nDeaths were identified through searches of the Na-\ntional Death Index, through the Health Care Financing\nAdministration enrollee files, and by other tracing\nmechanisms. A participant was considered deceased\nonly if a death certificate was received or a proxy\ninterview was completed to verify the death. Death\ncertificates have been obtained for 96.8 percent of\ndeceased participants. Participants were asked about\nhospitalizations during the study period. If any were\nreported, permission was asked to abstract certain data\nsuch as admission and discharge dates and diagnoses.\nMedical records were recorded by trained medical\ncoders using ICD-9-CM codes.\nWith the direct method, means for continuous vari-\nables, proportions of categorical variables, and rates of\nischemic heart disease mortality and incidence were\nage-adjusted using five age groups for all men and\nthree age groups for men younger than 55 years de-\nrived to the 1980 US population. We tested for linear\ntrend of various ischemic heart disease risk factors\nacross levels of baldness by conducting linear regres-\nsion analyses for continuous dependent variables and\nlogistic regression analyses for categorical dependent\nvariables. We also tested for linear trends of mortality\nand incidence rates across levels of baldness. In these\ntrend analyses, we assigned a value of one to four to\nthe levels of baldness. To examine the independent\npredictive power of male pattern baldness, we used\nproportional hazards regressions that included age, age\nsquared, race, education, smoking status, systolic pres-\nsure, antihypertensive medication, cholesterol, diabe-\ntes, and body mass index. All analyses presented in\nthis paper were performed with the software\nSUDAAN (20), which accounts for the complex sam-\nBaldness and Ischemic Heart Disease 653\npling design of the study. Proportionality assumptions\nwere checked using the SAS procedure Proc PHREG\nby creating time-dependent covariates for the indepen-\ndent variables (21). The effect on the regression coef-\nficients of stratifying on variables that did not meet the\nproportionality assumptions was tested using Proc\nPHREG and was found to be minimal.\nRESULTS\nOf the 4,479 men who participated in the dermato-\nlogic examination, 3,994 men had data on baldness,\nage, and cause of death after those who were lost to\nfollow-up and prevalent cases of myocardial infarction\nat baseline were eliminated. A total of 3,932 men who\nhad complete data for all variables were included in\nthe proportional hazards regression analyses. Among\nthese men, there were 378 deaths from ischemic heart\ndisease and 939 incident events of ischemic heart\nmen had complete data. Among these men, 61 deaths\nand 239 incident events of ischemic heart disease were\nrecorded.\nParticipants who were lost to follow-up were\nyounger, had less education, had a lower mean body\nmass index, and were more likely to be current smok-\ners than were participants who were included in the\nanalyses. The two groups did not differ significantly in\nTABLE 1.

Among all\nmen, a significant increasing linear trend across cate-\ngories of baldness was present only for age (table 1).\nThe mean body mass index level among participants\nwith severe baldness was higher than that among par-\nticipants with lesser degrees of baldness. Among men\nyounger than age 55 years, a significant increasing\nlinear trend for the percentage of current smokers was\nalso noted. In addition, men with severe baldness had\nhigher levels of cholesterol than men did with no\nbaldness, had a higher mean body mass index than did\nmen with lesser degrees of baldness, and had the\nhighest prevalence of smoking. Among men aged 55\nyears and older, significant linear trends were ob-\nserved for age and body mass index. The difference in\ncholesterol levels between moderate and severe bald-\nness was significant.\nIn general, ischemic heart disease mortality and\nincidence rates were the highest among men with\nsevere baldness (table 2). However, none of the linear\ntrends were statistically significant.\nMale pattern baldness was not associated with an\nincreased rate of mortality from or incidence of isch-\nemic heart disease among all men in this study (table\n3). Neither in a reduced proportional hazards model\nwith age, race, and education nor in the full model did\nmale pattern baldness significantly predict mortality\nfrom ischemic heart disease.\nBecause the literature suggested that baldness was a\nrisk factor for younger men, we examined an age-\nbaldness interaction by dichotomizing age into\nyounger than 55 years and 55 years and older. For the\nincidence analysis but not for the mortality analysis,\nthe model containing the interaction terms was signif-\nicantly different from the model without the interac-\ntion terms.\nAmong men younger than age 55 years, the rate\nratios for severe male pattern baldness were 2.51 (95\n(table 3). A significantly elevated rate ratio for mini-\nmal baldness was also found among younger men for\nischemic heart disease incidence. However, no consis-\ntent dose-response effect according to degree of bald-\nness was present.\nBaldness and Ischemic Heart Disease 655\nTABLE 3.

The\nmodels containing this variable as a main effect as\nwell as an interaction with baldness showed no evi-\ndence that this familial baldness was a significant\npredictor over and above baldness alone.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study of a nationally representative sample of\nmen in the United States, we found evidence that\nsevere male pattern baldness among men younger than\n55 years predicted mortality from and incidence of\nischemic heart disease. The association between se-\nvere baldness among younger men and ischemic heart\ndisease agrees with the results from previous studies\n(10). In addition, some significant differences in isch-\nemic heart disease risk factors according to degree of\nbaldness were present, particularly among the younger\nmen.\nThis is only the third prospective study to examine\nthe association between baldness and ischemic heart\ndisease. Persson and Johansson (7) followed 464 men\ncoronary artery disease compared with 19.7 percent of\nmen who were not bald. However, baldness was not\nspecifically defined in the study, and no adjustments\nwere made for other cardiovascular risk factors. In the\nChicago Peoples Gas Company Study, 1,594 men\ndid baldness predict the development of coronary ar-\ntery disease. In that study, men with advanced bald-\nness had higher cholesterol levels than did men with\nless baldness.\nThe possible association between male pattern bald-\nness and ischemic heart disease has not been well\nexplained. Male pattern baldness is clearly not a direct\nrisk factor for ischemic heart disease, but rather a\nmarker for some other underlying risk factor (9). A\nhormonal hypothesis related to excess androgens is\nusually proposed as a factor common to both alopecia\nand ischemic heart disease (9, 10, 22). Although an\nexcess of androgens is thought to be associated with\nbaldness, available evidence does not strongly support\na role for an elevated level of androgens as a risk\nfactor for ischemic heart disease. Several case-control\nstudies have found either lower levels of dihydrotest-\nosterone and testosterone (23-28) or similar levels\n(29-31) among myocardial survivors and patients\nwith severe atherosclerosis compared with controls.\nBaldness may be related to ischemic heart disease\nthrough its association with other unmeasured risk\nfactors.\nAdvantages of our study include its prospective\nnature and representativeness and the inclusion of\nvarious other ischemic heart disease risk factors. How-\never, as in other studies, we were unable to distinguish\nbetween frontal and vertex baldness because the loca-\ntion of baldness was not collected at the baseline\nexamination. This distinction may be important be-\ncause vertex baldness has been associated with cardio-\nvascular disease, whereas frontal baldness has not (2,\n10). However, it is likely that severely bald men would\nhave a significant component of vertex baldness. In\naddition, baldness can be caused by various condi-\ntions. Insofar as baldness from other causes mimics\nmale pattern baldness, some misclassification is also\nconceivable. Little is known about the reliability or\nvalidity of the baseline examinations. However,\ntrained third-year dermatology residents conducted the\ndermatologic portion of the examination. It seems\nlikely that misclassification of baldness was most pro-\nnounced between minimum and moderate baldness.\nThis may account for the lack of a graded dose re-\nsponse according to level of baldness. Endpoints were\ndetermined principally from death certificates, hospi-\ntal records, and interviews with survivors or proxies.\nTherefore, some degree of misclassification of out-\ncome undoubtedly occurred. If this misclassification\nwere random, then the likely effect would have been\nan underestimation of the associations.\nIn summary, we found a positive association be-\ntween severe male pattern baldness and ischemic heart\ndisease among men younger than age 55 years. This\nassociation is consistent with other published reports.\nAlthough the underlying mechanism for this associa-\ntion is unclear, the presence of severe male pattern\nbaldness may help to identify individuals with an\nincreased risk of ischemic heart disease. Because no\nunderlying mechanism has been identified, no direct\nintervention is currently available, and therefore, the\nquestion arises about how to counsel a severely bald\npatient. Cardiovascular risk factors should be re-\nviewed carefully in such patients, who should be en-\ncouraged to improve their cardiovascular risk profiles.\nREFERENCES\n1.
