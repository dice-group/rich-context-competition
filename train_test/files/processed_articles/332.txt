Information on adolescents' weight loss attempts were obtained by questionnaire. Normal weight was defined as a\nbody mass index (BMI) less than the 85th percentile for age and gender. Overweight was defined as a BMI equal to or greater\nthan the 85th percentile for age and gender. Nutritional intake was assessed with a 24 h recall and food frequency questionnaire.\nRESULTS: There was a two-fold increase in smoking among normal-weight adolescent girls who reported trying to lose weight\n(23.7% vs 12.6%, P < 0.01). In contrast, prevalence of smoking was similar among overweight adolescent girls who tried to lose\nweight compared to those who did not (15.8% vs 14.1%, P \u00bc 0.76). Similar trends were observed in boys. However, overweight\nboys who were trying to lose weight were less likely to smoke than overweight boys who were not trying to lose weight (9.8% vs\n24.5%, P < 0.05). There were no differences in body weight, BMI, caloric intake or fat intake among smokers and non-smokers.\nHowever, smokers reported eating less fruit and vegetables compared to non-smokers, and were over five times more likely to\nCONCLUSION: Tobacco use is common among normal weight adolescents trying to lose weight. Tobacco use is also associated\nwith a cluster of other unhealthy dietary practices in adolescents.\nKeywords: adolescent; smoking; dieting\nIntroduction\nAlthough it has been suggested that adolescents may use\ntobacco as a form of weight control, the prevalence of this\npractice is unknown. Ryan and colleagues have reported that\nadolescent Irish girls who report recent dieting are over twice\nas likely to smoke as adolescents who do not report weight\nloss attempts.1 In addition, data from Tomeo et al2 and\nFrench et al3 also suggest that smoking among girls was\nassociated with almost a two-fold risk of dieting. In fact,\nthe Expert Committee on the Evaluation and Treatment of\nChildhood Obesity recommends that smoking cessation\nshould be one of the cornerstones of treating overweight\nchildren, along with improved parenting skills, reduced\ncaloric intake and increased activity levels.4\nPrevious studies on the relationship between smoking and\ndieting have relied on self-reported smoking behavior in\nadolescents. While self-reported smoking behavior is gener-\nally considered a reliable measure of actual smoking in\nadolescents, biases may exist in the data depending on the\nsetting that the information was obtained.5,6 In addition,\nprevious studies have also not examined whether smoking\nwas more prevalent among either normal-weight or over-\nweight adolescents who were trying to lose weight or\nwhether nutritional intake was actually different among\nsmokers and non-smokers.\nTo address the association of dieting and adolescent\nsmoking, data were analyzed from the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey, cycle III (NHANES III), a\nnationally representative sample of children and adults.\nComprehensive data including weight, height, weight loss\nattempts, smoking habits, and serum cotinine levels allowed\n*Correspondence: RS Strauss, Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology and\nNutrition, UMDMJ -- Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, One Robert\nE-mail: strausrs@rwja.umdnj.edu\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nfor analysis of the relationship of smoking to weight loss\nattempts in overweight and normal-weight adolescents. Data\nfrom both 24 h dietary recall and a food frequency ques-\ntionnaire also allowed for the analysis of the relationship\nbetween smoking and nutritional intake among adolescents.\nMethods\nSample\nThe National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey,\nCycle III (NHANES III) is the seventh in a series of large\nnational health examination surveys conducted in the\nUnited States since the 1960s. The first phase of NHANES\nIII examined a nationally representative sample of children\nable on over 99% of the children. Serum cotinine levels were\navailable on 1132 of the adolescents (85% of eligible cohort).\nAnthropometrics\nBody weight and height were measured according to pre-\nviously described methods.7 Reference body mass index\n(BMI) percentiles were derived from the first National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey.8 This definition\nis in accordance with recommendations of the Expert Com-\nmittee on Clinical Guidelines for Overweight in Adoles-\ncence9 and Expert Committee on Obesity Evaluation and\nTreatment.4 Normal weight was defined as a BMI (kg=m2) less\nthan the 85th percentile for age and gender; we classified\nadolescents with a BMI (kg=m2) greater than the 85th per-\ncentile for age and gender as overweight.11,12\nSmoking, weight loss attempts and nutritional\nassessment\nAdolescents were asked about frequency of smoking and\nnumber of cigarettes smoked per day. In addition, adoles-\ncents were also asked whether they had tried to lose weight\nwithin the last 12 months. Nutritional intake was assessed\nusing a food frequency questionnaire and 24 h diet recall.\nThe food frequency questionnaire included an assessment of\nalcohol intake. Previous studies have demonstrated the\nvalidity and reliability of reported adolescent alcohol\nintake.10 \u00ad 12 Intake of fat and energy were calculated using\nthe USDA's Survey Nutrient Data Base (SNDB) based on the\n24 h dietary recall, which the adolescents provided them-\nselves. Interviews were conducted privately, by trained study\nstaff, and staff performance was monitored routinely.\nLaboratory testing\nSerum cotinine levels were measured using an isotope dilu-\ntion, liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry\nmethod. Cotinine, a long-lasting metabolite of nicotine\n\u00bc 15 \u00ad 20 h), is considered the most specific and sensitive\nbiological marker of cigarette smoking.13 Serum cotinine cut-\noff levels of 15 ng=ml were used to designate smokers and\nnon-smokers. Previous studies using the NHANES III data\nhave demonstrated a 96% concordance between self-\nreported smoking status and serum cotinine levels above or\nStatistics\nFor the purposes of this study, `adolescents' were defined as\n12 \u00ad 18-y-old children and `smokers' were defined as those\nadolescents with a serum cotinine level of 15 ng=ml or\nhigher. Since the NHANES III study oversampled black\npeople, Hispanic people, and younger adolescents, the data\nwere adjusted to account for unequal selection by using\nsample weights provided by NHANES III. Differences in\nproportions were assessed using chi-square. Odds ratios\nwere calculated using logistic regression. Multivariate logistic\nregression analysis was utilized to assess the independent\neffects of smoking on nutritional intake after adjusting for\nage, gender and family income. In order to adjust for com-\nplex sample design and clustering effects in the NHANES III\nsample, statistical significance was assessed using the\nbalanced repeated replication method using the software\npackage WesVarPC (Westat Inc., Rockville, MD).\nResults\nOverall concordance between self-reported smoking status\nand serum cotinine levels was 92.7% (Table 1). In particular,\n96.5% of adolescents with cotinine levels below 15 ng=ml\nwere self-reported non-smokers while 69.6% of adolescents\nwith serum cotinine levels above 15 ng=ml were self-reported\nsmokers. As a result, sensitivity for self-report was 77% and\nspecificity was 95%. For both boys and girls, prevalence of\nboth self-reported smoking and elevated serum cotinine\nlevels were significantly more common in older adolescents\ncompared to younger adolescents (P < 0.001).

By using\nobjective measures of smoking status, this study has con-\nfirmed previous findings showing a similarly increased risk of\nsmoking among girls who report either excessive weight\nconcerns or frequent dieting.1 \u00ad 3 In contrast, there was no\nincreased risk of smoking among either overweight girls or\noverweight boys trying to lose weight. In fact, overweight\nboys who were trying to lose weight were significantly less\nlikely to smoke than those who were not trying to lose\nweight. These results imply that normal-weight girls may\nadopt more pathological methods of weight loss than over-\nweight girls and boys.\nOverall dietary intake was worse in adolescents who\nsmoked compared to those who did not. While there were\nno detectable differences in reported caloric or fat intake\namong adolescent smokers and non-smokers, smokers ate\nsignificantly less fresh fruit and vegetables. Similar findings\nhave been previously reported by Coulson and colleagues.15\nStudies in adults also report less healthy diets in smokers\ncompared to non-smokers. A meta-analysis of over 60 studies\nin adults examining patterns of nutrient intake in smokers\nrevealed a slight increase in total calories and fat among\nsmokers as well as decreased intake of fiber, fruit and vege-\ntables.16 Adolescent smokers were also more than five times\nmore likely to consume alcohol on a regular basis than\nnon-smokers. In addition, Crisp and colleagues have\nNon-smokers Smokersa Difference Adjusted differenceb\nReported 24 h intake:\nFood frequency:\nMean\u00c6 s.e.\naSerum cotinine level ! 15 ng=ml.\nbDifference adjusted for age, gender, body mass index.\nSmoking and weight loss attempts\nRS Strauss and HM Mir\nInternational Journal of Obesity\ndemonstrated more than a seven-fold increase in alcohol\nconsumption among adolescents who smoke.17 Therefore,\nthis study confirms the clustering of adolescent smoking\nwith adverse health and dietary behaviors which has been\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that almost 40% of\nadolescents believe that smoking can help control their\nweight.20,21 Although the cross-sectional design of the\nstudy precludes any definitive conclusions on the relation-\nship between smoking and weight loss, the finding of similar\nBMI as well as caloric and fat intake in both smokers and\nnon-smokers argues against any major relationship between\nsmoking and appetite suppression. Although there is ample\nevidence that smoking cessation in adults typically leads to\n3 \u00ad 5 kg weight gain, there is no evidence that smoking\ninitiation leads to weight loss.22 Both the Coronary Artery\nRisk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA) and the\nNurses Health Study demonstrate similar degrees of weight\ngain over a 7 \u00ad 8 y period in those who initiated smoking and\nthose who never smoked.23,24 Unfortunately, the NHANES III\ndata does not include objective measures of physical activity\nor energy expenditure which could be influenced by nicotine\nor other cigarette byproducts.25\nThe causal mechanism for the association between smok-\ning and dieting among adolescents remains speculative.\nWhile it is likely that many adolescents begin smoking in\norder to lose weight, it is also possible that dieting leads to\nincreased rates of smoking and alcohol use. Krahn and\ncolleagues have hypothesized that the feelings of deprivation\nassociated with dieting may increase the desire for both\ncigarettes and alcohol.26 In animal models, food deprivation\nis one of the most powerful stimulants for increased self-\nadministration drugs, alcohol and nicotine.27 In young\nhave shown that the prevalence of daily alcohol use\nincreases dramatically after the onset of bulimia.\nIn this study, serum cotinine levels were used as an\nobjective measure of smoking. While previous studies have\ngenerally confirmed the reliability of self-reported smoking,\nmany adolescent smokers underestimate the amount of\ncigarettes they smoke or even deny smoking.6 Murray and\ncolleagues have demonstrated that adolescent disclosure of\ncigarette smoking is also different when adolescents are\npromised confidentiality but not anonymity compared to\nwhen the adolescents are promised both confidentiality and\nanonymity.6 In this study, the results were both confidential\nand anonymous. Nevertheless, the sensitivity and specificity\nof self-reported smoking among adolescents was 77% and\n95%, respectively, which is comparable to results obtained by\nother authors using similar methodology.31 \u00ad 33\nIn summary, the use of the NHANES III data and its\ninclusion of serum cotinine levels provides the most objec-\ntive measure of the relationship between smoking and\nattempted weight loss in adolescence. Normal-weight ado-\nlescent girls who are trying to lose weight are particularly\nlikely to smoke. In addition, these results also highlight the\nclustering of high-risk health patterns among adolescents --\nsmoking, dieting, alcohol consumption, and poor fruit and\nvegetable intake. Although many adolescents believe that\nsmoking will decrease their weight, this study demonstrates\nsimilar BMI, caloric intake and fat intake among smokers.\nReferences\n1 Ryan Y, Gibney MJ, Flynn MAT.
