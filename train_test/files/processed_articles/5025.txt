    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe motion trajectory of an object's cast shadow has been shown to alter the perceived trajectory\nof a casting object, an effect that holds even if the cast shadow appears unrealistic. This raises the\nquestion of whether a cast shadow per se is necessary for this influence, a question that has been\nstudied only with stationary targets. We examined the relative influence of a shadow and a spherical\nobject on the perceived motion trajectory of an identical spherical object, using a paradigm similar to\nKersten, Mamassian, and Knill's ball-in-box animation. We recorded both depth and height estimates\nof the perceived end-point of the target trajectory as a function of various target and context\ntrajectories. Both shadows and objects significantly influenced the perceived trajectory of the\ntarget, though the influence of the shadow was overall stronger. We conjecture that the influence\nof the object reveals the assumption that similar objects moving at the same speed and in similar\ndirections are perceived to move within the same plane, a plane subject to a fronto-parallel bias.\n",

Contextual cues in our visual environment tend\nto disambiguate an otherwise ambiguous retinal input. Shadows are such a cue; they have\nbeen shown to have a profound impact on the perceived position and motion trajectory of the\ncasting object to which they are perceived to be attached (Kersten, Knill, Mamassian, &\nBu\nWhen one talks about shadows, one may refer to either attached or cast shadows: the\nformer refers to a region of an object receiving weaker illumination from a light source,\nCorresponding author:\nMarouane Ouhnana, Department of Ophthalmology, McGill Vision Research, 1650 Cedar Avenue, Room L11.416,\nEmail: marouane.ouhnana@mail.mcgill.ca\ni-Perception\nipe.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without\nfurther permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sage-\npub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nwhereas the latter refers to a region of a surface or object that is occluded from the light\nsource (see review by Mamassian, Knill, & Kersten, 1998). In this communication, we are\ninterested in cast shadows, and how their influences compare to those of a secondary object\non the perceived motion direction of a target object.\nThe first exploration of this question was undertaken by Ni et al. (2004) using a display\ncomprised of two flat disks, one above the other, set against a grass-textured ground plane.\nThe lower disc had various thicknesses and was textured to either resemble the upper disc or\nshaded dark to resemble a shadow. The discs were either stationary or moved horizontally\nback and forth along with the background to simulate head movements, but without motion\nparallax. The display therefore simulated a stationary object in both situations. The task was\nto estimate the perceived distance of the upper disc. Results showed that the upper disc\nwas perceived to be significantly closer to the ground-contact position of the lower disk\nwhen the latter appeared as a shadow compared to when it was shaded to resemble the\nupper disc.\nCast shadows are tied to the objects that cast them, with the exact position of a shadow\nalso determined by the position of the light source. Thus, when an object moves, so does its\ncast shadow. Hence, the influence of a shadow is likely to be greatest when both the casting\nobject and the shadow are in motion. Kersten et al. (1994) demonstrated that the motion\ntrajectory of a cast shadow significantly altered the perceived motion trajectory of the casting\nobject--a spherical ball. When the shadow moved diagonally, the casting object appeared to\nrecede and move along the ground, whereas when it moved horizontally, the casting object\nappeared to rise up in the frontal plane. Interestingly, the influence of the shadow was found\nto occur even when its contrast polarity was reversed. An interesting corollary to the\nflexibility with which shadows exert their influence is that incongruent shadows, that is,\nthose whose positions and shapes do not accord with the laws of physical optics, are\nalbeit with some measurable perceptual costs (Castiello, 2001). Such perceptual flexibility\nraises the possibility that Gestalt principles alone might be sufficient to explain the perceptual\nshifts observed in Kersten et al.'s (1994) moving ball experiments. The Gestalt principle\nthat springs to mind is common-fate, which states that objects that appear to move\ntogether group together (Wertheimer, 1923). Common-fate may have a corollary: Objects\nthat group together are perceived to move together. Such a grouping principle might even\npredict a stronger influence of a similar object on the target than a shadow. On the other\nhand, shadows may be a more powerful contextual cue due to the tight constraints under\nwhich they occur in the natural world.\nThe aim of this communication is to examine the relative influence of shadows and objects\non the perceived motion trajectory of a primary object. For this purpose, we have employed a\nparadigm similar to Kersten et al.'s (1994) ball-in-box-animation, with observers making\nperceptual estimates of the motion trajectory of a dynamic target object in the presence of\ndiverging trajectories of either cast shadows or a secondary bottom object.\nGeneral Methods\nSubjects\nFive observers participated in the experiment. All observers were nai\u00a8ve to the experimental\naims and had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. Written consent was obtained\nfrom all test participants, and all experimental protocols were approved by the McGill\nUniversity Research Ethics Board.\nApparatus\nThe stimuli were created using open-source 3D computer graphics software Blender version\n2.67b. The stimuli were displayed using MATLAB version 8.1 with the Psychophysics Toolbox\nVersion 3 extensions. The stimuli were presented on an Apple LED Cinema display connected\nto an Apple Mac Pro. The resolution of the display was set to 2,560 \u00c2 1,440 with a refresh rate\nof 60Hz. Observers were seated 60cm away from the display.\nStimuli\nA display similar to the (Kersten et al., 1994) ball-in-box-animation was recreated using\nBlender. A spherical light source simulated lighting from above and placed in XYZ Blender\nspace (0, 0, 20). The energy and distance of the light source were set to 6 and 100, respectively.\nThe camera was placed in XYZ Blender space of (0, \u00ad34, 8) with a XYZ rotation of (80, 0, 0)\nusing perspective view with a focal length of 35. Rendered animations had a resolution of\nTarget Stimulus\nThe target stimulus was created using Blender's UV sphere mesh, shaded gray with\nspecularities set to 0.5. The UV sphere mesh size was set to 0.41 for all XYZ Blender scale\nunits. See the top sphere in both left and right hand side of Figure 1 for an example of the\ntarget sphere. The target sphere was rendered following a specific fixed diagonal trajectory for\neach of the starting location conditions and was described later in the text.\nContext Stimuli\nContext stimuli were created in a similar manner to the target stimulus and positioned below\nthe target. The UV sphere mesh size was set to 0.37 for all XYZ Blender scale units. The size\nFigure 1. Target (top-sphere) and two context conditions: left, an identical secondary sphere; right, a cast\nshadow.\nOuhnana and Kingdom 3\ndifference between the top and bottom UV sphere was designed to compensate for the\ncamera's perspective scaling, in other words to equate the perceptual size of both target\nand context stimuli. Two types of context figure were used, a cast shadow and a bottom-\nsphere identical to the target figure. When the context was a sphere, the shading was similar\nto the target stimulus. When the context was a cast shadow, the UV sphere was set to 100%\ntransparency and set to cast a shadow. Figure 1 shows both context stimuli with the target.\nThe context stimuli could follow four possible trajectories each starting at one of three\npossible locations, and these are described later.\nGround Surface\nA textured surface was rendered with an XYZ Blender scale of (10, 10, 01) and placed in the\ncenter of the 3D space. Rectangular skeleton ``goal posts'' were rendered on each side of the\ntextured surface and represented the region within which observers could position their\nresponses, as shown in Figure 2. The goal posts were rendered with an XYZ Blender scale\nProcedure\nObservers were first presented with an animation of the target and context figure, or without\nthe context during baseline trials, moving across the display. Then, the target, and context if\napplicable, disappeared, and the display was rotated by changing the camera's perspective to\npresent the goal posts in frontal view; see Figure 2 for an example trial. Observers were\ninstructed to indicate via a mouse-click the location where they thought the target would\ncross the goal.\nFigure 2. Procedure for measuring the perceived trajectories of the target, for secondary sphere (a) and cast\nshadow (b) contexts. The white dashed lines show the trajectories (from left to right). Following the animation,\nthe target and context were removed and the display rotated (c) to present the skeleton goal posts fin planar\nview (d), at which point a cursor appeared. The observer's task was to indicate via mouse-click the location\nwhere they thought the target would cross the goal, termed the ``end-point'' of the perceived trajectory.\nObservers were presented with one of three possible target sphere start and end locations.\nThe start locations are described by the following XYZ Blender positions. See Figure 3 for an\nillustration of each of the possible starting locations.\nRegardless of the start or end location of the target sphere, its motion followed a linear\ntrajectory oriented at 4 from horizontal.\nEach target-sphere animation was accompanied by one of four context (secondary sphere or\ncast shadow) trajectories, as well as a no-context baseline trajectory. For all context trajectories,\nthe XY Blender start locations were identical to those of the target-sphere, with Z Blender space\nset to a value 0.41, and the context's X Blender location adjusted to be perceptually below the\ntarget. The following context trajectories, illustrated in Figure 3, were tested:\nFollow: The Y Blender position was the same as the top-sphere and followed the same linear\ntrajectory oriented 4 from horizontal.\nFigure 3. Starting locations and context trajectories. The figures on the left illustrate the three different\nstarting locations of the target and context figures. The trajectory of the target sphere is shown by the dashed\nline and is fixed for each starting location. The four trajectories of the context figure (here the sphere) are the\ncontinuous lines, and their names are shown on the right. The figures on the right show a bird's eye view of the\ntrajectories. Horizontally flipped versions of all trajectories were also employed but are not illustrated here.\nOuhnana and Kingdom 5\nIntermediate: A value of 2 units was subtracted from the Y Blender ending position of the\ntop-sphere. This motion trajectory followed a linear path orientated 2 from horizontal.\nHorizontal: A value of 4 units was subtracted from the Y Blender ending position of the top-\nsphere. This motion trajectory followed a horizontal path, that is, 0 from horizontal.\nDown: A value of 6 units was subtracted from the Y Blender ending position of the top-\nsphere. This motion trajectory followed a linear path oriented \u00ad2 from horizontal.\nHorizontally flipped versions of all conditions were also presented. All conditions,\nhorizontally flipped and nonflipped, were interleaved and tested 10 times.\nResults\nTo assess the influence of the context trajectories on the perceived trajectories of the target, end\npoint estimates were separated into depths (X) and heights (Y). To normalize the data across\nexperimental conditions, the observer's baseline depth and height estimate for each starting\nlocation and for both flipped and non-flipped animations was subtracted\nfrom the corresponding trajectory estimates. We term these measures shifts from baseline.\nThe normalized depth and height estimates were then averaged for each condition. The shifts\nfrom baseline averaged across all subjects' trial data are summarized in Figure 4 for both cast\nshadow and secondary sphere context conditions and for each context trajectory.\nTo analyze the influence of context on the perceived target trajectories, two separate two-\nfactor (Context\u00c2 Trajectory) within-subject ANOVAS (analyses of variance) were conducted,\none on the depth estimates the other on the height estimates. There was a significant main effect\nestimates, showing that the contexts had a significant impact on the perceived trajectories of the\ntarget. There was no significant difference between the two contexts (shadow and bottom-\nHowever, this lack of difference between the two contexts obscures differences in the pattern of\nperceived target trajectories, which can be seen in Figure 4 and is expressed in the significant\nthat the depth and height estimates of the target followed more closely the changes in trajectory\nfor the cast shadow compared with those of the secondary sphere contexts.\nTo investigate whether the shifts in target trajectory estimates occurred for both the cast\nshadow and secondary sphere contexts, a simple effects test was conducted between\ntrajectories for each context condition. The analysis revealed significant effects of context\ntrajectory for both context conditions (for the shadow condition, depth: F(3, 20) \u00bc 9.15,\nTo assess whether each change in context trajectory was accompanied by a change in\ntarget trajectory estimate, we conducted Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD)\npairwise comparison tests between the various pairs of trajectories. For the cast shadow\ncontext, Tukey's HSD test revealed that all trajectories had a significant differential\ninfluence on target estimates. In other words as the trajectory of the cast shadow deviated\naway from the target, there was an accompanying significant shift in depth estimates: all\np's < .01. This coherent relationship between cast shadow trajectory and target estimates was\nalso found for height (p's < .01), with the exception of the follow with intermediate trajectory\ncomparison (p \u00bc 1), and the horizontal with down trajectory comparison (p \u00bc .23). In the case\nof the secondary sphere context condition, Tukey's HSD test revealed a significant shift in\ndepth estimates between the horizontal and follow context trajectories (p < .05) as well as\nbetween the down and follow context trajectories (p < .05). All other secondary sphere\ntrajectory comparisons were not significantly different from each other, that is, produced\nsimilar shifts from baseline in both depth and height estimates.\nTo further illustrate the relationship between target end-point estimates and\ncontext, the Euclidean distances between target trajectory end-point estimates for each\nadjacent pair of context trajectories were calculated and are summarized in Figure 5. The\nfigure reveals consistent shifts in estimates for the cast shadow, while estimates for the\nsecondary sphere display asymptote beginning at the second context trajectory.\nDiscussion\nOur goal was to compare the influence of a secondary sphere and the cast shadow on the\nperceived motion trajectory of a target sphere. The main findings are as follows:\nFigure 4. Shift in end-point from baseline for the sphere and shadow contexts in terms of (a) depth and\n(b) height. The error bars correspond to 95% confidence intervals calculated across trials.\nOuhnana and Kingdom 7\n(1) The perceived motion trajectory of a moving target was found to be significantly\ninfluenced by the motion trajectory of both a cast shadow and secondary sphere context.\n(2) The perceived target motion trajectory diverged along with the divergence of the cast\nshadow motion trajectory, but reached a plateau in the secondary sphere condition at\ngreater motion trajectory divergences.\nOur data from the shadow conditions replicate the findings of Kersten et al. (1994) and\nadd the new finding that there is a similar influence of an identical object. The influence of the\nobject however is overall less than that of the shadow, in keeping with the results of Ni et al.\n(2004), who compared shadow and object influences on the perceived location of a stationary\nobject. The question however remains: Why does the secondary object have any influence at\nall, and why is the influence less than that of a shadow?\nOne idea suggested by an anonymous reviewer is motion repulsion. The angle between two\nsuperimposed dot patterns moving in different motion directions tends to be perceptually\noverestimated (Rauber & Treue, 1999), an example of a more general effect termed acute-\nangle expansion (e.g., Kitaoka & Ishihara, 2000). The largest overestimation occurs at a\nmotion angle of about 7, and diminishes in magnitude for both smaller and larger angles\n(Rauber & Treue, 1999). In our study, the trajectory angles ranged between 0 and 6.\nTherefore, there may have been a perceived overestimation in the trajectory divergences in\nour displays. However, the task for the subject was not to estimate the angular difference in\ntrajectory, but to estimate the height and depth of the perceived end-point of the target\ntrajectory. The effect of motion repulsion would, if anything, tend to shift the end-point of\nthe target away from the trajectory of the sphere, whereas our results showed the opposite.\nFigure 5. Euclidean distances between end-point estimates for adjacent pairs of context trajectories for\nboth secondary sphere and cast shadow contexts.\nThus, while we cannot rule out an influence of motion repulsion on our results, it seems\nhighly unlikely that it is their main cause.\nAnother possibility is that the context sphere, which is identical to the target sphere, is\nperceived as its mirror-reflection, as if the ground plane in the display acted like a mirror. The\nphysics of reflection is compatible with any of the trajectory combinations of perceived target\nmotion direction and context motion direction used in the study, though normally of course\nthe shading on the reflected sphere would be above the sphere, not below it as in our display.\nMirror-reflection is therefore a tantalizing possibility.\nThe Gestalt principle of common fate states that objects that appear to move together\ngroup together. The target and secondary sphere share a degree of common fate in that they\nexhibit similar motion speeds, not too dissimilar motion directions, and a common vertical\naxis in their 2D projections. Grouping might lead to the interpretation that the two objects\nare perceived to lie on the same, flat, rigid surface. For the conditions in our experiment, any\nsurface formed from such object grouping would be increasingly slanted away from the\nobserver as the trajectory of the secondary sphere diverged from that of the target toward\nthe observer. However, if there was a bias toward perceiving that surface as close to fronto-\nparallel, similar to the bias observed in the stereopsis domain (Deas & Wilcox, 2014; Fahle &\nWestheimer, 1988; Liu, David, & Ronen, 1999), then the target object would tend to appear\nto move upwards, as we found. This reduction in perceived surface slant would occur in\nconjunction with the trajectory of the secondary sphere, which would define the tilt of the\nsurface.\nAs to why the cast shadow exerts a bigger influence than the secondary object, the\nanswer probably lies in the fact that shadows are more constrained in the natural world\nthan other objects in terms of their physical relationships with the objects that cast them.\nKersten et al. (1994) suggest that the visual system assumes a stationary light source when\ndealing with shadows. Coupled with the fact that light is typically assumed to come from\nabove (Morgenstern, Murray, & Harris, 2011; Ramachandran, 1988) and that shadows\nare assumed to lie on the ground plane, this reduces significantly the possible\ninterpretations of the target-shadow trajectories in Kersten et al.'s (1994) and our\nmoving ball experiments.\nConclusion\nThe perceived motion direction of an object such as a sphere is influenced by the motion\ndirection of an identical object, not just a cast shadow. Future research will be needed to\ndetermine the underlying cause of this influence, exploring such possibilities as mirror-\nreflection and a bias towards motion surfaces being fronto-parallel. In conclusion, we have\ndemonstrated systematic shifts of end point estimates to trajectory divergences of a secondary\nobject.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: The study was funded by Canadian Institute of Health Research grant\nOuhnana and Kingdom 9\nReferences\nCasati, R.
