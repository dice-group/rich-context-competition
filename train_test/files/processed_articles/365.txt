Persons older than 60 years as well\nas African-American and Mexican-Americans were over-\nsampled to more precisely assess US health and nutri-\ntional measures. Importantly, NHANES III was the first\nNHANES survey without an upper age limit, thus\nimproving the estimates of health and nutrition in older\nsegments of the population. The survey design was\napproved by the National Center for Health Statistics\ninstitutional review board (IRB) and participants gave\nwritten informed consent prior to undergoing survey\nprocedures(5); the present analysis was thus deemed\nexempt from review by the Emory University IRB. The\ncombined phase analysis. Because homocysteine con-\ncentrations were measured only in Phase 2, the current\nanalysis focuses on data from non-pregnant adults (age\n1994) for whom supplement use information and\nlaboratory analyses of serum B12\nand homocysteine are\navailable (n 8394). Laboratory measurements, including\nand total serum homocysteine concentrations,\nwere collected and measured in accordance with\nNHANES III procedures(5\u00ad7).\nPer NHANES protocol, persons who were institutiona-\nlized, had haemophilia or had undergone chemotherapy\nfor cancer within the previous four weeks were excluded\nfrom phlebotomy and thus from the present analysis.\nconcentrations were analysed with a commer-\ncially available radioprotein binding assay kit (Quantaphase\nII from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA; during\nNHANES III, Phase 2). EDTA-treated plasma was not\navailable from NHANES III and serum homocysteine con-\ncentration was measured by HPLC with fluorometric\ndetection. Further survey procedure details, including\nhow demographic, medical history and medication and\nsupplement intakes were collected, may be found in the\nNHANES III plan and operation(5) and in the data doc-\numentation on the NHANES website (http://www.cdc.gov/\nnchs/nhanes.htm). In addition, pregnant females (n 167)\nand persons who reported taking antiretroviral prescription\nmedication for HIV (n 7) were excluded because B12\nnutriture is altered in these populations(8,9).\nAnalysis\nThere is no gold standard test or definition for B12\ndefi-\nciency. We used a conservative serum B12\ncut-off point of\nconcentra-\ntion. Subjects with serum B12\ndefined as biochemically defined B12\n-deficient.\nThe primary exposure variable of interest, B12\n-con-\ntaining supplement use, was ascertained by calculating\nthe total (single dose) supplemental B12\nintake among\nsupplement users from the NHANES III PUVITMIN and\nSUPLCONC data sets, which define supplement use in\nthis cohort. Supplement users were defined as having\nsupplement intake .0 mg. Supplement dose\ncategories were defined as: 0 mg (non-users), .0 to 6 mg\nwere chosen such that the lowest category of use inclu-\nded the dose found in many over-the-counter multi-\nvitamin supplements (6 mg). The second category of\nsupplement users includes the 25 mg amount found in\nmany senior daily multivitamin supplements, and the\n1000 mg) found in high-dose B-vitamin supplements.\nand/or homocysteine concentrations\nwhich could potentially confound the analysis include\nage, race, impaired renal function, smoking(11), heavy\nciency. Whites tend to have lower serum B12\nconcentrations\nthan blacks or Mexican-Americans(15) and Mexican-American\nHispanics tend to have lower homocysteine concentrations\nthan non-Hispanic whites or non-Hispanic blacks(16).\nExcept where noted, potential confounding exposure\nvariables were dichotomized for the univariate analysis\nand multivariate logistic regression modelling.\nAfter examining the distribution of cases within quar-\ntiles of age and ensuring adequate sample size, age was\nclassified as a dichotomous variable to match the age\nrecommendations discussed in the IOM report (18\u00ad50\nyears and .50 years)(1), and included as a continuous\nvariable in the logistic regression models. Those partici-\npants who reported being current smokers of cigarettes,\npipes or cigars were classified as current smokers. Study\nparticipants' average daily alcohol consumption was\nestimated from the NHANES survey alcohol consumption\nquestions (number of drinks on drinking days3number\nof days per year drinking/365). If the number of days per\nyear drinking was missing, the daily average was calcu-\nlated by multiplying the number of drinks on drinking\ndays by the number days per year with 91 drinks, and\nthen dividing by 365 days per year. Based on the US\nDepartment of Agriculture's dietary guidelines for alcohol\n(no more than one to two drinks of alcohol daily)(17,18)\nand the definition of heavy drinking given on the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) alcohol fact\nsheet, participants whose calculated average daily alcohol\nconsumption was three or more drinks were classified as\nDue to possible alteration in B12\nand/or homocysteine\nstatus in renal impairment, serum creatinine was included\nas a continuous variable in the multivariate analysis.\nParticipants with thyroid-stimulating hormone concentra-\ntion greater than 5 mIU/l were considered `hypothyroid'\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Folate is a\nmajor determinant of homocysteine concentrations(7,21,22),\nand folate deficiency was therefore defined as red blood cell\nparticipants, for whom RBC folate analysis was not done,\nIn all analyses, a 5 0?05 was considered significant and\n95 % confidence intervals are reported. To account for the\ncomplex survey design, SURVEY procedures in the SAS\nstatistical software package version 9?1 (SAS Institute Inc.,\nCary, NC, USA) were used to estimate the population\nprevalence and prevalence ratio estimates. To calculate\ncrude prevalence ratios, PROCSURVEY FREQ outcome\nprevalence estimates from the exposed (supplemented\nparticipants) are divided by the prevalence estimates in\nthe unexposed (non-supplemented participants).\nUnconditional logistic regression techniques were used to\nevaluate the univariate frequencies of each potential expo-\nsure variable and measures of association were computed,\nadjusting for supplement intake. Those exposures variables\nwhich were significantly related to the outcome variable\nwere then included in a multivariate logistic regression\nmodel. Exposure variables were then removed from the\nmodel by backwards elimination and those exposures\nwhich altered the prevalence odds ratio by more than 10%\nwere kept in the model. The prevalence of biochemical B12\ndeficiency in the NHANES sample meets the rare disease\nassumption, and adjusted prevalence ratios are approxi-\nmated from the multivariate logistic regression odds ratios\nusing the method described by Zhang and Yu(24).\nResults\nPrevalence of biochemical B12\ndeficiency\nApplying the above criteria yielded a crude sample size of\ndeficiency (Table 1). The overall\nestimated US adult population prevalence of biochemi-\ndeficiency was 1?6 %. The prevalence\naged .50 years.

For each demographic\nexposure category (old and young age categories, gender,\nwhite and black races, and all education levels) B12\nsupplement consumption was associated with reduced\nodds of biochemical B12\ndeficiency.\nAfter adjusting for survey design, 17?9 % of persons had\nelevated serum creatinine. However, the prevalence of\nconcentration and biochemically defined\ndeficiency in persons with and without elevated\ncreatinine (.1?1 mg/dl for females, .1?4 mg/dl for males)\nwas not significantly different (P 5 0?5 for low B12\nand\ndeficiency).\nSimilarly, the prevalence of low B12\nin participants aged\n.50 years with normal creatinine (4?1 %) was not sig-\nnificantly different from that in older participants with\nMultivariate logistic regression model analysis revealed\nthat hypothyroidism, heavy alcohol use and smoking\nstatus were not significant predictors of low serum B12\nor\ndeficiency. Although lower educational\nlevel showed a statistically significant association with\ndeficiency in the univariate analysis,\nremoving it from the model did not change the pre-\nvalence ratio estimates. Similarly, removing serum crea-\ntinine concentration from the multivariate model did not\naffect the point estimates or confidence intervals.\nDiscussion\nConsistent with our a priori hypothesis, we found that\nintake of supplements providing 6 or 25 mg of vitamin B12\nwas associated with reductions in the prevalence of bio-\ndeficiency and low serum B12\nconcentra-\ntions in US adults (aged both 18 years and older and\nabove 50 years). The majority of supplement users met or\nexceeded the IOM RDA of B12\nintake (2?4 mg) because the\nquantities commonly found in over-the-\ncounter multivitamin supplements range from 6 to 25 mg.\nAlthough we cannot conclude that there is a significant\nbenefit to consuming 6 mg v. 2?4 mg supplement, or 25 mg\nv. 6 mg supplement, our data suggest that the prevalence\ndeficiency (defined as low serum B12\nor bio-\nchemical deficiency) among persons aged .50 years\nsupplements is half to two-thirds the\nprevalence in persons who do not consume B12\nsupple-\nments; the difference between prevalence for supplement\nusers v. non-users in persons aged 18\u00ad50 years is about\na third. The prevalence reduction was even higher in\ndaily.\nAlthough there was overlap in the confidence intervals,\nthe trend we observed of decreasing prevalence of low\ndeficiency with increas-\nsupplement dose is consistent with results seen in\nvitamin supplement intervention trials in the elderly(25\u00ad28).\nindicate that daily doses of supplemental B12\nas low as 6mg\ncan shift the distribution of B12\nconcentrations upwards\nin the general population and reduce biochemical B12\ndeficiency prevalence.\nAbout 2 % of people aged .50 years will still have low\nconcentrations despite consuming 6\u00ad25 mg of syn-\n. Daily consumption of more than 75 mg B12\nmay\nnearly eliminate low B12\ndeficiency,\nbut more research is needed to determine how much\nsupplement is needed by those individuals for whom\nor biochemical\ndeficiency.\nGiven the success of a proof of concept study by\nWinkels et al.(29), our data suggest that a B12\nfortification\nprogramme that delivered 6 to 25 mg of synthetic vitamin\nto most of the population may be highly effective in\ndecreasing the prevalence of both low B12\nconcentrations\nand biochemically defined B12\ndeficiency. Were such a\nprogramme implemented, there would be fewer patients\nand biochemically defined B12\ndeficiency for clinicians to investigate. Several studies\nhave reported that adults with suboptimal B12\nstatus\nhave poorer cognitive functioning or could improve\nwith supplementation(30\u00ad32). However, results from other\nB-vitamin supplement trials have failed to yield clinically\nmeasurable benefit(33,34). Further investigations are\nrequired to determine whether improving B12\nstatus with\nfortification would result in improved functional status or\nclinical benefit.\nThe prevalence of low B12\nin NHANES III (3?2 %) was\nsimilar to that previously observed in NHANES III (3 %)(7),\nbut was lower than that observed in other cohort studies\nfocused on racially homogeneous, elderly cohorts rather\nthan the entire adult population, and they had relatively\nsmall sample sizes. Increased age and white race have\nboth been associated with lower B12\nand estimates from predominantly older, white cohorts\nmay therefore overestimate the national prevalence of B12\ndeficiency. The higher cut-off points for defining low B12\nadult populations(2,3,35) and two outpatient source\npopulations(35,36) may also explain the lower prevalence\ndeficiency in our study population. Overall, our\nstudy supports the results of previous studies, but widens\ntheir generalizability for the US population.\nWe did not examine the limited physical examination\ndata in NHANES III addressing whether persons with\nbiochemically determined B12\ndeficiency exhibited clinical\ndeficiency. Although 6 to 25mg of supplemental\nsupplement use and biochemical deficiency in NHANES III 29\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

We remind\nclinicians that patients with clinical symptoms consistent\ndeficiency disease should be worked up\nand treated with an appropriate dose of vitamin B12\n.\nThe primary strength of our analysis is that it examines\na nationally representative population sample of ambu-\nlatory persons in the USA. With the largest sample size\nreported to date (over 8000 participants), we were able to\nadjust prevalence ratio estimates for the most common\npotential confounding exposures, including age, race,\neducational level, renal insufficiency and folate status.\nA potential weakness of our study is the absence of\nMMA data to use as a criterion for biochemical determi-\ndeficiency. An elevated MMA concentration\nis typically considered a more specific confirmatory\ndeficiency than elevated homocysteine.\nBecause NHANES III MMA data are not publicly available,\nwe chose a homocysteine cut-off that is within the range\n- and folate-replete individuals(23,37).\nAnother potential weakness of our study is the incom-\nplete exclusion of HIV-positive individuals(38). Given that\nconcentrations are reportedly less likely in HIV\nafter antiretroviral therapy is started(8), those excluded\nwere least likely to be cases. HIV patients use supple-\nments at a higher rate (over 70 %) than the general\npopulation and the participants not excluded would\nlikely increase the number of exposed controls, poten-\ntially resulting in bias towards the null. However, at the\nestimated prevalence of HIV of 0?34 %(38), unidentified\nHIV-positive individuals would have virtually no impact\non the prevalence of B12\ndeficiency and prevalence ratio\nestimates in our data.\nIn conclusion, consumption of supplements with 6 or\nwas associated with about a 50 %\nreduction in the prevalence of low B12\nconcentrations and\nbiochemically defined B12\ndeficiency. These findings\nsuggest that approximately three million cases of low\ndeficiency in the US\npopulation may be prevented if all adults consumed\n/d from supplements or fortified foods. We\nalso found low vitamin B12\nconcentrations and bio-\nchemically defined vitamin B12\ndeficiency in 1\u00ad2 % of\npersons aged .50 years who were consuming 6 to 25 mg\nfrom supplements. This relatively high prevalence\nin older supplement users suggests that the current RDA\nof 2?4 mg/d may be too low for this age group. As Berry et\nal. noted, people who have low serum concentrations of\nmay have problems in absorbing free B12\nthe preclinical pernicious anaemia that Carmel et al. have\nidentified among those over 50 years of age(10). Clinicians\nshould be vigilant for subtle signs and symptoms of\npernicious anaemia and clinical vitamin B12\ndeficiency,\nparticularly in older adults who have low concentration of\nand/or biochemically defined vitamin B12\ndeficiency in spite of consuming vitamin B12\nsupple-\nments, and manage these patients appropriately.\n"
