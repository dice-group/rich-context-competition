Most lung malignancies\ncan be confidently diagnosed with accurate\nhistopathological identification.2\nIntrathoracic lesions are common and\noften difficult to diagnose. Many diagnostic\ntechniques are used for pulmonary and\nmediastinal lesions, including washing and\nbrushing cytology, transbronchial biopsy,\ntransthoracic biopsy, thoracoscopy, medias-\ntinoscopy, and thoracotomy. Although\nmany of these techniques are invasive, they\nremain necessary to achieve an accurate\nhistopathological diagnosis.3,4 Of these\ndiagnostic techniques, percutaneous trans-\nthoracic biopsy is performed using either\ncutting needle biopsy (CNB) or fine needle\naspiration biopsy (FNAB).5\nFNAB is used for cytological examin-\nation of aspirated material. CNB is used to\nobtain tissue fragments from the lesion for\nhistopathological diagnosis.4 Because a\npiece of tissue is taken via a cutting needle,\nthis method is especially useful for diagnosis\nof suspicious malignant or benign and\nlymphoproliferative diseases. Additionally,\nit is generally more accurate than aspiration.\nThis technique is frequently used for chest\nwall lesions or peripheral lesions that do not\nrequire parenchymal passage.6 The diagnos-\ntic value of percutaneous transthoracic\nneedle biopsy (TTNB) for malignant dis-\nsensitivity is excellent.7\nHistorically, radiologists developed\nlesion biopsy techniques using guidance\nwith fluoroscopy, ultrasonography, and\ncomputed tomography (CT), contributing\nto optimal surgical and medical manage-\nment.7 Using CT-guided TTNB, lesions in\nthe lung parenchyma and mediastinum that\nare not reachable by bronchoscopy can be\ndistinguished, and a specific diagnosis can be\nmade with high accuracy. Thus, unnecessary\nperformance of thoracotomy to obtain a\nhistological diagnosis can be avoided.6 CT-\nguided TTNB allows the practitioner to\nsafely avoid vascular and cardiac structures\nwhen sampling almost all lesions. CT-guided\nTTNB is an easy technique that induces less\ntrauma than thoracotomic biopsy tech-\nniques.8 The complication and diagnostic\nrates of CT-guided TTNB are affected by\nmany factors, including the needle depth,\nneedle size, and distance from the lesion to\nthe pleura.9\nThe purpose of this study was to investi-\ngate the technique, suitability, and factors\ninfluencing the diagnostic and complication\nrates of CT-guided TTNB of lung masses.\nMaterials and methods\nIn this retrospective study, we assessed\n65 patients who underwent CT-guided lung\nbiopsy using a fine needle and a cutting needle.\nThe diagnostic studies were performed dur-\ning a 4-year period in the Department of\nRadiology, Ankara Numune Training and\nResearch Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. This\nstudy was approved by the ethics committee\nof the same institute. Written informed con-\nsent was obtained from all patients.\nPatients who were suspected to have\nmalignant lesions on CT images and chest\nradiographs that were unspecified by other\nmethods were evaluated. TTNB was per-\nformed under CT guidance. We used a CT\nScanner (Hitachi Radix Turbo Model;\nHitachi Medical, Tokyo, Japan) to guide\nthe needle and locate the lesion.\nPatients with significant coagulopathy,\ncontralateral pneumonectomy, bullous dis-\nease adjacent to the suspicious lesion, pul-\nmonary arterial hypertension, and advanced\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease were\nexcluded from the study.\nThe CT images were evaluated before the\nprocedure, and the patient was positioned\nGo\n\u00a8rgu\n\u00a8lu\nbased on these images to provide the safest\ndistance from the skin surface to the lesion.\nEach patient was informed about the pro-\ncedure and was asked to maintain the initial\nposition during the procedure. A metal\nmarker was then used to indicate the esti-\nmated lesion area according to the scanned\nimages, and this area was rescanned using a\n5-mm slice thickness for confirmation. The\ndepth of the lesion and the angle of needle\nentrance were calculated. The selected sec-\ntion was marked on the patient. The upper\nside of the costal margin was used for needle\nentrance to protect the neural and arterial\nstructures. The skin was cleaned, and sub-\ncutaneous and intradermal anesthesia was\nperformed with 2% prilocaine (Citanest;\nDentsply, York, PA). We used 20-cm-long,\n22-gauge Franseen lung biopsy needles\n(Cook Medical, Inc., Bloomington, IN) for\nthe aspiration biopsies and 15-cm-long, 18-\ngauge Franseen biopsy needles (Cook\nMedical, Inc.) for the cutting biopsies. The\npatient was told to hold his or her breath, and\nthe needle was lowered to the specified depth\nafter ensuring that no deviations due to\npatient motion had taken place. The patient\nwas then told to take superficial breaths, and\nseveral control scans were taken from that\narea. After ensuring that the needle tip was in\nthe lesion, the mandrel of the needle was\nremoved. The needle was wiggled within the\nlesion to free it, and aspiration was then\nperformed. When we judged that enough\nmaterial had been obtained, the needle and\ninjector were withdrawn. Both hands were\nused for this procedure to terminate the\nnegative pressure. The puncture site was\ncovered with sterile gauze. The aspirate of\nFNAB was sprayed to lam, and the tissue\nspecimen of CNB was placed into 10%\nformalin solution and sent out for pathologi-\ncal examination. A single entry was per-\nformed to reduce the complication rate.\nUpon completion of the biopsy, the\npatient was examined by CT for rule out\npneumothorax and hemorrhage. The patient\nwas then sent to the clinics for further\nfollow-up.\nHistopathologic results from all biopsies\nwere classified as (1) malignant with subtype\ndetermination, (2) malignant without sub-\ntype determination, (3) specified benign, (4)\nnonspecified benign, and (5) nondiagnostic\n(Table 1).\nStatistical analysis\nDemographic characteristics, history, histo-\npathologic diagnoses, complication rates,\nand radiologic data were recorded for all\npatients.

A P value of < 0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant.\nResults\nIn total, 49 lesions in 65 patients underwent\nCT-guided transthoracic FNAB, and the\nremaining 16 lesions underwent CT-guided\ntransthoracic CNB.

Many methods have been\ndescribed for diagnostic sampling of\nintrathoracic lesions.9,10 Of these, the sensi-\ntivity of bronchoscopy and transbronchial\nbiopsy are high for endobronchial lesions\nand low for peripheral lung lesions. For\npulmonary nodules, CT-guided needle\nbiopsy is an effective technique with which\nto confirm the pathological diagnosis.

CT-guided transthoracic FNAB was\napplied to 61 cases with a <1-cm lesion on\nCT. The diagnostic rate was 77% (52% for\nmalignant lesions and 25% for benign\nlesions).

The\nhistologic distribution of lung cancers has\nchanged throughout the years. In past dec-\nades, epidermoid carcinoma constituted 50%\nof lung cancers, and this rate is now lower.\nConversely, the proportion of adenocarcin-\nomas has increased, whereas that of small cell\ncancers has decreased.4 In the present study,\nthe most common specific histologic subtype\nwas adenocarcinoma and the least common\nwas lymphoma.

Pneumothorax was the most\ncommon complication, but the rate of this\ncomplication (15.4%) is within the accept-\nable level and is even low according to the\nrange reported in the literature (9.0%\u00ad\nbiopsy-associated pneumothorax is whether\nit is pleural or non-pleural. Aribas\u00b8 et al.21\nfound that the lesion depth was a poor\npredictor of pneumothorax. Accordingly, in\nprevious series of CT-guided biopsy in the\nliterature, pleural lesions were associated\nwith a very low incidence of pneumothorax;\nas soon as the aerated lung was traversed,\nthe risk rose considerably. However,\nthe exact depth of the lesion was not a\nsignificant factor. In the present study,\nwe found that the depth of the lesion,\nrather than whether the lesion was pleural\nor non-pleural, was a significant risk factor\nfor complications.\nThe next most common complication\nwas minor intraparenchymal hemorrhage\n(6.2%). None of the patients required\nchest tube insertion. No hemoptysis or\nhemothorax occurred. The low rate of\npneumothorax in the present study might\nhave been related to the single entry, the\nchoice of different types of needles according\nto the size and location of the lesion, and the\nfact that the patients held their breath and\navoided coughing. All patients underwent\nnon-contrast CT scans immediately after the\nneedle was removed, followed by a chest\nX-ray 3 hours later. If air was seen in the\npleural space, pneumothorax was diag-\nnosed. Some authors have reported lower\ncomplication rates in association with CNB\nand higher complication rates in association\nwith FNAB, while others have reported the\nreverse situation.17 Topal and Berkman18\nfound that the rate of pneumothorax was\nnot affected by the needle size in their\nretrospective study of 284 cases. Anderson\net al.9 reported a 15.9% rate of pneumo-\nthorax when performing CNB and 35.1%\nwhen performing FNAB. However, some\nstudies have revealed higher rates of\npneumothorax with larger needle diam-\nlung biopsy needles for the FNAB and 18-\ngauge, 15-cm Franseen biopsy needles for\nthe CNB. A statistically significant relation-\nship was found between the needle size and\ncomplication rate. The distance from the\nlesion to the pleura was not significantly\nassociated with the complication rate.\nThe following four factors also had no\nsignificant effect on the diagnostic rate:\nneedle size, lesion size, distance from lesion\nto pleura, and needle path length. There is a\nconsensus in the literature regarding the use\nof 18-gauge cutting needles for outlying\nlesions and 20-gauge needles for deeper\nOverall, the diagnostic yield in our study\nwas 90.8%. The diagnostic and complication\nrates were found to be consistent with the\nGo\n\u00a8rgu\n\u00a8lu\nresults reported in the literature. Limitations\nof this study include the retrospective study\ndesign, low number of patients, and low\nnumber of evaluated parameters. It is evident\nthat CT-guided TTNB is a reliable method\nwith a low complication rate and high diag-\nnostic rate for lesions that cannot be diag-\nnosed by clinical and radiologic methods.\nCT-guided TTNB is also highly sensitive for\ndifferentiation between malignant and benign\nlung masses, and it reduces the need for more\ninvasive procedures. We believe that its\naccuracy will further increase for early thor-\nacic lesions because of continued advances in\nCT technology and increased experience of\nradiologists and cytopathologists.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
