Approaches for deriving neural cells from mouse ES\n(embryonic stem) cells are also applicable to human\nprogenitor cells, and it appears that current tissue culture\nmethods can be readily perfected to allow the isolation of\nhighly purified preparations of the major neural cell types.\nStem cells are also advantageous for implantation research\nbecause they can be used for the preparation of genetically\nengineered cell lines, for which transfection protocols have\nrecently been optimized (Braam et al., 2008).\nBecause morphogenic signals co-ordinate major stem cell\ndecisions to regulate the size, shape and cellular diversity in\nnervous tissue development (Panchision and McKay, 2002;\nthat the cellular and biochemical environment into which\nsuch cells are introduced will play a critical role in deter-\nmining their survival, migration patterns and expression of\n1 To whom correspondence should be addressed (email richard.margolis@nyumc.org).\nAbbreviations: CNS, central nervous system; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ES cell, embryonic stem cell; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; LIF, leukaemia\ninhibitory factor; RPTP, receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase; RT\u00adPCR, reverse transcription\u00adPCR.\nE 2010 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\ndifferentiated functions. Proteoglycans and their extracellular\nmatrix ligands (for reviews, see Sugahara and Mikami, 2007;\nZimmermann and Dours-Zimmermann, 2008) are likely to\nexert a decisive influence on stem cell behaviour. These\nmacromolecules would be derived both from the implanted\ncells themselves and from the recipient tissue, possibly\nresulting in reciprocal effects.\nGlypican-1 is largely present as a glycosylphosphatidyl-\ninositol-anchored cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan.\nHowever, we have previously demonstrated that it contains a\nnuclear localization signal, is present in the nuclei of CNS\nneurons and is transported to the nuclei of 293, COS-1, and C6\nglioma cells, which show changes in the pattern of glypican\nnuclear immunoreactivity both during cell division and\ncorrelated with different phases of the cell cycle (Liang et al.,\n1997). These findings suggest that glypican-1 may be involved\nin the regulation of cell division and survival by directly\nparticipating in nuclear processes, possibly by facilitating the\ntransport of growth factors into the nucleus. Recent studies\nhave also shown that glypican-1 regulates anaphase-promot-\ning complex/cyclosome substrates and cell-cycle progression in\nbrain endothelial cells (Qiao et al., 2008), and that glypicans\nplay an essential role in the regulation of morphogen signalling\n(e.g. by promoting internalization of Hedgehog; Beckett et al.,\nPhosphacan is an mRNA splice variant representing the\nentire extracellular portion of a transmembrane chondroitin\nsulfate proteoglycan, RPTP (receptor protein-tyrosine phos-\nphatase)-f/b, which is a high-affinity ligand of a number of\nneural cell-adhesion molecules and of the extracellular matrix\nprotein tenascin-C (reviewed in Margolis and Margolis, 1997).\nAlthough hyaluronan, the hyaluronan-binding chondroitin\nsulfate proteoglycans and phosphacan are present in some or\nthe dense extracellular matrix structures that develop around\nmany neuronal cell bodies late in development and are thought\nto be involved in restricting experience-dependent synaptic\nplasticity in the adult, phosphacan has also been detected very\nearly in CNS development at extrasynaptic sites prior to\nTenascin-C was the first identified member of a highly\nconserved family of four large multimodular extracellular matrix\nglycoproteins found only in vertebrate organisms (for reviews, see\nHsia and Schwarzbauer, 2005; Tucker and Chiquet-Ehrismann,\n2009). They have distinctive expression patterns (only tenascin-C\nand tenascin-R are present in nervous tissue) and all of the\ntenascins share the characteristics of having tightly regulated\nexpression both during development and throughout the life of\nan organism, and of modulating cell\u00admatrix interactions and\nmediating cell adhesion in a manner that promotes cell motility.\nWe have previously demonstrat-\ned that the fibrinogen-like globe of tenascin-C mediates its high-\naffinity interactions with the core proteins of two chondroitin\nsulfate proteoglycans that are characteristic of nervous tissue\n(neurocan and phosphacan/RPTP-f/b) and have potent effects on\nneural cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth (Milev et al., 1997).\nBecause proteoglycans and their cell surface or extracellular\nmatrix ligands can be expected to have major effects on stem cell\nbehaviour, we have examined the expression of glypican-1,\nphosphacan/RPTP-f/b and tenascin-C by neural stem cells and\ndifferentiated neurons and glia derived from them.\nEXPERIMENTAL\nAntibodies\nRabbit antisera to phosphacan (Milev et al., 1994) and\nglypican-1 (Liang et al., 1997) have been described previously.\nAnti-tenascin-C, prepared by immunizing rabbits with\ntenascin-C purified from the U-251 MG human glioma cell\nline (Bourdon et al., 1985), was generously provided by Dr\nMario Bourdon (La Jolla Institute for Molecular Medicine).\nThe antisera had been adsorbed against serum proteins,\nfibronectin and laminin and found to be tenascin-C specific\non ELISA and in immunoblots of total proteins from 1-day\npostnatal, 15-day and adult rat brain.\nAntibodies to mouse GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein;\ncyte marker (MAB345) were all obtained from Chemicon\n(Temecula, CA, U.S.A.).

(1998), but using the slightly simplified\nEMFI medium described above. ES cells were detached by\nmild trypsinization in EMFI medium and placed in suspension\nfresh EMFI medium after gravity sedimentation (10 min in\n15 ml conical tubes) and replated in the same dish. Two days\nlater they were transferred by sedimentation to EMFI medium\ncontaining 0.6 mM all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma; R2625), and\nthe medium was changed after a further 2 days. (During the\n4-day period when cells were cultured in suspension with\nretinoic acid, the second day is referred to as day 2+ and the\nfourth and final day of the retinoic acid treatment as day 4+.)\nAt days 2+ and 4+, and 9 days after beginning the retinoic acid\ninduction, cells were seeded on to glass coverslips coated with\nwell). Differentiated cells were maintained for up to 2 weeks\nfor immunocytochemistry.\nImmunocytochemistry\nSemi-quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy was\nemployed to evaluate proteoglycan expression, due to its\ngreater resolution (at essentially the single cell level) compared\nwith biochemical procedures based on total cell protein, and in\nview of substantial technical obstacles to accurate quantifica-\ntion of large proteoglycan core proteins by techniques such\nas immunoblotting. Cells on coverslips were washed with PBS\nand fixed for 30 min at room temperature (25\u00b0C) with 3% (w/v)\nparaformaldehyde. After washing for 365 min with PBS,\ncells were treated for 1 h at room temperature with 5% BSA in\nPBS, and for immunocytochemical detection of intracellular\nmarkers (e.g. tubulin and GFAP) cells were permeabilized by\ninclusion of 0.2% Triton X-100 in the BSA blocking solution.\nCells were treated overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humidified chamber\nwith primary antibodies in BSA blocking solution, washed for\n365 min with PBS and treated for 1 h at room temperature\n(25\u00b0C) with FITC- or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibod-\nies in blocking solution. After 365 min washes with PBS,\nnuclei were stained by treatment for 30 min at room\ntemperature with TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen,\n1 mg/ml in PBS), washed for 365 min with PBS and the\ncoverslips were mounted on slides using Vectashield (Vector\nLaboratories, Burlingame, CA, U.S.A.). Confocal imaging was\nperformed using a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope with a Plan-\nNeofluar 640 oil immersion objective.\nRESULTS\nStudies were performed using both the W4/129S6 cell line\nand a mouse ES cell line (E14Tg2a.4) that does not require a\nfeeder layer. Examination of proteoglycan and tenascin-C\nexpressions gave identical results in both the cases (e.g. most\nresults were obtained with the W4 cells, but those shown in\nFigures 1 and 3(D)\u00ad3(F) were obtained with the feeder-\nindependent E14T cell line).\nGlypican-1, phosphacan/RPTP-f/b and tenascin-C were\nweakly expressed in the SSEA-positive, nestin-negative ES\ncells (Figures 1A, 1D and 1G), and on the second day of\nretinoic acid treatment, SSEA-1 staining decreased and nestin\nstaining first appears (Figure 1L), but neither tubulin nor\nGFAP is detectable. Proteoglycan and tenascin-C staining\n(Figures 1B, 1E and 1H) has, however, increased in intensity as\ncompared with the ES cells. On day 4 of the retinoic acid\ntreatment, only a small proportion of cells still show SSEA-1\nstaining, whereas almost all are strongly nestin positive\n(Figure 1M). There is also significant proteoglycan and\ntenascin-C expression in these neural stem cells (Figures 1C,\n1F and 1J), as well as the first appearance of b-tubulin,\nalthough GFAP is still absent (Figure 1C). By 1 day after\nreplating (`differentiated day 1' after the retinoic acid neural\ninduction) most cells are strongly nestin-positive and there is\nsimilarly strong staining of b-tubulin, whereas significant\nstaining of GFAP did not usually appear until day 4 of\ndifferentiation (the next time point examined), at which time\nnestin has greatly decreased. The neural induction protocol\nused in the present study yielded only a very small proportion\nof oligodendrocytes expressing the O4 marker.

However, expression of tenascin-C\nappeared to be greatest early after differentiation.\nDISCUSSION\nMost previous studies of glycoconjugates in neural stem/\nprogenitor cells have concerned glycolipids and glycopro-\nteins, with relatively little information being available on\nproteoglycans and associated extracellular matrix molecules\n(reviewed by Yanagisawa and Yu, 2007). However, microarray\nstudies comparing acutely isolated human brain A2B5+ pro-\ngenitor cells with an unsorted white matter dissociate from\nwhich they were obtained demonstrated a 5\u00ad10-fold greater\nexpression of the gene for phosphacan/RPTP-f/b in the pro-\ngenitor cells (Sim et al., 2006). In other studies based on SDS/\nPAGE and immunoblotting, mouse neural precursor cells grown\nas neurospheres have been reported to secrete phosphacan and\naggrecan into the medium, and genes for aggrecan, neurocan,\nbrevican, phosphacan and tenascin-C could be amplified from\nmouse neurospheres by RT\u00adPCR (reverse transcription\u00adPCR;\nKabos et al., 2004). Immunocytochemical studies also indicated\nthat chondroitin sulfate surrounded nestin-positive cells or\nneural stem/progenitor cells in the rat ventricular zone of the\ntelencephalon at embryonic day 14, and the chondroitin sulfate\nproteoglycans neurocan, phosphacan/RPTP-f/b and neurogly-\ncan C, were detected in the ventricular zone (Ida et al., 2006).\nFigure 2 Expression of glypican-1 by neural cells derived from ES cells\nDays after differentiation are indicated on the left, and astrocytes and neurons are identified by their expression of GFAP and b-III\ntubulin.

However,\nall of these studies have concerned neurosphere-forming stem\nand progenitor cells isolated from fetal tissue, which are known\nto differ in many significant respects from neural stem cells\nderived from ES cells (Shin et al., 2007). These latter cells, which\nare derived from the inner cell mass of preimplantation mam-\nmalian embryos, are a unique population of pluripotent cells\nthat can differentiate into the embryonic precursors of all adult\ntissues. Moreover, most of these studies examined only gene\nexpression, which may not reflect the actual expression of the\ncorresponding protein(s).\nThe glycosaminoglycan chains of cell-surface heparan\nsulfate proteoglycans are ubiquitous elements of the stem\ncell `niche' (i.e. the histologically defined microenvironment\nfor stem cell regulation), and there is evidence that they play\nan important role in regulating extrinsic signalling pathways\nrequired for ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency (Nurcombe\nin glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis and fine structure occur as\nmurine ES cells differentiate to embryoid bodies and\nextraembryonic endoderm (Nairn et al., 2007) or to neural\nprogenitor cells (Johnson et al., 2007), early developmental\nalterations in, for example, glypican-1 heparan sulfate fine\nstructure, may modulate growth-factor binding, and thereby\naffect morphogenetic signalling processes critical for neural\nstem cell proliferation and differentiation.\nMajor ligands of glypican-1 in the CNS are the Slit pro-\nteins, which regulate axonal guidance, branching, dendritic\ndevelopment and neural migration, and with which glypican-\nIn addition to earlier evidence for the role of cell-surface\nheparan sulfate in the repulsive guidance activities of Slit-2\nprotein, it is known that both Slit-2 and glypican-1 mRNAs are\nstrongly up-regulated and co-expressed in the reactive astro-\ncytes of injured adult brain, suggesting a possible function of\nFigure 3 Expression of phosphacan/RPTP-f/b by neural cells derived from ES cells\nDays after differentiation are indicated on the left, and astrocytes and neurons are identified by their expression of GFAP and b-III\ntubulin.

It is therefore possible that\nglypican-1 and Slit proteins, either acting alone or as a complex,\nare a significant factor in inhibiting axonal regeneration after\ncondition for which there has been much interest in the possible\ntherapeutic use of ES cells.\nStudies of neural stem cells in the subependymal zone of\nadult mouse brain have shown that the neural stem cell niche\nfunctions properly in the absence of tenascin-C, suggesting\nthat this major extracellular matrix protein does not play a\nsignificant role in adult neurogenesis (Kazanis et al., 2007).\nHowever, recent induction gene trap studies of tenascin-C\nin neural stem cells indicate that its functions may be\ninstructive rather than permissive or redundant, and that its\nabsence leads to only marginal defects that the stem cell\nniche can compensate for as a functional, integrative entity\n(von Holst, 2008). Of the 64 theoretically possible tenascin-C\nisoforms that could be generated by alternative splicing, 20\nhave been described in neural stem cells maintained as\nneurospheres, where their expression is differentially regu-\nlated by Pax6 (von Holst et al., 2007). Although the functional\nsignificance of these various alternatively spliced tenascin-C\ndomains is not yet clear, they may contribute to the for-\nmation of slightly different microenvironments within the\nneural stem cell niche (von Holst, 2008). It is also of interest\nthat the transcript level of tenascin-C increased ,100-fold\nafter the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of ES cells to\nextra-embryonic endoderm (Nairn et al., 2007).\nIn the work reported here, we have demonstrated that ES\ncells differentiated to neural stem cells and then along\nneuronal and astroglial pathways produce chondroitin sulfate\nand heparan sulfate proteoglycans, as well as tenascin-C,\na high-affinity extracellular matrix ligand of phosphacan.

Consistent with our\nresults, RT\u00adPCR detected expression of proteoglycan core\nproteins in both undifferentiated cells and in those expressing\nSox1 (the earliest known specific marker of neuroectodermal\nprecursors, before their differentiation into neurons and glia).\nTherefore even proteoglycans such as phosphacan that are\nconsidered as characteristic of nervous tissue are expressed at\nvery early developmental stages. It should also be noted in\nthis connection that the transcript abundance of phospha-\ncan/RPTP-f/b increased ,10-fold after the differentiation of\nES cells to embryoid bodies, but was essentially absent when\nthe stem cells were differentiated to extra-embryonic\nendoderm (Nairn et al., 2007). Moreover, recent studies have\nrevealed a novel mechanism of axonal degeneration after\nspinal cord injury, involving protein tyrosine phosphatases\nthat can be targeted with small molecule inhibitors that exert\na neuroprotective effect (Nakashima et al., 2008). These\nresults suggest that phosphacan/RPTP-f/b expressed by\nneural stem cells and neural cells derived from them may\nbe significant in relation to the potential use of implanted\nneural stem cells for the treatment of spinal cord injury. It\ncan be expected that future studies will clarify the specific\nneurodevelopmental roles of these proteoglycans and their\nassociated ligands in stem cell populations, and how these\ninteractions can be used to advantage in the therapeutic\napplication of neural stem cells for the treatment of injury,\ndegeneration and aging in the CNS.\n"
