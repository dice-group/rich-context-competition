    "abstract": "Abstract: To better understand substance use disorder treatment needs of pregnant and parenting women who use methamphetamine (MA),\nthis paper describes pregnancy histories and fetal losses for women who were treated for MA use (N = 153) with reference to a national sample, and\ndescribes their drug use, sexual risk behaviors, and mental health status. MA users reported an average of 4.6 total pregnancies and 2.1 fetal losses,\nwhereas women in a general population survey reported 3.2 and 1.2, respectively. Higher numbers of pregnancies and fetal losses were correlated with\nspecific substance abuse and mental health problems including early sexual abuse and cognitive problems. The combination of MA users' especially high\nnumbers of pregnancies, fetal losses, and rates of risk behaviors suggest high social and health care costs for this population. Prenatal care may provide\na vector through which women can be connected to risk reduction interventions and gender-responsive treatment services addressing substance use and\nmental health needs.\n",

A study of illicit drug use over-\nall found drug use among women escalates more rapidly to\naddiction than does drug use among men, and women are at\ngreater risk for relapse than men.4 Specific to MA, women\nmay be at risk for more severe MA dependence compared to\nmen, as indicated in a study by Maxwell2 that showed women\nbecame dependent on MA sooner than men, initiated MA\nuse to attempt to alleviate depression, and had higher rates of\nchildhood sexual abuse than men. Rawson et al5 found that\nyoung women reported more MA use, became dependent on\nMA within a shorter period of time, and suffered more adverse\neffects than did young men; in addition, after controlling for\nage and race, more women than men were dependent on MA\nand identified MA as their primary drug of choice.\nMoreover, recent research indicates MA use is associ-\nated with fetal problems and poorer birth and childhood\noutcomes; for example, findings from the IDEAL study\nshow prenatal exposure to MA was associated with increased\nphysiological stress, lower arousal, and childhood neurobe-\nhavioral disinhibition.6,7 However, little has been published\nabout female MA users' reproductive histories and related\ncontext. This study contributes to the needed knowledge base\nby describing self-reported numbers of pregnancies and fetal\nlosses among MA-using women, and compares this sample\nof women with national statistics. In addition, we examine\nthe association of reproductive history with drug use severity\nPregnancy and Fetal Loss Reported by Methamphetamine-Using Women\nMary-Lynn Brecht1,2 and Diane M.

Our findings provide information on the health\nand treatment needs of MA-using pregnant and parenting\nwomen, and help define the magnitude of potential health and\nchild welfare problems related to MA use. Results may inform\nthe development and refinement of gender-sensitive treatment\nprograms that provide services to MA-using women and their\nchildren.\nMA is now labeled a principal drug threat because of\nepidemic increases in its use8; after a short period of decline\nStates.9,10 Although MA use had long been considered a\nregional (West Coast) phenomenon in the US, with dramatic\nincreases in that region in the mid-1990s, its use has contin-\nued to spread to other areas of the country, including rural,\nurban, and suburban sections of the South and Midwest.11,12\nAnalysis of the treatment episode data set (TEDS) confirms\nthis geographical pattern, and indicates that a shift in use\nfrom an initial concentration of predominantly white women\nto an increasing proportion of Hispanic women has been\nobserved.13 These data show MA treatment admissions for\ning the authors to conclude that MA is the primary substance\nof abuse for which pregnant women seek care. Worldwide, as\nmany as 56 million individuals globally are estimated to be\nusers of amphetamine-type substances,14 ranking this group\nof drugs (of which MA is the primary example) as second in\nworldwide illicit drug use. Its use has been documented in\n110 countries, with greater prevalence in East and South East\nAsia, North America, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia,\nand several European countries15; MA has been identified as\nthe primary illicit drug threat in Asia.16\nOwing to MA-related behaviors such as initiation of use\nduring adolescence, increased sexuality, and injection use,\nMA users are at increased risk for HIV, hepatitis, risky sexual\nbehaviors, teenage pregnancy, and potentially high rates of\npregnancy.17\u00ad21 Pregnant women dependent on MA are at risk\nfor multiple complications including preterm delivery, cesar-\nean delivery, and neonatal mortality.22 Beyond the potential\nfor contributing to negative fetal and birth outcomes, MA use\nby women also contributes to high-risk environments for their\nSelf-report data from a larger study of the natural his-\ntory and outcomes of treatment for MA use allow descrip-\ntion of reproductive history, including pregnancy incidence\nand fetal loss, reported by a diverse sample of women with a\nhistory of MA use and treatment. This paper also compares\nlifetime pregnancy rates reported by these women across eth-\nnic groups and to national rates. To provide some context for\nthese figures, we also describe their sexual risk behaviors,\ndrug use history, mental health status, and the extent to which\npregnancy is reported as a reason for changing MA use or\nfor entering treatment. The aggregate picture of reproductive\nhistory and its context in this MA-using sample is compelling\nin its illustration of high risk and potential social cost.\nMethods\nSample. Data are from the 153 female participants in a\nstudy of the natural history of MA use and substance use dis-\norder (SUD) treatment outcomes. Interviews were conducted\nin publicly funded Los Angeles County treatment programs.\nThe parent study selected a stratified (by gender, ethnicity,\nand type of treatment [residential or outpatient]) random\nsample of MA-related admission records in the California\nstate SUD data system (California Alcohol and Drug Data\nSystem [CADDS], primarily from 1996, with a few in late\nresented subgroups). These clients were invited to participate\nin the study by their treatment providers. A 76% interview\nrate was achieved from sampled admissions who could be\nlocated: 350 usable interviews were obtained, 15 had incom-\nplete interviews, 88 declined participation, 28 expressed inter-\nest but did not schedule or complete interviews, 6 had died;\nan additional 151 sampled admissions could not be located.\nA comparison of data available from admission records for the\ninterviewed and not-interviewed subgroups showed no sig-\nnificant differences in gender, education, age of first MA use,\nage at sampled treatment episode admission, number of prior\ntreatment episodes, employment status, whether homeless,\npregnant, or under legal supervision. (Additional descriptions\non study and interview procedures and sample characteris-\ntics appear in Brecht et al and von Mayrhauser et al.25,26) The\nInstitutional Review Board at the University of California,\nLos Angeles approved this study, and participants provided\nwritten informed consent.\nInstrument. Face-to-face interviews were conducted\nusing the Natural History Interview (NHI) protocol, which\nhas over 30 years of use in substance abuse research with\nacceptable levels of reliability.27\u00ad29 The NHI assesses socio-\ndemographic and other background characteristics; substance\nuse, sexual risk, and criminal behaviors; and physical and\nmental health characteristics. A timeline followback segment\ncollects detailed life history of substance use, treatment utili-\nzation, criminal behavior, and legal status.\nMeasures. The NHI provided self-report data for this\nanalysis from questions including total number of pregnan-\ncies, number that ended in live births, number that terminated\nwithout a live birth (labeled \"fetal loss\" in this paper), and the\nnumber that terminated before six months, and at or after six\nmonths. Respondents were not asked to distinguish between\ninduced abortion and other fetal loss. Women were also asked\nwhether any of their biological children had a physical, men-\ntal, or learning disability (however, specific disabilities were\nnot assessed). To keep interviews at a feasible length, partici-\npants were asked for additional detail on up to five of their\nchildren; thus more detailed data were available for a total of\nPregnancy among methamphetamine-using women\n362 children. As this was not a clinical study, women were\nnot asked detailed questions about each pregnancy; thus data\nrepresent a general picture of occurrences during a life period\nthat involved MA use. Sexual risk items included number of\npartners and use of condoms in the 30 days preceding the\ninterview. Items from the timeline followback segment pro-\nvided data on reasons for changes in MA use patterns and for\ntreatment entry.\nSubstance use behaviors were assessed, including past\nmonth use of MA, any past regular use of crack/cocaine (cat-\negorized as no/yes), age of MA initiation, and age of initiation\nof regular MA use. To further assess drug use severity, an over-\nall poly-drug indicator was calculated, indicating the num-\nber of types of drugs ever used (from cocaine, crack, ecstasy,\nphencyclidine, inhalants, hallucinogens, opiates including\nheroin, tranquilizers, and downers). A composite MA prob-\nlem score (possible range 0\u00ad7) was calculated to indicate the\nnumber of physical/mental health problems women reported\nas resulting from their MA use (ie, weight loss, sleeplessness,\nparanoia, hallucinations, dental problems, skin problems, and\nhigh blood pressure).\nRegarding mental health status, respondents reported\nwhether they had experienced specific mental health problems\nthat were not a direct result of drug or alcohol use prior to\ntheir treatment episode for sampling or in the past 30 days,\nincluding serious depression or anxiety that lasted two or more\nweeks, trouble concentrating/understanding/remembering\n(ie, cognitive problems) that lasted two or more weeks, and\ntrouble controlling violent behavior. Respondents were also\nasked whether they ever seriously considered committing\nsuicide, and those who did were asked whether they ever\nattempted suicide. Lastly, respondents were asked whether\nthey experienced physical abuse (ie, having been hit or beaten\nso hard that you had cuts or bruises, had to stay in bed, or had\nto see the doctor) and sexual abuse (ie, forced or pressured to\ndo any sexual acts against your will), and how many times this\nhappened before age 15 (labeled \"early physical abuse\" and\n\"early sexual abuse\" in this paper).\nAnalysis. Analyses include percentages or means as\nappropriate of distributional characteristics. Ethnic subgroup\ncomparisons were made using ANOVA. Comparisons were\nmade against national figures using one-sample t-tests or\ngoodness-of-fit chi square.30 National data used for compari-\nson purposes are from the National Center for Health Statis-\ntics.31 Comparison data were selected for 1995 as representative\nof the broader time frame covered by the study participants'\nMA use and reproductive histories. Statistics from this report\nused for comparison are estimated lifetime pregnancy and live\nbirth rates; the difference between these two indicate rate of\npregnancies not resulting in a live birth (including induced\nabortions and other fetal loss).\nTo examine the association of sexual risk behaviors,\ndrug use, and mental health status with pregnancy outcomes\n(total number of pregnancies and pregnancies that did and\ndid not end in live birth), Pearson correlation analyses were\nconducted for continuous variables and independent sam-\nples t-tests were conducted for categorical variables. Unless\notherwise indicated, the significance level (two-tailed) was\nResults\nSample description. This diverse sample of 153 women\nwhite, and 5% multiracial or other ethnicity.

Among\nwomen with children in this sample, 31% reported having a\nchild with a physical, mental, and/or learning disability.\nComparison of pregnancies and fetal losses to national\nstatistics. While 1995 national statistics show an overall\nlifetime pregnancy rate of 3.2 per woman,31 the MA sample\noverall average of 4.6 even though 82% of the study sample\nwere still under age 40 and thus may not have completed\ntheir fertility period. In this MA sample, Hispanics and non-\nHispanic whites had somewhat similar pregnancy rates of 4.4\nand 3.9, respectively, while African-Americans had a rate of\ntrast sharply with national figures for non-Hispanic whites\nsignificant difference was seen for Hispanics (MA sample 4.4\nBrecht and Herbeck\nvs. national average 4.6). The MA sample also had higher than\nusual average number of pregnancies that ended without a live\nbirth: 2.1 per woman vs. a national lifetime average of 1.2\ncans having the highest rate, of 4.1 per woman, of pregnancies\nending without a live birth; Hispanic (1.3) and non-Hispanic\nwhite (1.9) rates were each significantly lower than that of\nAfrican-Americans. Comparison to national figures shows\na significantly higher average number of losses for non-\nHispanic whites (MA sample 1.9 vs. national average 0.9;\naverage also resulted for African-Americans (MA sample 4.1\nthis is a small subgroup in the MA sample with large vari-\nability for this variable. Figure 1 shows the average number of\npregnancies per woman for each ethnic group, as well as the\naverage per woman of pregnancies that ended without a live\nbirth.

Of the 57 women who reported drug use and/\nor alcohol intoxication during the month preceding the inter-\nview, 28% reported combining substance use with sex at least\nhalf the time.\nOnly 44% of women mentioned pregnancy as a reason\nfor changing their pattern of MA use. Fewer women reported\nentering SUD treatment because of a pregnancy: of the 143\nwomen who been pregnant, 84% said that pregnancy had no\neffect on their decisions to enter treatment, 15% said that it\nencouraged them to enter treatment, and 1% to stay out. All\nbut three women resumed or increased MA use after at least\none of their pregnancies, with about one-third of explanations\nof relapse being associated with pregnancy, including to \"lose\nbaby fat,\" to \"have energy for kids,\" because \"I wasn't preg-\nnant anymore,\" and \"I felt so bad about my baby being taken\naway.\"\nAnecdotal evidence from a supplemental in-depth quali-\ntative interview exemplifies one intersection of MA use, preg-\nnancy, and treatment entry. For example, one woman reported\n20 pregnancies, 17 of which ended with abortion: with her\nfirst pregnancy at age 14, she stopped using all substances and\n\"the baby was ok\"; with the two other pregnancies she car-\nried to term, she \"used everything\" until the last two months.\nShe indicated abstaining from MA for brief periods before her\nhealth care visits during pregnancy because she did not want\nher substance abuse detected.\nPregnancy outcomes related to sexual risk, drug use,\nand mental health status.

However, more sexual partners was also associated\nwith greater drug use severity as indicated by significant cor-\nrelations with poly-drug use (r = 0.22) and number of MA-\nrelated problems (r = 0.19; results not shown in table). Likewise,\na higher number of fetal losses was associated with greater\nBrecht and Herbeck\ndrug use severity; in contrast, more live births were associated\nwith lower drug use severity. Regarding early sexual abuse,\ngreater severity was associated with more total pregnancies,\nand correlations were in the same direction for number of live\nDiscussion\nIn this sample of women with MA-use histories, we see a\nhigh average number of pregnancies per woman overall, 44%\nhigher than the national figure, and specifically for African-\nAmericans and non-Hispanic whites. We also see higher\naverage numbers of pregnancies that terminated without a live\nbirth. Furthermore, there was a high rate of late-term fetal\nloss (2% of pregnancies, representing 4.8% of those pregnan-\ncies that ended without a live birth). These high rates are cause\nfor concern, as we see epidemic spread of MA use to previ-\nously low-prevalence areas of the US.11,12\nThe concurrence of sexual risk-taking behaviors and high\nfrequencies of pregnancies is of particular interest: risk behav-\niors, including the low rate of condom use, may not only expli-\ncate the high number of pregnancies but also further endanger\nthe health of those women and fetuses. In a US national sample\nof adult women, rates of condom use during the past 10 vagi-\nnal intercourse events and during the most recent intercourse\nby age and relationship status, with older women and those\nwith a relationship partner (ie, spouse, partner, boyfriend,\nsignificant other or dating partner) having lower rates of con-\ndom use than younger women and those with casual partners;\namong women with relationship partners, rates ranged from\nwomen (age 40\u00ad49); among women with casual partners, rates\nfor older women (age 40\u00ad49). While these rates are lower than\nUS national goals for increasing condom use,33 they are mark-\nedly higher than the overall rate of 5% observed in our study\nand within marital status and age categories.\nCombining drug use with pregnancy suggests a public\nhealth problem with potentially high social and health care\ncosts. Indeed, we note that 31% of women in this sample with\nchild(ren) report that they have children with physical, men-\ntal, and/or learning disabilities. Furthermore, results show\ncontinuing use of illicit drugs by many of the women; and\nmore than two-thirds were smokers at the time of interview.\nThus, the continuation of risk-taking behaviors implies the\npersistence of social and health care costs.\nAs pregnancy offers a specific motivation to discontinue\ndrug use and an avenue for interaction between MA-using\nwomen and health services, prenatal care should afford an\nopportunity to identify SUD treatment and risk reduction\nneeds and connect women to appropriate interventions. Par-\nticipation in SUD treatment has been shown to be effective in\nreducing substance use in general,34\u00ad37 and results are begin-\nning to accumulate that treatment also has positive outcomes\nfor MA users.38\u00ad41 Moreover, among pregnant substance users\nwho screened positive for any of several substances including\namphetamines, SUD treatment integrated with prenatal vis-\nits has been associated with a positive effect on both mater-\nnal and newborn health.42 While not specific to MA users,\nSUD treatment during pregnancy has been shown to improve\nbirth outcomes among heroin and cocaine users.43 Programs\ndesigned specifically for women have shown positive out-\ncomes, particularly in improving psychological factors.44\nHowever, results indicate the complexity of the relation-\nship among MA use, pregnancy, and SUD treatment entry.\nAs some pregnant women decreased or paused MA use but\nfew entered SUD treatment because of pregnancy, results sug-\ngest that pregnant women may face barriers to SUD treat-\nment entry. For example, some report decreasing rather than\ncompletely refraining from use, suggesting that treatment\nrequirements of abstinence may impede treatment entry. Also,\nrelatively few women were motivated to enter treatment due\nto pregnancy. This appears consistent with earlier work show-\ning low rates of perceived need for treatment among pregnant\narrestees, similar to non-pregnant women arrestees.45 The\nanecdote described above indicates that women may fear\nreporting MA use to medical authorities, which may be a major\nbarrier to substance abuse treatment access. Future research\nmust explore barriers to treatment so that intervention strate-\ngies can be designed accordingly. Treatment must also account\nTable 2.

Furthermore,\nresearch must examine reasons why more women do not alter\nMA use behaviors during pregnancy. Of particular interest\nmay be women's knowledge of MA's effect on fetuses.\nOur findings also indicate women who had more severe\nsubstance abuse problems, used crack/cocaine, had more\nsexual partners, and had cognitive and/or anxiety problems\nsuffered a greater number of fetal losses than women with-\nout these problems. Whether fetal losses were the result of\nspontaneous or induced abortions (not distinguished in this\nstudy), the women in this sample may have experienced sub-\nstantial adverse physical and/or psychological consequences\nprior to, or due to these losses. Studies have shown that preg-\nnancy loss per se, whether abortion or miscarriage, increases\nthe risk of a range of substance use disorders and psychiat-\nric problems.46\u00ad48 Thus, efforts to assist women in accessing\nreproductive health care resources may reduce unintended\npregnancies and facilitate improved health outcomes. To\nreduce unintended pregnancy, McEneaney and Hong49\nsuggest health care professionals foster a supportive, non-\njudging environment to address reproductive health issues,\nprovide counseling about common misconceptions about\ncontraception, and create an individualized birth control\nplan. This approach may be especially important for MA-\nusing women, who may also benefit from on-going follow-\nup and assistance accessing emergency contraception (eg,\n\"morning after pill\") if needed; a study by Trussell et al50\nindicates emergency contraception is effective whether pro-\nvided when the emergency arises or in advance to be used as\nneeded, and can reduce the considerable medical and social\ncosts of unintended pregnancies.\nSimilar to findings on fetal loss, having a greater number\nof children was associated with specific mental health prob-\nlems. Women who had more live births were more likely to\nreport serious depression prior to substance abuse treatment\nand had trouble controlling violent behavior. They were also\nsomewhat more likely to have experienced more severe early\nsexual abuse than women with fewer live births. Previous\nstudies indicate women with children have a need for compre-\nhensive, enhanced substance abuse treatment programs that\nrespond to the range of social service needs of women, and\nprovide services including outreach and integrated care, ie,\nservices that include on-site child-related services with addic-\ntion services.51,52 Our findings suggest women with more chil-\ndren may have an even greater need than women with fewer\nchildren for mental health care services addressing sexual\nabuse/trauma, violence, and depression.\nInterpretation and generalization of study results must\nconsider limitations including: (1) population specificity of\nMA-using women who have presented for SUD treatment;\n(2) geographic limitation to one large metropolitan county in\nthe US; however, the population magnitude and ethnic and\nsocio-demographic diversity of the target geographic area sup-\nports the relevance of results and the sample itself is diverse\nand representative of the county's treatment population; (3)\ninability to link MA use to specific pregnancy outcomes, since\nthe study did not collect clinical records that would allow\ndirect association of specific individual pregnancy character-\nistics and birth outcomes; (4) inability to distinguish reason\nfor fetal loss from data collected in this study. Future research\nshould be undertaken to provide additional detail on specific\npregnancies, fetal losses, risk behaviors, and temporal linkage\nto substance use patterns.\nThis study is also limited in that the data were collected\nin 1996; accordingly the women in our sample participated in\nsubstance abuse and medical treatments that may have\nchanged or improved in recent years. However, treatment for\nMA use has remained psychosocial in nature; and while some\napproaches have been specialized to MA users with improved\noutcomes, treatment outcomes across the broad range of sub-\nstance use treatment systems have shown less change.37,53\nDespite these limitations, this study provides a useful general\npicture of MA-using women who come in contact with the\nsubstance use treatment system, a picture not widely available\nin the literature. This contact with treatment services remains\nan important vector to link them with appropriate medi-\ncal, mental health, and other services. Studies indicate MA\nuse has increased overall8,9 and specifically among pregnant\nwomen, and the adverse effects of MA on women's overall\nhealth and on the health and welfare of their children are not\nonly continuing but may be worsening in more recent years.13\nFor example, the number of women MA users admitted to\ntreatment for substance abuse increased nearly six-fold from\nTerplan et al13further report that MA has been the primary\ndrug of abuse among pregnant women admitted to drug treat-\nment since 2003, and MA-related treatment admissions are\nrising among pregnant women, as are accompanying burdens\nof medical and social comorbidities.\nResults show compelling differences between this sample\nof women treated for MA use from national statistics, and as\nsuch support the need for additional attention to prevention\nand treatment efforts. Men and women differ markedly with\nregard to their use of, and responses to MA,56 and addressing\nthe specific needs of women may improve gender-responsive\ntreatment strategies and health and welfare outcomes for\nwomen and their children.\n"
