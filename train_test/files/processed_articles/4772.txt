Little empirical research has been carried out that has specifically examined the day-\nto-day input of family members into the care of people with dementia during an acute hospital\nadmission. In this article, we present the results of analysis of interviews with 26 family members\nof people with dementia about their experiences of supporting an admission of a person with\ndementia to an acute hospital unit in New Zealand. For all family members, the desire to support\nthe person with dementia during their admission was at the forefront and was their primary focus.\nThe theme, `And so I took up residence', exemplifies fully the experiences of all of the family\nmember participants. This study provides evidence that family members are a resource that may\nbe unrecognised, untapped and unsupported in the event of hospitalisation of people with\ndementia.\n",

In the UK, people with dementia have longer stays in hospital\nwith more re-admissions and higher mortality rates than older people without dementia\nIn New Zealand, the prevalence of dementia is known to be underestimated by the Public\nHealth Intelligence (PHI) unit of the Ministry of Health data, as it is determined by contact\nwith specific data systems. Only 45% of people with dementia are identified in the PHI data\n(Alzheimer's New Zealand, 2008). The number of discharges from hospital for people with\ndementia in the PHI data is comparable with the New Zealand Health and Information\nService (NZHIS) data where dementia is one of up to 20 diagnoses (but not necessarily the\nprimary diagnosis) in a hospital admission (Alzheimer's New Zealand, 2008). Similar\nproportions are found in some European countries and North America.\nIn the UK, patients aged 60 years or over account for 23% of attendances to the\nEmergency Department (ED) (Bannerjee, Conroy & Cooke, 2012). Older people are more\nlikely to arrive by ambulance, have more investigations done and spend a longer time in the\nED than younger people (Bannerjee et al., 2012). Hospitalisation can be traumatic and\nfraught with complications for any older adult particularly if they have cognitive\nimpairment (Bridges, Flatley & Meyer, 2010; Glover et al., 2014; Tadd, Hillman, Calnan,\nBayer & Read, 2011). Admission to hospital leads to many challenges for people with\ndementia predominantly due to communication difficulties and distress experienced at\nbeing in an unfamiliar environment (Alzheimer's Society, 2009; Care Quality Commission,\n2014). These challenges not only impact on the person with dementia but also on their family\nmembers and the hospital staff.\nThere is a growing body of evidence that shows that health care professionals have poor\nrecognition of cognitive impairment among older patients (Lyketsos, Sheppard & Rabins,\n2000; Torisson, Minthon, Stavenow & Londos, 2012) and are unskilled in communicating\nwith people with dementia (Bamford, Hughes & Robinson, 2007; de Vries, 2013). This\nabsence of skills has been shown to lead to poor person-centred care and people with\ndementia being neglected and treated with a lack of dignity and respect (Kitwood, 1997),\ndemonstrated, for example by people with dementia not being assisted to eat and drink; and\nbeing administered antipsychotic medication as a means of managing difficult behaviour\nAdmission to hospital increases the risk for people with dementia of institutionalisation\nRCP, 2013); accelerated morbidity and mortality (Andersen, Lolk, Martinussen & Kragh-\nSorensen, 2010; Baker, Cook, Arrighi & Bullock, 2011; Freedberg, Dave, Kurth, Gaziano &\n\u00a8 rlein, Halfens, Dassen & Lahmann, 2010;\noften they die with inadequate pain control or without the benefits of hospice care (Birch\nFew people with dementia are admitted to hospital as a result of their dementia;\nadmission is generally as a result of an exacerbation of an existing co-morbidity or an\nacute event that may or may not be related to the dementia, with infection and fractures\nthe most common reasons for admission (Natalwala, Potluri, Uppal & Heun, 2008; Rudolph\net al., 2010; Tuppin et al., 2009). In a study carried out in Crete, Greece (Samonis,\nGiannousi, Varbobitis, Sardi & Falagas, 2009) found that during hospitalisation family\nmembers may provide a considerable amount of informal care and support for this\npatient group and that for an older person, being single and having no children were\nproven risk factors for neglect. Family member capability and preference on how much\ninvolvement in care they may undertake varies considerably and it has been shown\nHeller, 2002). Furthermore, they often feel responsible for supervision of the quality of\ncare (Li, Stewart, Imle, Archbold & Felver, 2000; Lindhardt, Bolmsjo & Hallberg, 2006;\nLindhardt, Nyberg & Hallberg, 2008). However, poor communication between staff and\nrelatives of frail older people in acute wards may inhibit full participation in care (Li, 2002)\nand relatives have rated collaboration with nurses as poor in regard to decision-making\nand facilitating opportunities for social interaction (Alzheimer's Society, 2009; Lindhardt\nThere has been sparse empirical research conducted that has specifically examined the\nday-to-day input of family members into the care of people with dementia during an acute\nhospital admission. In this article, we present the results of the analysis of interviews with\n26 family members of people with dementia about their experiences of supporting a person\nwith dementia during admission to an acute hospital unit in New Zealand.\nMethodology\nThe research presented in this article was part of a larger mixed method study. The first two\nphases of the study were conducted at five District Health Boards (DHBs) in New Zealand;\ntwo in the South Island and three in the North Island. In Phase 1, a retrospective case note\nreview of all people over the age of 65 admitted to acute medical and orthopaedic wards\nduring three separate periods of one month, to capture seasonal differences, during 2012 was\ncarried out. Phase 2 involved the administration of the `Approaches to Dementia\nQuestionnaire' (ADQ) (Lintern & Woods, 2001) and focus group interviews with staff\nproviding care on the wards identified. Phase 3 (reported in this paper) involved\n26 interviews with family members of a person with dementia who had experienced one\nor more admission to an acute hospital ward within the last five years. Ethical approval was\ngained from Central Ethics Committee, New Zealand.\nThe objective of this phase of the study was to explore the experiences and challenges\nencountered by family members of people with dementia during an admission to an acute\nhospital unit. Participants had no direct connection to the five DHBs within which Phases 1\nand 2 had been conducted. The inclusion criteria for taking part in the study was that the\nparticipant was a family member of a person with dementia who been a patient in an acute\nhospital unit within the last five years. We had no exclusion criteria.\nThe interviews were conducted from self-selected convenience samples (Suri, 2011)\nwhere we advertised for participants in local newspapers, at Alzheimer's Conferences\nand other venues such as caregiver support forums or through contacts of participants,\nthat is using a Respondent-Driven sampling approach (Heckathorn, 1997; Penrod,\nPreston, Cain & Starks, 2003). Semi-structured interviews were conducted by all three\nauthors in environments that were negotiated between the interviewer and the\nparticipant. Some were conducted at the participants own home; some were conducted\nin private spaces during conferences; and some in the researchers' workplace. Interviews\nlasted from 45 to 100 minutes. They were audio-recorded and transcribed by a professional\nconfidential transcriber.\nde Vries et al. 3\nEvery story that was shared by the caregiver was individual and varied. The detailed,\ncomplex and challenging situations that each one had faced, particularly in relation to the\ndeath of the person with dementia, stand alone as individual stories and are reported as such\nelsewhere. For the purposes of this paper, we were specifically interested in the experiences of\nthe hospitalisation events and have examined these events in light of our study objective.\nData were analysed by the first author following a conventional content analysis process\n(Hsieh & Shannon, 2005) using a coding scheme developed following line-by-line coding\nconducted on several transcripts by all three authors. This approach was used as there was\nlimited research literature on the phenomenon under investigation. All three authors then\nagreed the emergent themes across transcripts.\nFindings\nThe majority of participants (22) were women (Table 1). Of those, 12 had a mother with\ndementia; one had a mother-in-law with dementia. Four participants had a father with\ndementia; one a stepfather. A further five had a spouse with dementia, of these only one\nparticipant was the husband of a wife with dementia. The remaining participants consisted\nof a brother of brother (with dementia), sister of a sister, son of mother and niece of her\nuncle.\nTen of the people with dementia were already resident in a care home facility and 12 of\nthem were admitted from their own home to hospital but discharged to a care home facility.\nOnly four of them were still resident in their own homes at the time of the study. Eight had\nmultiple admissions. Pseudonyms are used for all participants.\n`And so I took up residence'\nThe theme, `and so I took up residence', exemplifies fully the sentiments expressed by all\nof the family members. Embedded in this theme were the complexities that encompassed\nthe positions that family members took in making sure they were present to attend to the\nneeds of the person with dementia and are represented in the following three subthemes:\nassertive advocacy; the need to be present; and dealing with humiliation, neglect and loss of\ndignity.\nAnd so I took up residence, well I'd gone up with enough clothes for four days and took [person\nwith dementia] to see the doctor. They admitted her acutely, I didn't go home for 48 hours after\nthat and yeah she came, she had the anaesthetic it wasn't a problem you know. And then we\nstarted active treatment. . . One of my biggest issues was you've put [person with dementia] into\nan environment she doesn't know and she'd get confused and if you break the routines that she's\nused to it's going to add to the things. You're going to have all sorts of problems. Here you've\ngot a person with Alzheimer's reasonably continent. . . is continent. . . and you don't want to be\nmessing anything up with that with routines. I took over and I just wrote up a big care plan, big\npiece of paper and put it on the wall [person with dementia] daily routine, you know. (Elaine\nFor all family members, the desire to support the person with dementia during their\nadmission to an acute hospital unit was at the forefront and was their primary focus. All\nof the family members had some type of influence over the care practices that they\nencountered in the acute environment. In some cases, they were deferred to and listened\nTable 1.

This `assertive advocacy' demonstrated how their approach was more than just\nbeing an advocate. Family members demonstrated this assertiveness in a number of ways.\nSome took almost complete control of the care regime for the person with dementia as their\nconcerns centred on maintaining routines and in most cases, at some stage, the family\nmember was actively involved in providing care. In many situations, it was the\nassertiveness of the family member that ensured attention to health issues were dealt with\ncomprehensively. They set the care perimeters, on some occasions, even going so far as to\nwrite a plan of care for the person with dementia and making sure this was adhered to by\nstaff (see Elaine's quote above).\nIf the person with dementia had specific medication regimes they were vigilant in making\nsure these were adhered to by staff and all family members were observant of any indication\nthat the person with dementia was experiencing pain and in many cases made assertive\nrequests for analgesia when they felt it was necessary:\nShe never complained but you know I mean involuntary groans and grunts just indicated that\nshe was feeling pain alright.\nInterviewer: So they noticed if she was in pain by movement?\nWell they should have known anyway, yes.\nInterviewer: And did you tell them if you saw that she had pain?\nYou bet I did, yes. I said can you do something about it. (Graham [son] 126\u00ad144)\nAs well as expressing concerns about under medication to staff, family members also had\nconcerns about `over medicating'. This was a significant issue for a number of participants at\nsome stage during the admission, particularly sedating medications that impacted on the\nalertness of the person with dementia. Almost all family members demonstrated that they\nhad some knowledge of issues regarding frailty and medication dosage for older people and\nof the effect of antipsychotic medications and were vigilant about the side effects or efficacy\nof these:\n[Following medication with Clonazepam] so then she slept for the next twenty-four hours so we\ncouldn't do anything except. . . I was able to wake her enough to feed her and to keep the pain\nrelief and everything up. Then she became a little bit vocal so they gave her some more\nClonazepam. So in the end I had to ask them not to give her Clonazepam because I said you\nknow she's got to be given a chance of rehab here. (Jill [daughter] 83\u00ad120)\nShe was in the hospital and I observed her at close quarters eight hours a day for five days and\nI noticed they were giving her this drug called Quetiapine so I said to the nurse, could I have a\nlook at the file. And the nurse said oh you can't look at that, I said hand it over, this is my\nmother we're talking about give it to me so she did. (Alice [daughter] 250\u00ad253)\nAll admissions were through the ED, and in most cases involved an ambulance transfer from\nplace of residence to the hospital. Eight of the people with dementia had repeated admissions\nto hospital \u00ad always via the ED \u00ad and in some cases, the admission only went as far as the\nED as a result of assertiveness and advocacy demonstrated by the family member. This was\nde Vries et al. 7\nbecause either prior experience, or the situation they were facing at the time, was so\ndisturbing and stressful for both the family member and the person with dementia that\nthey insisted on taking the person home rather than have them admitted:\nSo that was the same process, ambulance and I thought oh no are you sure he needs to go and\nthey [care home] said yes we're really concerned and so he went in and he perked up quite soon\nand I was very clear with them, I'm taking him out, I'm taking him now.\nInterviewer: So he only got to ED again?\nHe did. Yep.\nInterviewer: And were they better that time?\nI wasn't going to give them any chance, so I very much managed it. Yep. I wasn't going to go\nThe reverse also occurred when the medical team wanted to send the person with dementia\nhome and the family member considered that the person needed to be admitted. The\ndetermination not to back down was also extremely distressing for family members to the\npoint of, at times, reducing them to tears:\nSo I brought her in and they assessed her and they sort of said oh well you know it probably is a\nnose bleed and I said well I don't care, I want her admitted. Well then I got this feisty little house\nsurgeon who wanted to send her home the next day and I said no she's not coming home, she\nneeds an assessment. . . I want her assessed and she argued black and blue. . . I said she deserves\nmore than this and actually I ended up in tears in this room and one of the doctors came in\nand said to me, what's going on and I said they want to send her home. (Gail [daughter-in-law]\nFor a number of family members, the time spent in the ED was the most difficult. This was\nan environment in which they found they needed to be particularly firm regarding gaining\nattention from staff. They were often left waiting for long periods and in some cases only\nreceived attention when they assertively approached staff:\nAnd finally at eleven o'clock I went and said that unless they could see us now I was going\nto take him home and she said don't do that because you know he could get septic which was\nvery true actually. And so she went in and more or less commandeered a bed for him. Well that\nwas about eleven o'clock when I said it then, when we finally got in there and then we had to wait\nof course for him to be seen. I think he was seen about one o'clock in the morning. (Holly [wife]\nFamily members of those that had repeated admissions did not find any improvement with\neach admission and became even more vigilant about how staff managed the transition\nthrough the ED.\nAssertiveness was also required in some cases in relation to discharge plans. It required a\nstrong measure of confidence for family members to ensure that the person was not\ndischarged too early or without sufficient systems being put in place to support the person\nat home:\nHe had the surgery and they rung up and said come and take him home and I said no, the\nunderstanding was, he's had an anaesthetic he's got dementia, he's staying in for 24 hours at\nleast. They weren't very happy but they did keep him till the next morning. (Edna [wife] 362-\nFamily members wanted to ensure that the person with dementia was actually ready to be\ndischarged and that while they were on the unit that consideration was given to\nrehabilitation or at least to maintenance of their current level of functioning:\nAnd she's really getting stressed, all she wants to do is go home but I can't let her go home until I\nknow if she can boil the billy safely and pour hot water. You know it's all those little things. So I\njust said that the systems not geared around dementia patients. It's bad enough having a stroke\nbut when we've got two combinations in there she got all the attention in the first few days, the\ncritical stage till she's medically cleared and then it all stops. She's just sitting vegetating. (Jenny\nFor others, assertive approaches were taken when they believed that staff were not attending\nto the needs of the patient. Although family members frequently did not feel knowledgeable\nabout the subject of dementia, they were prepared to take a stand over what they believed\nwas the right approach to treatment:\nI said she needs a dressing changed. `Oh I'll be there soon'. So finally [the nurse] came and I said\noh she's also got a blister on her heel now. She never had that earlier. When I talked to\nsomebody the next day they said oh it would be friction. I said no. I said she didn't move.\nShe can't move her left leg. I said that is just pure pressure. Then they were going to put her on a\npressure relieving mattress, waited another two days for that. (Jill [daughter] 175\u00ad180)\nAn assertive position was also taken at suggestions that the person with dementia might not\nbe resuscitated:\n[Person with dementia had had four strokes] the last one in 2012 was a bad one. They say he\nnearly died. They got me down at the hospital and tried to get me to sign papers to say not to\nresuscitate him, and I said no I'm not doing that, you're the doctors you'll do your best. (Mark\nOther ways in which family members established their assertiveness was in situations where\nstaff demonstrated poor understanding of how the symptoms of dementia manifested,\nparticularly in relation to communicating with the person with dementia. There were\ninstances when the medical professional completely disregarded the family member's input\ninto history taking and assessment processes. In the following extract, this daughter had\nexplained to the doctor that her father was unable to communicate but the doctor ignored\nher and proceeded to interview her father:\nAnd I just sat there. I couldn't look at him I was [so] angry and, and then he said after a while [of\nattempting to assess the person with dementia] he said oh it's quite clear that your father can't\ncommunicate to me. And I was like `really'! (Denise [daughter] 73\u00ad75)\nIn all cases, at some time during the admission, the person with dementia expressed the\ndesire to `go home'. A number of family members felt that staff took this cry to `go home' too\nliterally, due to their lack of understanding of how some of the symptoms of dementia\nmanifest:\n[Family member] would have staff telling him that [person with dementia] wants to go home.\nWell we knew that. And they're insisting that we set things in place so that he could go home\nbecause he had friends in Australia that he wanted to visit and you know I said to one of the staff\nnurses one day, well do you know that it's twenty years since he's actually seen these people.\nde Vries et al. 9\nYou know it was all in his mind it was a distant memory and it was very difficult and\nI understand that this is difficult because [person with dementia] was so plausible in his\nspeaking that when you're having a conversation with him it's easy to believe everything he\nOther examples where family members became assertive were where staff `talked over' the\nperson with dementia, or wanted to discuss details about their care or condition `in front' of\nthe person with dementia without including them in that conversation:\nThey asked me if I knew he had dementia, oh I said yes and the registrar came and said I want to\ntalk to you about his condition. And I said well I'm not talking to you here.\nInterviewer: Was it because he was there and you didn't want to talk in front of him?\nYes. And it was the same with [one family member], with [another family member]. She said\ndon't talk about him in front of him. Either talk to him or take me somewhere and that's how\nAfter assertively fighting their corner and being successful in achieving their aim of getting\nappropriate attention, some family members experienced residual frustration and anger that\nthey had had to fight for the service and felt that they needed to convey this. In some cases,\nthey followed up on their concerns by returning to the hospital and expressing their\ndissatisfaction about the outcome of the admission:\nWhen I went back, well, actually I made a bit of a, you know, I had a bit of a . . . `discussion' shall\nI say. At which case they said, well perhaps, no it wasn't the most logic thing to send her home,\nperhaps they should actually at least wait until they had some sensitivities back and so on. (Kate\nAll family members felt that they needed to be vigilant throughout the admission, and be\nready to be an advocate for the person with dementia. In most cases, this required them to be\npresent for as much time as possible during the admission.\nThe need to be present\nFamily members tended to spend a large amount of their time at the hospital, at the bedside\nof the person with dementia; some spending as much time as they could at the hospital\nduring the period of the admission: `I went most days'; `I went every day'; `Well most days I\ngot there mid-morning and I left just after tea time'; `I sit with her till she sleeps every night\npretty much'; `Yeah so I'm in here all the time'.\nThis was, in some cases, due to a sense of duty and obligation:\nLike he's at the hospital and you feel you've got to visit him every day at least when he's at home\nI know Mum will call me or text me if there's something wrong, whereas when they're in the\nhospital you feel that you need to go every day. (Sue [daughter] 143\u00ad147)\nOr devotion:\nIt was a case of you know for better for worse as far as I was concerned. I took it seriously. (Ben\nThere were a variety of reasons why family members felt that they needed to be present, such\nas making sure the person with dementia was getting one-to-one attention, particularly if\nthey were distressed or manifesting behaviours for which the family member had well-\nestablished strategies for managing:\nIt was the only thing to stop his levels of distress escalating was to keep moving with him. And\nthen after an hour I thought you know he might look okay but he's actually not, this is really\ntricky so I sort of caught a nurse's attention or somebody passing and I said look my father has\ndementia this is quite stressful and I don't know how long I'm going to be able to do this for you\nknow and she said look we'll get to you as best as we can. Well two and a half hours later they'd\nwatched me go round in front of their office I don't know how many times. (Denise [daughter]\nThey also wanted to be present so that they could make sure they were fully informed about\nthe progress of the person with dementia. Family members would regularly make sure they\nwere present for a `medication rounds' and `doctors round' so they could ask questions, give\ntheir opinion regarding progress and assist in care activities whenever they could:\nI go every day around lunch time to help feed or talk her into having her pills or whatever they\nwere really good and they kept me right informed of what was going on and I requested some\nAll of the family members knew the particular personal habits, anxieties and behaviours of\nthe person with dementia and had strategies to manage these in the best interests of the\nperson. Consequently, their desire to be present was also to ensure that a safe environment\nwas maintained for the person and they found, from experience, that knowing how to\napproach the person with dementia could make a significant difference between the\nperson being distressed and, consequently, in some instances, the distress leading to\naggressive behaviour:\n[Spent all day at the hospital] well for safety sake because he's quite unsafe, he was wandering\naway and he did escape quite quickly even though he's got a walker and he uses a wheelchair\nthey don't know how he gets out onto the main part of [name of hospital], so my stepmother\ntalked to him and said did you know that every time you go away (he's trying to get home) that\nthe person in charge here might lose her job if anything happens to you and he stopped doing it.\nSo he had some insight but he just didn't want to be there I don't think. And he kind of thought\nhe was [at home], he used to go into other people's rooms because he thought he had three\nrooms. . . so he would go and make three different beds. (Betty [daughter] 49\u00ad61)\nFamily members were very aware that their presence had a therapeutic effect on the person\nwith dementia. They observed that the person with dementia felt much safer and more secure\nand that as a consequence of their presence would be more cooperative with care\ninterventions. On some occasions, this required innovative approaches to creating security\nfor the person with dementia that were supported by hospital staff:\nSo we actually ended up having to take her to the emergency room at the hospital and the only\nway they could really calm her down was to put her in the same room as Dad [husband was a\npatient in same hospital]. So she was in the bed in the same room with Dad and she was quite\nhappy when she was there next to him. (Judy [daughter] 46\u00ad51)\nFamily members were not only vigilant regarding care interventions and approaches during\nthe hospital admissions. One of the greatest anxieties expressed by all participants was how\nmuch they wanted to ensure that the dignity of the person with dementia was maintained.\nDealing with humiliation, neglect and loss of dignity\nA number of the family members experienced considerable distress when they observed care\npractices that they felt were humiliating and reduced the dignity of the person with dementia.\nThis made them all the more determined to stay by their side during the admission. In many\ncases, this was not only in respect of their own family member. They also witnessed lack of\nrespect and dignity toward other people with dementia within the acute units. This was\ndemonstrated in a number of examples such as dressed in inappropriate clothes, exposure\nwhen changing continence pads and not closing curtains properly during care interventions.\nDuring the interviews, many of the family members were reduced to tears when they\ndescribed in detail some of what they termed as `undignified' events they were witness to\nor involved in during the hospital stay:\nIt was awful seeing. . . my poor husband staggering around in the middle of the room with only\nthe diaper on, he was naked and I just thought you know if I could just go back in time\nI would make sure the curtains were pulled because of the open door. . . Anyway I grabbed a\ntowel and said put this on him. She [nurse] said oh yeah I'm sorry and she did apologise. (Sheila\nIn some instances, the distress of the person with dementia culminated in extreme\ndemonstrations of the agitation, aggression and violent behaviour. Interventions by\nhospital staff, to manage the situation, and were witnessed by family members, were\nextremely distressing for them. They recognised the helplessness that was experienced by\nstaff but the horror of the event also left them with a sense of powerlessness at their failure to\nprotect the distressed person with dementia:\n[Person with dementia] had just gone berserk. . . they didn't know really how to handle it. . . they\nhad all security guards there and they had doctors there and they wanted to give him this\ninjection and so my daughter got there before me. . . she said when she got there the doctors\nwere saying we're going to give him this injection it takes twenty minutes to work and oh you\nknow but you, we might have to hold him down and you might not be happy about seeing that\nand she said, you won't have to hold him down, so they gave him the injection. And it didn't\nwork. And he was abusing everybody, it was awful. Absolutely horrible and I was in tears, my\ndaughter was in tears and they put a catheter in and I said to the nurse, um, I asked her if they\ncould give him something else. . . and she said no we can only give him only one of those\ninjections. (Helen [wife] 3\u00ad25)\nSome also felt strongly that if they were not present the person with dementia was at risk of\nnot receiving adequate care and, in some cases, this was seen as a very obvious act of neglect.\nFor example, for almost all family members, at some time, the issue of neglect at meal times\nwas reported as a source of concern. For a number of them, one of the primary reasons for\nmaintaining a presence at the hospital was to ensure that the person with dementia actually\nreceived food and fluid:\nWhen we were in the ward, nobody had sort of said well she's got dementia so they would come,\nthis lady came, they came and gave her her food, she didn't eat it so they took it away. . . She\ncouldn't get up. I don't think they did because that was what [family member] was angry\nabout. . . so they just plonk food down. . . I suppose I was up there most of the time and I'd\nbrought her lots of energy drinks. (Kathryn [daughter] 212\u00ad222)\nI just wonder if she'd get fed if I didn't go up at meal times. Because they were really busy the\nother night and so I'd fed Mum and I said look I'll feed the lady next door if you like because\nI knew her because she's also from the same rest home that Mum was in. Also a fractured\nfemur. . . and so I did that but it was just that you know by the time they would've got back\nto feed both [another resident from care home] and Mum their meals would've been stone cold.\nFamily members provided a substantial amount of care when at the bedside. Aside from\nassisting at meal time this included shaving, dressing, taking the person to the toilet and\nassisting with showering. They undertook these care activities as part of the desire to\nmaintain the dignity of the person with dementia by making sure they were presented at\ntheir best, clean and dressed appropriately \u00ad even if in nightclothes \u00ad in the manner in which\nthey knew the person would have taken pride, given the choice:\nSo when he was in hospital I'd go in during the day, I was still working but I think I was off then\nand you know I shaved him and things like that because his electric razor hadn't come so the\nnurses don't like using hand razors, so I don't mind, I'm used to it. I made sure he looked nice and\nprobably the most worst thing of the whole experience was the body pads. (Sheila [wife] 48\u00ad53)\nThere was also a perception that staff lacked understanding of what people with dementia\nwere actually capable of doing for themselves. Family members witnessed a range of\napproaches that they deemed inadequate to meet the complex needs of people with\ndementia:\nI think they expected for her to do more for herself. They'd ask her to lift her arm up to\nsomething and she would take a while to comprehend what they were saying. `Lift your arm\nup [person with dementia]' and she'd be looking at them and lift it half way up and put it down\nagain not sure if she was doing the right thing. I think she didn't have comprehension of what\nHowever, some family members were sympathetic towards the staff and did not perceive it as\nan issue or neglectful if, for example, the person with dementia was not being assisted with\nmeals. They saw it rather as an organisational problem and due to work pressures and time\nconstraints that they believed the staff were under:\nI think that is one of the problems probably in a hospital situations is that the staff haven't got\nthe time to sit there patiently trying to coax them to eat. (Judy [daughter] 202\u00ad204)\nI mean it was a lot of work for them. . . the staff. . . because of having to do the personal cares and\neverything. Supervise eating. If I hadn't been there would have been a lot of work for them.\nThe final two quotes capture the essential issue of why family members felt they needed to be\npresent, to be vigilant and watchful and to actively provide care for the person with dementia\nwhen admitted to an acute unit. They all had personal experience of providing care and were\nwell aware of how much time and one-to-one attention was required to undertake this and to\ndo it well.\nDiscussion\nThe aim of this study was to explore the experiences of family members of people with\ndementia during admission to an acute hospital unit. Little empirical research has been\ncarried out that has specifically examined the day-to-day contribution of family members to\nthe care of people with dementia during an acute hospital admission. There is a large body of\nresearch literature on caregiver and family member contribution to care in acute units for\nfrail older people (see Bridges et al., 2010; Clissett, Porock, Harwood & Gladman, 2013;\nchallenges for family members of patients with dementia are not often made explicit within\nthese studies.\nOf note, Jurgens, Clissett, Gladman and Harwood's (2012) study on dissatisfaction of\nfamily carers of people with dementia with general hospital care on geriatric and general\nmedical, and orthopaedic wards of a large English hospital, upholds many of our findings.\nThe researchers developed a model explaining dissatisfaction with care where they identified\na cycle of discontent. Events (or `crises') were associated with expectations which, when\nunmet, caused family members to become uncertain or suspicious. The uncertainty\nidentified by Jurgens and colleagues led to a period of `hyper vigilant monitoring'. Hyper\nvigilant monitoring involved family members seeking out evidence of poor care, which then\nled to challenges and conflict with staff similar to the experiences of family members in our\nstudy. This behaviour also supports the work of Lindhardt et al. (2008) who found that\nstanding guard was important for family members. Standing guard or being hyper vigilant\nconcords with our study where family members adopted a controlling behaviour, and closely\nmonitored any treatment delivered to the person with dementia including medication\nregimes. Jurgens et al. (2012) found that this hyper vigilant monitoring could lead to\nfamily member withdrawal, a factor that did not feature in our study. On the contrary,\n`taking up residence' and staying vigilant at the bedside of the person with dementia was a\nconstant feature.\nAll admissions in our study were through ED, and in most cases involved an ambulance\ntransfer from place of residence to the hospital. As in our study, Jurgens et al. (2012) found\nthat family members gave negative accounts of the admission experience through ED. The\nexperiences of our participants demonstrated the need for considerable improvement within\nthe ED (Clevenger, Chu, Yang & Hepburn, 2012) particularly in knowledge about the\nsymptoms of dementia; the psychosocial needs of people with dementia and their family\nmembers; how to communicate with people with dementia; and support strategies for family\nmembers.\nThe assertiveness demonstrated by family members in this study was similar to that\nwhich an advocate may offer or provide. However, family members revealed a personal\npassion and fierceness that went over and above being simply an advocate. This was likened\nto that of a relational approach to care as suggested by a number of authors (see Bridges\net al., 2010; Nolan et al., 2002). Family member concerns were primarily centred on the\nwellbeing of the person with dementia and a determination that optimum care was provided\nat all times but also in collaboration with the staff if possible. The small body of research\nthat has examined family member experiences of time spent at the bedside of a person with\ndementia in acute hospitals upholds our findings in respect to believing that the person\nwould be neglected if a family member was not present (Samonis et al., 2009), and ensuring\nattention is given to general physical care, including assisting with meals (Alzheimer's\nFollowing their systematic review on older people's and relatives' experiences in acute\ncare settings, Bridges et al. (2010) concluded that it was apparent that those older people\nwho were at particular risk of negative experiences of care were people with dementia,\ndelirium and communication difficulties. Tadd et al. (2011) also found that the reasons for\npoor attention to the dignity of older people in acute hospitals was due to a lack of\nknowledge about the needs of people with dementia and the lack of training in relation to\nthe provision of dignified care. There is a wide-ranging body of literature where attempts to\ndefine and clarify the concept dignity have been made (see, for example, Edlund, Lindwall,\nvon Post & Lindstro\n\u00b0 g, Petersen & Na\nis in common usage in many documents and health policies, professional codes of practice\nand research literature related to dementia care provision. The position that the family\nmembers were coming from was that of dignity as a spectacle where they witnessed the\nperson with dementia being exposed to what they felt were humiliating and undignified\nsituations (Radley, 2004). Radley (2004) presents dignity as both a spectacle and an\nachievement, a status which is accorded by its appearance. Dignity, as a `spectacle', refers\nto suffering (indignity) that is witnessed. The judgements made by family members on the\ndignity of the person with dementia fit a concept of dignity as a spectacle, where the dignity\nstatus was determined by the `spectator(s)' (Radley, 2004) and revolved around the exposure\nof the body and the gaze of others (Walsh & Kowanko, 2002). Undignified exposure of the\nbodies of people with dementia; and talking over the person with dementia as though they\nwere not present; have been identified as indications of lack of person centred care (Clissett\net al., 2013; Kitwood, 1997). Family members were determined to maintain the dignity,\nautonomy and agency of the person with dementia and believed that their presence was\nessential to facilitate this, a position upheld in the work of Li (2002, 2005) and Lindhardt\nLimitations\nThe limitations to this study are significant insomuch as the interview data were collected\nfrom self-selecting participants. All wanted to tell their story because they had some concerns\nabout the care the person with dementia received. However, the mixed method design and\nour data from the case-note review (reported elsewhere) corroborate the stories and upholds\nmany of the concerns raised by the family member participants.\nConclusion\nThis is one of the few studies that has specifically examined the day-to-day contribution of\nfamily members to the care of people with dementia during an acute hospital admission. The\nrole of family members is recognised as making an important contribution to care within the\nacute healthcare environment. This study provides evidence that family members are a\nresource that may be unrecognised, untapped and unsupported in the event of\nhospitalisation of people with dementia. The experiences described here by family\nmembers could inform the basis of an approach to care suggested by Lindhardt et al.\n(2008). That approach suggests developing collaboration between family members of\nolder people with dementia and acute care staff where relatives can become recognised as\ncompetent collaborative partners in care (Lindhardt et al., 2008). They propose that such a\nmodel of care offers family members a role as partners in care provision and decision-making\nthat has the potential to decrease the powerlessness that family members frequently\nexperience; and furthermore, this may ultimately increase satisfaction for family members,\nthe person with dementia and hospital staff.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: Funding for the full study was provided by Victoria University of\nWellington, NZ; part funding by Alzheimers New Zealand Charitable Trust Small Projects Grant.\nReferences\nAlzheimer's New Zealand.
