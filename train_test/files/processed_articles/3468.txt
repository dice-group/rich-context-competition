IBS is a\nchronic functional bowel disorder, often affecting\nyounger individuals,1 and characterized by\nabdominal pain in association with a disordered\nbowel habit.2 The condition affects approximately\noften presents in middle age with chronic watery\ndiarrhoea, and some studies suggest that the pres-\nence of abdominal pain is a negative predictor for\nMC.3,4 In addition, MC is rarer and has a reported\nyears for the two main histological subtypes:5 col-\nlagenous colitis (CC), characterized by a distinct\nsubepithelial collagen band, and lymphocytic\ncolitis (LC), with intraepithelial lymphocytosis.\nDespite these differences in epidemiology, given\nthe high prevalence of IBS, and the similarities in\nsome of the presenting features, there is the\nHigh prevalence of irritable bowel\nsyndrome-type symptoms in microscopic\ncolitis: implications for treatment\nJohn S.

This issue is important as\nit could lead to confusion between the two, delay-\ning the diagnosis and commencement of effective\ntherapies in patients with MC,6,7 or leading to\nunnecessary colonoscopy and biopsy in patients\nwith probable IBS.3 The degree of overlap\nbetween the two conditions has been examined in\nmeta-analyses, with up to one in three individuals\nwith MC reporting symptoms compatible with\nIBS.8,9 However, there were few available studies\nexamining this issue.\nIndividuals with a confirmed diagnosis of IBS are\nmore likely to suffer from coexistent mood disor-\nder, anxiety, and neuroticism compared with\nhealthy individuals,10 and to report lower quality\nof life.11,12 When symptoms compatible with IBS\nare reported by patients with other organic gas-\ntrointestinal (GI) conditions, such as idiopathic\ninflammatory bowel disease (IBD), they appear\nto impact on both mood and quality of life. In a\nlarge cross-sectional study conducted among 378\npatients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease,\nlevels of psychological comorbidity were signifi-\ncantly higher among those reporting IBS-type\nsymptoms compared with patients with quiescent\ndisease, and quality of life was reduced to a simi-\nlar degree to that seen in patients with confirmed\nAlthough studies conducted among patients with\nMC have shown that quality of life is impaired in\nboth CC and LC,14\u00ad17 the prevalence of mood\ndisorders, such as anxiety, depression, or somati-\nzation, is not clear. Data from another cross-sec-\ntional study, conducted among individuals with\nMC thought to be in disease remission clinically,\ndemonstrated that some patients continue to\nreport GI symptoms, which seem to impair\nhealth-related quality of life.15 Furthermore, in a\ncross-sectional study of Swedish women, individ-\nuals with a diagnosis of MC plus concomitant\nIBS-like symptoms had a greater impairment in\npsychological wellbeing compared with those\nwho did not report IBS-like symptoms, but the\nauthors did not report levels of anxiety, depres-\nsion, or somatization specifically.18\nWe therefore conducted this cross-sectional sur-\nvey to further assess the prevalence of IBS-type\nsymptoms and mood disorders in a large cohort\nof patients with a histological diagnosis of MC,\nand assess the impact of symptoms compatible\nwith IBS on psychological health including levels\nof anxiety, depression, somatization, and health-\nrelated quality of life. Our a priori hypothesis was\nthat the presence of IBS-type symptoms would\nimpact negatively on mood and quality of life in\npatients with MC, as we have seen in patients\nMaterials and methods\nParticipants and setting\nPotential participants were adult patients identi-\nfied as having a new histological diagnosis of MC\nfrom histology reports after presenting to the\nLeeds Teaching Hospitals over a 6-year period,\ninstitution, based in the north of England, pro-\nvides secondary care services to a population of\nMC during this period we confirmed survival sta-\ntus, ensured there was no evidence of a diagnosis\nof cognitive impairment, and sought an up-to-\ndate contact address, using hospital records.\nDiagnosis of microscopic colitis\nThe diagnosis of MC was according to the follow-\ning criteria: CC was defined as the presence of a\nsubepithelial collagen band of at least 10 \u00b5m in\nthickness, in association with diffuse chronic\ninflammation; LC was defined using a threshold\nof more than 20 intraepithelial lymphocytes per\n100 epithelial cells, with associated diffuse chronic\ninflammation, but no thickening of the subepithe-\nlial collagen band. Individuals, in whom the\nrecorded pathology diagnosis did not specify the\nsubtype of MC, were classified as `MC, not oth-\nerwise specified (MC-NOS)' as, at our centre, the\ndiagnoses of incomplete collagenous or lympho-\ncytic colitis are not used. Other investigators have\ndemonstrated that there is little interobserver\nvariability in the diagnosis of MC.20 Finally, indi-\nviduals with a previous histology report suggest-\ning a prior known diagnosis of MC were excluded\nfrom the analysis.\nData collection and synthesis\nAll potentially eligible participants were sent an\ninvitation letter, participant information leaflet,\nwritten consent form, and a questionnaire by\npost.

The study was approved by the local\nresearch ethics committee (Yorkshire & The\nHumber, Leeds West, United Kingdom) in\nDemographic data. All participants were asked to\nprovide the following demographic data: sex, age,\nethnicity, marital status, educational level, tobacco\nand alcohol use, and weight (in kg) and height (in\nm), which were used to calculate body mass index\n(BMI). We also asked participants to complete a\nchecklist of medications previously reported as\nbeing associated with MC,21 and respond to ques-\ntions regarding the presence of common associ-\nated autoimmune diseases,22 including coeliac\ndisease, thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis,\npsoriasis, autoimmune hepatitis, and type 1 dia-\nbetes. Individuals were asked to record if they\nwere given appropriate drug treatment after their\ndiagnosis, and how effective they judged it to have\nbeen using a four-point Likert scale (`very effec-\ntive', `effective', `no effect', or `made symptoms\nworse'). These data were dichotomized into two\ngroups: those with effective or very effective treat-\nment and those without.\nReference standard used to define presence of\nIBS-type symptoms.\nBecause our study was\ndesigned and commenced prior to the publication\nof the Rome IV criteria,2 the presence of IBS-type\nsymptoms was assessed via the Rome III crite-\nria.23 IBS-type symptoms were defined as present\nwhen participants reported abdominal discom-\nfort or pain occurring at least 3 days per month\nover the past 3 months, with the onset of discom-\nfort at least 6 months previously, and associated\nwith two or more of the following: an improve-\nment of pain or discomfort with the passage of\nstool, more or less frequent bowel movements, or\nlooser or firmer stools.\nMood and somatization data.\nTo assess for the\npresence of either anxiety or depression, partici-\npants were asked to complete the validated\n14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale\n(HADS) questionnaire.24 This includes seven\nquestions screening for the presence of anxiety,\nand another seven questions for depression. Each\nquestion is scored from 0 to 3, resulting in a maxi-\nmum potential score of 21 for anxiety or depres-\nsion separately. The severity of anxiety and\ndepression symptoms was then graded according\nto three categories: normal (total depression or\nIn order to assess for the presence of somatization\nwe used the Patient Health Questionnaire 15\n(PHQ-15), a validated questionnaire enquiring\nabout the presence of 15 specific somatic symp-\ntoms occurring within the previous 4 weeks.25\nThis is derived from the validated full PHQ tool,\nand has been seen to capture over 90% of physi-\ncal symptoms described in the outpatient setting.\nSymptoms were graded into three levels of sever-\nity: `not bothered at all' (scored as 0), `bothered a\nlittle' (scored as 1), or `bothered a lot' (scored as\n2), giving a total possible score of 30. The severity\nof somatization was categorized into high (total\nminimal (4) levels, as has been previously\nrecommended.\nQuality of life data.The medical outcomes study\n36-item Short Form (SF-36) score is a validated\nquestionnaire assessing both physical and mental\nhealth status,26 and was used to assess health-\nrelated quality of life. The 36 questions are\ngrouped into eight domains: physical functioning,\nrole limitations due to physical health, role limita-\ntions due to emotional health, energy or fatigue,\nemotional wellbeing, social functioning, pain, and\ngeneral health. Participants were asked to score\neach question from 0 to 100, with higher scores\nindicating more favourable quality of life.\nStatistical analysis\nWe compared baseline demographic characteris-\ntics including medication, prevalence of IBS-type\nsymptoms, HADS scores, PHQ-15 scores, SF-36\nscores, and presence or absence of anxiety,\ndepression, or somatization between subtypes of\nMC using a 2 test for categorical variables, and\none-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for con-\ntinuous data. We then compared baseline demo-\ngraphic characteristics, HADS scores, PHQ-15\nscores, SF-36 scores, and presence or absence of\nanxiety, depression, or somatization among those\nwith IBS-type symptoms and those without, again\nusing a 2 test for categorical variables and a one-\nway ANOVA for continuous data.

(Continued)\nhaving received an effective therapy for MC,\nalthough rates of IBS-type symptoms were gener-\nally higher among those patients who reported\nthat prescribed therapy was either ineffective or\nmade their symptoms worse.\nThis study surveyed a large population of patients\nwith a histological diagnosis of MC, and recruited\nonly individuals accessing secondary care ser-\nvices, rather than patients with more complex\nconditions referred for a tertiary care opinion. As\na result, these data are likely to be representative\nof, and generalizable to, usual clinical practice. A\nfurther novel aspect is that this study was con-\nducted in the United Kingdom, a geographical\nregion from where epidemiological data concern-\ning MC are sparse. In addition, we report data\nfrom a large MC cohort and examine the impact\nof IBS-type symptoms on levels of anxiety,\ndepression, somatization, and health-related\nquality of life in both male and female patients\nwith MC, using validated questionnaires.\nWeaknesses of this study include the fact that we\nused the Rome III criteria for IBS,23 which have\nnow been superseded by the Rome IV criteria,2\nbut this was unavoidable as our study was designed\nand commenced before the publication of the\nRome IV criteria. In addition, we included indi-\nviduals diagnosed with MC from 2010 onwards,\nand therefore recall bias may have affected the\nreporting of medication use and some of the other\ndata we collected. However, the validated symp-\ntom and mood questionnaires we used do require\ncontemporaneous answers. Data were not availa-\nble regarding the results of investigations to\nexclude other causes of IBS-type symptoms,\nwhere these were requested. This means we can-\nnot exclude the possibility that some individuals\nwho reported these symptoms had an organic\nexplanation, such as small intestinal bacterial\novergrowth or bile salt malabsorption, both of\nwhich may present with symptoms that can be\nconfused with diarrhoea-predominant IBS.28\u00ad30\nParticipants in the study responded to a postal\nJS Kane, AJ Irvine et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 9\nquestionnaire. This may have introduced volun-\nteer bias, where those choosing to take part were\nintrinsically different from those who did not\nreturn a questionnaire, and only one in three\npotential participants returned a questionnaire,\nwhich may limit generalizability. It may be that\nthose with more severe symptoms, low mood, or\npoor quality of life were more likely to return a\nquestionnaire, and this potential bias may have\ncontributed to our findings. It may also be that\npatients with MC with psychological comorbidity,\nsuch as anxiety, depression, and somatoform\nbehaviour are more likely to report GI symptoms,\nand that this explains our findings. Studies that\nalso recruit controls without psychological comor-\nbidity would be required to examine this issue.\nOur study was limited by the lack of a control\ngroup, meaning we were unable to compare the\nlevels of psychological comorbidity and impaired\nquality of life we observed. Finally, these symp-\ntoms may be a consequence of ongoing inflamma-\ntion, although there was no significant difference\nseen with respect to the reported effectiveness of\ndrug therapy received for MC between individuals\nwith and without IBS-type symptoms.\nGiven the average age of over 60 years in our study\npopulation, it may be that other comorbidities\nhave impacted on quality of life measures,\nalthough there should be no particular reason why\nthese should affect the two groups of patients,\nwith or without IBS-type symptoms, unequally.\nFurthermore, the trend towards individuals\nreporting IBS-type symptoms more frequently\nusing PPI therapy could represent an important\nconfounding factor, in terms of risk of developing\nMC. Colonic biopsy specimens were reviewed by\nseveral different GI pathologists, as this study was\nconducted in routine clinical practice, meaning\nthat interobserver variability in the diagnosis of\nMC may have been introduced into the study.\nHowever, other investigators have demonstrated\nthat there is little interobserver variability in the\ndiagnosis of MC.20 Finally, we did not collect MC\ndisease activity data using a validated tool, such as\nthe recently proposed MC disease activity index,\nas this was not available when this study was\ndesigned.31 Therefore, we cannot exclude that the\nhigh prevalence of IBS-type symptoms observed\nin this group of patients was attributable to active\nMC, particularly given the fact that a diagnosis of\nIBS can only be given after exclusion of known\nstructural causes of lower GI symptoms. This\nimplies that symptoms of MC in general, rather\nthan the fact that these are compatible with IBS,\nimpacts negatively on mental health and quality of\nlife.\nData on the impact of MC on quality of life have\ncross-sectional surveys.14,15 Of these studies, three\nused the SF-36 questionnaire in individuals with\nMC and in healthy controls matched for age and\nsex.14,17 Miehlke and colleagues, in two rand-\nomized clinical trials, reported greater impair-\nment across all domains of the SF-36 for both LC\nand CC,17 and Hjortswang and colleagues dem-\nonstrated significantly lower scores across all\ndomains except physical functioning for individu-\nals with CC.14 In terms of the impact on psycho-\nlogical health, we are not aware of any other\nstudies using the validated HADS or PHQ-15\nquestionnaires to examine for anxiety, depres-\nsion, or somatization respectively, although\nNyhlin and colleagues included an assessment of\ndisease-related worry, as part of the short health\nquestionnaire, and identified significantly higher\nlevels in those with MC compared with healthy\ncontrols.15 Furthermore, Roth and colleagues\nassessed the levels of overall psychological wellbe-\ning in female patients with MC but did not com-\npare levels with healthy controls.18\nThe prevalence of IBS-type symptoms seen in our\nstudy is very similar to that reported by a previous\nand demonstrated a pooled prevalence of 33.4%\nin 420 individuals with MC. It should be noted\nthat in this meta-analysis, only the study by Gu\nand colleagues used the Rome III criteria to define\nIBS-type symptoms, as we did, but included a\nsmaller number of individuals with MC.33 Only\none study has attempted to assess the prevalence,\nand impact, of IBS-type symptoms in MC in rela-\ntion to psychological wellbeing.18 Roth and col-\nleagues identified a higher prevalence of IBS-type\nsymptoms in MC of 55%, and demonstrated that\naffected patients also reported greater impair-\nments in psychological wellbeing, but it should be\nnoted that this was only performed in female\npatients, and the authors did not examine for the\npresence of symptoms of anxiety or depression\nUnlike in classical IBD, where faecal calprotectin\nhas been used to stratify individuals into those with\nactive or quiescent disease,13 there is no comparable\nbiomarker in MC. Previous cross-sectional studies\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11\n10 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nhave used a measure of self-reported stool frequency\nin order to define active MC.14,15 Individuals desig-\nnated as having active disease reported significantly\nimpaired quality of life compared with those in clini-\ncal remission, and patients felt to be in remission\nhad similar quality of life scores to healthy con-\ntrols.14,15 However, neither of these studies exam-\nined the role of potential concurrent IBS in the\nincluded individuals, and given that approximately\n50\u00ad60% of individuals were classified as having\nactive disease based on stool frequency alone, some\nof these may have met criteria for IBS. Interestingly,\nNyhlin and colleagues reported that even those with\nMC in clinical remission were more likely to\ndescribe ongoing symptoms of abdominal pain,\nnocturnal diarrhoea, arthralgia, and myalgia despite\nan improvement in bowel frequency,15 suggesting\nthat some individuals could either have been\nwrongly classified as being in remission, or may\nhave had concomitant IBS-type symptoms or soma-\ntoform-type behaviour.\nTherefore, although it is challenging to distin-\nguish whether individuals with MC meeting cri-\nteria for IBS have symptoms due to active MC or\ntrue concomitant IBS-type symptoms, there\nappears to be a distinct subset of individuals who\nexperience persistent, troublesome symptoms\nmore than 12 months after diagnosis and treat-\nment of MC. With this in mind, it is interesting\nto note that among those who received effective\ntherapy for MC, although rates of IBS-type\nsymptoms were generally lower, mood and qual-\nity of life scores were no better than among those\nwho reported their therapy as being ineffective or\nhaving made their symptoms worse. The rela-\ntively low rates of patients (51%) who reported\nreceiving treatment for their MC in this study\nprobably relates to two issues. First, in the UK,\nmany patients over the age of 50 years with a\nchange in bowel habit towards looser stools are\nreferred for urgent colonoscopy on a suspected\nlower GI cancer pathway. They usually have ran-\ndom colonic biopsies taken, but if they do not\nhave colorectal cancer they are discharged from\nfollow up back to their primary care physician.\nSecond, it is our clinical experience that many\npatients with MC who are prescribed a drug\nimplicated in the aetiology of the condition will\nrespond to withdrawal of the drug, and not need\na specific treatment for MC. Overall, this sug-\ngests that even among patients with MC who\nmay be in clinical remission, almost one in three\nwill still report IBS-type symptoms, and this\nimpacts on psychological health and quality of\nlife. The aetiology of symptoms other than diar-\nrhoea, such as abdominal pain, in patients with\nMC is not clear but could relate to underlying\nactive inflammation, as well as previous low-\ngrade inflammation leading to altered neuromus-\ncular function, as has been seen in postinfectious\nIBS,35 diverticular disease,36 and even in inactive\nIBD.37 It is also interesting to note that we did\nnot detect any association between evidence of\nmacroscopic inflammation at the index colonos-\ncopy, and presence of IBS-type symptoms.\nStrategies to identify and treat the underlying\ncause of these symptoms may have significant\nimplications for reducing healthcare-related costs\nin patients with MC. Furthermore, the finding\nthat approximately 40% of individuals had either\nborderline or abnormal levels of anxiety, and\n20% had borderline or abnormal levels of depres-\nsion, suggests that drugs that act on the gut\u00adbrain\naxis or psychological therapies, which are benefi-\ncial in functional GI disorders,38,39 may be help-\nful in this group of individuals with MC.\nIn summary, one third of patients with MC\nreported IBS-type symptoms. Whether this is due\nto ongoing inflammation is unclear, although this\nwas the case even among those whose symptoms\nof MC had been well controlled by drug therapy.\nFurther research is required to determine the\nrelationship between MC and IBS-type symp-\ntoms, especially in terms of identifying methods\nto distinguish symptoms of genuine IBS from\nthose of MC at the time of initial presentation, as\nwell as those related to recurrent active MC, or\npotential coexistent functional GI problems,\nwhich may require alternative treatment strate-\ngies. This could include the use of scoring sys-\ntems to identify patients with diarrhoea who are\nmore likely to have MC rather than IBS,3,4 and\nwho therefore need expedited colonoscopy to\nobtain random colonic biopsies, disease activity\ntools,31 or novel biomarkers. Furthermore,\nwhether MC impacts negatively on patients' lives\nin other ways, as seen with the debilitating fatigue\ndescribed in the other inflammatory bowel dis-\neases,40,41 requires investigation in the future.\n"
