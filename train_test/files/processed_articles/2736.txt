Educational\nquality and the relative returns to a\nbaccalaureate degree for minorities\nin China\nSai Ding1*, Samuel L. Myers Jr2 and Gregory N.

This paper offers a unique perspective by\nexamining the effects of affirmative action on ethnic minority earnings in China. There\nare 55 ethnic minority groups in China that constitute approximately 9% of the popu-\nlation. Despite post-1978 reform efforts to modernize the economy, most evidence\nsuggests that ethnic minorities lag behind the Han majority in educational attainment\n(Myers et al. 2013). In her consideration of how educational attainment in China is\nstratified by ethnicity, Hannum (2002) indicates that one reason why an ethnic minor-\nity relative to Han majority educational attainment disparity exists may be due to eth-\nnic minority groups perceiving that the tangible returns to education may be low. Of\ncourse, to the extent that there is ethnic minority discrimination in China's labor mar-\nin human capital, then relative to the Han majority, members of China's 55 officially\nrecognized ethnic groups would have an incentive to invest less in human capital.

International Journal of Anthropology and Ethnology (2017) 1:3\nredress these educational disparities, China initiated deliberate affirmative action pol-\nicies designed to reduce ethnic economic inequality (Mishra and Smyth 2010; Zang\n2008). Some argue, however, that these policies have the unintended effect of reducing\noptimal investment in human capital and thus thwart efforts to reduce Han-Minority\ndisparities in education and earnings. This is similar to arguments often made for the\npoor educational outcomes for African Americans in the face of affirmative action in\nThe challenge to understanding how or whether affirmative action retards or en-\nhances ethnic disparities in China is that relative disadvantange or ethnic minorities\nmanifests itself in multiple forms. There are disadvantages in education completion\nand Ding 2009a), and in living standards (Gustafsson and Ding 2009b). With respect to\n(2001) find evidence of minority-Han majority differentials that is suggestive of dis-\ncrimination against minorities in the post-reform era.\nAnother challenge to understanding the effects of affirmative action in China is that\nquality of institutions vary substantially from one province to another. Most of the top\nuniversities in China are located in Beijing and Shanghai, the largest cities in the na-\ntion.1 But, regional universities as well as Minzu (minority) Universities are often the\ndestination for students with lower test scores. Thus, there is a sorting mechanism pro-\nduced by affirmative action in a nation where there is a single criterion for admission\nto college: the national test score.2 The primary route for implementation of affirmative\naction in higher education in China is via additional points awarded to ethnic minority\ngroup members on their Gao Kao scores.3\nGao Kao (The National College Entrance Examination) is organized by the Ministry\nof Education of the People's Republic of China. Beijing, Shanghai and the other thirteen\nprovinces, howver, use their own examination questions.4 The Gao Kao scores are al-\nmost the only evidence universities use to matriculate students. The Chinese govern-\nment ranks colleges and universities and have identified the \"top\" or very good\ninstituions as well as the next tier of (or good) institutions both for receipt of funding\nand for national recognition. These top insittuions are identified as \"985\" program and\n\"211\" program universities.5 The admissions standards at these top program univer-\nsities nationwide always are higher than the admissions for other, often regional\ninstituions. For example, Beijing University \u00ad sometimes called the Harvard of China \u00ad\ndesignated the minimum admission score for science students from Yunnan Province\nminority area of southwest China and has both a minority university (Yunnan Minzu\nUniversity, formerly Yunnan University for Nationalities) and a conventional although\nnot highly ranked regional institution, Yunnan University. The designated minimum\nadmission scores for science students from Yunnan in 2015 was only 530 at Yunnan\nUniversity and 489 at Yunnan Minzu University.6\nOfficially recognized members of ethnic minority groups can receive from five to up\nto 50 extra points on their Gao Kao scores. The extra points awarwded vary from prov-\nince to province and not every province awards points for all 55 ethnic minority\ngroups. For example, Inner Mongolia \u00ad an ethnic minority autonomous region domi-\nnated by the ethnic minority group, Mongolians \u00ad only awards extra points to Mongo-\nlian, Daur, Oroqen, Evenki and Russ students. Other minority students are not eligible\nfor the additional points.\nIn short, China has a very explicit form of affirmative action that acts as a point sys-\ntem similar to the price premia and point systems often struck down as unconstitu-\ntional in the United States. Embedded in the system is the potential for alleged\n\"mismatch\" since minority students with say 650 initial scores might matriculate at top\nuniversities where they are in the lower tier of their peers or they might matriculate at\nregional universitis where they would be at the very top of their classes. In this sense,\nthen, China is a good test for the mismatch hypothesis as well as the view that affirma-\ntive action reduces investment in human capital and reduces relative earnings of\nminorities.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II the data and empir-\nical methodology are discussed. Our econometric strategy for identifying the relative\nminority to Han majority returns to 4 years of college views the receipt of a baccalaur-\neate degree as a heterogeneous treatment with selection. In particular we view being a\nminority with a baccalaureate degree in China as a source of heterogeneous outcomes\nin the labor market. We report parameter estimates in section III, and the last section\nconcludes.\nMethods\nAs in Heckman and Li (2004), we consider a potential outcomes specification of a\nMincerian earnings equation of the form lnYi\n= i\nSi\n+ Xi\n+ Ui\n, where Yi\nis a measure\nof earnings, Si\n= 1 for individuals with a baccalaureate degree and Si\n= 0 if an individual\nis a high school graduate, i\nis the heterogeneous return to education, Xi\nis a vector of\nconditioning variables with effects given by the vector , and Ui\nis an error term. Given\nthe two potential outcomes lnYi\n= Si\n, Ui\n= Si\n, and\nindividuals select going to college or not according to S\u00c3\ni\n= f(Z), Si\ni\nS\u00c3\ni\nis a latent variable capturing the net benefit of an individual earning a baccalaureate\ndegree, and Z is a vector of variables that determine S\u00c3\ni\n.\nGiven the treatment Si\n, three treatment effects can be defined and estimated: 1.) The\nAverage Treatment Effect (ATE), 2.) The Average Treatment Effect on the Treated\n(ATET), and 3.) The Average Treatment Effect on the Non-Treated (ATENT). For Si\nATE measures the treatment effect for a randomly selected member of the population\nand ATET measures the treatment effect for those who actually received the treatment.\nATENT measures the treatment effect on those who did not receive the treatment had\nthey in fact received the treatment.7 If there is selection into treatment and treatment ef-\nfects are heterogeneous such that individual characteristics in Xi\ncondition outcomes,\nthen in general ATE  ATE(Xi\nThe treatment effect of interest in this paper measures the causal effect of an individ-\nual's decision to earn a baccalaureate degree within the Rubin Causal Model (RCM)\nframework (Holland 1986). In the RCM framework, a treatment effect is defined for\neach individual in terms of two potential outcomes. Each individual has one outcome\nthat would manifest if exposed to the treatment of earning a baccalaureate degree from\na Chinese college/university of a given quality, and another outcome if were exposed to\nthe control of not having earned a baccalaureate degree at all. The treatment effect is\nthe difference between these two potential outcomes. Given evidence of heterogeneity\nin the returns to education in Asia (Tsai and Xie 2011), our heterogeneous treatment\neffect estimates enable better identification of the returns to education when there is\nselection on both observables and unobservables that are specific to ethnicity. In this\ncontext, our estimates of the relevant treatment effect constitutes an evaluation of edu-\ncational policies in China that aim to enhance college/university access for minorities,\nas well as informing the labor market rate of return on an earned baccalaureate degree\nconditional upon the quality of the college/university.\nIndividual Income, Consumption and Employment Data, as it enables estimation of\nearnings equations in the large Chinese urban labor market.9 The 2002 CHIPS was\ndesigned and implemented to measure and estimate the distribution of personal\nincome and related economic factors in both rural and urban areas of the People's\nRepublic of China. The measures of earnings are based on cash payments and on a\nbroad range of additional components. The Urban Individual Income, Consumption\nand Employment Data provides standard demographic variables such as the individual's\nethnicity, as well as economic variables such as medical insurance and expenditures,\neconomically productive social contacts, and employment information including occu-\npation, sector, income, hours, conditions, job history, and training. All data were\ncollected through a series of questionnaire-based interviews conducted in rural and\nWhile there are several waves of CHIPS, which would enable larger estimation sam-\nples, we constrain our analysis to the 2002 CHIPS as it permits an identification strat-\negy not possible otherwise.10 Given that individual schooling choices are potentially\ncorrelated with unobservables, unbiased parameter estimation with selection on unob-\nservables requires an instrument and exclusion restriction on a covariate that is uncor-\nrelated with individual unobservables. The 2002 CHIPS contains a covariate, not\npresent in other sample years of CHIPS, that enables identification in the presence of\nselection on unobservables. In particular, the 2002 CHIPS identifies whether or not an\nindividual respondent was an \"intellectual youth\" meaning the respondent moved to\nthe rural areas during the Cultural Revolution.\nOur interest in the intellectual youth variable stems from its utility as in input into a\nsensible identification strategy. Li and Zax (2003) suggest that Chinese workers who\nwere rusticated in their youth and sent to rural areas during the Cultural Revolution\nsuffered in both the quality and the quantity of their education. As our inquiry explores\nthe effects of minority group status on both the returns and returns by quality of a bac-\ncalaureate degree, that being an intellectual youth can condition schooling decisions\nenables identification of baccalaureate degree treatment effects.. To the extent that\nmoving to rural areas during the Cultural Revolution is plausibly unrelated to labor\nsupply preferences as Li and Zax (2003) posit, it is likely to be uncorrelated with unob-\nservables such as ability that is related to individual schooling investment decisions. As\nsuch, having been an intellectual youth can serve as an exclusion restriction for identi-\nfying the returns to schooling when there are both observables and unobservables that\ngovern selection into college.\nOur strategy to determine if the returns to a baccalaureate degree are different\nbetween minorities and the Han majority is to determine if ethnicity is a source\nof heterogeneity in the labor market returns to a baccalaureate degree. The same\nstrategy is adopted for the returns to a baccalaureate degree given the quality of\nthe college/university from which the degree was earned. We specify and estimate\na Mincerian earnings equation where Yi\n= annual earnings, and the elements of Xi\ninclude, years of labor market experience, a binary indicator for being male, a bin-\nary indicator for being a member of the communist party, a binary indicator for\nbeing employed in the manufacturing sector, a binary indicator for being\nemployed in a state-owned enterprise.11 To control for earnings differences due to\nethnic minority educational stratification by geography (Hannum and Meiyan\n2006), we also include binary controls for the 11 different provinces respondents\nreported in the 2002 CHIPS. We consider three treatments (Si\n): Graduated from\ncollege, Graduated from a college ranked very good, and Graduated from a college\nranked good. All covariates are derived from relevant questions from the Urban\nIndividual Income, Consumption and Employment Data in the 2002 CHIPS, for\nwhich a summary is reported in Table 1.\nTable 1 Covariate summary\nVariable Mean Standard deviation Number of observations\nSource: 2002 Chinese Household Income Project Series\naAnnual earnings (Yuan) is defined as Total income less the sum of bonuses, allowance/subsidies, price subsidies,\nlocal subsidies, living hardship subsidies, and subsidies for minimum living standard\nbBinary/dichotomous indicator\nResults and Discussion\nTable 2 reports the relevant treatment effects. High School graduates are the control\ngroup. The results in the first column assume no selection into a homogeneous treat-\nment and are based on an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) specification of lnYi\n. The sec-\nond column assumes selection into a homogeneous treatment. The last three columns\nassume selection into a heterogeneous treatment, where the heterogeneity is condi-\ntioned on whether on not an individual is a member of ethnic group.12 Given that the\nATE is no longer a singleton when there is heterogeneity and selection in treatment\noutcomes, we report the ATE, ATET and ATENT when conditioning on an individual's\nminority status. With the exception of the treatment parameter estimates with hetero-\ngeneity conditioned on minority status reported in the last three columns, the specifi-\ncations are estimated with the person-level weights.\nAs the decision to attend college is potentially correlated with unobservables, we in-\nstrument our measure of college graduation with a binary variable indicating whether\nor not the respondent was an \"intellectual youth\" meaning the respondent moved to\nthe rural areas during the Cultural Revolution. In particular, we use the intellectual\nyouth binary variable as an exclusion restriction in a Heckit two-step estimator of treat-\nall the Heckit IV heterogeneous treatment specifications to estimate the standard errors\nfor the treatment effects.14\nTable 2 The returns to a baccalaureate degree for minorities in China treatment effect parameter\nestimates\nATE\nATE\n(Heckit)\nATE\n(Heckit|Minority)\nATET\n(Heckit|Minority)\nATENT\n(Heckit|Minority)\nTreatment effect:\nOutcome: Log of annual\nearnings\nControl group: high school\ngraduates\nTreatment:\nGraduated from college:\n(Rank = very good)\nGraduated from college:\n(Rank = Good)\nStandard errors in parentheses\naSignificant at the .01 level\nbSignificant at the .05 level\nGiven our interest in the treatment effect of having a college degree in China and\nhow it may vary according to minority group status, for sake of economy and brevity in\nthe exposition of results, the parameter estimates in Table 2 omit the estimated signs\non the control covariates summarized in Table 1, in addition to the estimated parame-\nters of the relevant selection into the relevant treatment specification. Beijing was ex-\ncluded from the provincial dummies, enabling the 10 remaining provinces to identify\nthe wage/earnings effects of being in a particular province relative to Beijing. We do re-\nport the estimated parameter for the minority indicator variable, and where relevant,\nthe estimated parameter on the selection correction term . In total, the results in\nTable 2 follow from the estimated parameters of 15 regression, all of which except for\nthe OLS results in the first column include a first-stage IV regression which being an\nintellectual youth is the instrument in the selection into treatment regression\u00adwhich is\nexcluded from the specification determining earnings.\nThe simple Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) ATE results in the first column suggest\nthat for both ethnic minorities and the Han-majority, the labor market returns to a bac-\ncalaureate degree are substantial, and increase with the quality of the college/university\ngranting the degree. As the return is relative to high school, the annual return is the es-\ntimated treatment effect--which is the change in annual earnings divided by the as-\nsumed 4 years spent earning a baccalaureate degree. The annual return for just having\na baccalaureate degree is approximately 10.6%, and this increases to approximately\n11.3% and for graduating from a college/university ranked very good and good respect-\nively. These estimates are approximately similar to those reported by Heckman and Li\n(2004), and provide further evidence of the hight returns to education in post-reform\nera Chinese labor markets.\nGiven selection into treatment, the ATE results in the second column reveal that for\ngraduating from a college with a ranking of very good, the labor market returns to a\nbaccalaureate degree are higher than estimated by simple OLS--which suggests that\nsimple OLS estimates can be downwardly biased.15 The annual return for just having a\nbaccalaureate degree is approximately 8%, and this increases to approximately 17.8 and\n11.4% for graduating from a college/university ranked very good and good respectively.\nThe pattern of the selection-adjusted ATE estimate is similar to the OLS estimate, as\nthe labor market return to a baccalaureate degree is increasing in the quality of the col-\nlege/university from which the degree was earned.\nThe last three columns report selection-adjusted treatment effects allowing the labor\nmarket return for a baccalaureate degree to be conditioned on minority status. In par-\nticular, these parameter estimates allow for heterogeneity in the returns to a baccalaur-\neate degree by allowing individuals a unique return that is a function of whether or not\nthey are a minority. The ATE estimates reveal that for ethnic minorities, the labor mar-\nket returns to a baccalaureate degree are lower, as for all three treatments, relative to\nthe ATE estimates under homogeneity, minority status is associated with a higher ATE.\nFor ethnic minorities, the annual return for just having a baccalaureate degree is ap-\nproximately 9.9% for minorities. However this increases to approximately 20.1 and\n13.3% for graduating from a college/university ranked very good and good respectively.\nFor Chinese minorities actually receiving the treatment, the ATET results in column 4\nare only significantly different from zero, in the case of a college/university ranked\ngood. This suggests that relative to the Han majority that received the treatments, the\nreturns to a baccalaureate degree are higher for minorities who graduate from a col-\nlege/university ranked good.\nAs ATE = ATET \u00d7 Prob(S = 1) + ATENT \u00d7 Prob(S = 0), that the ATET is only signifi-\ncantly different from zero in the case of graduating from a college ranked good for all\nthree treatments when conditioning on minority status provides insight into why rela-\ntive to the Han majority, the ATET is no different in the case of graduating from col-\nlege and graduating from a college ranked very good. The ATENT, which is not\nstatistically significant for minorities for all three measures of earning a baccalaureate\ndegree, is the labor market return the control group--minority high school gradua-\ntes--would realize had they earned a baccalaureate degree. This suggests that one rea-\nson why the ATET conditioned on minority status is insignificant is not significant for\nall three measures is that colleges/universities have not fully exploited a pipeline of mi-\nnority students who could earn and benefit from a baccalaureate degree. Indeed, to the\nextent that the ATENT is an increasing function of the number of high school gradu-\nates, the zero ATETs associated with earning a baccalaureate degree in general, and\nfrom a college/university ranked very good in particular for minorities could reflect a\nconstrained supply of minority high school graduates that feed into China's colleges/\nuniversities overall.\nThe estimated sign on the selection terms is never significant for the parameter esti-\nmates in columns 2 - 5. This suggests that in general, the treatment of attending college\nis not endogenous, even when the returns are heterogeneous across ethnic groups in\nChina. As the results do show that the returns are conditioned on minority status, one\nimplication is that even if attending college is not endogenous, and correlated with in-\ndividual unobservables, failure to control for heterogeneity due to minority group sta-\ntus could lead to biased estimates of the return to college in China as the OLS results\nin column 1 suggest.\nThe minority group status indicator is also never significant in the earnings equation.\nThis suggests that being an ethnic minority is not a source of wage/earnings discrimin-\nation in China's urban labor markets. This runs counter to evidence of discrimination\nagainst urban minorities in China found by Ding et al. (2012) based on separate earn-\nings specifications by gender. However, as the minority-specific treatment effects of\nhaving a college degree are always positive and significant, this suggests that minorities\nin China possibly offset wage/earnings discrimination through high educational invest-\nment relative to the Han majority (Wu 2012).\nSummary and conclusions\nPost-reform China educational policy has implemented an aggressive affirmative action\ncollege admissions policy for minorities (Zang 2008). This paper considers the extent\nto which such a policy has been effective, and if conditional on college/university qual-\nity, the labor market returns to a baccalaureate degree varies by ethnicity in China.16\nOur inquiry permits an assessment as to how effective post-reform efforts have been at\neradicating ethnic inequality through enhancing access to higher education. To the ex-\ntent that the transition to a more market-oriented society increases the responsiveness\nof earnings to the quality of human capital (Zhong 2011; Li et al. 2012), our consider-\nation of educational quality permits insight into whether or not in China, there is a\nlabor market return to college/university quality (Long 2008, 2010), and if it differs be-\ntween minorities and the Han majority.\nWe have used data from the 2002 Chinese Household Income Project Series (CHIPS)\nto estimate the labor market returns to graduating from college relative to high school.\nWe allow for selection and heterogeneous returns by ethnicity, and estimate three treat-\nment parameters that enable identification of the returns to a baccalaureate degree for mi-\nnorities in China, and how it varies by the quality of the institution awarding the degree.\nWe estimated three treatment parameters that enable identification of the returns to\na baccalaureate degree for minorities in China, and how it varies by the quality of the\ninstitution awarding the baccalaureate degree. Consistment with heterogeneity in the\nreturns to education (Henderson et al. 2011) our estimate of treatment effects reveal\nthat for minorities, the average treatment effect of earning a baccalaureate degree from\ncolleges/universities ranked good and very good is high relative to the Han majority,\nand for those actually receiving the treatment from colleges/universities ranked good,\nand would be positive for those who could have earned a baccalaureate degree from\ncolleges/universities ranked good and very good, but did not. Our results suggest that\npost-reform affirmative action education policies in China have been effective at im-\nproving the education and labor market outcomes of minorities. Estimates of the aver-\nage treatment effect on the non-treated suggests that existing minority-Han disparities\ncan be eliminated by further expanding the pipeline of minorities that complete high\nschool and enter into colleges/universities that grant baccalaureate degrees.\nOur results provide a useful alternative context for evaluating affirmative action in col-\nlege/university admissions in the USA. We find, for example, that the relative return for\nminorities graduating from ranked universities is higher, and would also be for those who\ncould have attended, but did not. This suggests that proponents of the mismatch hypoth-\nesis in the USA--the idea that at least some minority students who attend elite institu-\ntions in the USA would be better off in non-elite institutions--could be wrong. Our\nfindings raise the possibility that, as in China, the relative returns to graduating from an\nelite university could be higher for minority groups in the USA, and that affirmative ac-\ntion in college/university admissions should be expanded so as to facilitate convergence in\nthe returns to a baccalaureate degree between minority and majority groups.\nOur inquiry provides a research perspective on how ethnicity and inequality intersect\nwith public policy in China that can potentially inform how policy can address raced-\nbased educational disparities elsewhere. In the USA, affirmative action in higher\neducation has been controversial, with the presumed benefits and efficacy becoming in-\ncreasingly questioned on empirical (Arcidiacono et al. 2011) and theoretical grounds\n(Fryer and Loury 2005). The results reported here provide some insight on how deliber-\nate affirmative action policies in universities admissions can increase the return to col-\nlege graduation in a country--China--that has a history of minority relative to majority\nethnic group disparities in educational outcomes similar to the USA.\nThere are at least two limitations of our analysis. First, our results are based on a\ncross section of China's labor market in 2002. Since that time, the Chinese economy\nhas grown substantially, and it is possible that in response to such growth, the pipeline\nof minorities into colleges/universities and the labor market has been enhanced in such\na way the labor market returns on a baccalaureate degree for minorities has converged\nto that of the Han majority. As such, our findings could just be a transitory snapshot of\na labor market that no longer exists. Second, our identification strategy imposes an ex-\nclusion restriction based on whether or not a respondent moved to the rural country-\nside during the cultural revolution. While the assumption that this instrument is\nuncorrelated with unobservables is untestable, the extent to which it is a good instru-\nment could affect our Heckit estimates of the treatment effects. However, in all the\nHeckit estimates, the intellectual youth variable was negatively correlated with each\nmeasure of having earned a baccalaureate degree. This suggests that having moved to\nthe countryside during the cultural revolution is correlated with observable schooling\nchoices--earning a baccalaureate degree--that is not likely dependent upon unobserv-\nable preferences for schooling investment decisions.\nThe central contribution, however, of this paper is that it reveals the weakness in the\nso-called \"mismatch hypothesis\" underlying affirmative action. The mismatch hypoth-\nesis posits that a policy regime of affirmative action in college/university admissions in-\ncreases the likelihood that a minority student is matched to a school that does not\noptimize her chances for success (Arcidiacono et al. 2011). Our results suggest that, at\nleast in China, ethnic minority students admitted to colleges/universities under a policy\nregime of affirmative action fare better in the labor market relative to majority ethnic\ngroups when earning a baccalaureate degree from high quality colleges/universities.\nThis finding underscores a conceptual weakness in the mismatch contention and af-\nfirms that affirmative action in college/university admissions can be an effective policy\ntool to redress/remedy historic discrimination against minority groups.\nEndnotes\n1Some top Minzu Universities are also located in the largest cities, such as Beijing\n(Minzu University of China), Wuhan (South-Central University for Nationalities) and\nChengdu (Southwest University for Nationalities) http://gkcx.eol.cn/soudaxue/quer\nyschool.html?&keyWord1=&schoolprop=&province=&1=1\n2Ministry of Education, the People's Republic of China. 1990.

(2008).\n11While political variables are not typically included in Mincerian earnings equations,\nwe include a dichotomous indicator of Communist Party membership as there is\nevidence that it appears to matter for earnings in China (Li et al. 2007).\n12Our parameterization of the heterogeneous treatment effects with selection into\nthe treatment follow that of Cerulli (Cerruli 2014), where for outcome y and\ntreatment w: E(y  x, z, s) = o\n+ w + xo\n+ w(x - x\nw[(z)/(z)] +\no\n(1 - w)[z)/1 - (z)], where o\nis the ATE, s is the binary college graduation\ntreatment, z is a vector of variables determining selection into treatment,  is the\nvector of coefficients for z, and () and () are the density and cumulative\nnormal distribution respectively.

While IVTREATREG provides alternatives to Heckit to estimate treat-\nment effects when the treatment is endogenous, Heckit permits estimation when both\nthe binary treatment choices and outcomes depend upon a linear combination of both\nobservable and unobservable factors.\n14For the heterogeneous treatment specifications, we could not estimate the parame-\nters with the household weights as STATA does not enable the use of sampling weights\nwith bootstrapped standard errors. However, to the extent that bootstrapped standard\nerrors enable consistent estimation of parameters given misspecification (Goncalves\nand White 2005)--in this the omission of sampling weights--bootstrap estimates of the\ntreatment effects without the sampling weights can mitigate/eliminate the bias caused\nby the sample that may not be fully representative of the population of interest.\n15Card (1999) posits that OLS estimates of the labor market returns to schooling are\ndownwardly biased as a result of individuals with high discount rates choosing low\nlevels of schooling, which have a higher marginal rate of return.\ndesire of the Communist Party to promote inter-ethnic peace and political stability.\nWith respect to college admissions, relative to the Han majority, minority students are\nadmitted into colleges/universities with lower admission test scores.
