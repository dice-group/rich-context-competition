Aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiin-\nflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)have been shown experimen-\ntally to inhibit chemically induced esophageal cancers.\nUnited States followed for 6 years found that aspirin use\nwas associated with a reduced risk of death from esopha-\ngeal cancer.\nMethods. The relation of aspirin use and esophageal\ncancer was examined using data from the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 1)\nand the National Epidemiologic Follow-up Studies\n(NEFS).Of the 14,407United States residents followed for\nwere classified as nonusers, occasional users, or regular\nusers of aspirin based on their response to two questions\nat the baseline examination: whether they had taken as-\npirin in the past 30 days and whether they had used pain\nmedications regularly during the prior 6 months.\nResults. Occasional use was associated with a 90%\nveloping esophageal cancer,and no person classified as a\nregular user developed the disease. Adjusting for ciga-\nrette smoking (ever vs. never) and alcohol intake (at least\nmonthly vs. not)did not explain the finding.\nConclusion. Aspirin use was associated with a 90%\ndecreased risk of developing esophageal carcinoma.

In all, 21.9% of the cohort were\nAspirin and EsophagealCancer/Funkhouser and Sharp 1117\nPatient Definition\nPatients were persons whose first cancer diagnosis, at\nleast 1 year after baseline, was esophageal cancer (In-\nternational Classificationof Diseases code 150).Fifteen\nsubjects were diagnosed w:ithesophageal cancer, all of\nwhom had died by the time of the 1987 follow-up\nstudy.\nAspirin Data\nAt the baseline examination, persons were asked\nwhether they had taken aspirin in the past 30 days, and\nif so, the number of days previous to the examination\nthat they had taken it. Baseline aspirin data were avail-\ntients. Subjects were also queried briefly at baseline\nconcerning use of medications for headaches and other\npains during the previous 6 months. Subjects were\nasked whether they used pain medicationsnever, occa-\nsionally, or regularly. This information was available\nfor all but six members of the cohort and for all of the\npatients. Subjectswere not asked specificallywhat pain\nmedicationsthey used or how much or how often they\nused these medications.\nPotential Confounders\nDemographic information ;aboutage, race, and sex was\nascertained at the baseline examination for all subjects,\nas was data on alcoholconsumption. Information about\nsmoking habits was obtained for about one-fourth of\nthe subjects at baseline and for nearly three-fourths\nabout smoking habits was available for 69.5% of the\ncohort and for 93.3% of tlhe patients. Information on\nalcoholconsumption was available for 99.8% of the co-\nhort and for all of the patie:nts.\nData Analysis\nIncidence rates were estimated according to whether\nsubjectsreported any use of aspirin in the month before\nthe baselineinterview and whether or not they reported\nregular use of pain medications during the 6 months\nbefore baseline. Esophageal cancer rates for subjects\nwith three different levels of aspirin exposure were\ncompared with rates for nonusers of aspirin. We classi-\nfied subjects as nonusers if they reported no use of as-\npirin in the month before b,aselineand no regular use of\npain medications during the previous 6-month period.\nWe classified subjects as occasional users of aspirin if\nthey said they used aspirin in the month before baseline\nbut reported no regular use of pain medications during\nthe previous 6 months. We classifiedsubjectsas regular\nusers of aspirin if they reported both using aspirinin the\nmonth before baseline and regularly using pain medi-\ncations during the previous 6 months. We used infor-\nmation about subjects' general use of pain medications\nin classifying subjects as regular aspirin users because\naspirin accounted for about three-quarters of the adult,\nnonsinus analgesicssold over the counter in the United\nStates at the time of the baseline e~amination.'~\nTo as-\nsess the categorization of regular and occasionalaspirin\nuse, we looked at the number of days before the base-\nline examination that the subjects had taken aspirin:\n82%of regular users and 56% of occasional users had\ntaken aspirin within the past 3 days.\nPerson-time was defined as the time from date of\nbaseline examination to date of diagnosis for patients\nand to last date known alivefor the cohort. Person-time\nfor patients ranged from 3 to 13 years, and, for the co-\nhort, from 1to 16years. Stratifiedanalysis and Poisson\nregressionwere used to estimaterate ratios, adjusted for\nage, race, and gender, for various levels of aspirin use.\nWe also used Poisson regression to assess confounding\neffects of alcohol consumption (at least monthly versus\nnot) and cigarette smoking (ever versus never smoked\nregularly). Subjectswith missing values were excluded.\nWhen there were no patients in the exposure category,\nthe upper bound of an exact 95% confidence interval\nwas calculated using the BIN20M software routine.l4\nAll other analyses were performed using the SASstatis-\nResults\nDemographics of the patients differedfrom those of the\nentirecohort.

Presented in Table 2 are rate ratio estimates\nfrom Poisson regression; they were virtually identicalto\nthose from stratifiedanalysis. Compared with nonusers\nof aspirin, occasional, mixed (occasional and regular),\nand regular users of aspirin, all had strong decreased\nrisks of developing esophageal cancer. The association\nwas similarfor mixed and occasionalusers, but stronger\nfor regular users, though the latter was not statistically\nsignificant. As shown in Table 2, adjusting rate ratios\nfor alcohol use and smoking, in addition to age, race,\nand sex, strengthened all rate ratio estimates.

These were identical to the incidence\nrate ratios, an expected finding because all the patients\nhad died.\nDiscussion\nWe found that aspirin use was associated with a sub-\nstantially decreased risk of developingesophageal car-\ncinoma. We found a relation between the amount of\naspirin consumed and the risk of esophageal cancer,\nwith risks lowest for regular users of aspirin.\nA limitation of the present study is that it is based\non a relativelysmallcohort,which yielded a smallnum-\nber of patients. However, in spite of the small number\nreduction in the incidence of esophageal cancer for as-\npirin users. Our findingsare consistentwith those from\nthe Cancer Prevention Study 11, the only previous epi-\ndemiologicstudy that investigatedthe relation of aspi-\nrin use to esophageal cancer.' Those investigators re-\nported a 40% lowermortalityrate from esophagealcan-\ncer among subjects who reported using aspirin 16 or\nmore times per month comparedwith never usersand a\n20%lowermortalityrate among subjects who reported\nusing aspirin 1-15 timesper month.' Our study, aswith\nmost follow-up studies assessing the development of\ncancer,undoubtedly has considerable censoringon the\noutcome of interest. However, we do have a substan-\ntially longer follow-up than the Cancer Prevention\nmeans less censoring.\nTheprimary difficultyin studyingthe relation of as-\npirin use to esophageal cancer is obtaining an accurate\nmeasure of use before tumor induction. This is espe-\ncially a problem in case-controlstudiesbecause the dis-\nease process may change aspirin consumption, and\nthus, may affect the aspirin use reported by patients.\nHowever, this differential misclassification of aspirin\nuse should not be a problem in the current study be-\ncause of its cohortdesignand because we excluded any\npatient diagnosed within 1 year of the baseline in-\nterview.Theearliestdiagnosisof the remainingpatients\nwas 3 years after baseline examination.\nAlthoughthere should be no differentialbias in the\nway subjects reported their aspirin use, there may still\nbe misclassilication.It is reasonableto assume that per-\nsons who used aspirin regularly would report using as-\npirin in the past month; however, the converse is not\ntrue. To address this problem, we also analyzed sub-\njects' general use of pain medications during the 6\nmonths before the baseline interview. Our combined\nmeasures of aspirin and of general pain medication use\nallowed subjects to be divided into fairly broad group-\nings as nonusers, occasional, mixed, and regular users\nof aspirin, classificationsthat should be reasonably ac-\nTable 2.

Thisassessment of accuracy\nis supported by the high percentage of regular users\n(82%) having taken aspirin within the past three days\ncompared with a lower percentage (56%)of occasional\nusers.\nSubjects may have changed their aspirin use after\nthe baseline interview; however, this is unlikely to be a\nproblem in the present study for the followingreasons.\nHalf of the patients were diagnosed within 8 years after\nthe baseline interview, three-fourths within 11 years,\nand because the latency period for esophageal cancer is\nlikely to exceed 11years, the majority of patients in this\nstudy shouldhave had tumors that were induced before\nthe baseline interview. Thus, even if the aspirin use of\nthe subjects changed over time, this study is based on\nthose measures of aspirin use most relevant to the etiol-\nogy of esophageal cancer.\nIt is possible that confounding could contribute to\nthe associationsreported here, but it seemsunlikely that\nconfounding could account for the consistent and\nstrong associations that we report. The two strongest\nrisk factors for esophageal cancer are alcohol consump-\ntion and cigarette smoking. Although we were able to\nadjust only crudelyfor these confounders, these adjust-\nments either had no effect on rate ratio estimates or\nstrengthened them.\nWorldwide, esophageal cancer is the seventh most\ncommon cancer,with especiallyhigh incidencerates re-\nported in regions of Brazil, France, China, Japan, and\nthe former Soviet Of cancer deaths in the\nUnited States, esophageal ranks fourth in importance\nfor African American males and ninth for White\nnew cases will occur, and 10,900persons will die from\nthe disease.19This is one of the most fatal of all cancers\nin the US.with only 5.9% of African American males\nand 7.5% of White males surviving more than 5 years\nafter diagnosis.\nAspirin and related NSAIDS may have some po-\ntential to inhibit either squamouscarcinomasof the up-\nper esophagus or adenocaiccinomaof the distal esopha-\ngus, which previous studies indicate may have different\netiologies.*\"Our results support further studies to de-\ntermine whether aspirin is protective against both of\nthese forms of esophageal cancer. Such studies could\nlead to clinicaltrialsto determine whether aspirin might\nbe used in high risk groups, such as patients with Bar-\nrett's syndrome, to prevent this rapidly fatal cancer, a\ndisease for which treatment is generally only palliative.\nReferences\n1.
