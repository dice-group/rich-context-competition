Guided by the transtheoretical model of health behavior change, this study sought to explain why (a) rates\nof advance care planning remain low in the general population and (b) surrogate decision makers are often inaccurate\nabout patients' end-of-life preferences.\nMethods. The study used quantitative data from a cross-sectional internet survey conducted between July and October\nincluded members of a nationally representative internet panel and a convenience sample from online advertisements.\nResults. Older age was associated with a greater likelihood of having executed a living will and/or appointed a durable\npower of attorney for health care. Both older age and poorer health were independently associated with a greater likeli-\nhood of having discussed end-of-life health care treatment preferences. Completion of one's own end-of-life planning\nwas unrelated to one's ability to accurately report one's partner's treatment preferences.\nDiscussion. Readiness to plan for end of life appears to differ across planning behaviors. Age and health are related\nto aspects of one's own advance care planning, but none of these factors are related to accuracy as a partner's surrogate.\nKey Words: Advance care planning--Death and dying--Dyadic data--Medical decision making.\nTerminally ill patients experience the burden of\nincapacitating symptoms such that 30% of decedents\nrequire treatment decisions they are no longer able to make\n(Silveira, Kim, & Langa, 2010). U.S. states' statutes pro-\nvide for advance directives (ADs), mechanisms that allow\npatients to articulate their future medical treatment pref-\nerences while still competent. Specifically, a living will\ndetails the specific treatments a person would or would\nnot want if in a certain health condition, and a durable\npower of attorney for health care (DPAHC) is a surrogate\npermitted to make medical decisions on behalf of an inca-\npacitated patient. ADs are associated with decreased symp-\ntom burden and improved communication between health\ncare professionals and patients' families at the end of life\n(Teno, Gruneir, Schwartz, Nanda, & Wetle, 2007). In add-\nition to ADs, individuals can also make informal plans.\nPatients' discussions with family and physicians are not\nlegally binding, but discussions with physicians do result\nin care that is more consistent with patients' wishes than\nis the care of persons who do not hold discussions (Mack,\nWeeks, Wright, Block, & Prigerson, 2010). Together, ADs\nand informal discussions are known as advanced care\nplanning (ACP).\nDespite the documented efficacy of ACP, research also\nhighlights its limitations, including low rates of AD com-\npletion in the general population, restrictions on who may\nserve as a DPAHC, ADs that are missing signatures and\nnotarization, DPAHCs' difficulty in determining what care\nthe patient would choose for him or herself, inaccessibil-\nity of ADs at the time of treatment decisions, and more\n(Castillo et al., 2011). These problems have persisted for\nover two decades, despite measures such as Congressional\nlegislation requiring that hospitals offer ACP assistance to\npatients (Emanuel, Weinberg, Gonin, Hummel, & Emanuel,\n1993). Recently, end-of-life scholars have begun to turn\nto theories of health behavior change from other areas of\nstudy to gain leverage over the problems (Fried, Bullock,\nIannone, & O'Leary, 2009). Thus, this study applies the\ntranstheoretical model (TTM) of health behavior change\nto guide thinking on two of the most pressing of these\nproblems: (a) encouraging people to complete end-of-life\nplanning well in advance of incapacitating illness and (b)\nfostering DPAHC accuracy.\nThe study addresses these issues in a national sample\nCouples are the focus because ACP is a distinctly family-\nbased process. Among married older persons who have\nappointed a DPAHC, three quarters have appointed their\nspouse; most states designate the spouse as the surrogate\ndecision maker if the patient has not appointed a DPAHC;\nand conversations about end-of-life care typically happen\nbetween spouses (Carr & Khodyakov, 2007). Persons aged\n18\u00ad64 are the focus because ACP done only at the end of\nlife is often deemed \"too late\" to be helpful or meaningful;\nthus, it is important to begin the process when one is a\nworking-age adult (Sudore & Fried, 2010).\nTTM of Health Behavior Change\nThe TTM was developed as a framework to explain\nhuman health behavior change by integrating the strengths\nof the major schools of psychotherapy, including psychoa-\nnalysis, cognitive-behavior approaches, person-centered\ntherapy, and more (Prochaska & Norcross, 1999). The\nTTM was intended to be generalizable to a wide range of\nbehaviors including those outside of a mental health context\nand has been applied to over 50 behaviors (e.g., smoking\ncessation, medication adherence, and breast cancer screen-\ning; Prochaska, 2008). The TTM posits that people will be\nunprepared to make any change so long as they lack motiva-\ntion for decision making (e.g., in the absence of an immedi-\nate health threat) and guides scholars and practitioners to\nconsider patients' level of motivation and degree of readi-\nness to change.\nThe specific constructs of the model that address motiva-\ntion and readiness are the stages of change, which describe\nhow individuals move from having no intention to change\n(precontemplation), to considering change (contempla-\ntion), committing to change in the near future (preparation),\ncompleting change (action), and sustaining change (main-\ntenance). The process advances as patients' assessments of\nthe ratio of the costs of change to the benefits of change,\nor decisional balance, shift (Prochaska, 2008). Health\ncare professionals encourage shifts in decisional balance\nthrough use of the processes of change, activities such as\nconsciousness-raising and self-evaluation that motivate and\nprepare people to change. Processes of change must be tai-\nlored to the individual's stage of change in order to be effec-\ntive; processes that help a \"preparer\" toward change may\nhave no effect on a \"precontemplator.\"\nSeveral scholars have used the TTM to guide their studies\nof ACP, conceiving of discussion, AD completion, and AD\nrevision as a set of preventive health behaviors that should\noccur repeatedly over time (Fried et al., 2009). One's deci-\nsional balance must shift such that one recognizes and\nvalues the benefits of planning enough to undertake the psy-\nchological stress of spending time considering one's own\ndeath and dying. These scholars conclude that beginning\nACP well in advance of health crises helps to ensure that\nby the time one requires terminal care, one is prepared and\nOne Persistent Problem: Rates of ACP\nIn line with the TTM's postulate that health threats\nmotivate people to change their health behavior, research\nshows that efforts to increase rates of ACP have been very\nsuccessful among high-risk groups. Among nursing home\nresidents, for instance, 70% have an AD (Resnick, Schuur,\nHeineman, Stone, & Weissman, 2009). Yet, rates of end-\nof-life planning remain low in the general population, in\nwhich only a third of all adults aged 18 and older have ADs\n(Pollack, Morhaim, & Williams, 2010). Interestingly, older\npersons are more likely to have made funeral plans than\nto have prepared for their future care needs (Pinquart &\nSome scholars assert that low rates of ACP in the gen-\neral population are not troubling, because care preferences\nchange over the life course (Ditto, Jacobson, Smucker,\nDanks, & Fagerlin, 2006). Planning may even prevent\npatients from receiving care congruent with their wishes if\nhealth care providers and family members rely on out-of-\ndate plans. The TTM counters this argument in two ways.\nFirst, the TTM is a process model. People cannot quickly\nand easily move from precontemplation to action; it is\nnot optimal to wait to think about care options until they\nare needed. ACP will be more effective and less stressful\nwhen people begin the process long before they require\ncare. Second, a case in which a person created plans but\ndid not periodically update them would be considered\nrelapse under the TTM. In the maintenance stage, posi-\ntive health behaviors are sustained (Prochaska & Norcross,\n1999). ACP need not occur as regularly as a health behav-\nior such as exercise, but it does require occasional review\nand revision.\nTwo primary influences on ACP in the general popula-\ntion are age and health status. Multiple studies have docu-\nmented that the older one's age, the more likely one is to\nhave an AD (Pollack et al., 2010). The most frequent rea-\nson older adults give for not having plans is that they are\n\"too healthy,\" and the most common reason they give for\nhaving plans is a medical condition (Pollack et al., 2010;\nDrawing a distinction between age and health as\ninfluences on individuals' decisional balance is important\nin the TTM: Interventions to increase rates of end-of-life\nplanning may fail if they do not use appropriate processes\nof change to target specific barriers to planning (Prochaska,\n2008). Prior studies have conflated age and health status by\ntaking one of three approaches: (a) limiting participants to\nolder persons; (b) recruiting participants from health care\nsettings; or (c) approaching the problem via prospect theory.\nProspect theory states that options, or prospects, are more\neasily differentiated the closer they are to one's present\nreference point (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Thus, an\nill and/or elderly person will rank poor health states on a\ncontinuum of more to less acceptable, whereas a young and/\nor healthy person will not distinguish, instead wanting to\navoid all negative health states similarly (Winter & Parker,\n2007). Using the prospect theory approach, the operational\nfactor is neither age nor health alone, but rather a subjective\nblending of the two that results in an evaluation based on\nthe expected time until end of life.\nThis article compares the applicability of the TTM and\nprospect theory to the action stage, completion of vari-\nous ACP behaviors. The TTM would posit that age and\nhealth operate independently with relation to ACP, whereas\nprospect theory suggests that age and health interact in their\neffects on ACP. Thus, we ask the research question:\nResearch Question 1: What are the relationships among\nhealth status, age, and completion of ADs and informal dis-\ncussions?\nThe statistical models further account for race, socio-\neconomic status, marital status, and gender, factors that\nhave been shown to be correlated with both self-reported\nhealth and the propensity to complete ACP. Non-White per-\nsons, persons with low educational attainment and income,\nunmarried persons, and women report lower self-reported\nhealth than their peers (McGee, Liao, Cao, & Cooper,\n1999). White persons, persons of high socioeconomic sta-\ntus, and married persons are most likely to have ADs (Carr\n& Khodyakov, 2007). Men are most likely to have ADs,\nwhereas women are most likely to have held informal dis-\nA Second Persistent Problem: Surrogate Accuracy\nA second major concern about ACP is the frequency with\nwhich DPAHCs do not know the incapacitated patient's\npreferences. The legal standard for decision making is that\nof substituted judgment, whereby the DPAHC chooses the\ntreatment the patient would have chosen for him or herself\nif competent to do so (Sabatino, 2010). Numerous studies\nusing hypothetical decision-making scenarios match partic-\nipants' preferences against surrogates' reports of those pref-\nerences. Together, these studies indicate that surrogates are\nno better than chance at correctly identifying one another's\npreferences (Shalowitz, Garrett-Mayer, & Wendler, 2006).\nThus far, researchers have been unable to identify many\nalterable factors that enhance surrogate accuracy. One\nstudy indicates that pairs do better when both surrogate and\npatient are African American rather than White (Schmid,\nAllen, Haley, & DeCoster, 2010). Another found that\nspouses are more accurate surrogates than are adult chil-\ndren (Parks et al., 2011). But men and women are equally\npoor surrogates, the surrogates of persons in poor health are\nno more likely to be accurate than the surrogates of persons\nin good health, and most disturbingly, discussions between\npatient and partner have no effect on surrogate accuracy\nstrongest predictor of surrogate accuracy is the surrogate's\npreference for his or her own care (Moorman et al., 2009).\nThat is, surrogates appear to experience cognitive biases\nwherein they project their own preferences onto the patient\neither because they fail at perspective taking or because\nthey truly believe the patient to be similar to themselves\nThe TTM has not yet been applied to research on sur-\nrogate accuracy. But it may serve as a helpful conceptual\ntool in this area of research, because studies using the TTM\nto examine ACP have reached varying empirical conclu-\nsions. Sudore and colleagues (2008) found that discussion\nwas a part of the contemplation and preparation stages and\npreceded AD completion. But Fried and colleagues (2010)\nfound that living will execution, DPAHC appointment, and\ndiscussion each constituted the action stage of separate pro-\ncesses. For example, a patient could have executed a living\nwill but still have no intention to discuss it with family or\nphysicians.\nThe TTM posits that people can plan for themselves only\nwhen they are ready and prepared. Applying this proposi-\ntion to surrogate accuracy suggests that only surrogates\nwho are ready and prepared are able to fully empathize\nwith patients' preferences, because only then will they have\nthe decisional balance required to overcome the difficulty\nof thinking about a loved one's death and dying. Thus,\nthis study separates those with the most positive attitudes\ntoward planning, \"actors\" who have completed their own\nACP, from persons who have no plans and thus some degree\nof uncertainty about planning. Finding that a surrogate's\nown ACP completion is associated with his or her accuracy\nas a surrogate would be evidence that ACP behaviors build\nupon one another in a single process, as Sudore and col-\nleagues (2008) found. Finding that a surrogate's own ACP\nis unassociated with his or her accuracy would indicate that\nACP behaviors are the culmination of separate preparation\nprocesses, as Fried and colleagues (2010) found. Thus, we\nask the research question:\nResearch Question 2: Is the existence of one's own end-of-life\nplans related to the accuracy of one's reports of a partner's\ntreatment preference?\nThe statistical models further account for surrogate's\ntreatment preference, age, race, socioeconomic status,\nand gender, the couple's relationship duration and marital\nstatus, and the self-reported health of both partners. Prior\nresearch has yielded few measures reliably associated with\nsurrogate accuracy, but these factors seem likely candidates.\nFor instance, couples who are legally married and have\nbeen together a long time may have more motivation and\nmore opportunity to know their partner's preferences than\ncohabiting and new couples.\nMethod\nData\nWe used data from an internet survey conducted by\nKnowledge Networks, in conjunction with the National\nCenter for Family and Marriage Research at Bowling\nGreen State University, between July and October of 2010.\nThis cross-sectional study included a sample of 2,150\nmarried or cohabiting heterosexual couples residing in the\nUnited States. Seventy percent of the couples were married\nand 30% were cohabiting.\nIn 1999, Knowledge Networks used probability-based\nsampling methodology to establish the first online research\npanel (KnowledgePanel; www.knowledgepanel.com/) that is\nrepresentative of the U.S. population. Panel members agreed\nto participate in multiple surveys over time in exchange for\n\"incentive points\" redeemable for cash. If the panel members\ndid not have access to the Internet, Knowledge Networks pro-\nvided the necessary equipment free of charge. The couples in\nthisstudywereprimarilyrecruitedfromtheKnowledgePanel.\nAll married couples were panelists. Of cohabiting couples, a\nthird were panelists. To be counted as a valid response, both\npartners had to complete a valid survey. Recruitment within\nthe panel yielded a 50% response from married couples and\na 41% response from cohabiting couples.\nAdditional two sources were used to generate the remain-\nder of the sample of cohabiting couples: 10% of cohabiting\ncouples comprised a KnowledgePanel member and partner\nwho was not on the panel and 57% of cohabiting couples\ncomprised two partners recruited through online adver-\ntisements (i.e., a non-probability sample). Recruitment of\npanel members and their off-panel partners yielded only a\n5% response rate. Response rates are not calculable for con-\nvenience samples; so, response to the web advertisement is\nunknown. Supplementary analyses indicated that the results\nof this study were similar for cohabiting couples regardless\nof means of recruitment. Therefore, the three groups were\npooled in the analyses presented here.\nAD Completion\nAD completion was assessed based on the following\ntwo questions: \"Have you made any legal arrangements\nfor someone to make decisions about your medical care\nif you become unable to make those decisions yourself?\nThis is sometimes called a durable power of attorney for\nhealth care\" and \"Do you have a living will or advance\ndirective? These are written instructions about the type of\nmedical treatment you would want to receive if you were\nunconscious or somehow unable to communicate.\" The\nAD variable had two mutually exclusive categories: has an\nAD (living will and/or DPAHC) and has no formal plans\n(neither living will nor DPAHC).\nParticipants without an AD were provided with eight\nclosed-ended responses and asked to endorse as many rea-\nsons as applied for having no AD. Responses were aggre-\ngated into four codes. The category \"Lacking information\"\nincluded \"I did not know this measure existed,\" \"I do not\nknow how to go about doing this,\" and \"I do not believe\nthis measure affects treatment.\" The category \"Death avoid-\nance\" included \"I have not thought about my treatment\npreferences\" and \"I do not want to think about dying and\nillness.\" The category \"Other persons\" included \"My pref-\nerences are already known to others\" and \"I do not want\nto burden anyone with this responsibility.\" Finally, the cat-\negory \"Current good health\" included \"My health is cur-\nrently good.\" Participants were tallied in all categories in\nwhich they endorsed at least one reason.\nInformal Discussion\nInformal discussion is a dichotomous variable based on\nthe following question: \"Have you discussed with anyone\nplans about the types of medical treatment you want or\ndon't want if you become seriously ill in the future?\" Those\nwho had had a discussion were coded as 1 and those who\nhad not were coded as 0. Participants who had not had a\ndiscussion responded why, using the same procedure and\nquestions as for participants who had no AD, above.\nSurrogate Accuracy\nParticipants were told \"We have some questions about the\nkind of decisions you might make when considering your\nown health at the end of life. Suppose you had a serious ill-\nness today with very low chances of survival. What if you\nwere mentally intact, but in severe and constant physical\npain? Please select the number that best represents the level\nof treatment you would like.\" Participants answered using\na scale ranging from 0 (stop all life-prolonging treatment)\nto 10 (continue all treatment). Intermediate anchors were\nnot labeled and represented degrees of response for persons\nwho would prefer a more or less aggressive course of care,\nhaving some treatments and forgoing others. Then, partici-\npants were asked \"Now please think about your spouse or\npartner. Suppose your spouse/partner had a serious illness\ntoday with very low chances of survival. What if s/he were\nmentally intact, but in severe and constant physical pain?\nPlease select the number that best represents the level of\ntreatment s/he would like.\" The participants then selected\nthe number between 0 and 10 that they felt best represented\nthe level of treatment their partner would like.\nWe constructed two outcome variables matching one\npartner's report of the other's preference against the other\npartner's actual preference for self. One variable subtracted\neach male partner's actual preferences from his female\npartner's report of his preference, and the other subtracted\neach female partner's actual preferences from her male\npartner's report. Therefore, a score of 0 represented accuracy,\nwhereaspositivescoresindicatedanerrorofovertreatment--a\nsurrogate believing that the other wanted more care than he\nor she indicated wanting--and negative scores indicated an\nerror of undertreatment--a surrogate believing that the other\nwanted less care than he or she indicated wanting. These\nvariables had few extreme values: Only 6.1% of women and\n4.3% of men made a full 10-point error. Thus, the variables\nwere made categorical as follows: under by 3 or more,\nunder by 1\u00ad2, accurate, over by 1\u00ad2, and over by 3 or more.\nSupplemental analyses indicated that the results are similar\nunder alternate categorizations (e.g., using seven categories;\nclassifying 1-unit of difference as \"accurate\").\nAge and Self-Reported Health\nThe key independent variables of interest for the\nfirst research question were participants' age and their\nself-reported health status. Age was a continuous variable\nwhich ranged from 18 to 64 years. Perceived health sta-\ntus was derived from the following question: \"In general,\nwould you say your health is excellent, very good, good,\nfair, or poor?\" The data showed skew; 88.0% of participants\nreported that their health was excellent, very good, or good.\nTherefore, the variable was dichotomized such that fair and\npoor were coded as 1, and good, very good, and excellent\nare coded as 0.\nFor the second research question, age and health status\nwere treated as couple-level characteristics. The older part-\nner's age entered into regressions. The reference category\nfor health comprised men in good, very good, or excel-\nlent health (i.e., healthy) partnered with women in good,\nvery good, or excellent health. The remaining categories\nincluded men in fair or poor health (i.e., unhealthy) part-\nnered with healthy women, unhealthy women partnered\nwith healthy men, and couples in which both partners were\nunhealthy.\nIndividual Sociodemographic Characteristics\nIndividual sociodemographic characteristics included\neducation, race/ethnicity, and gender. Education was a vari-\nable with three categories: high school or less (reference\ncategory), some college education, and bachelor's degree or\nhigher. Race/ethnicity had four categories: White non-His-\npanic (reference category), Black non-Hispanic, Hispanic,\nand other. The \"other\" category included the 39 respond-\nents who reported belonging to two or more racial catego-\nries. Female was a dichotomous variable where women are\ncoded as 1 and men formed the reference category.\nCouple Sociodemographic Characteristics\nSociodemographic characteristics of the couple included\nmarital status, relationship duration, and household income.\nFor marital status, categories included cohabiting and mar-\nried (reference). Relationship duration referred to the num-\nber of years the couple had been dating. Annual household\nincome was an ordinal variable with 19 categories; the\nsmallest category was \"less than $5,000,\" and the largest\nAnalytic Strategy\nFirst, the proportion of participants having each type\nof plan was calculated, along with the reasons non-plan-\nners gave for lacking plans. Average treatment prefer-\nences for self and partner and the proportion accurate\nwere calculated. Then, the research question on health,\nage, and individual planning was tested through a\nsequence of binary logistic regression models compar-\ning persons with plans to persons without. The unit of\nanalysis was individuals; to adjust for within-couple\ncorrelations, results were corrected for the clustering of\nthe first model included age, health status, marital status,\nincome, educational attainment, race/ethnicity, and gen-\nder as independent variables. The second model added\nthe interaction of age and health. Regression models\nexcluded reasons for not planning because participants\ncould report multiple reasons.\nThe research question on couple concordance was tested\nthrough two separate multinomial logistic regression mod-\nels, one for women performing as surrogates and one for\nmen performing as surrogates. Independent variables\nincluded the planning status of both partners, the treatment\npreference, educational attainment, and race/ethnicity of\nthe partner performing as surrogate, and the couple's mari-\ntal status, relationship duration, and household income.\nAll analyses were weighted to render the sample rep-\nresentative of the U.S. population of heterosexual married\nand cohabiting adults. Most cases had complete data on\nthe measures of interest. Income was the variable missing\nthe most observations, at 44 (2%) cases. Listwise deletion\nwas used.\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nFew of these working-aged adults had planned for end of\nlife. Only 28% had an AD (i.e., living will and/or DPAHC).\nSlightly over half (55%) reported having discussed their\nend-of-life treatment preferences with another person. The\npredominant reason participants gave for having no ACP\nwas death avoidance (e.g., \"I do not want to think about\ndying and illness\"). The average participant's treatment\npreference was moderate: On a scale ranging from 0 (stop\nall life-prolonging treatment) through 10 (continue all\nthe same scale, the average participant thought that their\nApproximately a third of men and women were accurate\nabout their partner's preference, with no significant\ndifferences between men and women. Descriptive statistics\non all variables used in the analysis has been given in\nHealth Status, Age, and ACP\nRegression results for the first research question are pre-\nsented in Table 2. Age was associated with completion of\nADs. A 1-year increase in age was associated with a 4%\nincrease in the odds of having an AD (p < .001). Self-\nreported health status was not significantly associated with\nAD completion. In Model 2, age and health status did not\nhave a statistically significant interactive relationship to AD\ncompletion.\nBoth age and self-reported health were significantly\nassociated with the odds of having held a discussion. An\nadditional year of age was associated with a 3% increase\nin the odds of having a discussion (p < .001). Persons in\nfair or poor health had 85% greater odds of having had a\ndiscussion than persons in good, very good, or excellent\nhealth (p < .01). In Model 2, the interaction of age and\nhealth was not significant.\nOther control variables, including marital status and race/\nethnicity, were significantly related to ACP. These results\nare explored elsewhere (Carr, 2012) and are consistent with\nprior literature.\nSurrogate Accuracy\nRegression results for the second research question are\npresented in Table 3. One's own planning had little to do\nwith one's ability to correctly report one's partner's prefer-\nences. Having one's own AD decreased the odds of making\na small error of overtreatment (OR = 0.39, p < .05); other-\nwise, no comparisons were statistically significant. There\nwere no statistically significant gender differences; that is,\nmen's planning status was also unrelated to their accuracy\nin reporting women's preferences. Therefore, results for\nmen are not shown, but are available upon request.\nDiscussion\nThis internet survey study of 1,075 heterosexual married\nor cohabiting couple dyads aged 18\u00ad64 revealed two impor-\ntant findings about end-of-life planning in the United States.\nFirst, age and health appear to have independent relation-\nships to both formal and informal aspects of ACP, in line\nwith the TTM. Second, one's own readiness to plan does\nnot render one ready to perform as a surrogate for one's\npartner; an individual's completion of ACP was unrelated\nto the accuracy of one's proxy reports of partners' treatment\npreferences. These results indicate potential new directions\nfor public health campaigns related to ACP.\nAge, Health, and Stages of Change\nThe findings in this study confirm those of other recent\nresearch and expand upon them by using the framing prin-\nreached the action stage with regard to AD completion;\nthis figure is similar to the 34% reported in a representative\nsample of Maryland residents aged 18 and older (Pollack\net al., 2010). Over half (55%) had discussed their care pref-\nerences with someone.\nAs in prior studies, age was a strong predictor of ACP,\nwith older adults more likely to have both ADs and discus-\nsions (Pollack et al., 2010). Poorer health status was related\nto increased likelihood of discussions but not related to\nAD completion, and there was no interactive association\nbetween age and health status for any ACP behavior. These\nresults are evidence in support of the TTM, which stresses\nthe importance of disentangling potential influences on\nbehavior. These results do not support prospect theory,\nwhich suggests that age and health interact in their effects\nTable 1.

Three of the four reasons for not planning offered\nin this study--lacking information, wish to avoid thinking\nabout death, and current good health--seem indicative of\nthe precontemplation stage of change in which people do not\neven consider planning. The processes of change most effec-\ntive for moving persons beyond precontemplation include\nconsciousness-raising, dramatic relief, and environmental\nevaluation. Practical factual information (i.e., consciousness-\nraising) about why ACP is important and how it is done is\nlikely to appeal to pre-contemplators. However, informational\ninterventions may fail if they do not also include emotional\nmaterial or raise empathy (i.e., dramatic relief and environ-\nmental evaluation). Qualitative research indicates that adults\nidentify concern for self or others and stories, experiences,\nand anecdotal evidence as the major influences on their plan-\nning behavior (Levi, Dellasega, Whitehead, & Green, 2010).\nPerspectives on Surrogate Decision Making\nBased on the TTM model of stages of change, this study\nasked whether completion of one's own ACP might result\nin enhanced ability to understand one's partner's treatment\npreferences. However, completion of one's own ACP was\nunrelated to accuracy at reporting one's partner's preferences.\nAlthough Sudore and colleagues (2008) found that commu-\nnication was a precursor to the action stage of completing\nADs, Fried and colleagues (2010) found that ACP behaviors\nwere independent. The present results lend some support to\nFried and colleagues' conclusion: Being in the action stage\nwith regard to one's own plans appears unrelated to one's\nstage of preparation to serve as a surrogate decision maker.\nIn the search for factors related to surrogate accuracy, null\nresults are mounting: Discussion does not help surrogates\nbetter understand specific preferences (Ditto et al., 2001),\nnor does a surrogate's own experience of ill health help with\nperspective taking (Moorman et al., 2009). Perhaps a more\nattainable standard than substituted judgment could both\nprotect patient autonomy and ensure quality care (Sabatino,\nLimitations\nThis study is limited in several important respects.

In the general population, African Americans are\nunderrepresented among married couples and overrepre-\nsented among cohabiting couples (U.S. Census Bureau,\ndyads, fewer African Americans appear than would appear\nin a general population sample. Further, the couples in this\nstudy were heterosexual. The results cannot be generalized\nto gay or lesbian adults.\nSecond, self-reported health was the only measure of\nhealth. Other studies indicate that a relationship between\nhealth and ACP is evident for other measures of health\nresearch might further compare the TTM with prospect\ntheory when examining the relationships between perceived\nand objective health status with regard to the stages of ACP.\nThird, this study cannot make full use of the TTM\nbecause it measured only some constructs. Non-planners\nwere not asked about the potential benefits of planning; so,\nno measure of decisional balance was available. Thus, par-\nticipants in the action stage were easily identified, but the\nstages of other participants could not be determined.\nTable 3.

Typically, researchers\noperationalize the stages of change across a 6-month time\nhorizon, where precontemplators do not intend to change\ntheir behavior in the next 6 months, but contemplators intend\nto change within 6 months, and preparers, 1 month (Finnell\net al., 2011). This study has neither measures of intentions\nnor follow-up measures of actual decisions.\nConclusion\nThis study joins the recent wave of interest in applying\nTTM of health behavior change as a framework for thinking\nabout ACP. Because preferences for care take shape over\ntime, the aspects of the TTM that treat behavior change as a\nprocess are well suited to the ACP context. Future use of the\nTTM may allow scholars and practitioners to design new\nmethods of helping patients to prepare for their own death\nand dying, as well as that of close others.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National Center for Family & Marriage\nResearch at Bowling Green State University; the Boston College Institute\nS.M.M.].
