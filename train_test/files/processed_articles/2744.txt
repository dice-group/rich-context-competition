California students also reported less at-school in-\ntake of vitamins and minerals. All at-school differences\nin nutrient intake were null after adjusting for total ca-\nloric intake; California students consumed a lower pro-\nportion of their daily calories in school (21.5%) than stu-\ndents in other states (28.4%). Mean overall intake was\nlower in California for most measures that were ana-\nlyzed, particularly added sugars.\nConclusions: California high school students con-\nsumed lower quantities of fat, sugar, and calories in\nschool than students in states with no competitive\nfood nutrition standards, but the nutrition composi-\ntion of California students' in-school diet was similar.\nPolicy initiatives should promote competitive foods\nthat are consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for\nAmericans.\nstratedthepoornutritioncon-\ntent of foods and beverages\nsold in schools in the United\nStates.1-6 Federally reimburs-\nable school meals must abide by nutrition\nstandards set by the US Department of Ag-\nriculture, but individual foods and bever-\nages sold in vending machines, school\nstores, and cafeterias (\u00e0 la carte) have his-\ntorically been exempt from federal regula-\ntion except for restrictions on the sale of\nfoods of minimal nutrition value.7-9 Foods\nof minimal nutrition value include only a\nsmall number of specific items such as hard\ncandies, gum, and soda.

They were cautiously optimistic, though, as\nthey found that many compliant foods and beverages had\nlimited nutrition value and that at-school intake of veg-\netables declined following the legislation. Without using\nanother state as a control, it is also difficult to determine\nwhether the positive changes in California were attrib-\nutable to legislation or reflected secular trends taking place\nnationwide.\nThis study was designed to complement existing re-\nsearch on California's competitive food laws by compar-\ning nutrient intake among high school students in Cali-\nfornia vs states that do not regulate competitive food\nnutrition content, using 24-hour recall data. In addition\nto analyzing several measures of overall intake, we com-\npared intake in different locations outside school to as-\nsess whether California students compensate for school\nchanges by consuming more elsewhere.\nMETHODS\nState laws regarding the nutrition content of competitive foods\npiled as part of the Bridging the Gap research program.19 State\nlaws were compiled from the subscription-based Westlaw and\nLexis-Nexis legal research databases through primary legal re-\nsearch methods.20,21 Laws were defined to include codified state\nstatutory and administrative (ie, regulatory) laws effective as\nof September 2009. Analyses in this study are based on 9 dif-\nferent provisions--laws regarding 3 specific types of nutrition\ncontent (fat, sugar, total calories) for foods in each of 3 set-\ntings (vending machines, school stores, cafeteria [\u00e0 la carte]).\nEach state's law was 100% double-coded by 2 trained cod-\ners and verified against secondary sources to ensure complete\ncollection and coding interpretation.22-25 Laws were coded using\nan adaptation of a reliable and valid coding tool originally cre-\nated to evaluate district-level policies and further modified to\nspecifically evaluate nutrition content standards for each loca-\ntion of sale.13,26 Individual provisions were categorized as strong\nif they were required, specified an implementation plan or strat-\negy, and included language such as shall, must, and enforce.\nLaws were classified as weak if they were suggested or recom-\nmended and included language such as should, might, and try.\nCalifornia was classified as strong for all 9 provisions included\nin this study. At the high school level, California's law re-\nquired that snacks contain no more than 35% of total calories\nfrom fat, no more than 10% of total calories from saturated fat,\nno more than 35% of its total weight from naturally occurring\nand added sugars, and no more than 250 calories per item and\nthat competitive food entre\n\u00b4e items contain no more than 400\nStudent data on nutrient intake were obtained from the Na-\ntional Youth Physical Activity and Nutrition Study (NYPANS),\nconducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion.28 The NYPANS included a written survey of diet and physi-\ncal activity behaviors administered to a nationally representa-\ntive sample of 9th- through 12th-grade students as well as a\ntelephone interview with a subsample of students to collect de-\ntailed information on nutrient intake using 24-hour recall.\nagreed to participate in the written survey component. Each\nschool was invited to participate in the 24-hour recall compo-\nin these schools who were eligible for the 24-hour recall, 1229\nprovided contact information for the telephone interview. In-\nterviews were conducted in February through May 2010.\nAs part of the 24-hour recall, students provided detailed data\non food intake and location of consumption for the day prior\nto the interview. Students participated in up to 3 recalls, but\nfor the sake of consistency we used only the first weekday 24-\nhour recall for each student, unless otherwise noted. Nutrient\nintake data were compiled using Nutrition Data System for Re-\nsearch software (Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of\nMinnesota). In addition to calculating overall daily intake, we\nstratified the calculations by location of consumption--\nschool, home, and other (eg, restaurants).\nTwenty states were represented in the 24-hour recall sample.\nOurstudysamplewasrestrictedtostudentsinCalifornia(n=114)\nand 14 states with no laws for the majority of the 9 domains listed\nearlier (n=566; within-state median sample size=44.5). We spe-\ncifically focused on these states to make results more interpre-\ntable and to improve the internal validity of our analyses. Four\nstates that had a mixture of strong, weak, and no relevant laws\nwere excluded because they would create a very heterogeneous\ncomparison group that would be difficult to characterize. One\nstate other than California had strong provisions across do-\nmains, but it was excluded because it had a small sample of stu-\ndents who completed a 24-hour recall (n=12). Combining the\nother state with California would overstate the geographic scope\nof our treatment group and potentially bias results.\nGeneral linear models were used to estimate differences in av-\nerage dietary intake between students in California and states\nthat did not have laws regarding the nutrition content of com-\npetitive foods. First, we estimated differences in the following:\n(1) total caloric intake, overall and stratified by location of con-\nsumption; (2) proportions of total calories consumed in the\nforms of protein, carbohydrates, and different types of fat (satu-\nrated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated); and (3) total in-\ntake of macronutrients and micronutrients (sugars, fiber, and\nseveral vitamins and minerals). We then estimated differences\nin macronutrient and micronutrient intake, stratified by loca-\ntion of consumption, and repeated each analysis with and with-\nout adjustment for total caloric intake. Each analysis adjusted\nfor race/ethnicity, age, sex, and where students obtained their\n\u00a92012 American Medical Association.

We ex-\nplored controlling for school-level clustering but determined\nthat within-school correlation of nutrient intake was low and\nthat controlling for it could bias the estimates.\nThe California sample had a substantially higher propor-\ntion of Hispanic students than other states. We repeated the\nanalyses in Hispanic students only to determine whether nu-\ntrient intake was more favorable in California, specifically among\nthis population that tends to have higher prevalence of youth\nAs a supplementary analysis, we modeled within-student dif-\nferences between weekday and weekend intake, stratified by\nlocation of consumption, in the overall sample. The purpose\nwas to explore whether students in California compensated for\nchanges to their school environment by consuming more at\nhome or other locations during the school week, relative to stu-\ndents in states that did not govern competitive food nutrition\ncontent. A fixed-effect model was used to estimate within-\nstudent differences between weekday and weekend consump-\ntion at home and in locations outside school and home and to\ncompare these differences between California and other states.\nEach student's weekend intake effectively served as his or her\nown control and enabled us to adjust for unmeasured charac-\nteristics such as socioeconomic status. This analysis was re-\nstricted to students who completed one 24-hour recall for both\na weekday and a weekend day (n=515).\nThis study was approved by the institutional review board\nof the University of Illinois at Chicago. All statistical analyses\nwere conducted with Stata version 11 statistical software\n(StataCorp LP).\nRESULTS\nDescriptive statistics of the study sample can be found\nin Table 1. As described earlier, the California sample\nhad a greater proportion of Hispanic students (76.6%)\nthan other states included in the sample (14.7%). The\nsex and age distributions were approximately equal be-\ntween the 2 groups. All census regions were repre-\nsented in the sample of states with no competitive food\nnutrition standards, although the sample contained a rela-\ntively high proportion of students from the South (54.4%).\nAdjusted differences in mean intake between Califor-\nnia and states with no competitive food nutrition stan-\ndards are displayed in Table 2. California students con-\nto 55.5), with the difference coming largely from at-\nall, California students consumed less of almost every nu-\ntrient that we examined. When taking both effect size and\nprecision into account, the strongest evidence of lower\nintake among California students was found when ana-\nTable 1.

At school,\nCalifornia students consumed less than students in other\nstates for every measure that we examined, particularly\nadded sugars, trans fat, monounsaturated fat, sodium, po-\ntassium, iron, and vitamin B12\n. After adjusting for total\ncaloric intake, however, the at-school differences were\nsubstantially reduced. In some cases, the direction of as-\nsociation changed after adjusting for total calories, such\nthat California students consumed more of specific nu-\ntrients (eg, calcium) than students in other states. Mean\nintake from locations other than school and home was\nhigher in California for most measures; intake of fiber,\n, sodium, and iron remained higher in Cali-\nfornia after adjusting for total calories. There were vir-\ntually no differences between states in at-home intake,\nregardless of whether we adjusted for total caloric in-\ntake (results not shown).\nResults were very similar when restricting the analy-\nsis to Hispanic students (Table 4). The estimated dif-\nferences between California and other states in at-\nschool intake were slightly larger than those for the full\nsample prior to adjusting for total caloric intake. As with\nthe full sample, though, results were virtually elimi-\nnated after adjustment. The results for total intake among\nHispanic students (not shown) were also similar to the\nresults in Table 2, as Hispanic students in California con-\nsumed only 20.1% of their total calories within school.\nThe fixed-effect analysis suggested that California stu-\ndentsdidnotcompensateforconsuminglesswithinschool\nby consuming more elsewhere. We found no evidence that\nCalifornia students consumed more outside school on\nweekdays, relative to weekends, than students in other\nstates did.

Their conclusions were based on analyses of\nschool environment measures and a survey of select food\nitems administered only among California students. We\nTable 3.

Reported intake of these measures was lower in\nCalifornia in the overall sample and specifically among\nHispanic students. The reductions among Hispanic stu-\ndents are particularly encouraging given the high preva-\nlence of youth obesity among Hispanic individuals in Cali-\nfornia29 and the United States overall.30 It is also\nencouraging in light of research that documented the high\npresence of convenience stores, mobile food vendors, and\nother food outlets surrounding schools in Hispanic com-\nmunities,31,32 including one study of a predominantly His-\npanic school district in California.31 Estimated differ-\nences were in fact greater among Hispanic students than\namong the overall sample, and one could argue that the\ninternal validity of results is greater when analyzing this\nsubgroup because of the substantial racial/ethnic differ-\nences between our comparison groups.\nCalifornia students also reported lower at-school in-\ntake of several vitamins and minerals, and all differ-\nences in nutrient intake were eliminated after adjusting\nfor total caloric intake. This suggests that the nutrition\ncomposition of California students' in-school diet was\nsimilar to that of students in other states even if they con-\nsumed less. The lack of difference in overall nutrition qual-\nity is not surprising given the following: (1) California's\ncompetitive food laws limit fats, sugars, and calories but\ndo not require vegetables, whole grains, and other foods\nthat are compliant with the Dietary Guidelines for Ameri-\ncans33; and (2) Woodward-Lopez et al18 reported that\nmany California schools complied with competitive food\nlaws by offering items such as baked chips that were tech-\nnically compliant but had limited nutrition value. This\ndoes not take away from the fact that California stu-\ndents in this study consumed fewer calories in school,\nwhich suggests that competitive food standards may be\na method of reducing adolescent weight gain. Yet, to im-\nprove students' overall nutrient intake, policy makers may\nneed to promote more stringent competitive food regu-\nTable 4.

Larger studies\nhave reported similar estimates of the proportion of total\ncaloric intake that comes from at-school consump-\ntion.34,35 On average, California students consumed an\neven lower proportion of their calories at school and con-\nsequently had an only slightly lower overall intake of\nsugar, fat, and calories than students in other states. The\nfixed-effect analysis indicated that California students re-\nlied on other sources more in general, not owing to dif-\nferences in their school food environment. Regardless,\nas Woodward-Lopez et al18 and other experts36 have ar-\ngued, the low proportion of at-school intake suggests that\nschool-based policy initiatives are a starting point but must\nbe complemented with nutrition education and policy\nchanges in other sectors to improve the overall health of\nthe adolescent population.\nCalifornia may differ from other states in its educa-\ntional system and other school nutrition policies that could\naccount for differences in intake or lack thereof. This limi-\ntation is heightened by the cross-sectional design, which\nprecludes us from concluding that California's laws were\nthe cause of any differences in intake. Our study was also\nlimited by the reliance on self-reported measures; al-\nthough 24-hour recall is a common measure of diet, chil-\ndren are known to underreport their intake.37 Students\nin our study sample generally reported less intake than\nlarger studies have reported, although the distribution\nof calories between fats, carbohydrates, and proteins was\nsimilar.38 Lower intake in our study sample may also be\nattributable to self-selection bias. The 24-hour recall\nsample represented a small proportion of the full NYPANS\nsample, and students who consented to the recall may\nhave had less average consumption.\nIt should also be reiterated that the NYPANS sample\nwas not designed to represent individual states. The large\nproportion of Hispanic students in the California sample\nillustrates that the sample was not representative of Cali-\nfornia. The evidence from this study is inconclusive be-\ncause of these limitations, although there is sufficient evi-\ndence to support the development of larger studies that\ncollect nutrient intake from a more representative sample.\nFuture studies should also include data on socioeco-\nnomic status, a key covariate for which we were unable\nto control.\nOne should assess this as a study of California's spe-\ncific standards, not as a reflection of competitive food regu-\nlations in general. California's competitive food stan-\ndards are more strict than those of most states, but some\nremained lower than the standards recommended by the\nInstitute of Medicine.9 California did not regulate so-\ndium content, for example, and had a higher caloric limit\nfor individual food items (250 calories) than the limit rec-\nommended by the Institute of Medicine (200 calories).\nInterestingly, California's laws regarding sugar content\nequal to the standards set by the Institute of Medicine;\nthe relative stringency of sugar content policies may ex-\nplain why sugar intake was the dietary measure for which\nwe found the strongest evidence of lower consumption\nin California. Policy makers should look to standards set\nby the Institute of Medicine and Dietary Guidelines for\nAmericans, and consider how to incorporate policy\nchanges in other sectors, to enhance the potential for\nschool changes to improve adolescents' overall diet.\nCorrespondence: Daniel R.
