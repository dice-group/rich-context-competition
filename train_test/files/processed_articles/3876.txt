    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of an 8-week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) group\nintervention to reduce psychological distress as well as to strengthen self-esteem, resilience, and general well-being for\nindividuals living with a chronic illness and/or other health challenges. This pilot study employed a pre\u00adposttest design to\nevaluate the outcome of the intervention for individuals receiving care in a Community and Family Medicine department and\na Women's Health Centre located in an urban downtown hospital. A total of 42 patients were enrolled in the study and 35\nparticipants completed the intervention. Thirty-five of 42 enrolled participants completed the intervention. Twenty-eight\nparticipants completed the pretest and posttest assessments, which demonstrated statistically significant improvement on\nmost outcome measures, including the Center for Epidemiological Studies\u00adDepression Rating Scale (CES-D), Depression\nAnxiety Stress Scale (DASS), Affect Balance Scale (ABS), the Resilience Scale (RS), and the Five-Item World Health\nOrganization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Large effect sizes were observed for the CES-D, the ABS, and the DASS Stress\nsubscale. Observed improvements were sustained at 4 weeks posttreatment. Results are consistent with studies indicating\nthat MBCT offers promise in alleviating psychological distress for those who are seeking care in primary health care settings.\nContinued focus on how to best implement MBCT in primary health care, particularly for those with comorbid physical and\nmental health conditions, supports the World Health Organization's recommendation to integrate evidence-based mental\nhealth care within primary health care to promote equitable access to care for those most in need.\n",

Furthermore, untreated psychological distress\nand mental health problems frequently follow a chronic\ncourse (Chapman, Perry, & Strine, 2005; Monroe, Slavich,\nTorres, & Gotlib, 2007), resulting in a tremendous level of\nburden for the individual, family, community, and health\ncare system (Drake, Bond, Thornicroft, Knapp, & Goldman,\n2012).

To increase\naccess to quality mental health care for vulnerable groups,\nthe World Health Organization (WHO, World Organization\nof National Colleges, Academies, & Academic Associations\nof General Practitioners/Family Physicians, 2008) identified\nthe integration of evidence-based mental health care into pri-\nmary health care as one of the most effective approaches.\nPrimary care settings provide care where people live and\nwork, and thus support a population-based approach to care\nthat is accessible (Naylor et al., 2012) and less stigmatizing\n(Zeiss & Karlin, 2008). Evidence-based mental health inter-\nventions are ideally suited to primary care environments as\nthey are less intensive and can address the health concerns of\nindividuals with physical and/or chronic illness, as well as\nmental health challenges (Cape, Whittington, Buszewicz,\nLlopis, Barry, Hosman, & Patel, 2005; Zaretsky, Segal, &\nOne major barrier to the effective integration of evi-\ndence-based strategies in primary care is the lack of evi-\ndence regarding effective interventions to prevent and\nreduce psychological distress in the context of chronic ill-\nness (de Lusignan, Chan, Parry, Dent-Brown, & Kendrick,\nTaylor et al., 2007). To date, public health strategies to\naddress mental health problems are directed primarily\ntoward the detection, diagnosis, and medical treatment of\ndepression (Gilbody, Whitty, Grimshaw, & Thomas, 2003;\nStewart, 2008; van Weel, van Weel-Baumgarten, & van\nRijswijk, 2009). Evidence indicates that best practice for\ndepression is the combination of medication and psycho-\nlogical interventions (Parikh et al., 2009); however, evi-\ndence-based psychological treatments, such as cognitive\ntherapy or mindfulness-based approaches, are not readily\navailable in primary care (Naylor et al., 2012; Patten &\nfocused on how best to support the integration of evidence-\nbased approaches within primary care settings, as exempli-\nfied by the United Kingdom's commitment to expand access\nto psychological therapies, known as \"talking therapies\"\n(Department of Health, 2011) among the general popula-\ntion. Furthermore, Canada's Mental Health Strategy advo-\ncates for increased access to psychological therapies, as well\nas increased integration of mental health services within\nprimary care (Mental Health Commission of Canada, 2012).\nMindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT; Segal,\nWilliams, & Teasdale, 2012) is an empirically supported\nmental health intervention that is administered in a group\nformat and teaches individuals to disengage from repetitive\npatterns of negative thinking by shifting perspective from\nmindless cognitive processing to a more engaged mindful\nprocessing of experience (Segal et al., 2012). MBCT extends\nmindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR; Kabat-Zinn,\n1991) by combining mindfulness-based strategies with ele-\nments of cognitive therapy. A review of research findings\ndemonstrates that MBCT is highly effective in preventing\nrelapse for individuals who have experienced three or more\nepisodes of depression (Ma & Teasdale, 2004; Teasdale\net al., 2000). A recent meta-analysis of randomized con-\ntrolled trials (RCTs) concerning the effectiveness of mindful-\nness-based interventions, namely, MBCT and MBSR,\nextended these findings and found that MBCT is particularly\nbeneficial for people with a depressive disorder who are cur-\nrently experiencing symptoms (Strauss, Cavanagh, Oliver, &\nWhile originally developed to prevent recurrent depres-\nsion, MBCT shows promise in alleviating psychological dis-\ntress associated with chronic depression as well as a wide\nrange of illnesses (Eisendrath, Chartier, & McLane, 2008;\nFinucane & Mercer, 2006; Radford, Crane, Eames, Gold, &\nhas significantly improved psychological distress in individ-\nuals with cancer (Foley, Baillie, Huxter, Price, & Sinclaire,\n2011), Parkinson's disease (Fitzpatrick, Simpson, & Smith,\nDelgado & Latorre-Postigo, 2013), tinnitus (Philippot, Nef,\nClauw, de Romr\u00e9e, & Segal, 2011), and medically unex-\nplained symptoms (van Ravesteijn et al., 2013). An overview\nof systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs conducted\nby Gotlink et al. (2015) concerning the effectiveness of\nMBCT and MBSR for a wide range of common chronic con-\nditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic pain,\ndepression, and anxiety disorders supports the use of these\nmindfulness-based interventions to alleviate both mental and\nphysical health symptoms. Similarly, the results of a meta-\nanalytic review by Hofmann, Sawyer, Witt, and Oh (2010)\nsuggest that mindfulness-based therapy is an effective inter-\nvention for treating anxiety and mood problems in clinical\npopulations, specifically for those who had a psychological\nor physical/medical disorder. Another systematic review of\nthe literature by Crowe et al. (2016) evaluating the effective-\nness of only MBSR, and not MBCT, in improving physical\nhealth outcomes for long-term physical conditions reported\nthat most of the studies reviewed demonstrated improve-\nments in psychological symptoms.\nMcCay et al. 3\nIndeed, studies employing mindfulness-based interven-\ntions, specifically MBCT and MBSR, for patient adjustment\nto chronic illness have shown promising results. However,\ngiven the emphasis in MBCT on developing skills to cope\nwith the negative thinking patterns frequently associated\nwith a wide range of long-term health challenges and con-\ncerns, it may be that MBCT has a particular advantage in\nalleviating psychological distress experienced by individuals\nseeking care in primary care settings. To the best of our\nknowledge, few studies have been undertaken that evaluate\nthe effectiveness of MBCT for individuals with long-term\nillness and health concerns, implemented by frontline clini-\ncians in primary care settings. In two exploratory studies\nwhere MBCT was evaluated in primary care settings\noffered to participants who were either experiencing elevated\ndepression and/or anxiety, or were vulnerable to increased\ndepression and/or anxiety. Results of these preliminary stud-\nies suggest that MBCT may be effective in addressing\ndepression and anxiety in primary care settings; however,\nthese studies do not indicate whether participants were also\nexperiencing additional health challenges, such as chronic\nillness and/or other stressful life events. A randomized con-\nsupported the effect of MBCT on generalized anxiety disor-\nder among Chinese community patients in Hong Kong.\nWhile the participants were recruited by referral from doc-\ntors who worked in an Outpatient Clinic and a website avail-\nable to the general public, it is unclear where the intervention\ntook place and whether MBCT was in fact implemented\nwithin a primary care setting. Furthermore, three instructors\nwith experience in either MBSR or MBCT led the MBCT\ngroups; however, it is uncertain whether these instructors\nwere connected to existing primary care teams. The same\nlimitation is true for the study by van Ravesteijn et al. (2013),\nwhich reported on findings of an RCT to assess the cost-\neffectiveness of MBCT for a heterogeneous group of patients\nwith medically unexplained symptoms. These patients\nbelonged to the 10% most frequently attending patients of\nthe participating general practitioners. While MBCT was on\naverage shown to be more effective than enhanced usual\ncare, the MBCT trainers were not integrated into the existing\ncare team. As is evident from this review of the literature, the\nmajority of MBCT studies do not address the generalizability\nof MBCT to real world primary care settings (Kuyken et al.,\nAs such, the purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the\neffectiveness of MBCT, implemented by frontline clinicians\nwithin primary care, to improve psychological well-being for\nindividuals living with persistent illness and/or other health\nchallenges (e.g., life stressors). It was hypothesized that par-\nticipation in the MBCT intervention would reduce psycho-\nlogical distress, specifically depression and anxiety, as well\nas strengthen self-esteem, resilience, and general well-being\nfor individuals living with a chronic illness and/or other\nhealth challenges. The ultimate purpose was to provide pilot\ndata to support larger well controlled studies to increase\naccess to effective primary mental health care services.\nMethod\nThis study employed a pre\u00adposttest design. The study mea-\nsures were administered to all participants at baseline, imme-\ndiately after the completion of the intervention, and at a\n4-week follow-up.\nParticipants\nA total of 42 patients were recruited from the Department of\nCommunity and Family Medicine and from the Women's\nHealth Care Centre at an urban downtown hospital. To be\neligible, participants identified that they were experiencing\nelevated levels of psychological distress related to a chronic\nillness and/or other health challenges for 2 years or less. In\naddition, participants were older than 18 years of age, under\nthe care of a physician, as well as able to speak and under-\nstand English and provide informed consent. Eligible partici-\npants were invited to participate in the study by their primary\ncare physician at each clinic. Forty-two participants agreed\nto participate in the study. Thirty-five of the 42 participants\ncompleted the intervention with seven participants dropping\nout. Individuals reported a number of reasons for dropping\nout including scheduling conflicts and challenges engaging\nin MBCT. Of the 35 participants who completed the inter-\nvention, 28 completed both the pretest and posttest question-\nnaires.Atotal of 20 participants completed the questionnaires\nat all three time points: pretest, posttest, and at a 4-week\nfollow-up. Although 35 out of 42 participants completed the\nMBCT intervention, a number of participants were unable to\ncomplete the follow-up questionnaires at posttest (7) and at\nthe 4-week follow-up (8), due to time demands.\nTable 1 provides the demographic characteristics for\nthose participants who completed the intervention (N = 35).\nParticipants ranged in age between 23 and 71 years with a\nwere female. Most participants reported being single (40%)\nor married (31.4%). At the start of the intervention, five of\nthe 35 participants were attending school (14.3%), and\napproximately half of the sample was employed (48.6%).\nThe majority of participants did not have any children\n(74.3%), and 35% of the sample were born outside of Canada\n(e.g., Africa, China, India, Europe). Most of the participants\nspoke English at home (77.1%).\nThe majority of participants who completed the interven-\ntion identified that they were living with a chronic illness,\nsuch as diabetes, coronary artery disease, arthritis, HIV/\nAIDS, and/or physical symptoms such as chronic pain or\nhypertension (see Table 2). Virtually all participants identi-\nfied multiple health challenges including mental health chal-\nlenges, however, only primary health challenges are identified\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 2.

A number of participants (n = 9) experienced men-\ntal health challenges such as anxiety and depression in con-\njunction with chronic illness or symptoms although all\nparticipants identified elevated psychological distress, which\nwas an inclusion criteria for the study. Furthermore, a small\nnumber of participants (n = 4) identified a mental health chal-\nlenge such as anxiety, depression, or attention deficit disorder\nas their primary symptom. As well, some participants (n = 6)\nidentified coping with stressors, such as being laid off work,\nretirement, and coping with pregnancy under trying circum-\nstances as their primary health challenge. In addition, all par-\nticipants, with the exception of one, identified a range of life\nstressors such as unemployment, retirement, financial issues,\nor family challenges such as divorce, or stress pertaining to\nchildren, in conjunction with the primary health challenges\nidentified.\nProcedure\nAs identified above, participants were recruited from the\nDepartment of Community and Family Medicine Program\nand from the Women's Health Care Centre at a downtown\nurban hospital in Toronto. Prior to conducting the study, eth-\nics approval was obtained from the appropriate research eth-\nics boards.

Prior to the start of the study, informed consent\nwas obtained from the study participants. The intervention\nwas conducted by two social workers employed within the\nDepartment of Family and Community Medicine and at the\nWoman's Health Care Centre who possess a depth of knowl-\nedge and clinical experience in mindfulness and cognitive-\nbehavioral strategies, including personal experience with\nmeditation. The intervention was conducted in a local com-\nmunity setting affiliated with a downtown Toronto hospital.\nMeasures\nThe study questionnaires were selected in accordance with\nthe study purpose and hypothesis to assess mental health\nchallenges and strengths for the participants, and have sound\npsychometric properties. Relevant sociodemographic char-\nacteristics were included to provide a comprehensive\ndescription of the sample.\nAffect Balance Scale (ABS).The ABS is a 10-item scale that\ncontains five statements reflecting positive feelings and five\nstatements reflecting negative feelings (Bradburn, 1969).\nThe focus of the scale is on overall psychological well-being\nwith responses of \"yes\" or \"no\" to each question. The indi-\nvidual is asked to focus on his or her feelings during the past\nweek. This scale has strong test\u00adretest reliability and high\nlevels of internal consistency (Schiaffino, 2003). A higher\nscore on this scale represents an overall positive mood state.\nA constant of 15 was added to the ABS scores to yield a dis-\ntribution of positive numbers.\nCenter for Epidemiological Studies\u00adDepression Scale (CES-\nD).The CES-D scale is 20-item measure of psychological\ndistress and depression that has been used in studies with\nyoung people and adults. Excellent levels of internal consis-\ntency have been reported, as well as concurrent and construct\nvalidity (Radloff, 1977). A higher score on the CES-D scale\nindicates a greater degree of depression.\nDepressionAnxiety Stress Scale (DASS). The DASS is a 42-item\nself-report instrument that is used to measure an individual's\ndepression, anxiety, and stress within the past week (Antony,\nBieling, Cox, Enns, & Swinson, 1998). The DASS has dem-\nonstrated strong internal consistency, as well as robust con-\nvergent and discriminant validity in large clinical samples\n(Brown, Chorpita, Korotitsch, & Barlow, 1997). Higher\nscores on each subscale indicate greater distress.\nRosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). The RSES (Rosenberg,\ndeveloped to measure global self-worth. The RSES has\nbeen shown to have high levels of internal consistency as\nwell as convergent and discriminant validity (Sinclair et al.,\n2010). A higher score on the RSES signals a higher level of\nself-esteem.\nThe Resilience Scale (RS). The RS (Wagnild & Young, 1993)\nis a 25-item self-report scale with a 7-point Likert-type\nresponse format. Resilience is a positive characteristic that\nenhances individual adaptation and is conceptualized as\ncomprising personal competence and acceptance of self and\nlife. Reliability and concurrent validity have been demon-\nstrated with adults (Wagnild & Young, 1993), as well as for\nhomeless adolescents (Rew, Taylor-Seehafer, Thomas, &\nFive-Item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5;\nquestionnaire using a 6-point rating scale from 0 to 5, where\nindividuals are asked to select a response based on how they\nhave been feeling in the past 2 weeks. Five indicates the\nhighest level of well-being and 0 indicates the lowest level of\nwell-being. The five items are based on how the individual\nfeels, specifically; relaxed, cheerful, fresh, rested, and spend-\ning time doing things that interest him or her (WHO, 1998).\nThis measure of well-being has been shown to have high lev-\nels of internal and external validity, and concurrent validity\nin a range of populations, including the older adult popula-\ntion with depression (Heun, Bonsignore, Barkow, & Jessen,\n2001) and adolescents diagnosed with diabetes (De Wit,\nPouwer, Gemke, Delemarre-van de Waal, & Snoek, 2007).\nScores are transformed to a scale of 0 to 100 by multiplying\nby 4, with higher scores indicating a greater feeling of\nwell-being.\nDemographic characteristics.Participants reported their age,\ngender, years of education, school attendance, employment\nstatus, marital status, sexual orientation, living arrangements,\nnumber of children (if any), place of birth, parents' place of\nbirth, length of time in Canada, language spoken at home,\nprimary health challenges, current stressors, and reasons for\nattending the group. This information was collected by a\nself-report questionnaire devised for this study.\nIntervention\nMBCT is an empirically supported mental health interven-\ntion (administered in a group format) that extends MBSR by\ncombining mindfulness-based strategies with elements of\ncognitive therapy (Segal et al., 2012). Unlike MBSR, MBCT\nis taught within a cognitive framework, placing a greater\nemphasis on understanding and attending to the cognitive\nand psychological aspects of experience, and incorporating\ntechniques and exercises from cognitive-behavioral therapy\n(CBT; Segal et al., 2012). As stated above, the purpose of the\ncurrent study was to evaluate the effectiveness of MBCT in\nreducing psychological distress and promoting well-being\nfor individuals living with a chronic illness and/or other\nhealth challenges. As the participants in the current study did\nnot necessarily have a diagnosis of depression, minor modi-\nfications were made to the MBCT intervention wherein there\n6 SAGE Open\nTable 3.Paired-Sample t Tests for Participants Pretest (T1) and Posttest (T2; n = 28).\nScale Scale range M T1 (SD) M T2 (SD) t df Significance Cohen's d\nNote.

Each session was 120 min, and included formal and\ninformal mindfulness practices, as well as teaching cogni-\ntive-behavioral skills. Participants were assigned homework\nand were expected to do a formal meditation practice for 30\nto 45 min a day, 6 days a week. They were also given read-\nings and worksheets to complete and discuss in the following\nsessions.\nThe first session of the intervention introduced the partici-\npants to mindfulness, and included the raisin exercise and\nbody scan. These are two different methods of building\nawareness of the present moment. The raisin exercise\nrequires individuals to mindfully hold, examine, feel, smell,\nand taste a raisin. The body scan requires individuals to lie or\nsit still while slowly bringing awareness and relaxation to\neach body part at a time. The second session consisted of\nawareness of breath and an introduction to CBT, including\ndealing with barriers to practice. The pleasant events calen-\ndar was introduced for homework. The third session involved\na mindful seeing exercise, breath and body meditation, and\nthe CBT concepts of mind traps, wise mind, and automatic\nthoughts. In the fourth session, participants were introduced\nto the meditation of sound and a CBT exercise recognizing\nmind traps was introduced. The fifth session included walk-\ning meditation and the 3-min breathing space. The sixth\nweek was devoted to a 3-hr retreat session followed by a half\nhour discussion. Loving kindness practice intended to\nstrengthen an attitude of compassion was discussed, with the\nmajority of time used for silence in meditation. Participants\nwere also asked to complete the stressful communication\ncalendar. The seventh session was devoted to the concept of\nbeing mindful with others, and included choice-less aware-\nness (i.e., perceiving things as they really are) and walking\npractice. The eighth and final session consisted of a review\nof the group, including intentions for ongoing practice. A list\nof community resources to support continued mindfulness\npractice was offered to all participants.\nData Analysis\nThe data were analyzed with the SPSS for Windows, Version\n20. The sample frequencies, means, and standard deviations\nwere calculated. To compare characteristics and baseline\nstudy variables between those who completed the interven-\ntion and those who dropped out, independent t tests for con-\ntinuous data and chi-square (2) tests for categorical data\nwere conducted. Paired-sample t tests were calculated on the\nstudy measures to assess the degree of change between base-\nline and posttest for those participants who completed the\npretest and posttest questionnaires. Paired-sample t tests\nwere also calculated on the study measures to assess the\ndegree of change from posttest assessment to the 4-week\nfollow-up assessment. To correct for the use of multiple\npaired-sample t tests, the Bonferroni correction formula was\ncalculated and indicated a significance value of p = .006 or\nbelow.\nResults\nAt baseline, there were no significant differences in sociode-\nmographic characteristics or the baseline study variables\nbetween those who completed the intervention and those\nwho dropped out. Table 3 describes the results of the paired-\nsample t tests for study measures at baseline and immedi-\nately following the completion of the intervention.\nMcCay et al. 7\nParticipants who completed the intervention and the posttest\nassessment demonstrated a significant improvement in\nscores obtained on the DASS subscales also demonstrated\nsignificant improvement in participants' levels of depres-\nsion, stress, and anxiety (see Table 3). Cohen's d statistic was\ncomputed for all of the study variables (see Table 3) and\nyielded a large effect size on the ABS (0.90), CES-D (1.00),\nand DASS Stress subscale (0.84). In addition, a medium\neffect size was obtained for the DASS Total Score (0.76),\nDASS Depression subscale (0.62), DASS Anxiety subscale\nsize was obtained for the RS (0.47) and a small effect size for\nTable 4 describes the results of the paired-sample t tests\nfor study measures at posttest and at a 4-week follow-up for\nparticipants who completed the intervention and the ques-\ntionnaires at all three time points: baseline, immediately pos-\ntintervention, and at a 4-week follow-up. No significant\ndifferences were observed between participant scores imme-\ndiately postintervention and at the 4-week follow-up, indi-\ncating that observed improvements were sustained at 4\nweeks posttreatment. The improvement observed on the\nanxiety subscale of the DASS was not considered significant\nas the significance level for the study was set at p = .006 or\nbelow, based on the Bonferroni correction.\nDiscussion\nThe findings from this pilot study suggest that MBCT is a\npromising intervention for individuals seeking treatment in\nprimary health care settings who are experiencing elevated\nlevels of psychological distress in the context of chronic ill-\nness and/or other stressful health-related challenges. As\nhypothesized, participants experienced significantly\ndecreased levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as\nsignificantly increased levels of resilience and well-being\nfollowing the completion of the 8-week MBCT intervention.\nThe overall effect size for depression, positive mood states,\nand stress was large, and is comparable with previous studies\nthat have also documented large effect sizes for depression\nfollowing MBCT (Hofmann et al., 2010; Kenny & Williams,\n2007). These gains were also sustained 1 month following\ncompletion of the study intervention. The sustained improve-\nment may be related to continued practice of MBCT skills\nthat were acquired over the 8-week intervention although the\ndegree to which individuals engaged in MBCT practice fol-\nlowing the intervention is unknown.\nIt is noteworthy that scores for depression and anxiety in\nthe current study population were high and comparable with\nthose reported in the literature for other chronic illness popu-\nlations, such as HIV/AIDS (Plach, Stevens, & Heidrich,\n2006), chronic pain (R. Taylor, Lovibond, Nicholas, Cayley,\ndiabetes (Glasgow, Boles, Mckay, Feil, & Barrera, 2003;\nWagner et al., 2001), as well as irritable bowel syndrome\n(Nickel et al., 2010), underlining the similarities between the\ncurrent sample and other normative studies. Taken together,\nthese results convey a high level of mental health need\namong individuals with chronic illness and other health\nchallenges.\nSpecifically, all participants in the present study experi-\nenced psychological distress and many experienced symp-\ntoms of depression and anxiety in the context of chronic\nillness and physical symptoms. It is well known that comor-\nbid anxiety and depression in the context of chronic illness\ngreatly increases the likelihood that individuals will experi-\nence increased medical symptoms, such as increased pain,\nangina, dyspnea, as well as poor self-care (Katon, Lin, &\nKroenke, 2007). Furthermore, comorbid mental health prob-\nlems, including psychological distress, constitute significant\nrisk factors that can negatively affect the capacity for work,\nTable 4.Paired-Sample t Tests for Participants Posttest (T2) and Follow-Up (T3; n = 20).\nScale Scale range M T2 (SD) M T3 (SD) t df Significance\nNote.

This is one of very few studies\nthat have evaluated MBCT with individuals who experi-\nenced psychological distress in the context of chronic illness,\nphysical symptoms, and life stressors, implemented by pri-\nmary care frontline clinicians within a primary health care\nsetting. Although there is a scarcity of studies undertaken in\nprimary care, the current findings align with two studies that\nhave previously evaluated MBCT in primary care settings\ntant to note that these two studies evaluated MBCT in pri-\nmary care where individuals were living with recurrent\ndepression and anxiety in the absence of comorbid chronic\nunlike the current study where the majority of individuals\nwere living with comorbid medical conditions, as well as\npsychological distress and stressful life circumstances. These\nstudies also demonstrated an improvement in anxiety and\ndepressive symptoms.\nThe application of MBCT to a range of clinical popula-\ntions in primary care settings is a logical extension of MBCT.\nMBCT was developed to address the chronic and relapsing\nnature of depression over time and specifically to prevent\nrecurrence. The theoretical orientation of MBCT takes into\naccount the capacity to recognize and disengage from depres-\nsive and ruminative thought patterns, which underlie depres-\nsion and psychological distress, through engaging in\nmindfulness, an approach that has been found to effectively\nprevent the recurrence of depressive episodes (Chiesa &\ndepression are commonly experienced by many living with\nchronic medical conditions and across a broad spectrum of\nchallenging health problems. As such, implementing MBCT\nin primary care promises to offer ready access to treatment\nthat has the potential to prevent the chronic and disabling\ncourse of depression and distress in these populations.\nCurrent health care policy emphasizes the need to reorient\nhealth care toward prevention rather than waiting to intervene\nin periods of acute illness. Furthermore, it is well recognized\nthat approaches directed toward building competence, self-\nresponsibility, and positive behavioral change are highly bene-\nficial to at-risk individuals, helping them to take control of their\noverall health to better manage their lives (Khanlou, 2003;\nMcCabe Ruff & Mackenzie, 2009; WHO, World Organization\nof National Colleges, Academies, & Academic Associations of\nGeneral Practitioners/Family Physicians, 2008). The findings\nfrom this study suggest that MBCT supports the orientation\ntoward competence and self-responsibility, as evidenced by\nsignificantly improved levels of resilience (the internalized\nsense of capacity to withstand stress and manage challenge;\nWagnild & Young, 1993) and well-being following participa-\ntion in the MBCT intervention.\nThe results also underline the broader issue of building\ncapacity among health care providers in delivering psycho-\nlogical interventions, such as MBCT. In this pilot study, the\nintervention was delivered by two social workers but could\nbe provided by other members of the health care team, such\nas registered nurses or family physicians, with adequate\ntraining and personal commitment to ongoing mindfulness\npractice. Increasing the number of health care providers who\nwork in primary care and who are trained in MBCT can\nenhance much-needed access to mental health services in a\nmanner that is acceptable and accessible. Given the limited\navailability and cost of mental health care in tertiary care set-\ntings, the integration of MBCT within primary care to treat\npsychological distress for clients experiencing chronic ill-\nness has been identified as an imperative that is both feasible\nLimitations\nThis study used a pre\u00adposttest design to evaluate the effec-\ntivenesss of MBCT in primary care and did not include a\ncontrol group, and consequently the findings cannot be\ndirectly attributed to participation in MBCT. Another limita-\ntion is the relatively small sample size, which reduces the\ngeneralizability of the current study findings. Future research\nstudies evaluating MBCT in primary care would benefit\nfrom the addition of a control group and a larger sample, to\nprovide increased confidence regarding the study findings.\nFurther details regarding MBCT practice, such as continued\nhomework, were not explored and would provide additional\nunderstanding regarding the mechanisms of change observed\nin the current study.\nConclusion\nDespite the study limitations, MBCT is likely an effective\nintervention that can reduce psychological distress and\nimprove well-being in primary care settings for a broad spec-\ntrum of the population seeking care in primary care. Restricted\naccess to mental health services is a serious public health\nproblem. MBCT, when delivered within primary health care\nsettings, can be made available to those who otherwise would\nnot be able to gain access to mental health care. Continued\nfocus on how to best implement MBCT in primary health care,\nparticularly for those with comorbid physical and mental\nhealth conditions, supports the World Health Organization's\n(WHO, World Organization of National Colleges, Academies,\n& Academic Associations of General Practitioners/Family\nPhysicians, 2008) recommendation to integrate evidence-\nbased mental health care within primary health care to\nMcCay et al. 9\npromote equitable access to care for those most in need. Given\nthe magnitude and chronicity of mental health problems\nRoberge et al., 2011), the importance of policy relevant\nresearch focusing on scaling up MBCT to other primary health\ncare programs and sectors should not be overlooked. The cur-\nrent study highlights the potential of MBCT to equip individu-\nals with a range of skills to manage their distress early in the\nillness trajectory, thus averting serious mental health problems\nand contributing to an improved quality of life.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: The authors grate-\nfully acknowledge the funding from the Faculty of Community\nServices, Ryerson University, for this study.\nReferences\nAntony, M.
