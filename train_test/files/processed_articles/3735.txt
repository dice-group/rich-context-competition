However, a variety of envi-\nronmental factors may also predispose genetically vulnerable\nindividuals to develop ASDs and other neurodevelopmental\ndisorders (Herbert, 2010). From the first report of maternal\ninfection contributing to schizophrenia (Murray et al.,\n1992), environmental perturbations including infection and\nimmune dysfunction, altered levels of neurotransmitters,\nneuropeptides and growth factors, hormonal alterations,\nobstetric complications and exposure to exogenous agents\nincluding medications and illicit drugs, metals and environ-\nmental pollutants have been suggested as predisposing\nfactors in neurodevelopmental disorders including\nschizophrenia, autism and ADHD (attention deficit hy-\nperactivity disorder) (reviewed in Newschaffer et al., 2007).\nChanges in exposure to these environmental factors may also\ncontribute to the increased prevalence of these disorders\nIn this study, we have examined the behavioural and\nanatomic effects of combining genetic and environmental\nfactors thought to be potential candidates for involvement\nin ASDs. Specifically, we have examined the interactions\nbetween the reelin gene and prenatal exposure to an\norganophosphate pesticide, an environmental risk factor\n(Persico and Bourgeron, 2006). Several lines of evidence\nB. R. Mullen and others\nimplicate reelin as a candidate gene for ASDs. First, on\naverage, patients with autism have significantly decreased\nserum levels of reelin protein (Persico et al., 2001; Fatemi\net al., 2002). Additional studies demonstrate decreases in\nreelin protein and mRNA levels in frontal and cerebellar\nareas of autistic brains as well as alterations in mRNA\nexpression of VLDLR (very-low-density lipoprotein receptor)\nand Dab1, downstream mediators of reelin signalling (Fatemi\nand this locus has been associated with ASDs in a variety\nof linkage studies (Bacchelli and Maestrini, 2006; Abrahams\nand Geschwind, 2008). Thirdly, there are distinct similarities\nbetween neuroanatomical alterations observed in reeler\nmutant mice, which carry a naturally occurring deletion\nmutation in the reelin gene (D'Arcangelo et al., 1995) and\nin some autistic patients (Persico and Bourgeron, 2006). The\nheterogeneity of autism precludes establishing a concrete\nset of neuroanatomical phenotypes; however, autistic\npatients show pathological changes including increased cell\ndensity, neuronal disorganization and poor lamination in\nthe cerebral cortex, decreased Purkinjie cell number in the\ncerebellum, increased cell density and reduced neuronal\nsize in the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala,\nand decreased dendritic branching in the hippocampus\n2005). Neuroanatomical alterations in reeler mutant mice\nare more pervasive and extreme than those seen in autistic\npatients but have a number of similarities including lami-\nnation defects and neuronal disorganization in the cortex,\ndecreased and disorganized Purkinje cells, cytoarchitectonic\ndisturbances in the hippocampus, and reduced dendritic\nSeveral lines of evidence suggest pesticide exposure as\na contributing environmental factor in neurodevelopmental\ndisorders. A retrospective case-control study in humans sug-\ngested a link between increased exposure to organochlorine\npesticides and ASDs (Roberts et al., 2007) and organophos-\nphate exposure, as measured by the presence of urinary\nmetabolites, may contribute to ADHD prevalence (Bouchard\net al., 2010). Mutations that reduce or inactivate PON1, which\nencodes an organophosphate inactivator, show significant\nassociation with autism in Caucasian\u00adNorth American fami-\nlies, but not in Italian families (D'Amelio et al., 2005). There\nis less organophosphate usage in European households com-\npared with North American households, suggesting region-\nspecific gene\u00adenvironment interactions. Finally, organophos-\nphate exposure specifically affects the behaviour exhibited\nby reeler mutant mice (Laviola et al., 2006), suggesting a di-\nrect interaction between pesticide exposure and the activity\nof the reelin gene. Together, these pieces of evidence have led\nto the hypothesis that prenatal organophosphate exposure\ncan affect cell migration by modulating reelin activity, thus\npotentially contributing to the neurodevelopmental basis of\nTo evaluate the effects of possible gene\u00adenvironment in-\nteractions in the development of behaviours and anatomical\nphenotypes relevant to ASDs, we have exposed heterozy-\ngous reeler (Rl+ / - ) mice to the active organophosphate CPO\n(chlorpyrifos oxon) during embryonic development. Rl + / -\nmice have reduced levels of reelin protein and show sub-\ntle but discernible differences in neuroanatomy including\ndecreased density of NOS (nitric oxide synthase)-expressing\ncells in the cortex (Tueting et al., 1999), selective reduction\nin forebrain cholinergic neurons (Sigala et al., 2007), alter-\nations in dendritic spine morphology in the hippocampus\nactivity in the brain including decreased GAD67 expression\nand changes in NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor ex-\nvan den Buuse et al., 2012). Behavioural testing suggests mi-\nnor deficits in reversal learning, but no differences in anxi-\nety or social behaviour (Salinger et al., 2003; Podhorna and\nTeixeira et al., 2011). In particular, we sought to determine\nwhether reelin haploinsufficiency coupled with CPO expo-\nsure would affect behaviours specifically relevant to ASDs,\nsuch as communication and social interaction. We also ex-\namined brain morphology to determine if interactions be-\ntween reelin and CPO would produce discernible changes in\nbrain structure. Our findings suggest that both behaviour\nand brain anatomy are affected individually by reelin hap-\nloinsufficiency or by CPO exposure, but that exposure to both\nvariables does not appear to be additive in effect. Exposure to\nboth variables resulted in mitigation of some behavioural and\nanatomical phenotypes, producing behaviours and anatomy\nsimilar to those seen in control animals. This counterbalanc-\ning effect suggests that while genetic and environmental\nfactors both affect brain development, interactions between\nthese variables are not necessarily additive, and in some cases,\nmay mask symptoms caused by one or the other variable. In\nthis regard, fine discrimination may be needed to discern the\neffects of genetic and environmental variables in neurode-\nvelopmental disorders.\nMouse lines and minipump implantation\nReeler mice (B6C3Fe-a/a-Relnrl/+, referred to in this study\nas Rl mice) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory\n(Bar Harbor, ME, U.S.A.) and Dab1exKIneo mice, in which a\nlacZ reporter gene replaces exon 1 of Dab1, were provided\nby Dr Brian Howell (Pramatarova et al., 2008). Both lines\nof mice are maintained on a C57Bl/6 background. For be-\nhavioural studies, heterozygous reeler (Rl+ / - ) female mice\nwere crossed with WT (wild-type) males. The initiation of\npregnancies was determined by visual inspection for vaginal\nplugs; the first appearance of a plug was denoted as gestation\nday (G) 0.5.

Females delivered their litters\non average on G20. Pups were raised by their mothers to\n28 days, then weaned and group housed for the remainder of\ntheir testing period. For anatomical studies, Rl+ / - females\nwere mated with Dab1exKIneo + / - males and minipumps were\nimplanted as above. Offspring from all matings were geno-\ntyped by PCR as described (D'Arcangelo et al., 1995; Howell\nwere divided into four groups \u00ad vehicle-treated Rl+ / + and\nRl+ / - mice, and CPO-treated Rl+ / + and Rl+ / - mice, with\na minimum of six animals per group used for behavioural\ntesting and a minimum of three animals per group used\nfor anatomical and biochemical analysis. All animal studies\nwere performed in accordance with the NIH guidelines for\nthe Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and approved\nby the UCLA Chancellor's Animal Research Committee.\nACHE (acetylcholinesterase) activity\nACHE activity was measured using a modified Ellman re-\naction.

Total protein concen-\ntration was determined using a Bradford assay and ACHE\nactivity was determined by colorimetric analysis utilizing\nthe QuantiChromTM Acetylcholinesterase Assay Kit (BioAs-\nsay Systems) following the manufacturer's instructions. The\nprotein quantification and ACHE assays were repeated in trip-\nlicate, then the samples were averaged to determine the final\nresults.\nWestern blotting for reelin protein\nquantification\nEmbryonic heads were harvested at E16.5, 3 days after\nminipump implantation, flash-frozen and stored at - 80C.\nHeads were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 50 mM\n1 mM EDTA, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P40 (Igepal), with phos-\nphatase inhibitor cocktail (ZmTech Scientific) containing 1\u00ad\n(sodium orthovanadate), 1\u00ad3% AEBSF [4-(2-\naminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride], 1\u00ad3% aprotinin and\n1\u00ad3% leupeptin.

Relative intensities of the pro-\ntein bands were quantified by scanning densitometry using\nImageJ.\nBehavioural testing\nUltrasound vocalization\nMice at postnatal day (P) 7 were separated from their dams\nand placed into warm soundproof chambers equipped with\nultrasonic detectors connected to recording and analysis\nsoftware (UltraVox, VisualSonics). The number and duration\nof vocalizations at 70 Hz were recorded during a 10-min\ntesting period. Male and female mice were assessed sepa-\nrately, with four groups of animals (vehicle-treated Rl+ / + ,\nCPO-treated Rl+ / + , vehicle-treated Rl+ / - and CPO-treated\nRl+ / - ) tested for each sex. The collected data were scrubbed\nfor outliers and statistical significance across the four test\ngroups in each sex was determined using individual t-test\ncomparisons and aggregate ANOVA analysis.\nOpen-field behaviour\nplexiglass arena and video-recorded for 20 min using Top-\nScan (CleverSys Inc.). A central rectangle, occupying 62.6%\nof the total area was superimposed over the arena profile\nand animals were scored for the amount of time spent in\nthe centre against the periphery of the chamber. The number\nof sniffing events, an exploratory behaviour, was also de-\ntermined for the centre of the chamber and the periphery\nduring the recording.\nSocial interaction\nMice were tested at P30 for social interactions using a three-\nchambered social interaction apparatus (Crawley, 2004). Prior\nto testing, animals were habituated for 5 min in the appa-\nratus; testing was then conducted in two phases. In the first\nphase, an age- and sex-matched stranger mouse was intro-\nduced under a wire mesh cup in one of the two-side cham-\nbers, along with an empty mesh wire cup in the other side\nchamber. The amount of time spent in each chamber was\nrecorded for the test mouse in a 10-min trial using Top-\nScan (CleverSys Inc.). In the second phase, a novel stranger\n(Stranger #2) was introduced into the second side cham-\nber under a mesh cup, whereas the original stranger mouse\n(Stranger #1) remained in its original position. Again, the\namount of time spent in each of the three chambers was\nrecorded for the test mouse. The number of sniffing events\nin each of the three chambers was also scored.\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) 29\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nB. R. Mullen and others\nMarble burying\nMarble burying was used as a test of repetitive and perse-\nverative behaviour (Thomas et al., 2009). Standard shoebox\nmouse cages were filled with 4 cm of SaniChip bedding and\nan array of 20 black glass marbles in a 4\u00d75 arrangement was\nlaid on top of the bedding. Male mice at P60 were intro-\nduced to the arena for a 20-min testing period; at the end\nof the testing period, the array was photographed and the\nburied marbles were counted. Marbles were scored as buried\nif >50% of the marble was covered by bedding. In addition\nto scoring the number of marbles buried, the activity of the\nanimals was also assessed by scoring for digging behaviour\nfor 2 s intervals every 20 s throughout the testing period.\nNeuroanatomical characterization\nIn order to visualize cells potentially responsive to reelin sig-\nnalling, we utilized a Dab1lacZ reporter mouse (Dab1exKIneo;\nimal, Dab1 coding sequences are replaced with a lacZ gene.\nDab1 is a downstream mediator of reelin signalling; thus\nthose cells that express the lacZ reporter are potentially\nresponsive to reelin signalling. Dab1exKIneo male mice were\nintercrossed with heterozygous reeler female mice (Rl+ / - ),\nwhich were then used for osmotic minipump implantation\nas described above. CPO- and vehicle-treated Rl+ / + and\nRl+ / - mice that were also heterozygous for the Dab1exKIneo\nallele were collected at P14, perfused with 4% (v/v) PFA\n(paraformaldehyde) and the brains dissected and fixed by\nimmersion for 4 h. After fixation, the brains were washed, in-\nfiltrated overnight with 30% (w/v) sucrose, then embedded\nand frozen in the OCT mounting medium (Sukura Finetek).\nSections were cut at 30 m, air-dried, then reacted with X-\nGal reaction buffer as previously described (Choe et al., 2006).\nSelected sections were photographed using a Zeiss Axioskop\nequipped with a cooled CCD camera; photographs were mini-\nmally processed for colour balancing using Adobe Photoshop.\nDensitometry was performed using NIH ImageJ by creating a\ncolumn average plot for each section using profile plot on a\neach pixel.\nRESULTS\nTo evaluate the effects of possible gene\u00adenvironment inter-\nactions in the development of behaviours and anatomical\nphenotypes relevant to ASDs, we have examined mice that\nexpress reduced levels of reelin protein and were exposed to\norganophosphate pesticides during a period of active cor-\ntical development. We used a combination of biochemical\nanalysis, to assess ACHE activity and the levels of reelin pro-\ntein, behavioural analysis, to assess phenotypes relevant to\nASD and anatomical analysis, to assess changes in the or-\nganization and anatomy of olfactory, cortical and cerebellar\nregions. A schematic outline of the experimental design is\nprovided in Figure 1. All mice were provided with exposure\nperiod corresponds to a time of robust cortical development\nin mice when reelin signalling is known to be active, and has\nalso been used in prior studies (e.g. Laviola et al., 2006), thus\nallowing comparison of results across different laboratories.\nBehavioural testing was performed following a set schedule\nand in the same order for each cohort of mice, to control\nfor testing or age-related artefacts. Anatomical analysis was\nperformed on mice collected at P14, when cortical and sub-\ncortical development is largely complete, eliminating possible\nartefacts due to immaturity of the brain. In addition, this age\nwas chosen to ensure strong expression of the Dab1lacZ re-\nporter. Dab1 activity is incrementally decreased postnatally\n(Keshvara et al., 2002), thus, to ensure accurate detection\nof cells that are likely to be responsive to reelin signalling,\nanatomical analysis was performed while reporter expression\nwas still strong.\nSurvival, growth, ACHE activity and reelin\nprotein levels\nTo determine the prenatal effects of CPO exposure, we first\nexamined the average litters of CPO-treated pups com-\npared with vehicle-treated pups. Prenatal CPO exposure did\nnot have significant effects on litter size, with CPO-\ntreated litters averaging 7.4 pups (n = 9 litters) and\nvehicle-treated litters averaging 7.5 pups (n = 13 litters). We\nwere curious whether prenatal organophosphate exposure\nmight differentially affect Rl+ / - mice, which have reduced\nlevels of reelin protein, as compared with Rl+ / + mice. How-\never, we found an approximately equal distribution of Rl+ / +\nand Rl+ / - mice in our litters, with 52% of pups being Rl+ / +\nand 48% of pups being Rl+ / - after CPO treatment and 48%\nof pups being Rl+ / + and 52% being Rl+ / - after vehicle\ntreatment (Table 1). This suggests that prenatal CPO expo-\nsure did not differentially affect the survival of Rl+ / + or\nRl+ / - embryos. We did observe an increased percentage of\nmales in CPO-treated litters (66% male against 34% female),\nhowever, only 67 pups were obtained in total, so this distri-\nbution may reflect normal variation in litter composition.\nTo assess the efficacy of prenatal CPO exposure, we\nmeasured ACHE activity in embryos. ACHE is a serine pro-\ntease and serine protease activity is specifically inhibited by\norganophosphate pesticides. CPO was administered via an\nosmotic minipump for 3 days beginning at E13.5. This period\ncorresponds to the peak period of neurogenesis and cell mi-\ngration in the mouse cerebral cortex (Caviness, 1982); thus\nthis window of application is the most likely time to af-\nfect the development of anatomical alterations relevant to\nautism. Three days after minipump implantation, we found\nthat baseline ACHE activity was slightly higher in Rl+ / - an-\nimals compared with Rl+ / + animals (Figure 2), similar to\nresults reported for postnatal mice (Laviola et al., 2006). CPO\ntreatment reduced ACHE activity in both Rl+ / + and Rl+ / -\n30 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nReelin haploinsufficency and organophosphate exposure\nFigure 1 Timeline (A) and mouse-breeding scheme (B, C) for data presented in this study\nMinipumps were implanted at E13.5 and were active for 3 days (grey box in A). Embryos were collected at E16.5 for ACHE activity\nanalysis and for Western blotting. Behavioural testing was conducted from P7 to P60, with ultrasound vocalization tested at P7, open\nfield behaviour and social interactions tested at P30 and marble burying tested at P60. Mice used for behavioural testing were generated\nby intercrossing Rl+ / - - males and C57Bl/6 females (B). Mice used for anatomical analysis were generated by intercrossing male\nDab1exKIne/ + mice with Rl+ / - females (C). In both breeding schemes, females were implanted with either CPO- or vehicle-loaded\nminipumps. The genotypes of offspring used for anatomical and behavioural analysis are illustrated in the brackets in (B) and (C).\nTable 1 Number of litters and pups derived from vehicle-implanted or CPO-implanted dams\nGroup Total pups Number of litters Average litter size Males Females + / + + / -\nmice to approximately 85% of the starting value, demon-\nstrating that CPO derived from the osmotic minipumps can\naffect embryonic brain biochemistry.\nTo directly assess the effects of prenatal CPO exposure\non reelin protein, we performed Western blotting. Full-length\nreelin protein is approximately 410 kDa; cleavage of the pro-\nexpected, vehicle-treated Rl+ / - embryos showed approx-\nimately 50% less full-length reelin protein than vehicle-\ntreated Rl+ / + embryos (Figure 2). The 330 kDa fragment was\nalso reduced approximately 50%, whereas the 180 kDa frag-\nment was reduced, but not to the same extent. CPO treatment\nof Rl+ / + embryos did not significantly change the levels of\neither full-length reelin or the cleavage fragments. Surpris-\ningly, CPO treatment restored the levels of reelin protein to\nnear WT levels in Rl+ / - embryos, both for full-length protein\nand for the cleavage fragments. This supports our hypothesis\nthat CPO exerts a protective effect on reelin protein.\nBehavioural alterations in response to loss of\nreelin and to CPO exposure\nThree different behavioural measures were used to assess\nphenotypes relevant to ASD. First, we recorded ultrasound\nvocalization on mice at P7. Ultrasound vocalization has been\nreported to peak at P7\u00adP10 in most strains of mice.

R. Mullen and others\nFigure 2 ACHE activity (A) and relative levels of reelin protein\nnormalized to -actin (B) in E16 mouse brains following 3 days of\nprenatal vehicle or CPO treatment\nobservations in our laboratory suggested that the most robust\nvocalizations were produced at P7 in our mice; therefore\nwe used this age for all additional testing. Mice were then\nscreened for open field behaviour and social interaction at\nP30 and for marble burying and digging behaviour at P60.\nEach cohort of animals was tested at the same ages and\nfollowing the same schedule.\nUltrasound vocalization\nInfant mice emit ultrasonic vocalizations when separated\nfrom their dams to elicit pup retrieval, suggesting that these\nvocalizations play an important role in communication be-\ntween mothers and their pups. Changes in ultrasound vocal-\nization have also been used to characterize possible mouse\nmodels for autism (e.g. Scattoni et al., 2009; Young et al.,\n2010), although unlike human language, mouse ultrasound\nvocalizations are innate behaviours suggesting that these\ntypes of communication are not equivalent (Fischer and Ham-\nmerschmidt, 2011). Rl+ / + and Rl+ / - pups with and without\nCPO exposure were assessed for ultrasound vocalization dur-\ning a brief separation from their dams at P7 (Figure 3).\nThe number of vocalizations varied significantly across\nall four groups in both male and female mice by\nboth CPO-treated Rl+ / + mice and vehicle-treated Rl+ / -\nmice produced fewer vocalizations than vehicle-treated\nRl+ / + animals (Figure 3A). In contrast, CPO-treated Rl+ / -\nmice made more cries than vehicle-treated Rl+ / + animals.\nThis suggests both individual effects of reduced reelin and\nCPO exposure and combinatorial effects of the two vari-\nables together. In female mice, both CPO-treated Rl+ / +\nand Rl+ / - animals showed significantly reduced vocaliza-\ntions, whereas vehicle-treated animals showed similar num-\nbers of vocalizations (Figure 3A). The number of female vo-\ncalizations thus seems specifically sensitive to CPO expo-\nsure, with no additional effect derived from reduced reelin\nexpression.\nExamination of the average duration of vocaliza-\ntions also showed significance across the four groups by\nration of vocalizations was significantly reduced only in CPO-\ntreated Rl+ / + males (Figure 3B), with no apparent reductions\nin Rl+ / - mice. However, duration of vocalization was re-\nstored to control levels in CPO-treated Rl+ / - mice, again\nsuggesting a combinatorial interaction between variables in\nmale mice. In contrast, in female mice, both CPO treatment\nand loss of reelin expression appeared to reduce the number\nof vocalizations to levels below that exhibited by vehicle-\ntreated Rl+ / + animals. In females, combinatorial interac-\ntions between reduced reelin and CPO exposure were not\napparent, as there was no change in vocal duration between\nvehicle-treated Rl+ / - mice and CPO-treated Rl+ / - mice.\nOpen field behaviour\nRl+ / + and Rl+ / - pups with and without CPO exposure were\nassessed for open field behaviour at P30 (Figure 4). For these\nexperiments, mice were introduced to an open field enclo-\nsure and allowed to explore for 20 min. Mice were scored\nfor the amount of time spent in the centre of the chamber\nagainst the periphery, as well as for sniffing, an exploratory\nbehaviour, in both the centre and the periphery of the arena.\nAll groups of male mice spent approximately 60% of their\ntime in the periphery and 40% in the centre, with no sig-\nnificant differences between any of the groups (Figure 4A).\nMost female mice showed a similar spatial distribution, with\nthe exception of CPO-treated Rl+ / - mice, which showed a\nsmall but significant skewing toward more time spent in the\ncentre and less time spent in the periphery, when compared\nwith vehicle-treated Rl+ / + mice (Figure 4D).

This again sug-\ngests a combinatorial interaction between reduced reelin\nand CPO exposure, similar to that observed in male ultra-\nsound vocalization behaviour. In summary, both male and\nfemale mice showed slight changes in open field behaviour\nin response to either decreasing levels of reelin or to CPO\nexposure, although by different measures. Females showed\na combinatorial effect of both treatments on the distribu-\ntion of time spent in the centre against periphery of the\narena, whereas males showed a combinatorial effect of both\ntreatments on sniffing behaviour in the centre. These results\nalso demonstrate sex-specific changes, with males showing\nslightly increased anxiety and females showing decreased\nanxiety.\nSocial interaction\nSocial interactions were tested in a three-chamber social in-\nteraction apparatus (Crawley, 2004). Two testing paradigms\nwere used. In the first (phase I, Figures 5A\u00ad5D), the test\nmouse was introduced to a single stranger mouse, contained\nunder a wire mesh cup in one of the two side chambers in\nthe apparatus, whereas the other side chamber contained\nan empty cup. In this paradigm, the amount of time spent\nin each of the three chambers, along with the amount of\nsniffing, was measured. As expected, vehicle-treated Rl+ / +\nmales and females both showed an increased preference\nfor spending time in the chamber with the stranger mouse\nand this preference was not significantly altered by either\ngenotype or CPO treatment (Figure 5). Sniffing behaviour\nwas also assessed by quantifying the amount of time spent\nsniffing at the cup containing the stranger mouse and at\nthe empty cup. Males and females both showed an in-\ncreased preference for sniffing at the stranger mouse. In\nmales, sniffing behaviour was not significantly affected by\neither genotype or CPO treatment, but in females, CPO\ntreatment significantly increased the amount of time spent\n34 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nReelin haploinsufficency and organophosphate exposure\nFigure 6 Marble burying (A) and digging behaviour (B)\nThe marble burying assay was scored for the total number of marbles buried (A) and the number of digging events throughout the\ntrial (B).\nsniffing at the stranger mouse for both Rl+ / + and Rl+ / -\nmice.\nIn the second testing paradigm (phase II, Figures 5E\u00ad5H),\na novel stranger mouse was introduced under the previously\nempty cup and time in each of the chambers and sniffing be-\nhaviour was recorded for all animals. Both males and females\nshowed a decrease in the amount of time spent with a famil-\niar stranger (Stranger 1) and a concomitant increase in the\ntime spent with a novel stranger (Stranger 2); neither geno-\ntype nor CPO treatment affected this distribution. Sniffing at\nthe novel stranger was moderately increased for all males and\nfor most females. However, CPO-treated Rl+ / + female mice\nshowed the opposite response and sniffed more at the famil-\niar stranger than at the novel stranger (Figure 5H), although\nthe differences were not statistically significant. These ob-\nservations suggest that genotype and CPO treatment had\nmoderate effects on social behaviour, with only significant\neffects on sniffing behaviour in female mice. CPO treatment\nappears to slightly increase sniffing behaviour in female mice\nin the phase I trials, and to slightly alter sniffing only in Rl+ / +\nfemales in phase II trials.\nMarble burying\nMarble burying is often used as a measure of anxiety in\nmice, but recent studies suggest it may be more accurately\nused as a measure for repetitive and perseverative behaviours\nthe core behaviours in ASDs. We examined two behaviours\nusing this assay \u00ad the total number of marbles buried at the\nend of the 20-min test period and the number of digging\nevents occurring throughout each trial. The total number\nof marbles buried was affected by genotype, but not by CPO\ntreatment, as elevated levels of marble burying were observed\nin Rl+ / - animals regardless of CPO exposure (Figure 6). t-test\ncomparisons did not identify significant differences between\nvehicle-treated Rl+ / + mice and any other group, but the\ndistribution of marbles buried across all four groups was\nA moderate increase in digging was also observed in Rl+ / -\nanimals, but this increase was not statistically significant\nIn summary, our behavioural testing yielded some spe-\ncific behavioural alterations attributable either to prenatal\nCPO exposure or to decreased reelin expression. Although\nour model would have predicted an increase in autistic-like\nbehaviours in animals with decreased reelin expression and\nCPO exposure, the changes we saw were not entirely consis-\ntent with this model. Some behaviours seemed sensitive to\nCPO exposure, whereas others were somewhat more sensi-\ntive to loss of reelin expression. Interestingly, combining CPO\nexposure and loss of reelin expression seemed to have more\nof an effect in female mice rather than in male mice. Given\nthe highly increased prevalence of autism in human males,\nthis is surprising. Although decreased social interactions were\nevident in both males and females, they appeared to be dif-\nferentially induced, with females showing decreased social\ninteractions in response to CPO exposure, whereas males\nshowed decreased social interactions with decreased reelin\nexpression.\nAnatomical alterations in response to loss of\nreelin and to CPO exposure\nReelin signalling is known to be critically important for\nthe development of layered structures in the brain includ-\ning the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum.

Dab1 is an intra-\ncellular adaptor protein that is phosphorylated in response\nto reelin signalling; thus its presence is an indicator of those\ncells that are capable of responding to reelin signalling.\nThe olfactory system\nOlfactory identification has been reported to be impaired in\nseveral studies of ASD patients (Suzuki et al., 2003; Bennetto\net al., 2007) and impaired olfactory discrimination may pro-\nvide a categorical tool for identifying sensory subtypes of\nautism (Lane et al., 2011). We examined the organization of\ntwo structures implicated in olfactory reception and infor-\nmation processing, the olfactory bulb (Figure 7) and the pir-\niform cortex (Figure 8). In vehicle-treated Rl+ / + mice, three\ndistinct regions clearly express the Dab1lacZ marker in the ol-\nfactory bulb \u00ad the glomerular layer, the mitral cell layer and\nthe granule cell layer (Figure 7A). LacZ expression outlines the\nglomeruli, and is found at high levels in both the mitral cell\nlayer and the granule cell layer, with lower lacZ expression\nin the external and internal plexiform layers. Vehicle-treated\nRl+ / - mice and CPO-treated Rl+ / + and Rl+ / - mice all re-\ntain Dab1lacZ expression in these layers, although with some\ndistinct differences in the distribution of lacZ expression. No\ndifferences were noted in the glomerular layer, but Rl+ / -\nanimals, both with and without CPO treatment showed vari-\nability in labelling in the granule cell layer, often with an\napparent decrease in the intensity of labelling, along with\nan increase in the thickness of the internal plexiform layer\n(Figures 7C and 7D). The mitral cell layer also appears thinner\nin these animals.\nTo quantify differences in lacZ distribution, we performed\na density analysis of lacZ expression. To do this, the average\nlabelling intensity was calculated from the internal edge of\nthe granule cell layer to the external margin of the external\nplexiform layer using NIH ImageJ. Density plots were stan-\ndardized by superimposing the peak of the mitral cell layer\nfrom each individual plot and an average density value was\ncalculated for all animals in each genotype and treatment\ngroup. Plots from vehicle-treated Rl+ / + mice showed tight\ncorrelations in the position of the granule cell layer and the\nmitral cell layer, but some spread of lacZ distribution in\nthe external plexiform layer (Figure 7E). The intensity of mi-\ntral cell layer labelling showed increased variability in other\ntreatment conditions, particularly in vehicle-treated Rl+ / -\nanimals and in CPO-treated Rl+ / + animals (Figures 7F and\n7G). In addition, labelling intensity was highly variable in the\ngranule cell layer, confirming our qualitative observations.\nThickness of the inner plexiform layer, defined as the distance\nfrom the granule layer peak to the mitral layer peak also in-\ncreased in CPO-treated Rl+ / + animals to 67.33 +\n- 1.73 m (n = 3) in vehicle-treated Rl+ / +\nanimals. Surprisingly, CPO-treated Rl+ / - animals showed a\nrelatively normal intensity profile (Figure 7H). This suggests\npossible opposing effects of reelin heterozygosity and CPO\ntreatment, resulting in a more normal lacZ intensity distri-\nbution in CPO-treated Rl+ / - mice than in either vehicle-\ntreated Rl+ / - mice or CPO-treated Rl+ / + mice.\nThe piriform cortex serves as the first cortical relay station\nfor olfactory input from the mitral cells of the olfactory\nbulb (Haberly, 2001). The piriform cortex is trilaminar, with\na largely cell-free superficial lamina (lamina I) and two cell-\ndense deeper laminae (Figure 8). Both vehicle-treated and\nCPO-treated Rl+ / - animals showed an increase in the density\nand width of lamina II, and this cell layer appeared much more\npronounced in Rl+ / - animals as a result. The distinction\nbetween laminae II and III decreased in CPO-treated Rl+ / +\nand the combined width of both laminae increased.

In particular, CPO-treated Rl+ / + animals\nhad far greater expression of -gal in lamina I (Figure 8C).\nThe neocortex\nReelin signalling has been extensively studied as a factor\nin neocortical patterning and loss of this signalling leads\nto altered cell positioning and inverted cortical lamination\n(reviewed in Rice and Curran, 2001). Moderate neocortical\ndisruptions have also been observed in some autistic pa-\nmost studies fail to note any neocortical alterations (e.g.\nBauman and Kemper, 2005). Neocortical organization was\nlargely normal in our studies. Vehicle- and CPO-treated mice\nexhibited essentially normal neocortical layering regardless\nof genotype. In the somatosensory cortex, -gal expression\nwas noted in superficial cortical laminae (laminae II/III) and\nalso in lamina V (Figure 9). Lamina IV was largely free of -gal\nexpression. In general, Dab1 expression, as judged by\n-gal expression, was noticeably less pronounced in the neo-\ncortex than in the piriform cortex.

Pyramidal cells, which normally form\na compact layer in the CA fields, become dispersed dorsally\ninto the stratum oriens, while the granular dentate gyrus be-\ncomes extensively disorganized (Caviness and Sidman, 1973;\nF\u00a8\norster et al., 2006). In our studies, Dab1 -gal expression was\nseen as discrete punctate labelling in a dense layer in the CA\npyramidal cell layer (Figure 10). Punctate labelling was evi-\ndent, but more dispersed, in the stratum oriens, whereas the\nradiatum exhibited sparse labelling. Qualitative assessment\nsuggested that there was increased -gal expression in the\nstratum oriens in both vehicle-treated Rl+ / - animals and in\nCPO-treated Rl+ / + animals. To quantify these changes, the\nstratum oriens was divided into six bins from medial to lateral\nand the number of -gal grains counted in each bin. Vehicle-\ntreated Rl+ / + animals had -gal expression at the highest\nlevels in the three medial bins, whereas expression substan-\ntially decreased in the three more lateral bins (Figure 10E).\nVehicle-treated Rl+ / - animals showed a similar distribu-\ntion of expression. In contrast, CPO-treated Rl+ / + ani-\nmals showed approximately equal -gal distribution across\nthe first four bins, with moderate decreases in expression\nin the most lateral bins. CPO-treated Rl+ / - animals also\nshowed relatively equal -gal expression across the first four\nbins. In contrast to all other groups, CPO-treated Rl+ / - an-\nimals showed higher levels of -gal expression in the most\nlateral bin. This suggests a difference in the distribution of\nDab1-expressing cells in the stratum oriens in CPO-treated\nRl+ / - animals.\nThe cerebellum\nReeler mutant mice are known to have cerebellar abnor-\nmalities, including lack of distinct lamination and foliation\nalong with displaced Purkinje cells (Bauman and Kemper,\n2005).

Small\namounts of -gal expression were also seen in the granule cell\nlayer. There was a clear separation of Purkinje cell expression\nfrom -gal expression in the molecular layer and expression\nin the Purkinje cell layer appeared continuous throughout\nthe extent of the folia examined, without significant gaps\n(Figure 11A). Vehicle-treated, Rl+ / - animals exhibited ap-\nproximately the same distribution of -gal, suggesting no\napparent changes in cerebellar layering in heterozygous an-\nimals (Figure 11C). However, CPO treatment in Rl+ / + an-\nimals increased -gal expression in the molecular layer of\nthe lateral lobules, but not in the vermis (Figure 11B). To\nquantify these changes, sections were scored for the levels\nof -gal expression (high, medium, low, using levels equiva-\nlent to those seen in the vermis as `high'). Assigning a value\nof 1 to low, 2 to medium and 3 to high suggested that\nvehicle-treated Rl+ / + animals had an average expression of\n- 0 (n = 3). Levels were decreased on average in vehicle-\nat WT levels in CPO-treated Rl+ / - animals (2.07 +\nn = 7). Although vehicle-treated Rl+ / + and Rl+ / - animals\nand CPO-treated Rl+ / + animals had fairly consistent levels\nof -gal expression in the lateral lobes, expression was much\nmore variable in CPO-treated Rl+ / - animals. This suggests\nsome moderate changes in cerebellar layering specifically in\nthe more lateral lobes.\nIn summary, our anatomical studies made use of a Dab1lacZ\nreporter mouse to visualize all cells potentially responsive to\nreelin signalling. Anatomical studies have been conducted\non Rl+ / - animals and reveal subtle phenotypes in cell place-\nment and dentritic arborization (Niu et al., 2008). However,\nall prior studies have relied on examining only specific cell\ntypes. Our current study provided a method to perform a\nsurvey of potentially all cell populations responsive to reelin\nsignalling. We selected several brain regions known to be\naffected by disruptions in reelin signalling and assessed the\norganization of Dab1-expressing cells in these regions. We\ndemonstrate subtle alterations in cell layering and position-\ning stemming from either reduced reelin expression or CPO\nexposure, but we found no evidence for combinatorial inter-\nactions between these variables leading to increased brain\nalterations.\nDISCUSSION\nOur study demonstrates clear but modest changes in be-\nhaviour and brain anatomy as a result of either decreased\nreelin expression or CPO exposure. Based on the identifi-\ncation of decreased reelin expression and organophosphate\npesticide exposure as possible contributing factors to ASD\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) 39\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nB. R. Mullen and others\nwe examined mouse behaviours representative of the three\nkey arenas in ASD \u00ad communication, social interaction, and\nrestricted and repetitive behaviours. We found subtle alter-\nations in each of these three behaviours. Some of the al-\nterations, such as increased marble burying, appeared to be\ndirected by genotype alone, whereas others, such as ultra-\nsound vocalization and social interaction, could be altered by\neither decreased reelin or by exposure to CPO. Additionally,\nmale and female mice often responded differently to these\nfactors. Curiously, we failed to find an additive detrimen-\ntal effect of decreased reelin combined with CPO exposure\non either mouse behaviour or brain anatomy. In fact, we\noften observed the opposite result \u00ad combining decreased\nreelin and CPO exposure mitigated the effects of either fac-\ntor alone.\nPrior studies have demonstrated a functional interac-\ntion between reelin and organophosphate exposure, but the\nmechanisms for this interaction remain unclear. CPO expo-\nsure may have several effects on brain development. Exposure\nto lethal doses of CPO produces acute neurotoxicity, which\nlikely stems from inhibition of ACHE, producing a cholinergic\ncrisis due to synaptic accumulation of acetylcholine and the\nhyperstimulation of postsynaptic muscarinic and nicotinic re-\nceptors (Flaskos, 2012). However, exposure to sublethal doses\nof CPO also produces neurodevelopmental toxicity, although\nthe mechanisms for this effect are less clear. Sublethal CPO\nexposure generates stable adducts on tyrosine and serine,\naltering the function of many proteins, although not in a\npredictable fashion. In one study, chronic exposure to low\nlevels of CPO altered the structure of microtubules and af-\nfected the complement of microtubule-associated proteins\n(Jiang et al., 2010). These effects have the potential to al-\nter cytoskeletal structure and to affect the migratory ability\nof developing neurons. Reelin also has known cytoskeletal\neffects, with disruption of the reelin signalling pathway re-\nsulting in hyperphosphorylation of tau, disturbing interac-\ntions with microtubules and destabilizing the cytoskeleton\n(Heisberger et al., 1999). If both reelin signalling and CPO ex-\nposure converge on the cytoskeleton, then we might expect\nthat introduction of these two variables would produce more\npronounced alterations in cell migration and brain anatomy.\nHowever, this does not appear to be the case in our studies.\nAlternatively, CPO may affect the structure and stability of\nreelin itself. Secreted reelin undergoes two cleavage events\nto produce three fragments (Lambert de Rouvroit et al., 1999;\nJossin et al., 2007); as reelin is cleaved, its signalling ability\ndiminishes (Kohno et al., 2009). The enzyme(s) responsible for\nthese cleavages have not yet been identified, but preliminary\nevidence suggests the involvement of proprotein convertase\n2 or ADAM (a disintegrase and metalloprotease) family mem-\nthat CPO may affect the function of these enzymes to inhibit\nthe cleavage of reelin, thus potentially increasing the pool\nof full-length reelin; this possibility is consistent with our\nWestern blotting results. In this case, animals with decreased\nreelin levels may have partial restoration of reelin signalling\nactivity in the presence of CPO, at least to levels that allow\ngeneration of normal anatomical organization.\nA prior study has also demonstrated specific behavioural\nchanges in heterozygous reeler mice embryonically exposed\nto CPO (Laviola et al., 2006), but similar to our study, the re-\nsults were also paradoxical. In Laviola et al. (2006) the num-\nber of ultrasound vocalizations was decreased in CPO-treated\nRl+ / + mice and increased in CPO-treated Rl+ / - mice.\nAdditionally, scopolamine- and amphetamine-induced loco-\nmotion was decreased in CPO-treated Rl+ / + animals and in-\ncreased in CPO-treated Rl+ / - animals. While we did not test\nscopolamine- or amphetamine-induced locomotion, our ul-\ntrasound vocalization studies showed similar effects to those\nseen by Laviola et al. (2006) with CPO treatment decreasing\nultrasound vocalization in WT mice and increasing it in Rl+ / -\nmale mice. However, in female mice, the number of ultra-\nsound vocalizations was not affected by changes in reelin\nexpression, as both vehicle-treated Rl+ / + and Rl+ / - ani-\nmals showed similar numbers of vocalizations. In contrast,\nCPO treatment significantly decreased the number of vocal-\nizations in both Rl+ / + and Rl+ / - females.\nAdditional behavioural tests also showed paradoxical re-\nsults, with distinct differences between males and females.\nOpen field testing showed no difference in centre against\nperiphery time distribution in males, but did show decreased\nsniffing in the centre of the arena in both CPO-treated Rl+ / +\nmice and vehicle-treated Rl+ / - mice, whereas CPO-treated\nRl+ / - mice showed no significant differences from vehicle-\ntreated Rl+ / + animals. Both CPO-treated Rl+ / + and\nvehicle-treated Rl+ / - female mice showed modest, but not\nsignificantly different time distribution, whereas CPO-treated\nRl+ / - female mice showed a possible additive effect of both\nphenotypes and demonstrated a preference for the centre of\nthe arena. In contrast, no sniffing differences were noted in\nany treatment condition in female mice. Social interactions\nwere largely indistinguishable from control animals in both\nmales and females, although a slight but significant increase\nin sniffing at stranger mice was demonstrated by CPO-treated\nRl+ / + and Rl+ / - females, suggesting that this behaviour is\nmodulated by CPO treatment but not by reelin genotype. In\ncontrast, marble burying appeared to be affected solely by\ngenotype in male mice, with no effect of CPO treatment.\nThese results suggest a complex effect of decreases in reelin\nexpression and CPO treatment on behaviours related to ASDs.\nAnatomical substrates for ASDs have been poorly defined\nin humans, probably due to the high variability of the dis-\norder. By using a Dab1lacZ reporter mouse, we were able to\nidentify brain regions that are potentially responsive to reelin\nsignalling, by virtue of their expression of Dab1. Identify-\ning brain structures that are altered in response to changes\nin genetic or environmental factors may represent a first\nstep towards identifying possible anatomical substrates of\nASDs. Reelin signalling has been widely recognized as a crit-\nical signal in establishing cortical layers, with reeler mutant\nmice exhibiting inverted cortical layering (reviewed in Rice\nand Curran, 2001). Surprisingly, decreased reelin expression\n40 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nReelin haploinsufficency and organophosphate exposure\nand/or CPO exposure failed to induce measurable cortical\nalterations, at least in terms of cell populations expressing\nDab1. It is possible that individual cell populations might be\nmispositioned even in the absence of gross abnormalities,\nbut confirmation of this possibility in the future will require\nimmunohistochemical studies using cell-specific markers.\nUnlike the cortex, layering and cell positioning alter-\nations were observed in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus\nand cerebellum. These alterations tended to take the form\nof more diffuse -gal expression in specific cell layers (e.g.\nin the olfactory bulb), and decreased segregation between\nidentified laminae (e.g in the piriform cortex). Additionally,\nwe observed mispositioned Dab1-expressing cells, e.g. the\nextra cells present in lamina I of the piriform cortex,\nthe extra cells in molecular layer of the cerebellum, and\naltered distribution of cells in the stratum oriens in the hip-\npocampus. These changes are subtle and could probably only\nbe visualized using a reporter gene system as we have done.\nSimilar changes might be difficult to detect using imag-\ning studies on human patients; this may be one reason why\nanatomical substrates of ASDs have to date gone largely un-\ndetected. Although we have identified alterations in regional\nlayering and cell positioning, it remains to be seen what\nspecific cell types are affected by reduced reelin expression\nand/or CPO exposure.\nIn summary, our findings show measurable effects of re-\nducing reelin expression or early exposure to an organophos-\nphate pesticide, but little exacerbation of phenotypes when\nboth variables are combined. These results do not support the\ninteraction of the reelin signalling pathway and organophos-\nphate pesticides in the generation of ASD, but suggest that\neach factor has the potential to disrupt specific aspects of\nnervous system function independently and in an oppo-\nsite fashion. Thus, when combined, phenotypes generated\nby each variable independently serve to restore behavioural\nand anatomical alterations in mice. While genetic and en-\nvironmental factors are widely thought to act in concert to\ngenerate neurodevelopmental disorders, the specific combi-\nnation of decreased reelin gene expression and CPO exposure\nappear not to function together in mice to generate the be-\nhavioural or anatomical changes similar to those appearing\nin ASD in humans.\n"
