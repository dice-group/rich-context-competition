Despite higher\nhuman population densities in rural areas, and more rapid conversion of forest to\nfarmland, much less is known about crop raiding in Asia than in Africa. Over\n14 months, we identified perceived and actual crop pests, and their patterns of crop\nraiding from farmland in and around Kerinci Seblat National Park, Sumatra.\nFarmers named either the wild boar Sus scrofa (80%) or the pig-tailed macaque\nMacaca nemestrina (20%) as the two most destructive crop pests. From 5125 crop\nraids by 11 species of mammal, most raids were indeed made by the wild boar\n(56%) and the pig-tailed macaque (19%). For all species combined, temporal crop\nraiding peaks were positively correlated with periods of high rainfall. Spatially,\nmost crop raids occurred nearest to the forest edge and the local guarding\nstrategies used were ineffective. However, raids by wild boars were more extensive\nthan raids by pig-tailed macaques, which caused much greater crop damage (73%)\nthan wild boars (26%), contrary to farmers' perceptions. Our research suggests\nthat alternative mitigation strategies need to be trialed over dry and rainy seasons\nto identify the most effective strategies and that guarding effort should be\nincreased during the rainy seasons and tailored towards specific crop raiding\nspecies based on their unique spatial patterns.\n",

The individual economic losses\nsuffered from crop raiding can be relatively high in develop-\ning countries, because farmers are poor and rarely compen-\nlosses can make communities antagonistic and intolerant\ntowards wildlife, which can result in retribution killing of\nproblem species as well as undermining and impeding\nconservation strategies (Nyhus, Tilson & Sumianto, 2000).\nHowever, in order to mitigate this form of human\u00adwildlife\nconflict more effectively, it is first necessary to understand\nthe temporal and spatial factors that predict crop raiding,\nand the effectiveness of current guarding strategies (Sitati\nalso necessary to identify correctly those species that cause\nthe greatest amounts of crop damage, because farmers'\nperceptions of the most notorious crop pests may be\ninfluenced by factors other than crop damage (Naughton-\nTo date, most research on crop damage by wildlife has\nbeen conducted in Africa (Hoare, 1999a; Naughton-Treves,\net al., 2003). Apart from studies of crop raiding by Asian\nby wildlife has been little studied in Asia (Sekhar, 1998; Rao\net al., 2002), particularly outside India. Yet, rural human\npopulation densities tend to be higher, and clearance of\nforest for agriculture is more extensive, in Asia than in\nAfrica (Achard et al., 2002). In turn, both these factors are\nlikely to lead to escalating incidents of crop raiding in the\nfuture. Furthermore, case-specific studies are needed from\nfarmland bordering different habitat types, with different\npotential crop pests, as these may also influence crop raiding\npatterns and, therefore, the appropriate mitigation strate-\nan important insight into the capacity of wildlife to use\nagroforest landscapes, which will become increasingly com-\nThe situation around Kerinci Seblat National Park\n(KSNP), on Sumatra, Indonesia, illustrates the problem\nwell: it is a large protected area with extensive tracts of\nforest that has been extensively converted around its edges,\nand also inside its borders, to farmland by low-income\nsubsistence farmers. Furthermore, these farmers have strong\nperceptions of those species that cause most damage, which\nare often targeted through retribution killings (Linkie et al.,\n 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation c\nIn this paper, we aim to identify perceived and actual crop\nraiding patterns by mammals 45 kg, by investigating (1)\nfarmers' perceptions of wildlife as crop pests, (2) temporal\npatterns of crop raiding by species and by crop type, (3)\nspatial patterns of crop raiding by species, (4) extent of crop\ndestruction by species and (5) perceived versus actual\npatterns of crop raiding.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy area\nThe study was conducted in a conglomerate of villages\nknown as Air Dikit, bordering the southern end of the\nthat supports a western lowland forest type among the most\nthreatened habitats in Indonesia (Laumonier, 1994; Holmes,\n2001). In Air Dikit, there are still small patches of degraded\nforest outside KSNP, but the landscape is dominated by a\nfarmland mosaic. Air Dikit comprises a single main village\nwith several diffuse villages, comprising a Muslim transmi-\ngrant community of Javanese descent. This community\nmoved in the late 1990s from the adjacent south Sumatra\nprovince, either through a government-sponsored pro-\ngramme or spontaneously.\nA total of 56 farms, which were between one and four\nyears old, lay within 2 km of the forest edge within Air Dikit.\nOver 14 months, actual and perceived crop raiding patterns\nwere recorded on 50 farms, after six farmers dropped out. To\navoid raising expectations, farmers were informed from the\noutset that this was an academic, not a Department of\nForestry or a conservation NGO, project from which no\nfinancial benefits or compensation would accrue. Of the 50\nfarms, 40% were previously inside KSNP. However, after the\nKSNP boundary was refined by the KS-Integrated Conser-\n56% of these 50 farms were situated inside KSNP.\nSocio-economic backgrounds of farmers,\nfarmland profiles and perceived crop pests\nOn each of the 50 farms, family size, ages and education\nlevels of respondents, and the main types of subsistence and\ncommercial crops grown were recorded. Semi-structured\ninterviews were individually administered in Indonesian to\nthe household heads (all male) of each farm to learn their\nperceptions on which factors most limit their agricultural\nsuccess, how these factors could be overcome and their\nranking of the two crop pests that worse affected them.\nFor each farm, we recorded guarding intensity as the\ncumulative number of guarding measures used, including\nfences, guard dogs, noisemakers, guard huts, guns and fires.\nThe boundary of each farm was mapped with the owner,\nusing Garmin 12 global position system (GPS) units (Gar-\nmin Corp., Ulathe, KA, USA). These data were imported\ninto ArcView v.3.2 GIS software package (ESRI Inc., Red-\nlands, CA, USA) and constructed as a single farmland data\nlayer, in which each farm was assigned a unique identity\nnumber and its area and perimeter length were calculated.\nFor each farm, the mean value for the physical features\n(proximity to forest edge, proximity to rivers, elevation,\nslope, perimeter, and farm size:farm perimeter) was ex-\ntracted. Forest cover data were derived from on-screen\ndigitizing of a radiometrically and geometrically corrected\nby the Indonesian National Coordination Agency for Sur-\nveys (1985). The digital elevation model data were obtained\nfrom the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and used to\nproduce the slope layer (Rabus et al., 2003). All spatial data\nlayers were converted into a raster format within ArcView\nand geo-referenced using the UTM 47 s coordinate system\nwithin the WGS84 datum. Finally, rainfall data for the\nfarmland region over the study period were obtained from\nthe district rainfall station managed by the Meteorological\nand Geophysical Agency of Indonesia.\nCrop raiding data collection\nTemporal and spatial patterns of crop raiding incidents were\nber 2002. Participating farmers were trained to use a\ncalendar to record daily crop raiding incidents by each\nspecies and the crop type damaged during an initial 1-month\npilot study in October 2001. The calendar was then edited\nusing farmers' comments to improve its ease of use and\nencourage their active involvement in compiling data using\nthe resulting 14-month calendar. One column allowed for\ndaily entries of crop raiding incidents by nine mammals\n45 kg: wild boar Sus scrofa, sambar Cervus unicolor, red\nmuntjac Muntiacus muntjak, mouse deer (Tragulus sp.),\nporcupine Hystrix brachyura, pig-tailed macaque Macaca\nnemestrina, long-tailed macaque Macaca fascicularis,\nbanded langur Presbytis melalophos and sunbear Helarctos\nmalayanus. Another column allowed daily entries of raids by\nother species.\nTo avoid over-reporting of crop damage by farmers (Siex\n& Struhsaker, 1999) and to maintain consistency in the\naccuracy and quality of the data collected, three to four\nenumerators visited each farm every 2 days throughout the\n14 months to check the calendars and verify any conflicting\nreports with the farmers by visiting the crops to check the\ndamage and identify secondary signs, including prints, bite\nmarks, faeces and hair, associated with the culprit species.\nThis reduced problems with misreporting of any species that\nhad only passed through the farmland without crop raiding\nTo obtain information on the extent of crop destruction\nby the different species, a random subset of the 50 farms was\nselected each week over a 5-month period from November\ndamaged was measured directly in square metres (m2).

The continuous data\nwere logarithmically transformed to reduce the likelihood of\nextreme results having a disproportionate influence on the\noverall dataset.\nTo identify the perceived crop pests, the percentage of\nfarmers that ranked each wildlife species as either the first or\nsecond worst pest was calculated. Next, to enable compara-\ntive analyses of crop raiding patterns between months with\nunequal numbers of days, we calculated the average number\nof crop raids per day, referred to hereafter as `monthly crop\nraiding frequency'. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient\n(rs\n) was used to determine whether there was a relationship\nbetween monthly rainfall patterns, either directly or with a\n1-month lag period, and monthly crop raiding frequency,\nfor all wildlife species individually and combined. Spear-\nman's rank correlation coefficient was also used to examine\npossible relationships between crop types eaten each month\nand monthly rainfall patterns.\nTo investigate spatial patterns of crop raiding, the number\nof crop raids on each farm was calculated over 14 months. A\nstepwise multiple linear regression analysis was then used to\ndetermine which combination of spatial factors best explained\nspatial crop raiding frequency for all wildlife species com-\nbined, and for the most frequent crop raiding species indivi-\ndually. The factors included in the analysis were based on\nand comprised mean proximity to forest edge and to rivers,\nelevation, slope, farm size, farm perimeter, farm size:farm\nperimeter and guarding measures. The performance of the\nmodel was evaluated by calculating the r2 value, and the\npresence of spatial autocorrelation in the model was tested\nby calculating Moran's I statistic using Crime-Stat v.1.1\n(N. Levine and Associates, Annadale, VA, USA). Correlation\ncoefficients were used to test for problems with collinearity\n(correlations between independent variables).\nA Mann\u00adWhitney U-test was performed to determine if\nthere was any difference in the extent of crop damage\nbetween the two most prolific crop raiding species. Finally,\nthe relationship between each farmer's perceptions of the\nmain crop pests and the species that were recorded as crop\nraiding most frequently on their farm over 14 months was\ndetermined by performing an independent-samples t-test.\nResults\nSocio-economic backgrounds of farmers,\nfarmland profiles and perceived crop pests\nThe socio-economic backgrounds of farmers differed little\nacross participating farms.

Farmers grew their crops for subsistence (56%)\nand commercial (44%) purposes. Among the subsistence\ncrops edible to wildlife species, all farmers grew rice and\ncassava for their main crops, while banana, chili, maize,\npapaya, eggplant and water spinach were among the other\nsubsistence crops. The main commercial crops grown were\ncoffee (62%), patchouli (18%) or a combination of both\n(20%) crops, which are unpalatable to most mammal species.\nMost farmers thought that cutting down the forest would\nincrease flooding (94%), soil erosion (88%) and attacks\nfrom insect crop pests (66%). However, farmers thought\nthat other factors were more detrimental to their livelihoods,\nand that agricultural success was limited by (1) wildlife crop\nraiding (90%), (2) a decrease in market prices for cash crops\n(43%) and (3) a long distance to the nearest market (37%).\nMost farmers (70%) were generally unsure about how they\ncould overcome wildlife crop raiding, while no farmer stated\nretribution killings as a control measure. Some farmers\n(30%) thought that guarding their farms might reduce crop\nraiding.

Farms closest to the forest edge were most\nfrequently raided by wild boar, pig-tailed macaque and\nporcupine individually and by all species combined (Table\n4; Fig. 2a\u00add), while other physical factors or guarding\nmeasures had no effect.

Overall, each\nproblem species differed in their preference for crop matur-\nity.

This study was not\nable to assess fully the socio-economic consequences of the\nobserved patterns of crop raiding, which remains an im-\nportant gap in much research on human\u00adwildlife conflict,\neven where the topic has been more widely researched\n(Conover, 2002). However, determining the spatio-temporal\npatterns of crop raiding (Sitati et al., 2003) has proven\nsufficient in some areas of Africa to establish trials for\nmitigating crop raiding (Sitati & Walpole, 2006).\nIn the tropics, the temporal relationship between crop\nraiding, rainfall and forest fruiting patterns is complex and\npoorly understood (Chiyo et al., 2005). However, this study\nfound strong seasonality in the temporal patterns of crop\nraiding for all crop pests combined and for the main pests\nindividually. Crops were most vulnerable to raiding during\nthe rainy season. As with elephant crop raiding patterns in\nsouthern Sumatra (Nyhus et al., 2000), the main crop staple\nof rice was raided more often in Air Dikit during the wetter\nmonths, when the crop was ripe. In contrast, cassava crops\ndo not ripen seasonally and were raided throughout the year\nwithout any relation to rainfall patterns, as also shown in\nsouthern Sumatra (Nyhus et al., 2000). This would suggest\nthat crop raiding patterns in Sumatra may be determined by\nthe seasonal ripening of nutritious crops rather than by a\nscarcity of forest fruit food sources at particular seasons\nbe needed to prove which explanation is correct.\nSpatial patterns of crop raiding in the tropics are less\ncomplex and more clearly understood. While Hill (1997)\nfound that the factors best explaining spatial patterns of\ncrop raiding varied between different wildlife species in\nUganda, most other studies have found that proximity to\nforest edge, or probable surrogates, is the single most\nimportant explanatory factor (Jhala, 1993; Studsr\u00f8d &\nPaterson, 2001). In Air Dikit, crop raiding was also mostly\nconfined to farmland closest to the forest edge, probably\nbecause of the barrier created by the agricultural landscape\n(Hoare & du Toit, 1999) and the crop pests' need for a forest\nrefuge. However, mapping the crop raiding patterns\nrevealed that wild boar raids were more extensive than\npig-tailed macaque raids.\nThe patterns of crop raiding by pig-tailed macaques\nappear similar to those of African elephants in that they\nwere not widespread and inflicted relatively large losses on\nfarmers (Sitati et al., 2003). Being a frugivore, pig-tailed\nmacaques predominantly raided mature fruit crops (papaya\nand banana). Crop raids on mature rice crops, which were\ngrown in all farms, may have allowed pig-tailed macaques to\nincrease their foraging efficiency by reducing the amount of\ntime spent travelling to different food sources. In contrast to\npig-tailed macaque crop raiding patterns, wild boars entered\nfarms more frequently to raid crops, but caused significantly\nless damage, both per foray and overall. This was probably\ndue to the wild boar's catholic diet, as reflected by its\ntargeting crops at all stages of maturity. If this study had\nincluded crop raiding by small animals (birds, rodents and\ninsects) then crop raiding would probably have been much\nmore extensive and destructive (Naughton-Treves & Treves,\nFarmers' perceptions of the damage caused by different\ncrop pest species could include metrics such as economic\nvalue (e.g. average quality of the crop damaged and\ntime invested in cultivating the crop) and opportunity costs\n(e.g. children not attending school to guard family farms\ninstead), as well as the frequency and extent of raiding\nand maturity of crop damage measured in this study.\nTherefore farmers' perceptions of damage and our measure\nof the extent of damage may not be strictly comparable.\nNevertheless, it is interesting to note that the farmers\nin Air Dikit perceived the wild boar to be the crop pest\nthat worse affected them, but this did not correspond with\nthe observed patterns of crop damage on their farm.

Linkie et al.\ndifference in the perceived and the recorded crop pests\nillustrates a need to investigate community perceptions\nassociated with crop damage (Siex & Struhsaker, 1999). In\ncomparison with the pig-tailed macaque, the propensity of\nthe wild boar to raid crops more frequently and to raid more\nstaple crops may have led farmers to describe wild boar as\nthe worst crop pest in Air Dikit, despite the fact that pig-\ntailed macaques caused more damage overall. In contrast,\nresearch from Uganda found that olive baboons Papio\ncynocephalus, which caused the most cumulative damage,\nwere considered by farmers as worse crop pests than red-\ntailed monkeys Cercopithecus ascanius, which raided most\nfrequently (Naughton-Treves, 1997). Wild boars may also\nhave received a disproportionate amount of the blame for\ncrop damage because they were more conspicuous as a\nconsequence of their frequent and widespread raiding.\nSimilarly in Zanzibar, negative attitudes toward red colobus\nmonkeys Procolobus kirkii may have been linked to farmers\nwrongly accusing these monkeys of damaging bananas,\nwhich was actually caused by the smaller and less conspic-\nuous Sykes monkeys Cercopithecus mitis that often inter-\nmingle with red colobus monkeys. The farmers' main\ncomplaint was on the negative impact of red colobus\nmonkey coconut consumption, but this species actually\nforaged on immature coconuts, which were actually asso-\nciated with higher harvests, possibly due to a pruning effect\nThe few guarding measures used in Air Dikit were\nineffective in reducing crop raiding, although by using them\nfarmers presumably perceived them as having some\nN\nr\nKSNP\nAir\nDikit\nCrop raiding\nincidents\nForest\nKSNP border\n(a) (b)\n(d)\n(c)\ncrop raiding frequency for (a) all wildlife species combined, (b) wild boar Sus scrofa, (c) pig-tailed macaque Macaca nemestrina and\n(d) porcupine Hystrix brachyura in Air Dikit at the redefined border of Kerinci Seblat National Park (KSNP; inset).\n 2007 The Authors.

Alternative guarding methods that might be\ntrialed in conjunction with farmers include thorny shrub\nfences to prevent wild boar raids, or chili grease fences that\nhave successfully excluded African elephants from maize\nfields (Sitati & Walpole, 2006). The destructive pig-tailed\nmacaques present a more intractable problem, but commu-\nnal guarding by farmers, which is not currently practised in\nAir Dikit, may minimize their crop raiding, especially\nduring the rainy season. Trialing such alternative strategies\nover a subsequent 14-month period would enable an evalua-\ntion of their effectiveness in reducing crop raiding (Sitati &\nWalpole, 2006). More general initiatives that target all crop\npests could include the planting of edible crops (e.g. rice and\ncassava) further from the forest edge and in areas where they\ncould be better guarded.\nHuman settlements bordering protected areas in Sumatra\nreceive no tangible legal benefits from living with destructive\nwildlife, either through tourism (Walpole & Thouless, 2005)\nor through extractive use (Leader-Williams & Hutton,\n2005). However, the unsanctioned hunting of crop pests as\nprized game can be an effective defence strategy that can\nprovide, at least, some direct community benefits (Naugh-\ndo occur in farmland around KSNP, as intolerant farmers\nset snare traps, which indiscriminately trap wildlife, includ-\ning tigers (Martyr & Nugraha, 2004). However, there\nappears little killing, consumption or sale of crop raiding\npig-tailed macaques and wild boars, both of which are\nconsidered `unclean' by Muslim farmers.\nCritically, this study highlights an enduring problem\nfacing KSNP management, because the farms most heavily\nraided were illegal settlements inside the KSNP boundary\n(Fig. 2). While all farmers interviewed claimed not to know\nthat their farm was inside KSNP, most (82%) farmers were\nunaware of restrictions on opening up new farmland (Lin-\nkie, 2003). Thus, the KSNP boundary needs to be enforced\nmore vigorously to reduce farmland encroachment. At the\nsame time, this needs to be coupled with improved mitiga-\ntion of human\u00adwildlife conflict to reduce farmer hostility\ntowards wildlife, particularly of threatened species.\n"
