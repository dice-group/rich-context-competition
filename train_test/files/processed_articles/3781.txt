    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis nonexperimental, exploratory, mixed-design study used questionnaires with 167 preservice secondary teachers\nto identify prior educational experiences associated with student-teachers' inquiry understanding. Understanding was\ndetermined through content analysis then open coding of definitions of inquiry and descriptions of best-experienced inquiry\ninstruction, in terms of 23 potential learner-inquiry outcomes. Only two of seven educational-context variables related to\nunderstanding: prior experience doing a thesis or research--especially to definition quality and having taken a research-\nmethods course--especially to description quality. How definitions and descriptions of inquiry are different and similar was\nanalyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Implications for methodology, theory, and practice were presented, for example,\nresearch opportunities and research-methods training during teacher education.\n",

The secondary purpose was to discover what\neducational-background variables reported in educational\nresearch are significantly associated with this understanding.\nIn the course of this exploration, we determined that the lit-\nerature did not contain an adequate measure of or coding sys-\ntem for inquiry understanding. We, therefore, adapted a\npublished instrument for this purpose, focused on inquiry-\nlearning outcomes.\nInquiry and inquiry instruction have been part of substan-\ntial teacher-education curriculum revision, especially but not\nexclusively in the sciences (e.g., European Commission,\nDirectorate-General for Research, Directorate L--Science,\nEconomy and Society, 2007; National Council for the Social\nStudies, 2010; National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,\n2000; National Governors Association Center for Best\nPractices, Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010;\nhas qualitatively and quantitatively explored secondary pre-\nservice teachers'understanding of inquiry and inquiry instruc-\ntion from a constructivist learning view. Prospective secondary\nteachers should acquire conceptual, situational, and proce-\ndural knowledge of inquiry instruction in school subjects.\nSuch knowledge cannot only be conceptual to transform it into\nstrategies for learning how to inquire independently.\nWe inferred inquiry understanding separately from pre-\nservice teachers' definitions of inquiry and descriptions of\ntheir best, self-selected, prior experience with inquiry\ninstruction as students. Definitions represented conceptual\nknowledge of key conceptual elements of inquiry.\nDescriptions represented tacit knowledge and awareness of\nthe experience-grounded concepts, situations, and proce-\ndures that might help generate or elaborate inquiry-based\ninstruction.\nOur central information source was the student-teachers\nthemselves who, in their own words, defined inquiry and\ndescribed what they had listed as the best example of inquiry\ninstruction they recalled from their formal education.\nLiterature Review\nWe found only one existing but unpublished instrument\n(Curry-Sumrall, 2010) intended to directly measure teachers'\nknowledge of inquiry and implementation of inquiry instruc-\ntion, but its focus was on elementary schools, replies were\n1McGill University, Montreal, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nBruce M.

Shore1\n Keywords\ninquiry instruction, understanding inquiry, evaluating inquiry understanding, preservice teachers, teacher education, student-\nteacher background\n2 SAGE Open\ngrouped and categorized into internally diverse categories, and\ndata generated were focused on science and unrelated to other\nvariables. The inquiry literature about secondary teachers has\nespecially addressed science, even though secondary teacher\neducation includes specialists in many other subjects.\nTherefore, creating a versatile, qualitative, and quantitative\nindicator of preservice teachers' inquiry understanding\nemerged as one of our goals, together with understanding how\nstudent-teachers might gain insight into educational inquiry.\nInquiry teaching and learning have a long history that,\naccording to Kilbane and Milman (2013), dates from Ibn al-\nHaytham's 11th-century Book of Optics. Inquiry instruction\nrefers to how to establish conditions that enable learners to\nweave together disciplinary and interdisciplinary knowledge\nand the processes of inquiry to construct relevant knowledge\n(Aulls & Shore, 2008; National GovernorsAssociation Center\nfor Best Practices, Council of Chief State School Officers,\n2010; United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural\nOrganization [UNESCO], 2008). Inquiry necessarily actively\nengages learners in acquiring and self-regulating inquiry-\nrelevant conceptual and procedural knowledge (Llewellyn,\n2005). Typically, it also builds on links to individual interests\nand knowledge. Although an inquiry approach to instruction\nshould contain these elements, it does not always do so with\nconsistent success (see multiple examples in Shore, Aulls, &\nDelcourt, 2008) and it requires considerable planning and\ndeliberate effort on the part of both novice and expert teachers\n(Reiff, 2002) at all levels of formal education.\nInquiry-based education is an important instructional\napproach because it improves student-learning outcomes and is\nvalued by students. Furtak, Seidel, Iverson, and Briggs (2012)\nconducted a meta-analysis of 37 experimental and quasi-\nexperimental science-education studies. Students from inquiry-\nbased classrooms outperformed students from traditional\nclassrooms on measures of conceptual understanding. Field,\nReis, and Sedam (2006) interviewed graduates of secondary\ngifted-education programs that included at least one original,\ninquiry-based project. Their most valued memories were about\nparticipation in these projects. If inquiry experiences form\nstrong memories, then university students should be able to\nrecall and describe the most memorable ones. Concepts are\npart of the declarative knowledge stored in memory and used to\ndefine complex schema such as inquiry as a process or as an\ninstructional approach. Hence, we anticipated that describing\npreservice teachers' understanding would entail addressing\nboth conceptual and experiential inquiry representations.\nTeaching through inquiry is challenging because enactment\nof inquiry curriculum is complex, can be done in a variety of\nways, and can be used for different lengths of time in a class-\nroom or course (Aulls, Kaur Magon, & Shore, 2015; Boyer\nCommission on Educating Undergraduates in the Research\nand setting learning goals of inquiry instruction, given the\nmany operational definitions of inquiry.This, in part, prompted\nthe U.S. National Research Council (2012) to rethink and limit\nits use of the term in the sciences and engineering.\nInquiry competence is built gradually and not always\nPetrulis (2012) asked 30 first-year, secondary education stu-\ndents about their experience and understanding of inquiry and\nresearch in relation to their overall university experience.\nDespite excitement about content that interested them, they\nexperienced challenges in searching for information, adapting\npersonal learning beliefs, the capabilities to carry out inquiry\nassignments, and coping with peer-collaboration dynamics.\nSuch learners' challenges likely also affect student-teachers.\nPossible Correlates of Inquiry Understanding\nWe selected our educational-context or background variables\nthrough an extensive cross-disciplinary search of the research\nliterature, including student-teachers'or teachers'understand-\ning or classroom use of inquiry. We conducted a second\nsearch limited to education undergraduates. We identified the\nfollowing two conditions in student-teachers' learning histo-\nries that might especially correlate with the quality of their\ninquiry understanding.\nTaking a research-methods course. Formally teaching research\nmethods is common in some disciplines. We could not locate\nresearch linking them to student-teachers' inquiry under-\nstanding, but we located a somewhat related dissertation.\nregarding whether they had taken a research-methods course\nand asked two questions about basic, nontechnical concepts\nin psychological research methodology. Students who com-\npleted a research-methods course did significantly better, but\nstill made more than 50% errors.\nCompleting a thesis or a major or honors project.Research on\nhonors programs highlighted the importance of self-directed\nand self-generated learning. Pruitt (2013) observed seven first-\nand second-year honors students completing an independent,\nopen-ended literature project with the teacher as a facilitator\nrather than authority figure. The experience encouraged stu-\ndents to recognize knowledge gaps and construct their own\ntorship studies revealed the impact of student-teachers' prior\nresearch experience on planning and enacting instruction.\nPreservice Teachers' Understanding of Inquiry\n2004) studied implementation of inquiry during student-teach-\ning in secondary school or college. These studies collectively\nsuggested gaps in empirically derived knowledge about pre-\nservice teachers'understand of inquiry and inquiry instruction,\nAulls et al. 3\neducational experiences associated with their understanding,\nand how to design research for these purposes.\npreservice teachers' essays about what makes an effective\nteacher, to explore whether effective instruction and effec-\ntive inquiry instruction were understood as basically the\nsame or different. Although mostly not previously taught\nthrough inquiry, they could distinguish between effective\ngeneral and effective inquiry instruction. In effective inquiry\ninstruction, student and teacher roles vary (Walker, Shore, &\nTabatabai, 2013), activities promote understanding, and\nknowledge is co-constructed in group discussions. Thus,\nstudent-teachers should be able to articulate important\ninquiry qualities in conceptual definitions of the nature of\ninquiry and in descriptive writing indicating what they have\nexperienced as inquiry instruction.\nDemir and Abell (2010) used classroom observations and\nsemistructured interviews to study four beginning science\nteachers' and two faculty members' inquiry understanding.\nDuring their third interview, they asked, \"In what ways if any\ndo you think your lesson used inquiry? Why?--or Why not?\"\n(p. 721). They confirmed earlier findings that teachers'\nunderstanding of inquiry-based teaching is poorly aligned\nAgain, this suggested a discrepancy between what profes-\nsional educators and practicing teachers think inquiry is. In\naddition, a multiple-case study of five secondary-science\nteachers demonstrated that \"teachers' conceptions of sci-\nence\" and presumably, by extension, inquiry, \"do not neces-\nsarily influence classroom practice\" (Lederman, 1999,\np. 916). Most preservice teachers found it difficult to bridge\nsubject-matter knowledge with pedagogy and to use content\nknowledge in ways that help all students as inquirers.\nand reflective journals from one of his elementary science-\nmethods courses. Student-teachers' words illustrated strug-\ngles defining three categories of meaning around which an\ninquiry approach to teaching could be articulated: letting go,\ngoing with students'interests, and asking the right questions.\nHayes addressed new teachers' emerging identities and roles\nas they began their teaching practices; this differed from our\nfocus but it invoked an interesting methodology with great\nattention paid to detailed descriptions, which we emulated.\nFinally, prior research on preservice teachers' experience-\nbased understanding of inquiry instruction has mostly\naddressed secondary-science instruction and largely ignored\nother subjects. We included secondary preservice teachers\npreparing to teach several subjects.\nMeasuring the Quality of Student-Teacher's\nUnderstanding of Inquiry\nCurry-Sumrall's (2010) eight-item Inquiry Definition\nChecklist was the only existing instrument we found that\nquantitatively evaluated inquiry definitions. Curry-Sumrall\ndirectly questioned how 18 elementary school teachers\ndefined inquiry and why those who could define inquiry did\nnot necessarily teach with inquiry. The checklist addressed\nmaking observations, asking questions, examining informa-\ntion sources, investigation, reviewing what is known, data\nmanipulation (gather, analyze, interpret), offering answers,\nand communicating results. If one to three items were pres-\nent, Curry-Sumrall evaluated the definition as \"Does not\ndefine inquiry,\" four to six as \"Somewhat defines inquiry,\"\nand seven or eight as \"Thoroughly defines inquiry.\" Multiple\nregression revealed no significant relations with subject-\nmatter knowledge, education level, years of teaching,\nschool, socioeconomic level, or extent of inquiry implemen-\ntation. The scale was likely insufficiently sensitive to finer\nlevel differences in definitions, and the sample was small.\nMartin-Hansen (2002) also examined inquiry definitions in\npracticing teachers' secondary-science classrooms. She\ndescribed five essential features of an inquiry classroom:\nlearner engagement with questions, importance of evidence\nresponding to questions, formulating explanations from evi-\ndence, connecting explanations to scientific knowledge, and\ncommunication and explanations. These five qualities could\nbe among the criteria sought in any good definition of\ninquiry. Therefore, we included developing a suitable evalu-\nation tool for student-teachers'inquiry understanding within\nthis study.\nMethod\nWe conducted a nonexperimental, exploratory, mixed-design\nqualitative and quantitative data were collected concurrently.\nA survey solicited quantitative inquiry-background data and\nincluded two open-ended questions to be qualitatively ana-\nlyzed. One question elicited definitions of what inquiry meant\nto participants, and the second elicited a description of the best\ninquiry instruction they reported having experienced during\ntheir formal education from the descriptions provided.\nParticipants\nThe 167 preservice student-teacher volunteers were in two\nsections of introductory educational psychology, within their\nteacher-education program at a large, Canadian, research-\nmen (32%) preparing to be secondary school teachers across\nseveral teaching disciplines. Almost half (81, 49%) were in\nEnglish language arts or second language education as their\nprogram concentration and 48 (29%) specialized in physical\neducation. Only 17 (10%) specialized in science, mathemat-\nics, or technology; 13 (8%) in social-science teaching; and\neight (5%) in the arts. All had high-school diplomas, 102\n(61%) graduated from Quebec pre-university college pro-\nexperience.\n4 SAGE Open\nProcedures\nThe university research ethics board approved the study.\nAfter a research assistant described the study to the class,\nseeking volunteers, the questionnaire was distributed to 175\npreservice secondary teachers in two course sections taught\nby one of the authors. Students started the questionnaire in\nclass where they could obtain clarification about the direc-\ntions. They had 2 weeks to complete the survey outside class\ntime and were given course-participation credit for complet-\ning it on time. Eight questionnaires (5%) were incomplete,\nand 167 completed questionnaires were analyzed.\nSection A asked about their background, including having\ndone research or a thesis and having taken a research-methods\ncourse. In Section B, we operationalized understanding\ninquiry by requesting, \"Please explain what `inquiry' means\nto you from a student's point of view.\" In Section C, we asked\nparticipants to separately describe in detail all occasions of\ninquiry they could recall in their elementary, secondary, com-\nmunity college, and university education. Student-teachers\nhad space to name the grade level and subject and briefly\ndescribe what happened in every example. Later they were\nasked to \"Go back (to the inquiry experiences listed) and\nplace an asterisk (*) in front of the example you consider the\nbest inquiry experience you had as a student.\"\nData Coding and Analyses\nWe first applied a deductive qualitative-analysis procedure by\nMayring (2000). Twenty-three conceptions of inquiry-learn-\ning outcomes in the McGill Inventory of Student Inquiry\nOutcomes\u00adStudents (MISIO-S; Saunders-Stewart, Gyles, &\nShore, 2012), that had been criterion-referenced in the litera-\nture, were used to categorize noun and verb phrases in each\nsentence of each definition and description. The items had\nbeen selected from a literature review of research reporting\nevidence of learning outcomes of inquiry instruction and of\nexistingmeasuresofinquiry-learningoutcomes.Operationally,\nThe term outcome was used to describe any change that is a\nresult of engagement in inquiry, for example, but not limited to,\nlearning content and skills, or changes in attitudes and\nmotivation. Some outcomes, for example, asking questions, are\npart of the inquiry process, but outcomes such as heightened\ncuriosity and asking more or better questions also may be\nThree items (4, 5, 6) addressing understanding were com-\nbined. Two new items were added, for mentioning data col-\nlection or doing research. The two left columns of Table 1 list\nthe 23 coding categories. We identified the modified\nThe MISIO-Sm discriminated strong and weak inquiry\ndefinitions and descriptions of approximately equal length\nthat had been selected by a panel from our research team\n(Table 2). More MISIO-Sm categories were coded in the\nstronger responses. Such discrimination was not observed\nwhen we coded responses with instruments having fewer\nmore representing specific, learner tasks in inquiry (79 in\nShore, Chichekian, Syer, Aulls, & Frederiksen, 2012).\nInductive open coding followed, of sentences in students'\nreplies defining inquiry and describing inquiry instruction\n(Corbin & Strauss, 2015). The coder compared every sen-\ntence in each definition or description with the next to deter-\nmine if they were semantically alike or different. Those that\nwere alike were initially grouped by the noun-phrase or verb-\nphrase in the responders' own written words to prevent the\ncoder from using too high a level of inference to represent\nhow they were alike. Continuing through all the passages,\nthe procedure resulted in groups of sentences or phrases\nelaborating each theme. Themes might have occurred in the\ndefinition, the description, or both. Some sentences could not\nbe categorized and did not contribute to a theme.\nWe assumed that the combination of (a) the conceptual\nrepresentation of inquiry--the definition--and (b) the situa-\ntional representation of inquiry instruction they actually expe-\nrienced and valued--the description--were evidence of their\nunderstanding of inquiry. Definitions could likely be used to\nrepresent goals for inquiry instruction. Descriptions could\nlikely represent declarative and procedural knowledge for\naccomplishing inquiry instruction, articulating knowledge\nthey might be able to use as a basis for deciding what to teach\nand how to enact inquiry instruction as a secondary teacher.\nCoding reliability.From the literature, we anticipated that\nresponses to defining inquiry and describing best inquiry\nexperiences might differ in terms of cognitive demands. To\nlink prior inquiry experiences and current inquiry knowl-\nedge, we needed a way to systematically and reliably code\nboth kinds of inquiry understanding.\nMiles and Huberman (1994) suggested independently cod-\ning 25% of statements to assure interrater reliability.Arandom-\nfor coding by a graduate student unfamiliar with the research.\nThis rater was given the MISIO-Sm code guide (Table 1, two\nleft columns) and told the purpose of the exercise. Initial agree-\nment between the two coders on all categories was 74% for the\ndefinitions. After discussing differences with the third author,\nagreement rose to 90%. For the remaining 10%, consensus was\nachieved between the second and third authors. Initial agree-\nment for the descriptions was 47%, perhaps reflecting the dif-\nficulty of coding such descriptive data. After discussing\ndifferences and asking the third author to recode some difficult\nstatements, agreement rose to 78%. The source of greatest dis-\nagreement was \"interest\" that was not among the MISIO-Sm\ncodes; we coded it \"motivation.\" Remaining final codes\nachieved consensus between the second and third authors.\nResponse length.This potential quantitative index of response\nquality was inspired by two studies in other domains. Kobrin,\nAulls et al. 5\nSAT essays; word-counts explained 39% of overall grade vari-\ndents attending a developmental-writing course. Participants\nscoring higher in reading ability and vocabulary wrote longer\ntext summaries containing significantly more ideas. Widely\nused creativity measures also use word-counts (Torrance, 2008).\nResults\nDescriptive Information\nFifty-two participants (31%) previously took a research-\nmethods course and 54 (32%) reported completing a thesis or\na major project. Twelve (1%) had both experiences. Eighty-\none (49%) were enrolled in English language arts or second\n(10%) in mathematics, science, and technology; 13 (8%) in\nsocial sciences; and eight (5%) in arts. These enrolments\nwere artifacts of scheduling; students in other programs (e.g.,\nelementary education) were enrolled in different sections of\ncompulsory educational psychology.\nParticipants remembered 925 inquiry situations over their\nyears in school (see Table 1), with 386 (42%)--the highest--\nnumbers of elementary and secondary inquiry-instruction\nexperiences were moderately correlated (r = .41, n = 154,\np = .00), as were secondary and university-level inquiry\nof reported inquiry experiences between the college and uni-\nversity levels were not significantly correlated (r = .09, n =\n151, p = .25). Student-teachers recalled and described their\nbest inquiry experience mostly at the secondary level (58,\nSeventeen participants (10%) did not respond.\nQualitative Analysis Results\nThe right six columns of Table 1 present the frequencies of\noccurrence of the 23 categories of inquiry-learning outcomes\nin student-teachers' inquiry definitions of inquiry and\ndescriptions of best-experienced inquiry instruction.\nTable 1.

To define\ninquiry, participants used 6,039 total words, ranging from\nof the responses (306, 80%) were accounted for by the five\ncodes that each contributed 10% or more of the total: #14,\ninquiry means generating questions (86, 22%); #1, acquisi-\ntion of facts or knowledge by using different sources (66,\nDescriptions.One hundred forty-eight participants assigned\n278 MISIO-Sm codes to their descriptions.

These were sel-\ndom used to define inquiry or describe enactment of inquiry\ninstruction that they recalled as their best inquiry-learning\nexperience.\nThe two most frequent categories (#14, question generation\nand #1, acquisition of knowledge from different sources)\nwere found in both definitions and descriptions (127 and\n122, respectively). Category 1 had similar frequencies for\ndefinitions (66) and descriptions (56), but #14 occurred twice\nas often in definitions (86) versus descriptions (41).\nCategories #9, problem solving, #15, motivation, and\n#21, role changes were also among the most frequently\noccurring categories overall, with frequencies of 58, 54, and\n47, respectively. However, these appeared more in defini-\ntions and seldom in descriptions.

These\nTable 2. Sample Coding of Strong and Weak Inquiry Definitions and Descriptions.\nInquiry definitions\ncategories\nBest-experienced inquiry\ndescriptions MISIO-S categories\n\"Inquiry\" does not mean just get a formal or pre-fixed\nanswer to certain pre-made questions. \"Inquiry\" is\nstimulating searching attitude and desire to learn\nand improve oneself rather than just getting simple\ninformation or knowledge only. Therefore, it involves\nthe teachers' personal integrity, personality, and\nattitude to involve the student's well-being because it\nwill initiate student's motivation to inquire and search\nfor real important things in life. Then students will put\ntheir willing and voluntary effort to discover deeper\nknowledge instead of stopping at getting the second-\nhand information only.\nThe teacher always lectured.\nHowever, we had to do a big\nassignment in his class that\nrequired us to form our own\nquestions. I went to the Ottawa\narchives in order to accumulate\nand study primary sources. I had\nto make sense of the material on\nmy own. I felt like a discoverer, or\na historian, because I had to ask\nquestions and make sense of the\npast.\nTo me, inquiry refers to an investigation. I would use\nthis word only to refer to official investigations,\nsuch as the police are conducting an inquiry into\n(someone's) death. However, as it is used in the paper\nI assume it means question asking. Do the teachers/\nprofessors encourage/discourage question asking?\nDo they allow it? Are students free to ask questions\nwhenever they have them or only at the end of class?\nTo me, this concept is fairly straightforward, but it\nhardly sticks out of mind.\nThe first 15 minutes of every day\nwere devoted to \"calm down\"\ntime. Teacher would ask us to\nthink out a \"word\" name, an event\nor concept for the next day. In\neffect this was a pre-teaching\nactivity as this inquiry was used as\na basis for introducing a subject,\nor concept which the teacher\nintroduced in the next day's class.\nNote. MISIO-Sm = modified MISIO; MISIO-S = McGill Inventory of Student Inquiry Outcomes\u00adStudents.\nAulls et al. 7\noccurred solely in inquiry-instruction descriptions. The\nremaining four categories ranged between 14 and 29 occur-\nrences in both definition and description: #3, procedural\nlearning, #7, knowledge or skill application, #8, developing\nintellectual or thinking skills, and #11, positive attitude\ntoward the subject or learning.\nThese 14 more frequently used category frequencies\nrevealed interesting patterns when compared between and\nwithin definitions and descriptions. Question generation\n(#14) and acquisition of facts and knowledge from different\nsources (#1) were the most common categories, shared by\nthe majority of secondary student-teachers as core elements\nin their understanding of inquiry as central concepts in their\ndefinitions of inquiry and also in their descriptions of good\ninquiry-instructional practices that they experienced as\nstudents.\nOther shared categories followed similar patterns but\noccurred less often. Categories #8, thinking skills, and #9,\nproblem solving focused on the development and the appli-\ncation of skills. Category 3 (learning \"how to\" inquire) was\nrelated to these because it encompasses enabling the learner\nto self-regulate their application. These three categories\nfocus on cognitive strategies and their self-regulation used to\nactively engage in inquiry alone or under teacher guidance.\nUniversity teachers often do not appear to consider these as\npart of their instructional responsibility, perhaps because\nthey usually assume them to be already developed and make\nfew attempts to teach students how to do these strategies.\nInstead they concentrate on constructing knowledge of the\nsubject-matter content rather showing students how to learn\nhow to acquire it.\nA second pattern involved categories occurring exclu-\nsively within inquiry definitions or descriptions. When a cat-\negory occurred only within definitions, but seldom or never\nin descriptions, this could imply insufficient opportunity to\nobserve inquiry enacted or learn to do it, or having tried to do\nit unsupervised. When the category occurred only within a\ndescription, perhaps it had not attained the level of abstrac-\ntion of a concept or cluster of concepts. Descriptions are evi-\ndence of student awareness of a category, but their meaning\nis assumed to be tacit rather than explicit. Tacit knowledge is\nless easily accessed from memory to be used to acquire new\nknowledge without assistance or outside the context in which\nit was experienced. When a category represents a concept\nused in a definition, it might have associated strategies that\nare not evident in the description of best-experienced inquiry\ninstruction. Alternatively, it could be a token for a word used\nas a concept. It can be repeated, but its meanings are not\nnecessarily clear. The pattern differences obtained through\nqualitative analysis were also examined quantitatively.\nQuantitative Analysis Results\nWe compared all 23 category frequencies for participants\nwho had done research, taken a research-methods course, or\nboth (see Table 3). Categories #14, question generation, and\n#1, acquiring facts from multiple sources, were most fre-\nquently cited by all three groups. Categories 6, relate con-\ncepts, and 21, role changes, were in the definitions but not\nthe descriptions; Categories 10, learning to learn, 17, develop\nexpertise, 22, data collection, and 23, having done research\nwere present in the descriptions but not the definitions. At\nleast one student-teacher in each group cited Category 4,\nunderstanding.\nThe frequency of cited inquiry-learning outcomes\n(MISIO-Sm codes) in inquiry definitions and the number of\nwords used were significantly and positively correlated (r =\nresult emerged for inquiry descriptions (r = .41, n = 148, p <\nlow positive correlation between the numbers of words used\nto define inquiry and words used to describe the best inquiry\nsize R2 = .03). This finding reaffirmed our assumption that\nthe definition and description tasks tapped different cogni-\ntive processes underlying inquiry understanding.

A\nsignificant 2 was obtained, between having taken a research-\nmethods course and the number of MISIO-Sm outcomes\nfound in descriptions of the best inquiry-instruction partici-\n( = .21) was medium.\nTo follow-up potential differences in the patterns of codes\nbetween inquiry definitions and descriptions, we conducted\nthree other statistical analyses. First, we conducted a 2 on\nthe frequency columns of Table 1 for definitions and descrip-\ntions. The patterns were significantly different, 2(22, N =\nSecond, given that these distributions might be associated\nwith prior research experiences or having studied research-\nmethods, we divided our sample into three: student-teachers\nwho had done a thesis or research project, who had taken a\nresearch-methods course, and who did neither (we omitted\nthose who had done both). First, we repeated the 2 calcula-\ntion of the three groups by the 23 code categories, separately\nfor the definitions and descriptions. The 2 statistics were\nnonsignificant; therefore, differences between, not within,\nthe groups warranted most attention.\nWe then compared the proportions of the two most fre-\nquent response codes for definitions and descriptions in turn,\nfor the thesis and research-methods groups combined versus\nthose who had neither prior experience. These two most fre-\nquent codes in both cases were #14 (generating questions)\n8 SAGE Open\nand #1 (acquiring facts using different sources), but in\nreverse order.\nthe research-experienced group defined inquiry instruction\nas acquiring facts from different sources (code #1), versus 15\n(31%) of those who had neither experience. The significant\nsign test probability was p = .009. The same numbers defined\ninquiry instruction as generating questions (code #14), p =\n.009, also significant. In contrast, neither comparison was\nsignificant for the definitions. In articulating descriptions of\ninquiry instruction, respondents having either thesis or\nresearch-methods course experience versus neither, despite\nsimilar patterns of frequencies across the 23 codes, used\nmore categories and differed uniquely and significantly in\ntheir proportions of the two most frequently assigned codes.\nWe also checked five other background variables sug-\ngested in the literature (numbers of inquiry experiences\nacross schooling levels; grade and subject in which best\ninquiry experiences occurred; having completed a creative\nproject such as writing a play or song; having designed a cur-\nriculum, software, or other product; and months of preser-\nvice teaching experience), but none was related to the quality\nof inquiry understanding reflected in either definitions or\ndescriptions.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nOur first purpose was to examine the words used by second-\nary preservice teachers to reveal their conceptual and experi-\nential understanding of inquiry and inquiry instruction. A\nsecondary but prerequisite purpose was to develop an instru-\nment and coding system that could reflect their inquiry\nunderstanding.\nMeasuring the Quality of Inquiry Understanding\nSecondary preservice teachers' understanding of inquiry\nand inquiry instruction can be usefully evaluated by coding\nquestionnaire replies in terms of learners' inquiry-related\noutcomes. All codes were assigned at least once, but there\nwas wide variation in the frequency with which each was\nfound in secondary student-teachers'responses to requests to\ndefine inquiry or describe inquiry instruction. We concluded\nthat the MISIO-Sm codes in Table 1 can be used effectively\nto describe the concepts and instructional situations that sec-\nondary preservice teachers associate with inquiry.\nThe MISIO-Sm is built around student inquiry-learning\noutcomes with which preservice teachers are likely familiar\nand engaged, and it has a sufficiently wide range of items to\nenable detection of subtle inquiry-category differences such\nas detecting changes in teachers' and students' roles or col-\nlecting data from multiple sources. It might usefully be fur-\nther explored as a measure of learning about inquiry over the\ncourse of teacher education and early-career experiences.\nThe MISIO-Sm codes were sensitive to differences between\npreservice teachers' responses considered strong or weak.\nEach was moderately correlated with the total word-count of\nthe replies. However, correlations were low between catego-\nries underlying the definitions versus the descriptions. This\nresult suggests that secondary preservice teachers' under-\nstanding of inquiry occurs separately at conceptual and expe-\nriential levels. These two kinds of inquiry understanding\ninclude some common and some unique inquiry categories\nand therefore are not measuring the same thing: Providing a\ndefinition of inquiry or providing a description of an inquiry\nevent are not equivalent tasks, at least for a student-teacher.\nEducational Background Variables Uniquely\nRelated to Inquiry Understanding\nWhat makes inquiry stick? In general, secondary student-\nteachers understand inquiry and inquiry instruction to mean\ngenerating questions and acquiring new knowledge and facts\nfrom multiple sources. Next, they understand inquiry to\ninclude learning problem-solving skills, enhancing motiva-\ntion, and changes in students' and teachers' roles. Finally,\ninquiry was understood as improving understanding, doing\nresearch, collecting data, and building thinking skills. More\nTable 3. Learner-Inquiry Code Frequencies for Each Category According to Research-Training History.\nDefinitions\n Took research-methods\ncourse\nDescriptions\n Took research-methods\ncourse\naSee Table 1.\nAulls et al. 9\nsophisticated learning outcomes such as developing exper-\ntise, emulating professionals, learning how to learn, and\nenhancing self-efficacy were rarely coded. The recognition\nof role changes was, however, insightful and reflected\nknowledge that research has deemed critical to successful\nenactment of inquiry instruction (Aulls et al., 2015).\nSecond, having done a thesis or other research project and\nhaving taken a research-methods course were related to sec-\nondary student-teachers' understanding of inquiry and\ninquiry instruction. The relatively low frequencies of indi-\nvidual students whose replies invoked three or more of the\n23 codes is not encouraging; however, it is consistent with\nexperience was associated with inquiry use in just one of his\nsecondary preservice teachers'first year teaching secondary-\nscience classes. Crawford (1999) also reported a case study\nthat came to the same conclusion.\nHands-on, direct experience with inquiry as teaching and\nlearning might help student-teachers recall salient and more\nsophisticated elements of inquiry instruction. This is consis-\ntent with Meijer's (2007) observation that a research-methods\ncourse improved but did not guarantee inquiry understanding.\nIt is also compatible with the comparison by Syer, Chichekian,\nShore, and Aulls (2012) in which student-teachers who had\ninquiry experiences as teachers were directly comparable with\npsychology undergraduates who had done a major research\nproject in recognition and valuing of major elements of doing\ninquiry. However, the education students were better able to\narticulate the inquiry as a pedagogical approach.\nCategories of learner outcomes associated with inquiry as\npedagogy are expressed more explicitly in descriptions than\nin definitions. Taking a research-methods course was a better\npredictor than past research experience of a quality inquiry-\ninstruction description. However, the quality of abstract or\nconceptual definitions of inquiry is related to having had\nprior direct instruction in how to do research.\nResearch-methods courses benefit from being recent in\nstudents'recollections. Such courses build vocabulary to talk\nwith others about inquiry and help cast student-teachers, per-\nhaps vicariously, into authentic roles that emulate the work\nof teachers or their professors. Having learned about research\nmethods in a course might enhance the ability to recognize\ninquiry in one's own learning history. Skills and dispositions\nlearned, such as choosing a topic based on personal interest,\nacting as a professional creator of new knowledge, and eval-\nuating evidence, could become connected to the outcomes\nthey remembered from past inquiry experiences. If the course\nis in education, the links could be even stronger.\nThird, generating definitions and descriptions are not only\ndifferent cognitive tasks, but they also constitute different\nstudent resources for preservice teachers to build an under-\nstanding of inquiry useful to growth in teaching.\nThree types of student-inquiry outcomes are most fre-\nquent when preservice teachers define or describe inquiry,\nnamely, acquisition of facts or knowledge using different\nsources, problem-solving skills, and question-generation. All\nthree were common to both definitions and descriptions of\ninquiry. Question generation was the most frequent outcome\ncited in the definitions and third in the descriptions. Problem\nsolving was third in definitions, fourth in descriptions. The\nfact that they all occur in students'current knowledge as well\nas descriptions of past instructional experiences in school\naffords evidence of their face validity. Our interpretation is\nthat preservice teachers respond at a very concrete level\nwhen challenged by the request to conceptually define\ninquiry, but they are able to articulate broader generaliza-\ntions about inquiry when they can draw on vivid, well-\nremembered, personal experiences.\nFinally, total word-counts do not indicate the content or\nquality of an individual's understanding of inquiry, so they\nshould not be used for individual evaluations, to track learn-\ning, or to compare definitions or descriptions.\nLimitations and Opportunities for Further Study\nThis study was ex-post-facto and a snap-shot of student-\nteachers in their last year of coursework toward secondary-\nteaching certification. Richer data could be available from a\nlongitudinal design more like Crawford's (1999) or\nWindschitl's (2002), but with a purposeful sample that\nincludes student-teachers with a range of experiences in\nterms of research and research-related courses. We did not\nfollow their progress from acceptance into university to\ngraduation as a teacher and into professional practice, as\ndone by Chichekian, Shore, and Tabatabai (2016), who also\ntriangulated other data, such as interviews and focus groups.\nUsing the coding categories identified in this study,\nresearchers could use a larger and random rather than a pur-\nposeful sample to determine how generalizable the results of\nthe study might be. The use of open coding might also gener-\nate additional distinguishing categories among the defini-\ntions and descriptions.\nImplications for Theory and Research\nA future model or theory of inquiry instruction should focus\non the knowledge bases of preservice teachers and on just\ntwo background variables, research-methods training and\nresearch experiences. Social-constructivist learning theory\n(Vygotsky, 1978) seems barely articulated in preservice\nteachers' inquiry understanding. Focusing on student-teach-\ners' understanding and instructional use of their own inquiry\nexperiences might be an important early step toward being\nable to conceptualize rich inquiry experiences for their own\nfuture students.\nThat student-teachers' understanding of the nature of\ninquiry is revealed differently in the quality of general defi-\nnitions versus the quality of descriptions of well-recalled\nprior inquiry experiences does not mean that the same dis-\ntinction characterizes experienced teachers. Rather, the\ndistinction might especially help describe the trajectory from\nnovice to expert inquiry teacher. Chichekian et al. (2016)\nspecifically addressed this progression, but with regard to\nself-efficacy for inquiry instruction rather than understand-\ning of inquiry.\nImplications for Practice\nIt is feasible in the selection and education of secondary\nteachers to provide both research experiences and research-\nmethods courses in close proximity to the rest of the teacher-\neducation program. This idea is well established in\nundergraduate education generally (Boyer Commission on\nEducating Undergraduates in the Research University, 1998).\nThe conceptually based research-methods course is the eas-\nier of the two to arrange and require. It has the most salient\nlinks to more sophisticated inquiry understanding and prac-\ntices. It can also engage students in inquiry projects.\nHow student-teachers conceptualize inquiry instruction is\nlikely connected to what they actually do during their formal\neducation. Dewey recommended that teacher-education pro-\ngrams have a laboratory school (Tanner, 1997) to facilitate\nimmersing preservice teachers in a culture of simultaneous\ninquiry learning, teaching, and research. Student-teachers\noften (but not always) regard practicum experiences as the\nmost valuable part of teacher education (Melynchuk, 2001).\nNotably, none of our participants reported his or her best\ninquiry-instructional experiences to have occurred during\nstudent-teaching. Instead, they were associated with their\nexperiences in elementary and secondary education.\nTeaching student-teachers about inquiry conceptually is\nprobably better done, at least initially, through reference to\nthe design and enactment of their own inquiry instruction.\nThesis-like work and research-methods courses can be\ndesigned to further build these opportunities into teacher-\neducation programs. It seems unnecessary to worry about\nwhat earlier inquiry experiences student-teachers had, in\nwhat subjects, or at what level of education, nor to be primar-\nily concerned about the nature of inquiry experiences in\n\"content\" courses at the university level.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAulls, M.
