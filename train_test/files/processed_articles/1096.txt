Nonmetropolitan\ncounties with irrigated farming have been more successful than those without irrigation. However, overuse of groundwater and rising energy costs\nfor irrigation affect economic margins and the ability to sustain environmental integrity. Long-term projections of agricultural productivity must\nbalance recent stability with the risks posed by reduced irrigation, higher energy prices, disruptive demographic changes, and further loss of\nenvironmental integrity.\nKeywords: biogeochemical modeling, land-use change, population, Great Plains, agricultural economy\na set of fairly smooth trajectories. These paths do not always\ngo in the same direction. What is striking to us, however, is\nthat despite the risks, there have been few abrupt changes of\ndirection, and the two points of punctuation that are best\nknown (the drought and depression of the 1930s and the\nincrease in prices in the 1970s) had consequences that,\nalthough lasting,were eventually incorporated into a relatively\nsmooth line of change.The persistence of extensive cropping,\nfor the major crops, falsifies the direst predictions of the\ncatastrophists.\nOur analysis focuses on long-term patterns in popula-\ntion, agricultural production, and economic activity. In the\nUS Great Plains, human population data show continued\nregional growth,but detailed data show finer-grained patterns,\nsuch as out-migration from the most agricultural counties and\nin-migration to metropolitan (metro) counties (those with\na population of 50,000 or more) and near-metro counties.\nThese population movements reflect both national demo-\ngraphic trends and the changing nature of agriculture,whereby\ntechnological change leads to reduced labor demand. The\ndecrease in total population and the increase in population\naging since 1930 in nonmetropolitan (nonmetro) counties\nwhere dryland agriculture predominates reflect a weak envi-\nronmental signal in the population data (Gutmann et al.\n2005). The economic status of Great Plains agriculture has\nbeen steadier than many would have expected, with total\ninflation-adjusted gross income slightly higher and net income\nsomewhat lower over the long term because of increased\nanimal production, growing government payments, and\nhigher crop yields.\nResearchers on both sides of this argument would agree that\nregional natural ecosystems have been disrupted and de-\ngraded by extensive crop and livestock production on the\nplains, yet they would probably disagree about whether this\nthreatens the long-term trajectory of agriculture. It is useful\nto note that during much of the period when extensive agri-\ncultural expansion took place in the Great Plains,climate con-\nditions were highly conducive to cropping systems. Given\nhistoric cyclical patterns of drought in the region, current\nagricultural practices may not be appropriate if these drought\nconditions resume and persist, as has occurred in the past\nDuring the past five decades, the Great Plains region has\ndisplayed long-term differential patterns for three types of\ncounties: metro counties, dryland nonmetro counties with\nminimal irrigation,and nonmetro counties with substantial\nirrigation. We separated the counties into these categories\ncensus data (figure 1 shows the location of these counties\nwithin the Great Plains). Metro counties include those that\nwere within a US Census\u00addefined metropolitan area in 1990.\nThere was little change in the inclusion of counties in metro-\neffectively represent the attributes of metro counties at the end\nof the 20th century.Irrigated nonmetro counties are those with\ngated,harvested cropland,and with a total harvest of irrigated\ncrops equal to more than 25% of the county's total cropped\narea,as reported in the 1997 agricultural census.There is some\nyear-to-year variation in the amount of land irrigated,but the\nselection of counties using 1997 criteria produces results that\nare not significantly different from those using other years,\nties constitutes nearly 74% of all irrigated cropland in the\nregion, substantiating our categorization. We describe the\nremaining counties as dryland nonmetro.\nAlthough this division of counties emphasizes conditions\nat the end of the 20th century,we believe it is the most effective\nway to capture changes in the region and to balance past\nconditions with future prospects.This categorization is in con-\ntrast to other ways in which US counties have been divided,\nand it yields a different picture of the agricultural and demo-\ngraphic characteristics of the region's counties.Our approach\nrecognizes that there is great diversity within a region as\nlarge as the Great Plains, but that a simple classification has\nthe potential to produce important insights.Although the raw\nmaterials for these data are well known, they must be as-\nsembled and analyzed to help understand the past, present,\nand future of this environmentally sensitive region.\n \nFigure 1. Counties within the Great Plains region. We\nclassify the counties into three categories: Metro counties\nIrrigated nonmetro counties have 50,000 acres (about\n20,000 hectares) or more of irrigated harvest cropland,\nwith more than 25% of the total harvested cropland irri-\ngated. Dryland nonmetro counties are what remain, with\nneither metro nor irrigated nonmetro characteristics. The\nlargest metro area is along the Front Range of the Rocky\nMountains in Colorado. Most irrigated nonmetro coun-\nties have access to water from rivers or the deep aquifers\nof the region, primarily the Ogallala.\nCan long-term trends in population, production, and\nincome reveal the region's potential for rapid change? What\nhas the trajectory of change been in the past? If it has largely\nbeen one of smooth changes,what is the potential for abrupt\ntransformations? The answers to these questions will provide\na much better understanding of what has happened in the past,\nand some insight into what might happen in the future\n(although we recognize that predicting the future is extremely\ndifficult).\nTo perform this analysis, we assembled a comprehensive\nGreat Plains database that includes information about pop-\nulation, land use, and farm income for the region's counties\nThe data came from federal censuses of population and\nagricultural production (Gutmann et al. 1998, Gutmann\n1949 to the present are available from the US Department of\nAgriculture (USDA n.d.). To analyze net income and the\ncomponents of income, we combined data from this source\nstates. All income and price data in this article are inflation\nadjusted using the US Consumer Price Index (USDOL 2005).\nHistorical land-use patterns\nNearly 150 years ago, settlers of European origin arriving in\nthe Great Plains from other parts of the United States and\ndirectly from Europe began the process of converting what had\nbeen a sparsely populated open prairie into a checkerboard\nof fields, pastures, and towns. Their arrival transformed the\nland and the lives of its inhabitants (West 1998) but also\nshowed limits beyond which it would be difficult to venture,\nat least in terms of converting land to agricultural uses\nunlike regions farther east, where woodlands yielded to the\naxe and underwent a near-complete conversion to plowed\nfields--low precipitation and regional soil characteristics\nprevented farmers from cropping more than 70% of land in\nthe east and 25% in the west, an average of 50% overall.\nHumans have nonetheless managed to transform the land-\nscape of the Great Plains in many ways, a process that has\ncontinued into the 20th and 21st centuries with the advent of\ninorganic fertilizers and deep-well irrigation.\nThe 100-year historical patterns for land use in metro and\nnonmetro counties (figure 2) show that total farmland area\n1900, metro counties were already more developed as farm-\nland than nonmetro counties.Metro counties lost 25% of their\nfarmland loss coming from rangeland. Nonmetro counties\nstarted losing farmland in 1959,with no loss of cropland,while\nrangeland declined less than 5% since 1959.Both metro and\nnonmetro counties lost total harvested cropland from 1950\nto 1964, and then had stable levels of harvested crop area af-\nto 1964 came from reductions in harvested wheatland.Non-\nmetro irrigated and nonmetro dryland counties had similar\npatterns of decline in harvested cropland since 1950, but the\nirrigated counties lost less harvested cropland.\nThe different scales for the two components of figure 2\nreveal just how little farmland and cropland have ever been\nlocated in the metro counties, and therefore how little risk\nthere is that urbanization, and even suburbanization, will\nswallow up large amounts of agricultural land in the Great\nPlains. Although this is not the case in Front Range Col-\norado counties (Parton et al.2003),it is important to note for\nthe region as a whole. The number of metro counties in the\nregion has increased steadily since 1960, when there were\ncounties shows that residences and businesses have expanded\ninto formerly agricultural areas, but the small number of\nmetro counties, and the small amount of farmland in them,\nconfirms our point.\nPopulation\nA number of authors have suggested that the decline and\naging of the population in nonmetro Great Plains counties\npose the potential for significant problems for the long-term\nsustainability of the region (Rathge and Highman 1998,\nGutmann 2005). Population in metro, dryland nonmetro,\nand irrigated nonmetro counties increased from 1900 to\n \nFigure 2. Historical land-use patterns for (a) nonmetro\nand (b) metro counties in the Great Plains. Irrigated\nnonmetro and dryland nonmetro counties are combined\nbecause they have similar characteristics over time. Most\nagricultural land is in nonmetro counties. The differences\nin scale between metro and nonmetro counties show that\nthere is little risk of metro sprawl overwhelming agricul-\ntural land in the Great Plains.\n1930 (figure 3a). Population in dryland nonmetro counties\nin 1980.In the metro counties,population increased through-\n(47%) in the population of the whole region (irrigated and\ndryland nonmetro and metro), but after 1940, the trend re-\ndecline in the male population since 1930 caused most of the\ndecrease in total population of the dryland nonmetro coun-\nties,while female population has remained stable since 1940.\nDespite alarms about population loss,our research shows\nthat the population of irrigated and dryland nonmetro coun-\nties has stabilized and perhaps increased slightly since 1960.\nHowever,the interpretation of this finding depends on one's\npoint of view.The population of the United States has grown\nrapidly since 1945, and has become mostly urban and\nsuburban. If one's standard for the Great Plains is that it\nshould have kept up with population growth in expanding\nmetro regions,then our conclusion that the region is under-\ngoing adequate,though modest,population growth is wrong.\nIf one's point of view is that population stability and some\ngrowth is a reasonable target for a rural region that is\nrelatively far from the coasts, then stability or slight growth\nis a reasonable--and not unfavorable--conclusion.\nAging is another important concern.The proportion of the\npopulation over age 65 (figure 3b) increased during the 100-\nyear period,but after 1940,the nonmetro counties experienced\na more rapid increase than the metro counties (16% for dry-\nland nonmetro, 14% for irrigated nonmetro, and 10% for\nmetro counties in 2000). We observed similar trends in the\nproportion of the population over 55 for metro and nonmetro\ncounties (not shown).The aging of the nonmetro population\nis largely a consequence of the out-migration of the working-\nage population from agricultural communities (Johnson and\nRathge 2006). This out-migration of younger cohorts has\nrecently had the severe secondary consequence of reducing\nfertility and therefore intensifying the reduction in many\naspects of community life,especially in schools and activities\nfocused on children, which may lead to acceleration of\nfurther out-migration. It remains to be seen whether the\nrelatively steady (and relatively young) populations of coun-\nties with irrigated agriculture will avoid the loss of their\nyounger population or whether the demographic changes in\nthese counties are only slightly slower because of improved\neconomic conditions and,in the long term,these counties will\nbegin to age as others have done.\nCrop production and technology\nThe major harvested crops in the Great Plains are wheat,\nhay,corn,and cotton.Wheat is the dominant harvested crop\n(50% of the harvested land), followed by hay (20%), corn\n(15%), and cotton (4%). Cotton is grown primarily in the\nsouthern Great Plains (Texas,Oklahoma,and New Mexico).\nOther important harvested crops include barley (3%),\nsorghum (2%),and sugar beets (1%).Historical data (figure\n4a) for the production of corn, wheat, hay, and cotton show\nthat before 1945, total production of these crops was stable\nwas a dramatic increase in production for all of the major\ncorn,wheat,and hay production rose sharply from the 1950s\nto the early 1980s. The major cause of increased production\nwas improved crop yield per ha, despite the reduction in\ntions of crop technology that contributed to additional crop\nyields include greater irrigation using fossil water supplies\n(resulting in two to four times greater yields for irrigated\nthan for dryland crops in the Great Plains; Parton et al.2003),\nsupported by relatively inexpensive energy supplies for farm\noperations, increased application of inorganic fertilizer\n(figure 4c), improvements in tillage practices (Smika and\nWicks 1968) and crop varieties, greater herbicide and insec-\nticide use, and increased use of summer fallow for the wheat\nCotton production data (figure 4a) show a 400% increase\nin cotton production since 1940.

The initiation of irrigation (figure\n5a, 5b) after 1950 in the Great Plains resulted in an increase\nin soil carbon for farms using corn\u00adalfalfa rotations in the\ncentral and northern Great Plains counties, whereas irri-\ngated cotton rotations in the southern Great Plains resulted\nin substantial decreases in soil carbon.Parton and colleagues\n(2005) suggest that irrigated corn\u00adalfalfa rotations in the\ncentral and northern Great Plains have resulted in a net\ncarbon storage for the corn\u00adalfalfa system results from large\nincreases in soil carbon inputs from alfalfa roots and corn\nstover,while decreases in soil carbon for the cotton rotations\noccur because of low inputs of plant residues and elevated soil\ndecomposition rates associated with reduced water stress,\nthe latter caused by irrigation of soils with high background\nsoil temperatures in the southern Great Plains. The dryland\nnonmetro counties (figure 5c) show a pattern of slight in-\ncreases in system carbon since the 1960s, which result from\nthe transfer of cropped agricultural land to grasslands, land\nconverted to the Conservation Reserve Program, and im-\nproved crop yields resulting from advanced cultivation prac-\ntices and increased fertilizer inputs.\nDel Grosso and colleagues (2006) used the DAYCENT\nmodel to simulate county-level total N\nO gas fluxes and NO\nleaching below the rooting profile for the United States. The\nmodel simulates all of the major agricultural land uses for each\nUS county, using computer runs for each of the major land-\nuse practices, and then calculates county-level NO\nleaching\nand N\nO trace gas fluxes by weighting the results of each\nmodel run depending on the observed area represented by\neach land-use practice. The observed fertilizer inputs for\neach of the crops are included in the model runs.The regional\nN\nO gas fluxes and NO\nleaching follow similar patterns\n(figure 6),with both being low in the western Great Plains and\nincreasing rapidly eastward across North and South Dakota,\nKansas, and Nebraska. The eastward increase in NO\nleach-\ning and N\nO gas fluxes results from a general pattern of in-\ncreased cultivation: less than 30% of the land in the far\nwestern Great Plains region is cultivated, compared with\nmore than 70% of the land in the far eastern part of the\nregional land-use pattern is also associated with an increase\nin nitrogen fertilizer use going eastward across the Great\nPlains. Nitrate leaching and N\nO gas fluxes follow the same\npattern because both increase with greater cropping intensity\nand nitrogen fertilizer application.\nThe other striking pattern evident in these results is a high\nvalue for NO\nleaching and N\nO gas fluxes associated with the\nirrigated regions in the Great Plains (cf.figure 1,figure 6).The\nresults show high levels of NO\nleaching and N\nO gas fluxes\nfor irrigated regions associated with the Platte River in\nNebraska, the Arkansas River in Kansas, and the Ogallala\nAquifer in western Texas.High levels of NO\nleaching and N\nO\ngas fluxes result from the large amounts of nitrogen fertilizer\napplied to irrigated agricultural systems (see figure 4c) and\nthe use of intense soil cultivation practices.\nMarket value of agricultural products\nUS agricultural census data for the market value of agricul-\ntural products, available since 1950 (figure 7), show that the\ninflation-adjusted gross income for all agricultural products\nfollows a similar overall pattern for the metro,irrigated non-\nmetro, and dryland nonmetro counties.

Histori-\ncally,population growth has spurred agricultural development,\nproduction, and income, and it still does so at national and\nglobal levels. However, in the 21st century at the local level,\npopulation growth rarely leads to increases in agricultural\ninput or output,and population decline also has little impact\non agriculture.Conversely,agriculture has become so mech-\nanized and efficient, and salaries for agricultural work so\nlow, that growth or stability in agricultural productivity\nand income can preserve population stability but does not\nlead to growth. Metro and suburban dwellers also object to\nlivestock-oriented agricultural activities--often the most\nprofitable of agricultural enterprises--near their homes.On\nthe other hand,changes in the nonmetro population appear\nto be driven partly by changes in agriculture,which is why pop-\nulations in the irrigated nonmetro counties have remained\nlarger than those in the dryland nonmetro counties.There is\nmore farm and nonfarm work where irrigation prevails,and\nthat has helped sustain populations.\nThe connections go beyond the straightforward and eco-\nnomically driven ways that population and agriculture in-\nfluence each other.Land-use practices,many of them directly\ntied to farming, contribute to environmental change. The\ngrowth of population in the metro counties has been largely\nexogenous to the agricultural economy in recent years,but it\ndoes have an impact on agriculture. Metro and suburban\ndevelopment takes land from agriculture and water from\nirrigation. On the other hand, if forecasts of world popula-\ntion growth are correct (Tilman et al. 2001, Howarth et al.\n2002),the Great Plains could experience increases in cropland,\nproduction on existing cropland, and animal production.\nNotwithstanding these links between population and agri-\nculture, most of the changes in farming are not caused by\n \nFigure 7.

There\nis no simple synthesis that links population,agriculture,and\nenvironment in the US Great Plains, but the story told here\nshows the many ways in which these factors have come to-\ngether and shaped one another since the 19th century. Even\nif we initially separate out each factor,any conclusions we draw\nabout prospective outcomes make sense only when they are\ncombined.\nPopulation trends are in some ways the most independent\nfactor in regional change, because the population has been\ngrowing rapidly for a long time throughout the United States,\nmostly in metro regions. The Great Plains region is no ex-\nception. Metro population growth in the Great Plains could\ncontinue and may accelerate in the future. On the other\nhand, the population of the dryland nonmetro counties has\nstabilized during the last 30 years, while that of the irrigated\nnonmetro counties has increased slightly,and the proportion\nof the population over ages 55 and 65 in both dryland and ir-\nrigated nonmetro counties has grown rapidly.While this sta-\nbility is reassuring, virtually all other US populations are\ngrowing. These demographic patterns will bring substantial\nsocial change to the plains.A static, aging population will be\neven more different from the dominant metro United States\nin the future than it is now. All of these trends are likely to\ncontinue.\nData on agricultural income also show trends that have the\npotential to persist,and that pose significant challenges for the\nfuture. The dominant trend of the last 30 years has been an\nincrease in income from animal production for the non-\nmetro counties. In the metro counties, on the other hand,\nincome from animal production fell sharply and then stabi-\nlized in relation to crop production in the past 20 years.This\ntrend is likely to continue,because growing metro populations\nhave concerns about the air and water pollution produced by\nintensive animal production (Mosier et al.1997,Howarth et\nal. 2002). Income in both metro and nonmetro counties is\nalso at risk, as the ratio of net to gross income has fallen and\ngovernment payments have increased.The recent increase in\nthe cost of petroleum and natural gas will push the cost of\ninputs still higher,and the potential that government payments\nmay be reduced will lower incomes.\nPlans to develop biofuels from crop residue, and to use\ncorn to produce ethanol and oil seed to produce biodiesel\n(Barrionuevo 2006), have the potential to contribute to a\nshift in crop selection in the future and will lead to a new\nperiod of uncertainty. The irrigated agricultural counties\nhave the greatest short-term potential to respond to a higher\ndemand for corn. The dryland nonmetro counties also have\nthe potential to gain from the use of plant residues to\nproduce ethanol. At the same time, demand for corn for\nbiofuels will raise prices,which has the potential to affect live-\nstock production.Higher prices for animal feed,and for fuel\nto transport the feed to livestock and the livestock to processing\nplants,can lead to lowered incomes in the livestock sector.Ex-\npanded biofuel production could also lead to adverse envi-\nronmental impacts such as increased soil erosion and reduced\nsoil carbon.\nPotential water shortages are another major threat to the\nfuture of the Great Plains. Aquifers are declining (Kromm\ntaking water from agriculture,and climate change poses a sub-\nstantial risk, although its impacts may not all be negative\nwater shortages include improvement of dryland cropping\nfallow frequency, and more efficient irrigation methods.\nAlthough these changes are likely to be widely implemented,\nit is unclear whether improved irrigation efficiency,better crop\nmanagement practices,and reduction in plant transpiration\nlevels associated with increased atmospheric carbon dioxide\nlevels will allow crop yields to be maintained at current lev-\nels. It is likely that these and other improved agricultural\ntechniques will reduce the negative impacts of agriculture on\nthe environment. These techniques, coupled with programs\nlike the Conservation Reserve Program (which encourages\nfarmers to convert cropland to grassland), can increase car-\nbon storage and reduce N\nO soil fluxes and NO\nleaching.\nThis research draws on the assumption that there are\nmeaningful observations to be drawn from the experience of\nthe Great Plains over the past century,with special consider-\nation of the past 30 or 40 years. There are fundamental dif-\nferences in the viability of agriculture and agricultural society\nin the three areas we have defined, with metro and dryland\nnonmetro counties more likely than irrigated nonmetro\ncounties to run into problems.Irrigated nonmetro areas may\nprove vulnerable because of the increased cost of pumping\nwater from deeper reaches of the aquifer, the increased\nwater demands due to greater evapotranspiration under a\nwarmer climate,and the increased competition with human\nconsumption in metro areas for water resources.At present,\nhowever,the conditions in terms of population and produc-\ntion are not as bad as they might be, and not as bad as some\nobservers suggest.There is little recent evidence to suggest that\nthe near future will be different from the recent past, but the\nprospect of high energy costs and reduced government pay-\nments to farms may disrupt what has been a quarter-century\nof stability.The expanded use of crops for biofuel production\nhas the potential to increase rural incomes through higher crop\nprices (corn prices have increased by 175% during the last\nyear) and industrial incomes through the construction and\noperation of ethanol biorefineries.We see few indications on\nthe horizon that agricultural production will decline sharply,\nor that patterns of population change will depart radically\nof new trends in petroleum prices,the reduced availability of\nwater for irrigation, and new departures from recent demo-\ngraphic patterns are all cause for continued monitoring.\n \n"
