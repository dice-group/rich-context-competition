For instance,\nin the short run, smoking leads to poor lung functioning and\nrapid fatigue during physical activity (American Cancer Soci-\nety, 2014). Alcohol, on the other hand, causes drunkenness and\nalcohol poisoning, leading to headaches, coma, or even death\n(Fuller et al., 2013; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and\nAlcoholism, 2015). Moreover, because of the addictive\neffects, early tobacco and alcohol use leads to dependency\nlater in life, causing a high disease and premature death risk\nHowever, despite all dangers, smoking and drinking peak\nduring young adulthood (Johnston, O'Malley, Bachman, Schu-\nlenberg, & Miech, 2014; Substance Abuse and Mental Health\nServices Administration [SAMHSA], 2014).

Consequently, in this article, we aim to explore the\nhypothesis that male smoking and drinking behavior--being\nrisky physical consumption behaviors--are used as a male\nshort-term mating strategy. By means of two studies, the\nfunctioning of tobacco and alcohol use as a short-term sexual\nstrategy is explored.\nMale Risk Taking as a Sexual Strategy\nBecause of the high reproductive costs when making a poor\nmating decision (Trivers, 1972), women are selective when\nchoosing a short-term sexual partner as well as a long-term\nromantic partner (Buss & Schmitt, 1993; Li & Kenrick,\n2006). Accordingly, men are forced to strive for mating oppor-\ntunities through competitive behavior and courtship displays in\nSadalla, Groth, & Melanie, 1990). This is especially the case\nfor young men, experiencing the highest level of competition\nand the greatest variation in reproductive success (Daly &\nqualities are being displayed by men depends on women's\npreferences and on the sexual strategy that is followed (Buss,\nWhen searching for a long-term partner, women prefer a\nman who has the willingness and capacity to protect and care\nfor children. Consequently, women are attracted to kind men,\nphysically strong men, and especially men with resources and\nstatus (Buss & Schmitt, 1993; Li, Bailey, Kenrick, & Linsen-\nmeier, 2002). In short-term mating, on the other hand, a man's\ngenetic quality is most important. Accordingly, women place\ngreater value on a man's physical attractiveness (Buss &\ntrical faces and masculine features more desirable (Little,\nJones, Penton-Voak, Burt, & Perrett, 2002; Provost, Troje, &\nMen's risk-taking behavior corresponds with these female\npreferences. Both physical risk taking (Frankenhuis, Dotsch,\nKarremans, & Wigboldus, 2010; Pawlowski, Atwal, & Dunbar,\nDaly, 2004) are stimulated in a mating mind-set. Moreover,\nfindings indicate that these male risky behaviors are strategic\ncourtship displays, as men limit their risky signaling to situa-\ntions where the odds of gaining reproductive benefits are high.\nFor instance, young men are inclined to take more risks when\nexposed to a women, but only when she is attractive (Baker &\nonly uncommitted men increase their risk taking in the pres-\nence of women, while taking into account women's preferences\nIn addition, the attractiveness of risk takers depends on the\ntype of risk as well as the mating context. Corresponding with\nfemale desires, physical risk taking enhances male\nattractiveness, especially in short-term mating contexts (Bas-\nPawlowski, 2011). Moreover, in short-term sexual encounters,\nphysical risk takers are preferred over social or financial risk\ntakers (Sylwester & Pawlowski, 2011). In long-term mating\ncontexts, on the other hand, women generally prefer risk avoi-\nders (Sylwester & Pawlowski, 2011), except when it concerns\nheroic risk taking (Farthing, 2005) or moderate physical risk\ntaking, carrying less danger for the partner and children (Bas-\nTobacco and Alcohol Use as a Short-Term\nMating Strategy\nBecause of the many--short-term and long-term--negative\nhealth consequences, smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol\ncan be considered forms of physical risk taking. Given this\nphysical risk inherent to smoking and drinking, women's pre-\nference for male physical risk taking in short-term mating con-\ntexts, and the fact that men adapt their risky behavior to the\npreferences of women, we propose that smoking and drinking\nbehavior could be used by men as a short-term sexual courtship\nstrategy. Accordingly, smoking and drinking should be engaged\nin more by men having an unrestricted, short-term-oriented\nsexuality, while bringing short-term attractiveness benefits.\nIn line with these assumptions, studies show that there is a\nstrong link between drinking alcohol and engaging in casual\nsexual relationships (Grello, Welsh, & Harper, 2006; Lindgren,\nPantalone, Lewis, & George, 2009; Turchik, Garske, Probst, &\nIrvin, 2010). Similarly, recent studies indicate that the high\nparticipation of men in drinking games can be (partially)\nexplained by men's higher mating efforts and higher sexual\nmotivation (Hone, Carter, & Mccullough, 2013; Hone &\nMcCullough, 2015). Furthermore, also smoking seems to be\nrelated to following a more risky and short-term-oriented sex-\nual approach (Farid, Rus, Dahlui, Al-Sadat, & Aziz, 2014;\nLa\n\u00b0ngstro\n\u00a8m & Hanson, 2006), in which young adults putting a\nlot of effort in attracting sexual partners are more willing to\nsmoke in social situations (Jones & Figueredo, 2007). In addi-\ntion, Hill and Chow (2002) link risky drinking to reproductive\nsuccess in young men. Some studies contradict the assumed\nattractiveness benefits of heavy alcohol and tobacco use in\nmen. However, women were asked to rate these men on their\ngeneral desirability. Hence, in accordance with evolved long-\nterm female desires, no preferences for physical risk-taking\nbehavior were found (Farthing, 2005; Van Den Abbeele,\nPenton-Voak, Attwood, Stephen, & Munafo, 2015; Wilke,\nHutchinson, Todd, & Kruger, 2006). Corresponding with\nrisk-taking literature, moderate alcohol use did enhance men's\ngeneral attractiveness (Van Den Abbeele et al., 2015).\nCurrent Research\nAs scientific literature points into the direction of smoking and\ndrinking as a male short-term mating strategy, we expect men's\nsmoking and drinking frequency to affect women's perception.\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nMore specifically, we believe that a higher smoking and drinking\nfrequency will lead to a more harmful impression of a young\nman's overall behavior (Hypothesis 1). Additionally, we expect\nthat women will infer a man's short-term mating strategy from\nhis smoking and drinking behavior (Hypothesis 2). Also, tobacco\nand alcohol use will bring attractiveness benefits to young adult\nmen (Hypothesis 3). Corresponding with risk-taking literature,\nwe expect occasional smoking and drinking, being moderate\nrisky behaviors, to bring attractiveness benefits in both short-\nterm and long-term mating situations (Hypothesis 3a). However,\nheavy smoking and drinking will only bring attractiveness ben-\nefits in short-term mating contexts (Hypothesis 3b). Further-\nmore, if smoking and drinking function as a short-term mating\nstrategy because of its physical harmfulness, women's percep-\ntions will be mediated by how unhealthy and risky they perceive\na man's behavior to be (Hypothesis 4). By means of an experi-\nmental study, women's perceptions as a function of men's smok-\ning and drinking behavior were explored.\nIn addition, for tobacco and alcohol use to function as a\nshort-term sexual strategy, women's perceptions must corre-\nspond with men's actual behavior. Therefore, we expect users\nof tobacco and alcohol to have a more short-term-oriented\nmating strategy compared to nonusers (Hypothesis 5). More-\nover, we expect to find a correlation between young male\nusers' smoking and drinking behavior and their level of sexual\nunrestrictedness that matches with the findings of Hypothesis\n2 (Hypothesis 6). A follow-up study verified the sexual strategy\nof young male users and nonusers.\nStudy 1: The Perception of Male\nSmoking and Drinking Behavior\nMaterial and Method\nParticipants\nFollowing the young adult life stage proposed by Levinson\nto participate in an online experiment. Due to attractiveness-\nrelated questions, data of participants with a homosexual orien-\ntation were excluded. Participants who indicated being male or\noutside the young adult age range and participants with largely\nincomplete questionnaires were also removed from the data set.\nThe final sample consisted of 239 Flemish women (Mage\n\u00bc\ngium. In Belgium, alcohol can be legally sold in shops or bars\nto youngsters from 16 years old. Only when it concerns liquors,\nthe age limit rises to 18 years. Similarly, it is illegal to sell\ncigarettes to youngsters under 16 years old (www.belgium.be).\nDesign\nTo investigate whether women perceive men's sexual strategy\nand attractiveness differently depending on their smoking and\ndrinking behavior, an online between-subjects experimental\ndesign was used. More specifically, a factorial survey\nexperiment was conducted, in which vignettes (profiles), vary-\ning (an) experimental factor(s), were used to assess the impact\nof behavioral traits on evaluations (Auspurg & Hinz, 2015).\nThis research approach was chosen for because it has proven\nuseful in the studying of risky behaviors (Bassett & Moss,\nand signaling behavior (Sundie et al., 2011).\nStimuli and Procedure\nFor this study, behavioral profiles (vignettes) were created in\nwhich the hobbies of a typical young male were described in\ncirca 70 words. In total, 10 sets of profiles were created. Two\nsets of profiles addressed a young man's smoking and drinking\nbehavior. The eight other profile sets focused on other beha-\nviors, both positive (e.g., playing sports) and negative (e.g.,\nsunbathing), yet are not discussed in this article. Each profile\nset consisted of three versions, varying the main character's\nbehavioral frequency. All three profile versions were identical,\nexcept for the final sentence stating that a person did not\nengage, occasionally engaged, or frequently engaged in either\nsmoking or drinking (see Appendix).\nTo present the vignettes to the participants, three online\nlinks were created via the program ``Thesistools.'' The three\nlinks displayed all 10 behavioral profiles in the same order, yet\nvaried which of the three versions of a profile set was pre-\nsented. For instance, when opening the first link, women were\nasked to rate an occasional smoker and a frequent alcohol\ndrinker, followed by the other profiles.\nThe attractiveness of the main characters was assessed by\nasking the following question: ``Based on the profile you\njust read, how attractive would you find this person as a\npotential partner in the following situations? (a) a short-\nterm relationship (a date, one-night stand, casual relation-\nship, etc.) and (b) a long-term relationship (loyal, commit-\nted relationship, marriage)''. Both questions were measured\non a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not at all\nattractive) to 7 (very attractive).\nTo investigate whether a man's short-term mating strategy is\ninferred from his tobacco and alcohol use, participants were also\ninstructed to fill in the 3 attitudinal items of the Sociosexual\nInventory (SOI; Simpson & Gangestad, 1991) from the target's\nperspective (Sundie et al., 2011). More specifically, participants\nwere asked to indicate: To what extent do you think the person in\nthe profile would agree with the following statements? Answer\nthis question as you think the main character from the profile\nwould reply. For instance, the participating women indicated to\nwhatdegreethe personofthepersonalityprofile wouldagree with\nthe statement Sex without love is OK. All answers were given on a\n7-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7\n(highly agree), a higher score meaning a more short-term-\noriented, unrestricted, sexual strategy. For both the smoking- and\nalcohol-related vignettes, a new variable computed the mean\nscore of the three questions (aSmoking\nLastly, participants were also asked to indicate how harmful\nthey considered the overall behavior of the target individual to\nbe in terms of unhealthiness and riskiness: Based on the profile\nyou just read, to what extent do you agree with the following\nstatements (a) This person behaves in an unhealthy manner (b)\nThis person behaves in a risky manner. Here also, answers were\ngiving on a 7-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (abso-\nlutely not) to 7 (very much).\nParticipants agreeing to take part in the study randomly\nreceived one of the three online links. All participants were\ninformed that they would be taking part in an experiment con-\ncerning the perception of behavior. Participants were also\nassured of their anonymity and of the confidentiality of their\nanswers. Subsequently, all participants read the short vignettes.\nEach behavioral profile was followed by the three measures\n(attractiveness, SOI, and perceived behavioral harmfulness).\nStatistical Analysis\nThe statistical analysis consisted of analysis of variance\n(ANOVA) for Hypotheses 1\u00ad3, and mediation analysis for\nHypothesis 4, by means of SPSS Version 21. When a mixed\nANOVA was conducted (Hypotheses 1 and 3), significant main\neffects were reported via pairwise comparisons, whereas sig-\nnificant interaction effects were interpreted by means of simple\neffects analyses, assessed via the SPSS syntax (Field, 2013).\nFor the univariate ANOVA (Hypothesis 2), significant main\neffects were followed by means of Tukey post hoc testing.\nTo study whether women's perceptions are mediated by the\nperceived overall behavioral unhealthiness and riskiness\n(Hypothesis 4), mediation analyses were conducted, using Model\n4 of the PROCESS procedure of Hayes (2013; http://www.af-\nhayes.com). Separate mediation analyses were preferred over the\nuse of multiple mediators because of the high correlation between\nthe two potential mediators riskiness and unhealthiness, for both\nthe smoking profiles and the drinking profiles (rSmoking\n\u00bc .55, p < .001). Only in the case of distinct med-\niators,a model withtwomediatorsisconsideredmore appropriate\n(Kenny, Kashy, & Bolger, 1998). Given the three conditions of\nthe independent variable ``profile version'' (no usage, occasional\nusage, and frequent usage), three dummy variables were created\nto compare all conditions(occasional usage vs. nousage,frequent\nusage vs. no usage, and frequent usage vs. occasional usage). To\ntest the underlying process, bias-corrected bootstrapping was\ndence intervals around the indirect effect (a \u00c2 b) of the overall\nbehavioral impressions. Mediation occurs if the confidence inter-\nvals around the indirect effects exclude zero.\nResults\nThe Impact of Smoking and Drinking\non Perceived Behavioral Harmfulness\nTo study Hypothesis 1, two mixed ANOVAs (one for smoking\nbehavior and one for drinking behavior) were conducted with\nperceived unhealthiness and riskiness as dependent variables in\nthe within-subjects factor ``harmfulness.''

In addition, results showed signifi-\ncant interaction effects between perceived riskiness and\nunhealthiness as a function of usage frequency.\nFor the smoking profiles, the significant main effect of\nprofile version confirmed Hypothesis 1, showing that\nsmoking was perceived to be more harmful as the frequency\nrose (MFrequently\n\u00bc\nps < .001). However, simple effects analyses of the interaction\neffect (see Figure 1) indicated that while the perceived overall\nbehavioral unhealthiness rose with the smoking frequency (all\nps < .001), there was no significant difference in perceived\nriskiness between not smoking and smoking occasionally\n(p \u00bc .727). The frequent smoking profile, on the other hand,\nhad a significantly higher perceived riskiness compared to\nIn addition, although the significant main effect of the\nwithin-subjects factor harmfulness showed that the perceived\nTable 1.

No significantdifferences werefound between\noccasional smokers and frequent smokers (p \u00bc .572). For alco-\nhol use, on the other hand, post hoc tests revealed that there was\nno significant difference in how an occasional drinker and a\nnondrinker were seen (p \u00bc 1.0).

Short-term attractiveness and\nlong-term attractiveness served as independent variables in the\nwithin-subjects factor ``attractiveness,'' whereas profile ver-\nsion was used as between-subjects factor, varying between not\nusing, occasional usage, and frequent usage.\nFor both the smoking and the drinking profiles, a significant\nmain effect of the within-subjects factor attractiveness and the\nbetween-subjects factor profile version was found.

Perceived\noverall unhealthiness and riskiness were the two separate\nmediators (M).\nResults (see Table 3) showed significant indirect effects of\nthe behavioral frequency of smoking on sexual unrestrictedness\nscores, through unhealthiness perceptions. These findings indi-\ncate that as the smoking frequency increases, the perceived\nbehavioral unhealthiness rises, leading to a more sexually\nunrestricted impression. For drinking alcohol, there was no\nmediation through perceived unhealthiness, yet perceived ris-\nkiness did positively mediate the observed level of sexual\nunrestrictedness for frequent drinking compared to not drinking\nand occasional drinking.\nFor short-term attractiveness, no mediating effects were\nfound for both smoking and drinking behavior. Long-term\nattractiveness, on the other hand, was mediated by women's\noverall behavioral perception but in a negative manner. Con-\nsequently, a higher frequency led to a more harmful behavioral\nperception, lowering a man's long-term attractiveness. For\nsmoking, mediation occurred through unhealthiness percep-\ntions. For alcohol, both the perceived unhealthiness and riski-\nness mediated the attractiveness scores, yet only for frequent\ndrinking behavior, compared to not drinking and occasional\ndrinking.\nDiscussion Study 1\nThe results of this study indicate that both smoking and drink-\ning could be considered a physically harmful behavior, which\nfunctioned as an indicator of young men's short-term mating\nstrategy. Also, smoking and (especially) drinking brought\nshort-term attractiveness benefits to men. In addition, women's\nassessment of men as a function of their smoking and drinking\nbehavior was partially mediated by the perceived overall beha-\nvioral harmfulness. These results correspond with smoking and\ndrinking as a male short-term mating strategy. However, for a\nmating strategy to work, young men's behavior should corre-\nspond with women's perceptions. Therefore, the second study\nfocused on the sexual strategy of young male smokers\nand drinkers.\nFigure 3.

Also the Short-Term\nMating Orientation (STMO) scale and Long-Term Mating\nOrientation (LTMO) scale were added, measuring short-term\nand long-term mating tendencies through statements (Jackson\n& Kirkpatrick, 2007). The STMO contains 10 statements (e.g.,\nSometimes I would rather have sex with someone I did not care\nabout.), while the LTMO consists of 8 questions (e.g., I hope to\nhave a romantic relationship that lasts the rest of my life.). All\nscales had sufficient internal consistency (aSOI-R\nStatistical Analysis\nIndependent t-testing was used to verify if smokers are more\nsexually unrestricted than nonsmokers (Hypothesis 5) via the\nSOI-R. Given the violated assumption of normality, combined\nwith large differences in sample sizes, nonparametric Mann\u00ad\nWhitney tests were used to compare users and nonusers on the\nSTMO and LTMO. These tests could not be conducted for\ndrinkers and nondrinkers, due to the small sample of 10 non-\ndrinkers. Therefore, as an additional verification, three new\nvariables were created through a median split (via rank cases)\nof SOI-R, STMO, and LTMO, dividing all respondents into a\nmore sexually unrestricted and restricted group. Mann\u00adWhit-\nney tests were conducted to verify if both groups differed in\ntheir drinking frequency and average consumption. Finally, to\nstudy the correlation between users' level of sexual unrestrict-\nedness and their cigarette and alcohol consumption, a one-\ntailed Spearman correlation was opted for (Hypothesis 6).\nResults\nAn independent t-test was conducted with SOI-R as dependent\nvariable and being a smoker/nonsmoker as independent vari-\nable. Similarly, two Mann\u00adWhitney tests were performed, with\nSTMO and LTMO as dependent variables. Confirming\nHypothesis 5, results via SOI-R showed that smokers (M \u00bc\n4.56, SD \u00bc 1.26) were significantly more unrestricted in their\n\u00bc 4.80) scored significantly higher than nonsmokers (Mdn \u00bc\nicant differences were found between users (Mdn \u00bc 4.14) and\nnonusers (Mdn \u00bc 4.29) on the LTMO scale, yet a trend was\nvisible in which smokers were less long-term oriented (U \u00bc\nFor alcohol, Mann\u00adWhitney tests were performed with the\nmedian split variables as independent variables and drinking\nfrequency/average consumption as the dependent testing vari-\nables. Findings showed that the sexually short-term-oriented\ngroup had a higher ranking on drinking frequency and average\ndrinking than the more sexually restricted group. This was\nfound when the median split was based on SOI-R (UFrequency\n\u00bc .003, r \u00bc \u00c0.23). All sexually unrestricted groups had a\nmedian score of five on both measures, while the more\nrestricted groups had a median of four. Accordingly, the unrest-\nricted group consumed up to 20 alcoholic drinks a week, while\nthe restricted group only drank between 4 and 10 drinks a week.\nFurthermore, the more short-term-oriented group drank\nthe more long-term-oriented group.\nFurthermore, Spearman's one-tailed correlations between\nthe usage of smokers and drinkers (frequency and average\nconsumption) and their level of sexual unrestrictedness were\nconducted. Findings showed that there was no significant cor-\nrelation between the level of smoking behavior and their sexual\norientation (all ps ! .116). However, the extent to which young\nmen drink alcohol did correlate positively with their level of\nsexual unrestrictedness. Men who drank more frequently (rs\n\u00bc\n.21, p \u00bc .003) and had a higher average consumption (rs\np \u00bc .008) scored slightly higher on the SOI-R and vice versa.\nThe same positive correlation was found for the STMO scale\n(rs Frequency\nLTMO scale, a small negative correlation was present, indicat-\ning that a lower alcohol usage was correlated with a higher\nLTMO (rs Frequency\n.003). Since the same pattern is found as in Study 1, these\nfindings confirm Hypothesis 6.\nDiscussion Study 2\nResults of Study 2 showed that young men who smoke were\nmore short-term oriented in their sexuality compared to\nnonsmokers. Additionally, sexually unrestricted youngsters\nappeared to drink more compared to the long-term-oriented\ngroup. Furthermore, among users of tobacco, no link was\nfound between a man's smoking frequency and his level of\n8 Evolutionary Psychology\nsexual unrestrictedness. However, a higher alcohol con-\nsumption was positively correlated to a more unrestricted\nsexuality. These findings correspond with women's per-\nceptions, making no distinction between occasional and\nfrequent smokers, yet assessing heavy drinkers differently\nfrom occasional drinkers.\nGeneral Discussion\nDiscussion\nDespite the harmful physical effects of smoking and drinking,\nmany young men continue to use both substances. Therefore, in\nthis article, we explored the possibility that male youngsters\nuse these physical risky behaviors as a short-term mating strat-\negy. A first experiment studied whether smoking and drinking\naffects the perceived overall behavioral harmfulness (Hypoth-\nesis 1), whether women perceive smokers and drinkers to be\nmore sexually unrestricted compared to nonusers (Hypothesis\n2), and whether both unhealthy consumption behaviors bring\nshort-term attractiveness benefits (Hypothesis 3). In addition, it\nwas verified whether women's perceptions are mediated by the\nperceived behavioral unhealthiness and riskiness (Hypothesis\n4). Furthermore, a follow-up study investigated whether these\nfemale perceptions correspond with men's actual behavior and\nmating strategy (Hypothesis 5 and 6).\nConfirming Hypothesis 2, the first study showed that both\nsmokers and drinkers were perceived to be more short-term\noriented in their sexuality compared to people who do not use\ntobacco or alcohol. However, a smoker was considered more\nsexually unrestricted independent of his smoking frequency,\nwhereas only a heavy drinker was perceived to be more\nshort-term oriented compared to a nonuser.\nIn addition, corresponding with Hypothesis 3, smoking and\ndrinking brought short-term attractiveness benefits to its users.\nWhile the attractiveness ratings of nonusers did not differ\ndepending on the mating context, both occasional and frequent\nusers were considered more appealing as a short-term dating\npartner than a long-term partner. Moreover, as stated in\nHypothesis 3b, frequent drinking enhanced a young man's\nshort-term desirability compared to not drinking, while harm-\ning his long-term attractiveness. For smoking, a similar trend\nwas visible, in which frequent smoking was considered only\nslightly less attractive than not smoking in a short-term rela-\ntionship but heavily lowered a man's long-term desirability.\nAlso, as expected in Hypothesis 3a, occasional drinking\nincreased the attractiveness of men in both short-term and\nlong-term mating contexts. Occasional smoking, on the other\nhand, was found equally attractive as not smoking in both\nsituations. These attractiveness findings correspond with the\nset and Moss (2004), showing that heavy physical risk taking is\nmainly attractive in short-term mating contexts, while moder-\nate physical risk taking is also appealing for long-term mating.\nIt also corresponds with the recent study, showing that moder-\nate alcohol use enhances a man's general (long term)\nattractiveness, whereas heavy alcohol use has a rather negative\nThe second study confirmed these female perceptions and\nHypothesis 5, showing that male smokers were indeed more\nshort-term oriented in their sexuality compared to nonusers.\nFurthermore, those youngsters who were more sexually unrest-\nricted appeared to have a higher drinking consumption. These\nfindings complement the findings of Jones and Figuerdo (2007)\nas well as Hone, Carter, and Mccullough (2013) and Hone and\nMcCullough (2015), showing that higher mating efforts are\nlinked to smoking and drinking behavior. Moreover, when\nlooking at the mating strategy of actual smokers and drinkers,\nthere appeared to be no link between users' amount of smoking\nand their level of sexual unrestrictedness, whereas a positive\ncorrelation was present for drinking alcohol. These findings\nalso correspond with women's assessment of Study 1, in which\nfrequent drinkers were perceived differently from occasional\ndrinkers, yet no differences were found between occasional and\nfrequent smokers. Accordingly, also Hypothesis 6 was\nconfirmed.\nIn sum, the above findings show that both unhealthy con-\nsumption behaviors could operate as a short-term mating strat-\negy, in which men use heavy smoking and drinking to signal a\nshort-term mating orientation and to obtain attractiveness ben-\nefits in short-term mating contexts. However, this is especially\nthe case for drinking alcohol, more so than smoking cigarettes.\nIn addition, results are inconclusive as to how smoking cigar-\nettes and drinking alcohol actually functions as a short-term\nmating strategy. On the one hand, findings confirmed that both\nbehaviors are actually considered physically harmful beha-\nviors, as heavy smoking and heavy drinking affected the per-\nceived overall behavioral unhealthiness and riskiness of\nyoungsters. However, Hypothesis 4, verifying whether\nwomen's perceptions are actually mediated by the perceived\nbehavioral harmfulness was only partially confirmed. In line\nwith expectations, the positive mediation in the assessment of a\nyoung man's sexual strategy indicated that a higher perceived\nbehavioral harmfulness leads to a more sexually unrestricted\nimpression as the behavioral frequency rises. Furthermore, also\nthe negative mediating effect on a man's long-term attractive-\nness corresponds with risk-taking literature, showing that a\nman's desirability lowers as the perceived harmfulness of the\nbehavior rises above a certain level (Bassett & Moss, 2004;\nFarthing, 2007). Yet, mediation analyses were unable to con-\nfirm that the perceived harmfulness also had an impact on the\nshort-term attractiveness ratings. In addition, unhealthiness\nmediated the impact of smoking behavior on women's percep-\ntion, while especially riskiness had indirect effects on how\ndrinking alcohol affected the perception of women.\nThese differences in results between the tobacco and alcohol\nprofiles could be related to the general idea that prevails among\nyoung people in Belgium about smoking and drinking. Studies\nalready showed that having a favorable image of smokers facil-\nitates smoking behavior (Gerrard, Gibbons, Stock, Lune, &\nden Eijnden, & Engels, 2005), while a positive image of\ndrinkers is related to a higher alcohol consumption (Gerrard\net al., 2002; Spijkerman, van den Eijnden, Vitale, & Engels,\n2004). In Belgium, drinking alcohol is widely accepted among\nyoungsters, with 93% of the Flemish college and university\nstudents drinking alcohol (Rosiers et al., 2014). Furthermore,\noccasional drinking is not always perceived as harmful, due to\nstudies stating that moderate drinking can have positive effects\non a person's health (Ellison, 2007; Gutjahr, Gmel, & Rehm,\ncourse on smoking, on the other hand, is much more negative.\nYoungsters are confronted more with warnings of the dangers\nof smoking (e.g., each packet of cigarettes contains a clear\nwarning message in Belgium, yet no such messages are found\non alcoholic beverages). As a consequence, smoking is less\nsocially accepted, leading to ``only'' 30% of the young adult\nstudents being a smoker (Rosiers et al., 2014). These cultural\nattitudes could explain why there is a difference in the func-\ntioning of smoking and drinking as a short-term mating strat-\negy. The fact that smoking is less socially accepted compared\nto drinking corresponds with the fact that drinking alcohol\nleads to clear attractiveness benefits, whereas smoking beha-\nvior is limited to not harming men's attractiveness. Moreover,\nit matches with the fact that smokers are considered more\nsexually short-term oriented, irrespective of their smoking fre-\nquency, whereas only heavy drinking functions as an indicator\nof a person's sexual strategy. Finally, it also corresponds with\nthe mediating effect of perceived unhealthiness on smoking\nbehavior, while perceived riskiness had a higher impact on\nalcohol-based impressions.\nLimitations and Future Research\nA potential confound in the first experimental study is the fact\nthat the presentation order of the cigarette and alcohol vignettes\nwas not randomized (all participants first rated a smoking pro-\nfile, followed by a drinking profile). Although each of the three\nonline links varied the behavioral frequency of the behavioral\nprofiles, ensuring a mix of never/occasional/frequent behavior,\nsome order effects might have influenced participants' ratings\nbecause of the fixed order. Also, the experimental study did not\ntake into account the participants' smoking and drinking beha-\nvior. Yet, for a future study, it would be interesting to verify if\nusers assess young men differently compared to nonusers.\nFurthermore, asking about the perceived behavioral unhealthi-\nness and riskiness appeared insufficient to gain complete\ninsight in the functioning of smoking and drinking as a short-\nterm mating strategy, as no mediating effects were found to\nexplain the short-term attractiveness ratings. Perhaps asking\nhow unhealthy and risky participants considered the actual\nsmoking and drinking behavior to be--instead of the overall\nbehavior--would show significant positive mediating effects.\nIn addition, to increase our understanding of why smoking and\ndrinking operates as a short-term mating strategy, follow-up\nstudies could focus on identifying which characteristics\ntobacco and alcohol use signal to potential partners, in addition\nto the attractiveness benefits. When studying women's\nperceptions of men, we would also suggest new studies to take\ninto account the amount of cigarettes and alcohol that is con-\nsumed on one occasion. As short-term mating intentions are\noften based on interactions in one occasion, women are not\nalways aware of men's general smoking and drinking behavior.\nHowever, the amount of cigarettes and alcoholic beverages that\nare consumed on one occasion can often be witnessed. More-\nover, drinking or smoking occasionally can mean also that a\nperson occasionally engages in heavy episodic drinking/smok-\ning instead of moderate usage. Furthermore, in our second\nstudy, we only had a limited number of respondents who did\nnot drink alcohol. As a consequence, additional tests were per-\nformed using a median split between the more short-term and\nlong-term-oriented respondents. However, future studies are\nnecessary to verify whether the differences in sexual unrest-\nrictedness are present for both smokers and drinkers.\nConclusion and Implications\nIn this article, we explored the possibility that young male smok-\ning and drinking is used as a short-term mating strategy. Find-\nings showed that tobacco and alcohol use are considered\nphysically harmful behaviors that operate as an indicator for\nyoung men's short-term sexual orientation. Furthermore, despite\nall efforts to sensitize youngsters for the dangers of smoking and\ndrinking, male tobacco and (especially) alcohol use still bring\nattractiveness benefits in short-term mating situations. Given the\nharmfulness and high frequency of both consumption behaviors\nin young adulthood, these findings are of interest to both social\nmarketing professionals and institutions aimed at limiting youth\nsmoking and drinking behavior. Not only do these findings show\nthat emphasizing the physical harmful effects of cigarettes and\nalcohol in order to prevent the unhealthy behaviors might not be\neffective. It may even turn out to be contra productive.\nAppendix\nSmoking Profiles\nPeter likes soccer. For years, he has been a loyal fan of his\nfavorite team.
