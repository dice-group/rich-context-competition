The present study\naimed to identify the risk factors for pre-\noperative respiratory complications by\nretrospectively analysing cases of paediatric\nTFBA in order to compare age, sex, symp-\ntoms, type of foreign body, retention time\nand location of foreign body between\ngroups with or without preoperative respira-\ntory complications.\nPatients and methods\nPatient population\nThis retrospective study analysed data col-\nlected from consecutive paediatric patients\nwith TFBA who attended the Department\nof Otolaryngology, Ningbo Women and\nChildren's Hospital, Ningbo, Zhejiang\nnosed by rigid bronchoscopy based on a\ndefinitive history or suspicion of foreign\nbody inhalation. Computed tomography\n(CT) was performed in all patients using a\nBrilliance CT 16-slice system (Philips\nHealthcare, Best, The Netherlands) to iden-\ntify any pulmonary complications.\nThe study was approved by the Institutional\nReview Board of Ningbo Women and\nlegal guardians of the study participants\nprovided written informed consent.\nStudy methods\nEnrolled patients were divided into two groups\naccording to occurrence of preoperative\nrespiratory complications (pulmonary infec-\ntion [pneumonia], emphysema, atelectasis,\nmediastinal shift and pneumomediastinum)\nconfirmed by CT. Group A included patients\nwith preoperative respiratory complications;\ngroup B included patients without preopera-\ntive respiratory complications. Retention time,\nwhich was defined as the duration from onset\nof TFBA symptoms to hospital admission,\nwas recorded for all study participants.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version 16.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows\u00d5.\nContinuous data with a normal distribution\nwere presented as mean\u00c6 SD. Between-group\ncomparisons were conducted using Student's\nt-test. Categorical data were analysed using\n2-test. All of the variables were assessed for\nnormality using Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov test.\nA P-value< 0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant. Univariate and multivariate ana-\nlyses were performed using a Cox logistic\nregression model. Effects of different clinical\nparameters on the respiratory complications of\nTFBA in children were calculated by univari-\nate analysis for each parameter. Parameters for\nwhich the unadjusted P-value was< 0.10 in the\nunivariate analysis were identified as potential\nrisk markers and were included in the multi-\nvariate analysis.\nResults\nA total of 223 children were enrolled in\nmean \u00c6 SD age of 1.8 \u00c6 1.9 years [range,\n7 months to 12 years]). The mean \u00c6 SD\nretention time was 5.9 \u00c6 1.5 days (range,\npatients (70%) were referred from other\nhospitals in the local area.\nPatients were divided into two groups\nbased on the presence of preoperative\nrespiratory complications as identified on\nfemale patients) and group B (n \u00bc 62; 43\nmale and 19 female patients). Table 1\npresents the demographic and clinical char-\nacteristics of the two groups. There were\nno significant between-group differences in\nterms of age or sex distribution. Age- and\nsex distributions of the patients in both\ngroups A and B are presented in Figure 1.\nIn group A, the age groups that were most\nlikely to present with TFBA were the 0 to\n(n \u00bc 100) year groups. In group B, the\nage groups that were most likely to present\nwith TFBA were 0 to <1 (n \u00bc 15 patients)\nand !1 to <2 (n \u00bc 36) year groups, which\nall patients.\nThe mean \u00c6 SD retention time was sig-\nnificantly longer in group A compared with\nCoughing and wheezing were the most\ncommon symptoms of TFBA in patients in\nboth groups (Table 2). The proportion of\npatients with dyspnoea in group B was\nsignificantly higher compared with group\nA (P < 0.05). There were no other significant\nbetween-group differences.\nTypes of foreign body that were aspirated\nby patients in both study groups are listed in\nTable 3. The majority of aspirated foreign\nlarly peanut kernels and sunflower seeds.\nAnatomical locations of aspirated foreign\nbodies for both groups are shown in Table 4.\nResults of the CT scans for preoperative\npulmonary complications for group A are\nshown in Table 5. Emphysema and pneu-\nmonia were the most common complica-\nin group A had several complications\nsimultaneously.\nUnivariate and multivariate analyses of\nthe effects of clinical parameters on respira-\ntory complications of TFBA in children\nfound that the type of foreign body and\nthe symptoms of TFBA differed significantly\nbetween both groups (P < 0.05) (Table 6).\nDiscussion\nDespite improvements in the general pub-\nlic's knowledge of TFBA in recent years, this\npulmonary condition remains life threaten-\ning for young children who cannot chew\nfood thoroughly and tend to put foreign\nbodies into their mouths. Previous reports\nhave demonstrated that children aged 0\u00ad3\nyears are most likely to experience TFBA,\nwere children aged 0 to <2 years and the\nmean age of the study population was 1.8\nyears. The mean age was 1 year younger\nTable 1.

Some nutritionists recommend nuts\nto promote brain development in young chil-\ndren, prompting parents to add these food-\nstuffs to their children's diets. There was no\nFigure 1.

Delayed treatment prolongs the\nretention time of the foreign body in the\nrespiratory tract, resulting in pneumonia,\nemphysema, atelectasis, pneumomediastinum\nand other serious complications.2,3\nCommon symptoms of TFBA are cough-\ning, dyspnoea, wheezing, and fever, which\ndiffer according to the stage of TFBA; these\nsymptoms are generally experienced in a\nsequential manner.1,2 In the first stage\n(acute stage), the most common symptoms\nare violent coughing, dyspnoea, or even\nasphyxia due to complete airway blockage.1,2\nIn the second stage (quiescent stage), the\nsymptoms are not obvious, which can lead to\nmisdiagnosis.1,2 The third stage is a late stage\naccompanied by complications.1,2 In the\npresent study, the most common symptoms\nof TFBA in patients in both groups were\ncoughing and wheezing. Other symptoms\nincluded fever and dyspnoea. The proportion\nof patients with dyspnoea in group B was\nsignificantly higher compared with group A\n(P < 0.05) in the present study, a finding that\nmight be attributed to the location of foreign\nbodies. Patients in group B were more likely\nto have their foreign body located in their\ntrachea compared with group A (51.6%\nversus 2.5%, respectively), which in our\nexperience cause severe symptoms such as\ndyspnoea, attracting more attention and\ncausing patients and their parents to seek\nurgent medical help, thus facilitating early\ndiagnosis and timely treatment.\nPreoperative respiratory complications\nare related to the retention time of the foreign\nbody.3 In our experience, plant foreign\nbodies such as peanuts and walnuts can\ncause complications if they are retained for\n>24h, while plastic foreign bodies require a\nlonger period, several months or even years,\nto trigger complications. The type, size, shape\nand location of the foreign body also plays a\nrole in the occurrence of preoperative respira-\ntory complications.3 The type of foreign body\nis related to the local culture and diet-\nthat nuts (particularly peanuts) and seeds\n(especially sunflower seeds) are most\nTable 6.

Peanut kernels are larger than\nsunflower seeds, so they are prone to cause\nairway blockage. After prolonged retention\nin the respiratory tract, during which time\nwater is absorbed, the peanut can expand and\nworsen the condition.3 In addition, peanuts\nare abundant in unsaturated fatty acids,\ncontributing to respiratory inflammation.3\nThese facts might explain the higher propor-\ntion of aspirated peanuts in group A com-\npared with group B, in the present study. The\nmajority of TFBA cases could be avoided by\nparents and carers keeping young children\naway from nuts and small toys.\nIn the long term, foreign bodies have a\nhigher tendency to fall into the right bron-\nchus.12 Recent research has shown that the\nright-side tendency exists in adults but not in\nchildren younger than 15 years.14 The left and\nright principal bronchi form similar angles\nwithin the main trachea,13 thus the likelihood\nof a foreign body falling into each should be\nsimilar.14,15 This present study supports this\nsuggestion, as 50.9% of foreign bodies in\ngroup A were located in the left bronchus\nand 46.6%% were in the right bronchus; in\ngroup B, 27.4% of foreign bodies were located\nin the left bronchus and 21.0% were in the\nright bronchus. Of special interest was the fact\nthat in group B, 51.6% of the foreign bodies\nwere located in the trachea, which was mark-\nedly higher than in group A (2.5%). These\nfindings suggest that the symptoms associated\nwith the presence of a foreign body in the\ntrachea were more severe than in the bronchus,\ncausing patients and their parents to seek\nmedical help earlier.\nWhen patients present with TFBA at our\ninstitution, CT is routinely used to ascertain\nthe location of the foreign body and confirm\npreoperative complications, because severe\ncomplications must be detected in order to\nprovide timely treatment and reduce surgical\nrisks. All 223 patients in the present study\nunderwent CT and 161 patients (group A)\nwere confirmed to have preoperative respira-\ntory complications. Emphysema and pneumo-\nnia were the most common complications,\nrespectively. Less common complications\nincluded atelectasis, pneumomediastinum,\npneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema.\nThe present study had a number of limita-\ntions. First, there was no sample-size calcula-\ntion undertaken prior to commencement of\nthe study and the authors randomly chose the\nnumber of patients to include. Secondly,\nanalyses were not undertaken according to\nthe different age groups. Thirdly, the study did\nnot present the results of treatment and\ndifferent treatment modalities. Finally, the\nimbalance between male and female partici-\npants might have had an impact on the results.\nIn conclusion, respiratory complications\nof TFBA in children are correlated with type\nof foreign body, retention time and symp-\ntoms, but showed no relationship with\nlocation of the foreign body, age or sex.\nAspiration of peanuts and prolonged reten-\ntion time may cause preoperative complica-\ntions. Dyspnoea and trachea-located foreign\nbodies appeared to urge the patient and their\nparents to seek medical help earlier, thus\nreducing preoperative respiratory complica-\ntions. Early diagnosis and treatment are\nconsidered to be key factors in improving\nthe clinical response to TFBA, and in\nreducing the incidence of complications\nassociated with TFBA in children.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research was supported by grants from\nthe Social Development Project of Ningbo\nKey Technology about Birth Defect Early\nReferences\n1.
