The\nabuse of these medications is a national issue.\nIntentional drug abuse of prescribed and OTC medicines has climbed steadily. Data from the 2005\nNational Survey on Drug Use and Health demonstrated that 6.4 million (2.6%) people aged 12 or older\nhad used prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons during the past month. Of these, 4.7 million used\npain relievers, 1.8 million used tranquilizers, and 1.1 million used stimulants. The nonmedical use of\nprescription drugs in the past month among young adults aged 18 to 25 increased from 5.4% in 2002 to\n6.3% in 2005, primarily because of an increase in the abusive use of pain relievers.\nPhysicians need to watch for prescription and OTC medication abuse.

Pre-\nscription medications are those pharmaceuticals\ndispensed by a pharmacist on the presentation of a\nprescription written by a physician, dentist, or\nother health care provider who is legally authorized\nto write prescriptions. OTC medications are phar-\nmaceuticals that do not require a prescription and\nare sold on the shelves of markets, stores, and\npharmacies.2\nScope of the Problem\nIntentional drug abuse of prescribed and OTC\nmedicines has climbed steadily over the years. Data\nfrom the 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and\nHealth demonstrated that 6.4 million (2.6%) peo-\nple aged 12 or older used prescription psychother-\napeutic drugs for nonmedical reasons during the\nprevious month. Of these, 4.7 million used pain\nrelievers, 1.8 million used tranquilizers, and 1.1\nmethamphetamines).

Lessenger, MD, FAAFP,\nagbook@lessenger.net).\n0.8% reported buying the drug on the Internet. In\n2005 the specific illicit drugs that had the highest\nlevels of dependence or abuse in the previous year\nwere marijuana (4.1 million), cocaine (1.5 million),\nand pain relievers (1.5 million). Nonmedical use of\npain relievers (2.2 million) and marijuana (2.1 mil-\nlion) accounted for the largest number of first-time\nabuse among people aged 12 or older.3\nIn a recent New Mexico study of deaths from\nunintentional drug poisoning, 0.9% were from\nonstrated that suicide-prone patients with a diag-\nnosis of substance abuse who possess prescription\nmedications are more likely to overdose on OTC\nmedications.5\nA study of Tulare County, California, Drug\nCourt clients found that 8.5% admitted to abusing\nprescription drugs and 16.2% admitted to abusing\nOTC medications, mostly ephedrine and other\nstimulants. None of the clients admitted to pre-\nscription drugs or OTC medications as their drug-\nof-choice (DOC), although some admitted addic-\ntion to Vicodin after the study was completed.6\nThis study suggests that some drug addicts may\nonly resort to prescriptive or OTC medications\nwhen their illegal drugs are not available.\nIn emergency departments in the United States,\nprescription and OTC drugs were the primary sub-\nstances of abuse for 4% of the 1.9 million patients\nadmitted for drug treatment in 2002. Prescription\nmedications were primarily opioids, stimulants,\ntranquilizers, and sedatives. OTC drugs included\naspirin, cough syrup, diphenhydramine and other\nantihistamines, sleep aids, and other legally ob-\ndrug-related emergency department admissions\nwere for prescription narcotics. Most of the people\nseen in the emergency departments were white and\nfemale and had never had a previous emergency\ndepartment visit because of illicit drugs. Compari-\nson with 1992 data demonstrated an increase in\nopiate and OTC use, with a relative decrease of\nsedative and tranquilizer use. The use of stimulants\nTrends in Use\nPeople use potentially addicting prescription or\nOTC medications in the following manners:\n For legitimate, prescribed medical treatment; for\nexample, methamphetamines for narcolepsy and\nopiates for severe trauma.\n As an additional drug to use when the DOC is\nunavailable on the streets.\n As a booster for a more intense high.\n As an alternative addictive drug when their DOC\nhas been eliminated from use by drug testing.\n As an alternative addictive drug prescribed by\nphysicians; for example, amphetamines in diet\nclinics. These prescriptions may be issued either\nnaively by the physician or for profit.9,10\nData from the Drug Abuse Warning Network\ndemonstrate the following about people who abuse\nprescription or OTC medications:\n They tend to be white.\n They tend to be younger (when stimulants are\nthe DOC).\n They tend to use opiates.\n They tend to be women; women tend to use\ntranquilizers and sedatives.\n They tend to mix their medications with alcohol.\n They tend to use prescription and OTC medica-\ntions in conjunction with alcohol as a vehicle for\nsuicide.\n They obtain the prescription medications by pre-\nscription from their physicians or dentists, as\ngifts from friends, or purchase them on the black\nTable 1. 2002 Emergency Department Admissions from Use of Prescription and Over-the-Counter  \nSubstance % Age at First Use Source of Feferral\nStimulants 28 20 Criminal justice system\nTranquilizers, muscle relaxers 10 24 Self\nData from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.5\nOTC, over the counter.\nmarket. OTC medications are, of course, pur-\nMany of the medications in this paper have le-\ngitimate medical uses for people with a variety of\nillnesses and injuries. They may even be used in\nhigh doses for selected medical problems. The\nquestion arises as to whether the medication is\nbeing prescribed by the physician and used by the\nclient appropriately or if it is being inappropriately\nprescribed or used. This problem is most common\nin the use of opioids and stimulants.13\nWhen a legal medication is the addict's primary\nDOC, it was either prescribed by a physician or\npurchased on the streets. There are 3 people in-\nvolved in the abuse: (1) the physician, who either\nknowingly or naively prescribes pharmaceuticals to\na person who is faking pain; (2) the person who\nfakes or exaggerates an illness to obtain a prescrip-\ntion, which is then filled in a pharmacy and may be\nsold at locations where he or she can obtain high\nprices; and (3) the addict who purchases the med-\nPhysicians who prescribe or dispense medica-\ntions that can be abused are at risk for becoming\npart of the problem. Some physicians are part of\nthe illegal network of drug sales, but others fall into\nthe trap of trying to help people as best they can.\nRecent campaigns to treat pain as a vital sign along\nwith blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and\ntemperature make it necessary for professionals to\ntreat pain aggressively and appropriately. The Fed-\neral and state governments' campaign against the\nillicit use of prescription opiates, on the other hand,\nhas made it difficult at times for patients to obtain\nrelief for the pain of cancer or a debilitating disease.\nUnder-treatment of pain has also become a prob-\nlem among prescribing physicians, resulting from\nfears of investigation by regulatory agencies. Phy-\nsicians have found themselves fearful of govern-\nment sanctions if they prescribe these medications.\nParadoxically, some patients refuse to take opiates\nand other medications for pain control at the end of\ntheir lives for fear of becoming addicted.13,14\nProfessionals who prescribe or work around\ncontrolled drugs also are at risk of abusing readily\navailable medications and becoming addicted. Part\nof the problem is that not only do the professionals\ndivert medications for their own use, but, in some\ncases, they rob patients of necessary medications.9\nDependence on Medication and Pseudo-addiction\nThere are clear differences between the physical\ndependence on medication, active addiction, addic-\ntion in remission, and pseudo-addiction. The de-\npendence on medication may be therapeutic re-\ngardless of the class to which it belongs. Physical\ndependence of a therapeutic drug may occur, re-\nsulting in withdrawal symptoms if the medication is\nsuddenly stopped. This is a physiologic response to\nthe chronic use of a medication, just as stopping a\nblood pressure medicine suddenly can cause hyper-\ntension, heart attack, or stroke. Drug-seeking be-\nhavior, actions to obtain drugs either by a prescrip-\ntion or otherwise, may in some people reflect not\naddiction but rather difficulty in obtaining appro-\npriate medications because they are labeled as ad-\ndicts. Some people with a history of addiction to\nillicit drugs may also have a chronic pain syndrome\nthat would benefit from appropriate opiate pain\nmedication. A person recovering from drug addic-\ntion may need a stimulant for narcolepsy or a tran-\nquilizer for anxiety. If these problems are under-\ntreated because of physician fear, a syndrome of\npseudo-addiction may occur, in which the person\nengages in drug-seeking behavior simply to obtain\na therapeutic and effective dosage level of a medi-\nPatients in drug-addiction recovery may be even\nmore vigilant than the physician. They are acutely\naware of the consequences of relapse and do not\nwant to experience the problems of addiction again.\nFor that reason, some people in recovery may forgo\nopioid medications even in the face of severe trauma.14\nDisposal of Prescription and OTC  \nA recurring problem facing patients in drug addic-\ntion recovery is the disposal of prescription and\nOTC medications they have on hand. Especially\nearly in their program, patients may have hundreds\nof prescription and OTC tablets as well as herbal\npreparations and supplements. They may be using\nthese as part of their abuse pattern or keeping them\nin case their addictive cravings overwhelm them.15\nDisposal of these remedies becomes problematic\nbecause the patients cannot throw them in the\ntrash, which could be searched by law enforcement\nauthorities. A similar situation exists if they try to\ngive it to friends. In many states, pharmacies cannot\nlegally take back the medications and other phar-\nmacies may refuse because of liability concerns. In\naddition, there are many environmental concerns\nabout the disposal of medications and contami-\nnated syringes. A possible solution might be to\nprovide locked, hazardous waste collection contain-\ners at the physician's offices where a patient can\ndispose of used syringes and medications.6\nAlthough this article focuses on abuse, there are\nother nonmedical uses of prescription medications.\nThese include bartering, especially in jails and pris-\nons; use as a mechanism of suicide; use as a mech-\nanism of homicide; and accidental ingestion.16\nAbused Prescription Drugs\nCommonly abused prescription drugs are summa-\nrized in Table 2. Detection of these pharmaceuti-\ncals is difficult because the Federal Department of\nTransportation drug test panel, or a standard fo-\nrensic drug test panel, may not pick up some of\nthese substances, including oxycodone. Detoxifica-\ntion and withdrawal from any of the medications\nmay be problematic and may require inpatient\ntreatment and appropriate pharmacological sup-\nThe Internet is a major source of prescription\ndrugs that are used for nonmedical uses. A 2006\nsurvey documented that 89% of sites selling con-\ntrolled prescription drugs have no prescription re-\nquirements, a figure that is down from 94% in\ntion, 70% only required a prescription be faxed,\nallowing a customer to easily forge prescriptions or\nfax the same prescription to several Internet phar-\nmacies. There has also been a trend toward online\nWeb sites offered such a service.18\nSedatives\nBarbiturates are typically used as a sedative and\nanticonvulsant, but they have an equal role as the\nmeans to decrease the likelihood of seizures and\nother symptoms in alcohol, heroin, and other types\nof drug withdrawal. This class of medications is\neasily abused as a hypnotic and overdose is com-\nmon, resulting in death through respiratory depres-\nsion. They are addictive but tolerance can occur; a\nwithdrawal syndrome exists, consisting of agitation,\nheadaches, psychomotor retardation, confusion,\nand possible seizures. Addicts may seek out barbi-\nturates as a sleep aid and as a method of self-\ndetoxification if they know that a Department of\nTransportation drug test is nearing.19\nOpioids and Morphine Derivatives\nConsiderable controversy exists about the use of\nopioids for the treatment of chronic pain not orig-\ninating from cancer and the resulting increase in\nmedications available for diversion to illicit use.\nUnder-treatment of pain has also become a prob-\nlem among physicians because of fears of investi-\ngation by regulatory agencies. One response to\nunder-treatment has been the appearance of drug-\nseeking behavior among people with legitimate\nnon-cancer pain.20 Myriad state and Federal laws\nand polices provide physicians with a confusing\npicture of when and to whom these medications\ncan be prescribed.\nA recent survey of physicians regarding drug\nabuse showed that doctors perceive the 4 mecha-\nnisms of diversion to be (1) doctor shopping to find\na cooperative professional; (2) obtaining controlled\nsubstances from multiple doctors; (3) patient de-\nception or manipulation of doctors; and (4) forged\nor altered prescriptions.16 A fifth source, not well\nstudied, consists of doctors and dentists who pre-\nscribe controlled drugs for money or who divert\nthem for their own use. Reports from England\ndocument that most opioids that are used by ad-\ndicts for nonmedical indications are prescribed by a\nsmall number of physicians.21\nTable 2.

Of visits to the emergency department\nfor attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medica-\ntion problems, 48% were for nonmedical use of the\nmedications, 34% were adverse reactions associated\nwith medical use, 10% were accidental ingestion,\nand 8% were suicide attempts. The rates were\nhigher for the 12- to 17-year-old age group than\nfor patients aged 18 or older. Over two thirds\n(68%) of the visits involved nonmedical use of these\n2 drugs and another substance, such as alcohol, an\nillicit drug, or a pharmaceutical.8\nTranquilizers and Muscle Relaxers\nBenzodiazepines are commonly diverted for non-\nmedical uses. They are typically prescribed as sleep\naids or as anti-anxiety medications. They are also\nuseful in detoxification from alcohol or other sub-\nstances and are useful in the treatment of convul-\nsive disorders. Overdose can cause respiratory de-\npression, especially when used with other sedative\nmedications or alcohol.22\nThere is a syndrome of paradoxical disinhibition\nthat results in increased excitement, irritability, ag-\ngression, hostility, and impulsivity. In rare cases,\nthese conditions can lead to attacks of rage or\nviolence or other antisocial behaviors. Tolerance\ncan develop with the use of these medications.22\nHigh benzodiazepine doses are used by addicts to\nenhance the euphoria effects of opioids; boost\nmethadone or heroin fixes; temper cocaine highs;\naugment the effects of alcohol; or ease the effects of\nwithdrawal from heroin, methadone, and other\nMuscle relaxants can also be addicting. Cariso-\nprodol, a centrally acting muscle relaxant sold un-\nder the name of Soma, is an example. Its active\nmetabolite is meprobamate, a class IV substance\nand a highly addictive and potent sedative-hyp-\nnotic. Ingestion can cause addiction and a mild\nsense of euphoria. Higher doses cause euphoria and\nimpaired hand-eye coordination and balance. Tol-\nerance exists and there is a withdrawal syndrome of\nanxiety, tremor, muscle twitching, insomnia, auditory\nand visual hallucinations, and bizarre behavior.23\nPharmaceuticals for Erectile Dysfunction\nSildenafil (Viagra; Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY) has\nbecome the sentinel erectile dysfunction medica-\ntion in the drug-using culture; an underground\nnetwork of faked prescriptions, foreign imports,\nand Internet purchases exists. Both homosexual and\nheterosexual men and women are documented to\nhave demonstrated drug-seeking behavior with this\nsubstance.24 In a survey of sexually active males\ntion and 6% used medications, but rarely under\nmedical supervision and often mixed with recre-\national drugs.25 Among British illicit drug users,\nSildenafil use among night clubbers, a sentinel pop-\nulation of illicit drug users, was first reported in\n1999. Use by both men and women was reported,\nwith elevated prevalence levels among both gay\nAmong gay men and women, Sildenafil along\nwith cocaine, crystal methamphetamines, amyl ni-\ntrate poppers, Ecstasy, gamma-hydroxybuterate,\nand ketamine has become a \"club drug.\"27 Meth-\namphetamine and Sildenafil use are linked to un-\nprotected receptive and insertive anal sex, respec-\ntively, in a sample of gay men.28 Sildenafil use\nappears to have become a stable fixture of the sexual\nculture of gay men and is associated with a general\nbehavioral risk patter for transmission of HIV and\nother sexually transmitted diseases.29 The concom-\nitant use of Viagra, testosterone, and antidepres-\nsants among HIV-seropositive gay and bisexual\nmen has been associated with unintended negative\neffects because of the additive risk of side effects.30\nRecent anecdotal evidence suggest that Sildena-\nfil abuse is becoming increasingly popular among\nEcstasy users to attempt to negate the erectile dys-\nfunction side-effects of the drug or to enhance the\ndrug experience through the concomitant use of\nerectile dysfunction drugs.31\nAbused OTC Drugs\nOTC drugs are easily purchased, are difficult to\ndetect on routine drug testing, and can be used as\nan alternative DOC when the addicted person's\nprimary drug had been removed.32 The literature is\nsparse about OTC medications and herbal reme-\ndies. Herbal remedies are especially problematic\nbecause they can be sold at swap meets and other\nunregulated venues; they are not subject to the\nscrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration;\nthey may be imported from other countries, espe-\ncially Mexico and China, that do not have strict\ncontrols on their contents; they may include heavy\nmetals such as lead; the there are few systematic\nstudies of efficacy or safety.32 A representative list\nof abused OTC drugs is found in Table 3. Partic-\nularly dangerous drugs or combinations of drugs\nare discussed individually below (Table 3).\nOTC Steroids in Exercise Gymnasiums\nIn a study of 511 men entering 5 exercise gymna-\nsiums it was found that 18% reported use of an-\ndrostededione or other anabolic steroids to increase\nmuscle mass; 25% used ephedrine as a stimulant.\nAmong the same group, 5% reported anabolic ste-\nroid use within the last 3 years.

An unknown number of adolescents in the\nUnited States and Europe intoxicate themselves\nwith acute megadoses of dextromethorphan, de-\nfined as 5 to 10 times the dose recommended for\ncontrol of annoying nonproductive coughs. Al-\nthough a moderate overdose of pure DXM hydro-\nbromide is free of serious adverse effects, approxi-\nmately 5% of people of European ethnicity lack the\nability to metabolize the drug normally, leading to\nrapid, acute toxic levels. Variable quantities of pure\nDXM powder in multiples of 1 g are available from\nthe Internet. Recipe-like extraction procedures are\navailable online, allowing for simple and inexpen-\nsive home manufacture of concentrated DXM\npowder from Coricidin HBP Cough & Cold Tab-\nlets (Schering-Plough HealthCare Products, Inc.,\nKenilworth, NJ) (street name \"triple C\"). Acute\nmegadoses of the drug have profound psychologi-\ncal and physiologic effects similar to those of phen-\ncyclidine. Megadoses of DXM used to self-intoxi-\ncate can produce a false-positive screening test for\nphencyclidine in a urine specimen.35\nDXM can cause psychosis, dependence, and\nphysical withdrawal. It has specific serotonergic\nand sigma-1 opioidergic properties. Dextrorphan,\nthe active metabolite of DXM, has similar proper-\nties; however, it is a weaker sigma opioid receptor\nagonist and a stronger N-methyl-D-aspartic acid\nreceptor antagonist. DXM and its metabolite, dex-\ntrorphan, display specific biological features of ad-\ndiction, including tolerance, and are capable of in-\nducing specific psychiatric sequelae. There are\nmore profound and potentially life-threatening ef-\nfects at even higher doses. Dextrorphan has phar-\nmacodynamic properties and its intoxication effects\nproduce dissociation, a state that abusers seek.\nWithdrawal is manifested by a profound depres-\nsion.36 Chronic addiction has been described in the\nCoricidin Intoxication\nCoricidin HBP is a popular OTC antihistamine\nand decongestant that is safe and effective when\nused as directed on the product label. It is also sold\nas Coricidin D, Coricidin D (long acting), and\nCoricidin D (cold, flu, and sinus). These medica-\ntions contain a combination of dextromethorphan\nhydrobromide, chlorpheniramine maleate, phenyl-\npropanolamine hydrochloride, and acetaminophen.\nThe Texas Poison Network reported 78 cases of\nwere women. The mean age was 14.67 years, with\ndifferent symptoms were reported: tachycardia\niting (5.1%); dry mouth and hallucinations (3.9%);\ntremor (2.6%); and headache, dizziness, syncope,\nseizure, chest pain, and nystagmus (1.3% each).38\nRapture\nA 20-year-old man developed a brief psychotic ep-\nisode associated with per secutory delusional beliefs\nand auditory and visual hallucinations, leading him\nto commit arson. The episodes occurred 12 hours\nafter he took large doses of an OTC dietary sup-\nplement containing piperazine, a stimulant known\non the streets as \"rapture.\" The patient also used\nsmall doses of cannabis and nitrous oxide and had\nno prior psychiatric history. He reportedly com-\npletely recovered.39\nDimenhydrinate\nThe OTC anti-emetic dimenhydrinate (Gravol or\nDramamine) is a compound of diphenhydramine\nand 8-chlorotheophylline. Drug users abuse it for\nthe acute effects of euphoric sensations and hallu-\ncinations, whereas psychiatric patients abuse it be-\ncause of its anti-anxiety effects.40 Patients suffering\nfrom schizophrenia may be at risk because of its\nanticholinergic effects. One report suggests that\nclozapine reduces cravings for dimenhydrinate.40\nDimenhydrinate is an H1 histamine receptor\nantagonist but it interacts either directly or indi-\nrectly with other neurotransmitter systems, includ-\ning acetylcholine, serotonin, norepinephrine, dopa-\nmine, opioids, or adenosine. Animal behavioral\nstudies looking at self-administration, conditioned\nfor place preference, drug discrimination, and\nmodulation of operant responding, show that anti-\nhistamines have abuse potential. Further support\ncomes from reports of acute and chronic abuse of\ndimenhydrinate by humans.40\nDiphenhydramine\nThe antihistaminic drug diphenhydramine is\nmainly used as a sedative, hypnotic, and antiemetic.\nIn many countries it is available OTC under the\nname Benadryl. It is very common and generally\nregarded as a harmless drug. The recreational goal\nand the intoxication syndrome affect 2 separate\npopulations differently. People with a nonaddictive\ngenetic constitution use it as a long-term hypnotic\nto aid with sleeping. Those with a genetic predis-\nposition to addiction use it for the subjective high\nThe intoxication symptoms are also inconsis-\ntent. Some people present with somnolence, se-\ndation, and retardation. In people with a genetic\npredisposition to addiction, there are tachycar-\ndia, anticholinergic syndrome, agitation, halluci-\nnations, confusion, tremor, convulsions, delir-\nium, and coma. A toxic psychosis is possible.\nDiphenhydramine can be used orally or intrave-\nnously. Medical personnel are at risk for addic-\ntion because diphenhydramine is commonly on\nstock in hospitals and clinics to treat allergic\nreactions. Tolerance does exist with this OTC\nmedication, and withdrawal results in sedation\nHydroxycut\nBecause herbal products are not subject to the same\nrigorous Food and Drug Administration regula-\ntions that are required for prescription and OTC\nproducts, consumers unknowingly risk adverse ef-\nfects when taking these products. A 22-year-old\nman was hospitalized after unexplained seizure-like\nactivity and unresponsiveness. A urine toxicology\nscreen was negative for salicylates, acetaminophen,\nalcohol, and drugs-of-abuse. Medical history was\ninsignificant with the exception of recent (within 2\nweeks) ingestion of Hydroxycut, a dietary supple-\nment purported to enhance energy, build muscle,\nand burn fat. The agent contains ephedra alkaloids\nand caffeine, both of which are central nervous\nsystem stimulants. The seizure was attributed to\ntheir consumption. Because of a significant number\nof reported adverse events, the Food and Drug\nAdministration proposed regulations for dietary\nsupplements containing ephedra alkaloids and re-\nquested an independent review of case reports\nlinked to these products.44\nCyclizine\nAbuse of cyclizine hydrochloride, a nonprescrip-\ntion medication, was noted to occur frequently in\nUtah. Cyclizine is an OTC antihistamine. A retro-\nspective review of the Utah Poison Control Center\nrecords of patients younger than 18 years of age\nwho intentionally ingested cyclizine and demon-\nstrated abuse accounted for 89% of cyclizine toxic\ningestions. Hallucinations (70%) and confusion\nand disorientation (40%) were the most notable\nsymptoms. Tachycardia (52%) and systolic hyper-\ntension (69%) were frequently present in patients\nwho presented to a hospital. No serious complica-\ntions occurred. The researchers concluded that\nabuse of OTC medications by adolescents may be\nmore appealing than illicit drug use for numerous\nreasons, and may be more common than appreci-\nOTC Analgesics\nUsing high levels of OTC analgesics, including\naspirin and acetaminophen, over long periods of\ntime have been associated with dysphoric mood\nstates.
