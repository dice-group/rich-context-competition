Although intuitively appealing, the hypothesis\nthat nephrolithiasis is associated with decreased renal function\nhas not thoroughly been investigated. Because the prevalence\nof nephrolithiasis and chronic renal disease in westernized so-\ncieties has risen over the past three decades, we sought to de-\ntermine if persons with a history of kidney stones have lower\nrenal function relative to nonstone formers.\nMethods. We used data from the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) to compare es-\ntimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between persons over\nage 30 with and without a history of kidney stones. In total, 876\npersons with a history of stones, and 14,129 persons without\nstones were available for analysis.\nResults. We observed that the association between history of\nstones and estimated GFR depends on body mass index (BMI)\n(P = 0.004). After adjustment for potential confounding factors,\nmean estimated GFR in stone formers with a BMI 27 kg/m2\nwas 3.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 lower than that of similar nonstone for-\namong persons with a BMI <27 kg/m2. The probability of an\noverweight stone former having an estimated GFR between 30\nm2 was nearly twice that of a similar nonstone former [relative\nConclusion. Among overweight persons, nephrolithiasis may\nnot merely be a disease of stones, but may also reduce kidney\nfunction. Further work in alternate study samples is needed to\nvalidate this finding and determine the mechanisms responsible.\nThe impact of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) on\npublic health has been well documented. The prevalence\nof elevated serum creatinine (>1.5 mg/dL in men and\n>1.4 mg/dL in women) in the Framingham Heart Study\nwas estimated at 8.0% for men and 8.9% for women [1],\nhave end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [2]. Alarmingly, the\nKey words: nephrolithiasis, kidney stones, glomerular filtration rate.\nC 2005 by the International Society of Nephrology\nincidence of CRI is rising throughout the world [3]. With\nrespect to patient outcomes, CRI patients suffer from an\nincreased risk of mortality and cardiovascular disease rel-\native to the general population [4, 5]. Given the number\nof persons at risk for CRI and the prognosis associated\nwith the disease, identification of risk factors for the de-\nvelopment of renal disease has become a top priority to\nresearchers in the nephrology community.\nAs the incidence of CRI has risen over the past three\ndecades, the frequency of nephrolithiasis in westernized\nsocieties has also increased. Recently, the prevalence of\nnephrolithiasis among 20- to 74-year-old patients in the\nUnited States was estimated to be 5.2% during the years\nWhile much is known about the pathogenesis and treat-\nment of nephrolithiasis [7], the clinical consequences of\nstone disease remain relatively unidentified. In particu-\nlar, little is known about the effect of stone disease on\nrenal function. Our hypothesis is that repeated transient\nobstruction from stone passage, treatments such as ex-\ntracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), and possi-\nbly mineral deposits in the renal medulla may damage\nnephrons and reduce renal function [8\u00ad10]. The current\nstudy uses national health survey data collected during\nmeasured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR),\nbetween persons with and without a history of\nnephrolithiasis. We hypothesized that stone formers\nwould have lower estimated GFR when compared to sim-\nilar nonstone formers.\nMETHODS\nStudy population\nData from the NHANES III was used for this anal-\nysis. A detailed description of the methods used in the\nsurvey is available elsewhere [11]. Briefly, NHANES III\nwas one of several periodic surveys conducted by the Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics. The survey, conducted\ntimates of health and nutritional status in the civilian non-\ninstitutionalized United States population aged 2 months\n686 Gillen et al: Decreased renal function and nephrolithiasis\nand older. Data collected in NHANES III included so-\nciodemographic factors, medical history, health-related\nbehaviors, and medication use. Ultimately, 33,994 per-\nsons were interviewed. In the current study, we limit our\nanalysis to adults aged 30 to 90 years with information on\nthe lifetime occurrence of kidney stones (N = 15,005).\nThe choice to restrict our analysis to individuals over\n30 years of age was based primarily on two factors. First,\nthe prevalence of stones among individuals less than\n30 years of age is quite low, yet these individuals carry\ngreat sampling weight in the NHANES survey (due\nto oversampling of the elderly). Thus, any conclusions\ndrawn would be quite heavily influenced by a relatively\nsmall number of stone formers in this age group. Sec-\nond, we hypothesized that the effect of nephrolithiasis\non renal function is a cumulative one that may take many\nyears to manifest. Thus by focusing on individuals over\n30 years of age, this would provide ample time for the\neffects of stone disease on renal function to begin to\ndevelop.\nExposure and outcome definitions\nThe primary exposure in our analysis was any history\nof kidney stones. All participants over age 30 who an-\nswered \"yes\" to the question \"Have you ever had a kid-\nney stone?\" (N = 876) were considered to have a history\nof nephrolithiasis. Persons who responded \"don't know\"\n(N = 13) or did not respond (N = 8) were excluded. The\noutcome of interest was taken to be renal function as\nestimated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease\n(MDRD) equation [12]. Thus, GFR was estimated as\nGFRMDRD\nCr\nyrs\nalb\nwhere SCr\ndenotes serum creatinine, BUN denotes blood\nurea nitrogen, and Salb\ndenotes serum albumin. Coresh\net al [13] have reported that the assay used for measur-\ning serum creatinine in the NHANES study resulted in\ncreatinine levels systematically higher than those used to\nobtain the MDRD prediction model. As a consequence,\nthey suggest creatinine values from NHANES III be\nrecalibrated to account for an average overestimate of\n0.23 mg/dL. All analyses presented here have performed\nthe recommended recalibration.\nStatistical analysis\nAll reported point estimates and standard errors incor-\nporate the NHANES III survey weights which account\nfor unequal probability of selection into the NHANES\nsample and survey nonresponse. Variance estimates were\ncomputed via the method of linearization [14]. Patient\ncharacteristics, adjusted for stone history and age, were\ncompared using linear regression for continuous covari-\nates and logistic regression for categorical covariates.\nMultiple linear regression was used to compare mean\nestimated GFR between stone formers and nonstone\nformers. Covariates identified as potential confounders\nin the relationship between estimated GFR and stone\nhistory were adjusted for. These included age, gender,\nrace (African American vs. other), boxy mass index\n(BMI), systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c\n),\ndiabetes, history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial\ninfarction, stroke, congestive heart failure), smoking sta-\ntus (ever vs. never), health insurance status, and use of\nprescription diuretics. Other covariates considered as ad-\njustment variables but not presented here include alco-\nhol use, selected dietary factors, including calcium intake,\nhousehold income, and marital status. Multiplicative in-\nteractions between stone history and age, gender, race,\ndiabetes, and BMI were formally tested. The presented\nanalyses include adjustment for BMI as a continuous lin-\near covariate. However, to address the potential for resid-\nual confounding by BMI, secondary analyses adjusting\nfor BMI as a categorical covariate (based upon quintiles\nof the distribution) were also performed. As these results\ndid not qualitatively change our findings, we have chosen\nto present models adjusting for BMI as a continuous lin-\near covariate. In addition, a separate linear regression\nmodel among persons with a history of stones was con-\nducted to examine the association between prior stone\ntreatment and estimated GFR.\nIt was a priori hypothesized that stone formers would\nnot merely experience a downward shift in the distribu-\ntion of GFR, but that the distribution of GFR among\nstone formers would be skewed to the right, resulting\nin a higher proportion of persons in the lower-tail of\nthe distribution of GFR. To test this hypothesis, esti-\nmatedGFRwascategorizedusingcutpointssuggestedby\nthe National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Dialysis Out-\ncomes and Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) guidelines for\nMultinomial logistic regression was used to compare the\nrelative risk of having an estimated GFR in a lower\ncategory relative to the highest category between per-\nsons with and without nephrolithiasis. Model based es-\ntimates are reported as relative risk ratios comparing\nstone formers with nonstone formers.

After adjustment for those confounders consid-\nered above, surgery, ESWL, nor the use of stone med-\nications was found to be significantly associated with\nreduced GFR.\nGillen et al: Decreased renal function and nephrolithiasis 689\nCONCLUSION\nUsing a nationally representative sample, we found\nthat among overweight persons, stone formers had lower\nestimated GFR when compared to similar nonstone for-\nmers. Further, the probability of an overweight stone for-\nmer having an estimated GFR between 30 and 59 mL/\nwas observed to be nearly twice that of a similar non-\nstone former. However, no significant differences in\nestimated GFR comparing stone formers to nonstone for-\nmers were observed among persons with a BMI less than\n27 kg/m2. These finding imply that among overweight in-\ndividuals, nephrolithiasis may not simply be a disease of\nstone formation in the collecting system but also involves\nthe kidneys in ways that lead to decreased nephron num-\nber or function.\nOur finding that a history of stones is associated with\nlower estimated GFR among persons with a BMI greater\nthan 27 kg/m2 may be attributable to many factors. First, it\nhas been shown that formation of calcium oxalate stones\nis associated with the deposits of apatite particles in the\nbasement membranes of the thin loops of Henle and in\nthe deep medullary interstitium [10]. Although intersti-\ntial inflammation and fibrosis, and tubule cell injury and\nloss were not prominent, the particles achieve high den-\nsities in some regions and certainly could cause nephron\ninjury. Also, stone passage itself causes transient obstruc-\ntion, and obstruction is a well established initiator of\nrenal damage. Finally, ESWL causes renal injury in exper-\nimental animals, and may result in a loss of renal function\namong humans. Although most clinical studies suggest\nthat initial declines in GFR improve with time [17], long-\nterm effects are unknown. Although we did not observe\ndifferences in estimated GFR due to stone treatment,\nour data were limited with respect to treatment history\n(neither duration and dose of medication nor numbers\nof surgeries or ESWL were collected in NHANES), and\ngiven the limited number of individuals having under-\ngone therapy our analysis was not adequately powered\nto investigate this association.\nWe observed an association between stone history and\ndecreased GFR only among overweight individuals (BMI\n>27 kg/m2). At least two possible explanations for this\ndifferential effect exist. First, stone type may be associ-\nated with reduced GFR and higher body weight. Both\nstruvite stones and uric acid stones are associated with\na greater loss of renal function when compared to other\nstone types [18\u00ad21], and are also associated with higher\nbody weight. These associations may partially explain\nthe interaction between BMI and stone history that was\nobserved in our analysis. However, these stone types\naccount for no more than 20% of stones, overall. An addi-\ntional explanation may be that renal hemodynamics are\naltered in heavier individuals; higher BMI has been as-\nsociated with an increase in filtration fraction [22]. This\ncould raise intraglomerular pressure, and increase sus-\nceptibility to renal damage. Renal hemodynamic changes\nreturn to normal following weight loss [23]. This hypoth-\nesis is supported by studies finding that obesity is a risk\nfactor for decreased GFR in various conditions [24\u00ad28].\nMoreover, elevated BMI has been found to predict new\nonset kidney disease in a recent longitudinal study [29].\nTherefore,ifkidneystonediseaseresultsinsomeabsolute\nloss of nephrons, overweight individuals may experience\na greater loss of kidney function with time.\nOur study does suffer from limitations. First, we are\nlimited in our ability to adequately estimate an associa-\ntion between stone history and renal function in young\nadults due to a lack of data on stone formers less than\nage 30. Further data on young stone formers are needed\nto address this issue; however, this should not affect the\nresults found among older stone formers. Next, we did\nnot have information on the total number or type of\nstones for individuals. Although this data may have been\nhelpful in further investigating the link between stone\ndisease and reduced GFR, it was not necessary for estab-\nlishing an association between stone history and GFR.\nIt is unlikely that perfect classification of the exposure\nof interest was attained in the NHANES survey. With\nthis said, the study is not likely to suffer from recall bias\nsince kidney stones are painful and rarely mistaken for\nany other disease. Thus any misclassification in the study\nwould likely be nondifferential and would only result in\nan underestimation in the magnitude of the association\nbetween stone history and GFR. Finally, since this is an\nobservational study there is the potential for unmeasured\nconfounders. One example is the use of thiazides, as they\nare commonly prescribed in the stone-forming popula-\ntion and have been linked to reduced GFR. Although\nspecific information on the use of thiazides is not avail-\nable in NHANES, we were able to adjust for use of any\nprescription diuretics, which did not change the results\nof the analysis. In addition, limited data on dietary fac-\ntors previously linked to stone formation, such as calcium\nintake [6], were available from NHANES via 24-hour re-\ncall. Secondary analyses adjusting for dietary factors also\ndid not affect the presented results.\nOur findings indicate that nephrolithiasis may be asso-\nciated with nephron damage in a significant number of\nindividuals. That an increased BMI may potentiate re-\nnal damage in this setting is important, as persons with\nstones tend to be heavy. Further work in alternate study\nsamples is needed to validate this finding and to deter-\nmine the mechanisms for the association between kid-\nney stones and decreased GFR. However, this is the first\nstudy to show such a connection in a nationally repre-\nsentative sample of the United States population.
