The\nneurological symptoms are probably a result of a glial-driven,\nhost inflammatory response to the bacterium. However, the\nspecific contributions of individual glial and other support\ncell types to the pathogenesis of neuroborreliosis are rela-\ntively unexplored. The goal of this project was to charac-\nterize specific astrocyte and endothelial cell responses to\nB. burgdorferi. Primary human astrocytes and primary HB-\nMEC (human brain microvascular endothelial cells) were in-\ncubated with B. burgdorferi over a 72-h period and the\ntranscriptional responses to the bacterium were analyzed\nby real-time PCR arrays. There was a robust increase in\nseveral surveyed chemokine and related genes, including\nIL (interleukin)-8, for both primary astrocytes and HBMEC.\nArray results were confirmed with individual sets of PCR\nprimers. The production of specific chemokines by both as-\ntrocytes and HBMEC in response to B. burgdorferi, including\nIL-8, CXCL-1, and CXCL-10, were confirmed by ELISA. These\nresults demonstrate that primary astrocytes and HBMEC re-\nspond to virulent B. burgdorferi by producing a number\nof chemokines.

These `neu-\nrovascular units', which include vascular endothelia, glia, and\nneurons, work together to maintain normal brain function\n(Grab et al., 2011). Breakdown of the BBB (blood\u00adbrain bar-\nrier) and blood\u00adCSF (cerebrospinal fluid) barrier can facilitate\nentry of both microorganisms and activated immune cells\ninto the CNS. Of critical importance to the development and\nmaintenance of the BBB is the astrocyte. Astrocytes are glial\ncells that vastly outnumber neurons in the brain. Astrocytes\nare involved in metabolic interactions with neurons, and\nalso form close associations with endothelia and fibroblasts\n(Magistretti and Ransom, 2002). The interaction of astrocytic\nendfeet with the endothelium of the BBB is key to the\nC. A. Brissette and others\ninduction of many barrier properties, including tight junction\nformation and the expression and localization of trans-\nporters. Astrocytes and the endothelium of the BBB respond\nto various insults by producing a wide range of chemokines\nand neurotrophic agents. Their close association with many\ncell types of the CNS and its barriers highlights the impor-\ntance of understanding the response of astrocytes and brain\nendothelial cells to pathogens that cause neuroinflammation.\nOver 90% of all arthropod-borne diseases in the USA is\ncaused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Radolf et al.,\n2012). B. burgdorferi is the agent of Lyme disease, which can\nmanifest in skin, joints, the heart, and the brain. Neurobor-\nreliosis, which occurs in up to 15% of untreated patients\n(Hildenbrand et al., 2009), results in meningitis, headache,\nand facial nerve palsy (Rupprecht et al., 2008). Peripheral\nnerve disease is also common, and long-term symptoms re-\nmain in up to 50% of patients even 5 years post-treatment\n(Ljostad and Henriksen, 2008). The ability of B. burgdorferi to\ninfect immunocompetent humans and other vertebrates for\nextensive periods of time, (Moody et al., 1990; de Souza et al.,\ncoupled with the potential for long-term sequelae, make this\ndisease particularly insidious.\nThe Lyme disease spirochete has an affinity for the CNS\n(Rupprecht et al., 2008). B. burgdorferi can be isolated from\nthe CSF of humans as early as 18 days after the bite of an\ninfected tick (Fallon et al., 2010). In a rhesus macaque model,\nthe spirochete can be detected in the leptomeninges, dorsal\nroot ganglia, and occasionally the parenchyma of the brain\n(Cadavid et al., 2000). B. burgdorferi has the potential to\ncross the BBB and come into direct contact with the brain\nmicrovascular endothelium and astrocytes. The spirochete\nfreely crosses brain vascular endothelial cells in the presence\nof the proenzyme plasminogen (Grab et al., 2005). Despite\nthe potential for access and interaction of B. burgdorferi\nwith glia, almost nothing is known about the interaction of\nB. burgdorferi with human astrocytes. In a single published\nstudy in which the Lyme spirochete was incubated with hu-\nman astrocytes, the authors found a significant up-regulation\nof MMP-9 (matrix metalloprotease 9), which may play a role\nin the breakdown of brain barriers (Perides et al., 1999). Sev-\neral studies with murine and non-human primate astrocytes,\nhowever, suggest that these cells could play important roles\nin the innate immune response to B. burgdorferi. For exam-\nple, B. burgdorferi induces IL (interleukin)-6, IL-10, and TNF\n(tumor necrosis factor ) from murine astrocytes (Chauhan\nreceptor NOD2 (Sterka et al., 2006). Astrocytes from non-\nhuman primates respond to B. burgdorferi by up-regulating\nIL-6 and the chemokines IL-8, CCL (CC chemokine ligand) 3\nSimilarly, while the response of heart and umbilical en-\ndothelial cells to B. burgdorferi has been examined, little is\nknown about B. burgdorferi interaction with HBMEC (human\nbrain microvascular endothelial cells), and to our knowledge,\nno studies have focused on primary HBMEC (Boggemeyer\nBecause of the critical roles of astrocytes and HBMEC in\nsensing, responding, and adapting the neural environment to\npathogens, and the paucity of data in this regard, we wanted\nto delineate the astrocytic response to B. burgdorferi. We\nwere particularly interested in the expression of chemokines\nbecause of their clear import to the trafficking of leukocytes\nto the site of infection. In this work, we demonstrate that\nB. burgdorferi up-regulates the expression of several key\nchemokines specifically from human astrocytes and HBMEC.\nPrimary cultures of human astrocytes\nPrimary cultures of human astrocytes were obtained from\nScienCell Research Laboratories (catalog no.1800) and main-\ntained on poly-L-lysine coated flasks (2 g/cm2, T-75) in the\nastrocyte medium (ScienCell, catalog no. 1801). To stimulate\nthe cells, astrocytes were used between passages 3 and 4 at\n75% confluence. Prior to Borrelia stimulation, medium was\nreplaced with antibiotic-free astrocyte medium. Astrocytes\nwere stimulated with B. burgdorferi at an MOI (multiplicity\nPrimary cultures of HBMEC\nPrimary HBMEC were obtained from ScienCell Research Lab-\noratories (catalog no. 1000) and maintained on fibronectin\ncoated flasks (2 g/cm2, T-75) in ECM (endothelial cell\nmedium, ScienCell; catalog # 1001). To stimulate the cells,\nHBMEC were used between passages 3 and 4 at 75% con-\nfluence. Prior to Borrelia stimulation, ECM was replaced\nwith ECM minus antibiotics.

Briefly, each reaction contained 5.5 l nuclease-free\nGreen Supermix +\n-5 l template DNA or water (no template\ncontrol). The QPCR was performed in 40 cycles following an\ninitial 10 min denaturation at 95C. Each cycle consisted of a\n1 min annealing step performed at 60C, followed by a 15 s\nmelting interval at 95C. Product melting curves were gener-\nated at the end of the reaction using a stepped temperature\nof all transcripts were compared with housekeeping genes\n(-actin and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydro-\ngenase)) and the relative changes in gene expression were\ncompared with those of untreated cells using the 2- CT\nmethod where CT\n= threshold cycle. This method was used\non each individual example with the untreated sample as\nthe comparator (Schmittgen and Livak, 2008). All samples\nwere analyzed in triplicate from at least two independent\nbiological replicates per time point.\nELISA\nCulture supernatants were removed after stimulation and\nperformed according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D\nTable 1 Primer sets used for QPCR\nPrimer name RefSeq accession no.

A. Brissette and others\nCommercial QPCR arrays were used to quantify the transcrip-\ntion of a panel of human chemokines, chemokine-like genes,\nand their receptors. Threshold cycle values across experi-\nments and between replicates were very reproducible, with\nstandard deviations averaging about 1 cycle across the array\n(results not shown). Data were analyzed and fold changes\nbetween control and treated samples using the manufac-\nturer's software (SABiosciences), with a threshold of 3-fold\nchange in gene expression. For both astrocytes and HBMEC,\nmost of the transcriptional changes occurred early, at 6 h\npost-stimulation. In the case of astrocytes, out of 84 genes\nrepresented on the array, only eight genes (10.5%) were dif-\nferentially regulated with a fold change above 3 at 6 h. Genes\nup-regulated more than 3-fold in all biological replicates at\nfew genes were down-regulated in response to B. burgdor-\nferi stimulation. At 12 h, CCL11 (eosinophil chemoattractant\nand CCL4 (NK (natural killer) cell and monocyte chemoat-\ntractant) were down-regulated 6- and 3.2-fold, respectively.\nAt 24 h post-stimulation, the chemokine receptor CXCR (CXC\nchemokine receptor)3 was down-regulated 4.3-fold, and at\n72 h, the chemokine receptor CXCR4 was down-regulated\n3-fold while the neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8 was down-\nregulated 4.9-fold, in relation to unstimulated cultures.

A key\nfeature associated with infection is disruption of the BBB,\nleading to enhanced neutrophil extravasation into the CNS\n(McColl et al., 2008). However, the contribution of brain mi-\ncrovasculature and glial inflammatory activity to the recruit-\nment of systemic, potentially neurotoxic, inflammatory cells\nremains ill defined (Allen et al., 2012).\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that primary HBMEC and\nprimary human astrocytes express a variety of chemokines\nand chemokine receptors in response to the spirochete,\nB. burgdorferi. These chemokines may contribute to re-\ncruitment of inflammatory cells and the onset and pro-\ngression of neuronal damage leading to neuroborreliosis\n(Allen et al., 2012). Indeed, non-human primate astrocytes\nexpress the neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8 in response to\nB. burgdorferi (Ramesh et al., 2009). In regards to human pa-\ntients, IL-8 is found in the CSF of individuals with neurobor-\nAlthough there are many potential sources of IL-8 in the\nCSF, we demonstrate that this key neutrophil chemoattrac-\ntant is also made by human astrocytes in response to B.\nburgdorferi. In addition, we demonstrate that another neu-\ntrophil recruiting chemokine, CXCL-1, is also produced by\nastrocytes. Astrocytes possess the receptor for CXCL-1, al-\nlowing for an autocrine feedback loop that can prolong and\namplify inflammation in the CNS (Dorf et al., 2000).\nThe precise role of astrocytes in the pathogenesis of Lyme\nborreliosis is unclear. In the macaque model of the disease,\nmicroglia are clearly involved in the early inflammation and\nelaborate a number of cytokines and chemokines; however,\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nC.

Data represent two biological replicates per time point, with each sample run in triplicate. Error\nbars represent S.E.M.\nthere is also significant evidence for astrocyte contribution to\nthe inflammatory response to B. burgdorferi, both in vivo and\nmary rhesus macaque astrocytes stimulated with B. burgdor-\nferi components elaborate both IL-6 and TNF, which lead\nto astrocyte proliferation and apoptosis, respectively (Ramesh\net al., 2003). Interestingly, we also saw up-regulation of TNF\nfrom human astrocytes in response to B. burgdorferi at 6 h\n(Table 2); TNF is a potent inducer of inflammatory responses\nand thus may serve to amplify the chemokine responses we\nobserved. There is also evidence for astrogliosis in human\nneuroborreliosis, as evidenced by increased GFAP (glial fibril-\nlary acidic protein) in the CSF of patients (Dotevall et al. 1996;\n1999). These data suggest that in human patients, astrocyte\nproliferation and activation occurs in response to the spiro-\nchete, underlying the potential role of astrocytes in disease\nprogression.\nLikewise, HBMEC probably contribute to chemokine re-\nsponses and subsequent inflammation in neuroborreliosis.\nOur results demonstrate that protein expression of both neu-\ntrophil chemoattractants CXCL-1 and IL-8 was strongly up-\nregulated by HBMEC in response to B. burgdorferi. Stimula-\ntion of endothelial cells from other anatomical sites with B.\nburgdorferi resulted in both robust IL-8 transcription (Burns\nMEC stimulated with Streptococcus pneumoniae up-regulate\nIL-8 and CXCL-1, suggesting the elaboration of neutrophil-\nspecific chemokines may be a common response to bacterial\ninsults at the BBB (Banerjee et al., 2010). In previous stud-\nies, transfected HBMEC incubated with B. burgdorferi did\nnot demonstrate up-regulation of cytokines or chemokines\nat 5 h post-stimulation by ELISA, suggesting that HBMEC do\nnot store pre-formed chemokines and must synthesize these\nattractants de novo upon exposure to B. burgdorferi (Grab\n226 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nAstrocyte/endothelial response to Borrelia\net al., 2007). The role of endothelial cells in neuroborreliosis\nhas also been examined by observing spirochetal translo-\ncation across single-cell monolayers of transformed HBMEC\nrole for host plasminogen and Ca2 + signaling in transloca-\ntion, there is scarce published data on the contribution of\nchemokines to the disruption of the BBB. However, the ex-\npression of inflammatory chemokines by the human BBB has\nnot been well characterized in vivo or in multi-cell mod-\nels in vitro, highlighting the need for further investigation\nThe significance of increased expression of IL-8 and CXCL-\n1 by brain endothelia and astrocytes lies in their role in neu-\ntrophil recruitment into the CNS (Johnson et al., 2011). IL-8\nhas been shown to act as an endothelial chemoattractant\nfor neutrophils and is directly involved with neutrophil mi-\ngration on endothelial surfaces (Burns et al., 1997). Allen,\net al., (2012) have demonstrated recently that migration of\nneutrophils through the neurovascular unit shifts the neu-\ntrophils to a neurotoxic phenotype resulting in increased re-\nlease of proteases, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and\nNETs (neutrophil extracellular traps). They demonstrated that\nwhen neutrophils harvested immediately following CNS en-\ndothelial transmigration were co-cultured with primary cor-\ntical neurons, they induced significant neuronal loss within\n30 min of application. Neutrophils that had not been ac-\ntivated by CNS endothelial transmigration demonstrate no\nneurotoxicity. Others have shown that co-culture of acti-\nvated neutrophils with primary hippocampal neurons (Dinkel\net al., 2004) or dissociated dorsal root ganglion neurons\n(Shaw et al., 2008) also resulted in massive neuronal loss.\nThus, the B. burgdorferi-induced elaboration of IL-8 and\nCXCL-1 by astrocytes and HBMEC probably contribute to\nthe neural damage associated with neuroborreliosis through\nrecruitment of neurotoxic neutrophils.\nCXCL-10, a chemokine important for T-cell accumula-\ntion, was also significantly up-regulated in B. burgdorferi-\nstimulated astrocytes and HBMEC. High levels of CXCL-10\nare observed in the CNS of humans with neuroborreliosis\n(Henningsson et al., 2011). Indeed, it has been postulated\nthat CXCL-10 creates a chemokine gradient between the CSF\nand serum and recruits CD4 + T-cells into the CSF of patients\nwith neuroborreliosis (Lepej et al., 2005). CXCL-10 plays an\nimportant role in other CNS infections, and is one of the\nmost highly expressed chemokines in response to West Nile\nVirus (Lim and Murphy, 2011). Interestingly, CXCL-10 and its\nreceptor CXCR3 are expressed by neurons (Lim et al., 2011).\nWe did not observe up-regulation of CXCR3 on astrocytes\n(results not shown); suggesting that, in vivo, neurons may\nbe the primary cell type responding to this chemokine. In-\ndeed, neuronal apoptosis is mediated by increased expression\nof CXCL-10 in response to a variety of infectious insults in-\ncluding simian HIV encephalitis (Sui et al., 2006). Clearly,\nthe crosstalk between neurons and astrocytes in CNS in-\nfections is key to determining the ultimate outcome of the\ndisease.\nThe fact that very few chemokines and related genes\nchanged in response to stimulation with B. burgdorferi was\nunexpected. However, these data make sense in the context\nof a spirochetal pathogen. These organisms have a repu-\ntation for `stealth' and persistence even in immunocompe-\ntent hosts. While possessing a number of pathogen asso-\nciated molecular patterns and inflammatory stimulants like\nlipoproteins, B. burgdorferi lacks LPS (lipopolysaccharide) in\nits outer membranes. Therefore B. burgdorferi's effects on\nglia and other supporting cells such as HBMEC, may be more\nsubtle than that observed in acute, severe infections of the\nTogether these data and that presented herein show that\nB. burgdorferi can stimulate up-regulation of chemokines\nfrom brain microvascular endothelia and astrocytes, which\npotentiate entry of neurotoxic neutrophils into the brain.\nSuch an event can lead to neuronal loss and may contribute to\nthe cognitive impairments and other neurological deficits as-\nsociated with neuroborreliosis. This is the first study to inves-\ntigate comprehensively the chemokine-centered responses of\nprimary human astrocytes and HBMEC to B. burgdorferi. Un-\nderstanding the contributions of individual glia cell types to\nthe damage induced by B. burgdorferi will ultimately allow\nfor the development of targeted, cell type-specific interven-\ntions and therapies.\nCatherine Brissette and John Watt conceived and designed\nthe experiments.
