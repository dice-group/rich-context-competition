We conducted this study to determine the combined effects\nof baseline vulnerability and precipitating events on the development of functional dependence.\nMethods. We analyzed data from two prospective, population-based cohort studies. The development cohort included 799\ncommunity-living persons, 72 years of age and older, who were independent in their activities of daily living (ADLs). The vali-\ndation cohort included 1,051 comparable persons. Participants were classified by baseline vulnerability, defined on the basis of\nphysical performance, cognitive status, and age, and by exposure to potential precipitating events, determined from information\ngathered from acute care hospital admissions. The primary outcome was the onset of functional dependence, defined as a new\ndisability in one or more of the seven ADLs at the l-year follow-up interview or admission to a skilled nursing facility prior to\nthe l-year interview.\nResults. Functional dependence developed in 109 (13.6%) participants in the development cohort and in 100 (9.3%) partici-\npants in the validation cohort. The rates of functional dependence for the low, intermediate, and high vulnerability groups were\nFor the four categories (none, mild, moderate, severe) of precipitating events, the rates of functional dependence were 9.0%,\ncohort. For both cohorts, when baseline vulnerability and precipitating events were analyzed in cross-stratified format, the rate\nof functional dependence increased progressively from low-risk to high-risk groups in all directions (double-gradient phe-\nnomenon). The contributions of baseline vulnerability and precipitating events to the development of functional dependence\nwere independent and statistically significant.\nConclusions. Among community-living older persons, baseline vulnerability and precipitating hospital events contribute in-\ndependently to the development of functional dependence and should each be targeted for intervention when developing strate-\ngies aimed at forestalling the onset of functional dependence.\nMAINTAINING independent function is a primary goal of\nhealth care for older persons (1). To achieve this goal,\nclinicians caring for older persons need to know not only who is\nat risk for becoming dependent, but also why dependence devel-\nops among those who are at risk. To date, most published re-\nports of functional dependence have focused on evaluating base-\nline risk (or vulnerability). Large epidemiologic studies, for\nexample, have identified several demographic and health-related\nrisk factors for functional dependence (2-5). More recently, in-\nvestigators have focused on the effects of impairments in do-\nmains relevant to functioning. Guralnik and associates (6) have\nshown that objective measures of lower-extremity function are\nhighly predictive ofboth decline in mobility and new disability\nin activities of daily living (ADLs) among community-living\nolder persons. Gill and coworkers have demonstrated, further-\nmore, that poor performance on tests of physical capability is\nstrongly associated with the onset ofADL disability in older\npersons with (7) and without (8) cognitive impairment, and that\nimpairments in physical performance and cognitive status con-\ntribute independently to the risk ofADL disability (9).\nAttention to baseline vulnerability alone, however, does not\nfully explain why older persons develop functional dependence.\nA sizable number of vulnerable elders, for example, do not de-\nvelop functional dependence, and many elders who develop\nfunctional dependence have low vulnerability (6-9). These\nfindings should not be surprising. While physical and cognitive\nimpairments may make one vulnerable to events that precipi-\ntate functional dependence (l0,11), they do not cause or precip-\nitate functional dependence themselves.\nIn contrast to the accumulating body of knowledge concern-\ning risk factors for functional dependence, relatively little is\nknown about the events, other than catastrophic events such as\na stroke or hip fracture, that actually precipitate functional de-\npendence; and nothing is known about the interplay of baseline\nvulnerability and precipitating events on the development of\nfunctional dependence. These gaps in our knowledge base must\nbe filled if we are to better understand the disabling process and\nto develop effective and efficient strategies to prevent or slow\nfunctional decline.\nThe objective of this study was to determine the combined\neffects of baseline vulnerability and precipitating events on the\ndevelopment of functional dependence. We postulated that\nfunctional dependence, like delirium (12) and injurious falls\n(13), involves a complex interrelationship between baseline\nvulnerability and precipitating events, such that older persons\nwho are highly vulnerable may develop functional dependence\nwith any precipitating event, even of mild severity. Conversely,\nolder persons with low vulnerability will require a noxious in-\nsult or major event before they develop functional dependence.\nAs potential precipitating events, we focused on acute care hos-\npital admissions because their occurrence is readily identifiable\nand they often lead to new or worsening functional dependence\nin older persons (14). We developed and tested our model offunc-\ntional dependence in two independent cohorts of community-\nliving older persons.\nDevelopment Study\nSubjects.-Potential participants in the development study were\nmembers ofProject Safety, a probability sample of community-\nliving persons, age 72 years and older, living in New Haven,\nConnecticut, in 1989. The sampling technique has been de-\nscribed in detail elsewhere (15). Fourteen hundred thirty-six\npersons were originally contacted. Only 44 (3%) failed to meet\nthe three eligibility criteria, which included the ability to speak\nEnglish, Spanish, or Italian; to follow simple commands; and to\nwalk across a room without the assistance of another person.\na comprehensive assessment in their homes by a trained re-\nsearch nurse using standard instruments.\nParticipants for the current study included the 933 members\nwho (a) were independent at baseline (requiring no personal as-\nsistance) in seven ADLs: bathing, dressing, transferring from\nbed to chair, walking, eating, toileting, and grooming; and (b)\nhad complete data on baseline vulnerability. Among those eligi-\nparticipants in the development cohort. Compared with those in\nthe development cohort, persons who died or who had missing\noutcome data were similar in age, gender, education, marital\nstatus, and number of chronic conditions.\nTable1.Vulnerability ModelforFunctionalDependence\n*For the development cohort, participants were asked to walk back and\nforth over a 1O-foot course \"as quickly as possible.\" For the validation cohort,\nparticipants were asked to walk to the end of an 8-foot course at their usual\nspeed, and scores were dichotomized at 13 seconds.\n[Scores <24 on the Mini-Mental State Examinationdenote persons who are\ncognitivelyimpaired (17).\n:j:The low-risk group includes participantswho scored 10seconds or less on\nrapid gaitregardlessof their MMSE score or their age.\nRisk Group Rapid Gait* (seconds) MMSE Scoret\nLow:j:\nIntermediate\nHigh\nAND\nOR\nAge (years)\nBaseline vulnerability.-To assess baseline vulnerability, we\nfocused on three factors-physical performance, cognitive status,\nand age-that have been shown in previous studies to be most\nstrongly associated with the development of functional depen-\ndence (7-9,16) and that were also available for analysis in the\nvalidation cohort. Physical performance was assessed with the\nrapid gait test. Participants were asked to walk back and forth\nover a 10-foot course \"as quickly as possible,\" thus testing maxi-\nmum speed ofperformance. Scores were dichotomized at 10 sec-\nonds, based on our previous work demonstrating a threshold re-\nsponse (at the worst quartile) between rapid gait scores and the\ndevelopment of functional dependence (7,8). Cognitive status\nwas assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE;\n(17)]. Scores were dichotomized at 24 to distinguish participants\nTable 2.CriteriaUsedToClassify theMagnitude ofPrecipitating Events* andtheFrequency ofSpecific Events intheDevelopmentandValidation Cohorts\nCriteria\nNone\nNo hospitaladmissions during follow-upperiod\nMild\nLOSt ~ 7 days and not acute trauma:j: or strokeor\ncardiac/respiratory arrest or coma or intubated\nModerate (any of the following)\nLOS>7d~sandnmSEVERE\nAcute trauma and LOS ~ 5 days\nStrokeand LOS ~ 7 days and not hemiplegia\nComa or intubatedand LOS ~ 14 days\nSevere(anyof the following)\nAcute trauma and LOS> 5 days\nStrokewith hemiplegia or stroke and LOS> 7 days\nIntubatedand LOS> 14 days\nMajor thoracic/abdominalsurgery\u00a7 and LOS> 10days\nAcute renal failure/liverfailure/pancreatitis and LOS > 14days\nLOS> 21 days and not psychiatric admission\n*A complete set of operational detailsis availableupon request.\ntLength of stay.\n:j:Includes fractures,other injurious falls,motor vehicleaccidents.\n\u00a7Includeslobectomy,hemicolectomy,coronary arterybypass surgery.\nDevelopmentCohort\nValidationCohort\nwho werecognitivelyimpaired from those who were cognitively\nintact (17).Age was dichotomized at 85 years to distinguish the\nold-oldfrom the young-old (16).Differentcombinationsof these\nthree dichotomousfactors were subsequentlyevaluated.The se-\nlection of the final vulnerability model, shown in Table 1, was\nguided by two basic principles.First,the strategyshould identify\nparticipantsat low,intermediate,and high risk for functional de-\npendence;and second,the strategyshouldidentifya sizablenum-\nber of participantsin each of the three risk groups to ensure that\nthe combined effects of baseline vulnerability and precipitating\nevents could be adequately evaluated.The risk of functional de-\npendence among participants who scored 10 seconds or less on\nrapid gaitwas low regardlessof the participants'MMSE scoreor\nage.Alternative cutpointsfor the MMSE and age were evaluated\nbut did not improveupon the finalvulnerability model.\nPrecipitatingevents.-Information on precipitating eventswas\ngathered from acute care hospital admissions.These admissions\nwereidentified duringthe l-year follow-up periodfromthree com-\nplementary sources: extractedhospitaldischarge records, datatapes\nfrom the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), and a\ncomputerized database attheVeteransAffairs (VA) MedicalCenter\nin WestHaven,Connecticut Hospitaldischargerecordswere sur-\nveyedon a continuous basisat thetwoacutecarehospitalsin New\nHaven.Thesetwohospitals accountforover90% of acutecaread-\nmissionsfor personslivingin New Haven.For each admission,a\nshortextractionform was completed,whichincludedinformation\non hospital, date of admission and discharge, major procedures,\nand principal diagnoses at discharge, coded according to the\nInternational Classification ofDiseases, 9th Revision, Clinical\nModification. Comparableinformationon admissions to hospitals\nwithin and outside of New Haven was obtained from the HCFA\ndata tapes.These admissionshad beenidentifiedpreviouslyusing\na set of matching algorithms described in an earlier report (18).\nFinally, forparticipants who indicatedthattheyhad been hospital-\nized at the VAMedical Center, we searched the Decentralized\nHospitalComputerProgram(DHCP)databaseforadmissions dur-\ning the follow-up period and extracted information on length of\nstay, majorprocedures, andprincipal diagnoses atdischarge.\nToclassifyprecipitatingevents,we used information on prin-\ncipal diagnoses at discharge, major procedures, and length of\nstay, an important marker of illness severity (16). Precipitating\nevents were classified as none when there were no hospital ad-\nmissions or, otherwise, as mild, moderate, or severe based on\nthe criteria shown in Table 2. These criteria were developed a\npriori using clinical judgment, but were later validated empiri-\ncally as part of the study. None of the criteria denoted a func-\ntional outcome. All classifications were made without knowl-\nedge of the participants' outcome state.The intrarater reliability\nof the classificationscheme was excellent (Kappa=1.0).\nOutcome.-Self-reported ADLs were reassessed during a\nfollow-up interview in the home at one year. When available,\nproxy responses were used for participants who were unable to\ncomplete this assessment (0.8%).Admissions to skilled nursing\nfacilitieswere ascertainedfrom two sources:(a) the Connecticut\nLong Term Care Registry, using a previously described match-\ning procedure (19); and (b) the HCFAdata tapes, which provide\ninformation on Medicare-reimbursed admissions to facilities\nwithin and outside of Connecticut. The outcome was the onset\nof functional dependence, defined as a new disability (unable to\nperform or require personal assistance) in one or more of the\nseven ADLs at the l-year interview or admission to a skilled\nnursingfacilityprior to the l-year interview.\nValidationStudy\nSubjects.-Potential participantsin the validation study were\nmembersof theNewHavensiteof theEstablishedPopulations for\nEpidemiologic Studiesof theElderly(EPESE)program.

Otherwise, years of education,\nnumber of chronic conditions, body mass index, MMSE scores,\nand baseline vulnerability were comparable in the two cohorts.\nThe rates of functional dependence for the low, intermediate,\ntrend=82.3;p<.OOl),and for the four categories(none,mild, mod-\ntrend=141.9;p<.OOl). When the combined effectsof baselinevul-\nnerabilityand precipitatingeventswere evaluated(Figure 1B),the\n\"double-gradient\" phenomenon was again observed (with only\none exception), replicating the results from the development co-\nhort. The independent contributions of baseline vulnerability and\nprecipitatingevents were confirmed in both multivariablemodels\n(Table4, bottom panel).There was a marginalinteractionbetween\nbaselinevulnerabilityand precipitatingeventsin Modell (p =.08),\nbut no interactioninModel 2 (p =.74).\nThe rates of functional dependence for the low, intermediate,\nfunctional dependence between the low and high vulnerability\ngroups. For the four categories (none, mild, moderate, severe)\nof precipitating events, the rates of functional dependence were\n5.9-fold increased risk for functional dependence between the\nnone and severe groups.\nThe combined effects of baseline vulnerability and precipitat-\ning events on the development of functional dependence are\nshown in Figure 1A.With only two exceptions, the rate offunc-\ntional dependence increased progressively from low-risk to\nhigh-risk groups in all directions (i.e., across rows, across\ncolumns, or diagonally). This \"double-gradient\" phenomenon\nsuggests that both baseline vulnerability and precipitatn,Ig events\ncontribute independently to the development of functional de-\npendence. As hypothesized, participants with low vulner~bility\nwere unlikely to develop functional dependence except III the\nsetting of a severe precipitating event (33.3% [severe] vs 5.9%\n[none, mild and moderate groups combined]; p<.OOl).\nMoreover, among participants with high vulnerability, those\nwithout a precipitating event were considerably less likely to de-\nvelop functional dependence than were those with a precipit~t\ning event (28.3% [absent] vs 73.5% [present]; p<.OOl). Despite\nthis diminished risk, however, participants with high vulnerabil-\nity but no precipitating event had a similar likelihood of devel-\noping functional dependence as participants with low vulnera-\nbility who had a severe precipitating event (28.3% vs 33.3%).\nShown in Table 4 (top panel) are the relative risks and 95%\nconfidence intervals relating the categories of baseline vulnera-\nbility and precipitating events to functional dependence. The\nrisk of functional dependence increased across categories of\nboth baseline vulnerability and precipitating events, independent\nof the effect of the other (Modell), confirming the results of the\nunadjusted analyses. Comparable results were found for Model\n2, which adjusted for baseline vulnerability or precipitating\nevents, where appropriate, as well as for age, gender, race, edu-\ncation, marital status, housing type, number of chronic condi-\ntions, and body mass index. There was a marginal inter~ction\nbetween baseline vulnerability and precipitating events III the\ntwo multivariablemodels (Modell, p =.07; Model 2, p =.16).\nValidation Study\nadmitted to a skilled nursing facility and 73 were found to have\nADL disability at the follow-up interview, giving an outcome\nrate of 9.3%. There were 280 acute care hospital admissions\nduring the follow-up period. Two hundred twelve (75.7%) ad-\nmissions were ascertained by both local surveillance and HCFA\ndata tapes, 19 (6.8%) admissions were ascertained by local\nsurveillance alone, 37 (13.2%) admissions were ascertained by\nHCFA data tapes alone, and 15 (5.4%) admissions were ascer-\ntained through the West Haven VA's DHCP database. Of the\n205 participants hospitalized during the follow-up period, 154\nwere hospitalized once, 36 were hospitalized twice, and 15\nwere hospitalized three or more times. Compared with partici-\npants in the development cohort (Table 3), participants in the\nvelopment of functional dependence.We also found that older\npersons with low vulnerability are unlikely to develop func-\ntionaldependenceexcept in the settingof a severeprecipitating\nevent, whereas older persons who are highly vulnerable may\ndevelop functional dependence with any precipitating event,\neven of mild severity. These findings indicate that clinicians\nand investigators need to considerthe combinedeffectsof base-\nline vulnerabilityand precipitatingevents when characterizing\nthe mechanisms or pathways by which older persons develop\nfunctional dependence. Our model of precipitating events su-\nperimposed upon predisposing impairments has now been\nshownto operatein delirium(12),injuriousfalls (13), and func-\ntional dependence and may offer investigatorsa valuable vehi-\ncle to study other geriatric syndromes, such as urinary inconti-\nnence,pressuresores,and adversedrivingevents.\nOur results provide empirical evidence to support other\nrelatedmodelsof disabilityand frailty(23-25). In his textbook,\nBrocklehurst (23) postulated that many frail, older persons\nmanage to remainin the communityby balancingassets, which\nmaintain independence, with deficits,which threaten indepen-\ndence;and that \"breakdown\"occurseitherby the additionof an\nacuteor subacutemedical problemto the deficitside of the bal-\nance or by the loss of social support from the asset side of the\nbalance.Rockwood and associates(24) extended this model to\ndescribe a more dynamic process in which perturbations in as-\nsets and deficits lead to changes in functional status. Finally,\nCampbell and Buchner (25) proposed that disability may arise\nfrom a single catastrophic event, such as a stroke or traumatic\namputation, in an otherwise robust individual, or from small\nprecipitants,such as a change in drug therapy,cold weather,or\nan attackof bronchitis,in a frailolderperson.\nOur model of baseline vulnerability included physical per-\nformance, cognitive status, and age. Impairments in physical\nperformance and cognitive status are two of the main determi-\nnants of preclinical disability (7-9), a postulated state of com-\npromisedfunctionthat may not be evidentclinically(11).Other\ninvestigatorshave suggested that impairmentsin key domains,\nsuch as physical performance and cognitive status, act to de-\npletephysiologicreserve,therebyleavingolderpersons vulner-\nable to previously innocuous insults or challenges (10).\nAlthough age is an important risk factor for functional depen-\ndence (16), it likely serves, in part, as a proxy for an array of\ndeleteriousfactors that are unmeasured or difficultto measure.\nTo dichotomize the three elements of our vulnerability model,\nwe used commonly accepted (16,17) or empirically derived\n(7,8) cutpoints.Although the model stratifiedparticipants into\nthree distinct risk groups in both the development and valida-\ntion cohorts,some misclassification of risk may have occurred.\nScores below 24 on the MMSE, for example, may reflect low\neducational attainment rather than cognitive impairment (26).\nFurthermore, despite advanced age, some elderly persons re-\nmain remarkably robust (27). If present, misclassification of\nrisk would have weakened our results by placing less vulnera-\nble participants withthose who weremore vulnerable.\nTo classify precipitating events, we used information on a\ncombinationof hospital-relatedfactors,includingprincipaldis-\ncharge diagnosis, major procedures, and length of stay. With\nfew exceptions, the magnitudeof an eventcannot be adequately\ndetermined from a diagnosis alone. Moreover, because many\nolder personsare susceptibleto othercomplicationsnot directly\nrelatedto the illnessor injuryfor which they were hospitalized,\nfunctional decline often cannot be attributedto the acute prob-\nlem leading to hospitalization(28). Length of stay,a key com-\nponent of our criteria,has been shown in previousstudiesto be\nan important markerof illnessseverity(16). Of note, our classi-\nfication scheme was found to be reliable and created clinically\nmeaningfuland statistically significantrisk gradientsacross the\nfour categoriesof precipitating eventsfor both the development\nand validationcohorts.\nPrevious studies of functional dependence have focused\nlargely on baseline vulnerability (2-9). The role of specific\nevents on the development of functional dependence has been\nless well characterized.One cross-sectionalstudy reported that\narthritis, injury,stroke,heart disease,and pain injoints were the\nmost common diseases and symptoms attributedby older per-\nsons to difficultywithADL function (29).A prospectivecohort\nstudy found that a substantialproportion of older persons were\nhospitalizedwith one of a smallnumber of common diagnoses,\nincluding stroke, hip fracture, congestive heart failure, and\npneumonia,duringthe year theybecame severely disabled(30).\nBy evaluating the combined effects of baseline vulnerability\nand precipitatingevents,our studybuilds upon thisearlierwork\nand, in turn, advancesour understandingof how functional de-\npendencedevelopsamongcommunity-living olderpersons.\nStrengths of the current study include the use of three com-\nplementary sources to ensure the complete ascertainment of\nhospital admissions, and the availability of high-quality data\nfrom two large, population-basedcohorts of community-living\nolder persons, which allowed us to develop and validate our\nmodel in independent samples. Despite some notable differ-\nences in baseline characteristics between the two cohorts, our\nmodel of baseline vulnerability and precipitatingeventscreated\ndistinct and statisticallysignificantrisk gradientsin the valida-\ntion cohort, with a 26.7-fold increased risk for functional de-\npendencebetweenthe low-andhigh-riskgroups.\nSeveral limitations, however, warrant discussion. First, al-\nthoughwe had information on most majorhealthevents, we had\nno information on healtheventsthat did not lead to hospitaliza-\ntion (e.g., a prolonged upper respiratory tract infection) or on\n\"nonhealth\"events(e.g.,the deathof a familymember).Of par-\nticipants who developedfunctionaldependencein the develop-\nment and validation cohorts,52% and 45%, respectively, didnot\nhavean acute hospitaladmission,suggestingthatfunctionalde-\npendence in older persons is often insidious (11) or is precipi-\ntated by less potent health events or by nonhealth events.\nSecond, in the validation cohort, information on self-reported\nADLs was collectedduringa face-to-face assessment at baseline\nand a telephone interviewat 1year.A recent reporthas demon-\nstratedthat the prevalence ofADL disabilitymay differdepend-\ning on the mode of datacollection (31).Third,someparticipants\nmay have developed ADL disability and then recovered their\nADL function prior to the l-year interview. Previous studies\nhave reported that up to 30% of disabled, community-living\nolder persons recovertheirADL function within2 years (1,32).\nFourth,we had no informationon whetherparticipants received\ninterventions aimedat maintaining or restoringfunctional ability\nafter a precipitating event. Finally, we cannot determine from\nour data how often a single process, such as congestive heart\nfailureor rheumatoid arthritis,underlies both vulnerabilityand\nthe eventsthat precipitatefunctionaldependence.These limita-\ntions can best be addressed with a prospective cohort study de-\nsigned specifically to determine the mechanisms of disability\nand recovery among community-living older persons.\nDespite these limitations, our results suggest potential strate-\ngies that may be aimed at forestalling the onset of functional\ndependence among older persons. One strategy, for example,\nmight be to decrease vulnerability among the most vulnerable\nelders, perhaps by improving physical capabilities through an\nexercise-based intervention (33). A second, complementary\nstrategy might be to prevent (34) or aggressively treat (35) the\nprecipitating events themselves. Yet, a third strategy might\nfocus on preventing functional decline among hospitalized el-\nders, perhaps through the use of specially designed acute care\nunits (36). Furtherresearch is needed to identify the specific\nevents that precipitate functional dependence among older per-\nsons and to determine whether these events differ among per-\nsons with different levels of baseline vulnerability.\nThe work for this report was funded in part by grant ROI AG-07449 and the\nfrom the National Institute on Aging and by an award from the Gaylord\nRehabilitation Research Institute.
