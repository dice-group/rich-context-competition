School attachment or school connectedness\n(captured, for example, in the form of participation in school sports,\nless intensive work in paid employment during school years, or college\naspirations) have been found to be positively related to adolescent\nhealth behaviors (1,2). For instance, participation in school clubs has\nbeen shown to be associated with regular exercise and a healthy diet\n(3,4), and with lower rates of cigarette, alcohol, and illicit drug use\n(5). Conversely, students who work intensively in paid employment\nduring their high school years (i.e. working more than 20 h per week)\nare less likely to eat breakfast and tend to get less sleep (6,7).\nThere is also evidence that school connectedness in adolescence has\npositive consequences for subsequent health and academic success\nin early adulthood. Students working intensively in paid employment\nduring high school obtain fewer years of education and are less\nlikely to obtain a college degree (8-11). Using prospective data from\nMcDade et al. (12) found that high school and middle school\nstudents who reported a high probability of attending college subse-\nquently exercised more frequently in young adulthood (age 18-26).\nThis finding persisted when controlling for parental education, base-\nline physical and mental health, family structure, and the student's\nschool and neighborhood environment.\nThese findings suggest that young people invest their time in differ-\nent behaviors depending on their goals or expectations for the\nfuture. Within a set of resources and opportunities, an orientation to-\nward the future rather than the present may contribute to healthy\nbehaviors if individuals favor delayed benefits over immediate\n1 Survey Research Center, Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, Michigan, USA.

Perceived life chances may play an important role in\nyouth decisions regarding risk and health behaviors, with the result\nthat more forward-thinking adolescents who fully expect to pursue a\ncollege education may invest more heavily in a healthy lifestyle to\nmeet future goals (13). Holding high the belief in extended educa-\ntion beyond high school captures an adolescent's ``planful compe-\ntence'' (14), including a sense of direction over one's life. As a\nresult, future expectations with respect to educational attainment\nmay have ensuing consequences for health outcomes such as obesity\nand overweight through the practice of healthy behaviors over time.\nIn the United States and much of the developed world the prevalence of\nobesity has been increasing, with the most rapid increases occurring dur-\nand obesity early in the life course is based on a multifactorial approach\nincorporating strategies that address the physical and social contexts in\nwhich adolescents are embedded (15,16). The school context may be\none avenue where successful school attachment could have positive con-\nsequences for subsequent weight gain in early adulthood. However,\nthere is also an issue surrounding reverse causality in this relationship\nbecause the stigma of obesity may result in lower school attachment.\nIndeed, Shore and colleagues (17) found that overweight middle school\nstudents had lower grades, more detentions, lower school attendance,\nand more tardiness than their nonoverweight peers. Similarly, in a\nnational sample Crosnoe and Muller (18) found that overweight adoles-\ncents had lower academic achievement, especially in schools in which\noverweight was stigmatized. However, there is also evidence that\nseverely obese adolescents are not more depressed than their peers (19),\nsuggesting that obesity may not be as consequential for psychosocial\noutlook or future aspirations. Nonetheless, from a policy perspective,\npromoting school attachment in high risk groups may prove to be a\nworthwhile initiative regardless of whether obesity surfaced prior to, or\nin response to, a weak school connection (2,16,20).\nThe purpose of this research was to examine the role of college\nexpectations among high school seniors for subsequent trajectories\nof weight gain over early adulthood (to age 30). We draw on data\nfrom a nationally representative multicohort sample of American\nyouth collected prospectively from age 18, which has been ongoing\non an annual basis since 1976. As a result, we have the opportunity\nto examine the role of college aspirations on growth rates of early\nadult weight gain, accounting for birth cohort. We also control for\npotentially endogenous factors including academic performance\nthroughout high school and parents' education, both of which could\ninfluence college expectations, weight gain, or both. We hypothesize\nthat controlling for these competing factors, students with higher\nexpectations to graduate from a 4-year college program will exhibit\nslower rates of weight gain over early adulthood than those with\nlower college expectations.\nMethods and Procedures\nStudy population\nData come from the monitoring the future (MTF) project, a nation-\nwide school-based survey of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use, con-\nducted annually in the United States since 1975 (21). The survey also\nmonitors lifestyles and behaviors, including self-reported measures of\nrespondents' weight and height collected since 1986. MTF is an\nongoing cohort sequential study (described in more detail elsewhere\n(22)) involving a nationally representative sample of high school\nseniors surveyed in the spring of each year ($15,000 per year). Each\nyear's data collection takes place in $120-146 public and private high\nschools selected to provide an accurate representative cross-section of\n12th graders throughout the coterminous United States.\nA representative subsample ($2,400 students/year) is randomly\nselected from each cohort for six biennial follow-ups using self-com-\npleted mailed questionnaires to the age of 30 (a half-sample is fol-\nlowed on alternate years); thus, the first follow-up occurs at age 19 or\n20, the second at age 21 or 22, and so on. Drug users (regular users of\nmarijuana or any use of illicit drugs in the previous 30 days) were\noversampled for participation in the panel component by a ratio of 3\nto 1 and then reweighted in the analyses as discussed below. To ease\nrespondent burden, panel respondents are randomly assigned to receive\none of five different questionnaires, each with their own set of ques-\nper year) received a questionnaire asking about height and weight.\nFor our purposes we focus on subjects in 30 high school cohorts\ntheir trajectories of weight gain from age 19 to 30. Because height\nand weight data were collected beginning in 1986, not all high school\ncohorts contributed data at all ages, but we make use of a statistical\nmethod that takes account of unbalanced designs to use data on all\nwho were between the ages of 19 and 30 over this 23-year period.\nOn average, each subject contributed 3.5 observations (61.6) over the\nsix follow up periods, generating about 6,000 observations at each\nfollow-up. Roughly one-third of the observations span the entire age\nrange of interest (age 19-30). All study procedures are reviewed and\napproved on an annual basis by the University of Michigan's Institu-\ntional Review Board (IRB) for compliance with federal guidelines for\nthe treatment of human subjects.\nMeasures\nUsing repeated self-reported measures of height and weight, weight\ngain over early adulthood was captured with the body mass index\n(BMI \u00bc kg m\u00c02). A BMI of 25-29 is used to define ``overweight,''\nwhile a BMI score of 30 or above represents ``obese.'' (BMI scores\nwere not included for women who were pregnant at the time of fol-\nlow-up.) Three variables capture key indicators of early social position\nfound to be related to life time obesity as well as to school attach-\nment: (i) gender; (ii) race/ethnicity (self-reported by respondents and\nmodeled using three dummy variables contrasting Non-Hispanic Black,\nHispanic, and other race/ethnic (including Asian) respondents with\nNon-Hispanic White respondents); and (iii) childhood socioeconomic\nstatus (SES) (the maximum of the respondent's parents' education,\ndichotomized as high school degree or less vs. 4-year college degree\nor higher). We also adjust for cohort differences using three 10-year\nRespondents in their senior year of high school were asked about\ntheir college expectations with the question, ``How likely is it that\nyou will graduate from college (4-year program)?'' Response\noptions were: definitely won't, probably won't, probably will, defi-\nnitely will. Following McDade et al. (12) we classify these response\ncategories according to a probabilistic coding scheme where 0 repre-\nsents no chance, 0.25 indicates some chance (but probably not),\n0.75 indicates a good chance (probably will), and 1.0 captures the\nexpected certainty (definitely will) of college graduation.

Growth mixture modeling is an extension of conven-\ntional growth modeling that relaxes the assumption of a single pop-\nulation trajectory. By using latent trajectory classes (categorical\nlatent variables), the growth mixture model allows different classes\nof individuals to vary around different mean growth curves (24).\nThe trajectory of interest in this article is weight gain\n(captured with BMI), measured prospectively over young adult-\nThe measurement part of the model captures the growth factors\n(intercept and slope) as measured by multiple indicators of BMI\nover time (Figure 1). A linear growth model is specified with equi-\ndistant time points, but we also test the fit of a nonlinear form by\nusing quadratic terms. The structural part of the model incorporates\nthe growth model within a larger latent variable model by relating\nthe growth factors to other observed and latent variables. Of particu-\nlar interest is the latent trajectory class variable, which represents\nthe unobserved subpopulation of membership for respondents. This\nallows a separate growth model for each of the latent classes. Col-\nlege expectations (controlling for school performance, socioeco-\nnomic, and socio-demographic covariates) predict class membership\nin a multinomial logistic regression.\nModel building proceeded in a sequential process by first specifying\nthe measurement model and then incrementally increasing the num-\nber of latent classes. While substantively-based theory is used as the\nprimary means to determine the best fitting model, good fitting mod-\nels are characterized by (i) a low value for the Bayesian Information\nCriterion (BIC) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC); (ii) a statis-\ntically significant (low P value) Lo-Mendell-Rubin (LMR) likelihood\nratio test; and (iii) distinct posterior probabilities for individual class\nmembership (24). All models are estimated in Mplus Version 6.12\n(25) using full information maximum likelihood (FIML) with robust\nstandard errors. Multiple random starts are used to minimize local\noptimal in the likelihood. Respondent-level weights are used to adjust\nfor unequal selection probabilities in the panel study.\nRetention rates in the panel respondents are highest in the first follow-\nup after high school (averaging 70%), and fall to an average of 64% in\nthe biennial follow-ups through to age 30 (25). Using logistic regres-\nsion analysis (with backward elimination) we modeled the probability\nof study retention to age 30 according to a broad array of baseline\ncharacteristics and found that being Non-Hispanic White, and reporting\na higher average grade in high school increased the odds of retention.\nBy including these variables in our models, maximum likelihood\nFIGURE 1 Generalized growth mixture model for BMI over early adulthood: Monitor-\nscores at each of the six waves of data collection (age 19 through age 30).

The second and third columns of Table 2 report the results\nfor the two-class solution. The change in the BIC and AIC values,\ncoupled with a significant Lo-Mendel-Rubin Likelihood ratio test (P\n< 0.001, not shown), suggest that a two class solution is preferable\nto a single class model. Membership in each class showed good\nclassification quality with individuals most likely to belong to their\npredicted class (posterior probability is markedly higher (>0.90)\nthan for the other class). Adding a third class (model not shown) did\nnot result in any improvement in model fit and the posterior proba-\nbilities did not differentiate class membership well.\nFigure 2 shows the estimated growth curves for BMI from age 19 to\n30 according to the 2 class solution.

Table 4 presents the unstandardized\nregression coefficients (with standard errors) for the effects of the\ncovariates on BMI intercept and slope for each of the two latent\nclasses. Within the persistently overweight class, the rate of growth\nin BMI is more rapid for women and for those in more recent high\nschool cohorts. Those who were high school seniors after 1995 also\nhad significantly higher BMI at age 19/20 (intercept) than those\nwho graduated from high school in earlier years. Within the norma-\ntive class, women and other race/ethnic groups had significantly\nlower BMI at baseline, but non-Hispanic Blacks, and those with low\nchildhood SES experienced more rapid growth in BMI in this class;\nwomen experienced less rapid growth. Cohort differences were also\nobserved in the normative class, with more recent cohorts having\nsignificantly higher BMI at baseline (age 19/20) and significantly\nmore rapid increase in BMI over early adulthood.

On average, these high school seniors reported a\n68% chance that they would graduate from a 4-year college pro-\ngram, slightly lower than the probability reported elsewhere by\nyounger adolescents (grades 7 through 11) (12), which asked only\nabout the expectation of attending college (not graduating from a 4-\nyear degree program). Yet, having these expectations was associated\nwith less rapid weight gain over early adulthood.

As argued by\nMcDade et al. (12), the extent to which individuals favor immediate\nutility over delayed utility may influence health behaviors that lead\nto weight gain at this life stage. Fostering school attachment, partic-\nularly through the promotion of norms and expectations for\nacademic pursuits in the school setting, may therefore have positive\nconsequences for adolescent weight gain over time (2). The transi-\ntion to adulthood (sometimes referred to as emerging or early adult-\nhood (27)) is particularly important because individuals are on their\nown typically for the first time, when life plans are put into action,\nand when trajectories of risk become more manifest (28). As a\nresult, this may be a particularly salient period of adolescent devel-\nopment for obesity prevention and intervention strategies. To the\nextent that adolescents are bonded or attached to schools at this life\nstage, their adoption of forward-thinking expectations is encouraged\nbecause they are motivated to conform to the norms, expectations,\nand values of that socialization unit (29). For example, adolescents\nwho are poorly bonded to school are more likely to use cigarettes\nand alcohol than adolescents who are well bonded to school (30,31).\nOur results extend this line of thinking by suggesting a broader con-\nstruct termed ``educational connectedness,'' measured here in terms\nof college expectations, has positive consequences for moderate\ngrowth in BMI over early adulthood. Whereas school connectedness\nrelates to the experiences during adolescence in terms of connec-\ntions with the school context, educational connectedness relates to\nthe long-term belief in the power and importance of education in\nsetting the stage for competence across the life course (14). Holding\nhigh the belief in extended education beyond high school captures\nan adolescent's ``apparent readiness to take responsibility for self''\n(14:806), including beliefs in individual control over life direction\nand health behaviors.\nThe connection between college expectations and trajectories of\nBMI may also be a function of actually obtaining a college degree\nin early adulthood. However, this is complicated in that obese ado-\nlescents, especially obese girls, are less likely to attend college than\ntheir non-obese age-mates (32), yet college attendance is typically\nassociated with weight gain, at least initially (33). A lack of com-\nplete data on actual college graduation in these data prevented us\nfrom assessing the mediating role of college degree for college\nexpectations. However, replicating our analysis with a half sample\nof respondents with complete data on college graduation showed no\ndifference in the effects of college expectations on latent class\nmembership.\nOur results also identified strong and persistent cohort differences in\ntrajectories of weight gain over early adulthood, which parallel the\nobserved increase in the rates of obesity and overweight in the\nUnited States since the mid-1980s (15). More recent cohorts of high\nschool seniors were more likely to be in the persistently overweight\nclass than those who were high school seniors in the mid-1970s and\nearly 1980s. Even within each trajectory class, more recent high\nschool cohorts also had higher BMI at age 19/20 and faster rates of\ngrowth in BMI through to age 30. Consistent with the existing\nresearch (34), we also noted significant gender, socioeconomic, and\nrace/ethnic disparities in the propensity to be in the persistently\noverweight trajectory, as well as in the rates of growth in BMI over\nearly adulthood.\nStrengths and Limitations\nThere are noteworthy strengths of this study. The use of nationally\nrepresentative, multicohort, multiwave prospective longitudinal data\nspanning the transition to adulthood provides a strong methodologi-\ncal foundation for the findings, allowing a level of confidence\nbeyond what is typical in the literature. In addition, we use leading\nedge statistical strategies to control for potential confounds and\nidentify and predict distinct time-varying latent classes of BMI.\nThere are also noteworthy limitations. Our study is limited by self-\nreported measures of height and weight, which tend to be underesti-\nmated (35). However, self-reported values of height tend to be\nhighly correlated with their measured values (36,37), making them\nuseful for assessing population trends over time. Measures of\nweight-related health behaviors were also unavailable in these data,\npreventing us from testing the mediating role of health behaviors in\nthe pathway between college expectations and weight gain through\nto age 30. In addition, it is unclear whether the relationship between\ncollege expectations and weight gain reflects preexisting differences\namong students in terms of socioeconomic background, orientations\ntowards further education and weight-related health behaviors. For\nexample, overweight youths from a lower socioeconomic back-\nground with poor access to healthy foods and limited opportunities\nfor exercise may also have low expectations for college attendance.\nWhile we attempted to control for these common causes in our anal-\nyses, we cannot rule out the role of unobserved variables.\nOur main independent variable of interest, college expectations, cap-\ntures many factors which could be operating in weight gain in early\nadulthood. Much of the existing research looking at health behaviors\nhas examined school connectedness in terms of participation in\nschool clubs and sports, and one recent study (12) examined the link\nbetween college expectations and physical activity. We further this\narea of research by considering the implications of college expecta-\ntions as a marker for the way young adults assess their future trajec-\ntory and their health and lifestyle choices along the way. However,\nit is noteworthy that in a separate regression model (results not\nshown), college expectations were significantly associated (P <\n0.01) with other measures of school attachment available in our\ndata, including liking school, the perception that school has mean-\ning, satisfaction with overall educational experience, and number of\ndays skipped school (negatively associated) (controlling for gender\nand race/ethnicity). However, these measures were not significantly\nassociated with BMI trajectories in our models.\nWhat happens at school is critically important for adolescent health\nand development (38) and schools have been identified as a key set-\nting for public health strategies to lower or prevent the prevalence\nof overweight and obesity (39,40). Beyond strategies designed to\npromote physical activity or limit the availability of snacks and soft\ndrinks, research conducted on school-based interventions suggests\nthat school connectedness serves to protect against a variety of risk\nbehaviors, including substance abuse, delinquency and sedentary\nbehavior (2,3,30). We extend this line of research by examining the\nlink between college expectations and early adult weight gain.\nResults suggest that attention to subjective life chances may provide\nopportunities for intervention in school settings, particularly in the\nObesity College Expectations and Early Adult BMI Clarke et al.\nform of discussions about college attendance and fostering a com-\nmitment to academic goals, with potential benefits for healthy\nweight gain over early adulthood.O\n"
