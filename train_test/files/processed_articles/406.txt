We investigated how currently endorsed performance measures for\nglycemic control in diabetes may be influenced by case mix composition. We assessed differ-\nences in A1C performance measure threshold attainment by case mix factors for A1C 9% and\nexamined how lowering the threshold to A1C 8% or 7% changed these differences.\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey for 843 adults self-reporting diabetes, we computed\nthe mean difference in A1C threshold attainment of 9, 8, and 7% by various case mix\nfactors. The mean difference is the average percentage point difference in threshold attainment\nfor population groups compared with that for the overall population.\nRESULTS -- Diabetes medication was the only factor for which the difference in threshold\nattainment increased at lower thresholds, with mean differences of 5.7 percentage points at A1C\nCONCLUSIONS -- As 87% of U.S. adults have A1C 9%, a performance measure thresh-\nold of 9% will not drive major improvements in glycemic control. Lower thresholds do not\nexacerbate differences in threshold attainment for most factors. Reporting by diabetes medica-\ntion use may compensate for heterogeneous case mix when a performance measure threshold of\nA1C 8% or lower is used.\nThe implementation of performance\nmeasures to provide public account-\nability and financial incentive for\nquality health care represents a major\nshift in the approach to improving popu-\nlation health within the U.S (1). The\nmovement to measure quality diabetes\ncare involves establishing standards re-\nlated to glycemic control, eye and foot ex-\naminations, urine protein screening, and\nmanagement of lipids and blood pressure\n(2). The performance measure threshold\nfor glycemic control has been controver-\nsial. More stringent measures may en-\ncourage overzealous treatment of\nindividuals to which more general guide-\nlines do not apply. Conversely, providers\nmay mistake less stringent performance\nmeasures for guidelines that have been\ncarefully developed by a number of med-\nical organizations to assist physicians in\nsetting therapeutic targets for their pa-\ntients (3).\nThe most commonly cited guidelines\nare those of the American Diabetes Asso-\nciation (ADA), which state that although\ncertain patient groups (e.g., elderly pa-\ntients or those with comorbidity) may not\nbenefit from stringent glycemic targets,\nmaintaining A1C 7% is a reasonable\ngoal for individuals with diabetes (4). Af-\nter decades in which less than half of\nAmericans reached the target of A1C\n7% (5), national data have shown im-\nproved glycemic control in those with di-\nprovements, some stakeholders ques-\ntioned whether linking pay for\nperformance programs to a 9% thresh-\nold would encourage adequate glycemic\ncontrol for individual patients or propel\ndeclines in A1C at the national level (8).\nWith only 13% of Americans with diag-\nnosed diabetes having a A1C of 9% in\n9% may have limited ability to drive\npopulation-wide quality improvement.\nIn contrast to clinical practice guide-\nlines for glycemic control, such as the\nADA guideline, which address goals for\nindividual patients, performance mea-\nsures are designed to indicate overall\nhealth care quality delivered across a pop-\nulation of patients (9). An A1C perfor-\nmance measure for holding providers\naccountable may foster improvement in\npopulation-level glycemic control, al-\nthough experts debate how to define an\noptimal measure of health care quality\n(10,11). This debate has led to different\nthresholds established by different orga-\nnizations and used for different purposes.\nThe National Diabetes Quality Improve-\nment Alliance (NDQIA), a consortium of\nstakeholders interested in diabetes care,\nhas established two categories of perfor-\nmance measures. The first category of\nmeasures is intended for quality improve-\nment efforts within an organization and\ndescribes A1C values across the range of\nsures is that to which providers and\nhealth plans will be accountable for pub-\nlic reporting and on which performance-\nbased reimbursements will be based. The\nglycemic control performance measure\nthat the NDQIA recommends for public\nreporting is A1C 9% to indicate poor\ncontrol (12). The NDQIA has a good con-\ntrol measure of A1C 7% under \"active\nconsideration\" but stated that \"before\nsuch a measure can be put forward, ap-\npropriate means for considering case mix\nmust be specified.\" The National Quality\nForum (NQF), whose mission is to im-\nprove health care quality through na-\ntional performance standards, has\n                                                \nFrom 1Social & Scientific Systems, Silver Spring, Maryland; the 2National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive\nand Kidney Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland; and 3Westat, Rockville, Maryland.\nCorresponding author: Kathleen E.

In contrast, the National Com-\nmittee for Quality Assurance adopted a\nHealth Plan Employer Data and Informa-\ntion Set measure of A1C 7% for public\naccountability (13). This measure has un-\ndergone scrutiny (10,11) because not all\npatients should achieve this goal. Clinical\nguidelines state that individual goals are\nto be tailored according to age, life expect-\nancy, comorbidity, risk of hypoglycemia,\nand patient preferences (4).\nPart of the challenge of implementing\nan A1C performance measure is prevent-\ning unintended consequences, such as\npenalizing physicians who treat low-\nincome patients or patients with medi-\ncally complicated diabetes in whom A1C\nmay be more difficult to control. In its\nrationale for the 9% threshold, the\nNDQIA stated that [performance] mea-\nsures \"must account for differences in in-\ndividual patient conditions and\npreferences.\" This wording suggests that\nthe NDQIA is adopting a lenient thresh-\nold to diminish differences in threshold\nattainment that are due to heterogeneity\nin case mix.\nDifferences in glycemic control across\nage, BMI, duration of diabetes, and diabe-\ntes medication use (6,14) indicate that\nthese case mix factors are likely to influ-\nence performance measure attainment.\nDifferences in glycemic control by race/\nethnicity have also been reported (15) but\nmay be a function of access to care (16).\nEducation and income level may influ-\nence measures of diabetes care indepen-\ndent of access to care (16). Determining\nthe effect of threshold choice on the mag-\nnitude of case mix factor differences is im-\nportant for the careful selection of a\nperformance measure. Using representa-\ntive data from individuals with diabetes in\nthe U.S. and considering A1C thresholds\nof 9, 8, and 7%, we computed esti-\nmates of differences in threshold attain-\nment for various patient factors and\ndetermined how the magnitude of differ-\nences is affected by choice of threshold.\nMETHODS -- Data for this cross-\nExamination Survey (NHANES). This on-\ngoing survey conducted by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics uses a strati-\nfied, multistage, probability cluster de-\nsign that results in a nationally\nrepresentative sample of the noninstitu-\ntionalized, civilian U.S. population. The\nsampling design oversamples non-\nHispanic blacks, Mexican Americans, in-\ndividuals aged 60 years, and low-\nincome individuals to provide more\nprecise estimates for these specific\ngroups. We included 843 adults aged\n20 years with valid measures of A1C\nwho were not pregnant and who reported\nduring an interview that a health care\nprofessional had told them they have di-\nwent institutional review board approval,\nand written informed consent was ob-\ntained from participants.\nMeasures\nSociodemographic characteristics and in-\nformation on diabetes, health, and insur-\nance status were ascertained during\ninterviews. Age-groups were based on ap-\nproximate quintiles of the analytic sam-\nple. Race/ethnicity was based on self-\nidentified race and Hispanic origin.\nIncome-to-poverty ratio was defined as\nthe ratio of reported total family income\nto the U.S. Census Bureau poverty\nthreshold. Diabetes medication was cat-\negorized as use of insulin (with or with-\nout oral agents), use of oral agents only,\nand no use.\nWeight and height were measured\nduring a physical examination. BMI was\ncalculated as weight in kilograms divided\nby the square of height in meters, and\nweight status was categorized as under-\nweight or normal weight, overweight,\nobese, and severely obese with BMI cut\nboronate affinity high-performance liquid\nchromatography using Primus CLC330\nand Primus CLC 385 (Primus, Kansas\nCity, MO), and values were standardized\naccording to the method of the Diabetes\nControl and Complications Trial (18,19),\nyielding interassay coefficients of varia-\nData analysis\nThe mean difference provides a measure\nof disparity among different groups\nwithin a population (20). We used the\nmean difference to assess differences in\nA1C threshold attainment by various\npopulation groups within potential case\nmix factors. For each factor, we calculated\na mean difference to provide a summary\nof the difference in proportion of people\nwith diabetes whose A1C was 7, 8,\nand 9%. The mean difference is ex-\npressed in percentage points, across any\nnumber, p, of population groups. The ref-\nerent for each threshold, rref\n, was selected\nas the proportion exceeding the threshold\namong the overall population. These ref-\nerent proportions are constant at a given\nthreshold and provide an intuitive stan-\ndard from which to gauge differences\nacross groups. For each population\ngroup, j, we calculated the proportion, rj\n,\nexceeding the threshold, and the absolute\ndifference in that proportion from that of\nthe referent, rref\n. For each factor, the mean\ndifference was calculated using Equation 1.\nMean difference \n\np\nrj\n rref\n\np\nAll calculations were made with Wes-\nvar (version 5; Westat, Rockville, MD) us-\ning the 4-year examination sample\nweights to account for the sample design\nand nonresponse. Sampling variance was\ncalculated using the jackknife procedure,\nappropriate for the complex, multistage\nlimits were calculated by taking the natu-\nral logarithm of the mean difference, esti-\nmating the standard error of the\ntransformed estimate, deriving confi-\ndence limits, and back-transforming the\nconfidence limits via exponentiation.\nThis transformation results in asymmetric\nconfidence limits but improves their va-\nlidity (22). Student's t tests were used to\ntest whether the differences between the\nmean differences for the 7 and 8% thresh-\nolds relative to the 9% threshold were\nequal to 0.\nRESULTS -- The proportion of indi-\nviduals whose A1C concentrations were\n9, 8, and 7% are presented by var-\nious patient factors (Table 1).

We first present differences in\nthreshold attainment within factors and\nthen describe the effects of lowering the\nA1C threshold on these differences.\nSociodemographic factors\nFor sociodemographic factors, important\ndifferences existed across groups of age,\nBainbridge and Associates\nTable 1--Weighted frequency distribution of sociodemographic and health status factors, the proportion of each group exceeding three A1C\nthresholds, and the mean difference across groups\nFrequency\ndistribution\nProportion exceeding A1C threshold\nSociodemographic factors\nAge\nRace/ethnicity\nOther race, other Hispanic,\nIncome-to-poverty ratio\nInsurance status\nSex\nEducation\nHealth status factors\nDiabetes medication\nDiabetes duration\nWeight status\nContinued on facing page\nChoice of A1C performance measure threshold\nrace/ethnicity, and insurance status at\neach of the A1C thresholds, whereas dif-\nferences across sex and education were\nminor. The proportion with A1C 9%\ndeclined steadily with increasing age,\nyears but only 13.4% of those aged\naged 75 years surpassed the thresh-\nold. The age gradient was not explained\nby a shorter reported duration of diabetes\nor a lower proportion of insulin use\namong elderly individuals (data not\nshown). In comparing each of the five\nage-groups to the overall population, the\nmean difference in the proportion with\nference across race/ethnic groups was of a\nmagnitude similar to that for the age dif-\nference at this threshold. Among race/\nethnic groups, the proportion exceeding\nany threshold was much lower for non-\nHispanic whites than for any minority\nrace/ethnic group. Almost one-third of\nthose most economically disadvantaged\n(income-to-poverty ratio 0.8) had A1C\n9%, but the proportions of individuals\nin the other income-to-poverty ratio cat-\negories with A1C 9% were much lower\ncentage points. Uninsured individuals\nwere more likely to have A1C 9% than\nthose with any insurance. The lower pro-\nportion with A1C 9% among those with\npublic insurance (and among those with\nadditional private insurance) appears to\nbe explained by the Medicare eligibility of\nindividuals aged 65 years, who have a\nlower probability of poor control (data\nnot shown).\nLowering the threshold to A1C 8 or\n7% did not significantly affect most so-\nciodemographic disparities. The age gra-\ndient persisted, and mean differences\nacross age and insurance status were\nmodestly reduced as the threshold was\nlowered from 9 to 7%. Mean differ-\nences across race/ethnic groups at the\nlower thresholds remained substantial.\nLowering the threshold to A1C 8% did\nnot significantly reduce the disparity\nacross income-to-poverty groups, but\nlowering the threshold to A1C 7% re-\npoints, a significant decline from the esti-\nanalysis was framed in terms of the effect\non the mean difference across various\ngroups of lowering the threshold for poor\ncontrol, the results are similar if framed in\nterms of raising the A1C threshold for\ngood control.\nHealth status factors\nAmong health status factors, the largest\ndifference at the 9% threshold was\nfound across diabetes medication catego-\nries. Compared with 18.4% overall, more\nthan one-quarter of individuals taking in-\nsulin, 16% of those taking oral medica-\ntions, and 13% of those using no\nmedications had concentrations above\nthis level, yielding a mean difference of\npercentage points.

At A1C 9%, mean differences\nacross categories of number of prescrip-\ntion medications and number of health\ncare interactions and hospitalization in\ncentage points, respectively.\nLowering the threshold to A1C 8 or\n7% had a large and significant effect on\nthe mean difference across categories of di-\nabetes medication.

For ex-\nample, we observed pronounced race/\nethnicity differences in achievement of\nglycemic control at all three thresholds,\na finding consistent with previous re-\nsearch (23). We found no evidence,\nhowever, that establishing a lower A1C\ncutoff as a performance measure would\nexacerbate this disparity or that select-\ning a less stringent threshold would ob-\nviate the disparity.\nDiabetes medication is the major pa-\ntient factor for which differences in\nthreshold attainment would be exacer-\nbated by lowering the current NDQIA\nand NQF glycemic control performance\nmeasure of A1C 9%. The importance of\ndiabetes treatment for good (A1C 7%)\nglycemic control has been shown to be\nindependent of sociodemographic char-\nacteristics, abdominal obesity, and health\ncare access and utilization (15). The mag-\nnitude of this difference at the lower\nthresholds has implications for pay for\nperformance quality improvement mod-\nels being considered by the Centers for\nMedicare & Medicaid Services and other\npayers. Practices that include a greater\nproportion of patients receiving insulin\nmay have proportionately more patients\nexceeding A1C thresholds. A quality im-\nprovement system that includes an incen-\ntive to achieve a performance measure for\nglycemic control may not recognize ap-\npropriate care given by physicians whose\npractice includes a larger proportion of\npeople needing insulin for glycemic con-\ntrol, unless the system accounts for this\nfactor. Reporting performance measure\nattainment specific to diabetes medica-\ntion use, and insulin use in particular,\nmight be one means to account for this\ndifference in case mix, although imple-\nmenting this recommendation may not\ncurrently be practical under most sys-\ntems. As health systems move forward\nwith electronic medical records, however,\ncapturing information on medication use\nwill be more feasible. Although auto-\nmated review of electronic medical\nrecords may not consistently capture data\non prescription medications (24), perfor-\nmance measures stratified by prescription\nmedication may be a viable solution as\nlong as measures receive adequate field\nDifferences across other patient\nhealth factors examined (self-reported\nhealth, number of prescription medica-\ntions taken, and history of hospitaliza-\ntion) were not greatly influenced by the\nchoice of glycemic control performance\nmeasure threshold. Of the 13 factors\nstudied, only socioeconomic status (as\nmeasured by the income-to-poverty ratio)\nhad a reduced disparity in threshold at-\ntainment with a lower A1C threshold.\nWe observed a sizable difference in\nthreshold attainment by age, with im-\nproved glycemic control across increasing\nage-groups. The effect may be one of sur-\nvivorship bias whereby life-threatening\ncomplications are reduced among indi-\nviduals with well-controlled diabetes or\nmay reflect milder disease with more\n-cell function in elderly individuals. The\npoorer control in younger patients is om-\ninous as they will have a longer duration\nof diabetes and thus greater risk of com-\nplications. Our findings also suggest that\nthe current NDQIA and NQF perfor-\nmance measure of A1C 9% is unlikely\nto drive major improvements in glycemic\ncontrol in the Medicare population as\nOur analysis of these national data of-\nfers a response to a specific health policy\nquestion being debated among groups\ncommitted to establishing national health\ncare quality measures. Nonetheless, we\nacknowledge several limitations. Recent\nevidence suggests that differences in A1C\nby race may reflect physiological differ-\nences such as rates of glycation and eryth-\nrocyte survival (26). Fair implementation\nof threshold-based performance mea-\nsures will depend on determining\nwhether small differences in A1C thresh-\nold attainment truly indicate differences\nin quality diabetes care after adjustment\nfor case mix. Diagnosed diabetes status\nwas assessed with a validated question\nthat nonetheless has a sensitivity of\n81% and a positive predictive value of\n89% (27). Another limitation is that our\nanalysis relied heavily on self-reported\ncase mix factors. The NHANES surveys\nare designed to result in a representative\nsample of the noninstitutionalized U.S.\npopulation but may underrepresent non-\ninstitutionalized persons with mental\nhealth and substance abuse conditions, a\ngroup shown to have poor glycemic con-\nWe conclude that implementing an\nA1C performance measure to indicate\npoor control that is more stringent than\nthe current measure of A1C 9% would\nnot increase disparities across most pa-\ntient factors including age, race/ethnic\ngroup, and socioeconomic status. To ac-\ncount for a case mix that includes more\ninsulin users, however, stakeholders con-\nsidering the selection of a performance\nmeasure threshold for glycemic control\nthat is 8% should consider reporting of\nthreshold attainment specific to diabetes\nmedication use. Stratified reporting\nwould allow more rigorous goals for gly-\ncemic therapy in groups for whom a ben-\nefit has been established. In so doing,\nlowering the A1C performance measure\nthreshold may advance the overall quality\nof diabetes care, without magnifying\noverall differences among population\ngroups and without discouraging physi-\ncian acceptance of insulin-requiring pa-\ntients whose diabetes is more difficult to\nmanage.\n"
