Studies have shown that higher levels of Total Biliru-\nbin (TBili) convey a protective effect with regard to cardiovascular\nrisk. In this study, we will examine the relationship between TBili\nlevel and prevalence of DM to discern whether a similar relation-\nship exists.\nMethods: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nvey (NHANES) is a comprehensive survey performed regularly to\nevaluate the overall health and nutrition status of the United States\npopulation. For the purpose of this study, we combined NHANES\nticipants were selected after excluding all patients younger than\ntwenty years, those with a history of abnormal liver function tests,\nor those who disclosed a history of liver disease. The data collected\non these individuals was adjusted for demographic characteristics,\nas well as risk factors for DM, and was analyzed via multivariate\nlogistic regression, using SAS proc survey methodology.\nResults: After age adjustment, increased TBili was associated with\ntivariate analysis, adjusting for all diabetes risk factors assessed,\nConclusions: Our results show that a higher level of serum TBili\nis associated with odds of having a lower incidence of DM. This\nfinding supports the hypothesis that the antioxidant nature of TBili,\ndemonstrating a protective effect with regard to the risk of stroke,\natherosclerosis, and vasculitis in prior research, also extends to DM\nrisk. Furthermore, research has shown that higher levels of TBili in-\ncrease glucose mobilization into the cells, leading to more efficient,\nbiologic glucose utilization. There is no doubt that the beneficial\neffect of TBili is multifactorial; thus further investigation is war-\nranted.\n",

Prevalence data, collected in 2007, indicate that 7.8%\nof the population have been diagnosed with this disease [1].\nFrom a fiscal standpoint, the diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus\nis associated with a two-fold rise in medical cost, equaling\napproximately $116 billion dollars in direct expenditures\nand $58 million in indirect expenditures, in the United States\n(US) [1]. Given this disease's dramatic impact on the physi-\ncal and financial health of the US population, disease pre-\nvention has taken on paramount importance. With this focus\nin mind, research activity has focused on finding physiologic\nfactors that decrease a person's risk of developing Diabetes\nMellitus.\nBilirubin has been conjectured to be one such factor.\nThere is a growing body of literature which shows that high-\ner Total Bilirubin levels (TBili) are protective against car-\ndiovascular disease, Stroke and Peripheral Arterial Disease\n[2-7]. Studies suggest that an increased expression of Heme\nOxygenase, an enzyme used to break down the hemoglobin\ninto bilirubin, is associated with enhanced insulin sensitiv-\nity and glucose metabolism, thus resulting in greater rates\nof rat model euglycemia [8, 9]. Furthermore, the antioxidant\nproperties of TBili have been postulated to reverse oxidative\ndamage associated with a hyperglycemic state [10]. Con-\nsequently, we have undertaken this population-based study\nto assess whether higher levels of TBili, within the physi-\nologically normal range, convey a decreased risk of Diabetes\nMellitus in the US population.\naPinnacle Health/ Harrisburg Hospital, Harrisburg, PA, USA\nbPhiladelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA\ncCorresponding author: Pinnacle Health/ Harrisburg Hospital, 205 S\nEmail: pcheriyath@pinnaclehealth.org\nCheriyath et al\nArticles \u00a9 The authors | Journal compilation \u00a9 J Clin Med Res and Elmer PressTM | www.jocmr.org\nMaterials and Methods\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) is a nation-wide survey performed jointly by\nthe National Center for Health Statistics and the Center for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), on a representative\nsample of the United States (US) population. This sample\nis chosen using a stratified, multistage probability cluster\nsampling design of the non-institutionalized, non-military\nUS population [11]. Components of this survey include\nquestionnaires about demographics and health status, gen-\neral medical examinations, as well as laboratory tests of var-\nied bodily fluids. The physical examination component of\nNHANES consists of medical, dental, AND anthropometri-\ncal measurements collected by trained personnel [12].\nFor the purpose of our study, we examined NHANES\nour protocol removed all data for NHANES participants who\nwere younger than twenty years-of-age, who reported a his-\ntory of liver disease, who had abnormal liver function studies,\nor who had missing data values. Of 41,474 participants who\nhad data collected during our seven-year period-of-interest,\n15,876 did not meet any of the exclusion criteria. Based on\nprevious studies we stratified TBili into two groups. One had\nthe TBili level of less than 10 micromol/L and the other had a\nlevel of greater than or equal to 10 micromol/L [2, 23].\nLaboratory methods\nTo measure total Bilirubin, NHANES used the LX20 process\nwhich utilizes a timed endpoint Diazo method. The basis of\nthis method is formation of Azobilrubin from a reaction with\na Diazo reagent. The change in the absorbance level of the\nreagent is measured, as this value is directly proportional to\nthe concentration of Bilirubin. Fasting blood sugar was mea-\nsured using Roche/Hitachi 911 instrument (Roche Diagnos-\ntics, Indianapolis) on early morning serum sample, for which\nsubjects were asked to fast for nine hours. [11].\nCase definition\nCase definition of Diabetes Mellitus was based on fasting\nblood sugar value of not less than 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L)\nand the participant's response to the following questions: (1)\n`Other than during pregnancy, have you ever been told by a\ndoctor or other health professional that you have diabetes or\nsugar diabetes?'; (2) `Are you taking insulin now?'; (3) `Are\nyou taking any pills to decrease your blood sugar?'.\nDefinition of covariables\nThe NHANES questionnaire section was used for the char-\nacterization of age, sex, race, tobacco use pattern, alcohol\nuse, highest level of education achieved, and marital status.\nHypertension was defined as a mean systolic blood pressure\nof 140 mm Hg, a mean diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm\nHg, or reporting a physician diagnosis of high blood pres-\nsure. Total cholesterol was defined as reporting that a phy-\nsician had diagnosed that person with high cholesterol or\nreporting that a physician had advised that person to take\ncholesterol lowering medications. Prevalent cardiovascular\ndisease was defined as a self-reported history of coronary\nheart disease, previous heart attack, or history of stroke. BMI\nwas categorized into the three categories of normal, over-\nweight and obese based on CDC guidelines [13].\nStatistical analysis\nIn order to account for the complex, stratified, multi-\nstage probability cluster sampling design employed in the\nNHANES survey, we analyzed this data using SAS version\n9.1's (Cary, North Carolina) Proc Survey methodology. Vari-\nance was estimated using the jackknife replacement method.\nWe calculated the age-adjusted prevalence estimates, strati-\nfied by demographics and pre-determined risk factors. We\nused proc survey logistic regression to create a risk-factor\nbased model, and calculated odds ratios with 95% confi-\ndence Intervals. These models were specifically adjusted\nfor age, sex, race, smoking, alcohol, education and marital\nstatus.\nResults\nThe bilirubin levels in the sample population were normally\ndistributed, with a small right sided tail (Fig. 1). The mean\nTBili level was 11.89 micromol/L, with a standard deviation\nFigure 1. Distribution of Bilirubin (TBili) levels in the target popula-\ntion.\nTotal Bilirubin and Diabetes\nArticles \u00a9 The authors | Journal compilation \u00a9 J Clin Med Res and Elmer PressTM | www.jocmr.org\nThe demographic variables of the two groups were com-\npared by age adjusted prevalence (Table 1).Agreater propor-\ntion of men were found to have a serum TBili level above\n10 micromol/L. For individuals who had Diabetes Mellitus,\nthermore, a statistically-significant, unadjusted association\nbetween higher TBili level and Diabetes did exist (OR: 0.74,\nafter adjusting for age, sex, race, married status, education,\nDiscussion\nOur study supports the notion that people with high TBili\nhave lesser odds of prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus (DMI\nand DMII). This is in keeping with previously reported stud-\nies which have shown higher TBili levels to be protective\nagainst Coronary Artery Disease, Stroke and Peripheral Vas-\ncular Disease [2-7].\nBilirubin has been regarded as a powerful endogenous\nanti-oxidant and anti- inflammatory agent [14-18]. Thus, it\nstands to reason that higher TBili levels may be protective\nagainst the autoimmune, inflammation-related pathology of\ntype 1 diabetes and oxidative physiologic stress associated\nwith development of type 2 diabetes [19]. Current research\nalso suggests that physiological levels of TBili block the pro-\nduction of various free radicals that might hinder the inhibi-\ntory responses of the cell to take up the high glucose [20].\nFurthermore, it is shown to prevent the vascular endothelial\nactivation from the oxidative stress in the vessels [21, 22].\nIn addition, rat model studies of DM II have shown that\nSerum TBili\n< 10 micromole/liter\nSerum TBili\nTable 1. Demographic Characteristics (Age Adjusted Prevalence)\nCheriyath et al\nArticles \u00a9 The authors | Journal compilation \u00a9 J Clin Med Res and Elmer PressTM | www.jocmr.org\nincreased expression of Heme Oxygenase-1, the enzyme\nresponsible for conversion of Hemoglobin to Bilirubin, is\nassociated with enhanced insulin sensitivity and glucose me-\ntabolism resulting in greater rates of rat model euglycemia.\nMoreover, Hemin, an activator of the Heme Oxygenase sys-\ntem, has been found to increase the expression of GLUT-4\nreceptors and Adiponectin, a hormone which increases insu-\nlin sensitivity [20]. Similar to TBili, and in light of its anti-\ninflammatory properties, higher Adiponectin levels have\nbeen associated with lower DM prevalence. However, unlike\nAdiponectin since TBili is a commonly measured laboratory\nvalue, measuring TBili levels would offer a cost-effective\nmethod of DM risk stratification..\nThis study follows a complex sampling with the provi-\nsion of the weights, which makes it more realistic to project\non to the United States population. The amalgamation of\nfour large cross sectional surveys done on the representative\nthis study high volume population based study. So we got a\nfair amount of population who have diabetes and who didn't.\nThe stratification of total bilirubin into 2 groups, one having\na TBili level of less than 10 micromol/L and the other having\nthe TBili level of greater than or equal to 10 millimol/L is\nbased on previous study which showed that a level of TBili\nequal to or above 10 millimol/L is cardio protective [23].\nAnother interesting observation is that there is a greater\nFigure 3. Comparing the adjusted odds ratio of having Diabetes in TBili < 10 and Tbili\nFigure 2. Prevalence of TBili values in patients with Diabetes and No Diabetes.\nTotal Bilirubin and Diabetes\nArticles \u00a9 The authors | Journal compilation \u00a9 J Clin Med Res and Elmer PressTM | www.jocmr.org\ndistribution of population in the higher TBili group which\nhad the bilirubin greater or equal to 10 micromol/L, which\nwas nearly consistent in all demographic groups. Needless\nto say also there is most of the population distribution in the\nlatter group ( 10 micromol/L) with respect to prevalence of\nOur use of population-adjusted data from a national sur-\nvey, using predetermined definition is not without its limita-\ntions. One major limitation to this study is that the definition\nof Diabetes Mellitus is predicated on subject recollection\nand self reported diagnosis, thus introducing a component of\nrecall bias. In order to compensate for this, we have added\nfasting blood sugar measurements into our study's definition\nof Diabetes Mellitus.\nFor similar reasons, our study is limited in its ability to\ndetermine whether the protective effects of TBili are limited\nto only one form of Diabetes Mellitus, or whether the protec-\ntive effect influences the incidence and prevalence of both\nDM type1 and type 2. Also, the cross sectional nature of the\ndata derived from NHAHES's methodology hinders deter-\nmination of a temporal association or the cause-and-effect\nbetween TBili and development of DM type 1 or type 2. The\nlack of fractionation of TBili also limits our ability to deter-\nmine whether it is the indirect fraction, the direct fraction,\nor a combined effect of the varied fractions of TBili, which\nconvey the protective effect we described in this study [24].\nIn conclusion, there appears to be a beneficial effect of\nTBili on Diabetes. Further investigation is warranted in or-\nder to delineate whether this protective phenomenon extends\nto all forms of Diabetes Mellitus, whether it is conveyed by\nboth Indirect and Direct Bilirubin, and what avenues are\navailable to therapeutically raise an at-risk patient's bilirubin\nlevels for optimal protection from this dreaded disease.\nReferences\n1.
