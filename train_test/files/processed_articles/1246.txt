Khoury for the CDC/NCI\nNHANES III Genomics Working Group\nPopulation-based allele frequencies and genotype prevalence are important for measuring the contribution of\ngenetic variation to human disease susceptibility, progression, and outcomes. Population-based prevalence es-\ntimates also provide the basis for epidemiologic studies of gene\u00addisease associations, for estimating population\nattributable risk, and for informing health policy and clinical and public health practice. However, such prevalence\nestimates for genotypes important to public health remain undetermined for the major racial and ethnic groups in\nthe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Certain age and minority groups were\noversampled in this weighted, population-based US survey. Estimates of allele frequency and genotype preva-\nlence for 90 variants in 50 genes chosen for their potential public health significance were calculated by age, sex,\nand race/ethnicity among non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans. These nationally\nrepresentative data on allele frequency and genotype prevalence provide a valuable resource for future epidemi-\nologic studies in public health in the United States.\nalleles; continental population groups; ethnic groups; genetics, population; genotype; nutrition surveys; polymor-\nphism, genetic; prevalence\nAbbreviations: CDC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; CI, confidence interval; NCHS, National Center for Health\nStatistics; NCI, National Cancer Institute; NHANES III, Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; SNP, single\nnucleotide polymorphism.\nCompletion of the human genome sequence (1\u00ad3) and\nrecent advances in the analysis of genome-wide associations\nfor several common diseases (4\u00ad20) are generating tremen-\ndous opportunities for epidemiologic studies to evaluate the\nrole of genetic variants in the etiology of common human\ndiseases. Identification of allelic variants has accelerated as\na result of the cataloging and mapping of single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) throughout the genome by the In-\nternational HapMap Project (21\u00ad23) and characterization of\nthe scope of structural variation, including copy number var-\niants, in the genome (24\u00ad27). Application of these advances\nto improve public health requires assessing the frequency of\nthese variants in distinct populations, identifying diseases\ninfluenced by these variants, determining the magnitude of\nthe associated risks, and elucidating gene\u00adgene and gene\u00ad\nenvironment interactions. Although the number of published\ninvestigations in these areas of human genome epidemiology\nhas increased rapidly, with publication of more than 6,000\nreports yearly (28), methodological issues have made it dif-\nficult to integrate the evidence and, thus, to easily translate\nthe findings into public health improvements (29\u00ad31).\nEarly studies of genotype prevalence used samples that\nwere convenient to obtain, and minimal information was\nprovided on the selection of participants (31). In addition,\nCorrespondence to Man-huei Chang, National Office of Public Health Genomics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770 Buford\nmost estimates were calculated from data on small study\npopulations, which limited the accuracy of estimates of allele\nfrequency and genotype prevalence. Furthermore, frequencies\nfor most genetic polymorphisms have been measured only in\nselect US racial and ethnic groups and have not been presented\nby age group or by sex. Although select polymorphism fre-\nquencies have been reported in large populations (32, 33),\nthese studies were community based or controls from larger\ncase-control studies. In contrast, data on genetic variants can\nbe obtained from large, well-designed, epidemiologically\nwell-characterized, and population-based US surveys such as\nthe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) (34, 35). These data are a unique and unpar-\nalleled resource for epidemiologic research to assess genetic\nvariation in the population, gene\u00addisease associations, inter-\nactions between gene\u00adgene and gene\u00adenvironment factors,\nand population-attributable risk for genetic variants.\nIn particular, NHANES III offers the opportunity to assess\ngenetic variation among major racial and ethnic groups in the\nUnited States, for whom multiple health disparities exist\n(36\u00ad40). Health disparities result from the complex interac-\ntions of social, environmental, behavioral, and genetic in-\nfluences in a diverse population (36, 41, 42). Public health\nstrategies to address health disparities are more likely to be\neffective when they are based on sound integration of such\nrisk information at the population level. NHANES III is\na paradigm for complex analysis of unbiased, population-\nbased data on social, environmental, behavioral, and biologic\ncharacteristics--including genetic variation--in relation to\nhealth status.\nSurvey design\nNHANES III is a complex, multistage sample survey\nconducted by the National Center for Health Statistics\n(NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\ndesigned to provide national statistics on the health and\nnutritional status of the civilian, noninstitutionalized popu-\nlation in the United States aged 2 months or older. Certain\npopulations, including young children, older adults, non-\nHispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans, were over-\nsampled (35). As with standard NHANES analyses, race/\nethnic groups were defined on the basis of the combination\nof the reported race (black, white, other) and reported eth-\nnicity (not Hispanic, Mexican American, other Hispanic) of\nsurvey participants (35). Detailed household interviews\nwere conducted to obtain information on sociodemographic\nvariables, medical history, health-related behaviors, and use\nof medications. As part of the survey, physical examinations\nand laboratory and radiologic measurements were per-\nformed in special mobile examination centers (35).\nparticipants aged 12 years or older were examined in the\nmobile examination centers. As part of the examination\nconsent, participants agreed that their blood could be kept\nfor long-term storage and future research, although genetic\nresearch was not mentioned specifically. In August 2001,\nthe CDC/NCHS Ethics Review Board approved a revised\nplan for use of these specimens according to guidelines in\nthe August 1999 National Bioethics Advisory Commission\nreport on the use of stored biologic materials for research.\nThis revised plan allows linkage of the genetic laboratory\nresults to NHANES data through the NCHS Research Data\nCenter to ensure that confidentiality of the study partici-\npants' identities is maintained (44). Attempts were made\nto establish Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cell lines (35,\n2 participants. However, the final NHANES III DNA bank\ncontains 7,159 participants because of the inability to trans-\nform and grow a successful immortalized cell line\n(n \u00bc 1,004), concerns regarding laboratory practice and\nquality assurance (n \u00bc 21), and exclusion of 16 individuals\nwho were not genotyped. The bank is jointly maintained by\nboth NCHS and the National Center for Environmental\nHealth at CDC. Demographic characteristics of participants\nin the DNA bank are included in Table 1. Sixty-two percent\nof participants were from households with multiple family\nmembers (average, 1.59 members per household; range,\n1\u00ad11). This prevalence study was approved by the NCHS\nEthics Review Board.\nSelection of candidate genes and variants\nMembers from a multidisciplinary working group\nreviewed available phenotype data from NHANES III,\nperformed systematic literature reviews, and identified\ncandidate genes and physiologic pathways thought to be\nassociated with diseases of public health significance at\nthe time of project initiation. The selection of polymor-\nphisms for this study was also based upon input from the\nSNP500Cancer resource (45), which had already developed\ngenotyping assays for numerous SNPs in the selected genes\nbased on their potential importance to physiologic pro-\ncesses, epidemiologic studies, and health outcomes.\nThe selected variants are in genes that encode proteins in\n6 major cellular and physiologic pathways: 1) nutrient me-\ntabolism (e.g., homocysteine, lipids, glucose, and alcohol);\n2) immune and inflammatory responses; 3) xenobiotic me-\ntabolism (e.g., of drugs, carcinogens, or environmental con-\ntaminants); 4) DNA repair; 5) hemostasis and the renin-\nangiotensin-aldosterone system; and 6) oxidative stress.\nThe variants are in pathways affecting the development of\nmultiple diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabe-\ntes, cancer, and infectious diseases, as well as modulation of\nthe effects of environmental and occupational exposures.\nGenotyping methods\nDNA analysis for the project was performed at two facil-\nities because neither lab had methodology developed to an-\nalyze all of the genetic variants: 1) the Core Genotyping\nFacility, National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes\nof Health, Bethesda, Maryland (http://cgf.nci.nih.gov), and\n2) the Division of Laboratory Sciences, National Center for\nEnvironmental Health, CDC, Atlanta, Georgia. Each lab\nGenetic Variant Prevalence in NHANES III 55\nanalyzed all DNA specimens for each subset of genotyping\nassays performed.\nMost polymorphisms were assayed by either the TaqMan\nassay (5# nuclease assay; Applied Biosystems, Foster City,\nCalifornia) or the MGB Eclipse assay (3# hybridization-\ntriggered fluorescence reaction; Nanogen (formerly Epoch\nBiosciences), Bothell, Washington). Two polymorphisms were\ngenotyped by pyrosequencing, and one was by capillary frag-\nment analysis. Water controls and DNA samples with known\ngenotypes, purchased from Coriell Cell Repositories (Cam-\nden, New Jersey), were included on each 384-well plate. De-\ntailed genotyping methods, including primer and probe\nsequences, are described in Web Appendix 1 and Web Table 1,\nrespectively.(ThisinformationisdescribedinWeb-onlymaterial\nthat includes 8 Web appendixes, 1 Web table, and 1 Web figure;\neach is preceded by ``Web'' in the text. All are posted on the\nJournal's website (http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/).)\nQuality control\nThe NHANES III genotyping data were monitored by\na quality assurance and quality control committee composed\nof experts in laboratory science at CDC and NCI. The group\nmonitored results of NHANES III quality control genotyp-\ning to ensure that the data met quality control guidelines\nestablished by NCHS.\nInitial quality assurance assessments determined that at\nleast 7,128 specimens, depending on the laboratory, were\nsuitable for genotyping analysis on the basis of sample qual-\nity. All polymorphisms with genotyping call rates below\n95% completion did not meet quality control criteria and\nwere removed from further analyses. NHANES provides\n480 quality control specimens for all studies that use the\nNHANES III DNA bank samples. These include blind rep-\nlicates of approximately 6% of the 7,159 samples, to de-\ntermine the accuracy and reproducibility of the assays.\nAssays that passed the blind-replicate analyses (>98% con-\ncordance according to NCHS guidelines) were tested for\ndeviation from Hardy-Weinberg proportions calculated sep-\narately for each race/ethnic group in a standard unweighted\nanalysis (46). The threshold for a genetic variant to pass\nHardy-Weinberg analysis was P ! 0.01 (2 sided) for at least\n2 of the 3 main race/ethnic groups (i.e., non-Hispanic white,\nnon-Hispanic black, and Mexican American), with use of\na chi-square goodness-of-fit test. The race/ethnicity cate-\ngory ``other'' was not used in determining the deviation\nfrom Hardy-Weinberg proportions because of the genetic\nheterogeneity of this group. Data from 192 samples were\nremoved from certain assays because of a sample handling\nissue discovered in one of the laboratories. Genetic variants\nthat met all quality control guidelines were used for further\nanalyses. The range of successful genotype identifications\nResults from the tests of deviations from Hardy-Weinberg\nproportions for these variants are listed in Web Appendix 2.\nOverall, 90 variants in 50 genes were available for esti-\nmation of allele frequency and genotype prevalence. Nearly\nall (n \u00bc 87) of the variants genotyped are SNPs, and 3 are\ninsertion/deletions. Various diseases or conditions for which\nthese genes have a confirmed or purported association are\nTable 1.

Because NHANES III is a multistage,\ncomplex sample survey, all statistical analyses must account\nfor sample weights and the survey design to produce unbiased\nnational estimates and appropriate standard errors. The vari-\nance in clustered data caused by households with multiple\nrelated study participants was accounted for by use of the\nappropriate sample weights and the survey design in SUDAAN\nsoftware (SUDAAN Statistical Software Center, Research\nTriangle Park, North Carolina). Point estimates and variances\nwere calculated by using sample weights recalculated (47) for\nthe Genetic Component of NHANES III. These weights were\nderived from the appropriate NHANES III, Phase 2, mobile\nexamination center (MEC) sample weights to adjust for par-\nticipant refusal to consent to future research and from the in-\nability to generate cell lines and obtain DNA as mentioned\nabove. NHANES genetic weights are specifically estimated\nfor the genetic component of the 7,159 DNA bank participants,\nand none of the other weights provided by NHANES is appro-\npriate. More detailed information about statistical weights in\nNHANES III is available online (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/\nabout/major/nhanes/nh3data_genetic.htm).\nPrevalence estimation. Analyses were conducted by us-\ning SAS-callable SUDAAN, version 9.01, and SAS, version\n9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina). Deviations\nfrom Hardy-Weinberg proportions were tested with a chi-\nsquare goodness-of-fit approach by using SAS/Genetics\n(SAS Institute, Inc.). Allele frequency and genotype preva-\nlence were calculated in SUDAAN and weighted by using\nthe NHANES III Genetic Component sample weights for\neach gene variant for all major race/ethnic groups (i.e., non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,\nand other) (data for ``other'' are not shown), age groups,\nand sexes. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals\nwere calculated and weighted for each race/ethnic group\nin SUDAAN to obtain the nationally representative esti-\nmates for the US population. The Taylor series linearization\napproach (48, 49), which derives a linear approximation of\nvariance estimates to develop corrected standard errors and\nconfidence intervals, was implemented to estimate variances.\nTests of the difference in allele frequencies among race/ethnic\ngroups (``other'' was excluded), age groups, and sexes were\nperformed by using polytomous logistic regression. Tests of\nthe differences in genotype prevalence among these groups\nwere evaluated using the Wald chi-square method. Statistical\nsignificance was considered as P < 0.05. The differences in\nallele frequency and genotype prevalence by age and by sex\nwere examined after adjustment for race/ethnicity by using the\nCochrane-Mantel-Haenszel test at a significance level of 0.05.\nRESULTS\nDemographic characteristics of the 7,159 participants in\nthe NHANES III DNA bank are described in Table 1. After\nadjustment for the NHANES III sample design and for non-\nresponse in the genetic component, there were slightly more\nwomen than men in the US population between 1991 and\n1994. The weighted frequency for each of the 3 main race/\nHispanic black, and 5.7% Mexican American. The highest\nweighted frequency of persons aged 60 or more years and\nthe lowest weighted frequency of persons aged 12\u00ad19 years\nwere observed in non-Hispanic whites.\nWeighted allele frequency point estimates for the 90 ge-\nnetic variants for each of the 3 major race/ethnic subgroups\nin the US population are shown in Table 2. Complete fre-\nquency estimates with confidence intervals are shown in\nWeb Figure 1 and Web Appendix 4. Allele frequencies were\nsignificantly different across race/ethnic groups for 88\ncies among the three major race/ethnic groups are shown in\nHispanic blacks, and 80 (88.9%) among Mexican Americans\nhad allele frequencies of 0.02 or greater.\nDifferences in minor allele frequency of more than 20%\n(absolute value) compared with non-Hispanic whites are\nand 7.8% (2 of 90) for Mexican Americans (data not\nshown). Comparisons between NHANES III allele fre-\nquency estimates and other publicly available data sources\nare shown in Figure 1, with variants in MTHFR and VDR as\nexamples. As observed, the NHANES III study includes\nmuch larger sample sizes, resulting in frequency estimates\nwith small confidence intervals.\nSignificant differences in genotype prevalence across\nrace/ethnic groups were seen for all variants except three:\nHardy-Weinberg proportions were seen for 4 of the 90 poly-\nmorphisms (4.4%) among non-Hispanic whites, 1 (1.1%)\namong non-Hispanic blacks, and 5 (5.6%) among Mexican\nWeighted allele and genotype frequencies did not differ\nsignificantly by age group in the US population for the ma-\njority of the polymorphisms. However, 16 variants (17.8%)\ndiffered significantly in allele frequency, and 21 (23.3%) dif-\nfered significantly in genotype prevalence by age (data not\nshown). After adjustment for race/ethnicity, these numbers\ndecreased dramatically to 5 (5.6%) polymorphisms for allele\ngenotype prevalence (Web Appendix 6). However, we found\nthat some of the race/ethnicity-adjusted tests may not be\nreliable because of zero cell counts.\nThere were no significant differences in allele frequencies\nadjustment for race/ethnicity, the allele frequencies of\nAppendix 7). After adjustment for race/ethnicity, the geno-\ntype prevalence of two variants was significantly different\nGenetic Variant Prevalence in NHANES III 57\nTable 2.

This is the first relatively large-scale, population-based\neffort in the United States to obtain such data by race/ethnic\ngroup. These data and future planned analyses will serve as an\nimportant reference for investigations into US population\nstructure, for examinations of gene\u00addisease associations in\nother investigations of the NHANES data set, for calculation\nof attributable risk, and for use as a reference by researchers\nin the design of further studies to discover associations of\nalleles and genotypes with common diseases.\nEstimates of allele frequency and genotype prevalence\nare available from a number of existing gene variant data-\nbases, including the International HapMap Project (21\u00ad23)\n(http://www.hapmap.org) and the SNP500Cancer Database\n(45) (http://snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov). However, compari-\nsons between NHANES III and such databases are limited\nbecause of significant differences in inclusion criteria, study\npopulations, and classification of racial and ethnic groups\nbetween NHANES III and the other studies. Especially im-\nportant is that these public databases function as genomic\ndiscovery tools. Consequently, their study populations were\ndrawn largely from a small number of non-population-based\nsamples. These small numbers of participants preclude ac-\ncurate estimation of allele frequency and genotype preva-\nlence, especially for rare variants or those that vary\nsignificantly by race and ethnicity. We compared two variants\nin MTHFR and VDR with other data resources and found\nsubstantial differences in allele frequencies (Figure 1).\nin the African-American population. However, NHANES III\nCI: 26.8, 29.6), respectively. In conclusion, the NHANES III\nestimates of allele frequency and genotype prevalence in the\nUS population are more representative and stable than are\nthose calculated from previously available data.\nIn this study, allele frequency (in 88 of 90 genetic var-\niants) and genotype prevalence (in 87 of 90 variants) dif-\nfered significantly by race/ethnic group. Non-Hispanic\nblacks had considerable differences in minor allele fre-\nquency compared with non-Hispanic whites, with almost\none-quarter of variants differing by at least 20% (absolute\ndifference). In contrast, less than 10% of variants differed\nby at least 20% in allele frequency between Mexican Amer-\nicans and non-Hispanic whites. Differences in allele and\ngenotype frequency could partially contribute to differences\nin disease occurrence between population subgroups.

This finding has been duplicated in some\ngenome-wide association studies (13\u00ad15), although not\nin all populations (51, 52). The higher CC genotype\nprevalence in non-Hispanic blacks (95.0%) compared with\nnon-Hispanic whites (75.8%) may be a strong contributing\nfactor to the increased risk of type 2 diabetes among non-\nHispanic blacks, as this PPARG variant has been estimated to\nhave a large population attributable risk of ~25% (50). Be-\ncause differences in the occurrence of common human dis-\neases among populations reflect variation in genetic factors,\nenvironmental factors, and their interaction, population-\nbased genotype data, when coupled with other disease risk\nfactors, will give us better insight into the causes of popula-\ntion differences in the occurrence of various diseases.\nOn the other hand, allele frequency and genotype preva-\nlence did not differ significantly between men and women\nfor most of the genetic variants studied (!97.8%). Similar\nfindings on allele frequency or genotype prevalence by sex\nhave also been reported in some large studies (32, 33).\nAlthough we report statistically significant differences by\nage for approximately one-fifth of the genetic variants stud-\nied, most of these differences were no longer present after\nadjustment for race/ethnicity. This finding is likely attribut-\nable to the differences in age distribution between the race/\nethnic groups (Table 1). Some of the significant differences\nin allele frequencies by age may indicate survival advan-\ntage, and other studies have found variants in or near\n(58) associated with aging or longevity. However, few genes\nhave been reproducibly shown to do so (59, 60), and our\nresults could be due to insufficient sample sizes or due to\nstatistical chance in analyses.\nThere has been a concern that multiple individuals from\na household were included (average household, 1.59 indi-\nviduals; range, 1\u00ad11) in NHANES III for the estimation of\nallele and genotype frequencies. However, the estimates\nwere calculated by using methods specifically designed to\nanalyze data from surveys with complex designs. These\nmethods adopt NHANES III sample weights and adjust\nthe variance of the estimate among the correlated observa-\ntions. NHANES III is a population-based survey that reflects\nthe actual and overall genetic structure of the general US\npopulation, which contains many related individuals within\nor between subpopulations. Thus, inclusion of related indi-\nviduals in the NHANES III survey should enhance the gen-\neralizability of estimates derived from these data.\nTable 3.

All data except those for NHANES III have\nbeen deposited in dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/).\nSome potential limitations of this study are notable. First,\nNHANES III categorizes race and ethnicity according to\nself-reported affiliation, as do most epidemiologic studies.\nThere is considerable literature on the accuracy of this social\nmeasure as a proxy for genetic ancestry (61\u00ad65). Despite the\npossible misclassification or oversimplification of genetic\nancestry, these data may help to elucidate the uncertain\ncontribution of genetic variation (65, 66) to the complex\ninteractions among social, environmental, and behavioral\ninfluences in a diverse population that contribute to racial\nand ethnic health disparities. Another concern is that homo-\nzygotes were not detected for some rare polymorphisms in\nthis study, and thus the statistical tests for these genetic\nvariants may not be reliable. In addition, future studies of\ngene\u00addisease associations and gene\u00adenvironment interac-\ntions with rare variants may be limited by insufficient sam-\nple sizes when analyses are performed separately for each\nrace/ethnic group and control for large numbers of variables.\nIn the near future, we plan to use race and ethnicity, as\nwell as geographic information, to conduct a focused exam-\nination of the genetic substructure of the US population and\nsubpopulations. This issue is generating increased interest,\nbecause latent population substructure has been discovered\nin populations previously thought to be relatively homoge-\nneous (67, 68). Such analyses are, therefore, especially im-\nportant for the heterogeneous US population and\nconsidering the high levels of admixture within African-\nAmerican and Mexican-American populations (69\u00ad72).\nMultiple studies demonstrate that population substructure\nmust be taken into account in the design and interpretation\nresearch on population characteristics and genetic diversity\nwill be invaluable in conducting genetic epidemiologic stud-\nies in the United States.\nDetermination of the prevalence of genetic polymor-\nphisms associated with common diseases of public health\nimportance in the US population and in subgroups of the\npopulation is a critical first step in evaluating the genetic\nepidemiology of complex diseases. These prevalence esti-\nmates can be used in predicting sample size requirements\nfor future epidemiologic studies to evaluate genetic deter-\nminants of susceptibility to chronic and infectious diseases,\nthe severity of disease, and interactions with other risk fac-\ntors. Because data on genotype frequency are particularly\nsparse for non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans, our\nestimates are useful in sample size calculations for studying\nthe genomic contribution to the health of these populations.\nInvestigations currently underway examine the associations\nof the reported genetic variants with select nutritional, bio-\nchemical, and clinical characteristics in the NHANES III\ndata set that serve as markers or risk factors for numerous\nhealth outcomes. These outcomes include asthma and chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, cardiovascular dis-\nease, viral infections, and osteoporosis.\nWith the recent successes of genome-wide association\nstudies, the resource of the NHANES III DNA bank offers\nsignificant opportunities to move beyond investigations of\ncandidate genes, as was done here. Many recent genome-\nwide association studies have uncovered replicable genetic\nassociations with diseases such as breast (4\u00ad6), prostate (7, 9),\nthese large-scale, case-control studies did not use represen-\ntative samples of the underlying populations from which the\ncases were derived. NHANES is the only nationally repre-\nsentative, population-based sample survey that systemati-\ncally collects physical, physiologic, imaging, laboratory,\nand interview data on a large number of individuals in the\nUnited States. Use of a whole-genome approach to assess\nthe prevalence of genetic polymorphisms, including copy\nnumber variants, in the NHANES III DNA bank will be\nan important next step toward identifying genetic variants\nthat can help to predict disease susceptibility and progres-\nsion. This approach will also provide the basis for estimat-\ning the numbers of people in the United States who may\nbenefit from genome-based tools, such as risk factor reduc-\ntion; disease screening efforts; or diagnostic tests, drugs, or\nother preventive or therapeutic interventions. Current and\nfuture NHANES III prevalence estimates will be deposited\ninto a publicly accessible database for research.\nThus, this first effort in NHANES begins to lay a strong\nscientific foundation for studying the impact of genetic var-\niation on common diseases in the United States and in the\nfuture evaluation of biomarkers and diagnostic tests. Infor-\nmation derived from NHANES will provide an important\nreference and will enhance the translation of genomic in-\nformation into clinical and public health practice.\n"
