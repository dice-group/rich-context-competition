However Hispanics\nand Asians are each comprised of several ethnic subgroups that differ with respect to country of origin, immigration history,\nand geographic distribution across the U.S. Among adolescents, ethnic differences in obesity have been previously\nreported, but no studies have examined longitudinal change in body mass index (BMI) by Hispanic and Asian subgroup\ncategory to understand when and why these disparities emerge, especially during the critical transition between\nadolescence and adulthood.\nMethods: Using nationally-representative, longitudinal data from 1355 Hispanics (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central/\nSouth American, Other Hispanic), 520 Asians (Chinese, Filipino, Other Asian), and 5061whites from the National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent Health (Waves II\u00adIV: 1996\u00ad2009), we used linear mixed spline models to examine whether Hispanic and\nAsian adolescent subgroups shared the same BMI trajectories as whites as they aged into adulthood. We also investigated\nthe role of social and behavioral factors in explaining race/ethnic differences.\nResults: Among Hispanics, Mexican and Puerto Rican-origin individuals exhibited faster increases in BMI both in\nadolescence and in adulthood and these patterns were not attributable to the measured social and behavioral factors. There\nwas also evidence of emerging disparities in Cuban males, and in Central/South Americans relative to whites. In contrast,\nChinese, Filipino, and Other Asian adolescents had significantly lower BMI and slower BMI increases in adulthood compared\nto whites. In models adjusted for social and behavioral factors, Chinese-white and Other Asian-white differentials remained\nunexplained.\nConclusions: Aggregate estimates of Hispanics and Asians mask important heterogeneity in BMI. A better understanding of\nweight dynamics early in the life course can inform how and when disparities emerge to better target prevention efforts.\nCitation: Albrecht SS, Gordon-Larsen P (2013) Ethnic Differences in Body Mass Index Trajectories from Adolescence to Adulthood: Focus on Hispanic and Asian\nEditor: Susanne Breuer Votruba, NIDDK/NIH, United States of America\nCopyright: \u00df 2013 Albrecht, Gordon-Larsen.

Albrecht1*, Penny Gordon-Larsen1,2\n1 Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America, 2 Department of Nutrition, Gillings School of Global Public\nHealth, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America\n Introduction\nAlthough obesity has impacted all segments of society, rates are\nhigh in Hispanic and low in Asian as compared to white\nadolescents and adults in the United States [1\u00ad3]. Disparities,\nespecially in Hispanics, also appear to be exacerbating over time.\nHispanic adolescents increased 120% compared to 50% for whites\nMuch of this literature examines Hispanics and Asians as single\npan-ethnic groups despite the fact that each are comprised of\nseveral ethnicities that are heterogeneous with respect to country\nof origin, genetic ancestry, immigration history, and geographic\ndistribution which likely contribute to variation in weight\npatterning. While there has been increasing recognition of\nHispanic and Asian subgroup heterogeneity in health research\n[5,6], data limitations have precluded their disaggregation.\nNevertheless disentangling these pan-ethnic categories is necessary\nto better identify sub-populations at greatest risk.\nLimited research on weight patterning by ethnic subgroup has\nbeen cross-sectional. In adults, Mexicans and Puerto Ricans had\nhigher overweight/obesity than Cubans [7]; Japanese, Filipino,\nand other Asian subgroups had higher overweight/obesity than\nChinese [8,9]. In U.S. adolescents, patterns are somewhat similar.\nA\nIn one study, obesity was more common in Puerto Rican than in\nMexican and Cuban adolescents [10]; in another, Mexican,\nPuerto Rican, and Cuban adolescents had similar obesity\nprevalence which was higher than in Central/South Americans\n[11]. In Asians, obesity was higher in Asians of other ancestral\nbackground compared to Chinese and Filipino adolescents [11].\nWhile there are clear ethnic subgroup disparities in obesity\namong Hispanics and Asians in the U.S., no studies to our\nknowledge have examined longitudinal changes in body mass\nindex (BMI) by ethnic subgroup to understand how and when\nthese disparities emerge, especially during the critical transition\nbetween adolescence and adulthood. Using longitudinal data from\nthe National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add\nHealth), we examined whether Hispanic and Asian adolescent\nsubgroups shared the same BMI trajectory as white adolescents as\nthey aged into adulthood. This allowed us to evaluate whether\nthere are sensitive periods in the life-course for the emergence of\nBMI disparities and if these sensitive periods differ across Hispanic\nand Asian subgroups. Consistent with past cross-sectional findings,\nwe hypothesized that among Hispanics, Mexican and Puerto\nRican respondents would exhibit faster increases in BMI from\nadolescence to adulthood relative to whites, and among Asians,\nChinese respondents would exhibit slower BMI increases. We also\ninvestigated the contribution of social and behavioral risk factors\nin explaining observed race/ethnic differences in adolescent BMI\nand in BMI change over time. Hispanics and Asians are projected\nto constitute an increasing share of the U.S. population [12,13].\nTherefore, a more nuanced understanding of the health patterns\nthat emerge will be important for the design of more effective\ninterventions.\nMaterials and Methods\nEthics\nData for the Add Health cohort were collected under protocols\napproved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of\nNorth Carolina at Chapel Hill. Written parental/guardian\nconsent and adolescent assent were obtained before the Wave I\ninterview. At Wave IV, written consent was obtained from all\nrespondents.\nData\nThe Add Health cohort is a nationally representative school-\nInformation on how to obtain the Add Health data files is\navailable on the Add Health website (http://www.cpc.unc.edu/\naddhealth). The study used a multistage, stratified, school-based,\nclustered sampling design and included interviews with 85% of the\nrespondents' parents. Additional subsamples were also drawn to\nprovide meaningful data on individuals of Chinese, Cuban, and\nPuerto Rican origin. Details regarding the survey design and\nsampling frame have been previously described [14]. Of the\nrespondents were eligible for follow-up regardless of wave II\nparticipation. Non-response analysis indicates no significant bias to\nAdd Health estimates from attrition across waves [15].\nThe analysis sample included white, Hispanic, and Asian\nrespondents interviewed in wave II with longitudinal, post-\nstratification sample weights (n = 7308). Exclusions included\nrespondents with missing measured height and weight at wave II\n(height and weight were not measured at wave I), and pregnant\nfemales, yielding a final analytic sample of 6936 adolescents from\nOther Hispanics (Dominicans and Hispanics of mixed ancestry),\nKoreans, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Asian Indians). Respondents\ncontributed anywhere from 1 to 3 height and weight observations\nindividuals) for longitudinal analyses (mean follow-up of 12 years).\nMeasures\nOutcome. Height (m) and weight (kg) were measured at\nwaves II through IV during in-home surveys using standardized\nprocedures. Before computing BMI (weight (kg)/height (m)2), we\nexcluded implausible height (n = 44) and weight (n = 17) values. In\nthe case where height change declined by .4 inch inches\n(n = 158), we substituted stable adult height across visits using\nmean values from exams where males were .17 years and females\nwere .15 years, or set values to missing if no such height\nmeasures were available at these ages. We utilized repeated,\ncontinuous measures for the dependent variable, BMI, in\nlongitudinal models. Even though BMI z-scores have been\nidentified as the optimal measure of body mass at a single time\npoint for children, raw BMI scores are recommended to evaluate\nchange in body mass during childhood and adolescence in\nlongitudinal studies. [16\u00ad18] Briefly, the CDC/NCHS reference\ncurves are based on repeated cross-sections and thus do not\nadequately capture individual growth patterns. Furthermore,\ngiven the heterogeneity in our cohort and the fact that the\nCDC/NCHS reference curves do not adequately capture this\nethnic diversity in Hispanics and Asians \u00ad the primary groups of\ninterest in our study, BMI Z-scores are not ideal.\nIndependent variables. Data on ethnicity and country of\norigin/ancestry were obtained by respondent and parental self-\nreport at wave I. A single race/ethnicity variable was created and\nused to compare BMI patterns across Hispanic and Asian\nsubgroups relative to the non-Hispanic white referent group.\nImmigrant generation was based on adolescents' and parents'\nplace of birth. Generation one included children not born on the\nmainland U.S., Alaska or Hawaii. Although Puerto Ricans are\nU.S. citizens by birth, we classified Puerto Rican-born respondents\nas first generation as per the established acculturation-based\napproach [11,19]. Generation two or greater included U.S.-born\nchildren with either foreign-born or U.S.-born parents.\nMarkers of childhood socioeconomic status (SES) included\nparental education and welfare receipt prior to age 18 years.\nParents' education was measured as the higher of either the\nmother's or father's education: less than high school, high school/\nGED, some college, and college degree or more. Welfare receipt\nwas constructed from data on the family's receipt of public\nassistance/welfare from waves I and II, in combination with a\nretrospective report at wave III.\nLifestyle behaviors. We also explored whether behaviors\nknown to influence adolescent BMI and BMI change could\nexplain observed ethnic differences. Current smoking (yes/no),\nscreen time (hours of TV, video, and computer game use per\nweek), and physical activity (weekly bouts of moderate to vigorous\nphysical activity) were ascertained at all waves. These measures\nwere based on standard, interview-administered questionnaires\nvalidated in other epidemiologic studies [20]. Using responses\nfrom the waves I and II In-Home Questionnaires, we also\nascertained whether respondents regularly skipped breakfast (yes/\nno).\nEthnic Differences in Body Mass Index Trajectories\nOther controls: respondents' age at each exam and sex (male/\nfemale).\nStatistical Analysis\nAnalyses were performed using Stata software, version 12.1\n(Stata Corp, College Station, Texas). Descriptive analyses used\npost-stratification sample weights to reflect national population\nestimates. Adjusted Wald tests compared means and design-based\nF-tests compared the distribution of categorical variables across\nethnic groups. All analyses used multiple stages of cluster sampling\nto adjust for survey design effects.\nWe used mixed linear spline models with the unstructured\ncovariance specification to estimate Hispanic and Asian subgroup\ndifferences in mean baseline BMI and in BMI change, relative to\nnon-Hispanic whites, as adolescents aged into adulthood. Mixed\nmodels are well suited for studies of individual changes over time,\nusing repeated measures of an outcome to estimate a growth\ntrajectory defined by an intercept (baseline) and a slope (rate of\nchange). These models allow for missing outcome data, so that all\nparticipants with at least one BMI measure were included in the\nanalyses. Age (in years) represented the measure of time.\nSmoothing splines were used to characterize the non-linear\nrelationship between age and BMI. Various numbers and positions\nof knots were compared to find the best fit for the data. The\noptimal model had one knot placed at age 20 years, based on a\ncomparison of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) across the\ndifferent models tested. Age was centered at the earliest observed\nage, so that the model intercept represented mean BMI at age 12.\nThe slope represents the change in BMI per increase in year of\nage. Random effects at the individual level were included for the\nintercept and linear age term, allowing both intercept and linear\nslope to vary between individuals.\nThe base model included the race/ethnicity variable and\ninteractions between race/ethnicity and the linear age and age\nspline terms, adjusting for sex and study site region. The coefficient\nfor the race/ethnicity term tested whether, at age 12, mean BMI\ndiffered across the five Hispanic and three Asian subgroups\ncompared to non-Hispanic whites. The interactions tested whether\nthe BMI trajectories after age 12 (linear age term), and after age 20\n(age spline term), differed by race/ethnicity. We subsequently\nintroduced predictors for immigrant generation, SES, and\nbehaviors in sequential models to investigate whether these social\nand behavioral factors explained observed ethnic differences in\nBMI. We assessed potential confounding by evaluating whether\ntheir inclusion changed model estimates. All covariates, except for\ntime-varying variables, were also interacted with the age terms.\nContinuous variables (screen time and physical activity) were\ncentered on their grand means to facilitate model interpretation.\nInteraction terms between sex and race/ethnicity at baseline and\nwith the age terms were also tested to investigate whether race/\nethnic patterns differed for males and females. In sensitivity\nanalyses, we restricted the sample to respondents ,16 years of age\nat baseline. Although some ethnic-specific estimates were no\nlonger significant, the magnitude and direction of the associations\nwere consistent with the results we report for the overall sample\n(results not shown).\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nHispanics. At the youngest ages (12\u00ad14 years), mean BMI was\nsimilaracrosssubgroupscomparedtowhites(Table1).HoweverBMI\nincreased with age to a greater extent among Mexican and Puerto\nRicanoriginrespondents.Central/SouthAmericanshadthehighest\nproportion of first generation immigrants whereas Puerto Rican\nadolescents were primarily U.S.-born. All Hispanics were dispro-\nportionately concentrated in lower SES groups than whites with\nvariabilitybysubgroup(e.g.53%ofMexicanadolescentshadparents\nwith less than high school education; Central/South American\nadolescents had the highest proportion of parents with at least a\ncollege degree (22%)). Ethnic differences were apparent for some\nhealth behaviors. For example, smoking rates were lower for all\nHispanic subgroups compared to whites in adolescence and in\nadulthood. Puerto Ricans were the exception as smoking rates were\ncomparable to whites in adolescence, and exceeded rates among\nwhites in adulthood.\nAsians. ChineseandOtherAsianshadsignificantlylowermean\nBMI than whites at 12\u00ad14 years of age, which remained lower with\nincreasing age (Table 1). Although adolescent BMI among Filipinos\nwas slightly lower than whites, this difference was not statistically\nsignificant. Nevertheless, there was some evidence that mean BMI\nincreasedintoadulthoodat aslowerrateforFilipinosthanforwhites.\nChineseindividualsweremorelikelytobeU.S.-bornthanFilipinosor\nOtherAsians.Allsubgroupshadahigherproportionofparentswitha\ncollege degree than whites. Notable differences in health behaviors\nincluded a lower proportion of smokers among all Asian subgroups\ncompared to whites.\nMulti-variable Analyses\nIn age, sex, and region-adjusted models, there were no\nsignificant differences in mean BMI at age 12 for any of the\nHispanic subgroups compared to whites (Model 1, Table 2 and\nFigure 1A). However the significant, positive coefficients for the\nBMI slopes for Mexicans (MX) and Puerto Ricans (PR) relative to\nwhites indicated a faster rise in BMI from age 12 to ,20 years\n(hereafter referred to as `adolescence') (MX: b = .15 kg/m2,\nand on (hereafter referred to as `adulthood') (MX: b = 0.08 kg/m2,\nincrease more slowly for Cubans and faster for Central/South\nAmericans in adolescence, there was little difference in the rate of\nBMI growth after the age of 20 years compared to whites.\nAmong Asians, mean BMI at baseline (age 12 years) was\nsignificantly lower than whites for all Asian subgroups: Chinese\n1, Table 2 and Figure 1B). Although results indicated no\nsignificant differences in the rate of BMI change in adolescence\ncompared to whites for all Asians, the magnitude of the estimate\nfor Filipinos suggested a slightly faster rise for this subgroup\nsignificantly slower extent for all Asians compared to whites.\nIn sequential models, we added immigrant generation (Model 2),\nparental SES (Model 3), and health behaviors (Model 4). After\nadjustingforthehigherproportionofimmigrantsamongmanyofthe\nHispanic subgroups (Model 2, Table 2), mean difference estimates in\nbaseline BMI increased for Cubans and Central/South Americans.\nInotherwords,ifnotforthehealth`protective'influenceofimmigrant\nstatus, compared to whites, Cubans would have higher mean BMI at\nage 12 years, and Central/South Americans would have more\nsimilar mean BMI values. Central/South Americans also exhibited\nfaster increases in BMI in adolescence after adjusting for immigrant\nIn Asians, immigrant status partially attenuated mean BMI\ndifferences at age 12 in all subgroups, but to a greater extent\namong Filipinos. While not statistically significant, the larger BMI\nslope estimate also pointed to an increase in the magnitude of the\nBMI change during adolescence for Filipinos relative to whites.\nEthnic Differences in Body Mass Index Trajectories\nTable 1.

In all Asians, there was additional\nattenuation of BMI differences at baseline with the addition of\nparental SES, though these estimates remained statistically\nsignificant for all subgroups except Filipinos.\nSkippingbreakfast,higherscreentime,lowerphysicalactivity,and\nnot currently smoking were all highly associated with higher BMI\n(Model 4, Table 2). Among Hispanics, although baseline ethnic\ndifferences in BMI were even further attenuated, there was little\nchange to longitudinal estimates. In other words, the faster BMI\nincreases in adolescence and adulthood for Mexicans and Puerto\nRicans, and in adolescence for Central/South Americans, remained\nunexplained after inclusion of social and behavioral covariates. For\nAsians, rather than attenuating estimates, accounting for lifestyle\nbehaviors further magnified BMI differences at age 12 years among\nChinese, Filipinos, and Other Asians compared to whites. These\nbehaviors also did not explain the faster BMI increase in adolescence\namong Filipinos, or the slower BMI increases in adulthood exhibited\nby all Asian subgroups relative to whites.\nSome race/ethnic patterns in baseline (age 12 years) BMI and\nBMI change differed by sex in the fully adjusted model (Model 4;\nP-interaction ,0.0001). To facilitate interpretation, predicted\nvalues using coefficients from this fully-adjusted model stratified by\nsex were plotted in separate figures for Hispanic (Figures 2A, 2B)\nand Asian (Figures 2C, 2D) females and males compared to whites.\nAmong Hispanic females, there were no race/ethnic differences in\nadolescent BMI after covariate adjustment as in the overall sample\n(Figure 2A), but among males, Other Hispanics had significantly\nlower BMI at age 12 years than whites (Figure 2B). During the\ntransition to adulthood, although Cuban females had similar rates\nof BMI increase as white females, consistent with findings from the\nmain effects model, Cuban males exhibited significantly larger\nincreases than white males during both adolescence and adult-\nhood. By the time respondents reached adulthood, all Hispanic\nfemales, except Cubans, had higher BMI than white females, and\nall Hispanics males, except Other Hispanics, had higher BMI than\nwhite males. Among Asians, the lower adolescent BMI and slower\nBMI increases in Chinese relative to whites occurred to a\nsignificantly greater extent in females than males (Figures 2C, 2D).\nDiscussion\nWe investigated whether BMI trajectories differed across\nsubgroups of Hispanics and Asians relative to white adolescents\ntransitioning to adulthood and evaluated what social and\nbehavioral factors might underlie these disparities. Among\nHispanics, Mexican and Puerto Rican-origin individuals exhibited\nfaster increases in BMI both in adolescence and in adulthood and\nthese patterns were not attributable to the social and behavioral\nfactors we measured. There was also evidence of emerging\ndisparities among Cuban males, and among Central/South\nAmericans relative to whites In Asians, the pattern previously\nreported in the literature whereby Asians overall had lower BMI\nthan whites was observed here for all three subgroups \u00ad Chinese,\nFilipino, and Other Asians - in age and sex-adjusted models. All\nAsians also experienced slower BMI increases in adulthood\nrelative to whites. However in adolescence, the BMI of Filipinos\nappeared to converge to levels found in whites. This was especially\nevident after accounting for immigrant status and SES which also\nattenuated BMI differences between Filipinos and whites at age 12\nyears. BMI differentials between Chinese and whites and Other\nAsians and whites, however, remained unexplained.\nPrevious studies in young children have documented higher\nBMI and faster BMI gains among Hispanics relative to whites and\nBlacks. In an analysis of data from the Early Childhood\nLongitudinal Study, the largest BMI gains during the elementary\nschool years occurred between 1st and 3rd grade; and across race/\nethnic groups, Hispanic boys and girls had the most excess gains\nrelative to whites [21]. Other work also showed that among\nchildren aged 6\u00ad11 years, Mexican-American boys and girls had\nhigher obesity prevalence than whites, and among boys, preva-\nlence was also higher in Mexican-Americans than Blacks [22].\nMuch of this research has examined Hispanics as a single group,\nor has reported findings that pertain only to Mexican-Americans.\nStudies that have investigated BMI differences by subgroup have\nbeen entirely cross-sectional [10,11], and thus are unable to\nexamine when disparities emerge and how they pattern into\nadulthood within the same individual. Our findings suggest that,\nespecially for Hispanics, BMI disparities relative to whites tend to\nbe concentrated among Mexican and Puerto Rican origin\nindividuals, regardless of sex, and these disparities considerably\nworsen as they get older. The adverse patterns we report for\nFigure 1. Mean BMI trajectories by Hispanic and Asian subgroups compared to whites, National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nHealth.

However despite adjustment for several\nsocial and behavioral covariates, we could not account for the\nsteeper BMI trajectories we observed. Conversely, we also could\nnot explain why Chinese and Other Asian adolescents in\nparticular had a lower adolescent BMI and a slower trajectory\nof increase. Change in body mass, at a proximal level, is a function\nof health behaviors linked to energy intake and expenditure.\nAlthough we had time-varying information available on key\ndeterminants of adolescent weight gain, such as physical activity,\nscreen time, and smoking, one major limitation of this work was\nthe lack of 24-hour dietary recall information and/or longitudinal\ndietary data which may have better accounted for race/ethnic\ndifferences in BMI trajectories.\nWe also cannot rule out the role of genetic factors in driving\nsusceptibility to increase in body mass among some Hispanics, and\nthe differential susceptibility among Chinese and Other Asians\nrelative to whites. Contemporary research is in the process of\ndisentangling the role of genetic influences, particularly as they\nrelate to the propensity for obesity and weight gain [23]. However\nthe population heterogeneity of Hispanics and Asians poses a\nchallenge for genetic health studies of nationalities or ethnic\ngroups since within-group genetic heterogeneity can arguably be\ngreater than across race/ethnic groups [24]. As a result, rather\nthan explain race/ethnic disparities, genetic markers may instead\nbe useful for investigating within-race/ethnic group differences to\nfurther identify at-risk subgroups.\nBeyond biological factors, adolescent body mass and its change\nover time are also strongly influenced by social, cultural, and other\nenvironmental factors that we did not account for [25]. For\nexample, there is research to suggest that there may be cultural\nfactors linked to perception of ideal body weight [26,27], and\ndifferential access to physical environmental and health-promoting\nresources [28\u00ad30], which may also contribute to ethnic differences\nin BMI trajectories from adolescence into adulthood. Future\nresearch should consider the role that such factors play in race/\nethnic subgroup patterning of BMI.\nThere were some additional limitations. Although Add Health\nover-sampled select ethnic groups, we nevertheless had small\nsample sizes for some categories which may have limited statistical\npower to test associations. Along these lines, grouping `Other\nAsians' and `Other Hispanics' also likely masked important\nassociations for distinct ethnicities such as Japanese, Indian-\nAmericans, Vietnamese, etc., and for Hispanic ethnicities such as\nFigure 2.

Predicted BMIs are based on adjusted model from\nModel 4, Table 2, stratified by sex.\nEthnic Differences in Body Mass Index Trajectories\nDominicans. Just as there is heterogeneity by ethnicity among\nHispanics and Asians, there is also ethnic heterogeneity among\nwhites that we did not account for.\nTherewerealsootherpotentialexplanatoryfactorsthatwedidnot\nassess. Early life circumstances associated with fetal under-nutrition,\nlow birthweight, and infant formula feeding have been associated\nwithrapidgrowthininfantsandyoungchildren,predisposingthemto\nadult obesity and its associated risks [31], especially when exposed to\nenvironments that promote positive energy balance. Future work\nshould also assess the role of potential early life determinants in\nexplaining race/ethnic disparities in BMI.\nOverlookingwithin-groupheterogeneityintheBMItrajectoriesof\nHispanicsandAsiansinthetransitionfromadolescencetoadulthood\nmasks important differences regarding how and when disparities\nemerge. We noted the development of BMI disparities for Mexicans\nand Puerto Ricans relative to whites that appeared to emerge in\nadolescence and widened into adulthood, and of a disparity that\nextended to other subgroups like Cuban males and to a lesser extent,\namong Central/South Americans. Obesity has consequences for\ndiabetesandothermetabolicabnormalities,andHispanicshavebeen\nshown to have among the highest risk of developing such\ncomplications [32]. As a result, our findings that most Hispanic\nsubgroups were at risk of more rapid gains in BMI in the transition\nfrom adolescence to adulthood when the antecedents for chronic\ndisease develop, will have implications for future chronic disease\nburdenintheU.S.,andforexacerbatingHispanic-whitedisparitiesin\nadulthood. For Asians, `protection' against higher BMI in adoles-\ncence among Filipinos was largely attributable to their socio-\ndemographic profile.

Thus, the lower\nbaselineBMIandslowerBMIincreasewereportforChinesedoesnot\nnecessarily reflect a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease.\nFuture research should seek to understand what other factors may\nunderlie existing race/ethnic disparities in BMI. Identification of\nthese factors will allow for improved targeting of obesity prevention\nefforts in ethnically-diverse youth.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: SSA.
