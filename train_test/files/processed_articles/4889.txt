Many types of adversity can be experienced by chil-\ndren, including physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, as\nwell as neglect and exposure to family violence. All of these\ntypes are subsumed under the general term of child maltreat-\nment (CM). CM has been shown to be a significant health\ndeterminant, leading to increased mortality and morbidity,\nincluding physical health problems, mental disorders, poor\nacademic performance, aggression, crime, suicidal behavior,\nand decreased quality of life (Gilbert et al., 2009). Most\nresearch conducted thus far on CM has been cross-sectional\nin nature or has had follow-up of only a few years after the\ntime of CM. Little is known about the long-term effects of\nCM or the factors that contribute to resilience in later life in\nthose with a history of CM.\nThe concept of resilience is not new, although there has\nbeen a recent burgeoning of research interest in this area. In\nfact, more than 85% of all research publications on resilience\nhave appeared in the last decade (Hjemdal, 2007). Early\nresearch on resilience focused on the identification of particu-\nlar qualities and personality traits, such as hardiness and self-\nefficacy, which help people to overcome adversity (Cicchetti\n& Garmezy, 1993). More recent research has focused on the\nprocess by which the qualities of resilience are acquired over\ntime and on the natural fluctuations that occur across the life\nspan. The latter may depend on the balance of stressors and\nprotective, compensatory, or resilience factors. This recent\nresearch has led to a shift in the predominant view of resil-\nience from that of an innate or inherited quality to one that is\nmore dynamic, contextual, and acquired. A recent conference\nof resilience researchers defined resilience as \"a dynamic pro-\ncess in which psychological, social, environmental, and bio-\nlogical factors interact to make an individual, at any stage of\nlife, to develop, maintain or regain their mental health despite\nThe more recent conceptualizations of resilience view it\nas an interactive dynamic process that develops through a\nrepetitive process of disruption and reintegration in response\nto adverse events (Richardson, 2002). Through this process,\nit is postulated that psychological protective factors that\nfacilitate positive adaptation to subsequent adverse life\nevents develop, thereby promoting positive mental health,\nwhich may wax and wane across the life span. Successful\nadaptation to later life requires this resilience to face the mul-\ntiple and almost inevitable challenges of this life stage, such\nas those related to health, socioeconomic circumstances,\nrelationships, and employment status.\nPrevious research suggests that many elderly people view\nthemselves as having aged successfully, despite the presence\nof chronic disease and disability (Depp, Vahia, & Jeste, 2010).\n1University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nDanielle Rodin, University of Toronto, 200 Elizabeth St. EN-7-229,Toronto,\nEmail: danielle.rodin@mail.utoronto.ca\nResilience in Elderly Survivors\nof Child Maltreatment\nDanielle Rodin1 and Donna E. Stewart1\n Keywords\nresilience, engagement, childhood maltreatment, elderly\n2 SAGE Open\nThese findings suggest that resilience may persist or emerge in\nthe elderly, despite the multiple stressors associated with ill-\nness and health limitations (Montross et al., 2006). With the\ndemographic shift toward older age in developed countries, it\nbecomes particularly important to understand those factors\nthat contribute to successful aging. Those who have been\nexposed to early life adversity, such as CM, may have acquired\nresilience and/or may still be suffering from its sequelae in\nlater life (Widom, Dumont, & Czaja, 2007), thereby affecting\ntheir adjustment to the losses of old age.\nSuccessful Aging\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) describes active\naging as \"the process of optimizing opportunities for health,\nparticipation, and security in order to enhance quality of life\ntive process that allows individuals to achieve their own life\ngoals and to maintain competence as they age. The chal-\nlenges of old age pass through what has been conceptualized\nas the \"lens\" (Hochhalter, Smith, & Ory, 2011) of an indi-\nvidual's personal resources, values, and attitudes, all of\nwhich affect the outcome of adaptation. Successful aging\nmay depend on the preservation of the \"building blocks\" of\nidentity (Kaufman, 1986) as well as the capacity to adapt\nflexibly to the challenges that threaten competence, well-\nbeing, and social engagement.\nThe concepts of resiliency and survivorship have been\nused in understanding the successful recovery from trau-\nmatic events, but have not been widely explored in elderly\nsurvivors of CM. In one study of elderly Holocaust survi-\nvors, a paradigm shift was identified as these individuals\naged, with their primary focus shifting from rebuilding their\nlives to maintaining their competence (Greene & Graham,\n2009). Other quantitative studies in different populations of\nolder people have identified characteristics that may contrib-\nute to resilience. These include sociodemographic factors\n(Beutel, Glaesmer, Decker, Fischbeck, & Brahler, 2009;\nFiske, Wetherell, & Gatz, 2009), health and well-being\n(Reichstadt, Depp, Palinkas, Folsom, & Jeste, 2007; Wells\n(Windle, Markland, & Woods, 2008), and a sense of mastery\nFurthermore, embeddedness in a social community (Hildon,\nMontgomery, Blane, Wiggins, & Netuveli, 2010), religious\naffiliation (Costanzo, Ryff, & Singer, 2009; June, Segal,\nCoolidge, & Klebe, 2009), and the presence of supportive\ntribute to resilience in older individuals.\nGender differences in resilience in the elderly have\nreceived only a small amount of research attention. A longi-\ntudinal study of Israeli Jews aged 75 to 94 found that men\nwere more physically active, had better cognition, gave more\nhelp to children, relied less on paid caretakers, and attended\nsynagogue more than women (Walter-Girtzburg, Shmotkin,\nBlumstein, & Shorek, 2005). However, it is not known if\ntheir lesser reliance on paid caregivers was a result of the\ncare they received from their wives and daughters, which\nmay have been less available to elderly women, many of\nwhom are widows. In a later study of rural Americans aged\n65 and older, women reported fewer health problems that\ninterfered with daily functioning and were more likely than\nmen to report that relationships, frame of mind, participation\nin activities and religion, and spiritual activities were impor-\ntant contributions to successful aging (Stark-Wroblewski,\nCurrent Study\nCM has been associated with a wide range of subsequent\npsychological disturbances and psychiatric disorders in\nchildhood. These include attention deficit hyperactivity dis-\norder, oppositional disorder, anxiety, mood, and substance\nuse disorders, and disturbances in affect regulation and\nattachment (Affifi, Boman, Fleisher, & Sareen, 2009; Affifi\nwith an increased risk in adulthood of depression, anxiety,\nsubstance abuse, personality disorders, and antisocial behav-\net al., 2007). In adults who experienced CM, resilience was\nfound in those who reported better perceived parental care,\nadolescent peer relationships, and quality of adult love rela-\nResilience research has the potential to elucidate the\nmechanisms that contribute to successful adaptation, psy-\nchological growth, and adverse mental health outcomes.\nSome research has been conducted regarding the effects of\nCM in childhood, but little has been known about their long-\nterm consequences in older adults. In particular, little is\nknown about the characteristics of older adults who have\nachieved and maintained resilience, despite exposure to CM.\nSuch information may be of value to educators, health care\nproviders, and policy makers to promote resilience across\nthe life span. Greater understanding of individual and con-\ntextual risk factors, and of the social determinants of health\nmay lead to more effective prevention and treatment\ninterventions.\nThe present study will explore resilience in older indi-\nviduals who have coped well with previous trauma, specifi-\ncally CM, to gain an understanding of the factors contributing\nto their resilience. Focusing on individuals with past adver-\nsity who have demonstrated resilience may enhance our\nunderstanding of this phenomenon and how it is altered by\nthe transformations of old age.\nMethod\nResearch Design\nA qualitative research design was employed to explore what\nfactors or circumstances throughout their lives are considered\nRodin and Stewart 3\nby older individuals, who had coped successfully with prior\nCM, to have contributed to their resilience. A qualitative\napproach was considered to be most useful in this context to\nunderstand the experience and perceptions of such individuals\nwith regard to aging, and the factors they attributed to their\nresiliency. Interview methodology of this kind generates undi-\nluted, in-depth narratives (McKague & Verhoef, 2003), which\nmay reveal novel information about the study variables,\nwhich could not be elicited by predetermined qualitative mea-\nsures. Interviews also allow researchers to probe for clarifica-\ntions on unique perspectives and experiences on potentially\nsensitive issues. All interviews were digitally recorded and\ntranscribed. This project received ethics approval from the\nUniversity Health Network Research Ethics Board (Toronto,\nOntario, Canada).\nResearch Methods\nPurposive and homogeneous sampling criteria were used to\nrecruit men and women above the age of 65 living in\nToronto, Canada, with a past history of CM, and who were\njudged by their health care professionals to be remarkably\nresilient. As the frequency of exposure to CM is comparable\nin both sexes, (Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics, 2007),\nwe sought to include men and women in our sample.\nExclusion criteria included a history of any psychiatric ill-\nness. Ten health care workers (physicians and social work-\ners) at a large university teaching hospital were approached\nto recommend patients in their practice who met study crite-\nria and who could be invited to participate. Most elderly\npeople have fairly regular contact with the health care sys-\ntem and have built relationships with their health care pro-\nviders over many years. The health care workers may be\naware of their past history of abuse and, being aware of their\nphysical and mental functioning, could assess their patients'\nresilience. Although resilience has been defined differently\nthroughout the literature, this article adopted the definition\nof resilience suggested by Cicchetti and Garmezy (1993) as\npositive adaptation, despite exposure to adversity.\nHealth care professionals contacted potential participants\nto request participation in the study and their willingness to\nallow their contact information to be shared with the study\ninvestigator. Recruitment was continued until saturation of the\nthemes was achieved. In qualitative data, it has been noted that\n\"five to eight data sources of sampling units will often suffice\nAll participants who granted permission to their health\ncare professional to be identified were contacted by the first\nauthor and explained the purpose, methodology, and require-\nments of the study. Participants provided written, informed\nconsent to participate in the study and to audiotape the inter-\nview. All potential participants who agreed to be contacted\nregarding participation in the study provided such consent\nand completed the interviews.\nMeasurementTools\nIn-depth, semistructured interviews of 60 to 90 min in dura-\ntion focused on the meaning, perception, and experience of\nresilience and resilient processes throughout their lives fol-\nlowing exposure to CM. Specific strategies were used to\nenhance the rigor of data collection, including the use of an\ninterview guide with probes to elucidate emerging themes\nand concepts, digital recording, and field notes.\nAnalysis\nQualitative data were organized and analyzed in iterative\nphases of discovery, coding, and discounting using NVivo.\nThe analytic technique of constant comparison was applied\nwithin and between interviews to refine the analysis (Taylor\n& Bogdan, 1998). This technique involves open coding of\ntranscripts and field notes and grouping segments of text\ninto categories and subcategories.\nStatements by participants were compared for similarities\nunder a theme and/or a concept within and between inter-\nviews. Constant comparison led to collapse and/or expansion\nof the earlier categories. Analytic induction through an\nemphasis on the search for negative cases allowed for testing\nof emergent hypotheses. This methodology enhanced the\ntransferability of the findings, despite the small number of\nstudied cases, and helped to move the analysis from descrip-\ntion to interpretation.\nResults\nA total of five women and four men were recruited for this\nstudy, which allowed for a clear saturation level of the\nthemes to emerge. The demographics of the study popula-\ntion are presented in Table 1, with pseudonyms used to refer\nto the participants in the remainder of this article.\nThe interviews elicited rich histories of the lives of nine\nremarkable individuals who have successfully overcome\nCM and flourished in old age. These individuals varied in\nage (ranging from 67 to 90 years old), education level, and\nreligion. They all experienced CM, although it varied in\nnature and included physical abuse, emotional abuse,\nneglect, and exposure to violence between their parents.\nNone of the respondents reported sexual abuse. In addition,\nmore than half of the respondents shared the experience of\nliving through hardships associated with World War II, in\nwhich they lost loved ones, experienced scarcity and hunger,\nand lived in fear for their safety. This additional trauma,\nwhich we had not anticipated on recruitment, added to the\nremarkable history of this group.\nEach participant became emotionally distraught when\ndescribing his or her CM maltreatment and how he or she\nbelieved it affected him or her. However, they were all able\nto reflect on their childhood with insight and describe how\n4 SAGE Open\nthey traversed and survived this difficult period. Participants\nretained a sense of perspective and even humor about their\npast and present situations. They also often displayed play-\nfulness in their responses to questions. When Michael, who\nhad advanced lymphoma, was asked whether he found it\nhelpful to make future plans, he chuckled and said, \"I don't\nplan anymore, they're planning for me!\"\nThis article will focus on the most prominent contributors\nto resilience that were identified as these individuals moved\nthrough the life cycle to old age. Certain gender differences\nwere notable, in that the women emphasized relationships\nand social interactions, whereas the men tended to place\ngreater emphasis on solitary activities. The participants\nthemselves also commented on the differences in resilience\nthat they perceived between men and women. Janis said that\nshe believed that, \"probably the majority of women look to\nother women for support, whereas men are not supposed to\nlook outside for help.\" Sam seemed to agree with Janis's line\nof thinking when he said:\nWomen are too emotional. Gets 'em into trouble, like\nmy wife. Too much talk, talk, talk. Guys play sports or\ntake a hike, walk the dog. It's better. Action oriented.\nDespite some gender differences, respondents identified\nsix broad themes as major contributors to resilience in the\nface of prior trauma and in coping with the new challenges of\nold age: social support, psychological attributes, financial\nsecurity, health, spirituality, and engagement. Most partici-\npants referred to these themes in their responses, but the\ntheme of engagement in their present life was most consis-\ntently identified as important by the study participants.\nAll participants reported the experience of meaningful\nsocial support during their childhood and in their adult life,\neven during the period of CM. The theme of social support\nemerged in their description of their relationships with their\nown parents, romantic relationships and partnerships, teach-\ners, social networks and interactions, community integra-\ntion, and in a sense of belonging. Many described childhood\nsupport as molding their sense of resilience in adulthood.\nHarriet, whose mother died when she was aged 4, describes\nthe perceived effect of her mother's nurturing:\nI think the reason that I survived and that I seem to be\ncomparatively normal and stable and I managed to not\nhave any mental problems and to try and deal with my\nbackground is that my mother, she was an orphan her-\nself, was very beautiful and a very loving mother. She\nalways, apparently from what I hear, took wonderful\ncare of us. She sewed clothes for us and knitted and\nwas very, very attentive, so I think being loved like\nthat until the age of about three and a half was a tre-\nmendous thing. I think it's something that . . . if a child\nhad this at a young age, it can carry them through life.\nBecause people experience more losses of loved ones as\nthey age, the sources of support can take different forms.\nSam identified his dogs as his major source of comfort and\nresilience:\nI've always had a dog, usually a German shepherd,\never since I was a kid. I talk to my dog and he, or\nsometimes it was a she, always understood. You know\nthey love you no matter what, and that counts for a lot.\nTable 1.

You know I have a wife who is support-\nive, but not as supportive as my dog--don't tell\nher that!\nMany of the participants described psychological attri-\nbutes that they believed allowed them to be more resilient\nthan many of their peers, as they entered old age. These\nincluded adaptive coping styles, inner strength, a positive\nattitude, self-esteem, optimism, and acceptance of aging.\nHarriet described the importance of inner strength and being\nable to maintain a satisfying \"inner life.\" She described what\nresilience meant and continues to mean to her:\nI think what resilience means to me is inner strength\nand the ability to stand on your own two feet and deal\nwith things, not to lean on other people for support all\nthe time, not to be helpless. I've always been very\nindependent, I do all my own gardening, my husband\nis very busy, so I sort of do all the mending and repair\nthings and fix things. I do the sort of man's work\naround the house and I'm a woman, so I am sort of\nindependent.\nFinancial security was vital for many of the participants.\nFor example, Ruth, a housewife turned medical historian in\nher later life, discussed how her financial security allows her\nto concentrate her energies in areas that give her personal\nsatisfaction. For the past 8 years, Ruth had been writing a\nmedical biography, which involved extensive travel.\nReferring to the support that her husband is able to provide,\nshe explained,\nAs long as we keep putting one foot in front of the\nother and we have enough money to pay the mortgage,\nwe (can) be supportive of one another's projects. I\ndon't mean million dollar projects, but the fact is that\nit cost money to do the book I did because I had to go\nto Africa.\nThe participants in this study were still relatively healthy\nand were able to successfully carry out most of their activi-\nties of daily living without assistance. However, many of the\nparticipants expressed wariness regarding the possibility of\nfuture physical limitations. Gordon, a retired physician who\nexperienced abandonment as a child, described his concerns\nas follows:\nWell my eyesight is going and that worries me because\nso many of the things I enjoy doing I need my eyes for\nand I've only got one of them now. So I do worry\nabout if the other one goes. I go out of my way to be\nreasonably good with electronic gadgets and things, so\nthat I would be able to move onto portable books and\nthings like this . . . But that scares me. I would find it\ndifficult if I really lose my eyesight. And, you know,\nmy eye doctors can't tell me.\nSome of the other participants had already experienced\nsignificant health challenges. However, many explained that\nthis gave them a greater appreciation for the time they have\nleft. Harriet had already suffered from breast cancer and,\nmore recently, an acute dissecting aortic aneurysm. She\ndescribed her feelings surrounding these events:\nMiraculously, absolutely miraculously, I survived with\nall my mental faculties intact . . . And I'm at a pretty\nwonderful stage in my life and I'm so thankful for\nevery day that I have with my husband and children\nand grandchildren . . . I have great hope and faith that\nI will live for another 5 or more years, so I still have\ngreat hope for the future.\nThe importance of organized religion was dismissed by\nmany of the participants. However, the idea of spirituality\nand maintaining a belief in a higher power was identified as\nimportant for some. Harriet discussed the importance of faith\nin maintaining resilience as she aged: \"I think I've often\nprayed and found my prayers were answered, which is amaz-\ning.\" Others, who conveyed a more ambiguous view of the\nform that faith should take, still found it valuable. When\nasked whether faith helped him cope, Michael, a Holocaust\nsurvivor who spent his teenage years in Auschwitz, replied,\n\"Yes, you have to believe in something. Whether it's true or\nnot. If you don't believe in anything, you're a lost person.\nYou have to believe in something.\"\nEngagement in relationships and valued activities was a\ntheme that most strongly emerged throughout the interviews\nas the most salient factor in maintaining and promoting resil-\nience in this group of individuals. Engagement in meaning-\nful or challenging activities was emphasized by all of the\nparticipants as vital to their sense of resilience as they aged.\nAs this theme has received little previous attention in the lit-\nerature, we explored it in further detail in our analysis. This\ntheme was expanded and reorganized as the interviews pro-\ngressed and the subthemes began to take form. Engagement\nwas conceptualized through the following five domains:\n(a) engagement in valued activities, (b) generative identity,\n(c) maintaining competence, (d) personal life investment,\nand (e) desire to learn.\nEngagement inValued Activities\nAs they entered old age, many individuals struggled with the\nloss of loved ones, most often friends or a partner. One par-\nticipant, Janis, who was emotionally abused and abandoned\nby her mother as a child, lost a much loved son when she\nwas middle-aged. She had built a new life with her husband\nand raised her children, but was devastated when one of\nher sons died tragically as a young adult in a hit-and-run\n6 SAGE Open\naccident caused by a drunk driver. Janis found that engage-\nment in valued activities was a vital way for her to channel\nher emotions into energy that could benefit others and main-\ntain her resilience in the face of this new traumatic experi-\nence. She talked about many of the resilient women whom\nshe met at Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), but it\nwas apparent that Janis is most certainly one of these women\nherself:\nWell I've been volunteering for MADD for many\nyears and if you want a group of people who are resil-\nient, there are just so many who have had to deal with\nlosing family members and doing something about it.\nI know a lot of people who have gone on to do really\namazing things after losing a child. You know, like I\nhave, become involved in MADD.\nGenerative Identity\nDebra was a successful health administrator throughout her\nadult life. She talked about how success in her career played\na large role in her resilience throughout her adult life. As she\nhas grown older, however, she discussed how she derived\nsignificant satisfaction and strength from mentoring others\nin her field, particularly women:\nI was very good at what I did and became internation-\nally known. I felt I was really contributing and people\nliked me. Now that I'm pretty much retired, I still keep\nactive in my profession--it feels good. I sit on advi-\nsory boards, advise junior people and research widely\nin my field. I enjoy seeing so many successful woman\nas it was very sexist in my day. We prevailed against\ntremendous odds.\nJanis also talked about how it was important for her own\nresilience to be able to continue to teach others about issues\nto which she has dedicated much of her adult life. She spent\nmuch of her working life on advocacy surrounding drunk\ndriving, and described how she believes it continues to help\nher deal with tragedies in her past and to feel engaged in the\nfuture. She explains, \"I go and talk to high school students.\nIt's a tough thing to do, but it's very cathartic, being able to\ndo that.\"\nMaintaining Competence\nMichael arrived in Canada penniless with his young family.\nHe talked about the pressures he felt to start working imme-\ndiately and earn a living. He had spent some time working\nwith a tailor as an afterschool job when he lived in Eastern\nEurope, so he decided to open up a tailoring business. He\ndescribed the importance that maintaining his competence\nhas had for his happiness and resilience as he aged. Like\nmany of the participants, he has faced some limitations in\nhis functioning as he has grown older, but has learned to\nadapt to many of these challenges. To this point, Michael\nexplained,\nI was in the tailoring business and, not to brag about\nit, but I had a partner and we were the best tailors in\ntown. I couldn't make a whole garment anymore, but\nI can do an alteration, shorten a pair of pants or put on\na button. Now I do my profession as a hobby.\nMichael also stressed the importance of knowing when to\nask for help as he aged and to continue to be able to care for\nhimself. He said, \"I have confidence in myself. If I get help,\nit's even better, but if not, I have confidence that I can help\nmyself.\" He talked about how it was important for him to\ncontinue living in his house and to take care of maintenance\nwork around the house and the garden, as long as he is able\nto do so.\nPersonal Life Investment\nIrene is a Jewish Polish woman who survived the Holocaust\nby escaping to Russia with her family. She immigrated to\nNorth America in her early 20s with her husband and twin\ninfant sons. She described the determination that she and her\nhusband had to carve out a life for themselves and for their\nchildren, which they were deprived of in Europe. This\nbecame a major goal for Irene through much of her adult\nlife. She explained,\nI look now at what we went through and I can't\nbelieve we survived. I worked hard here, plus my hus-\nband worked, so that my kids have a good education,\nso that they have what we missed out on.\nWhen Irene was in her 50s, her husband suffered a major\nstroke. Caring for her husband and maintaining their home\nbecame a personal life investment for Irene that gave her a\nsense of meaning and purpose throughout her old age, even\nafter her children left the home. She boasted that when she\ngoes to her family doctor, he says to her, \"Irene, you're\namazing. If not for you, your husband wouldn't be here any-\nmore.\" \"It means a lot to me,\" she explained.\nGordon discussed how it has been important to develop\nhimself in different and more creative ways since his retire-\nment. He led a busy practice as a physician and now, in his\nlater life, has spent time on other hobbies and personal pas-\nsions. He described how setting firm goals for himself has\nhelped him to remain resilient as he aged:\nYou know, whatever, whether it's studying medicine,\nor whether it's writing a book, or building a house, or\nat the moment, doing my family tree and learning\nSpanish. I like setting myself a fairly concrete kind of\ngoal and I'm a bit rigid about it.\nRodin and Stewart 7\nDesire to Learn\nMorris worked as a medical sociologist and a professor for\nmany years, and described how he found his continued\ninvolvement in academic work to be very therapeutic. He\ndiscussed how his early life was profoundly transformed by\nhis access to books and institutions of higher learning:\nAt the end of the war, I was very fortunate in getting\naccess to university, which quite surprised me. So\nwhen I found myself in university, it opened up a\nwhole world . . . it was really quite a different world.\nIt was a world of learning and scholarship and I flour-\nished. I don't think I would have done as well if I\nhadn't gone to university . . . It gave me new perspec-\ntives, new opportunities, new friendships, access to\nvalues and ideas that had never occurred to me.\nMorris talked at length about his career as a professor and\nhis research. When asked about how his retirement from uni-\nversity life had affected him, he exclaimed, \"No, I'm really\nblessed because now I don't have to mark papers!\" He\nexplained how he still maintained a voracious appetite for\nlearning and scholarship and that this has kept him fulfilled\nthroughout his old age. He found that his desire to learn con-\ntinued to give him an outlet for intellectual development,\ndespite the challenges inherent in growing older:\nI wake up in the morning and feel a great joy that I can\nspend a whole day on whatever the project is that I'm\nworking on. I feel incredibly fortunate. My wife died\nabout 14 years ago of cancer, but before she died, she\nsaid something interesting that surprised me. She said\nshe was glad she was going first. She didn't really\nwant to be a widow for years and years and years. And\nI thought, that's very interesting. The notion of ending\nup as a widow was a bother to her. She was a Scot and\na very independent woman. Now I didn't feel that\nbecause I still have a tremendous joy in getting up in\nthe morning and reading and arguing and writing. If\nyou had said to me 50 years ago that I won't have to\ngo to work, I can read any book I want, I can get any\ndocument I want from the library, I would have\nthought that was absolutely crazy. But that's what I do.\nAnd I can't tell you what a tremendous joy that is.\nDiscussion\nAlthough most of the previous resilience literature has\nfocused on children and adolescents, our findings demon-\nstrate that resilience may be very evident in later life, despite\nearlier life trauma and the subsequent challenges of old age.\nThe positive outlook, strong will, and effective coping abili-\nties of these individuals were pervasive throughout the inter-\nviews.\nIt is clear from the resilience literature and the data of our\nstudy that psychological factors, economic stability, and\nsocial support play major roles in enhancing resilience in\nolder individuals. All of our participants reported significant\nsocial support in their developmental years that may have\ncontributed to their self-esteem and capacity for engagement\nin later life. Although all valued the support of others, they\nregarded their own competence and mastery as central to\ntheir resilience. Religion or spirituality also was considered\nby some but not all of the participants in this study to play an\nimportant role in their resilience.\nWhat stood out in our interviews with these exceptionally\nresilient individuals was the importance that they gave to\ntheir intellectual life and valued activities, many of which\nrelated to their previous work and interests. Their desire to\nlearn and potential for growth remained very strong and inte-\ngral to their resilience as they aged. They were fully engaged\nin social, community, and intellectual life and remained psy-\nchologically optimistic, despite sometimes life-threatening\nmedical problems. These participants responded to their dif-\nficult childhoods of abuse, maltreatment, and deprivation,\nand to the subsequent challenges inherent in old age by\nengaging in life more fully and pursuing goals, hobbies, and\nactivities.\nThese findings reinforce and add to earlier work on resil-\nience in the elderly and are consistent with Erikson's sugges-\ntion that continuing psychological development across the\nlife span provides the basis for a resilient self and the accrual\nof wisdom by later life (Erikson, 1963). He also emphasized\n\"generativity\" or a concern for establishing and guiding the\nnext generation as a central step in the successful transition\nin life to the final stage of integrity, consistent with the obser-\nvations of several of our participants. Masten (1994) sug-\ngested that resilience be viewed as the ability to maintain\ncompetence across the life span.\nWe found that specific psychological characteristics, par-\nticularly those associated with self-reliance and the flexible\nuse of supportive relationships, were emphasized by the par-\nticipants in our study as contributing to their resilience.\nThese findings are consistent with an empirical analysis of a\nlarge representative sample of older individuals in the United\nKingdom. That study led to the elucidation of a higher order\nmodel that incorporates interpersonal control, self-esteem,\nand personal competence as most useful in understanding\npsychological resilience in old age (Windle et al., 2008).\nMore recently, a study of elderly Holocaust survivors found\nthat taking up a purpose and maintaining competence was\nessential to resilience in old age in individuals who had ear-\nlier experienced adversity (Greene & Graham, 2009).\nLimitations\nThere are some limitations to our study. The sample, which\nconsisted of middle- to upper income Caucasians of European\norigin who were all recruited from a university teaching hos-\npital in a large urban center, is not fully representative of the\n8 SAGE Open\npopulation of survivors of CM. Therefore, our findings may\nnot be generalizable to other racial or cultural groups, or other\nsettings. The sample was specifically selected for \"remarkable\nresilience\" and thus may not be representative of resilience in\nthe general population of older individuals who have been\nexposed to CM.\nConclusion\nOur findings point to the importance of inner strength, social\nrelatedness, and the ongoing motivation to engage and to\nlearn as important contributors to resilience. Supporting these\nqualities in elderly individuals in the community may help to\nbolster their resilience and capacity to function autono-\nmously. Retirement homes, nursing homes, and community\ncenters could help their clients flourish or at least maintain\ntheir functioning by supporting their capacity for indepen-\ndent functioning and by promoting creative engagement in\nvalued activities. These activities not only reflect resilience,\nbut also reinforce it socially, psychologically, and physically.\nCreative expression promotes heightened sense of personal\ncontrol, and encourages individual expression as well as\nsocial connectedness. It may even promote the preservation\nof cognitive functioning (McFadden & Basting, 2010).\nThe \"paradox of well-being,\" in which elderly individuals\nfeel satisfaction with their lives, despite the loss of loved\nones, the discomforts of illness, and the growing limitations\nin physical functioning, was elegantly demonstrated by the\nparticipants in this study. Their perspectives and insights\nabout their experience with successful aging are inspiring\nand encourage us to consider whether the possibilities and\nbenefits from creative engagement in older age can contrib-\nute to a shift in our understanding and expectations of indi-\nviduals at this life stage.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe authors received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAffifi, T.
