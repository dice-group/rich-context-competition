There has been an escalation\nin the proportion of the population that is\nconsidered to be in old age (or as elderly\npeople), defined as being !65 years: a rise\nAlthough spinal anaesthesia provides\nsome advantages for elderly people com-\npared with general anaesthesia, it may still\nhave some critical disadvantages. For exam-\nple, early mobilization during the post-\noperative period, a minimal number of\nrespiratory complications, continuity of\nanalgesia and short hospitalization time\nare among the advantages of spinal anaes-\nthesia compared with general anaesthesia,\nbut hypotension and bradycardia are the\ntwo major disadvantages associated with\nspinal anaesthesia.2\u00ad6\nSpinal anaesthesia is frequently used\nduring urological operations because it\nprovides some major advantages over gen-\neral anaesthesia, such as a shorter time to\nonset of motor block, and it allows for the\nuse of lower volumes of local anaes-\nthetic.6,7 Although there is a degree of\nhypotension risk associated with spinal\nanaesthesia, it enables early detection of\nexcessive fluid load and hyponatraemia.3\nEffective spinal anaesthesia is possible with\nthe correct choice of local anaesthetic.\nSuitable local anaesthetics should provide\neffective anaesthesia and analgesia during\nthe operation and should have no side\neffects. Levobupivacaine is a local anaes-\nthetic that is relatively new to clinical\npractice.8\u00ad10 Levobupivacaine is an S(\u00c0)\nenantiomer of bupivacaine and both agents\nhave similar pharmacokinetic proper-\nties.8\u00ad10 There are several studies that\nhave reported that the cardiovascular and\ncentral nervous system-related side effects\nof levobupivacaine are less frequent than\nthose experienced with bupivacaine.8\u00ad10\nSome toxic effects can be seen with high\ndoses of bupivacaine and when it is used\nfor a long duration.8\u00ad10 Based on these\nreports,8\u00ad10 levobupivacaine is recom-\nmended as an alternative to bupivacaine\nfor patients who experience cardiovascular\nsystem-related side effects. However, it has\nbeen emphasized that more studies must be\nconducted to investigate the effects of\nlevobupivacaine in detail.8\u00ad10 Despite the\nfact that levobupivacaine has been widely\nused for obstetric and nonobstetric epi-\ndural anaesthesia,8 there is still a lack of\ncomparative clinical studies that focus on\nintrathecal levobupivacaine administration.\nThis study aimed to compare these two\nintrathecal anaesthetics, bupivacaine and\nlevobupivacaine, for their effects on motor\nand sensory blockade and haemodynamics\nin patients aged !65 years who underwent\nspinal anaesthesia during transurethral\nresection of the prostate (TUR-P) or trans-\nurethral resection of the urinary bladder\n(TUR-M) operations.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nThis randomized study enrolled patients\nwho underwent TUR-P or TUR-M oper-\nations under spinal anaesthesia between\nDepartment of Anaesthesiology and\nReanimation, Faculty of Medicine,\nAkdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey.\nPatients aged !65 years with American\nSociety of Anesthesiologists physical status\n2\u00ad3 were included in the study.11 Patients\nwho were allergic to local anaesthetic agents\nwere excluded from the study.\nThe study was approved by the Akdeniz\nUniversity Ethics Committee of the\nEthics-497). Written consent was obtained\nfrom each patient to receive anaesthesia\nand verbal consent was obtained from\neach patient before anaesthesia was\nadministered.\nAnaesthesia and surgical procedures\nAll patients were closely monitored through-\nout the procedure. The monitoring included\nelectrocardiography, noninvasive blood\npressure monitoring and peripheral oxygen\nsaturation measurements. Using a sealed\nenvelope technique, the patients were ran-\ndomly allocated to receive either bupiva-\ncaine (Marcaine\u00d5 Spinal 0.5% Heavy;\nAstraZeneca, London, UK) or levobupiva-\ncaine (Chirocaine\u00d5, 0.5%; Abbott\nLaboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) for\nspinal anaesthesia. A 25 G spinal needle\n(Spinocan\u00d5; B Braun, Melsungen,\nGermany) was inserted, and after clear\ncerebrospinal fluid became visible, one of\nthese two solutions was injected into the\nhyperbaric bupivacaine or 3 ml (15 mg)\n0.5% isobaric levobupivacaine. In order to\nreduce the risk of hypotension, intravenous\npatients who were administered either levo-\nbupivacaine or bupivacaine. Following pre-\nhydration, saline infusion (0.9% NaCl at\n4 ml/kg per h) was continued until the end of\nthe operation.\nThe TUR-P and TUR-M procedures\nwere undertaken to allow the resection of\nprostate or bladder lesions and they were\ncarried out in the lithotomy position. The\nanaesthetist (D.G.) was blinded to the drugs\nused for spinal anaesthesia.\nClinical assessments\nThe starting time for all of the evaluations\nwas set as the time when administration of\nthe intrathecal anaesthetic injection was\ncompleted. Time to onset of sensory block,\ntime to the onset of the maximum level of\nsensory block, and the time and duration of\nachieving the maximum level of sensory\nblock were recorded. The same variables\nwere measured for motor block. Every 30 s\nafter the intrathecal injection, the levels of\nsensory and motor block were recorded. A\nscoring system was used for recording the\nextent of sensory blockade based on the\nintrathecal anaesthetic injection and imme-\ndiately after the operation was completed\n(Table 1). The extent of motor block can be\nassessed using the Bromage scale at the same\ntime-points.12 The Bromage scale defines no\nmotor block as the full ability to flex the\nknees and feet (score 0); partial motor block\nas the ability to flex the knees and resist\ngravity with full movement of the feet (score\n1); almost complete motor block as the\ninability to flex the knees but retained ability\nto flex the feet (score 2); and complete motor\nblock as the inability to move the legs or feet\n(score 3).\nSystolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic\nblood pressure (DBP), mean blood pressure\n(MBP), heart rate and peripheral oxygen\nsaturation were measured before the oper-\nation, immediately after the intrathecal\nanaesthetic injection and immediately after\nthe operation was completed.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version 11.0\nTable 1. Scoring system for record-\ning the extent of sensory blockade\nbased on the sensory dermatomes.\nSensory dermatomes Score\nT, thoracic.\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. The sample size was calculated\nfor the power of this study being 50% (effect\nsize was based on a pilot study of four\npatients in whom changes in heart rate and\nblood pressure after drug administration\nwere observed). The two groups were com-\npared using Student's t-test when there was\nnormal distribution of the data and Mann\u00ad\nWhitney U-test was used for the rest of the\nvariables. 2-test was used to compare cat-\negorical variables. Paired t-test was used for\nintergroup comparisons and for variables\ncomplying with normal distribution.\nWilcoxon's test was used for the rest of the\nvariables. A P-value <0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant.\nResults\nEnrolled patients who did not accept spinal\nanaesthesia and patients who underwent\ngeneral anaesthesia because of unsuccessful\nspinal anaesthesia were excluded from the\nanalysis. The study thus included 100 ran-\nlevobupivacaine) and 43 to group B (0.5%\nbupivacaine). The demographic and clinical\ncharacteristics of the study participants are\nshown in Table 2. There were no statistically\nsignificant between-group differences in age,\nweight, operation duration, sex, and the\nproportion of patients that underwent\neither TUR-P or TUR-M.\nThere was no significant difference in the\ntime to onset of sensory block between the\ntwo groups (Table 3). There was no signifi-\ncant difference in the time to onset of\nmaximum sensory block between the two\ngroups. The duration of two segment regres-\nsion of the sensory block was signifi-\ncantly lower in group B (bupivacaine)\ncompared with group L (levobupivacaine)\nregressed more rapidly in group B (bupiva-\ncaine) compared with group L (levobupiva-\ncaine).

In group B (bupivacaine), SBP\ndecreased until 20 min after the intrathecal\nanaesthetic injection and then remained at a\nrelatively stable level to the end of the\noperation. DBP and MBP changes showed\nsimilar changes as those described for the\nSBP for both of the study groups (data not\nshown). There were no significant differ-\nences in the changes in heart rate between\nthe two groups during the course of the\nobservations.\nDiscussion\nIn this present study spinal anaesthesia was\nadministered to patients aged !65 years who\nwere scheduled to have elective TUR-P and\nTUR-M operations. The effects of two\nroutinely used spinal anaesthetics, 0.5%\nisobaric levobupivacaine and 0.5% hyper-\nbaric bupivacaine, on motor and sensory\nblock as well as on haemodynamic param-\neters were compared. In terms of sensory\nblockade in the current study, the duration\nof two segment regression of the sensory\nblock was significantly lower with bupiva-\ncaine compared with levobupivacaine; the\nsensory block score immediately after the\noperation was completed was significantly\nlower with levobupivacaine compared with\nbupivacaine. In terms of motor blockade in\nthe current study, levobupivacaine was\nassociated with significantly longer times to\nonset of motor block and maximum motor\nblock compared with bupivacaine; the\nmotor block scores for levobupivacaine at\n5\u00ad45 min after intrathecal injection were\nsignificantly lower compared with those for\nbupivacaine. In this present study, levobu-\npivacaine resulted in slow changes in SBP\nand SBP was not observed to decrease\nuntil 5 min after intrathecal injection.\nBupivacaine was also associated with a\ndecrease in SBP that was first observed at\n5 min after intrathecal injection and SBP\ncontinued to decrease until 20 min after\nintrathecal injection. Bupivacaine anaesthe-\nsia was associated with significant differ-\nand 30 min and at the end of the operation\ncompared with the preoperative SBP.\nA prospective randomized double-blind\nstudy that compared the anaesthetic and\nhaemodynamic effects of intrathecal levobu-\npivacaine and bupivacaine demonstrated\nthat levobupivacaine provided a faster\nincrease in the Bromage score from 0 to 2\ncompared with bupivacaine, but there were\nno significant differences observed in any of\nthe haemodynamic characteristics.13 In con-\ntrast to these findings,13 the present study\nshowed that the time to onset of motor\nblock was significantly faster with bupiva-\ncaine compared with levobupivacaine.\nSimilarly, the time to onset of maximum\nmotor block was significantly faster with\nbupivacaine compared with levobupivacaine\nin the present study.\nIn a study of intrathecally administered\npatients who were scheduled to undergo\nelective lower extremity surgeries, it was\nobserved that the mean time to onset of\nsensory block was 3 min (range 2\u00ad10 min)\nand the mean time to onset of motor block\nstudy, the time to onset of sensory block and\nthe time to onset motor block in patients\ntreated with levobupivacaine were higher\nthan in patients treated with bupivacaine. A\nrandomized, double-blind study of spinal\nanaesthesia in 60 patients undergoing ingu-\ninal hernia repair that compared 8 mg hyper-\nbaric 0.5% bupivacaine, 8 mg hyperbaric\n0.5% levobupivacaine and 12 mg hyperbaric\n0.5% ropivacaine found that the onset time\nand intraoperative efficacy of levobupiva-\ncaine and bupivacaine were similar.15 In this\npresent study of 15 mg hyperbaric bupiva-\ncaine compared with 15 mg isobaric levobu-\npivacaine in patients undergoing TUR-P\nand TUR-M operations, the time to onset of\nmotor block was significantly longer for\npatients treated with levobupivacaine and\nthe motor block score only reached levels\ncomparable with those of bupivacaine at\n60 min after intrathecal injection.\nIn terms of haemodynamic parameters, a\ncomparative study of healthy volunteers\nwho were administered intravenous injec-\ntions of levobupivacaine and bupivacaine\nreported that compared with their baseline\nvalues, both the stroke index and ejection\nfraction decreases were significantly smaller\nfor levobupivacaine than bupivacaine; there\nwas a smaller degree of prolongation in the\nPR interval with levobupivacaine than\nbupivacaine, but the difference was not\nstatistically significant.16 Hypotension is a\nvery frequent side effect after spinal anaes-\nthesia and it may cause serious increases\nin morbidity: it can even lead to mortal-\nprehydration with 0.9% NaCl was given to\nall patients and saline infusions (0.9% NaCl\nat 4 ml/kg per h) were continued until the\nend of the operation; and there were no\ncases of hypotension that required intraven-\nous ephedrine treatment.\nIt has been shown that the sympathetic\nnervous system-related side effects of levo-\nbupivacaine are less frequent than those\nassociated with the use of bupivacaine and\nthe mean convulsive dose for levobupiva-\ncaine is higher than that of bupivacaine.19,20\nPrevious animal studies reported that the\npossibility of causing convulsions or apnoea\nwas lower with levobupivacaine than bupi-\nvacaine.19,21 Whereas several cases of central\nnervous system toxicity have been reported\nafter intravascular injection of ropivacaine\nand levobupivacaine, no cases of serious\ncardiotoxicity or death have been reported\nin the literature.22\u00ad24 The clinical outcomes\nof levobupivacaine in children who under-\nwent spinal anaesthesia were similar to\nthose achieved with the same dose of\nA randomized, double-blind study of\nintrathecally administered 0.5% isobaric\nlevobupivacaine or 0.5% hyperbaric bupi-\nvacaine in 70 patients scheduled to\nundergo elective transurethral endoscopic\nsurgery found similar results between the\ntwo groups for the following variables:\nduration of sensory block, duration of\ntwo segment regression, time of onset and\nexpiration of motor block, side effects, and\npain scores at the beginning of the oper-\nation.26 The authors suggested that 2.5 ml\nof 0.5% isobaric levobupivacaine and\n0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine provided the\nsame clinical outcomes for spinal\nIn this present study, there were no\nsignificant differences between levobupiva-\ncaine and bupivacaine in terms of the sen-\nsory block scores following intrathecal\ninjection. A prospective, randomized,\ndouble-blind study conducted in 50 patients\nwho underwent urogenital surgery found no\nstatistically significant differences in the\nsensory and motor block properties, as\nwell as the haemodynamic effects, of 0.5%\nlevobupivacaine and 0.5% bupivacaine; the\nauthors suggested that levobupivacaine\nwas an effective substitute for 0.5% bupiva-\ncaine.27 Although animal research has\ndemonstrated that the duration of sen-\nsory and motor block was similar for\nlevobupivacaine and bupivacaine,19 there\nis some evidence of a small increase in\nduration of sensory block with levobupiva-\ncaine.8 In contrast, there is also evidence\nthat levobupivacaine is less potent than\nThe sensory blocking effects of bupiva-\ncaine and levobupivacaine were similar\naccording to these current findings. In the\nbupivacaine group, there was a relatively\nrapid regression of the sensory block level\nalthough the differences between time-\npoints were not significant. Some clinical\nstudies suggest that the local anaesthetic\neffects of levobupivacaine are different from\nthose of bupivacaine. For example, in\nstudies in patients undergoing caesarean\nsection, intrathecal levobupivacaine was\nshown to have a similar clinical profile as\nbupivacaine, but it provided a lower level of\nhemodynamic stability with a reduced\nprevalence of side effects has been shown\nfor intrathecal levobupivacaine in elderly\nIn this present study, the haemodynamic,\nsensory and motor block effects of intra-\nthecal levobupivacaine and bupivacaine\ninjections were compared in 100 patients\n!65 years of age undergoing either TUR-P\nor TUR-M operations. Levobupivacaine\ndid not cause any significant changes in\nhaemodynamic parameters, and showed a\nsimilar sensory block onset time compared\nwith bupivacaine, but it had a significantly\nlonger motor block onset time compared\nwith bupivacaine.\nA limitation of the present study is the\nsmall number of patients in the groups.\nFurther studies should be undertaken with a\nlarge number of patients to confirm the\nfindings.\nIn conclusion, these current findings\nsuggest that levobupivacaine can be used\nas a substitute for bupivacaine for spinal\nanaesthesia in elderly patients !65 years\nof age undergoing elective TUR-P\nor TUR-M operations. In our opin-\nion, hyperbaric bupivacaine is the pre-\nferred option for operations of short\nduration.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
