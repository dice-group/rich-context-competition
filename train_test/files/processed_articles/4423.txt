This study focuses specifically on advising\naccountability of management education to explore how faculty advisors communicate with their student advisees using\ninstant messaging (IM) to enhance advising presence primarily based on Tetlock's social contingency model. The dependent\nrelationships between advisor and advisee are considered a cohort, and their collaboration as a community of practice. Of\nthe 254 graduate students in the college of management, the result reveals that their perception of advising accountability\nhas been casually explained by the antecedents, that is, self-efficacy, advising presence, epistemic engagement, advisor\ncredibility, and their flow experience toward using IM to communicate with their thesis advisors. The research finding\nvalidates intervening factors between students' perception of IM self-efficacy and advising accountability of thesis advisors.\nThe findings, regardless of the limited generalization, provide prescriptive implications that educational practitioners can use\nto evaluate related issues of advising accountability.\n",

Faculty members in higher education\nhave faced challenges of academic accountability regarding\nthe three-facet quality assurance: teaching, research, and stu-\ndent advising. The abovementioned academic accountability\nis closely interdependent with each other.Academic account-\nability, relating to teaching and learning specifically, has\nbeen addressed and examined through multiple perspectives.\nBecause teaching and learning are reciprocal processes, the\nfaculty tends to be the party that is held most accountable for\ndiscussed the amount of time that the faculty members, who\nmight be overworked, spent on advising, who they advised,\nand the types of activities involved in advising. Maxwell and\nSmyth (2010) re-conceptualized thesis supervision and\nadvising as a research project by accounting for three inter-\nrelated areas: (a) the learning and teaching process, (b) pre-\nparing students, and (c) producing research outcomes as a\nsocial practice. When thesis advising, academic advisors\nsupervise not only graduate students who are writing theses\nand dissertations to complete their master's or doctoral\ndegrees but also mentor them in career planning during their\ninteractions.\nDue to professionalism and obligations, efficiency and\neffectiveness of the issues are highly dependent on the\nsophisticated use of information and community technolo-\ngies (ICTs). Exploiting ICT-supported communication tools\nhas become undoubtedly vital for managing these delicate\nand crucial tasks. The use of ICTs has prompted a gradual\ntransformation of instructional processes and strategies that\nimprove instructors' capability to meet the needs of learners.\nFeghali, Zbib, and Hallal (2011) posited that the use of ICTs\nin academic advising may provide better services to students,\nwhich in turns introduces greater accountability. Because of\ncomplex and time-consuming matters that relate to teaching\nand learning accountability, advising tasks often burden fac-\nulty advisors. Yet, not all the faculty members are ready for\nthe ICTs'integration; needless to say, they remain resistant to\nsuch a shift (Mitchell, Parlamis, & Claiborne, 2015).\n1National Taichung University of Education, Taiwan\nCorresponding Author:\nShinyi Lin, Professor, Master Program of Business Administration,\nNational Taichung University of Education, 140 Min-Shen Road, Taichung\nEmail: slin@ntcu.edu.tw\nSocial Contingency and Advising\nAccountability: Exploring Contextual\nPractice of Instant Messaging\nShinyi Lin1\n Keywords\nsocial contingency, advising accountability, instant messaging, self-efficacy, flow experience, epistemic engagement\n2 SAGE Open\nThe use of instant messaging (IM) has become an aca-\ndemic advising factor because of its ability to provide real-\ntime interaction and information exchanges (Bardi & Brady,\nAmericans use IM, Shiu and Lenhart (2004) found that (a)\nnearly 25% of IM users use IM more than they use email.\nNonetheless, most Internet users favor email over IM as\nmedia of communication. In addition, (b) 32% of college\ngraduates use IM while working, and (c) at-work IM users\ntend to be positive about how IM improves work flow and\nthe quality of their workday. Furthermore, (d) IM users\nhabitually use specific features to enhance their capability to\ncommunicate and to stay connected with others. This study\nincludes a brief summary of findings that can be accessed at\na glance, and the additional findings can be accessed in Shiu\nand Lenhart (2004). The results indicate that compared with\nother communication technologies, IM technologies provide\na superior solution regarding cost-effectiveness and imme-\ndiacy. Shea and Bidjerano (2010) pointed out that further\nresearch is needed to comprehend self-efficacy (SE) and its\nbroader concept of online self-regulation of learners.\nAs the premise of thesis advising to be ensured, the study\naddresses two purposes: (a) to present a conceptual frame-\nwork of thesis advising and the antecedents to accountability\nand (b) to explore whether the practical use of ICT-mediated\nsynchronous communication media promotes advisor avail-\nability to graduate students who are completing their theses.\nIn the context of thesis writing and advising, the synopsis of\nthis study lends support to the twofold research question. The\nfirst is to explore how graduate students perceive their self-\naccountability while synchronous ICTs, that is, IM, occupy\nthe main media of mutual discourse. Under the circum-\nstances, the next is to identify and validate what the anteced-\nents of advising accountability (AA) are when taking into\naccount of multiple theoretical models.\nLiterature Review\nA conceptual framework for acknowledging the antecedents\nof AA is proposed by integrating flow experience (FE) of\nusing IM and a community of inquiry (CoI). The proposed\nmodel comprises the notions of epistemic engagement (EE),\nadvising presence (AP), advisor credibility (AC), FE, and\nSE. The hypotheses that are generated using the theoretical\nframework are presented. The study provides a substantial\nliterature review to support the proposed model (Figure 1).\nSelf-Efficacy for Using IM\nSE, which originated from social cognitive theory (SCT), is\nused to determine the amount of effort people contribute to\nan activity, how long they persevere when confronting obsta-\ncles, and how resilient they are when facing adversity\n(Pajares, 2002). Because it is part of a belief in personal com-\npetence, SE acts on individual behavior in different manners\ncluded that the sense of efficacy is commensurate with the\neffort, persistence, and resilience that a person demonstrates.\nThe empirical research on SE, which was conducted by\nadopted various perspectives, has explored the determinants\nof SE and its effects (Hatice, 2011; C.-P. Lin & Bhattacherjee,\nPapastergiou, Gerodimos, & Antoniou, 2011; Shea &\nPapastergiou etal. (2011) used a pretest/posttest experimen-\ntal design to examine the effects of multimedia blogging in\nphysical education on student knowledge and ICT SE. They\nfound that among students who were interested in ICT, inter-\nest might have influenced the development of their SE in\nusing ICT. In planning technology resources, McCoy (2010)\nconcluded that educators'awareness of ICT SE could benefit\nstudent learning proficiency, particularly for those above the\nage of 25. In their longitudinal study on IM use among\nundergraduates in Taiwan, C.-P. Lin and Bhattacherjee\n(2009) found that information technology (IT) SE indirectly\ninfluences online social support, which is moderated by ICT\nuse. Grounded on SCT, one promising area of research has\nfocused on SE as a predictor of individual perceptions when\nit relates to technology proficiency in technology use (S. Lin\n& Overbaugh, 2009). Whether SE in using IM has an effect\nFigure 1. Research model.\nNote. H = hypothesis.\non the student perception of AA in academic thesis writing is\nparticularly relevant to the topic of this study.\nFlow Experience\nWhen people completely get involved in an activity, an innately\npositive experience known as flow emerge to produce intense\nfeelings of enjoyment (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). Chen,\nWigand, and Nilan (2000) considered flow as an optimal,\nextremely enjoyable experience; that is, the FE occurred when\npeople were fully engaged and involved in activities. In the\nstate of flow, people typically experience deep enjoyment, cre-\nativity, and a total involvement with life, as well as improved\nperformance and a sense of satisfaction (Csikszentmihalyi,\nposited that three conditions are necessary for achieving a flow\nstate. First, being involved in an activity with a clear set of\ngoals adds direction and structure. Second, an appropriate bal-\nance between the perceived challenges of a task and one's per-\nceived skills is critical; a person should have a considerable\namount of confidence in his or her ability to carry out a task.\nThird, clear and immediate feedback to task performance helps\npeople negotiate changing demands and allows them to refine\ntheir performance and maintain the state of flow. In their large-\nscale empirical study, Esteban-Millat, Mart\u00ednez-L\u00f3pez,\nHuertas-Garc\u00eda, Meseguer, and Rodr\u00edguez-Ardura (2014) took\na deep route on understanding antecedents and consequences\nof FE in virtual learning environments. They concluded that\nwhen leading students into ICTs-mediated environments,\ninstructors are accountable for getting them into a flow state.\npostgraduates from a variety of fields, including engineering,\nart, educational sciences, and psychology, by using ICTs.\nThe participants reported that inducing flow in ICT use could\nbe classified in one of four categories: (a) immediate feed-\nback; (b) clear rules and goals; (c) sufficient complexity, but\nnot to the extent that exhaustion is induced; and (d) dynamic\nchallenges instead of static challenges. The study of Pilke\n(2004) signified the core value to faculty and students of uti-\nlizing IM in academic advising, specifically thesis and dis-\nsertation advising. In their empirical survey study, Wang,\nHsieh, and Song (2012) validated the relationship between\nthe use of IM and user satisfaction in the context of building\nand maintaining social relationships with others. They found\nthat the antecedents of user satisfaction include perceived\nenjoyment, perceived social presence, and perceived useful-\nness. Therefore, for the purposes of this study, FE comprises\ntwo factors: perceived enjoyment and concentration.\nConceptually defined, enjoyment is the extent to which a\nperson perceives that using IM is enjoyable, aside from the\nperformance outcomes associated with using IM, whereas\nconcentration is the extent to which a person can focus only\non IM when using it (Lu, Zhou, & Wang, 2009).\nHypothesis 1 (H1): SE has a positive effect on FE.\nAdvising Presence\nThe concept of AP originates from the notion of CoI identi-\nfied by Shea and Bidjerano (2009). They posited that the CoI\nframework addresses the processes of instructional conver-\nsations within an online learning community likely leads to\nEE. Required to cultivate a sustainable learning community,\nthe CoI framework is the core element of the collaborative\nconstructivist learning environment (Garrison, Cleveland-\nInnes, & Fung, 2010). They also stress that higher order\nlearning would be best supported in a community in which\nlearners are engaged in critical reflection and discourse. The\nmultivariate measure of learning represented by the cogni-\ntive presence factor could be predicted according to the qual-\nity of teaching presence and social presence reported by\nlearners in online courses (Garrison et\nBidjerano, 2008). Responding to this research context, the\nterm advising presence is more appropriate than teaching\npresence. Examination of AP should not only be focused on\nthe task-oriented thesis study, but socio-emotional support\nshould also be considered to build authentic communication.\nTherefore, the FE that is invoked using IM could influence\nthe students' perception of faculty AP.\nHypothesis 2 (H2): FE has a positive effect on AP.\nAgain applying CoI in field research, Shea and Bidjerano\nblended courses from forty-two 2- and 4-year institutions.\nThey extended the CoI framework by using a learning pres-\nence that was conceptually defined as learner self-regulation,\nin addition to the original teaching, social, and cognitive\npresence. They found a strong correlation between the CoI\nconstructs and SE. Students believed that they achieved sig-\nnificant learning and that the effort they expended depended\npartly on their sense of efficacy. Furthermore, the results\nconfirmed that a strong correlation existed between con-\nstructs within the CoI framework and SE. In addition, Hester\n(2008) posited that (a) students who interacted frequently\nwith advisors show increased satisfaction with advising, (b)\na greater number of advising sessions was related to higher\ngrade point averages (GPAs), and (c) students' knowledge of\nuniversity resources and policies increased through advising\nsessions.\nHypothesis 3 (H3): SE has a positive effect on AP.\nAdvisor Credibility\nCredibility has been considered in three layers: competence,\ntrustworthiness, and goodwill (McCroskey & Teven, 1999).\nAccording to the definition given by McCroskey (1998),\ncompetence is the extent to which a person truly understands\nthe topic being discussed. The second factor, trustworthiness,\nis the degree to which a person perceives another person as\n4 SAGE Open\nhonest. The third factor, goodwill, is the perceived caring that\na person sees in a source. Among the three factors, goodwill\nmight be the most crucial (Punyanunt-Carter & Wrench,\nment of source credibility to measure competence, trustwor-\nthiness, and goodwill. Therefore,AC is a construct defined by\nthe three variables of competence, trustworthiness, and good-\nwill. Regarding the use of ICT-mediated communication to\nbuild a sense of community, Brown (2001) posited three cri-\nteria: (a) students who perceive common interests tend to\nmake contact and form relationships, creating online acquain-\ntances; (b) students who interact in a thoughtful way over\ntime tend to agree with each other to form community accep-\ntance; and (c) students who feel rapport, trust, goodwill, and\nfriendship for each other tend to build camaraderie.\nHypothesis 4 (H4): AP has a positive effect on AC.\nEpistemic Engagement\nPsychological research on epistemological development\nmultidimensional framework of epistemic beliefs, research-\ners have examined the relationships between students'beliefs\nand their use of cognitive processing strategies (Franco etal.,\n2012). Similar to the vision of knowledge as an epistemic and\ndiscursive practice, Larreamendy-Joerns and Leinhardt\n(2006) have posited that consistency exists between asyn-\nchronous learning networks and social constructivist and\nsociocultural theories of learning. Larreamendy-Joerns and\nLeinhardt (2006) specified that online education integrates a\n\"vision of knowledge as practice and of learning as emerging\nparticipation in a disciplinary community\" (p. 591). In online\neducation, Shea and Bidjerano (2009) empirically validated\nthat partially mediated by social presence, a CoI can foster\nEE. In another work regarding epistemic communities,\nPaavola, Lipponen, and Hakkarainen (2004) analyzed three\nmodels of innovative knowledge communities: Nonaka and\nTakeuchi's (1996) model of knowledge creation, Engestr\u00f6m's\nmodel of knowledge building. They found that despite funda-\nmental differences, the three models have pertinent common\nfeatures; specifically, the dynamic process for transforming\nprevailing knowledge and practices is greatly emphasized.\nBecause online thesis advising is considered a form of epis-\ntemic community in this study, the support of ICT-mediated\ncommunication can maximize student perception of advisors'\navailability to enhance their level of engagement.\nHypothesis 5 (H5): AP has a positive effect on EE.\nAdvising Accountability\nNumerous accountability-related studies that are based on\nTetlock's (1992) social contingency model are rooted in\nsocial psychology. To conceptualize accountability in orga-\nnizations, Hochwarter etal. (2007) asserted that levels of\naccountability are likely to be inconsistent and even contra-\ndictory, even when demands and expectations are equivalent;\nsuch is the nature of felt accountability. Understood as\nanswerability for performance, accountability raises imme-\ndiate inquiries for he who holds to account (Romzek, 2000).\nLindkvist and Llewellyn (2003) elaborated that the terms\nresponsibility and accountability (R/A) are often used inter-\nchangeably because there is little agreement on their defini-\ntions. Regarding academic teaching, Hendry and Dean\n(2002) considered accountability to be an explanation of\none's teaching practices. Romzek (2000) proposed two\ndichotomous dimensions, namely, sources of authority\n(internal/external) and degrees of autonomy (low/high), and\nclassified four types of accountability: hierarchical, legal,\npolitical, and professional. Berman and Smyth (2013)\nbrought up that tertiary relationship of advising practices\naims for cognitive enhancement relying on social and cul-\ntural activities. Because of this research context, AA indi-\ncates factors to which faculty advisors are held liable and\naccountable for the professional and social development of\ntheir student advisees. The ICT-mediated communication\nbetween student advisees and faculty advisors is inevitable\nfor meeting the expectations of degree projects and social\npractices. The conceptualization of the research model is\nillustrated in Figure 1.\nHypothesis 6 (H6): EE has a positive effect on AC.\nHypothesis 7 (H7): EE has a positive effect on AA.\nHypothesis 8 (H8): AC has a positive effect on AA.\nMethod\nResearch Participants and Procedure\nThe participants in this study were 310 graduate students\nwho were completing their master's thesis in management at\nuniversities in central Taiwan. The participants completed an\nonline survey powered by Google DocsTM and took less than\n10 min to complete the 24-item questionnaire in addition to\nthe demographic items. The participants were invited to\nrespond voluntarily during the spring semester. The data pro-\nvided by 56 participants were removed due to their response\nof not using IM to communicate with their thesis advisors.\nTherefore, the responses from 254 participants were entered\nfor statistical analysis.\nMeasures\nThe 24-item scale composed of six constructs was developed\nbased on the mentioned literature and was adapted to the\noperational definition accordingly to ensure its contextual\nconsistency. The participants rated their perception level on a\n7-point Likert-type scale, which ranged from strongly\ndisagree (1) to strongly agree (7). The items exhibiting low\nloadings on the corresponding construct were eliminated to\nenhance the reliability of measures. The appendix presents\nthe scale items of the measures in this study.\nAll 24 items were examined for their mean and SD. All\nthe midpoint of the 7-point Likert-type scale. The mean\nscores indicated an overall positive response to the variables\ncated the limited spread of the participants' responses.\nBecause of the use of a non-random sample, generalizing the\nresults of this study was limited to similar groups.\nPost Hoc Testing for Common Method Variance\n(CMV) Effects\nBecause of the potential problem of using self-reported mea-\nsures in behavioral research, the CMV was attributable to the\nmeasurement method rather than to the constructs that the\nmeasures represent (Meade, Watson, & Kroustalis, 2007;\nPodsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003). The first\nstatistical procedure used to examine the CMV was Harman's\none-factor test (Podsakoff etal., 2003; Podsakoff & Organ,\n1986). In this procedure, all relevant variables are entered\ninto a factor analysis. During the procedure, a single factor\nemerges from the unrotated solution of the factor analysis. In\nthis study, the first factor accounted for 45.87% of the vari-\nance, and all factors accounted for a total of 72.89% of the\nvariance. That is, one single factor did not account for the\nmajority of the covariance among the measures. Therefore,\nthe CMV was not a problem in testing the hypotheses.\nResults\nThe partial least-squares (PLS) technique was used to esti-\nmate the measurement and the structural models. The tech-\nnique of PLS-structural equation modeling (SEM) has\nbecome accepted in recent years because of its accuracy and\nutility (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2010; Hair, Ringle,\napproach, the PLS-SEM is designed to maximize the\nexplained variance of the dependent latent constructs (Hair\netal., 2011). Because of its predictive orientation, the PLS-\nSEM is the preferred method for theory development and\nprediction (Hair etal., 2011). Developed by Ringle, Wende,\nof PLS-SEM that is used to compute a path model and the\nparameter estimation based on a path-weighting scheme.\nDescriptive Statistics\nRegarding the students' status, 61% (n = 154) were full-time\nstudents, and 39% (n = 100) were part-time students.\nRegarding the thesis writing stage, 9% of the participants\n(n = 24) had not yet determined their thesis topics, 34% (n =\nwriting their proposals, and 28% (n = 70) had passed the oral\ndefense of their theses.\nMeasurement Model\nConvergent validity refers to the extent to which multiple\nitems or indicators share a proportion of variance. Reliability\nis an alternative indicator of convergent validity (Hair etal.,\n2010) that has been verified using internal consistency reli-\nability (ICR) and average variance extracted (AVE). Ideally,\nquate convergence, whereas an AVE value of less than .50\nimplies a higher level of error variance than was explained\nby the variance remaining in the measurement model. The\nICR and AVE values of this study met the recommended\nthresholds as in Table 1.\nDiscriminant validity, which refers to whether a given con-\nstruct is truly distinct from other constructs, could be assessed\nusing two criteria: (a) the square root of the AVE for each\nconstruct should exceed the correlations between this con-\nstruct and other constructs and (b) the factor loading should\nAs shown, the square root of the AVE for each construct\nexceeded the correlations between the constructs and all other\nconstructs (i.e., the off-diagonal elements in the correspond-\ning rows and columns). The factor loading of each construct\nassessment demonstrated that the discriminant validity of the\nmeasures was adequate. In summary, the measurement model\nassessment substantiated that all of the construct measures\nwere reliable and valid. Based on these findings, the follow-\ning step was to examine the structural model focusing on the\nhypothesized relationship between the constructs.\nStructural Model\nThe examination of the structural model involved estimating\nthe path coefficients and the R2 values. The path coefficients\nrepresented the magnitude of the expected change in the\nobserved variables, and the R2 values indicated the amount of\nvariance in dependent variables explained by their anteced-\nents (Vinzi, 2010). The R2 values and the path coefficients\ndemonstrated the extent to which the data validated the\nresearch model. With the bootstrapping procedure, Figure 2\nshows the results of the structural model that were assessed\nusing the overall explanatory power, the estimated path coef-\nficients, and the associated t values of the paths. The primary\nadvantage of bootstrapping is to allow researchers to assess\nthe stability of parameter estimates and to accurately report\n6 SAGE Open\nAs shown in Figure 2, the analysis demonstrates that FE (R2\nwas explained by EE ( = .29, p < .05) in H6. However, it was\nnot influenced byAP, indicating that H4 was not supported. EE\nported H5.As a whole,AA(R2 = .60) was directly explained by\nstatistically support H7. SE and FE explained 66% of the vari-\nance inAP. Three antecedents, namely, SE, FE, andAP, directly\nand indirectly explained 47% of the variance in EE. Four ante-\ncedents, namely, SE, FE, AP, and EE, directly and indirectly\nexplained 13% of the variance in EE. Overall, the five anteced-\nents explained 59% of the variance in AA.\nDiscussion\nAs aforementioned, the purpose of this study was to analyze\nand validate the determinants of AA by integrating IM in the\ncontext of the development of graduate theses in higher\neducation. Regardless of the generalization caveat resulted\nfrom the non-representative sample pool, the results showed\nthat student perception of AP is influenced by both their FE\nwhen using IM and positive interactions in communicating\nwith their thesis advisors. Therefore, AP influences EE, but\nnotAC. The students'perception ofAAwas highly dependent\non their awareness of their advisors' credibility but not on the\nEE of the students. Based on the tested hypotheses, the results\nshowed that the student perception of AP was influenced by\nSE and FE when using IM. In other words, the FE partly\nmediates SE and AP. To increase AP through IM, users must\nhave sufficient literacy and experience in using the system\ninterface and application, even if they are efficiently used in\ncomputer-mediated communication applications such as IM.\nAdvisors are most likely to utilize ICT-mediated communi-\ncation such as IM to maximize their availability or virtual pres-\nence; however, this tactic does not directly increase students'\nperception of their advisors' credibility. The enhancement of\ncredibility occurs only when the virtual presence enables cog-\nnitive engagement. High levels of AC do not directly result\nfromAP but depend indirectly on the levels of EE during thesis\nTable 1. Measurement Model Estimation.\nNote. Off-diagonal elements are correlations between the constructs. The diagonal elements (bold) are the square root of the shared variance between\nthe constructs and their measures. Square root of the shared variance across items measuring a construct was higher than correlations across constructs\nshows that discriminant validity across constructs is supported. ICR = internal consistency reliability; CA = Cronbach's alpha; AVE = average variance\nextracted.\nFigure 2. PLS structural model assessment of the study.\nNote. PLS = partial least-squares.\nwriting. EE fully mediates AP and AC. AP, which originates\nfrom a CoI, indicates a high level of socio-emotional support,\nwhereas AC indicates the students'perceptions of the advisors'\ncompetency, trustworthiness, and goodwill.\nHigh levels of AA are not directly caused by EE; how-\never, AA indirectly depends on AC. AC fully mediates EE\nand AA. Student perception of AA depends on whether they\nbelieve their advisor to be competent and trustworthy and on\ntheir rapport with them; nonetheless, they consider them-\nselves to be accountable for their own cognitive involve-\nment in their theses. To conclude, this study has produced\nthe following three findings: (a) SE and FE when using IM\nare antecedents of AA, (b) the advisor's role (i.e., AP, AC)\nmediates the preceding findings, and (c) student advisees\nconsider their own EE during the thesis advising process.\nSufficient discussion between graduate students and fac-\nulty advisors should involve higher order thinking skills and\nencourage critical reflection. Development of critical thinking\ncan be best supported in an interactive community in which\nlearners are engaged in critical reflection and discourse\n(Mendenhall & Johnson, 2010; Qiyun, Huay Lit, & Jianhua,\nresponsibility for auditing the quality of teaching and learning\nin their classes on an ongoing basis (Dill, 1999). In graduate\nprograms, the evaluation of thesis advising has not gained as\nmuch attention as student evaluation of teaching (SET) has.\nFor instance, SET has been extensively applied to all credit\ncourses to evaluate students' perception of teaching quality.\nHowever, independent studies for theses and/or dissertations\nare typically excluded. Nonetheless, additional determinants,\nwhich might be mediated by, or confounded by, the students'\nperception of AA, should be identified. Regarding the poten-\ntial contributions of this research, IM vendors could reference\nthe results of this study to identify the critical factors involved\nwhen developing or customizing IM interfaces or functional-\nity for the exclusive use of academic advising.\nMeasures.\nConstruct Item\nAA\nAA1 Advisor provides strategic guide\nAA2 My advisor and I discuss the issues of career\ndevelopment\nAA3 Advisor guides me with integration of my career\ndevelopment\nAA4 I hold complete accountability in the completion of\nmy thesis\nAC\nAC1 Advisor responds to my inquiries timely\nAC2 Advisor instructs me adaptively\nAC3 I trust the appropriate guidance by my advisor in\nthesis writing\nAppendix\nConstruct Item\nAC4 My advisor and I have a good basis for interaction\nAP--\"When using IM for communicating with my advisor, I\nperceive it will . . . \"\nAP1 Construct collaborative learning environment\nAP2 Form a meaningful learning community\nAP3 Enhance critical thinking\nAP4 Promote self-regulated learning\nEE--\"Using IM does . . . \"\nEE1 Promote motivation for proactive learning\nEE2 Enrich dialogue\nEE3 Stimulate creative imagination\nEE4 Enhance levels of cognition\nFE--\"Using IM will . . . \"\nFE1 Shape positive experience\nFE2 Enrich deep enjoyment\nFE3 Precipitate creativity\nFE4 Focus discussion\nSE toward IM--\"Using IM obtains . . . \"\nSE1 Timely efficiency\nSE2 Two-way communication\nSE3 Economic benefit\nSE4 Real-time information\nNote.
