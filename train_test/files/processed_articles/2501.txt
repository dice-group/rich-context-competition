We used data from the US National\nof grandmaternal educational level (less than high school, high school diploma or equivalent, or college degree) at\nthe time of the mother's birth on GBW, adjusted for maternal life-course factors: maltreatment as a child, education\nand income as an adult, prepregnancy overweight, and prenatal smoking.

We compared these estimates with\nthose obtained from structural equation models (SEMs) and\nMSM approaches. We used sensitivity analyses to evaluate\nwhether MSM estimates differed due to model parameteriza-\ntion, assumptions about causal structure, and/or unmeasured\nconfounding.\nMETHODS\nStudy setting\nWe used data from the National Longitudinal Study of\nAdolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a nationally repre-\nsentative US longitudinal study of grade 7\u00ad12 adolescents\n90,118). Detailed information on Add Health respondents,\nthe sampling frame, weighting algorithms (23), and study\nprotocols can be found on the study's website (www.cpc.\nunc.edu/projects/addhealth/). Briefly, in-home interviews\nwere conducted with a core subset of respondents (randomly\nselected within school and sex strata) along with a parent,\nduring which information was collected on demographic fac-\ntors,health, attitudes, behaviors, and environment. Additional\nrespondents and parents were interviewed on the basis of eth-\nnic minority status, having siblings in the study, and/or being\nblack with at least 1 college-educated parent (n = 20,745 re-\nspondents). Respondents first interviewed in wave I were fol-\nlowed for up to 3 additional in-home interviews conducted in\nthose eligible in wave I) were interviewed. To approximate the\n1995, investigators derived a grand sampling weight account-\ning for clustered sampling, attrition, and oversampling (23).\nResearch on these data has been approved by the Institution-\nal Review Board of the University of Washington (Seattle,\nWashington).\nStudy population\nRespondents (G1--\"mother\") were eligible for the current\nstudy if they were women, had a biological mother (G0--\n\"grandmother\") who was interviewed during wave I, partici-\npated in both the wave I and wave IV interviews, and had at\nleast 1 livebirth (G2--\"grandchild\") during the course of the\nstudy. Since firstborn offspring are hypothesized to be more\nsusceptible to adverse in utero programming from maternal\nconstraint (24),wematchedG1stotheirfirstreportedsingleton\nbirth (G2). There were 2,352 women who met the eligibility\ncriteria. After excluding 48 (2.0%) respondents missing a re-\na wave IV grand sampling weight because of missing wave II/\nIII interviews, and 12 (0.5%) respondents missing both, we\nwith missing sampling weights did not differ substantially\nfrom the analytical population (see Web Table 1, available at\nhttp://aje.oxfordjournals.org/).\nMeasures\nPrimary exposure and outcome. During wave I (1994\u00ad\n1995), a respondent's mother (G0) was asked, \"How far did\nyou go in school?\" Responses were coded into 3 categories:\nless than high school diploma, high school diploma or equiv-\nalent (e.g., General Educational Development certificate),\nor completed college degree. Because we were interested in\nG1s' intrauterine experiences, we capped completed education\nat a high school diploma if G0 gave birth at or prior to age 21\nyears (n = 86). G2 birth weight (grams) was reported by G1\nduring the wave IV interview. When compared with birth rec-\nords, maternal recall of child birth weight is fairly accurate (9).\nG1 psychosocial and socioeconomic stress mediators.\nChildhood maltreatment (25) and adult SES (26) are impor-\ntant psychosocial stressors in G1s' life course that may lie\nwithin the causal pathway between G0 education and G2 birth\nweight. In line with previous investigations in Add Health\n(25), we used self-reported incidents of neglect, physical\nabuse, and sexual abuse prior to 18 years of age to construct\na maltreatment factor score. Factor scores were generated\nusing principle-component factor analysis and quartimin\nrotations. Adult SES closest to the time of G2's birth was\nmeasured using 3 variables: 1) self-reported total household\nincome (dollars) during wave IV or one of the following ap-\nproximations, based on the midpoint of categorical choices\ntion, categorized by last grade or schooling type completed;\nand 3) an indicator of whether G1 reported that she would be\nin debt in response to the following question: \"Suppose you\nand others in your household were to sell all of your major\npossessions (including your home), turn all of your invest-\nments and other assets into cash, and pay off all of your\ndebts. Would you have something left over, break even, or\nbe in debt?\" A factor score for adult SES was predicted as\ndescribed above. If the respondent gave birth to G2 prior to\n2001, a wave III factor score was calculated excluding the\ndebt measure, not asked about in wave III. Correlations be-\ntween the 2 SES factor scores were moderate (unadjusted\nfactor scores were also dichotomized at their median values\n(high/low; 19% had discordant wave III and wave IV SES\ncategories).\nG1 biological and behavioral mediators. Higher prepreg-\nnancy BMI is associated with lower maternal education and\nhigher birth weights and may be a consequence of early-life\nprogramming (27, 28). G1 prepregnancy BMI was calculated\nGrandmaternal Education, Birth Weight, and Bias   569\nfrom weight and height measures obtained by either wave II\nof births), or wave III study staff. Correlation between the 2\nBMI measures was high (unadjusted Pearson's r = 0.76; P <\n0.0001), and past findings suggest that such self-reports may\nbe reasonably accurate (29). Prepregnancy overweight status\nwas defined as a BMI of 25 or more. Prenatal smoking is as-\nsociated with maternal education and lower birth weight (27,\n28, 30). We coded G1 prenatal smoking as any or none, based\non self-reported smoking during the index pregnancy.\nTime-invariant confounders. G0 age at G1's birth is re-\nlated to G0 educational attainment and may influence child-\nrearing practices and therefore the life-course psychosocial\nand biological stressors experienced by G1 (31, 32). Simi-\nlarly, G0 self-reported race is related to G0 educational op-\nportunity and attainment, as well as stressors experienced\nHispanic white, black (any ethnicity), or other nonwhite,\nwith persons who reported any mixed race not including\nblack being accorded the last category. Both variables were\nincluded as confounders in all analyses.\nStatistical analysis\nWe examined the possibility that early-life SES may be as-\nsociated with future pregnancy outcome (Figure 1) using 3\nmodeling approaches to estimate the direct effect of grandma-\nternal (G0) educational category (Xi\n) on the birth weight (Yi\n)\nof her daughter's (G1) child (G2), including any \"develop-\nmental programming\" pathway mediated through G1 prepreg-\nnancy overweight (Oi\n): 1) covariate-adjusted linear regression\nmodels of measured predictors of G2 birth weight, 2) a linear\nSEM using dichotomous mediators, and 3) a linear MSM\nusing dichotomous mediators estimated by inverse probability\nweights. Using each approach, we attempted to account for\ntime-invariant confounding by G0 age at G1's birth (Gi\n) and\nG0 self-reported race (Ri\n), as well as endogenous confounding\nby G1 life-course mediators: a high level of childhood mal-\ntreatment prior to age 18 years (Mi\n), prepregnancy overweight\n(Oi\n), low adult SES (Ai\n), and any prenatal smoking (Si\n). Fi-\nnally, we tested vulnerability to certain model assumptions\nthrough sensitivity analyses.\nCovariate-adjusted linear regression. Under this ap-\nproach, it is impossible to estimate an effect of Xi\non Yi\nwhile\nsimultaneously controlling for mediator-outcome confound-\ning by G1 prepregnancy overweight or obesity status (Oi\n). In-\nstead, we fitted 2 separate multivariable linear regression\nmodels including exposure, confounders, and life-course me-\ndiators as predictors of G2 birth weight, including (model 1)\nand excluding (model 2) adjustment for Oi\n:\nE\u00bdYi\njXi\n\u00bc x; Ri\n\u00bc r; Gi\n\u00bc g; Mi\n\u00bc m; Oi\n\u00bc o; Ai\n\u00bc a; Si\n\u00bc s\n\u00bc \n\u00fe \nx \u00fe \nr \u00fe \ng \u00fe \nm \u00fe \no \u00fe \na \u00fe \nE\u00bdYi\njXi\n\u00bc x; Ri\n\u00bc r; Gi\n\u00bc g; Mi\n\u00bc m; Ai\n\u00bc a; Si\n\u00bc s\n\u00bc \n\u00fe \nx \u00fe \nr \u00fe \ng \u00fe \nm \u00fe \na \u00fe \nNeither model 1 (equation 1) nor model 2 (equation 2) can\nestimate our desired quantity: Model 1 would overadjust by\nremoving the effect of Xi\non Yi\nmediated through Oi\n, and\nmodel 2 does not adequately control for Ai\n- Yi\nor Si\n- Yi\ncon-\nfounding by Oi\n. We used these models to compare different\ncovariate functional forms and multiple imputation estimates.\nStructural equation model.

O is excluded in model\n3, allowing the mediated path to be included in the controlled\ndirect effect.\nTo account for the survey design and produce correct stan-\ndard errors (23), we estimated each weight with the svy op-\ntion in Stata (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas) after\nusing the wave IV grand sampling weights \u00f0wgsw\ni\n\u00de; clustering,\nand stratification variables for the svyset command in\nStata.

An analogous method was\ndescribed by Brumback et al. (36) for SAS (SAS Institute\nInc., Cary, North Carolina).

In addition, to address the validity of our\nmodel on the basis of prior knowledge and temporal sequence\nand assumptions regarding no unmeasured exposure- and\nmediator-outcome confounding, we conducted several sen-\nsitivity analyses.\nSensitivity analyses\nModel specification. Preterm birth is an important medi-\nator of low birth weight and may be of great interest (38, 39).\nWe refitted model 3 after adding an indicator for birth before\n37 weeks' gestation and a corresponding probability weight.\nAdditionally, we examined the sensitivity of model 3 to:\npercentiles to evaluate the influence of rare treatment types\n(37); 2) including interaction terms in the estimation of\nweights (equations 4\u00ad7); and 3) reversing the presumed tem-\nporal relationship of adult SES and prepregnancy overweight\nby removing O from equation 6.\nData replacement. To analyze the sensitivity of our anal-\nysis to mediator values missing at random conditional on\navailable data, we refitted models 1 and 2 using multiple im-\nputation by chained equations (40). For model 3, sensitivity to\nmissingness was assessed by replacing missing values for G1\nmediators and reweighting. Three strategies were used for re-\nplacement: First, all missing values were assumed to be indic-\native of risk (i.e., missing values for adult SES were replaced\nwith an indicator of low adult SES); second, missing values\nfor wave III prepregnancy overweight and wave IV adult SES\nwere replaced with their values from waves II and III, respec-\ntively; and third, all values for these 2 mediators were replaced\nwith their values from waves II and III, respectively.\nTable 1.

Under the hypothetical bias sce-\nnarios, we found that a single binary confounder would have\nto differ in prevalence between exposure groups by at least 25%\n(and affect G2 birth weight by approximately 50 g) or have an\neffect on G2 birth weight of 150 g (and differ by approximately\n10%) to fully explain our findings (Table 5).\nDISCUSSION\nOverall, we found fairly robust evidence for an association\nbetween grandmaternal (G0) education at the time of a moth-\ner's (G1) birth on the birth weight of her grandchild (G2), in-\ndependent of the mother's mediating life course. We found\nciated with each increase in G0 educational level (less than\nhigh school, high school diploma or equivalent, or college\ndegree), after adjusting for childhood maltreatment, low adult\nSES, prenatal smoking, and endogenous confounding by pre-\npregnancy BMI. Our findings were robust to tested model\nalterations, data replacement, and several unmeasured con-\nfounding scenarios.\nEarly-life determinants of pregnancy outcomes are of partic-\nular interest (2), particularly because of the insensitivity of low\nbirthweighttoknowninterventions (42).There issomebiolog-\nical plausibility for an association between lower grandmater-\nnal educational status and grandchild birth weight through\nglucocorticoid exposure and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal\naxis programming pathways (5\u00ad9). However, prior empirical\nstudies on associations between grandparental education and\ngrandchild birth have not provided consistent evidence (9, 10):\nIn a studyof predominantly African Americans and low-income\nwhites, Astone et al. (9) found high grandmaternal education\nto be associated with a 181-g increased grandchild birth weight\namong mothers with a high school education or less. However,\nKwok et al. (10) found no such association after adjusting for\nparental education. The potential influence of endogenous\nconfounding was not tested in either study. Controlling for\nendogenous confounding by maternal prepregnancy BMI, a\nstrong determinant of birth weight, we found relatively strong\nevidence for an association.\nTable 4.

For comparison, any G1 prenatal smoking was 6.4% lower among college-educated grandmothers than among grandmothers\nwith less than a high school education and was associated with a 118-g reduction in G2 birth weight.\nGrandmaternal Education, Birth Weight, and Bias   575\nOur approach contributed several strengths to this investi-\ngation. First, prominent determinants of birth weight, includ-\ning prepregnancy BMI, prenatal smoking, and self-reported\nrace (28) and mediation by childhood maltreatment (25),\nwere explicitly included in our models. Second, we addressed\nthe possibility of incorrect model specification and mismea-\nsurement through a variety of techniques and found that these\nscenarios had little influence on estimates. For example, it is\nplausible that adult SES influences prepregnancy BMI. Nei-\nther swapping the causal ordering (through reweighting) nor\nusing alternative (i.e., earlier wave) measures of these medi-\nators appeared to greatly affect estimates. Additionally, the\nconsistent estimates across models that adjusted for different\ncovariate parameterizations (Table 2) suggest that residual\nconfounding from dichotomization was not likely to be re-\nsponsible for our MSM findings. Dichotomization at other\ncutpoints for low adult SES or childhood maltreatment did\nnot change our substantive interpretations. In fact, using the\n20th percentile as the cutpoint for low adult SES strengthened\nestimated associations (results not shown). Our quantitative\nbias analysis suggested that a single binary confounder would\nneed to be fairly strong and imbalanced across exposure\ngroups to fully explain our estimates. Third, confidence in our\nfindings is also improved by the concurrence of secondary\nmodel findings with past literature: Notably, we observed\ngreater strengths of association between G2 birth weight and\nproximate G1 mediators, prenatal smoking and adult SES,\nthan between G2 birth weight and childhood maltreatment\nusing the MSM. In addition, the magnitude of birth weight\nreduction due to prenatal smoking was in line with findings\nfrom past meta-analyses (28, 43). Finally, our choice to esti-\nmate a controlled direct effect allowed us to address the ques-\ntion, What association with grandmaternal education remains\neven after strictly controlling more proximal, life-course de-\nterminants of birth weight outcome? Finding an association\nin this context helps provide justification for continued inves-\ntigation of early-life factors despite the prevailing clinical\nfocus on modifiable perinatal maternal factors. Furthermore,\nunlike the case with natural direct effect estimation, we were\nable to avoid cross-world assumptions (44).\nSome limitations of our study are worth highlighting. In\nspite of several sensitivity and bias analyses, model misspe-\ncification and unmeasured cofounding were still possible. In\nrecent publications, several authors have questioned the abil-\nityofconventionalobservationmethodstocompletelyaccount\nfor these issues (45, 46). We attempted to address these lim-\nitations through model alterations (Web Tables 5\u00ad13) and by\nquantifying the influence of potential unmeasured confound-\ners. However, it is still possible that several nonbinary un-\nmeasured confounders may collectively explain our findings\n(22, 41). Since Add Health was not designed to investigate\ncharacteristics surrounding the respondent's (G1) birth, we\nwere limited in our ability to incorporate potentially interesting\nG1 perinatal exposures. These include infection, air pollution,\nG0 nutrition, and smoking. When breastfeeding duration and\nG0 smoking during G1 adolescence (Web Table 5) were incor-\nporated into our MSM analyses, point estimates and confidence\nintervalswerevirtuallyunchanged.Sinceourstudyreliedalmost\nsolely on self-reports (with the exception of wave III BMI), bias\ndue to measurement error is also a concern. Specifically, recall\nof childhood maltreatment and prenatal smoking may be differ-\nentially misclassified by grandmaternal and maternal SES. No-\ntably, this may explain the unexpected positive association\nbetween childhood maltreatment and adult SES in our SEM.\nFinally, we stress that findings from our study should be\ninterpreted as suggestive associations rather than estimates of\ncausal effects per se. Education represents a state which may\nbe achieved through a variety of pathways and consequently\n(47) may be indicative of 1 or more true causal exposures with\nvarying influences on early-life environment and future preg-\nnancyoutcome.Nonetheless,theidentificationofaconsistent,\ndirect association between an early-life factor and pregnancy\noutcome under various causal assumptions coupled with a\nvariety of sensitivity approaches supports the pursuit of more\nspecific early-life causal exposures that may explain the role\nof education as a fundamental, transgenerational determinant\nof health (48). Further research on biological mechanisms--\nfor example, fetal glucocorticoid exposure due to maternal\neducation-related stressors (5\u00ad7)--may help to identify more\nprecise causal effects.\n"
