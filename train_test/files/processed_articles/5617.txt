I draw intellectual inspiration from the sociology of science and make use of\nresearch into the idea of \"expertise\" per se. In so doing, I am attempting to move the debate beyond the limitations placed\nupon it by philosophical or meta-ethical analysis and develop a perspective than can be used to address the sociological\nreality of (bio)ethical expertise. To do so, I offer the terms ethos and eidos to provide a basic conceptual framework for\nthe sociological analysis of \"morality\" and \"ethics.\" I then turn to an exegesis of Collins and Evans's account of ubiquitous,\ncontributory, and interactional expertise and situate these topics in relation to academic bioethics and medical practice. My\naccount suggests a particular understanding of the kinds of relationships that \"bioethics\" should seek to foster with the social\nfields it endeavors to not only comment on but also influence.\n",

Littoz-Monnet, 2014), there is a\npressing need to theorize and thereby comprehend the way\nsuch expertise not only works but could be made to work.\nHowever, despite a reasonable significant body of bioethical\nSinger, 1972), there seems little of normative value. The\nanalysis presented below attempts to move the debate for-\nward by drawing on the work of Collins and Evans (2002,\n2007), whose theory of expertise is explicitly positioned as\nnormative. However, my remarks do not consider \"bioethics\"\nas a whole but on a particular and, one might add, dominant\naspect of this interdiscipline, namely, \"applied ethics\" or that\npart of bioethics that can be considered to be offering a spe-\ncific and challenging form of ethical expertise. Furthermore,\nmy analysis is conducted in the particular context of \"medical\nethics\" and concerns the relationship between ethics in medi-\ncal practice and the scholarly endeavor of applied (medical)\nethics. The exegesis is social theoretical and, broadly, rooted\nin a contemporary \"theory of practice\" perspective. As such,\nmy interest is not restricted to a descriptive theorization but\nrepresents a critical engagement with implications for the\nreconstruction of the relationship between, on one hand, clini-\ncal practitioners and the health care professions and, on the\nother, experts in applied ethics. With this in mind, one might\nposition this essay as a socio-analysis of the ethics of bioeth-\nics or, more accurately, the ethics of applied ethical exper-\ntise. However, in the same way as sociological research into\nscience is indifferent to the methodological and epistemo-\nlogical claims of its object, I am largely indifferent to the\ninternal methodological and meta-ethical commitments\nembedded in the disciplinary practice I seek to analyze. My\nanalysis is grounded in a sociological or social theoretical\nperspective; it is self-consciously constituted as external to\nthe philosophical practice known as applied ethics, a main-\nstay of bioethics. Thus, while it can be understood as a kind\nof ethical analysis, it cannot be considered a form of applied\nor practical ethics.\nAs this introductory paragraph suggests, I am, for the pur-\nposes of analysis, distinguishing something called \"applied\nethics\" from \"bioethics\" or even \"ethics\" more generally.\nFirst, while they can be seen as forming the core of the field,\nbioethics encompasses more than \"applied ethics\" or even\n\"ethics.\" It is a multi- and inter-disciplinary endeavor that\nencompasses historical, sociological, and anthropological\n1Queen's University Belfast, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nNathan Emmerich, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, BT7 1NN, UK.\nEmail: n.emmerich@qub.ac.uk\nA Sociological Analysis of Ethical\nExpertise: The Case of Medical Ethics\nNathan Emmerich1\n Keywords\nethics, bioethics, expertise, practice theory, interactional expertise\n2 SAGE Open\nperspectives. Second, my aim is to analyze bioethical exper-\ntise in such a way as to face up to what I consider the \"hard\nproblem\" of a specifically ethical expertise. Thus, my focus\nis on \"applied ethics,\" which, as a mode of ethical analysis,\npresents itself with a greater degree sense of normative con-\nclusion than other forms of disciplined ethical analysis or\neven \"normative ethics\" in general. While the \"authority\" of\nsuch conclusions is, it is claimed, a function of \"the argu-\nment\" rather than \"the author,\" it is nevertheless the case\nthat, one, applied ethics is a methodologically disciplined,\nspecialist and, therefore, expert activity, and two, it is a mode\nof analysis that is strongly aimed at being broadly guiding\naction or practical.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the notion of an applied ethics is\nnot easy to specify, at least not fully. In the first instance, one\nmight note that the application of moral theory to ethical\nposed differences between them, applied ethics encompasses\nboth \"principlist approaches\" as well as those that claim to\nbe based in broader conceptions of our \"common morality\"\n2000). For the present purposes, it is, I think, better to con-\nsider applied ethics as a style of argument or a mode of ethi-\ncal rationality. This approach to ethics is fundamentally\nphilosophical but, nevertheless, has an essentially practical\nambition meaning that, as London (2001) suggests with\nregard to the more general phenomena of normative or \"prac-\ntical\" ethics, applied ethics exhibits a certain degree of inde-\npendence from philosophical moral theories. Nevertheless,\napplied ethics is not as intersubjectively accommodating as\nLondon suggests of practical ethics. Indeed, for the most\npart, the academic and analytic values embedded in the dis-\nciplinary field of practice mean that a virtue is made of robust\ndisagreement and the resulting tenor that colors the exchange\nof ethical argument.\nOne way to characterize the practice of applied ethics is\nby reference to the particular set of values that distinguish it\nfrom other forms of practical ethics such as casuistry, dis-\ncourse ethics, reflective equilibrium, and feminist ethics. Of\nparticular interest is, I think, the way in which the values\nunderpinning ethical analysis affect the relationship between\nit and the notion of politics and political debate. There are, no\ndoubt, a variety of other reasons one could consider in exam-\nining such differences. Casuistry, for example, rejects \"the\ntyranny of principles\" (S. E. Toulmin, 1981). However, it is\nthe variation in perspective on \"politics\" that most clearly\nreveals important variations in argumentative and analytic\nstyle. According to Radcliffe-Richards, applied ethics is\nprior to--and has priority over--politics.As she puts it, there\nis \"a crucial distinction between debates about policies or\nactions that are under consideration, and debates about what\nconstraints or limits should be imposed on those consider-\nAlthough discourse ethics, reflective equilibrium, and even\nfeminist ethics all offer disciplined forms of ethical argu-\nment, there is a less sharp distinction between them and con-\ncerns of a more political nature. Indeed, the approach taken\nto ethics by these analytic modes is not apolitical but shaped\nby political concerns. While some have questioned the idea\nthat applied ethics is, in fact, apolitical (Evans, 2012; Tronto,\n2011), it nevertheless remains a presumption fundamental to\nthe endeavor. Although we need not challenge this conceit at\nthe level of methodology--many of the underlying perspec-\ntives presumed by many intellectual endeavors are, when\nconsidered sociologically, essentially treated as methodolog-\nical rather than philosophical commitments--there is no\nneed to adopt it ourselves. Thus my arguments do not, at\nleast not explicitly, aim at the methodological destabilization\nof applied ethics. Rather they aim to situate the expertise of\napplied ethicists in its broader socio-cultural and poltical\ncontext and, consequentiually, question the ethics of such\nexpertise.\nThe approach to ethical analysis adopted by applied ethics\nachieves its generality (if not universality) through an attempt\nat ethical objectivity, the form of which is reliant not only on\nits apolitical stance but also through being socially, cultur-\nally, and historically decontextualizing. Different approaches\nto ethics vary in the degree to which they pursue (or value)\nthe same kind of ethical objectivity and, therefore, the degree\nto which they are similarly decontextualizing in their analy-\nsis. Although feminist ethics seeks to retain and recognize\nthe ethical importance of gender and its associated, and his-\ntorically variable, socio-cultural norms, discourse ethics can\nbe characterized as something that \"embeds the practice of\npriate way to characterize the distinction between different\nforms of ethical analysis is, at least for the socio-analytic\npurposes at hand, not simply by placing them on a spectrum\nwith regard to their socio-political sensitivity but through\nreference to Wittgenstein's notion of family resemblance. To\nanticipate something of the below argument, ethical analysis\nproceeds according to the particular, and largely implicit,\nvalues, norms, and principles that constitute the ethos of the\ndisciplinary field. The differences between different modes\nof ethical analysis exist at this level, the level ethos; there-\nfore, the relevant family resemblances also exist at this level.\nThus, while my analysis focuses on the expertise of applied\nphilosophical approaches to (bio)ethics, it remains an exam-\nple of the more general phenomena of \"normative\" or \"prac-\ntical\" ethics.\nFurthermore, regardless of their methodological stripes or\nmeta-ethical perspectives, we might also note that what\nexpert ethicists actually do is highly consistent. Their pri-\nmary task is to develop and present ethical arguments and to\ndo so in the form of journal articles. To do so, they read simi-\nlar articles, remain abreast of the substantive fields they\nEmmerich 3\ncomment upon, and give presentations to their peers and to\nother interested individuals or groups. Furthermore, they do\nso on the basis of their disciplinary knowledge. This is some-\nthing that is, first, likely to encompass various approaches to\nethical analysis and, second, the result of a long period of\neducation and experience. Thus, while applied ethics may\nclaim that any \"moral authority\" is a function of what\nHabermas (1993) calls the \"unforced force of the better argu-\nment\" (p. 163), it remains the case that we are not all equally\nable when it comes to the evaluation of such arguments.\nThus, while my concern is with the more \"rationalist\" form(s)\nof ethical expertise, this is not because I believe it to be the\ncorrect, best, or even most expert form of ethical analysis.\nRather, it presents the most compelling challenge to the theo-\nrization of ethical expertise, what I have, above, termed the\nhard problem of ethical expertise. The audience for the argu-\nments of applied ethics is not restricted to other disciplinary\nspecialists (experts) or to those with a formal grounding in\nany of the various approaches to practical ethics.\nFor example, while some members of the medical and\nhealth care professions may have been exposed to applied\nethics, perhaps to the extent of taking a masters level course\nin the subject, most will have had limited exposure to this\ndisciplined mode of thought. While it is perhaps true to say\nthat it is feasible for non-specialists or non-experts to read\nacademic articles published in specialist applied ethics jour-\nnals--certainly it would seem more feasible than asking a\nnon-expert to read an article published in an academic bio-\nchemistry journal--it is nevertheless the case that some\nexpertise, cognitive skills, or domain-relative reflective\ncapability is required. Indeed, that this is the case would\nseem to be a motivating assumption for the ethical education\nof professionals, at least insofar as such education aims at the\nintellectual (analytic, reflective, or \"cognitive\") develop-\nment of such professionals and not merely at providing them\nwith factual information about existing debates. From this\npoint of view, we need to get to grips with the expertise of\napplied ethicists. Denying its existence on philosophical or\nmeta-ethical grounds prevents us from engaging with the\npractical consequences of applied ethics as a specialist, dis-\nciplined, and academic endeavor. We must come to some sort\nof resolution regarding the ethical expertise embedded in this\ndomain if we are to fully address the broader cultural and\nsocio-political role of applied ethics, particularly in the con-\ntext of bioethics. This point not only applies to ethics in med-\nicine, the topic of this essay, but also to public debates and\nthe broader political discourses within which public policy is\nformed. Although exploration of this point will have to await\nanother forum if it is to be fully explored, we might note that\nthe conceptual specifics of ethical expertise may well vary\nover differing contexts. Nevertheless, the following com-\nments present and explore an account that can, at least, be\nused as a starting point for further analysis of the distinctly\nmodern (or \"modernist\") phenomena of applied philsophical\n(bio)ethics and problem of ethical expertise more generally.\nEthos and Eidos: Morality and Ethics\nFrom a Sociological Perspective\nGiven that bioethics is dominated by philosophical forms of\nethical analysis, and that existing analysis of ethical exper-\ntise has tended to originate within the field, there would seem\nto be scope for alternative perspectives to make a significant\ncontribution. Indeed, for the most part, existing work on ethi-\ncal expertise has neglected the substantial corpus of research\ninto expertise per se. This corpus can, I think, be used to\nilluminate a number of difficulties in this area. Consistent\nwith practice theory, such views \"reinforce the conception of\nethics as Hegelian Sittlichkeit as opposed to Kantian\nadopt a sociological perspective on practical and applied eth-\nics so that they can be addressed as a form of intellectual,\nreflective, or analytic practice embedded in disciplinary\nfield(s). Such a view further suggests that we consider this\nfield--and its practices--as a part of a broader moral culture.\nTo do so is to invite the reconceptualization of the relation-\nship between \"common morality\" and \"applied\" or \"practi-\ncal\" ethics. It is to situate formal ethics (moralit\u00e4t) within or,\nat least, in relation to informal or common morality (or sit-\ntlichkeit). While the formal nature of applied ethics can be\nunderstood as an attempt to eliminate the contingency of\nmoral value in favor of rational argument, the view adopted\nhere is that such practices are nevertheless embedded in a\nparticular culture, a mode of social life. As such, they are,\nlike any other practice, inherently situated and unavoidably\nvalue-laden.\nWhile some recent developments in philosophical bioeth-\nics (cf. Kukla, 2014) compliment this kind of view, it remains\na philosophically heterodox account. However, bioethical\nresearch conducted from a sociological and/or anthropologi-\ncal perspective more clearly compliments my account. For\nexample, Fox and Swazey (1984) differentiate between\n\"medical morality\" and (practical or applied) \"bioethics.\"\nKleinmann (1995, p. 45) offers a similar account, and it can\nbe found in more broadly focused texts (Edel & Edel, 2000,\nAlthough I use relatively novel terms--namely, ethos and\neidos1--to relate (common) morality or \"sittlichkeit\" to eth-\nics or \"moralit\u00e4t,\" they not only stand alongside such views,\nbut I have also made complimentary use of them elsewhere\n(Emmerich, 2014; in press).2 In making use of them here, my\naim is to show that any form of ethical expertise can be\nunderstood as a historically constituted and socially situated\nform of expertise, the practice of which is embedded in par-\nticular cultural contexts.\nThe stance I adopt can be considered as an attempt to\ndraw our attention to the difference between the broad nor-\nmative \"social\" (sociological) or \"cultural\" (anthropologi-\ncal) structuring of a society, culture, or a particular field and\nthe comparatively narrow conception of normativity attached\nto \"practical\" and, in particular, \"applied\" ethics and the\n4 SAGE Open\ncognitive structures of individual thought.3 Anyone with a\npassing acquaintance with the social sciences can perceive\nthe relevance of the perennial debate concerning structure\nand agency and their role(s) in \"causing\" action(s) or, nowa-\ndays, producing \"practices\" (Schatzki, Knorr-Cetina, & von\nSavigny, 2000). In a social theoretical perspective, the indi-\nvidual and society are intertwined, inescapably enmeshed in\na (creative) process of mutual reproduction. Consequentially,\nwe might think similarly for \"morality,\" the normative char-\nacter of a particular society or culture, and \"ethics,\" a reflec-\ntive practice and generalized \"mode of thought.\" If we adopt\nthe terms ethos and eidos, this point can be given greater\nclarity. If we consider morality and ethics as, respectively,\nethos and eidos, then former can be taken to refer to the par-\nticular ethos of a social field or the normative character of\n\"thick culture.\" In contrast, ethics can be taken to refer to a\nculturally particular eidos or the characteristic way of ethical\nthinking found within a particular culture. Regardless of\nwhether such thinking is considered \"thick\" or, like bioeth-\nics, \"thin,\" it is always embedded in a particular culture or\nethos. As such, any eidos, any mode of thought, or socio-\nlogic4 is an aspect of ethos. Eidos names a part of ethos that,\nin some cases, it is useful to identify as it focuses our atten-\ntion on the nature of reason as a practice, something that is,\ntherefore, shaped by the socio-historical and cultural condi-\ntions of its production.\nWhile the term ethos and the idea of a society's moral\ncharacter are ripe for further exploration, it is, nevertheless,\na reasonably common idea, both in moral philosophy and in\nsociological and anthropological research. However, the\nconcept of eidos and the idea of characteristic way(s) of\n(ethical) thinking are relatively unexplored and require fur-\nther exploration. As I use it, eidos is an anthropological term\nand originates with Gregory Bateson (1958).5 However,\nwhile it is found in Madge's (1964) Society in the Mind:\nElements of a Social Eidos, few other authors have taken it\nup. Bateson's purpose was to explore the particular \"logic\"\nof Itamul culture and to do so in a manner related to its\nbroader ethos. However, partially due to its distance from\n\"ethos,\" he was dissatisfied with the term logic and, on\nreflection, realized that his conception of ethos could be\nsubdivided into \"ethos\" and \"eidos\" with the latter encom-\npassing the \"logic(s)\" of a particular culture (Bateson, 1958,\nthat \"ethos\" is holistic, collective, and affective or that\n\"eidos\" is individualistic and associated with cognition,\nreflection, and thought. Rather, while one is predominantly\nassociated with the affective and the other with the cogni-\ntive, both are dimensions of a particular cultural \"whole\"--\nwith a particular form of life (or, perhaps more accurately, a\nspecific mode of social life). Furthermore, even when appar-\nently individual, both are inescapably collective and, there-\nfore, social phenomena. While they can be conceptually\ndistinguished, they are not separable in practice; any eidos is\nalways part of an ethos.\nIn this view, morality and ethics, ethos and eidos, are both\nstructural aspects of a culture as well as of individuals situ-\nated within the relevant contexts. Thus, when Bateson (1958)\nuses the term eidos to name a \"general picture of the cogni-\ntive processes\" (p. 25) native to a specific culture and sug-\ngests that the \"eidos of a culture is an expression of the\nstandardized cognitive aspects of the individuals, while the\nethos is the corresponding expression of their standardized\naffective aspects\" (p. 33), it indicates that both can be per-\nceived in a variety of cultural artifacts as well as in the con-\ncrete practices (actions and interactions) of individuals. We\nshould, therefore, be able to read the ethical eidos of, say,\nmedicine into a wide variety of its cultural products, includ-\ning guidelines, procedural documents, editorials, and consul-\ntations. We might also adopt the view that differing\ndisciplinary approaches to ethics differ in their eidos and, in\nno small part, their (intellectual) ethos, what H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen\n(2009) terms the theoretical spirit of differing moral philoso-\nphies. Furthermore, given the connection between bioethics\nand the moral landscape of modern medicine, it can also be\nread in the discourse of applied ethics, particularly in venues\nwhere the ethical discourses of academics and professionals\nmeet. In suggesting that medical ethics is part of this broad\npicture of the eidos of medicine, we can begin to explore\nhow, and where, it connects with the ethos or thick moral\nculture of medicine. We can also explore how medical ethics\ndiffers when located in different social or cultural spaces;\nconsider the difference between medical ethics when pur-\nsued as part of applied ethics and when it is a part of medical\npractice (whether in clinic or as part of broader professional\ndiscourses). Consider also the connection or relationships\nbetween these modes of thought.\nPerhaps the most obvious, or simply succinct, example of\na bioethical eidos is Beauchamp and Childress's (2009) (four)\nPrinciples of Biomedical Ethics. Drawing on Bateson, Madge\n(1964) considers the eidos to be a \"predominant character of\nthe whole stock of ideas available in a society or group\" (p.\n13). \"Ideas\" are here regarded as \"elements in a repertoire or\nvocabulary of knowledge and belief\" (p. 111). Thus, while the\nfour principles of medical ethics might be the dominant rep-\nertoire or vocabulary--the preeminent stock of ideas--which\ncharacterize (bio)ethical thinking in modern medical practice,\nthere is more to the concept of the ethical eidos of medicine.\nWe might first suggest that what characterizes the ethical way\nof thinking of contemporary medical practice is its \"princi-\nplism\" rather than, simply, four principles. Although its initial\nintroduction to medicine was as a challenge to the moral ethos\nof the time (something we might call paternalism), the fact\nthat it has now been widely adopted by the health care profes-\nsions indicates that it has become part of medical culture.\nOver the past five decades, medical morality has developed in\nsuch a way as to be compatible with a principlist medical eth-\nics. Indeed, Brodwin (2008) recently positioned them as co-\nproductive. Thus, we can say that the particular ethical eidos\nthat exists within contemporary medical culture is related to\nEmmerich 5\nthat of practical ethics and, in particular, its preeminent form,\napplied ethics. Nevertheless, we can also maintain the view\nthat the morality of medical culture remains a more expan-\nsive concept. Medical morality is the broad normative struc-\nture of the field; it is its ethos. As an aspect of medical\npractice (and governance), the eidos of contemporary medi-\ncal ethics exists within, and is conditioned by, the ethos med-\nicine. This can be contrasted with medical ethics as an\nacademic mode of thought, the eidos of which is not embed-\nded in \"medical morality\" but the alternative ethos of various\nforms of practical and, in the particular case at hand, applied\nethics. In this context, theorizing ethical expertise does not\nsimply concern the specialist practice of applied ethics. If we\nare to articulate a notion of ethical expertise, we must do so\nby attending to its relation to the ethically non-expert indi-\nviduals, fields, and practices that applied ethics not only\ncomments upon but attempts to normatively shape.\nUbiquitous Expertise\nThe \"commonsense view\" of expertise is of something nec-\nessarily limited to a small section of the population and usu-\nally predicated on a body of technical knowledge. In contrast,\ncontemporary perspectives on expertise consider types of\nexpertise that can be assigned to the majority of individuals\nand do not require any technical knowledge. Thus, for exam-\nple, driving a car or even simple walking is considered to\ninvolve expertise or its performance. These abilities can be\nfurther expert when done in a particular social context; thus,\nwalking down a busy street or driving across a city involves\nnot only walking but also the additional expert task of nego-\ntiating traffic (people or cars). Such views have emerged\nfrom phenomenological critiques of early research into\nrobotics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the \"cognitive sci-\nTo accomplish our everyday activities, we must negotiate\nthe moral order or ethos of our socio-cultural setting(s). Our\nability to do so can be considered a form of ubiquitous exper-\ntise. For the most part, this negotiation is accomplished auto-\nmatically or intuitively. For example, we do not need to\nreflect on the requirement to thank those who assist us nor do\nthe Japanese have to reflect on how deep or long to bow\nwhen greeting a guest.6 Articulating a \"practice theory\" per-\nied beings, we perceive the normative aspects of social\nsituations directly. Thus, the ethos, or moral structure, of a\nsociety should be understood as coloring the individual's\nsocial perception. Indeed, pace Bourdieu's (1993) social the-\nory, we might consider ethos to be dispositionally embodied\nin habitus and, therefore, \"a morality made flesh\" (p. 86).\nCertainly, in some cases, our moral responses to social situa-\ntions are not simply a matter of habit, tacit knowledge, or\nintuition. Some situations require the articulation of reasons\nfor action, perhaps as part of the activity itself, while other\nsituations may actively provoke further reflection on what\nthe correct course(s) of action might be. In such situations,\nthe individual might reflect and decide, which is to say they\nmight make use of the relevant eidos, before acting. However,\nas this ability is common to all members of the relevant com-\nmunity, it remains a matter of ubiquitous expertise. While\nresearch has made it clear that individuals can be morally\ndumbfounded, this effect can be construed as demonstrating\nthat, in everyday life, our moral intuitions and reflective ethi-\ncal thinking usually work in concord with each other (Haidt,\nBjorklund, & Murphy, 2000). While not denying the exis-\ntence of \"reflective agency,\" such \"ordinary,\" \"everyday,\" or\n\"mundane\" ethical reflections can be considered part of our\nembodied moral response to particular social situations and\ncultural stimulus.\nWhile certain situations can provoke a reflective response,\nwe should be clear that this activity differs from the task of\napplied ethics. There is a tendency to assume that our every-\nday ethical thinking is simply a relatively undisciplined ver-\nsion of the philosophical analysis brought to bear on matters\nof practical ethics. This is a misguided assumption both\nempirically and within the theoretical picture being sketched\nhere (Hedgecoe, 2004). While the ethical eidos of a society is\nintertwined with its moral ethos, applied ethicists seek to\nremove any trace of the affective moral ethos from their phil-\nosophical analyses.7 The broader social ethos cannot be con-\nsidered that of the academic community any more than the\nbroader social eidos can be that of disciplined reflection.\nParticularly in its applied guides, practical ethics is the meth-\nodological attempt to construct \"objective\" ethical argu-\nments that are free of affective content. It is the ethicists'\nattempt to fully explicate their intuitive moral judgments\nand, therefore, render tacit moral knowledge explicit. Of\ncourse, the result is not merely a reflection of the original\njudgment or common morality but the production and pur-\nsuit of academic arguments. This is not something that can\noccur in the flow of everyday moral and ethical practice as\nthey are characterized by our tacit moral knowing and intu-\nitions. This remains the case even when we engage in every-\ndayethicalreflection,dialogue,anddebate.Suchubiquitously\nexpert practices should be understood on their own terms and\nnot through the disciplined lens of applied ethics.\nThe ubiquitous moral and ethical expertise of social actors\nis reiterated in the context medical practice and education.\nOne aspect of the education of medical students is their\nmoral socialization, a process of induction into the culture,\nnormative structure, and ethos medicine (Hafferty & Franks,\n1994). This process runs alongside the formal education of\nmedical students, including their formal education in medi-\ncal ethics. Attempts to integrate such ethical education into\nthe clinical context, that is, with the more informal aspects of\nmedical education, can be seen as an attempt to forge a peda-\ngogic connection between medical ethics and medical moral-\nity.Insuchacontext,wecanconsidertheethicalenculturation\nof medical students as something that runs alongside, and as\na compliment to, their moral socialization (Emmerich, 2013,\n6 SAGE Open\n2014). During their medical education and beyond, medical\nstudents become increasingly able to negotiate the ethos and\neidos of medicine. In the case of morality and ethics, this\nmeans they become increasingly able to perceive and respond\nto the normative structure of medicine and medical practice\nas well as to reflectively comprehend the issues at hand, that\nis, by reference to the principles of medical ethics, relevant\nguidelines, or other such formal ethical structures of the\nmedical profession. To successfully practice as doctors, med-\nical students must develop and (re)acclimatize their ubiqui-\ntous moral and ethical expertise relative to the ethos and\neidos of medicine.\nThis conception of ubiquitous moral (and ethical) exper-\ntise should not be mistaken for reflex responses lacking in\ncreativity. In the first instance, our set of habitual or habitu-\nated moral responses provides the basis for our ethical reflec-\ntions. Furthermore, such reflective practices are not free\nfrom habit. Habit or moral disposition should not be seen as\nthe antithesis of our (ethical) autonomy, rather they are a pre-\ncondition freedom; they provide an essential basis for impro-\nshould, then, think of medical professionals as having a par-\nticular habitus, something that should be seen to embody the\nrelevant ethos (Bourdieu, 1993).9 In using this term, there are\nobvious and reasonably felicitous resonances with\nAristotelian moral philosophy. However, it is also a term that\nhas undergone significant development (Crossley, 2013)\nboth at the hands of Bourdieu and others. Furthermore, Zahle\nthat normative states are directly perceptible, while Kukla\n(2014) recently used it in her analysis of \"common morality,\"\nwhat I would call ethos. Bourdieu (1992) defines habitus as\n\"a durable, transposable system of dispositions . . . principles\nwhich generate and organize practices and representations\"\n(p. 53). Bourdieu, and practice theory more generally, seeks\nto demonstrate how social life can appear to consist in rule\nfollowing but, in fact, nothing of the sort (Taylor, 1993). The\nhabitus and its dispositions are social structures and schemas\nincarnated; they are the embodiment of tacit knowing and, in\ninteraction with the social environment, the principle of the\n(re)production of practice(s).\nOne example of this is the (re)action of a General\nPractitioner (GP) who conscientiously objects when faced with\na patient request for an abortion. Such GPs do not find them-\nselves recapitulating the moral and ethical arguments about\nabortion, conscientious objection, and referring patients who\nmake such request to non-objecting colleagues each time this\neventuality occurs. Having made a decision to contentiously\nobject, perhaps through (more or less) extended reflection and\nanalysis of the matter or perhaps simply through a commitment\nto a (religious) authority or tradition, this is then put into prac-\ntice, which is to say the individual who conscientiously objects\nsimply follows the relevant protocol or the practice(s) that has\nbeen established for such cases.Again, I am not suggesting that\ndoctors behave as if they were automata. Such situations are\nnot devoid of a requirement to think, speak, and act. The\nindividual might, for example, need to explain their actions\nto the patient or other members of staff, but such thinking,\nspeaking, and acting are comprised of what Sch\u00f6n (1984)\ncalls reflection-in-action. In this view, reflection can be con-\nsidered a practice, an activity that is part of normal, everyday\nand mundane course of medical practice. It is, therefore, a\nproduct of habitus or, more accurately, the medical habitus of\nmedical professionals, as it interacts with the social context\n(field). Needless to say, this is a context that includes others,\ntheir (re)actions, and, therefore, practices required to support\nintersubjective coordination.\nAs medicine or health care is a particular and relatively\nautonomous sub-culture that is both of, but nevertheless dis-\ntinct from, modern society, members or \"natives\" of this cul-\nture possess a ubiquitous moral and ethical expertise not\npossessed by the population at large. Nevertheless, the abil-\nity of health care professionals to develop a ubiquitous moral\nand ethical expertise relative to their field of practice is pred-\nicated on an underlying moral and ethical expertise that is\nrelative to and ubiquitous in society at large. Of course, such\nculturally relative moral and ethical expertise is not necessar-\nily right or good. The morality of various European cultures\nin the early 20th century, including the medical culture of the\nUnited Kingdom (Booth, 1994), was anti-Semitic, and thus,\nmany members of these cultures were \"experts\" in negotiat-\ning and reproducing a morally flawed society. Ubiquitous\nmoral expertise is normative in the sense that members are\nrequired to conform to it, but that does not mean it is neces-\nsary, right, good, or the best form for such expertise, some-\nthing that is clearly troubling when considering a ubiquitous\nmoral and ethical expertise.\nThe Expertise of the Applied Ethicist\nAlthough it is important to recognize that our moral function-\ning is predicated on the ubiquitous moral expertise of indi-\nviduals going about their everyday lives, negotiating the ethos\nof their social and cultural contexts, this perspective is a pre-\ncursor or social and theoretical hinterland to my consideration\nof ethical expertise. An expertise in applied or even practical\nethics is of a different order to this ubiquitous, everyday or\nprofessional, moral expertise, even in its reflective guise.\nBioethics--the domain that applied ethics is most clearly\nassociated with--is a disciplinary practice with (inter)disci-\nplinary (multiple methodological) standards. Furthermore,\nalthough there might be an \"ethos\" or normative dimension to\nthe field,10 applied ethics is not itself the practice of morality.\nRather, bioethics is a theoretical practice, the theoretical prac-\ntice of ethics certainly, but not, in itself, a moral practice.\nFurthermore, it cannot be considered a moral practice of the\nkind with which it is concerned. For example, applied ethics\noften involves the analysis of the ethical problems of medical\npractice, but it does not, itself, put those analyses or conclu-\nsions into (professional) practice; individual ethicists have no\nEmmerich 7\nmedical responsibility and, therefore, are not enmeshed in\nthe morality of medicine and health care more generally.\nIn thinking through the idea of ethical expertise, some\nclarity can be found if we consider the distinction between\ncontributory and interactional expertise; concepts have been\nrecently developed in the context of conducting sociological\nresearch into scientific practice (Collins & Evans, 2007). The\nfirst specifies the kind of expertise it takes to contribute to a\ndiscipline, to engage in the relevant practices, and to produce\nthe relevant products and outputs, while the second encapsu-\nlates the fact that some individuals have a high degree of\nknowledge such that while they are unable to engage in the\npractices of a particular discipline, they are capable of dis-\ncursively interacting with its practitioners at a high level.\nSuch interaction is fundamentally social and predominantly\nlinguistic; it involves discussing the discipline and its topics.\nThese are the kinds of discussion that occur during the more\nsocial moments of disciplinary life--those that take place in\nthe lunch hour, at the conference (including, to a degree, pre-\nsentations as well as during wine receptions), and in more\npublic domains, such as in the media or in \"popular\" science\nbooks. The contemporary emergence of \"science communi-\ncation\" and science communicators is an excellent example\nof interactional expertise (Reich, 2012).\nHowever, as Collins and Evans have recently made clear,\ninteractional expertise is not expertise in interacting. Rather,\n\"interactional expertise means grasping the conceptual struc-\nture of another's world\" (Collins & Evans, 2014, p. 14, Note\n3). Such expertise is, then, dependent on having some grasp\nof their mode of social life and the ethos of their practices.\nThus, in attempting to place ones ethical expertise in the ser-\nvice of another, we face challenges comparable with those\nfaced by anthropologist. First, is it possible to evaluate a cul-\nture if we are not, ourselves, members, and second, is it pos-\nsible to do so ethically? The fact that, like applied ethics,\nmedical culture can be considered a sub-culture means that\nsuch concerns are somewhat dampened, at least as compared\nwith their importance within anthropology. Nevertheless, the\npoint remains: If the commentaries and arguments of applied\n(bio)ethicists are to guide the ethical structures of the medi-\ncal profession and the actions of medical professionals, then\nthey must have a sense of its ethos. Such a sense is required\nfor them to properly grasp the conceptual structure of medi-\ncal practice and, therefore, subject to it to a morally compre-\nhensive analysis.\nContributory Expertise\nAn individual has a contributory expertise when he or she is\nable to contribute to a discipline. We might suggest that, in\nits strongest form, this means an ability to produce outputs\nthat signify a particular form of expertise. In the case of\napplied ethics, this can be considered an ability to produce\narticles that meet the relevant peer-review standard. However,\nwhile this perspective is instructive, this is to focus on the\nproduct of expertise rather than the expertise itself. Expertise\nis what allows experts to produce such outputs. By way of an\nexample, consider Michelangelo's David. Michelangelo is,\nwe might say, an expert sculptor as evidenced by the statue\nof David. However, Michelangelo's expertise in sculpting is\nwhat produced David, it is not the statue of David itself.\nMichelangelo's expertise was embedded within his practice\nof sculpting, and thus, we must consider the practices that\nbioethicists engage in. Contributory ethical expertise con-\nsists in whatever ethical experts do to produce peer-reviewed\npublications, the sine qua non of the disciplinary practice.\nIf we reflect further on the production of David, we might\nthink that, despite his supposed claims to the contrary,\nMichelangelo did not simply set to work on a piece of marble\nand reveal David. Similarly, no one simply sits down and\nwrites an article by conceiving an argument and writing it\ndown. The task of writing an article does not involve simply\nstarting with the introduction and working ones way toward\na conclusion. There is a great deal of preparation, of back and\nforth, of wrong turns and dead ends, and, ultimately, of edit-\ning, rewriting, and polishing. We might think of the wider\npractices involved in the production of academic publica-\ntions. They are quite mundane and include reading articles;\nthinking; reflecting on cases and thought experiments; pre-\nsenting ones work; talking with colleagues, students, and\nothers, including contributory experts, interactional experts,\nand those who might have little more than a ubiquitous moral\nand ethical expertise or who are undertaking to learn about\n(bio)ethics; talking to those with other forms of relevant\nexpertise such as medical and health care professionals or\n\"expert\" patients; and so on. All these tasks can and do con-\ntribute to the process of developing an argument, and to reit-\nerate, no ethicist simply sets out to write an academic article\nwith the entire argument in mind.\nThus, the process of writing is the process of crafting an\nargument. The pen, the typewriter, the post-it note, the scrib-\nbled in book, and the word processor are the tools of aca-\ndemic labor, and we do not use them to simply express our\nthoughts but to develop them. We do not simply think and\nthen write, we think through writing (Shore, 1999). The arti-\ncle is not the product of thought or of writing but of mutually\nconstitutive thinking and writing. The implicit conclusion is\nthat academic articles do not represent what the author\nthinks, or, at least, they cannot be taken to represent what the\nauthor thinks or thought at any one time. Rather, as with the\nsculpture, articles are the final product of an extended, dia-\nchronic, and complex process of thinking, writing, rethink-\ning, and rewriting. Articles and the ethical arguments\ncontained within them have been fashioned and not simply\nexpressed. An article is crafted, produced by a process that\ninvolves a variety of tasks, all of them involving some form\nof expert performance; some form of expertise.11\nThe conclusion one might draw is that any expertise is\nembedded within processes and practices not simply within\nindividuals or products. Certainly, individual experts have a\n8 SAGE Open\nhigh level of knowledge and experience; one cannot simply\nparticipate in a community of experts and expect to be able\nto authentically reproduce (as opposed to merely emulate,\nimitate, or copy) the expert practices that define a commu-\nnity. Nevertheless, it is through a process of emulation and\nimitation--or, one might say, through a process of \"appren-\nticeship\"--that the expert is created. Even in the case of\nthose expert practices that are most clearly based on a large\ndegree of technical and factual knowledge, such as medical\npractice, it is what the individual can do with their knowl-\nedge, the ways in which they can put that knowledge into\npractice, which makes them a contributory expert. Just as the\nmedical student becomes a medical professional through a\nprocess of socialization (and enculturation), the bioethicist is\nsimilarly reproduced. Perhaps because it is primarily cogni-\ntive in character, or perhaps because it lacks a clearly defined\nand concrete `field of practice,' the idea that becoming an\nexpert ethicist is an essentially \"social\" process has been\nneglected almost entirely. Thus whilst the fact that applied\nethicists undergo a process of socialization of is much less\nobvious than it is in the case of, say, medical doctors (cf.\nHafferty & Franks, 1994). However, it is clearer that the\nreproduction of expert ethicits is essentially cultural\n(Bourdieu, 1990). The task facing the nascent ethicist is to\ngain entry to a (very) particular cultural institution, the acad-\nemy and, furthermore, one of its sub-domains--a particular\n(inter)discipline.12 The task of becoming a contributory\nexpert in applied ethics is, therefore, more obviously a pro-\ncess of enculturation. Such statements do not undermine the\nacademic seriousness of a discipline, its methodological (or\nepistemological) rigor, or the relevance of and commitment\nto various academic and scientific (in the continental sense\nof the term) values, such as objectivity, to the practice of eth-\nics. It does not undermine the nature of bioethics any more\nthan it would were we to note the same about expert ballet\ndancers, physicists, health care professionals, or sculptors. It\nis simply to note that what is involved in the development of\na methodologically disciplined and contributory expertise in\nethics, or any other academic domain (such as medicine,\nsay), is to become an initiate, to become an accepted member\nof a culture, or, better, to be initiated into a community of\nInteractional Expertise\nThe notion of interactional expertise names an individual\nwho is more or less fluent in the everyday discourse of con-\ntributory expert. While contributory experts possess this\nform of expertise, it can also be found in those who do not\nhave the requisite ability (or inclination) to contribute to\nsome discipline (Collins & Evans, 2007). As suggested,\ninteractional expertise does not involve being expert at social\ninteraction per se but, rather, involves \"grasping the concep-\ntual structure of another(s) world\" (Collins & Evans, 2014,\np. 14, Note 3). In the case of morality and ethics, this notion\ncan be considered in a variety of ways. First, we might exam-\nine the connection and interaction between ethical expertise\nand the ubiquitous moral expertise of the population at large.\nSecond, we might consider the interaction of expert ethicists\nwith medical and health care professionals both as expert\npractitioners in the domain the bioethicists seek to comment\non and as having a distinct, (sub)culturally relative, form of\nubiquitous moral and ethical expertise. These complications\nexpress a common concern in bioethics, namely, the relation-\nship between \"common\" (and medical) morality, on one\nhand, and applied (bio)ethics (and moral philosophy), on the\nIn the terms I have been using, this is a concern for the\nrelationship between our everyday moral ethos, the ethos of\nmedicine and health care, and, ultimately, the ethos of applied\nethics (and moral philosophy). However, while the matter is\nmore complicated in the case of the relationship between\nmoral philosophy and \"common morality,\" we might sup-\npose that the primary interaction between formal ethical\nexpertise and the practical moral expertise of health care pro-\nfessionals can be located in the interaction between their\nrespective eidos, their ways of ethical thinking. This is some-\nthing that is clearly related to the conceptual understanding\nthat structures their respective perspectives on morality and\nethics.\nGiven the relationship between applied ethics and ethics\nin medical practice, we should be unsurprised to find that\nthere are a number of individuals who can be considered\ncontributory experts in both domains. There are many indi-\nviduals who contribute to the discipline of applied ethics\nwhile also having the requisite expertise to engage in (or\ncontribute to) medical practice. Such individuals possess\nmore than the ubiquitous moral and ethical expertise that\npertains to medicine and, literally, are an embodiment of\ninteractional ethical expertise as well as the interaction\nbetween bioethics and medicine, or health care, more gener-\nally. Since its inception, bioethics has been conceived of as a\npractical endeavor; one of its central aims is to contribute to\nthe moral and ethical practices of others, particularly health\ncare professionals. Applied ethics has been part of the field,\nand a significant part of it aims to be practical. We might take\nthis as indicating that an interactional expertise is a central\naspect of bioethical expertise itself. This is because bioethics\nseeks to influence and engage with domains beyond its aca-\ndemic and disciplinary borders. To do so, the requisite inter-\nactional expertise must be acquired, something we might\nthink of as acquired independently from the development of\na contributory bioethical expertise, but nevertheless as fall-\ning squarely within the central tasks of bioethics and applied\nethics.\nThis point is not a simple one. All disciplinary experts\nmust possess some degree of interactional expertise if they\nare to engage in the social and cultural practices that sur-\nround and constitute some of the practices, such as teaching,\nthat are required to be a contributory expert. However, if\nEmmerich 9\nethical experts are to engage with those who exist outside of\napplied ethics, they will have to develop an interactional\nexpertise that pertains to domains other than their own and\nallow this to become an aspect of their own contributory\nexpertise. In the context of science journalism, Reich (2012)\ndiscussed a similar idea, suggesting expert journalists pos-\nsess a \"bipolar\" interactional expertise that is constitutive of\njournalism and, therefore, of their own contributory exper-\ntise. Thus, their interactional expertise is \"bipolar\" because\njournalists are expert at interacting with both academic\nsources and in communicating with the public or lay audi-\nences; they are expert at taking information from one context\nand \"translating\" it into another. This is an ability that\nrequires them to have interactional expertise in two, if not\nmore, domains. However, in the case of ethical expertise,\nsuch interaction poses a challenge as what is on offer is not\nonly normative but normative in two senses. It is not only\ndirective in the sense of being substantively action-guiding\nbut in the sense of being methodologically prescriptive--it\ndoes not just suggest what decisions should be taken but how\nthose decisions should be taken. What applied ethics has to\noffer is not restricted to substantive ethical arguments and\npositions but particular ethical concepts and modes of think-\ning. The disciplinary nature of applied ethics is such that it\nsuggests that ethics ought to be done from its particular per-\nspective, from within its particular ethos (and associated\neidos), and not from the perspective of, say, medical moral-\nity. Nevertheless, no more than they can expect their substan-\ntive ethical conclusions to be taken at face-value, ethical\nexperts cannot expect methodological compliance to simply\nbe forthcoming. Only through bringing competing ethical\nframeworks, moral perspectives, and conceptual structures\ninto dialogue and debate can ethical experts expect to make\npositive (and ethical) contribution to the broader ethical dis-\ncourses of the medical professional and the practices of\nhealth care more generally.\nIn this context, we might consider the role of the \"consul-\ntant\" or \"clinical\" (bio)ethicist, as found in many American\nhospitals. Such individuals may not be contributory experts in\nmedical practice, applied ethics, or any other bioethical domain.\nHowever, we might consider them as possessing a high level of\ninteractional expertise with applied ethics, practical ethics, and\nbioethics more generally, as well as the cultural domains of\nmedicine and health care. Similar to Reich's analysis of science\njournalism, we might consider the consultant bioethicist to\nhave a bipolar interactional expertise; they can negotiate the\nrespective ethos of bioethics and medicine so as to relate their\n(not unrelated) conceptual ethical structures or eidos. For the\nmost part, they can be considered as \"translators\" of an \"aca-\ndemic worldview\" such as that of applied ethics--of its per-\nspectives, methodology, principles, arguments, judgments, and\njustifications--in such a way that they become more relevant,\ncomprehensible, and aesthetically \"palatable\" to clinicians,\nhealth care professionals, and patients.This is primarily accom-\nplished through an engagement with clinicians, health care\nprofessionals, and patients ideally on their own terms, that is,\nin such a way as to be consistent with the ethos and eidos of\nhealth care and to accord with the patient's particular under-\nstanding and perspective. The contributory expertise of such\nconsultant bioethicists is a \"bipolar\" interactional expertise,\nthe ability to bring the conceptual structures of a particular\nform(s) of academic practice into dialogue with the more\nimmediate and practical context of medical practice and its\nethos.\nIf we return to consider the applied (bio)ethicist while we\nmight suggest that they must also have some degree of inter-\nactional expertise with medicine and health care, at least to\nthe degree that they can understand \"the medical case,\"13\nthey may never direct experience or negotiate the moral\nworld of a particular hospital or a particular medical ethical\ndilemma. However, if they are to be successful in their\nattempts to intellectually engage with the medical and health\ncare professional, they must interact with medical morality;\nthey must have some interactional grasp of the ethos and, in\nparticular, the eidos of medicine, with the conceptual struc-\nture of its reflective ethical practices. However, the gap\nbetween the intellectual interaction and practical experience\nremains. Collins and Evans's (2007) conceptualization of the\ndifference between polimorphic and mimeomorphic actions\ncan be used to capture this point. Such activities are, respec-\ntively, social and representational and, therefore, correlated\nwith our practical and reflective abilities. Polimorphic activi-\nties are inescapably bound up in thick social and cultural\ncontexts. In contrast, mimeomorphic actions are such that\nthey can be (re)presented as asocial or acultural.14 One of the\nbest examples of this is the difference between simply riding\na bike (or bike-balancing) and riding a bike across a city.\nEngineers can model the former such that they can construct\na machine that can accomplish the same task. The latter\nnecessitates social and cultural interactions between the\nrider, the environment, other road users, and pedestrians. It,\ntherefore, necessitates thick social, cultural, and intersubjec-\ntive understanding that is beyond the capabilities of any mere\nMedical practice and, therefore, the ethical issues that\narise within it take place in a polimorphic context. However,\nthese same ethical issues are given what we might call a\nmimeomorphic representation within bioethics and, in par-\nticular, applied ethics.16 This idea requires a good deal more\nexamination than the account I can offer here. However, it is\nsufficient to point out that when ethical issues arise in prac-\ntice, they involve specific patients, particular doctors, and\nhealth care professionals, all of whom are socially, culturally,\nand historically situated and stand in particular relationships\nto one another. The eidos of applied ethics is to eliminate or\nignore this context, perceiving it to be extraneous to ethical\nanalysis. Consequentially, the \"cases\" of medical ethics are\noften populated by roles rather than individuals and by those\nassigned a generalized \"personhood,\" or moral status, rather\nthan by people considered as concrete individuals.\nThe underlying conception of the ethical subject of\napplied ethics, and related approaches to ethical analysis, is\nthat of the Cartesian rational actor. Consider, for example,\nRawls's (1999) veil of ignorance or the debate about \"per-\nsonhood\" (Tooley, 2010). This approach is taken further by\nmany paradigmatic examples that form the foundations of\nbioethics and bioethical thinking, that is, its eidos. Consider\nJames Rachels's (1975) \"Bathtub Case\" as an attempt to rep-\nresent the distinction between killing and letting die and\nactive and passive euthanasia. Alternatively, consider the\nargument Thomson (1971) presents with regard to \"The\nViolinist\" and the way it purports to encapsulate the ethical\nissues that surround abortion. Finally, consider the way organ\nmarkets are justified, the demonstrative and experimental\npurpose of Trolley Dilemmas, and the various ways in which\nindividuals can be morally dumbfounded (Erin & Harris,\nmimeomorphic representations of ethical \"reality,\" they are\nall constructed for the purposes of illuminating our ethical\nintuitions and (at best) their interplay with our ethical reason-\ning in producing ethical judgments.\nSuch cases seek to starkly represent those factors consid-\nered to be ethically relevant while preventing any other fac-\ntor from being an obstacle to our understanding. As such,\nthey require us to respond in a certain way, from within a\ncertain ethos, namely, a mimeomorphic one. It is against the\nrules of the game to introduce polimorphic social life into the\nexamples by, say, insisting on the gendered nature of the ethi-\ncal subject hidden behind the veil of ignorance, wondering\nabout the character of a person who would not kill his nephew\nbut would \"merely\" let him die, questioning the social differ-\nences between a violinist attached to an individual and a\nfetus growing within a woman's womb, pointing out that no\nmarket can be mimeomorphic in practice, suggesting that no\none who encountered the trolley dilemma in \"real life\" could\never be entirely sure the fat man would dislodge the carriage,\nor taking the view that no one could truly be sure that the\nsiblings would not experience negative emotional conse-\nquences after having sex with each other. When actually\nencountered, all ethical dilemmas are polimorphic; they\ninvolve real people, with real histories and relationships,\nwith open and uncertain futures. This is not to say that repre-\nsenting ethical dilemmas mimeomorphically is flawed or has\nnothing to contribute to the ethical issues embedded within\nconcrete polimorphic practices. Clearly, they do. However, it\nis to say that the way in which bioethical analysis seeks to\n\"encounter\" ethical dilemmas is different from the way they\nare, in fact, encountered. The practices of applied ethics are\nnot the sum total of ethics, let alone moral practice.\nIn representing ethical cases, applied philosophical bio-\nethics strips out the moral ethos of medicine focusing on the\neidos as a way to fully concentrate on \"the ethical.\" One\nresult is that we can distinguish between the ubiquitous\nmoral and ethical expertise of health care professionals from\nthe contributory expertise embodied by the \"practical\" or\napplied philosophical (bio)ethicist. Nevertheless, the various\nforms of expertise, and the individuals who possess them,\nnecessarily meet and interact, giving rise to various forms of\ninteractional expertises that inform both the ubiquitous poli-\nmorphic (interactional, affective, and cognitive) moral and\nethical expertise of health care professionals and the mimeo-\nmorphic (reflective and predominantly cognitive) ethical\nexpertise of the bioethicist.\nConclusion\nIn the context of psychiatry, Brodwin (2008) argued that\nmedical morality and bioethics are co-productive.17 This\nview gives further color to Toulmin's (1982) claim that med-\nicine saved the life of ethics and, I think, holds true across the\nmedical specialties and health care professions more gener-\nally. There is a reflexive and mutually supportive relation-\nship between the ethical eidos of modern medicine and\n\"applied ethics\" or (normative) bioethics. From a historical\npoint of view, one might suggest that in the late 1960s, eth-\nics--in the broad sense of theology, law, and philosophy--\nwas fused with medicine and subsequent developments, not\nleast an increasing secularization of the medicine and the\npublic sphere, and gave further impetus to practical, norma-\ntive, and applied (bio)ethics. This phenomenon has contin-\nued to develop and mutate since that time, reflexively\ninfluencing several of its source disciplines and wider soci-\nety as a whole. So successful was this fusion that bioethics\ncan rightly be called a cultural phenomenon and one that has\ninfluenced not only its culture of origin, American medicine,\nbut also American and other (trans)national cultures as a\nwhole (Wilson, 2014). Bioethics has also given rise to vari-\nous forms of contributory and interactional expertise and\nfundamentally altered the ubiquitous moral and ethical\nexpertise of health care professionals by fundamentally alter-\ning the conceptual structure of health care practice, which is\nto say by significantly affecting its culture.\nThrough distinguishing different forms of moral and ethi-\ncal expertise, we can renew our appreciation for the connec-\ntion between applied (bio)ethics and forms of common\nmorality, particularly medical morality. The analysis of ethi-\ncal problems offered by applied ethicists are mimeomorphic\n(re)constructions of those encountered in practice. In so\ndoing, the thick polimorphic social reality or ethos in which\nthose problems are embedded is neglected. Thus, there is a\nqualitative difference between encountering (and thinking\nabout) an ethical problem in practice, conducting an aca-\ndemic analysis and the respective expertise required for each\ntask. On this ground, we can differentiate between the moral\nresponsibilities of health care professionals and the scope of\nthe ethical authority of the expert ethicist. The expert analy-\nsis offered by ethicists has limited scope and, therefore, can-\nnot authoritatively determine the ethics of acting within a\nthick moral context. This being the case, there is a space\nwithin which we can maintain the moral and ethical authority\nof the individual actor while acknowledging the ways in\nwhich ethics offers expert analysis and, ideally, a form of\ndialogical engagement rooted in an interactional form of\nethical (and moral) expertise.\nThis view indicates that \"applied ethics\" is not and cannot\nbe the sum total of \"ethics\" or ethical practice. It can often\nseem that applied ethics is positioned as the way to do ethics.\nHowever, pace Narvaez and Lapsley's (2005) critique of\nphenomenalism, it is erroneous to view only those actions\nundertaken reflectively as \"moral\" or \"ethical.\" The view I\nhave presented here encourages recognition of our \"mun-\ndane\" and \"everyday\" moral and ethical practices, practices\nthat exhibit varying levels of intuition as well as reflection.\nIn my view, such activities are best understood as being dis-\npositional, a function of habitus, and, therefore, as intimately\nrelated to the social, cultural, and structural conditions that\nproduced the relevant dispositions and habitus (Emmerich,\n2013). Bioethics and, indeed, applied ethics is a central part\nof the social, cultural, and structural conditions within which\nthe professional practices of contemporary health care takes\nplace. Thus, we must seek to understand the relationship\nbetween the moral practices of health care and the expertise\nof bioethics in cultural and social theoretical terms. The con-\nceptual foundation developed above offers one way in which\nwe might do so.\nFurthermore, expert ethicists and bioethicists must seek a\nsimilar understanding of the way in which they contribute to\nthe moral and ethical dimensions of medicine and health\ncare. The academic literature is not the entirety of this con-\ntribution. Ethicists can, do, and should interact with medical\nand health care professionals in a variety of fora including\nconferences, committees, and via process that can and do\n(re)form professional and institutional guidelines. Such fora\nare, however, not opportunities for professionals to be\nturned into (applied) ethicists or to be shown how to do eth-\nics \"properly.\" We must abandon the idea that professionals\nsimply ought to make ethical decisions in a manner that imi-\ntates the arguments contained in academic articles or,\nindeed, the methodology of applied ethics. This idea must\nbe abandoned because it is not the case that health care pro-\nfessionals can make decisions in this way. Even if, thanks to\nbioethics, we consider the respective ethical eidos of medi-\ncine and applied ethics to be related, their respective ethos\ndiffers significantly. Finally, while interactional expertise is\nnot an expertise in interacting, social interaction is vital if\ninteractional expertise is to be realized, exercised, and exer-\ncised well. If academic (bio)ethics is to engage with medi-\ncine (and vice versa) to the fullest degree possible, then the\ndevelopment of an expertise in interacting, in bringing these\ntwo worlds and their conceptual structures together in a par-\nticular discursive context, and in a practical, mutually\nenlightening manner has a lot to recommend it. I imagine\nthis is an important facet in the success, or otherwise, of\nbioethics consultations and, in my experience, of clinical\nethics committees.\nTo be clear, such experts and practices exist. However, the\nmethodological conceits of applied ethics have, thus far, con-\nstrained our understanding of the nature of such endeavors.\nMedical and health care professionals are not, and cannot be,\nexpert applied ethicists. However, by bringing the expertise\nof applied ethicists and health care professionals into dia-\nlogue, which is to say interaction, there is opportunity for\nmutually enlightening experiences and for expert (bio)ethi-\ncists to properly contribute to the moral and ethical recon-\nstruction of health care.\nNotes\n 1. Rather than suggesting ethics or Moralit\u00e4t is eidos, it would\nbe more accurate to say that eidos represents the socio-logic of\nMoralit\u00e4t or ethics--a point I make in more detail below.\n2. While a fuller account of ethos and eidos is needed, they\nmust be articulated and defended on their own terms, consis-\ntent with the intellectual and theoretical practice of sociology\nand anthropology; this must proceed hand in hand with their\ndeployment in concrete attempts at socio-analysis. My use of\nthem here is as part of one such project.\n 3. As Doris and Nichols (2012) have pointed out, the cognitive\nsciences, moral psychology, and, one might add, empirical\nethics uncritically adopt the asocial individualism that is the\nprevailing assumption of modern moral philosophy. The thesis\npresented here is consistent with their recommendation that\nthe role of human sociality in morality and ethics, and the col-\nlaborative nature of reason, ought to be more fully explored.\n 4. The term socio-logic or sociological is used to emphasize the\nway in which eidos refers to the logic of practice rather than\nwhat Bourdieu (1992) calls the logic of the logician. It refers\nto the normative sociological order--or ethos--within which\npractices, including the practices of thought, are organized or\nstructured. The eidos is not thought itself, but the embodied\nand tacit dimensions of thinking out with explicit reflection\ncannot be considered to take place. Thus, computers do not\nthink or reflect; they calculate. See the distinction between\nmimeomorphic and polimorphic drawn below.\n 5. Bateson's, and therefore my, use of the term has almost nothing\nto do with the phenomenological conception of eidos. One might\nalso add that it has little to do with the way Aristotle uses the\nterm. That said, there is a sense is which Bateson means eidos\nto capture the essence of a culture, at least insofar as its logic or\n\"way of thinking\" can be considered as part of this essence.\n6. Narvaez and Lapsley (2005) discuss the \"principle of phe-\nnomenalism,\" the tendency of moral philosophy (and moral-\nized psychology), to define moral behavior as that motivated\nby moral judgments, thereby ruling out automatic or intuitive\nmoral responses as being rightly categorized as \"moral.\" They\nargue for a \"psychologized morality\" and, therefore, adopt an\nexpanded conception of \"the moral\" similar to the one at play\nin this article. In a not dissimilar manner, Abend (2013) argues\nfor the importance of an expanded conception of morality in\nsocial studies of the phenomenon. My use of the term ethos\naims to fulfill a similar function. However, it is balanced by the\nterm eidos, which I use to maintain a focus on formal ethical\nthinking as the phenomenon of particular interest in the study\nof ethical expertise.\n 7. If, as Anderson (2005) has suggested, contemporary academic\nculture inhabits an \"anti-ethos ethos\" (p. 173), then we might\ntake applied philosophical (bio)ethics to be a particularly illu-\nminating example. As such bioethics cannot be considered\nas unproblematically objective--as \"a-cultural\" or \"a-polit-\nical\"--but, rather, inhabiting a complex culture of ethical\nobjectivity, that is, one where objectivity is understood to be\na cultural or disciplinary value, an aspect of its ethos. Such a\nview is, I think, consistent with Miller's (2003) analysis of the\nethos of expertise as involving the transformation of ethos into\nlogos, a transformation that facilitates the denial of ethos.\n 8. While the idea that habit is the antithesis of freedom or auton-\nomy is widespread, it is, as a tranche of recent publications\nhave amply demonstrated, not only fundamentally mistaken\nbut in conflict with the concepts of history (Carlisle, 2014;\n 9. The idea that an ethos/habitus is a morality made flesh is con-\nsistent with the broader conception of morality that I have\nadopted here. It is also worth noting that in this passage,\nBourdieu also rejects the notion of eidos, something he previ-\nously drew upon in a manner similar to my own (and, there-\nfore, Bateson's). However, it is a term he later readopts and\ndoes so in a way that gives me confidence in the term as I use\n10. Consider, for example, Daston's (1995) analysis of \"The Moral\nEconomy of Science\" and how her perspective can inform our\nunderstanding of any disciplinary practice, including bioeth-\nics and its various sub-practices such as applied philosophical\nbioethics, feminist ethics, empirical ethics, and so on.\n11. This point is consistent with the view that journal articles \"are\nnot themselves examples of explicit knowledge. They are,\nrather, the means by which explicit knowledge is transmit-\nted. They are like the germs which cause a disease rather than\n12. We might distinguish between what is required of an (applied)\nethicist if they are to join a philosophy department and a\nmedical faculty. Nevertheless, the point reinforces the cultural\nnature of the academy and the place of bioethics and bioethi-\ncists within it.\n13. Perhaps in a manner analyzed by Anspach (1988) whose per-\nspective in this matter can be transferred to the medical ethi-\ncal case as a kind of genre (Chambers, 1999, p. 3; Emmerich,\nactions, activities, or, as I will be discussing, representations\nmay contain elements of culture. A bicycle is, obviously, a\ncultural artifact. Nevertheless, bike riding (balancing) can be\nrepresented mimeomorphically, and therefore, a machine can\nbe programmed to accomplish the task. Similarly, the philo-\nsophical examples discussed below contain elements of cul-\nture, a bathtub, a violinist, a market, a trolley. Nevertheless,\nthese examples are all attempts to (re)present ethical dilemmas\nmimeomorphically.\n15. We need not make the claim that no machine could ever be con-\nstructed that could ride a bike across a city in traffic. Rather the\nclaim is that if we made such a machine, and it appears Google\nhas gone some way to doing so in the case of a self-driving\ncar, then it would accomplish the task in a mimeomorphic\nmanner. It would be completing the same activity but not the\nsame action. The introduction of such cars will alter the rules\nof the road and may even make it impossible for human beings\nto safely drive.\n16. We might understand alternative approaches to ethical analy-\nsis, such as feminist ethics, as attempts to develop and rein-\ntroduce a degree of polimorphicity to the mimeomorphic\nrepresentations created by and underlying the approach\nadopted by applied philosophical bioethics.\n17.
