A concomitant\nincrease in reported rabies cases in skunks has raised con-\ncerns that an independent maintenance cycle of rabies\nvirus in skunks could become established, affecting current\nstrategies of wildlife rabies control programs. Rabies sur-\nhealth departments of 11 eastern states were used to ana-\nlyze temporal and spatial characteristics of rabies epi-\nzootics in each species. Spatial analysis indicated that epi-\nzootics in raccoons and skunks moved in a similar direction\nthat the number of rabid raccoons predicted the number of\nrabid skunks through time, with a 1-month lag. In areas\nwhere the raccoon rabies virus variant is enzootic, spatio-\ntemporal analysis does not provide evidence that this\nrabies virus variant is currently cycling independently\namong skunks.\nIn North America, variants of rabies virus are maintained\nin the wild by several terrestrial carnivore species,\nincluding raccoons, skunks, and a number of bat species.\nEach antigenically and genetically distinct variant of the\nvirus in mammalian species occurs in geographically dis-\ncrete areas and is strongly associated with its reservoir\nspecies (1). Within each area, a spillover of rabies into\nother species occurs, especially during epizootics (2). As a\nresult of spillover, a variant may eventually adapt to a sec-\nondary species, which may begin to serve as an alternative\nreservoir species. This phenomenon of spillover and cross-\nspecies adaptation has been inferred from historical rela-\ntionships (2) but is poorly understood and not routinely\ninvestigated.\nIn the late 1970s, an epizootic of raccoon rabies was\nreported on the Virginia/West Virginia border attributed to\nthe translocation of raccoons from the southeastern United\nStates (3). This epizootic has spread northward and south-\nward throughout the eastern United States (Figure 1a,b).\nThe establishment of rabies in this species has raised pub-\nlic health concerns about an increased risk for rabies trans-\nmission to the human population because the raccoons are\nwell adapted to living at unusually high densities in urban\nand suburban environments (4,5). As a novel potential con-\ntrol method, several states have initiated raccoon vaccina-\ntion programs using an oral rabies vaccine (6\u00ad9).\nBeginning in 1990, a concomitant increase in the num-\nber of cases of skunks infected with the raccoon rabies\nvirus variant has occurred in these states (Figure 1c,d).\nAdditionally, these cases appeared to be preceded by cases\nin raccoons, both temporally and spatially. Moreover, in a\ngrowing number of counties in Massachusetts and Rhode\nIsland, the number of rabid skunks has surpassed the num-\nber of rabid raccoons. Whether the increasing number of\ncases in skunks is a result of spillover from raccoons or the\nraccoon rabies virus variant has begun to circulate inde-\nRESEARCH\nSkunk and Raccoon Rabies in the\nEastern United States: Temporal\nand Spatial Analysis\nMarta A.

Counties with at least one rabies epizootic among rac-\npendently within the skunk population remains unclear.\nThe establishment of an independent cycle of rabies in the\nskunk population may have serious consequences for\nrabies vaccine baiting programs because the current oral\nvaccine for raccoons is not as effective in skunks (10).\nThe epizootiology of raccoon rabies in the eastern\nUnited States has been investigated in several states,\nMaryland (14,15). Models have been developed to\ndescribe the spatial and temporal patterns of raccoon rabies\nepizootics (16\u00ad18). Several studies have also described the\nbehavior of skunk rabies epizootics in western North\ning raccoon and skunk rabies studies show that epizootic\npatterns appear to differ between skunks and raccoons,\npossibly because of differences between the species, rabies\nvirus variants, or environmental factors. However, no doc-\numented studies exist on the relatively recent increase of\nrabies in skunks caused by the raccoon rabies virus variant\nin the eastern United States. In light of the recent efforts to\nimplement rabies control programs for raccoons in the\neastern United States, the epizootiology of raccoon rabies\nvirus variant occurring in skunks in this part of the country\nneeds to be better understood.\nThe objectives of this study were to describe the epi-\nzootiology of skunk rabies in the eastern United States,\ndetermine if skunk and raccoon rabies epizootics are asso-\nciated spatially and temporally, and introduce methods to\nassess evidence of spillover of rabies from raccoons to\nskunks compared with independent cycling of the virus\nwithin the skunk population.\nMaterials and Methods\nSurveillance Data\nRabies case data for raccoons and skunks for each\ncounty by month from 11 states (Connecticut, Delaware,\nMaryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North\nCarolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, and West\nVirginia) were used for analysis. Only counts of rabid ani-\nmals per county were used because not all counties report-\ned total numbers of animals submitted for testing. The\nobservation period for each county started when the first\ncase of raccoon or skunk rabies was reported, with a max-\nreduced the variability of reporting within a county that\nmay be observed when an epizootic arrives. The unit of\nanalysis was the number of laboratory-confirmed rabies\ncases in raccoons and skunks reported per month by coun-\nty. To identify counties that had an appreciable number of\nskunks infected with rabies, analysis was restricted to\ncounties that reported at least 12 rabid skunks within 12\nmonths of first detecting rabies in skunks. This average of\none rabid skunk per month corresponded to the 90th per-\ncentile of all counties reporting at least one rabid skunk,\nand 36 counties met this criterion. Upon examination, one\ncounty was excluded because of geographic isolation in\nthe western part of Maryland (Garrett County) that would\nhave severely biased the spatial analysis, and three coun-\nties in New York (Clinton, Franklin, and Oswego) were\nexcluded because rabies found in skunks was the result of\nspillover from a red fox epizootic emerging from Canada\nDescriptive Analysis\nRabies epizootics among skunks and raccoons in the 32\ncounties used for our analyses were identified by using the\nfollowing algorithm: an epizootic began when the month-\nly number of rabid animals reported was greater than the\ncounty's monthly median for two consecutive months and\nended when this number was less than or equal to the\ncounty median for two consecutive months (16).\nAdditionally, an epizootic had to be at least 5 months in\nduration. In calculating a county's monthly median num-\nber of rabid animals, months occurring before the appear-\nance of the first rabid animal were excluded. For example,\nif rabid skunks first appeared in a county on June 1, 1994,\nthen the months before were excluded for calculation of\nthe skunk median. In that same county, if rabid raccoons\nappeared on December 1, 1993, then the months before\nwere excluded from calculation of the raccoon median.\nThe size and length of epizootics were compared between\nspecies by a Wilcoxon rank sum test. The Kolmogorov-\nSmirnov two-sample (KS) test was used to assess season-\nal differences in the number of rabies cases by species.\nTemporal Analysis\nA series of Poisson regression models were used to fur-\nther explore the relationship between the number of rabid\nskunks and rabid raccoons. The outcome variable was\ndefined as the log number of rabid skunks. The predictor\nvariables were the number of rabid raccoons, time (contin-\nuous, 1\u00ad140 months), and calendar month of report. The\ntime variables started at 1 with the appearance of the first\nrabid animal (skunk or raccoon) and continued for up to a\ntotal of 140 months (maximum number of months of\nobservation). All counties had at least 72 months of fol-\nlow-up, and 50% had more than 107 months of follow-up.\nTo smooth each time series, a moving average of the num-\nber of rabid animals was calculated on the basis of the\npresent and previous month's observations for both species\nand used for subsequent analyses. A time-squared term, an\ninteraction term of time by number of rabid raccoons and\nindicator variables for county and calendar month of\nreport, was included in the model. The effect of repeated\nRESEARCH\nmeasures by county was controlled in the analysis by using\na generalized estimating equation (25). Lag periods of 0 to\n5 months for the number of rabid raccoons were intro-\nduced and assessed to identify any improved fit in the\nPoisson regression model, as determined by comparing the\nlog likelihood values. The model with the highest (less\nnegative) log likelihood value was chosen as the best fit-\nting model.\nThe full Poisson regression model can be represented as\nLog (# of skunks) = 0\n(# of raccoons\nt-i\n(t) +\n(t*# of raccoons\nt-i\n) + j\n(county\nj\n) + k\n(month\nk\n)\n+ E\nwhere\nt = time in months (starts at 1 with first appearance of rabid\nskunk or rabid raccoon in each county and ends with a\ni = 0\u00ad5 lag time in months\nj = 31 indicator variables representing the 32 counties used\nin the analysis\nk = 11 indicator variables representing months, with\nDecember being the reference group\nE = residual error.\nSpatial Analysis\nTo determine if skunk and raccoon epizootics were\ncenter of the counties reporting a rabies case was deter-\n(Crimestat, Department of Justice). The standard devia-\ntional ellipse was also calculated, showing the dispersion\nin two dimensions (Crimestat) of the mean centers. The\ndistance between mean centers of successive years by\nspecies was calculated by the Pythagorean theorem. The\ndirection between mean centers was calculated by convert-\ning latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates into the\nUniversal Transverse Mercator projections of eastings and\nnorthings. On dividing the difference in eastings by the dif-\nference in northings, the arctangent was calculated (26),\nyielding the angle (degrees) between the mean centers.\nThe angle was then converted to degrees from the refer-\nence angle of 0\u00b0(true north). The resulting series of vectors\n(Figure 2) was used to determine if the mean centers by\nyear for each species were moving in a similar direction.\nThe Watson-Williams test (27) was applied to test for a dif-\nference in the angle of rotation between the mean centers\ndetermine if the epizootic direction of spread differed\nbetween the species. The cumulative mean direction (rota-\ntional angle that summarizes a series of vectors through\nsuccessive years) and circular variance of the mean centers\nwere also calculated (Crimestat).\nResults\nDescriptive Analysis\nraccoon (Table 1). The median number of reported rabid\nraccoons was greater than that for skunks (p<0.0001).\nThree hundred thirty-nine counties (68.5%) reported rabies\nin both skunks and raccoons. Within these counties, rabid\nrabid skunks preceded rabid raccoons in 30 counties\n(8.8%), and rabid skunks and raccoons were first reported\nin the same month in 12 counties (3.5%). The median\ninterval between the initial appearance of rabid raccoons\nand skunks was 14 months and ranged from \u00ad108 months\n(i.e., rabid skunks preceding rabid raccoons) to 177\nmonths.\nOf 344 counties with at least one reported rabid skunk,\n36 counties had at least 12 rabid skunks appearing in the\nfirst 12 months after the first rabid skunk appeared. Four\ncounties were omitted for reasons described in the\nMethods section. In these 32 counties used for more\ndetailed analysis, rabid raccoons preceded skunks in 30\n(93.8%) counties, rabid skunks preceded raccoons in 1\n(3.1%) county, and both skunks and raccoons appeared in\nthe same month in one county (3.1%). The median interval\nbetween the appearance of rabies in raccoons and skunks\nwas 5 months, and ranged from \u00ad2 months to 13 months.\nIn the four omitted counties, rabid raccoons preceded\nskunks in two counties, and rabid skunks preceded rac-\ncoons in the remaining two counties.\nRESEARCH\nFigure 2. Magnitude and direction (vectors) of successive mean\ncenters of counties from 11 mid-Atlantic states reporting rabies\nFor all 32 counties, the peak number of rabid raccoons\nreported was reached by 21 months; the median interval\nfrom the first case to the peak number of cases was 10.5\nmonths. In contrast, the interval from the first to the peak\nnumber of skunks ranged from 6 to 90 months, with a\nmonth when the peak was reached did not exhibit a pattern\nfor rabid raccoons, whereas for rabid skunks there was a\nstrong tendency for the peak to be reached in the last quar-\nter of the year.\nAnalysis of epizootic characteristics found differences\nbetween the first epizootics of each species (Table 2). The\nfirst raccoon epizootic was significantly larger (medi-\nzootics among raccoons and also significantly greater than\np<0.0001). However, after the first epizootic, the epi-\nzootics converged and characteristics did not differ, with\nthe exception of the third epizootic, in which the duration\nand magnitude were lower for skunks than for raccoons. In\ngeneral, the size of subsequent epizootics among raccoons\nshowed damped oscillations, while skunk epizootics\nappeared uniform.\nTemporal Analysis\nOverall, a significant relationship existed between the\nnumber of rabid raccoons (RACCOON) and the number of\nrabid skunks (SKUNK) (Figure 3, Table 3). Specifically, a\nsignificant interaction existed between time and RAC-\nCOON on SKUNK with the effect of RACCOON on\nSKUNK increasing with increasing time. The fit of the\nmodels improved significantly when a 1- or 2-month lag\nfor RACCOON was used to predict SKUNK; however, the\nlag of 1 month provided the best fit. The time-squared term\nwas not significant and was dropped from subsequent\nmodels. A month by RACCOON interaction was also test-\ned and did not significantly improve the model fit. At the\nbeginning of the time series, the peak in SKUNK coincid-\ned with the larger peak in RACCOON. In the period of\napproximately 25 months to approximately 50 months, the\nsharp reduction in RACCOON and coincident reduction in\nSKUNK was well below model predictions. A second peak\nin SKUNK at approximately 55 months and 70 months\ncoincided with the increase in RACCOON associated with\na second epizootic among raccoons. The model predictions\nreflected this increase, but the predicted SKUNK fell\nbelow the actual SKUNK for the peak months. In addition\nto a positive correlation with RACCOON over time,\nSKUNK displayed a strong seasonal component with\nannual peaks occurring in the fall months (Figure 4). These\nstrong seasonal peaks were unique to skunks, and not pres-\nAmong the 32 counties used for Poisson regression\nanalysis, four counties in Massachusetts exhibited a gener-\nRESEARCH\nTable 1.

A separate model was\nfit to determine potential differences between these coun-\nties and the 28 other counties that did not exhibit a signif-\nicant increase in rabid skunks over time. The modeling\nresults did not differ among these counties compared with\nthose for the other 28 counties.\nSpatial Analysis\nAs determined by previously described methods that\nused vectors (Figure 2), the mean centers of the counties\nfirst reporting rabies in both species were in Maryland in\n(Figure 5b).

The cumulative mean directions of the epi-\nDiscussion\nThis study examined the relationship between the\noccurrence of rabies in skunks and raccoons in the eastern\nUnited States. The present analysis indicated epizootic\ncycles of 4\u00ad5 years for raccoons and skunks, consistent\nwith previous studies of rabies in raccoons (16,17) in this\nregion. In comparison, studies of the epidemiology of\nskunk-variant rabies among skunks from the Midwest\nreported epizootic cycles with periods ranging from 4 to 5\nvirus becomes established in eastern skunk populations,\nthe periods of epizootic cycles in skunks may subsequent-\nly decouple from those of raccoons so that independent\ncycles among skunks may be observable. However, differ-\nences in the periodicity of cycles between these species\nmay be caused by many factors, including differences\nbetween the variants, resulting in changes in incubation\nperiod, transmission potential, and duration of disease.\nThe spatial analysis performed in this study indicated\nthat skunk rabies epizootics in the eastern United States are\nclosely coupled to epizootics in raccoons. These epizootics\nmoved in similar directions and traveled similar distances\nas they progressed upwards along the eastern seaboard.\nThe mean centers of epizootics in each species originated\nnear Maryland and are now situated near the Virginia/West\nVirginia border as of 2000 (Figure 5a,b). The southwester-\nly movement is of concern as the raccoon epizootic\nencroaches areas in the Midwest, where the skunk virus\nvariant predominates.\nThe Poisson regression analysis showed a statistically\nsignificant association between the number of rabid\nskunks and raccoons through time. The association was\nweakest during the first months, apparently due to the large\nnumber of rabid raccoons that are characteristic of initial\nrabies epizootics in raccoons (16). After the initial peak in\nnumbers at approximately 15 months, both species exhib-\nited a secondary peak at 60 months, consistent with the\nern United States. After 80 months, the number of peaks in\nboth species diminished in size and increased in frequen-\nRESEARCH\nFigure 3.

Of note, howev-\ner, were the four counties in which rabies cases in skunks\nwere outnumbering those in raccoons near the end of our\nstudy period. In these counties, rabies cases in skunks\nbecame less sporadic: cases were regularly reported\nthroughout the year but the annual peaks in the fall months\nremained. As surveillance continues for these four coun-\nties, current observations suggest that skunks may be act-\ning as important secondary hosts of the raccoon rabies\nvirus variant in certain geographic areas of the eastern\nUnited States and that the potential for independent cycles\nto emerge exists.\nAlthough we varied the time variable between raccoon\nand skunk rabies from 0 to 5 months, the best fitting\nregression model resulted from using a 1-month lag time.\nThis lag time is consistent with the generally accepted\nincubation period for rabies of 3\u00ad8 weeks (29), which\nwould permit at least one cycle of virus multiplication\namong raccoons before transmission from raccoons to\nskunks. The regression model also showed that reports of\nrabid raccoons remain fairly constant by month throughout\nthe year. In contrast, the number of rabid skunks showed\nan independent seasonal pattern that consistently peaked\nduring the fall months (Figure 4). In the Midwest, where\nrabies is endemic in skunks, the major peak is in late win-\nter and early spring, with a smaller peak in the fall (20,28).\nThe peaks in winter and late spring have been attributable\nto the breeding season, and the fall peak to dispersal of\njuveniles (23). Why a dominant fall peak is apparent in the\neastern states is not clear at this time. However, during dis-\npersal, skunks may have increased contact with more rac-\ncoons, thereby increasing the risk for transmission of\nrabies. The absence of a spring peak may indicate little to\nno transmission between skunks in communal winter dens\nand during the breeding season.\nSkunks and raccoons coexist within the same geograph-\nic areas in different ecologic niches. Raccoons are social\nanimals that are capable of existing in fairly high densities\nin close proximity to human habitation and prefer forested\nhabitats (4,5,15). Skunks are rather solitary animals and are\nfound in lower densities than raccoons (23). Skunks prefer\ngrasslands (21), agricultural areas (30), and interfaces\nbetween agricultural and nonagricultural lands (22). These\ncharacteristics would suggest that contact between the two\nspecies should occur less frequently than among those of\nthe same species. However, since rabies affects the central\nnervous system, rabid animals may exhibit aberrant behav-\niors, leading to increased contact between the species and\ncross-species transmission of the virus.\nMonitoring rabies among skunks in regions where the\nraccoon rabies virus variant circulates has important impli-\ncations for public health intervention programs. To control\nthe spread of the raccoon rabies epizootic, an oral rabies\nvaccine-baiting program has been implemented in several\nstates (7\u00ad9,31) after the successful development of a vac-\ncinia virus recombinant vaccine expressing the rabies virus\nglycoprotein gene (V-RG) for raccoons (6,32). The oral\nvaccine has been effective in raccoons. However, as for-\nmulated for raccoons, it has not been proven to be as effec-\ntive for preventing rabies infection in skunks (10).\nAdministration of intramuscular rabies vaccines has been\nRESEARCH\nFigure 4. Proportion of rabies cases by month for each species,\nFigure 5. The mean centers and standard deviational ellipses\n(SDE) of counties reporting rabies in skunks and raccoons in the\nmid-Atlantic States.\nshown to be effective in controlling rabies in skunks (5),\nbut this method is labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive. The\nemergence of independent maintenance or cycling of rac-\ncoon-associated rabies virus within skunks would necessi-\ntate the development of alternative strategies to control\nrabies within wildlife populations. At least one vaccine\ncandidate (33) designed for skunks has been identified but\nwill require further development for this species and pre-\nvent spillover of rabies back into the raccoon population.\nCurrently, we have no evidence that the raccoon rabies\nvirus variant is cycling independently in the skunk popula-\ntion of the eastern United States or that the variant has\nundergone any genetic adaptations among skunks.\nHowever, epizootic rabies in skunks was first reported in\n6\u00ad8 years, it may be too soon to detect decoupling of rabies\ncycles in skunks and raccoons. Surveillance and monitor-\ning must continue through several cycles to further evalu-\nate additional epizootics for changes in patterns.\nAdditionally, scant information exists on the population\ndensities and behavior patterns of skunks and raccoons in\nthe eastern United States. Field investigations to assess the\nincidence of rabies in wildlife populations have rarely been\nconducted. Further research is needed to evaluate environ-\nmental factors that can affect the population density and\nstructure, the behavior of both raccoons and skunks, and\nfactors influencing interactions between them. Finally, the\ngenetics of the raccoon rabies virus variant should be mon-\nitored for changes that might indicate cross-species adap-\ntation after spillover into skunks. Assessment of these\nchanges and continued surveillance can provide important\nguidelines to ensure the success of oral rabies vaccination\nprograms for the control of rabies in wildlife and to\ndecrease the risk of acquiring rabies among the human and\ndomestic animal populations.\n"
