For the same seasons, we ob-\ngeneral US population aged 13 years and older and 8.10,\nand older. Thus, persons with AIDS had excess death rates\nsubstantially higher than the general US population and\nsimilar to, if not somewhat higher than, the general US\npopulation aged 65 years and older, a group that is al-\nready targeted for annual vaccination. The findings were\nsimilar when we compared the preinfluenza season with\nthe influenza season.\nConclusions: Persons with AIDS have significant ex-\ncess mortality due to pneumonia or influenza during in-\nfluenza seasons and should be considered a high-risk\ngroup that is targeted for the prevention of influenza.\nmorbidity and mortality in vari-\nous high-risk groups, including\npersons with chronic cardiopul-\nmonary disease, diabetes melli-\ntus, and advanced age and those residing\nin long-term care facilities. However,\nthere is limited information concerning\nthe impact of influenza on morbidity and\nmortality in persons with human immu-\nnodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or\nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome\n(AIDS). Previous reports1,2 suggested\nthat influenza may severely compromise\nrespiratory function and cause pro-\nlonged duration of illness in patients\nwith HIV infection, but, until recently,\ninformation regarding the impact of\ninfluenza on this patient population has\nbeen largely anecdotal.1-5 Because of\npotential for substantial benefit, the\nAdvisory Committee on Immunization\nthat HIV-infected individuals receive\nroutine vaccination against influenza.6,7\nHowever, this policy has been some-\nwhat controversial,8 and its implemen-\ntation in clinical settings has not been\nwidespread, as demonstrated by low\nvaccination rates.9 Barriers to successful\nvaccination efforts may include uncer-\ntainties regarding immunogenicity of\nthe vaccine in patients with HIV infec-\ntransient increases in HIV viral load fol-\nthe largest influences on the poor rates\nof immunization has been the persistent\nuncertainties concerning the magnitude\nof risk posed by influenza among per-\nsons with AIDS or HIV infection. For\nthis reason, we conducted this study to\nassess influenza-related excess mortality\nin persons with AIDS.\nFrom the Medicine Service and\nCenter for Chronic Disease\nOutcomes Research, Veterans\nAffairs Medical Center and the\nDepartment of Medicine,\nUniversity of Minnesota\nMedical School, Minneapolis.\n\u00a92001 American Medical Association.

Of\nthe persons who died, 85% to 89% were male and more\n15% of the persons, pneumonia or influenza was listed as\nthe underlying or one of the contributing causes of death.\nThe influenza seasons extended from November\nto pneumonia or influenza among adults and adoles-\ncents with AIDS followed a seasonal pattern, with peaks\ngenerally occurring during the months of December and\nJanuary. This pattern paralleled the seasonal variability\nseen for deaths due to pneumonia or influenza among\nadults and adolescents in the general US population and\nalso followed the seasonal pattern for positive influenza\nisolates in the United States (data not shown).\nMETHODS\nThe Multiple Cause-of-Death data files22-23 are released an-\nnually by the National Center for Health Statistics and con-\ntain detailed information for each of the approximately 2.2\nmillion deaths occurring every year in the 50 United States\nand the District of Columbia. Information in the database\nis derived from US certificates of death and includes de-\nmographic variables, such as age, race, sex, and geo-\ngraphic area, as well as cause-of-death information. Cod-\ning of the underlying cause and contributing causes of death\nfor the data files is accomplished using rules established\nby the World Health Organization that are applied to the\ninformation obtained from the death certificates. This cod-\ning is increasingly automated, thus reducing or eliminat-\ning intercoder variation. Use of information regarding not\nonly the single underlying cause of death, but also the con-\ntributing causes of death, can be particularly valuable in\nachieving a more accurate portrayal of mortality. In some\ncases, deaths are attributable to a number of concurrent dis-\nease processes for which a single underlying cause of death\ninsufficiently accounts for the interactions between chronic\nor coexisting conditions and the immediate cause of death.\nPrevious publications22-27 have described the details, po-\ntential uses, and limitations of the data files.\nFrom the Multiple Cause-of-Death data file for 1991-\n1994, we calculated the number of deaths due to pneumo-\nnia or influenza each month for adolescents and adults (ie,\npersons aged 13 years and older) with AIDS. Deaths were\nclassified as being due to pneumonia or influenza (ICD-\n9-CM [International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revi-\nor influenza was listed either as an underlying or contrib-\nuting cause of death in the file. Persons were classified as\nhaving AIDS if the ICD-9-CM codes consistent with AIDS\nsurveillance case definitions also appeared in the data file\n[AIDS-related complex] to 044 [other HIV disease], with\nmention of 1 or more of the AIDS clinical indicator dis-\neases identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-\nenza seasons and corresponding baseline periods, the 1993\nexpanded surveillance case definition of AIDS was used.\n(For the 1993 case definition, the CDC added pulmonary\ntuberculosis, recurrent pneumonia, and invasive cervical\ncancer to the list of indicator clinical conditions.30)\nFor comparison, we tabulated the number of deaths\ndue to pneumonia or influenza (ICD-9-CM codes 480-\n497) by month for all adults and adolescents in the gen-\neral US population. We also tabulated these data for 2 ad-\nditional comparison groups: the general US population 65\nyears and older (a high-risk group currently targeted for\nannual influenza vaccination) and the general US popula-\noccur in this age group).\nInfluenza seasons were defined using national influenza sur-\nveillance data collected by the World Health Organization\ncollaborating laboratories in the United States.31-33 For each\nmonth from October to May for the years included in this\nstudy, we identified all months for which the total num-\nber of influenza isolates was 5% or more of the season's to-\ntal influenza isolates. All these months constituted the in-\nfluenza period for each study year.\nWe used 2 baseline periods for establishing baseline pneu-\nmonia or influenza death rates. One, the preinfluenza base-\nline period, was defined as the 2 months immediately pre-\nceding the influenza season for each study season. The other,\nthe summer baseline period, was defined as the June through\nSeptember immediately preceding each influenza season.\nBecause national influenza surveillance spans October\nthrough May, data for the number of influenza isolates were\nnot available for the summer months. However, influenza\nactivity is assumed to be minimal during the summer.\nWe calculated excess deaths attributable to pneumonia or\ninfluenza during each influenza season by taking the differ-\nence between those deaths occurring each month in the in-\nfluenzaseasonandthemonthlyaverageoftheprecedingbase-\nline period. The total excess deaths for each influenza period\nwerecalculatedasthesumoftheexcessdeathsforeachmonth\nduring the influenza period. We calculated the excess deaths\nrates per 10000 by dividing the total excess deaths for each\ninfluenza season by the estimated number of living persons\naccording to population estimates derived from the 1990 US\ncensus34 for the general population and from estimates from\nthe CDC35 for persons with AIDS aged 13 years or older in\nthe 50 United States and the District of Columbia. We as-\nsumed that the distribution of deaths followed a binomial\ndistribution, and we calculated 95% confidence intervals for\nthe death rates, as recommended by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics.23\n\u00a92001 American Medical Association.

These excess death rates were 6.9 to 14.1 times\nhigher than the excess death rates due to pneumonia or\ninfluenza observed among adults and adolescents in the\ngeneral US population and were even somewhat higher\nthan, although of similar magnitude to, those seen for\npersons 65 years and older in the general US population\n(Table 2).\nDuring the same influenza seasons, there were 166,\nor influenza in persons with AIDS, compared with the\npreinfluenza baseline periods (Table 2, Figure). These\nexcess deaths corresponded to excess death rates of 12.56,\ncents with AIDS. These excess death rates were 8.5 to 10.3\ntimes higher than the excess death rates due to pneumo-\nnia or influenza observed in adults and adolescents in the\ngeneral US population. Similar to the comparison to the\nsummer baseline period, these rates were even some-\nwhat higher than those seen for the general US popula-\ntion 65 years and older (Table 2).\nThe general US population aged 25 to 54 years was\nselected as an additional comparison group as more than\n90% of AIDS deaths in our study occurred in this age\ngroup. We found that the excess death rate from pneu-\nmonia or influenza was 81 to 155 times higher among\nadults and adolescents with AIDS than for the general\nUS population aged 25 to 54 years compared with the\nsummer baseline period. Similarly, when using the pre-\ninfluenza period as the baseline, we found that the ex-\ncess death rate for adults and adolescents with AIDS was\nCOMMENT\nWehaveshownthatadultsandadolescentswithAIDShave\nsubstantial excess mortality due to pneumonia or influ-\nenza during influenza seasons. The excess death rates from\ninfluenza or pneumonia per 10000 persons are compa-\nrable to if not greater than those for the general US popu-\nlation 65 years and older, a high-risk group that is al-\nready targeted for routine annual influenza vaccination.\nPrevious studies have attempted to define the im-\npact of influenza or influenza-related illnesses on morbid-\nity and mortality in persons with HIV infection. In one case\nreport2 of a child with HIV infection and one case series1\ndescribing 6 HIV-infected patients from whom influenza\nvirus was isolated, the authors suggested that patients with\nHIVinfectionmayexperiencemoresevererespiratorycom-\nplications and prolonged duration of illness. In one study36\nthat examined hospital use for patients with AIDS in the\nstate of New York, the authors noted that the length of hos-\npital stay was 2.8, 1.1, and 2.4 days longer in January (typi-\ncallywheninfluenza-relatedmorbidityandmortalitypeaks\nnationwide) compared with June during 3 consecutive\nyears, but they made no comment concerning the fre-\nquency of hospitalization, reasons for admission, or rates\nof death. Recently, Neuzil et al37 demonstrated increased\nhospitalization rates for cardiopulmonary causes during\ninfluenza season in women with HIV infection. This ret-\nrospective population-based cohort study of women en-\nrolled in the Medicaid program for the state of Tennessee\ndemonstrated influenza-related excess morbidity in pa-\ntients with HIV infection. Of all women with high-risk\nchronic conditions, the risk attributable to influenza was\nshown to be highest among those with HIV infection. This\nstudy estimated the hospitalization rate for influenza-\nfection. According to their estimates, women with HIV in-\nfection were 50 to 75 times more likely to be hospitalized\nforinfluenza-relatedmorbiditycomparedwithwomenaged\n15 to 64 years who were without high-risk chronic con-\nditions. Our study augments these findings by defining in-\nfluenza-associated excess mortality for the entire US ado-\nlescent and adult population with AIDS.\nOther investigators have used several different types\nof baseline periods to estimate excess outcome rates as-\nsociated with influenza. These periods have included sum-\ndemicinfluenzaseasonswithlowratesofinfluenza activity\nas defined by relatively flat curves for mortality due to\nTable 1.

As\nexpected, the use of 2 different baseline periods re-\nsulted in somewhat differing point estimates for excess\nmortality rates but identical conclusions regarding the\nsubstantially increased risk among persons with AIDS\ncompared with the general US population.\nWe used both underlying and contributing causes of\ndeath to estimate the total number of deaths due to pneu-\nmonia or influenza. According to Barker and Mullooly,44\nup to one half or more of pneumonia-associated deaths\nmay be attributed to underlying chronic medical condi-\ntions on death certificates. Consistent with these find-\nings, our estimated number of excess death due to pneu-\nmonia or influenza based on both underlying and\ncontributing causes of death are approximately twice those\nobtained if only deaths with pneumonia or influenza as\nthe underlying cause were included (data not shown).

The use of these and other files\nbased on death certificate data is standard for tracking\nnational mortality trends,48 including influenza-\nassociated excess mortality.49,50 It is believed that more\nthan 99% of deaths occurring in the United States are reg-\nistered.23 However, several limitations of death certifi-\ncate data deserve comment and necessitate interpreting\nour study results with some caution. Previous stud-\ncates fail to mention AIDS as the underlying or contrib-\nuting cause of death among persons with known AIDS.\nTherefore, it is possible that we underestimated the num-\nber of deaths occurring among persons with AIDS. This\npossible underestimation may explain why our esti-\nmates of the total number of deaths due to AIDS were\non average 11.5% lower than those estimated by the\nCDC.35 Such an underestimation of deaths would most\nlikely have resulted in an underestimation of the excess\ndeath rates due to pneumonia and influenza that we re-\nported. In addition, death certificates may not list pneu-\nmonia or influenza even when they were a cause of death.\nIn one study,44 16% of death certificates for persons who\ndied of pneumonia or influenza did not mention pneu-\nmonia or influenza. If it occurred, underreporting pneu-\nmonia and influenza on death certificates during the years\nof this study would probably also have resulted in un-\nderestimation of excess death rates. The presence of an\nAIDS diagnosis, especially among persons with pulmo-\nnary opportunistic infections, may also have contrib-\nuted to a detection bias leading to more frequent listing\nof pulmonary infections, such as bacterial pneumonias,\non the death certificate than might be seen in the gen-\neral population. However, if present, such a bias was prob-\nably most relevant in establishing the baseline rate of death\ndue to pneumonia or influenza. We found no evidence\nof seasonal variability in the listing of pulmonary oppor-\ntunistic infections as underlying or contributing causes\nof death among persons with AIDS (data not shown).\nThus, our use of excess death rates above the baseline\nrate likely minimized the impact of any detection bias.\nAnother limitation of the present study is that it en-\ncompasses years that predate the advent of highly active\nantiretroviral therapy, which was not widely used to treat\npersons with HIV infection in the United States until 1996.\nSince the introduction of highly active antiretroviral\ntherapy, morbidity and mortality from HIV disease and\nvarious associated opportunistic infections have de-\ncreased significantly.53 Therefore, it is unclear whether\nthe magnitude of risk that we identified in this study will\nbe present in future years.\nOur findings suggest that the magnitude of influenza-\nrelated excess mortality in persons with AIDS is compa-\nrable to, if not greater than, that seen among the general\nUS population aged 65 years and older, a high-risk group\ntargeted for annual influenza vaccination. Although vari-\nous reports13-21 have provided conflicting results of\nwhether influenza vaccination transiently increases HIV\nviral load after immunization, the clinical relevance of\nthis short-lived phenomenon is unclear. To our knowl-\nedge, no detriment in clinical outcome has ever been\nshown to be associated with this transient viremia.\nQuestions also persist concerning the efficacy of vac-\ncination in a patient population characterized by de-\nfects in cellular and humoral immunity. However, until\nrecently assessments of vaccine efficacy10-15 have been\nbased on laboratory measurements of antibody re-\nsponse, as opposed to clinical measurements of the pro-\ntection that vaccination provides. One double-blind, pla-\ncebo-controlled trial54 in patients with AIDS and HIV\ninfection showed that influenza vaccination was associ-\nated with a 93% efficacy against laboratory-confirmed in-\nfection and a 100% efficacy against symptomatic illness.\nEven in the subgroups of participants with CD4 counts\nless than 200/\u00b5L, 20% of those who received the vaccine\nvs 50% of those who received placebo experienced res-\npiratory symptoms.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this study, adults and adolescents with AIDS had sub-\nstantial excess mortality due to pneumonia or influenza\nduring influenza seasons. The mortality risk attribut-\nable to influenza in this population was comparable to\nthat of the general US population 65 years or older. In\nthe absence of any clear evidence to suggest that influ-\nenza vaccination is clinically harmful to persons with HIV\ninfection and AIDS and in light of new information dem-\nonstrating protective efficacy provided by vaccination,\nour findings support recommendations for annual vac-\ncination of persons with AIDS.\nCorresponding author and reprints: Kristin L.\nNichol, MD, MPH, Medicine Service, Veterans Affairs Medi-\n(e-mail: nicho014@tc.umn.edu).\nREFERENCES\n1.
