The effect of TBV and LAM treatment on serum\nALT was assessed using standard mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nResults: The meta-analysis included six studies (TBV n \u00bc 202; LAM, n \u00bc 208). Post-treatment ALT\nlevels were significantly lower than pretreatment values for both TBV and LAM (TBV: SMD \u00bc 3.00,\nConclusion: Both LAM and TBV are effective in normalizing ALT levels in patients with CHB, but\nTBV may be a better choice due to its lower rates of drug resistance.\n",

No\nlanguage restrictions were set in this meta-\nanalysis. When articles provided unclear add-\nitional data in their original publications, the\nfirst authors were contacted for clarification.\nSelection criteria\nTo be included, studies had to fulfil all of the\nfollowing criteria: (i) patients with CHB;\n(ii) human clinical cohort studies or diag-\nnostic tests focused on CHB diagnosis with\nadministration of LAM or TBV; (iii) pre and\npost-treatment data for serum ALT levels;\n(4) report adjusted standard mean differ-\nences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals\n(CI) for ALT serum level; (5) number of\npatients stated; and (6) >20 patients. When\nstudies had populations overlapping >50%\nwith two or more papers, the one with the\nmost comprehensive population was\nincluded. When the same authors published\nmore than one study with the same popula-\ntion, only the latest or most complete was\nincluded. All authors approved the final list\nof included studies.\nData extraction\nData were extracted from the included\nstudies by two investigators (M.D. and\nG.M.X.) independently and in duplicate. If\nnecessary, consensus was achieved by dis-\ncussion and re-examination. The following\ndata were extracted from eligible studies:\nsurname of first author; date of publication;\nsource of publication; study type; study\ndesign; sample size; age; sex; ethnicity and\ncountry of subjects; source of samples;\ndetection method for ALT serum level;\ntime of post-treatment sampling; serum\nALT levels; and HBV DNA levels.\nQuality assessment\nQuality of the included studies was assessed\nby two investigators (F.L.W. and J.S.Z.)\nindependently and in duplicate, using pre-\ndefined criteria based on Newcastle-Ottawa\nScale (NOS) criteria.24 The NOS criteria are\nbased on three aspects: (i) subject selection\n(0\u00ad4); (ii) comparability of subjects (0\u00ad2);\n(iii) clinical outcome (0\u00ad3). Total NOS\nscores range from 0 (lowest) to 9 (highest).\nAccording to the NOS scores, the included\nstudies were classified as low quality (0\u00ad6) or\nhigh quality (7\u00ad9). Discrepancies regarding\nNOS scores were resolved by discussion and\nconsultation with an additional reviewer\n(D.J.X.).\nStatistical analyses\nThe effect size of each study was calculated\nusing Z test with summary SMD (95%CI).\nHeterogeneity was evaluated using\nCochran's Q-statistic (P < 0.05 was\nregarded as statistically significant),25 and\nimal heterogeneity).26 If between-study het-\nerogeneity existed, the random-effects model\n(DerSimonian and Laird) was used to cal-\nculate the pooled ORs; otherwise the fixed-\neffects model was used (Mantel\u00adHaenszel).\nMeta-regression and subgroup meta-ana-\nlyses were performed for detection method\nand postreatment time. One-way sensitivity\nanalysis was performed and publication bias\nwas assessed using funnel plots and Egger's\nlinear regression test.27 Data were inputted\ninto STATA\u00d5 software (version 12.0; Stata\nCorp, College Station, TX, USA) by two\ninvestigators (Y.M.L. and H.Z.Y.) inde-\npendently and in duplicate.\nResults\nThe study selection procedure is displayed in\nFigure 1.

Post-treatment\nALT levels were significantly lower than\npretreatment values for both TBV and\nsubgroups (P < 0.05 for each comparison).\nIn the !24 weeks subgroup, post-treatment\nALT levels were higher in patients treated\nwith LAM than in patients treated with\nbetween-group differences in the <24\nweeks subgroup.\nSensitivity analyses indicated that the\nmeta-analysis was stable (Figure 4). Funnel\nplots and Egger's test found strong evidence\nfor publication bias in the comparison\nbetween pre-TBV and post-TBV treatment\nALT levels (P < 0.001). There was no evi-\ndence of publication bias in the comparison\nbetween pre-LAM and post-LAM treatment\nALT levels, or in TBV vs LAM treatment.\nDiscussion\nThe current meta-analysis compared the\nrelative efficacy of TBV and LAM in the\ntreatment of CHB infection (assessed via\nserum ALT levels), and found that both\ndrugs significantly reduced ALT compared\nwith pretreatment levels. In addition, TBV\nresulted in a significantly greater decrease in\nALT levels than LAM.\nStudies have shown that LAM can\nimprove liver histology and suppress viral\nDNA replication in patients with CHB after\n1 year of treatment, with reversal of cirrhosis\nand fibrosis observed after 3 years.34\nAlthough LAM has a good safety profile\nin the treatment of HBV infection, resistance\n(and accompanying viral breakthrough,\nTable 1.

The current meta-analysis indi-\ncated that LAM treatment significantly\ndecreased HBV DNA levels compared with\nbaseline, which may lead to a reduction in\nHBV-related complications.42 Our data are\nFigure 2.

This could be\nexplained by differences between detection\nFigure 3.

In addition,\ntime of post-treatment sampling had no\neffect on the finding that TBV and LAM\ndecreased ALT levels, but there was no\nsignificant between-drug difference when\nALT was assessed at <24 weeks post-\ntreatment. This finding suggests that the\ndifference between LAM and TBV is not\napparent in the early stages of treatment.\nBoth TBV and LAM are capable of\nnormalizing ALT levels in patients with\nCHB, but TBV is preferred because of its\nrelatively low resistance levels.\nThe present study had several limitations.\nSince it was a cross-sectional retrospective\nstudy, our analysis did not take into consid-\neration changes in viral load or treatment\nefficacy over time. In addition, due to limited\ndata, it was not possible to analyse pheno-\ntypic or genotypic resistance, restricting our\nresults to a narrow clinical application.\nFigure 3.
