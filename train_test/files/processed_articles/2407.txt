The children in the IHDP\nintervention (INT) group had significantly higher cogni-\ntiveandbehavioralstatusandsomewhathigherminormor-\nbidity when compared with a nonintervention (NI) group\natage3years.24 Therewerenodifferencesinlengthorbody\nmassindex(BMI)atage3yearsbetweenINTandNIgroup\nchildren.Byage8years,infantswhowereintheINTgroup\nand had a birth weight of 2000 g or less were not different\nfrom children of the same birth weight in the NI group in\ncognitivestatusoracademicachievement.Thepretermin-\ng, compared with the infants who did not receive the in-\ntervention, showed significantly higher full-scale IQ and\nmathematic achievement scores.25 These differences per-\nsisted in the recently completed 18-year follow-up.26\nThese early developmental intervention programs fo-\ncused little attention on growth status or growth rate as an\noutcome measure. Although many early intervention pro-\ngrams provided nutritional education to families and of-\nfered snacks and meals at their centers, we are aware of no\nsuch early intervention program that evaluated growth as\nan outcome measure. Since growth status and growth rates\nare considered important markers of a child's well-being,\nparticularly for LBWPT children who are at increased risk\nfor long-term health, growth, and developmental prob-\nlems, we evaluated the effects of the multifaceted IHDP in-\nfant intervention on longer-term growth status. The IHDP\nintervention offered a unique opportunity to evaluate the\nimpact on long-term growth because this cohort was fol-\nlowed up in a standardized study protocol longitudinally\nuntilage8years,andabroadarrayofhigh-qualitydatawere\ncarefully collected, which allowed us to control for many\nimportant confounding variables. We examined the fol-\nlowing research questions: Does the growth status of\nLBWPT children who received the multifaceted IHDP in-\nterventiondifferfromtheNIgroupin8-yearweight,length,\nhead circumference, and BMI, while controlling for im-\nportant child clinical and parent variables? Do these 8-year\neffects vary based on birth-weight category?\nMETHODS\nDetailed descriptions of IHDP recruitment and subjects, study\ndesign, and intervention have been published in detail else-\nwhere and are reviewed briefly herein.24,25,27 All participating\nIHDP universities received required institutional review board\napproval at all data collection points. The University of Arkan-\nsas for Medical Sciences institutional review board approved\nthe analyses described herein.\nSAMPLE\nInfants were eligible for the IHDP study if they had a birth weight\nof 2500 g or less, had a gestational age of 37 weeks or less, re-\nsided in the catchment area, and did not have severe medical ill-\nness or neurological impairment. Unhealthy infants were in-\ncluded unless they had conditions (eg, neural tube defects, severe\nsensory deficits) or neurological dysfunction that were recog-\nnized before nursery discharge and were judged to be so severe\nas to preclude participation in the intervention. Only 61 such\ninfants were excluded. The infants were enrolled from October\nthe primary analysis group. These infants were randomly as-\ndischarge from the nursery using a design with 2 birth-weight\nINTgroup,regardlessoftheircompliancewithintervention,were\nincluded in the analyses as INT children.\nInfants in both INT and NI groups received the same periodic\nmedical, developmental, and social assessments through 8 years\nof age. Clinical staff at each site typically included a pediatri-\ncian and a nurse clinician and social worker. All measure-\nments were collected by standardized protocol after careful train-\ning. All children were assessed at 40 weeks' postconceptual age\nINTERVENTION\nThe intervention program began at discharge from the neonatal\nnursery and continued until October 1988, when each child was\nat least 36 months of age, corrected for degree of prematurity.\nThe intervention consisted of home visits (birth to age 3 years),\nattendance at a center for education intervention (age 1-3 years),\nand parent group meetings (age 1-3 years).24 Children were eli-\ngible to attend the child development center 5 days per week for\napproximately 6 hours per day for 2 years. Children received 2\nmeals per day. There was no nutrition focus in the IHDP and no\nnutrition data were collected. Clinicians provided general care\ninstructions during all follow-up clinic visits to INT and NI chil-\ndren, including nutrition advice as needed. After the interven-\ntion ended, the sites attempted to find appropriate community\neducation programs for children in both INT and NI groups.\nWithin sites, there were no differences between the INT and NI\ngroups in maternal reports of child enrollment in education pro-\ngrams at age 4 years.\nOf the original 985 in the primary analysis group, 878 chil-\ndren (89%) were evaluated at 8 years of age. The percentage of\nchildren retained within the INT and NI groups was similar,\nboth overall and within sites25; 89.7% of the INT group and\nand 86.7% of HLBW were available at 8 years. Eight-year growth\nstatus was assessed by clinic staff who had access to the child's\ntreatment group assignment and history. All growth measures\nwere collected by standard protocol after appropriate training\nprocedures.\nThe following measures were used for the clinical analy-\nses: weight; height; head circumference; and BMI (calculated\nas weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared).\nANALYSES\nBaseline demographic characteristics (based on a sample of 878\nsubjects who participated in the 8-year data collection) were\ncompared using either t tests for continuous variables or 2 tests\nfor categorical variables.\n\u00a92009 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nFor the 8-year analysis, complete data on all control vari-\nables and 8-year growth measures (weight, height, BMI, BMI\npercentile, and head circumference) were available for 314 INT\nchildren and 491 NI children. Comparative analyses of all 8-year\ngrowth variables were performed between INT and NI groups\nfor the full sample and within the 2 birth-weight categories.\nLinear mixed models were used to compare the 8-year growth\nmeasures means between the INT and NI children, adjusting\nfor covariates. Predictors included a site effect (only random\neffect), treatment group (INT or NI), child birth weight, child\nby birth-weight category interaction, sex, race (white/other,\nblack, or Hispanic), maternal education at time of entry into\nthe study (high school, high school, or high school), pre-\nconception weight of the mother, and Neonatal Health Index.\nThe Neonatal Health Index is a marker of severity of neonatal\ncourse calculated based on length of stay in the neonatal nurs-\nery, adjusted for birth weight and standardized to a mean of\n100, with higher scores indicating better health. The models\nwere fit using the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Inc, Cary, North\nCarolina). Individual model effects were evaluated for statis-\ntical significance using the Type III F statistics. Although a treat-\nment groupbirth-weight category was postulated, the inter-\nactions did not reach statistical significance for any of the\nmeasures. Post hoc least squares means comparisons based on\nt tests were used to compare treatment group differences by\nbirth-weight category.\nTo examine the growth of all growth variables over time be-\ntween the INT and NI children, linear mixed models were used\nto model the heights, weights, and head circumferences at 24,\nvariables noted earlier. Fixed effects were evaluated using Type\nIII F tests. Post hoc least squares means comparisons based on\nt tests were used to compare treatment group differences for\neach period. All available data were used at each period.\nTo allow comparison of the growth status of the IHDP par-\nticipants with the general population of the same age, z scores\nwere calculated for weight, height, and BMI by using age- and\nsex-specific national values based on 2000 Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention growth charts. (http://www.cdc.gov\n/GrowthCharts/).CentersforDiseaseControlandPreventionstan-\ndards are not available to calculate head circumference z scores\nfor ages beyond 36 months. All calculations were done using SAS\n9.2 software or Stata 10.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).\nRESULTS\nBaseline demographic characteristics of the 878 subjects\nwho participated in the 8-year data collection are shown\nwithin birth-weight categories by intervention group sta-\ntus (Table 1). Birth weight, length, and head circum-\nference did not vary between INT and NI groups within\neither birth-weight category. The mothers of the NI group\nweighed on average more than 6 lb more (P=.02) than\nthe INT group in the LLBW sample. There were no other\nsignificant differences between the baseline variables by\nintervention group within birth-weight categories. We\ncompared these baseline variables between the full origi-\nnal sample and those who completed the 8-year evalu-\nation (data not shown). There were no differences in any\nof these baseline variables, except the mothers of the chil-\ndrenwhocompletedtheeighth-yearevaluationweremore\nTable 1.

There have been several intervention studies in de-\nveloping countries that have provided nutritional supple-\nmentation and psychosocial stimulation to mothers and\nchildren with malnutrition or who were at risk for mal-\nnutrition.

Children in the\nIHDP intervention were provided 2 meals per day for 2\nyears. Perhaps this longer-term growth effect is a direct\nresult of the food provided at these meals. This is not likely\nthe complete explanation, as the IHDP sample consisted\nof families of a broad array of socioeconomic back-\ngrounds, not just impoverished children, and they were\nin general likely to provide adequate diets to their chil-\ndren. There were no differences in the incidence of fail-\nure to thrive noted between the IHDP INT and NI groups,\nas noted in a previous publication.27 It is also possible that\nthe positive effects on growth were a reflection of im-\nproved parenting. The IHDP intervention has been shown\nto improve the quality of mother-child interaction and the\nchildren's home environment in the first 3 years of life.47,48\nPerhaps the children came to learn mealtimes to be both\na biological event in which they received nutrition and a\nsocial event for mutual exchange between adults and chil-\ndren. This could lead to increased nutrition and nur-\nturance over the years, which could ultimately improve\ngrowth status. Another pathway that might have resulted\nfrom the IHDP intervention is the reduction of stress for\nboth parent and child. There is evidence that excessive\nstress during infancy, including prolonged stays in neo-\nnatalintensivecareunitsinearlychildhood,mayhavenega-\ntiveconsequencesongrowthvianeuroendocrinestresssys-\ntem response.49 Perhaps the benefits of the intervention\non the child and parent together minimized the neuroen-\ndocrine effect of stress on these preterm infants. This lat-\nter speculation may also partially explain why the greater\neffects on growth were noted in the lighter LBWPT in-\nfants who were more likely to have had prolonged stays\nin the neonatal intensive care units. An alternative expla-\nnation, of course, is that these results may not be the con-\nsequence of the IHDP intervention, but rather due to some\nvariable not measured by the IHDP protocol.\nThere is substantial evidence that adverse circum-\nstances, such as being born at a low birth weight and pre-\nmature or poor parenting practices, can have negative im-\npacts in nearly every domain of development. As negative\nconsequences accumulate in one domain of develop-\nment, they are likely to compromise development in other\ndomains as well; that is, there is interconnectedness in\nadaptive functioning across domains. Broad-based inter-\nventions, such as the IHDP intervention, aimed at stem-\nming the negative consequences of LBW and its cofac-\ntors are likely to produce a variety of positive outcomes\nfor children even when the primary goal of the interven-\ntion may be to increase intellectual development and\nschool readiness.
