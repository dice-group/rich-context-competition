Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Question-\nnaire (PHQ-9) to determine the overall prevalence, rates of treatment, and antidepressant control of\nmild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depressive symptoms.\nResults: Of the sample, 20.1% reported significant depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) score, >5),\nthe majority of whom had mild depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) score, 5\u00ad9). Even among individuals\nwith severe depressive symptoms, a large percentage (36.9%) received no treatment from a mental\nhealth professional or with antidepressant medication. Of those taking antidepressants, 26.4% re-\nported mild depressive symptoms and 18.8% had moderate, moderately severe, or severe depres-\nsive symptoms.\nConclusions: Despite greater awareness and treatment of depression in primary care settings,\nthe prevalence of depressive symptoms remains high, treatment levels remain low, and control of\ndepressive symptoms are suboptimal. Primary care providers need to continue to focus their ef-\nforts on diagnosing and effectively treating this important disease.

This is particularly true of racial and\nethnic minority populations.11\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey (NHANES) has been used to assess\nnationwide levels of treatment and control of other\nchronic diseases12 but not depression. According to\nCutler et al,13 NHANES has become \"the principal\nmeans to track progress in preventing, treating, and\ncontrolling hypertension,\" guiding national initia-\ntives such as the National High Blood Pressure\nEducation program. In recent versions of the\nNHANES, use of the Patient Health Question-\nnaire (PHQ)-9 has allowed for greater accuracy in\nthe diagnoses of mild, moderate, moderately se-\nvere, and severe depressive symptoms.14 Gonzales\net al10 assessed treatment and control rates in a\nmutliethnic national sample using Collaborative\nPsychiatric Epidemiology Survey data, but the di-\nagnostic instrument used, the 16-item Quick In-\nventory of Depressive Symptomology--Self Re-\nport is not as commonly used in primary care\nsettings as the PHQ-9. To date, there has been no\npublished study assessing prevalence, treatment,\nand control using the nationally recognized\nNHANES dataset and the PHQ-9 instrument,\nwhich is widely used to screen for depression and to\nguide ongoing treatment decisions in primary care\nand psychiatric settings. Therefore, we examined\nprevalence of depressive symptoms, rates of treat-\nment, and overall levels of treatment response us-\ndata.\nMethods\nDesign\nThe NHANES is designed to assess the health and\nnutritional status of Americans by combining inter-\nviews and physical examinations.15 The surveys\nhave been conducted annually by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics since 1999, using a\ncomplex multistage sampling design to obtain a\nrepresentative sample of the civilian, noninstitu-\ntionalized population of the United States. The\nNHANES oversamples minorities and allows for\npopulation estimates using population totals from\nthe Current Population Surveys. To obtain an ad-\nequate sample size for the analyses we combined\nNHANES, for a potential total sample size of\nMeasures\nDepressive symptoms were assessed using the\nPHQ-9, a 9-item screening tool that asks partici-\npants to choose 1 of 4 responses about the fre-\nquency of depressive symptoms during the previous\nas having moderate, moderately severe, or severe\ndepressive symptoms.\nAntidepressant use was defined as taking at least\none prescribed antidepressant medication in the\npast 30 days, as characterized by the Multum Lex-\nicon Drug Database.16 During the household in-\nterview, survey participants were asked if they had\ntaken a medication in the past month for which\nthey needed a prescription. Those who answered\n\"yes\" were asked to show the interviewer the med-\nication containers of all the medications used.\nAlthough the NHANES does not provide de-\ntails on psychological counseling, we defined coun-\nseling and various types of therapy as treatment\nwith a mental health professional, which was mea-\nsured by the survey question, \"During the past 12\nmonths, have you seen or talked to a mental health\nprofessional such as a psychologist, psychiatrist,\npsychiatric nurse, or clinical social worker about\nyour health?\"\nBecause evidenced-based treatment recommen-\ndations for prescribing antidepressant medication\nand/or administering psychotherapy exist for indi-\nviduals with PHQ-9 scores 15, we specifically\nexamined all forms of treatment among respon-\ndents that scored 15 on the PHQ-9. Evidence-\nbased treatment recommendations for individuals\nwith a PHQ-9 score 10 involve a strategy of\nwatchful waiting and reassessment for antidepres-\nsant treatment or psychotherapy after 2 months.17\nStatistical Analysis\nFrequencies, population estimates, standard errors,\nand 95% CIs taking into account the complex sam-\npling design and population weights were gener-\nated by Proc Crosstabs in SAS-callable SUDAAN\nversion 9 (Research Triangle Institute, Research\nTriangle Park, NC). First, overall prevalence of\ndepressive symptoms and prevalence of the differ-\nent depressive symptom severity categories were\nassessed for the entire adult population.

Given that such\na large segment of the US population (roughly 1 in\n5 adults, or 42.1 million Americans) screened pos-\nitive for at least mild depressive symptoms, it may\nbe seen as a major challenge to our nation's health\nif such a burdensome disease is so frequently undi-\nagnosed, untreated, or undertreated. In many ways\nit is analogous to the gap between prevalence of\nelevated blood pressure in the population and levels\nTable 1.

Although impressive gains\nhave been made (for example, the proportion of\nhypertensive patients with at least partially con-\ntrolled blood pressure, defined by blood pressure\nsion have blood pressure completely under control,\n25% are partially treated but uncontrolled, 11%\nare taking no medication, and 30% are unaware\nthat they even have high blood pressure. Eisenberg\nand Power19 used the phrase \"voltage drop\" to\ndescribe the gap between potentially achievable\noutcomes and those outcomes actually achieved in\nreal-world practice settings, and ultimately in com-\nmunity-based populations.\nPrimary care clinicians approach patients not as\nsingle disease or risk factors, but as whole persons,\nunderstanding that depression confers a direct bur-\nden of suffering but also complicates the manage-\nment of various other chronic diseases or risk fac-\ntors. For example, the epidemiologic evidence for\nan association between depression and cardiovas-\ncular risk is quite strong.20,21 Depression preva-\nlence is also higher among individuals with diabe-\ntes,22 and depression is correlated with poor\nglycemic control. Depression and metabolic syn-\ndrome are correlated as well, and each is an inde-\npendent predictor of adverse cardiac outcomes.23\nBeyond considering depression as a risk factor,\nhowever, depression is also a disabling disease unto\nitself, accounting for disability, reduced quality of\nlife, loss of work days, damage to relationships, and\neven suicide.24,25 Although recognition of depres-\nsion has improved, our data show that more than\nhalf of US adults with depressive symptoms are\nuntreated, and 3 of 4 people with severe depressive\nsymptoms are not taking antidepressant medica-\ntions. Treatment to remission significantly reduces\nrelapse rates in depression; however, almost half of\npeople taking antidepressants have not achieved\nremission of depressive symptoms.26\nFormal screening protocols in primary care\npractices identify many more patients with depres-\nsive symptoms than are diagnosed in usual care\nmodels. There is an emerging body of evidence to\nsuggest that although screening protocols do detect\nmore cases of depression, they do not by them-\nselves reduce the burden of disease or even improve\noutcomes.27 The US Preventive Services Task\nForce only recommends screening adults for de-\npression in clinical practices that have systems to\nensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and\nfollow-up. However, when coupled with struc-\ntured approaches to depression care management\nsuch as the 3-component model, which integrates\nnurse care managers and mental health profes-\nsionals into the primary care practice team,\nimproved outcomes can be achieved. The (Pre-\nvention of Suicide in Primary Care Elderly: Col-\nlaborative Trial) study showed that medical com-\nplexities and comorbid chronic disease common\nto general internal medicine practices affect\ntreatment outcomes for depression in usual-care\nsettings, but that the impact of comorbidities on\ndepression outcomes can be eliminated with a\nmore intensive approach to depression care.28\nThere are limitations to our study. The use of a\nnational survey provides generalizable data we can\napply to the entire noninstitutionalized US popu-\nlation, but it does lack the clinical specificity that\nmight be obtained from direct review of clinical\nTable 2.

The PHQ-9 is a self-administered instru-\nment validated for screening, diagnosis, and assess-\nment of the severity of depressive symptoms, with a\nsensitivity and specificity of 88% each for major\ndepression.14 It is more easily adapted to high-\nvolume primary care settings than instruments such\nas the Zung or Hamilton Depression Rating Scales.\nUsing a PHQ-9 score 5 to indicate mild, mod-\nerate, moderately severe, or severe depressive\nsymptoms, NHANES provides a higher prevalence\ncans) than other recent surveys. However, combin-\ning only moderate, moderately severe, and severe\ndepressive symptoms gives a point prevalence of\n6.8%, which is more consistent with other national\nestimates of a prevalence over a 12-month period of\n6.6%.7 This may indicate that other instruments\nare not detecting mild depressive symptoms, or that\nthe PHQ-9 threshold of 5 may be overly sensitive\nbut not specific.\nIt is possible that individuals who screened pos-\nitive on the NHANES PHQ-9 underreported\ntreatment, either because of recall errors or addi-\ntional factors (eg, stigma associated with mental\nillness and its treatment). In addition, individuals\nwho report taking an antidepressant drug may be\ntaking it for conditions other than depressive symp-\ntoms and therefore have low PHQ-9 scores. This\nwould lead to an overestimate of the proportion of\nthe population treated to remission, which is al-\nready low. We also have no repeated measures or\nlongitudinal tracking to assess the impact of treat-\nment on recently diagnosed individuals, or to esti-\nmate the rate of partial response to treatment\n(50% reduction in PHQ-9 score).\nFurthermore, individuals with bipolar depres-\nsion may have elevated PHQ-9 scores, but may be\nprescribed mood stabilizers rather than antidepres-\nsants for treatment of depressive symptoms. Al-\nthough this represents an extremely small number\nof individuals, it could lead to a slight underesti-\nmate of antidepressant treatment rates for individ-\nuals with moderately severe or severe depressive\nsymptoms.\nConclusion\nDespite these limitations, these nationally repre-\nsentative data provide a cross-sectional US popula-\ntion estimate of the prevalence of mild, moderate,\nmoderately severe, and severe depressive symp-\ntoms. They also demonstrate that a substantial pro-\nportion of persons with symptoms of depression in\nthe United States remain untreated or under-\ntreated. The burden of illness represented by de-\npression care, as well as new evidence suggesting\nthat care and outcomes systematically can be im-\nproved, suggest important opportunities for opti-\nmizing the treatment of depression in primary care\nand community health settings as a means of im-\nproving overall population health.\nReferences\n1.
