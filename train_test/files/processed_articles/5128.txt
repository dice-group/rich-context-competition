    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the developing peripheral nervous system, a coordinated reciprocal signaling between Schwann cells and axons is crucial\nfor accurate myelination. The myelin and lymphocyte protein MAL is a component of lipid rafts that is important for targeting\nproteins and lipids to distinct domains. MAL overexpression impedes peripheral myelinogenesis, which is evident by a delayed\nonset of myelination and reduced expression of the myelin protein zero (Mpz/P0) and the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor\np75NTR. This study shows that MAL overexpression leads to a significant reduction of Mpz and p75NTR expression in primary\nmouse Schwann cell cultures, which was already evident before differentiation, implicating an effect of MAL in early Schwann\ncell development. Their transcription was robustly reduced, despite normal expression of essential transcription factors and\nreceptors. Further, the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathways\nimportant for Schwann cell differentiation were correctly induced, highlighting that other so far unknown rate limiting factors\ndo exist. We identified novel genes expressed by Schwann cells in a MAL-dependent manner in vivo and in vitro. A number of\nthose, including S100a4, RhoU and Krt23, are implicated in cytoskeletal organization and plasma membrane dynamics. We\nshowed that S100a4 is predominantly expressed by nonmyelinating Schwann cells, whereas RhoU was localized within myelin\nmembranes, and Krt23 was detected in nonmyelinating as well as in myelinating Schwann cells. Their differential expression\nduring early peripheral nerve development further underlines their possible role in influencing Schwann cell differentiation\nand myelination.\n",

Accurate Schwann cell development and myelin-\nation are controlled and regulated by reciprocal axon-glia\ninteraction (reviewed in Nave & Trapp, 2008). Although\naxonal signals crucial for development were identified,\nthe process of differentiation and myelination is not yet\nfully understood. One essential growth factor is neuregu-\nlin1 (NRG1), which is shown to be involved in the regu-\nlation of the entire Schwann cell lineage, encompassing\nsurvival and proliferation of Schwann cell precursors as\nwell as myelination (reviewed in Garratt et al., 2000).\nAlso neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor (NGF),\nbrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neuro-\ntrophin 3 (NT3) were shown to be critical for survival,\nmigration, and myelination (reviewed in Xiao et al.,\n2009). Moreover, the correct localization of proteins\nand lipids within distinct Schwann cell compartments\nwas shown to influence myelination.

MAL is localized in polarized epithelial\ncells of the kidney, stomach, and thyroid gland and was\nshown to be involved in the sorting and transport of ves-\nicles to the apical membrane (reviewed in Frank, 2000).\nMAL overexpression leads to pathological apical mem-\nbrane formation in kidney and stomach, demonstrating\nthat its correct dosage is essential for proper function\n(Frank et al., 2000). In the nervous system, MAL is\nexpressed by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous\nsystem (CNS) and by Schwann cells in the peripheral ner-\nvous system (PNS; Schaeren-Wiemers et al., 1995a;\nSchaeren-Wiemers et al., 1995b). MAL expression in\nSchwann cells starts already at embryonic day 17, impli-\ncating a role in development (Frank et al., 1999). It is\nexpressed by both myelinating and nonmyelinating\nSchwann cells and is localized not only in compact\nmyelin but also in noncompact regions such as paranodal\nloops and Schmidt-Lantermann incisures (Erne et al.,\n2002). Mice overexpressing MAL manifest a retarded mat-\nuration of Remak bundles and progressive segregation of\nunmyelinated axons (Buser et al., 2009b; Frank et al.,\n2000). Furthermore, mice overexpressing MAL show a\ndelayed onset of myelination, reflected in hypomyelinated\nfibers during early development (Buser et al., 2009b).\nAlong with changes on the morphological level, altered\ngene transcription and protein expression were detected\nin MAL-overexpressing mice. In sciatic nerves of newborn\nmice, reduced expression of the low-affinity neurotrophin\nresults suggested that altered p75NTR expression in MAL-\noverexpressing mice is the cause of delayed onset of mye-\nlination, as distinct expression of p75NTR has been shown\nto be important for proper initiation of myelination\n(Cosgaya et al., 2002). Herein this study, we analyzed par-\nticular signaling pathways known to be relevant for\nSchwann cell differentiation by investigating primary\nmouse Schwann cell cultures treated with either forskolin\nor NRG1 (Schmid et al., 2014). A whole genome expres-\nsion profiling was further performed to identify MAL-\ndependent differentially expressed transcripts.\nMaterial and Methods\nMouse Line\nThe MAL-overexpressing mouse line was generated by\nintroducing a 34-kb insert of the cosmid pTCF-\nMAL2.1, containing the Mal gene, which is flanked by\n8 kb of upstream nontranscribed region (Frank et al.,\ntissue- and cell-specific manner, and pathological alter-\nations were previously described (Buser et al., 2009b;\nFrank et al., 2000). MAL-overexpressing mice were rou-\ntinely bred with C57/Bl6 mice, and heterozygous mice\nwith respective wild-type littermates were used in this\nstudy. All mice were kept under standard specific patho-\ngen-free conditions, housed, and treated according to the\nguidelines for care and use of experimental animals of the\nveterinary office of the Canton of Basel-Stadt.\nPrimary Mouse Schwann Cell Cultures\nSchwann cells were prepared as described earlier (Schmid\net al., 2014). Sciatic nerves from postnatal day 1 (P1) mice\nsin, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; D6546;\nSigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine\nserum (FBS) was added, and cells were seeded onto 24-\nwell plates (PrimariaTM, BD Bioscience). A day after,\nSchwann cells were treated with 10 mM cytosine b-D-arabi-\nnofuranoside (AraC) twice for 24 h to reduce fibroblast\nproliferation. Schwann cells were passaged, and cells of\nthe respective genotype were pooled and cultured in\nDMEM containing 10% FBS, unless not otherwise\nstated. For mRNA expression analysis, primary\nSchwann cells were seeded at a density of 25,000 cells/\nwell. For immunofluorescence analysis, 15,000 Schwann\ncells were seeded on poly-D-lysine and laminin-coated\nglass coverslips in a 40-ml drop. Purity of mouse Schwann\ncell cultures determined by immunofluorescent stainings\n(information about antibodies in Supplementary Table 1).\nFor Schwann cell differentiation assay, cells were sti-\nmulated with 20 mM forskolin (Sigma-Aldrich) in\nDMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h as\ndescribed earlier (Schmid et al., 2014). For investigation\nof the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) activity,\nSchwann cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented\nhuman recombinant heregulin-b1 (herein called neuregu-\nlin1; Sigma-Aldrich) in DMEM supplemented with 1%\nExpression Analysis\nSchwann cells were washed with phosphate-buffered\nsaline (PBS), and total RNA was isolated using RNeasy\nMicro Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's\nprotocol. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed\nusing Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase (Roche) and\nrandom hexamer primers (Roche). Primers for quantita-\ntive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction\n2 ASN Neuro\n(qRT-PCR) were designed with Clone Manager software\n(Science and Educational Software) or with NCBI\nPrimerBLAST. Primer pairs were chosen to overlap\nexon/intron junctions to prevent amplification of gen-\nomic DNA (Supplementary Table 2). qRT-PCR was per-\nformed on the 7500 Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied\nBiosystems) with Fast SYBR Master Mix (Applied\nBiosystems). The acquired mRNA copy numbers were\nnormalized to the one of the 60S ribosomal protein sub-\nunit L13a. For the graph of Mpz and p75NTR, values\nrepresent the mean of at least 20 independent experiments\nfor unstimulated and at least 9 independent experiments\nfor stimulated primary Schwann cells [Figure 1(a) and\n(b)]. For qRT-PCR analysis of Sox10, Oct6, Krox20,\ncJun, Krox24, Egr3, and Mag, data represent the mean\nof at least nine independent experiments [Figure 1(c)].\nFor the in vivo analysis, sciatic nerves of two MAL-over-\nexpressing mice and respective wild-type littermates were\npooled, and total RNA was isolated with the ZR RNA\nMicroPrepTM Kit (Zymo Research). First-strand cDNA\nsynthesis was performed using GoScriptTM reverse tran-\nscriptase (Promega) and random hexamer primers\n(Roche). qRT-PCR was performed on the ViiATM 7\nReal-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with\nKAPA Sybr Fast Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems). The\nacquired mRNA copy numbers were normalized to the\none of the 60S ribosomal protein subunit L13a.\nDetermination of PI3-Kinase Activity by Measuring\nPhospho-Akt Levels\nTo determine the phospho-Akt levels in vivo, sciatic\nnerves of four newborn MAL-overexpressing and wild-\ntype littermates were collected per experiment.\nHomogenization of the nerve tissues was performed in\nfate [SDS]) with complete protease inhibitor mixture\n(Roche), 5 mM NaF, and 1 mM Na3\nusing Lysing\nMatrix D tubes (MP Biomedicals) in a FastPrep FP120\nhomogenizer (MP Biomedicals) for 30 s at 6.0 m/s. The\nhomogenate was incubated in 4\u00c2 Laemmle buffer and\n20% b-mercaptoethanol for 1 h at 37C. Protein separ-\nation on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis\n(PAGE) gel, protein transfer, and antibody incubations\nwere performed as described earlier (Buser et al., 2009b).\nImmunofluorescent signal detection was investigated by\nthe OdysseyTM Imaging System (LI-COR) and quantified\nusing ImageJ. The expression levels were normalized to\nthe one of b-actin.\nWhole Genome Expression Profiling\nMAL-overexpressing and wild-type Schwann cells were\ncultured and stimulated with 20 mM forskolin for 24 h\n(Schmid et al., 2014). Nine experimental samples were\ninvestigated per condition, derived from five independent\nexperiments. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy\nMicro Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's\nprotocol. All RNA samples had an RNA integrity\nnumber (RIN) of above 8, verified with the Agilent\nBioanalyzer system (Agilent Technologies). RNA ampli-\nfication, biotinylation, in vitro transcription, and cRNA\nhybridization were performed as described earlier (Kinter\nExpression BeadChips from Illumina were scanned\nusing the iScan Reader (Illumina), and global median\nnormalization of gene expression was performed with\nthe GenomeStudio software (version 2011.1, Illumina).\nAll data passed the quality control analysis as assessed\nby the Illumina on-board software (GenomeStudio, ver-\nsion 2011.1) and principal component analysis (PCA;\nPartek Genomics Suite, version 6.6, Partek Inc.).\nSignificantly differentially expressed genes were further\nanalyzed with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) soft-\nware (Ingenuity Systems) and the Database for\nAnnotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery\n(DAVID, version 6.7, DAVID Bioinformatics\nResources; Huang da, Sherman, & Lempicki, 2009).\nImmunofluorescent Microscopy\nCultured Schwann cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed in\n4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After washing\nthree times with PBS for 30 min, unspecific binding sites\nwere impeded by incubation with blocking buffer con-\ntaining 1% normal donkey serum (Chemicon Int.), 2%\ncold fish skin gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.15% Triton\nX-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 1 h at room tempera-\nture. Primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 1) were\nincubated in blocking buffer at 4C overnight.\nFluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies were\ndiluted in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at room\ntemperature. Stained sections were embedded in\nFluorSave (Calbiochem). For in vivo immunofluorescent\nstainings, 10-mm tissue sections of fresh-frozen sciatic\nnerves of 3-month-old MAL-overexpressing mice and\nwild-type littermates were mounted on Superfrost Plus\nslides (Thermo Scientific), dried at room temperature,\nand fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After\nwashing three times for 30 min with PBS, slides were\nincubated in 80% ethanol for 1 h and thereafter washed\nwith PBS. Further procedure was performed as described\nearlier. Immunofluorescent images were acquired with\neither a Nikon A1R microscope (40\u00c2 objective, numer-\nnumerical aperture 1.40). For quantification of phospho-\nAkt staining, 400 nonoverlapping images per genotype\nand condition were acquired. For each image, a threshold\nSchmid et al. 3\nlevel of 2 to 255 was set, and the average staining inten-\nsity was recorded. The mean of this value was determined\nfor each coverslip (50 images) and then for each condi-\ntion. The average staining intensity was calculated over\nthree independent experiments. Image processing was\nperformed with ImageJ 1.47 b software and Adobe\nPhotoshop software (version CS5.1).\nStatistical Analysis\nFor qRT-PCR expression analysis in vitro, values repre-\nsent the mean of itemized independent experiments, and\nerror bars indicate the SEM. Statistical analysis was per-\nformed using a Student's t test for paired groups.

Therefore, we investi-\ngated whether Schwann cells overexpressing MAL are\nless responsive to stimuli for Schwann cell differentiation\nin vitro. Schwann cells isolated from sciatic nerves of P1\nMAL-overexpressing mice and wild-type littermates were\ntreated for 24 h with 20 mM forskolin, a generally used\nreagent to activate the cAMP response element-binding\nprotein (CREB) and to induce the expression of myelin-\ndifferential gene expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR.\nSchwann cells derived from MAL-overexpressing mice\nshowed a robust overexpression of Mal mRNA also\nin vitro under both treated and untreated conditions\n(data not shown). Schwann cell differentiation upon for-\nskolin treatment was determined by the induction of\nmyelin protein zero (Mpz/P0) expression. In wild-type\nSchwann cells, a 6.5-fold induction of Mpz mRNA\nexpression was detected upon stimulation with forskolin\n[Figure 1(a)]. The increase of Mpz expression upon treat-\nment was comparable between MAL-overexpressing and\nwild-type cells. However, Schwann cells derived\nfrom MAL-overexpressing mice showed an overall 50%\nreduction of Mpz mRNA expression under both unstimu-\n[Figure 1(a)].\nExpression of p75NTR in wild-type Schwann cells was\nreduced approximately 35% by forskolin stimulation\n[Figure 1(b), wt\u00fe], corresponding to the in vivo situation\nin which p75NTR expression was downregulated during\nmyelination (Buser et al., 2009b). Along with the reduced\nexpression of Mpz, untreated Schwann cells overexpres-\nsing MAL manifested a 25% reduction in p75NTR mRNA\nexpression compared with wild-type cells [p < 0.0001;\nFigure 1(b)], confirming the in vivo situation (Buser\net al., 2009b). As for wild-type cells, forskolin treatment\nled to a 30% decrease of p75NTR expression level in\nMAL-overexpressing Schwann cells [Figure 1(b)], and\nstill, a reduction of 20% compared with wild-type cells\nThe expression levels of Sox10, Oct6, Krox20, cJun,\nKrox24, Egr3, and Mag were investigated in primary\nunstimulated mouse Schwann cell cultures [Figure 1(c)]\nto determine whether the reduced mRNA level of Mpz\nand p75NTR was possibly caused by the altered expression\nof transcription factors known to modulate their expres-\nMAL-overexpressing Schwann cells, Sox10 expression\nwas slightly reduced (p < 0.08), validating previous\nin vivo observations (Buser et al., 2009b). However,\nexpression of the transiently activated transcription\nfactor Oct6 was increased in MAL-overexpressing\nSchwann cells (p < 0.06). Furthermore, the expression of\nKrox20 was significantly increased in MAL-overexpres-\nsing Schwann cells compared with wild-type cells\n(p < 0.005). As a negative regulator for myelination, the\nexpression of cJun was investigated (Parkinson et al.,\n2008), although no altered transcription was detected in\nMAL-overexpressing Schwann cells. The transcription\nfactors Krox24 and Egr3 were investigated due to their\nbut the expression levels of both transcripts were not sig-\nnificantly changed. In contrast to Mpz, MAL overexpres-\nsion did not influence the expression of the myelin-\nassociated glycoprotein (Mag), which is also early\nexpressed during Schwann cell development.\nOur results demonstrate that the activation of the\nCREB signaling pathway is not affected by MAL over-\nexpression and did not improve reduced Mpz and p75NTR\nexpression in MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells. Our\nanalysis further revealed that Mpz and p75NTR were\nalready reduced in unstimulated Schwann cells overex-\npressing MAL, suggesting that alteration in gene regula-\ntion due to MAL overexpression is taking place at an\nearly stage of Schwann cell development.\nPhosphorylation of Akt Is Not Altered in\nMAL-Overexpressing Schwann Cells\nAs the activation of the CREB signaling pathway seemed\nto be unaffected by MAL overexpression, we investigated\nwhether the decreased Mpz expression in MAL-overex-\npressing mice is caused by a reduced activation of the\nPI3-kinase pathway, a major signaling pathway in\nSchwann cells required for myelination. Protein expres-\nsion levels of total Akt and phosphorylated Akt, a key\neffector of PI3-kinase, were measured in sciatic nerves of\nnewborn mice by quantitative Western blot analysis. In\nMAL-overexpressing mice, both total Akt and phos-\nphorylated Akt were expressed at normal levels\n[Figure 2(a)]. To determine the activation of Akt, the\nratio of phosphorylated Akt to total Akt was assessed\n[Figure 2(b)]. This ratio was similar between MAL-\noverexpressing and wild-type nerves, indicating that\ndelayed onset of myelination in MAL-overexpressing\nmice was not due to reduced Akt phosphorylation.\nInvestigation of p75NTR expression was included as an\nSchmid et al. 5\ninternal control, and its expression was decreased by 30%\nin newborn MAL-overexpressing mice, validating previ-\nIn parallel, we investigated Akt phosphorylation in\nprimary mouse Schwann cell cultures. MAL-overexpres-\nsing and wild-type Schwann cells were treated with\n2.5 nM NRG1 for 15 min to induce Akt phosphorylation\nin vitro, and the activation of Akt was determined\nby immunofluorescence for phosphorylated Akt\n[Figure 2(c) and (d)]. We analyzed the mean intensity of\nthe phospho-Akt immunofluorescence in stimulated and\nunstimulated cells of both genotypes. NRG1 treatment\nresulted in a significant 3.5-fold induction of phosphory-\nlated Akt in wild-type Schwann cells [p < 0.0001; Figure\n2(c) and (d)], which is consistent with previous results in\nrat Schwann cells (Ogata et al., 2004). A comparable\ninduction was observed for Schwann cells derived from\nMAL-overexpressing mice. In MAL-overexpressing\nSchwann cells, phosphorylation of Akt was unaltered in\neither condition compared with wild-type cells, which is\nin line with the in vivo observation. Schwann cell\nmorphology was not changed during NRG1 treatment,\nverified by a comparable distribution of p75NTR staining\n(data not shown). From our data, we conclude that\ndelayed onset of myelination in MAL-overexpressing\nmice was not caused by impaired activation of the PI3-\nkinase/Akt pathway, as phosphorylation of Akt was\nunaltered in sciatic nerves of newborn mice overexpres-\nsing MAL. Further, comparable staining intensities of\nphosphorylated Akt were detected between MAL-over-\nexpressing and wild-type Schwann cell cultures, indicat-\ning that induction of the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway is\nfunctional.\nDifferential Gene Expression Analysis of Genes\nImplicated in Schwann Cell Development in\nMAL-Overexpressing Schwann Cells\nTo determine whether the transcriptional regulation of\nadditional genes influencing the onset of myelination\nwas altered due to MAL overexpression, a whole\npAkt\nunstimulated\nAkt -actin pAkt -actin\n(a)\n(c)\nDAPI\n(b)\nNTR\nNTR\n(d)\n*\nNRG [nM]\nwt tgMAL\nStaining intensity (0-255) Ratio tgMAL to wt\nt\nw\nt\nw wt L\nA\nM\ng\nt\nL\nA\nM\ng\nt tgMAL\nL\nA\nM\ng\nt\nt\nw\nMean intensity of pAkt staining\nFigure 2.

A total of 400 pictures were analyzed per\ncondition and genotype. Data represent the mean of three independent experiments, and error bars indicate the SEM. *p < 0.0001; NRG:\nneuregulin1.\n6 ASN Neuro\ntranscripts was performed for primary mouse Schwann\ncell cultures. In total, nine independent samples of\nuntreated and forskolin-treated Schwann cells derived\nfrom MAL-overexpressing mice and wild-type littermates\nwere analyzed. One coding DNA sequence may be repre-\nsented by several distinct oligonucleotides (probes). For\nall examinations, probe-specific analysis was performed,\nallowing to identify MAL-dependent differentially\nexpressed transcripts with high confidence. To investigate\nthe effect of MAL overexpression on global gene expres-\nsions, data were visualized by an initial PCA generated in\nPartek Genomics Suite (Supplementary Figure 1). This\nanalysis revealed that treatment with forskolin was the\nmajor source of variability. Based on the genotype, no\ndistinct clustering of MAL-overexpressing and wild-type\nsamples was detected, suggesting that only a small\nnumber of genes were differentially regulated in\nSchwann cells overexpressing MAL.\nIn a first step, we analyzed the mRNA expression\nlevels of transcription factors that are implicated in\nSchwann cell development, differentiation, and myelin-\nation (Table 1, A). This analysis revealed a small but\nsignificant reduction of Sox10 mRNA expression in\nMAL-overexpressing Schwann cells. In general, however,\ntranscription factors known to positively or negatively\nmodulate Schwann cell differentiation and myelination\nwere not altered in MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells.\nAnalysis of the expression pattern of receptors implicated\nin neuregulin or neurotrophin signaling (e.g., ErbB2,\nErbB3, TrkB, TrkC) also revealed no significant changes\nin MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells (Table 1, B).\nHowever, p75NTR mRNA levels were significantly\nreduced, validating data obtained by qRT-PCR.\nAnalysis of myelin-related gene transcripts showed the\nexpected increase of Mal in MAL-overexpressing\nSchwann cells, and the reduced expression of Mpz upon\nMAL overexpression could be confirmed (Table 1, C). In\naddition, a significant reduction of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide\n3' phosphodiesterase (Cnp) and the proteolipid protein\nplasmolipin (Pllp) was identified in MAL-overexpressing\nSchwann cells, which was validated by qRT-PCR\n(Supplementary Figure 2). Like MAL, plasmolipin is a\ncomponent of lipid rafts and shares some structural simi-\ntetraspans are expressed in the CNS, the PNS and in\nthe apical membrane of tubular epithelial cells in the\nunderlining a putative functional relationship between\nMAL and plasmolipin. The expression of other myelin-\nrelated transcripts seemed not to be affected in MAL-\noverexpressing Schwann cells.\nA closer look at gene sequences associated with the\nextracellular matrix (ECM) revealed significant reduction\nof a-dystrobrevin (Dtna) and dystroglycan (Dag1), two\nmembers of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex\n(Table 1, E). Transcripts of other members of this com-\nplex were either expressed below background levels or\nwere unaltered (Dtnb, Sgcd, Snta1-Sntg2, and Utrn).\nThis was also the case for the different isoforms of integ-\nrin and laminin as well as for entactin (nidogen, Nid1/2)\nand the proteoglycans agrin (Agrn), perlecan (Hspg2),\nand bamacan (Smc3). However, significantly increased\nexpression levels of collagen type II a1 (Col2a1) and col-\nlagen type IV a5 (Col4a5) transcripts were detected in\nMAL-overexpressing Schwann cells, whereas comparable\nexpression levels for collagen type V and VI were\nobserved. Investigation of genes implicated in polarity\nrevealed normal mRNA expression levels in MAL-over-\nexpressing Schwann cells (Dlg1, Pard3, and Dock7).\nIn summary, we identified that transcripts of a small\nnumber of genes known to be involved in Schwann cell\ndevelopment were differentially expressed in MAL-over-\nexpressing Schwann cells, but the consistent reduction of\nMpz and p75NTR expression cannot be explained by these\nchanges.\nMAL-Dependent Differential Gene Expression in\nSchwann Cells\nTo further investigate the effect of MAL overexpression\non gene transcription, microarray data were analyzed\nmore stringently using an FDR-adjusted p value\nof < 0.05. This study revealed that the mRNA expression\nlevels of 15 genes were highly significantly reduced in\nMAL-overexpressing Schwann cells, whereas those of 7\ngenes were increased (Table 2). Literature search revealed\nthat the expression of most of these genes has not yet\nbeen reported in Schwann cells.\nIn MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells, substantial\ntranscriptional reduction was detected for the glutamic\nacid decarboxylase 2 (Gad2/Gad65), the asialoglycopro-\ntein receptor 1 (Asgr1), the ectonucleoside triphosphate\ndiphosphohydrolase 2 (Entpd2), and the intermediate fila-\nment keratin 23 (Krt23). MAL overexpression resulted\nalso in reduced mRNA expression levels of the proteo-\nglycan synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2B (Sv2b), the\nTRAF2 and NCK interacting kinase (Tnik), the GTP-\nbinding protein Di-Ras1 (Diras1), and the chloride chan-\nnel calcium-activated 4 (Clca4). In addition, significant\nreduction of mRNA expression levels could be detected\nfor the vesicle amine transport protein 1 homolog-like\n(Vat1l), the member 10 of the immunoglobulin superfam-\nily (Igsf10), as well as the glycolysis-influencing gene\n6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 4\n(Pfkfb4). A comparable reduction was identified for the\nionotropic glutamate receptor AMPA1 (Gria1/GluR-A/\nGlur1), the ras homolog family member U (RhoU/\nWrch1), and a-dystrobrevin (Dtna).\nIn MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells, significantly\nincreased expression levels of Mal were detected, serving\nSchmid et al. 7\nTable 1.

Investigation of transcriptional expression in MAL-overexpressing and wild-type sciatic nerves. Gene transcripts significantly\nreduced (a) or increased (b) in MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells were analyzed in P0 and P5 sciatic nerves of MAL-overexpressing mice\n(tgMAL) and wild-type littermates (wt). Entpd2, Krt23, Sv2b, Vat1l, Pfkfb4, and Rhou were significantly decreased in mice overexpressing\nMAL (a), whereas the expression levels of Mal and S100a4 were significantly increased (b). Data were normalized to the expression of 60s,\nand P0 wild-type values were set to 1. The columns show the mean value of at least four experimental samples, and the error bars indicate\nDtna, for which no differential expression was observed\nin peripheral nerve tissue neither at early nor at later\ndevelopmental time points (P10, P20, adult, data not\nshown). As expected, the strong induction of Mal\nmRNA levels could be confirmed in MAL-overexpres-\nsing nerves at both investigated time points [Figure\n3(b)]. This was also the case for S100a4 mRNA expres-\nsion that was significantly increased in MAL-overex-\npressing nerves, in line with the in vitro observation.\nIn comparison to primary mouse Schwann cell cultures,\nno differential expression of Osbpl3, Aqp1, and Ldb2\nwas detected in vivo, and Clca4, Moxd1, and Wnt16\nwere expressed below background levels. These results\ndemonstrate that MAL-overexpression influences tran-\nscriptional regulation of most of the newly identified\ngenes both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a functional\nrelevance in Schwann cells.\nNonmyelinating Schwann Cells\nCytoskeletal dynamics is crucial for Schwann cell devel-\nopment. For S100a4, which regulates the cytoskeleton\norganization by promoting the disassembly of myosin II\nfilaments (Li et al., 2003), significantly increased mRNA\nexpression levels were observed upon MAL overexpres-\nsion both in vivo and in vitro. For this reason, the spatial\nprotein expression pattern of S100a4 was investigated\n(Figure 4).

Investigation of the spatial expression pattern of S100a4 in cultured Schwann cells and in sciatic nerves. Immunofluorescent\nmicroscopy revealed a strong cytoplasmic S100a4 expression in a subpopulation of cultured Schwann cells (a, arrow). Due to this strong\nimmunofluorescent signal, the acquisition time was reduced, and therefore, cells still considerably expressing S100a4 appeared only weakly\npositive (a, asterisk). (b) In contrast to S100a4, p75NTR signal was observed at a homogenous intensity level, indicating that those cells\nbelong to the Schwann cell lineage. (c) Analysis of S100a4 mRNA levels revealed robustly increased expression levels in sciatic nerves\nderived from MAL-overexpressing mice at all investigated time points.

(e) The same areas\nwere also positive for p75NTR, a marker for nonmyelinating Schwann cells (e, arrows). (f) Only weak expression of S100a4 was detected in\nwild-type sciatic nerves; its localization was comparable to MAL-overexpressing mice (f, arrows). Blue: DAPI. Bars: 20 mm.\na subpopulation of Schwann cells showed very high\nexpression of S100a4 in the cytoplasm [Figure 4(a),\narrow].\nWe further investigated the expression of S100a4\nin vivo. In addition to P0 and P5, significantly increased\nmRNA expression levels of S100a4 were also detected at\nP10, P20, and in adult mice overexpressing MAL\n[Figure 4(c)]. The spatial expression pattern of S100a4\nwas also investigated on transversal sciatic nerve sections\nof 3-month-old MAL-overexpressing and wild-type mice.\nWe detected a strong S100a4 immunofluorescent signal in\nRemak bundles in MAL-overexpressing mice, identified\nas Mbp-negative areas [Figure 4(d), arrows]. Remak bun-\ndles in MAL-overexpressing nerves are readily identifi-\nable due to progressive segregation of unmyelinated\naxons observed in these mice (Buser et al., 2009b) and\ndue to expression of p75NTR, a marker for nonmyelinat-\ning Schwann cells [Figure 4(e), arrows]. In wild-type mice,\nonly weak S100a4 immunofluorescent signal was detected\nin Remak bundles, confirming increased S100a4 expres-\nsion in MAL-overexpressing mice not only on mRNA\nbut also on protein levels [Figure 4(f), arrows]. In sum-\nmary, our data show that the expression levels of S100a4\nmRNA and protein, a regulator of the cytoskeleton\norganization, were upregulated upon MAL overexpres-\nsion in vitro and in vivo. Further, we detected S100a4\nprotein to be predominantly expressed in nonmyelinating\nSchwann cells.\nCellular Expression Pattern of RhoU and Krt23 in\nSchwann Cells\nWe further investigated the expression pattern of RhoU\nand Krt23, which are also known to be involved in\ncytoskeleton organization, and were significantly\nreduced by MAL overexpression both in cultured\nSchwann cells and in sciatic nerves of newborn mice.\nFirst, their spatial localization was investigated in cul-\ntured primary mouse Schwann cells. The Cdc42-related\nsuperfamily member RhoU was localized throughout\nthe cytoplasm [Figure 5(a), arrows], within membrane\nprotrusions [Figure 5(a), arrowheads] as well as along\nSchwann cell processes [Figure 5(a), open arrowhead].\nImmunofluorescent microscopy for the intermediate fila-\nment Krt23 detected a punctated staining pattern in the\ncytoplasm [Figure 5(d), arrows] and in membrane pro-\ntrusions [Figure 5(d), arrowhead]. Further, Krt23\nimmunofluorescence could be identified within and\nalong Schwann cell processes [Figure 5(d), open arrow-\nhead]. In addition to cultured Schwann cells, the expres-\nsion pattern of RhoU and Krt23 was investigated on\ntransversal sciatic nerve sections of adult mice\n[Figure 5(b), (c), (e), and (f)]. RhoU protein was\ndetected within the myelin sheath [Figure 5(b),\narrows], identified by Mbp [Figure 5(c), arrows], but\nnot in nonmyelinating Schwann cells in Remak bundles\n[Figure 5(c), encircled area]. For Krt23, a punctated\nstaining was observed in myelin membranes\n[Figure 5(e) and (f), arrows] as well as in nonmyelinating\nSchwann cells [Figure 5(f), encircled area].\nOur data show that RhoU was localized within myelin\nmembranes, and Krt23 was detected in nonmyelinating as\nwell as in myelinating Schwann cells, indicating that over-\nexpression of MAL influences both nonmyelinating and\nmyelinating Schwann cells.\nAnalysis of Annotation Tags for Significantly Altered\nGenes in MAL-Overexpressing Schwann Cell\nCultures\nA possible common functional role of the 15 genes, whose\ntranscripts were highly significantly decreased in MAL-\noverexpressing Schwann cells, was investigated by the\nIPA of Ingenuity Systems and the DAVID. No common\nsignaling pathway, protein\u00adprotein interactions, or\ncommon transcriptional regulator for those genes was\nidentified. However, functional annotation charts\nrevealed that almost one third of the investigated genes\n(Asgr1, Gria1, Gad2, and Rhou) were associated with the\nterm palmitate (p < 0.0005, indicating that these genes are\nspecifically associated with this term more often than\nwould be expected by chance). All of them were also\nreduced in vivo, suggesting a functional role in Schwann\ncells. Palmitoylation has been shown to be important for\nefficient targeting of myelin proteins to the plasma mem-\nbrane (Schneider et al., 2005). These data support the cur-\nrent concept for the functional role of MAL in sorting and\ntrafficking of particular components to the plasma mem-\nDiscussion\nA previous study on PNS development revealed that\nMAL overexpression led to a delayed onset of myelin-\nation, hypomyelinated fibers, and reduced Mpz and\np75NTR expression levels in newborn mice (Buser et al.,\n2009b). We postulated that MAL plays a critical role in\nPNS myelin formation, probably by influencing the traf-\nficking of particular membrane components important\nfor axon-glia interaction and downstream signaling\nduring the process of myelin initiation. From that\nstudy, we concluded that MAL dosage influences Mpz\nand p75NTR expression levels in the PNS and maybe by\nthat the progress of myelination. This is unexpected\nbecause MAL is considered to be a regulator of raft-\ndependent protein transport processes but not a regulator\nof gene expression. However, our data point to a cascade\nof events that ultimately leads to reduced expression\nlevels of the major myelin protein Mpz and the p75NTR\nreceptor and to delayed myelination in MAL-overexpres-\nsing mice. In this study, the consequence of MAL over-\nexpression was investigated in primary mouse Schwann\ncell cultures. We analyzed its effect on the transcriptional\nlevel as well as its influence on major signaling pathways\nknown to be important for Schwann cell differentiation\nand myelination. Significantly reduced mRNA expression\nlevels were detected for Mpz and p75NTR in cultured\nMAL-overexpressing Schwann cells, validating the\nin vivo observation. Reduced expression of Mpz and\np75NTR was already evident before Schwann cell differen-\ntiation, implicating that the effect of MAL overexpression\naffects early processes in Schwann cell development.\nHerein this study, we further demonstrated that primary\nmouse Schwann cells overexpressing MAL can activate\nthe CREB signaling pathway upon treatment with for-\nskolin, indicated by a comparable induction of Mpz\nexpression as observed in wild-type cells. We also\nshowed that the delayed onset of myelination in vivo is\nnot due to impaired phosphorylation of Akt, suggesting\nthat the PI3-kinase pathway is functional. In line, phos-\nphorylation of Akt was induced in MAL-overexpressing\nSchwann cell cultures in a comparable degree as in wild-\ntype cells. Differential expression analysis of genes impli-\ncated to be regulated upon activation of the Raf-kinase\n(Napoli et al., 2012) revealed no transcriptional alter-\nations in MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells, also\ndemonstrating that the ERK pathway seems not to be\naffected by MAL overexpression (Supplementary\nMAL Overexpression Leads to Differential\nExpression of Genes Associated With Cytoskeleton\nOrganization and ECM\nDespite the fact that Krox20 mRNA was increased by\nqRT-PCR, the expression levels of Mpz and p75NTR\nwere robustly decreased.

(e, f) Immunofluorescent microscopy\non sciatic nerves of 3-month-old mice revealed Krt23 to be punctately localized in myelinating Schwann cells (e, f, arrows), as well as in\nnonmyelinating Schwann cells (f, encircled area). Localization in nonmyelinating Schwann cells was visualized on sciatic nerves derived from\nMAL-overexpressing mice (c, f). Blue: DAPI. Bars: 20 mm.\nof Mpz and p75NTR expression in MAL-overexpressing\nSchwann cells cannot be explained by the minor tran-\nscriptional effects of known genes in Schwann cells. For\nthis reason, a whole genome microarray was performed,\nand a set of genes implicated in the regulation of the\ncytoskeleton was identified to be differentially regulated\nby MAL overexpression [Supplementary Figure 4(a)].\nOne differentially expressed gene transcript was S100a4,\na member of the EF-hand family of calcium-binding pro-\ntein. In general, S100a4 inhibits the assembly of nonmus-\ncle myosin II monomers into filaments and promotes the\ndisassembly of myosin II filaments, implicated in\nremodeling the actin cytoskeleton [Li et al., 2003,\nreviewed in Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009;\nSupplementary Figure 4(b)]. In Schwann cells, myosin\nII was shown to be necessary for peripheral myelination,\nindicated by reduced number of myelin segments,\nreduced expression of myelin proteins, as well as impaired\nbasal lamina assembly shown by RNA interference in\nmyelinating cocultures (Wang et al., 2008). Our study\nrevealed that MAL overexpression led to increased\nmRNA and protein levels of S100a4 both in vitro and\nin vivo throughout development and in the adult.\nIncreased S100a4 expression in MAL-overexpressing\nSchwann cells might therefore increase the disassembly\nof myosin II filaments, thereby influencing actin filament\nstability. Further, immunofluorescent colocalization ana-\nlysis in peripheral nerves identified S100a4 to be\nexpressed predominantely in nonmyelinating Schwann\ncells. This observation suggests that the strongly S100a4\npositive Schwann cells in vitro belong to the nonmyelinat-\ning Schwann cell lineage.\nAnother gene associated with cytoskeleton organiza-\ntion is the intermediate filament keratin 23 (Krt23), a\nmember of the type I cytokeratin family (Zhang et al.,\nreduced upon MAL overexpression both in vitro and\nin vivo. Immunofluorescent microscopy of adult periph-\neral nerves revealed its protein localization in myelinating\nas well as in nonmyelinating Schwann cells. For Krt18,\nan interaction partner of Krt23 (Liffers et al., 2011), kera-\ntin monomers were shown to appear at the cell periphery\nclose to the plasma membrane, and to be transported\nalong actin fibers, allowing intermediate filament network\nreorganization [Kolsch et al., 2009; Supplementary\nFigure 4(b)]. In Schwann cells, only little is known\nabout the expression of keratins. Our previous analysis\nrevealed that Krt23 and Krt10 were substantially\nexpressed in Schwann cells in vitro, whereas other keratin\ntranscripts were not detected in primary Schwann cell\ncultures (Schmid et al., 2014). Thus, reduced\nexpression of Krt23 in MAL-overexpressing Schwann\ncells might debilitate integration of keratin monomers\ninto the keratin filament network that is mediated by\nactin fibers.\nAlong these lines, we identified reduced expression of\nRhoU/Wrch1 in cultured MAL-overexpressing Schwann\ncells and in sciatic nerves of newborn MAL-overexpres-\nsing mice. Spatial expression analysis on sciatic nerves\nrevealed that RhoU is expressed by myelinating but not\nby nonmyelinating Schwann cells. RhoU is implicated in\nthe activation of the JNK signaling pathway and is essen-\ntial to maintain F-actin polarization [Ory et al., 2007; Tao\net al., 2001; Supplementary Figure 4(b)]. RhoU overex-\npression results in altered cytoskeletal architecture by dis-\nsolution of F-actin stress fibers in 3T3 cells (Tao et al.,\n2001). In MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells, we further\nobserved a decreased mRNA expression levels of the\nTRAF2 and NCK-interacting kinase (Tnik), belonging\nto the germinal center kinase (GCK) family\n[Supplementary Figure 4(b)]. Tnik specifically activates\nthe JNK pathway and induces disruption of F-actin\nand by that inhibits cell spreading (Fu et al., 1999).\nHowever, reduced expression could not be observed in\nsciatic nerve tissues derived from MAL-overexpressing\nmice, suggesting that MAL overexpression does not\nhave a general impact on the expression of Tnik. Its\nexpression might be tightly regulated within a particular\nstage during Schwann cell development or differentiation.\nThe observed reduced expression of Tnik and RhoU in\nMAL-overexpressing Schwann cells may influence their\npotential to induce disassembly of F-actin and by that to\nmodulate cytoskeleton dynamics important for Schwann\ncell membrane mobility. Their functional role in Schwann\ncells is not yet known, but they might be novel candidates\ninvolved in modulating early events of Schwann cell dif-\nferentiation, in which JNK and actin are known to play\nan important role (Fernandez-Valle et al., 1997;\nParkinson et al., 2004). In line, the reduced expression\nof Cnp in MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells may also\npoint to altered cytoskeletal dynamics. Cnp was shown to\nbind to tubulin heterodimers and to influence F-actin and\nmicrotubule reorganization in oligodendrocytes (Lee\net al. 2005). In a previous study, we reported reduced\nprotein expression of Cnp in membrane preparations of\nP5 sciatic nerves of MAL-overexpressing mice (Buser\net al., 2009b). Hitherto, it was unknown whether this\nreduced expression is a consequence of the delayed\nonset of myelination or whether it is directly linked to\nMAL overexpression. Now we can speculate that reduced\nCnp protein levels in vivo are a direct consequence of\nMAL overexpression and not of the delayed myelination,\nbecause other myelin-associated genes were not differen-\ntially regulated in MAL-overexpressing Schwann cell\ncultures.\nBesides microtubules, actin filaments, and intermedi-\nate filaments, a fourth filamentous system is known in\nSchwann cells, namely, the family of septins (Buser\net al., 2009a). Septins form higher order filaments by\nheteromeric assembly and can interact with components\nof cellular membranes, as well as with actin filaments and\nmicrotubules (reviewed in Saarikangas & Barral, 2011).\nIn polarized cells, septins are involved in membrane com-\npartmentalization and vesicle transport. A whole set of\nseptins are expressed in Schwann cells throughout devel-\nopment and in the adult, and they were localized in particu-\nlar cellular compartments (Buser et al., 2009a). MAL was\nshown to interact with septin 6, which in turn is associated\nwith particular septins and actin, probably establishing spe-\ncialized scaffolds in distinct myelin compartments [Buser\net al., 2009a; Supplementary Figure 4(c)]. Due to this\ndirect link between MAL and a component of the cytoskel-\neton, it is tempting to speculate about the modulatory role\nof MAL in plasma membrane mobility.\nDuring Schwann cell development and differentiation,\naccurate cytoskeleton organization is crucial, and altered\ncytoskeletal architecture might influence the onset of\nmyelination by disturbing radial sorting. Two important\nmodulators for radial sorting are the Rho family\nNodari et al., 2007). Analysis of downstream targets of\nthe Rac1 and Cdc42 signaling pathways revealed, how-\never, no altered transcription in MAL-overexpressing\nSchwann cells, proposing that these signaling cascades\nare also functional in MAL-overexpressing Schwann\ncells (Supplementary Table 5).\nBesides proper cytoskeleton organization, the correct\nassembly of the ECM is also essential for accurate myelin\nformation. Indeed, a number of transcripts of genes asso-\nciated with the ECM were differentially regulated\nin Schwann cells overexpressing MAL, such as -dystro-\nbrevin, dystroglycan, and collagen type II 1. In addition\nto proper gene expression levels of ECM members, accur-\nate sulfatide levels are required to anchor laminin-1\nconsequently to assemble the basal lamina (Li et al.,\nshowed that MAL binds sulfatide (Frank et al., 1998;\nSaravanan et al., 2004). This finding suggests that\nMAL-dependent binding of sulfatide influences func-\ntional integration of laminins into the basal lam-\nina, resulting in impaired integrin- and dystroglycan-\nmediated signaling and by that effect myelination in\nSchwann cells.\nMAL Overexpression Altered Expression of Genes\nAssociated With Palmitate\nBioinformatic analysis of highly significantly reduced\ngenes in MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells revealed an\nenrichment of the term palmitate. Palmitoylation is a\nreversible posttranslational modification by covalently\nadding the saturated fatty acid palmitate to cysteine resi-\ndues via thioester linkages, leading to increased protein\nhydrophobicity, and consequently facilitates interaction\nwith lipid bilayer (reviewed in Linder & Deschenes,\n2007). Long-chain saturated-free fatty acids such as\npalmitate accumulate in membrane lipid rafts and influ-\nence the lipid environment, which might result in altered\ndownstream signaling by affecting receptor functions\n(reviewed in Simons & Toomre, 2000). In Schwann\ncells, palmitoylation is required to translocate p75NTR\nprotein into cholesterol-rich domains of the plasma mem-\nbrane, which is crucial for subsequent cleavage by the\ng-secretase (Underwood et al., 2008). Further, palmitoy-\nlation of Pmp22 and Plp is implicated in the efficient pro-\ntein transport to the plasma membrane (Schneider et al.,\nimportant component of lipid rafts and is localized in\nthe trans-Golgi network, where lipid rafts are constituted.\nIt is tempting to speculate that MAL overexpression\nalters the composition of lipid rafts, consequently dis-\nturbing the balance of accurate palmitoylated proteins\nin particular signaling platforms. Thus, altered palmitoy-\nlation might lead to impaired downstream signaling influ-\nencing the efficiency of myelination in newborn MAL-\noverexpressing mice.\nConclusion\nMAL overexpression manifests retarted maturation of\nnonmyelinating and myelinating Schwann cells, indicated\nby differential expression of the myelin protein Mpz and\nThis presented study describes novel genes expressed by\nnonmyelinating as well as myelinating Schwann cells,\nwhich are differentially expressed in a MAL-dependent\nmanner and are implicated in the regulation of cytoskel-\netal organization and plasma membrane mobility.\nSummary statement\nMAL overexpression leads to reduced expression of Mpz\nand p75NTR, despite functional pathways and normal\nexpression of genes important for Schwann cell differenti-\nation. Particular differentially expressed genes implicated\nin cytoskeleton organization were identified, proposing\nthem as novel candidates influencing myelination.\nAuthor contribution\nDaniela Schmid and Nicole Schaeren-Wiemers designed the study.\nCell cultures, immunofluorescent stainings and qRT -PCR were\nperformed by Daniela Schmid, the microarray was performed by\nThomas Zeis, and Monia Sobrio investigated the PI3-kinase/Akt\npathway.
