Introduction\nThe importance of the door for human civilization cannot be overstated.Across various times\nand cultures, the door has been a central technology for facilitating the distinction between\ninside and outside, individuals and society, private and public, and profane and sacred.\nAccording to some, the door was the medium that initially turned the hunter into a shepherd,\nthereby distinguishing man from animal.2 In his essay \"Where are the Missing Masses,\"3\nBruno Latour traces the genealogy of door design. In his words: \"Walls are a nice invention,\nbut if there were no holes in them there would be no way to get in or out \u00ad they would be\nmausoleums or tombs ... So architects invented this hybrid: a wall hole, often called a door,\nwhich although common enough has always struck me as a miracle of technology.\"4\nThe \"thingness\" of the door is intimately tied to that of the threshold: the liminal space\nthat \"belongs neither to the inside nor the outside and is thus an extremely dangerous\nspace.\"5 According to anthropologist Arnold van Gennep: \"To cross the threshold is to\nunite oneself with a new world. It is thus an important act in marriage, adoption, ordination,\nand funeral ceremonies.\"6 Drawing on van Gennep, Victor Turner coined the term liminal-\nity, which refers to the marginal (or \"limen\") stage of transition whereby the subject of the\npassage ritual is invisible. In Turner's words, \"As members of society, most of us see only\nwhat we expect to see, and what we expect to see is what we are conditioned to see when\nwe have learned the definitions and classifications of our culture.\"7 Along similar lines,\nsociologist Pierre Bourdieu says about the door of the traditional Berber house that:\nDuring the summer the door of the house must remain open all day long so that the fertilizing\nlight of the sun may enter, and with it prosperity. A closed door means penury and sterility:\nto sit down upon the threshold means, by obstructing it, to close the passage to happiness and\nplenitude. When one wishes prosperity to someone one says: \"May your door remain open.\"8\n 9. Latour, \"Where are the Missing Masses?,\" p. 159.\n 10. Siegert, \"Doors: On the Materiality of the Symbolic,\" 9.\nAlthough in contemporary western cultures doors have seemingly been relieved of such\nrituals of passage and reduced to their straightforward materiality, the symbolic and even\nspiritual meanings assigned to the liminal space between \"in\" and \"out\" are still acutely\nrelevant. The space of the door is, quite literally, a liminal space. Looking at how\nAmerican courts have construed this space may thus help us understand how they con-\nceive liminality more broadly. Furthermore, studying the legal geography of doors may\ncontribute to a deeper understanding of other legal thresholds.\nDespite its benign appearance, the door is never a neutral technology. Latour points\nout the various ways in which doors discriminate. The heavy hydraulic door, for exam-\nple, discriminates against the very little and very old, as well as \"against furniture remov-\ners and in general everyone with packages, which usually means, in our late capitalist\nsociety, working- or lower-middle-class employees.\"9 Hence, doors are not only an\narchitectural medium; they are also \"operators of symbolic, epistemic, and social pro-\ncesses that, with help from the difference between inside and outside, generate spheres\nof law, secrecy, and privacy and thereby articulate space in such a way that it becomes a\ncarrier of cultural codes.\"10\nDrawing on the insights of Science and Technology Studies (STS), this article will\nexplore how the door matters inAmerican FourthAmendment jurisprudence. I will begin\nwith a brief account of the importance of the home \u00ad into which the door provides both\nvisual access (similar to a window) and an opportunity for bodily entry \u00ad in American\ncriminal procedure. Next, I will discuss the spatiolegal rituals performed by the police,\nand the case law established by American courts, with regard to the door. In particular, I\nwill focus on police searches and seizures that illuminate the door's liminal legal geog-\nraphy. Finally, I will highlight law's focus on vision, mainly in the context of the home\nbut also with respect to cars.\nIn light of recent technological advancements that enhance the ability to literally see\nthrough walls, we might be witnessing the end of the physical door era and the beginning\nof a virtual door era. Currently, the courts seem to be operating as if the door still blocks\nview, but this may change as the technology presents increasingly sophisticated challenges\nto the distinctions between in and out, private and public, and legal and illegal visions. This\nis therefore an important moment for reflecting on what U.S. courts and American society\nat large believe is worthy of protection on the inside of the residential door.\nThroughout the article I revisit Latour's realization that, \"To balance our accounts of\nsociety, we simply have to turn our exclusive attention from humans and look also at\nnonhumans.\"11 My analysis here will show that the door's meanings and materialities\nare, in fact, inseparable. The door, in other words, is both a symbol of sacred domesticity\nand a technology that possesses material agency. The door also provides an allegorical\nentry into a bizarre constitutional discourse whereby doors both embody and represent\nthe relationship between the Government, on one side of the door, and the People, on the\ndoor's other side.\n 13.

The Home as One's Castle\nLaw makes and unmakes the home.\n--Jeannie Suk, \"Taking the Home\"12\nThe home is conventionally described in legal discourse as a refuge or sanctuary, a for-\ntress or castle, and a haven in a heartless world.13 Even the \"poorest man['s] ruined tene-\nment\"14 is afforded the same protections, including the ability to exclude the king from\nentering with impunity.15 A man's home is his \"castle and fortress.\"16 The sanctity of the\nhome is not a unique invention of American, or even English, law: it has been the nexus\nof certain protections as far back as the Code of Hammurabi17 and descends from \"the\nsentiments of ancient Rome.\"18 The direct antecedent to the American protections of the\nhome are the protections afforded to eighteenth-century British landowners. Indeed,\n\"The British state ... existed to preserve the property and, incidentally, the lives and\nliberties, of the propertied.\"19\nThe home assumes a unique significance in modern liberal societies, where it pro-\nvides a nest for individuality, family, privacy, security, and liberty.20 In the words of\nDavid Delaney: \"In our world, it's fair to say, the modern home is more specifically\nregistered as the liberal home . . . Hence the interpretive and affective salience of the\npublic/private distinction; hence the valorization of privacy, security, protection, and\nself-expression; hence the expression of these in the idioms of rights.\"21 The physical\n 22.

Houses are mentioned explicitly in both the Third and Fourth\nAmendments22 and implicitly in the First Amendment,23 indicating a clear concern for\nthis space by the framers of the U.S. Constitution.24 The protections and importance of\nthe house/home are recognized, additionally, in many other areas of the law.25\nMy central concern in this article is the hybrid legal geography of wall and hole\n(\"door\") that serves as the \"obligatory passage point\"26 to the home and how this hybrid\nspatiolegal entity is interpreted in the context of Fourth Amendment protections. The\nFourth Amendment establishes:\nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against\nunreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon\nprobable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be\nsearched, and the persons or things to be seized.27\nThe federal courts have been acutely sensitive to one's reasonable expectation of privacy\nin the home.28 Until the monumental 1967 Supreme Court decision of Katz that\n[automobile searches] because the expectation of privacy with respect to one's automobile\nis significantly less than that relating to one's home or office\" (footnote omitted)); United\nchief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed . . .\"); Warden\nsanctities of a man's home and the privacies of life\"), quoting Boyd v.

[T]he Constitution requires a magistrate to pass on the desires of the\npolice before they violate the privacies of the home\"); Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S.\na home is . . . a grave concern, not only to the individual but to a society which chooses to\nof the privacy protection secured by the Fourth Amendment\"); Commonwealth v. Forde,\nwhatever purpose, represents a serious governmental intrusion into one's privacy. It was just\nthis sort of intrusion that the Fourth Amendment was designed to circumscribe by the gen-\neral requirement of a judicial determination of probable cause\"); Sir Edward Coke, Third\nInstitute of the Laws of England 162 (1644) (\"a man's house is his castle\").\n 32. Pesciotta, \"I'm Not Dead Yet,\" 196, citing Russell L. Weaver, \"The Fourth Amendment,\nincorporated the concept of privacy into the juridical analysis,29 the Court's interpretation\nof the Fourth Amendment was concerned primarily with its tangible geographies, which\nit based on a finite list in the Constitution. The main threat to the house was, in other\nwords, its physical invasion30 and the protected right was the \"indefeasible right . . . of\nprivate property.\"31 Subsequent developments in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence main-\ntain the same underlying logic of protecting the home from invasion.32 Yet whereas some\ncases are concerned with physical bodily invasion by the state into the intimacies of the\nhome \u00ad namely, with the function of the door as a technology that enables and disables a\nfull bodily entry \u00ad other cases focus on the permissibility of governmental gazes into the\nhome through the door \u00ad namely the door's function as a window. Finally, the invention\nof technologies that enable seeing through walls without the use of doors (in their function\nas either door or window) has resulted in the configuration of doors in recent cases as\nsymbolic matters, as indicators of an illegal invasion into the privacy of one's home.\nDespite the recent challenges to the physical invasion approach of the Fourth\nAmendment, the Supreme Court has clarified that the trespass test still applies in this\nAmendment, the home is first among equals. At the Amendment's very core stands the right\nof a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental\nintrusion\") (internal quotations and citations omitted).\ncrimes involve other issues, including First Amendment and privacy protections.\ndwelling of another, the harm is the violation of the sanctity of the dwelling itself, not\nmerely to a particular person's property interest\").\ncussing the home in relation to various First Amendment rights).\ncontext.33 \"At the Amendment's very core stands the right of a man to retreat into his\nown home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion,\" the Supreme\nCourt Justices re-emphasized in their 2013 decision Florida v. Jardines.34 In another\ndecision, the Justices clarified their position that: \"The Fourth Amendment protects the\nindividual's privacy in a variety of settings. In none is the zone of privacy more clearly\ndefined that when bounded by the unambiguous physical dimensions of an individual's\nhome.\"35 In spite of the technological developments, then these and other cases charac-\nterize the protection of the home as a longstanding tradition and as a \"monument of\nEnglish freedom.\"36 Perhaps the most far-reaching protection in this regard is the gov-\nernment's lack of power to prosecute certain crimes when they occur exclusively within\nthe home, including obscenity and sodomy.37\nThe various constitutional protections against invasion are not limited to govern-\nmental actions. In addition to the property right to exclude others, the Supreme Court\nhas stated that there is no duty to retreat from attack \"on [one's] premises,\"38 and many\nstates39 have laws that afford defenses to citizens who use otherwise unacceptable force\nto defend the \"sanctity of their homes.\"40 This, again, is based on the assumption that a\n\"man's home is his castle\" and that its dweller has a right to defend it against intru-\nsion.41 A similar logic is applied to protect a \"man in his castle\" from the exercise of\nFirst Amendment rights by others.42 It is important to note in this context that feminist\ncritiques of homes as virtual traps for victims of intimate violence have led to government\n 43. Delaney, \"Home as Nomic Setting: Seeing How the Legal Happens,\" 64: \"The develop-\nment of Civil Protection Orders has empowered some abused women to expel and exclude\nfrom their homes those who torment them, or to avail themselves of the threat of arrest in\norder to augment bargaining power in their homes.\" See also Beverly Balos, \"The Legal\nResponse to Domestic Violence: Problems and Possibilities: A Man's Home is his Castle:\nHow the Law Shelters Domestic Violence and Sexual Harassment,\" St. Louis U. Pub. L.\n 44. Civil protection orders have recently been replaced by criminal protection orders. Some fem-\ninist legal scholars and advocates see this re-signification as having effectively empowered\nprosecutors at the expense of women insofar as women no longer control the terms of arrests\nand prosecutions (see Delaney, \"Home as Nomic Setting\"). In the words of Jeannie Suk:\nIf the rhetoric of privacy has worked in our history to justify nonintervention in the home,\nthe new regime relies on a rhetoric of publicness to envision the home as in need of pub-\nlic control, like the streets. The home, the archetype of private space, becomes a site of\nintense public investment . . . [I]n this regime, the home is a space in which criminal law\ndeliberately and coercively reorders and controls . . . relationships . . . not as an incident of\nprosecution, but as its goal.\nentry into the home in the form of protection orders43 and, more recently, to feminist\ncritiques of such orders.44\nIII. Delineating the Fourth Amendment Threshold\nThe critical importance of the home inAmerican jurisprudence manifests in the designation\nof heightened protections to privacy, property, and liberty when those are exercised within\nthe home. In the Fourth Amendment context, such enhanced protections against govern-\nmental (mostly police) intrusions have translated into the requirement that absent limited\nand pre-defined emergency situations (\"exigency\"), the police must obtain a warrant to\nlegally enter a home. The warrant is a judicially reviewed authorization granted to govern-\nmental officials to search or seize; it must be supported by an affidavit from the relevant\ngovernmental official that outlines the specific facts and scope of the search and that estab-\nlishes probable cause to believe that a crime has been, is being, or will be committed.\nGenerally, a police invasion of the home without obtaining a valid warrant based on proba-\nble cause will render the seized evidence inadmissible in court.At least on the face of things,\nthen, administrative obstacles inherently linked to the geography of police practices impose\nheightened scrutiny on such practices when they occur within the home. Demarcating where\nthe outside ends and where the home begins is thus crucial for ascertaining the legal rights\napplicable in each case. The stakes of this demarcation are incredibly high: they determine\nthe course of human lives, impelling them toward either freedom or incarceration.\nThe Supreme Court has long declared its intentions to come up with \"bright line\nrules\" in criminal procedure cases. In Payton v. New York (1980),45 the Supreme Court\nBy-Case Adjudication\" versus \"Standardized Procedures\": The Robinson Dilemma, 1974\n52. Brendan Peters, \"Fourth Amendment Yard Work: Curtilage's Mow-Line Rule,\" Stan. L.\nWork, Life, and Refuge in the Information Age (Notre Dame, IN: Sorin Books, 2002), p. 39\nand quoting Terence Riley, Chief Curator of the Museum of Modern Art's Department of\nArchitecture and Design, discussing Museum's exhibition The Un-Private House (1999).\nsituated the bright line at the door to the house. The Court also acknowledged that this\nline could be thin or thick, depending on the circumstances. To accommodate this vari-\nability, the Court adopted the common law doctrine of the curtilage, which expands the\nhouse's protections to the area immediately surrounding it. The Court, in other words,\neffectively expanded the house's protections to the \"intimate activity associated with the\n`sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life.'\"46\nUnited States v. Dunn (1987) provided additional guidance on how to determine the\nexistence and boundaries of the curtilage. The Court instructed that: \"curtilage questions\nshould be resolved with particular reference to four factors: the proximity of the area claimed\nto be curtilage to the home, whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the\nhome, the nature of the uses to which the area is put, and the steps taken by the resident to\nprotect the area from observation by people passing by.\"47 Through the curtilage doctrine,\nthe door's physical liminality and its function as an obligatory passage point has expanded\nto become one of an obligatory passage zone between outside (i.e., public, less protected)\nand inside (i.e., private, more protected) spaces. In Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, then,\nthe threshold is not limited to its quintessential form \u00ad the door \u00ad but includes proximate\nspaces that have acquired the door's liminal quality. Although not situated inside the house,\nthese spaces still receive similarly heightened legal protections.\nAlongside its "
