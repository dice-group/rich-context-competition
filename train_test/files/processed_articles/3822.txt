    "abstract": "Abstract\n`Leader' and `follower' are increasingly replacing `manager' and `worker' to become the routine\nway to frame hierarchy within organizations; a practice that obfuscates, even denies, structural\nantagonisms. Furthermore, given that many workers are indifferent to (and others despise) their\nbosses, assuming workers are `followers' of organizational elites seems not only managerialist, but\nblind to other forms of cultural identity. We feel that critical leadership studies should embrace\nand include a plurality of perspectives on the relationship between workers and their bosses.\nHowever, its impact as a critical project may be limited by the way it has generally adopted this\nmainstream rhetoric of leader/follower. By not being `critical' enough about its own discursive\npractices, critical leadership studies risk reproducing the very kind of leaderism it seeks to\ncondemn.\n",

We have even come across the\nCorresponding author:\nMark Learmonth, Durham University Business School, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, UK.\nEmail: mark.learmonth@durham.ac.uk\nLeadership\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/lea\nterm `middle-leader' in an advert for a school teacher. As Alvesson and Spicer (2014: 40;\nitalics in original) argue:\nIn many instances, embracing the idea of leadership does not involve any significant change to\npractice but merely indicates an interest in relabeling managerial work as ``leadership'' to make it\nsound more fashionable and impressive. The term leadership is seductive, has a strong rhetorical\nappeal, and is therefore heavily overused.\nHowever, this slippage between manager/leader and worker/follower is more than merely\nrebranding with a more fashionable label. It relies on a logic of equivalence: on understand-\ning leadership as equivalent to a role or a kind of work. Because it relies on a logic of\nequivalence, rather than a subtle interpenetration of meanings or gradual porousness in\nthe terms leader/manager and follower/worker, the shift to leadership represents a significant\nshift in discursive terrain. Basic categories, fundamental to understanding work and the\nemployment relationship, are disappearing. In their place are labels that implicitly depict\na unitarist perspective of the labour process. The manager/worker dyad makes a power\nimbalance explicit and includes the possibility that interests will diverge. Leader/follower\nby contrast entails a common goal. It glosses fundamental questions about prerogative\nbecause a worker can question managerial prerogative, but it does not quite make sense\nfor `followers' to question their leaders' basic authority in that way.\nThis shift to discourse about leaders could be attributed partly to a mushrooming literature\n2013). However, and paradoxically, calling someone a leader just because they inhabit a role,\nor carry out a kind of work goes against the prevailing construction of leadership in the\nliterature. Contemporary leadership scholars tend to understand terms like leader and fol-\nlower as referencing identities that are in some ways chosen and personal (which could be\nconsistent with the leader/manager slippage), but that are also enacted relationally (which is\nnot). According to most thinking about leadership, to be a leader is not merely to inhabit a\nrole, it is to identify as a leader, and for others to orient towards that identity or to sanction it\nin some way (Grint, 2010). This is significant because at the same time as editing out terms\nwhich potentially signal divergent interests (e.g. manager/worker), popular discourse on\nleader/follower also airbrushes out any sense of consent or relationality. If a senior executive\nis axiomatically a leader, those below are axiomatically followers \u00ad whether they like it or not.\nWe have been troubled by the practice of habitually calling people leaders and followers,\nas if they were synonyms for manager and worker, ever since starting to notice it; not least\nbecause of the experiences one of us (Mark) had while working as a manager in the UK\nNational Health Service (NHS) in the 1980s and `90s. But even to say NHS `manager' in the\ncontext of the early 1980s NHS is not quite correct. When Mark first started in the NHS no\none officially had that title; everyone was an administrator. In 1983, however, after a gov-\nernment inquiry suggested that management should be introduced into the NHS there was\noverwhelming enthusiasm for the change. Overwhelming enthusiasm, that is, amongst the\nnewly named managers (i.e. former administrators); but it came about only with strong\nbacking from the Thatcher government, in the teeth of opposition from clinicians (Strong\nand Robinson, 1990). One thing that did unite the newly up-titled managers with the clin-\nicians, however, was a shared intuition: that an apparently simple change in job title \u00ad from\nadministrator to manager \u00ad represented a shift in power dynamics (Bresnen et al., 2014;\nLearmonth, 2005), one that would serve the interests of some (e.g. the new managers) over\nothers (e.g. the clinicians).\nA generation on, we can see a comparable shift occurring across all sectors and industries.\nOnly now we are calling the managers leaders (Ford and Harding, 2007; Martin and\nLearmonth, 2012; O'Reilly and Reed, 2011). The shift is occurring gradually and informally,\nitself [is] beginning to go out of fashion (being discursively articulated as something rather\nlike administration) and leadership [represents] the new panacea'.\nOur aim in this paper is to demonstrate the problematic effects that accompany the routine\nuse of a leader/follower rhetoric \u00ad what one might call the language of leadership \u00ad especially\nin the context of critical leadership studies (CLS) research. Our intent is not so much to\ndebate what leaders and followers are, but to show what the use of these terms does; par-\nticularly when deployed as apparently routine and more-or-less unnoticed generics for hier-\narchical groups within organizations. What we call things sanctions certain forms of\ndiscourse and knowledge, while disqualifying other possible ways of knowing and being in\nthe world. Yet for all its considerable merits in many other ways, much of CLS appears to\nuse the leader/follower dualism just like the mainstream \u00ad taking these terms as merely the\nbuilding blocks of analysis; in and of themselves necessary, natural and unproblematic.\nLabels are never innocent though. Social scientists do not simply describe the world, we\nalso constitute it. Calling people leaders and followers potentially has a range of effects,\nwhich might encourage us to be cautious in the use of these terms. As Alvesson and\nKa\n\u00a8 rreman (2016:142) argue, the terms leadership and followership are predominantly\nused `to build and maintain a positive, celebrating, even glamorous view of organizational\nrelations [while] naturalizing and freezing (asymmetrical) social relations'.\nThe basic point, therefore, is that what we call people matters \u00ad and so reflexivity about\nthe effects of our naming practices is necessary. Unfortunately, when it comes to founda-\ntional terms like leader and follower, such reflexivity appears to be largely absent in CLS.\nCollinson (2011: 181) describes how CLS has `a concern to critique the power relations and\nidentity constructions through which leadership dynamics are reproduced'. We agree; but\nargue that by routinely adopting the language of leadership, CLS risks being implicated in\nthe very power relations it sets out to critique.\nIn developing this argument, our article proceeds by providing critical readings of recent\nleading work in CLS to show that:\n(1) In spite of its claims to be distinctive from critical management studies (CMS), often\nCLS is only definitively about leadership because of its preference for the terms leader\nand follower. It seems as if more traditional terms like manager and worker have simply\nbeen crossed-out by CLS researchers and replaced with leader and follower.\n(2) Unfortunately, this preference for the language of leadership affects the tone of CLS work\n\u00ad naturalizing the interests of elites while de-radicalizing critique. Indeed, trying to be\ncritical while using the language of leadership can strike some very odd-sounding notes.\nCritical Leadership Studies\nAlmost since the idea of organizational leadership was first introduced, leadership has had\nits critics. A full review of literature critical of leadership in various ways is beyond the scope\nof this article (for such a review see Tourish, 2013). However, exemplary work includes for us\nlandmark papers such as Meindl et al.'s (1985: 79) analysis of the romance of leadership,\nsomething which is: `hinted at in the observations made by a number of social and organ-\nizational analysts who have noted the esteem, prestige, charisma, and heroism attached to\nvarious conceptions and forms of leadership'. It also includes Smircich and Morgan's (1982:\n258) critique of leadership as the management of meaning:\nThe leader exists as a formal leader only when he or she achieves a situation in which an obliga-\ntion, expectation or right to frame experience is presumed, or offered and accepted by others. . . . It\ninvolves a complicity or process of negotiation through which certain individuals, implicitly or\nexplicitly, surrender their power to define the nature of their nature of their experience to others.\nIndeed leadership depends on the existence of individuals willing, as a result of inclination or\npressure, to surrender, at least in part, the powers to shape and define their own reality.\nSince the 1980s, if not before, we have been able to see that what generally gets referred to as\nleadership tends to be bound up with insidious forms of power asymmetries, overly roman-\nticized celebration, covert complicities and the surrender of agency. These features all signal\nleadership as a problem in itself, something which is hardly the mainstream view. Such a\nreading of leadership is rarely, if ever, explicit in the corporate courses that have proliferated\nin recent years, nor in responses to remotely administered questionnaires that much main-\nstream work in the field pursues. Indeed, it is only in the last few years that CLS has emerged\nas a separately recognizable approach to studying and critiquing leadership.\nThe emergence of CLS is closely related to the growth of the more established tradition of\nCMS. Briefly, CMS is a diverse set of ideas which, rather than being concerned primarily\nwith increasing organizational efficiency, seeks to reveal, challenge and overturn the power\nrelations within organizational life (King and Learmonth, 2015). This is a valuable under-\ntaking because, in contemporary industrial societies, it is through such structures that many\npeople are often constrained and dominated. CLS, as Collinson (2011: 182) argues, broadly\nshares CMS's political aims and intellectual traditions, but it attempts to broaden CMS's\nrange, in that it:\nExplicitly recognizes that, for good and/or ill, leaders and leadership dynamics (defined . . . as the\nshifting, asymmetrical interrelations between leaders, followers and contexts) also exercise sig-\nnificant power and influence over contemporary organizational and societal processes [whereas]\nmany CMS writers ignore the study of leadership, focusing more narrowly on management and\norganization.\nFairhurst and Grant (2010: 188) support Collinson's reading of CMS's limits in relation to\nleadership studies. For them also:\nCMS scholars tend to be less enamored of leadership per se . . . If CMS scholars mention lead-\nership at all, they cast it as a mechanism of domination . . . view it with suspicion for being overly\nreductionist . . . or proclaim a need for agnosticism.\nFurthermore, many in CLS remain alive to the dangers of essentializing leadership as\nsomething categorically distinct from management. As Collinson and Tourish (2015: 577)\nargue:\n[I]t makes sense to see management as somewhat more concerned with day-to-day operational\nactivities than leadership [nevertheless] the term leadership [as opposed to management] has\nheuristic value in that it captures the approach, perceptions, and interactional dynamics of\nvaried organizational actors when they encounter uncertain environments, powerful others,\nand complex strategic dilemmas, and in which the salience of leadership issues is therefore\nheightened. However, attempts to establish absolutist distinctions between them [leadership\nand management] can be viewed as another example of the ``dichotomizing tendency'' in lead-\nership studies.\nAnother feature of CLS, according to Collinson, is its emphasis on how `leadership dynam-\nics can emerge informally in more subordinated and dispersed relationships . . . as well as in\noppositional forms of organization such as trade unions . . . and revolutionary movements'\n(2011: 182). The prominence attached to this feature of CLS certainly reflects a critical point\nof view because rather than reproducing officially sanctioned corporate hierarchies it chal-\nlenges and subverts them. Indeed, work like Zoller and Fairhurst's (2007: 1332) study of\nresistance leadership \u00ad which highlights `the role of leadership in resisting and potentially\ntransforming structures of domination' provides an illustration of the critical potential in\nsuch work. They provide extended examples of the leadership of dissent, focusing `on the\nrole of perceived unfairness and injustice as a key resource of dissent mobilization'\n(2007: 1340). Take this excerpt, which uses the accounts of a participant ethnography by\nLaurie Graham (1995) who worked in an American automobile factory. It was in this setting\nthat Graham:\n[U]sed discourses around Japanese concepts of self-management and extant organizational\npolicy to fight the [recently introduced and unpopular] overtime requirement. However, her\nrefusal gains traction from other employees as it articulates simmering employee anger\naround this issue. Before this incident, she [Graham] describes angry reactions when the team\nleader asked employees to stay after shift to put away their tools because the line would no\nlonger stop five minutes early. Employees privately complained, saying things like `this is the\nkind of bullshit that brings in a union', and `this place is getting too Japanese around here'. She\nsays, `From that day on, whenever the line ran up to quitting time, all of us on the team dropped\nwhatever we were doing and immediately walked out, leaving the team leader to lock up the\ntools and clean the area' . . . That same month, after resentment grew about the mandatory\novertime, when the line kept moving after shift, `nearly everyone on the car side put on a\ncoat and walked out', although leaving a moving line is a cause for firing `and everybody\nAccording to Zoller and Fairhurst, activists and trade unionists \u00ad among other oppositional\ngroups \u00ad appropriate some of the influencing tools of leadership to advance causes that go\nagainst the interests of elites. It is unsurprising then, that Zoller and Fairhurst (2007: 1354)\nconclude by urging `more dialogue between leadership and critical researchers in order to\nunderstand resistance leadership'.\nWe welcome all the above aspirations, and unlike authors such as Gemmill and\nOakley (1992), we are not arguing for a blanket ban on using the term leadership in\norganizational scholarship. For us, the term can sometimes be a valuable category to\ndeploy, especially when used reflexively and judiciously to challenge and subvert its\nreceived usage in mainstream research. After all, foundational critical thinkers like\nWeber and Gramsci include discussions of leadership and its dynamics in their work.\nWhat we are against, however, is the a priori use of leader and follower to represent\ndifferent hierarchical groups \u00ad as a kind of master category for representing and under-\nstanding social and organizational dynamics. As we show in the next section, this is\ncommon practice in CLS \u00ad in spite of CLS's many other virtues \u00adsomething which\neffectively sets CLS against some of its own aspirations.\nIn order to explore the issues that arise, we now examine three prominent pieces of recent\nCLS writing in more detail. We should emphasize that we regard all three of them as highly\nsuccessful \u00ad and critical \u00ad in many ways. However, all three share an important blind spot: an\napparently unreflexive use of leader and follower. The first is Harding (2014), a paper we use\nto explore our claim that Critical Leadership Studies seems to be different from Critical\nManagement Studies only because of its preference to use leader and follower \u00ad and that\nmanager and worker would do just as well \u00ad at least in terms of semantics. The second is\nCollinson (2014) \u00ad an article we juxtapose with some of Collinson's earlier work (from 1988)\n\u00ad to show both how new this drift from manager to leader is; and why it matters. Finally, we\nexamine the work of Collinson and Tourish (2015) to demonstrate the dangers of the uni-\nversalization of leadership that an unreflexive use of leader and follower can imply \u00ad even in\nan article that is otherwise highly successful in critiquing mainstream leadership studies.\nSemantic swap: Crossing-out managers and workers\nLet us turn first to Harding (2014). To demonstrate how synonymous leader and manager,\nfollower and worker are, at least in Harding's usage, below is the article's abstract in full.\nEach reference to leadership/leader is replaced with management/manager; and each refer-\nence to follower is replaced with worker:\nThis paper develops a theory of the subjectivity of the leader manager through the philosophical\nlens of Hegel's master/slave dialectic and its recent interpretation by the philosopher Judith\nButler. This is used to analyse the working life history of a man who rose from poverty to a\nleadership management position in a large company and eventually to running his own successful\nbusiness. Hegel's dialectic is foundational to much Western thought, but in this paper, I rashly\nupdate it by inserting a leader manager in between the master, whose approval the leader\nmanager needs if s/he is to sustain self-hood, and the follower worker, who becomes a tool\nthat the leader manager uses when trying to gain that elusive approval. The analysis follows\nthe structure of Butler's reading of the Dialectic and develops understanding of the norms that\ngovern how leaders managers should act and the persons they should be. Hard work has become\nfor leaders managers an ethical endeavour, but they grieve the sacrifice of leisure. They enjoy a\nfrisson of erotic pleasure at their power over others but feel guilt as a result. They must prove\ntheir leadership management skills by ensuring their followers workers are perfect employees but\nat the same time must prove their followers workers are poor workers who need their continued\nleadership management. This leads to the conclusion that the leader manager is someone who is\nboth powerful and powerless. This analysis is intended not to demonize leaders managers, but to\nshow the harm that follows the emphasis on leadership management as a desirable and necessary\norganizational function.\nThere is no loss in meaning or resolution with these changes \u00ad showing how manager and\nworker here are direct synonyms for leader and follower. Also, the preference for leader/\nfollower has nothing to do with the paper's central problematic. Judith Butler's reading of\nHegel's master/slave would work with either leader/follower or manager/worker as the\ndialectic.\nThat these terms are interchangeable would probably be true of many articles in\nLeadership \u00ad especially those that focus on leadership as a positional and/or personal attri-\nbute; but a reason for focusing on Harding's paper is that in the body of the text she\nexplicitly makes leader equivalent to manager. She also signals that the identity of the\nleader/manager is intimately linked with capitalism: `it is on the body of ``the leader'',\n``boss'' or ``manager'' that capitalism is inscribed, and it is through the leader/boss/manager\nthat capitalism speaks' (2014: 392). She also writes of `follower\u00adbondsman\u00adworker'\n(Harding, 2014: 399) as synonyms. One is left to wonder, therefore, whether the article is\nabout leadership merely because it uses the terms leader and follower.\nIt clearly could have used manager and worker as its dominant terms; if it had done so\nthough, even with no other changes, Harding's work would presumably have been regarded\nas a contribution to CMS. However, if manager had been its preferred term, the article\nwould doubtless not have been published in Leadership. Indeed, one factor fuelling the\ngrowth in the language of leadership in organizational scholarship over the last few years\nmay well simply be the rise of journals like Leadership, which effectively require authors to\nrepresent their work in the language of leadership (The Leadership Quarterly, published from\n1990, was the first major journal of this type). Nevertheless, Harding's article is already being\ncommended as a model of writing in CLS (Collinson and Tourish, 2015; Tourish, 2015).\nDrift over time: From shop-floor worker to follower, from\n`the management' to leaders\nAs an illustration of why it matters whether we talk about leaders and followers or managers\nand workers consider Table 1. It is a short extract from the recent writings of David\nCollinson, juxtaposed with work he published some 26 years earlier.\nThe first thing that strikes us from this juxtaposition is just how radically Collinson has\nchosen to re-present his earlier work in the language of the leader/follower. We say re-\npresent, because throughout the whole of the 1988 paper he used neither term (leader nor\nfollower) at all. What this change does, however, is markedly to alter the tone of the two\nextracts. Whereas the 1988 piece has the feel of a radical critique of (the) management voiced\nin the language of the shop-floor, the leader/follower dualism (though the word employee is\nused once) gives the 2014 extract a rather more conciliatory, manager-orientated (or rather\nwe should say leader-orientated) tone. It is as if the 2014 version were addressed primarily to\nand written for so-called leaders \u00ad leaders who seem to be equated, a priori, with elites. It is\nstill critical in the sense that it says uncomfortable things to those elites, i.e. that they can be\nout of touch, unaware or unsympathetic. But all the Marxian-inflected rhetoric we find in the\n1988 extract (e.g. `obscure conflict'; `hierarchical structure of status and power'; `the polar-\nization between management and shop-floor' etc.) seems to have disappeared \u00ad along with\nthe terms manager and shop-floor worker. To our ears, these changes have the effect of\nsignificantly depoliticizing the 2014 account. They make the critique less challenging to the\npowerful, with no sense of workers' voices coming through.\nOur other main observation about the above table concerns the practice of calling people\nlike shop-floor workers followers. Follower seems so unlikely to be part of what Collinson\n(1988: 185) himself calls the `cultural identities' of most ordinary workers across the world.\nCan you imagine people like ```Fat Rat'', ``Bastard Jack'', ``Big Lemon'' and ``The Snake'''\n(nicknames for some of the people Collinson (1988: 185) encountered during his shop-floor\nethnography) thinking of their identity via the term follower? Surely not! Take the opening\nscene of the1960 British film Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (available at the time of\nwriting on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u00bczJAeb0wiQjA). The camera pans across a\nbusy factory before alighting on the protagonist, Arthur Seaton, played by Albert Finney,\nat his workbench. Speaking directly to the camera, Arthur says of his bosses: `Don't let the\nbastards grind you down!' Or what about Sergeant Milton Warden, played by Burt\nLancaster, in the 1953 Hollywood film From Here to Eternity. Though the figure of the\nmilitary officer is often taken as the consummate, archetypal leader, Warden memorably\ndeclares `I hate officers \u00ad I always hated officers!' and starts an affair with his own officer's\nwife, perhaps in part to prove the point.\nWe can see that a case might perhaps be made for calling such people followers built on\nnotions like multiple subjectivities or identities. Still, why does anyone need to use it, espe-\ncially as the routine term for people in lower hierarchical positions? To us, the thought of\npeople like Arthur Seaton or Sergeant Warden representing themselves as followers (of any\nkind of organizational elite) is more than simply misleading \u00ad it is risible \u00ad indeed, insulting\nto the many people today who share similarly dismissive views of the people in power over\nthem. How many academics would refer to themselves as `followers'? Yet many of us are\nready to label others with these terms, such that contemporary Arthur Seatons and Sergeant\nWardens are regularly being represented as followers in CLS research. Indeed, we find it\nhard to see any organizational context where the term `follower' might be appropriate (cf.\nBlom and Alvesson, 2015; Ford and Harding 2015). Its use seems as insulting and demean-\ning to workers as it is flattering to the managerial ego: a toxic combination!\nFraming the field: Alternatives to leadership, leadership?\nIt is important to emphasize that CLS writers who nowadays prefer to talk about leaders and\nfollowers leave no doubt that they propose a critical reading of organizational life. Indeed,\nCollinson and Tourish (2015) have recently provided radical criticisms of mainstream\nTable 1. From shop-floor worker to follower; from `the management' to leaders.\nMy own research in organizations over the past\n30 years has found a recurrent . . . pattern. This\nis for organizational leaders to be either una-\nware of organizational tensions and paradoxes\nor, if they are informed of them, to try to deny\nor downplay their nature, extent, and conse-\nquences. This is especially the case with regard\nto leaders' relations with followers/employees.\nLeaders' hierarchical position ``at the top'' of\norganizations can result in them being distant\nand detached from ``the front line'' where\nmany of the organization's tensions are often\nmost acutely experienced . . . Equally, followers\nmay face considerable difficulties and barriers\nin seeking to voice their ``critical upward\ncommunication'' to those in senior\npositions . . . Consequently, leaders can be lar-\ngely unaware of fundamental tensions and\ncontradictions embedded within routine\norganizational practices.\nShop-floor humour directed at managers was\nusually concerned to negate and distance\nthem . . . By contrast, management repeatedly\nsought to engage shop stewards in humorous\ninteraction. Yet, the stewards were aware that\nthis managerial humour was intended to\nobscure conflict behind personalized relations,\nwhich tried to deny the hierarchical structure\nof status and power . . . Six years earlier the\ncompany had been taken over by an American\nmulti-national . . . As part of the American's\ncampaign to win the trust of the workforce, a\ncompany in-house magazine was introduced.\nThe paper was dismissed widely as a `Let's be\npals act' and nicknamed . . . `Goebbel's\nGazette.'. . . The intention of managerial\nhumour [included in the Gazette], to reduce\nconflict and emphasize organizational harmony,\nhad the opposite effect of merely reinforcing\nthe polarization between management and\nshop-floor.\nleadership research and teaching. They advance, `the idea that leadership is socially con-\nstructed and interpreted and that ``it'' could mean very different things to different actors in\ndifferent situations' (578). They also remind readers of `the twin perils of hype and hubris'\n(580) in teaching students to be leaders, along with the need for `the teaching of leader-\nship . . . to go beyond a ``rotten apple'' theory of dysfunctionality and corruption to examine\nthe barrel within which the apples have soured' (586). While welcoming these sorts of state-\nments, we think the authors foreclose an even more radical critical analysis. Simply by the\nways in which they use the terms, they imply that leadership and followership are neutral,\nnatural and necessary categories of analysis. In other words, they fail to signal any reflexivity\nabout their representational practices.\nThis is important because many of their above critiques might be absorbed or otherwise\nappropriated by the mainstream (see e.g. Dinh et al., 2014; Schyns and Schilling, 2013 for\nmainstream work to have done so). However, the mainstream can deal much less readily\nwith the idea that its fundamental categories \u00ad leader and follower \u00ad may be interest serving\nin themselves. Unfortunately, this possibility is not \u00ad as far as we can see \u00ad even raised by\nCollinson and Tourish. Yet using the leader/follower dyad provides Collinson and Tourish\nwith numerous problems. For example, they are right to be troubled that those involved in\nmainstream leadership research and teaching `tend to assume that the interests of leaders and\nfollowers automatically coalesce, that leadership is an uncontested form of top-down influ-\nence, follower consent is its relatively unproblematic outcome and resistance is abnormal or\nirrational' (2015: 577). However, they appear to overlook the possibility that at the root of\nthe problem may lie the very terms themselves: that leader and follower semantically entail\ncoalescence. Part of the general understanding of leadership in our culture includes some-\nthing like `an uncontested form of top-down influence' just as, if someone is referred to as a\nfollower, s/he would generally be thought of as someone for whom `any resistance is abnor-\nmal or irrational'.\nTheir own formulation, `follower dissent and resistance' (2015: 576) crystallizes the dis-\ncursive problem they have set for themselves. In what sense can a person intelligibly remain a\nfollower while simultaneously displaying dissent and resistance? Someone who dissents and\nresists is surely (according to received English meanings) not a follower. The reader is left to\nresolve the contradiction within their formulation \u00ad presumably by concluding that at the\nlevel of identity the person is a follower \u00ad and that their dissenting and resistant behaviours\nmust merely be temporary aberrations. Such a conclusion is the opposite of a critical stance\non the identities of workers because the leader/follower formulation implies that ultimately\nboth leader and follower share the same goal. To avoid this problem \u00ad which one could say\nCollinson and Tourish have set for themselves \u00ad would be simple if they merely argued about\nworker dissent and resistance!\nBy using this language of leadership, Collinson and Tourish also fall into the trap\nAlvesson and Ka\nMany researchers find a market for work using the popular signifier ``leadership''\nbecause . . . mainstream approaches have made leadership fashionable. Many efforts to develop\n``alternative'' views thus at the same time partly break with and reinforce the domination of\n``leadership'' . . . Nuances involved in the efforts to revise ``leadership'' are easily lost as the major\nframing reinforces a dominating ``mega-discourse,'' weakening others. For example, this rein-\nforces an understanding that the alternative to leadership is leadership, not peer relations, pro-\nfessionalism, autonomy, co-workership, organizing processes, or mutual adjustment offering\nalternative framings and understanding than what the leadership vocabulary invites.\nCollinson and Tourish's work reinforces an understanding that `the alternative to leadership\nis leadership' by, for instance, encouraging students `to draw on their own experiences of\nleadership and followership dynamics in schools, workplaces and families' (2015: 581). To\nencourage such practices seems to be endorsing the use of the problematic discourse in new\nareas \u00ad young people's relations with one another in schools and in families \u00ad where, as far as\nwe know, even the most enthusiastic of mainstream leadership commentators have yet to\nventure (though see Harms and Spain (2016) for something close). In other words, Collinson\nand Tourish end up encouraging students to see leadership and followership almost\neverywhere.\nDiscussion\nThese critical readings of CLS's representational practices are reinforced when we observe that\nthe exponential growth in leadership's appeal since the 1980s has occurred during a period which\nalso witnessed the rise of neoliberalism and the consequent widespread defeat of trade union\npower (Brown, 2015). Indeed, given the extent to which they share strikingly similar unitary and\nindividualizing impulses, the current popularity of the language of leadership might be read as a\ndirect analogue for today's neoliberal consensus. An a priori use of formulations like leader and\nfollower is as useful to those at the top of big business \u00ad and as congruent with their interests \u00ad as\nother forms of neoliberal rhetoric; say, the redefinition of job insecurity as free agency or the\nportrayal of billionaire tycoons as regular guys. When workers can be controlled through their\nfreedoms the defenders of capitalism no longer have to crush labour resistance. Redefining\nthemselves \u00ad the defenders of capitalism \u00ad as leaders (with workers now cast as followers) is\nappealing as one potential avenue towards such control, not least because it tends to hollow out\nclassical notions of organizational politics, reducing debate about alienation and exploitation to\nproblem solving and team building (Lears, 2015).\nIn other words, the leader/follower dualism is hard to read as anything other than a denial\nof the central tenet of Marxian-inflected organizations analyses \u00ad the structured antagonism\nfamously begins with a series of dualisms that emphasize class struggle and conflict: `The\nhistory of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave,\npatrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word oppressor and\noppressed stood in constant opposition to one another'. The leader/follower dualism does\nnot fit Marx and Engel's list of oppositions \u00ad both leader and follower stop being merely\nnicer- or more fashionable-sounding synonyms for manager and worker in certain important\ncontexts. This is because the cultural valences associated with the language of leadership\nimply neither struggle between leader and follower nor anything else that might be particu-\nlarly oppressive or oppositional. Rather, they suggest that the norm is friendly relations, and\nthat a person's (i.e. a so-called follower's) primary allegiance is (or should be) to her leader \u00ad\nnot solidarity with other workers. In contrast, one of the classical terms in organizational\nanalysis \u00ad worker \u00ad is still, for many, within the trade union movement and beyond, emblem-\natic of class solidarity; it certainly seems unlikely to naturalize asymmetrical social relations\nin the same way as follower might. Thus, traditional analytical dualisms like manager/\nworker or capital/labour (as opposed to leader/follower) leave rhetorical space for solidarity\nand radical resistance; whereas those starting to be constructed as followers might well\nassume that they can legitimately offer no more than (what their so-called leaders would\nsee as) `constructive resistance' (Uhl-Bien et al., 2014: 93).\nIn sum, any `critical' work on leadership that uses leader and follower as a priori, uni-\nversal categories will lack a certain potential for critique. This framing forecloses radical\nresistance and is more easily assimilated with dominant albeit unexamined ideals in the\nleadership literature. For instance, if we begin by thinking in terms of leader/follower, it\ntakes us closer to a pro-hegemonic ideal: that a core part of what leaders do is to frame\nreality for their `followers'. It also lends independent authority to the pro-hegemonic ideal\nthat `followers' willingly surrender their powers to shape their own realities. So, rather than,\nas Collinson and Tourish (2015: 577) believe, being `fundamentally about the effective or\nineffective exercise of power, authority, and influence' we suggest that the terms leadership\nand followership are at root performative (Gond et al., 2015). By which we mean, in a\nnutshell, that if someone is called a leader or a follower often enough the very act itself\ntends to bring about what it says; typically to the bosses' benefit and to workers'\ndisadvantage.\nNevertheless, the language of leadership is undoubtedly an important phenomenon in\ntoday's society. Indeed, the rhetoric is becoming so widespread in many organizational\ncontexts that as Morrell and Hewison (2013: 70) show `it becomes impossible to see an\nalternative to ``leadership'' . . . leadership is, seemingly, anything and everything'.\nBrocklehurst et al. (2010: 10) are therefore surely correct in claiming that `leadership is\nboth congruent with, and emblematic of, dominant contemporary understandings of what\nis valuable in organizations'. As such, it needs critical analsis; and for this reason alone we\nneed CLS. But as many feminists, post-colonial and queer theorists (among others) have\nperhaps often impossible, to construct radical critique in the language of the powerful.\nWe suggest, therefore, that CLS stops trying. Let us continually question the effects of the\nlanguage of leadership \u00ad and use alternatives \u00ad rather than routinely deploying it ourselves.\nWe have already cited some possible alternatives from Alvesson and Ka\n`peer relations, professionalism, autonomy, co-workership, organizing processes, or mutual\nadjustment'. We might also suggest that instead of follower terms like dissenter or radical\ncould be used. But to keep things simple, while the pairing is hardly entirely unproblematic\nin itself, simply going back to the language of manager and worker seems to us to be one step\nin the right direction.\nConclusion\nAdmittedly, to stop talking about leaders might be easier said than done. One of the reasons\nfor this difficulty is that the language of leadership is becoming so institutionalized. For\nexample, as the holder of the office of Deputy Dean at his Business School, one of us (Mark)\ndoes not officially have an administrative job, nor even a management role; rather, according\nto the university's designation he holds a `leadership position'. In these contexts it is espe-\ncially difficult to oppose the language of leadership, not least because the practice is caught\nup in a new kind of common sense; what Brown (2015) calls (in the title of her book) `neo-\nliberalism's stealth revolution'. What is more, any opposition is made even harder when\nmany critical colleagues seem happy simply to go along with such changes.\nOne possibility, if we must talk about leadership in our scholarship, is to do so outside\nconventional organizational contexts where consent and personal relationships are clearly\npredominant. To focus, in other words, on those instances where leadership is developed\nfreely and collaboratively between people \u00ad and not on those circumstances when\n`leadership' is imposed \u00ad as is common in corporate settings. Alternatively, we might confine\nour use of leadership to obviously subversive contexts. An example of the former approach is\nprovided by Humphreys et al.'s (2012) examination of leadership in jazz bands. In discussing\nhow musicians such as Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Art Blakey and Winton Marsalis might\nbe thought of as `leaders' the authors move decisively away from any sort of corporate\nsetting and into an arena where leaders generally emerge with the consent and enthusiasm\nof their musical peers. As they put it: `jazz [is] the focus of our research because equivocality\nis central to its very essence' (2012: 42). Nevertheless, perhaps in part because the corporate\nresonances of leadership are so strong, some of the reactions to their article from people\noutside academia appear to assume that they were simply providing lessons for business\nfrom jazz (Arnot, 2012). Dangers of similar misunderstandings, or even deliberate appro-\npriation, mean that we prefer the second option, and try to use leadership in ways that are as\nunambiguously subversive as possible. While misunderstanding or appropriation by elites\nis always a lurking threat for any work that talks about leadership, with colleagues one of\nus has, for example, explored leadership using queer theory (Ford et al., 2008; Harding\nOn a final note, earlier, we mentioned the classic movies Saturday Night, Sunday Morning\nand From Here to Eternity because their characters contradict some of the assumptions\nof the discourses of followership. Well, what about the 2010 British film (and subsequent\nsuccessful London West End musical) Made in Dagenham? For us, this movie subverts\nthe mainstream notions of both leader and follower in interesting ways \u00ad while also\nlinking notions of leadership with ideas about capitalism and patriarchy. The film is\nbased on historical events of worker resistance in Britain in the 1960s (see http://\nwww.traileraddict.com/made-in-dagenham/trailer), and like the other two films its central\ncharacter is a working-class hero; only this time she is a woman, Rita O'Grady, played by\nSally Hawkins.\nRita takes the initiative amongst her female colleagues to encourage them to stand up\nagainst an oppressive Dagenham Ford factory management who refuse to pay fair wages to\nwomen. On behalf of the other women, Rita subsequently finds herself taking on a male-\ndominated trade union movement ambivalent about equal pay for women, and eventually,\nthe UK government's Employment Secretary, Barbara Castle. Rita and her colleagues ultim-\nately win their dispute, and in the process are instrumental in bringing about a change in the\nlaw: the Equal Pay Act of 1970. Rita can be understood, in other words, as a superb\nexemplar of Zoller and Fairhurst's (2007) resistance leadership. Indeed, in the film, Rita's\nlocal shop steward calls her a leader `who inspires the other girls'. It seems likely that no\nshop steward (or anyone else) would have called Rita a leader back in the 1960s. This\nparticular line is probably a reflection of the preoccupations and cultural scripts of the\nearly 21st century when the screenplay was written (although men referring to adult\nwomen as `girls' is no doubt, rather more characteristic of the 1960s). Nevertheless, if\nRita can usefully be thought of as a leader then she was only a leader because of the explicit\nand enthusiastic consent and support of her colleagues. As opposed to a leader in a corpor-\nate setting, Rita was not a boss in any sense. She certainly never got more pay than the\nothers, nor got any sort of other reward. In fact, she took on her responsibilities with great\nreluctance and paid a high price for doing so in terms of the pressure they brought to bear on\nher family and personal life.\nHowever, no one would ever have called Rita a follower, surely \u00ad please, no! Just as\nArthur Seaton and Sergeant Warden did, she clearly despised those, like Mr Clarke (one of\nthe Ford bosses) who were supposed to be in charge of her. In fact, the following words are\nincluded in the trailer to the movie: `I call Mr Clarke a complete cock!'\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nReferences\nAlvesson M and Ka\n\u00a8 rreman D (2016) Intellectual Failure and Ideological Success in Organization\nStudies: The Case of Transformational Leadership.
