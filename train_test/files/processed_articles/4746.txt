The Delphi methodology was used to develop\nguidelines to fill this evidence gap. An online questionnaire containing potential guideline statements was developed following\na literature search and input from two focus groups. Two expert panels (Youth Mental Health First Aid instructors and\nyoung consumer advocates) rated the questionnaire over three rounds, according to whether or not they believed that the\nstatements should be included in the guidelines. Results were analyzed by comparing endorsement rates between the panels.\nOf the 175 statements presented, 80 were rated as essential or important by 90% of both panels and were included in the\nguidelines. The Delphi process has offered an effective way to achieve consensus between expert panels on useful tips to help\nadults communicate with adolescents.\n",

Some adolescents do not seek help because\nof the stigma around mental illness and concern that they\nwill be judged negatively by others (Hinshaw, 2005; Jorm &\nWright, 2007; Walker, Coleman, Lee, Squire, & Friesen,\nAdolescents with high levels of depressive symptoms\n(Sawyer et al., 2012) as well as those with suicidal ideation\nare less likely to seek help for their symptoms (Deane,\nWilson, & Ciarrochi, 2001; Wilson, Deane, & Ciarrochi,\n2005). Adolescent males have particularly low levels of help\nseeking (Rickwood et al., 2005). According to data from the\ncriteria for a mental disorder in the previous 12 months but\nonly 13.2% of them accessed mental health services (Reavley,\nCvetkovski, Jorm, & Lubman, 2010).

Adults can play an important role in actively engaging\nwith adolescents, rather than waiting for them to initiate help\nseeking (Sawyer et al., 2012) by recognizing that there is a\nmental health problem, providing information, encouraging\nprofessional help, and providing support (Highet, Thompson,\n& Jorm, 2013). It is vital that adults have knowledge and\nskills about providing help for a mental illness and be able to\ncommunicate this to the adolescent. As there is no current\nbenchmark to guide adults in the general community on this\ntopic, guidelines are needed.\nThe aim of the current study was to develop guidelines for\nadults in the general community to communicate effectively\nwith adolescents about mental health problems and other\nsensitive topics such as substance misuse, same sex attrac-\ntion, bullying and abuse, body dissatisfaction, relationship\nproblems, and physical development or illness. The guide-\nlines are aimed at adults who are not necessarily the adoles-\ncent's parent, for example, family members, teachers, sports\ncoaches, employers, employees, chaplains, or other service\npersonnel who have contact with adolescents.\nMethod\nIt would be unethical to undertake a randomized controlled\ntrial to evaluate the best way for an adult to communicate\nwith an adolescent who may be developing a mental illness,\nas it implies that only one group of adolescents would receive\nthe intervention (i.e., communication tips), while the control\ngroup may receive substandard care (Miller & Brody, 2002)\nthat could expose those adolescents to harms such as deterio-\nration of mental health. Therefore, the accompanying guide-\nlines were developed using a literature search and focus\ngroups to develop questionnaire statements, and the Delphi\nconsensus method to rate statements. The study was approved\nby the Mental Health Research and Ethics Committee of the\nLiterature Search\nA literature search was used to find existing information on\ntips for adults to communicate with adolescents in general,\nas well as on mental health and other sensitive issues. This\nincluded journal articles, books, websites, and carers' manu-\nals. Searches were conducted on Google Scholar, PubMed,\nPsychInfo, and Academic Search Premier, using the terms\n\"effective communication with\" OR \"guidelines to/for\nengag*,\" \"listening to\" OR \"communicat* with\" OR \"com-\nmunicat* tips for adults\" OR \"talking with\" OR \"sensitive\nissues and\" OR \"mental health\" AND \"teen*/adolescent*/\nyouth/young people/person.\"\nInformation that was aimed purely at parents was\nexcluded, as much of this was written in the context of a\nparent\u00adadolescent relationship and could not be applied to\nadults in the broader community. Similarly, literature that\nfocused on communication tips for health professionals was\nalso excluded, as this was aimed at engagement in the \"con-\nsulting room.\" Any communication tips that were more\nappropriate for counseling or therapy were not included, as\nthese were beyond the scope of providing initial assistance to\nan adolescent by adults in general. Statements that did not\ndescribe an action were excluded, as were statements aimed\nat specific scenarios.\nParticipants\nTwo focus groups--one of consumers, the other clinicians--\nwere recruited from Orygen Youth Health (Orygen), a youth-\nspecific mental health service in Melbourne, Australia. One\ngroup comprised current or past clients from Orygen who\nwere part of a consumer advisory group. An overview of the\nproject was presented during a meeting of the group, fol-\nlowed by an email invitation from the group coordinator to\ninclude those absent. Only those who considered themselves\nto be functioning well were encouraged to volunteer. In total,\nseven were recruited comprising two males and five females.\nThe other group, comprising clinicians and case managers\nfrom Orygen, was invited by email to participate. These cli-\nnicians were invited on the basis of having had experience of\ntreating severely distressed adolescents and who could con-\ntribute to discussion on communication techniques that were\neffective in those instances. As with the literature search, any\nFischer et al. 3\ntechniques used in counseling or therapy were omitted as it\nwould be inappropriate for adults in the general community\nto assume the role of a clinician. In total, five clinicians were\nrecruited, comprising a male and four females.\nEach group met separately for 1.5 hr. The consumers\nreceived a small gratuity for participating. Each group was\nadvised that an audio recording would be made during the\nmeeting and all participants signed a consent form. The\ngroups were facilitated by one of the authors (C.M.K.) while\nanother author (J.A.F.) took notes. To guide focus group dis-\ncussion, the following questions were posed:\nConsumer group\n\"Think about a time when you were a teenager when you were\ntalking to an adult and you really felt that they were\ncommunicating effectively with you. Don't think about a very\ndistressing time, or tell us what the conversation was about.\nThink about what they said, how they said it and their body\nlanguage. What was it that made you feel heard and understood?\"\nIn order to avoid possible distressing memories of a failed\nattempt at communicating with an adult (or its consequences),\nconsumers were not asked to reflect on techniques that did not\nwork for them.\nClinician and case manager group\n\"Reflect upon what you find works and does not work when\ncommunicating with young people. Think about how an adult\ncan make a young person feel comfortable, heard and understood\nwhen talking to them, e.g., body language, what the adult can\nsay and how they should say it.\"\nQuestionnaire Development\nJAF transcribed the audio recordings from each focus group\nand extracted identified patterns of meaning to create poten-\ntial themes (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Data around each poten-\ntial theme were grouped into paragraphs. This process was\nreplicated for text found in the literature search and com-\nbined with focus group data. Ideas within each paragraph\nwere written as statements to create draft questionnaire\nitems. This involved writing one idea per statement, with no\nambiguity, written as an action, with minimal overlap with\nother items. A working party of the authors met to discuss\nand refine the draft items to ensure uniformity while trying to\nremain as faithful as possible to the original wording or\nsource.\nThe questionnaire was divided into six sections: planning\nyour approach (10 items), engaging with the adolescent\n(45 items), what to say and how (49 items), body language\n(22 items), discussing options (20 items), and handling dif-\nficulties in the conversation (8 items). Cultural items were\nincluded within these headings and were written in general\nterms so that they could be applied to a broad range of cul-\ntures, including that of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander\npeoples.\nExpert Panelists\nTwo panels of experts were recruited to complete the online\nquestionnaire: a professional panel with expertise in adoles-\ncent mental health (Youth Mental Health First Aid instruc-\ntors) and a panel of youth mental health consumer advocates\naged 18 to 25 years. This age range was chosen because it\ninvolved young people who were close to the adolescent age\ngroup but mature enough to reflect on what would be appro-\npriate communication. The professional panel was recruited\nby emailing all accredited Youth Mental Health First Aid\n(MHFA) instructors currently practicing within Australia.\nMany hold additional roles such as teacher, registered nurse,\nschool counselor, trainer, and CEO, or manager of a mental\nhealthordisabilityservice.Outof383instructorsapproached,\nThe young consumer advocates were recruited from two\nservices from across Australia, via an email request sent\nfrom their internal networks on behalf of the authors. The\nfirst was ReachOut, which is an online community space for\nyoung people with an emphasis on mental health and well-\nbeing. ReachOut has a group of ambassadors from which six\npanel members were drawn; two ambassadors volunteered\nfrom each of the following states: Western Australia, New\nSouth Wales, and Queensland. The second service was\nbeyondblue, Australia's national depression initiative, which\nhas a consumer advocacy group called \"bluevoices.\" An\nemail was sent to 140 bluevoices members, of whom 20\nagreed to participate. In total, the consumer advocates panel\nwith a mean age of 22 years, of whom 3 were male and 23\nwere female.\nDelphi Method\nThe Delphi method (Jones & Hunter, 1995) provided a sys-\ntematic basis to gauge expert consensus between the panel of\nyoung mental health consumer advocates and Youth MHFA\ninstructors on items for guideline inclusion. This involved\nmaking private, independent ratings of agreement with a\nseries of statements in a questionnaire.\nThe panelists' task was to rate the statements according to\nhow important they believed each item was for inclusion in\nguidelines on communicating effectively with an adolescent\nabout mental illness or other sensitive issues. Items were\nrated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 = essential,\n2 = important, 3 = do not know/depends, 4 = unimportant,\n5 = should not be included. Panelists were advised that some\nof the items may seem contradictory or controversial, but\nwere included because they reflected the wide range of peo-\nple's beliefs about communication.\nSurvey responses were analyzed by obtaining group per-\ncentages for consumer advocates and Youth MHFA instruc-\ntors for each item. The following cutoff points were used:\n4 SAGE Open\n1. Items rated as \"Essential\" or \"Important\" by at least\n90% of both panels were accepted for inclusion in the\nguidelines.\n2. Items rated as \"Essential\" or \"Important\" by at least\nboth panels, were re-rated in the subsequent round.\n3. All other items were rejected.\nFor each round of the study, panelists were sent an email\nwith a link to an online questionnaire uploaded to\nSurveyMonkey (www.surveymonkey.com), which could be\ncompleted at a time that was convenient to each panel mem-\nber. Those who partially completed the questionnaire could\nlog back in at another time to finish it. Reminder emails were\nsent to partial and noncompleters, and they were granted\nanother 2 weeks to complete it. Panelists were emailed a\nreport 2 weeks after each round of the study had closed. This\nwas to give participants enough time to read over the report\nand compare their personal rating (of items to be re-rated)\nwith those of other panelists, before a link to the next round\nwas sent.\nThe questionnaire contained 154 items, divided into six sec-\ntions. At the end of each section, panelists could make com-\nments on any ambiguity or wording of the items presented\nand could suggest additional items. A blank field was pro-\nvided for writing comments. It took approximately 45 min to\ncomplete the questionnaire. Consent was implied by respond-\ning to the survey.\nComments received from panel members in Round 1\nwere analyzed by JAF, who drafted new items from feed-\nback. The working group reviewed the comments and refined\nthe additional items. Only suggestions that represented a new\nidea, were considered unambiguous, and were actions were\naccepted as additional items. New items that were variations\nof items rejected in Round 1 were also not accepted. In total,\n21 were accepted for Round 2 of the questionnaire.\nThe report fed back to each panel member at the end of\nRound 1 listed items that had been accepted, rejected, and\nrequired re-rating. It contained a statistical summary of indi-\nvidual and group ratings for items that needed re-rating.\nPanelists were offered the chance to maintain or change their\nrating in Round 2, in view of the group's response.\nThe Round 2 questionnaire contained 59 items, comprising\nitems to be re-rated and any new items created from Round 1.\nIt took approximately 30 min to complete. The Round 2\nreport listed items that had been accepted, rejected, and\nrequired re-rating. Items that fell into the re-rate category at\nthe end of Round 2 (after already being re-rated at the end of\nRound 1) were excluded from the next round.\nThe Round 3 questionnaire contained nine items, which were\nre-rates of new items generated from comments by the panel-\nists during Round 1. It took approximately 10 min to com-\nplete. The report for Round 3 listed items that were endorsed\nor rejected.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the continuity of participation across the three\nrounds. There was a slightly higher percentage of males than\nfemales in the instructor expert panel (23%), compared with\nthe consumer expert panel (12%).\nFigure 1 shows the rates of inclusion, exclusion, and re-\nrating of the items in each round of the questionnaire. From\nEndorsed items were written into prose by JAF to create the\ndraft guidelines. These were emailed to the research-working\ngroup who refined them further, before being emailed to the\nexpert panelists with a request for comments or minor\nchanges. Along with the draft guidelines, panelists were sent\na full list of items that had been endorsed or rejected through-\nout all survey rounds. The final version of the guidelines\nappears in Appendix A.\nDiscussion\nOf the 80 items that were endorsed by both panels, there was\n100% agreement between them on 10 items, depicted by an\nasterisk in Appendix B. Themes were around treating the\nadolescent with respect, using good listening skills, helping\nthe adolescent find sources of help, and discouraging stigma-\ntizing attitudes.\nThere was a high level of agreement between panels about\nthe need for adults to be aware of differences in an adoles-\ncent's culture regarding the way in which they use and inter-\npret body language. Both panels also agreed that although\nTable 1.

MHFA = Mental Health First Aid.\nFischer et al. 5\nsome adolescents prefer confiding in adults of their own cul-\ntural background, it is best to ask adolescents individually if\nthey prefer this.\nDespite this consensus, there were some interesting dif-\nferences between panels. Items that were not rated as\n\"Essential\" or \"Important\" by at least 90% of both panels\nwere excluded from the guidelines, as perAppendix C. These\nitems may reflect broad differences of opinion between pan-\nelists on issues regarding judgment, discretion, and the ado-\nlescent as an individual. Consumers were more likely to\nendorse self-disclosure by adults, including sharing their\nexperience of a mental health problem with an adolescent. In\ncontrast, most instructors disagreed with this idea citing pro-\nfessional boundaries and organizational policies.\nAnother difference was around asking the adolescent\ndirectly about their risk of harm. All instructor panelists\nbelieved that it is best for the adult to ask directly. However,\nit was not endorsed highly enough by consumers in order to\nbe included in the guidelines. Other studies have reported\nthat many adults and young people are reluctant to ask\ndirectly about suicide (Jorm et al., 2005; Jorm, Morgan, &\nconcern that this might increase risk. This issue is addressed\nin the attached guidelines (Appendix A) by referring to\nSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors: First Aid Guidelines\n(2008a) and Deliberate Non-Suicidal Self-Injury: First Aid\nGuidelines (2008b), which emphasize the importance of ask-\ning an adolescent directly if they are feeling suicidal.\nLimitations\nBecause panelists who rated the items were all fromAustralia,\nit is not known if the guidelines are generalizable to other\ncountries or to cultural minorities. The study may contain a\nfemale gender bias given there were so few males in all\ngroups, that is, 20% of focus group clinicians, 29% of focus\ngroup consumers, 12% of expert panel consumers, and 23%\nof Youth MHFA instructors. The low response rate from cur-\nrently practicing Youth MHFA instructors (18%) may mean\nresponses are not representative of the wider instructor com-\nmunity. There were different sizes in group composition, for\nexample, the consumer expert panel was around 2.5 times\nsmaller than that of the Youth MHFA instructor panel.\nHowever, equal weighting was given to ratings by consumer\npanelists and instructor panelists to eliminate bias caused by\nunequal panel size. While a methodological weakness of the\nstudy is that focus groups were posed with slightly different\nquestions to generate feedback, the researchers considered it\nimportant to focus on \"what works\" for consumers to avoid\npotential distress from reflecting on what has not worked for\nthem.\nStrengths\nThe items endorsed for inclusion in the guidelines go beyond\nindividual opinion. By using the Delphi methodology, these\nguidelines have been informed by group consensus, which\nincludes consumers who have had experience with mental\nillness, as well as instructors who deliver the Youth MHFA\ncourse to adults. The high level of consensus for items (90%)\nbetween these diverse groups is another strength.\nA particular strength is the involvement of young con-\nsumers as experts. Future studies should encourage more\nconsumer input in research, particularly from males, to cap-\nture viewpoints from these important groups.\nThe guidelines are written with enough flexibility to be\napplied by adults who are acquainted with the adolescent, to\nthose who are not, and may also assist adults who do not\nhave much contact with adolescents. They encourage the use\nof language that is free of stigma and assist the adult to\nexplore the adolescent's issues sensitively. They complement\nthe existing suite of guidelines available from Mental Health\nFirst Aid Australia (www.mhfa.com.au) and will be incorpo-\nrated in updates to the Youth MHFA manual (Kelly et al.,\n2013) and curriculum for future courses.\nConclusion\nThis process has shown that it is possible to develop com-\nmunication guidelines that are acceptable to both profession-\nals and mental health consumers.

These guidelines are designed to\nprovide practical tips for adults in the general community,\nsuch as family members, teachers, sports coaches, chaplains,\nemployees, employers, or other service personnel, to com-\nmunicate effectively with adolescents about mental health\nproblems and other sensitive topics. Other sensitive topics\nmay include: substance misuse, same sex attraction, bullying\nand abuse, body dissatisfaction, relationship problems, phys-\nical development or illness.\nHow to use these guidelines.These guidelines are a general\nset of recommendations about how an adult can communi-\ncate with an adolescent. These communication tips are\ndesigned to be suitable for use in developed English-speak-\ning countries. They may not be suitable for other cultural\ngroups or for countries with different health systems.\nWhen using these guidelines, please do not apply them\nprescriptively. The guidelines tend to be general whereas\neach adolescent and their situation are unique. Consider the\nfollowing:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Each adolescent's needs are different and decisions\nshould be made according to what is believed to be in\nthe best interests of the adolescent.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Adapt your approach and style of the interaction\nappropriately, according to your role or type of rela-\ntionship that you have with the adolescent, for exam-\nple, as a parent, teacher, friend, coach, or employer.\nIn situations where the adult has an organizational respon-\nsibility, any relevant organizational policy needs to take pre-\ncedence to these communication guidelines.\nDevelopment of these guidelines.These guidelines are based\non the expert consensus of a panel of young mental health\nconsumer advocates from beyondblue and ReachOut\n(Inspire), and currently practicing Youth Mental Health First\nAid instructors within Australia.\nWhat is adolescence? Although there are a number of defini-\ntions of adolescence, here it is defined as those aged between\n12 and 18, or the years that a young person generally attends\nhigh school. However, adolescence can start earlier than 12\nyears and can continue through to the early 20s, so these\nguidelines could be relevant when helping people who are a\nlittle younger or older.\nWhat is a mental health problem? Mental health problem is\na broad term that includes developing mental illness, symp-\ntoms of a diagnosable illness, substance misuse, and adverse\nlife events that are having an impact on functioning.\nGuideline sections\n1. Planning your approach. Sometimes, an adolescent\nmay approach you about a sensitive topic, but at other\ntimes, you will need to take the initiative. When you\nare making the approach, plan to talk to the adoles-\ncent privately about your concerns at a time and place\nthat is convenient for both of you and free of distrac-\ntions. You could try asking where they feel most\ncomfortable or safe to talk. Be aware that the adoles-\ncent may not wish to open up to you until they feel\nthat you care enough, are trustworthy and willing to\nlisten. The adolescent may hide or downplay their\nproblem if they feel guilty about upsetting or disap-\npointing you. Some adolescents (especially boys)\nmay fear opening up about their problems in case\ntheir vulnerability is perceived as weakness.\nConsider whether you are the best person to\napproach the adolescent. For example, adolescents\nfrom a different cultural background may prefer con-\nfiding in adults from the same background. However,\ndo not assume that this is always the case--ask what\nthey would prefer.\n2. Engaging with the adolescent. To engage with the\nadolescent, be honest by \"being yourself,\" as adoles-\ncents can be particularly tuned in to anyone who is\n\"faking it.\" Try to set aside your own concerns and\nfocus on those of the adolescent, giving them your full\nattention. Remember that each adolescent's situation\nand needs are unique. You should be nonjudgmental\nand treat them with respect and fairness at all times.\nBe caring and show warmth toward the adolescent and try\nto be reliable and consistent in your behavior with them.\nTake the time to build rapport and trust--this could be done\nby expressing an interest in and curiosity about the adoles-\ncent. If the adolescent has disengaged from others, it is\nimportant that you allow additional time to build trust.\nConvey a message of hope to the adolescent by assuring\nthem that help is available and things can get better. However,\ndo not make any promises to the adolescent that cannot be\nkept.\nBe careful not to communicate a stigmatizing attitude\nabout the adolescent's sensitive issue and be careful in apply-\ning labels to the adolescent that they may find stigmatizing,\nfor example, \"mentally ill,\" \"drug addict,\" or \"gay.\" Be\nFischer et al. 7\naware that the adolescent may hold a stigmatizing attitude\ntoward their own sensitive issue. Choose your words care-\nfully so as to not offend the adolescent.\n3. What to say and how. Tell the adolescent that you\nwant to help. Talk \"with,\" not \"at,\" the adolescent.\nDo not do all of the talking. As far as possible, it is\npreferable to let the adolescent set the pace and style\nof the interaction. After speaking, be patient and\nallow plenty of time for the adolescent to collect their\nthoughts, reflect on their feelings, and decide what to\nsay next. Although you should encourage the adoles-\ncent to lead the conversation, do not be afraid to ask\nopen, honest questions during the course of discus-\nsion. Ask the adolescent about their experiences and\nhow they feel about them, rather than make your own\ninterpretation.\nDo not only think about what you are saying but\nalso how you are saying it. For example, consider the\nvolume and the tone of your voice--this includes the\nvocal pitch and the attitudes that are conveyed. Stay\ncalm, use a calm voice and steady tone, and never\nraise your voice if you can help it.\nIf the adolescent does not wish to discuss the problem with\nyou, reassure them that they do not have to talk about or\nreveal anything until they are ready to do so. Let the adoles-\ncent know that when they want to talk, you will listen to them.\nIf the adolescent appears distressed by what they are\nexperiencing, explain to them that help is available. If the\nadolescent is in a potentially harmful situation (e.g., experi-\nencing abuse or bullying), let them know that you want to\nkeep them safe. You should also explain the limits of confi-\ndentiality. For example, anything that affects the safety of the\nadolescent or others (such as abuse or suicidal thoughts or\nbehavior) may need to be discussed with someone who can\nact to keep the adolescent (or others) safe. For more informa-\ntion, please see the other guidelines in this series: Suicidal\nThoughts and Behaviors; First Aid Guidelines and Traumatic\nEvents: First Aid Guidelines for Assisting Children.\nThere may be times when you are having a private discus-\nsion with the adolescent and other people arrive. In these\nsituations, you should take a moment to ask the adolescent in\nprivate, what they would like to do (e.g., continue the discus-\nsion in front of others, ask others to leave, or schedule\nanother time to continue your discussion).\nWhen communicating with an adolescent, there are a\nnumber of things that are best avoided. These include trivial-\nizing the adolescent's feelings by using statements such as,\n\"When you're older . . .\" or \"Back in my day . . .\" as this may\nappear dismissive of the adolescent and their experiences.\nSimilarly, phrases such as \"snap out of it\" or \"stop thinking\nthat way\" should be avoided. When talking with the adoles-\ncent, scare tactics or threats should not be used, for example,\n\"If you keep thinking like this, you'll end up in big trouble.\"\nAlso, avoid sounding condescending or patronizing, and\navoid stereotyping adolescents. For example, \"Why are peo-\nple your age always difficult and argumentative?\" Be careful\nnot to disagree or minimize the adolescent's thoughts and\nfeelings as this may appear dismissive of their experience,\nfor example, \"You're not depressed. You're just bored.\"\nFinally, if you find that you have said something in error,\nbe up front and address the error as soon as you can.\n4. Body language. Be aware of the adolescent's body\nlanguage, as this can provide clues as to how they are\nfeeling or how comfortable they feel about talking\nwith you. Try to notice how much personal space the\nadolescent feels comfortable with and do not intrude\nbeyond that.\nBe aware of your own body language and what\nthis conveys when communicating with the adoles-\ncent (e.g., posture, facial expressions, and gestures).\nUse cues such as nodding to keep a conversation\ngoing with the adolescent. Be aware that different\ncultures use and interpret body language in different\nways, for example, the amount of eye contact or per-\nsonal space may vary.\nAvoid negative body language such as crossing your\narms, hands on hips or looking uninterested. Also, avoid dis-\ntracting gestures such as fidgeting with a pen, glancing at\nother things, or tapping your feet or fingers, as these could be\ninterpreted as a lack of interest.\n5. Discussing options. Before discussing possible\ncourses of action, you need to listen attentively and\nsensitively to the adolescent and give them a chance\nto fully express and explore their issue. This is so you\ncan avoid offering ill-considered or inappropriate\nadvice, or minimizing or dismissing the problem,\nbased on only \"half the picture.\"\nWhen giving advice, try not to judge a situation on\nwhat you would do yourself but have a discussion\nwith the adolescent about what they think would be\nCommunication is a two-way process--how well you listen is just\nas important as how well the adolescent is expressing themselves.\nThe following listening skills can help:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Listen to the adolescent without interruption, and allow\nthem to talk about their experiences and beliefs if they\nwant to.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Make a conscious effort to listen, to hear the feelings and\nmeaning behind the adolescent's words and respond to\nthis. For example, when the adolescent says, \"Why can't I\nuse the car? Others are allowed!\" It could mean, \"I feel like\nyou don't trust me. I want you to treat me as a responsible\nperson.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Actively listen and use questions to check your\nunderstanding and acknowledge that you have heard what\nthe adolescent has said.\n8 SAGE Open\nhelpful. Discuss with and help the adolescent to\nassess different courses of action and to understand\nthe consequences of each.\nSometimes outside help is needed. Recommend that\nthe adolescent contact the relevant professional (e.g.,\nteacher, doctor, or counselor) as early as possible to talk\nabout what they have been experiencing. If the adolescent\nresists seeing someone about their problem, give them\nhelpline phone numbers or websites that offer assistance\nto adolescents, as these are anonymous and may be less\nconfronting.\n6. Handling difficulties in the conversation. Be aware\nof any barriers to the adolescent's communication,\nfor example, language difficulties, finding the right\nwords or an inability to express emotion. Some ado-\nlescents do not communicate well verbally, and it is\nimportant to adapt to their needs and abilities.\nIf the adolescent does not feel comfortable talking\nto you, encourage them to discuss how they are feel-\ning with someone else and help them find a suitable\nperson to talk to. If the adolescent asks you for help\nbut you do not know much about the problem, you\nshould still try to support the adolescent and assist\nthem to get other help.\nIf the adolescent's initial reaction to you is negative, you\nshould not presume that they do not want your help. Be\naware that sometimes adolescents struggle to ask for assis-\ntance, or reject help when offered, even if they feel that a\nsituation is out of control. Try not to put pressure on the ado-\nlescent to open up to you, if they do not wish to talk right\naway. Let the adolescent know that you are available for\nthem to talk to you, when they are ready.\nIf the adolescent appears to have stopped listening to you,\ntry to change the way you say or do things. If the adolescent\nmakes negative comments or does not want to talk about their\nproblem, you should not take it personally. If the adolescent is\nbeing antagonistic or argumentative, you should not respond\nin a hostile, disciplinary, or challenging manner.\nIf you are left feeling bewildered or distressed following\na discussion with the adolescent, confide your feelings to a\ntrusted friend or health professional while maintaining the\nadolescent's privacy.\nAlthough these guidelines are copyright, they can be\nfreely reproduced for nonprofit purposes provided the source\nis acknowledged.\nPlease cite these guidelines as follows:\nMental Health First Aid Training and Research Program\n(2013).

Guidelines.\nRound\nPlanning your approach\n The adult should ask the adolescent where they feel more comfortable or safe to talk. 1\n The adult should make sure that they approach the adolescent privately about their experiences at a time and place that is\nconvenient and free of distractions.\n The adult should be aware that the adolescent may feel more able to discuss their problems when no one else is listening. 1\n The adult should be aware that the adolescent may not wish to open up until they feel that the adult cares enough, is\ntrustworthy, and is willing to listen.\n The adult should be aware that some adolescents (especially boys) may fear opening up about their problems in case their\nvulnerability is labeled as weak.\n The adult should be aware that the adolescent may hide or play down their problem if they feel guilty about upsetting or\ndisappointing the adult.\n Although some adolescents prefer confiding in adults of their own cultural background, do not assume that this is always the\ncase--ask if they would prefer this.\nEngaging with the adolescent\n The adult should let the adolescent know that they are available to talk when the adolescent is ready and should not put\npressure on the adolescent to talk right away.\n The adult should set aside their own issues when communicating with the adolescent and try to focus on the adolescent's\nown concerns.\n The adult should give an adolescent their full attention. 1\n The adult should be honest when interacting with the adolescent. 1\n The adult should take the time to build rapport and trust with the adolescent. 1\n aThe adult should treat the adolescent with respect and fairness. 1\n The adult should express interest in and curiosity about the adolescent. 1\nFischer et al. 9\nAppendix B (continued)\n(continued)\nRound\n aThe adult should be genuine by \"being themselves.\" Adolescents are particularly tuned in to anyone who is \"faking it.\" 1\n aThe adult needs to recognize that each adolescent's situation and needs are unique. 1\n If the adolescent has disengaged from others, it is important for the adult to allow additional time to build trust with the\nadolescent.\n The adult should be nonjudgmental when speaking with the adolescent. 1\n The adult should convey a message of hope to the adolescent by assuring them that help is available and things can get better. 1\n The adult should be caring and show warmth toward the adolescent. 1\n The adult should be reliable and consistent in their behavior with the adolescent. 1\n The adult should not make any promises to the adolescent that cannot be kept. 1\n aThe adult should be aware that the adolescent may hold a stigmatizing attitude toward their sensitive issue. 2\n The adult should be careful not to communicate a stigmatizing attitude about the adolescent's sensitive issue. 1\n The adult should be careful in applying labels to the adolescent that the adolescent may find stigmatizing, for example,\nmentally ill, drug addict, and gay.\nWhat to say and how\n aThe adult should be a good listener. 1\n The adult should not do all the talking. 1\n As far as possible, the adult should let the adolescent set the pace and style of the interaction. 1\n The adult should use a calm voice and steady tone when speaking with the adolescent. 1\n The adult should stay calm when talking with the adolescent. 1\n The adult should never raise their voice if they can help it. 1\n The adult should ask the adolescent to explain their experience rather than make their own interpretation. 1\n The adult should ask the adolescent about their experiences and how they feel about them. 1\n After speaking, the adult should be patient and allow plenty of time for the adolescent to collect their thoughts, reflect on\ntheir feelings, and decide what to say next.\n The adult should actively listen and use questions to check their understanding and acknowledge that they have heard what\nthe adolescent has said.\n The adult should talk \"with,\" not \"at,\" the adolescent. 1\n The adult should avoid trivializing the adolescent's feelings by using statements such as, \"When you're older . . .\" or \"Back in\nmy day . . .\" as this may appear dismissive of the adolescent's perspective of their own experience.\n The adult should not use scare tactics or threats when talking to the adolescent, for example, \"If you keep thinking like this,\nyou'll end up in big trouble.\"\n The adult should avoid telling the adolescent to \"snap out of it\" or \"stop thinking that way.\" 1\n If the adolescent is in a potentially harmful situation (e.g., experiencing abuse or bullying), the adult should reassure the\nadolescent that they want to keep them safe.\n The adult should explain the limits of confidentiality, for example, anything that affects the safety of the adolescent or others\n(such as abuse or suicidal thoughts or behavior) may need to be discussed with someone who can act to keep them safe.\n If the adult is having a private discussion with the adolescent and other people arrive, the adult should take a moment to ask\nthe adolescent in private what they would like to do (e.g., continue the discussion in front of others, ask others to leave, or\nschedule another time to continue your discussion).\n The adult should tell the adolescent that they want to help. 2\n The adult should listen to the adolescent without interrupting them. 2\n The adult should make a conscious effort to listen, to hear the feelings and meaning behind the adolescent's words, and\nrespond to this. For example, when the adolescent says, \"Can't use the car? Others are allowed!\" It could mean, \"I feel like\nyou don't trust me. I want you to treat me as a responsible person.\"\n The adult should reassure the adolescent that they are not required to talk about or reveal anything until they are ready to\ndo so.\n aThe adult should tell the adolescent that when they want to talk, the adult will listen to them. 2\n aThe adult should allow the adolescent to talk about their experiences and beliefs if they want to. 2\n If the adolescent appears distressed by what they are experiencing, the adult should reassure the adolescent that help is\navailable.\n The adult should avoid sounding condescending or patronizing. 1\n The adult should avoid stereotyping adolescents, for example, \" . . . adolescents always like to be difficult and oppose adults.\" 1\nAppendix B (continued)\nRound\n aIf the adult finds that they have said something in error to the adolescent, they should be up front and address the error as\nsoon as they can.\n Although the adult should encourage the adolescent to lead the conversation, the adult should not be afraid to ask open,\nhonest questions during the course of discussion.\nBody language\n The adult should be aware of the adolescent's body language as this can provide clues to how they are feeling or how\ncomfortable they feel talking with the adult.\n The adult should avoid negative body language such as crossing their arms, hands on hips, or looking uninterested. 1\n The adult should avoid distracting gestures such as fidgeting with a pen, glancing at other things, or tapping their feet or\nfingers, as these could be interpreted as lack of interest.\n The adult should be aware of their own body language and what this conveys when communicating with the adolescent (e.g.,\nposture, facial expressions, and gestures).\n The adult should use cues like nodding to keep a conversation going with the adolescent. 1\n The adult should not only think about what they are saying but also how they are saying it (e.g., tone, volume of voice, and\nbody language).\n The adult should notice how much personal space the adolescent feels comfortable with and not intrude beyond that. 1\n The adult should be careful not to disagree or minimize the adolescent's thoughts and feelings. \" . . . you're not depressed.\nYou're just bored.\"\n The adult should be aware that different cultures use and interpret body language in different ways. 1\nDiscussing options\n The adult needs to listen attentively and sensitively to the adolescent's issue in full, before they suggest possible courses of\naction so as to avoid offering ill-considered or inappropriate advice based on only \"`half the picture.\"\n The adult should ensure that the adolescent has had a chance to fully express and explore their issue, before offering possible\ncourses of action, so as not to appear to be minimizing or dismissing the problem.\n The adult should try not to judge a situation on what they would do themselves but have a discussion with the adolescent\nabout what could be done.\n The adult should discuss with and help the adolescent to assess different courses of action and to understand the\nconsequences of each.\n If the adolescent resists seeing someone about their problem, offer phone numbers to Lifeline or Kids Help Line or websites,\nas these are anonymous and may be less confronting.\n The adult should recommend that the adolescent talk to the relevant professional (e.g., teacher, doctor, or counselor) as\nearly as possible, to talk about what they have been experiencing.\nHandling difficulties\n The adult should be aware that some adolescents do not communicate well verbally, and it is important to adapt to their\nneeds and abilities.\n If the adolescent does not want to talk about their problems, the adult should not take it personally. 1\n If the adolescent makes negative comments, the adult should not take these personally. 1\n If the adolescent is being antagonistic or argumentative, the adult should not respond in a hostile, disciplinary, or challenging\nmanner.\n If the adult is left feeling bewildered or distressed following a discussion with the adolescent, they should confide their\nfeelings to a trusted friend or health professional while maintaining the adolescent's privacy.\n If the adolescent does not feel comfortable talking to the adult, they should encourage the adolescent to discuss how they\nare feeling with

for which there was 100% agreement between panels.\nAppendix C\n(continued)\nItems Excluded From the Communication Guidelines.\nRound\nPlanning your approach\n The adult should be aware that the adolescent is more likely to engage with them in a place that is within the adolescent's\ncomfort zone (e.g., in a caf\u00e9 or at home).\n When approaching the adolescent, it may be helpful for adults to be aware of the adolescent's cultural background, local\ncultural norms, and hierarchy within their culture.\n The adult should be aware that the adolescent may find it easier to talk during a time-limited activity that has a definite end\npoint.\n The adult should be aware that it may be easier for the adolescent to talk during activities that do not require a lot of eye\ncontact.\n The adult should be aware that the adolescent may feel more comfortable talking to people of similar age about their\nproblems or experiences.\n The adult should be aware that adolescents from diverse backgrounds may be more comfortable talking to an adult from\ntheir own culture.\n The adult should be aware that the adolescent may feel more at ease about opening up to others who also have the same\nsensitive issue.\n The adult should use a mutual activity as an opportunity to talk with the adolescent about a sensitive issue, for example,\ngoing shopping, going for a drive, or going for a walk.\nEngaging with the adolescent\n The adult should use a friendly attitude when speaking with the adolescent (rather than treat the adolescent as they would\nan adult friend or peer).\n The adult should treat the adolescent as responsible and capable of making decisions. 2\n The adult should talk openly with the adolescent about the sensitive issue. 2\n The adult should talk openly with the adolescent about the sensitive issue, taking into consideration the adolescent's age. 2\n The adult should talk openly with the adolescent about the sensitive issue, taking into consideration the adolescent's\nmaturity.\n As a basis for discussion, it is sometimes useful for the adult to talk about how the adolescent's sensitive issue is portrayed in\nthe media (e.g., Does the media glamorize or spread myths about the particular issue?)\n aThe adult should not avoid speaking with or offering help to the adolescent out of fear that the adult may say or do the\nwrong thing.\n aThe adult should not use slang with which they are unfamiliar, as the adolescent will recognize that the adult is not being\ngenuine.\n aThe adult should try to empathize with how the adolescent feels about their beliefs and experiences. 2\n aThe adult should offer the adolescent consistent emotional support and understanding. 2\n aThe adult should acknowledge the adolescent's expertise about their own life. 2\n aThe adult should praise the adolescent when they've acted in a responsible way. 2\n aThe adult should be mindful of their own gender and that of the adolescent, and how this may relate to the adolescent's\ncurrent experience or previous trauma (e.g., an adolescent female who confides in a male adult about sexual abuse).\n aThe adult should ask the adolescent about the impact of their culture or background, rather than assume what this might be. 2\n aThe adult should be aware that the adolescent may hold a stigmatizing attitude toward their sensitive issue. 2\n aThe adult should talk openly with the adolescent about the sensitive issue. 2\n aThe adult should show a confident manner when interacting with the adolescent. 3\n The adult should not compare the adolescent's life to their own experiences at that age. 1\n The adult should offer their first name to create a less formal atmosphere--using titles such as doctor or mister creates a\nhierarchy, which the adolescent may perceive as wanting power over them.\n The adult should take the time to engage with the adolescent first (e.g., getting them to talk about their interests and social\nlife) before discussing personal issues about any problems that the adolescent may be experiencing.\n If the adult does not know about things the adolescent is interested in, they should ask and find out from them. 1\n The adult should be aware that a laid-back or less formal dress sense helps to engage adolescents. 1\n If the adolescent cannot or does not want to talk about what they are experiencing, the adult should respect this and not\npry.\n The adult should talk to the adolescent as they would to a friend. 1\n The adult should lift the adolescent's spirits and help them feel more positive about themselves. 1\n The adult should avoid confronting the young person and should not criticize or blame them. 1\nAppendix C (continued)\n(continued)\nRound\n The adult should express positive attitudes about the adolescent's culture. 1\n The adult should familiarize himself or herself with technologies adolescents use as this may be a way of engaging adolescents\nmore personally and in a way they understand, for example, with social networking tools such as Facebook, Twitter, and\nYouTube.\n The adult should avoid using ideas about the sensitive issue from television, movies, and the media when speaking with the\nadolescent, as these are often both frightening and inaccurate.\nWhat to say and how\n If the adult often uses long silent pauses, they should explain that they are just thinking about the adolescent's options and\ntalk to them through this, as the adolescent may otherwise misinterpret this negatively.\n The adult should offer positive feedback to the adolescent as this may encourage them to communicate with the adult, for\nexample, \"I think it's great that you are willing to talk to me about this--it shows a great deal of maturity.\"\n If the adult has personal experiences of the sensitive issue, they should gauge whether or not it may be helpful to share these\nwith the adolescent on an individual basis.\n If the adult chooses to share their own personal experience of a similar sensitive issue as the adolescent, they should ask the\nadolescent whether they want to hear it before going ahead.\n aWhen sharing a personal experience of the same sensitive issue (e.g., depression), and there have been difficulties in the\nadult's recovery, the adult should be careful not to convey a bleak attitude toward recovery to the adolescent.\n aThe adult should use open-ended questions in order to get the adolescent's input into a conversation. Open-ended\nquestions are questions that cannot be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no,\" for example, \"How are you feeling about\nwhat happened?\" instead of \"Are you feeling OK about what happened?\"\n aThe adult should take as much time as the adolescent needs to talk. 2\n aIf the adult has commenced talking with the adolescent about their issues but finds that they are running out of time, the\nadult should reschedule another time to talk with the adolescent.\n aIf the adult is from a different cultural background to the adolescent, they may need to make some adjustments to their\nusual style of communication, for example, the adolescent may be used to using physical terms (such as headache or\nstomach ache) to describe their emotional experiences, be used to a different level of eye contact or personal space, or it\nmay not be appropriate in the adolescent's culture to speak alone with an adult of the opposite sex.\n aThe adult should offer alternative actions that could help with the problem and allow for compromise to give the adolescent\na sense of control.\n aIf a parent or guardian is present during a discussion with the adolescent, the adult should ensure that both the adolescent\nand the parent/guardian have a chance to talk and ask questions.\n aIf the adult is concerned about the adolescent's safety or risk of harm, they should ask them directly about this. 3\n If the adult has approached the adolescent, they should be straightforward and explain their concerns. 1\n The adult should listen more than they talk to the adolescent. 1\n The adult should not overuse the adolescent's first name, as this may appear patronizing or over-familiar. 1\n The adult should use \"I messages\" to communicate their thoughts and feelings to the adolescent. \"I messages\" are statements\nthat tell the adolescent how the adult feels about their behavior and gives the adolescent an understanding of the effects of\ntheir behavior without blaming the adolescent, for example, \"I feel very upset when you . . .\"\n The adult should use metaphor where appropriate. 1\n The adult should use humor where appropriate. 1\n The adult should not ask the adolescent to justify or explain their behavior as asking \"why\" can put the adolescent on the\ndefensive.\n The adult should pay attention to any topic the adolescent is finding distressing and avoid asking more about it. 1\n The adult should avoid steering the conversation toward the answer they think will \"solve\" the adolescent's problems. 1\n The adult should avoid telling the adolescent what they should do to solve their problems. 1\n If a parent or guardian is present during a discussion with the adolescent and the adult needs to ask the parent or guardian a\nquestion, they should then turn to the adolescent and ask the same question.\n The adult should state that the topic may be sensitive, for example, \"I want to talk to you about something, and it might be a\nsensitive topic . . .\"\n If the adult has personal experiences of the sensitive issue, they SHOULD share these with the adolescent, to normalize the\nexperience for them.\n If the adult has personal experiences of the sensitive issue, they should NOT share these with the adolescent. 1\n The adult should ENCOURAGE the adolescent to talk to them about their experiences and beliefs. 1\nAppendix C (continued)\nRound\nBody language\n The adult should not make any comments about the adolescent's body language, for example, avoiding eye contact or\nfidgeting.\n If the adult feels startled or disturbed by what the adolescent says, the adult should remain neutral (e.g., phrasing, vocal tone,\nand body language).\n aIf the adolescent appears defensive, the adult should make their body language as open as possible by appearing relaxed,\nkeeping their palms out, sitting alongside the adolescent but angled toward them and keeping their voice calm and low.\n aThe adult should maintain a comfortable level of eye contact when speaking with the adolescent. 2\n aThe adult and the adolescent should be positioned at the same level so that they do not have to look up or down at each\nother.\n aThe adult should be respectful of personal boundaries between themselves and the adolescent, but not to the point of being\nafraid to show comfort, if the adolescent asks for it (e.g., a brief hug or pat on the shoulder).\n If the adolescent is relaxed and open, the adult should match their body language. 1\n The adult should sit in a relaxed position. 1\n The adult should sit face-to-face with the adolescent. 1\n The adult should sit side by side with the adolescent. 1\n When seated, the adult should lean forward to show interest when speaking with the adolescent. 1\n When talking with the adolescent, the adult should not sit behind a desk. 1\n The adult should maintain an appropriate distance with the adolescent in order to model clear personal boundaries. 1\n If the adolescent is distressed, the adult should convey a sense of comfort by offering a brief hug or simple touch. 1\n The adult should know the difference between \"good\" touching and \"bad\" touching when comforting the adolescent. Safe\ntouching is extremely healthy, and it is important for adolescents to have models of this.\nDiscussing options\n aThe adult should help the adolescent find solutions without trying to fix the problem for them. 2\n The adult should ask permission to give opinions or offer advice so that it is not seen as criticism or taken defensively. 1\nHandling difficulties in the conversation\n If the adolescent feels more comfortable talking to people with similar experiences or people their own age, the adult should\nrecommend that the adolescent joins a support group.\n If the adolescent asks the adult for help and the adult does not know much about the problem, the adult should learn more\nabout that type of problem.\n aIf the adolescent is infringing the adult's personal space, the adult should talk to them directly about it. 2\n aIf the adolescent is expressing excessive anger or behaving aggressively, the adult should clearly state that they cannot\ncommunicate with the adolescent if they are shouting or acting in a threatening way.\n aIf the adolescent is expressing anger, the adult should offer empathy and try to find out why they are feeling angry. 2\n If the adolescent appears distressed by what they are experiencing, the adult should normalize it by saying it is common for\nadolescents to feel this way.\n If the adolescent is finding it difficult to express their emotions, the adult should offer a few terms to pick from to help them\nfind the language they are looking for. For example, \"To me, you don't look very happy. Are you feeling sad, or angry, or\nfrustrated?\"\n If the adolescent is distressed, the adult should convey a sense of comfort by using a few appropriate words, e.g. \"It's OK.\nI'm here.\"\n If the adult feels uncomfortable during their discussion with the adolescent, they should admit it. 1\n If the adult feels uncomfortable during their discussion with the adolescent, they should ask the adolescent if they are\nuncomfortable also.\n If the adult is having trouble interpreting the adolescent's behavior, they should ask them directly to explain what they are\ndoing.\n If the adult is having trouble engaging or communicating with the adolescent, they should ask whether they would like some\nhelp to find someone else to talk to, for example, a person of a different age or gender.\n If the adult feels uncomfortable with what the adolescent is saying, they should suggest that the adolescent find someone else\nto speak to and ask if they would like any assistance with this.\n If the adolescent appears agitated, the adult should offer to take them outside for a walk while talking with them. 1\naDepicts items excluded on basis of falling into the \"re-rate\" category after two Rounds.\n"
