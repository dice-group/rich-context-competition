The \"editorials\" represent the voice of a daily on an issue, imply stance of the authority, and influence public\nopinion. The Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) of 1974 between Bangladesh and India is an issue of interests for the people\nof both the countries as well as the global policy makers. The newspapers of both the countries have shown their concerns\nthrough analyses, comments, and observations on the same. The present study aims at understanding the stance of the\nnewspapers of both the countries with regard to the much-talked about LBA issue by analyzing contents and discourse of\nthe relevant editorials of six leading dailies of both the countries. It reveals that the dailies have expressed their concerns for\npeaceful implementation of the LBA as well as stressed on maintaining bilateral relationship and economic progress between\nBangladesh and India. Simultaneously, tone of the editorials was critical of the role of the governments and the policy makers\nof both the countries besides criticizing both the domestic and international political dynamics.\n",

The audiences are not only satisfied with what they get\ninstantly from the media, but they also want to know detailed\naspects of public issues or affairs. Perhaps more than ever\nbefore, media and communication are the center of our every-\nday lives. Sometimes on our own and sometimes in the com-\npany of others, media entertain us, enable connections with\nfriends and communities, provide interpretations of the world\naround us, and offer resources for the forging of identities and\nimaginations (Hodkinson, 2011). In the contemporary world,\nrole of media is not only limited to serve the individual but\nalso a given society in both the national and international\narena with interpretation, observations, and suggestions on\ndifferent issues and affairs. Media influence our choices, per-\nceptions, and decisions about viewing a matter or an affair\nrelated to personal, group, and public interests.\nIt is needless to say that the political leaders and the gov-\nernments throughout the world rely on the media for making\ndecisions on the issues of greater public interest. Media facil-\nitate molding public opinion on significant issues by present-\ning information and analysis. Media content, particularly the\neditorial articles of the newspapers, play a vital role in form-\ning national as well as regional harmony. Editorials of the\nnewspapers represent the view of the newspapers themselves\non a given issue. The newspapers demonstrate their stance on\nthe issues of public interest through arguments, interpreta-\ntion, and suggestions. Thus, the policy makers are facilitated\nto formulate policies reflecting public perception, choices,\nand demands.\nOn June 6, 2015, Prime Ministers of Bangladesh and\nIndia drew a final shape toward implementation of the long-\nstanding Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) for resolving 68\nyear's border disputes between the countries. Prior to\nexchanging the final documents regarding the issue, India\nratified LBAin the Parliament during early May 2015.

Implementation of\nLBA has created hope among the enclave dwellers of a better\nlife being citizens of an independent country--Bangladesh\nor India. These people are now expecting of enjoying their\nidentity through citizenship and availing fundamental rights.\nExperts consider this historic initiative as a milestone in\ndeveloping bilateral cooperation and ensuring regional secu-\nrity. The newspapers of both Bangladesh and India have cov-\nered the ratification and implementation procedure of LBA\nsignificantly. The present study aims at figuring out the\ndynamics of editorial coverage of the leading dailies pub-\nlished from Bangladesh and India.\nThe LBA: An Overview\nAfter partition of India in 1947, the Radcliffe Line became the\nborder between India and East Pakistan, and following the lib-\neration of Bangladesh in 1971, the same line became the bor-\nder between the two countries. Although the demarcation of\nthe border between India and the then Pakistan had started\nsoon after the partition, it was not successfully carried out due\nto slower progress in determining the passages of the border\naccurately. Later, Nehru\u00adNoon Agreement of 1958 raised\nsome hope of demarking the border, but it was stopped by sub-\nsequent hostilities and mistrusts between India and Pakistan.\nThe problem continued even after creation of independent\nBangladesh. Bangladesh and India were able to conclude the\nLBA in 1974 with a view of resolving the complex border\ndemarcation. The agreement being not ratified by India for\ndecades has allowed to partial implementation of the same, for\nexample, both the countries share an approximately 4,096.7\nkm long land boundary. Relating to Dahagram andAngarporta\nvides for access to these enclaves by leasing in perpetuity an\nthrough Letters of Exchange on October 7, 1982, between the\nthen Foreign Minister of India and the then Foreign Minister\nSecretary of India and the Additional Foreign Secretary of\nBangladesh. Three major issues concerning (a) undemarcated\nland boundary of approximately 6.1 km in three sectors,\nnamely, Daikhata-56 (West Bengal), Muhuri river--Belonia\n(Tripura), and Lathitila--Dumabari (Assam); (b) exchange of\nenclaves; and (c) adverse possessions were unsettled (Ministry\nof External Affairs, Government of India, n.d.).\nDuring the visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of\nBangladesh to India in January 2010, India and Bangladesh\nexpressed the desire to reach a final resolution to the long-\nstanding issue and agreed to address all outstanding bound-\nary issues in accordance with the LBAof 1974. Subsequently,\ndetailed negotiations, joint visits to the concerned areas, and\nland surveys were conducted, resulting in the Protocol con-\nthe situation on the ground and wishes of the people residing\nin the areas involved were taken into account and the written\nconsent of the concerned State Governments of India was\nobtained (Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India,\nn.d.).\nAgain, the protocol has not been implemented due to\nchanging political scenario of the countries. Finally, as a\nresult of successful diplomatic initiatives, the Parliament of\nIndia ratified the LBA through amending the constitution in\nMay 2015. Documents related to LBAratification and imple-\nmentation were exchanged between the countries during the\nvisit of Indian Premier to Dhaka in June 2015. Following the\nexchange of documents, both the countries agreed on prin-\nciple to exchange the enclaves from July 31, 2015. To facili-\ntate exchange of the enclaves, representatives of both the\ncountries have surveyed the dwellers to determine their\nchoice of citizenship.\nDue to pending LBA issues for decades, the enclave\ndwellers had to undergo countless miseries. They were not\nentitled to receive public services of any country without\ncitizenship. They had no educational institutions, hospitals,\npower supply, and other necessary social infrastructures to\naddress their fundamental needs. Nongovernmental organi-\nzations (NGOs) were barred from working in the enclaves\nfor improving life and livelihood status of the poor dwellers.\nIt is easily guessed by the lifestyles and mysteries associated\nwith the enclave inhabitants from a report of The Economist\nA few years ago, away from Cooch Behar, on the eastern border\nwith India, I met a man who lived smack on the border between\nTripura state and Bangladesh. His living room was in Bangladesh,\nhis toilet in India. He had been a local politician in India, and was\nnow working as a farmer in Bangladesh. As is typical in such\nplaces, he sent his daughters to school in Bangladesh, and his\nsons to India, where schools, he thought, were much better. To\nhis mind, the fence dividing the two countries was of little value.\nBut, he conceded, \"at least my cows don't run away anymore.\"\nRoadmap to Implementation of LBA\nIssue\nBangladesh\u00adIndia relationship roots in the liberation war of\nBangladesh. India's contribution to the emergence of\nBangladesh as an independent nation has become one of the\nmajor indicators of developing, restoring, and advancing the\nmutual relationship between the countries. Historical under-\nstanding between Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Indira Gandhi\nhad led to reach an agreement of settling the unsettled land\nboundary between four states of India and Bangladesh in\nBangladesh ratified the agreement in 1974 while India\nheld back the process with an excuse of constitutional\namendment to implement the same. Despite frequent assur-\nances by Delhi, the process of implementation of the\nHasan and Islam 3\nagreement was deterred by court cases against the LBA,\nopposition from state governments and power politics in\nDelhi. Delhi, it appears, was never serious to resolve the dis-\npute. The so-called \"illegal immigration,\" \"security,\" and\n\"economic\" issues seem to have motivated Delhi to conclude\nIn January 2010, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina visited\nIndia when the Congress-led the United Progressive Alliance\n(UPA) made a promise to resolve at least two outstanding\nissues--the LBA and the Teesta Water-Sharing Treaty. Later,\nIndian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited Dhaka in\nSeptember 2011 when the Protocol related to the LBA was\nsigned, but the UPA had no strength enough in the Lok Sabha\nto make the bill regarding this passed. The Bharatiya Janata\nParty (BJP), then in opposition, stiffly opposed the move\nwhich aired of the initiative taken by both the Prime\nMinisters. In 2014, BJP-led the National DemocraticAlliance\ncame to the power with two thirds majority and Narendra\nModi took the charge of the premier of the country. Majority\ndid not add strength for the Modi government for passing the\nLBA Bill in the Parliament in the face of opposite stand by\nthe BJP leaders in Assam, one of the four states involved\nwith the Agreement. At that point, Delhi thought of passing\nthe bill excluding Assam. The Congress-led Assam govern-\nment, however, strongly opposed BJP's move to exclude the\nstate from the process of settlement. Congress, the main\nopposition party in the Lok Sabha, also put its foot down and\nwarned that it would oppose Assam's exclusion. After bick-\nering for weeks, a compromise was achieved between the\nBJP and Congress, and finally the Bill went through unop-\nposed in both the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha.\nWhat Is Editorial Coverage?\nIn the print media, specifically in the daily newspapers, an\neditorial coverage is a write-up which depicts views and\nstances of a newspaper on particular contemporary issues\nthat usually include socioeconomic, cultural, political, envi-\nronmental, and other subjects having significance to a larger\nsection of the people. In a newspaper, an editorial is gener-\nally written by the editor or assistant editors or the persons\nassigned to do the same on behalf of the editor. The editorial\nwriter selects a current issue having public interests, conse-\nquence, and significance; gathers relevant information on the\nsame; finds correlation among different facts; and synthe-\nsizes, interprets, and analyzes different aspects. The main\npurpose of an editorial is to raise public voice for finding out\nsolution to a particular social problem.According to F. Fraser\nBond, newspaper reserves only one page and sometimes\nonly one column to voice its own ideas, its own thoughts, and\nits own opinions. Bond (1955) wrote, \"Ideally the function of\nthe editorial is to inform and lead public opinion. It interprets\nthe current news to the readers and points out its significance\n(p. 194).\" Editorials give opinions on important social, polit-\nical, economic, or legal issues of the day and intend to\npersuade readers to agree to a particular point of view\n(Sarker, 2012). In editorial, policy of a newspaper is reflected\n(Khandoker, 2014). Editorial means drawing a decision on\nan important issue within a limited, narrowed, and specific\nObjectives of the Study\nThe overall objective of the study is to comprehend dynam-\nics of editorial stances of the selected dailies regarding the\nissue of LBA while the specific objectives include to\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 comprehend the hidden meaning of the editorial\nwrite-ups;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 figure out tone of the dailies, that is, whether the tone\nwas favoring or disfavoring LBA implementation;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 comprehend depth of analysis of the issues;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 explore relationship between editorial coverage and\nperceived political affiliation or ideologies of the dai-\nlies; and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 understand the role of the editorial articles in shaping\npublic discourse on the issue.\nMajor Research Questions\nThe principal questions of the study included the following:\nResearch Question 1: In what way did the selected dai-\nlies show their stance on the LBA issue?\nResearch Question 2: Did they support or oppose the\nprocess of reaching consensus regarding LBA?\nResearch Question 3: Did the dailies view the matter\nneutrally, going beyond the national interest or supporting\nfor a greater bilateral relationship?\nResearch Question 4: How did they present the editorial\ncontent? What was the tone of the presentation?\nResearch Question 5: How did the dailies put emphasis\non the political affiliation or ideology in analyzing and\ninterpreting the issue?\nTheoretical Framework of the Study\nThe study mainly bases on two influential schools of thoughts\nin the domain of media and communication studies: social\nresponsibility theory of the press, and agenda setting and\nframing functions of media. The social responsibility theory\nof the press emphasizes on the need for an independent press\nthat scrutinizes different social institutions and provides\nobjective and accurate news reports as well as impartial\ninterpretation of various phenomena. Social responsibility\ntheory challenged media professionals' ingenuity to develop\nnew ways of serving their communities. It encouraged them\nto see themselves as frontline participants in the battle to pre-\nserve democracy in a world drifting inexorably toward totali-\ntarianism. By helping pluralistic groups, media were building\n4 SAGE Open\na wall to protect democracy from external and internal foes\nbasic principles of social responsibility theory of which some\nof the relevant aspects with the present study are as follows:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Media should accept and fulfill certain obligations to\nsociety.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 These obligations are mainly to be met by setting high\nor professional standards of informativeness, truth,\naccuracy, objectivity, and balance.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 In accepting and applying these obligations, media\nshould be self-regulating within the framework of law\nand established institutions.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The media as a whole should be pluralist and reflect\nthe diversity of their society, giving access to various\npoints of view and to rights of reply.\nAgenda-setting is the process whereby the news media\nlead the public in assigning relative importance to various\npublic issues (Zhu & Blood, 1997). The core idea is that the\nnews media indicate to the public what the main issues of the\nday are and this is reflected in what the public perceives as\nthe main issues (McQuail, 2005). The media agenda influ-\nences the public agenda not by saying \"this issue is impor-\ntant\" in an overt way but by giving more space and time to\nthat issue and by giving it more prominent space and time\nIn the lights of these two perspectives, it has been searched\nout how the editorials of the selected newspapers of\nBangladesh and India have considered and interpreted the\nLBA issue and how significantly they have undertaken the\nissue for analysis and presentation.\nMethod of the Study\nThe study has been conducted applying the combination of\ncontent analysis and discourse analysis method. Content\nanalysis is a specific research approach used frequently in all\nthe areas of the media studies. This method is popular with\nmass media researchers because it is an efficient way to\ninvestigate the content of the media. Walizer and Wienir\n(1978) defined it as any systematic procedure devised to\nexamine the content of recorded information, whereas\nKrippendorff (2004) defined it as a research technique for\nmaking replicable and valid references from data to their\ncontext. Kerlinger's (2000) definition is fairly typical:\n\"Content analysis is a method of studying and analyzing\ncommunication in a systematic, objective, and quantitative\nmanner for the purpose of measuring variables (p. 144).\"\n1,977 full-length research articles published in Journalism\nwere content analyses. Kamhawi and Weaver (2003) revealed\nthat content analysis was the most popular data-gathering\nmethod reported in major mass communication journals\nthree journals that focus on mass communication research\n(Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, Journalism\nand Mass Communication Quarterly, and Mass\ncontent analysis was still a popular method, used in about\none third of all published articles (Wimmer & Dominick,\nDiscourse analysis is a methodology for analyzing social\nphenomena that are qualitative, interpretative, and construc-\ntionist. It explores how the socially constructed ideas and\nobjects are created and used in the media content. Discourse\nanalysis focuses on media text and tries to explain how the\ntext constructs the social reality. It deals with tools and tech-\nniques of the media used for emphasizing and de-emphasiz-\ning an issue, an individual, or a group by using metaphors,\nwords, imposing images, and so on (Islam & Kabir, 2015).\nBoth of the methodologies were applied to obtain in-depth\nfindings according to their relevance while investigating\nsuch research issue.\nSelection of the Sample Dailies\nSix dailies--three from each of the countries, Bangladesh\nand India--were selected for the study. The dailies selected\nfrom Bangladesh include the Prothom Alo, the Naya Diganta,\nand the New Age, whereas the selected dailies from India are\nthe Times of India, the Hindu, and the Anandabazar Patrika.\nThese dailies have been selected based on their circulation,\navailability, and perceived ideological bias.\nThe selected dailies in brief.The Prothom Alo is one of the\nleading vernacular national dailies in Bangladesh owned by\none of the country's major business companies \"Transcom\nLimited.\" The political affiliation of the owner is not clear;\nhowever, the editor of the daily was leaning toward the leftist\nideology previously. The Naya Diganta is one of the major\nvernacular national dailies too in the country which is owned\nby an influential leader of Bangladesh Jammat-e-Islami, one\nof the dominant allies of Bangladesh Nationalist Party\n(BNP). The daily is perceived commonly having pro-Islamic\nattitude and rightist ideology. Tone of the daily is strongly\ncritical toward the ruling party Bangladesh Awami League\nand the government activities. The New Age is one of the\nmajor English-language dailies published from Dhaka, Ban-\ngladesh, of which the editor is perceived leaning toward the\nleftist ideology and critical to the ruling party Bangladesh\nAwami League and the government.\nThe Anandabazar Patrika is a Bengali-language newspa-\nper published from Kolkata, New Delhi, and Mumbai, India\nby Ananda Bazar Patrika Group. According to the \"Audit\nBureau of Circulations,\" India, the daily has a circulation of\nIndian Readership Survey (IRS) 2012, it is the only major\nBengali newspaper in India and has an average issue\nHasan and Islam 5\nreadership of 5.8 million. Presently, the newspaper is edited\nby Aveek Sarkar (Anandabazar Patrika, n.d.). It is perceived\nthat the daily demonstrates an antileftist political ideology\nleaning toward the rightist part of the Congress.\nThe Times of India is an Indian English-language daily\nnewspaper. It is the third largest newspaper in India by circu-\nlation and largest selling English-language daily in the world\naccording to Audit Bureau of Circulations (India). According\nto IRS 2012, the Times of India is the most widely read\nEnglish newspaper in India with a readership of 7.643 mil-\nlion. This ranks the Times of India as the top English daily in\nIndia by readership. It is owned and published by Bennett\nColeman & Co. Ltd., which is owned by the Sahu Jain family\n(The Times of India, n.d.).\nThe daily was sometimes perceived showing bias toward\nthe UPA government; however, it also supported Anna\nHazare campaign against the Congress-led government\n(Thakur, 2013). The daily Hindu, being another leading\nEnglish-language daily of India, headquartered in Chennai.\nIt is the second most circulated English-language newspaper\nin India with an average qualifying sale of 1.39 million cop-\nthird most widely read English newspaper in India (after the\nTimes of India and Hindustan Times), with a readership of\n2.2 million people. The Hindu has its largest base of circula-\ntion in southern India, and is the most widely read English\ndaily newspaper in Kerala and Tamil Nadu (The Hindu, n.d.).\nThe daily is perceived sympathetic toward the leftist political\nideology supporting the Communist Party of India (Marxist)\nSelection of the Editorials\nAfter a long pause, the LBAissue became a media buzzing in\nMay 2015 when the agreement was being tabled in the Indian\nParliament for ratification. The issue came to a bilateral set-\ntlement through the visit of Indian Prime Minister in Dhaka\nduring early June of 2015. Considering this timeline, the edi-\nunder the study. During the period, the selected dailies had\npublished 21 editorials. Of the editorials, nine were pub-\nlished in the dailies selected from India while the remaining\nones were from Bangladesh. Table 1 shows the titles of the\neditorials that underwent analysis:\nFindings of the Study\nThe Prothom Alo\nEditorial tone of the daily was critical to both of the govern-\nments--India and Bangladesh--as well as the policy makers\nfor pending the issue. Dilly-dally of the Indian government\nand policy makers have been criticized boldly for not step-\nping forward to implement the LBA. The daily criticized\nIndia for not implementing the protocol signed during the\nvisit of Manmohan Singh in 2011. Exclusion of Assam at the\ninitial phase of tabling the amendment bill of LBA imple-\nmentation by the Modi government has been critically\nviewed by the daily.\nThe editorial article titled, \"Dual Role of New Delhi--No\nChance to Reform the Land BoundaryAgreement\" published\non May 4, 2015, criticized the initiative of putting forward\nthe approval of the amendment bill by the Modi government\nin the face of opposition of the Assam BJP and termed the\nprocess as unacceptable. The tone of the article went for an\ninclusive solution to the issue. Similarly, the article viewed\nthe role of the Bangladesh government in this regard as\n\"ambiguous and weak.\" In the article, it was questioned,\n\"Which one is more important for the government--Modi's\nvisit or implementation of the agreement?\"\nSilence of Bangladesh Government regarding putting for-\nward the issue has been also criticized in the editorial cover-\nage. The editorial article titled, \"Land Boundary Agreement\nRatification--Congratulations to the Indian Leaders,\" pub-\nlished on May 9, 2015, highly acknowledged the contribu-\ntion of the Indian Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition,\nand the Chief Ministers of the provinces concerning to the\nenclaves. Special thanks were paid to the Chief Minister of\nAssam. The article also implied on the sensible resolution of\nthe pending Teesta water sharing deal. Apart from effective\nimplementation of LBA, the daily has stressed on the reha-\nbilitation of the inhabitants of the geographically scattered\nenclaves who were deprived of the citizen rights for 68 years.\nThe Naya Diganta\nThe editorial tone of the daily was strongly critical toward\nIndia's policy. The daily boldly criticized initial step of the\nModi government for tabling the amendment bill of LBA\nexcluding Assam in the face of Assam BJP's claim of losing\nland due to the implementation procedure. However, oppos-\ning the BJP's statement, Assam's Chief Minister outlined the\nreal scenario of land distribution where it was depicted that\nthe claim of BJP regarding losing of land was not true. Modi\ngovernment did not pay heed to Assam BJP's statement\nrather relied on the Chief Minister's speech and included\nAssam in the process of LBA implementation through the\nparliamentary process of voting on the bill regarding the\nissue. The editorial published on May 11, 2015, explains that\nIndia always remains sincere to its own interests. The daily\ncalls India to move from its one-sided stance regarding set-\ntlement of the bilateral issue. The editorial indicates Farakka\nissue too.\napprehension of losing sovereignty of \"Tin Bigha Corridor\"\nwas felt due to continuous surveillance of Border Security\nForce (BSF) on the passage of the Bangladeshis though the\ncorridor is leased to Bangladesh for 99 years. The editorial\narticle titled, \"Exclusion of Assam From LBA--Strategy for\nEnduring Is Not Desired,\" published on May 6, 2015,\n6 SAGE Open\nemphasized that India should shun the intention of one-sided\nbenefit and authoritative attitude in the interest of maintain-\ning good relationship with Bangladesh. The article men-\ntioned, \"Unfortunately, Bangladesh is being often deprived\nof having rational and sympathetic attitude from India.\" The\ndaily, in this article, expressed its concern of security for the\ncritics of Indian policies in Bangladesh.\ncated that the ruling Awami League has a big agenda to\nmaintain good relation with Modi government for its whole-\nhearted support to sustain in the power. Apart from these, the\ndaily poured efforts to link between the speeches of some\ninfluential leaders of Awami League and apprehension of\nlosing sovereignty of Bangladesh. The tone of the editorial\nimplicated that two countries (Bangladesh and India) were\nturning together into one state.\nThe New Age\nThe daily was thoroughly found critical toward the stance of\nboth the governments--Bangladesh and India--regarding\ndelayed ratification of the long-pending LBA by the Indian\nParliament. In an editorial titled, \"LBA Ratification by India,\nCongress Fixation of Bangladeshi Ruling Elite,\" the daily\ncriticized the ruling party of Bangladesh, Awami League for\nits perceived dependence and preference to Congress for set-\ntling the LBA issue with India. At the same time, the daily\ntoned that the BJP government promised more than the\nCongress to Bangladesh regarding settling bilateral disputes\nand preserving mutual relationship that developed around\nIndia's support to the liberation war of Bangladesh. The daily\nsuggested Awami League to keep pace with the reality rather\nthan being obsessed to the political party, the Indian National\nCongress.\nThe daily voiced to establish linkage with the Awami\nLeague's initiatives of LBA implementation and other bipar-\ntite relationship with India as a means of gaining support\nfrom the country to \"cling to power.\" The daily criticized the\neffort of BNP to gain support from India with a hope for its\nreturn to state power. The daily was critical toward the bor-\nder killing by the BSF of India and India's position regarding\nwater sharing of the River Teesta. The daily rated Modi's\nvisit to Bangladesh as an insignificant event for the country.\nThe Anandabazar Patrika\nThe overall stance of the daily was in favor of the LBA issue\nthough it has poured efforts to give a satirical analysis in\nsome of its content. The tone of satire was mostly limited to\nMamata and Modi's political game and attitude. The daily\nTable 1.

The daily implicated\nthe failure of Manmohan Singh in managing Mamata on the\nissue. The editorial tone of the daily emphasized on coopera-\ntion, coordination, and mutual understanding between the\nstates and the central government of India. Dynamics of\nAssam issue in the process of LBA settlement amid ideologi-\ncal differences among political parties also got importance in\nthe editorial coverage. The daily presented political analysis\nregarding differences and amity between Modi and Assam\nBJP. Political \"gain\u00adloss\" has been also stressed over inclu-\nsion of Assam in the process of LBA settlement between\nIndia and Bangladesh.\nThe editorial article titled, \"Unusual,\" published on May\nTo what extent the votes of BJP will decline in Assam due to the\nagreement with Bangladesh is not clear at all, if it declines, it\nwill be a minimal loss. The ratification and implementation of\nthe LBA will not only lessen the sufferings of the enclave\ndwellers but also pave the way of resolving a long pending issue\nand reinforce bilateral relationship with Bangladesh.\nOne of the mentionable aspects of the editorial coverage\nof the daily was to give credit to Modi government for his\npolitical gain over inclusion of Assam in the ratification pro-\ncess. As a result of such inclusion, Modi was able to manage\nthe main opposition Congress's support in the Parliament\nwhich was highly appreciated by the daily. Modi's political\nstance, leadership, decisions, and determination were ana-\nlyzed as positive and effective in the process of LBA\nratification.\nThe Times of India\nThe daily thoroughly favored the process of LBA ratification.\nThe daily urged the Modi government to implement the LBA\nwithout any delay and excuse. The editorials of the daily\nshowed a great concern for boosting up regional development\nand mutual relationship through proper implementation of the\nLBA. The daily in its one editorial write-up stated, \"Needless\nto say, operationalising LBA will give a tremendous boost to\nIndia-Bangladesh relations. With ratification of the agree-\nment, the goodwill generated should propel both sides to set-\ntle other outstanding issues such as Teesta river water sharing\nand transit rights.\" The daily wrote \"must stop playing poli-\ntics and ratify LBA without any exclusion\" aiming at the\nModi government. On May 8, an editorial titled, \"Border\nBreakthrough: Ratification of LBA Paves the Way for\nEnhanced India\u00adBangladesh Ties and Regional Growth,\" was\nwritten of which the tone of the words has expressed strong\nurge for LBA ratification and implementation. The daily also\nstressed on full ratification of the LBA as envisaged by New\nDelhi and Dhaka in their 2011 agreement. In one of its edito-\nrials published on June 8, 2015, the daily rated Modi's visit to\nDhaka as very successful one which \"raises hopes of subcon-\ntinent's Berlin wall coming down.\"\nThe Hindu\nThe daily termed the LBA issue as a \"Political Game\"\nbetween the countries, political parties, and leaders. The tone\nof the editorial of the daily was also in favor of resolving the\nenclave issue that triggered from lack of consensus regarding\nLBA settlement between India and Bangladesh. The daily in\nits editorial viewed the enclave issue as an uncertainty and\nmisery for 51,000 people of both the countries. The Hindu\nadvocated for the inclusion of Assam in the process of LBA\nsettlement. The daily, however, pinched Modi government\nand tried to link the LBA issue with the provincial politics\nand election. The editorials of the daily strongly criticized\nIndia's delay in terms of taking on positive measures in\nregard to find a solution to the issue. The daily recognized\nthe issue as a matter of India's credibility to Bangladesh too\nand stressed on promotion of friendly relationship with the\nneighborhood through peaceful resolution of the same.\nThe editorial article titled, \"Local Politics in Foreign\nPolicy,\" published on May 5, 2015, clearly implies that the\nGovernment of India should have minimized the \"lapse of\ncommunication\" with Bangladesh regarding the revised plan\nof the amendment bill regarding the LBA ratification. In the\nsame article, the delays of India at different stages were\nmarked and said, \"Each of these delays don't just put off an\nagreement to resolve a crucial issue between India and\nBangladesh, they chip away at India's credibility in the\nneighbourhood.\"\nAnalysis of Findings\nBoth Naya Diganta and the New Age were found expressing\nthe views almost in similar manner. Editorial tone of both the\ndailies was critical toward both the government of India and\nBangladesh. The Naya Diganta endeavored to establish a\nrelationship of the rulingAwami League with the Government\nof India, especially with Modi's administration for availing\nsupport to remain in the state power. On the contrary, the\ndaily tried to represent the government and policy makers of\nIndia concentrating on their own interests rather than consid-\nering bilateral relationship with Bangladesh. The New Age,\nconversely, put more emphasis on the role of the Indian gov-\nernment for not resolving the lengthy LBAissue. The editori-\nals were found critical to point out India's responsibilities for\npending the issue for decades. The editorials of the Prothom\nAlo have concentrated on event and issue-based develop-\nment of the LBA ratification and implementation process.\nThe daily was critical toward both the government of India\nand Bangladesh in regard to resolving the bilateral issue.\nHowever, pro-Bangladesh and pro-people attitude of the\n8 SAGE Open\neditorial contents were reflected while the tone of criticizing\nIndia's role was predominant.\nThe Times of India was found possessing an attitude\ntoward the betterment of the people of both the countries\nrather than the political and diplomatic gain over LBA issue.\nThe editorial focus of the daily laid on bilateral relation,\nregional economic growth, peaceful coexistence, and mutual\nunderstanding between the countries. The daily advocated\nfor maintaining a friendly relationship based on mutual trust\nand benefits through settling down the issue. The daily, even\nbeing published from India, has boldly criticized Indian poli-\ncies and the political dilemma surrounding ratification and\nimplementation of the LBA as well as urged the Indian gov-\nernment to quicken the process of resolving the prolonged\nenclave crisis.\nThe Hindu has expressed almost similar type of notion\nshowed by the Times of India. Editorial tone of the daily in\nanalyzing the facts concerning the LBA and enclave issues\ncan be rated as liberal. The daily, like the Times of India,\nshowed its stance toward maintaining a bilateral relationship\nthrough peaceful and quick settlement of the long-drawn-out\nLBA issue in the interest of the regional development. The\ndaily seemed critical to the delay of India's policy makers in\nresolving the issue. Satire.\nApart from the above two dailies, the Anandabazar\nPatrika, was somewhat different in viewing the issue and\nshowing its standpoint. Tone of the editorial coverage of the\ndaily seemed light and satirical. The editorial write-ups were\nfound paying more attention on the interpretation of the\npolitical dynamics and relation between the political parties\nof India rather than pouring deep concentration on the LBA\nissue itself. Debates over the power, politics, and influence\nstructures between the central and provincial government\nand the political parties of India were emphasized in the edi-\ntorials. However, the daily's bias toward steering on mutual\nrelationship and interest between Bangladesh and India was\nvisible.\nConclusion\nThe editorial stance of the dailies can be rated upholding\nboth the national and bipartite interests on the whole.\nPresentation and analysis of the facts in the editorials were\nlinked with the political and ideological affiliation of the\nowners and the editors of the dailies. For example, the Naya\nDiganta, perceived as the rightist daily having direct politi-\ncal and ideological affiliation with Bangladesh Jammat-e-\nIslami, critically portrayed the issue emphasizing the\ngovernment's reported attachment with India for sustaining\ninto power. The editorials of the Prothom Alo were written\nwith moderate balancing between facts and public interest.\nThe daily tried to analyze the situations around the LBA\nissue considering the political dynamics of both the countries\nrather than blaming any government blindly. On the contrary,\nthe New Age perceived as one of the dailies having leftist\nideology was more critical to India's role in settling down the\nissue. The Indian dailies were found expressing different\ntones too. The Anandabazar Patrika was found more critical\nto Mamata's administration while the Times of India and the\nHindu were critical toward the policies of the Government of\nIndia. The aforesaid analyses facilitate to conclude that the\nIndian dailies played more versatile role through liberal pre-\nsentation of the content, neutralized analysis, and call for the\ngreater welfare of the people of both the countries.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAnandabazar Patrika.
