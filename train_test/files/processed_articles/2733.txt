In order to test both processes, we examine two forms of developmental stability from ages 2\nto 14 years: strength (i.e., consistency in the amount of variance explained by general and specific factors) and\nphenotypic stability (i.e., homotypic and heterotypic continuity). Methods: Data are from the NICHD Study of Early\nChild Care and Youth Development. Psychopathology symptoms were assessed nine times between ages 2 and\n14 years (n = 1,253) using the Child Behavior Checklist completed by mothers. Confirmatory bifactor modeling was\nused to test structural models of psychopathology at each age. Consistency in strength was examined by calculating\nthe Explained Common Variance (ECV) and phenotypic stability was investigated with cross-lagged modeling of the\ngeneral and specific factors. Results: Bifactor models fit the data well across this developmental period. ECV values\nwere reasonably consistent across development, with the general factor accounting for the majority of shared\nvariance (61%\u00ad71%). Evidence of both homotypic and heterotypic continuity emerged, with most heterotypic\ncontinuity involving the general factor, as it both predicted and was predicted by specific factors. Conclusions: A\nbifactor model effectively captures psychopathological comorbidity from early childhood through adolescence. The\nlongitudinal associations between the general and specific factors provide evidence for both the hypothesized\nprocesses (dynamic mutualism and p-differentiation) occurring through development.

Currently the most widely discussed\nmodel includes a general psychopathological factor,\nlabeled p, that is purported to account for the\nmoderate correlations between psychopathological\ndimensions (Caspi et al., 2014; Lahey, Krueger,\nRathouz, Waldman, & Zald, 2016). In a psychome-\ntric sense, p is typically represented as a general\nbifactor that is orthogonally related to a set of\nspecific factors (Caspi et al., 2014; Lahey et al.,\n2012). As such, p explains the variance shared by\nall psychiatric symptoms/disorders, with addi-\ntional variance accounted for by distinct specific\nfactors. Specific factors typically take the form of\ninternalizing and externalizing, with additional\nfactors depending on the symptoms/disorders\nassessed (e.g., thought disorder, attention prob-\nlems). This model has been replicated in diverse\nsamples of adults (Greene & Eaton, 2017; Lahey\net al., 2012) and adolescents/children (Hankin\nPatalay et al., 2015), using both symptom- (Car-\norder-level data (Greene & Eaton, 2017; Laceulle\nEven as p is empirically well-established, it\nremains a somewhat controversial topic. This model\nhas been criticized for lacking parsimony, and sim-\nulation research suggests that fit statistics may be\nbiased toward bifactor models when they are com-\npared with traditional correlated factor models,\nleading some to suggest that p is merely a statistical\nartifact (Bonifay, Lane, & Reise, 2017). Whether p\nreflects a substantive construct remains open to\ndebate; nevertheless, robust correlations with exter-\nnal variables (e.g., cognitive ability, negative emo-\ntionality, demographic factors), and predictive value\nfor future psychopathology (Lahey, Krueger,\nRathouz, Waldman, & Zald, 2017; Patalay et al.,\nConflict of interest statement: No conflicts declared.\n\u00a9 2017 The Authors.

With regard to its\ndevelopment, two opposing processes have been pro-\nposed (Murray et al., 2016). First, `p-differentiation'\npresumes that p reflects a general liability to any and\nall forms of psychopathology, with symptom expres-\nsion becoming increasingly specific over time (Murray\npsychopathological dimensions are typically favored\nearlier in childhood, giving way to more distinct\ncategorical diagnoses as adolescents approach adult-\nhood, in both research and clinical practice, certainly\nsuggests that symptom manifestations become more\nspecific over time (Caspi et al., 2014; Patalay et al.,\n2015). The alternative perspective, referred to as\ndynamic mutualism, stipulates that, rather than\nreflecting overall risk, p captures local-level interac-\ntions, whereby symptoms directly influence and rein-\nforce each other (Murray et al., 2016; Van Der Maas\net al., 2006). When left unchecked, this may result in\nstronger inter-item associations over time (Van Der\nMaas et al., 2006). In consequence, symptoms that\nare initially distinct may become increasingly associ-\nated as psychopathology develops, resulting in\nincreased cross-domain comorbidity (Caspi et al.,\nInvestigation of the developmental stability of p\nmay help illuminate its fundamental character, yet\nfew such studies have been reported. Thus, the\npresent report seeks to evaluate and illuminate two\ntypes of developmental stability: strength consis-\ntency and phenotypic stability. The former refers to\nthe extent that both p and specific factors explain a\nconsistent amount of variance over time, whereas\nthe latter refers to the extent to which symptom\nmanifestations remain consistent over development.\nBoth forms of stability may provide insight into the\ndevelopmental nature of p. For example, given that\ndynamic mutualism is based on the idea that inter-\nitem correlations become stronger due to reciprocal\nreinforcement, one would expect to see an increase\nin the dominant source of covariance (i.e., p) over\ntime at the expense of specific factors (Caspi et al.,\n2006). This would be reflected in greater levels of\ncross-domain (i.e., both internalizing and external-\nizing symptomatology/disorders) comorbidity over\ndevelopment. Alternatively, if p represents a more\ngeneral liability to psychopathology which manifests\nas increasingly specific expressions over time, one\nwould expect the opposite pattern to occur, with\nincreasingly domain-specific patterns of psy-\nchopathology emerging (Murray et al., 2016; Patalay\nIn the only study to have investigated this issue to\ndate, Murray et al. (2016) examined the consistency\nof the variance explained by p in a representative\ncohort assessed eight times between ages 7 and\nattributable to both p and specific factors remained\nconsistent over time, with p accounting for the vast\nmajority of shared variance. Notably, the conclu-\nsions drawn from these results were that neither\ndynamic mutualism nor p-differentiation alone were\nsufficient to explain the development of comorbidity\nover this period, as their hypothesized patterns of\nincreasing or decreasing symptom covariance attri-\nbutable to p were not observed. Indeed, it remains\npossible that both dynamic processes are at play\nand, when examined solely using a variance\nexplained approach, this may result in the two\nopposing processes effectively cancelling each other\nout. This possibility is explicitly examined in the\ncurrent study, as we investigate the phenotypic\nstability of p and specific psychopathological factors.\nPhenotypic stability is perhaps best thought of in\nterms of homotypic continuity (i.e., one construct\npredicting itself at a later time point) and heterotypic\ncontinuity (i.e., one construct predicting another\nconstruct at a later time point) (Angold, Costello, &\nErkanli, 1999). Evidence of heterotypic continuity\ncould be consistent with dynamic mutualism or p-\ndifferentiation, depending on the direction of the\neffects. A positive association between p at baseline\nand a specific factor at a later time point would be in\nline with p-differentiation, with a general manifesta-\ntion of comorbid psychopathology placing an indi-\nvidual at risk of more specific manifestations later\non. Alternatively, positive associations between\nspecific factors at baseline and subsequent p would\nsuggest that individuals suffering from a particular\ntype of psychopathology may be more likely to\ndevelop cross-domain comorbidity over time as\nintersymptom associations become stronger; this\nwould be consistent with dynamic mutualism.\nTo our knowledge, only two studies have examined\nthe phenotypic stability of p. Greene and Eaton\n(2017) examined the homotypic and heterotypic\ncontinuity of p, as well as the specific internalizing\nand externalizing dimensions in the National Epi-\ndemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Condi-\ntions (age range 18\u00ad90 + years). Strong homotypic\ncontinuity was observed between waves 1 and 2,\nwith no significant heterotypic continuity, a result\nconsistent with Snyder, Young, and Hankin's (2017)\nstudy of young adolescents (i.e., between 13.5 and\n15 years of age). Such results suggest, once again,\nthat neither dynamic mutualism nor p-differentia-\ntion adequately characterizes the development of p.\nIt must be noted, however, that both studies just\ncited were limited to only two assessment waves,\nwith little time (approximately 18\u00ad24 months)\nbetween assessments. A more extensive longitudinal\ninvestigation, especially one covering a time when\ndevelopmental changes are more salient and symp-\ntom stability is in greater flux, might provide a\n\u00a9 2017 The Authors. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Association for\nChild and Adolescent Mental Health.\nclearer picture of the phenotypic stability of p and\nspecific factors across development.\nThe present study aimed to extend current under-\nstanding of the development of p in three ways. First,\nwe examine the structure of psychopathology in a\nsample assessed nine times from early childhood\n(age 2 years) through adolescence (age 14 years). In\nlight of the fact that most work on the p-factor model\nusing preadult samples has focused on adolescents\nHankin, 2016), although one study includes children\nas young as 3 years of age (Olino, Dougherty, Buf-\nferd, Carlson, & Klein, 2014), we are positioned to\ndetermine not only whether the model holds for very\nyoung children but also how it develops over child-\nhood and into early adolescence. Moreover, the\nresearch reported herein evaluates the consistency\nover time of the strength of the p factor and specific\nfactors in terms of the variance they account for\nacross this developmental period. The only previous\nstudy to examine this aspect of p began at age 7\n(Murray et al., 2016), potentially missing out on a\nkey period over which the processes that underlie\ncomorbidity may develop. Finally, the current work\nchronicles phenotypic stability, that is, the homo-\ntypic and heterotypic continuity of p and specific\nfactors over time.\nMethods\nSample/Participants\nData came from the National Institute of Child Health and\nHuman Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth\nDevelopment, a prospective cohort study of children born in\nChild Care Research Network, 2005). The initial sample com-\nprised of 1,364 parent\u00adchild pairs. For the present study, data\nwere available for 1,253 children (51% female). Although the\nsample was diverse, it was not designed to be nationally\nrepresentative, in that participating families had higher average\nincome and education and were less likely to be of an ethnic\nminority (Watamura, Phillips, Morrissey, McCartney, & Bub,\n2011). Ethical approval for the NICHD study was granted by all\ndata-collecting universities prior to data collection and at each\nassessment informed consent was secured from parents and/or\nteacher. More detailed descriptions of the NICHD Study, includ-\ning recruitment and assessment procedures, are available\nelsewhere (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2005).\nMeasures\nPsychopathology was measured using the Child Behavior\nChecklist (CBCL) (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001), a standardized\nsymptoms, each of which is rated on a 3-point scale (0 = not\ntrue; 1 = somewhat/sometimes true; 2 = very true/often). For\n2\u00ad3 year olds, the CBCL/1.5\u00ad5 was used (Achenbach, Edel-\nRescorla, 2001), was used to assess problems from age 5 years\n(Achenbach, 1991), in which certain items were replaced (for a\ndescription of these differences see Achenbach & Rescorla,\n2001). For consistency, the present study only included items\nmeasures from age 5 through to age 14; thus, we omitted the\nadditionalCBCL/6\u00ad18itemsthatwere added/replacedfromage\n10. Items from the two broad dimensions of internalizing and\nexternalizing, along with items from the distinct attention\nproblems syndrome were included in the present analysis.\nDue to low endorsement of responses indicating severe presence\nof symptoms, items were rescored to indicate presence of\nsymptoms (i.e., raw responses of 1 or 2 coded as 1) in line with\ncommon practice when conducting item-level analyses of the\nCBCL (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001; Deutz, Geeraerts, van\nBaar, Dekovi\nc, & Prinzie, 2016). To aid estimation, items with\nminimal variation (i.e., counts of five individuals or less in either\nof the binary categories) were removed.\nMissing data\nIn order to ensure that attrition did not bias the results,\nimputation was conducted using the R package AMELIA-II,\nwhich uses expectation-maximization (Honaker, King, &\nBlackwell, 2011). A single imputed dataset based on all\nparticipants who provided at least some CBCL data was\nStatistical analysis\nFirst, confirmatory factor models (CFAs) and confirmatory\nbifactor models (CBMs) were estimated at each time point. The\nCFAs were comprised of three correlated factors: internalizing,\nexternalizing and attention problems. The CBMs included a\ngeneral factor that was uncorrelated with the three specific\nfactors. The correlations between the specific factors were fixed\nto zero in the bifactor models. Bifactor models were chosen\nover second-order factor models as they were deemed a more\nappropriate means of testing dynamic mutualism versus p-\ndifferentiation. With second-order modeling, the general factor\nrepresents the variance shared by the specific factors. Bifactor\nmodels differ in that the general and specific factors exist at the\nsame theoretical level and compete to explain item variance;\nthus, the variance explained by both general and specific\nfactors can be directly compared.\nThere is some debate as to whether attention/hyperactivity\nproblems form a distinct psychopathological dimension, or\nwhether they should be considered part of the externalizing\ndimension (Krueger & South, 2009). The developmental liter-\nature has largely treated attention/hyperactivity as a unique\ndimension that correlates with both internalizing and exter-\nGeeraerts et al., 2015). Given that the CBCL makes this\ndistinction, a distinct attention/hyperactivity factor was\nincluded in the present analysis.\nConfirmatory factor models and confirmatory bifactor models\nwere estimated using the robust weighted least squares estima-\ntor (WLSMV). Models were identified by fixing the variance of\neach factor to 1, and freely estimating the first factor loading.\nModelfitwas assessedusingtheComparativeFit Index(CFI)and\nTucker Lewis Index (TLI) for which, respectively, values of >.90\nreflectacceptable fit and>.95representverygoodmodelfit(Hu &\napproximation (RMSEA) (Steiger, 1990), for which values below\n.06 are considered acceptable (Hu & Bentler, 1999). Construct\nreliability (H) was assessed based on the guidelines of Hancock\nand Mueller (2001). H evaluates how well a latent variable is\nrepresented by its given items, and as such how suitable and\nreplicable an SEM model is likely to be (Rodriguez, Reise, &\nHaviland, 2016). H is calculated as the ratio of variance\nexplained by a latent variable relative to the variance left\nunexplained. Ranging from 0 to 1, higher values indicate better\n\u00a9 2017 The Authors.

ECV values can\nalso be calculated in a similar manner for the specific factors.\nECV values range from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1\nsuggesting a greater share of variance explained.

This\nsuggests both p and internalizing factors were well\nrepresented by their items (Hancock & Mueller, 2001).\nH values ranged from .70 to .82 for externalizing and\n.59 to .68 for attention, suggesting these factors were\nless well-defined (Hancock & Mueller, 2001).\nStrength consistency\nFigure 1 displays ECV values across time.

The attention factor explained little\noverall variance (.04\u00ad.06).

All autore-\ngressive (i.e., homotypic) effects were statistically\nsignificant.

This research\nwas based on the p-factor approach to the modeling\nof psychopathology, with a general bifactor account-\ning for the covariance between all psychopathologi-\ncal symptoms (Caspi et al., 2014; Lahey et al.,\n2012). Although p has repeatedly been discerned in\ncross-sectional data, few studies have examined its\ndevelopment. Investigating the longitudinal develop-\nment of general and specific dimensions of psy-\nchopathology may lead to a better understanding of\nthe development of psychiatric disorders across the\nlife course. Furthermore, a better understanding of\nthe developmental processes that underlie p may\nhelp establish an agreed-upon interpretation of this\nfactor, something that has so far proven elusive.\nFigure 1 ECV values across time. p, general psychopathology; INT, internalizing; EXT, externalizing; ATT, attention problems [Colour\nfigure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]\np p p p p p p p p\nFigure 2 Standardized path coefficients (calculated using factor scores) across time.

Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Association for\nChild and Adolescent Mental Health.\nThe present study examined two forms of develop-\nmental stability, strength consistency, and pheno-\ntypic stability, in an attempt to determine whether\nthe development of p was characterized by either\ndynamic mutualism or p-differentiation. With regard\nto consistency in strength, both p and the specific\nfactors explained very consistent proportions of\nvariance across time, with p explaining the majority\nof shared variance at all time points. These findings\nare in line with those of Murray et al. (2016). The fact\nthat the amount of variance accounted for by p and\nthe specific factors did not change over time seems\ninconsistent with both p-differentiation and dynamic\nmutualism, as they hypothesize respectively,\nincreasing and decreasing relative contributions of\np to symptom variance across time. It must be noted,\nhowever, that p was derived from cross-sectional\ndata at each time point in the present study and that\nof Murray et al. (2016), meaning each p factor\nrepresented the variance attributable to comorbidity,\nin whatever form that took, at a particular age. In\nsimple terms, p was used to capture all comorbidity\nat a given age, although the underlying meaning of p\nmay vary developmentally.\nHeterotypic continuity was notably evident, even if\nit was less common and weaker than homotypic\ncontinuity. The presence of heterotypic continuity\nsuggests significant individual-level change in the\nphenotypic expression of psychopathology. Overall,\np appeared to lie at the heart of heterotypic conti-\nnuity, with almost all positive heterotypic effects\nfeeding into or emerging from p. For example, p\npredicted all three specific factors at subsequent\ntime points, and was itself predicted at future time\npoints at least once by earlier measurements of both\nexternalizing and internalizing. This suggests that\nspecific manifestations of psychopathology led to\nincreased risk of comorbid psychopathology (i.e., p)\nover time, and vice versa. This would seem to\ncontradict the previous claim that neither dynamic\nmutualism nor p-differentiation characterizes the\ndevelopment of psychopathology. Indeed, the data\nsuggest that both developmental processes may be\noperating concurrently, possibly cancelling each\nother out when using the relative amount of variance\nexplained as a measure of stability (e.g., Murray\net al., 2016). Put simply, there may be certain\nindividuals for whom symptoms become more speci-\nfic over time (i.e., p ? internalizing, externalizing, or\nattention), whereas others experience more comor-\nbidity (internalizing, externalizing, or attention ? p),\nand still others who experience both processes.\nHaving raised the aforementioned possibilities, a\ncloser examination of the individual effects observed\nherein would seem in line with previous studies\nusing person-centered methodologies, which further\nsupport the idea that both processes, p-differentia-\ntion and dynamic mutualism, may occur simultane-\nously. For example, person-centered studies have\nidentified unique classes that describe patterns of\nco-occurring symptomatology both cross-sectionally\n(Vaidyanathan, Patrick, & Iacono, 2011) and longi-\ntudinally through childhood (Patalay, Moulton,\nGoodman, & Ploubidis, 2017). Recent research\ninvestigating transitions between these cross-sec-\ntional classes over time indicate that transitions\nbetween `pure' psychopathological classes (e.g., pre-\ndominantly internalizing or externalizing) and\ncomorbid classes are relatively common, with tran-\nsitions more often observed to and from comorbid\nand predominantly externalizing classes (Basten\n& Murphy, 2017; Willner, Gatzke-Kopp, & Bray,\n2016). The findings of the present variable-centered\nstudy mirror these results; externalizing and p\ndemonstrated stronger reciprocal relationships over\ntime than internalizing and p. Indeed, it appears that\nthose who score high on p initially could potentially\ndevelop more specific psychopathology in any of the\nthree specific domains. Those with more externaliz-\ning problems at baseline, however, appear more\nlikely to develop comorbid internalizing symptoms\nover time, whereas the converse is less likely. This is\nvery much in line with cascade models, which have\nhighlighted the role of externalizing in the develop-\nment of subsequent co-occurring internalizing prob-\nTo date, only two other investigations have exam-\nined the phenotypic stability of general and specific\nfactors of psychopathology, with both chronicling\nstrong homotypic continuity but not heterotypic\ncontinuity (Greene & Eaton, 2017; Snyder et al.,\n2016). It must be noted, however, that Greene and\nEaton (2017) utilized an adult sample, for which a\ngreater degree of phenotypic stability would be\nexpected compared with samples of children/ado-\nlescents. Furthermore, both studies assessed psy-\nchopathology at only two time points, with a limited\namount of time between assessments. The present\ninvestigation discerned heterotypic continuity over\nmultiple time points, across a period of significant\ndevelopment. As such, it indicates that processes\nsuch as p-differentiation and/or dynamic mutualism\nare more pronounced earlier in development.\nStrengths and limitations\nA major strength of the present study was the large\ndevelopmental range covered, from very early child-\nhood to midadolescence. Early and middle childhood\nare dynamic periods of the life span, involving\nsignificant biological, cognitive, and social change,\nand it is well-established that psychopathology in\nchildhood is a precursor to mental ill-health in\nadulthood (Kessler et al., 2007).

Second, while the sample used in the present\nstudy was large and diverse, it was not nationally\nrepresentative. Third, due to the computational\ncomplexity of the tested model, the preferred method\nof employing a single longitudinal structural equa-\ntion model was not possible. The implemented `two-\nstep' approach has some weaknesses (e.g., smaller\nstandard errors, biased estimates) (DiStefano, Zhu,\n& Mindrila, 2009). Finally, as previously mentioned,\nthe longitudinal invariance of p was not tested in the\npresent study, meaning p in this case reflected only a\nbroad statistical summary of comorbidity across\ninternalizing, externalizing, and attention problems.\nConclusion\nThe current study highlights the utility of a general\nfactor as a method for capturing psychopathological\ncomorbidity and investigating the role that comor-\nbidity plays in the development of mental illness.\nContrary to prior research, the findings demon-\nstrated that p-differentiation and dynamic mutual-\nism are both plausible mechanisms by which\npsychopathology develops over time. It is possible\nthat there are specific pathways experienced by\ndifferent individuals across development. Further\nstudies implementing both variable-centered and\nperson-centered techniques may be required to\nbetter illuminate these developmental pathways,\ndifferentiate those who experience them, and exam-\nine the outcomes associated with each.\nSupporting information\nAdditional Supporting Information may be found in the\nonline version of this article:\nTable S1.
