Before 12 months of age, infants attribute a valence to actions\nsuch that enabling an agent to achieve its goal is seen to be similar to other positive actions\n(e.g., caressing), while thwarting an agent's progress is grouped with negative actions\n(Premack and Premack, 1997). Infants at this age also prefer agents who have been\nobserved to help another individual over those who have purposefully hindered progress\n(and, indeed, actively avoid the latter), even when the agents themselves are little more\nthan simple objects (e.g., a triangle or square) animated by puppeteers (Hamlin, Wynn, and\nBloom, 2007). Moreover, infants appear to recognize that other individuals--those who\nRemembering helpers and hinderers\nhave been helped or hindered--will prefer those who have aided them in the past\nThus, before we can engage in effective helping or hindering behavior due to\nmotoric and other maturational constraints, humans show sophisticated interpretation of\nthese behaviors. In the present study, we examine whether, by adulthood, our human\ncognitive systems for evaluating and detecting helping and hindering actions also promote\nenhanced memory for the agents involved. That is, while memory for individuals is\nfundamental for social competence, might individuals who engage in helping or hindering\nbehavior be better remembered?\nWhen approaching this question, we can consider the predictions of social contract\ntheory (SCT; e.g., Cosmides and Tooby, 1992). SCT argues that human cognitive\narchitecture is designed to detect cheaters, or those who \"defect\" by taking a benefit\nwithout fulfilling their end of a social contract. That is, cheaters cheat by not reciprocating.\nIn fact, it is argued that this cheater detection system is necessary for cooperation to be an\nevolutionarily stable strategy because it allows for conditional helping (e.g., Cosmides and\nTooby, 1989). More recently, some investigations of the social contract theory have moved\nfrom cheater detection to the hypothesis that people should be good at remembering and\nrecognizing cheaters.\nCheater recognition research, however, has remained equivocal. In Mealey, Daood,\nand Krage (1996), participants had greater memory for the faces of cheaters than faces of\ntrustworthy people. One study has since replicated this effect (Chiappe et al., 2004);\nhowever, the degree to which cheaters had cheated appeared to be greater than the degree\nto which cooperators had cooperated (Barclay and Lalumi\u00e8re, 2006). Additionally, Oda\n(1997) has also replicated Mealey et al.'s (1996) effect, but only when cheaters were male,\nnot when they were female. Because social contract theory cannot explain these sex\ndifferences, results cannot be used to support the theory (Mehl and Buchner, 2008). Other\nstudies have outright failed to replicate Mealey et al.'s findings (see Barclay, 2008, for\nreview); Barclay and Lalumi\u00e8re (2006), for example, controlled for description intensity\nand added \"altruists\" in addition to cheaters, trustworthy, and neutral characters, and found\nno difference in memory across each of these categories.\nIn response to these findings, more recent research has proposed that instances of\nseemingly enhanced cheater recognition in some studies may be the result of assumptions\nregarding the low probability of such individuals in one's environment, coupled with\nmemory systems biased to encode rarity (Barclay, 2008). Indeed, people may do best to\nremember both cooperators and cheaters, as the former would also support preferential\ninteraction with those who will provide benefits (Brown and Moore, 2000).\nThe present study examines the related question of how adults encode the agents\ninvolved in simple helping and hindering behavior (e.g., enabling goals or thwarting them).\nHere, SCT and accompanying \"cheater recognition\" proposals do not directly apply; it is\nunclear whether helping and hindering fit into the theory as originally construed as there is\nno explicit social contract information provided and the events provide no detail regarding\nthe benefits to being a helper or hinderer (only, potentially, benefits to the agent who is\nhelped). One possibility is if people who cheat in social contracts are also those who\nimpulsively impose costs to others (as we might expect among psychopaths, for example),\nthen enhanced ability to remember hinderers, particularly when the behavior is intentional,\nmay have also been adaptive.\nRemembering helpers and hinderers\nPsychopathy and memory for helpers and hinderers\nBarclay and Lalumi\u00e8re (2006) have presented an intriguing hypothesis about\nindividual difference characteristics that might enhance the ability to remember cheaters or\naltruists. They tested whether university students who scored higher on a measure of\npsychopathy (i.e., people with a personality oriented towards cheating) remembered the\nfaces of cheaters better because they are sensitive to the underlying motives or whether\nthey remember altruists better because altruists are exploitable; however, they found no\nsuch relationships in one experiment, and slight enhancement in memory of altruists in a\nsecond experiment. We therefore also wondered if psychopaths, who not only exploit\nothers for personal benefits (i.e., without contributing to the social contract) but also\nimpose costs (consider their crime versatility, impulsivity, irresponsibility, callousness, and\npoor behavioral control), are either more prone to remembering hinderers because they are\nsensitive to psychopathic motives, or are more prone to remember helpers because they are\neasier to exploit.\nAlthough Barclay and Lalumi\u00e8re's process of transforming psychopathy into a\ncategorical variable reduces statistical power to detect significant effects and increases the\nchances of a Type II error (Streiner, 2002), reanalysis of their data yielded the same null\nresults (Barclay, personal communication, November 28, 2009). For comparative purposes,\nwe were interested in using both Barclay and Lalumi\u00e8re's data analytic strategy and also\nthe preferred approach that uses psychopathy in its original continuous form. Also of\nconcern was the use of the Childhood and Adolescent Taxon Scale (CAT-SR; Harris et al.,\n1994; Seto, Khattar, Lalumi\u00e8re, and Quinsey, 1997) to evaluate psychopathy and its fusion\nwith the Levenson Psychopathy Scale (LPS; Levenson, Kiehl, and Fitzpatrick, 1995) to\ncreate a composite measure of psychopathy. Although CAT-SR correlates with measures of\npsychopathy (e.g., Harris, Rice, and Quinsey, 1994), its psychometric properties have yet to\nbe thoroughly investigated. The LPS, on the other hand, has been evaluated for its internal\nconsistency, construct validity, and predictive validity (reviewed in Lilienfeld and Fowler,\n2006). Indeed, Barclay found slightly different correlations with memory for cheaters when\nreanalyzing the data separately for LPS and CAT-SR (personal communication, November\n28, 2009), though such differences did not change the interpretation of their results.\nIntentionality and memory for helpers and hinderers\nThe characterization of others' actions as intentional or unintentional plays an\nimportant role for subsequent behavior evaluation and prediction (e.g., Knobe, 2003). For\nexample, adults assign more blame or praise to intentional actions compared to\nunintentional actions (e.g., Ohtsubo, 2007) and are more likely to retaliate or reciprocate\nwhen harmful or helpful actions are intentional (e.g., Swap, 1991). Even children as young\nas three years of age allocate more responsibility for actions that are considered intentional\n(e.g., Nunez and Harris, 1998), and toddlers younger than 2 years consider an individual's\nprevious intention to provide a desired object when determining whether to help her\nPrevious research has found no difference in memory for agents involved in\nintentional versus accidental actions unrelated to helping and hindering (e.g., a man\npurposefully popping a balloon or a man unintentionally dropping a pen; Fausey and\nBoroditsky, in prep.). Here, however, we examine whether memory for helpers or hinderers\nis affected by whether the agents have intentionally or accidentally engaged in the\nRemembering helpers and hinderers\nbehavior. It is possible, for example, that intentional helping and hindering actions may be\ndifferent from other types of actions such that encoding of the agents involved is enhanced.\nPresent study\nThe purpose of the present study was to test two factors that might influence\nmemory for individuals whose actions either aid (i.e., helpers) or harm (i.e., hinderers)\nanother. In the first set of analyses, we tested whether memory for helpers or hinderers, or\nboth, is enhanced when their actions are intentional, as opposed to unintentional. In the\nsecond set of analyses, we tested whether memory for either of these types of agents was\nenhanced among people with psychopathic traits using alternative statistical methods to\nincrease power.\nGiven concerns raised regarding the stimuli used in previous studies (Barclay and\nkeeping all events similar and removing verbal aspects. We took advantage of unique\nscenarios that have previously been used in studies with infants (e.g., Hamlin et al., 2007;\nKuhlmeier et al., 2003). These movie stimuli consist of simple shapes (\"agents\") that\nengage in helping or hindering another shape in its quest to climb a hill. In this way, we\nequate the length of time to observe the events and the general movement patterns of the\nactions, as well as strip away any facial/emotional elements of the scenarios.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nrecruited from the undergraduate subject pool, participated in this study. Of these\nparticipants, 19 (24%) were men and 61 (76%) were women. All received class credit for\ntheir participation.\nMaterials\nThe Levenson Psychopathy Scale (LPS) (Levenson, Kiehl, and Fitzpatrick, 1995) is\na 26-item self-report questionnaire used to assess participants' antisocial attitudes and\nbehaviors. Its contents are similar to the clinical assessment of psychopathy (Psychopathy\nChecklist-Revised; Hare, 1991), and it is appropriate to use with university students. Each\nitem is scored from 1 (disagree strongly) to 4 (agree strongly). Higher scores indicate a\nhigher number of psychopathic tendencies. LPS scores for the sample ranged from 34.00 to\nThe Childhood and Adolescent Taxon Scale (CAT-SR) is an 8-item, self-report\nquestionnaire that measures early behavioral problems associated with adult psychopathy\n(Harris et al., 1994; Seto, Khattar, Lalumi\u00e8re, and Quinsey, 1997). Each item is scored as 0\n(absent), 1 (some indication), or 2 (present); all 8 items are averaged for an overall score.\nStimuli and Procedure. Videos were created using computer-animation software\n(Maya Unlimited 6.5, Alias Systems Corporation, 2005). These videos were presented to\nparticipants on a 61 cm computer monitor via MediaLab presentation software. Participants\nsat approximately 50 cm away from the computer, facing the monitor. Each participant was\nrandomly assigned into one of two conditions, Intentional or Unintentional.\nRemembering helpers and hinderers\nDuring the familiarization phase, participants in the Intentional condition were\nshown four Intentional Help movies and four Intentional Hinder movies (Figure 1), and\nparticipants in the Unintentional condition were shown four Unintentional Help movies and\nfour Unintentional Hinder movies (Figure 2)1\nThe Help and Hinder movies in both conditions began with a red ball climbing the\nfirst of two hills. After it reached the top of this small hill, it stopped and expanded and\ncontracted (as if excited) before continuing up the next, bigger hill. However, it had\ndifficulty climbing this hill and thus, when halfway up it slid back down to the base. The\nball tried to climb this hill again but as before, had difficulty and started to slide back\ndown. At this moment, the events differed depending on the behavior type (help vs. hinder)\nand condition (intentional vs. unintentional).\n, in pseudorandom order. All movies, based\non earlier infant work (e.g., Kuhlmeier, Wynn, and Bloom, 2003; Premack and Premack,\n1997), were 8 seconds long and set on a white background. The animated agents in the\nevents were a triangle (varying in color with each video) and a red dome-shaped object\n(hereafter, \"ball\"). In each condition (Intentional and Unintentional), half of the participants\nobserved one set of colors for the triangles, and the other half saw a different set of colors.\nA black screen was interspersed between each familiarization video.\nIn the Intentional Help video, a triangle moved down from its location at the top of\nthe screen and helped the ball by pushing it up the bigger hill. When the ball reached the\ntop of this hill, it expanded and contracted. In the Intentional Hinder video, a triangle\nmoved down from its location at the top of the screen and hindered the ball by pushing it\ndown the bigger hill. Due to momentum of the push, the ball slid all the way down to the\nbase of the first hill.\nIn the Unintentional Help video, the stand on which the triangle was sitting tipped,\ncausing it to bounce off a hexagon-shaped barrier and accidentally hit the ball from behind,\nin turn helping it up the hill. When the ball reached the top of this hill, it expanded and\ncontracted. In the Unintentional Hinder video, the stand on which the triangle was sitting\ntipped, this time causing it to bounce off the barrier and accidentally hit the ball in the\nfront, thus hindering it from going up the hill. Due to the momentum of the push, the ball\nslid all the way down to the base of the first hill.\nThe four movies were equated on various parameters. The length of each movie was\n8 seconds. Contact between the triangle and the ball occurred at the same frame across all\nmovies, and duration of contact time was identical. Further, the amount and duration of\nmotion of the triangle was the same in all events.\nFollowing these movies and completion of the LPS and CAT-SR, the memory test\nscreens showed 16 triangles (8 previously-viewed colors, 8 new colors; Table 1) in random\norder, one at a time. A recognition question for the color of the triangle was presented (\"Do\nyou remember this shape from the previous videos?\"), and participants had the choice of\nselecting `Yes' or `No'. Memory was measured by calculating the number of correct\ntriangles remembered, with higher scores indicating better memory.\n1 Early pilot testing was undertaken to ensure that the movies indeed were seen to depict intentional and\nunintentional helping and hindering events. Ten out of 10 adult viewers watched the events and provided\nwritten descriptions that fit this interpretation (e.g., the intentional triangles were said to \"want to push the\nball\" while the unintentional triangles were described as \"slipping\" or \"falling\").\nRemembering helpers and hinderers\nFigure 1. Five still frames taken from one of the Intentional Help and one of the Intentional\nHinder movies. The color (identity) of the triangle differed in each of the four Help and\nfour Hinder movies.\nRemembering helpers and hinderers\nFigure 2.

We first replicated Barclay and Lalumi\u00e8re's\nprocedure for calculating psychopathy scores by standardizing LPS and CAT-SR within\neach sex, taking the averages, and then trichotomizing scores within each sex. To ensure\nresults were not due to combining these measures (since psychometric properties of this\ncombined measure have not been evaluated, and the psychometrics of CAT-SR is limited)\nor due to a lack of power when categorizing a continuous variable, we tested whether\npsychopathy was related to memory for helpers or hinderers using the original scales and\nthe continuous version of psychopathy with correlation and regression methods.\nResults\nMemory for actors: Intentional versus unintentional actions\nA mixed-model analysis of variance was conducted to investigate whether memory\nfor the triangle actors varied with intentionality (between: intentional vs. unintentional),\nbehavior type (within: help vs. hinder), or an interaction between them. Intentionality had a\nsignificant main effect on the number of triangles remembered, F (1, 78) = 6.34, p = .014,\nsignificantly better than that of the participants in the unintentional condition (M = 5.20, SD\np = .33, partial 2 = .012; hinderers were not remembered any better than helpers or vice\nRemembering helpers and hinderers\nversa (Figure 4). The interaction between intentionality and behavior type was also not\nintentionality on the number of triangles remembered does not depend on the actions that\nthe triangles are engaged in. Additionally, although intentionality influenced memory,\nFigure 3. Mean and SE bars of memory for intentional and unintentional triangle actors.\nDashed line indicates chance responding.\nFigure 4.

Because of these sex differences, all subsequent analyses used\nstandardized scores of psychopathy within each sex.\nUsing a 2 x 3 x 2 mixed model ANOVA on memory scores (between: psychopathy\nand sex; within: behavior type), we found no main effect for psychopathy, F (2, 74) = 2.35,\nthe interactions were significant, ps > .31. With the exception of sex, our results replicated\nBarclay and Lalumi\u00e8re's findings.\nTo ensure these null findings were not due to a lack of power from categorizing\npsychopathy (see Streiner, 2002), we used multivariate regression to test for a linear\nrelationship between psychopathy and memory for helpers and hinderers. Though\npsychopathy did not predict a linear combination of memory for helpers and hinderers, F\nprediction of memory for helpers approached significance, F (1, 78) = 3.58, p = .06.\nBecause the psychometric properties of a composite psychopathy measure are\nunknown, and because CAT-SR and LPS were not correlated among women3\nDiscussion\n, we reran the\nmultivariate regression using LPS and CAT-SR as independent predictors. CAT-SR did not\npredict a linear combination of memory for helpers and hinderers, F (2, 76) = .131, p = .88,\nnor did it predict memory for helpers, F (2, 76) = 0.13, p = .88. Interestingly, the\nrelationship between LPS and a combination of helpers and hinderers approached\nsignificance, F (2, 76) = 3.02, p = .06. Further examination found a significant relationship\nbetween LPS and memory for helpers, F (1, 77) = 4.46, p = .04, but not for hinderers, F (1,\n77) = 2.54, p = .12. Similarly, Pearson correlation coefficients found a significant\nrelationship between LPS and memory for helpers, r (78) = .25, p = .03, and no relationship\nbetween LPS and memory for hinderers, r (78) = .17, p = .13. Using Fisher's r-to-z\ntransformation, however, we found that these correlations were not significantly different, z\nAcross our sample, we found no evidence for a difference in memory for agents\nwho previously helped and agents who previously hindered a third party, consistent with a\ngrowing body of research suggesting that enhanced memory for either cheaters or hinderers\nover altruists or helpers (or vice versa), if existent, is subtle (e.g., Barclay and Lalumi\u00e8re,\n2006; Mehl and Buchner, 2008). However, the novel procedures of the present study\nallowed us to explore factors that may influence encoding and memory for helpers and\nhinderers: the intention of the action and individual differences in psychopathy\ncharacteristics. Each will be discussed in turn.\n3 This was found in the present study and that of Barclay and Lalumi\u00e8re (2006).\nRemembering helpers and hinderers\nThe intentionality of helping and hindering actions affected later memory of the\nagents (i.e., the triangles). Although in both the Intentional and Unintentional conditions\nthe goal of the third party (i.e., the ball) was ultimately aided or thwarted, memory for the\nhelpers and hinderers was enhanced when their actions were intentional. Remembering\npeople who intentionally help or harm others may be adaptive because their actions reflect\ntrue goals and allow predictions of future actions (Malle and Knobe, 1997). Indeed, an\nimportant consideration is that this effect is not confounded with other factors (e.g., the\ngoal of the ball and its final end states remain consistent, all physical features of the\ncharacters remain identical, the duration of contact between characters is equal), and the\nonly difference between the movies in the two conditions was the intention of the agents to\nhelp or hinder.\nWe may also consider the processes that drove the enhanced recognition of the\nintentional helpers and hinderers. Our preferred interpretation is that participants encoded\nand remembered these agents more because they were intentional helpers and hinderers, yet\nalternatively it is possible that enhanced memory was observed because these were\nintentional objects acting volitionally on the screen that simply engendered more interest,\nregardless of their actions. To be clear, it is unlikely that participants in the Unintentional\ncondition simply did not pay enough attention to the unintentional agents as memory for\nthese agents was also above chance level. Additionally, recent research has found no\ndifference in memory for human actors involved in intentional versus accidental actions\nunrelated to helping and hindering (Fausey and Boroditsky, in prep.), suggesting that our\nresults may be specific to these particular intentional behaviors. Further, under the\nalternative explanation, one would not predict individual differences in memory for helpers\nor hinderers in the present study, an effect found when individual tendencies in terms of\npsychopathy were considered.\nIt is possible, though, that neutral, yet intentional, actions would also lead to\nenhanced memory of agents when compared to the Unintentional condition. This is an\nempirical question4\nWhen using the LPS, a self-report psychopathy measure with known psychometric\nproperties (Lilienfeld and Fowler, 2006), in its continuous form, we found that psychopathy\nwas related to memory for helpers, not hinderers. Psychopaths are social predators who\nmanipulate and exploit others without regret for any harm that may have been caused, and\nmay therefore be predisposed to attend to and remember people who are exploitable.\nPeople who help, cooperate, and are altruistic are more exploitable than people who do not\nhave these characteristics. Whether this trait represents an adaptive psychological module\n, yet there is good reason to think that it is, in fact, the act of\nintentionally helping and hindering that is leading to improved memory for the agents in\nthis paradigm. For example, Hamlin and colleagues (Hamlin, Wynn, and Bloom, 2007)\nfound that infants under one year of age engaged in social evaluation of agents who\nintentionally helped or hindered but not intentional agents who engaged in neutrally\nvalenced actions. This suggests that even at this early age, helpers and hinderers are being\nencoded in a manner strong enough to allow for subsequent adaptive behavior (e.g.,\nshowing a preference for a helper).\nThe animated events in the present procedure do not allow for compelling presentation of actions that are\nperceived as truly neutral in relation to the hill-climber if other parameters are to be kept identical among\nconditions.\nRemembering helpers and hinderers\nfor remembering helpers as part of an obligate life-history strategy specific to psychopaths\nremains to be tested, especially because Barclay and Lalumi\u00e8re did not find a relationship\nbetween psychopathy and memory for altruists. Our failure to find a relationship between\npsychopathy and memory appeared to be driven by categorizing a continuous measure of\npsychopathy and using an unvalidated composite measure of psychopathy. This procedure,\nhowever, does not account for the differences between our study and Barclay and\nLalumi\u00e8re's study. One possible explanation for these differences is that viewing\nbehavioral cues in our study could be more salient and ecologically valid than reading\nscripted cues.\nA limitation in our study, and in all relevant studies that use self-report measures of\npsychopathy, is that few, if any, participants were true psychopaths. A more direct way to\ntest the hypothesis for enhanced memory of altruists among psychopaths while overcoming\nsetbacks of these self-report measures is to assess a forensic sample using the clinical\nmeasure of psychopathy, the Psychopathy Checklist, Revised (Hare, 2003). If the helper\nand/or hinderer detection among psychopaths hypothesis is true, we expect larger and more\nrobust effects in studies that includes clinical psychopaths. Until such studies are\nconducted, we remain cautious in interpreting the effects of psychopathy on memory for\nhelpers.\nIn sum, individual differences in proneness towards granting benefits or imposing\ncosts may have led to cognitive processes that allow enhanced encoding of individuals who\nintentionally help and hinder. Indeed, differential memory for hinderers over helpers, or\nvice versa, may not be a robust general effect across samples. Instead, certain individual\ncharacteristics might result in heightened memory for one over the other.\n"
