Bell,3 and Frank Sorvillo1,2\nThe disease burden and mortality from hepatitis C are predicted to increase in the United States\nas the number of persons with long-standing chronic infection grows. We analyzed hepatitis C\nmortality rates derived from US Census and multiple-cause-of-death data for 1995-2004. Deaths\nwere considered hepatitis C\u00adrelated if: (1) hepatitis C was the underlying cause of death, (2)\nchronic liver disease was the underlying cause and hepatitis C was a contributing cause, or (3)\nhuman immunodeficiency virus was the underlying cause and chronic liver disease and hepatitis\nC were contributing causes. A total of 56,409 hepatitis C\u00adrelated deaths were identified. Mor-\namong persons aged 55-64 years. Overall increases were greater among males (144%) than\nfemales (81%) and among non-Hispanic blacks (170%) and Native Americans (241%) com-\npanics, non-Hispanic blacks, and non-Hispanic Native American/Alaska Natives. Conclusion:\nOverall, hepatitis C mortality has increased substantially since 1995. Despite small declines in\nrecent years, rates have continued to increase among persons aged 55-64 years. Hepatitis C is an\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most\ncommon blood-borne infection in the United\nStates, with an estimated 1.3% of the general\nUS population chronically infected.1 About 10%-20%\nof chronically infected persons will develop liver cir-\nrhosis and 1%-5% will develop hepatocellular carci-\nreport, chronic HCV infection was shown to be the\nleading indication for liver transplantation in the\nUnited States.3\nAlcohol use, age at infection, duration of HCV infec-\ntion, and male sex are all associated with progression of\nliver fibrosis, development of cirrhosis, and subsequent\nmortality among persons with chronic HCV infection.4,5\nCoinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\nis also an important prognostic factor influencing the\ncourse of HCV infection6 and occurs commonly among\npersons infected with HCV due to injection drug use and\nother shared modes of transmission.

Using US death\nrecord data, Vong and Bell found that 4,443 deaths\nage-adjusted mortality rates since 1993, although these\nnumbers were considered to be an underestimate.12 In\naddition, these data are now nearly a decade old, a time\nperiod in which large increases in hepatitis C\u00adrelated\nmortality were expected.\nWe examined United States multiple-cause-of-death\ncurrent, population-based estimates of trends and demo-\ngraphic differences in hepatitis C\u00adrelated mortality utiliz-\ning a broader case definition than has been employed in\nprevious population-based studies of hepatitis C\u00adrelated\nmortality.\nPatients and Methods\nWe obtained MCOD data from the National Center\nfor Health Statistics for deaths due to hepatitis C\u00adrelated\nsiding in the United States. Data from this period were\nused because 2004 is the most recent data year available\nand HCV testing and diagnostic practices did not begin\nto stabilize until 1995. State and local laws require that\ndeath certificates be completed for all deaths, with funeral\ndirectors or hospitals required to collect demographic in-\nformation on decedents and physicians or medical exam-\niners required to complete information on the condition\nor conditions leading to death. The 2003 Standard US\nDeath Certificate, upon which each state's death certifi-\ncate is based, has two sections for cause-of-death informa-\ntion.13 Part I includes information on the conditions\ninvolved in the causal chain of events leading to death.\nThis includes the \"underlying cause of death\", the \"im-\nmediate cause of death\", and any conditions causally link-\ning the underlying and immediate causes of death. The\nunderlying cause of death is typically used to compile\ntraditional mortality statistics and is defined as \"the dis-\nease or injury that initiated the train of events leading\ndirectly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or\nviolence, which produced the fatal injury\".14 Part II in-\ncludes information on other \"significant conditions con-\ntributing to death but not resulting in the underlying\ncause given in Part I.\"\nMCOD files incorporate the information from Parts\nI and II of the death certificate using three schemes: the\nentity axis, the record axis, and the underlying cause of\ndeath. The entity axis contains every condition re-\ncorded in Parts I and II of the death certificate. These\ndata are not cleaned, processed, or recoded and repre-\nsent a direct transcription of each disease entity listed\non the death certificate to the MCOD data file. The\nrecord axis represents a cleaned version of the entity\naxis in which redundant conditions are eliminated, re-\nlated conditions may be combined for coding effi-\nciency, and causes violating certain logical checks are\ndeleted.14 The underlying cause of death is a single\nvariable separate from both the entity and record axes,\nwhich typically contains the underlying cause of death\nas recorded in Part I of the death certificate, but may\ncontain a derived value based on selection and modifi-\ncation rules designed to improve the usefulness of un-\nderlying cause mortality statistics.14 For the purposes\nof the current study, any condition captured in the\nMCOD data not classified as the underlying cause of\ndeath was considered a contributing cause of death.\nMedical conditions recorded in MCOD data from\nnational Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9)\naccordance with the International Classification of Dis-\nFor this study, a hepatitis C\u00adrelated death was defined\nin one of three ways. First, any death with hepatitis C as\nthe underlying cause of death was included (ICD-9 codes\nSecond, any death with chronic liver disease as the under-\nlying cause (primary liver cancer, esophageal varices, alco-\nholic liver disease, hepatic failure, chronic hepatitis, liver\ncirrhosis/fibrosis, portal hypertension, or hepatorenal\nsyndrome) and hepatitis C as a contributing cause in the\nrecord axis was included. Third, any death with HIV/\nacquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (ICD-9\nunderlying cause, chronic liver disease as a contributing\ncause in the record axis, and hepatitis C as a contributing\ncause in either the record or entity axis was included. This\nthird definition was employed to ensure that HIV/HCV\ncoinfected persons with evidence of liver disease were not\nexcluded due to the frequent assignment of HIV as the\nunderlying cause of death when HIV is listed on the death\ncertificate.\nTo calculate mortality rates, we obtained bridged pop-\nulation estimates from the United States Census Bureau\ncalculated as well as 95% confidence intervals. Age-ad-\njusted rates were standardized to the age distribution of\nthe year 2000 United States population. Variance esti-\nmates for rates were calculated based on a Poisson distri-\nbution. Information on age, sex, race, ethnicity, and year\nof death was also obtained from the MCOD data. A single\nrace/ethnicity variable was created in which any decedent\nlisting Hispanic ethnicity was considered Hispanic, with\nall remaining non-Hispanic deaths categorized according\nto the race groups white, black, Asian/Pacific Islander,\nand Native American/Alaska Native. Linear plots through\nannual age-adjusted mortality rates were used to quantify\nrate changes over time. The appropriateness of using a\nlinear model was assessed by visual inspections of the plots\nas well as calculation of R-squared values. Although\namong a small number of subgroups annual age-adjusted\nrates did appear to deviate from the plots, linear methods\nperformed better than the use of Poisson exponential rate\nmodels. Years of potential life lost (YPLL) were calculated\nby subtracting decedents' ages at death from 75 for all\ndeaths occurring before age 75 and summing the individ-\nual years of life lost across all decedents. Although numer-\nous methods have been outlined in the literature for\ncalculation of YPLL,18 we used a single age cutoff of 75\nyears for all groups in order to be consistent with YPLL\ndata obtained on other infectious causes of death from the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention's Web-based\nInjury Statistics Query and Reporting System.19 We ana-\nlyzed and tabulated data with SAS, version 9.1 (SAS In-\nstitute Inc., Cary, NC) and Excel 2002 (Microsoft Corp.,\nRedmond, WA).\nResults\n84,078 deaths mentioned hepatitis C somewhere on the\none of the three criteria for inclusion in the study.

Among the 19,198 decedents in-\ncluded in the study not listing hepatitis C as the underly-\ning cause of death, 39.8% listed liver cancer as the\nunderlying cause, 31.8% listed alcoholic liver disease,\n15.1% listed fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver, 12.2% listed\nHIV/AIDS, and 1.1% listed other underlying causes.\nFour deaths were excluded from rate calculations due to\nmissing information on age.\nAge-adjusted hepatitis C\u00adrelated mortality rates in-\ncreased substantially during the study period, rising from\n(Fig. 1, Table 1). Although mortality rates from hepatitis\nC\u00adrelated disease increased considerably during 1995-\n2004 for men and women, rates in men did so more\nrapidly, increasing by an average of 0.26 deaths per\nage-specific increases during the study period were ob-\nserved among persons 45-54 years of age and persons\nwhich peak age-specific mortality rates were seen shifted\nrace/ethnicity-specific mortality rates also increased over\nthe study period for all groups, with the most rapid in-\ncreases among non-Hispanic blacks and Native Ameri-\ncans/Alaska Natives (Fig. 3, Table 1).

Overall,\n83.8% of deaths had evidence of chronic liver disease in\naddition to HCV infection, including 43.5% with cirrho-\nsis or fibrosis of the liver, 31.6% with hepatic failure, and\n18.3% with primary liver cancer. Alcohol-related condi-\ntions were also prominent among hepatitis C\u00adrelated\ndeaths, with 20.0% including mention of alcoholic liver\ndisease, alcohol dependence syndrome, or harmful use of\nalcohol as either the underlying or a contributing cause of\ndeath.

Ac-\ncording to the analysis of YPLL, hepatitis C\u00adrelated dis-\nease was the 16th leading cause of premature death in the\nUnited States in 2004, and the fourth leading infectious\nOverall Female Male\nFig. 1.

As such, true\nincreases in hepatitis C\u00adrelated mortality during 1995-\n1999 were likely more gradual than the observed trends,\nand differences in mortality patterns between the time\nperiods are difficult to interpret.\nMortality rates generally increased over the 10-year\nstudy period, with a small decline in overall mortality\nrates observed in the final 2 years of the study. The decline\nin mortality during these final years appears to be driven\nby decreases in mortality among persons age 65 and over\nas well as persons age 35-44. Decreasing rates among per-\nsons 35-44 years of age may be due to the fact that the\nbirth cohorts with the highest prevalence of infection\nmoved beyond this age range during the study, whereas\nthe reasons for decreases in persons age 65 are not clear.\nRates among persons age 45-54 leveled in the last 2 years\nof the study, whereas rates among persons age 55-64 con-\ntinued a strong upward trend. Decedents age 55-64 com-\nprised a growing proportion of persons in the high\nperiod, explaining the continued rise in mortality rates in\nthis group.\nDue to the predicted rise in the prevalence of persons\nmodels have forecast overall hepatitis C\u00adrelated mortality\nto continue to increase over the next decade.11 Beyond the\ncohort effects described above, the reasons for the small\ndecline observed in overall mortality rates, if sustained, are\nnot clear. Improvements in survival because of advances\nin treatment and liver transplantation could delay or pre-\nvent some of the anticipated hepatitis C\u00adrelated mortal-\nity. Alternatively, the variable course of chronic HCV\ninfection, reflected imprecisely in mathematical models of\nhepatitis C natural history, might result in mortality\ncurves that diverge from predicted trends. It will be nec-\nessary to continue to monitor hepatitis C\u00adrelated mortal-\nity over time to determine whether the small recent\ndecline represents the beginning of a trend or a temporary\nfluctuation.\nAlcohol consumption is an important cofactor in\nchronic liver disease progression among HCV-infected\npersons,4,20,21 and alcohol-related conditions were ob-\nserved frequently among hepatitis C\u00adrelated deaths. Fur-\nthermore, the frequency of alcohol-related conditions\nderived from death certificate data is likely an underesti-\nmate, as it has been documented that alcohol dependence\nand abuse are underreported on death certificates.22 This\nfinding highlights the importance of existing recommen-\ndations that patients with chronic HCV infection should\nnot consume alcohol and of identifying more effective\nways to reduce excessive alcohol consumption.23 HIV in-\nTable 1.

Persons\ninfected with HCV should also be counseled on methods\nto avoid HIV infection, if not already infected.\nDemographic disparities in mortality were also largely\nconsistent with observed differences in infection preva-\nlence across subgroups. Non-Hispanic blacks, males, and\npersons aged 40-49 were observed to have higher preva-\nlence of antibodies to HCV in the most recent analysis of\ndata from the National Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey (NHANES) and also were observed to have\nhigh mortality rates in the current study.1 This consis-\ntency suggests that much of the difference in mortality\nrates across demographic groups is simply a function of\ndifferences in infection prevalence, although differences\nin the occurrence of prognostic factors influencing case-\nfatality may have an effect as well. Mexican Americans\nhad low infection prevalence, similar to that of non-His-\npanic whites, in NHANES,1 but Hispanics were observed\nto have high mortality rates in the current study. This\ndiscrepancy could be explained by higher case-fatality\namong Hispanics infected with HCV, perhaps related to\ndifferences in the occurrence of comorbidities. It could\nalso be accounted for, however, by the NHANES sam-\npling frame not allowing for analysis of infection preva-\nlence among all Hispanics. If non-Mexican Hispanics\nhave high HCV infection prevalence, it would be possible\nfor prevalence of HCV infection among all Hispanics to\nbe similar to that of non-Hispanic blacks.\nDeath certificate data have a number of well-known\nlimitations, one of which is the potential misclassification\nof causes of death on the death certificate. It is possible\ndeaths were incorrectly classified as hepatitis C\u00adrelated\ndue to improper recording of causes of death on the death\ncertificate, mistakes in coding the death certificate data,\nincorrect diagnosis of HCV infection, as well as errors\nintroduced by the case definition employed. Further-\nmore, HCV infection may have been under-ascertained\nbecause its asymptomatic nature and long latent period\ncould lead to a failure of diagnosis among individuals in\nwhom it contributed substantially to death. Race and eth-\nnicity are also sometimes misclassified on death certifi-\ncates.24 This issue is compounded by errors in Census\nBureau population estimates due to Census undercounts\nand unmet model assumptions for intercensal estimates\nand postcensus projections.25 Errors in demographic in-\nformation on both death certificates and population data\nlead to distortions in rate estimates and may bias mortality\nrate comparisons made between demographic groups.\nPrevious research by Wu et al. using capture-recapture\ntechniques with multiple-cause-of-death data and New\nYork State hospital discharge data support the hypothesis\nthat available data sources may substantially underesti-\nmate the true number of hepatitis C\u00adrelated deaths.26\nDeath certificates mentioning hepatitis C as either the\nunderlying cause of death or as a contributing cause of\ndeath were compared to medical records with hepatitis C\nlisted as a discharge diagnosis, as a part of the patient's\nhistory, or as a positive laboratory test. Using MCOD\ndata alone would have only captured 18% of the total\nnumber of estimated deaths.26 Another study utilizing\nKaiser Permanente Medical Care Program data for 2000\nalso found hepatitis C to be underreported on death cer-\ntificates. Only 64% of deaths attributed to hepatitis C in\nthe Kaiser database listed hepatitis C as a cause of death on\nthe corresponding death certificate.27 Applying results of\nthese validation studies to data from 2004 suggests that\noccurred, consistent with other published estimates.2\nAn important but infrequently recognized complexity\nin the analysis of MCOD data pertains to the translation\nof entity axis codes to record axis codes and may result in\nan underestimation of cause-specific mortality. Although\nHIV and hepatitis C are often both listed in the entity\naxis, they are frequently combined into a single code for\nHIV disease in the record axis. For example, it is possible\nfor ICD-10 codes K74.6 (other and unspecified cirrhosis\nof liver), B24 (unspecified HIV disease), and B18.2\n(chronic viral hepatitis C) to be listed separately in the\nentity axis. After processing and translating the entity axis\ncodes, the record axis may only contain B20.3 (HIV dis-\nease resulting in other viral infections) and K74.6, with\nB20.3 listed as the underlying cause of death. This phe-\nnomenon could have lead to the exclusion of numerous\ndeaths strongly related to hepatitis C if ICD codes in the\nentity axis had not been taken into account.\nIn summary, substantial increases in overall hepatitis\nC\u00adrelated mortality rates have occurred since 1995. De-\nspite small declines in overall mortality in the last 2 years\nof the study, rates have continued to increase among per-\nsons aged 55-64 years. Currently, the vast majority of\nmortality from hepatitis C\u00adrelated disease is occurring in\npersons under the age of 60 years, especially men. The\nrelatively young age of persons dying from hepatitis C\u00adre-\nlated liver disease has made hepatitis C\u00adrelated disease a\nleading infectious cause of years of potential life lost as\nwell as an important cause of premature mortality overall.\nDespite recent declines in hepatitis C incidence, primary\nprevention of new HCV infections will continue to be\nimportant in limiting the future burden of chronic liver\ndisease mortality in the United States. These results also\nhighlight the need for measures to prevent progression of\nchronic liver disease among persons already infected with\nHCV and the importance of ongoing analysis of mortality\ntrends.\n"
