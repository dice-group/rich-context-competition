The NSFG is a multistage probability sample designed to represent\nthe household population of USA women and men aged 15\u00ad45. The\nsurvey is conducted to produce nationally representative data. In each\nhousehold, one member within the required age range was randomly\nselected for recruitment. Certain groups, including black and Hispanic\nadults, were sampled at higher rates to achieve adequate samples for gen-\nerating nationally representative point estimates and power to examine\ndifferences between racial and ethnic groups. All subjects provided\nwritten consent for participation. The survey was available in both\nEnglish and Spanish. The overall response rate for the survey was 79%\n(Mosher et al., 2005). Institutional Review Board approval was not\nrequired for this secondary analysis of a de-identified national data set.\nDescription of variables\nOutcome\nThe diagnosis of infertility was assessed with several questions adminis-\ntered in the NSFG. Women were asked: `During any of your relationships,\nhave you or your (husband or) partner at the time ever been to a doctor\nor other medical care provider to talk about ways to help you become\npregnant?' Infertility was coded as a dichotomous variable (yes/no).\nAmong those reporting the utilization of infertility care, duration of infer-\ntility was determined by asking the follow-up question: `When you first\nwent for medical help, how many months or years had you [and your\n(husband/partner)] been trying to become pregnant?' In addition, the\npast infertility diagnosis was assessed by asking women who had sought\ninfertility care, `when you went for medical help to (become pregnant/\nprevent miscarriage/to become pregnant and prevent miscarriage), were\nyou ever told that you or your husband or partner had any of the following\ninfertility problems: [p]roblems with ovulation, [b]locked tubes, [o]ther\ntube or pelvic problems, [e]ndometriosis, [s]emen or sperm problems\nor [a]ny other infertility problems.' Women who answered they had pro-\nblems with ovulation, fallopian tubes or endometriosis were coded as\nhaving female infertility. Those who answered sperm problems were\ncoded as having male factor infertility. Multiple diagnoses were not per-\nmitted on the survey. In each case, those with male or female factor\nwere compared with all those without each respective factor in each\nanalysis.\nNon-pregnant and non-surgically sterile women were also asked: `Some\nwomen are not physically able to have children. As far as you know, is it\nphysically possible for you, yourself, to have (a/another) baby?' In addition,\nwomen currently in a relationship were asked about the reproductive abil-\nities of their non-surgically sterile partners. `What about [husband/\npartner]? As far as you know, is it physically possible for him to father a\nbaby in the future?' Both responses, which represent current difficulties,\nwere coded as dichotomous variables (yes/no).\nFor men, surveyors asked, `Did you or your wife ever go/Have you or\nyour wife ever been/During any of your relationships, have you or your\n(wife or) partner at the time ever been to a doctor or other medical\ncare provider to talk about ways to help you have a baby together?' Non-\nsurgically sterile men were also asked `Some men are not physically able to\nfather children. As far as you know, is it physically possible for you, yourself\nto biologically father a child in the future?' Those that responded affirma-\ntively, were then asked, `Some men are physically able to father a child, but\nwould have difficulty doing so. As far as you know, would you have any\ndifficulty fathering a child?' Both variables, which represent current difficul-\nties, were coded dichotomously (yes/no). Infertility duration or diagnostic\nspecifics were not available from the male sample of the NSFG.\nGiven that many childless respondents had not actively pursued pro-\ncreation and reproductive intent can be difficult to ascertain, only survey\nrespondents with at least one child were included in the present fertile\nsample.\nExposure\nDemographic, socioeconomic and anthropomorphic characteristics were\nanalyzed to assess associations with fertility. Potential mediating and con-\nfounding variables were selected a priori. Variables were selected based on\nitems in the literature found to be associated with infertility. Variables ana-\nlyzed included age at birth of first child (continuous), age (continuous),\nnumber of siblings (continuous), current marital status (dichotomous--\nyes/no), self-reported race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, other), edu-\ncational attainment (categorical--less than high school, high school/GED,\nmore than high school) and income level (categorical--,$24 999,\nData analysis\nWe developed our multivariate model to assess the relationship between\nthe diagnosis of infertility and family size. We did not select predictors for\ninclusion based on bivariable screening as important confounding can\npotentially be missed using this methodology (Sun et al., 1996). Logistic\nregression models were utilized to determine the relationship between\ninfertility and having more than one child (one child versus two or more\nchildren) or more than two children (one to two children versus three\nor more children). Ordinal logistic models were used to assess the associ-\nation between infertility and having a larger family size (one versus two\nversus three or more children). Comparisons between total offspring\nnumbers were assessed using x2 tests after categorizing total offspring\nnumbers (1, 2, 3+). All analyses accounted for the complex survey\ndesign of the NSFG. All tests were two-sided, and a P-value of 0.05\nwas considered statistically significant. All calculations were performed\nusing Stata 10 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).\nResults\nFrom the female sample, a total of 4409 participants met inclusion cri-\nfrom the male sample were included, of whom 9.7% were classified as\ninfertile. Infertility was defined on the basis of having sought reproduc-\ntive assistance or advice. Sociodemographic characteristics of female\nNSFG respondents with at least one child are listed in Table I.\nWomen who reported seeking medical attention for fertility tended\nto be older, white, more educated and higher earners than fertile\nwomen. Infertile women were more likely to report a history of mar-\nriage than fertile women (97.6% versus 80.4%, respectively). Infertile\nsample, 348 (11.2%) women reported their own difficulty having chil-\ndren and 34 (2.4%) women reported that their husbands/partners\nhad difficulty siring offspring.\nCharacteristics of male NSFG respondents meeting inclusion criteria\nare listed in Table II. Similar to female respondents, infertile males\nwere more often older, white, college educated and higher earners.\nInfertile males were also more likely to have a history of marriage\n(96.6% versus 83.5%, respectively). Infertile men had fewer siblings\nthey could not father a child or it would be difficult to do so.\nUsing several measures of infertility, women who reported seeking\ninfertility advice or confirmed difficulty conceiving reported fewer\nInfertility and family size in the USA 2361\noffspring. Similarly, women who reported that their husband/partner\nwould have difficulty fathering a child had fewer children (Table III).\nMen who reported seeking reproductive advice and those who\ncould not father, or had difficulty in fathering, offspring also reported\nlower offspring numbers (Table III).\nA multivariable logistic regression model to assess the association\nbetween the outcome of having more than one child, having more\nthan two children and having a larger family size (one versus two\nversus three or more children) and infertility was examined\n(Table IV). Within the female sample, seeking reproductive assistance\nreduced the odds of having an additional child (OR 0.66, 95% CI\n0.48\u00ad0.90). In addition, the point estimates suggest that seeking\nreproductive advice reduces the odds of having more than two chil-\ndren or a larger family, although those models did not reach statistical\nsignificance. The odds of having a larger family and the odds of having a\nsecond child are reduced for every additional 6 months of infertility\nively). Interestingly, a diagnosis of male infertility reduces the odds of\nnosis of female infertility reduced the odds to a lesser degree (OR\nfactor infertility into the same model did not significantly impact the\nodds ratios for any assessment of family size. As a further analysis,\nwe directly compared women from couples with male factor infertility\nto those with female factor infertility and found that women from\ncouples with male factor infertility reported significantly lower odds\n2.19) also suggested smaller family sizes for those with male versus\nfemale factor infertility, these tests did not reach statistical significance.\nWomen who reported their own difficulty having children as well as\ndifficulty for their husband/partner to father offspring had reduced\nodds of having a larger family size (Table IV). Again, combining both\nmale factor and female factor infertility into the same model did not\nsignificantly impact the odds ratios.\nThe male sample of the NSFG showed similar results. Men who\nsought reproductive advice or reported difficulty or futility in siring off-\nspring had a lower odds of a larger family size (Table IV).\nDiscussion\nThe current study corroborates past analysis of European data (Joffe\net al., 2009) in the USA establishing that time to pregnancy (TTP)\naffects family size. In addition to evaluating TTP, the NSFG allowed\nthe analysis of the impact of an infertility evaluation.

Given the impact that the definition\nof infertility can have on such analyses (Guzick and Swan, 2006), inferti-\nlity wasassessed in multiplewayswith similar results. In addition, the cur-\nrent report is the first, to our knowledge, to suggest that male factor\ninfertility may have a larger impact on family size than female factor.\nMany factors contribute to ultimate family size. Parental age at first\nconception, income, education and relationship status are known to\nand Slama, 2008). Although it is well established that family size is at\nleast partially determined by sociodemographic factors, recent evidence\nsuggests that biologic causes may also be at play. Despite a possible\nworldwide decline in semen quality, the contribution of such biologic\nfactors on final family size can be hard to determine, especially with\nthe increased use of fertility treatments (Sallmen et al., 2005). Joffe\net al. (2009) recently reported an association between biologic fertility\nand familysize. The authors analyzed four European datasets with retro-\nspective TTP data. Couples with a TTP of at least 12 months tended to\nhave smaller families. The odds ratio of not having a second child after a\nTTP of 12 months was 1.8 and for not having a third child it was 1.6. The\nauthors were unable to state conclusively that the associations were the\nsole and exclusive result of biologic factors. Joffe et al. surmised that\nhaving struggled to get pregnant may have inhibited people from trying\nagain, and the emotional trauma of a miscarriage or stillbirth may\nprevent a further attempt. In addition, births after a long TTP may be\nassociated with expensive infertility techniques which preclude repeated\nattempts.\nThe current data suggest that male factor infertility may play a larger\nrole in determining family size than female factor infertility.

In addition, when comparing point esti-\nmates for the odds of larger family size, male factor infertility (assessed\nby two separate means) universally had reduced estimates compared\nwith female factor infertility in both separate and combined models,\nsuggesting a larger impact.\nThe explanation for the impact of male factor infertility is uncertain.\nIt may be that biologic causes for male infertility are more difficult to\ntreat or perhaps treatment is less utilized than for female counter-\nparts. Indeed, data from the NSFG suggest that fewer men than\nwomen utilize reproductive services in the USA (Anderson et al.,\n2009). As a male infertility diagnosis is known to negatively impact a\nman's marital relations and personal quality of life, the emotional\nburden may impede further reproductive efforts (Smith et al., 2009).\nRegardless, the finding is intriguing in light of population-based data\nsuggesting that childless men are at an increased risk of prostatic or\nJorgensen et al., 2008). The current data suggest that men with\nlower offspring numbers may, in fact, have impaired fertility. As\nsome investigators have suggested, impaired fertility may be a\nmarker for future disease in men (Jacobsen et al., 2000; Skakkebaek\nCertain limitations of the analysis warrant mention. By only including\nrespondents 45 years old and younger, some individuals may not have\nreached their final family size. The analysis does not include individuals\nwith no children who maybe infertile and unaware as they have not\nattempted to conceive (Greil et al., 2009). The survey also provides\nlimited data on wanted or ideal final family size and this analysis pre-\nsumes that the respondents would have had the expected number\nof additional children if possible. The data were accrued by survey\nand as such are subject to measurement errors and consequent\nbiases. The data set did not provide details regarding the timing and\nnature of the infertility evaluation and treatment. In particular, within\nthe male sample no information regarding TTP and the infertility etiol-\nogy was obtained. Moreover, the participants queried about specific\nreproductive difficulties varied (i.e. surgically sterilized respondents\nwere excluded from the question about current reproductive ability)\nand these differences in number could have complicated the compari-\nsons between groups. It is impossible to determine to what extent\nemotional factors such as miscarriage and infertility anxiety caused\nindividuals to stop trying to conceive and to what extent the cause\nwas biological. Financial stresses of infertility treatments may also\nhave caused respondents to stop trying to conceive. Furthermore,\nthe inclusion and exclusion criteria limited the overall number of par-\nticipants and lowered the power of the study.\nNevertheless, the current study used a population-based survey to\nestablish that a diagnosis of infertility and a longer TTP are associated\nwith reduced odds of having a larger family, implicating a biologic role\nin the determination of family size in the USA. Moreover, male factor\ninfertility may have a larger impact on final family size than female\nfactor infertility.\nAuthors' roles\nB.N.B. and M.L.E. participated in study design, execution, analysis,\nmanuscript drafting and critical discussion.
