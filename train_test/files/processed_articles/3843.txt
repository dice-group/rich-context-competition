However, inclusive education (IE) pol-\nicy in South Africa requires all the teachers to be able to cater\nfor diversity in their respective classes. Of all the professions\nthat focus on the development of learners, teaching is\nregarded as one of the most complex. It is not a \"simple,\nstraightforward enterprise\" (Snowman, McCowan, &\nBiehler, 2009); therefore, when policies are changed,\ndemands on teachers are increased. In the light of this, the\nvarious changes that have taken place in South Africa since\n1994 can be seen as having added an unreasonable amount of\nstress to teachers. One significant educational reform in the\n21st century has been the movement toward IE. The White\nPaper 6 policy, building an IE and training system\n(Department of Education [DoE], 2001), requires that all\nlearners, irrespective of race, gender, language, class, reli-\ngion, disability, HIV/AIDS status, and culture, have a right to\naccess education, and acknowledges that all children can\nlearn with support. However, many teachers in service have\nnot had the benefit of being trained to teach learners with\ndiverse needs and so often find it difficult (Phasha, Mahlo, &\nMaseko, 2013). The aim of this article was to find out how\nteachers cater for diversity in their respective classes when\nthey are required to implement IE. The study on which it is\nbased sought to investigate how teachers perceived their\nroles on the inclusion of learners with diverse needs in the\nFoundation Phase. The researcher argues that while some\nteachers in service were not initially trained in IE, they\nshould still take their responsibility seriously and have a\nmore reasonable expectation as teachers.\nResponsibilities of Teachers in the\nFoundation Phase\nThe term Foundation Phase refers to Grades R to 3 and\nincludes learners from 6 to 9 years of age (DoE, 1997; White\nPaper 5, Document Grades R-3). This is a 4-year phase, start-\ning with the reception year and running important learning\nprograms, notably Numeracy, Literacy, and Life Skills.\nDavis (1994) affirms that during this phase, a learner devel-\nops in totality, that is, as a physical being who develops con-\ntrol over his or her gross and fine motor coordination, as a\npsychosocial being who is able to control his or her emo-\ntions, and as a cognitive being who is able to comprehend the\nsurrounding world. This is the phase in which the foundation\n1University of South Africa, Pretoria\nCorresponding Author:\nDikeledi Mahlo, Department of Inclusive Education, University of South,\nEmail: mahlofd@unisa.ac.za\nTeaching Learners With Diverse Needs\nin the Foundation Phase in Gauteng\nProvince, South Africa\nDikeledi Mahlo1\n Keywords\nteachers, diversity, inclusive education, barriers, support\n2 SAGE Open\nof learning is laid effectively, a critical time for promoting\ninterest in education and positive attitudes toward school\nwhen self-concepts are developed. Joshua (2006) maintains\nthat if a child fails at this stage, he or she will be adversely\naffected and may even drop out of the schooling system\nbefore having had an opportunity to explore his or her learn-\ning potential. Gargiulo and Kilgo (2011) point out that early\nchildhood inclusion embodies the values, policies, and prac-\ntices that support the right of every child to participate in a\nbroad range of activities.\nAlthough IE is a priority in SouthAfrican schools, there are\nfactors in the system that affect the implementation as con-\nceived by the policy. It is against this background that the\nresearcher considers challenges at the different levels of the\neducation system when catering for learners with diverse\nneeds. Socioeconomic factors contribute to large classes, lack\nof parental support, and other social problems. Learners are\nfaced with challenges that put them at risk of psychological,\nsocial, and academic difficulties, and that cannot be dealt with\nin isolation because they interact in a dynamic way. Therefore,\nthis article examines some of the factors at macro and meso\nlevels which affect the teachers and learners, as the school at\nmicro level is responsible for the policy implementation. With\nthe increasing extent of change in the educational reforms has\ncome greater inclusion of learners with diverse learning needs.\nThe teachers should identify learners experiencing barriers to\nlearning as early as possible within their phase and give neces-\nsary support, observing them carefully in all the learning areas\nso that necessary adaptations can be made.\nOne strategy in the development of a single IE system is\nthe Policy on Screening, Identification, Assessment and\nSupport (SIAS; DoE, 2014), which targets all learners in\nurban and rural settings who need support, not only those\nwith disabilities, specifically those from the poorest commu-\nnities in townships, informal settlements, or rural areas, as\nthey have previously suffered from the unavailability of and\nlack of access to services (DoE, 2005). The policy provides\nguidelines and information on the procedures in supporting\nlearners who experience barriers to learning, outlining the\nrole of teachers, especially in the Foundation Phase; parents;\nmanagers; and support staff within a framework of a new\nvision of how support should be organized. According to the\nDoE (2005), teachers should identify learners who are in\nneed of enriched and support programs; require diagnostic\nhelp in specific aspects of a learning program; have a learn-\ning barrier; are overaged; have a mismatch between home\nlanguage and the language of teaching, learning and assess-\nment; have physical disabilities, such as with vision, speech,\ngeneral health, hunger, and emotional stability due to harass-\nment or violence; do not attend school regularly; and/or\nshow signs of abuse or neglect.\nThe SIAS policy is thus clear on which learners could be\nin need of support. It is affirmed that previously the respon-\nsibility of assisting learners with barriers to learning lay with\nspecially qualified persons employed either by educational\nsupport services or special schools. This implied that teach-\ners and schools did not view the assistance of learners expe-\nriencing barriers to learning as their responsibility, but rather\ntheir duty was only to identify and refer them to more spe-\ncialized people.\nIt is evident that the teaching of learners with diverse\nneeds requires teachers with specific knowledge and skills to\nenable them to identify and help learners, thus cultivating a\npositive attitude and willingness to accept them in class and\nassist them. It is evident that the teachers do not conceptual-\nize their roles clearly as the IE policy requires them to per-\nform some duties to which they were not accustomed.\nThe White Paper 6 states that classroom teachers now\nhave a responsibility toward learners with diverse needs as\nthey are being educated in the ordinary classes.As Giangreco,\nCarter, Doyle, and Suter (2010) acknowledge, support pro-\nvided to classroom teachers is essential, and although class-\nroom teachers are not expected to have all the answers or\nundertake the task of IE alone, they must realize that while\nthe foundational principles of teaching and learning do not\nchange, those principles may need to be applied differently\nor used more systematically.\nSingal (2010) maintains that even when children with dis-\nabilities do attend the mainstream classrooms, the teachers\ndo not always regard them as their primary responsibility.\nThis is contrary to the guiding principle underpinning inclu-\nsion, that regular schools should accommodate all learners\nregardless of their physical, intellectual, sensory, emotional,\nor other special needs (Forlin, 2008). They should, therefore,\nhave appropriate skills, and as such, the expectations on\nteachers are greater, which then affects attitudes toward IE.\nTeachers need to be reflective, critical thinkers if IE is to\nbe successful (Naicker, 2005) as they are the ones imple-\nmenting IE in the classrooms and without their support the\nvision would not be a reality. It is important for teachers to\nevaluate their level of professionalism and how they define\nthemselves as teachers. Korthagen (2004) identifies essential\nquestions that are important in developing a professional\nidentity, and the teachers need to answer questions such as\nfollows: Who am I? How do I see my role as a teacher? What\nkind of a teacher do I want to be? By engaging in such dia-\nlogues, they may realize why they chose teaching as a pro-\nfession among all the available ones, and do justice to the\nlearners. It is frustrating being in employment that one does\nnot like, and one, therefore, does not put maximum effort or\nenergy into it. Teachers need to be proud to be teachers, be\ncompetent and be willing to make an extra effort. The inter-\naction of the different levels in the education system has an\nimpact on the successful implementation of the policy, which\nparticularly requires teachers to cater for diversity.\nTheoretical Framework\nThis articles draws on the ecological systems theory of Urie\nBronfenbrenner (1979), in which there is interaction between\nan individual's development and systems within the general\nsocial context. Regarded by Haihambo (2010) as an example\nof a multidimensional model of human development, it pos-\nits that there are layers or levels of interacting systems result-\ning in change, growth, and development, namely physical,\nbiological, psychological, social, and cultural. What happens\nin one system affects and is affected by other systems (Swart\n& Pettipher, 2005); thus, human behavior, experiences, and\nactions cannot be understood if the contexts in which they\noccur are not considered.\nAn individual is seen as part of the subsystems of society,\nwhich are also interrelated. Bronfenbrenner identifies five\nstructures or environmental systems in which human beings\ndevelop, and they are macro, exo, meso, micro, and chrono\nsystems. What happens in one system affects and is affected\nby other systems (Swart & Pettipher, 2005), which implies\nthat human behavior, experiences, and actions cannot be\nunderstood if the contexts in which they occur are not con-\nsidered. This article focuses on the micro level, in this case\nthe school, on which the implementation of IE takes place\nand teachers are required to cater for learners' diverse needs.\nIt encompasses the immediate environments in which an\nindividual develops, characterized by events closest to his or\nher life, and involves continual face-to-face contact, with\neach person reciprocally influencing the other (Swart &\nPettipher, 2005). In the new education system, the school is\nsupposed to become a caring environment in which learners\nare accepted and treated equally with respect, regardless of\ntheir different needs. Donald, Lazarus, and Lolwana (2009)\ndefine the micro system as one in which learners are closely\ninvolved in proximal interactions with other familiar people,\nsuch as the family and school, and it involves daily activities\nthat shape many aspects of cognitive, social, emotional,\nmoral, and spiritual development. As teachers at school level\nare responsible for the implementation of IE policy, their atti-\ntudes toward learners experiencing different barriers to\nlearning affect learners' academic careers. They need to\nwork together with stakeholders, such as parents, social\nworkers, and counselors, so that the effective implementa-\ntion of IE can take place.\nTeachers' Attitudes Toward IE\nOne of the most difficult challenges in preparing teachers to\nwork in diverse classrooms is that of ensuring that they have\na positive attitude toward learners with different backgrounds\nand special educational needs (SEN), and that they are will-\ning participants in the inclusion movement (Forlin, 2010).\nThis suggests that if they do not have an understanding of\ndiversity, a positive attitude, and belief in inclusion, they\ncannot be expected to embrace such a philosophy. Florian\nand Rouse (2010) maintain that most mainstream teachers do\nnot believe that they have the skills or knowledge to teach\nlearners with learning barriers because they have not taken a\nspecialist course. They believe there are experts \"out there\"\nto teach those learners on a one-to-one basis, and therefore,\nteaching them is not their responsibility. This type of think-\ning becomes a barrier to IE, as developing effective inclusive\npractices is not only about extending teachers' knowledge\nbut also about encouraging them to do things differently and\ngetting them to reconsider their attitudes and beliefs about\nchildren with barriers and schooling. According to Phasha\net al. (2013), teachers need to change their attitude toward\nlearners who experience barriers to learning.\nMany attitude problems occur through human interaction\nin the school community, which includes relations between\nteachers, principal and teachers, teachers and learners, teach-\ners and parents, and between learners themselves. The rela-\ntions between teachers are important not only in the context\nof developing a healthy working environment but also as a\nmodel for learners themselves (Engelbrecht & Green, 2001).\nOne of the challenges facing the implementation of IE is\n\"attitude,\" and that of the teacher is crucial to the promotion\nof IE through catering for diversity. The challenge facing\nmany South African teachers is that they have not been\ntrained to cope with diversity of learners now entering\nschools. It can be seen that teachers need reorientation, assis-\ntance, and support as well as fundamental shifts in their con-\nsciousness and attitudes (Phasha et al., 2013). Gordon Porter\nmaintains that teachers need to be helped to achieve positive\nchanges in attitudes toward new teaching methods and cir-\ncumstances to achieve effective inclusion in schools (United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\nThe task of implementing education policies, including\nWhite Paper 6, is performed at the provincial level, then fil-\nters down to the districts or regions, and finally to schools.\nThis provides an opportunity for the provincial staff to design\nthe implementation program and strategies in context.\nTeachers are the main role-players in the school and are\nexpected to provide quality education for all learners, irre-\nspective of religion, HIV/AIDS status, disability, language,\nrace, culture, gender, and belief. Unianu (2012) finds that the\nteachers' attitudes toward IE could be formed and developed\nin the context of an educational system that can provide some\nspecific conditions to have a good practice in this field.\nHowever, in a study conducted by Nel et al. (2011), they con-\ncluded that teachers have negative attitudes toward IE poli-\ncies both in South Africa and Sweden.\nIt is then critical to recognize that inclusivity is complex, to\nbe seen not only as an issue of placing learners with diverse\nneeds and barriers into regular classes, but also as a model of\nholistic development of modifying and adapting community\nand teachers' attitude to enable all learners to fully engage\nwith the curriculum. Teachers have their own attitudes, ideas,\nand beliefs about what they consider to be right when it comes\nto inclusive practices, but they need to be accredited and con-\nsidered important because if they are not well addressed, it is\nnot possible to have an inclusive society that incorporates\ndiversity in schools. Of particular significance are the attitudes\n4 SAGE Open\nand beliefs of teachers regarding inclusive educational prac-\ntices as they are considered the most influential aspects of\ndetermining the success of inclusion. As teachers, it is critical\nthat opportunities are provided for reflection of their attitudes,\npersonal beliefs, values, and expectations, while developing\nthe desire to become inclusive to seek out the skills. If teachers\nhave the good will and positive attitudes, they will seek the\nskills to embrace diversity.\nIn a study in Australia of community attitudes towards IE,\naccording to Gilmore, Campbell, and Cuskelly (2003)\nrespondents stated that people felt uncomfortable when\ninteracting with individuals with disabilities, problematic\nemotional behavior, and communication disorders. It was\nbelieved that this was mainly due to their lack of knowledge\nand understanding of diverse needs of individuals, and only\n17% of the sample reported that they knew many of the\ndiverse types of disabilities or other learning challenges,\nwhile 20% said they knew very little or had no knowledge at\nall. This affirms the findings of the study by Gilmore et al.\n(2003) on the general education teachers in the United Arab\nEmirates (UAE) and their acceptance of the inclusion of stu-\ndents with disabilities. The study revealed that teachers in\ngeneral in the UAE had less than encouraging attitudes\ntoward the inclusion of students with disabilities, which\nallows and encourages the establishment of policies that\nguarantee a student's right to be educated in regular class-\nrooms. The above scholars affirm that if a country is aiming\nto change its education system and push for inclusion, the\nteachers'attitudes need to change. Gilmore et al. suggest that\naccurate knowledge and positive but realistic expectations\nare important for enhancing the acceptance of individuals\nwithin schools and communities.\nThe practical implementation of IE in developing coun-\ntries such as Uganda and Zambia is hampered by insufficient\nteacher training, inadequate human and material resources,\nlarge class sizes, and negative attitudes (Silupya, 2003).\nMeanwhile, South African teachers are currently being\nexpected to make major changes in the way they understand\nteaching and learning, especially in diverse classrooms.\nTeachers may need support to focus on the positive rather\nthan the negative aspects of change (Engelbrecht, 1999), and\nshould be sensitive to their own attitudes and feelings about\ninclusion.\nIn a number of studies in South Africa, the attitudes of\nteachers toward educating learners with diverse challenges\nto learning have been put through as a decisive factor in mak-\ning schools more inclusive. Engelbrecht, Swart, and Eloff\n(2001) focused on the coping skills of educators who had\nlearners with Down's syndrome in inclusive classrooms,\nfinding that teachers experienced stress due to lack of sup-\nport and inappropriate training for inclusive programs.\nBothma, Gravett, and Swart (2000) maintain that attitudes of\nprimary school teachers toward South African IE policy\nwere largely negative and could become a critical barrier to\nsuccessful implementation. Naicker (2003) asserts that\nalthough inclusion seems to be well researched and estab-\nlished in the developed world, it should not be regarded as\nproblem-free. Notably, children in the West who are in spe-\ncial education classes are there because of poverty, language,\nand inappropriate education practices.\nBelknap, Roberts, and Nyewe (1997) discuss what could\nbe interpreted as samples of inclusive environments. They\nacknowledge that students with disabilities are likely to place\nhigher demands on the teacher. Attitudes play an important\nrole, therefore, and when necessary, those transmitting edu-\ncation should change from targeting a selected few to sup-\nporting all students. It is evident that attitudes and support\ncannot be separated, because if one has a negative attitude\ntoward learners with barriers, one cannot provide that sup-\nport to the learners. In a similar vein, if one's attitude toward\nIE is negative whatever effort is made to make IE a reality\nwill be shut down. If IE practices are promoted in schools,\nnegative attitudes and perceptions will fade, perhaps much\nsooner than expected.\nMethod\nA qualitative approach was used, and data were collected\nthrough semistructured interviews; this allowed the\nresearcher to gain in-depth understanding of social realities\nand derive a comprehensive portrait of a range human\nendeavors, interactions, situations, and perceptions (Zollers,\nRamanathan, & Yu, 1999). A phenomenological design was\nundertaken, as it is based on the theoretical point of view that\nadvocates the study of direct experiences taken at face value.\nThe researcher wished to hear the participants' point of view\nabout teaching learners with diverse needs in the Foundation\nPhase. Following a purposive sampling method, a total of 10\nFoundation Phase teachers were selected, an important crite-\nrion being experience in their current position for at least 5\nyears, that is, since 2010, when their schools began imple-\nmenting IE. They should have thus accumulated relevant\nexperience about the topic studied. The researcher included\nonly those who were prepared to participate in research and\nwilling to share the information (Morse & Richards, 2002).\nData were collected by means of semistructured inter-\nviews, observations, and document analysis. Semistructured\ninterviews were used because they provided firsthand infor-\nmation from the Foundation Phase teachers. According to\nDenzin and Lincoln (2000), they provide the researcher with\nan opportunity to ask individually tailored questions and do\nnot limit the field of enquiry. The researcher began with a\npredetermined set of questions but allowed some latitude in\nbreadth of relevance. One-to-one interviews were conducted\nafter working hours, not exceeding 1 hr. Data were audio-\ntaped and independently transcribed.\nThe following questions were asked:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What are your opinions about teaching learners with\ndiverse needs in the Foundation Phase?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How do you experience the implementation of IE in\nthe Foundation Phase?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Which factors are affecting the implementation of IE\nin the Foundation Phase?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What strategies are followed to cater for learner's\ndiverse needs in the Foundation Phase?\nObservations of Foundation Phase teachers offering a les-\nson to learners with diverse needs were made and field notes\ntaken. Observations were included because the researcher\nwished to gather data from natural settings, that is, the\nFoundation Phase classrooms. This entailed a systematic\nnoting and recording of events, behavior, and objects in a\nsocial setting of the chosen study. The study necessitated a\nnonparticipant observation wherein the researcher was an\nobserver but not interfering with the proceedings.\nDocuments analysis entails scrutiny of relevant docu-\nments, which can be a valuable source of information\n(Henning, Van Rensburg, & Smit 2004) and gave the\nresearcher an idea of the current processes and strategies fol-\nlowed to assist learners with diverse needs and experiencing\nbarriers to learning. Documents are also valuable sources for\nsupporting the findings made through other research meth-\nods such as interviews and observations (Best & Kahn,\n2006). Document analysis included intervention programs\nand registers of learners experiencing barriers.\nContent analysis (Maree, 2013) was used, because the\nresearcher analyzed qualitative responses to interviews and\nsummarized the messages from documents to identify the\nunits of meaning relating to the topic. Audio-taped data were\nlistened to several times to gather emerging categories and\nthemes, and all the data were read, with large bodies of text\nbroken down into smaller meaningful units in the form of\nsentences or individual words. It was perused several times\nto get a sense of what it contained, and in the process, the\nresearcher wrote in the margins possible categories or inter-\npretation. Identification of themes was based on the assump-\ntion that at that point it was easy to get a sense of what the\ndata meant. Finally, data were integrated and summarized.\nAudio-taped data were listened to several times to gather\nemerging categories. The following themes emerged from\nthe data.\nLack of Parental or Caregiver's Support\nTeaching learners with diverse needs in inclusive settings\nwill be successful if there is a partnership between the home,\nschool, and the learner but due to socioeconomic status and\nunemployment, most parents in South Africa leave the chil-\ndren in the care of siblings or grandparents. Sometimes, it is\ndifficult for grandparents to take care of the well-being of the\nchildren, especially when they are illiterate and cannot assist\nwith schoolwork. The majority of teachers felt that lack of\nparental or caregiver support affects the implementation of\nIE negatively, especially on catering for learners with diverse\nneeds. When teachers identify the needs of learners, they\nsometimes need a parent to be part of the process. It becomes\na problem because even if they are called to the school, they\ndo not attend. If parents and caregivers are not involved in\nactivities of learners at school, learners' performance and\nconfidence in the classroom can suffer, causing a learner to\nexperience more barriers to learning, as affirmed by responses\non the following questions:\n\"What are your opinions about teaching learners with\ndiverse needs in the Foundation Phase?\" Classroom teachers\nmentioned parental support as the greatest challenge. As the\nprimary educators of their children and responsible for them\nthroughout life, parents have the most important and endur-\ning influence on their children's development (Winkler,\ners felt that parents were neglecting their responsibilities as\nprimary educators, leaving the responsibility to the class-\nroom teachers. This was clear from one teacher who said,\n\"Parents need to be taught how to parent their kids; you can-\nnot bring a child in this world and then ignore their responsi-\nbility of taking care of that child.\" This was reiterated by\nanother classroom teacher: \"If you call the parent to come\nand discuss the problem of the learner with you, the parent\ndoes not come, because they think you are going to tell them\nthat their child is going to fail.\" Echoing the sentiments was\nanother teacher, who said,\nParents are not supportive; they don't even come when you call\nthem to the school, there are some problems which you cannot\nsolve without the parents' consent, so the issue of inclusion\nbecomes irrelevant when we look at real practical issues.\nParents should be supportive of classroom teachers, espe-\ncially in solving problems of learners who are experiencing\nbarriers to learning. If parents take the responsibility for their\nchildren, the classroom teachers will also be encouraged to\nsupport the learners because they know they also have the\nparents' support.\nSchools have to take responsibility for making parents\nfeel that they are accepted as partners in the education of\ntheir children. As such, the learners' confidence and perfor-\nmance in the classroom will improve because they realize\nthat even their parents and caregivers are interested in their\nwell-being. This was evident also during the documents\nanalysis, as the registers containing invitation letters to the\nparents revealed that parents who were invited to the school\nbecause their children were experiencing barriers to learning\ndid not attend. Teachers had several letters as evidence.\nThe above incidences and reports of teachers show that\nparents were not supportive, and therefore, teachers felt help-\nless and frustrated. During one observation session, when\nchecking the learners' books, the section which the parents\nshould sign after helping the children with homework was\nnot signed, regardless of the teacher's effort to indicate that\nthe parent should sign. Parents' and caregivers' involvement\n6 SAGE Open\nin school activities is regarded as the most important factor\nin the education of learners, because when parents know\nwhat is happening at the school they are able to support and\nmotivate learners to learn.\nLarge Classes\nRegarding the classroom teachers' opinions on implementa-\ntion of IE in the Foundation Phase, all indicated that large\nclass sizes were making it difficult, as evident in the follow-\ning statements: \"I have too many learners in my class, when\ndo I find time to concentrate only on one learner who has a\nproblem?\" The sentiments were echoed by this teacher:\nIt is not easy to implement this inclusion thing and cater for the\ndiverse needs of all learners, because, you can see how many\nlearners I am dealing with. This individual attention is not\npossible with so many learners. We are trying to accommodate\nthe learners who are struggling, but there are too many learners\nin class, so you end up doing only what you can.\nThe frustration of this teacher can be heard in the following\nwords: \"We have too many learners in classes; I don't know\nhow they expect us to perform miracles with such big\nclasses.\" The statements above indicate that the classroom\nteachers were frustrated by the large number of learners in\nthe classes and, therefore, found it difficult to attend to learn-\ners with diverse needs individually. Teaching and learning\nwill not take place as planned if there are too many learners\nin the classroom.\nThe researcher observed that in most classes the teacher\nwas supposed to teach as many as 40 learners, and to affirm\nthis, the documents analyzed revealed that there were more\nlearners in the register for learners who had been identified\nas experiencing barriers than the few not in the register. This\nis a serious problem in most of the Foundation Phase classes\nas it prevents the effective implementation of IE in the\nFoundation Phase and therefore the diverse needs of learners\nin class are not catered for.\nSocial Problems of Learners\nClassroom teachers also indicated that they need help to deal\nwith different social problems of learners. Those who find\nthemselves in situations in which they are supposed to inter-\nvene in social problems, such as abuse and/or violence, are\nsometimes unable to assist because they do not know what to\ndo. As such, they are helpless and frustrated by the situation,\nas made clear by one teacher: \"Most of our learners experi-\nence different problems whereby parents always fight, and\nthe learner is always thinking about what was happening in\nthe house so they do not even hear what you are teaching in\nclass.\" The problem is intensified when classroom teachers\nare not sure how to intervene, as clear in the words of this\nteacher:\nYes, in some cases you find that the learner is bullying others,\nyou need to refer that learner to the counsellor. Learners who are\nnaughty stealing others possessions, then you will find that those\nlearners may not get love from home, so social worker or the\ncounsellor helps us there, because we don't know what to do in\nsuch cases, actually we are clueless in catering for this learners.\nFrom the statements above, one can conclude that the coun-\nselors and social workers are mostly required to resolve\nsocial problems that the classroom teachers are unable to\nhandle. During the observation session, the researcher real-\nized that the learners were mostly asleep during the lesson\nand many did not have the proper school uniform or lunch\nboxes. Most depended on the feeding scheme, which some-\ntimes was not operating so they went hungry. To affirm this,\nthe registers of learners experiencing barriers to learning also\nrevealed that more experienced social problems than aca-\ndemic problems, and if not attended to it would be difficult to\nhelp them succeed academically.\nTraining for Classroom Teachers\nIn responding to the question, \"What strategies are followed\nto cater for learners diverse needs in the Foundation Phase?\"\nmost teachers indicated that they needed to be well trained in\nhow to deal with learners experiencing barriers to learning.\nLiterature reveals that, in inclusive classrooms, teachers\nrequire diverse knowledge and skills (Borman & Rose,\n2010). Most of those interviewed indicated that they needed\nintensive training in IE so that they would be able to support\nand cater for the diverse needs of learners in the classes.\nThey were frustrated by situations they were unable to han-\ndle, such as abuse, and different cultures, languages, and\nraces. They reported that they wished to help them but they\nnot know how, as was evident in the following statement:\n\"Sometimes you find that you suspect a learner in your class\nhas been abused, how do you then talk to that learner?\nSeriously you need skills to do that without offending the\nlearner.\" In addition, the classroom teacher mentioned only\nhaving been trained once in IE and catering for learners with\ndiverse needs: \"We went for training only once; we need\nmore training on this inclusive education so that we can\nimplement it correctly, for now what we are doing is just trial\nand error.\" The statements above affirm that classroom\nteachers do not have appropriate skills and knowledge to\nimplement IE or cater for learners with diverse needs. There\nis a desperate need for more intensive training so that the\nclassroom teachers can be confident in supporting learners\nwith diverse needs in their classes. During observation les-\nsons, it was clear that the teachers did not know how to inter-\nvene when a learner was experiencing a problem. For\ninstance, if learners did not spell the word correctly, the\nteachers asked them to repeat the correct word 20 times in\nthe book, but did not establish why the word was spelled\nincorrectly the first time, whether there was something\nwrong with the way learners were taught or how to pro-\nnounce the word. This was also affirmed by the record in the\nregisters, as six teachers recorded that the learners had prob-\nlems with spelling yet there was no evidence of how they\nwere dealing with that particular issue. When asked what\nthey did in such cases, they said they had not been taught\nhow to teach spelling or phonics so just let the learners repeat\nthe word that was wrongly spelled several times. There is an\nurgent need for teachers to be trained in the areas mentioned\nabove if IE is to be implemented effectively, and assistance\nprovided to learners with diverse needs.\nDiscussion\nIt was noted that although Foundation Phase teachers are\nhaving learners with different needs in their classes, there are\nother factors that make catering for them problematic. All\nteachers agreed that IE is an educational strategy that could\ncontribute to a democratic society because it embraces the\ndemocratic values of equality, human rights, and recognition\nof diversity. However, Foundation Phase teachers who\nformed part of the study had their reservations regarding the\nimplementation thereof, believing it to be good on paper but\ndifficult to implement without adequate support. They fur-\nther mentioned that parents and caregivers could play an\nimportant role in ensuring that they support the IE policy so\nthat learners with diverse needs can be catered for. Foundation\nPhase teachers alluded to a number of opinions on imple-\nmenting IE but in particular indicated more support for\nteachers so that they could help learners experiencing barri-\ners to learning and development. Conversely, as the\nresearcher argues, it is not beneficial to be educated in a\nschool in which there is little or no support. Findings from\nthis study revealed that lack of support has a significant\nimpact on the implementation of IE and catering for diverse\nlearners in the schools. IE requires schools to respond to the\ndiversity of learners and provide equal opportunities for all.\nMany schools in South Africa are affected by overcrowd-\ning, and findings from this study revealed that teachers still\nhad around 40 learners in one classroom, rendering effective\nlearning and teaching difficult and implementation of a new\npolicy such as IE highly impractical. Teachers thus develop\nnegative attitudes toward the learner who experience barriers\nto learning, and the large classes make it difficult for them to\nidentify learners who experience barriers to learning and pro-\nvide them with the appropriate attention. The diversity of\nlearners in class makes the task of the teacher difficult to\nachieve. The study further identified gaps that interfere with\nthe implementation of IE in the Foundation Phase as the\nteachers do not know how to intervene when faced with\nproblems, as such learners who experience barriers to learn-\ning are not included in the teaching and learning and some\nteachers do not know how to help them. Teachers indicated\nthat without support, the vision of IE would not be realized.\nThe findings reinforce Bronfenbrenner's theory that\nunderpins the study as the school is at the micro level of the\nsystem of education, where the policies are practically imple-\nmented and if careful consideration is not made at that level\nregarding the implementation, it will affect all levels.\nBronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory explains the\ndirect and indirect influences on a child's life by referring to\nthe many levels of environment or contexts that influence a\nperson's development. A major challenge of the education\nsystem is to understand the complexity of the influences,\ninteractions, and interrelationships between the individual\nlearner and multiple or other systems that are connected to\nthe learner (Swart & Pettipher, 2005). The learner does not\nexist in isolation, and all the systems determine whether he\nor she will be successful in an academic career, including the\nsystem of education, teachers, the parents, and the school. If\nall systems work together, all learners in schools, even those\nexperiencing barriers, will benefit.\nRecommendations\nThe researcher recommends that integrating school activities\nwith community activities in catering for learners with\ndiverse needs is of the utmost importance. Traditionally,\nleaders in the community are respected, and whatever they\nsay is listened to, irrespective of whether they are educated\nor not. Foundation Phase teachers can form partnerships with\nthe community leaders who usually invite parents and guard-\nians to community meetings. There are also ministers, priests\nin churches, and burial society chairpersons, who as leaders\ncan allocate a slot in their gatherings to talk about the impor-\ntance of supporting school activities so that the teachers can\nbe supported in catering for learners with diverse needs.\nIt is, therefore, recommended that to minimize class sizes,\nmost activities should take place outside the classroom.\nLearners in the Foundation Phase learn by playing, which\ncould be enhanced by employing assistant teachers to give\nextended classroom support, especially to those experiencing\nbarriers to learning. Teachers could also group learners for\nactivities so that they also learn from each other. Regarding the\nsocial problems experienced by learners, the researcher recom-\nmends that the practice and use of available resources in the\ncommunity should be encouraged, such as home-based organi-\nzations and those that offer voluntary counseling to vulnerable\nchildren in the form of guidance as well as help in schoolwork\nand general health. The DoE could also employ social workers\nand counselors on a better salary package, as in the private sec-\ntor, so that they can be attracted to work in schools and assist\nlearners who experience barriers to learning. More campaigns\non awareness of social problems that can affect the learners in\nclass are recommended because if the parents or the caregivers\nknow that the problem could affect the learner in future, they\nshould respond appropriately. Intensive training for Foundation\nPhase teachers on the intervention strategies to cater for diverse\nlearners in their classes is recommended as most of the teachers\nindicated that while they could identify the problems of the\n8 SAGE Open\nlearner, they did not know how to intervene. The interaction of\nall the stakeholders above affirms Bronfenbrenner's ecological\nsystems theory, which emphasizes the interaction between an\nindividual's development and the systems within the general\nsocial context.\nConclusion\nIn this article, the researcher discussed Foundation Phase\nteachers' roles and responsibilities in an inclusive classroom\nand the factors that may be causing the barriers to the imple-\nmentation of IE, thus making it difficult for them to cater for\ndiversity. Teachers feel overwhelmed by the responsibility\nplaced on them to teach and cater for diversity. While the\nresearcher acknowledged that South Africa has well-written\npolicies in place, such as on IE, their practical implementa-\ntion will remain problematic if the factors highlighted in this\narticle are not considered. The researcher is particularly con-\ncerned about the extent to which these factors are addressed\nbecause that will determine whether the vision of imple-\nmenting IE will be realized.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBelknap, M., Roberts, R., & Nyewe, K.
