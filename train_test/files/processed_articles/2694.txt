Previous community-\nbased adolescent firearm prevalence\nstudies have focused primarily on high\nneglect higher risk youth who do not\nlescents regardless of presenting com-\nplaint, and lacked information about\nfirearm acquisition, type, or motivation\nfor possession. No previous studies\nhave focused specifically on firearm\npossession among high-risk ED\nassault-injured youth, a critical sub-\ngroup to understand for future\nviolence-prevention initiatives.\nPrimary study objectives were (1) de-\ntermine the rate and correlates of fire-\narm possession among assault-injured\nyouth presenting to an inner-city ED; (2)\nunderstand differences in risk factors\namong these youth seeking care with\nand without firearm possession; and (3)\nidentify firearm possession character-\nistics in this population, including fire-\narmtype,reasonforfirearmpossession,\nand sources of firearms as a means to\ninform intervention efforts around ille-\ngal gun diversion.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design and Setting\nThis study presents screening data\ncollectedaspartofa2-yearlongitudinal\nstudy focused on assault-injured youth\nseeking ED care. Hurley Medical Center\nis the only public hospital in Flint,\nMichigan, and is the major Level-1\ntrauma center for the region, pro-\nStudy procedures were approved by\nthe institutional review board for both\nHurley Medical Center and the Univer-\nsity of Michigan; a National Institutes of\nHealth certificate of confidentiality was\nobtained. Flint crime and poverty rates\nare comparable to other urban cen-\nters, such as Detroit, Camden, and\nOakland.42 The study population re-\nflects the population of Flint, Michigan,\ncan,43 and our study population\ndemographics are similar to previous\nstudies conducted among all present-\nStudy Population\nassault-related injury completed the\nscreening survey. Trained research\nassistants (RAs) approached patients in\ntreatment areas. Exclusions included\nsexual assault, child abuse, suicidal\nideation/attempt, or conditions pre-\ncluding ethical consent (Fig 1). Youth\n,18 years old unaccompanied by\na parent/guardian were excluded\n(13.7%). Unstable trauma patients were\nrecruited on the inpatient floor if they\nstabilized within 72 hours.\nStudy Recruitment\nAssault-injured patientswere identified\nthrough electronic patient logs. Re-\ncruitment was 7 days per week; 21\nhours per day on Tuesdays and\nWednesdays and 24 hours per day\nThursdays through Mondays.\nStudy Protocol\nAfter providing written consent, patients\nself-administered a computerized sur-\nvey and received a $1.00 gift. The survey\nwas administered privately; family or\nfriends accompanying the patient were\nnot allowed to observe or participate\nduring administration and this was\nmonitored by the RA. The RA paused the\ncomputer survey during medical eval-\nuation orduring medical procedures to\nensure privacy and to avoid interfering\nwith medical care.\nOutcome Measures\nFirearm Possession\nThe dependent variable, firearm pos-\nsession,wasdefinedas guncarriageor\ngun ownership within the past 6\nmonths. All firearm questions and\nresponses were from the Tulane\nNational Youth Study and excluded use\nfor hunting or sporting activities. Af-\nfirmative answers to any of the 5\nquestions were coded as possession of\na firearm.\nGun carriage was assessed with 3\nquestions: (1) frequency of gun carriage\noutside the home; (2) reason for gun\ncarriage outside the home; and (3)\nsource of a handgun carried outside the\nquency of gun carriage was modified to\nmirror the conflict tactics scale-2 (never,\nthan 20 times). Response choices for\nreason for gun carriage outside the\nhome (Didn't carry a gun; Protection;\nHolding it for someone; Used gun in\na crime; To scare someone; To get back\nat someone; Most of my friends carry\nguns) and source of handgun carried\noutside the home (Didn't carry a hand-\ngun; Given or loaned by a family mem-\nber, Snuck it from home; Given/loaned\nfrom a friend; Paid cash for it; Traded\nsomething for it; Stole it) were also used\nto characterize gun-related activities.\nGun ownership was assessed with 2\nquestions:(1)typeofgunownedand(2)\nsource of a handgun paid for with cash.\nAn affirmative answer to either was\ncharacterized as gun ownership. The\nresponsescalefor typeofgunowned(No\npossession or ownership of a gun; Reg-\nular rifle; Automatic or semiautomatic\nrifle;Regularshotgun;Sawed-offshotgun;\nRevolver; Automatic or semiautomatic\nhandgun) and source of a handgun paid\nfor with cash (I didn't pay cash for the\nhandgun; Family member; Friend; Drug\naddict; Drug dealer; Street dealer;\nPawnshop or gun shop; Asked someone\nto buy it; Department or sporting goods\nstore) were further used to characterize\ngun ownership. Illegal firearm access\nwas defined as any source other than\na department/sporting goods store or\ngun shop/pawnshop. Descriptive ques-\ntions were asked about the perceived\nlevel of difficulty obtaining a handgun\nand history of purchasing a firearm from\nDemographic Information\nAge, gender, race, ethnicity, employ-\nment, and receipt of public assistance\nwere collected using measures from\nthe National Longitudinal Study of Ad-\nolescent Health and National Institutes\nof Health Drug Abuse Treatment Out-\nCharacterization of Assault Resulting\nin Index ED Visit\nParticipants were asked about rela-\ntionships (ie, spouse, girlfriend/\nboyfriend, friend, stranger) and ag-\ngressive behaviors (ie, threatened or\nused a gun) in the altercation prompting\npresentation. A modified Conflict Tactics\nScale (CTS)52 similar to the Timeline\nFollowbackSpousalViolence Interview53\nwas used. This has excellent test-retest\nChart Review\nChart review data (admit/discharge)\nwere collected. Five percent of charts\nA trained RA calculated injury severity\nscores from ED chart data.56\nARTICLE\nAttitudes Toward Violence and\nRevenge\nAttitudes toward aggression were\nassessedbyusingaretaliationsubscale\nof children's perceptions of environ-\nmental violence.57,58 Itemswere reverse-\ncoded (higher scores indicated more\nwillingness to endorse retaliation). A\nmean summary score was created for\neach participant and then all mean\nsummary scores were averaged for the\nbivariate comparison.\nViolence and Firearm-Related Violence\nPrevious 6-month violence measures\n(serious physical fight, causing injury\nrequiring treatment) were from the\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adoles-\nassessed by using questions from the\nmonth intimate partner violence was\nassessed with the revised CTS-2.59\nFrequency of firearm-related aggres-\nsion or victimization within the past 6\nmonths was assessed by using the\nmodified CTS-2 response scale.\nSubstance Use\nPast 6-month substance use, including\nalcohol, illicit drug use (cocaine, meth-\namphetamine, inhalants, hallucinogens,\nmarijuana, or street opioids) and non-\nmedical prescription drug use was\nassessed by using the Alcohol Use Dis-\norders Identification Test and Alcohol,\nSmoking, and Substance Use In-\ndrinking was defined as 5 or more\ndrinks on 1 occasion in the previous 6\nmonths. Substance use measures were\ndichotomized. Using standard mea-\nsures from the adolescent health sur-\nvey49 with the modified CTS-2 response\nscale, participants were also asked how\noften they drank alcohol or used drugs\nwhile carrying a weapon (gun or knife).\nStatistical Analysis\nDescriptive statistics were computed\nand bivariate analyses conducted\ncomparing gun possession (yes/no) in\nrelation to demographics, visit char-\nacteristics, substance use, and vio-\nlence. A logistic regression model was\nconstructed with firearm possession\n(yes/no) as the outcome. Independent\nvariables were included in the model\nbased on theory and significance in the\nbivariate analysis. Illicit drug use and\nbinge drinking were too highly corre-\nlated to be included in one regression\nmodel; therefore, given drug use was\nmore common in this population, it was\nretained in the final model. Gang\nmembership, although included in the\ndescriptive analysis, was dropped from\nthefinalmodel,asonly3%ofthesample\nbership. There was no evidence of\nmulticollinearity in the final model.\nRESULTS\nrecruitment hours. Research staff\napproached 92.2% of eligible patients\nsurvey. Refusals were more likely male\n.01). No age differences were noted in\nrefusal rates. The institutional review\nboard did not allow collection of addi-\ntional chart data from refusals. The\nmean screen completion time was 30\nRates of Firearm Possession\nAmong assault-injured youth, 23.1% (n\n= 159) reported firearm possession\n(Table 1) in the past 6 months. Among\nreported carrying outside the home in\nthe past 6 months. Of participants with\nfirearms, 67.3% were seen for peer-\nrelated violence and 14.5% for in-\ntimate partner\u00adrelated violence; 3.4%\nreported threatening someone with\na firearm during the altercation that\nprompted the visit. Of those with fire-\narms, 4 (2.5%) reported an ED mental\nhealth visit within the past year.\nBivariate Analysis\nParticipants with firearms were more\nlikelymale,lesslikelyAfricanAmerican,\nand less likely to receive public assis-\ntance (ie, higher socioeconomic status\n[SES]). Of those with firearms, 14.5%\nAttitudes Toward Violence and\nRevenge\nParticipants with firearms endorsed\nhigher mean levels of aggression and\nretaliatory attitudes compared with\nthose without firearms (Table 1).\nAmong those with firearms, more be-\nlieved \"revenge was a good thing\" (2.1\nthreaten to hurt someone else if they\n\"ok to hurt people if they hurt you first\"\nExperience With Violence and\nFirearm-Related Violence\nParticipants with firearms noted more\noverall violent experiences in the pre-\nvious 6 months (Table 1). They were also\nnoted to have higher rates of group\noverall sample (n = 689) endorsed gang\nmembership. Participants with fire-\narms were also more likely the victim or\nthe aggressor in firearm-related vio-\nlence in the past 6 months (Table 1).\nSubstance Use Correlates of Firearm\nPossession\nPast 6-month binge drinking and illicit\ndrug use were positively associated\nwith firearm possession. Those with\nfirearms had higher rates of pre-\nP , .01) and consumption of alcohol\nP , .01). They also reported using\nsubstances while carrying a weapon\n(gun or knife), with 16.4% reporting\nalcohol use and 17.6% reporting drug\nuse at least once.\nFirearm Types and Methods of\nAcquisition of Firearms\nYouth reported firearm possession\nprimarily for protection (37.1%), al-\nthough some note they were \"holding it\nfor someone\" (10.1%), or because their\n\"friends carry guns\" (8.8%). Among\nthose carrying a gun outside the home,\nrespondents primarily reported access\nto a handgun through either cash pur-\nchase (17.7%) or receiving it from\nreported purchasing a handgun with\ncash from a plausibly legal source\n(department/sporting goods store or\npawnshop/gun shop), whereas the re-\nmainder purchased the firearm illegally\n(either from a clearly illegal source or\nunderagepurchasesfromalegalsource\n[n = 2]) or did not endorse a method of\nacquisition. More than half the sample\n(51.6%)reportedthatit wouldbelittleor\nno trouble to obtain a firearm.\nAmong the assault-injured youth in our\nsample (Table 2), respondents were\nnoted to possess high levels of rapid-\nyouth noting ownership of automatic\nor semiautomatic weapons (rifles\nor handguns). Of these youth with\nautomatic/semiautomatic weapons,\n\"revenge was a good thing,\" 14.3% (n =\n4) reported that they carried a gun \"to\nscare someone\" or \"to get back at\nsomeone,\" and 1 of these participants\nhad a mental health visit within the\npast year at the site ED. Of those with\nautomatic or semiautomatic weapons,\nfrom a clearly legal source.\nMultivariate Logistic Regression\nAnalysis\nIn the multivariate logistic regression\nmodel (Table 3), illicit drug use, past 6-\nmonth serious fight, and high levels of\nretaliatory attitudes were associated\nwith firearmpossession among assault-\ninjured ED youth. Male individuals and\nthose with higher SES status (ie, not\nreceiving public assistance) were\nmore likely to possess a gun. Age and\nrace were not significant predictors of\nfirearm possession.\nDISCUSSION\nThis is the first study to report firearm-\npossession rates, associated risk\nbehaviors,andtocharacterizethetypes\nof firearms and methods of firearm\nacquisition among a consecutive, sys-\ntematically obtained sample of high-\nrisk assault-injured youth presenting\nto the ED. Results have implications for\nfirearm diversion policy as well as\nhospital- and community-based ini-\ntiatives to prevent potentially recurrent\nlethal violence among assault-injured\nyouth.\nRates of firearm possession were no-\ntably higher in our study than previous\nEDstudies,likelyreflectingourfocuson\na high-risk sample of youth seeking\ncare for assault rather than general ED\nrates of firearm possession in this\npopulation, combined with the finding\nthat assaulted youth with firearms had\nTABLE 1 Patient Characteristics for Violently Injured ED Patients With and Without Gun Possession\nGun Possession,\nNo Gun Possession,\nDemographics\nCharacteristics of ED presentation\nConflict prompting presentation\nPast 6-month substance use\nAttitudes toward aggression\nAggressive attitudes,b mean\nsummary score (SD)\nPast 6-month experiences with violence\nPast 6-month experiences with\nfirearm-related violenced\nAll values are n (%) unless noted otherwise.\nd Including current ED visit.\nARTICLE\nhigher rates of retaliatory attitudes\nand substance use, highlight the im-\nportance of focusing ED and commu-\nnity violence prevention interventions\namong this subgroup. Most firearms in\nour study were likely obtained illegally,\nwith almost a quarter of the sample\nendorsing ownership of automatic/\nsemiautomatic weapons that are large-\nclip, high rate-of-fire weapons, or may\nbe modified to these highly lethal\nweapon types (ownership of guns for\ntarget shooting or hunting was ex-\ncluded). This, along with high carriage\nrates (41.5%), suggests opportunities\nfor improved law enforcement around\nfirearm diversion and improved poli-\ncies around weapon access among\nhigh-risk youth.\nParticipants in our study, consistent\nwith school-based studies,65 endorsed\nprotection as a primary reason for\nownership. These school-based studies\nfound an association between carrying\nfirearms and exposure to community\nviolence.65 The perceived need to own\nand carry firearms for protection\namong respondents with assault injury\nsuggests a need to address youth's\nperceived and real feeling of safety\nthrough individual and community in-\ntervention.\nAlthough causality cannot be de-\ntermined because of the cross-\nsectional nature of the study, among\nan already high-risk group of assault-\ninjured patients, those with firearms\nwere more likely engaged in violent and\naggressive firearm-related activities\nover the previous 6 months. They were\nalso more likely to have pulled a firearm\nin a fight, shot or stabbed another per-\nson,usedaguninafightwithanintimate\npartner, or caused injury requiring\ntreatment than their peers without\nfirearms. It is important to note that few\nyouth were involved in a gang. Taken\ntogether, these findings demonstrate\nthat even if the main reason youth\nreported that they obtained a gun was\nfor protection, they are often both car-\nrying and using the weapon. In combi-\nnation with high rates of substance use\nreported before the altercation, and\nhigher rates of substance use seen in\nyouth with firearms, this is particularly\nconcerning for inadvertently increasing\nthe risk of a firearm moving from\na protective device to impulsive use and\nlethal outcomes.\nAsinpreviousstudies,maleyouthwere\nmore likely to have firearm posses-\nhowever, that 30% of youth with fire-\narms were female, highlighting the\nneed to include both genders in injury-\nprevention efforts. Of note, and contrary\nto previous ED studies, youth with\nhigher SES status were more likely to\nsized, race was not predictive of firearm\npossession. Overall, white males, not on\npublic aid seeking care forassault were\nmore likely to possess a gun than their\nAfrican American male counterparts\nreceiving public assistance.\nParticipantswithfirearmswerenotedto\nhave more aggressive attitudes com-\npared with those without firearms,\nsuggesting aggressive attitudes and\nsubsequent retaliation are major\ncontributors to violent firearm-related\ninjury. ED studies have shown that\nassault-related injuries among youth\nare often the result of long-standing\ndisagreements28 and that retaliation\nmay be an underlying cause for vio-\nlence.67,68 These findings are important\nbecause health behavior models,69\nwhich are key to many violence-\nprevention efforts, suggest the first\nstep to decreasing future aggression\nwould be to modify aggressive atti-\ntudes.\nAlthough peer violence was the source\nof the altercation prompting medical\ncare in most cases, we found dating/\nintimate partner violence was also\nhighly associated with firearm pos-\nsession. This finding is concerning for\nescalation of future partner violence to\nlethal means with the firearm they note\nthat they possess. Also, many of these\nyouth are parents themselves, raising\nconcern for the safe gun storage and\ntheneedtorestrictfirearmaccessfrom\ntheir young children.\nTABLE 2 Characteristics of Gun Possession\nAmong Violently Injured Patients\nType of gun possession\nAutomatic or\nsemiautomatic rifle\nAutomatic or\nsemiautomatic handgun\nDid not endorse a specific\ntype of gun\nMethod of handgun acquisition\n(cash purchases)\nSomeone purchased for me 4 (2.5)\nDepartment or sporting\ngoods store\nDid not endorse paying\ncash for a handgun\nAll values are n (%).

In this regard, youth with\nfirearms, who are more likely to also be\nbinge drinking and/or using illicit\ndrugs,includingdrinkingbeforeafight,\nincreases concerns about potential\nfirearm discharge. Interventions ad-\ndressing firearms among youth should\nalso assess and intervene for alcohol\nand otherdrug use to decrease the risk\nof harm with impulsive behavior that\nmay occur with youth and substance\nuse.\nSeveral study limitations are noted. Al-\nthough our sample reflected the racial\ncomposition of the city in which it was\nlocated, future studies are needed with\nsamples containing other racial/ethnic\ngroups. Causal attributions are not\npossible with a cross-sectional study\ndesign and the single urban site limits\ngeneralizability to other settings. Exclu-\nsion of patients presenting for suicidal\nideation and acute sexual assault may\nunderestimate true firearm-possession\nrates.Althoughapotentiallimitation,the\nuse of a self-report survey has been\nshowntohavehighreliabilityandvalidity\namong adolescents for self-reported\nrisk behaviors, including alcohol and\nThese findings have implications for\ninjury-prevention efforts at the com-\nmunity and law-enforcement levels in\ntermsof thehighnumbers offirearms\nobtained illegally, the ease of obtain-\ning illegal and highly lethal firearms,\nincluding automatic/semiautomatic\nweapons, diversion of legally obtained\nfirearms, as well as hospital ED\u00adbased\ninitiatives among assaulted youth\nseeking care. Previous research has\ndemonstrated the immediate post-\ninjury time is an ideal time to capitalize\non a teachable moment with preventive\ning, brief intervention, and referral to\ntreatment approaches have focused on\nstudy showing positive findings for\nintervening for both substance use and\nyouth violence among younger less\ntions for hospitalized assault-injured\nyouth have shown promise linking hos-\npitalized youth with community-level\ninjury-prevention interventions or case\nmanagement approachesfor youth with\nassault-related injuries may have the\npotential to decrease the likelihood that\na youth who is seeking care today with\nan assault-related injury will use a fire-\narm lethally or be a victim of firearm\nviolence.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors acknowledge Debra L.\nNovak-HaasandWendiMohlfortheiras-\nsistance in manuscript preparation.

    "reduced_content": "Firearm Possession Among Adolescents Presenting\nto an Urban Emergency Department for Assault\nWHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Violence involving firearms is\na leading cause of death among US youth ages 14 to 24. The\nemergency department is the primary medical setting for care of\nassault-injured youth and an underused but important setting for\nviolence-prevention programs.\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Among assault-injured youth seeking\nemergency department care, firearm possession rates are high,\nmost obtained outside of legal channels. Higher rates of negative\nretaliatory attitudes and substance use among those youth with\nfirearms increases risk of future lethal violence.\nabstract\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Firearm violence is a leading cause\nof death among youth. The objectives of this study were (1) determine\nfirearm possession rates and associated correlates among youth\nseeking care for assault in an emergency department (ED); (2) un-\nderstand differences in risk factors for youth with firearm posses-\nsion; and (3) identify firearm possession characteristics in this\npopulation: type, reason for possession, and source of firearms.\nMETHODS: Youth (14 to 24 years old) presenting to a Level 1 ED with\nassault were administered a computerized screening survey. Validated\ninstruments were administered, measuring demographics, firearm\nrates and characteristics, attitudes toward aggression, substance\nuse, and previous violence history.\nRESULTS: Among 689 assault-injured youth, 23% reported firearm\npossession in the past 6 months. Only 17% of those reporting\nfirearm possession obtained the gun from a legal source; 22%\nreported ownership of highly lethal automatic/semiautomatic\nweapons and 37.1% reported having a firearm for protection.\nLogistic regression analysis identified significant correlates of\nfirearm possession, including male gender, higher socioeconomic\nstatus, illicit drug use, recent serious fight, and retaliatory attitudes.\nCONCLUSIONS: ED assault-injured youth had high rates of firearm\npossession (23.1%), most of which were not obtained from legal\nsources. Youth with firearm possession were more likely to have\nbeen in a recent serious fight, and to endorse aggressive attitudes\nthat increase their risk for retaliatory violence. Future prevention\nefforts should focus on minimizing illegal firearm access among\nhigh-risk youth, nonviolent alternatives to retaliatory violence, and\nAUTHORS: Patrick M.
