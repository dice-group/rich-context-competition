Introduction\nThis paper analyses the development and the determinants of European financial\nintegration since the introduction of the euro with a special focus on investment behaviour\nduring the financial crisis. We will compare equity portfolio holdings of euro area investors\nin other euro area countries to those in major countries outside the monetary union. This\nshould reveal, to what extent investors regard the euro area as a single financial market,\nwhether this assessment has changed since the turbulence of the past years and how far\nfinancial integration in the euro area has caused a stronger exposure to international\nfinancial transmission channels during the crisis.\ninternational transmission channel of crises not only via the traditional trade links but also\nvia financial linkages, namely via the process of financial deleveraging. The process of\ndeleveraging, triggered by an adverse shock in the home or the host country, can entail\nstrong macroeconomic effects and also contribute to the contagion of third economies.\nPossible channels are the lower amount of loans provided by financial institutions to\nborrowers abroad, who may be faced with problems of revolving existing credits, or the\nvicious circle of deleveraging, falling asset prices and the detrimental effects on the balance\nsheets of other financial institutions that also need to deleverage as a consequence.\nAgainst this background, it is of interest to analyse financial integration on the sectoral\nlevel. We will differentiate for both the sector of investment and the sector of investor.\nDoing so, affords a better understanding of spill-over effects of financial shocks and may\ngive additional insight into the investment behaviour and risk attitude of various types of\ninvestors. Given the origins and the characteristics of the past crisis, the banking sector is\ndeemed to have played a key role in the spread of market disturbances and the subsequent\nrestructuring of financial assets.\n* For their valuable comments, we are indebted to Volker Clausen, Roberto A. De Santis, Ulrich Grosch,\nHeinz Herrmann, Sabine Herrmann, Robert E. Lipsey, Stefan Reitz, to the participants of the ESCB seminar\non Macro-Financial Risks and Vulnerabilities 14/15 June 2010 in Frankfurt am Main and to the participants\nof two internal workshops at Deutsche Bundesbank. The views expressed in this paper are those of the\nauthors and not necessarily the opinion of the Deutsche Bundesbank.\nA popular (inverse) measure of financial integration is the home bias in national portfolio\nholdings. According to the International Capital Asset Pricing Model (I-CAPM) of Solnik\n(1974), the composition of stock portfolios should be identical in all individual countries\nand correspond to the structure of world market capitalisation. Since the pioneering work\nof French and Poterba (1991), if not earlier, it has been well known that domestic investors\nof almost any country hold too little of their financial wealth in foreign assets when\ncompared with the benchmark of standard portfolio theory.\nThe existence of a home bias is commonly attributed to transaction and information costs,\nwhich are incurred in imperfect capital markets and encourage the holding of domestic\nstocks. In this vein, studies by Kang and Stulz (1997), Hau (2001), Ahearne, Griever and\nStultz and Warnock (2006) and Daude and Fratzscher (2006) find that information costs,\nlike telecommunication infrastructure or distance, have a major explanatory power for the\nobserved home bias.\nBy contrast, the influence of transaction costs is much disputed in the literature. Tesar and\nWerner (1995) argue that the large volume of cross-border capital flows and the high\nturnover rate of foreign equity investments relative to turnover on domestic equity markets\nsuggest that transaction costs are an unlikely explanation for home bias. Warnock (2002)\nchallenges the finding of a high turnover rate but confirms that transaction costs are an\nunlikely explanation. Other studies such as Faruqee, Li and Yan (2004), however, find a\nmajor explanatory power for corresponding variables, such as bilateral distance or bilateral\nphone costs.1\nAnother strand of the literature tries to explain deviations of portfolio holdings from the I-\nCAPM benchmark by additional classes of risk that are omitted in the basic model. While\nCooper and Kaplanis (1994) do not find evidence for the hypothesis that the preference of\ndomestic shares can be traced back to the hedging of domestic inflation, Fidora, Fratzscher\nand Thimann (2007) stress the segmenting effect of real exchange rate volatility. However,\nWincoop and Warnock (2006) conclude that the empirical correlation between excess\nequity returns and the real exchange rate is too low to explain observed equity home bias.\nIn response to this objection, Coeurdacier and Gourinchas (2009) show that while real\nexchange rate risks are indeed hedged through international bond holdings, domestic\nequities can provide a good hedge against non-financial income risk.\n1 Apparently, the distinction between variables representing information costs and transaction costs is not\nclear.\nThis paper ties in with the risk aspect of home bias and tries to find out, whether the\nperception of risk related to foreign assets differs with regard to investment outside and\ninside the euro area and with regard to different sectors. Besides real exchange rate\nvolatility, which can at the best explain the regional orientation of investors, we are looking\nfor additional aspects that might play a role in market segmentation.\nOur approach differs from the cited literature, in that it uses detailed databases of the IMF\nand the Deutsche Bundesbank, which have only recently become available. The IMF's\nCoordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) allows an exploration of bilateral\nportfolio holdings of euro-area countries since 2001 by including determinants of the\npartner countries and bilateral factors. In earlier studies, this was possible only for flows of\ninvestment, the structure of which, however, may deviate substantially from the regional\ncomposition of stocks. An even more detailed investigation of the regional and sectoral\ncomposition of German portfolio holdings can be undertaken using the German Securities\nStatistics Database of the Deutsche Bundesbank.\nWe find that financial integration is decisively more advanced within European Monetary\nUnion (EMU) than between member countries and countries outside the euro area. This\noutcome can partially be attributed to the abolition of exchange rate risk. Traditional\nindicators of information and transaction costs also seem to be relevant. In addition, the\nperception of sovereign risk became more important as a determinant of portfolio\nallocation during the financial crisis. In the years before the crisis, this aspect had\nobviously been neglected, and risk aspects have systematicly been \"underpriced\" in stock\nmarkets.2 On the sectoral level, the shares of financial corporations have been affected\ndisproportionately by reshuffling in security portfolios during the crisis. Furthermore,\ndeleveraging of monetary financial institutions also played an active role with respect to\nportfolio restructuring during the crisis.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section II gives a brief overview of\neconomic theory on portfolio holdings and home bias. Data are described briefly in\nsection III, before section IV highlights developments of home bias in euro-area countries\nand differences between intra and extra-EMU portfolio holdings. In section V, we analyse\nthe determinants of bilateral home bias, while section VI focuses on sectoral characteristics\nand the impact of the financial crisis on German portfolio holdings. Section VII concludes.\nII. The Concepts of Optimal Portfolio Selection and Home Bias\n1. Optimal Portfolio Selection\nAccording to Tobin's famous separation theorem \"... the proportionate composition of the\nnon-cash assets is independent of their aggregate share of the investment balance...\" if\nmarkets are purely competitive and investors are risk-averse.3 Following the notation of\nLintner (1965), expected returns and the variance of the total portfolio are given by4\n( ) ( )\nr\nr\nr\nP\nP\n-\n+\n=\n+\n-\n= \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n =\nwhere  = total expected returns, P\n= expected returns of the stock portfolio, r = riskless\nreturns of the bond portfolio, 2 = variance of returns of the total portfolio, 2\nP\n= variance\nof returns of the stock portfolio.\nBy combining investments in riskless bonds and a given market portfolio, an investor can\nrealise any point on the market opportunity line, which is given by the linear relationship5\n\n +\nwhere\nP\nP\nr\n\n\n\n-\n\ndefines the slope of the market opportunity line. Given the assumption that investors are\nrisk-averse, the optimal composition of the market portfolio can be derived by maximising\n subject to the share of individual stocks included in the portfolio. Under the assumptions\nmentioned above and if short-selling is permitted, the vector of optimal stock shares in the\nmarket portfolio is given by\n3 Tobin (1958, 85). While Tobin's original proof further relies on quadratic utility functions or multivariate\nnormal rates of return, Lintner (1965) has proved the separation theorem to be valid independently of these\nadditional assumptions.\n4 An equivalent model was developed by Sharpe (1963).\n5 If borrowing is unrestricted, the share of total wealth invested in the market portfolio () may even exceed\nunity.\n\n\n-\n-\n=\ne\ne\n\n'\n\n\nwhere  = variance-covariance matrix of returns, e\n= vector of excess returns over the\nrisk-free rate,  = unit vector.\nThe International Capital Asset Pricing Model (I-CAPM) developed by Solnik (1974)\nintroduces exchange rates as an additional aspect and derives important conclusions\nconcerning the diversification in stock and bond portfolios. While the stock portfolio is\nhedged against exchange rate risks, bond holdings are (only) speculative in the exchange\nrisk dimension. One important implication of the model is that the composition of stock\nportfolios is identical in all individual countries and corresponds to the structure of world\nmarket capitalisation. This market portfolio serves as a reference for the following analysis.\n2. Home Bias and Possible Extensions\nIn reality, most national stock portfolios differ from this benchmark, with domestic shares\nbeing relatively over-represented as against foreign shares. Referring to the pioneering\nwork of French and Poterba (1991), this phenomenon has become familiar as home bias\nand can be measured by the formula:\ni\ni\ni\ni\nf\nf\nhb\n\n\n-\n= ~\nwhere the subindex i indicates country i, i\ni\nf\nis the share of foreign stocks in country i's\nstock portfolio and\ni\nf\n~\ntheir weight in the world market portfolio.\nIf the index is unity, the domestic portfolio exclusively contains domestic shares, while a\nvalue of zero describes a perfect match of the domestic portfolio with the market\nportfolio.6 The index may also adopt negative values if foreign shares are over-represented\nwith respect to their share in the market portfolio.\n6 In the text and the figures, home bias is usually reported as a percentage. An increase of the home bias by\n1 percentage point indicates an increase in the under-representation of foreign stocks in domestic portfolios\nby 1% of their share in the world market portfolio.\nIn addition to the general home bias defined above, it is possible to calculate a bilateral\nhome bias vis-\u0155-vis an individual country or a specific region like the euro area. In this case\nequation (5) becomes\nj\ni\nj\nij\nf\nf\nhb ~\nwhere i\nj\nf is the share of country j's stocks in country i's stock portfolio and\nj\nf\n~\nis the share\nof country j's stocks in the world market portfolio.\nIII. The Data\nSince there is no single dataset that allows for a comprehensive investigation of home bias\nbefore and during the financial crisis, this paper draws mainly on two data sources, the\nCoordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\nand the German Securities Statistics Database of the Deutsche Bundesbank. To calculate\nportfolio holdings in Figure 1, we have furthermore used data of the IMF International\nFinancial Statistics database and the dataset on the External Wealth of Nations (EWN),\nprovided by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007).\nBilateral investment data for equity securities of ten EMU countries7 and three major non-\nEMU investment partner countries8 stem from the CPIS (Figure 2). The CPIS contains\nstock data for bilateral portfolio investment and was first edited for the year 1997. Starting\nin 2001, it is available on an annual basis.\nFor analysing investment behaviour during the financial crisis, we use quarterly data for\nGerman investments in the same countries as above from the German Securities Statistics\nDatabase. This contains sectorally disaggregated bilateral portfolio holdings for Germany\non a quarterly basis. Consistent data are available since the fourth quarter of 2007. The\nobservation period covered in the following analysis spans the period until the fourth\n7 Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Ireland\nand Luxemburg are excluded because of special factors related to their financial industry which heavily\ndistort their data of revealed home bias. For countries that joined the euro area after 2001, the relevant\ndatasets are still incomplete.\n8 Japan, United Kingdom and United States.\nData on market capitalisation stem from the ECB database on Security Issues Statistics,\nEurostat, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), the Federation of European\nSecurities Exchanges, and the World Federation of Exchanges.\nIV. Development of the Home Bias in EMU Countries\nFigure 1 depicts the historical development of general home bias from 1991 onwards. In\n1991, when the data were first collected, most countries exhibited very high values. Spain\nand Finland were close to 100%, France, Germany, Italy and Portugal ranged between 86%\nand 92%. In 1991, only Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands displayed values below 70%.\nUntil 1998 these values barely changed. Then, however, the solely lateral movement ended\nand a general decrease in home bias commenced. It was only in Greece and Spain that\ninvestors still display a strong bias towards investing domestically with a home bias of\nslightly above 80%. The Netherlands, with a home bias of only 12%, range at the other end\nof the scale.\nFigure 1: General Home Bias in the ten Euro-Area Countries (as a percentage)\nAustria Belgium Finland France Germany Greece Italy Netherlands Portugal Spain\nSources: European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund, Bank of International Settlements, Federation\nof European Securities Exchanges, World Federation of Exchanges, own calculations.\nFigure 2 illustrates the regional decomposition of home bias in portfolio holdings of intra\nand extra-EMU equity securities for the four biggest EMU economies from 1997\nonwards.9 As depicted, the data reveal a clear difference in home bias for intra and extra-\neuro-area investments. While the home bias for investments stemming from EMU investor\ncountries in Japan, the US and the UK remains at rather high levels, it has fallen distinctly\nfor investments within the euro area, especially during the first years after the introduction\nof the euro.\nFigure 2: Intra-EMU Compared with Extra-EMU Home Bias (as a percentage)\nGermany (intra) Spain (intra) France (intra) Italy (intra) Germany (extra) Spain (extra) France (extra) Italy (extra)\nSources: European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund, Bank of International Settlements, Federation\nof European Securities Exchanges, World Federation of Exchanges, own calculations.\nFor France, Germany, Italy and Spain, the extra-EMU home bias fluctuates around 90% in\nall the years displayed, whereas the intra-EMU home bias ranges perceptibly lower. In\nsome cases, negative values can be observed for the bilateral home bias between individual\ncountries, i.e. some countries \"overinvest\" in other countries compared with the I-CAPM\n9 Germany did not participate in the 1997 survey, which means that German data are available only for the\nbenchmark.10 However, we abstain from a graphical presentation of bilateral home bias for\nreasons of clarity.\nV. Determinants of Portfolio Holdings in EMU Member States\n1. Intra- and Extra-EMU Portfolio Holdings\nIn this section, we investigate the underlying causes of regional differences in equity\nholdings and, thus, in bilateral home bias as illustrated in section IV for the time up to the\nfinancial crisis. With data from ten EMU countries for the period 2001-2008, we perform a\npanel investigation of their bilateral holdings among each other as well as between them as\ninvestor countries and the top three non-EMU destinations, namely Japan, the United\nKingdom and the United States.11\nSeparate estimations for intra and extra-euro-area investments are performed. The\ncorresponding regression equation is12\n( )\nt\nij\nt\nw\nt\nj\nt\niw\nt\nij\nkap\nkap\nptf\nptf\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\nln\nln\nln\nln \n\n +\n+\n+\n-\n+\n=\n-\nt\nij,\nt\nij,\nrisk\n\ncost\nwhere\nj\ni\nptf\n,\ndenotes the part of country i's portfolio that is invested in equity securities of\ncountry j.\nw\ni\nptf\n,\nis country i's total equity portfolio,\nj\nkap country j's market capitalisation\nand kapw\nthe world portfolio. If investments followed the I-CAPM, we would expect\n to\nequal unity. Standard portfolio theory assumes that capital markets are perfect, i.e. there are\nno transaction costs, taxes or capital controls and no constraints on international capital\nflows.13 This implies that the traditional I-CAPM scenario ignores additional variables.\nIn reality, capital markets are far from frictionless. In order to explain the resulting\ndeviation of capital allocation from the benchmark, the I-CAPM has been augmented by a\nnumber of control variables representing information and transaction costs. They are\nsummarised by the vector costi,j\nin equation (8) and comprise the logarithm of distance\n10 Lane (2006) has also found a \"euro area bias\" of EMU member states for bond portfolios.\n11 For intra-EMU holdings, all country pairs are considered where both countries are members of the EMU.\nFor extra-EMU holdings, the analysis includes country pairs where the investing country is one of the ten\nEMU countries and the emitting country is Japan, the US or the UK.\n12 Linear regression estimates are performed using Stata 11.0 including AR(1) terms. When computing the\nstandard errors and the variance-covariance estimates, disturbances were assumed to be heteroskedastic and\ncontemporaneously correlated across panels.\nbetween the capitals of the issuing and investing countries (distij\n), a dummy variable that\ntakes the value one if the two countries share a common border and zero otherwise\n(neighbourij\n), the corruption perception index score published by transparency\ninternational (tpij\n) and the logarithmic number of analyst reports per company contained in\nthe IBES stock index (analystsj\n).14 In addition to these cost factors, various risk elements\nrepresented by the vector riskij\nmay also have a distracting effect on the allocation of\ncapital that goes beyond the potential of diversification in the world market portfolio. In\nour regressions, we have accounted for the bilateral exchange rate volatility (\nij\nfx ),\nmeasured by the coefficient of variation, to capture bilateral fluctuations, the role of the\nChicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index (VIX) as a measure of global\nuncertainty on stock markets as well as the price of credit default swaps for five-year\ngovernment bonds of country j (\nj\ncds ), which is used as a measure of sovereign risk\ndirectly perceived by the markets.15 Governments have played a crucial role in managing\nand alleviating the financial crises of recent years, which underlines the relevance of their\nown solvency for investors, even in the private equity segment.16 The incentives of\nforeigners to retreat their capital in order to escape the consequences of an imminent\nnational insolvency might be even more pronounced than for residents, who have to be\naware of potential repercussions on the national economic environment and will anyway\nstay within the grasp of their government. In addition, aspects beyond conventional yield-\nrisk optimisation may also play a role. Investors with a high preference for domestic shares\ngenerally seem to be led by other motives, as well. Consequently, they might be less\nsensitive to changes in domestic cds premia than investors with a more diversified stock\nportfolio.\nPerforming the regressions without control variables, i.e. testing the traditional I-CAPM,\nthe elasticity of portfolio holding,\n , significantly exceeds unity for intra-EMU\ninvestments and is less than unity for extra-EMU investments. The corresponding\nestimation is presented in the first column of Table 1 for investments within euro-area\ncountries and in the third column for investments outside the euro area. As the 95%\n14 Data for analysts are provided by Thomson Financial, Datastream. Alternatively to the number of\ncompanies, we have normalised the number of analysts by national market capitalisation. The estimation\nresults, however, alter only marginally.\n15 Data for VIX and CDS also stem from Thomson Financial, Datastream. An alternative measure, the\nsovereign bond spreads to German government bonds calculated on the base of benchmark yields published\nby the Bank of International Settlement (BIS), leads to very similar results for investments in other euro area\ncountries throughout all the following regressions. For investment in non-EMU countries, however, this\nindicator is less adequate, since it includes anticipated exchange rate changes. For a detailed discussion of\nEMU countries' sovereign bond spreads as a measure of market perceptions of default probabilities, see D\u00f6tz\nconfidence interval clearly demonstrates, in both cases the coefficient is different from\nunity. Thus, theoretical prediction and the real outcome do not coincide. This result points\nto a high reagibility of investors with regard to developments in other euro-area countries\nand to a high degree of financial integration and interdependency. It also corresponds to the\nelevated home bias of EMU countries vis-\u0155-vis countries outside the euro area that has\nbeen depicted in Figure 2 and is also consistent with the finding of De Santis (2010) and\nDe Santis and G\u00e9rard (2009), who determine that euro-area investors have increased the\nweight of portfolio investments in other euro-area countries due to the economic and\nmonetary union. Apparently, cross-border capital flows of euro-area countries are diverted\nto other EMU member states as a response to lasting frictions in the international financial\nmarkets.\nIncluding the traditional control variables, such as transaction and information costs, as\nwell as the inclusion of risk aspects shifts\n towards unity in both scenarios, intra and\nextra-euro-area. Results are depicted in the second and fourth columns of Table 1. Without\ncontrol variables,\nintra and extra-EMU investments respectively). The 95% confidence interval for those\ncoefficients clearly demonstrates that unity is included only in the comprehensive\n17 The confidence intervals are displayed in squared brackets, but only for national weights in the market\nportfolio as an explanatory variable. The reason for this is that, in this case, the coefficient equals unity under\n.

Explanatory Power of Control Variables on Home Bias\nAfter having shown that the inclusion of the control variables shifts the elasticity of\nportfolio holdings towards its theoretical benchmark in both samples, in this section we\nwant to further explore the explanatory power of control variables for the home bias. Thus\ninstead of regressing\nt\ni\nt\nj\ni\nptf\nptf\n,\n,\n,\nln\nln - on\nt\nw\nt\nj\nkap\nkap\n,\n,\nln\nln - and the control variables,\nwe regress home bias on the set of control variables introduced above:18\nt\nij\nt\nj\nt\nij\nhb\n,\n,\n,\n\n +\n+\n+\n= risk\n\ncost\n\nt\nij,\nwhere hbij,t\ndenotes the bilateral home bias in stock portfolios of country i vis-\u0155-vis\ncountry j (as a percentage).\nTable 2: Determinants of Home Bias in Intra- and Extra-EMU Investments\nEMU control Non-EMU control\nij\nhb\nij\nhb\nStandard errors in parentheses.\n*** (**) [*] denote significance at the level of 1% (5%) or [10%].\nTable 2 shows the results for intra-EMU and extra-EMU investments. In the intra-EMU\ncase, the coefficients for distij\n, and tpij\nare significant at the 5% level and have the expected\n18 Note that the bilateral home bias is defined as\nt\nw\nt\nj\nt\ni\nt\nij\nt\nij kap\nkap\nptf\nptf\nhb\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n= .\nsigns. The coefficients for analystj\nand neighbouri,j\nare significant at a 10%-level and also\nshow the expected signs. The more distant and the less transparent a country is, the greater\nis the preference for domestic investments. The closer the investor's home country is\nlocated to the seat of a company, the greater is his or her involvement. This relationship\nprobably reflects the ease of collecting information and similarity of institutions in both\ncountries. Sovereign risk measured by the price of credit default swaps for five-year\ngovernment bonds obviously had no detrimental effect on portfolio holdings during the\nsample period. This result gives support to the conjecture that solvency risks of EMU\npartner countries were often neglected before the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2007.19\nThe number of analyst reports per company has a slightly significant, positive impact on\nportfolio holdings within EMU member states. The inclusion of a global risk variable\n(VIX) did not increase the explanatory power of the estimates presented in this paper,\nwhich is probably due to the very limited number of varying values within the dataset. The\nsame is true of exchange rate volatility. For this reason, the variable has been excluded\nfrom the regressions. Since there is no exchange rate volatility within the currency union,\nthe respective variable has been omitted in this regression.\nFor extra-EMU investments tpij\ndoes not have a significant impact and neighbouri,j\nis zero\nthroughout as there is no common border between EMU countries and the US, the UK or\nJapan. The price of credit default swaps, which has so far failed to be significant, now\nenters the regression with a significantly negative impact on home bias. This somehat\ncounterintuitive outcome matches with the statement of Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2010),\nwho have observed a systematic \"underpricing\" of risk in the stock markets as a secondary\neffect of excessive profit seeking. The impact of analyst coverage on extra-EMU portfolio\nholdings is negative and leaves room for speculation that, during the observation period,\nanalysts might have sent disproportionately negative signals from these markets, a\nhypothesis that will be elaborated further in the next section.20 In line with the theoretical\nprediction and the empirical findings of Fidora, Fratzscher and Thimann (2007), the\ncoefficient for exchange rate volatility is positive and significant, implying that higher\nexchange rate volatility impaired investment of euro area member states in third countries\nand that the high degree of financial integration within the euro area can partly be traced\nback to the abolition of exchange rate risks.\n20 Neither the inclusion of a liquidity measure for the issuing market nor the use of country or country-pair\nfixed effects changes the signs or significance of the coefficients presented (except for\nj\ntpi in the intra-EMU\ncase, which turns statistically insignificant when country or country-pair dummies are included).\nVI. Sectoral Characteristics of German Home Bias\n1. General Developments During the Financial Crisis\nBesides the regional provenience of the securities under consideration, portfolio holdings\nand their reagibility to shocks may also depend on the sectoral category of both investors\nand shares. The German securities statistics database maintained by the Deutsche\nBundesbank provides a detailed insight into the sectoral and regional structure of securities\nheld in custody accounts at German banks. The data set used for the following analysis\ncomprises quarterly data from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2009. It\ntherefore covers the critical period when the financial crisis has spilled over from US\nmortgage companies to the worldwide capital markets and the real economy. This section\nfocuses on differences in the behaviour of German investors, depending on the sector and\nthe regional provenience of shares as well as investor category.\nIn addition to a regional disaggregation, the basic concept of home bias can be broken\ndown into several components, either by the sector of investment or the institutional sector\nof investors. These measures of sectoral home bias can be aggregated to the general home\nbias by using the weights of the respective sectors in the national portfolio holdings:\n( )\ni\nz i\nz\ni\ni\nz\ni\ni\nz i\nz\ni\nz\ni\ni\nz\ni\nz\nz\ni\nhb\nptf\nptf\nf\nf\nptf\nptf\nhb\nptf\nptf\nhb =\n-\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n-\n= \n\n\n\n\n~\n,\nwhere\ni\nptf is the market value of country i's stock portfolio and z is an index of sectors\nand can denote both the classification of shares or of investors.\nFigure 3 gives a brief overview of the sectoral composition and the development of home\nbias in German portfolio holdings since the beginning of the current financial crisis.21 We\ndistinguish between portfolio investments in monetary financial institutions (MFI),\ninsurance companies and pension funds (INS & PENS), mutual funds and other financial\ninstitutions (MUT & OFI), as well as non-financial institutions (Non-Fin). Apparently,\ngeneral home bias was tending to increase until the fourth quarter of 2008, which was also\nthe preliminary peak of the global financial crisis. Since then, it has been diminishing\n21 The observed changes in home bias are not necessarily due to portfolio shifts alone, but might also reflect\nvaluation effects. A more than proportionate fall in stock prices of foreign securities relative to the market\nvalue of German shares, for instance, results in an increasing (positive) home bias, even if no quantitative\nadjustments take place. However, if foreign shares are over-represented in German portfolios relative to their\nweight in the world market portfolio (negative home bias), the relation is reversed.\nagain. This course can be observed for both, investments inside and outside the euro-\nFigure 3: Composition of German Home Bias\nwith Regard to Sector of Investment (as a percentage)\na) against 11 EMU countries b) against Japan, UK and US\n-\n-\nSources: BIS, Deutsche Bundesbank, ECB, FESE, WFE, own calculations.\nApart from that, however, there are striking differences between portfolio holdings intra\nand extra-EMU. While German home bias is still substantial against Japan, United\nKingdom or the United States, securities of companies domiciled in euro-area countries\nabroad are even over-represented in German portfolios, when compared with the regional\ncomposition of the world market portfolio. This EMU bias, which is represented by a\nnegative bilateral home bias, is due primarily to a clear regional preference in the case of\nshares issued by monetary financial institutions (MFI). Changes in this sector are also the\nmost important driving force behind the overall development of the euro area bias during\nthe financial crisis, even if the weight of this sector in German portfolio holdings does not\nexceed 10%.23 With respect to the three big economies outside EMU, on the other hand,\n22 Home bias indices derived from the German securities statistics database cannot be compared directly with\nvalues based on the CPIS, since the former database comprises listed shares without differentiating between\nportfolio and foreign direct investment, while the latter database accounts for all shares and investment\ncertificates, but does not contain equity holdings that are classified as foreign direct investment.\n23 Similar to the dynamics of the overall home bias (see footnote 20), observed changes in sectoral home bias\nare not necessarily due to portfolio shifts alone. Other things equal, a relative decline in asset prices of a given\nsector will lower the weight of economies, which are specialised in this sector, in the world market portfolio.\nAs a consequence, the sectoral home bias measured by equation (7) will fall. Since this valuation effect would\ncounteract the impact of a potential capital retreat, the development of sectoral home bias might\nthe magnitude and the performance of home bias were clearly dominated by investments in\nnon-financial corporations. This impact corresponds to their weight of roughly 80% in\nGerman portfolios, while unweighted home bias is not particularly high in this sector,\ncompared with the bilateral home bias of the other sectors depicted in Figure 3.\nTurning to the institutional categories of portfolio holders, we again distinguish between\nthe four sectors defined above but add households as a fifth important group of investors.\nFigure 4 illustrates the various degrees of home bias with respect to investments inside and\noutside the euro area.\nFigure 4: Composition of German Home Bias with Regard to Type of Investor\n(as a percentage)\na) against 11 EMU countries b) against Japan, UK and US\nMFI INS & PENS MUT & OFI Non-Fin private HH\nSources: BIS, Deutsche Bundesbank, ECB, FESE, WFE, own calculations.\nIn all sectors, the degree of home bias is definitely higher against Japan, United Kingdom\nor the United States than against euro-area member states. Interestingly, the EMU bias\nalready identified above is caused by mutual funds and other financial institutions alone.\nDespite their high exposure to foreign markets, they reduced their positions abroad only\nmarginally and temporarily during the crisis. This might be due to the fact that fund\nmanagers have to take note of possible repercussions which arise from their market power\nor their commitment to given stock market indices. Insurance companies and pension\nfunds, which also had a preference for foreign EMU member states at the beginning of the\nobservation period, have continuously reduced their portfolio investment in these countries,\nunderestimate the restructuring in national portfolios. Provided that the impact of sector specific shocks on a\ncountry's market capitalisation as a share of the world portfolio is small, the valuation effect is limited.\nespecially since the beginning of 2009. Non-financial corporations almost exclusively hold\nGerman shares, which clearly points to investment motivations other than the Markovitz-\ntype yield-risk optimisation. The regional structure of investment was most volatile in the\nportfolio holdings of monetary financial institutions, which stood in the centre of the global\ncrisis. Households, by contrast, exhibit a relatively steady and modest degree of home bias.\n2. German Home Bias Depending on the Sector of Investment\nIn order to gain a better understanding of the possible determinants of the stylised facts\nidentified so far, and especially the behaviour of investors during the financial crisis, it is\nuseful to analyse whether investors discriminated between developments that occurred in\nthe crisis sectors and developments in industries that were affected only indirectly by the\nsubsequent distortions. As before, cost and risk denote vectors of variables related to\ntransaction or information costs and the actual or perceived investment risk, respectively.\nThe corresponding regressions are given by\nt\nj\nt\nj\ny\nt\nDj\nhb\n,\n,\n,\n\n +\n+\n+\n= risk\n\ncost\n\nt\nDj,\nwhere y\nDj\nhb denotes the size of home bias of German investors with respect to stocks of\nsector y in country j (as a percentage).24\nIn Table 3, estimates for aggregate investments of German investors (columns 1 and 6) are\ncompared with the parameters stemming from sector-specific estimates. We again\ndistinguish between euro-area and non-euro-area stocks. Apart from neighbourDj\n, which\nturns out to be insignificant due to a high correlation with distDj\nand Germany as the only\ncountry of reference, we use the same explanatory variables as in the previous section.\nObviously, the sovereign risk of the partner country significantly raises the bilateral home\nbias in stocks, i.e. investors seem to retreat into more familiar domestic areas whenever the\ngeneral investment climate in the foreign country becomes more uncertain. Within\nEuropean Monetary Union, this flight into the \"home haven\" is significant only for equity\nsecurities of monetary financial institutions and mutual funds (including other financial\ninstitutions), but not for stocks of insurance companies or pension funds and non-financial\n24 As in the previous section, regression estimates are performed using Stata 11.0 including AR(1) terms.\nWhen computing the standard errors and the variance-covariance estimates, disturbances were assumed to be\nheteroskedastic and contemporaneously correlated across panels. Country fixed effects collect otherwise\nneglected impact factors.\ncorporations. This differentiation can probably be attributed to the character of the\neconomic crisis, which is essentially linked to financial institutions with elevated risk\npositions and the prominent role of government support in managing the crisis. The\nportfolios of pension funds and insurance companies, which have to observe strict risk\npreventing rules, were less affected. Spill-over effects to the real economy only emerged\nwith some time lag and were cushioned by unprecedented economic stimulus packages.\nTable 3: Home Bias in German Stock Portfolios Depending on the Sector of Shares (IV/2007 \u00ad IV/200\noverall MFI INS & PENS MUT & OFI Non-Fin overall MFI INS & PENS MUT & OFI Non-Fin\ncdsj\nanalystj\ntpij\ndistij\nfxij\nStandard errors in parentheses.\n*** (**) [*] denote significance at the level of 1% (5%) or [10%].\nFor investments outside the EMU, credit default swaps also play a significant role,\nespecially with regard to MFI stocks. Furthermore, a slightly significant impact can be\ndetected for shares issued by non-financial corporations. Like in the general estimates for\nten euro-area countries, the number of analyst reports per company contained in the IBES\nstock index apparently plays a more important role for investments outside the euro area\nthan for intra-euro-area portfolio holdings. A possible explanation might be that, for intra-\neuro-area investments, other sources of information are also amply available. The negative\nimpact on extra-EMU portfolio holdings stated in section IV is reaffirmed for shares issued\nby monetary financial institutions, while the effect is positive elsewhere. This specification\nbacks the hypothesis formulated above that negative outlooks of analysts might have\naggravated the withdrawal of investors from crisis-ridden sectors and countries. The\ngeneral level of transparency as attested by transparency international proved to be non-\nsignificant in most cases, even if there is some evidence of a slight negative impact on the\nhome bias. Contrary to the results of the aggregate estimates, exchange rate risk apparently\nwas not decisive for the segmentation between intra and extra euro area investment during\nthe crisis. Instead, the geographical distance of the country of origin from Germany, which\nserves as a rough proxy of various transaction and information costs, had a more valuable\nimpact on investment decisions of German security holders.\n3. German Home Bias Depending on the Type of Investor\nWhile investment behaviour obviously varies according to the sector of equity securities, it\nmay also depend on specific characteristics of the investor. For example, it may be argued\nthat institutional investors are generally better informed than individuals and that non-\nfinancial corporations may have different investment principles than financial corporations.\nIn Table 4, estimates of portfolio holdings are presented which distinguish, first, between\ninstitutional investors of the sectors described above and private investors, as well as,\nsecond, investments within European Monetary Union and investments in the United\nKingdom, the United States or Japan. Again, we regress the home bias on a set of variables\nthat proxy information and transaction costs as well as on the price of credit default swaps\nand exchange rate volatility as risk elements. The corresponding regressions are given by\nt\nj\nt\nj\nx\nt\nDj\nhb\n,\n,\n,\n\n +\n+\n+\n= risk\n\ncost\n\nt\nDj,\nwhere x denotes the investing sector in Germany and x\nDj\nhb indicates the home bias of\nGerman investors belonging to sector x against stocks of country j.\nTable 4 reveals that sovereign risk of the host country was the most important driving\nforce of home bias during the observation period. The impact was generally higher for\nintra-euro-area investments. This elevated sensitivity might be a reaction to the previous\nnegligence of structural differences within monetary union that only became apparent with\nthe outbreak of the financial crisis.25 However, the estimated reagibility of monetary\nfinancial institutions, albeit positive, is not significant in statistical terms. This outcome\nindicates that the deleveraging process depicted in Figures 3 and 4 was triggered by\ninherent risks in the balance sheets of commercial banks rather than by exogenous risk\nfactors. Again, analyst coverage seems to reduce information asymmetry between domestic\nand foreign investors only for shares stemming from countries outside the euro area, and\neven there the impact was statistically significant only for investments of MFIs. The\ntransparency index is not able to explain changes in time or differences between sectors or\nregions. Exchange rate risk, which otherwise was not found to be decisive for German\ninvestment decisions, seems to have had a deterrent impact on portfolio investment of non-\nfinancial enterprises. However, this sector generally exhibits a very limited willingness to\nhold foreign securities (Figure 4). Distance again seems to collect a number of cost factors,\nwhich are relevant for all groups of investors except monetary financial institutions and\ncarry weight especially for investments outside the euro area.\n25 See D\u00f6tz and Fischer (2010), who identify a change of market perception of EMU sovereign bond risk\nsince March 2008. The authors argue that prior to the crisis government bonds of member countries had\ngenerally been assessed as homogenous in terms of risk, but that some countries have then lost their former\nrole as a safe haven. See also Lane and Ferretti (2010) for the \"underpricing\" of risk aspects prior to the\nfinancial crisis.\nTable 4: Home Bias in German Stock Portfolios Depending on the Investing Sector (IV/2007 \u00ad IV/2009)\noverall MFI\nPENS\nOFI\nNon-Fin private HH overall MFI\nPENS\nOFI\nNon-Fin private HH\ncdsj\nanalystj\ntpij\ndistij\nfxij\nStandard errors in parentheses.\n*** (**) [*] denote significance at the level of 1% (5%) or [10%].\nVII. Conclusion\nSummarising, we find that financial integration is decisively more advanced within\nEuropean Monetary Union (EMU) than between member countries and countries outside\nthe euro area. This outcome can partially be attributed to the abolition of exchange rate\nrisk. Traditional indicators of information and transaction costs also play a role. Sovereign\nrisks do not seem to have affected investment in equity securities prior to the crisis. The\nanalysis of German deposit statistics reveals a clear impact of the financial crisis on the\nregional and sectoral structure of German portfolio holdings. Prices of credit default swaps\nfor government bonds of the country of origin proved to be a significant determinant of\ninvestors' willingness to hold foreign stocks of this country. The retreat of German\ninvestors was more pronounced than that of domestic investors whenever the sovereign\nrisk of a foreign country was rising. This indicates that, besides the well-known flight to a\n\"safe haven\", which should be the same for all investors, there also exists a retreat into the\nfamiliar \"home haven\".\nAnother lesson that might be drawn from the analysis is that the financial sector is still at\nthe centre of the current crisis, and that the shares of financial corporations were affected\ndisproportionately by reshuffling in security portfolios. In addition, monetary financial\ninstitutions also played an active role with respect to portfolio restructuring during the\ncrisis. Their reorientation to domestic shares to the detriment of foreign stocks apparently\nreflects the deleveraging process that was triggered by inherent risks in their balance sheets\nrather than by exogenous risk factors. Insurance companies and pension funds as well as\nmutual funds and other financial institutions also reduced their risk exposure, but behaved\nin a less volatile manner on the whole. One possible explanation for this behaviour may be\nthat fund managers have to take note of possible repercussions which arise from their\nmarket power and the restrictive risk-preventing rules that apply to the governance of\npension funds and insurance companies.\nVIII.
