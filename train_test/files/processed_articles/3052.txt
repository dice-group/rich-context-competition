Cigarette smoking has been\ndescribed among college students, but little is known about noncigarette tobacco use\nby college students or cigar use by adults of any age.\nObjectives To assess the prevalence of all forms of tobacco use (cigarettes, cigars,\npipes, and smokeless tobacco) among US college students and to identify student-\nand college-level factors associated with use of each product.\nDesign The Harvard College Alcohol Survey, a self-administered survey conducted\nSetting One hundred nineteen nationally representative US 4-year colleges.\nSubjects A total of 14138 randomly selected students (60% response rate).\nMain Outcome Measures Self-report of current (in the past 30 days), past-year,\nand lifetime use of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, smokeless tobacco, and all tobacco\nproducts.\nResults Nearly half (45.7%) of respondents had used a tobacco product in the past\nyear and one third (32.9%) currently used tobacco. Cigarettes accounted for most of\nthe tobacco use (28.5% current prevalence), but cigar use was also substantial\nlence) and combinations of the 2 were common. Total tobacco use was higher in\ncigarette smoking rates between the sexes (28.5% for women vs 28.4% for men),\nsmokeless tobacco (current prevalence, 8.7% vs 0.4%; P.001) by men. Tobacco\nuse was significantly higher among white students (P.001), users of other sub-\nstances (alcohol and marijuana) (P.001), and students whose priorities were social\nrather than educational or athletic (P.05). Among students who had used both\ncigars and cigarettes, only 8.9% smoked cigars at an earlier age than they had\nsmoked cigarettes.\nConclusion Our study indicates that tobacco use is common among college stu-\ndents and is not limited to cigarettes. College appears to be a time when many stu-\ndents are trying a range of tobacco products and are in danger of developing lifelong\nnicotine dependence. National efforts to monitor and reduce tobacco use of all types\nshould expand to focus on college students and other young adults.\nin cigar sales presumably corresponds\nto an increase in cigar smoking preva-\nlence, but this is uncertain because re-\ncent data on the prevalence of cigar use\nare limited and not based on national\ngestthatcigaruseisincreasingmostrap-\nidly among young adults, who had the\nCigar smoking rates are higher among\nindividuals with more education and\nhigher incomes, a pattern opposite to\nthat observed for cigarette smoking.2,11\nHigh rates of cigar use were reported by\nadolescents in high school surveys con-\nThese adolescents may continue to\nsmoke cigars as they enter young adult-\nhood. These lines of evidence suggest\nthattheprevalenceofcigarsmokingmay\nbe especially high in college students. As\nyoung adults in the process of further-\ning their education, college students ap-\npear to fit the demographic profile of\nnew cigar smokers.\nConsequently, total tobacco use by\nyoungadultsmaybeconsiderablyhigher\nthan has been detected by previous\nanalyses limited to cigarettes.6 Little is\nknown about the full spectrum of to-\nbacco use among the college popula-\ntion or about risk factors for the use of\ndifferent tobacco products.8 This infor-\nmation is essential to guide the devel-\nopment of interventions. This article re-\nports the prevalence and patterns of use\nof all tobacco products among respon-\ncohol Survey, a large nationally repre-\nsentative sample of US college students.\nMETHODS\nSample of Colleges\nThe Harvard College Alcohol Study\nsurveyed randomly selected, cross-\nsectional samples of students in a na-\ntionally representative sample of 4-year,\nDetails of the method and sampling pro-\ncedures are published elsewhere.16,17 In\nleges that participated in the 1993 study\nwere resurveyed. Participating col-\nleges were sent guidelines for drawing\na random sample of undergraduates\nfrom their total enrollment of full-\ntime students. A sample of 225 was se-\nlected from each college. Nine (7%) of\nthe 128 schools were dropped from\nanalyses because of low response rates\n(less than 40% of eligible students\nresponding). The final sample was 119\ncolleges. Cigarette and cigar use rates\ndid not differ significantly between\nthese 119 colleges and the total sample\nof 128 colleges, indicating that omis-\nsion of the 9 schools had no effect on\nthe major variable under study.

Respondents' age\ndistribution closely matches that of stu-\ndents at all 4-year colleges.19\nQuestionnaire\nThe questionnaire assessed demo-\ngraphic and background characteris-\ntics; tobacco, alcohol, and other sub-\nstance use; satisfaction with education;\nand students' interests and lifestyle\nchoices.16,17 To assess tobacco use, re-\nspondents were asked if they had\nsmoked a cigarette, cigar, or pipe or\nused smokeless tobacco. For each, re-\nsponse options were \"never used,\"\n\"used, but not in the past 12 months,\"\n\"used, but not in the past 30 days,\" or\n\"used in the past 30 days.\" Also as-\nsessed were the number of days in the\npast 30 days in which a student had\nsmoked cigarettes and cigars and the\nage at which they first smoked these\nproducts.\nData Analysis\nFor each tobacco product, all students\nwho reported any use were considered\ntobeever(lifetime)users.Currentusers\nwere students who used the product in\nthe past 30 days. Past-year users\nreportedhavingusedtheproductinthe\npast year. Total tobacco use included\ncigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco,\nand pipes. Binge drinking was defined\nas drinking 5 or more drinks in a row\nfor men and 4 or more drinks in a row\nfor women during the previous 2\nweeks.20 Current marijuana users were\nstudents who had smoked marijuana in\nthe past 30 days. Other illicit drug use\nwasnotincludedintheanalysis,because\ncurrent use rates were very low.\nStatisticalanalyseswerecarriedoutus-\ning SAS statistical software (SAS Insti-\ntute Inc, Cary, NC). Univariate analy-\nses identified student-level and college-\nlevel characteristics associated with\ncurrent cigar, cigarette, smokeless to-\nbacco, and total tobacco use. Sociode-\nmographicfactorsincludedage,sex,eth-\nnicity, year in school, marital status, and\nhighest parental educational attain-\nment(aproxyforsocioeconomicstatus).\nOther student-level variables included\ncurrent marijuana use, binge drinking,\ngrade point average, a single-item mea-\nsure of satisfaction with education, an\nitem assessing the importance to a stu-\ndent of participating in 9 activities (eg,\nathletics, academic work, fraternity or\nsorority life, parties, and religion), and\nan item measuring the number of hours\nper week a student spent on 8 activities\n(eg,playingintercollegiatesports,study-\ning, socializing with friends). College-\nlevel factors included geographic loca-\ntion (West, South, North Central, and\nNortheast), campus location (rural or\nsmall town vs urban or suburban), size\ngious affiliation, coeducational vs all-\nfemale, competitiveness for admission\n(based on percentage of applicants ac-\ncepted), commuter vs noncommuter\nschool, and survey response rate.\nStudent-level and college-level fac-\ntors that were significantly associated\nwith cigar, cigarette, smokeless to-\nbacco, and total tobacco use in the uni-\nvariate analysis (P.001) were in-\ncluded in multiple logistic regression\nmodels. Separate models were built for\ncigar, cigarette, smokeless tobacco, and\ntotal tobacco use. Current use was the\noutcome variable for all models. All\nmultivariate models included sex, eth-\nnicity, year in school, marital status, and\nhighest parental educational attain-\nment. Two-way interaction terms of\nthese factors with sex were included in\nthe initial model, and those with sta-\ntistical significance were retained in the\nfinal model. Year in school was used in\nplace of age to examine the effect of du-\nration of exposure to the college envi-\nronment. Results do not differ when age\nis substituted in the models. Adjusted\nodds ratios (ORs) with 95% confi-\ndence intervals are reported. The final\nlogistic regression model was fitted by\nthe Generalized Estimating Equations\nworking correlation, to make more ro-\nbust inference using clustered out-\ncomes due to our sampling scheme.\nOdds ratios obtained from the Gener-\nalized Estimating Equations method\nwere almost identical with those from\nordinarylogisticregression,whereasthe\nSEs of ORs associated with the college\ncharacteristics were slightly larger. The\nGeneralized Estimating Equations\u00ad\nbased results are reported herein.\nRESULTS\nPrevalence of Tobacco Use\nMore than 60% of college students have\ntried a tobacco product, nearly half used\ntobacco in the past year, and one third\nused tobacco in the past month\n(TABLE 1).

More than one third of col-\nlege students have ever smoked a ci-\ngar, including more than half of the men\nand one quarter of the women. Nearly\n1 in 4 college students smoked a cigar\nin the past year, and 8.5% smoked a ci-\ngar in the past month. Most cigar use\nis occasional: less than 1% of current\n(past 30-day) cigar users smoked daily,\nand 89.7% smoked a cigar on fewer than\n5 of the past 30 days. Smokeless to-\nbacco use is much less prevalent than\ncigarette or cigar smoking. Pipe smok-\ning is rare.\nTable 1.

The most frequent combi-\nnations were cigarettes and cigars\nand cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless to-\nrent tobacco use was restricted to a\nsingle product. Among current users,\nthe most frequent combination was ci-\ngars and cigarettes.\nMen used multiple tobacco prod-\nucts more often than women; 58.2% of\nmen vs 27.5% of women had used more\nthan 1 tobacco product in the past year\nonly 10.6% of women had used more\nthan 1 tobacco product in the past\nmonth (P.001). The combination of\ncigarettes and cigars accounts for nearly\nall multiple tobacco product use in\nwomen and is by far the most frequent\ncombination among men.\nNoncigarette tobacco use occurs\nmore often in combination with ciga-\nrette use than in isolation. Among cur-\nrent cigar smokers, 33.4% smoked only\ncigars, whereas 61.4% smoked both ci-\ngars and cigarettes. Of current smoke-\nless tobacco users, 30.6% used only\nsmokeless tobacco, whereas 62.3% also\nsmoked cigarettes.\nAge of First Tobacco Use\nThe median age of first cigarette use was\n14 years for both sexes.

TABLE 4 displays the result\nof a similar analysis focused on stu-\ndent behaviors and lifestyles. Total to-\nbacco use is significantly (P.05)\nlinked with sex, ethnicity, marital sta-\ntus, other substance use, high-risk be-\nhaviors, and certain college lifestyles.\nMale and white students are more likely\nto use tobacco than female and non-\nwhite students (Table 3). Students who\nuse tobacco are also more likely to\nsmoke marijuana, binge drink, have\nmore sexual partners, have lower\ngrades, rate parties as important, and\nspend more time socializing with\nfriends (Table 4). Tobacco users are less\nlikely than nonusers to rate athletics or\nreligion as important and to be satis-\nfied with their education. Total to-\nbacco use is not related to parental edu-\ncational attainment. The only college-\nlevel factor associated with tobacco use\nis geographic location. Tobacco use is\nlower in western colleges (Table 3). Ex-\ncept for sex, these same factors are also\nindependently associated with cur-\nrent cigarette smoking.\nCigar smokers differ from cigarette\nsmokers in several ways. Men are far\nmore likely than women to smoke ci-\ngars. Blacks are as likely to smoke ci-\ngars as are whites. Like cigarette smok-\ning, current cigar use is associated with\nthe use of other tobacco products and\nother substances (alcohol and mari-\njuana) and is more common among stu-\ndents who express strong interest in\nparties. Unlike cigarettes, cigars are also\nTable 2.

It has the strongest as-\nsociation with male sex and white race\nof all tobacco products. Unlike ciga-\nrettes, it is just as common in the West\nas in other areas, and there is a trend\ntoward greater use by students en-\nrolled in colleges in rural areas or small\ntowns. Unlike cigarettes, smokeless to-\nbacco use is more common among in-\ntercollegiate athletes.\nCOMMENT\nThis study contains several new find-\nings. It demonstrates that tobacco use\namong college students is more preva-\nlent than previously appreciated, be-\ncause tobacco use is not limited to ciga-\nrettes. Cigar smoking is substantial, and\nsmokeless tobacco (and, rarely, pipes)\nare also used. Most tobacco users use\nmore than 1 tobacco product, with ci-\ngars and cigarettes being the most com-\nmon combination. Because men are\nmore likely than women to use non-\ncigarette tobacco products, overall to-\nbacco use rates are higher in men than\nwomen, despite identical rates of ciga-\nrette smoking. Whether the gap be-\ntween the sexes in noncigarette to-\nbacco product use will follow the\npattern of cigarettes and narrow in the\nfuture deserves to be monitored. In the\nmeantime, these data indicate that as-\nsessments limited to cigarette smok-\ning will underestimate the level of to-\nbacco use in the college population,\nespecially among men. This study also\nreports some good news. Cigarette use\nby college students, which increased\nprevious work suggested college is a\ntime of considerable flux in cigarette\nsmoking.6 Thisarticleextendsthatwork\nto show that college students are ex-\nperimenting with the full range of to-\nbacco products and that this is occur-\nring across all types of colleges. College\nstudents who use tobacco share many\ncharacteristics. They are more likely to\nbe white, single, and experimenting\nwith other risky behaviors, such as\nbinge drinking, using marijuana, and\nhaving more sexual partners. Tobacco\nuse also appears to be part of a college\nlifestyle that values social life over edu-\ncational achievement, athletic partici-\npation, or religion. A similar pattern was\nobserved in an analysis of predictors of\ncigarette use in the 1993 version of this\nsurvey.23 Although many of the same\ncharacteristics identify students who are\nlikely to use any tobacco product, this\narticle demonstrates that there are dis-\ntinctive patterns of cigar and smoke-\nless tobacco use that distinguish their\nusers from cigarette smokers.\nCigar smoking in the United States\nwas primarily a behavior of older men\nadults and few women smoked cigars.\nOur data demonstrate how much this\npattern has changed. Cigar use is now\ncommon among college students.\nAlthough it remains much more com-\nmon among men than women, an\nunprecedented number of female col-\nTable 3.

First, cigar use by freshmen and\nsophomores exceeds that of juniors\nand seniors. This pattern was not\nobserved for other tobacco products\nand was contrary to our expectation\nthat cigar smoking rates would\nincrease with more years of exposure\nto college. It suggests that the cigar\nuse is a new phenomenon entering\nthe college population. College stu-\ndent cigar use may increase in the\nfuture, as the cohort of juniors and\nseniors progresses through college\nand is joined by adolescents in whom\nond unexpected feature was the\nhigher rate of cigar smoking by black\nstudents. This is in sharp contrast to\nblack students' lower rate of all other\ntobacco product use. This preliminary\nfinding needs confirmation in future\nwork with larger samples. College\nstudents who use smokeless tobacco\nhave their own distinctive features.\nThey are predominantly white men\nwho attend schools in rural areas,\nthereby fitting the pattern of smoke-\nless tobacco use in the broader popu-\nlation.24 Intercollegiate athletes, in\nwhom cigarette smoking rates are\nlow, are more likely to use smokeless\ntobacco, perhaps as a substitute form\nof nicotine.\nAlthough the prevalence of tobacco\nuse by college students is high, the in-\ntensity of their tobacco use is low. One\nthird of cigarette smokers and 99% of\ncigar smokers do not smoke every day.\nEven this low level of use is a cause for\nconcern. Low levels of tobacco expo-\nsure for many years can produce sub-\nstantial morbidity and mortality, as re-\nsearch on passive smoking shows.25\nMore important, the intermittent use of\ncigars, smokeless tobacco, or ciga-\nrettes repeatedly exposes a user to nico-\ntine, a drug capable of producing physi-\ncal dependence. Low levels of nicotine\nexposure during college might evolve\nlater into nicotine dependence and daily\ncigarette smoking. Our data do not sug-\ngest that cigars act as a gateway to ciga-\nrette use in college students, since only\n9% of cigar and cigarette users smoked\ncigars first, but this issue deserves fur-\nther study. Cigar or smokeless to-\nbacco use might also contribute to the\npersistence of tobacco use in former\ncigarette smokers and thereby facili-\ntate a return to cigarette smoking. Ci-\ngar smoking among college students\nmay diffuse to other segments of the\npopulation, especially to children or\nadolescents, because of the effect of peer\nmodeling. The visibility of tobacco\nproducts on campus, even if used in-\ntermittently, sends a dangerous mes-\nsage about the social acceptability of to-\nbacco use. The broad use of tobacco\namong a substantial portion of 18- to\nTable 4.

One potential limitation is non-\nresponse bias. Although the survey re-\nsponse rate was 60%, the prevalence of\ncigarette smoking did not differ be-\ntween respondents and a sample of non-\nrespondents, and there was no corre-\nlation between smoking rates and\nresponse rates at individual schools. We\nattempted to control for potential bias\nby including college response rate as an\nindependent variable in multivariate\nanalyses. Students' self-report was our\nmeasure of tobacco use. Biochemical\nmeasures have established the validity\nof relying on self-reported smoking sta-\nporting of smoking status is probably\neven less likely in this survey, which fo-\ncused on alcohol rather than tobacco.\nCollege students comprise the larg-\nyears. This is the youngest age group\nthat tobacco manufacturers can le-\ngally target for marketing efforts. The\ncollege years are a crucial period in the\ndevelopment or abandonment of smok-\ning behavior.6 Tobacco use in this group\nshould be monitored closely, and young\nadults should be included in all to-\nbacco control efforts.\nColleges offer a potential site for\ninterventions to discourage tobacco\nuse. These efforts clearly need to\nbroaden beyond cigarettes to address\nthe use of cigars and smokeless\ntobacco. Colleges' alcohol and sub-\nstance use prevention and treatment\nprograms should address tobacco,\nbecause use patterns are so highly cor-\nrelated. Data from this study can help\ncolleges target interventions to the stu-\ndents at greatest risk of using specific\ntobacco products. These efforts should\nbe accompanied by environmental\nand policy changes that discourage\ntobacco use and reinforce the message\nthat nonsmoking is the norm. One key\ncomponent is to make college build-\nings, including dormitories and living\nquarters, smoke free. This policy pro-\ntects nonsmokers from passive smoke\nexposure and protects all students\nfrom the fire hazard of tobacco use in\ndormitories. It also limits the visibility\nand accessibility of tobacco products\nand may discourage initiation, help\nkeep occasional smokers from becom-\ning regular users, and boost the suc-\ncess of smokers who are trying to quit.\nReducing tobacco use of all types\namong young adults should be a\nnational health priority.\nAuthor Affiliations: Tobacco Research and Treat-\nment Center, Division of General Medicine, Depart-\nment of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital,\nand Harvard Medical School (Dr Rigotti), and Depart-\nment of Health and Social Behavior, Harvard School\nof Public Health (Drs Wechsler and Lee), Boston, Mass.\nFinancial Disclosure: Dr Rigotti currently receives grant\nsupport from Glaxo Wellcome Inc.
