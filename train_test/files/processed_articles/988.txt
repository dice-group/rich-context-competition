The prevalences of overweight and obesity are\nrising among adults simultaneously with high rates of\nundernutrition among children1 \u00ad7. Consequently, nutri-\ntion-related chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular\ndisease and diabetes, are emerging as concerns in\ndeveloping countries8. These concerns are combined\nwith the continued need to address undernutrition and\ninfectious disease. Overweight and obesity are increasing\nin Chile among low-income groups and poor commu-\nnities9. There is a triple burden of disease in South Africa,\ndescribed by Vorster10. These are poverty-related infec-\ntious diseases, including HIV/AIDS, violence-related\ninjuries and an increase in lifestyle-related non-commu-\nnicable diseases. The burden of obesity and cardiovas-\ncular disease in the more developed regions of Brazil is\nalso emerging among the poor11. As nutrition-related\nchronic diseases become more prevalent, limited\nresources will be further strained by the simultaneous\ncost of addressing infectious disease and undernutrition,\nwhile treating nutrition-related chronic diseases. Early\nprevention is essential in order to prevent the epidemic. As\nReddy8 states in this supplement, prevention is a\nnecessary, cost-effective means of avoiding the high\nsocial, biological and economic costs of a treatment-based\napproach to nutrition-related chronic diseases. Thus, as a\npart of this meeting, we considered programmes in\ndeveloping countries that have sought to intervene early\nto prevent obesity and nutrition-related chronic diseases.\nParticipants\nThere are few examples of large-scale interventions that\nfocus on diet and activity patterns related to nutrition-\nrelated chronic diseases in developing countries. There-\nfore, we queried the participants of the meeting for\nexamples from their countries (Brazil, Chile, China, Cuba,\nEgypt, India, Iran, South Africa, South Korea, Malaysia,\nMexico, Morocco, Thailand and Tanzania) of large-scale\nprogrammes to prevent obesity to change sedentary\nbehaviours, or to address diet as related to chronic disease.\nThis is the focus of this summary paper. Interventions and\nprogrammes related to undernutrition are not included.\nOnly a few pilot projects that will eventually become\nlarger-scale interventions and innovative, smaller studies\nare included. Since limitations of space preclude a\ncomprehensive report, we summarise the key results.\nLarge-scale and monitoring programmes\nAssessment of the extent of overweight, obesity and\nnutrition-related chronic diseases is critical to addressing\nthe problem. Therefore, we first consider whether the\ncountries represented in this meeting have established or\nare establishing large-scale programmes and/or monitor-\ning systems. Monitoring systems include diachronic,\nnationally representative surveys that assess the preva-\nlence of overweight, obesity or nutrition-related chronic\ndiseases. A large-scale monitoring system is being built in\nBrazil. Chile, China, Cuba, Iran, India, South Africa, South\nKorea and Thailand have large-scale monitoring systems\nin place. There is a large-scale monitoring system in\nMorocco specifically for cardiovascular disease. The\nremaining countries \u00ad Egypt, Malaysia, Mexico and\nTanzania \u00ad either have large-scale cross-sectional surveys\nthat are not monitoring systems, or monitoring is through\nsmall surveys often related to research.\nSchool programmes\nNext we considered large-scale interventions or pro-\ngrammes oriented towards obesity and nutrition-related\nchronic diseases. Eight of the 14 countries represented\nhave large-scale school-based interventions or pro-\ngrammes. Brazil has recently included, in the national\nschool meals programme, the requirement that 70% of the\nfoods be basic foods or minimally processed foods.\nChile has included more fruits and vegetables in the\nnational school meals programme and is developing\neducation programmes on nutrition and physical activity\nin schools. There is also a growing `healthy schools'\ninitiative focused on nutrition, physical activity, smoking\ncessation, environment and psychosocial risk factors that\ncurrently include more than 1000 schools. As described by\nZhai et al.12 in this supplement, the Ministry of Education\nin China has asked schools to increase time for physical\nactivity. There have been large-scale nutrition education\nprogrammes in the schools in South Korea and dietitians\nare involved in the school meals programme. There is a\nmulti-centre nutrition education programme in Malaysia.\n*Corresponding author: Email doak@unc.edu\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Pilot interventions in Mexico have been\ninitiated to address child obesity, the goal of which is to\nincrease physical activity and to promote knowledge of\nnutrition among children. There is a `healthy schools'\ninitiative in South Africa that includes a focus on obesity\nand nutrition-related chronic disease prevention. Finally, a\nschool-based programme began in Thailand in September\n2001. This programme, in regional primary and secondary\nschools, focuses on physical activity and a healthy diet.\nWorkplace programmes\nWhereas schools are a convenient means of reaching\nchildren, the workplace is ideal for interventions reaching\nadults. It is not surprising to find that five countries have\nlarge-scale interventions or screening programmes at\nwork sites because adults are the first group to be affected\nby nutrition-related chronic diseases. The healthcare\nsystem in Cuba for the prevention of nutrition-related\nnon-communicable diseases has been extended to the\nworkplace. Work sites in Chile are used for screening risk\nfactors for non-communicable diseases. A large-scale\nintervention in India at multiple work sites incorporates\nexercise, changes in the cafeteria menus and family\nnutrition counselling. South Korea also has large-scale\ninterventions or screening programmes at work sites that\ninclude regular health examinations as well as health and\nnutrition education and counselling. The promotion of\nphysical activity in Thailand in the workplace is among the\nstrategies of health promotion in the National Plan,\nalthough implementation of this varies by region. On a\nsmaller scale, there are selected work site programmes in\nTanzania that focus on exercise.\nCommunity-oriented programmes\nAlthough school-based and work site programmes target\nlarge numbers of individuals, seven countries have large-\nscale studies focusing at the community level. There is a\nlarge-scale, multi-level, community-wide intervention in\nBrazil promoting physical activity through culturally\nappropriate means. This programme, known as Agita, is\ndescribed in detail in this supplement by Matsudo et al.13.\nWithin Brazil the programme is being extended to other\ncommunities, and the image and messages are adapted to\nmake it culturally appropriate. In their paper focusing on\nChile, Albala et al.9 describe the health promotion policy.\nThis policy focuses on food, nutrition, physical activity and\nother risk factors for nutrition-related chronic diseases in\nan integrated way at the county and small community\nlevel. There are large-scale community education and\nhealth promotion programmes in China to reduce\nhypertension. Large-scale community programmes in\nCuba promote physical activity, diet change and education\nfor the prevention of nutrition-related chronic diseases.\nHealth promotion related to nutrition-related chronic\ndiseases in Mexico is in progress. In South Korea, nutrition\nand health services are available through the nation-wide\ncommunity health centres. Dietitians have further sup-\nported the nutrition services of 32 test community health\ncentres. This programme is expected to be expanded\nnation-wide. Finally, community programmes in Thailand\nfocus on physical fitness and healthy eating for the elderly.\nWith the exception of Thailand, which focuses on the\nelderly, these community interventions generally reach\nindividuals of all ages.\nOther programmes\nOther large-scale interventions and programmes are good\nexamples of the types of intervention that can be emulated\nelsewhere. There is an annual healthy lifestyle campaign\nin Malaysia. Although the specific focus changes each year,\nthis event has included a focus on lifestyle related to\nnutrition-related chronic diseases. Such programmes\nincrease awareness of non-communicable disease and\nrelated lifestyles, such as physical activity and diet.\nNational campaigns in Thailand for nutrition-related\nchronic disease prevention focus on screening and\nmanagement of nutrition-related chronic diseases such\nas hypertension and diabetes. All levels of the national\nhealthcare system in Cuba address non-communicable\ndiseases, including both prevention and control. A large-\nscale initiative related to diabetes prevention in Iran\nincludes screening, intervention, control and education. In\nthe north-west province of South Africa, an intervention\namong farm dwellers seeks to bring both overweight and\nunderweight individuals to optimal health. This type of\nprogramme is innovative and unique, and is an example of\nthe kind of programme needed in communities facing\nboth kinds of malnutrition. Another intervention in South\nAfrica is a television soap opera series called Soul City.\nThis programme targets low-income groups and includes\nhealth messages addressing both undernutrition and\noverweight, with a sister radio programme for those\nwithout access to television. Finally, the National Health\nPromotion Act of 1995 in South Korea included a call for\ndiet and activity interventions to address nutrition-related\nchronic diseases and obesity prevention. Furthermore,\nnutrition specialists in South Korea have encouraged and\npromoted the traditional diet, which is low in fat and high\nsupplement, the consumption of local foods and\nagricultural products was encouraged to protect local\nfarming. The government actively conserved the tra-\nditional diet through training housewives to cook the\ntraditional cuisine14. South Korea provides an example of\na country with a healthy traditional diet that was preserved\nthrough the joint efforts of dietitians and the government.\nThese programmes show that innovative interventions\nC Doak\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

The pro-\nactive policy of South Korea to preserve the healthy\ntraditional diet may explain why that country has not\nexperienced the levels of obesity and overweight that\nwould otherwise have been expected. The example of\nAgita in Brazil provides a theoretical framework and\nscientific model for interventions related to physical\nactivity. The South Africa farm-dwellers initiative provides\nan example of a programme that addresses both under-\nnutrition and overweight simultaneously. However, many\ncountries have only recently become aware of nutrition-\nrelated chronic diseases as a problem. In these countries,\nthere is the potential to prevent sedentary behaviours and\ndietary patterns related to chronic disease risk before these\nbehaviours become established. The most promising\nprogrammes are those that address the needs and\nconcerns of the target communities using culturally\nappropriate methods and messages.\nReferences\n1 Crooks DL.
