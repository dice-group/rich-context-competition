The crisis has also\nshown that bundling credit risk into innovative products and selling it at the capital markets\ndoes not necessarily result in diversification benefits. The importance of credit risk is also\nclearly reflected in the Basel II framework, which foresees wide-ranging instruments to\nmeasure and control credit risk, both under Pillar I, but also under Pillar II. Recently, the\ninterest is more and more moving towards the Pillar II arena, with validation, concentration\nand stress testing being the most important instruments.\nThe application of Pillar II measures does require data, which turns out to be a major shortage\nin most financial institutions. There have been various measures to overcome this shortage,\nbut this has also been the major reason why internal credit portfolio models were not (yet)\nrecognized under Basel II. The lack of data results to publicly available empirical studies on\nPillar II issues being very rare.\nThis is the starting point of this study, which focuses on micro stress testing, i.e. stress testing\nof single banks' credit portfolios. The data are mostly taken from Deutsche Bundesbank's\nbalance sheet data, amended by German credit register data, data from the German Statistical\nOffice, S&P and Moody's KMV. In this way, three credit portfolios resembling those held by\nsmall, medium-sized and large German banks are composed.\nThe study investigates univariate and multivariate stress scenarios. Based on the Basel II IRB\nmodel, the PD is stressed by 5% up to 50% in form of a univariate sensitivity analysis. In\naddition, historical simulation based stress testing with a combined stress of the PD by 61%\nand the LGD by 51% is being applied. The outcome shows that portfolio differences do not\nmaterialize and that the combined effect of a stress of several parameters leads to a more than\nadditive effect. Furthermore, it turns out that univariate PD stress by 10% in relative terms\ntranslates into an increase of IRB capital requirements by 4% to 5.5% and that the adverse\nhistorical scenario can result to an increase of IRB minimum capital requirements by up to\n80% within one year. In the next step, a simulation based model resembling the Basel II IRB\nmodel is used to additionally stress correlations by 10%, 20% and 71%. It turns out that\nportfolio differences start materializing and that the credit Value-at-Risk may increase by up\nto 300% within one year if a severe historical scenario is being applied, denoting a joint stress\nof the PD by 61%, 51% of the LGD and 71% of asset correlations.\nOverall, the outcome shows that stress testing can be perceived as an important means to\ninvestigate potential adverse effects and to test the sensitivity of credit portfolios to various\ndifferent shock events.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nDie Immobilienkrise in den USA hat erneut gezeigt, welche zentrale Rolle Kreditrisiken f\u00fcr\ndas Auftreten von Bankenkrisen und f\u00fcr die Finanzstabilit\u00e4t spielen k\u00f6nnen. Die Krise zeigt\naber auch, dass die Nutzung von modernen Finanzinstrumenten zum Verkauf von Kreditrisiko\nan den Finanzm\u00e4rkten nicht notwendigerweise zu Diversifikationseffekten f\u00fchren.\nDie hohe Bedeutung von Kreditrisiken f\u00fcr Banken spiegelt sich auch in Basel II wider,\nwelches zahlreiche Ma\u00dfnahmen zur Messung und Steuerung von Kreditrisiken sowohl in\nS\u00e4ule 1, als auch in S\u00e4ule 2 vorsieht. In letzter Zeit r\u00fcckt der Fokus immer mehr auf S\u00e4ule 2,\nund damit auf die Anwendung von Validierungsmethoden, Konzentrationsrisiko-\nUntersuchungen und Stress Tests.\nDie Anwendung von Instrumenten der S\u00e4ule 2 erfordert jedoch umfangreiche Daten, die\nvielfach nicht verf\u00fcgbar sind. Trotz zahlreicher Anstrengungen, die Datensituation zu\nverbessern (z.B. Pooling von Daten, systematisches Sammeln von Daten) war dies auch ein\nzentraler Grund f\u00fcr die nicht erfolgte Anerkennung von internen Kreditrisikomodellen in\nBasel II. Dies ist auch die Ursache daf\u00fcr, dass es bisher kaum \u00f6ffentlich verf\u00fcgbare\nempirische Studien zum Problemkreis S\u00e4ule 2 gibt. Hier setzt die vorliegende Studie an, die\nsich mit dem Thema Stress Testing von Bankenportfolios besch\u00e4ftigt.\nDie in der Studie verwendeten Daten stammen insbesondere aus der Bilanzdatenbank der\nDeutschen Bundesbank, sowie aus weiteren hochwertigen Quellen wie der\nMillionenkreditdatenbank der Deutschen Bundesbank, dem Statistische Bundesamt, S&P und\nMoody's. Durch Verkn\u00fcpfung dieser Daten stellen die Autoren typische Kreditportfolios f\u00fcr\nkleine, mittlere und gro\u00dfe deutsche Banken zusammen.\nIn der Studie werden sowohl univariate als auch multivariate Stress-Szenarios f\u00fcr die IRB\nKreditrisikoparameter untersucht.

Die Anwendung von Stress Tests mit Hilfe des Baseler IRB\nModells zeigt, dass Portfoliounterschiede hinsichtlich der Auswirkungen von Krisenszenarien\neine untergeordnete Rolle spielen, und dass sich der gemeinsame Effekt eines Schocks\nmehrerer Kreditrisikoparameter \u00fcberproportional auswirkt.

While validation\naspects have widely been discussed and various solutions were suggested (BCBS 2005),\ncredit risk stakeholder only more recently focus more intensely on concentration risk and\nstress testing. The reason is two-fold: First, many financial institutions face data shortages\nparticularly in the domain being relevant for Pillar II (for example correlations) and real\nportfolio data are unlikely to be disclosed. Given that the availability of meaningful data\nconstitutes a fundamental prerequisite for Pillar II analysis, concentration risk and stress\ntesting have hardly been addressed in the empirical financial literature. This is what the\ncurrent study aims at, namely to reveal Pillar II analysis for real portfolios.\nOur empirical analysis is based on balance sheet data of Deutsche Bundesbank, which have,\nin the first step, been applied to the analysis of the portfolio of the Pensions-Sicherungs-\nVerein (PSVaG). The PSVaG is a mutual insurance organization for occupational pension\nschemes in Germany and its portfolio is a cross-sectional representation of the German\neconomy.3 The well recorded track record of the insurance scheme of more than 30 years is\nexceptional and goes far beyond most credit portfolios in banks. The Bundesbank balance\nsheet data applied to the analysis of the PSVaG `from the outside' are used to estimate\nindividual probabilities of default (PDs) for the firms in the database underlying this study.\nNext, the balance sheet data are used as a starting point to compose three credit portfolios for\nsmall, medium and large German banks. In this way, we seek to overcome in a pragmatic way\nthe lack of real Pillar II portfolio analysis in the literature to date, exceptions being Peura and\n1 We thank Thilo Liebig and Peter Raupach for valuable comments and support.\n3 Traditionally, German companies use a book reserve system to finance occupational pension schemes. Pension\nliabilities appear on the balance sheet and are reported in a uniform manner. By nature they are not funded and\nconstitute unsecured debt. The portfolio of the PSVaG can, in fact, be treated as a credit portfolio of\nstandardized loans where the pension liabilities of the corporations are the insured exposure.\nCredit portfolio stress testing is being applied in the form of univariate and multivariate stress\ntests to different credit portfolios both by using the Internal Rating based (IRB) model as well\nas by applying a simulation based one-factor model that additionally allows for a variation of\ncorrelation. Stress tests are generally applied across the whole portfolios in a uniform way.\nA severe multivariate scenario based on historical data for Germany shows an increase of IRB\nminimum capital requirements by more than 80% with little differences between the credit\nportfolios. If stress testing is additionally applied to correlation, portfolio differences start\nmaterializing and the credit Value-at-Risk may increase considerably by up to 300%.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we provide an overview on the database, on\nPD estimation and the portfolios used for stress testing. Section 3 outlines the methods used\nfor credit portfolio analysis and stress testing. In section 4, we present the results. Section 5\nconcludes.\nThis study is based on the balance sheet database of Deutsche Bundesbank, complemented\nwith data from the German credit register, the German Statistical Office, from S&P and\nMoody's KMV (MKMV). The data are being used to ensure that the portfolios being\nanalyzed in this study resemble those held by German commercial banks, i.e. take the form of\nreal portfolios. Most of the data has been taken from Deutsche Bundesbank's balance sheet\ndata, namely the universe of portfolio data as well as the probability of default (PD)\ninformation calculated from the database. In the next step, credit register data has been used to\nensure that the credit portfolios referred to, namely a portfolio of a small German bank, a\nmedium-sized one and a larger one are realistic. Finally, we made use of MKMV data to\ndetermine firm-size dependent individual correlations. For the stress tests, historical data from\nthe German Statistical Office and S&P are used.\n2.1 Balance Sheet Data\nAs a means to ensure the representativeness of the balance sheet data referred to in terms of\nthe PDs for the German economy, we first benchmark the initial data to the portfolio of the\nPensions-Versicherungs-Verein (PSVaG). The PSVaG is the German counterpart to the\nPension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) in the United States, ensuring occupational\npensions against bankruptcy. Like the PBGC the PSVaG was founded in 1974. The PSVaG\noperates as a private mutual insurance association with compulsory membership for all firms\nrunning pension plans which might be adversely affected in the case of bankruptcy. It is\nregulated by the German federal financial supervisor (\"Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr\nFinanzdienstleistungsaufsicht\").\nThe balance sheets of the firms ensured by the PSVaG have been identified in a\nstraightforward way in Bundesbank's balance sheet data, namely by the accrued book\nreserves corresponding to the present value of the pension commitments appearing as\nliabilities on their balance sheets. The reason for that is that Germany is one of the few\ncountries where the internal financing of pension obligations via book reserves is an accepted\nstandard. The reporting of pension liabilities follows strict rules. It is based on a uniform\ndiscount rate of six percent and standardized biometric assumptions. The pension liabilities\nare unsecured debt and no separate funding is required.4 We can therefore directly link the\nrisk faced by the PSVaG to the default risk of its counterparties.\nThe portfolio of the PSVaG becomes a credit portfolio as the pension obligations are mutually\ninsured by the Pensions-Sicherungs-Verein VVaG for the case of insolvency. The portfolios\ncredit volume is extensive, with a total notional value of insured pensions (i.e. credit\nBy means of the balance sheet database of Deutsche Bundesbank, we can directly observe\nabout 70 percent of the total portfolio volume of the PSVaG from the outside based on\nthe book reserves make up an average of 10.8% of the balance sheet total. The\nrepresentativeness of the data has carefully been ensured by benchmarking our dataset to\npublicly available information as well as structural data on the PSVaG, namely historical\ninsurance losses over the period from 1975 to 2004, the annual total volume of insured\npensions, and the size and default information structure of the PSVaG portfolio.5\n4 In principle, a company running a pension plan on book reserves could issue a corporate bond and use the\nproceeds to finance a (Anglo Saxon type) pension fund. Thereby, pension liabilities are cancelled out of the\nbalance sheet and the new corporate bonds appear on balance sheet. The opposite process is also possible.\nTreynor (1977) and Gerke et al. (2005) show within an augmented balance sheet approach that pension\nliabilities and pension fund assets should be added to the corporate balance sheet for an economic analysis.\nHistorically, the book reserve system was seen as a way to keep cash flows as long as possible within the\ncorporation.\n5 More specifically, when cross-checking the portion of bankruptcy cases in the Bundesbank database against\nthe corresponding portion of defaults of the PSVaG, we found that the Bundesbank database contains a\ndisproportionate (lower) number of bankruptcies. To account for this fact and to prevent estimation bias we\napplied weighted default probabilities. Moreover, as a second measure to preclude a potential quality bias in\nthe sample that has been found for smaller firms since 2000 (see Ismer et al. (2007, in German), who found\nthat Bundesbank's balance sheet dataset is representative for medium-sized and large companies), we\nexcluded corporations with pension provisions below Euro 100,000, also as they account for less than two\nTable 1 summarizes the premium history of the Fund, which closely resembles the historical\nannual portfolio loss, for the last three decades, ranging from 0.03% to 0.69%, the primary\ninformation that has been used to benchmark the Bundesbank data with PSVaG data.6\nTable 1: Descriptive statistics on the Annual Insurance Premiums of the PSVaG\nTable 1 shows the annual insurance premiums (corresponding to credit portfolio losses) of the portfolio of the\nGerman pension insurer (Pensions-Sicherungs-Verein VVaG, PSVaG) for the period from 1975 to 2006.

As shown in Table 2, six regression variables\n(\n,\ni j\ny ) were used, namely four financial ratios and two sector dummies to distinguish the\ndefault industry, industrials from the trade sector and the remaining industry sectors. We also\nincluded year dummies in order to control for macroeconomic effects by means of a panel\nregression model, but it turned out that the results were similar overall, so we referred to the\ncross-sectional model, calibrated on data covering two economic cycles with both benign\nepochs as well as periods of severe macroeconomic stress such as the Asian and Russian\ncrisis, respectively. The calibration of the level of the PDs to the PSVaG was done as follows:\nFirst, we used balance sheet data with a time gap of 12 to 24 months prior to default to\ncharacterize insolvent firms. Second, due to missing bankruptcy data in the data sample to\npercent of the total exposure and are therefore of subordinated importance in terms of credit portfolio risk.\n6 This information is not explicitly used for portfolio analysis, but implicitly included in the PDs calculated\nbased on the logit model as outlined below.\nrepresent the default history of the German Pension Fund, equation (1) has been estimated\nbased on a weighted logit procedure to correct the bias towards underreporting bankruptcies.7\nTable 2 shows the outcome of the regression: all variables are highly significant and the signs\nof the variables are as expected (see Gerke et al. 2008). The discriminatory power of the\ncalibrated logit model yields an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve\nof 0.8181, constituting an equivalent level with other empirical studies.8\nTable 2: Outcome of the logistic regression model\nThe table displays the outcome of a cross-sectional logistic regression for the portfolio of the PSVaG.

This PSVaG portfolio (PF0), being diversified in terms of industrial and\ngeographical sectors, will be considered as a cross-sectional portfolio of the German\neconomy.9 Besides, three bank portfolios have been composed as further explained below.\nweighted mean PD for the 2002 portfolio, 0.4% (see Table 1), closely resembles the portfolio\nlosses communicated by the PSVaG for this time (see Gerke et al., 2008), indicating that 2002\nwas a worse than average year in cyclical terms when compared to the 30-year average\nportfolio losses of the PSVaG (0.22%). To arrive at credit portfolio analysis additional\nparameters are required, namely the Loss Given Default (LGD), the Exposure at Default\n(EAD) and credit correlations. For the PSVaG which does hardly apply a work-out process,\n7 The reason is that bankruptcies mainly occurred for small firms which are less represented in the dataset.\n8 For Moody's RiskCalc model for Germany, the area under the ROC curve yields to 70.9%, being\nsubstantially lower that in the underlying study, see Escott et al. (2001).\n9 To verify this assumption, the industry sector distribution in the sample has been compared with findings of\nother studies, for example D\u00fcllmann and Masschelein (2006).\nthe LGD is about 95% (see Gerke et al., 2008). For the bank portfolios, the LGD is fixed at\n45%, corresponding to the parameter value foreseen for senior debt under the Foundation IRB\napproach. In the case of the PSVaG, the EAD corresponds to the pension provisions. For the\nbank portfolios, we refer to the firm's total assets, which are being size-adjusted to reflect\ncredit exposures as further outlined below. The credit correlations have been inferred from a\nstudy of D\u00fcllmann et al. (2007) based on MKMV data. More specifically, we proceeded in\ntwo steps: First, we applied a logarithmic fit function to the asset values and asset correlations\nfor 2002. Next, we used the asset values in the current portfolio to apply the formula.10 In case\nof the IRB model, we used the regulatory asset correlations based on PDs and a flat maturity\nof 2.5 years, being the reference value for the Foundation IRB approach in most countries.11\nNext, it is outlined how the three portfolios for banks of different size groups have been\ncomposed, namely a portfolio for smaller banks, one for medium-sized banks and a credit\nportfolio for large banks. The portfolio characteristics of the bank portfolios and the PSVaG\nportfolio are shown in Table 3.\nWe mainly referred to two main assumptions: First, small banks tend to lend to small firms,\nmedium banks to small and medium firms and large banks, in principle, to all size groups of\nfirms. Second, we take into account that the number of lenders increases with firm size12 and\nthat larger firms do increasingly have access to other financing sources than bank credit only.\nAccordingly, the portfolios are being aligned with the portfolio exposure distribution (single\nname concentration) indicated by the German credit register (see Gordy and L\u00fctkebomert,\nFor the portfolio of small banks (PF1), we assume that only SMEs are relevant (i.e. firms with\ntotal sales of up to EUR 50m). To account for an adequate level of single name concentration,\nwe randomly chose only every second firm in the database with sales of more than EUR 10m,\nyielding an overall portfolio size of 3,255 counterparts as shown in Table 3. For this portfolio,\nwe did not apply an adjustment for the number of lenders, as SMEs in Germany are typically\ncustomers at only a very limited number of banks (typically one or two), so the relative size of\nthe firms corresponds to the relative size of credit exposures. As shown in Table 3, the\n10 The asset correlations determined by D\u00fcllmann et al. (2007) have been calculated directly from monthly\nMKMV asset values (and the respective asset returns) based on sliding windows of 24 months. Further\ninformation can be found in D\u00fcllmann et al. (2007).\n11 For the PSVaG portfolio, the choice of the maturity should, in principle, be oriented on the risk horizon of\nthe insurance, being long-term. We thus refer to a maturity of 2.5 years as a means to enable a better\ncomparison with the bank portfolios. For a maturity of 5 years that could be justified based on the risk\nhorizon, the IRB capital requirements for the PSVaG would approximately be 50% higher than indicated in\nthe results, for example 12.6% instead of 8.6% in the base case (Table 6).\n12 We use the results of Memmel et al. (2007) to account for that.\naverage PD is substantially higher than for the original portfolio, while the respective figure\nfor the asset correlations does yield a considerably lower level. This observation reflects\ncommon expectations and previous findings in the literature (see e.g. Lopez 2004).\nFor the portfolio of the medium-sized German banks (PF2), we chose all exposures\ncorresponding to firms with a turnover below 500m. Next, we randomly removed every\nsecond exposure corresponding to firms with sales less than EUR 25m and more than EUR\n100m, respectively, in order to account for the assumption that medium-sized banks\nconcentrate their lending to larger SMEs. Furthermore, we account for the number of lenders\nand for potential other financing sources. Accordingly, the exposure (i.e. the asset values) of\nfirms with more than EUR 50m of sales has been weighted at 90% (corresponding to 1.1 bank\nrelationships for each firm) and for firms with more than EUR 100m at 75% (1.3 bank\nrelationships). As shown in Table 3, the Herfindahl-Hirschman-Index (HHI) thereby yields a\nvalue (0.0046), being slightly above the typical interval for medium-sized German banks\nfor the small bank portfolio and that the average correlation increases more than 2 percentage\npoints, being in line with our expectations.\nTable 3: Descriptive Statistics of the credit portfolios used in this study\nTable 3 displays descriptive statistics of the portfolios used for stress testing. The PD and asset correlation are\ndisplayed in percent as arithmetic mean and exposure-weighted, respectively. The asset correlations have been\ninferred from a fit function applied to the end of 2002 data determined on an individual firm basis depending on\nasset values in D\u00fcllmann et al. (2007). The recovery rate of the PSVaG was set to 95 percent and for the banks to\n45% in line with the Foundation IRB approach. We use the Herfindahl-Hirschman-Index (HHI) to measure\nexposure concentration in single names. In the last column, we compare the exposure concentration of our\nportfolios with data from the German credit register (see Gordy and L\u00fctkebohmert, 2007).\nHHI\nCredit Portfolio N PD\n(%)\nLGD\n(%)\nAsset\ncorrelation\n(%)\nSample Credit\nregister\n(PF2) Medium-sized\nbank\nFor the portfolio of a large German bank (PF3), the number of assumptions to be made is the\nhighest. In the first step, we randomly removed every second exposure corresponding to firms\nwith sales less than EUR 100m, as the largest banks are likely to concentrate less on small\nfirm financing than medium and small banks do. Similarly to the case of the medium-sized\nbanks, we also account for the number of lenders and for potential other financing sources,\nbeing particularly important for the very largest firms in order to arrive at meaningful data.\nThe exposure of firms with more than EUR 50m of sales has been weighted at 90% and for\nfirms with more than EUR 100m at 75%. For firms with sales of more than one billion Euros\nthe exposure has been weighted at 25% (corresponding to up to 4 bank relationships and/or\nother financing opportunities) and for those with more than EUR 10bn of sales at 10% (up to\n10 bank relationships and/or other financing opportunities). In this way, the single name\nexposure concentration falls towards levels in the German credit register. As shown in Table\n3, the PDs become the lowest of all bank portfolios, and the correlations the highest ones after\napplying the adjustments described above. In terms of exposure concentration, we followed a\nconservative approach when compared to credit register data, denoted by the HHI of 0.0018,\nwhich slightly exceeds the typical level for credit portfolios of larger German banks.\nOverall, the PDs and the correlations of the portfolios are in line with our expectations, both\nin terms of level (exposure-weighted PD, mean asset correlation) and in terms of consistency\n(higher PDs for small banks, lower correlations for small banks).\n3 Concentration Risk Analysis and Stress Testing\nFrom a conceptual stance, we focus on the second Pillar of the Basel II framework, namely\nconcentration risk analysis and stress testing. When following a Pillar II regime, it becomes\nessential to briefly review the cornerstones of the Pillar I estimates. The assumptions of the\nAsymptotic Single Risk Factor Model (see Gordy, 2003) underlying the IRB are, first, that\ncredit portfolios are infinitely granular, i.e. that there is no exposure concentration, and,\nsecond, that there is no sectoral concentration in terms of geography and industry. While the\nfirst assumption has originally been complemented by means of a granularity adjustment, this\namendment has finally not been taken up into the Pillar I framework and is therefore subject\nto Pillar II. Due to the limitation of the ASRF model to one risk factor the incorporation of\nsubportfolio characteristics, namely to account for industry sector and regional specific\ndifferences via multiple risk factors, has been sacrificed for simplicity. Nevertheless, recent\nanalysis on the comparison between regulatory capital requirements and the outcome of\nmulti-factor economic capital models show that by the ASRF correlation estimates have been\nchosen in a relatively conservative way. Hence, the IRB capital requirements do implicitly\nassume an \"average\" concentration in credit portfolios (see e.g. D\u00fcllmann et al., 2007).\nWhile concentration risk analysis have been subject to an intensified research activity with\nseveral contributions during the last years (BCBS 2006a), stress testing becomes recently\nhighly focused with the two frameworks playing a complementary role.13\n3.1 Credit Risk Modeling\nCredit portfolio risk is usually traced by means of two central parameters characterizing the\nportfolio loss probability distribution function (Loss PDF), namely the expected loss (EL) and\nthe unexpected loss (UL). The EL denotes the average portfolio loss to be expected ex ante\nand the UL is usually defined as the difference between a particular quantile value of the Loss\nPDF and the EL. According to the Basel II framework, we refer to the Value-at-Risk (VaR) as\na quantile value of the Loss PDF and a time horizon of one year. From a conceptual\nperspective, the analysis can also be applied to the Expected Shortfall (ES, see Artzner et al.,\n1999), which is, unlike the VaR, a coherent risk measure.\nIf we further denote PDi\nas the annual default probability of a counterpart i and LGDi\n(loss\ngiven default) the portion of the credit exposure (EADi\n, exposure at default) lost in a default\nevent, then the expected loss of the portfolio exposure (ELp\n) may be written as the sum of the\nsingle firms' expected losses:\n=\n= \u00b7 \u00b7\n\nn\np i i i\ni\nWhile the ELp\nis by definition not affected by credit correlations and can therefore be\ndetermined analytically the unexpected loss of a credit portfolio, by contrast, depends on the\ncredit correlations of the exposures in the portfolio. There are two general ways to determine\nthe unexpected loss of a portfolio, numerical closed-form approaches and Monte Carlo\nsimulation. A very prominent approach in the previous case is the Basel II ASRF model14,\nwhile the foundation of the second approach was laid down by means of the CreditMetricsTM\nframework (see Gupton et al. 1997). We refer to the Basel II IRB model and a Monte Carlo\nsimulation based one-factor model.\nWithin this study, the credit risk default process is modeled based on a stylized Merton-type\nasset value model (see Merton 1974) with one common systematic risk factor and the\nremaining disturbance being idiosyncratic. We assume that each firm's creditworthiness is\nrepresented by its asset value, which fluctuates over time and reflects the actual state of the\n13 The evolution of stress testing practices has been particularly monitored by the BIS' Committee on the\nfirm's creditworthiness. We control for asset values falling below a certain barrier (usually the\nliabilities of a firm) during a one year time horizon, what implicates a default event. It has\nbeen shown in the literature that the asset values of larger firms tend to have a higher\ncorrelation with the systematic factor, i.e. implying that they are more strongly influenced by\nmacroeconomic developments (see, for example Lopez 2004), which is also assumed in our\nThe simulation based approach will be used to arrive at a higher flexibility in terms of credit\ncorrelations, which are \u00ad in case of the IRB \u00ad modeled conditional on the PD. The simulation\nof the default process is done as follows. Let us suppose that a firm defaults if its asset value\nxi falls short of a specific default barrier yi.\n. We first assume that each firm's default barrier\ncan be inferred via its default probability (PDi\n):\ni i i\nx y PD\n-\n-\n is the inverse cumulative standard normal distribution.\nWe then randomly draw a systematic factor Z and an idiosyncratic shock i\nfor each firm and\nthereby determine the asset returns of the firms in the sample (xi\n):\ni i i i\nx Z\n  \nwhere i\n is the correlation of the firm's asset return with the systematic factor. The\ncommonly known asset correlation does then equal the squared correlation of the firm's asset\nreturns with the systematic factor. Following this procedure we arrive at the Loss PDF.\n3.2 Concentration Risk Analysis\nWe consider two dimensions of concentration, single name concentration and sector\nconcentration in industry and geographical terms. We begin our analysis with the portfolio of\nthe PSVaG, which is very well diversified across the German economy in terms of industry\nand regional concentration. However, in terms of a single name concentration, the portfolio of\nthe PSVaG can be understood as an extreme case where every corporate has one credit\nrelationship with only one single (house) bank. Hence, the PSVaG portfolio tends to be\n15 This assumption is also implicitly incorporated in the Basel II framework, by assigning higher correlation\nto firms with a lower PD (BCBS 2005). The simple arithmetic average as well as the exposure-weighted\nasset correlations statistics on the asset correlations used in this study are shown in Table 3 for the four\nportfolios. The level of the simple arithmetic average is in line with other studies, for example Lopez\nconcentrated in single names.16 Subsequently, we relax this assumption to analyze typical\ncredit portfolios of banks. Sector concentration effects are not explicitly reviewed. However,\nwe will consider firm size-dependant cyclical effects via credit correlations. Overall, the aim\nof this study is to investigate the impact of portfolio concentration on the outcome of stress\ntesting.\nIn terms of stress testing, the focus of this study lies on the credit portfolio level, with cyclical\neffects being incorporated via a stress of credit risk parameters. For the stress testing of the\ncredit risk single of portfolios, a general standard to be followed has not emerged yet (CGFS\n2005) despite various contributions in the literature17, implying that stress testing remains an\nart to be tailored by each specific financial institution according to its specific requirements.\nThe Basel II framework (BCBS 2006b) asks to investigate possible future scenarios that may\nthreaten the solvency of banks. In the case of credit, this notably includes an assessment of\neconomic or sector-specific downturn events, which must be \"meaningful\" and \"reasonably\nconservative\" and thereby represent at least \"mild recession scenarios\", but not necessarily a\n\"worst-case scenario\" (BCBS 2006b, para. 435). Typically, a stress testing exercise would\nrefer to plausible, but unlikely events. Nevertheless, the specific choice of the stress scenario\nlies in the discretion of the bank and has to be justified vis-\u00e0-vis the supervisory body.\nWithin the Basel II framework, a stress test for credit risk essentially comprises a univariate\nstress of IRB credit risk parameters, namely the PD (both for borrowers and guarantors), LGD\nand the EAD (credit conversion factors), and/or a joint stress of the parameters (multivariate\ncase). For IRB banks, who typically also use economic capital models, e.g. for benchmarking\npurposes (for example through the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, ICAAP),\nstress testing additionally comprises an assessment of different levels of confidence, credit\ncorrelations and portfolio concentrations. In the latter dimension, stress testing of\nconcentration risk by Bonti et al. (2006) can be seen as a seminal work.\nWhen one now seeks applying stress tests to a real credit portfolio, the natural question will\nbe the choice of the scenarios, being potentially the most difficult challenge. Ideally, a stress\n16 More precisely, the reason for the PSVaG portfolio being highly concentrated in single names results from\nthe sheer size of the largest exposures, which cannot be counterbalanced by the high number of small firms\nin the portfolio, clearly indicated by the high HHI of the PSVaG (Table 3). See also Gerke et al. (2008).\n(2005). A recent analysis for a US retail portfolio has been carried out by R\u00f6sch and Scheule (2007).\ntesting exercise would begin with a model-based prediction of an adverse macroeconomic\nevent (i.e. a macroeconomic stress event) that is then being endogenously translated into\ncredit risk, market risk, operational risk and liquidity risk scenarios, respectively, denoted as a\nmacro stress test in Table 4 below. However, such comprehensive modeling within one single\nframework does hardly exist, at least for credit risk, where multi-factor credit risk models are\nlikely to be exogenously fed by the outcome of the macroeconomic stress scenarios, for\nexample (see also Bonti et al., 2006). In the absence of a single comprehensive (factor) model\nto endogenously stress risk factors (macro stress tests), this is typically done by means of\ntaking historical stress scenarios for the risk factors used in multi-factor models (Historical\nsimulation). Sensitivity analysis and regression analysis are the corresponding stress tests in\ncase of single risk factor models. Accordingly, a broad classification of stress tests according\nto the number of risk factors of the underlying credit risk model (one-factor or multi-factor)\nand the way how the stress scenarios are being determined (endogenously or exogenously) is\nTable 4: Classification of stress tests for factor models\nOne Risk Factor Several Risk Factors\nExogenous Sensitivity analysis Historical simulation\nEndogenous Regression analysis Macro stress test\nIn the case of the Basel II IRB model, there is only one single risk factor, so stress tests can, in\nprinciple, take the form of regression analysis (endogenous case) and sensitivity analysis\n(exogenous case). However, given that the IRB model has been pre-calibrated in terms of\ncyclicality19, stress testing does take the form of sensitivity analysis or historical simulation of\nthe underlying credit risk parameters rather than an explicit stress of the single risk factor.\nBoth techniques will be applied to the credit portfolios below.\n18 Further information on the classification of stress tests and those carried out by Deutsche Bundesbank can be\n19 For a theoretical model of the cyclical effects of Basel II see e.g. Heid (2007).\nAs outlined in the previous section, stress tests will be carried out in two different\nframeworks, namely based on univariate scenarios (sensitivity analysis) (1) as well as\nunivariate (2a) and multivariate (2b) historical simulation scenarios as shown in Table 5.\nTable 5: Overview on the Stress Scenarios used within this study\nThe historical default rates are taken from the German National Statistical Office (\"Statistisches Bundesamt\").\nThe S&P data for the loss given default (LGD) are taken from Franks et al. (2004). We use asset correlations\nbased on MKMV data taken from D\u00fcllmann et al.

The scenarios are applied via the Basel II IRB\nmodel and a simulation based one-factor model (1FM), where correlations were modeled\nunconditional on PDs and may therefore be stressed separately.\n4.1 Stress Testing based on the Basel II IRB model\nTable 6 shows the outcome of univariate sensitivity scenarios for the PD (1) based on the\nBasel II IRB model applied in a uniform way to the portfolio.20 As the exposure and the LGD\ndo linearly enter the IRB model they have not been considered for univariate stress tests.\nWhen it comes to a univariate stress of PDs, there is also a direct influence on the level of\nasset correlations being modeled conditional on the PD, so an IRB stress of PDs translates\ninto a combined PD/correlation stress. However, IRB asset correlations do - in line with\nempirical evidence - decrease with increasing PDs, so there is a smoothening effect on the\noverall outcome of stress. The reason to assume a negative relationship between PD and\ncorrelations is that PDs tend to be higher for smaller firms, which are less affected by\n20 We applied the IRB formula foreseen for corporates for all exposures (BCBS, 2006b, para. 272), in order to\nmake results better comparable.\nmacroeconomic developments than larger firms, but more dependent on firm-specific\nidiosyncratic circumstances. While this general relationship between PDs and correlations\nintegrated into the IRB model therefore constitutes a legitimate concern improving the\nmodel's risk sensitivity it is less useful for stress testing purposes. This is, in fact, the purpose\nof using the 1FM as a means for the assessment of the independent effect of correlation stress.\nFurthermore, we will indicate what the increase of IRB capital requirements would be if asset\ncorrelations would remain unchanged with PD stress.\nThe outcome of univariate PD stress for the IRB model shows that the sensitivity of IRB\nminimum capital requirements against an increase in the PD is rather decent, with a uniform\nrelative increase of PDs by 10% translating into an increase of IRB capital requirements by\nIf one eliminated PD-correlation dependency and assumed that asset correlations remain\nunchanged with increasing PDs, then a 10% rise of PDs resulted to an increase of IRB capital\nrequirements by 5.3% (PF1) to 5.7% (PF0, PF3). This outcome indicates that the smoothening\neffect of asset correlations in the IRB model is relatively moderate, but should, nevertheless,\nbe carefully taken into account when it comes to an interpretation of the outcome of IRB\nTable 6: Sensitivity Analysis for the Basel II Model\nTable 6 shows the IRB minimum capital requirements in percentage as a portion of the portfolio exposure for the\nfour different portfolios referred to in this study. Besides the unstressed \"Base case\", the outcome of five\ndifferent PD stress scenarios is displayed, based on a relative increase of the PD by the percentages indicated.\nPD\nPortfolio Base\nOverall, the outcome of the univariate sensitivity analysis shows that the portfolio structure\ndoes not play a material role for IRB capital requirements, being highly in line with our\nexpectations.\n21 The corresponding outcome for a 50% PD stress is an increase of capital requirements by 24.6% (PF1) to\n22 If one stressed PDs at a level of 10% together with the asset correlations of the base case, the capital ratios as a\nNext, we consider univariate (2a) and multivariate (2a) scenarios based on historical data both\nfor the IRB model and for the 1FM. The historical values for the credit risk parameters for\nGermany are taken from three sources that we considered being of high quality each: The\ndefault rates are taken from the German National Statistical Office (\"Statistisches\nBundesamt\"), the loss severity rates are from Franks et al. (2004) and asset correlations are\nfrom D\u00fcllmann et al. (2007). In case of the loss severity rates reported by Franks et al. (2004),\nwe refer to the data on the defaulted German firms only.23 The asset correlations are based on\nMKMV data for European firms, with German firms being among the most represented\ncountries in the sample. The three time series span the period from 1996 to 2002, covering a\nperiod of seven years and thus an entire business cycle (see Table 7). Asset correlations data\nwill only be considered for the 1FM.\nTable 7: Time Series of Credit Risk Parameters used for Stress Testing\nTable 7 displays the historical default rates, loss severity rates and asset correlations used for stress testing. The\ndefault rates correspond to the corporate insolvency rates reported by the German National Statistical Office\n(\"Statistisches Bundesamt\"). The loss severity rates for Germany are taken from Franks et al. (2004). The asset\ncorrelations for Germany are taken from D\u00fcllmann et al. (2007). We use the e.g. value for December 1997 for\nthe year 1996 as these asset correlations have been estimated for the 24-month time sliding window starting in\nYear Default rates Loss Severity Rates Asset\nCorrelations\nNext, the crucial question becomes how these historical time series should be used for\nforward-looking stress testing. In order to reflect a stress event, practitioners would typically\nrefer to a `worst year in x years scenario' (or second worst in x years24) or to quantile values\nof the historical credit risk parameters (PD, LGD, correlations) on the upper end of the\ndistribution (75%, 80%, 90%), for example. As the time series are relatively short (as it will\nUS loans. Further information on LGDs can be found in Altman et al. (2005). As these data are essentially\nbased on US data and partially also on bond data, we did not consider them in this study.\n24 As long as time series are relatively short, a \"worst year in x years\" scenario would not necessarily constitute\nan ultimate worst case scenario, so it appears to be feasible to choose the worst year. In addition, the second\nand third worst years would typically be additionally taken into account, notably as the Basel II framework\ndoes not necessarily ask for the simulation for a worst-case scenario.\nbe the case in many banks), we will refer to a pragmatic rule, namely a `worst year in 7 years\nscenario' and thereby assess a scenario that tends to constitute a conservative ceiling for Basel\nII type stress testing.\nThis rule would generally allow for two potential cases to identify the year corresponding to\n`worst year in x years scenario', namely referring to the worst year in terms of absolute risk\nlevels or to the year with the most substantial increase of portfolio risk. In the first case, one\nwould assume that the worst historical level would also correspond to a (very) adverse\nscenario in the future, so stress testing would simulate the occurrence of a comparable level in\nthe future. In the latter case, the current portfolio risk is taken as a basis to apply a relative\nstress event. The advantage of the second case is that it is less backward-looking, particularly\nalso as absolute levels may change over time as recent developments have shown and stress\ntests would become difficult in case of periods where portfolio risk is at maximum historical\nlevels. However, this does also apply to relative changes, so they have to be chosen in an\nappropriate way, but potentially in a magnitude around historical maximum levels if one\nseeks for conservative estimates, particularly if the current level of portfolio risk is relatively\nlow. Furthermore, it has to be decided which parameter is being used to define the reference\nyear.\nIn line with the regulatory discussion on the definition of an economic downturn in the\ncontext of Basel II regulation, we focus on the development of the PD and use the relative\nnotion to determine stress.25 As displayed in Table 7, the PD shows a relatively stable\nmost extensive one, amounting to an increase of the PD by 61% (from 0.68% to 1.11%). We\nconsider this year as an economic downturn. In the same period, also the LGD and the asset\ncorrelations increased substantially, the LGD by 51% and asset correlations by 71%.\nAlthough this outcome may point to the fact that it is a given rule that the downturn scenarios\nfor the PD, LGD and correlations fall together, this has by no means been proven, as data\nsources remain very limited to date and the outcome varies widely across studies. If one\nconsiders the consecutive year where the PD reaches the highest level during the seven year\nperiod, for example, we observe a PD increase by 15% and the raise of asset correlations by\n9%, but a decrease in LGD by 36%. In any case, however, the underlying example shows that\n25 A relative increase has been chosen in order to better compare the impact of stress for the different portfolios.\nA valid alternative would be to refer to scenarios with an absolute increase of risk parameters, for example 10\npercentage points in case of LGDs. For the PDs, the absolute increase could be defined for each rating class,\nfor example.\nan increase in different credit risk parameters can fall together, and it is, in fact, the purpose of\nstress tests is to also simulate such adverse cases.\nTable 8 shows the outcome of historical simulation for the IRB model (2a, 2b). The increase\nof capital requirements is substantial for all scenarios except for the LGD stress for portfolio\nPF0, where the LGD does increase only from 95% to the LGD ceiling of 100%, which\nconstitutes an untypical case for credit portfolios. The increase of the PD (+61%) translates\ninto a raise of IRB capital requirements by roughly 20% and the LGD increase results to a\nlinear increase by 51%. The aggregated affect of a PD and LGD shock leads to an increase of\nIRB capital requirements of more than 80% for the three bank credit portfolio, so that a joint\nstress of the two parameters yields a more than 10% additional increase of capital\nrequirements compared to the simple sum of the two univariate scenarios. Among the bank\nportfolios, the PD stress effect as well as the aggregated stress effect is most extensive for the\nportfolio of the large banks (PF3), followed by portfolio PF2 and PF1, with the differences\nbetween the three portfolios being at a minor level of 1-3 percentage points.\nTable 8: Historical Simulation for the Basel II IRB Model\nTable 8 shows IRB capital requirements as a portion of the portfolio exposure in percentage for the four different\nportfolios in different stress scenarios. For the portfolio of the German pension insurer (\"PSVaG\"), the LGD was\nonly increased by five percentage points in the stress event (i.e. from 95 to 100 percent). We thereby assume that\nthe LGD has a ceiling of 100 percent. Descriptive statistics of the unstressed credit risk parameters are shown in\nTable 3. For the portfolio of the small bank, for example, the mean PD increases from 0.99% to 1.59% and the\nUnivariate stress (2a) Multivariate scenario (2b)\nPortfolio Base\n(PF2) Medium-sized\nbank\nIn absolute terms, portfolio risk for the bank credit portfolios does almost double from\nroughly 5% to 9%-10%, the stress level thereby exceeding the loaded 8% level of the Basel I\nand Basel II framework. If one would seek to apply less conservative stress events, one could\ntake fractions of the maximum increase of the parameters, for example a PD increase by\n30.5% and/or an LGD increase by 25.5%. Again, the smoothening effect of asset correlations\nhas to be taken into account. For the portfolio with the most substantial increase of capital\nrequirements (PF3), the credit VaR for the univariate scenario (2a) would yield 5.92% if the\ncorrelations remained unchanged compared to the base case, and 8.94% for the multivariate\ncase (2b). The smoothening effect on the relative increase would thereby be 1.2% (2a) and\n2.1% (2b), respectively, being relatively minor.\n4.2 Stress Testing based on an Economic Capital Model\nNext, we use a simulation based one-factor model (1FM) to determine the effect of asset\ncorrelation stress both from a univariate (2a) and a multivariate perspective (2b).26 For the two\nmost concentrated portfolios in exposure, PF0 and PF1, the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of the 1FM\nfor a confidence level of 99.9% closely resembles the IRB capital requirements (see Table 9).\nFor the other two portfolios, the 1FM VaR is lower than the IRB capital requirements. The\ndifference mainly results from the discrepancy in asset correlations modeling besides\nrelatively minor differences due to the EL not being taken in case of the IRB. More\nspecifically, it results from the portfolio specific exposure/PD/asset correlation combination\nbeing transformed into portfolio VaR: High correlations materialize in case of large exposures\ncombined with increasing PDs. The differences of the 1FM VaR figures and the respective\nIRB capital requirements raises the question as to whether there is a kind of a benchmark\nportfolio with a specific concentration structure so that the economic capital requirements for\na certain economic capital model (for example the 1FM or a multi-factor model such as\nCreditMetrics) are similar (or 50%, 75%) to the IRB capital requirements. Such a portfolio\ncould serve the role of defining a threshold whether a portfolio is rather concentrated or not.\nTable 9: Stress Testing of Correlations\nTable 9 shows the results of asset correlation stress in univariate and multivariate scenarios for the credit VaR\ncalculated for a simulation based one-factor model (IFM) as a portion of the portfolio exposure in percentage.\nThe unstressed mean asset correlations are shown in Table 3. The table also shows the IRB capital requirements\nfor the unstressed case (\"Base Case IRB\").\nUnivariate scenario (2a) Multivariate\nscenario (2b)\nPortfolio\nBase\nCase\nIRB\nBase\nCase\n1FM Asset corr.\nAsset corr.\nAsset corr.\n(PF2) Medium-sized\nbank\n26 More specifically, we used a confidence level of 99.9% on a one year basis, so the result is comparable to the\nBasel II IRB outcome, except for the fact that the VaR does include the EL, whereas the IRB capital\nrequirements do not. However, as the EL is only a relatively small fraction of the UL, the comparison remains\nvalid. The results have been determined based on 50,000 simulation runs.\nIn the case of the 1FM, the impact of the portfolio structure on the credit VaR becomes\nclearly evident in the stress test results: A 10% stress of correlations translates into a VaR\nincrease of 3% (PF1) to 14% (PF3), i.e. an increase in correlations does translate into a more\nthan linear VaR increase in the latter case. For the univariate historical scenario (2a), namely\nalmost 90% (PF3) ceteris paribus. This outcome clearly demonstrates the crucial effect that\ncorrelations play for the evolution of credit portfolio risk, but also how portfolio-dependent\ntheir effect is, even in case of the application of a one-factor model.\nwhich seems quite extreme. Such a scenario could indeed be understood as a worst-case\nscenario and thereby sets a conservative limit to the outcome of stress testing carried out in\nthis study. As outlined before, in case of a stress event in relative terms one has to also\nconsider the current level of portfolio risk in order to avoid misleading conclusions. In the\nunderlying case, it has to be taken into account that 2002 was a year of light recession and\nstress testing has thus been applied to already elevated credit risk parameters.\n5 Conclusion\nWe address stress testing as one of the core Pillar II issues of Basel II. Most recently, this has\nbecome a crucial part of the public agenda of the framework, also due to US subprime crisis.\nThe main reason is that Pillar I estimates do only implicitly take into account portfolio\nconcentration.\nStress tests are only vaguely defined by supervisory bodies. Flexibility is a key aim of the\nBasel II framework to appropriately deal with specific situations in the highly diverse\nuniverse of financial institutions. In our study we built different typical credit portfolios for\nGerman banks of different sizes and applied univariate and multivariate stress tests. To\novercome the lack of publicly available data we used the outcome of a previous study where\nthe balance sheet data of Deutsche Bundesbank were calibrated to the portfolio of the German\npension insurer, the PSVaG, which constitutes a cross sectional representation of the German\neconomy. Based on this database, we derive credit portfolios by means of benchmarking with\nthe German register to thereby arrive at a unique set of real credit portfolio data.\nThe outcome shows that stress tests based on historical scenarios can have a huge impact on\nminimum capital requirements in the IRB model, amounting to up to 80% in a multivariate\nscenario with PD/LGD stress. Furthermore, in multivariate scenarios with a rise of several\ncredit risk parameters at the same time the stress effect results to an increase of portfolio risk\nmore than the aggregation of the univariate outcome would indicate. If we additionally stress\ncorrelations in a simulation based one-factor model, the credit Value-at-Risk may raise up to\n300%, which outlines the crucial effect of correlation stress tests. Moreover, portfolio\ndifferences become material, as the increase of the VaR for the bank portfolios ranges from\n170% (small bank portfolio) to 300% (large bank portfolio). In the terms of the relative\ncontributions of the parameters, the stress effect is, by definition, linear both for the LGD and\nthe EAD. In case of univariate PD stress, an increase by 10% in relative terms approximately\ntranslates into an increase of IRB capital requirements of roughly 4%, but there is a\nsmoothening effect of correlations. If one eliminates PD-correlation dependence and leaves\ncorrelations unchanged while increasing PDs, the effect of a 10% relative, univariate increase\nof the PD yields an increase of IRB capital requirements by around 5.5%. In fact, it might be\nmore appropriate to refer to the latter treatment in case of IRB stress tests, particularly to\nassess less substantial PD stress. For univariate correlation stress (independent of the PD), the\neffect highly depends on the portfolio structure, and may yield a more than linear increase of\nthe credit VaR. Apart from the numerical outcome, this study has presented a set of stress\ntests that can be composed in a relatively straightforward way, thereby also taking into\naccount the criteria foreseen by the regulatory framework. In this way, the study may\ncontribute to the evolution of a standard for credit risk stress tests.\nIn sum, this study shows that it is important to carry out different types of stress tests to gain a\ncomprehensive view on portfolio risk, notably to facilitate IRB stress testing by means of\neconomic capital based stress tests. The analysis also points out that stress testing can clearly\nreveal portfolio risk that is not readily visibly with standard credit risk analysis.\n6 References\nAltman, E., Resti, A., Sironi, A., 2005.
