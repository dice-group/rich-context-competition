The goal of the current study was to use a relatively inexpensive methodology to examine\nthe prevalence and demographic correlates of nonmedical methamphetamine use in the United\nStates.\nMethods: The sample was obtained through an internet survey of noninstitutionalized adults (n =\nfrom the U.S. Census and the 2003 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) were used\nto estimate national-level prevalence rates.\nResults: The overall prevalence of current nonmedical methamphetamine use was estimated to\nbe 0.27%. Lifetime use was estimated to be 8.6%. Current use rates for men (0.32%) and women\n(0.23%) did not differ, although men had a higher 3-year prevalence rate (3.1%) than women (1.1%).\nWithin the age subgroup with the highest overall methamphetamine use (18 to 25 year olds), non-\nstudents had substantially higher methamphetamine use (0.85% current; 2.4% past year) than\nstudents (0.23% current; 0.79% past year). Methamphetamine use was not constrained to those\nwith publicly funded health care insurance.\nConclusion: Through the use of an internet panel weighted to reflect U.S. population norms, the\nestimated lifetime prevalence of methamphetamine use among 18 to 49 year olds was 8.6%. These\nfindings give rates of use comparable to those reported in the 2005 NSDUH. Internet surveys are\na relatively inexpensive way to provide complimentary data to telephone or in-person interviews.\nBackground\nIllicit methamphetamine use is a public health concern in\nthe United States with an increase in prevalence in the\n1990s. Treatment admission rates for methamphetamine\nlargely stabilized since 2000, although a decrease in new\nmethamphetamine users aged 12 or over occurred\nThis article is available from: http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/3/1/19\n\u00a9 2008 Durell et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nSubstance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2008, 3:19 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/3/1/19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)\nfound past year and lifetime prevalence rates of 0.5% and\n4.3% [2]. About half a million Americans used metham-\nphetamine in the past month [2].\nWhile methamphetamine use in the early 1990s was pri-\nmarily a problem in the Western United States, the past 15\nyears have seen it spread across the country. In 1992, 5\nstates reported high rates of treatment admissions (i.e.,\nreported high rates [1]. Epidemiological data suggest that\npast month) among 18 to 25 year olds [2]. From the early\nto mid 1990s, methamphetamine use doubled among\nhigh school students, particularly in Western states [3].\nLong-term methamphetamine use is associated with psy-\nchiatric symptoms, including drug-induced psychotic\nsymptoms that persist over time [4]. Additionally, in a\nlarge sample of treatment-seeking methamphetamine\nusers, 27% had reported a previous suicide attempt, and\n43% had reported violent behavior problems [5]. Among\nmethamphetamine-using arrestees in several Western cit-\nies, more than a third reported violent behavior as a con-\nsequence of their use [6]. Methamphetamine use is also\nassociated with increased risky sexual behaviors [7] and\nhigher prevalence of HIV infection [8,9].\nIn addition to impacting the individual user, metham-\nphetamine use burdens society with associated criminal\njustice and health care costs. In 2000, the prevalence of\ncurrent methamphetamine use among adult male arrest-\nees was approximately 25% in 3 California cities [10].\nMethamphetamine use is also highly predictive of self-\nreported violent criminal behavior and recidivism among\nparolees, with 82% of methamphetamine users (versus\n54% of nonusers) returning to custody within 12 months\n[11]. Frequent injection of crystal methamphetamine is\nalso associated with high rates of emergency room use\n[12,13]. The medical cost for treating a patient with severe\nburns related to methamphetamine production has been\nin prevalence rates since 2000, methamphetamine-related\nadmissions for treatment have increased steadily from\nthe increased availability (in 2001) of \"ice\" methamphet-\namine, a smoked form of highly pure methamphetamine\nthat is thought to be more addictive because smoking\ngives an intense high [15].\nWhile the NSDUH offers large sample sizes (e.g., 68,305\nthe prevalence of illicit drugs in the United States, other\nmethods may provide comparable data in a more expedi-\ntious fashion. Emerging trends can be verified by exami-\nnation of data from additional studies. If not confirmed,\nthese differences can serve as the basis for further research\nto explain the different findings.\nTelephone surveys cost less than in-person surveys and do\nnot require travel to high-crime areas to interview\nrespondents. However, telephone surveys are increasingly\ndifficult to conduct due to the use of call-screening devices\nand because these surveys draw their samples from land-\nline telephone numbers. Random-digit dialing (RDD)\nprocedures allow sampling of unlisted telephone num-\nbers and can be designed to increase interviewers' likeli-\nhood of reaching eligible numbers. However, about 16%\nof U.S. households have substituted wireless phone serv-\nice for landline phones [16].\nThe use of internet panels is 1 alternative to such time-\nintensive surveys. In addition to lower cost and increased\nspeed of data collection, internet surveys have the ability\nto use visual cues to assist in recall [17]. Findings from\ninternet surveys are increasingly being reported in the lit-\nWhile internet surveys may yield a sample that is unrepre-\nsentative of the target population, propensity methods\ncan address this problem. Weights can be applied by\nadjusting responses using a propensity scoring method\nthat is tied to the likelihood that an internet survey\nrespondent would have participated in a probability sur-\nvey. Further statistical adjustments can be made so that\nthe final weights for the internet sample agree with the\ndistribution of the U.S. target population on general\ndemographic characteristics. Nevertheless, because of the\nconcerns about the potential for biases due to respond-\nents self-selecting into an internet survey pool, we stress\nthe importance of having data from a national probability\nsurvey as a benchmark against which to compare internet\nsurvey findings.\nIn light of these issues, the current study uses data from a\nnationwide internet panel to examine the prevalence and\ncorrelates of methamphetamine use among adults aged\nMethods\nStudy sample and procedures\nSubjects were recruited from the Harris Poll Online\n(HPOL) panel maintained by Harris Interactive. This\npanel is composed of several million members interna-\ntionally who have consented to be contacted for public\nopinion surveys distributed via the internet. Participants\nwere noninstitutionalized civilian adults aged 18 to 49\nliving in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Per-\nSubstance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2008, 3:19 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/3/1/19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nsons younger than 18 were excluded because of the time\nand costs involved in obtaining parental consent.\nThe survey was administered and collected in August 2005\nthrough a password-protected, encrypted Web portal. All\npanel members who initially met eligibility criteria\nreceived an e-mail invitation describing the study. These\nmembers then received a short screening questionnaire to\nidentify respondents according to specified target group\nassignments (by age group and substance use history). If\na particular target group was not yet filled, eligible mem-\nbers were further directed to a more detailed informed\nconsent form for participation in the full survey. Of the\n11,200 HPOL participants who responded to the initial\nsurvey invitation, 4,541 were eligible to participate in the\nstudy and responded before their respective target groups\nwere filled. This group of eligible respondents included\nand 244 (5.4%) members who qualified but refused to\nticipants who responded to the initial invitation (5.8%)\nstarted but did not finish the full survey.\nAn Institutional Review Board approved the study proce-\ndures prior to data collection. Respondents who com-\npleted the survey received a $10 honorarium.\nMeasures\nPublic domain NSDUH questions served as a basis for the\nsubstance use and demographic items used in this survey\nin order to establish comparability between the estimates\nof the 2 studies. Consistent with NSDUH, respondents\nwere asked about their most recent nonmedical metham-\nphetamine use (defined as drug use without a prescription\nor to induce a specific feeling or experience), except that\nthe NSDUH category of use \"more than 12 months ago\"\nwas split into 2 categories: 1) more than 12 months ago\nbut within the past 3 years and 2) more than 3 years ago.\nFrom this question, information was obtained about use\nin the past month, past 12 months, past 3 years, and any\ntime in the respondent's lifetime.\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics (frequency estimates and percentages\nand related standard errors) were used to estimate popu-\nlation prevalence of methamphetamine use in general\nand within available demographic subgroups. Weights\n(see below) were applied to convert raw percentages of\nrespondents to estimates for the civilian, noninstitution-\nalized population of adults aged 18 to 49 living in the\nUnited States. Weighted prevalence estimates and statisti-\ncal tests were conducted using the SUDAAN Software for\nAnalysis of Correlated Data [19]. The DESCRIPT proce-\ndure in SUDAAN was used to conduct t tests and generate\np-values from the tests. Differences between percentages\nwere considered to be statistically significant if the test\nyielded a p-value less than .05. Because analyses were per-\nformed on the entire sample, all statistical tests had 4,296\ndegrees of freedom.\nA 2-stage weighting process was used to correct for possi-\nble selection bias within the internet panel. First, the data\nwere weighted according to results from a probability-\nbased telephone survey using a propensity scoring\napproach. The propensity score adjusted for self-selection\ninto the online population and into the panel and for sur-\nvey nonresponse that may not be explained by demo-\ngraphic differences. The propensity score model was\ncreated by Harris using data from parallel telephone and\ninternet surveys that they periodically collect with the tel-\nephone survey based on RDD probability sampling.\nWeights were created so that the weighted distribution of\nthe propensity score for internet respondents was\nmatched to the distribution for the RDD telephone\nrespondents. The second step in the weighting process was\nto weight the data to match the U.S. target population dis-\ntribution by general demographic characteristics, as well\nas distribution of past month cigarette use and past\nmonth \"binge\" alcohol use (i.e., consumption of 5 or\nmore drinks in a single occasion at least once in the past\nrent publicly available data at the time the study was con-\nducted.\nFor this study, a model was developed to predict the prob-\nability that a response was obtained from a selected indi-\nvidual. For response probability models to be effective, we\nneeded to find covariates that would be related to both (a)\nthe likelihood that a subject was included in the study\n(i.e., an internet user) and (b) the analysis outcomes\nbeing measured in the study. Therefore, the latter 2 sub-\nstance use measures were chosen because alcohol and cig-\narette use appear to be related to a respondent's likelihood\nof being online [20]. Cigarette use and \"binge\" alcohol\nuse also appear to be related to the likelihood of illicit\ndrug use (2). Further details of the weighting process are\ngiven elsewhere [21].\nDemographic characteristics of the sample and weighted\npopulation percentages also have been described previ-\nously [21]. Briefly, the study design for the data set used in\nthis paper favored the inclusion of nonmedical users of\nprescription drugs used in the treatment of attention-def-\nicit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Consequently, young\nadults aged 18 to 25 were overrepresented in the sample\nweighting procedures reversed this overrepresentation of\nyoung adults to reflect their representation in the popula-\ntion (weighted percentages of 24% for young adults and\nSubstance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2008, 3:19 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/3/1/19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n(and not of Hispanic origin) also were overrepresented in\nthe sample (sample percentage of 77% for whites versus a\nweighted population percentage of 66%). Males were\nslightly underrepresented in the sample (43% of the sam-\nple versus a weighted percentage of 49%).\nResults\nThe overall weighted prevalence of lifetime nonmedical\nmethamphetamine use among persons aged 18 to 49 was\n8.63% (Table 1). In the past year, the weighted prevalence\nwas 0.71%, and the prevalence of current use (past\nmonth) was 0.27%. However, these overall rates masked\nimportant differences among subgroups.\nYoung adults aged 18 to 25 were significantly more likely\nthan older adults aged 26 to 49 to have used methamphet-\nof use in the past 3 years did not differ significantly by age\ngroup. The lifetime rate was somewhat higher among the\n26 to 49 year olds, as might be expected given the greater\nnumber of years in which older adults had the opportu-\nnity to have used at least once. However, this difference\nwas not statistically significant.\nPrevalence rates did not differ significantly by gender for\nany period. Within the age group with the highest rates of\nmethamphetamine use (18 to 25 year olds), men and\nwomen also had comparable prevalence rates (Figure 1);\nnone of the differences between men and women in this\nage group were significant.\nThose without a high school degree were nearly 4 times\nmore likely to be lifetime methamphetamine users com-\npared with college graduates (t = 2.03, p = .04). High\nschool graduates and those with some college had similar\nweighted lifetime prevalence rates, but the rates for both\nof these groups were not significantly different from the\nprevalence rate for those without a high school degree. For\nthe past 3 years and past year, the prevalence rates did not\nvary significantly by education level. In terms of current\nuse, the pattern of use in regard to education was quite dif-\nferent than that seen for lifetime use. There was a trend for\nincreased current use with higher education: 0.21% cur-\nrent use among high school graduates, 0.31% among\nthose with some college, and 0.47% among college grad-\nuates. However, these weighted prevalence rates were not\nsignificantly different (i.e., t = 0.48, p = .63 for high school\ngraduates versus adults with some college, t = 0.58, p = .56\nfor adults with some college versus college graduates, and\nt = 0.86, p = .39 for high school graduates versus college\ngraduates). The weighted prevalence rate for current use\namong those without a high school degree was very low.\nAlthough this estimate also was imprecise (SE: 0.02), it\nwas significantly different from the estimate for those with\nTable 1: Weighted Prevalencea of Nonmedical Methamphetamine Use by Demographic Characteristics\nLifetime Past 3 Years Past Year Past Month\nAge\nGender\nEducation\na Estimates reflect the percent distributions for each group and their standard errors are displayed below them.

Rates of lifetime use also\nwere not significantly different between students and\nnon-students.\nAlthough rates of methamphetamine use in the lifetime\nand past 3 years appeared to be higher among persons\nwithout health insurance compared with persons with\nprivate or other insurance (Figure 3), these differences\nwere not significant. There were no significant differences\nbetween insurance status groups for methamphetamine\nuse in any period.\nDiscussion\nData from this study suggest that at the time of the survey\naged 18 to 49 had used methamphetamine at least once,\nand 2.1% had used it in the past 3 years. However, only\n0.7% used methamphetamine in the past year, and 0.3%\nwere current users. Other key findings of this survey are 1)\nthe prevalence of past year use was nearly 5 times greater\n49-year-old group; 2) methamphetamine use was not\nexclusively a problem for men, with current use preva-\nlence rates being similar for men and women; 3) non-stu-\ndents within the 18- to 25-year-old age group were more\nlikely than students in this age group to be methamphet-\namine users in the past year and past 3 years; 4) more than\n(20.6%) had used methamphetamine at least once in\ntheir lifetime; and 5) while uninsured individuals\nappeared to have elevated lifetime and past 3 year preva-\nlence rates relative to privately insured individuals, there\nwere no significant differences in methamphetamine use,\nin any timeframe by insurance status.\nThe 2005 NSDUH, which spanned the timeframe of the\ncurrent internet survey, reported lifetime rates of metham-\nphetamine use of 4.3% among Americans aged 12 or\nRates of lifetime methamphetamine use among adult age\nAlthough rates of lifetime methamphetamine use for 18\nWeighted Prevalence of Nonmedical Methamphetamine Use Among Men and Women Who Were 18 to 25 Years Old\nWeighted Prevalence of Nonmedical Methamphetamine Use Among Men and Women Who Were 18 to 25 Years Old.\nLifetime Past 3 Years Past Year Past Month\nWeighted Prevalence\nNo significant differences between men and women 18-25 years old.\nSubstance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2008, 3:19 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/3/1/19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nto 25 year olds, a comparable age group in both studies,\nwere somewhat higher in the present study than in\nNSDUH, rates in these 2 studies among young adults were\nsimilar for the past year and past month.\nDemographic correlates of methamphetamine use also\nwere similar in the NSDUH and the present internet sur-\nNSDUHs [23] and the present study found that past year\nmethamphetamine use was more prevalent in the 18- to\nreported past year methamphetamine use among college\n0.8% for noncollege students in that age range [22].\nAlthough the present internet survey used a slightly differ-\nent age range (18 to 25), we observed significantly lower\nrates of past year methamphetamine use among students\ncompared with non-students.\nalso found a somewhat higher annual average rate of past\nyear methamphetamine use among males aged 18 to 25\n(1.8%), compared with 1.4% of females in this age group\n[23]. The present study also estimated a past year rate of\nabout 1.8% for young adult males but estimated compa-\nrable rates among young adults by gender.\nIn addition, the sample size of the current study (n =\n4,297), while still fairly large, may not have had sufficient\npower to detect statistically significant differences\nbetween demographic subgroups for a relatively low-prev-\nalence drug such as methamphetamine. For example, the\nhigher prevalence of current use among 18 to 25 year olds\ncompared with 26 to 49 year olds approached but did not\nreach statistical significance (p = .07). In comparison,\nthere were more than 67,700 completed interviews each\nyear in the combined NSDUH data for 2002 through\nAlthough data from the 2003 NSDUH were used in the\nfinal weight adjustments, methamphetamine use was not\n1 of the variables used in the weighting for the present\nstudy. Further, the NSDUH results discussed in this article\nare principally from the 2005 survey. Therefore, the com-\nparability of our findings on methamphetamine use with\nthose from NSDUH bolsters our confidence in our find-\nings based on the use of a large, national, probability sur-\nvey as a benchmark for calibrating our estimates.\nUnderreporting of methamphetamine use may be 1 issue\nfor both studies (and for survey measurement of metham-\nphetamine use in general) when questions about use of\nthis substance are asked in conjunction with questions\nWeighted Prevalence of Nonmedical Methamphetamine Use Among 18 to 25 Years Olds Who Were Students or Non-Stu-\ndents\nWeighted Prevalence of Nonmedical Methamphetamine Use Among 18 to 25 Years Olds Who Were Students or Non-Stu-\ndents.\nLifetime Past 3 Years Past Year Past Month\nWeighted Prevalence\nSubstance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2008, 3:19 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/3/1/19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nabout nonmedical use of prescription drugs. Although\nmethamphetamine can be available in prescription form,\nmost methamphetamine that is now used in the United\nStates is produced illegally in the United States or abroad\nIn recognition of this issue, the 2005 NSDUH included\nadditional questions to evaluate potential underreporting\nof methamphetamine use [2]. These new questions were\nasked in a \"noncore\" module separate from the \"core\"\nprescription stimulant use module; NSDUH includes\n\"core\" modules whose content is designed to stay con-\nstant across survey years to measure drug use trends and\nnoncore modules that can change from 1 year to the next\nWhen analyses combined positive responses to these non-\ncore questions with data from the core methampheta-\nmine questions, the NSDUH yielded lifetime prevalence\npersons aged 26 or older, compared with rates of 5.2% for\non the core data [2]. In terms of current (past month) use,\n25 year olds using their core questions, but this rate\nincreased to 0.83% when the noncore questions were\nadded [2].\nThis issue also is relevant to the present internet survey\nbecause the methamphetamine use questions in this\nstudy were taken directly from the core methampheta-\nmine questions in NSDUH and were asked in the context\nof questions about prescription drugs. Among persons\naged 18 to 25, our estimate of lifetime methamphetamine\nuse (6.0% with a standard error of 1.0) fell between the\nand 8.4% based on core and noncore data, though closer\nto the former. The estimate of current methamphetamine\nuse in this age group (0.6%) was the same as that in the\n2005 NSDUH based on the core data. These findings sug-\ngest that a similar effect on methamphetamine estimates\ndue to the placement of the methamphetamine questions\nin the context of questions about prescription drugs may\nhave occurred in the present survey.\nWeighted Prevalence of Nonmedical Methamphetamine Use in Relation to Type of Health Insurance\nWeighted Prevalence of Nonmedical Methamphetamine Use in Relation to Type of Health Insurance.\nPrivate/Others Public None\nLifetime Past 3 Years Past Year Past Month\nWeighted Prevalence\nNo significant differences.\nSubstance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2008, 3:19 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/3/1/19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nWe also recognize concerns about biases in the use of a\nnonprobability sample to make inferences about use of\ndrugs such as methamphetamine in a broader population.\nIn our study, therefore, it was important that we had a\nnationally representative probability survey such as\nNSDUH that we could use in weighting our data and as a\nbenchmark against which to compare our results. In par-\nticular, comparisons between estimates from the present\ninternet study and the 2005 NSDUH for methampheta-\nmine and other drug use variables that were not used in\nthe weighting procedures suggested that the 2-stage\nweighting process in the present study yielded estimates\nthat were comparable with those from NSDUH [21].\nHowever, we are not suggesting that internet studies such\nas this should (or can) replace the need for large, epidemi-\nologic surveys from probability samples. In fact, some sur-\nveys, particularly lengthy ones such as NSDUH that cover\na wide range of topics and average 1 hour in interview\ntime, would not be acceptable for an internet survey for-\nmat. Thus, in general, internet surveys should be used in a\ntargeted way to complement rather than replace findings\nfrom other data sources.\nKeeping in mind the limitations of internet studies, we\ncan suggest that regular internet surveys be considered by\nstates as a methodology for collecting data on metham-\nphetamine or other drug use. At the national level, several\nongoing telephone or in-person surveys (e.g., NSDUH,\nMonitoring the Future) already exist to monitor trends in\nmethamphetamine use. States, however, may find inter-\nnet surveys to be a promising option for collecting infor-\nmation rapidly and at relatively less cost. The speed and\nreduced cost of internet surveys may be particularly\nimportant when data relevant to a timely policy issue,\nsuch as enactment of legislation related to methampheta-\nmine, is required.\nThe specific cost for internet surveys likely varies with the\ncontent and length of the questionnaire, the groups being\ntargeted, the targeted sample size, the length of time\nrequired to get the targeted number of interviews, and\nother factors. The cost advantage of internet surveys lies\nprimarily with the fact that this methodology does not\nrequire interviewer labor, which is a key cost component\nof household surveys that are conducted in-person or via\ntelephone. In these other survey methods, interviewer\nlabor is required for screening sampled units (i.e., house-\nholds, telephone numbers), recontacting households or\nindividuals in which no one has responded or the sample\nmember is not available, and conducting the interview\nwith sample members who consent to be interviewed. In\nthe current study, the full survey was expected on average\nto take 20 minutes to complete. Not counting interviewer\nlabor for screening or for multiple recontact attempts,\ncompletion of a 20-minute telephone or in-person survey\nhours of labor just for interviewing.\nAnother cost advantage for internet surveys is that there\nare no data entry costs. Other methods of electronic data\ncapture, such as computer-assisted telephone interviewing\n(CATI) or computer assisted personal interviewing\n(CAPI), are sometimes used for noninternet surveys.\nMany studies, however, continue to use paper-and-pencil\nmethods that require considerable time for data entry and\nchecking. In addition, use of CAPI for in-person surveys\nrequires the purchase or availability of a fleet of laptop\ncomputers for data collection, and the interviewers need\nto transmit the data for merging into a data file; in an\ninternet survey, the respondent supplies the necessary\nhardware and software. Telephone interviews that use\nCATI would have costs associated with any long-distance\ncalling.\nA final cost issue is the ability of an internet survey design\nto target specific population subgroups to collect informa-\ntion rapidly and efficiently. In the survey that yielded the\ncurrent data on methamphetamine use, 4,300 responses\nwere obtained in only 3 weeks' time. A telephone survey\nwould likely require months rather than weeks to achieve\nthat number of interviews.\nAdditional research using national probability samples\nand focusing on methamphetamine use would be helpful\nto confirm the current findings. In particular, the current\nstudy targeted nonmedical users of prescription medica-\ntions rather than methamphetamine and used a nonprob-\nability design. Consequently, additional research using\nprobability samples or a future internet survey design tar-\ngeting methamphetamine users and that is benchmarked\nto a national probability survey such as NSDUH also\ncould increase the yield of methamphetamine users for\nfurther analyses. Given the breadth of topics that surveys\nsuch as NSDUH cover, future internet surveys that are cal-\nibrated to national probability surveys could be helpful as\nformative research for generating hypotheses and explor-\ning topics related to methamphetamine use in greater\ndepth.\nConclusion\nThis study used an internet panel weighted to reflect U.S.\npopulation norms to estimate the prevalence of metham-\nphetamine use among 18 to 49 year olds. The lifetime\nweighted prevalence was 8.6%, the past year weighted\nprevalence was 0.71%, and the prevalence of current use\n(past month) was 0.27%. These findings give rates of use\ncomparable to those reported in the 2005 NSDUH. Inter-\nnet surveys provide a rapid, relatively inexpensive way of\nobtaining data that may help inform policy decisions.\nSubstance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2008, 3:19 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/3/1/19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nAuthor Note\nFindings that were recently released from the 2006\nNSDUH, subsequent to the initial preparation of this\nmanuscript, took into account additional items on meth-\namphetamine that were added to the survey in 2006.\nThese additional items identified respondents who did\nnot report methamphetamine use earlier in the core stim-\nulants module because they did not think of it as a pre-\nscription stimulant.
