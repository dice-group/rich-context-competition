Estimates for the\nprevalence of hearing loss in the United States indicate that\n3.4% of the total hearing impaired population have a severe\nor profound hearing loss (>70 dB HL). In the United\nKingdom, this percentage was estimated as higher, with\n6.7% of the clinical population having a bilateral pure tone\naverage hearing loss greater than 70 dB HL.1,2 Taking\npopulation figures from 2013 and applying these prevalence\nfigures, based on hearing loss, gives an estimate of 2 million\nchildren and adults who could potentially benefit from\nimplantation in the these countries3 alone. However, as of\nwide had received a cochlear implant (CI).4 A proportion of\nthis discrepancy may be due to differences between the defi-\nnition of severe to profound hearing loss in the prevalence\nstudies and the specific CI criteria applied by the clinics, but\nthis still represents a fraction of those who could benefit\nfrom this technology. This has led researches to look more\nclosely at the penetration rates for this treatment.\nUtilization rates for CI, in both adults and children with\nsevere to profound loss, were reported in Sorkin and\nBuchman5 for Germany, Austria, Sweden, United Kingdom,\nAustralia, and the United States. These were based on the\nknown implanted population and prevalence data collected\nin the respective countries. Pediatric utilization rates ranged\n1MED-EL GmbH, Innsbruck, Austria\n2University of Antwerp, Belgium\n3Ghent University, Belgium\nCorresponding Author:\nPatrick S. C.

This is surprising given that utilization rates\nfor adult hearing aid use in people with a severe or profound\nhearing loss are high, at 70% to 90% and leads us to question\nwhy the uptake of CI in the adult population is so poor.6\nLack of funding has the potential to restrict the number of\nsuitable adults who are implanted. However, CIs have been\nshown to be highly cost-effective, with low complication\nrates, and in most developed economies, funding is provided\nby national health programs, employer-based insurance, or\nprivate insurance schemes.7,8 A contributing factor to the low\nnumbers of adults receiving implants is the low numbers of\nsuitable candidates presenting for assessment. We know that\nsome adults decide against being referred for or having a CI,\neven after being assessed as a suitable candidate, due to con-\ncerns around surgery, worries about losing residual hearing,\nrehabilitation requirements, and the hope that another tech-\nnology will come onto the market. Poor referral rates may\nalso be due to poor awareness and knowledge of the treat-\nment among professionals and patients, or even a negative\nperception of implants in the general population, due to the\npolitical issues around the impact implantation has on deaf\nculture and the deaf community.6 Adults over the age of 65\nyears have a greater prevalence of hearing loss but an even\nlower utilization rate for CI than younger adults with acquired\nloss9; for example, in Australia utilization in this group is\n0.3%.5 The perception of hearing loss as a natural conse-\nquence of the aging process, by both patient and profes-\nsional, acts as an additional barrier to treatment for this\ngroup, and people who regarded hearing loss as being incon-\nsequential and accept it passively are less likely to seek\nTheories of learning use models to explain and modify\nbehavior patterns. The Health Belief model provides a frame-\nwork to describe how people can be influenced to change\ntheir health-related behavior.11 The model states that 3 condi-\ntions are required to change behavior: (1) the existence of\nsufficient motivation (or health concern) to make health\nissues salient or relevant; (2) the belief that one is susceptible\nor vulnerable to a serious health problem or to the sequelae\nof that illness or condition (often termed \"perceived threat\");\nand (3) the belief that following a particular health recom-\nmendation, at a subjectively acceptable cost, would be ben-\neficial to reducing the perceived threat. Cost refers to the\nperceived barriers that must be overcome to follow the health\nrecommendation; it includes, but is not restricted to, finan-\ncial outlays. When this is translated into the area of hearing\nloss, we can state that people will take action to seek treat-\nment for hearing loss if they view hearing loss as a serious\nproblem, they feel sufficiently concerned about the severity\nof their hearing loss, and that there are more benefits than\nbarriers to amplification.12\nOne way of improving the awareness of hearing loss in\nthe general population, its impact and the treatments avail-\nable, is to put in place an education campaign. The purpose\nof any campaign would be to improve individuals' motiva-\ntion to take action and seek treatment. The aim of this study\nwas to assess the factors that contribute to individuals'health\nmotivation to take action and address their hearing loss. The\nolder adult population was targeted as the prevalence of\nhearing loss is higher in this group. The objective was to\ngather baseline data, in a range of countries, which would\nthen be used to measure the impact of any future interven-\ntions put in place to improve awareness.\nMethod\nAn online questionnaire, designed by the authors, to assess\nsubjects'current health motivation to seek treatment for their\nhearing loss was provided by a professional market research\ncompany (Karmasin Motivforschung, Vienna, Austria).\nSubjects were asked to complete the online questionnaire at\nhome. Data were collected from Austria, Germany, France,\nSweden, and the United Kingdom.\nThe questions were based around the Health Belief model,\nas shown in Figure 1 and looked at subject's perceived sus-\nceptibility to hearing loss, its severity (the perceived threat\nthat hearing loss presents), and the barriers to action. Fifteen\nclosed set questions were presented to assess subject's per-\nceptions in 3 areas: (1) their susceptibility to hearing loss, its\nimportance to them and its impact (the threat); (2) the barri-\ners that may prevent them from seeking treatment; (3) the\nactions that subjects currently take to address any hearing\nconcerns.\nPotential barriers to treatment were selected based on the\npersonal experience of the authors, gained from focus groups\nand talking to existing CI users and CI clinicians. These were\nidentified as being the visibility of the device or cosmetics,\nconvenience of use for all situations, including sports or\ngoing to bed, and management of the device. Questions were\ndesigned to assess the perception of both implants and hear-\ning aids, as a hearing aid is the alternative treatment option.\nRespondents were also asked if they thought there was any\ndifference between a hearing aid and a hearing implant and\nin hearing sensitivity between hearing aids and implants.\nThis was to assess if lack of perceived benefit or differences\nbetween implants compared with hearing aids was acting as\na barrier to implantation.\nThe questionnaire was translated from English into the\nrequired languages both forward and backward, to check for\nany translation errors. A pilot study was conducted to ensure\nthe clarity of the questions, with a group of normally hearing\nsubjects; any questions which were felt to be unclear or\nambiguous were reworded or deleted. The full questionnaire\nis provided in the appendix. The questions are grouped\naccording to their relevance to the Heath Belief model.\nD'Haese et al 3\nSubjects\nSubjects were recruited from a sample of individuals who\nwere held on the database belonging to the Karmasin\nMotivforschung market research company and received no\nreward for taking part. The subjects held on the database had\ngiven their informed consent to the company for their data\nto be used anonymously in studies and publications relating\nto any questionnaires completed. A subset of individuals\nwere selected from the database to participate in this study\nto provide a broad sample, representative of the general\npopulation of adults in each country. Factors taken into con-\nsideration were age and geographic region. Subjects were\nThe proportions of subjects in each group, by country, are\ngiven in Table 1. There was an equal split between men and\nwomen. Subjects were recruited during a period from June\ncountry until 100 fully completed questionnaires were col-\nlected. Incomplete questionnaires were discarded. The\nexclusion criteria were having no access to the Internet and\nnot being able to complete the questionnaire online.\nNo ethics approval was required for the study, which was\nconducted according to the principles laid out in the\nDeclaration of Helsinki.\nStatistics\nAs the purpose of the study was provide baseline data, only\ndescriptive statistics are provided for the percentage of\nrespondents selecting each option for the closet set ques-\ntions. Where a Likert rating scale has been used, mean values\nand ranges are given, but statistical comparisons are not\nmade between values.\nResults\nThe first 100 fully completed questionnaires for each coun-\ntry were included.\nPerceived Susceptibility to Hearing Loss and Its\nImpact or Threat Perception\nThese questions sought to establish how relevant informa-\ntion about hearing implants and hearing loss was to the sub-\njects, as well as the impact of hearing loss.\nQuestion 3.In 4 out of 5 countries, over 40% of respondents\nthought that hearing implants benefited all age groups equally\n(Table 2).\nQuestion 4. Hearing loss was most commonly viewed as the\nreduction in the ability to hear in all countries. Percentages of\nrespondents ticking this box ranged from 80% in the United\nKingdom to 43% in Sweden. In Germany and Austria, only\nof people, respectively, also selected \"hearing loss is the\ncomplete loss of the ability to hear.\" Between 33% and 18%\nof people thought hearing loss could be halted (Table 3).\nFigure 1. Flow diagram describing the health belief model, showing the factors which encourage individuals to take action to address\nhearing loss.\nTable 1. The Proportion of Subjects in Each Age Category (50-\nQuestion 5.The majority of subjects (range, 85%-59%)\nviewed the terms hearing loss and hearing impairment as\nbeing different from each other. The next most common\nanswer was \"don't know\" and over 80% of respondents\nticked either one or other of these boxes.\nQuestion 10.All countries listed having the volume of TVs\nand radios turned up very high as the main sign of possible\nhearing loss. Percentages ranged from 80% of subjects\nselecting this option in the United Kingdom to 51% in Swe-\nden. The top 4 other indicators in all regions were difficulties\nhearing high-pitched sounds, problems and difficulties in\nusing a telephone, an inability to locate background sounds,\nand constant ringing or buzzing in the ears. A much lower\npercentage of people selected problems using the telephone\nin Sweden and France than in other countries (30% and 29%\nQuestion 12.The top 4 consequences of hearing loss were\nrestricted communication (when face-to-face and when using\nthe telephone), impaired quality of life, social isolation, and\nfrustration. Four countries listed restricted communication as\nthe top consequence, with percentages ranging from 95% to\nQuestion 13. When asked \"How important is it for you per-\nsonally to have a good sense of hearing, to be able to hear\nwell?\" the mean rating and mode on a Likert scale was 1 for\nall countries, where 1 represents \"completely agree\" and 5\n\"do not agree at all\" (Table 4).\nActions Taken\nQuestion 6. Across all countries, people primarily found out\nabout medical issues from their doctor, followed by the\nInternet. Percentages ranged from 71% to 80% for the doctor\ndid not inform themselves about medical issues at all.\nQuestion 7. Again, the medical doctor and the Internet were\nthe most common sources of information for finding out\nabout hearing impairment. Percentages were generally lower\nthan for general health issues, but similar across countries,\nfor the Internet (France and the United Kingdom). In Ger-\nmany, France and Austria a high percentage of respondents\nhearing impairment.\nQuestion 8.The general practitioner (GP) and dentist were\nthe most common doctors to visit just as a precaution, and\npercentages were similar across countries, ranging from 68%\nFrance being the lowest figure. A low percentage of people\nvisited the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist with\npercentages ranging from 9% to 10% in Sweden and the\nUnited Kingdom to 21% to 28% for Germany France and\nAustria.\nQuestion 9.When those who had indicated in the previous\nquestion that they do not visit an ENT specialist as a precau-\ntion were asked why not, the reasons indicated were either\nnever had problems in that area (37%-43%) or, for 4 coun-\ntries, never thought to do so (32%-39%). The exception was\nFrance, where the second reason indicated was \"I do not\nthink it's necessary\" (34%) and \"never thought of doing so\"\nwas the fifth reason given (15%).\nQuestion 11.If suffering from a hearing loss over 96% of\npeople living in Germany would visit an ENT specialist and\n40% of them would visit a hearing aid acoustician. The fig-\nures are similar in Austria at 91% and 38%, respectively.\nFrance and Sweden would visit the ENT specialist (82% and\naid acoustician (26% and 36%). The United Kingdom fol-\nlowed a very different pattern with the GP being the first\nmedical specialist to consult (83%), an ENT specialist sec-\nond (45%), and the hearing aid acoustician fourth at 20%.\nBarriers to Treatment\nQuestion 2. When asked if there was a difference between a\nhearing aid and a hearing implant, the majority answered\nThe other barriers were addressed with 1 question where\nrespondents were required to rate each statement (shown in\nTable 5) on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 represents\n\"completely agree\" and 5 \"do not agree at all.\" Ratings of 1\nand 2 are grouped as \"agree\" and 4 and 5, \"disagree.\"\nThe lowest Likert ratings and therefore highest agreement\nratings for Sweden, Germany, Austria, and the United\nKingdom were for \"hearing implants are permanently fitted\nand do not need to be removed before bed,\" \"hearing implants\nare not externally visible,\" and \"hearing aids must be\nremoved before bed at night.\" Weaker agree ratings were\ngiven for \"hearing implants require regular maintenance\"\nand \"hearing aids can be a hindrance when doing sport.\"\nThe strongest disagree ratings for these 4 countries were\ngiven for \"qualitatively there is no difference between hear-\ning aids and hearing implants\" and \"hearing implants can be\na nuisance during physical activity\" followed by \"hearing\naids require a great deal of maintenance\" and \"it is usually\npossible to immediately identify people wearing hearing\naids.\"\nFrance has a slightly different pattern of responses; strong\nagreement ratings are given for \"hearing aids must be\nremoved before bed\" but also \"hearing implants require reg-\nular maintenance and adjustments.\" Agreement ratings are\nalso given for \"hearing implants can be a nuisance during\nD'Haese et al 5\nphysical activity.\" A strong disagreement rating is given for\n\"hearing implants are permanently fitted and do not need to\nbe removed before bed\" as well as \"qualitatively there is no\ndifference between hearing aids\" and \"it is usually possible\nto immediately identify people wearing hearing aids.\"\nDiscussion\nThe results of the survey provide an insight into the current\nopinions on hearing loss of the older adult population. The\nHealth Belief model was used as a framework to interpret the\ndata, and the questions were divided into categories to\naddress the 3 key areas. The model describes how, to take\naction to address a medical problem, the individual must per-\nceive that the condition presents a sufficient threat to their\nwell-being that exceeds any barriers. If utilization of CIs is to\nincrease, awareness of the impact of hearing loss and the\ntreatments available must be improved. To reduce the barri-\ners to cochlear implantation as an effective treatment, knowl-\nedge of its benefits and limitations must also be improved\nand any misconceptions corrected. The data gathered in this\nsurvey enabled the authors to assess how individuals per-\nceived their susceptibility to hearing loss, its impact on their\nlives, and some of the barriers which might be preventing\nthem from seeking a CI as a treatment. It also showed what\nactions people were taking once they had decided to seek\nhelp and provided a baseline to measure the impact of a\nplanned awareness campaign.\nWhen looking at the perceived threat, as expected, good\nhearing was regarded as being important in all countries.\nHowever, the wording of this question lead respondents\ntoward a positive response and a more open format might\nhave produced different results. Hearing loss was viewed as\neither a reduction in the ability to hear or, to a lesser extent,\nthe total loss of all hearing. This ambiguity in the definition\nof hearing loss was highlighted when subjects were asked if\nthere was a difference in the terms hearing loss and hearing\nimpairment; most answered either \"yes\" or \"don't know.\"\nThe World Health Organization uses the term hearing loss to\ncover all levels of hearing impairment and the terms are used\ninterchangeably by many professionals across all the coun-\ntries surveyed. On reflection, this question was confusing for\nmany respondents, reflected in the high number of don't\nknows and should have been removed after the pilot stage.\nWhen asked which age groups would benefit most from a\nhearing implant, most respondents identified all groups\nequally. In Sweden, more respondents selected the under 20s\ncompared with the other countries, but over 50% still selected\n\"all groups equally.\" However, in France the pattern was dif-\nferent. The older age groups were selected as being the most\nlikely to benefit, with low percentages for the under 20s and\n\"all groups equally.\" It is not know why the data were so dif-\nferent in this country. The age categories were set to keep\nconsistency across countries; however, if different age cate-\ngory boundaries were chosen or the age bands given names,\nthen the results could have been different. Prevalence data\nhave shown that hearing loss increases with age, but the pro-\nvision of implants in the over 65s is lower than in younger\npeople, despite there being no clinical barriers to older adults\nreceiving a CI.5,9,13-15 It was encouraging that in general,\nrespondents identified that older adults could benefit from an\nimplant. However, the lack of access in this group to appro-\npriate treatment is concerning, particularly as recent studies\nhave highlighted the relationship between untreated hearing\nloss, general health, and dementia.16,17\nThere was agreement across all countries that the main\nsign of hearing loss was turning the TV or radio up high and\nthe next 4 most frequent responses were also common to all\nTable 2. The Number of Responses in Each Country Given for Each Age Range to Question 3: Which Age Group Do You Think\nBenefits Most From a Hearing Implant?\nTable 3. The Number of Responses in Each Country Given for Each Answer to Question 4: Which of the Following Statements About\nHearing Loss Are Correct in Your Opinion?\nGermany UK France Austria Sweden\ncountries (difficulties hearing high-pitched sounds, problems\nand difficulties using a telephone, an inability to locate back-\nground sounds, and constant ringing or buzzing in the ears).\nThere was also a good understanding across all countries of\nthe consequences of hearing loss, although the exact order of\nthe responses varied slightly.\nWhen addressing the barriers to treatment, the questions\nfocused on the visibility of the device, the convenience of\nuse for all situations, specifically sports or going to bed, and\ngeneral management of the device. As not all barriers to\ntreatment were explored, the conclusions relating to this area\nof the survey can only be drawn based on the questions\nasked. Barriers such as fear of surgery, losing residual hear-\ning, and identity considerations were not considered as they\nwere not identified by the focus groups as key areas of con-\ncern at the time. Since the study was conducted, there is more\nawareness among professionals of some of these barriers to\nimplantation, and if the study were to be repeated, they\nshould be included.\nIn general, subjects knew that there was a difference between\nhearing aids and hearing implants (72% to 40%) and when\nasked if there was no qualitative difference (in terms of hearing\nsensitivity) between them, median scores tended toward dis-\nagree, indicating that a difference is perceived. However, we do\nnot know if the respondents understood what the differences\nwere. For the questions about hearing aids, there was general\nagreement across countries that hearing aids are not seen as\nbeing particularly visible and can be a hindrance while doing\nsport and must be removed before bed. They were also thought\nnot to require much maintenance, except in France where a\nslightly higher agreement rating was given for this statement.\nPerceptions of implants were the opposite. Four out of 5 coun-\ntries thought implants do not have to be removed before bed, are\nnot externally visible, need little maintenance, and are not a hin-\ndrance for physical activities. Only in France were implants cor-\nrectly viewed as externally visible, needing to be removed\nbefore bed, a hindrance for physical activities, and requiring\nregular maintenance and adjustment. Interpretation of these\nresults is complicated using the word \"implant\" when referring\nto a CI. The implanted part of the device cannot be removed and\nis not visible. However, to work the implanted device must be\nconnected to an externally worn microphone and speech proces-\nsor resembling a hearing aid, which can be removed. Although\nthe respondents may not know what a cochlear implant is, an\nimplant of any kind is not normally removed and only someone\nknowledgeable about CIs would know that the external speech\nprocessor can be removed. If some respondents in the sample\nwere aware of this distinction, they might still have answered,\ncorrectly, that the implant cannot be removed. When initial dis-\ncussions about hearing implants are taking place, the realization\nby patients that the external parts of a hearing implant are not\nvery different practically from a hearing aid and retain the same\nperceived stigma may deter patients from even agreeing to be\nreferred for an assessment.\nMedical issues were mostly researched through a doctor\nand then via the Internet, including those relating to hearing.\nThis would support the use of an Internet-based awareness\ncampaign, although, because it was an Internet based survey,\nthe sample selected was clearly already comfortable with\nInternet use. Internet use among older adults is known to\ndecline over the age of 75 years; nevertheless, survey data\nhave shown that around 70% of people in their early 70s go\nonline.18 In Germany, France, and Austria, a high percentage\nselves at all about hearing impairment.\nThe current precautionary health actions taken were most\ncommonly visits to the GP. Not many subjects said they\nwould visit an ENT specialist as a precautionary measure,\nwith the reasons given as never having had problems in this\narea or never thought to do so.\nWhen asked who they would visit if suffering from a hearing\nloss, patterns of behavior were dictated by country specific\nguidelines. In the United Kingdom, for example, the National\nHealth Service Web site advises people to visit the GP as the\nfirst person to consult for hearing issues and it is mandatory to\nconsult a GP before going to see an ENT specialist.19 In\nGermany and Austria, over 90% of people would visit an ENT\nspecialist and then a hearing aid acoustician. In France and\nSweden, people would first visit the ENT specialist followed by\nthe GPand third a hearing aid acoustician. In research looking at\nhearing aid uptake in the moderate to severely hearing impaired\ngroup, the GP's management of age-related hearing impairment\nwas found to be a barrier to seeking help for hearing impair-\nment, and this would be a factor against initially consulting a\nGP.12 In practice, those people within the audiometric criteria\nfor implantation are likely to be fitted with a hearing aid and\nTable 4.

It was decided not to distinguish between audi-\nologists and hearing aid acousticians in the survey. Hearing aid\nacousticians are present in all countries included in the study\nand are more numerous than audiologists. Training for audiol-\nogy varies widely in level and availability in the different coun-\ntries. There are hardly any audiology training programs in\nAustria and France and a few in Germany and Sweden; thus,\naccess to audiologists in these regions is limited, and hearing aid\nacousticians are the most likely professionals to be consulted.\nThe authors have made every attempt to control for bias in\nthe study results. However, bias may still be present in the study\nsample selected. The subjects who completed the questionnaire\nwere clearly technically competent enough to fill out a question-\nnaire online and were sufficiently interested in the topic to take\npart in the survey. There was no information provided on\nwhether subjects had an existing hearing loss or wore a hearing\naid, and this may have had a large impact on the levels of knowl-\nedge of the sample. There was also no data gathered on the edu-\ncation levels or socioeconomic group of the participants. The\nquestions asked were closed set and did not provide an opportu-\nnity for comment; this may be particularly relevant for the bar-\nriers to treatment suggested.\nFuture research will focus on the use of online, media based\nadvertising campaigns designed to raise awareness. The use of\nthe Internet as a source of medical information is becoming\ncommonplace, and the results of this survey support this find-\ning, even in the older age groups. The advertising will direct\nusers via a click through, to a Web site providing comprehen-\nsive information on implantable hearing devices. From this\npoint, the individual is free to access as much or as little infor-\nmation as they choose. The media outlets chosen will cover\nboth mainstream media and publications aimed at health care\nprofessionals and related to hearing. There is currently more\nawareness within the CI community that more training need to\nbe provided to hearing professionals and that hearing aids\nusers need to be made aware that a CI may be a suitable treat-\nment for them. This has resulted in some regional awareness\nactivities and other media campaigns funded by implant man-\nufacturers. The intention of this activity is to increase aware-\nness of cochlear implantation, and thus, it will be difficult to\nestablish the impact of this individual campaign on behavior.\nHowever, all of these activities are welcome and necessary as\nwithout action to improve awareness of this treatment, many\nindividuals who could have benefited from a CI will not\nreceive one.\nConclusions\nIn this sample of 50 to 70 years old, taken from multiple\ncountries, hearing loss was perceived as a problem. There\nwas a good understanding of the consequences and signs of\nhearing loss, but knowledge was limited. Cochlear implants\nwere viewed as being different to hearing aids, but not\nalways in the correct way, and there was little understand-\ning that the external speech processor was similar to a hear-\ning aid in its physical characteristics. Medical issues,\nincluding those relating to hearing, were mostly researched\nthrough a doctor and then via the Internet. It was encourag-\ning that when motivated to do so, people sought informa-\ntion from medical professionals, mostly GPs and ENT\nspecialists, about their hearing problems. The data collected\nin this first phase of the awareness campaign will be used as\na baseline to measure changes in the data, using the same\nsample population and questionnaire, following an Internet\nawareness campaign aimed at referring ENT clinicians and\nolder adults.\nTable 5.
