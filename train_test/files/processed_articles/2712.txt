This article uses recent panel data on\nparticipation in informal economic activity from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing\nStudy to examine factors associated with workers' participation and transitions in and out\nof the informal sector.\nPast studies of informal work in the United States have used cross-sectional data and\nfocused on small geographic areas and select populations, such as welfare and working-poor\nmothers in four U.S. cities (Edin and Lein 1997a, 1997b), low-income mothers in Boston,\nChicago, and San Antonio (Lein et al., 2005), Mexican immigrants in California (Marcelli,\nCornwell, and Findeis, 1995; Slack and Jensen, 2010) and rural Wisconsin (Larrivee and\nSchaffer, 2007), and the self-employed on New York's Lower East Side (Snyder, 2004).\nAlthough each of these studies provides significant insights into the informal work activities\nof a particular group at a particular place and time, none provides a nationally representative\nDirect correspondence to Samara R.

Furthermore, by looking\nonly at particular groups, the studies presuppose which groups are most likely to have high\ninformal labor force participation (Joassart, 2010).\nThis study updates and significantly expands our knowledge about informal economy\nparticipation by examining a much broader population and by incorporating panel data,\nwhich permits examination of transitions in and out of informal work. The article uses\ndata from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, the first large-scale panel\nsurvey that includes data on informal work in the United States, and results are nationally\nrepresentative of parents of children born during 1998\u00ad2000 in cities with population over\nResults reveal widespread participation in informal work: over the course of the nine-year\npanel, 53 percent of urban fathers with young children and 32 percent of urban mothers\nwith young children report working informally. Between 16 and 30 percent of urban\nfathers and 11 to 15 percent of urban mothers report some form of informal work each\nyear. The rates of informal participation in the panel data are much higher than revealed\nby many previous cross-sectional studies. Furthermore, informal work frequently occurs\nin conjunction with regular-sector employment. Men generally work in the regular and\ninformal sectors simultaneously, but women are equally likely to work in both sectors or\nin only the informal sector. Consistent with past work summarized by Williams (2010),\nprobit regressions show that informal work among urban U.S. parents of young children\nis widespread across socioeconomic groups and is not limited to marginalized populations.\nWorkers who work informally in conjunction with regular work are more likely to be\nnonminority race, higher education (mothers only), own credit cards, and work in skilled\nwhite- or blue-collar occupations. Workers who ever participate in only the informal sector\nare more likely to be younger, to have health limitations, and to have never worked in the\nregular sector.\nThe panel data reveal that informal economy participation spells are short but intense.\nConditional on working in the informal sector, individuals work informally for 16\u00ad23\nhours per week and 18\u00ad20 weeks per year on average. Consistent with the short spells,\nurban parents transition into and out of the informal sector frequently. Panel fixed-effects\nregressions show that transitions into the informal sector are strongly related to changes\nin regular-sector employment and occupation. Working in the regular sector is associated\nwith a 2 to 6 percentage point decrease in the probability of informal work. I do not find\nan association between informal work transitions and other life events, including changes\nin family structure, incarceration, health, and social program receipt.\nSimultaneous participation in the regular and informal sectors and the relationship\nbetween regular-sector occupation changes and participation in informal work both suggest\nthat regular-sector positions provide individuals with access to short-term informal-sector\nopportunities. Although participation in informal work is driven in part by individuals\nwho face barriers to work in the regular sector or who have exited the formal sector entirely,\nmany informal workers appear to use the skills or relationships they gain through regular\nemployment to take advantage of alternative earning opportunities.\nTheories of Participation in Informal Economic Activity\nHart (1973) introduced the term \"informal sector\" in the scholarly literature in a study\nof Ghanaian rural-to-urban migrants. Subsequent work in both developing and developed\ncountry contexts used varying definitions of the informal, hidden, underground, or shadow\n18 Social Science Quarterly\neconomy. In 2003, the 17th International Conference of Labour Statisticians formally\ndefined the informal sector as consisting of licit but unreported economic activity (i.e.,\nactivities that are inherently legal but are unreported to tax, social security, and labor law\nagencies) (International Labour Organization, 2003). The European Commission (2007)\nuses a similar definition of undeclared work in official communication and this definition\nis common in scholarly work (Williams, 2010).\nParticipation in the informal economy has been studied in both developed and developing\ncountry contexts and has traditionally been divided between the exclusion/marginality view\nand the exit view, as summarized by Chen (2012), Perry and Maloney (2007), and Williams\n(2010). The exclusion lens views informal-sector workers and small firms as engaging in\nmarginal activities because they are prevented from participating in the regular sector by\na segmented labor market, strict or costly regulations, or other cost differences associated\nwith informality. In contrast, the exit lens draws on the work of Hirschman (1970) and\nviews participation in informal economic activity as a deliberate choice to avoid regulation\nWindebank (2015) draw on work in transition economies and comparisons across E.U.\ncountries to advance an alternative view, drawing on institutional theory and public choice,\nthat informal activity rises due to conflict between formal and informal institutions, but\nempirical tests (G\u00a8\nclearly distinguish between this theory and alternatives.\nRecent work acknowledges the role of both exit and exclusion. Chen (2012) and Perry\nand Maloney (2007) argue that exclusion is more applicable to off-the-books work for\nemployers while exit more accurately characterizes informal self-employment. Women\nmay be more likely to face exclusion but also may be more likely to exit due to desire\nfor flexibility in balancing work and household responsibilities (Perry and Maloney, 2007;\nLein et al., 2005). Exit may be more relevant in developed economies (Williams, Horodnic,\nand Windebank, 2015), but even among developing countries there is a wide variation in\nhistory, legal systems, and institutions that may affect the relative importance of exit and\nPublic finance economists, in the tradition of Allingham and Sandmo's (1972) sem-\ninal article, have viewed informal work in the United States and Canada as a strategic\nresponse to differences in returns to work across sectors and have focused on the ef-\nfects of tax rates and penalties in developed countries: see Slemrod and Yitzhaki (2002)\nfor a review of the literature. Empirical studies generally find that higher tax and au-\ndit rates do increase behaviors associated with the informal sector. While the pub-\nlic finance literature is crucial for understanding the effects of tax and social policy,\nits focus on single factors does not provide a complete explanation of informal-sector\nparticipation.\nThis article uses panel data on transitions in and out of informal work to examine\nan alternative possibility: workers may use regular-sector employment to access informal\nopportunities. Regular-sector experience can provide workers with skills, connections, and\nother resources that facilitate opportunities for informal work, particularly of a part-time or\nproject-based nature. This is consistent with Williams's (2010:14) review of the literature\nfinding that \"informal work chiefly benefits those already in employment.\" This contrasts\nstrongly with the exclusion view in which informal work is a second-best alternative. Unlike\nthe exclusion view, the opportunities depend on participation in the regular sector. In the\nnext section, I examine the relationship between regular and informal-sector participation\nand the key characteristics associated with informal-sector participation across individuals\nand within individuals over time.\n  19\nData\nThe Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Survey, conducted by Princeton University's\nCenter for Research on Child Wellbeing, was designed to study family situations following\nU.S. cities with populations of over 200,000 were sampled, and separate mother and father\ninterviews were obtained at birth and at the child's first, third, fifth, and ninth birthdays. The\nresulting labor force participation data span years 1997 to 2009. Nonmarital births were\noversampled relative to marital births. Reichman et al. (2001) provide detailed information\nabout the sampling scheme.\nWhen sample weights are used, results are nationally representative of parents with babies\nsample, the Fragile Families study provides a wider view of the informal economy than we\nhave seen to date and provides the first survey data on transitions in and out of informal\neconomic activity. The data are particularly valuable for studying urban prime-age working\nfathers. Results for new mothers are not generalizable to other women because the data\nshow that mothers' work patterns change significantly during the years following the birth\nof a child.\nThe Fragile Families survey captures information about both regular work and illegal\nactivity and legal activities that are not reported to tax or regulatory authorities. Survey\nprofessionals distinguished between regular and informal work by instructing respondents\nto include regular income from self-employment or their own business as regular-sector\nwork. Respondents were then asked: \"We are interested in finding out about some ways,\nother than regular work, in which people make money. This kind of activity may be paid\nfor in cash, or done in exchange for meals, or clothing, or a place to live, or something else.\nPlease tell me if you have done any of the following in the last 12 months: work off the\nbooks or under the table (waves 1\u00ad3 only); work in your own business; sell or deliver drugs,\nengage in prostitution, or do other kinds of hustles; or do anything else to earn money?\"\nRespondents reported their form of compensation, earnings, weeks worked per year, and\naverage hours worked per week for both regular and each type of informal work. Fathers\nwere asked these questions in all five waves and mothers answered these questions for the\nfour waves after the baseline.\nI follow the International Labour Organization (2003) definition of informal work as\nlicit but unreported work as closely as possible. I define respondents as working informally\nif they report monetary compensation for working off the books, in their own business,\nor doing anything else to earn money. I do not include drug sales, prostitution, and\nother hustles. I also exclude informal work for which respondents receive only noncash\ncompensation. Only 3.4 percent of fathers and less than 0.5 percent of mothers report illicit\nactivity across the entire panel. Excluding informal work done for noncash compensation\nhas similarly minimal effects: including it increases overall participation in the informal\neconomy by only 1 (fathers) to 1.5 (mothers) percentage points.\nMethods\nI use probit models to examine the characteristics of individuals who work informally\nat some point in the Fragile Families panel. I regress an indicator for ever participating in\ninformal work on a vector of control variables, including age at baseline; race indicators;\nindicators for ever married during the survey, ever cohabiting, and ever having children\nin the household; education at baseline; ever worked in regular sector; average household\n20 Social Science Quarterly\nincome from sources other than the respondent's labor; ever incarcerated; social safety net\nparticipation; car ownership and use of financial services; times moved; health limitations;\nand type of regular-sector occupation.\nI next take advantage of the panel data to investigate the frequent transitions in and\nout of the informal sector. I use fixed-effects regressions to model within-individual vari-\nation in participation in informal work over time. In addition to time variation in the\nvariables described previously, I control for time-varying state economic conditions: state\nunemployment rates, minimum wages, and refundable state earned income tax credits. The\nindividual fixed-effects control for all time-invariant observable and unobservable individ-\nual characteristics. Last, I use pooled Tobit and panel fixed-effects regressions to examine\nannual hours worked in the informal sector.\nDescriptive Analysis: Informal Work Patterns\nTable 1 shows unweighted and weighted summary statistics for the full Fragile Fam-\nilies sample. The average age of respondents at baseline was 25 in the raw data and 27\nafter weighting. Three-quarters of the respondents were either black or Hispanic. The\nunweighted sample is disproportionately low education, with 34 percent of the respon-\ndents reporting less than a high school education in the first wave. Average educational\nattainment increased over the survey period.\nAlthough the survey design specified that only one-quarter of the births in the sample\nwere to married couples, an additional 44 percent of fathers and 36 percent of mothers\nsurveyed report cohabiting. Respondents averaged two biological children in the first wave.\nAt baseline, fathers' unweighted average household income was $50,837 (all income in\n2011 $), very close to 1999 median household income for central city households of\nreflecting fathers who live apart from their children. Mothers' average household income\nwas lower than fathers' at $43,320, but well above the 1999 median for female householders\nwith no spouse present of $35,326. Nineteen percent of mothers reported receiving TANF\nbenefits during the past year.\nFathers were most likely to work in occupations relating to precision production, craft,\nor repair (25 percent at baseline); service (18 percent); or as handlers, equipment cleaners,\nor laborers (13.5 percent). Mothers were most likely to work in service (33 percent at\nbaseline) or administrative support (24 percent). By the fifth wave, nearly one-quarter\nof fathers in the sample had spent time in jail, in line with high incarceration rates for\nblack and Hispanic men. Nearly one-fifth of mothers in the sample received Temporary\nAssistance for Needy Families (TANF) and 45 percent received food stamps.\nTable 2 shows that most urban fathers work a regular job. Annual regular-sector partic-\nipation ranges between 83 and 88 percent across waves, and overall fathers are employed\nin the regular sector in 86 percent of person-year observations (column 1). (Statistics by\nwave are available from the author.) Ninety-six percent of urban fathers worked in the\nregular sector at some point during the survey period (column 2). Regular-sector labor\nforce participation is lower for mothers, and only 76 percent of urban mothers worked in\nthe regular sector at some point. It is important to remember, however, that all mothers\nin the survey have at least one child under age nine in every wave. Mothers' labor force\nparticipation does increase as their children age, rising from 51 percent in wave 2 to 61\npercent in wave 5.\n  21\nSummary Statistics: Fragile Families Data\nFathers Mothers\nUnweighted Weighted Unweighted Weighted\nContinued\n22 Social Science Quarterly\nContinued\nFathers Mothers\nUnweighted Weighted Unweighted Weighted\nOccupation:\nprofessional/technical\nOccupation:\nexecutive/admin/managerial\nOccupation: administrative\nsupport\nOccupation: precision\nproduction/craft/repair\nOccupation: machine\noperator/assembly/inspection\nOccupation:\ntransportation/material moving\nOccupation: handler/equipment\ncleaner/laborer\nNOTE: Author's calculations using the Fragile Families sample weighted to be nationally representative of parents of babies born in 1998\u00ad2000 in cities with populations\n  23\nParticipation Rates in Regular and Informal Work\nEver Participated, Ever Participated,\nFull Full by Regular-Sector Occupation by Race\nSample, Sample,\nAnnual Ever White Blue\nParticipation Participated Collar Service Collar White Black Hispanic\nCombinations\nTypes of informal work\nCombinations\nTypes of informal work\nNOTE: Author's calculations using the Fragile Families sample weighted to be nationally representative of parents of babies born in 1998\u00ad2000 in cities with populations\nover 200,000. Types of informal work do not sum to total of any informal because some individuals engage in multiple types of informal work. Respondents are assigned\nto a regular-sector occupation category if they work in that occupation category during more than half of observed waves.\n24 Social Science Quarterly\nInformal-sector participation rates are high. Fathers report participated in informal work\nin 23 percent of person-year observations (Table 2, column 1), with rates varying from 18\nto 31 percent across waves. Mothers report informal work in 14 percent of person-year\nobservations. These participation rates are similar to those estimated by O'Neill (1983) and\nsomewhat higher than those found by Lemieux, Fortin, and Frechette (1994). Edin and\nLein (1997a) found much higher annual participation rates of 32\u00ad52 percent among the\nsubpopulation of welfare mothers and 20\u00ad37 percent of low-income wage-reliant mothers\nin particular cities, but their study concentrates on low-income mothers rather than all\nurban mothers. Informal participation rates are lowest in waves 4 and 5 when the survey\ndid not ask explicitly about off-the-books work.\nThe unique longitudinal aspect of the Fragile Families data reveals that an impressive\n53 percent of urban fathers and 32 percent of urban mothers of young children work\ninformally during the nine-year survey. Edin and Lein (1997a) warn that it is difficult to\nget accurate responses to survey questions about informal work because of the incentives\nto hide income information from welfare caseworkers and other officials. There is no way\nto know the extent of underreporting in the Fragile Families data, but the possibility of\nunderreporting makes the high rates of informal work participation found in the data\nparticularly noteworthy.\nOverall, fathers reported working in both sectors in 18.8 percent of father-year obser-\nvations, but work exclusively in the informal sector in only 4 percent of observations. It\nappears that, for urban fathers of young children, informal work is almost always under-\ntaken in conjunction with regular work. This may explain why Rich, Garfinkel, and Gao\n(2007) do not find evidence that strong child support enforcement increases annual hours\nof work in the underground: if fathers continue to work in the regular sector, they will still\nbe subject to child support enforcement. These fathers have neither fully exited the regular\nlabor market nor are they excluded from it.\nThe patterns for mothers of young children are quite different. In contrast to the\nexperience of women in developing countries (International Labour Organization, 2014),\nmothers report lower levels of informal-sector participation than men and mothers are\nequally likely to work in both sectors or in only the informal sector. Because of the\ndifferences in informal work by gender, I conduct the rest of the analysis separately for\nmen and women. This contributes further to the literature, as Windebank and Williams\n(2010:82) observe that \"the work relations and motives underpinning the informal work\nundertaken by men and women [in developed nations] have not been investigated.\" Edin\nand Lein (1997a,1997b) find that mothers may use the informal sector to shield income\nfrom welfare agencies, an exit motivation. Women might also be less likely to work in jobs\nor occupations that allow substitution between informal and regular work or women could\nbe unable to work as many hours as men due to child-care or home production demands.\nThis is consistent with the findings of Windebank and Williams (2010), who use data\nfrom the English Localities Survey and report that men's informal work is generally more\nsimilar to regular work, while women's is more like unpaid work and is often a formal way\nto trade favors among friends, neighbors, and family members. Gender differences should\nbe interpreted cautiously, however, because they may be specific to stage of life and the\nperiod following birth of a child.\nOff-the-books activities are the most common type of work for urban fathers in each\nwave, with 29 percent working under the table at some point during the survey and 13\u00ad16\npercent working under the table in each wave. Over a quarter of urban fathers operate\ntheir own business. Individuals may change how they define their work from one wave\nto another, especially because the survey discontinued the \"off-the-books\" option after\n  25\nColumns 3\u00ad8 of Table 2 show cumulative participation rates by sector and race across\nall waves of the survey. White- and blue-collar fathers have similarly high rates of informal-\nsector participation at 57 and 55 percent, respectively, while 46 percent of service-worker\nfathers work informally across the panel. Fathers' informal-sector participation is higher for\nwhites (59 percent) than for blacks and Hispanics (53 and 48 percent). The key differences\nacross regular-sector occupation types become visible when examining how fathers combine\nregular and informal work. White-collar fathers not only have the highest rates of informal\nwork, but they are most likely to combine regular and informal work in the same year. They\nhave the lowest rates of off-the-books work. They are disproportionately likely to work\ninformally in their own business at 32 percent. Fathers in the service industry, on the other\nhand, are about equally likely to work only in the informal sector but are much less likely to\nwork in both the regular and informal sectors, suggesting that it is much more difficult to\nsubstitute between regular and informal work in service industry jobs. Blue-collar fathers\nfall somewhere between white-collar and service industry fathers regarding work in both\nsectors versus work in the informal sector only, but their informal work is characterized\nby a high rate of off-the-books work, with 36.5 percent of blue-collar fathers reporting\noff-the-books work over the three-year period this question was asked.\nThe divide between white-collar and service work in terms of regular versus informal\nparticipation does not occur for mothers. Mothers in the service industry are slightly more\nlikely to work informally than white-collar mothers (37 vs. 31 percent) and are more likely\nto work in the informal sector or not work during some point in the panel. Mothers in\nservice are also more likely to work off the books than mothers in white-collar jobs, but\nhave similar rates of working informally in their own business. The sample of mothers in\nblue-collar jobs is quite small (n = 264), but their labor force participation is characterized\nprimarily by low rates of regular-sector work rather than unusual patterns of informal work.\nThese results suggest that certain types of regular-sector work are more likely to pro-\nvide specific kinds of informal-sector opportunities, with white-collar work facilitating\nself-employment and blue-collar work disproportionately providing opportunities off the\nbooks. This contrasts with the exclusion view of informal work, in which lack of opportu-\nnities in the regular sector drives informal-sector participation, or the exit view, in which\nrejection of regular-sector constraints or restrictions drives informal work.\nTable 3 shows that, conditional on working in the regular sector, men work 46\u00ad49\nhours per week on average while women work between 35 and 41 hours: this holds across\nsubgroups. Informal work represents a serious time commitment on the part of many\nurban families. Fathers and mothers who work informally average 22 and 16 hours per\nweek, respectively, with service workers and Hispanic mothers working more informal\nhours. Interestingly, these stints of informal work appear comparatively short-lived. While\nfathers report working in the regular sector for 47 weeks annually on average, they report\nworking off the books for only 12 weeks annually and in their own business 31 weeks\nannually. Mothers' stints in the informal sector are comparable and also shorter than their\nspells in the regular sector. White-collar fathers and Hispanic mothers and service industry\nmothers have comparatively long stints. These short stints might suggest project-based\ninformal opportunities that workers access through their regular-sector participation, but\nthis cannot be determined with the data. Alternately, they could indicate failure of informal\nenterprises or exhaustion on the part of workers trying to maintain participation in both\nsectors.\nTable 3 also reports average reported earnings for regular work and informal work,\nconditional on participation. The summary statistics suggest that average hourly wages in\nmost of the informal sector are similar to, and sometimes higher than, those in the regular\n26 Social Science Quarterly\nAverage Hours and Weeks Worked and Annual Earnings in the Regular and Informal Sectors,\nConditional on Working in Sector (All Waves Pooled)\nWhite Blue\nOverall Collar Service Collar White Black Hispanic\nFathers\nUsual hours per week\nWeeks worked last year\nMothers\nUsual hours per week\nWeeks worked last year\nNOTE: Author's calculations using the Fragile Families sample weighted to be nationally representative of\nutive/administrative/managerial, professional/technical, sales, or administrative support fields.

Interestingly, when the same data are examined on a wave-by-wave basis rather\nthan pooling the data across waves, informal wages are slightly lower than regular-sector\nwages. Average informal hourly wages are almost always well above the minimum wage\nfor all gender, race, and occupation categories. These wages are similar to those found\namong informal day laborers in New York by Melendez, Theodore, and Valenzuela (2010),\n  27\nTransitions In and Out of Regular and Informal Work Between Waves\nFathers Mothers Fathers Mothers Fathers Mothers Fathers Mothers\nRegular only Both Informal only Neither\nSector in Next Wave\nSector in Current Wave\nNeither\nInformal only\nBoth\nRegular only\nwho point out that the hourly rate is high but that the unstable nature of day laboring\nresults in low monthly wages. The high hourly wages also reflect the predomination of\ncoincident regular-sector and informal-sector work and the prevalence of informal work\nacross occupations, and further suggest that many informal opportunities can best be\naccessed through regular-sector participation.\nTables 2 and 3 show that participation rates in informal work are high, especially among\nmen, but informal work spells are short relative to spells in the regular sector. This is\nconsistent with the high cumulative participation rate in the informal economy over the\nfive-year survey period, in which half of all fathers and over one-fourth of mothers worked\ninformally. The short spells and high cumulative participation suggest frequent transitions\nin and out of the informal sector.\nFigure 1 explores transitions between sectors across waves. Approximately three-quarters\nof workers who work only in the regular sector in any wave continue to work exclusively\nin that sector in the next wave. Compared to them, workers who work in both sectors or\nin the informal sector only are much more likely to work informally in the next period.\nWorking in only the informal sector is associated with much higher rates of subsequent\nnonwork. Interestingly, this is not true in the opposite direction: those who work in\nneither sector in one wave are less likely to work informally in the subsequent wave\nthan the population at large. For both fathers and mothers, working in both sectors in\none wave is associated with lower rates of work in neither sector in subsequent waves,\nsuggesting that those who work in both sectors are strongly positioned to access future\nopportunities.\nThe descriptive statistics suggest that exclusion from the formal sector does not fully\nexplain participation in informal economic activity. First, informal work typically oc-\ncurs simultaneously with regular-sector work. Second, informal work is widespread, with\nmore than half of prime-age urban fathers working informally at some point over the\ncourse of a decade. Third, transitions in and out of the informal sector occur frequently,\nbut working in both sectors is associated with the lowest rates of neither-sector work\nin subsequent waves. Combined, these patterns indicate that regular-sector work pro-\nvides access to valuable and flexible informal opportunities for some workers but need\n28 Social Science Quarterly\nnot result in exit from the regular sector. I next turn to a further examination of par-\nticipation in informal work and factors driving transitions in and out of the informal\nsector.\nRegression Results\nTable 4 shows the average marginal effects from probit regressions of ever working\ninformally on a vector of personal characteristics using data from waves 1\u00ad4 (fathers) and\n2\u00ad4 (mothers). Results using waves 1\u00ad5 (and consequently excluding occupation data)\nare similar. Coefficients from OLS regressions are nearly identical to the probit marginal\neffects. Results are shown for ever working informally, ever working in both regular and\ninformal sectors in the same year, and ever working only in the informal sector.\nAge at baseline is negatively related to informal work overall and only informal work,\nbut not to working in both sectors. Because the sample is based on births, this may be\npicking up characteristics of parents who are older when they have children rather than the\nrelationship of age to informal work, although Lemieux, Fortin, and Frechette (2004) do\nfind that age is negatively related to informal work. Ever-married mothers are 4 percentage\npoints more likely to report informal work than their never-married counterparts, and\nfathers who live with children at some point in the sample period are significantly more\nlikely to report informal work. Not having a high school diploma at baseline is associated\nwith a 5 percentage point increase in the probability of informal work for fathers.\nHispanic fathers are less likely to report working informally than their white counterparts.\nThis effect is mitigated by controlling for citizenship: citizen fathers are 12\u00ad15 percentage\npoints more likely to report informal work. If this indicates reporting differences across\ncitizen and noncitizen Hispanics, then the true rate of informal work is even higher than\nreported. Hispanic mothers are 7 to 8 percentage points less likely to report working\ninformally, all else equal. Black mothers are also 4 to 5 percentage points less likely to\nreport working informally than their white counterparts, with no effect for mothers who\nwork in both sectors.\nEver working in the regular sector has no significant effect on informal work for fathers\noverall, which is expected due to the very high rates of men's participation in regular work\nand consequent lack of identifying variation. No effect is found for women either. Ever\nworking in the regular sector reduces the probability of working only in the informal sector\nby 14 percentage points for men and 9 percentage points for women. Fathers who work\nin either white- or blue-collar jobs are 3 percentage points more likely to work informally\nthan service workers, and these effects are driven by fathers who work in precision pro-\nduction/craft/repair, as handlers/equipment cleaners/laborers, and in professional/technical\nfields. Mothers who work additional waves in white-collar jobs are 1 percentage point less\nlikely to work informally.\nOther indicators of stability and financial sophistication are strongly related to ever\nparticipating in informal work. Having a credit card is associated with informal work\nparticipation for both men and women, although there is no relationship between having a\nbank account and informal work. Number of times moved during the panel is also strongly\nassociated with informal participation, with each additional move corresponding to a 1 to\n2 percentage point increase in the probability of informal work. Bruinsma (2006) observes\nthat moving restricts families' access to networks of friends and family who can assist with\nchildcare and that it takes considerable time to establish new networks, which may explain\nthe increased reliance on informal work associated with moving.\n  29\nProbit Regressions (Average Marginal Effects): Ever Worked Informally\nFathers: Ever Participated in Mothers: Ever Participated in\nInformal Informal\nAny and Informal Any and Informal\nInformal Regular Only Informal Regular Only\nContinued\n30 Social Science Quarterly\nContinued\nFathers: Ever Participated in Mothers: Ever Participated in\nInformal Informal\nAny and Informal Any and Informal\nInformal Regular Only Informal Regular Only\nNOTE: All columns include state fixed effects in which state is determined by residence at baseline.

Mothers who ever report\nthat their health limits their work are significantly more likely to report informal work, but\nhealth limitations affect informal work only for fathers' participation in only informal work.\nI also find a relationship between reliance on the social safety net and informal work for\nfathers who ever received food stamps and mothers who ever received food stamps or TANF.\nOverall, the results show that different characteristics are associated with informal work\ndone in conjunction with regular-sector work versus working only in the informal sector.\nBeing a citizen, having spent time in jail or prison, receiving food stamps, and moving\nare positively associated with both types of informal work and are consistent with tra-\nditional portrayals of informal workers as those excluded from regular-sector work. But\nother characteristics suggest that many of those who work in both sectors simultaneously\nare comparatively economically advantaged. Respondents who ever report participating in\nboth regular and informal work in the same year are less likely to be black (fathers only)\nand Hispanic, more likely to own credit cards, more likely to have some college (mothers\nonly), and fathers are more likely to work in skilled white- or blue-collar occupations\nsuch as professional/technical fields or precision production/craft/repair. This is consistent\nwith regular-sector work providing access to additional informal opportunities. In contrast,\nrespondents who ever report participating only in the informal sector are relatively econom-\nically disadvantaged. They are more likely to be younger, to have health limitations, and to\nhave never worked in the regular sector. Mothers are more likely to have received TANF.\nNext, I take advantage of the panel data to investigate individuals' changes in informal\nwork participation over time. Table 5 shows results from panel fixed-effects regressions.\n(Conditional logit models did not converge. Probit marginal effects and OLS coefficients\nare nearly identical in the ever participate regressions, suggesting that the linearity constraint\nis not problematic in this context.) Not all variables are available in all waves: column 1 uses\ndata from all waves while other columns introduce variables available only in some waves.\nThese models use only the variation in an individual's informal work activity over time,\nrather than variations across individuals. A key advantage of this method is that it controls\nfor time-invariant components of individuals' taste for informal work and identifies changes\nin circumstances that drive informal participation.\nThe dominant finding of Table 5 is that fathers' informal participation is strongly\nrelated to regular-sector job in that wave. Working in the regular sector decreases mothers'\ninformal-sector participation by 2 percentage points, but the results are not significant\nacross all specifications. For fathers, working in a regular job during the past year is\nassociated with a 4 to 6 percentage point reduction in the probability of informal work,\nconsistent with the view that workers turn to the informal sector when regular work\nis unavailable. But the high rates of employment for fathers mean that the variation in\nregular work can only explain part of the variation in informal work. Transitions in regular\nemployment type also have strong explanatory power: switching to a blue-collar job increases\nthe rate of informal work by 7 percentage points. Results using more detailed occupation\nindicators (not shown) find large effects for certain blue- and white-collar professions: a 6\npercentage point increase in probability for handlers/equipment cleaners/laborers and 10 to\n11 percentage point increases for professional/technical workers, salesmen, and workers in\nprecision production/craft/repair fields. Again, this is consistent with certain regular-sector\npositions providing access to additional informal earning opportunities.\nAlthough the results for ever working informally in Table 4 show a relationship between\ninformal work and stability variables, including incarceration, social safety net receipt, and\ncredit card access, the panel fixed-effects regressions do not show a connection between the\n32 Social Science Quarterly\nPanel Fixed-Effects Regressions: Dynamics of Participation in Informal Work\nFathers Mothers\nWaves Waves Waves Waves Waves Waves\nNOTE: Standard errors clustered at the individual level in parentheses.\n Significant at 5 percent;  significant at 1 percent.\n  33\ntiming of these events and informal work. The lack of incarceration effect is particularly\ninteresting because changes in incarceration status capture changes in barriers to regular-\nsector participation due to employer screening for criminal history. Mothers work less in the\ninformal sector when state minimum wages are higher. I do not find effects for state Earned\nIncome Tax Credits (EITCs) or state unemployment rates. Number of moves since the last\nwave is significantly related to the probability of informal work for fathers, suggesting that\ninformal workers' situations are less stable. The results also do not show effects on informal\nparticipation from life events such as marriage or divorce, children living in the household,\nor changes in health that limit work. Robustness checks (not shown) that included other\nlife events including the death of a parent and transformative religious experience also did\nnot reveal relationships with informal work. The variables most closely related to changes\nin informal work are measures of regular work participation.\nI also examine the intensiveness of informal activity using annual hours of informal work\nas the dependent variable. (Results are available from the author.) Black mothers report\nmore hours of work conditional on working informally. Working in the regular sector is\nnegatively related to informal hours worked in both the pooled cross-section and panel\nregressions for fathers, but the results disappear when controls for occupation are added\n(and, consequently, wave 5 data are excluded). Increases in other household income are\nassociated with fewer hours of informal work. The regressions reveal several relationships\nbetween financial assets and service use and informal work intensity. Fathers' access to\ncredit cards is positively associated with informal hours worked across specifications. The\nreasons are not clear: this may be because informal work and credit spending are both\nused to smooth income, or credit spending might be used to finance costs associated with\nsetting up small businesses. Mothers with bank accounts work significantly fewer hours in\nthe informal sector, while mothers who own vehicles work significantly more hours.\nThe strong relationship between fathers' occupation and participation in informal\nwork is less apparent when we examine intensity in the informal sector. The pooled\nTobit regressions do not reveal any relationships between occupation and hours. The\nfixed-effects regressions find higher hours for sales and transportation/material moving.\nHowever, conditioning on informal participation and controlling for individual fixed-\neffects results in estimates based on the small number of individuals who transition be-\ntween sectors across waves, which is particularly limiting for mothers due to lower rates of\ninformal work.\nDiscussion\nData from the largest, most widely representative survey of informal work in the United\nStates reaffirm several results from prior studies focusing on subpopulations. Informal work\nis widespread across socioeconomic groups and is not limited to marginalized populations:\nalthough participants in the informal economy are more likely to be young, less-educated,\nreliant on social safety net programs, and formerly incarcerated, they are also more likely\nto be white, U.S. citizens, married, work in the regular sector, have a credit card, and\n(for men) work in professional or technical fields. Men's and women's informal work\npatterns differ greatly, and while men generally work in the regular and informal sectors\nsimultaneously, women are equally likely to work in both sectors or only the informal sector.\nThe longitudinal data reveal that the population of informal workers is even broader than\npreviously documented: over half of all urban fathers of young children and more than a\nquarter of urban mothers work informally at some point during a nine-year period. The data\n34 Social Science Quarterly\nalso show the frequent transitions in and out of the informal sector. Only 3 percent of fathers\nand 2 percent of mothers work informally in all waves. Workers transition in and out of\nshort but intense informal work spells, and transitions into the informal sector are correlated\nwith exiting the regular sector and, for fathers, changes in regular-sector occupation.\nThe attributes associated with informal work include both characteristics associated\nwith marginalized populations and traits associated with strong financial resources and\nlabor market attachment. The apparent tension between these attributes can be largely\nresolved by separately considering informal work that is undertaken simultaneously with\nregular work, and complements it, versus informal work that substitutes for regular-sector\nwork during periods of unemployment. Experience in skilled white- or blue-collar occu-\npations increases the probability of working in both sectors simultaneously, and changes\nin occupation are one of the few observable individual characteristics correlated with\nchanges in informal work. Different occupations also display different patterns of in-\nformal work behavior. This suggests that regular work opens doors to informal work\nopportunities.\nFuture work should examine this process in greater detail: To what extent do workers exit\nthe regular sector to pursue new informal opportunities versus using the informal sector\nto cushion the loss of regular-sector employment? Do workers choose their regular-sector\noccupation in order to work in both sectors? How does informal work affect well-being? If\ninformal work spells end because workers have earned enough to cushion themselves from\nshocks in regular-sector income, then informal work can effectively supplement family\nwelfare. On the other hand, informal work may decrease well-being if the spells end\nbecause of failed businesses or exhaustion on the part of workers engaged in both formal\nand informal work.\nThe Fragile Families data indicate that urban parents of children born between 1998 and\nIf other adults are equally likely to work informally, this yields a back-of-the-envelope\ncalculation that indicates that total informal earnings in the United States among working-\nhalf a percent of GDP, far below the estimated 7\u00ad10 percent of GDP that indirect techniques\nsuggest as the size of the informal economy (see, for example, Schneider, 2005), although\ninternational statistical agencies generally view these estimates as overstated (European\nCommission, 2007). Despite the difference, the magnitude of unreported earnings in the\nFragile Families data is still large enough to have serious policy implications. The foregone\npayroll taxes on these earnings were $7.6 billion each year, about 1 percent of payroll tax\nreceipts. Total informal earnings exceeded annual federal spending on each of the Earned\nIncome Tax Credit, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and the Supplemental\nNutrition Assistance Program during the survey period. Better understanding the effect of\ninformal work on household well-being is important for guiding policy and determining\nwhether efforts should concentrate on formalizing informal work or strengthening regular-\nsector opportunities.\nREFERENCES\nAllingham, Michael G., and Agnar Sandmo. 1972. \"Income Tax Evasion: A Theoretical Analysis.\" Journal of\nBruinsma, Beth. 2006. \"Low-Income Women Negotiating Employment Opportunities, Wages, and Child\nCare Needs in San Antonio.\" In Jane Henrici, ed., Doing Without: Women and Work After Welfare Reform.\nTucson: University of Arizona Press.\n  35\nChen, Martha Alter. 2012. \"The Informal Economy: Definitions, Theories and Policies.\" Women in Informal\nEmployment Globalizing and Organizing Working Paper No. 1.
