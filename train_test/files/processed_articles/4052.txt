In this paper we look at maternal guilt as a consequence of\nconditional maternal investment. Solicited texts written by Finnish mothers with under\nschool-aged children in 2007 (n = 63) described maternal emotions perceived as difficult\nand forbidden. Content analysis of guilt-inducing situations showed that guilt arose from\ndiverging interest and negotiations between the mother and child (i.e., classic parent-\noffspring conflict). Also cultural expectations of extensive and perpetual high-quality\nmaternal investment or the \"motherhood myth\" induced guilt in mothers. We argue that\nguilt plays an important role in maternal-investment regulation. Maternal guilt is predicted\nto vary with social and cultural context but also to show universal characteristics due to\nparent-offspring conflict and allomaternal manipulation.

II).\n\"I doubt that genuine maternal feeling ever rids itself, even momentarily, of all hostile\n\"Being a mother is all about guilt.\" (Finnish mother, 2007).\nEvery human being has been in the position of a child expecting care from a mother\nand preferring her to be as devoted as possible. Above, a quotation from the Russian author\nMaternal Guilt\nand father Maksim Gorkii illustrates this perspective on motherhood, which in feminist\ncritique and lay talk is often referred to as the \"motherhood myth.\" By contrast, only some\nof us become mothers and thus become the opposition in the mother-offspring conflict. In\nthe second introductory quote, the female French author and mother Colette describes a\nmore tension-ridden view of maternity. Third, a contemporary Finnish mother indicates\nthat guilt plays a crucial role in determining the boundaries a mother has to draw between\nthe diverging interests of the child and herself.\nThis article discusses the ultimate and proximate reasons for maternal guilt. We\npoint to some lacunae in existing evolutionary research on motherhood and parenting and\nanalyze guilt-inducing situations based on textual data from contemporary Finnish mothers.\nConditional maternal investment\nHumans are cooperative breeders. Extensive maternal investment is almost always\nsupplemented by allomaternal care from others, for instance fathers, grandparents, siblings,\naunts, etc., as well as more distant kin and non-relatives. Cooperative breeding is a form of\ncooperation, but it also extends the range of parent-offspring conflict and of manipulation\nbetween various care providers. In species with exclusive maternal care, mothers have\nfewer strategies for successful childrearing (Hrdy, 2008, 2009; Russell and Lummaa,\nThe evolutionary framework in which both mothers' and offspring's psychology\nhave developed is well summarized in the formula `mothers matter most' (Campbell, 2002,\np. 34). In all known human societies, biological mothers invest in children the most.\nMothers are crucial for infant survival (Sear and Mace, 2008) and they continue to\ninfluence the reproductive success of their children into adulthood (Kaati, Bygren, and\nEdvinsson, 2002; Phillips et al., 2001), especially through grandmaternal care (Lahdenper\u00e4\nWhile mothers matter most, they are rarely solely responsible for child rearing.\nHuman motherhood is conditional, because due to our cooperative breeding system\nmothers may vary the amount of investment (Hrdy, 2009). Maternal investment would not\nbe adaptive if mothers were not able to vary their investment according to changing\ncircumstances. Not only do mothers decide whether or not to start investing in a newborn,\nthey also make less dramatic decisions about how much and when to invest in a particular\nchild. Environmental resources, offspring viability, the mother's health and age, and\navailable social support affect the mother's investment decisions (Hrdy, 1999). One\nparameter continuously altering the amount of adaptive investment is the child's age. As\nthe child grows older and becomes more independent it is in the mother's interest to start\ndirecting resources towards other means of attaining inclusive fitness (Trivers, 1985, p.\n156). Parent-offspring conflict predicts that the child will often disagree with the mother\nabout how much she should invest elsewhere (Trivers, 1974). Maternal emotions including\nlove, attachment, anger and indifference work as investment regulators in this mother-\nThe evolutionary importance of maternal and grandmaternal care has been proposed\nas the ultimate explanation for several gender differences in behavior and emotions.\nWomen on average, to a greater extent than men, avoid situations that may cause physical\nharm or risk their lives (Campbell, 2002, pp. 90-100). The ability to inhibit aggression and\nrisk behavior is crucial in parenting, which may explain why it has evolved more strongly\nMaternal Guilt\nin women (Bj\u00f6rklund and Kipp, 1996). While men's response to stress is often to either\n\"fight or flight,\" women are more predisposed to \"tend and befriend,\" that is, to seek\ncomfort and conciliation through intimate social relations (Taylor et al., 2000).\nGuilt and parenting\nGuilt is an interpersonal moral emotion that aims to repair or inhibit behavior that\ncauses harm to others. It occurs in relationships in which the other's welfare is of interest to\nthe actor, such as reciprocal relationships and kin relations. The distinction between guilt\nand shame is subtle and the words are used interchangeably in lay talk. Shame is a self-\ndirected emotion in which the subject observes some aspect if his/herself from an external\npoint of view. Guilt focuses on wrongful behavior and is connected to a concern for others\nand how they are affected by one's behavior. Empathy is a prerequisite for feeling guilt\nGuilt may serve to inhibit aggression, impulsive actions and neglect in parenting. If\nso, maternal guilt should be favored by selection to the extent that it reduces aggression and\nrisk of abandonment and promotes adaptive maternal investment and offspring survival.\nThere is evidence that girls and women experience both empathy and guilt to a higher\nhowever, little if any research on guilt in the parenting context. Neither Campbell (2002)\nnor Hrdy (1999) mention guilt in motherhood in their seminal books on women's\nevolutionary psychology. Also other social emotions, such as, pride, anger and shame, have\nbeen little studied in the evolutionary psychology of parenting (Tangney and Fischer,\nOffspring and allomaternal manipulation of mothers\nCooperative breeding and conditional maternal investment have shaped maternal\npsychology. They have probably also shaped the psychological dispositions of those\naffected by maternal care: children, as well as allomaternal care providers.\nConditional motherhood should yield counter strategies in offspring to ensure\nmaternal investment. Yet there is scant research on parent-child interactions in the context\nof parent-offspring conflict and conditional mothering (but see Dickens et al., 2009; Szabo\net al., 2008). Sarah Hrdy suggests that the tendency of infants to \"be adorable,\" gain excess\nweight to signal viability, scream when left alone, and manipulate mothers into care and\ncommitment are such strategies. Children appear to actively monitor their mothers more\nthan their fathers in respect to general behavior (e.g., absences) and sexual behavior (e.g.,\npotential new partners) (Hrdy, 1999, 2009). Also adult children compete with siblings for\ntheir parents' economic and care resources. Trying to make the mother feel guilty may be\none tool in such manipulations.\nBiparental care extends the scope of variations and negotiations in parent-offspring\nconflict (Parker et al., 2002). Humans have facultative fatherhood, meaning that the\ninvestment minimum is markedly lower for fathers than for mothers. Fathers in every\nknown society have provided less childcare than mothers. Human family forms range from\nminimal or no paternal presence in matrilineal households to strong presence and\ndominance of fathers and/or his kin in patrilineal families (Flinn et al., 2008; Geary, 2008;\nTherborn, 2004). In preindustrial societies, fathers and paternal kin have been found to\nMaternal Guilt\nhave no or ambivalent impact on child survival and reproductive success (Gibson, 2008;\nSear and Mace, 2008), but paternal investment improves offspring quality at least in\nIn contemporary Western societies, children live in monogamous nuclear families\nwhere the level of expected parental investment is high. High-quality parenting is a cultural\nnorm that postulates abundant face-to-face interaction and pedagogical activities with the\nchild as well as restrictions on child disciplining. Fathers are expected to invest almost as\nmuch as mothers. When biparental care is emphasized in this way, parents can be predicted\nto try to delegate care to one another. In a recent Dutch study, both mothers and fathers\nwere indeed found to manipulate each other into caring more for the child in everyday\nsocial interactions (Szabo et al., 2008).\nCare negotiations and manipulations can also take place on the cultural level. The\nmotherhood myth is one cultural tool for manipulating mothers into excessive investment.\nThis myth depicts mothers as universally present, nurturing and kind (Douglas and\nMichaels, 2004; Hare-Mustin and Broderick, 1979). Chimpanzees and other non-human\nmothers who provide exclusive maternal care conform to this image, but human mothers\ngenerally do not. The motherhood myth thus denies the conditional nature of maternal\nstrategies and may induce guilt in real mothers who fail to meet its requirements. This myth\nof motherhood may serve the interests of men and other allomaternal-care providers.\nEspecially fathers bear few costs of increased maternal investment while their offspring are\nlikely to gain from it and they themselves are free to pursue other interests. By analogy, it\nis in the interests of mothers to manipulate fathers into more caretaking (e.g., by promoting\ncultural expectations of committed and caring fathers).\nWe have briefly outlined the possible effects of conditional maternal investment on\nmaternal, child and allomaternal psychological dispositions. Guilt and other social\nemotions have been little studied in the context of parenting. Below, we use qualitative\ntextual material to explore this uncharted territory.\nExisting research indicates that women are more prone to feeling guilty than men\nand that this may be related to the evolutionary importance of mothering. Additionally,\nboth children and fathers share an interest in promoting excessive maternal investment. The\nchild does it as part of mother-offspring conflict and the father does it as part of biparental-\ncare negotiations and manipulations. We predict that maternal guilt is a common feeling\nand related to parent-offspring conflict, possibly also to manipulations between mothers\nand other caretakers. Next, we analyze the role guilt plays in mother-child interactions.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe study uses self-solicited texts in which contemporary Finnish mothers with\nunder school-aged children divulged their feelings of guilt. This type of qualitative material\nis helpful for describing how guilt is connected to other maternal emotions and to behavior.\nQualitative research can falsify a hypothesis but not provide conclusive support for it. It\ndescribes \"what\" and \"how\" and provides suggestions for theory building and new\nParticipants\nThe respondents' ages ranged from around 20 to 40 years. The socio-demographic\nMaternal Guilt\ndistribution was wide. There were respondents with high levels of education in executive\npositions but also unemployed mothers and mothers with no further education after\ncomprehensive school. The material does not contain systematic information about social\nand demographic factors, although many women did specify their age, educational level or\nprofession and the number and ages of their children.\nMaterials\nThe research data consists of 63 texts written by Finnish mothers with under school-\naged children. The data was collected in 2007 by placing open invitations in family and\nwomen's magazines. The length of the contributions varied from a couple of sentences to\nthree pages. The primary goal of this research material was to inform interpretations of\n\"forbidden\" maternal feelings in contemporary Finland for a Finnish popularized science\nbook (Oulasmaa and Janhunen, 2008). Women were therefore invited to write freely about\nwhich emotions they themselves experienced as forbidden. The invitation to write further\ninstructed: \"Which emotions make you feel guilty or ashamed? Can you talk to anybody\nabout them? Please describe actual situations...\"\nThe research material is neither large nor representative and we have to rely on the\nrespondents' own descriptions of what they have felt. Self-censorship probably occurred,\nfor instance relating to corporal punishment. The strength of the material lies in the fact that\nit enabled mothers to write with detail about socially stigmatized emotions and behavior.\nSocial context of research\nContemporary Finnish mothers typically live in nuclear-family households with one\nor two adults and one to three children. In 2007, when the material was collected, the\naverage age for becoming a mother was 29 and the fertility rate was 1.83 (Statistics\nFinland, 2009). Finland is among the world's wealthiest nations and has comparatively low\npoverty rates and a low degree of social stratification, due to taxation and redistributive\nsocial policies. A great majority (85%) of women participate in the labor force, usually\nworking full time when they are not on parental leaves. Young men and women grow up\nwith a sense of many options and entitlements, the idea that it is possible to \"have it all,\"\nmeaning both full-time wage work and several children of their own; the mean ideal\nCurrent Finnish family policies give mothers a 6-month-maternity leave starting\nfrom about one month prior to expected date of delivery, and continuing until five months\nafter giving birth. Fathers are entitled to 18 days of paternal leave. Either parent can use an\nadditional five months of parental leave. In the vast majority of cases, the mother continues\nto stay home after the maternal leave. Policies try to encourage fathers to use more parental\nleaves. Thus fathers are entitled to an additional 12 days of paternal leave in case they take\nat least 12 days of the parental leave. Pregnancies and baby and toddler development are\nmonitored by regular visits to the maternity- and child-welfare clinic, which provide free\nhealth care and vaccinations (Kela, 2009).\nFinnish parents have a subjective right to municipal day care until the child goes to\nschool. Additionally, parents may receive home allowance until the child is three years old\nif the child is not enrolled in municipal daycare. Parents also have the right to be on care\nleave from work until the child turns three, and to work part-time until the child turns ten\nMaternal Guilt\nAs a result of these family benefits, the absolute majority of Finnish mothers spend\nthe first year at home with the baby, and about every second mother stays at home until the\nyoungest child turns three. The handicap of these comparatively generous family policies is\nthat mothers become isolated. Husbands continue to work full time and wives are left\nwithout adult company. Even if many parents live in the same area as their own parents,\ngrandparents rarely contribute to childcare on a daily basis. The long, cold and dark Finnish\nwinters and the restrained amount of neighborhood sociability create frequent situations in\nwhich a mother and her young children spend their days \"trapped within four walls.\" The\nlack of allomaternal help is likely to create negative emotions and distress in mothers of\nsmall children.\nCultural ideals promote extensive care by both biological parents. The amount and\nquality of parenting is believed to affect all aspects of child development. Corporal\npunishment of a child has been prohibited in Finnish legislation since 1984; parents have\nbeen sentenced in court for slapping their child. None of the respondents admit having\nresorted to serious physical abuse, although slapping was mentioned.\nObviously, no emotions are officially forbidden in Finland. Nevertheless, maternal\nanger, rage and violence are not typically connected with maternal behaviour. In recent\ndecades, women's magazines and health care professionals have encouraged discussion\nabout the challenges of parenthood, especially post-partum depression. Maternal\naggression, on the other hand, is rarely discussed (in contrast to paternal aggression). As\none respondent put it:\nI am probably not the only one who has almost suffocated in her anger, but never\nhave I heard of any others. Negative emotions are not really discussed, only\ndepression, but never rage and hatred towards the child (N10).\nProcedure\nThe 63 texts were numbered in order of submission (the number is rendered after\neach quotation), coded in Atlas.ti program and analyzed with content analysis. Content\nanalysis is a theory-driven form of qualitative analysis where texts are read systematically\nin order to identify, count and categorize themes, in our case guilt-inducing situations. All\nthemes should fit into a category and the categories should be mutually exclusive (Weber,\n1990). For this article, we revised all entries relating to guilt. We included all direct\nmentions of guilt and a few descriptions, which appeared to allude to guilt although the\nrespondent used other expressions such as \"feel bad\" or \"have a bad conscience.\" We then\nanalyzed the contexts in which guilt was mentioned and classified them into proximate\nreasons.\nResults\nThe emotions reported by the 63 respondents showed large variation. One educated\nmother complained that it is forbidden to feel happy and satisfied with motherhood, while\nanother revealed that she gave her autistic twins to foster care since she felt she was unable\nto feel anything for them. The most frequently mentioned feelings or emotional states were\nfatigue, love, rage, anger, aggression, and guilt (Table 1).\nMaternal Guilt\nTable 1. List of emotions reported in material, most frequent mentions in bolded text.\nEmpathy (3) Sorrow (9) Feeling of inadequacy (6)\nOf the negative emotions, anger, aggression and rage form the most frequently\nmentioned cluster, followed by guilt, shame and depression. We will next analyze the\nreasons mothers give for feeling guilty.\nProximate reasons for guilt\nWe found five proximate reasons for guilt in our material. Four reasons were related\nto situations of mother-offspring conflict. These situations were aggression, `exit' or\nthoughts of ending investment, temporary absences, and preferential treatment of siblings.\nA fifth reason is related to high expectations of good mothering, what we call the\nmotherhood myth (Table 2). As in Table 1, the total number of mentions in Table 2 exceeds\nthe number of texts (N=63) since many texts reported more than one emotion and/or\nsituation.\nMaternal Guilt\nTable 2.

Motherhood myth\nNot corresponding to own ideas of a good\nmother\nNot corresponding to other's ideas of a good\nmother\nBelow, we present these five reasons in detail.\n1. Aggression\nThe most common depictions of guilt (25 mentions) were related to thoughts of\naggression or actual aggression towards the child. The following two quotes describe\nverbal and physical aggression and the feelings of remorse and guilt that follow:\nYesterday was really terrible, in the end I called my daughter evil and bad, like the\nwitch in Sleeping Beauty. One CANNOT say anything worse to a child. She has not\nyet recovered although I have apologized many times (Mother of two children, N52).\nThe one-year-old sometimes wants to be in my arms all evening. My husband is\nhome from work and I finally try to get for instance some housework done. Then I\nget irritated over having to carry the child all the time. A few times I have picked up\nthe baby in my arms and cursed at the same time, my grip has probably also been\ninappropriately tight (not that it hurt, though). After a few minutes I feel shame and\nself-loathing (Mother with 3-year-old and 1-year-old children, N43).\nIn these examples guilt appears reflexively after \"bad\" deeds, leading to excuses and\nreconciliation. In other examples mothers would contain their rage by counting to ten (or\n100...) or by walking away from the difficult situation. The next quote illustrates how a\nmother strove to contain her rage by looking for something to throw safely:\nMaternal Guilt\nThe older begins to say, \"Mummy, I want...\" Guess what! I want something too! I\nwant a moment of peace and quiet! I scream before she can finish her sentence. My\nrage pushes me into action and I look for something I could safely throw into the\nwall. I can't find anything and so I lock myself into the bedroom (Mother of three\nOne mother noted that although she is sure she can control herself, she still feels guilty for\neven thinking of hitting her child. In such cases, guilt has an inhibiting function. Thoughts\nof \"bad\" deeds are followed by guilt, leading to inhibiting actions (e.g., going to another\nroom, hitting something else) and preventing aggression.\nSeveral respondents wrote that they had started to understand how someone could\nhurt a child:\nMy own feelings scare me the most. The rage that possesses me is scary. And the fact\nthat I treat a small child roughly is scary. I have often cried, when I think that I am a\nbad mother, or even the only mother in the world who treats her child like this. The\nfeelings of self-loathing and guilt get huge proportions, when it is your own child. I\nam most afraid of hurting my child mentally and permanently (Mother of 3-year-old\nand 1-year-old children, N57).\nThis mother described how talking to other mothers has been the best support, since her\nhusband did not take her fears seriously and she did not dare to mention her aggressive\nbehavior at the child-welfare clinic.\nAfter aggression, strong feelings of guilt were frequently mentioned in connection\nwith visions of ending maternal investment, here summarized under the label \"exit.\" Self-\ndestructive and suicidal thoughts were reported by five mothers. For example:\nNobody, not even my husband understood how tired I was. Having slept too little I\nthought that I couldn't manage the responsibility of raising a child, being this unfit\nme. I never thought of hurting the child, only myself, so I would get some relief\nThe other way of ending the relation is by abandoning the child. This was seen by most\nmothers as the most forbidden thing \u00ad something that cannot even be imagined. For\ninstance, several mothers mentioned the regret of having children as the worst thought of\nall:\nSometimes when I have been tired and irritated, I have regretted having had children.\nThis may be the biggest and most shameful thought I have felt as a mother (Mother\nwith two children, N27).\n\"I WANT MY LIFE BACK!\" The scream ends up coming out as a sigh. I think of all\nthe things I could do without my children. ... These thoughts make me feel guilty. If\nthese wishes would come true, my children would be dead. The thought makes me\ncry. I want my life back, to be something else than a mother and at the same time I\nMaternal Guilt\nwant to be a mother \u00ad the best of mothers. The equation seems impossible (Mother\nwith a 3-year-old child and 1-year-old twins, N24).\nOn the other hand, several mothers had had thoughts of abandoning children without\nfeeling guilty. One even felt guilty because she did not feel guilty when she wrote she is\nunsuitable to be a mother. It is also interesting to note that the two mothers in our material\nwho had permanently given their children into the care of others did not describe feeling\nguilty. Although guilt may have featured at some stage of the process of ending maternal\ninvestment, it was not among the forbidden feelings they chose to describe now, after the\nincident.\n3. Absence\nThird, feelings of guilt arose from maternal absences, whether imagined or real:\nMy child is soon 4 years old and once in a while I still have \"forbidden feelings,\" like\n\"what if the child went to his granny's this weekend so that mum could be on her\nAfter my divorce I have asked for help from the family clinic, but it is really difficult\nto admit having real problems. That I really don't have the strength to be the mother\nof small children right now and would prefer doing something totally different. That I\noften escape my fears, loneliness, rage and fatigue to the pub and explain to myself,\nthat since the kids are well taken care of by their granny I have the right to have some\nfun. Although I just fool myself, I can't leave my problems behind in the bar, on the\ncontrary sometimes I end up with some new ones. And in any case I have been\nseparated from my children, in vain. Feelings of guilt, shame, being powerless\n(Single mother with two children, N45).\nA few respondents felt guilt over being mentally absent, due to being intensely involved in\nwork or studies, or because of marital problems, as in the following case:\nYou easily snap at your children if things aren't alright with your spouse. This is\nfollowed by enormous guilt, but that's just how it is. Although I try all I can, I can't\nbe sufficiently present for my children, if my mind is occupied by our couple\nThe quote above illustrates the demands of high-quality parenting \u00ad it is not enough to be\nphysically present and provide adequate care, the mother should also be mentally\npreoccupied with her children.\n4. Preferential treatment\nFourth, guilt in parent-offspring conflict arose from the difficulties of being alone\nwith both a small baby and a toddler. This situation is very common, as most Finnish\nmothers have at least two children, and the birth interval is on average two years. Mothers\ntypically described feeling more protective of the baby and getting angry with the older\nchild:\nMaternal Guilt\nWhen my youngest was less than one year old I became outraged in situations where\nmy older would hit my younger and for instance push him down on his back just as\nthe younger had managed to stand up (23-year-old mother of two, N7).\nOn some days, after difficult times, I have found myself thinking that I don't really\nLIKE that child, although I love him/her more that anything. These thoughts and\nfeelings make me more ashamed than anything else, and I could never say them aloud\n(Mother of toddler and baby, N3; gender of older child not clear since Finnish\nlanguage does not express gender in pronouns).\nIn one case, preferential treatment was related to the fact that the children had different\nfathers:\nI am not able to love my children equally. Partly I think this is influenced by the\nrelationship between us parents. The first child is the child of my ex-husband, whom\nI hate. The second child on the other hand unites me and my present spouse, the love\nof my life (Mother with two young children, N36).\nAlso preferences for the older child were mentioned a few times. For instance, one mother\ndid not feel she had become properly attached to the baby and gave it too little attention.\n5. Guilt from the motherhood myth\nFinally, many mothers depicted guilt that was not linked to conflict situations but\nrelated to cultural expectations. More than every fifth mother referred to what we have\ndefined as the motherhood myth. They had confronted expectations of being a good\nmother, whether their own or others'. The mothers felt they could not correspond to these\nhigh standards, such as loving unconditionally, never being angry or being constantly\nattentive:\nI felt guilty for having negative feelings toward my child, and I was not the good\nmother I had set out to be (Mother who had her first child at 23 after an unplanned\nI felt guilty about everything. If the baby was satisfied lying on the play rug, I\ndebated in my conscience whether it was suffering there alone etc. ... I wish\nsomebody would have told me that the baby doesn't suffer even if I don't attend to it\nALL the time (Mother of two children, in her early 30s, suffered post-partum\nThe latter mother quoted above explicitly criticizes prevailing cultural notions of\nmothering, leading her to believe that the baby would suffer if she did not provide it with\nexclusive attention.\nMaternal guilt was often connected to strong expected or actual social disapproval. A\nmother should not be disappointed with motherhood or, even worse, the child. As the\nfollowing mothers complained:\nMaternal Guilt\nI feel guilt and shame because I yell at my children and most of all because I haven't\nformed a proper emotional bond with my youngest ... One can't talk about these\nissues with one's own face and emotions. If you mention that you find your child\nirritating, you are seen as mentally ill or plain crazy, you are a bad mother who should\nnever have had children since you can't take care of them or love them (29-year-old\nmother with 7-year-old, 5-year-old, and 9-month-old children, N60).\nI really thought that I would die, because I had slept so little. ... I felt boundless\ndesperation, shame, loneliness and disappointment at myself. I can't get my child to\nsleep, I'm a bad mother. I also felt guilty for having these feelings. I was supposed to\nbecome such a good and happy mother ... I never discussed these issues at the child-\nwelfare clinic, I always said everything was fine. The clinic nurse was certainly the\nkind of person I could have talked to, but I could not reveal such things there, or say\nthem aloud. At first my fatigue was not to be mentioned at home either or I became\nangry (27-year-old mother with higher education, a housewife and student with a 2-\nyear-old child, N4).\nContrary to our predictions, mothers did not describe fathers or nurses encouraging them to\ndo even more childcare. However, many mothers felt that their feelings of doubt, guilt and\ndisappointment were ignored or underestimated by their partners or the nurses. They were\nalso afraid of being stigmatized or condemned by them.\nSummary of results\nWe asked Finnish women to describe the emotions they perceived as \"forbidden.\"\nThe most frequently mentioned feelings in 63 texts were fatigue and love, followed by two\nclusters of negative emotions: rage, anger, aggression, and guilt, shame, and depression. As\nwe predicted, guilt was among the most frequently mentioned feelings. Content analysis\nindicated that guilt arose in concrete situations of mother-offspring conflict, where it served\nto temper and moderate maternal feelings of anger, thoughts of leaving temporarily or for\ngood and preferential treatment of siblings. In other words, guilt emerges reflexively after\ninvestment reducing thoughts and behavior. It appears to function as a crucial inhibitory\nmechanism in relation to aggression and abandonment. Guilt also arose in relation to high\nexpectations of good motherhood. Both the mothers themselves and important others\ncontributed to these high expectations and made it difficult to talk about failures to live up\nto them.\nDiscussion\nConditional motherhood means that emotionally, human mothers are equipped both\nfor providing for the offspring and for denying care and delegating it to others. Positive\nemotions such as love and attachment evidently channel investment. Bursts of anger and\nindifference, on the other hand, signal that it is time to direct resources elsewhere. Finally,\ninvestment may also be increased by \"negative\" emotions such as guilt and shame, which\ninhibit or moderate anger and indifference.\nSocial emotions involved in parenting have been little studied from an evolutionary\nperspective. Our results suggest that commitment to a particular child can be promoted by\nMaternal Guilt\nfeelings of guilt when that child is neglected, mistreated, or less favored than a sibling.\nMental or physical aggression towards the child was the most frequently mentioned\nsource of guilt in our material. In Western contemporary societies, mothers are generally\nthought of as not hostile or angry, even though mothers have in fact been found to be\nangrier than fathers in the family environment (Ross and Willigen, 1996). Guilt following\naggression is enhanced in a society where slapping a child is prohibited by law, not to\nmention more serious child abuse. Cultural expectations due to the motherhood myth were\nthe second most frequent source of guilt.\nOther often mentioned guilt-inducing categories were thoughts or plans of\nabandoning the child, and feelings of not living up to the high expectations of the\nmotherhood myth. By contrast, temporary maternal absences and preferential treatment of\nchildren received fewer mentions even if such behavior is fairly common. We can presume\nthat many mothers are often away from their child or care more for the younger and needier\nchild (McHale et al., 1995), without feeling especially guilty about it.\nThe unrealistically high demands of being a good mother among Finnish mothers\nmay be due to the fact that few adults have hands-on experience of raising children prior to\nbecoming parents themselves, and from the social isolation of many mothers with small\nchildren. Current parenting ideals stress high-quality parenting and time spent in face-to-\nface play and pedagogic activities. These factors contribute to the difference between\nexpectations and actual motherhood our respondents so often described in our material.\nHowever, they do not explain the guilt associated with not meeting these expectations.\nTeenagers do not have hands-on experience of couple relationships before their first\ngirlfriends and boyfriends, nor does the first relationship typically match cultural ideals, yet\nteenagers do not necessarily feel guilty about unfulfilled expectations.\nAn interesting question is therefore how much maternal guilt is subject to cultural\nvariation. Proximate reasons for guilt probably vary significantly with cultural and social\ncircumstances. Not all mothers will agree that \"being a mother is all about guilt,\" as one\nrespondent claimed. For instance, journalist Lakshmi Chaudhry (2006, p. 93) describes US\nmothers as wrestling with anxiety and guilt, while Indian mothers who can rely on\nextended help feel more confident and relaxed about mothering. In cultures where physical\npunishment of children is not forbidden or stigmatizing, mothers might also not feel guilty\nof mere thoughts of hitting their child, as they did in the Finnish material.\nHowever, cultural variation should have its limits. Take, for instance, the case of\nphysical abuse. Although it can sometimes be adaptive for a mother to reduce or terminate\ninvestment, it is against the principle of kin selection for a mother to injure her closest kin.\nEven verbal punishment can induce stress and possible illness in children (Flinn, 2005, p.\n74), and it is of course not in the child's interest to be the object of aggression. Therefore\nguilt as a \"child's advocate\" in maternal psychology may protect both the mother and the\nchild against impulsive maternal aggression.\nWe have referred to idealization of high-investing mothers as the motherhood myth.\nThe motherhood myth is not a \"myth\" in the sense of a set of false assumptions. Rather, it\nis a biased view that emphasizes maternal devotion but denies the existence of different\nmaternal strategies, conditional maternal investment, and cooperative breeding\narrangements. It presents an idealized view of mothers as exclusive caretakers who are\nuniversally present, nurturing and kind \u00ad not absent, selfish or aggressive. This view has\nprevailed and dominated Western science and popular psychology of motherhood for over\nMaternal Guilt\na century (Hrdy, 1999). The motherhood myth also supports the interests of some\nindividuals more than others. Thus the tendency to idealize mothers can be predicted to\nvary with age and stage of life course. It can be expected to be weakest among mothers\nwith small children, and stronger the more dependent one is on maternal care and also\namong fathers, not only because they never become mothers but as part of sexual conflict\nin biparental care.\nFeminist scholars have conducted empirical studies on the motherhood myth. Hare-\nMustin and Broderick (1979) measured attitudes towards women's reproductive choices,\nlife goals, and ideal maternal behavior. Men and older people were expected to be more\ntraditional and patriarchal and to accept the motherhood myth. Results showed, however,\nthat not only men but also younger subjects were much more accepting of the motherhood\nmyth than the older age group (p. 120). These results provide tentative support for our\ntheoretical suggestion that the motherhood myth may be involved in both sexual conflict\nand parent-offspring conflict.\nWe believe that while cultural variation in the amount and proximate reasons for\nmaternal guilt is to be expected, there will also be some universal ingredients promoting the\nmotherhood myth and making mothers on average feel guilty more easily than fathers.\nLimitations of the Study\nOur data is relatively small and not representative of the Finnish population. Neither\ncan it highlight the cultural and social variation probably affecting maternal guilt in\ndifferent countries and social classes. The content analysis cannot provide detailed\nevidence of the psychological mechanisms involved and does not go beyond respondents'\nown descriptions of their experiences. Results are preliminary and further research into the\nspecific mechanisms and cultural variation of guilt and other social emotions related to\nhuman parenting is needed.\nConclusion\nGuilt plays an important role in the maternal-investment-regulating system. It\npromotes maternal investment in situations of mother-offspring conflict. Together with\nother social emotions, maternal guilt serves to inhibit or mitigate aggression, desertion and\npreferential treatment of children. Guilt is also involved in maternal and allomaternal\ncultural regulations of maternal investment. Maternal guilt is predicted to vary with social\nand cultural context but also to show universal characteristics due to mother-offspring\nconflict and allomaternal manipulation.\n"
