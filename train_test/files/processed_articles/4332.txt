Though childbearing outside mari-\ntal unions is prevalent worldwide, the greatest proportions of\nchildbearing occur within marital unions (Acharya, 2010).\nThe recognition of this fact has often been the basis for\ndevising initiatives to encourage rise in age at first marriage\nas one of the means of redressing high fertility in many\ndeveloping countries (World Health Organization [WHO],\n2011). Evidence abounds that populations with higher age at\nfirst marriage have on the average low fertility level\nsible by higher ability to exercise more control over repro-\nductive decisions including decisions about childbearing,\nimproved educational attainment, and enhanced economic\ncapacities of populations that delay first marriage (Population\nFollowing the rise to prominence of gender equality and\nwomen's empowerment in global population and health dis-\ncourses after the 1994 Cairo International Conference on\nPopulation and Development, initiatives to raise age at first\nmarriage has been linked with agitations for improvement in\nwomen's empowerment (UNICEF, 2005). Women's empow-\nerment refers to the process of providing women with greater\naccess to vital resources such as education, employment, and\nhealth care for the purpose of increasing their ability to con-\ntrol their own affairs and to reduce women's domination by\nmen. It is widely believed that by delaying marriage, several\nhundreds of thousands of young girls will acquire improved\neducation which will make them to understand and demand\nfor basic human rights and participation in the workforce\n(USAID, 2012), thus likely to cause change in their fertility\ndesire and ultimately their fertility behavior. There is there-\nfore a nexus among age at first marriage, fertility behavior,\nand women's empowerment. However, in spite of several\nstudies focusing on women's empowerment and fertility-\nrelated issues (Acharya, 2010; Raj, Saggurti, Balaiah, &\nWado, 2013) insufficient attempts have been made to simul-\ntaneously explore the relationship between age at first mar-\nriage and fertility behavior on the one hand and women's\nempowerment on the other hand. This study tries to fill this\ngap by exploring whether age at first marriage is related to\nfertility behavior and women's empowerment. It is important\n1Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nBola Lukman SOLANKE, Department of Demography and Social\nStatistics, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, 220005, Nigeria.\nEmail: modebolasolanke@gmail.com\nMarriage Age, Fertility Behavior, and\nWomen's Empowerment in Nigeria\nBola Lukman SOLANKE1\n Keywords\nhealth care, pregnancy termination, mass media, wealth index, age at marriage\n2 SAGE Open\nto examine the inter relatedness of age at first marriage, fer-\ntility behavior, and women's empowerment in Nigeria\nbecause in spite of being the most populous country in\nAfrica, implementation of population and gender policies\n(such as the 2004 National Population Policy for Sustainable\nDevelopment and 2006 National Gender Policy) are yet to\nachieve significant fertility reduction and improvement in\nwomen's empowerment in the country. The specific objec-\ntives of the study are to describe the patterns of age at first\nmarriage, fertility behavior, and women empowerment by\nthe geo-political zones in Nigeria; and examine the relation-\nship between age at first marriage and fertility behavior. In\naddition, the study examines the relationship between age at\nfirst marriage and women's empowerment in Nigeria.\nTheoretical Framework\nLiberal feminist theory provides the theoretical underpin-\nning of the current study. Liberal feminism aims at improv-\ning all round gender equality and empowerment by\nencouraging women's access to public institutions and\nbringing women's issues to the fore of national discourse\n(Walter, 1998). These are to be achieved through educa-\ntional reforms and enactment of appropriate legislations not\nonly to bridge the state of inequality between men and\nwomen, but to also change community norms and beliefs\nabout early marriage as already been achieved in countries\nsuch as Cambodia, Nepal, and Rwanda (Head etal., 2014).\nIn Nigeria, women and girls have unequal economic, social,\nand political opportunities with men in the country (British\nCouncil, 2012). This is made possible and sustained by\nNigeria's socio-cultural system that not only promotes\nwomen's subordinate position, but also sustains inequality\nin decision-making positions in government (Omoluabi,\nAina, & Attanasso, 2014). In addition, several harmful prac-\ntices including gender-based violence, female genital cut-\nting, early and forced marriages, widow inheritance, and so\non, are common in the country (National Population\nCommission [NPC], 2004). However, in the last two\ndecades, national attention to the plight of women has\nsteadily increased in the country. Numerous gender activ-\nists, civil society groups, and women-centered organizations\nhave not only stepped up advocacy for women's rights, they\nhave also established a National Coalition on Affirmative\nAction (NCAA) to champion agitation for the domestication\nof United Nation's Convention on the Elimination of all\nForms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). The\ngovernment of Nigeria has positively responded to the agi-\ntations by adhering to the Beijing Platform of Action that\ndemands that women fill at least 35% of all political posts\n(NPC and ICF Macro, 2009). Though, achieving this target\nfor elective positions in the country seems to be unattainable\nin the present dispensation, the social position of women in\nthe country is likely to improve steadily with sustained edu-\ncation for young girls and women.\nMethod\nData Sources\nThe data for this study were extracted from the 2013\nNigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). The\n2013 NDHS is the fifth Demographic and Health Survey\nimplemented in the country. It is a nationally representa-\ntive survey that provides valid information on basic demo-\ngraphic and health indices such as fertility, marriage,\nfamily planning, adult and childhood mortality, domestic\nviolence, and HIV/AIDS (NPC and ICF International,\n2014). The data were accessed online through the website\nof MEASURE DHS following the submission of abstract\ngiving details of the study objective. We analyzed the\nwomen data set focusing on a weighted sample size of\nmarried (9,820 women), women who have never had a live\nbirth (9,474 women), and women who were widowed,\nVariable Description and Measures\nThe outcome variables in the study are fertility behavior and\nwomen's empowerment. Fertility behavior was measured by\nchildren ever born, current contraceptive use, pregnancy ter-\nmination, and desire for more children. However, only chil-\ndren ever born were used to proxy fertility behavior at the\nbivariate and multivariate levels of statistical analyses. This\nwas done because children ever born has been widely used as\na measure of fertility behavior (Acharya, 2010; Sathar &\nKiani, 1998). Women's empowerment was measured in the\nstudy using level of women's autonomy and education.\nWomen's autonomy was derived from responses to questions\non control of household decisions, namely who has the final\nsay on own health care, purchase of large items, and visit to\nfriends and relatives? Responses to these questions were\ncoded in the NDHS as follows: respondents alone, respon-\ndents and husband, husband alone, someone else, and others.\nDummy variables for each of these response domains were\ncreated by categorizing the responses into three, namely low,\nmoderate, and high autonomy. The three categories used in\nthe study differs from the two categories usually found in\nDHS studies (Kishor & Subaiya, 2008; Upadhyay & Karasek,\nwomen in Nigeria (Chizomam & Isiugo-Abanihe, 2014).\nFor each domain, the variable is coded 1 if respondents\nhave no say in the decision, 2 if respondent jointly take deci-\nsion with husband/partner, and 3 if respondent take decision\nalone. Women's educational attainment was equally catego-\nrized into three groups, namely, low, moderate, and high.\nRespondents who attained none and primary education were\ncategorized as having \"low education,\" those who attained\nsecondary education as having \"moderate education,\" and\nthose who attained higher education as having \"high educa-\ntion.\" A composite indicator of women empowerment was\nthen generated by combining level of autonomy and educa-\ntion. This indicator was categorized into low, moderate, and\nhigh empowerment: women who report low autonomy and\nlow education indicating low empowerment, women who\nreport moderate autonomy and education indicating moder-\nate empowerment, and high autonomy and education indicat-\ning high empowerment.\nThe key explanatory variable is age at first marriage\ngrouped into four age intervals of 14 years or less, 15 to 19\nyears, 20 to 24 years, and 25 years and above. Other explana-\ntory variables include selected socio-economic characteris-\ntics (wealth quintile, place of residence, employment status,\nreligious affiliation and region). The relationships between\nthe explanatory and outcome variables were mediated by\nbarriers to health care and access to mass media. Health care\nis an important resource for empowerment with women\nexperiencing barriers to timely and appropriate health care\nhaving less likelihood of empowerment (Head etal., 2014).\nBarriers to health care were generated by combining wom-\nen's responses on whether money, distance, and husband per-\nmission constitute hindrance to health care. Access to mass\nmedia was generated using the frequency of reading newspa-\nper, listening to radio, and watching television. Women who\ndid not read newspapers, listened to radio, or watch televi-\nsion indicated women with \"no\" access to mass media.\nWomen who read newspaper, listen to radio, or watch televi-\nsion less than once a week indicated women with \"low\"\naccess to mass media, whereas those whose frequency of\nreading newspaper, listening to radio, or watching television\nwas at least once a week indicated women with \"moderate\"\naccess to mass media.\nData Analysis\nStata version 12 was used to perform statistical analyses\nwhich commenced after applying standardized sample\nweights (StatCorp, 2009). Frequency table was used to\ndescribe sample characteristics, patterns of marriage age,\nfertility behavior, and women's empowerment across the\ngeo-political zones of the country. Two multivariate tech-\nniques were used to examine the relationship between the\nresearch variables. The justification for this relates to the dif-\nferent nature of the outcome variables. The Poisson regres-\nsion was performed to examine the relationship between age\nat first marriage and children ever born. The Poisson regres-\nsion is particularly suitable for regressing dependent variable\non independent variables when the dependent variable is a\nnon negative count variable (StatCorp, 2009) such as chil-\ndren ever born used to proxy fertility behavior in the current\nstudy. Results of the Poisson regression are presented in the\nstudy as the incident rate ratios (irr) which estimate the inci-\ndence of children ever born in a given category relative to the\nreference category. The Poisson regression was replicated in\nthree models. Model 1 included only age at first marriage.\nModel 2 controls for the socio-economic factors whereas\nModel 3 controls for the mediating factors. Models 2 and 3\nwere constructed to determine whether inclusion of other\nvariables in the model will alter the relationship between age\nat first marriage and children ever born.\nThe multinomial logistic regression was performed to\nexamine the relationship between age at first marriage and\nempowerment. The multinomial logistic regression is not\nonly appropriate for analysis in the current study because it is\nmainly applicable to the analysis of discrete dependent vari-\nables when the dependent variable has more than two nomi-\nit is also increasingly being used in the analysis of social\nstudy, the multinomial logistic regression was replicated in\nthree models with moderate empowerment as base outcome.\nModel 1 included only age at first marriage, Model 2 con-\ntrols for the mediating factors, whereas Model 3 controls for\nthe socio-economic factors. The relative risk ratios (rrr) are\nused in the study to report the estimated coefficients of the\nmultinomial model. This measures the risk of low or high\nempowerment relative to moderate empowerment.\nResults\nThis section presented results that were generated from the\nstudy. Table 1 presents description of sample characteristics.\nMore than one fifth of the women were either in the \"poor-\nest\" or \"poorer\" ladder of the wealth groups. The distribu-\ntions of women in other wealth categories were nearly equal.\nFor instance, the same proportions of women were in the\n\"richer\" and \"richest\" categories. The highest proportions of\nthe women reside in rural areas while slightly more than one\nthird of the women reside in urban areas. More than two\nthirds of the women were currently employed, whereas less\nthan one third of them were unemployed. Muslim women\nwere dominant among the respondents. More than one third\nof the respondents were Christians, whereas an insignificant\nproportion was adherents of traditional or other faiths. The\nhighest proportion of the women did not report any barrier to\nhealth care. However, slightly less than one tenth of the\nwomen had at least one barrier to accessing health care.\nAbout one third of the women had no access to mass media;\nslightly more than one fifth had low access to mass media,\nwhereas nearly half of the women had moderate access to\nmass media. Women in the north-west zone of the country\nwere dominant in the sample. The three zones in the northern\nregion constitute more than two thirds of the sample com-\npared with less than one third in the three southern zones of\nthe country.\nTable 2 presents result of patterns of marriage age, fertil-\nity behavior, and women's empowerment across the geo-\npolitical zones in the country. Slightly more than a quarter of\nthe women married at age 14 years or less with highest pro-\nportion of early marriages occurring in the north-western\nzone of the country. However, the dominant age interval at\n4 SAGE Open\nfirst marriage across the country is 15 to 19 years. The pro-\nportions of first marriages occurring at 25 years or above\nwere higher in the southern region and lowest in the northern\nregion. The mean number of children ever born was highest\nin the north-western zone compared with other zones in the\ncountry.\nAs indicated in Table 2, contraceptive use among married\nwomen is poor in Nigeria. Only 15.7% of the respondents\nwere currently using at least one method of modern contra-\nception; however, use of modern contraceptives were much\nbetter in the three southern zones compared with its preva-\nlence in northern zone. Pregnancy termination experiences\nwere more prevalent in southern region particularly in the\nsouth-eastern and south-western zones, which incidentally\nare the two zones with higher contraceptive prevalence.\nDesire for more children were higher in north-eastern and\nnorth-western zones compared with other zones in the coun-\ntry. Result of levels of empowerment provide evidence of\nlow level of women's empowerment particularly in northern\nparts of the country. The highest level of empowerment was\nfound in south-western zone compared with the lowest level\nof empowerment in the north-western zone.\nTable 3 presents result of Poisson regression. In the three\nmodels constructed, age at first marriage is significantly\nrelated to children ever born. In Model 1, the incident rate of\nchildren ever born for women aged 15 to 19 years at first\nmarriage is less than the incident rate of children ever born\nLikewise, the incident rate of children ever born for women\naged 20 to 24 years is less than the incident rate of children\never born for the reference group holding the other variables\nfactors were included in Model 2, age at first marriage\nremains significantly related to children ever born. The inci-\ndent rate of children ever born reduces consistently as age at\nfirst marriage increases from the reference category to\nhigher ages given the other variables are held constant in the\nmodel. In the model, the incident rate of children ever born\nreduces consistently as household wealth index improves\nfrom the reference category to other wealth groups. For\ninstance, the incident rate of children ever born among\nwomen in the middle wealth group is less than the incident\nrate of children ever born among women in the reference\nof children ever born among unemployed women increases\ncompared with the incident rate of children ever born among\nvariables constant.\nWhen the mediating factors were included in Model 3\nwhile controlling for the socio-economic factors, age at\nfirst marriage remain associated with children ever born.\nIn the model, the incident rates of children ever born were\nless for women with higher age at first marriage compared\nwith the reference category. Also, the incident rate of chil-\ndren ever born reduces for women with low and moderate\naccess to mass media compared with the incident rate of\nchildren ever born among women with no access to mass\nmedia.\nTable 4 presents result of the multinomial logistic regres-\nsion. In the three models constructed, age at first marriage\nshows significant relationship with empowerment. In Model\n1, the relative risk of being in high empowerment category\ninstead of moderate category will increase by a factor of\npared with those aged 14 years or less. When age at first mar-\nriage increased to 20 to 24 years, the relative risk of being in\nhigh empowerment category instead of moderate category\nwill increase by a factor of 6.5759. Likewise, the relative risk\nof being in high empowerment category instead of moderate\ncategory will increase by a factor of 17.5017 for those aged\n25 years and above compared with those aged 14 years or\nless. The inclusion of socio-economic characteristics of\nrespondents in Model 2 did not change the nature of the rela-\ntionship between age at first marriage and empowerment.\nTable 1.

When age at first\nmarriage increased to 25 years and above, the relative risk of\nbeing in high empowerment category instead of moderate\ncategory will increase by a factor of 3.4416. All the selected\nsocio-economic characteristics were associated with empow-\nerment. For instance, while the relative risk of being in high\nempowerment category instead of moderate empowerment\nwill increase by a factor of 1.6553 for urban women com-\npared with rural women, the relative risk of being in high\nempowerment category instead of moderate empowerment\nwill reduce by a factor of 0.9841 for unemployed women\ncompared with employed women.\nIn Model 3, barriers to health care are the only variable\nnot significantly related to empowerment. In the model, the\nrelative risk of being in high empowerment category instead\nof moderate category will increase by a factor of 1.8037 for\nthose aged 15 to 19 years at first marriage compared with\nthose aged 14 years or less. When age at first marriage\nincreased to 25 years and above, the relative risk of being in\nhigh empowerment category instead of moderate category\nwill increase by a factor of 11.5911.

In virtually all the three\nmodels constructed for low empowerment, the relationship\nbetween age at first marriage and empowerment was not sta-\ntistically significant.\nDiscussion\nThis study explored the relationship between age at first mar-\nriage and fertility behavior on the one hand and between age\nat first marriage and women's empowerment on the other\nhand. Four major findings emerged from our analyses. First,\nearly marriage is dominant in northern Nigeria. This is con-\nsistent with the finding by Kyari and Ayodele (2014). Early\nmarriage violates the rights of young girls to education and\neconomic opportunities, but undermines their ability to\nadvance socially and politically (USAID, 2012). The prac-\ntice of early marriage thrives in the region for two basic rea-\nsons such as an accepted cultural practice in the region and\nparents and guardians of young girls derive economic gains\nfrom marrying young girls by receiving dowry payment or\nrelief from paying school fees on the girl child (UNICEF,\n2005). Both concerns must be fully addressed by social pro-\ngrams to change attitudes in the region. Governments in the\nregion can develop programs that not only enforce universal\nbasic education, but also provide economic incentives to par-\nents and guardians who enrolled their female children in\neither primary or secondary school.\nSecond, there were differentials in fertility behavior\namong southern and northern women. On the one hand,\nwomen in north-eastern and north-western zones of the\ncountry had higher fertility compared with their southern\ncounterparts. This results tends to support previous higher\nTable 3.

On the other hand, women\nin southern Nigeria had higher prevalence of modern contra-\nceptive use than women in northern zone. It is however wor-\nthy to note that in spite of higher prevalence of contraceptive\nuse in southern Nigeria, higher proportions of women in the\nregion have experienced pregnancy termination compared\nwith their northern counterparts. This is worrisome because\ndespite sustained advocacy for reform of the abortion law in\nNigeria, pregnancy termination remained highly restricted\nunder the Nigerian legal system (Oye-Adeniran, Long, &\nAdewole, 2004). Two reasons may account for the finding on\npregnancy termination among the sampled women. On the\none hand, it is plausible to reason that women in northern\nNigeria are more interested in childbearing than southern\nwomen. This is shown in the result of desire for more chil-\ndren among the respondents. On the other hand, it is not cer-\ntain whether women in southern Nigeria do not take\npregnancy termination as a means of fertility control. Both\npossibilities suggest urgent need to scale up not only access\nto modern contraceptives in the country, but also devising\nmore initiatives to boost its use among women in marital\nunions.\nThird, significant relationship exists between age at first\nmarriage and fertility behavior. Younger age at first marriage\nconnotes early exposure to regular sexual intercourse which\nwill ultimately translate into early childbearing in the absence\nof effective contraceptive (WHO, 2011). In consonance with\nstart childbearing early have on the long run more number of\nTable 4.

Fourth,\nsignificant relationship exists between age at first marriage\nand women's empowerment with younger age at first mar-\nriage being associated with low level of empowerment. It is\nplausible to assume that women who delay marriage till\nolder ages will have higher empowerment because in most\ncases most of the women delaying marriage were mostly\nattending educational institutions or actively engaged in the\nlabor force. These findings indicate that significant change in\nfertility behavior as well as women's empowerment can be\nachieved if age at first marriage is delayed.\nIn Nigeria, raising age at first marriage to at least 18 years\nfor females was recognized in the 2004 National Population\nPolicy as a strategy to improving the empowerment and\nreproductive health of girls and women; however, the strat-\negy has not received meticulous commitment from the\nnational legislatures due to cultural diversity in the country.\nOpposition to enactment of a minimum age at first marriage\nhas remained stiff in northern Nigeria where early and some-\ntimes forced marriages are more prevalent.As found in Kyari\nand Ayodele (2014), the prevalence of early marriage in\nnorthern Nigeria has serious socio-economic implications.\nEarly marriage in the region denied many girls the opportu-\nnities of acquiring basic education and developing their tal-\nents. This is compounded by subsequent high fertility that\nfurther hinders their economic productivity and empower-\nment. It is therefore important that a nationwide program\nproviding empirical evidence of the age at first marriage, fer-\ntility, and empowerment nexus should be designed and\nimplemented in the country. This will go a long way in mobi-\nlizing for the enactment and enforcement of legislation to\neliminate early marriage in the country.\nWith increasing women's education and advocacy by\nwomen's groups and in line with the assertion of Liberal\nfeminists, a number of positive steps have been taken in the\ncountry to bridge gender gap and empower women in the\ncountry. One of such steps is the design and implementation\nof the 2006 National Gender Policy. The policy seeks to\nbuild a just society through promoting the realization of the\nfull potentials of both men and women in the country (FMWA\n& SD, 2006). The policy has now been implemented for\nnearly a decade, but still far away from achieving set objec-\ntives. Though the policy sought to mainstream the principles\nof CEDAW into the country's legal and administrative sys-\ntems, no programs have been designed to build the capacity\nof legislatures to uphold a minimum age at marriage across\nthe country.\nConclusion\nThis study concluded that age at first marriage has signifi-\ncant relationship with women's fertility behavior and\nempowerment. The enactment and enforcement of legisla-\ntion to eliminate early marriage will impact positively on\nfertility reduction and women's empowerment in the coun-\ntry. Inference made in this study is limited by inability to\nestablish a cause\u00adeffect relationship between age at first\nmarriage and the outcome variables.\n"
