It exerts its biological activity mainly by\nactivating soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)\nto synthesize the second messenger cyclic\nguanosine monophosphate (cGMP),3 which\npromotes vasodilation and inhibits smooth\nmuscle cell growth and proliferation, neur-\nonal transmission, host defences, leukocyte\nrecruitment, platelet aggregation and vascu-\nlar remodelling through a number of down-\nstream targets.4\nImpairment of the NO-sGC-cGMP path-\nway, associated with dysregulation of NO\nproduction, sGC activity and cGMP deg-\nradation, has been shown to contribute to\nthe progression of PH.5 A number of sGC\nstimulators and activators that can bind to\nthe b subunit of sGC and stimulate it in a\ndirect or indirect way have been identified,\nbenzyl indazole (YC-1), 3-(4-amino-5-cyclo-\npropylpyrimidin-2-yl)-1-(2-fluorobenzyl)-\n2-[1-[(2-fluorophenyl)methyl]-1H-pyrazolo\npotent pulmonary vasodilators, decreasing\nthe mean pulmonary arterial pressure and\nvascular resistance, and have been shown to\nreverse structural lung vascular remodelling\nand right heart hypertrophy in PH.8\nRiociguat is the first sGC stimulator to\nundergo clinical study. In clinical trials\nit significantly improved the pulmonary\nvascular haemodynamics in pulmonary\narterial hypertension and chronic thrombo-\nembolic PH with no serious adverse events.9\nIn contrast, a specific inhibitor of sGC,\nhas been shown to block the rise in cGMP\nand the antiproliferative action of the\nNO-sGC-cGMP pathway.10\nTo date, studies suggest that once cGMP\nis produced, its effects could be executed\nthough three main groups of cellular target\nmolecules: cGMP-dependent protein kin-\nases (PKGs), cGMP-gated cation channels\nand phosphodiesterases (PDEs).11 The PDE\ninhibitor sildenafil is used to treat idiopathic\ngroups of molecules, little is known about\nthe downstream target genes of the\nNO-sGC-cGMP pathway and the signalling\nevents regulating gene expression. Using\ngenome-wide technologies that can measure\nthe expression of thousands of genes simul-\ntaneously, differences in gene expression in\nresponse to particular treatments can be\nmeasured. In the present study, digital gene\nexpression tag profiling was used to measure\ndifferences in gene expression in human\npulmonary artery smooth muscle cells\ntreated with two sGC agonists14 and a\ncGMP analogue.15 Gene ontology analysis\nof the differential gene expression was then\nused to reveal the candidate genes involved\nin the activation of NO-sGC-cGMP\npathway.\nMaterials and methods\nDigital gene expression tag profiling\nHuman pulmonary artery smooth muscle\ncells isolated from patients with PH were\ngenerously provided by Dr Jun Wang from\nCapital Medical University, Beijing, China.\nThey were cultured in smooth muscle cell\nmedium (ScienCell Research Laboratories,\nCarlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 2%\nfetal bovine serum and 1% smooth muscle\ncell growth supplement (ScienCell Research\nLaboratories) and maintained at 37C in a\nhumidified atmosphere of 5% carbon diox-\nNO-independent but haem-dependent sGC\nhaem-independent sGC activator) for digital\ngene expression tag profiling were gener-\nously provided by Professor Johannes-Peter\nStasch from Bayer Schering Pharma AG,\nCardiology Research, Pharma Research\nCentre, Germany. These were dissolved in\ndimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) at a concen-\nuntil used.\nSmooth muscle cells (1 \u00c2 106) were trea-\n(8-Br-cGMP; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO,\nUSA) for 8 h. Controls were treated with\nDMSO (2 ml or 0.2 ml as controls for BAY\n2 ml double-distilled H2\nO (controls for 8-\nBr-cGMP) for the same time periods. The\ncells (2 \u00c2 106) were then harvested at the\nindicated time points.\nTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol\nreagent according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,\nUSA). Magnetic oligo-beads were used to\nisolate the mRNA from 6 mg of total RNA.\nFirst- and second-strand cDNA was synthe-\nsized using oligo(dT) primers, purified using\na Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen,\nHilden, Germany) according to the manu-\nfacturer's instructions, and digested with\nDNase I in order to produce a substantial\nenrichment of fragments about 200 bp in\nlength. The samples (20 ml) were then loaded\nonto 1.2% agarose gel (Invitrogen) and\nextracted using a Qiaquick Gel Extraction\nKit (Qiagen) according to the manufac-\nturer's instructions. The 50 and 30 ends of\nthe fragments were end-repaired. The sam-\nples were purified and ligated to genomic\nadapters (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA)\nand then loaded onto 2% agarose gel and\nseparated by electrophoresis (120 V for\nand 300 bp were isolated from the gel and\npurified using the Qiaquick Gel Extraction\nKit. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of\nthe gel-purified cDNA (total volume 50 ml)\nwas performed using DNA polymerase and\nprimers provided by Illumina according to\nthe manufacturer's instructions. After 15\ncycles of PCR amplification, the sample\nwere loaded onto 1.2% agarose gels and\npurified from the gel again. The samples\nwere then quantified spectrophotomet-\nrically using a NanoDrop spectrophotom-\neter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,\nMA, USA) and sequenced using a HiSeqTM\nDetermination of differentially\nexpressed genes\nTo compare the differential expression of\ngenes across samples, the raw data was\ncollected and filtered to remove low quality\ntags, adaptor tags and tags with a single\ncopy number. The gene expression levels\nwere determined by the number of raw clean\ntags in each library normalized to the tran-\nscripts per million clean tags. A significant\ndifference was defined as a P-value < 0.05, a\nfor the sequence counts across the libraries.\nUpregulated genes were defined as >2.0 \u00c2\nexpression in controls, and downregulated\ngenes were defined as <0.5 \u00c2 expression in\ncontrols.\nQuantitative real-time PCR\nQuantitative real-time PCR was performed\nto validate the digital gene expression\nresults. Human pulmonary artery smooth\nmuscle cells for quantitative real-time PCR\nwere purchased from ScienCell Research\nLaboratories and were cultured in the same\nsmooth muscle cell medium as described\nabove. Smooth muscle cells (1 \u00c2 106) were\n(Sigma-Aldrich) for 8 h. Controls were\ntreated with 2 ml DMSO for the same time\nharvested.\nTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol\nreagent according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions. First-strand cDNA was gener-\nated with random primers using a\nSuperScriptTM First-Strand Synthesis\nSystem for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Real-\ntime PCR was performed using the iQ5\nMulticolor Real-Time PCR Detection\nSystem (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,\nCA, USA) with SYBR\u00d5 Premix Ex\nTaqTM II (Takara Biotech Co., Dalian,\nChina) according to the manufacturer's\nprotocol. The target genes were MMP1,\nSERPINB2, GREM1, IL8 and actin. The\ntwo-step PCR protocol included one cycle of\n2 \u00c2 SYBR\u00d5 Premix Ex TaqTM II, 0.8 ml of\neach primer, and 1 ml of DNA template in a\ntotal volume of 25 ml. Experiments were\nperformed in triplicate and were repeated\nat least three times. The threshold cycle (Ct)\nvalues for relative quantification of gene\nexpression were calculated using the 2\u00c0\u00c1\u00c1Ct\nmethod and normalized to b-actin. The PCR\nprimers for MMP1 were GGTCTCTGAG\nTGAGCTGCAACACG (reverse). The pri-\nCTTCTCACCAAACA (reverse). The pri-\nmers for GREM1 were GCTCTGGCATTC\nCTAGCGTGAGAA (reverse). The primers\nAGG (forward) and AAACCAAGGCAC\nAGTGGAAC (reverse). The primers for the\nactin gene were GGCGGCACCACCATG\nTACCCT (forward) and AGGGGCCGG\nGene ontology analysis of the differentially\nexpressed genes\nGene ontology (GO) analysis is a commonly\nused technique to determine the main func-\ntions of differentially expressed genes\naccording to the GO database.18 A P-value\nwas determined for the GO terms and a\ncorrected P-value calculated for the differ-\nentially expressed genes as follows:\nX\ni\u00bco\nM\ni\n \nn \u00c0 i\n \nN\nn\n \nwhere N is the total number of genes with\nthat GO term, n is the number of genes with\nthat GO term in the differentially expressed\ngenes, M is the total number of genes within\nthe particular GO category, m is the number\nof genes within the particular GO category\nin the differentially expressed genes, and i is\nthe number from 0 to m \u00c0 1. The threshold\nof significance was defined as a corrected\nPathway analysis of the differentially\nexpressed genes\nPathway analysis was based on the Kyoto\nEncyclopedia of Genes and Genomes\n(KEGG), a comprehensive pathway-related\ndatabase.19 P-values were calculated using\nthe above equation, where N is the total\nnumber of genes with that pathway annota-\ntion, n is the number of genes with that\npathway annotation in the differentially\nexpressed genes, M is the total number of\ngenes within the particular pathway cat-\negory, m is the number of genes within the\nparticular pathway category in the differen-\ntially expressed genes, and i is the number\nfrom 0 to m \u00c0 1. The threshold of signifi-\ncance was defined as a Q-value 0.05, where\nthe Q-value is an analogue of the P-value\nincorporating false discovery rate-based\nmultiple testing correction.\nStatistical analyses\nAll data were expressed as the mean \u00c6 SD.\nDifferential gene expression levels were\nbased on log2\nratios among the different\ngroups. Statistical comparisons were per-\nformed using the Student's t-test for analyz-\ning two-group data. The threshold of\nsignificance was defined as a P-value < 0.05.\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS software version 13 (SPSS Inc.,\nChicago, IL, USA).\nResults\nDifferentially expressed genes\nCompared with controls, 539 upregulated\ngenes and 367 downregulated genes were\nidentified in cells treated with 8-Br-cGMP,\nregulated genes were identified in cells\ngenes were significantly upregulated and 353\nand 351 genes were significantly downregu-\n(10 mmol/l for 24 h), respectively. A total of\n84 of the upregulated genes and 87 of the\ndownregulated genes showed similar vari-\nation trends in all four groups, suggesting\nthat activation of the NO-sGC-cGMP path-\nway might affect expression of a group of\nimportant downstream factors. Nine genes\nthat were significantly up- or downregulated\ncompared with controls when the NO-sGC-\ncGMP pathway was activated are shown\nin Table 1. Interestingly, these differentially\nexpressed genes are involved in the\nFigure 1.

As the variation trends of most of\nthe differentially expressed genes were\nsimilar in the four treatment groups, GO\nanalysis of the biological process was\nonly performed in the group treated with\nof 68 GO items associated with the differ-\nentially expressed genes were identified\n(Table 2).

From this KEGG pathway analysis,\na large number of significant pathways were\nidentified (Table 3). A variety of signalling\npathways were significantly affected, includ-\ning pathways in cancer, p53 signalling path-\nway, nucleotide oligomerization domain\n(NOD)-like receptor signalling pathway,\nmalaria, mitogen-activated protein kinase\n(MAPK) signalling pathway, base excision\nrepair and basal cell carcinoma.\nDiscussion\nDespite several advances in therapy, there is\ncurrently no curative treatment for PH and\nits pathophysiology is only partially under-\nstood. cGMP, produced by activation of the\nNO-sGC-cGMP pathway, is a key regulator\nof vascular smooth muscle cell contractility,\ngrowth and differentiation, and has been\nshown to be associated with PH.4 However,\nthe regulation of gene expression by cGMP\nand the physiological effects and functions\nof cGMP remain to be fully defined.\nIn the present study, human pulmonary\nartery smooth muscle cells were treated with\n2770, activators of the NO-sGC-cGMP path-\nway, to investigate PH-related differentially\nexpressed genes and signalling pathways.\nUsing digital gene expression tag profiling,\na group of downstream genes that are pos-\nsibly regulated by cGMP were identified.\nAmong the differentially expressed genes\ndetected by Illumina sequencing and con-\nfirmed by quantitative real-time PCR,\nidentified as candidate marker genes that\nmay be crucial in PH development.\nFigure 2.

Numerous studies have\nsuggested that adjustment of the ratio\nbetween MMPs and tissue inhibitors of\nMMPs could potentiate reverse vascular\nremodelling in PH.21 Therefore, understand-\ning the dysregulated expression of MMP1\nmay provide crucial insights into pulmonary\nvascular remodelling.\nSERPINB2, also known as the plasmino-\ngen activator inhibitor-2 gene (PAI-2),\nencodes a member of a large family of\nserine protease inhibitors (serpins), which\nare known to be key regulators of cell\nproliferation, differentiation, complement\nanother member of the serpin family, has\nbeen shown to be significantly downregu-\nlated in pulmonary artery smooth muscle\ncells in IPAH and negatively regulates pul-\nmonary artery smooth muscle cell prolifer-\nation, suggesting that its downregulation\nmay contribute to pathological vascular\nremodelling in IPAH.26 In the present\nstudy, PAI-2 (SERPINB2) was shown to\nbe one of the downstream genes affected by\nthe NO-sGC-cGMP pathway; it is possible\nthat PAI-2 may have a similar function to\nPAI-1 and could alleviate or reverse the\nvascular remodelling in PH through the\nregulation of cell proliferation and apop-\ntosis in pulmonary artery smooth muscle\ncells.\nTable 2.

Using GO analysis,\nregulation of cellular process, biological\nprocess and cellular macromolecule bio-\nsynthetic process were the most signifi-\ncantly enriched items in the present study.\nPathway analysis can reveal the distinct\nbiological processes and identify signalling\npathways; in the present study, enriched\ncategories included pathways in cancer,\np53 signalling pathway, NOD-like receptor\nsignalling pathway, malaria, MAPK signal-\nling pathway, base excision repair and basal\ncell carcinoma. Interestingly, a number of\nthese pathways (pathways in cancer, p53\nsignalling pathway and MAPK signalling\npathway) are involved in cell proliferation,\ncell differentiation and cell apoptosis,29,30\nwhich have been reported to be associated\nwith the vascular remodelling seen during\nPH progression.31,32 These differentially\nexpressed genes may be potent regula-\ntors of pulmonary artery smooth muscle\ncells and dysregulation may lead to\nthe development of pulmonary vascular\nremodelling.\nThe differentially expressed genes identi-\nfied in the present study are probably\nimportant contributors to the pathogenesis\nof PH. However, how cGMP regulates these\ndifferentially expressed genes and how these\ngenes regulate vascular remodelling needs to\nbe further investigated. The functions of the\nother items identified by pathway analysis\nmay also play a role in PH that has not been\nelucidated yet. Validation and investigation\nof the downregulated genes will be under-\ntaken in the future.\nIn conclusion, the present study identified\nsome differentially expressed genes and\nrelated pathways regulated by the NO-\nsGC-cGMP signal pathway, and found\nthat most of the differentially expressed\ngenes were involved in cell proliferation,\ncell migration and apoptosis, which might\ncontribute to the pathological pulmonary\nvascular remodelling in PH. These results\nmay provide a novel insight into the molecu-\nlar mechanisms of PH, especially those\ninvolved in pulmonary vascular remodel-\nling. Further studies on these identified\ngenes and signalling pathways may lead to\nthe discovery of new drug targets for PH\ntherapy.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National\nHigh Technology Research and Development\nDepartment Public Benefit Research Foundation\nResearch and Development Program (grant\nReferences\n1.
