Body mass index (weight-kg/height-m2) was\nderived from measured height and weight data and categorized into: normal weight, overweight,\nand obese. Alcohol consumption was measured using following measures: history of drinking, binge\ndrinking, quantity of drinks/day, frequency of drinking, and average volume of drinks/week.\nApproximately 46% of respondents were classified as current drinkers. Current drinkers had lower\nodds of overweight and obesity were significantly greater among binge drinkers and those\nconsuming four or more drinks/day. However, those who reported drinking one or two drinks per\nrespectively. Similarly, the odds of obesity were significantly lower among those who reported\ndrinking frequently and consuming less than five drinks per week. The association between\noverweight and other alcohol measures was less pronounced.\nConclusion: The results suggest further exploring the possible role of moderate alcohol drinking\nin controlling body weight in adults.\nBackground\nThe proportion of the population that is overweight or\nobese has increased steadily in many developed nations\nincluding the U.S. [1,2]. The continual rise in the preva-\nlence of obesity is of concern to public health agencies\nbecause of its potentially explosive effect on the health of\nindividuals and the cost to the health care system [3,4].\nAlcohol consumption is common in the U.S., with the\npast-month prevalence of consuming at least one drink is\nreported at fifty percent among 12 years and older [5].\nAverage intake of alcohol among adults in the U.S. is\napproximately 10% of the total daily energy intake [6].\n\u00a9 2005 Arif and Rohrer; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nAlcohol, which is the second most energy dense macronu-\ntrient consumed [7], is known to reduce oxidation of fat\nand favors fat storage which may result in weight gain [8].\nHowever, previous studies have shown that despite the\nadded calories, alcohol drinkers do not gain extra weight\nas compared to non-drinkers [6]. Other studies have\nreported a J-shaped relationship between alcohol con-\nsumption and body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio\nsuch that light to moderate drinking has beneficial effect\nin reducing weight whereas non-drinking and heavy or\nrisky drinking having the opposite effect [9,10]. However,\nthe inverse association between alcohol drinking and\nweight gain has been prominent among women with the\nresults among men remaining inconclusive [9,11-14]. The\naims of this study were to assess the cross-sectional rela-\ntionship between alcohol drinking and obesity in a\nnationally representative sample of non-smoking adults,\nusing different measures of alcohol consumption.\nMethods\nSample selection\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nIII is a large cross-sectional survey of non-institutionalized\nData for this study were extracted from two data files: the\nadult questionnaire and the physical examination data\nolder were selected. Those who were pregnant (n = 322)\nor whose information on lifetime drinking (n = 2850) or\ndrinking in the previous 12 months (n = 2) were missing\nwere excluded from the analysis. The analysis was limited\nonly to lifetime non-smokers leaving a final sample size of\nVariables\nThe main dependent variable was body mass index (BMI\n= Weight in kg/height in m2). Weight and height were\nmeasured during physical examination of study partici-\npants. BMI was recorded from the physical examination\ndata file and categorized into normal weight (BMI<25 kg/\nThe main independent variable of interest was alcohol\nconsumption. Alcohol consumption was measured using\nthese questions: 1) History of drinking: in your entire life,\nhave you had at least 12 drinks of any kind of alcoholic bever-\nage (variable MAPE1)? In the past 12 months did you have at\nleast 12 drinks of any kind of alcoholic beverage (variable\nMAPE2)?; 2) Quantity of drinking: on the average, on the\ndays that you drank alcohol, how many drinks did you have a\nday (variable MAPE4)?, those consuming four or more\ndrinks were classified as heavy drinkers; 3) Frequency of\ndrinking (Number of drinking days): in the past 12 months,\nhow many days of the year did you drink any alcoholic bever-\nages (variable MAPE3s)?; 4) Average volume of drinking\nalcoholic beverages = frequency*quantity/52, and 5)\nBinge drinking: In the past 12 months, how many days of the\nyear did you have 5 or more drinks on a single day (variable\nMAPE6S)? The variables MAPE1 and MAPE2 were used to\nclassify respondents to non-drinker, ex-drinker, and cur-\nrent drinker categories. A drink was considered as a 12-oz\nbeer, a 4-oz glass of wine, or an ounce of liquor. In\nNHANES III no distinction was made between different\ntypes of alcoholic drinks. The covariates included in the\nmodel were gender, age, race/ethnicity, marital status,\npoverty income ratio, education, rural/urban, self-rated\nhealth, and leisure time physical activity.\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to describe the characteris-\ntics of the study sample by drinking status. The association\nbetween weight status and risky alcohol drinking, which\nincluded both heavy drinking and binge drinking, was\nmodeled using logistic regression analysis. The associa-\ntion between BMI and different measures of alcohol con-\nsumption was assessed using chi-square statistics.\nMultinomial logistic regression analyses were used to\nassess relationship between the categorical BMI variable\nand alcohol consumption adjusted for all the covariates.\nIn a multinomial logistic regression model the odds of\nassociations for both the overweight and obese categories\nwere compared simultaneously to the normal weight cat-\negory which was used as a common referent. Odds ratios\nand 95 percent confidence intervals were computed and\nadjusted for the confounding effects of age, sex, race/eth-\nnicity, poverty income ratio, education, marital status,\nrural/urban, self-rated health, and leisure time physical\nactivities. Because of the complex survey design, STATA\nstatistical software version 8.2 (College Station, TX),\nwhich allows incorporation of sampling weights, strata,\nand primary sampling units, was used to perform all the\nanalyses.\nResults\nThe overall prevalence of overweight (25 kg/m2<BMI< 30\nkg/m2) and obesity (BMI30 kg/m2) in this sample of\nmen had the highest prevalence of overweight 39.6 per-\nNon-Hispanic Blacks had the highest prevalence of obes-\nApproximately 46 percent of the sample was categorized\nas current drinkers; about ten percent were classified as\nheavy drinkers, consuming four or more drinks per day\n(Table 1).

Almost\none-third of obese individuals were current drinkers.\nTable 2 presents the cross-sectional relationship between\nobesity and drinking patterns. The odds of obesity among\ncurrent drinkers were 0.73 times lower than the odds\ngreater odds of overweight and obesity were observed\nTable 1: Characteristics of the study sample by drinking status- the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988\u00ad\nVariables Non-Drinkers Ex-Drinkers Current Drinkers\nGender\nAge\nRace/Ethnicity\nPoverty Income Ratio\nEducation\nMarital Status\nLocation\nHealth\nLeisure Time Physical\nActivityb\nBody Mass Indexc\na Weighted percent\nb Nine leisure time physical activities (walking, jogging/running, bicycle, swimming, aerobics, other dancing, calisthenics/exercises, garden/yard work,\nweight lift) were summed and categorized into four quartiles.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\namong those engaged in binge drinking. Similarly, those\nwho reported drinking four or more drinks per day had 30\npercent greater odds of being overweight (95%CI: 1.00,\none or two drinks/day had significantly lower odds of\nobesity. When examining the frequency of drinking days,\nsignificantly lower odds of obesity were observed among\nrespondents in higher quartiles.

The results were less pronounced in\nthe overweight category.\nDiscussion\nThis cross-sectional study found an inverse relationship\nbetween moderate consumption of alcohol and obesity in\na large representative sample of non-smoking U.S. adults.\nCurrent drinkers had the lowest odds of obesity. A dose-\nresponse relationship was observed with increasing quan-\ntity of drinks and odds of obesity. Study participants\nreporting drinking one or two drinks per day had lower\nodds of obesity. The association was less pronounced in\nthe overweight category.\nThe major limitation of our study lies in its cross-sectional\nnature which precludes establishing any cause and effect\nTable 2: Multiple logistic regression analysis of overweight and obesity among never smokers- the third National Health and Nutrition\nOverweight Obese\nHistory of Drinking\nBinge Drinking\nQuantity of Drinks/day\nNumber of drinking\ndays/year\nAverage Volume of\nDrinks/weekb\na Adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, poverty income ratio, education, marital status, rural/urban, self-rated health, and leisure time physical\nactivities.

The strength of our study was that it includes\nanthropometric measurements of body mass index which\nmakes our results more reliable and avoids potential bias\nthat may result from self-reported height and weight data.\nHowever, we note that our findings confirm those\nreported in studies using self-reported height and weight.\nWe used different measures of alcohol drinking habits to\nilluminate the role of alcohol drinking on obesity, which\nonly few of the cross-sectional studies have done before.\nHowever, the accuracy of self-reported data on alcohol\nconsumption is subject to debate. Assuming under-report-\ning of alcohol consumption by study respondents, it is\nlikely that our study results are biased downwards. Meas-\nurement of alcohol use also has not been consistent in\nepidemiological studies. Differences in measurements can\nmake cross-study comparisons difficult. Our study was\nlimited to persons who never smoked; hence findings are\nnot generalizable to smokers or past smokers. Use of odds\nratio, instead of prevalence ratio, as an effect measure in a\ncross-sectional study of diseases of high prevalence has\nbeen shown to overestimate the true association [16]. Sta-\ntistical methods to estimate prevalence ratio and its vari-\nance in a survey sample using a categorical outcome\nvariable are not well developed; hence the odds ratio\nremain the effect measure of choice in such studies.\nIn this study, the odds of overweight and obesity were sig-\nnificantly higher among those who indulged in binge\ndrinking and/or heavy drinking (consuming four or more\ndrinks/day). In contrast, light-to-moderate drinking (con-\nsuming one or two drinks/day) was associated with lower\nodds of overweight and obesity. We observed a J-shape\npattern, reported by others [9,10] among women binge\ndrinkers and both men and women heavy drinkers (con-\nsuming four or more drinks/day). The odds of obesity\nlikely among women binge drinkers and non/ex-drinkers\nnon-bingers. No significant association was found among\noverweight women or overweight and/or obese men. For\nheavy drinkers, the adjusted odds of obesity were 2.40\nnon/ex-drinkers, as compared to those who consumed\nless than fours drinks/day. In our earlier study of primary\ncare patients we did not observe any association between\nobesity and binge drinking, possibly due to a small sam-\nple size [13]. Binge drinking is considered as high risk\ndrinking and consumption of a high amount of alcohol\nhas been associated with increased morbidity, mortality,\nand poor self-rated health [17-19]; approximately 8% of\nthe U.S. adult population engages in risky drinking behav-\nior [20]. In a prospective study of British adults, Wannam-\nethee and Shaper [18], reported that heavy alcohol\ndrinkers ( 30 g/d) had the highest prevalence of weight\ngain and obesity, irrespective of the type of alcohol con-\nsumed.\nOther studies have shown an inverse association between\nincreasing quantity of alcohol consumption and weight\ngain. In a study of Danish adults, Vadstrup et al [21]\nfound an inverse association of waist circumference\n(measured ten years after the baseline) with total drinks of\nwine consumed per week. Those who consumed one to\nseven drinks per week had smallest waist circumference.\nNo information on other measures of drinking was avail-\nable. In a randomized controlled trial of German adults,\nFlechtner-Mors et al. [22] evaluated the effectiveness of\nenergy restricted diet among moderate alcohol drinkers\n(consuming one/two drinks/day) and found a reduction\nin body weight among overweight and obese individuals.\nBreslow and Smothers [14] assessed the relationship\nbetween the continuous measure of BMI and four catego-\nries of quantity of drinking and also found a linear dose-\nresponse relationship between BMI and increasing quan-\ntity of drinking alcohol. Our results were similar but pro-\nvided additional information that the beneficial effect of\ndrinking disappears beyond consuming two drinks a day\nand may actually result in weight gain with heavy drink-\ning.\nThe frequency of drinking was inversely related to obesity\nin this sample. Respondents consuming alcohol more fre-\nquently were less likely to be obese. In a recent study of\nprimary care patients attending community clinics, we\n[13] found a significantly lower odds of obesity among\nthose who consumed alcohol three or more days per\nmonth as compared to non-drinkers (Adjusted OR = 0.49,\nand frequency of drinking in a Dannish population. The\nodds of obesity were lower among frequent drinkers, con-\nsuming alcohol seven days a week, as compared to those\ndrinking less frequently. Similarly, Breslow and Smothers\n[14] also found the lowest BMI among persons who drank\nsmall quantities regularly. The effect was primarily\nobserved among females. In our study the association was\nsimilar among males and females. The consistency of the\ninverse relationship observed between obesity and fre-\nquency of drinking suggest that the beneficial effect of\ndrinking on obesity is present when the alcohol is con-\nsumed in moderate amounts on a regular basis.\nWe also explored association between overweight/obesity\nand average volume of drinking per week. Those drinking\nless than five drinks per week had lower odds of obesity.\nIt has been argued that the association between BMI and\nalcohol consumption is obscured when average volume is\nused as a measure of alcohol consumption [14]. However,\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nour results were consistent with the results obtained using\nother measures of alcohol consumption in the study.\nConclusion\nThe beneficial effect of moderate use of alcohol beverages\non diabetes and other chronic diseases has been well\nestablished [24-27]. However, prospective epidemiologi-\ncal studies are needed to confirm if the same beneficial\neffects can be extended to the obesity. Actively promoting\nmoderate use of alcohol as a strategy to combat obesity\nwould be inappropriate at this early stage of our under-\nstanding about the underlying mechanisms that link alco-\nhol use with weight control. Furthermore, it should be\nnoted that the data give no evidence to advise non-drink-\ners to start drinking alcohol just for reducing body weight.\nHowever, the evidence reported here argues against a\nstrategy of promoting complete abstention at-least among\nthose who regularly consume alcohol.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nAAA carried out the study, performed statistical analyses\nand drafted the manuscript.
