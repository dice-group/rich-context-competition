There are a\nnumber of traits that are correlated with or predict social dominance, including physical\nsize, aggression, masculinity, and rank, but also persuasion, cooperation, and friendship.\nThe roles of these various interactive traits have not been fully elucidated, that is there is no\nobvious evidence that any one of these traits is a necessary component of social dominance,\nand it is likely that there are varying ways in which socially dominant traits or attributes\nmay combine to allow an individual to compete with others in the group for access to\nvalued items or opportunities.\nAcademic study of dominance and dominant behavior has focused primarily on\ndominance by men. There is good reason for researchers to focus on the expression and\nperception of dominance in men. Across many species, men tend to be larger and more\nContext, Rank, and Mate Choice\naggressive than women (see Alexander, Hoogland, Howard, Noonan, and Sherman, 1979\nfor a review). Competition among men can be fierce and has direct fitness consequences,\nleading to sexual selection for traits associated with defeating other men due to access\ngained to women as well as direct female choice (Darwin, 1871). Within humans, where\nmoderate sexual dimorphism exists for traits like body size (e.g., Gustafsson and\nLindenfors, 2009) and physical aggression (see Campbell, 1999 for a review), we find\nsignificant effects of dominance in how men are perceived by women, and for reproductive\nfamous examples of exceptionally dominant men who monopolize the reproduction of\nmany women seem to point to such dominance as an adaptive male characteristic. Betzig\n(1986) describes the \"Genghis Khan effect,\" which seems appropriate given that Khan and\nhis male relatives are theorized to be the ancestors of approximately 16 million modern\nhumans (Zerjal et al., 2003). Additionally, nearly 20% of men in northwestern Ireland are\nlikely to have descended from a single warlord from the 5th century (Moore, McEvoy,\nCape, Simms, and Bradley, 2006) which further emphasizes the potential effects that male\nrank can have on reproductive success.\nInterest in male dominance, however, does not explain why female dominance has\nbeen relatively ignored. Women vary a great deal in traits like aggression, assertiveness and\nother personality measures associated with dominance (see Hyde, 2005). Certainly there\nare differences in rank among women, where some women have greater access to resources\nthan others or have authority over others. In an extreme example, it has been demonstrated\nthat adolescent women in an institutional setting establish a dominance hierarchy through\naggressive and sometimes violent behavior but the highest ranked women tended to neither\naggress nor experience aggression from others. They also claimed more \"territory\" within\nthe institution and had more opportunities to solicit attention from men (Deutsch, Esser,\nand Sossin, 1978). Although women in a less-structured environment may demonstrate\ndifferent forms of leadership, or become leaders for different types of tasks compared to\nmen, women do take leadership roles and demonstrate dominance (Eagly and Karau,\n1991).What fitness consequences might be associated with such differences among\nwomen?\nIn a comprehensive review, Ellis (1995) outlined a variety of ways in which\ndominance may be linked to reproductive success among women in non-human mammal\nspecies. Some obvious measures of reproductive success include number of offspring born,\nand number that survive infancy. Other, more indirect correlates of reproductive success or\npotential include age of onset of sexual activity, reproductive suppression (or harassment)\nof other women, number of partners or copulations, and length of reproductive lifespan.\nAmong non-primates (rodents in particular), Ellis (1995) documented that female\ndominance is strongly associated with reproductive success, and among some primates\nthere appears to also be a predictive relationship between rank and reproductive success.\nInterestingly, reproductive success measured by number of offspring who survive is more\nlikely to be tied to mothers' rank than is absolute number of offspring born (as in Pusey,\nWilliams, and Goodall, 1997). In a recent study of effects of maternal rank among baboons,\nsons of high-ranking mothers had lower levels of circulating stress hormones than did sons\nof lower-ranking mothers (Onyango, Gesquiere, Wango, Alberts, and Altmann, 2008). It\nshould be noted that the mothers rank at the time of conception was key, rather than her\nrank at the time of measurement. In fact, the men in this study were 4-6 years past the point\nContext, Rank, and Mate Choice\nof maternal care, and many had outlived their mothers. Further evidence of such rank\neffects on offspring is seen among hyenas, where dominant women' high androgen levels\nin late gestation predict dominant behaviors among their offspring, compared to the\noffspring of lower-ranked women who also had lower gestational androgen levels (Dloniak,\nFrench, and Holekamp, 2006). Although it is not the case that female dominance is\nconsistently predictive of reproductive success, neither is male dominance (Ellis, 1995).\nBased on Ellis' review, it does appear, however, to be one important factor among non-\nhuman mammals.\nResults among humans are not entirely clear. Some studies on effects of female\ndominance for mate choice indicate that female dominance has no effect on male choice\n(Fletcher, Tither, O'Loughlin, Friesen, and Overall, 2004; Sadalla, Kenrick, and Versure,\n1987). When cues of dominance are portrayed as \"masculine\" traits, then women who\npossess those traits are perceived as less attractive (Keisling and Gynther, 1993). Buss\n(1981) has demonstrated, however, that men and women express dominance in different\nways. According to Buss, men are more likely to express dominance in an egoistic or\nagentic manner, where personal goal attainment is enhanced. Femen are more likely to\nexpress dominance in a more prosocial or communal manner, where both personal and\ngroup interests are furthered. Additionally, men seem to prefer or respect agentic\nexpressions of dominance, and women seem to respect prosocial expressions. This is\nconsistent with a meta-analysis (Eagly and Karau, 1991) that reviewed gender differences\nin the emergence of leadership. Thus, conceptualizing female dominance in masculine\nterms may be counterproductive to understanding effects of female dominance. To add\nfurther texture to the topic, it has been demonstrated that female dominance may interact\nwith physical attractiveness, such that dominance may play a greater role in reproductive\nsuccess when a female is not highly attractive (Gutierres, Kenrick, and Partch, 1999;\nKenrick, Neuberg, Zierk, and Krones, 1994). Once again, when we examine the literature\non male dominance, cues about male dominance may not always be preferred by women.\nFor example, we find that men perceived as dominant via cues of facial hypermasculinity\nseem to be less preferred for long-term relationships (Little, Jones, Penton-Voak, Burt, and\nPerrett, 2002) which may be due to attributions about character and parenting potential\n(e.g., Perrett et al., 1998). Such attributions are not surprising, given that such men describe\nthemselves as investing less in parenting and relationship maintenance (Waynforth, 2002).\nIf female rank has any influence on reproductive success, its effects may differ\nacross individuals or environmental conditions. In a study that determined that men\nsometimes attend to female dominance cues, Brown and Lewis (2004) presented\nphotographs and descriptive paragraphs to participants, and asked them to evaluate and rate\nthe targets on a variety of measures. The authors found that men were more likely to find a\nsubordinate female attractive for long-term relationships. Interestingly, they found no effect\nof male rank on female choice, nor did rank appear to impact affiliation ratings (willingness\nto socialize with the target) by same- or opposite-sex participants. There are some potential\nconfounds to the interpretation of these data.\nPrimarily, the context in which Brown and Lewis' (2004) descriptions were framed\nmay have influenced responding. Paragraphs were written to describe individuals in one of\nthree levels of dominance as indicated by rank, and those ranks were relative to the subject\nin the experiment. For example, the subject was to imagine that the target was his or her\nassistant, coworker, or supervisor, depending on the experimental condition. Placing these\nContext, Rank, and Mate Choice\ndescriptors in a workplace setting may invoke power dynamics that will alter mate choice\ndecisions in a manner that is not reflective of attraction, per se. Although the authors were\ncareful to indicate that there were no rules in this particular workplace against employee\nfraternization, participants may still have been more cautious about such relationships. A\nsecond potential problem relates to the photographs used in the study. The authors were\ncareful to use one male and one female photograph that had been selected by independent\nraters to be roughly equal in both age and attractiveness, but no information was provided\nas to how attractive or how old those photos were perceived to be. Thus, it is possible that\nparticipants were using cues about age, particularly for judging the suitability of female\ntargets for long-term relationships. Further, other researchers have found that dominance\ninteracts with attractiveness for judgments of female targets such that cues of subordination\ntend to be more appealing in physically attractive targets (Gutierres et al., 1999; Kenrick et\nal., 1994), so effects should be interpreted accordingly. Without knowledge of the\napproximate age or attractiveness of the photos, we cannot fully interpret Brown and\nIn the present study, our goal was to replicate the basic methodology used by\nBrown and Lewis (2004), while attempting to remove the potential confound of \"workplace\nromance\" and use photographs that were selected for similarity, but also for cues of age and\nattractiveness that would be generally appealing to our undergraduate sample. We\nhypothesized that women would demonstrate a greater preference for a higher-ranked man\nwhen that man was not perceived to be her immediate supervisor (which would differ from\nBrown and Lewis' results), and that men would be most attracted to a lower-ranked woman\n(consistent with Brown and Lewis' results). Further, we predicted that cues of rank would\nhave a larger impact on mate choice ratings in the recreational context than in the work-\nrelated context.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nA total of 426 undergraduates at Grant MacEwan College (a liberal arts institution\nin northwestern Canada) participated in this study for course credit in an introductory\npsychology course. From that sample, we used data from 137 male and 271 female\nparticipants. All participants answered questions about their willingness to affiliate with the\ntarget, and we asked participants to answer mate choice questions only if they were\nsexually attracted to individuals who are the sex of the target. Eighteen participants\nprovided answers that were consistent with homosexual orientation, but here we have\nreported data only from individuals who provided answers consistent with heterosexual\norientation. It is possible, however, that there are members of our sample who are bisexual,\nor did not respond in a manner consistent with their actual sexual orientation.\nThe focus group that rated the photos (described later) was comprised of 10 male\nand 15 female senior undergraduate students (M = 21.8 yrs \u00b1 0.09 SEM) who did not\nparticipate in the study. These students were recruited for voluntary participation from a\nsenior-level History of Psychology course.\nProcedure\nContext, Rank, and Mate Choice\nParticipants were randomly assigned to one of 12 experimental conditions in a 2\n(Participant Sex) X 2 (Target Sex) X 2 (Work/Recreation Context) X 3 (Relative Rank)\nbetween-subjects design. Our dependent variables were ratings of willingness to affiliate\nwith the target in both sexual and non-sexual situations. We also included a manipulation\ncheck question, which is described in a later paragraph.\nWe presented each participant with a paragraph describing a single target individual\n(see below), and a photograph. Paragraphs varied by context (work-related versus\nrecreational) and by relative rank (subordinate, equal or superior to the participant). The\nparagraphs we presented were based on those used by Brown and Lewis (2004), but we had\nthe target work for a different company, or play for a different soccer team, in order to\nreduce the likelihood that participants would answer based on potential repercussions of\nengaging in a relationship with the target (e.g., getting fired, or asked to leave the team).\nHigh rank/work related/man target example:\nPlease imagine that you work for a company, and that company has sent you to a\nconvention to learn about new software for your office. You have been seated next\nto John, who works for a different company across town. John works in a position\nthat would be equivalent to that of your immediate supervisor (the person that you\nreport to on a daily basis, who is responsible for employee discipline and for\nrewarding reliable or creative performance). John seems like a nice man, he has a\ngood sense of humor, and he is friendly.\nLow rank/recreational/woman target example:\nPlease imagine that you play for a recreational soccer team, where you are a veteran\nplayer, and you are attending a local tournament. You have just met Sarah, who is\nfriendly and has a good sense of humor. You've really enjoyed talking to her about\nyour most recent game, and about local restaurants. Sarah is a rookie on her team\n(she's only been playing for a few months), and has a lot of great restaurant\nsuggestions for you.\nIn the equal rank conditions, targets were described as holding the same job as the\nparticipant, or having equivalent soccer experience as the participant.\nWe selected photographs in a manner similar to that used by Brown and Lewis\n(2004). Thirty portrait photographs (15 male and 15 female) from a stock-photography\nwebsite (www.sxc.hu) were presented to a group of raters who evaluated the photos for age\nand attractiveness. The raters were all senior students who did not participate in the study.\nBased on those ratings, we selected one male and one female photograph. Both photos were\nperceived as within an age range that would be attractive to an undergraduate population\n(see Kenrick, Keefe, Gabrielidis, and Cornelius, 1996). The man was perceived to be\napproximately 27 years old (M = 26.8 \u00b1 0.9 SEM) and the woman was perceived to be\napproximately 25 years old (M = 25.1 \u00b1 1.1 SEM). We chose photos that appeared to be in\ntheir mid-20s so that it would be somewhat believable that these targets could be\nsupervisors in a work-related setting, without being dramatically older than our typical\nparticipant population.\nParticipants read the paragraphs, then viewed the photo, and were then asked to\nContext, Rank, and Mate Choice\ngive their impressions of the targets. We used the same questions used by Brown and Lewis\n(2004), so all participants rated the extent to which they would like to work for the target,\nwork with the target, or have the target work for them. They were then asked how much\nthey would enjoy exercising, or going to a party with the target. Opposite-sex participants\nalso rated the desirability of the target for dating, marriage or a one-time sexual encounter.\nFinally, as a manipulation check, participants were asked to rate the relative dominance of\nthe target using the question \"When you compare [the target] to yourself, how much power\nor status do you think [the target] has?\". All ratings were provided by the participant\nmaking an X along a line, between options similar to \"not at all\" and \"very.\" We then\nmeasured the distance (mm) from \"not at all\" to the participant's X. Responses could vary\nbetween 0 and 12.4 mm (thus, 6.2 mm was the absolute midpoint of the scale).\nResults\nManipulation check\nFor analyses of the manipulation check, we performed a 2 (Participant Sex) X 2\n(Target Sex) X 2 (Work/Recreation Context) X 3 (Relative Rank) ANOVA. There was a\ninteractions revealed that low-ranked men in the work-related scenario were seen as less\npowerful than were women described in the same way, t = -3.16, p = 0.003, and also much\nwere described as equal-rank in the workplace setting, male targets were rated higher for\nmen were rated more highly in the workplace setting than in the soccer setting, t( 64) =\n3.06, p = 0.003. There was no significant difference in ratings for high-rank men and\nwomen in neither the workplace nor the recreational setting, or for men and women\ndescribed as \"rookies\" in the recreational scenario. Thus, participants did perceive that they\nwould have power over targets described as subordinate, but this effect was somewhat\nmore pronounced in the workplace setting, and differed by sex in the workplace setting\n(Figure 1a). In particular, low-ranking men in the workplace setting were seen as\nparticularly subordinate, but equal-ranked men were rated higher than the midpoint of the\nscale. In the recreational setting, there was less differentiation by rank, although all\n\"coaches\" got higher ratings (Figure 1b).\nContext, Rank, and Mate Choice\nFigure 1a.

For analyses of mate choice ratings, we performed 2\n(Target Sex) X 2 (Work/Recreation Context) X 3 (Relative Rank) ANOVAs. There was a\nmain effect of target sex, such that female targets were given higher ratings by male\nfemale participants. Beyond this expected effect, there were no main effects of\nwork/recreation context or relative rank. Further, there were no simple interactions among\nthe variables. The only significant interaction was a context X rank X target sex interaction,\nthere appears to be a different influence of rank cues on long-term mate choice ratings in\nthe recreational setting, and those effects seem to differ by sex (Figure 2). Further analysis\non data from the recreational context revealed a significant dominance X target sex\ndominance women were rated more highly than low-dominance women, t(44) = 2.15, p =\n0.037, but this pattern did not occur for male targets.\nFigure 2a.

We found\nseveral interactions for the affiliation question about willingness to go to a party with the\nanalyses revealed that participants seemed to be less willing to go to a party with\nthe recreational setting. Subordinate male targets in the work setting received the lowest\nratings for going to a party, which is reflected in a context X rank X target sex interaction,\np = 0.038, suggests that male participants are more willing to go to a party with equals or\nsuperiors, t(73) = 2.00, p = 0.05, compared to female participants.

Relative dominance, as indicated by rank, did\nappear to affect affiliation decisions, but not mate choice. Further, the effects of dominance\ncues seem to be mediated by the context in which they are expressed. Work-related settings\nmay be more structured by hierarchical dominance, such that our perception of rank is a\nmore salient cue in those contexts. In our recreational context, participants did not seem to\ndifferentiate players by rank, although coaches were seen as more dominant. Perhaps in the\nmore social context of playing recreational sport, rank is less obvious and exerts less\ncontrol over our behavior or attitudes. Interestingly, although rank may be seen as more\nsalient in the workplace setting, such cues may actually inhibit mate choice behaviors in the\nworkplace. For long-term mate choice, in particular, there were greater differences among\nratings of targets, by rank condition, in the recreational setting compared to the work-\nrelated setting, whereas there was somewhat more uniformity across dominance conditions\nin the work-related setting.\nWe found that context had a greater effect on affiliation decisions in this study than\ndid rank. This result suggests that researchers should be aware that the context of a written\nscenario can be an experimental confound. In Brown and Lewis' (2004) study, the authors\nsuggested that men attend to cues of dominance and demonstrate a preference for\nsubordinate women, yet it is also possible that male participants in that study were\nresponding to potential consequences of engaging in relationships with superiors or\ncoworkers. If the power-structure in work-related settings makes us attend more to cues of\nrank, then it is to be expected that participants would respond in a manner that reflects not\nonly mate choice decisions, but also an awareness of the dangers of dual relationships in\nthe workplace.\nAn alternative explanation for the relative absence of main effects of rank in our\nstudy is that rank is not a particularly important aspect of person perception. We do treat\npeople differently based on rank or perceived authority, but it is also the case that some\n\"superiors\" are not respected regardless of their position in a hierarchy. Do we attend more\nto dominant behaviors rather than relative rank? As previously described, researchers have\nfound a number of powerful effects of both male and female dominance, using both\nhierarchical dominance cues (rank) or behavioral dominance cues (assertiveness). It would\nbe worthwhile to determine whether behavioral cues are more salient than hierarchical cues\nby explicitly contrasting effects of those cues for affiliation decisions.\nIt is also possible that the absence of effect of rank is due to small sample sizes in\nsome conditions. Although we had sufficient observed power to feel confident in our\nsignificant results, there was lower power for several of our analyses where no effect was\nfound. It would be worth replicating this study with a larger sample (especially a larger\nsample of men) in order to be sure that we are not making a Type II error.\nWe interpret our results as evidence that cues of rank, at least in this sort of study,\nare not sufficient to affect mate choice in any consistent way. It is entirely possible,\nContext, Rank, and Mate Choice\nhowever, that the physical attractiveness of our targets was sufficiently high as to mask any\neffects of dominance. If cues about dominance are \"luxury\" traits in the evaluation of\nwomen, in particular, (Li, Bailey, Kenrick, and Linsemeier, 2002) then it is to be expected\nthat a target who is very physically attractive might be rated highly regardless of\ndominance level. Further, the photos that we used were not selected for relative masculinity\nor femininity. We know that cues of facial masculinity affect perception of dominance\n(Perrett et al., 1998) so the photos we selected may have been confounding participants'\nimpressions of the targets.\nDominance, whether hierarchical or behavioral, does not likely have linear effects\non impression formation in social situations. There are multiple factors that interactively\ninfluence the perception of dominance, including rank, physical size, relative masculinity,\nassertiveness, aggression, and the ability to persuade or coerce others. In short, there are\nvarying ways to be dominant (Buss, 1981) and this can result in differential preferences.\nFurther, as we, and Brown and Lewis (2004), have demonstrated, dominance of a target is\nperceived in a manner that is relative to the participant, and may be dependent upon a\nparticipant's beliefs about dominant individuals. Finally, as we have demonstrated in this\nstudy, the environment in which cues are evaluated may have an important influence on the\nefficacy of dominance cues for impression formation. So, if dominance is not a singular\ntrait, we cannot expect dominance to have singular effects. Future research must\nsystematically contrast and isolate parcels of variables associated with dominance in order\nto determine which variables have the greatest (potentially interactive) effects, and also\ndetermine what environmental cues mediate these effects.\nReferences\nAlexander, R.
