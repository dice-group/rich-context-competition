No associations were observed for men.\nMethods: Using the same NHANES 2001\u00ad2002 data, associations of urinary perchlorate with indirect biomarkers of thyroid hormone\ndisruption were investigated. Decreased levels of hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), and high density lipoprotein (HDL) have been\nobserved among subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism. To investigate the suitability of these indicators for use in observational\n\nwomen, age 50\u00ad85; and pregnant women. Use of perchlorate quintiles (Q1-Q5) and continuous log-transformed perchlorate in the\nregression models allowed investigation of both non-linear and linear associations. Adjustments were made for age, urinary creatinine,\nrace/ethnicity, body mass index, cotinine, poverty index, hours of fasting, thiocyanate, nitrate, daily kcal intake, C-reactive protein.\nAdjustment for alcohol consumption depended on availability. Adjustment for prescription drugs (beta-blockers, sex hormones, antihy-\nperlipidemic and antidiabetic drugs) was made if it changed the perchlorate estimate by $10%.\nResults: Statistically significant decreases were observed for HGB and HCT among boys, men, women age 15\u00ad49, and pregnant\nwomen, and for HDL among men.\nConclusions:Although the mean response biomarkers were within normal range, their association with urinary perchlorate is of interest.\nHGB and HCT among pregnant women showed a stronger association with urinary perchlorate than non-pregnant women age 15\u00ad49.\nStatistically significant associations were observed for individual perchlorate quintiles. Assumption of linearity of log-transformed per-\nchlorate may result in underestimation of some associations.\n",

It prevents\niodide from entering the thyroid, which may lead to\ndiminished production of thyroid hormones. Several\nstudies have discussed the risks of environmental\nexposures to perchlorate, especially the potential\nadverse effects on thyroid hormone function.1\u00ad4\nUrinary perchlorate levels can be used as non-\ninvasive surrogate biological markers of exposure,\nbecause perchlorate is not metabolized in the human\nbody.1 Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and\nthyroxine (T4) are measured as direct biological\nmarkers of effect on thyroid economy, as for example\nin newborn screening and adult testing for hypo- and\nhyperthyroidism. A recent study based on the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\nwithTSH andT4.2 Results showed that increased levels\nof urinary perchlorate were associated with increased\nlevels of TSH for all women, and decreased levels of\nT4 for women with low urinary iodine (,100 \u00b5g/L).\nNo association was observed for men. Another study\nobserved that smoking and thiocyanate interact with\nperchlorate in diminishing thyroid function.3 These\nstudies brought attention to the gender-specific effect\nof perchlorate on the thyroid.5\nThyroid hormones are a requisite for proper\n\nneurodevelopment and physiological function through-\nout life. Levels of thyroid hormones (THs) serve as\ndirect indicators of thyroid hormone \ndysfunction.\nExamples are increased levels of TSH associated with\nnormal or decreased levels of T4, or decreased lev-\nels of T4 without a change of TSH, which may occur\nwhen T4 is displaced from its binding protein by a\n\nxenobiotic. Another type of disruption occurs when\nendocrine disrupting chemicals displace THs from\ntheir receptors, which can change the \nstructure and\nthe signaling of the TH receptor \nwithout \nnecessarily\nchanging the TH levels.5\u00ad8 Signaling pathways of dif-\nferent nuclear receptors, including TH \nreceptors, can\ncross-talk with each other, and disrupt theTH transcrip-\ntion process with unknown biological consequences.6,7\nChemicals that are known to cause adverse changes in\ncirculating TH levels have been classified as thyroid\ntoxicants.6 In contrast, endocrine disrupting chemi-\ncals that cause perturbation of TH action through their\nreceptors, such as signaling, without causing a change\nin TH levels, are not included in the definition of thy-\nroid toxicants.6 Given that environmental pollutants\ncan affect THs in different ways, it may be useful to\ninvestigate if in addition to the routinely used \"direct\"\nindicators, \"\nindirect\" biomarkers of TH dysfunction\ncan be identified, in order to expand the available\nnumber of biomarkers measuring the level of TH dys-\nfunction in observational human studies. Therefore, to\nexpand observations of adverse effects associated with\nTH, both changes in TH levels and TH action may\nhave to be considered. The problem is how to deter-\nmine perturbation of TH action. Thyroid hormones\nplay an important role in many functions of the body,\nsuch as lipid metabolism, enzyme activity, neurologic,\nendothelial, and cardiac functions.9,10 Interference of\nTH action by environmental pollutants may adversely\naffect one or more of these systems, which may be indi-\ncated by effect biomarkers, such as decreased \nlevels\nof HDL, HGB or HCT (\"indirect\" markers of thyroid\n\ndysfunction). High density lipoprotein (HDL), a major\nfactor in the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) mech-\nanism, removes excess cholesterol from peripheral tis-\nsues to the liver for excretion.11\u00ad15 A decrease of HDL\nmay indicate a perturbation of the RCT mechanism,\nthe key enzymes of which are under control of TH.16,17\nThe erythrocyte-related indices haemoglobin (HGB)\nand hematocrit (HCT) may be potential indicators of\nTH changes. Among subjects with overt or subclini-\ncal hypothyroidism, decreased HGB and HCT have\nbeen observed, which are thought to be associated with\ndecreased TH-controlled hematopoiesis.18\u00ad20\nBecause the traditionally used direct biomarkers\nof thyroid status (TSH and T4) were not associated\nwith perchlorate among men,2 the purpose of this\nstudy is to investigate if HDL, HGB, and HCT are\nsuitable indirect indicators of TH dysfunction among\nboth men and women.\nMethods\nData source and exclusion criteria\nThe data source for this study was NHANES\n\nsurvey datasets collected by the Centers for Disease\nControl (CDC).21 The purpose of these surveys is\nto obtain information on the nutritional and health\nstatus of the US general population. Because these\ndatasets do not contain identifiable private informa-\ntion, studies based on these data are exempt from IRB\napproval. The total number of subjects in the sub-\npopulation selected for perchlorate analysis of spot\n(n = 1568). The current study excluded subjects based\non the following criteria: missing perchlorate values;\nprevious diagnosis of diseases in which TH dysfunc-\ntion might have played a role, such as congestive\nheart failure, coronary heart disease, angina pectoris,\nacute myocardial infarction, stroke, cancer, diabetes\nmellitus, thyroid problems and use of prescribed thy-\nroid hormones. Values judged to be outliers, such as\nexcluded.\nVariables and statistical analyses\nThe analyses were applied to six groups of subjects:\nwomen of reproductive age, but non-pregnant, ages\ndetermined by test. The reason for categorizing men\nand women by different age groups is the following.\nAlcohol consumption, which is an important vari-\nable, was available only for subjects ages 20 and over.\nTherefore men were categorized by age groups ,20\nand $20, so that alcohol could be adjusted for in those\nat age 20 years and older. However, women were cat-\negorized by reproductive status, which was thought\nto be more meaningful with regard to potential asso-\nciations with perchlorate.\nRegression analysis was used to assess the associ-\nation of levels of urinary perchlorate as the exposure\nsurrogate with the biological measures HDL, HGB,\nand HCT. HDL was natural-log transformed in order\nto reduce skewness. HGB and HCT were approxi-\nmately normally distributed. The exposure variable\nof interest, urinary perchlorate, was used in several\nways: (1) as an indicator variable representing indi-\nvidual quintiles (Q1 through Q5), with Q1 as the ref-\n(2) grouping of contiguous perchlorate quintiles, eg,\nQ1 as the referent; and (3) continuous perchlorate\n(natural log transformed). Use of these different per-\nchlorate measures allows identification of both non-\nlinear and linear associations.\nMost of the explanatory variables selected for this\nstudy are the same as those used by Blount et al.2 The\nfollowing variables were included in all regression\nanalyses: age (years, continuous), urinary creatinine\n(mg/dL, continuous, log transformed); race/\nethnicity:\nnon-Hispanic White (referent), \nHispanic \nAmerican,\nnon-Hispanic Black, other race/ethnicity; body\nmass index (BMI, continuous, log-transformed),\ncotinine: low, (,0.015 ng/mL referent), medium\nSteinmaus and Miller;3 poverty index, the ratio of\nfamily income to poverty threshold (dichotomous, ,1\nversus $1); hours of fasting (log-\ntransformed, con-\ntinuous), thiocyanate (mg/L, continuous, log-trans-\nformed); nitrate (mg/L, continuous, log-transformed);\ndailykcalintake(continuous,log-transformed),which\nis closely related to dietary iron intake;22 C-reactive\nprotein (CRP, mg/dL, continuous, log-transformed).\nThiocyanate (mg/L) and nitrate (mg/L) were included\nbecause, like perchlorate, they may impair thyroid\nfunction by inhibiting iodide uptake by the thyroid.\nAdditionaladjustmentsweremadeforsomegroups.\nInformation on alcohol consumption (none, referent;\nlow, 1\u00ad10 drinks per week; high, 11 or more drinks\nper week) was available only for subjects ages 20 and\nover, and was included in the regressions for men,\nage 20 and over, women age 50 and over, and women\nto \"none\". Two separate indicator variables were cre-\nated for the regression analyses, indicating low alco-\nhol use (1 = yes, 0 = otherwise) and high alcohol use\n(1 = yes, 0 = otherwise). \nAdjustments were made for\nuse of the following prescription drugs: beta blockers,\nsex hormones (contraceptives, androgens, estrogens,\nprogestins), antihyperlipidemic agents; antidiabetic\nand women age 50 and over. \nIndicator variables\nwere created for each of the prescriptions with val-\nues 1 = yes (taking this prescription) or 0 (not taking\nthis prescription). Non-pregnant women age 15\u00ad49\nwere also adjusted for having been pregnant in the\npast year (1 = yes, 0 = no) and for having a men-\nstrual period (1 = yes, 0 = no) at time of sampling.\n\nRegression analyses for girls age 6\u00ad14 were adjusted\nSchreinemachers\nfor \nmenarchal status by an indicator variable with\n\nvalues 1 (= first period had occurred before interview)\notherwise). Because no information was avail-\nable for girls age 6\u00ad11, they were assumed to be pre-\nadditional adjust-\nments were included for pregnant women because of\ntheir low sample size.\nLaboratory methods have been described in detail\npreviously.2,21 Whole blood and spot urine samples\nwere collected and stored cold or frozen. HDL was\nmeasured using a heparin-manganese precipitation\nmethod. HGB and HCT were obtained from a com-\nplete blood count on a Beckman Coulter counter.\nUrinary perchlorate, thiocyanate, and nitrate were\nanalytically measured by ion chromatography tan-\ndem mass spectrometry.\nRegression analyses were performed using the\nSAS procedure PROC SURVEYREG.23 This pro-\ncedure applies linear regression to a non-randomly\nselected study population by accounting for corre-\nlations between sampling clusters and by assigning\nweights to subjects, so that outcomes are representa-\ntive of the US general population. The Wilcoxon rank\nsum test was used for the comparison of the depen-\ndent variables between subject groups. The Spear-\nman correlation test was used to measure correlations\nbetween variables.\nThe parameter estimates  and 95% confidence\ninterval (CI) represent the change of the dependent\nvariable associated with a perchlorate quintile or\ncombined quintiles for non-linear associations, or a\nunit of continuous log-transformed perchlorate, indi-\ncating a linear association, with adjustment for other\ncharacteristics.\nResults\nThe total number of excluded subjects was 848 due\nto: missing perchlorate values (n = 122); thyroid\nassociated diseases (n = 489); use of prescribed thy-\nroid hormones (n = 321); and TSH and CRP outli-\ners (n = 5). The remaining number of subjects was\nwomen. Characteristics of the resulting study popula-\ntion are presented in Table 1. Distribution character-\nistics of urinary perchlorate for the six study groups\nare presented in Table 2. The highest perchlorate con-\ncentrations were observed for the younger male and\nfemale subjects, followed by the pregnant women.\nTable 3 presents unadjusted means and standard\nerrors for the three outcome variables (HGB, HCT,\nand HDL) by quintiles of urinary perchlorate for\neach of the six study groups. Although the means by\nperchlorate quintile were within normal range, both\nlinear and non-linear associations with urinary per-\nchlorate were observed. An example of a possible\nnon-linear relationship was the decrease observed for\nHDL, which dropped at the 2nd and 3rd perchlorate\nand continued to stay at a lower level. Other variables\nshowed a more direct linear decrease with increasing\nperchlorate concentration, eg, HGB and HCT among\npregnant women.\nRegression-based associations between urinary\nperchlorate and the three outcome variables of inter-\nest are presented in Table 4A and B.\nThe average level of association with HGB and\nHCT showed a significant decrease with coefficients\nrespectively. No significant association was observed\nwith HDL.\nAssociations with HGB and HCT were not clearly\n\nlinear, although the highest values were observed in\nQ5. The coefficients associated with log-transformed\nperchlorate for HGB and HCT were -0.18\nThe regression model for log-transformed HDL\nshowed a significant decrease based on the coefficient\nagreed with the \"drop off\" observed for the unad-\njusted data (Table 3). At higher concentrations of uri-\nnary perchlorate HDL started to increase.\nNo significant associations with perchlorate were\nobserved for HGB, HCT, or HDL.\n(Table 4B)\nhol consumption was not available for this age group.\nTo check if the value \"no alcohol use\" could be\nassigned to these women, the following analysis was\nalcohol, 27% were low alcohol users, and 4% were\nhigh users in the last 12 months. Regression models\nfor women age 20\u00ad49 showed that the estimated effect\nof alcohol consumption on the dependent variables of\ninterest in this study was no more than 1%. This, and\nthe fact that alcohol consumption is either none or low\nfor most women, are reasons to believe setting alco-\nhol consumption for 15\u00ad19 year old women to zero\nis reasonable. The strongest decrease for HGB and\nHCT was observed in Q3, followed by an increase.\nThe coefficients for HGB and HCT in Q3 were -0.67\nNo associations were observed for HDL.\nNo associations were observed for HGB, HCT,\nor HDL.\nIn spite of the low number of observations, statistically\nsignificant decreases were observed for HGB\nTable 1.

In contrast to the non-pregnant\nwomenofreproductiveage,estimatesfortheindividual\nperchlorate quintiles among pregnant women showed\nthat the association between perchlorate and HGB,\nHCTwas monotonic, resulting in a significant estimate\nfor the overall perchlorate association.

Although the means of\nthese indirect effect biomarkers are within normal\nrange (Table 3), their negative association with uri-\nnary perchlorate is of interest, such as decreased HDL\namong men and decreased HGB and HCT among\nboth men and women. Reports have been published\non decreased levels of HDL among subjects with sub-\n2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) which is\nknown to displace T4 from its binding site on the car-\nrier protein transthyretin26 and thus may be involved\nin TH dysfunction, was shown to be associated with\ndecreased levels of HDL.27 Regarding associations\nbetween direct and indirect indicators of thyroid dys-\nfunction, statistically significant negative associations\nhave been observed between HDL and values of TSH\nwithin the reference range.28,29 Among older subjects,\nTSH and HGB were significantly inversely correlated\namong those with hypothyroidism and anemia.30\nPatients with chronic stable heart failure showed that\nthose that developed hypothyroidism, subclinical\nTable 4A.

The purpose of this study was to investi-\ngate associations with perchlorate among healthy sub-\njects, in order to observe initial effects associated with\nTH perturbation. In general, plasma concentrations of\nHDL as a measure of HDL functionality depends on\nhealth status.32 The atheroprotective characteristics\nof HDL are based on the reverse cholesterol trans-\nport mechanism (RCT), inhibition of LDL oxidation,\nand anti-inflammatory \nproperties. In susceptible sub-\njects, HDL may become dysfunctional, lose its RCT\npromoting and antioxidant characteristics, and even\nbecome pro-inflammatory. In the current study, sub-\njects with previous chronic diseases were excluded\nfrom the analyses.Therefore, the observed association\nbetween urinary perchlorate and HDL among men in\nthis relatively healthy \nsubpopulation may reflect an\nTable 4B.

These women seemed to\nbe largely unaffected by perchlorate in contrast to the\nyounger women. However, this assumption may be\nincorrect. A large percentage of the women in this age\ngroup was excluded from the study (56%, 214 out of\n382), because of previous diseases or because they\nwere prescribed thyroid hormones, with the result\nthat the 50\u00ad85 year old women remaining in the study\nwere generally healthy. In comparison, the following\npercentages were excluded from the other groups:\nComparison of the non-pregnant women of repro-\nductive age and the pregnant women based on the\nunadjusted data (Table 3) showed that with regard\nto HGB and HCT, the non-pregnant women showed\na U-shaped pattern based on perchlorate quintiles,\nwhile the pregnant women showed a more linear\ndecreasing association. Before one can conclude that\nperchlorate is adversely associated with HGB and\nHCT among pregnant women, the following informa-\ntion should be considered. It has been shown that both\nhigh and low maternal HGB is associated with poor\npregnancy outcomes, such as increased rates of pre-\nterm births and stillbirths. The optimal values of this\nU-shaped pattern of HGB among pregnant women\nwith regard to adverse birth outcomes, is represented\nby the bottom part of the \"U\", with a reported range\nof 9\u00ad11 g/dL for the lowest maternal HGB recorded\nduring the pregnancy, and a range of 11\u00ad13 g/dL for\nthe first recorded HGB value in another study.33,34 This\ndecrease in HGB is thought to be due to a healthy\nplasma volume expansion associated with pregnancy.\nTherefore, interpretation of the decreasing HGB val-\nues among pregnant women associated with perchlo-\nrate becomes more complicated. A larger study group\nof pregnant women is needed to solve the question\nif perchlorate exposure is associated with enhance-\nment of the plasma volume expansion (non-adverse\neffect), or with decreased erythropoiesis (adverse\neffect). A recent study involving pregnant women\nonly, observed that perchlorate exposure did not affect\nthyroid hormones in either euthyroid or hypothyroid\nwomen.35 An editorial on the impact of perchlorate\nexposure during early pregnancy speculated that per-\nchlorate may have more subtle effects than changes\nof maternal thyroid hormones, or may have an effect\non the fetus without having an effect on maternal thy-\nResults from the regression analyses showed\nthat use of a continuous exposure variable, such as\nlog-transformed urinary perchlorate, which repre-\nsents the average population response, can be mis-\nleading when the association is nonlinear. Nonlinear\nresponses associated with low-dose exposures are a\nTable 5.

The initial\nreceptor-mediated responses are linear at low satura-\ntion or occupation of the receptors. With increasing\nexposure, ie, higher receptor saturation, the effects\nweaken. No effect may be observed at the highest\nexposures. This may lead to a U- or inverted U-shaped\nresponse curve.37 Such nonlinear responses can be\nquantified by including a quadratic term for the expo-\nsure in the regression. This allows for an increase/\ndecrease of the response followed by a decrease/\nincrease at higher exposures. However, a regression\nmodel using exposure quantiles is easier to interpret\nand has been used in other studies. For example, an\nobservational study on the association of perfluorooc-\ntanoic acid on thyroid disease showed that responses\nwere not necessarily linear for increasing quartiles\nof the exposure variable.38 A nonlinear association\nwas observed between persistent organic pollutants\n(POPs) and type-2 diabetes.39 In this study, the second\nsextile of the combined POPs showed the strongest\n\nassociation. To measure the response occurring at low\nlevels of exposure, the referent group should be based\non non-exposed subjects or subjects with very low\nlevels of exposure. The choice of quantiles depends on\nthe size of the study population. In the current study,\nfor example, an association of HDL with perchlorate\namong men, ages 20\u00ad85 was observed in the non-\n\nadjusted data (Table 3), where a decrease in HDL was\nobserved in the second and third quintiles, followed\nby an increase in the fourth and fifth quintiles. The\na similar pattern with stronger decreases in the 2nd\nfollowed by weaker associations in the 4th and 5th\nquintiles. Combining the 2nd and 3rd quintiles pro-\nduced statistical significance compared to the lowest\nquintile. No such association was observed when the\nlowest quartile instead of quintile was used as the\nreferent.\nConclusions\nThis cross-sectional study has generated hypotheses\nfor mechanistic studies on the effects of perchlorate\nexposure. Its results indicate that adverse effects\nassociated with perchlorate may be underestimated\nwhen only circulating levels of TH (direct measures)\nare considered. Additional use of indirect biomarkers,\nsuch as HDL, HGB, and HCT, may contribute to a\nmore complete picture of initial biological responses\nto perchlorate. Future studies need to confirm these\nresults in healthy subjects. The effects seen for preg-\nnant women should be investigated in a larger dataset.\nIn addition, use of these indirect biomarkers associ-\nated with perchlorate, should be studied in already\ncompromised subjects.\nAbbreviations\nBMI, Body mass index; CDC, Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention; CI, confidence interval;\nCRP, C-reactive protein; HCT, hematocrit; HDL,\nhigh density lipoprotein; HGB, hemoglobin; IRB,\nInstitutional Review Board; NHANES, National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey; POP,\npersistent organic pollutants; RCT, reverse cholesterol\ntransport mechanism; TH, thyroid hormones; TSH,\nthyroid stimulating hormone; T4, thyroxine.\n"
