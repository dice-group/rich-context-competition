    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: An examination of where in the income distribution income is most strongly associated\nwith risk of mortality will provide guidance for identifying the most critical pathways underlying the\nconnections between income and mortality, and may help to inform public health interventions to reduce\nsocioeconomic disparities. Prior studies have suggested stronger associations at the lower end of the\nincome distribution, but these studies did not have detailed categories of income, were unable to exclude\nindividuals whose declining health may affect their income and did not use methods to determine exact\nthreshold points of non-linearity. The purpose of this study is to describe the non-linear risks of all-cause\nand cause-specific mortality across the income distribution.\nMethods: We examined potential non-linear risk of mortality by family income level in a population that\nhad not retired early, changed jobs, or changed to part-time work due to health reasons, in order to\nminimize the effects of illness on income. We used data from the US National Health and Nutrition\nmortality was examined using proportional hazard models with penalized regression splines in order to\nallow for non-linear associations between mortality risk and income, controlling for age, race/ethnicity,\nmarital status, level of educational attainment and occupational category.\nResults: We observed significant non-linear risks of all-cause mortality, as well as for certain specific\ncauses of death at different levels of income. Typically, risk of mortality decreased with increasing income\nlevels only among persons whose family income was below the median; above this level, there was little\ndecreasing risk of mortality with higher levels of income. There was also some variation in mortality risk\nat different levels of income by cause and gender.\nConclusion: The majority of the income associated mortality risk in individuals between the ages of 18\u00ad\n77 in the United States is among the population whose family income is below the median (equal to\ngreatest impact if focused on this population.\n\u00a9 2008 Rehkopf et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBackground\nDespite longstanding knowledge of an inverse association\nbetween income and mortality in the United States [1,2]\nand calls to reduce socioeconomic gradients in health [3],\nfew studies have examined whether the higher risk of\nmortality at lower incomes is uniform across the income\ndistribution or whether threshold points exist in this asso-\nciation. Several studies from the UK and Scandinavia sug-\ngest that a threshold point does not exist in the\nassociation between social class and mortality [4-6], and\nthis has been used to inform policy for reducing health\ndisparities worldwide [7]. A linear risk of mortality across\nthe income distribution implies that there are etiologic\npathways from income to mortality for all individuals,\nregardless of income level. Conversely, studies from the\nUS and New Zealand have found primarily non-linear\nassociations between income and mortality [8-10]. If the\nassociation is non-linear and the income-mortality gradi-\nent exists mainly at lower income levels, research to\nunderstand income differences in health should be\namong this population. In addition to guiding etiologic\nresearch of income-mortality associations, the shape of\nassociation has implications for efforts to reduce income-\nbased disparities: either providing evidence in support of\ntargeting the full population (if a linear association) or\nevidence for support of policies focused on the popula-\ntion where such associations are found to exist.\nWithin the US, only two studies have explicitly examined\nthe shape of the relationship between income and mortal-\nity [9,10] and both found suggestive evidence of non-lin-\near associations, with a higher level of income more\nstrongly associated with increased mortality at the lower\nend of the income distribution. These studies were lim-\nited, however, by: (1) a lack of access to finely-measured\nincome data (thus unable to determine if threshold points\nexist in the risk of mortality); (2) an inability to exclude\npersons whose declining health status may have reduced\ntheir income level [11], and (3) methods that did not\nallow for the testing of statistically significant non-linear\nassociations and threshold points in change in mortality\nrisk.\nThe aim of this paper is to describe the shape of the\nincome and all-cause and cause-specific mortality associ-\nations among US adults age 18 to 64 at baseline (who\nwere age 25\u00ad77 by the end of follow-up). We examined\nthe association of income and mortality, restricting our\nanalysis only to those individuals who were free from\nhealth conditions that caused them to change jobs,\nchange to part time work, or retire early due to health rea-\nsons. By using data with a large number of income catego-\nries and by modelling the association without using a pre-\nspecified functional form or pre-specified inflection\npoints we are able to more accurately estimate the shape\nof the income and cause-specific mortality associations.\nWe also compare the fit of models with baseline covari-\nates and either a linear income term, a log-income term,\nor a smoothed spline income term in order to determine\nwhich income-mortality model provides the best fit to the\ndata.\nMethods\nThe US Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nrepresentative of the non-institutionalized population of\nthe U.S. when analyzed using weights to account for over-\nsampling and non-response [12]. Our analysis used data\nfrom the National Death Index (NDI), for deaths through\nlength of follow up of up to 13 years. The NDI is a well\ndocumented and validated method of matching deaths in\nthe United States to population datasets [13,14]. The def-\ninition of cause of death has been validated to have a dis-\ncrepancy rate of approximately 5% [15]. Only NHANES\nIII participants at least 18 years of age at the time of inter-\nview were eligible for follow-up, and we limited our anal-\nyses to individuals that were under the age of 65 at\nbaseline (n = 14,798) (individuals missing at the time of\nfollow up (0.3%) were excluded). We excluded the fol-\nlowing individuals to minimize causation from health to\nincome: individuals who self-reported that they \"changed\npermanently to an easier job,\" \"changed temporarily to an\neasier job,\" \"cut down to part-time work only,\" \"have to\nstop working for a few months,\" or \"retire because of a\ndisability,\" for the reason of \"a disability or health prob-\nlems\" (10%) [16]. We also excluded individuals who died\nafter one year or less of follow up (0.3%), as illness in the\nyear prior to death may have reduced family income. Indi-\nviduals who were missing income (7%), education\n(0.05%) or occupation (1%) were also excluded. The sum\nof these exclusions resulted in a final analytic sample of\ndeaths (table 1).\nWe examined all-cause mortality and three cause-specific\ncategories of adult mortality as defined by the following\nTotal combined pre-tax family income for the 12 months\nprior to the survey included wages, salaries, income from\nself-employment, veteran's benefits, interest dividends,\nrental income and public assistance. Family income data\nwere available in 28 income categories (none, less than\ngreater than $50,000). Income from each half of the sur-\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nlars using the Urban Consumer Price Index. For all\nanalyses we used the midpoint of each income category\nand calculated the mid-point of the upper category of\nincome ($66,800) by assuming a Pareto distribution of\nfamily income per standard methodology [17]. Income\n(as well as reference points of median income and poverty\nline) is made equivalent for economies of scale by divid-\ning family income by the square root of family size. In this\nstudy we conceptualize income as a measure of the level\nof earnings of a household at a particular point in time, a\nvalue that has been empirically shown to have a strong\nassociation with lifetime earnings[18]\nAdditional covariates included: (a) education (0\u00ad17 or\nmore years), (b) race/ethnicity (using the available catego-\nries of white non-Hispanic, Hispanic, black, other), (c)\nage (in years), and (d) occupation, referring to the longest\nheld occupation, divided into 5 categories: (1): white col-\nlar and professional (e.g. executive, management, profes-\nsional, supervisors); (2): white collar, semi-routine (e.g.\ntechnicians, sales workers, secretaries); (3): blue collar,\nhigh skill (e.g. mechanics, construction trades, military);\n(4): blue collar, semi-routine (e.g. personal services, wait-\ners and waitresses, food preparation, farm workers, motor\nvehicle operators); and (5): never worked. Detailed\nNHANES III occupational categories were used to create\nthis variable [see Additional file 1]. Labor force participa-\ntion was defined as working at a job or business or having\npercent std error percent std error\nAge\nGender\nRace/ethnicity\nMarital status\nEducation\nOccupation\nIncome (equivalized for family size)\nWork and health\n*median income is equal to 322% of the poverty line\n(page number not for citation purposes)\na job or business within the last two weeks, not including\nwork around the house.\nIn order to be consistent with prior work on the shape of\nthe association of income and mortality [6,8,9] we mod-\nelled mortality for women and men separately. The three\nmodels that we present include the following covariates:\nmodel 1) income, age, race/ethnicity, marital status,\nmodel 2) income, age, race/ethnicity, marital status, edu-\ncation, occupation, model 3) income, age, race/ethnicity,\nmarital status, education, occupation, labor force partici-\npation. The estimated income coefficient from model 1 is\nnot conditional on other measures of socioeconomic\nposition, and thus may not adequately control for con-\nfounding of the income-mortality association. The esti-\nmated income coefficient from model 2 is conditional on\nother measures of socioeconomic position (i.e. education\nand occupation), and is the primary model for inference\nand for which associations are shown in the figures.\nModel 3 additionally controls for current labor force par-\nticipation, as this may confound the association of\nincome and mortality, but may also be on the causal path-\nway between income and mortality and thus should not\nbe included as a control variable [8].\nThe income and cause-specific mortality associations were\nmodelled with penalized splines (with a cubic basis) in\nproportional hazard survival models in order to allow for\npossible non-linear dependence of mortality hazard on\nincome (as well as for education when included as a cov-\nariate)[19,20]. We use age as the time-scale of the baseline\nhazard rather than time-on-study as this allows for less\nbiased model estimates with respect to age, and allows for\nnon-linear associations between age and mortality\n[21,22]. Penalized splines model the association by fitting\na large number of regression splines joined at evenly\nspaced knots, with a penalty on coefficients of adjacent\nknots [23]. The starting point for the model fitting proce-\ndure is to fit a saturated model of a large number of\nsplines, and then to penalize the fit based on a smoothing\nparameter (theta) to adjust the penalty term to avoid over\nfitting the data. Prior work has shown that by using this\nmethod smoothed estimates of survival are insensitive to\nthe number and location of knots [23]. Theta can vary\nbetween 0 and 1, where 0 is close to an exact fit to the\ndata, and 1 is a straight line. The initial values of theta\nwere chosen by generalized cross validation \u00ad an auto-\nmated model fitting procedure where the optimal value of\ntheta is determined by repeatedly fitting the model on\nrandom subsets of the data and then testing how well the\nmodel predicts the data that was not used to create the\nmodel [20]. Based on subject matter knowledge, we then\nincreased the thetas to be slightly closer to 1 (a more con-\nservative model) to avoid models that overfit the data,\nalthough fit was very similar in both sets of models\n(model fit from the theta chosen by generalized cross val-\nidation results available from the authors). All models we\npresent are thus more conservative models for identifying\nnon-linearity then those selected by generalized cross-val-\nidation.\nWe first present the unadjusted incidence rates of all-cause\nmortality by gender and income (table 2). We then\npresent the Chi-square statistics and associated two-sided\np-values from adjusted spline models in order to allow for\nassessment of the degree of difference in spline slopes for\nincome parameters, values that may be interpreted as tests\nof non-linearity (table 3) [20]. We also present likelihood\nratio tests comparing fitted models with a spline term to:\n1) models controlling for baseline covariates, 2) models\ncontrolling for baseline covariates and a linear income\nterm, and 3) models controlling for baseline covariates\nand log transformation of income (table 4). A likelihood\nratio test comparing each fitted model to a null model is\nused to determine overall model fit. The null hypothesis\nfor this comparison is no difference in model fit, therefore\np-values of less than 0.05 reject the null hypothesis and\nindicate that the fitted model is a better description of the\ndata. Due to the different degrees of freedom in each of\nthe models, it is most appropriate to compare p-values\nTable 2: Unadjusted all-cause mortality rates by category of family equivalized income, healthy restricted population, ages 18\u00ad64,\nWomen Men\nincome\nrange\n(US dollars)\nperson-years\nperson-years\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nacross models to evaluate relative model fit.

There were no substan-\ntial differences in the distribution of population character-\nistics between the full population and restricted samples,\nalthough there were slightly fewer individuals in the 45\u00ad\n64 age category in the restricted sample. Twenty-two per-\ncent had incomes below 50% of the median U.S. family\nsize adjusted income (in this population, equivalent to\n$10,090), a level commonly used to define economic\ndeprivation [28]. There were substantially fewer individu-\nals not currently in the labor force in the restricted analytic\nsample.\nIncome and all-cause mortality\nTable 2 shows the unadjusted all-cause mortality rates\n(and 95% confidence intervals) by category of family\nequivalized income. Mortality rates are substantially\nhigher among women and men in households with less\nthere is also an elevated rate of mortality in the $25,000-\nconsistent across other income categories above $10,000\na year.\nFigure 1 shows the smoothed hazard ratios (Y-axis) of all-\ncause mortality for women and men by level of equival-\nized family income (X-axis), for the population aged 18\u00ad\n64 at baseline.

A hazard ratio of 1 is equivalent to the average risk of mor-\ntality across the income distribution.

Because of the small number of events\namong the 8% of individuals with equivalized family\nincome above $50,000, we have omitted from the plots\nthe point estimate and confidence intervals above this\nlevel, even though we included these individuals in all\nanalyses.\nFor all-cause mortality (Figure 1), among both women\nand men risk of mortality decreased with increasing\nincome until near the median income level; and above\nthis level, we observed no decreasing mortality hazard\nwith income. Chi-square tests for the statistical signifi-\ncance of the non-linear associations between income and\nmortality hazard are given in table 3. The Chi-square test\nstatistic, degrees of freedom (df) and p-value are shown\nfor the associations in figure 1 (Model 2) as well as for\nmodels controlling only for age, marital status and race/\nethnicity (Model 1), and for models additionally control-\nling for labor force participation (Model 3). In all models\n(except model 1 for heart disease among women) the Chi-\nsquare test for a non-linear association of income with\nmortality was significant at the alpha = 0.05 level (Table\nIncome and cause-specific mortality\nFor cause-specific mortality (Figure 2), risk of death due to\nheart disease among women showed a similar pattern as\nwas observed for all-cause mortality, where the income-\nmortality association was strongest below median\nincome. For men, the risk of mortality decreased in a gen-\nerally linear pattern. For death due to cancer, women and\nmen exhibited different non-linear risk with income.\nAmong persons below median family income, risk of\nmortality due to cancer declined slightly with higher levels\nof income for women and men. Among persons above\nmedian family income, risk was not associated with\nincome among the men, but increased among women.\nLastly, for death due to injury, risk decreased most\nstrongly below median income, with some further\ndecrease in risk above this point among women but not\namong men.\nAlternative models of income and mortality\nWe repeated the analyses shown in Figures 1 and 2 both\nnot controlling for occupational category and years of\neducation (Model 1) and additionally controlling for\nlabor force participation (Model 3) and obtained similar\nresults (Table 3). Among women and men, all-cause mor-\ntality remained significantly associated with income in a\nnon-linear manner for all outcomes in all three models.\nWe also examined the extent to which specifying a non-\nlinear functional form of income improved the overall\nmodel fit for prediction of mortality as compared to: 1)\nbaseline covariates and no income variable; 2) baseline\ncovariates and a linear income variable; or 3) baseline\ncovariates and a log transformation of income. We did so\nby comparing the likelihood ratios of each model, taking\ninto account increased degrees of freedom of income and\nthe non-linear income models (Table 4). A lower p-value\nrepresents a stronger rejection of the null hypothesis of no\ndifference between a null model with no predictors and\nthe full models. For all-cause mortality (among women\nand men) and injury (among men) the models with non-\nlinear income are the best fit to the data. For heart disease\n(among men and women), cancer (among men) and\ninjury (among women) a non-linear income model is an\nequally good fit to the data as a linear income model\n(heart disease), a linear or log income term (cancer among\nmen), or any of the other models for injury among\nwomen.\nDiscussion\nAmong US women and men age 18 to 64 at baseline, with\nfollow-up of up to 13 years, we found evidence of a gen-\nerally stronger associations of income with all-cause mor-\ntality at the lower end of the income distribution, i.e.,\nunder median income. Similar patterns occurred for\ndeaths due to cancer and injury; by contrast, a more linear\nassociation across the full income range was evident for\ndeath due to heart disease. These results are unlikely to be\nsubstantially driven by contemporaneous effects of illness\non income because of the restrictions of our sample to\nindividuals with more than one year of follow up who\nhad not ever changed jobs, changed to part-time work, or\nretired early due to health reasons. In fact, our results are\nlikely a conservative estimate of the association due to the\npotential effects of income on illness, given that we\nrestricted our analysis to a healthy sample that has not left\nthe labor force due to health reasons.\nOur results for all-cause mortality are generally consistent\nwith the previously reported logarithmic functional form\nof association with income [9,10]. However, our results\nexpand on this observation in three important ways. First,\nwe find that the shape of association varies by type of\nmortality. Second, based on the overall fit of models with\neither a log function of income or a non-linear function of\nincome, the appropriateness of a log function for model-\nling income and mortality holds most closely for only\ncancer mortality among men and injury mortality among\nwomen. Third, based on visual inspection of the plotted\nincome-mortality hazard ratios we identify median\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nand race/ethnicity, marital status, occupational category and education (and income is adjusted for family size), and the popula-\ntion is restricted to individuals who did not die within one year of follow-up, retire early due to health reasons, change jobs\ndue to health reasons, or change to part-time work due to health reasons. A hazard ratio of 1 is equivalent to the average risk\nof mortality across the income distribution. The labels of income level (in 1991 dollars) on the X-axis denote the family size\nequivalized US poverty line ($6,270) and the US equivalized median income ($20,190) as external standards of comparison.\nDashed lines show 95% confidence intervals of the hazard ratio.\nhazard ratio\nwomen\nheart disease\nhazard ratio\nmen\nheart disease\nhazard ratio\ncancer\nhazard ratio\ncancer\nhazard ratio\ninjury\nhazard ratio\ninjury\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nincome level as a critical point of inflection for outcomes\nwhere substantial non-linear associations were found.\nThese results should be considered within the context of\nseveral study limitations. First, the data we used lack spe-\ncific income categories above $50,000 a year, which limits\nour understanding of the impacts of income for the 8% of\nfamilies that had the highest equivalized income. Our\nestimates at the upper end of the income distribution are\nless precise, as indicated by the widening confidence inter-\nvals in the plots, and the point estimates in these regions\nshould be interpreted cautiously. A second limitation of\nthis analysis is that income is measured at only one point\nin time, thus not capturing household income dynamics\nthat influence health outcomes [29-31]. This also results\nin a potential mismatch between income and social class\nrelated exposures and the relevant time periods for disease\netiology. However, as income level of households are cor-\nrelated across time, a recent measure of income does cap-\nture an important aspect of households' socioeconomic\nposition [30], and one that is strongly correlated with per-\nmanent income. A third limitation is that as with any non-\nexperimental study the associations observed may be due\nto residual confounding rather than a causal relationship\nbetween income and mortality. For example, we lack\ninformation on wealth and debt, additional markers of\nsocioeconomic position that have been demonstrated to\naffect health [28,32]. This may result in some residual\nconfounding by social class that may contribute to bias in\nour estimates of the associations between income level\nand mortality risk [33].\nBased on a qualitative inspection of the smoothed plots of\nthe income-mortality association, and the overall tests of\nmodel fit, we have shown that a non-linear association\nwith a stronger association below median income is the\nmost prevalent pattern of association. There were however\nvariations in this association by cause and by gender. For\nheart disease, in particular among men, there appears to\nbe less of a threshold at median income. While this may\nbe due to mortality risk for heart disease more evenly dis-\ntributed across the income distribution, an alternative\nexplanation is that we have limited power to detect the\nshape of the association due to a relatively small number\nof heart disease events above median income (as confi-\ndence intervals indicate). Supporting this later specula-\ntion is prior work examining a two slope model of income\nand cardiovascular mortality that has shown there is a\nstronger association at lower income levels [10].\nWhile significant associations were observed for both men\nand women, and the shape of the relation was similar for\nall-cause, heart disease and injury mortality, there were\ndifferent associations observed among women and men\nfor cancer above median income \u00ad no association for\nmen, and a slightly increasing association among women.\nTests of overall model fit showed that while a linear or\nlogarithmic model of income was an equally good fit to\nthe data among men, a non-linear model was a better fit\namong women. This difference may be due to the positive\nassociation between socioeconomic position and rates of\nbreast cancer mortality in women that does not exist as\nstrongly for any site of cancer in men [34,35]. These differ-\ning results by cause and gender are consistent with the\ncontext-, time-, and cause-contingent nature of social gra-\ndients; empirical findings indicate that income-mortality\nassociations are not fixed, but rather vary across cultures\nOur results are generally consistent with the two other US\nstudies that examined the shape of the income-mortality\nassociation [9,10], despite the fact that these studies were\nnot able to eliminate individuals who had health prob-\nlems that may have effected their income. While our\nresults not adjusting for labor force partipation are similar\nto those observed by Blakely et al. in New Zealand, this\nstudy finds that after adjusting for labor force participa-\ntion the association of mortality with income is markedly\nattenuated, in contrast with our findings [8]. This may be\ndue to our restricted healthy sample, our non-linear\nmethod of analysis, or due to stronger effects of labor\nforce participation on mortality in New Zealand as com-\npared to the United States. Our finding of a non-linear\nshape of association contrast with findings from Finland,\nwhere Martikainen et al report a linear shape of associa-\ntion between income and mortality [6]. While this may be\ndue to differing access to benefits and social services in the\nU.S. and Finland, Blakely et al. note that if an absolute\nlevel of income was used to assess the shape of the associ-\nation, the results of Martikainen et al are consistent with a\nflattening of risk at upper income levels[8]\nThe results presented have implications for understanding\nthe etiological links between income and mortality. Based\non the observed associations, income disparities in mor-\ntality chiefly among lower income populations (below\nthe median income) appear to be driving the commonly\nreported socioeconomic gradients in all-cause, cancer\namong men and injury mortality. These findings also\nunderscore why efforts to address income disparities in\nmortality cannot be restricted simply to persons below the\nUS poverty line but instead should include persons with\nincome at least up to the median level. The difference in\nsize of these two populations is large: in 1991, the mid-\npoint of the income data collection, 13% of families in the\nU.S. were below the poverty line (equal to $10,860 for a\nthree person family) as compared to 50% of families\nbelow the median family income (equal to $35,940), an\nabsolute difference of 37% of US families, and similar to\nwhat we have in our study population (Table 1). While\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nanti-poverty policies and programs that include individu-\ncommon (185% of the poverty level is equivalent to\n$20,090 for a family of three), the additional population\nbetween the 185% poverty level and median income,\nequivalent to approximately 22% of US families, consti-\ntute a large segment of the population that potentially is\nnot benefiting from efforts to reduce health and economic\ndisparities. Suggesting this could be done, benefits from\nthe earned income credit, which specifically address\nincome disparities, reach beyond 185% of the poverty\nConclusion\nIn the US context, in adults aged 18\u00ad64 at baseline, the\nnon-linear risk of mortality with income arises from the\nstronger relationship between income level and mortality\namong lower compared to higher income populations.\nThis evidence is supportive of the hypothesis that policies\nto improve the health of individuals among the lower half\nof the income distribution will have the most impact on\nreducing US income-based disparities in mortality,\nalthough from our data we cannot establish why this asso-\nciation exists. Second, if the associations presented are not\ndue to residual confounding, measurement error, or unac-\ncounted for reverse causation, they may also have impli-\ncations for the importance of income in contributing to\npremature mortality. Future studies determining the path-\nways connecting income and mortality will benefit from a\nconsideration of where in the income distribution the\nburden of disparity exists, and that this association varies\nby cause.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nDHR designed the study, conducted the analysis, and lead\nthe writing of all sections of the manuscript.
