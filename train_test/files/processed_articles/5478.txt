    "abstract": "Abstract\nCurrent participatory research literature describes different approaches to involving service\nusers in research, draws out lessons to be learned from the process and begins to address\nthe difficult question of the impact of service user involvement on the research outcomes.\nHowever, very limited attention has been given to analysing in detail `what goes on' in interviews\ncarried out by service users or considering what difference their interactions make to the\ninterview content and process. This article draws on principles of conversation analysis (CA)\nand member categorisation analysis (MCA) to examine how co-researchers and participants\npractically accomplish research interviews. Using Habermas's distinction between communicative\nand strategic action as a framework, the article addresses the questions of whether and how\nco-researchers open communicative space in semi-structured interviews. Two dimensions are\nhighlighted in the analysis: co-researchers' interviewing skills and their ability to forge connections\nwith participants. It is concluded that both components are necessary to open communicative\nspace and generate co-produced knowledge. This detailed empirically-grounded analysis of co-\nresearcher/participant interactions is both innovative and significant in enhancing understanding\nof co-researcher contributions to participatory research.\n",

Participatory research (PR)\nacknowledges the right of service users to contribute to defining `truth' and generating\n`knowledge' (Cornwall and Jewkes, 1995). `Service users' here refers to people who\nCorresponding author:\nDenise Tanner, Senior Lecturer in Social Work, Department of Social Work and Social Care, University of\nBirmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.\nEmail: d.l.tanner@bham.ac.uk\nArticle\ndefine themselves as actual or potential users of the same or similar services to those\nbeing studied. In addition to moral arguments about the rights of service users to exercise\npower in relation to knowledge claims, the epistemological argument is that service user\ninvolvement in research enhances the knowledge produced through this process (Bergold\nMany funders of health and social research now require the involvement of service\nusers and it is increasingly common for this to be incorporated and costed in research\nbids. However, the nature and level of involvement vary widely, from acting in an advi-\nsory capacity or assisting with data collection to involvement in all stages of the process.\nThe benefits and challenges of service user involvement in health and social care research\nare well-rehearsed, both in reports from individual studies (such as Miller et al., 2006)\nnormative desirability of co-production as a buzzword often crowds out a balanced\nassessment of the risks and limits involved when it is \"done\" in practice'. Critics suggest\nthat, far from increasing service user power and influence, PR may represent `a different\n\u00ad and most probably more sophisticated \u00ad type of exploitation' (Carey, 2010: 17), co-\nopting service users into supporting dominant agendas whilst leaving oppressive policies\nand practices unchallenged (Cowden and Singh, 2007).\nEven advocates of service user involvement acknowledge that to do it well, both ethi-\ncally and practically, is costly of time and resources. From varied perspectives, there is\ntherefore recognition that the nature and outcomes of PR need to be given closer and\narticle makes an innovative and significant contribution to the evidence base about the\nimpact of PR through detailed empirical analysis of co-researchers' interactions in\nresearch interviews. The term `co-research' is used here to mean research `done with'\nservice users rather than `to', `about' or `for' them (Fudge et al., 2007). Co-researchers\nare viewed as `co' (that is, joint or mutual) in two senses: working in partnership with\nacademic researchers to generate knowledge and sharing key characteristics with\nparticipants.\nThere is "
