Because the intensity and quality of treatment have\noften been poor in earlier studies,36-38 we also examine\nmedian numbers of visits and proportions receiving mini-\nmally adequate treatment concordant with evidence-\nbased guidelines. Finally, we examine sociodemo-\ngraphic correlates of treatment and treatment adequacy.\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nThe NCS-R is a nationally representative household survey of\nrespondents 18 years and older in the coterminous United\nincluded a core diagnostic assessment administered to all re-\nspondents. Part 2 assessed risk factors, correlates, service use,\nand additional disorders, and was administered to all part 1 re-\nspondents with lifetime disorders plus a probability subsample\nof other respondents. The overall response rate was 70.9%. The\nNCS-R recruitment, consent, and field procedures were ap-\nproved by the Human Subjects Committees of Harvard Medical\nSchool and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\nMEASURES\nDiagnostic Assessment\nof 12-Month Mental Disorders\nDSM-IV diagnoses were made using the World Health Organi-\nzation's World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative version\nof the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI),41 a\nfully structured lay-administered diagnostic interview that gen-\nerates International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-\nders considered herein include mood (bipolar I and II disorders,\nmajor depressive disorder, and dysthymia), anxiety (panic dis-\norder, agoraphobia without panic, specific phobia, social pho-\nbia, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disor-\nder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and separation anxiety\ndisorder), impulse control (intermittent explosive disorder), and\nsubstance (alcohol and other drug abuse and dependence) dis-\norders. All diagnoses are considered with organic exclusions and\ndiagnostic hierarchy rules, with the exception of the substance\ndisorders, for which abuse is defined with or without depen-\ndence. Blind clinical reappraisals using the Structured Clinical\nInterview for DSM-IV39,44 showed generally good concordance\nbetween WMH CIDI lifetime diagnoses and the Structured Clini-\ncal Interview for DSM-IV for anxiety, mood, and substance dis-\norders. The WMH CIDI lifetime diagnoses of impulse control\ndisorders have not been validated, and evaluation of WMH CIDI\n12-month diagnoses is ongoing.\nTwelve-Month Use of Mental Health Services\nAll part 2 respondents were asked whether they ever received\ntreatment for \"problems with your emotions or nerves or your\nuse of alcohol or drugs.\" A list of types of treatment providers\nwas presented in a respondent booklet to provide a visual recall\naid. The list of professionals included was as follows: a psychia-\ntrist, a general practitioner or family physician, any other phy-\nsician(eg,cardiologist,gynecologist,orurologist),asocialworker,\na counselor, any other mental health professional (eg, a psycho-\ntherapist or a mental health nurse), a religious or spiritual ad-\nvisor (eg, a minister, priest, or rabbi), or any other healer (eg, a\nchiropractor, herbalist, or spiritualist). Separate assessments were\nmade for different types of professionals, support groups, self-\nhelp groups, mental health crisis hotlines (assumed to be visits\nwith nonpsychiatrist mental health specialists), CAM thera-\npies, and use of other treatment settings, including admissions\nto hospitals and other facilities (each day of admission was as-\nsumed to include a visit with a psychiatrist). Follow-up ques-\ntions asked about age at first and most recent contacts and num-\nber and duration of visits in the past 12 months.\nReports of 12-month service use were classified into the fol-\nlowingcategories:psychiatrist,nonpsychiatristmentalhealthspe-\ncialist (psychologist or other nonpsychiatrist mental health pro-\nfessionalinanysetting,socialworkerorcounselorinamentalhealth\nspecialty [MHS] setting, or use of a mental health hotline), gen-\neral medical (GM) provider (primary care physician, other gen-\neralphysician,nurse,oranyotherhealthcareprofessionalnotpre-\nviouslymentioned),humanservices(HS)professional(religious\nor spiritual advisor or social worker or counselor in any setting\notherthanaspecialtymentalhealthsetting),andCAMprofessional\n(any other type of healer, such as a chiropractor, participation in\nan Internet support group, or participation in a self-help group).\nPsychiatrist and nonpsychiatrist specialist categories were com-\nbinedintoabroaderMHScategory;MHSwasalsocombinedwith\nGMintoanevenbroaderHCcategory.HumanservicesandCAM\nwere also combined into a non-HC category.\nMinimally Adequate Treatment\nMinimally adequate treatment was defined based on available\nevidence-based guidelines24-29 as receiving either pharmaco-\ntherapy (2 months of an appropriate medication for the fo-\ncal disorder plus 4 visits to any type of physician) or psy-\nchotherapy (8 visits with any HC or HS professional lasting\nan average of 30 minutes). The decision to require 4 or more\nphysician visits for pharmacotherapy was based on the fact that\n4 or more visits for medication evaluation, initiation, and moni-\ntoring are generally recommended during the acute and con-\ntinuation phases of treatment in available guidelines.20-25 Ap-\npropriate medications for disorders included antidepressants\nfor depressive disorders, mood stabilizers or antipsychotic agents\nfor bipolar disorders, antidepressants or anxiolytic agents for\nanxiety disorders, antagonists or agonists (disulfiram, naltrex-\n\u00a92005 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\none, or methadone hydrochloride) for alcohol and other sub-\nstance disorders, and any psychiatric drug for impulse control\ndisorders.9 At least 8 sessions were required for minimally ad-\nequate psychotherapy based on the fact that clinical trials dem-\nonstrating effectiveness have generally included 8 psycho-\ntherapy visits or more.20-25 For alcohol and other substance\ndisorders, self-help visits of any duration were counted as psy-\nchotherapy visits. Treatment adequacy was defined separately\nfor each 12-month disorder (ie, a respondent with comorbid\ndisorders could be classified as receiving minimally adequate\ntreatment for one disorder but not for another).\nRespondents who began treatments shortly before the NCS-R\ninterview may not have had time to fulfill requirements, even\nthough they were in the early stages of adequate treatment. Fur-\nthermore, brief treatments have been developed for certain dis-\norders.45,46 We, therefore, created a broader definition of mini-\nmally adequate treatment for sensitivity analyses that consisted\nof receiving 2 or more visits to an appropriate treatment sector\n(1 visit for a presumptive examination/diagnosis and 1 visit\nfor treatment) or being in ongoing treatment at interview.\nSociodemographic Predictor Variables\nSociodemographic variables included cohort (defined by age\nyears), sex, race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, Hispanic, and other), completed years of education\ncohabitating, previously married, and never married), family\nincome in relation to the federal poverty line47 (categorized as\nlow [1.5 times the poverty line], low average [1.5-3 times\nthe poverty line], high average [3-6 times the poverty line],\nand high [6 times the poverty line]), urbanicity defined ac-\ncording to 2000 census definitions48 (large and smaller metro-\npolitan areas; central cities, suburbs, and adjacent areas; and\nrural areas), and health insurance coverage (including pri-\nvate, public, or military sources).\nThe NCS-R data were weighted to adjust for differences in prob-\nabilities of selection, differential nonresponse, residual differ-\nences between the sample and the US population, and over-\nsampling in the part 2 sample.39 Basic patterns of service use\nwere examined by computing proportions in treatment, mean\nand median numbers of visits among those in treatment, and\nprobabilities of treatments meeting the criteria for minimal ad-\nequacy. Logistic regression49 analysis was used to study socio-\ndemographic predictors of receiving any 12-month treatment\nin the total sample, treatment in particular sectors among those\nreceiving any treatment, and treatment meeting the criteria for\nminimal adequacy. Standard errors were estimated using the\nTaylor series method as implemented in a computer software\nprogram (SUDAAN).50 Multivariate significance tests in the lo-\ngistic regression analyses were made using Wald 2 tests based\non coefficient variance\u00adcovariance matrices that were ad-\njusted for design effects using the Taylor series method. Sta-\ntistical significance was evaluated using 2-sided design-based\ntests and the .05 level of significance.\nRESULTS\nOf the respondents, 17.9% used services in the prior year,\nincluding 41.1% of those with 12-month DSM-IV disor-\nders and 10.1% of those without them (Table 1) (Kessler\net al51 describe the prevalence of 12-month disorders in the\nNCS-R). The proportion of cases in treatment ranged from\na high for dysthymia to a low for intermittent explosive dis-\norder. Most treatments occurred in the HC sectors (15.3%\nof respondents, representing 85.5% of those in treatment)\nand, within the HC sectors, the GM sector (9.3% of re-\nspondents, representing 52.0% of those in treatment).\nThe median number of 12-month visits (Table 2) among\nthose receiving any treatment was 2.9, and was signifi-\ncantlyhigheramongthosewithdisordersthanamongthose\ndents with no disorder make up most of the population\n(74.6%), they account for nearly one third of all visits\n(33.2%) and visits to specific sectors. Within-sector me-\ndians ranged from a high for CAM to a low for GM.\nThe mean numbers of visits (data not shown, but avail-\nable from the authors) are consistently much higher than\nthe median. For example, the median among patients re-\nceiving any treatment was 2.9, compared with the mean\nof 14.7. Mean visits were significantly higher among pa-\ntients with a disorder (16.9) than among those without a\nlower for psychiatrist (7.5) and HS (7.1), and lowest for\nGM (2.6).

For example, although\nnearly60%ofpatientsseenbypsychiatristsmadefewerthan\n5 visits in the year, they accounted for only one sixth of all\nvisits to psychiatrists. Those making 50 or more visits to\npsychiatrists in the year, while representing only 1.6% of\nall patients seen by psychiatrists, accounted for 20.2% of\nall psychiatrist visits.

Probabilities of treatment being at least\nminimally adequate were highest in the MHS sectors and\nlowest in the GM sector.\nIn sensitivity analyses (data not shown, but available\nfrom the authors) using the broader definition of mini-\nmally adequate treatment (ie, receiving 2 visits to an ap-\npropriate sector or being in ongoing treatment at the time\nof interview), the percentage of patients receiving treat-\nment that was at least minimally adequate increased to\nand nonpsychiatrist specialty (51.1%) sectors, and lower\n\u00a92005 American Medical Association.

Finally, the\nadequacy of non-HC treatment seems to be highest among\npatients aged 18 to 29 years, males, and those married.\nCOMMENT\nThese results should be interpreted with the following\n5 limitations in mind. First, the NCS-R excludes people\nwhoarehomelessorinstitutionalized.Becausethesepeople\nmake up only a small proportion of the population, these\nresults apply to most of the population.

Given what we know about\nthe associations between true prevalence and these er-\nbeen underestimated.\nThird, without corroborating data on service use, we\ncannot study the validity of self-reported treatment use\nin the NCS-R. Recent studies56,57 of the Ontario Health\nSurvey suggest that self-reports of mental health service\nuse overestimate administrative treatment records, es-\npecially concerning the number of visits and among re-\nspondents with more distressing disorders. Unlike the\nOntario Health Survey, the NCS-R did attempt to mini-\nmize such inaccuracies by using commitment probes (ie,\nquestions designed to measure a subject's commitment\nto the survey) and excluding the few respondents (1%)\nwho failed to endorse that they would think carefully and\nanswer honestly. Nevertheless, potentially biased recall\nof mental health service use remains a limitation. To the\nextent that it occurred, our results are likely to under-\nestimate unmet need for treatment, especially among those\nwith more serious disorders.\nFourth, our definitions of minimally adequate treat-\nment may differ from others in use and, to our knowl-\nedge, their relationships with important clinical out-\ncomes have not been studied.

It is pos-\nsible that respondents with untreated or inadequately\ntreated disorders are disproportionately made up of mild\nor self-limiting cases. An evaluation of the relationship\nbetween disorder severity and treatment adequacy is an\nTable 2.

In-\ncreasing use of some modalities, most notably pharma-\ncotherapies and physician-administered psychothera-\nbeing treated much more effectively than in the past. Our\nresults suggest that such optimism is premature. Mental\nhealth service use remains disturbingly low, with most\npatients not receiving any care in the prior year. Among\nthe minority who receive services, not all are treated in\na HC sector. Even those who successfully access the HC\nsector often fail to get sufficient visits for clinical assess-\nments, delivery of treatments, and appropriate ongoing\nments meet minimal standards of adequacy based on evi-\ndence-based treatment guidelines,20-25 confirming re-\nThe frequent use of treatments with uncertain benefit\nis striking. This is especially worrisome for CAM treat-\nments, which account for 31.3% of all mental health vis-\nits despite a paucity of data supporting their effi-\nservices is to determine why CAM has such great appeal\nand whether legitimate aspects related to this appeal (eg,\na greater orientation to patient-centered care) can be\nadopted by conventional mental HC providers to in-\ncrease the attractiveness of evidence-based treatments.\nConversely, many services are being consumed by re-\nspondents without apparent disorders. Although respon-\ndents without disorders are less likely to receive treat-\nment or as many visits once in treatment as those with\ndisorders, they make up such a majority of the popula-\ntion that they account for nearly one third of all visits.\nSome services are undoubtedly being used appropri-\nately to treat active mental disorders not assessed in the\nNCS-R, to treat subthreshold symptoms, as secondary pre-\nvention of lifetime disorders, or even as primary preven-\ntion of disorders.66 However, given the profound unmet\nneed for mental health services among people with well-\ndefined mental disorders, the potential diversion of so\nmany treatment resources to individuals without men-\ntal disorders is concerning.67\nThe highly skewed distribution of visits, in which a\nfew patients account for most visits, implies that more\npeople with disorders could be effectively treated with\nexisting levels of resources through better allocation. It\nis less clear, though, how to develop a principled basis\nfor deciding what the optimal allocation of treatment re-\nsources should be or how the organization and financ-\ning of services would have to be modified to achieve it.\nSome features of managed care, such as prior authoriza-\ntion and utilization review, could presumably be ap-\nplied to unnecessary use but not underuse--in fact, ap-\nplication of such features may have an unintended\nconsequence of worsening unmet needs for treatments.\nFurthermore, it is not clear how any optimal allocation\nplan that is developed would be implemented in the de-\ncentralized US HC system, as this remains a formidable\ntask even in centralized HC systems.68\nThe proportion of NCS-R respondents who reported\n12-month mental health service use (17.9%) is higher than\nthe value found a decade earlier in the baseline NCS\n(13.3%)6 and the value found a decade before that in the\nEpidemiologic Catchment Area Study (12.3%).69 By far,\nthe greatest part of this expansion occurred in the GM\nsector. General physicians often act as gatekeepers re-\nsponsible for initiating mental health treatments them-\nselves and for deciding whom to triage for specialty\ncare.70,71 Increasing awareness of mental disorders on the\npart of primary care physicians, coupled with an in-\ncrease in consumer demand stimulated by direct-to-\nTable 3.

Reasons for\nthe low rate of treatment adequacy are unclear, but pre-\nsumably involve provider factors (eg, competing de-\nmands, inadequate reimbursements for treating mental\ndisorders, and less training and experience in treating\nmental disorders) and patient factors (eg, worse compli-\nService use also varied across disorders.

Because racial-\nethnic minorities have lower aggregate education and\nincome than nonminorities, these effects lead to gross in-\ncreases in unmet need for treatment among minorities,\neven though the effects may be mediated by low socio-\neconomic status.\nSimilar to the original NCS, we found that having in-\nsurance was associated with using HC sectors among\npeople receiving any treatment.37,95 These are worri-\nTable 6.

The effects of low income most likely reflect the for-\nmidable influences of financial barriers; because insur-\nance was controlled, these results imply that simply having\ninsurance may not be sufficient to overcome these ef-\nfects.96 Interestingly, those with the lowest incomes were\nassociated with more treatment than those with low-\naverage incomes, perhaps because the near poor do not\nqualify for often more generous entitlements for the in-\ndigent. Given our adjustment for income, the positive as-\nsociation between education and MHS care may be be-\ncause of more than education being a proxy for greater\nfinancial resources to pay for specialty services; instead,\nit may reflect an importance placed on knowledge and cog-\nnitive processes in many psychotherapeutic modalities.96\nGreater use of mental health services among those pre-\nviously married may indicate the power of relationship\nloss or strife as a motivator for seeking treatment.81 The\nfinding that the unmarried who seek HC are more likely\nto obtain it in specialty settings may reflect that coun-\nseling is often a preferred modality for those with rela-\ntional difficulties. Finally, lower treatment in rural areas\nprobably reflects the scarcity of treatment resources, es-\npecially in the MHS sector; however, the limited MHS\ncare that does exist is superior.97\nThree broad types of intervention are suggested by the\nresults. First, outreach efforts are needed to increase ac-\ncess to and initiation of treatments. Interventions of this\ntype could include renewed community awareness and\nscreening programs, new means for financing mental\nhealth services, and expansion of treatment resources for\nneeded to improve the quality of care delivered to pa-\ntients with mental disorders. Several disease manage-\nment programs that enhance treatment adequacy and\nadherence have already been proved successful and cost-\nin the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad-\nministration's Center for Mental Health Services Con-\nsumer-Oriented Mental Health Report Card60 and those\nof the National Committee for Quality Assurance,29 could\nfurther optimize quality and monitor future interven-\ntions' impacts. Third, initiatives are needed to increase\nthe uptake of successful programs and treatment mod-\nels. Widespread failure to disseminate proved interven-\ntions may, in fact, explain why large unmet needs per-\nsist in the United States, despite earlier efforts to address\nthis problem. Substantial barriers to the uptake of effec-\ntive interventions exist, including competing clinical de-\nmands and distorted incentives for effectively treating\nmental disorders faced by providers, particularly in pri-\nup proved interventions because they lack metrics to help\nunderstand what their return on investment will be.101\nOngoing initiatives seeking to overcome these barriers\ninclude the Robert Wood Johnson Depression in Pri-\nmary Care Program77 and the National Institute of Men-\ntal Health\u00adsponsored Work Outcomes Research and Cost-\nSubmitted for Publication: June 9, 2004; final revision\nCorrespondence: Philip S.
