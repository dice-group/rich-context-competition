We are concerned with\nways that strengthen their completion of the PhD for knowl-\nedge production. Our thinking is aligned with that of\nDonaldson and Crowley (1978) in that we seek to support\nstudents in becoming academically prepared in descriptive\nknowledge production, rather than prescriptive knowledge\nleading to practical implementation in professional disci-\nplines. Our goal is to support junior researchers and scholars\nin ways that assist them in developing strong research and\nscholarly careers without compromising their cultural back-\nground. The article begins with an integrative review of the\nmentoring literature and moves to a discussion of our collec-\ntive mentoring experiences to address how individuals and\norganizations in our society are deprived when members\nfrom cultural communities of our focus are not provided effi-\ncacious mentoring. The essay considers such issues as col-\nlective approaches to holistic mentoring that engage mentees'\ncultural foundations and completion of knowledge-produc-\ntion PhDs, while addressing the development of sustainable\nprofessional and scholarly research careers.\nStudents of color, which we use to refer collectively to the\ndemographic groups of Native, African, and Chicano/Latin\nAmericans, have been historically excluded from higher edu-\ncation and remain underrepresented in doctoral programs.\nThese students were awarded 13.8% of earned doctorates in\n2011 (U.S. Department of Education, National Center for\nEducation Statistics, 2012), although Native, African, and\nChicano/Latin Americans comprise nearly 30% of the U.S.\npopulation (Humes, Jones, & Ramirez, 2011). In particular,\npost-baccalaureate African American women have been\nreported to have especially challenging and isolating experi-\nences in primarily White institutions (Ellis, 2001; Johnson-\nBailey, Valentine, Cervero, & Bowles, 2009; King &\nmade up 16.4% of all post-baccalaureate women (U.S.\nDepartment of Education, National Center for Education\nStatistics, 2012). By comparison, African American women\nfaculty members represent a much lower percentage, that is,\n3%, of all full-time faculty members (U.S. Department of\nEducation, National Center for Education Statistics, 2013).\nThese numbers confirm the reported dearth of available\nwomen of color to serve as faculty mentors for women of the\nsame background (King & Chepyator-Thomson, 1996;\n1Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nBeronda L.

Johnson1\n Keywords\nmentoring, domestic populations of color, graduate students, post-doctoral scientists, junior faculty\n2 SAGE Open\nCurrently, our nation's professional and academic envi-\nronments regularly reinforce self-promotion, competitive\npersonal ambition, and individualized career advances\n(Casadevall & Fang, 2012). Most mentoring approaches in\nour country tend to focus on preparing individuals to single-\nmindedly compete in such environments with little acknowl-\nedgment of possible alternatives. This falsely promotes\nacademia as an individualistic arena in which one seeks to\nmake singular contributions to be worthy of individual merit\nand rewards. Such a posture goes against the very nature of\nthe human species and the reality of scientific knowledge\nproduction as a \"community effort comprising innumerable\ninterdependent contributions\" (Casadevall & Fang, 2012,\np. 893). Furthermore, for students of color and women, indi-\nvidualistic approaches are largely contrary to more prevalent\ncommunity-focused or collectivist approaches that may be\nactive in their communities of origin and/or socialization\nSmith, Cech, Metz, Huntoon, & Moyer, 2014; Su, Rounds, &\nArmstrong, 2009). We propose that there are more produc-\ntive, successful, systematic, and integrated approaches to\nmentoring graduate students and junior faculty than the indi-\nvidualistic and competitive-oriented ideological posture cur-\nrently operative in too many academic settings. In this article,\nwe propose one such alternative mentoring model, particu-\nlarly for domestic individuals of color and women, which\naids in mentees'comprehending that their career of teaching,\nresearch, and service activities can be accomplished as inte-\ngrated efforts. We maintain that such mentoring can encom-\npass personal integrity as well as the mentees'cultural values\nRationale and Significance\nNo matter the economic phase, our democratic society has a\ncontinuing need for exceptionally well-educated, well-\ntrained graduate students and junior faculty to assume peda-\ngogical and leadership roles related to basic knowledge\nproduction and higher education. The need for such intellec-\nPitre, 2008), and this is in addition to the acquired technical\nskills--data collection and analysis, mathematical manipula-\ntion and calculation, academic writing, and many more--\nthat are related to specialized arenas of academic preparation.\nEven if every U.S. citizen were maximally employed, we\nwould still need a well-prepared cadre of professionals\nresponsible to think through, and train others to rigorously\nengage in basic social, biological, political, physical, eco-\nnomic, human services, and other issues of collective life\nwithin the global context of our complex 21st-century lives\n(Macfarlane, 2012). Equally needed is a well-prepared pool\nof professionals who represent the demographic distribution\nof our nation's citizen population, including persons whose\ncultural communities have historically been marginalized\nwithin U.S. higher education. It is a basic mandate of our\ndemocratic ethos and societal values to achieve equitable\nparticipation from members of the total citizen population to\nseriously engage and train others to think deeply through\nbasic issues associated with collective living (McGee Banks,\n1995). This article focuses on these issues as we describe and\ndiscuss ways to enhance the preparation of domestic students\nand junior faculty of color, including women, through men-\ntoring processes that assist in completing the PhD and pre-\nparing for a professional career that integrates the work of\nresearch, teaching, and service for knowledge production\nwithout compromising cultural heritages of their\nbackground.\nLiterature Review: Advising for\nCompletion Versus Mentoring for\nCareer Sustainability\nWithin most literature, the framework for mentoring indi-\nviduals toward academic careers that focuses on knowledge\nproduction has largely addressed a need to produce persons\nwho can conduct \"independent\" investigations. Such\nresearch work has largely been understood as individualistic\nin nature and supposedly produces evidence of the research-\ner's ability to think independently and make his or her singu-\nlar contributions to the discipline of choice (Bagilhole &\nBoryung, 2008). In so doing, such persons are, or more likely\nmay be, deemed to be worthy of singularly focused recogni-\ntion, with an ultimate reward being the granting of tenure in\na department at a university or other academic organization\nbased on such contributions to a discipline. Toward this end,\nmany view mentoring students from citizen populations\nunderrepresented in academia as primarily a transfer of \"cul-\ntural capital\" associated with educational arenas, as that is\ndeemed needed to progress and demonstrate individual\nmerit.\nThe concept of cultural capital is frequently used to\ndescribe, but is not limited to, \"knowledge and other advan-\ntages that people possess that help them to succeed in their\nendeavors, such as negotiating educational systems\"\nhas been argued that increasing the cultural capital of indi-\nviduals from underrepresented domestic populations within\neducational systems can be one outcome of faculty mentor-\ning and developmental engagement with students and junior\nfaculty members (Chanderbhan-Forde et al., 2012; Ovink &\nSimilarly, the lack of understanding about or access to such\ncultural capital has been viewed as a major impediment for\nsuch persons' career advancement (Chanderbhan-Forde et\nencompassing the presumption that cultural heritages of our\ncountry's diverse populations should be abdicated for indi-\nviduals to assume the presumed and often false value of a\nMontgomery et al. 3\nuniversal \"academic educational career.\" The reality is that\nour diverse communities too have cultural capital that also\ncan be included in educational processes of a democratic\nnation.\nEven when speaking generally, effective mentoring with\ngraduate students and junior faculty requires that we concep-\ntualize and implement a process that extends beyond build-\ning early career individuals' disciplinary knowledge and\nintegrates socialization for future careers. This is even more\ncritical when mentoring with individuals from U.S. domestic\npopulations historically excluded from mainstream higher\neducation as they regularly have little to no exposure to aca-\ndemia and its processes (e.g., Anglin & Wade, 2007; Dodson\nJohnson-Bailey, 2004). One implication of this understand-\ning is that mentoring with the aforementioned groups requires\nextensive time investments by faculty members, who them-\nselves are usually from populations underrepresented in aca-\n2012). As we consider the \"individual success\" model and\ncontext of U.S. mentoring, the time a faculty person devotes\nto interacting with graduate students and/or junior faculty\nmembers can be, and often is, viewed as a distraction from\nthe mentoring faculty's personal research agenda and career\nresearchers and faculty members have acknowledged the\npotential impact on one's career of serving as students'\ninvested and experienced senior advisor. Their findings sug-\ngest that faculty mentoring efforts are frequently not recog-\nnized or rewarded in the formal organizational review and\nSuch findings and attitudes also suggest a strong need for\nenhanced socialization of existing faculty concerning ideas\nbehind mentoring, as well as its practice (Gasman et al.,\ntoring is an opportunity \"to simultaneously counsel and col-\nlaborate\" (Griffin, 2012a, p. 2). It is a faculty-engagement\nopportunity that can effectively promote the integration of\nresearch, teaching, and mentoring to leverage faculty mem-\nbers' efforts as collaborating contributors in the larger orga-\nnizational goals of student development and faculty success\n(Hart, Grogan, Litt, & Worthington, 2009; O'Meara &\nMentoring is also an opportunity to demonstrate that faculty\nmembers are making strategic career choices that demon-\nstrate successful integrative research, teaching, and service\nwhile strengthening the practice of a stronger higher educa-\ntion for our society's next educating/pedagogical generation\nContemporary, normative approaches for advising stu-\ndents contrast sharply with opportunities for expanding\nfaculty approaches to mentoring. The majority of current\napproaches for preparing faculty to be strong mentors are\nobservational in nature wherein mentees are expected to\nintrinsically learn the skills and craft of mentoring from their\nexperiences of having been carefully advised rather than\nfrom structured guidance in efficacious mentoring (Griffin,\n2012b). Structured opportunities for developing and practic-\ning successful career skills have been noted as lacking during\ngraduate and post-doctoral training, and generally are left to\nindividual observation and/or incorporation (Gibbs &\nGriffin, 2013). It is the structured guidance of graduate stu-\ndents and junior faculty that best prepares them to receive\nand benefit from comprehensive mentoring (Griffin &\nToldson, 2012) and to prepare them with the ability to make\ninformed decisions and strategic moves in developing and\nsustaining their careers (Gibbs & Griffin, 2013).\nThe committed relationship of structured guidance is\nmuch more in line with mentoring rather than the advising\nprocess of transferring information that may help an individ-\nual navigate a curriculum. A mentor should serve a deeper\npurpose that has been aptly described as \"one who observes,\ncalls out and cultivates unrealized potential in others\"\nmentor must invest time in getting to know each mentee's\nstrengths and weaknesses so well that the mentor is able to\nidentify \"a glimmer of potential and . . . is willing to engage\nin `a fine archeological dig' to move the student from aver-\nage to excellent\" (Dr. Harold Cheatham as quoted in Griffin\nThe authors of this article propose a distinction between\nadvising and mentoring that is critical for guiding graduate\nstudents, junior faculty, and women from underrepresented\ndomestic populations toward PhD completion and embark-\ning on sustainable and impactful professional academic\ncareers. We contend that an advisor is one who provides gen-\neral curriculum advice about adherence to rules and/or stan-\ndards that apply for any student in a particular educational\nHowever, mentoring is a significantly deeper relationship,\none in which the mentor and mentee commit to meaningful\nand honest sharing to support a particular individual. The\nsharing allows the mentor to develop a multifaceted personal\nunderstanding of the mentee and provide committed assis-\ntance in order that the mentee progresses toward achieving\nhis or her academic professional goals (Baker & Griffin,\nunderstanding makes the mentoring relationship a dynamic\nbilateral exchange and transfer of knowledge in true collab-\norative thinking, planning, and action for the mentee's career\ntrajectory. We support this level of engagement as part of an\nintegrated approach to creating sustainable careers. Based on\nour work with domestic graduate students and junior faculty\nfrom underrepresented populations, we present our experi-\nences regarding specific activities, actions, and consider-\nations that have proven valuable and effective for achieving\nsuch objectives.\n4 SAGE Open\nMajor Concepts: Conceptualization of\nCareer, Mentoring, and Social Capital\nWithout clarity in how we define major concepts that have\nguided our work, it is not possible to delve into complex\ndetails of how the authors have mentored with persons of\ncolor and women for successful careers in higher education.\nWe begin with an alternative working definition of \"career\"\nas going beyond any particular \"job\" a person may have or\ndo. We contend that career includes a job--even two or\nmore, but career is an arena of life work in which a person\nsurrounds herself or himself; an arena in which they are sus-\ntained through all aspects and phases of their living; it is\ninfinitely larger than \"an individual job.\" A job may be\nworking activities that allow for financial and material sur-\nvival (Wrzesniewski, McCauley, Rozin, & Schwartz, 1997),\nbut a career provides for physical survival even as it nurtures\nthe professional soul, uplifts personal emotions, and enhances\none's intellect. Career has been described as \"the pattern of\nwork-related experiences that span the course of a person's\nlife\" (Greenhaus, Callanan, & Godschalk, 2000, p. 9).\nHowever, career is not limited to single-minded focus on\nspecific tasks or work activities (Porter, 2005). Rather, within\nour concept, an individual in the work of his or her career has\nacquired effective professional, social, and emotional skills,\nas well as a conscious awareness about the use of such skills\nto help balance career activities with other life arenas. Our\nconcept of career can begin or end with a related or unrelated\njob that might be thought of as forming bookends around the\nlongtime, life activities of career.\nIn addition to satisfying the need for employment, careers\nreflect individual interests and preferences, and are generally\nflexible enough to allow innovative changes within the\ncareer. Academic careers may be based in a university or\nother educational campuses, but they are not exclusive to\nthat arena of service to society or societal functioning. Strong\nacademic careers can be located in service sectors and/or be\npart of an entrepreneurial focus. Matrix measuring tools may\nbe used to evaluate successful progression in career arenas,\nbut the tools usually must be adjusted to particulars of indi-\nvidual goals and accomplishments rather than adjusting spe-\ncifics of the career to matrix evaluating tools, particularly\nthose established and imposed by external entities.\nWe have already eluded to distinctions between activities\nof \"advising\" and \"mentoring,\" and it must be remembered\nthat all mentoring of graduate students and/or junior faculty\nincludes advising but not all advising equates mentoring;\nindeed, most do not. For much of U.S. academic history,\nmany university faculty members have been assigned one or\nmore graduate students and/or junior faculty as advisees, but\nthese academic professionals do not necessarily provide the\nmore encompassing structured guidance of a mentoring\nassignment. Advisors are available to aid students and/or\njunior faculty in identifying appropriate courses, books,\ninstructors, and other particulars regarding completion of an\neducational curriculum, or to navigate the bureaucracy of a\nparticular school or assignment. However, mentors provide\nstudents and junior faculty with guidance on the many social\nand political details of preparing for and implementing a suc-\ncessful and sustainable academic career. More important,\nmentors systematically make it a point to introduce their\nmentee(s) to people, places, attitudes, materials, and opportu-\nnities that serve as stepping stones to a successful and sustain-\nable career; they share their professional skills and networks.\nUnlike many if not most academic professionals, mentors\nconceptualize pursuit of the PhD well beyond boundaries of\nparticularized curricula training and \"skills acquisition\" that\nis part and parcel of contemporary U.S. doctorate graduate\neducation. Mentors see knowledge production as a much\nlarger process and set of activities. Persons acquiring a PhD\nfor knowledge production and using our concept of mentor\nand mentoring will obtain disciplinary skills and also have\npractical exposure and experience that has been integrated\nwith appropriate social, political, and other cultural situa-\ntions that occur and reoccur within arenas of academic\ncareers. We contend that this type of knowledge and skills\nacquisition, often referred to as social capital (Bourdieu,\ncal for those whose cultural communities have been histori-\ncally and systematically excluded from the social context of\nhigher education and those preparatory exposures that feed\ninto that context. These individuals bring years of knowledge\nwith and from their cultural heritage as they enter higher\neducation but such knowledge is often not valued or used\n(Davidson & Foster-Johnson, 2001; Grant & Simmons,\n2008). Often, there is conflict between higher education--\nprocess and atmosphere--and students' cultural knowledge,\nand adjusting to specific behavioral information and prac-\ntices of the educational environment can be arduous. There\nare additional concepts that inform our mentoring work;\nhowever, the conceptualization of career, mentoring, and\nsocial capital are felt to be the most salient for exploring\nissues of this article.\nWhat Experience Has Taught\nThe authors have brought experience and exposure from a\nvariety of academic arenas partnered with work with a men-\ntoring collective at Michigan State University, a large\nresearch university, which has helped stimulate this and other\nwritings. The African Atlantic Research Team is a collective\nthat was organized some 16 years ago. The intent has been to\nsupport students from communities traditionally excluded\nand/or underrepresented in the academy, as well as women in\ntheir pursuit of knowledge-production doctorate degrees. We\nhave found that systems and efforts aimed at preparing these\nstudents as well as junior faculty are often deemed as suspect\nwhen the process of preparation does not support the pursuit\nof individualized competitive careers. A key principle that\nwe have learned from years of our mentoring efforts is that\nhuman beings learn and work most effectively in a collective\neven as an individual's well-being and development are of\nMontgomery et al. 5\nprimary focus (e.g., Gokhale, 1995; Johnson & Johnson,\nSimilarly, open and honest communication between mentors\nand mentees has been demonstrated to be of utmost impor-\ntance in order that guidance be appropriate to an individual's\noverall career vision (e.g., Patterson-Stewart, Ritchie, &\nSanders, 1997). Given the intensity of time, energy, and\nresource commitment involved in the pursuit of the PhD and\na career within the academy, good mentoring is usually a\nlong-term collaboration and must be predicated on shared\ncommunication and understandings.\nBest lessons learned and dispensed from our collective\nmentoring have been within the context of cross- and inter-\ngenerational efforts of a \"critical community.\" The concept\nof \"critical community\" refers to a collective of individuals\nsimilarly dedicated to providing honest structured guidance\nand supporting opportunities to enhance their individual cul-\ntural capital to sustain and expand all members for their\nThomas, Willis, & Davis, 2007). This attention to personal-\nized mentoring as part of a critical collective allows each\nmember to understand himself or herself as a humane profes-\nsional, responsible for engaging with and contributing to\ntheir career community as well as to the local, national, and,\neventually, international environments in which he or she\nwill work. Some of the mentoring roles that emerge as part of\none's membership in such a critical community are those of\n\"confronter, clarifier, comforter and collaborator\" as these\npersons are committed to be there if and as called on (L.\nThomas, personal communication, April 4, 2014). These role\nlabels, although not exhaustive, do capture the nature of how\neffective mentors function. Mentors will shift in and between\nthese roles as the mentee grows and develops. The constant\nis the presence of and commitment to a critical community\nthat will permeate almost all phases of a successful career. To\nlearn how to function in such a collective is an indispensable\nneed that is particularly significant for individuals whose\ncultural communities have been historically excluded from\nhigher education and the U.S. academy (Davidson & Foster-\nWe have identified four distinct phases and specific activ-\nities that are associated with mentoring toward successful\nacademic careers: pre-career, early career, mid-career, and\nfull or senior professional years. We single out mentoring\nlessons associated with these divisions and devote this por-\ntion of the article to elucidating aspects of those phases. Even\nbefore a full mentoring relationship is established, mentee\nand mentor--together or separately--must discern the men-\ntee's current phase. This can more effectively allow the inte-\ngration of mentoring components.\nPre-Career Phase\nUndergraduate years. Undergraduate years are not often con-\nsidered part of graduate and/or junior faculty mentoring.\nHowever, graduate students and junior faculty come from\nthe ranks of undergraduate students. More important, it is\nstudents of the baccalaureate who need exposure to larger\nviews of higher education than their particular curricula usu-\nally offer. They also need an understanding that higher edu-\ncation--the academy--is intimately connected to the\nsuccessful functioning of society. Such comprehension can\nbetter help students envision possibilities of a career in intel-\nlectual leadership.\nCurrently, our society is giving strong recognition to ben-\nefits of practicum, hands-on, experiential, or research-based\nexperiences at this undergraduate phase (Russell, Hancock,\nAcademic advisors in such support programs have the poten-\ntial to serve as future mentors for students but that character\nof the relationships is not automatic and perhaps rarely\nequals the intensive mentoring investment these authors are\nadvocating. Nevertheless, support program advisors can be\nhelpful to undergraduate students in identifying outlines of\nprofessional networks and alerting them to the need for self-\ncare as an intricate part of graduate education and an even-\ntual sustainable career that is \"respectful of the whole person\"\ncare sensitivities can derail professional relationships\nGraduate years.At this phase of pre-career development,\nmentoring intensifies as mentees have identified that they\nwish to pursue a path that leads to professional functioning in\nthe variety of knowledge-production careers. Students\nactively engage in learning the crafts of comprehensive read-\ning, professional writing, design and data analysis of\nresearch, and dissemination. They also should be exposed to\na higher level of professional structures even as they are\nmeeting requirements of their curriculum. Strong mentoring\nis responsible to ensure that students are acquiring the high-\nest levels of skills mastery in each of these categories.\nIt is in the graduate years that students need to refine their\nability to function as conscious professionals who perform\neffectively within arenas of the career to which they aspire.\nMentors are critical in this endeavor as they should be iden-\ntifying professional events and activities in which mentees\ncan participate. Mentors also should allow mentees to\naccompany them to professional gatherings and introduce\nthe emerging professionals to members of the gatherings.\nOften, this means that mentors assist in finding travel sup-\nport funds for graduate students to attend the events. Such\nefforts allow mentees to actually participate in activities of\nprofessional arenas and support their academic and social\nacculturation to support their progression toward successful\nEqually important is that these years provide graduate stu-\ndents with opportunities to help socialize younger individu-\nals to the demands of the career arenas (Dodson et al., 2009;\nwhere the critical community of cross generations, diverse\n6 SAGE Open\ncultures, and diverse genders is significant. By engaging in\npeer advising and mentoring, students have an opportunity to\nobserve and participate in clarifying the taken-for-granted,\nunspoken yet normative behaviors of professional responsi-\nbilities. This directly relates to arenas where many women\nand members of racial ethnic cultural communities have not\nbeen exposed. In fact, primarily White institutions are in\ngreat need of enhanced and culturally sensitive mentoring for\nstudents of color, particularly underserved African American\nwomen in these contexts (Grant & Simmons, 2008; Johnson-\nBailey, 2004). For most graduate students of color attending\nsuch institutions, the focus is on promoting their assimilation\ninto a predominantly White environment rather than promot-\ning an environment that recognizes the cultures and contri-\nbutions of all participants, or promoting \"authentic cultural\nMentoring for students of color is likely to benefit from\nengaging collectivist perspectives (e.g., Blue, 2001;\nDavidson & Foster-Johnson, 2001; McGee, Saran, &\nwith these students' cultures of origin. In this regard, a criti-\ncal community, such as our mentoring collective, can help to\nreinforce students' maintaining the cultural integrity of their\nbackground while prioritizing professional responsibilities.\nThis is important and differs from the individual and short-\nterm gains to which much of higher education currently\nsocializes graduate students.\nEarly Career Phase: Post-Doctoral and Pre-Tenure\nYears\nThe early career phase of an individual's educational and\nlearning life can be initiated by post-doctoral years and may\nextend into pre-tenure and/or years equivalent to those of\njunior faculty. We argue that a post-doctoral experience,\nmost immediately after the award of the PhD, is vital for\ngrounding an effective and sustainable career, regardless of\none's disciplinary focus. The post-doctorate affords the new\nPhD an opportunity to recover from the total fatigue of com-\npleting a graduate program and a dissertation. During this\nearly career phase, mentors should be assisting their mentees\nin entering more deeply into professional arenas as well as\nhelping them to assess and/or redesign career objectives and\ngoals based on post-doctorate experiences.\nWe frame this guided period of professional maturation as\na time for an individual to gain cognition, that is \"knowing\nwhat they know\" about their competence as a producer of\nknowledge and consciously identifying strategies to navigate\nmacro- and micro-level career environments (Griffin, Muniz,\n& Espinosa, 2012). Individuals from U.S. domestic popula-\ntions underrepresented in higher education and women are\nespecially in need of mentoring during the early career\nphase. Mentors must assist in expanding socialization oppor-\ntunities, and/or help assess expanded socialization experi-\nences. For example, mentors will need to help early career\npersons identify and learn to respond to encounters with\nmicro aggressions that pervade professional lives of racial\nethnic persons and women. These are the verbal, behavioral,\nand/or environmental affronts against people of color and\nwomen who are rarely deemed strong or visible enough to\ndemand immediate responses (Constantine, Smith,\nMentors must help early career individuals learn how to rec-\nognize such actions, how to identify allies, and how to enact\nstrategies to sustain their sense of effective and competent\ncultural self while continuing on a designated career trajec-\ntory (e.g., Williams, 2001). Productive strategies that have\nbeen suggested include the creation of \"alternative microcli-\nmates\" (p. 84), or \"safe spaces\" that provide environments\nwhere support, collegiality, and validation may be found\nwithin otherwise hostile environments (Ackelsberg, Hart,\nMid-Career Phase: Immediate Post-Tenure Years\nThe mid-career professorship years are distinguished by\nmentees bringing together job with career vision while con-\ntinuing to expand knowledge-production foundations.\nGenerally, the expansion occurs after one attains specific\nobjectives toward goals of their vision. In an academic arena,\nthis expansion usually occurs after tenure has been firmly\nestablished. The development can also occur in a multitude\nof arenas and through distinct participation in professional\ncommunities of a disciplinary field, through completion of a\nrange of publications that reflect a selected expertise, by the\nmentoring of curriculum-based students and/or post-doctoral\nresearchers, and through expansion of professional contacts\nand networks. It is through accomplishments in these areas at\nthe mid-career level that an individual is able to continue\nexpanding his or her influence at the institutional, national,\nand international levels.\nParticular challenges can arise for women and faculty of\ncolor during the mid-career phase because of increasing\nrequests and/or demands on time for service activities and\nincreasing requests to mentor junior colleagues of color and\nwomen (Baldwin, DeZure, Shaw, & Moretto, 2008;\nwhereas mid-career faculty are guiding mentees, they simul-\ntaneously remain in need of mentoring to help them success-\nfully approach continued and new challenges (Canale,\nformal programs for mentoring of mid-career faculty con-\ntinue to emerge, specific attention to the needs of women and\nfaculty of color at the mid-career phase lag far behind such\ndevelopments (Baldwin & Chang, 2006; Baldwin et al.,\nDuring this phase, mentors should guide mentees to seek\nopportunities to serve on editorial boards of various national\nand international publications and to serve with governing\nMontgomery et al. 7\ncommittees of professional organizations, accrediting units,\nand other committees to which they are active and contribut-\ning members. Beyond advancing their own career, such ser-\nvice activities are important for identifying places where\nmid-career persons can insert mentees and students. Equally\nimportant is that these service activities help to establish the\nreputation of the mid-career person.\nSenior Career Phase: Full Professional Years\nWhen arriving at this phase of senior professional, an indi-\nvidual should have assumed the beginnings of a leadership\nrole in his or her chosen arenas and/or research fields. Such a\nposition should be national and international in scope with a\nfull range of memberships in specialty professional organi-\nzations. The leadership positions may include but are not\nlimited to membership and/or directorship on editorial\nboards of journals and/or book series; membership in the\nnuclei relationships that guide professional associations and/\nor societies; being regularly called on to assess graduate\nwriting, professional promotions, and personnel hiring;\nbeing invited to make key-note presentations; being selected\nto conduct program/departmental accreditation reviews;\nleading the organizing of specialized professional gatherings\nand publications; and many other such activities.\nWe see this phase as one where the individual stands well\npositioned to challenge these same professional spaces to be\nmore inclusive and reflective of populations and social issues\nhistorically excluded from U.S. higher education (e.g.,\nForeman, 2013). This is not necessarily how many research-\ners, scholars, or other accomplished professionals contempo-\nrarily envision their responsibility, in positions as they are\ndeveloping their career or as a senior scholar. Too often, such\npersons, particularly those who are part of an academic\ndepartmental faculty at U.S. colleges and universities, are\nfocused and advised to focus on advancing their individual\ncareers to achieve promotion. The aspiration for promotion,\nwith its specific processes and tasks cannot be denied, but if\neveryone is myopically concerned with securing positions\nand status as individuals, we are not truly fulfilling our col-\nlective and individual responsibility to our democratic soci-\nThese authors have learned that a significant goal and\nimportant career responsibility of all who serve in research,\nscholarship, and/or other professional roles are that they/we\nare mandated to contribute to the improvement of our society\nand all humankind. The ability to sustain and succeed in this\nresponsibility is definitely built on an individual's move into\nincreasingly secure employment positions. However, the\nlarger, overall goal is not merely individual success but the\ninclusive improvement of our democratic society and assist-\ning in enhancing the quality of life for human beings as we\nparticipate in our ecological environment.\nWe also have learned that senior professionals have an\nadded obligation to help insert their cadre of student and\njunior faculty mentees, into integrated pathways that lead to\ntheir chosen professional arena(s). The importance of this\ncritical role of senior faculty in introducing mentees to mem-\nbers of their professional networks and key academic and\nprofessional opportunities has been noted by others (Ramirez,\n2012). Successful implementation of this role responsibility\nleads back to our earlier propositional stance that a prerequi-\nsite for strong mentoring is full knowledge of mentees.\nMentors who have achieved senior status and have knowl-\nedge about their mentees will be well informed of a mentee's\nchosen professional arena(s). It also is here that a functioning\ncritical community allows each member to help identify and\nshare supportive materials and opportunities for other mem-\nbers at their particular phase of growth and development.\nThe need for such a community has been referred to by oth-\ners as \"alternative microclimates\" (Ackelsberg et al., 2009),\nsupportive or functional \"relationship constellations\"\n(Thomas et al., 2007), or \"collectivism mentoring\" (Davidson\n& Foster-Johnson, 2001). Such communities have been pur-\nported to align more with the cultures of mentees of color, as\nopposed to the prevailing approach by many senior scholars\nof mentoring and cultivation of individuals who largely mir-\nror the mentor (i.e., homosocial reproduction) in academia\nWe do not assume that senior status allows a professional,\nresearcher, and/or scholar to cease their development. Even\nin the senior phase, an individual must continue contributing\nto knowledge production in his or her professional areas.\nEach individual must continue designing fundable research\nprojects, conducting investigations, analyzing and publish-\ning from their investigations, and presenting findings in pro-\nfessional contexts of significant others. An implication of\nsuch activities in this phase of a career should mean that\nseniors help expand their professional arenas and ensure that\nstandards for bringing in aspiring new professionals do not\nlapse into the return of prior inequalities. The senior phase of\nmentoring work includes serving as critical advocates for\njunior and mid-career professionals as they progress through\ntheir respective phases.\nFinally, given the political nature of knowledge produc-\ntion and dissemination, we strongly recommend that scholars\nwith such seniority identify a reliable and accessible location\nfor depositing their professional papers, data, other research,\nand accomplishments, including specific instructions for its\nentire usage. The choice should be one that ensures the mate-\nrials will be processed quickly, made available for research\nscholars, and does not impose restrictive fees for use of the\nmaterials. This can help ensure that the materials are effec-\ntively preserved and accessible to future generations.\nPerspectives on the Way Forward\nThere is a growing recognition of the need for scholars, par-\nticularly of color, to contribute to efficacious mentoring to\nsupport junior scholars in building and sustaining thriving\n8 SAGE Open\ncareers inclusive of overall personal and professional well-\nbeing (e.g., Rivera Maulucci & Mensah, 2013). Important\nfor mentoring junior scholars is modeling the close connec-\ntion that some faculty maintain between their personally\ndeveloped identities as part of their cultural grounding and\ntheir intellectual lives (Moore, Shinew, Sternod, Merk, &\nSaul, 2013), as the perceived inability to have such connec-\ntions is an impediment to some students selecting to pursue\ncareers in knowledge production (Austin, 2002; A. Smith,\n2013). Our integrative review of the literature and mentoring\nexperiences suggest that it is possible to implement a process\nthat allows students and junior faculty of color, as well as\nwomen, to understand and prepare for the many challenges\nand opportunities that come with a professional academic\ncareer. Such processes require significant input of time,\neffort, and commitment on the part of mentees and mentors.\nHowever, when viewed as a collaborative effort, such inten-\nsive processes can be successful and add value to the experi-\nence of each participant.The success and value are manifested\nin the traditional sense of productivity and in the non-\ntraditional sense of enrichment to the life of all parties\ninvolved in the mentoring exchange.\nThere are environmental factors that affect the potential\nefficacy of such mentoring of developing scholars of color\nand women. Potential mentors of like backgrounds with\nthese young scholars and women remain low in number; for\nexample, the number of African American women faculty\nand instructors has remained virtually unchanged since at\nleast 2007 (U.S. Department of Education, National Center\nfor Education Statistics, 2012). In addition, some colleges\nand universities continue to maintain cultures and/or envi-\nronments that, although \"legally\" open to all students, persist\nin maintaining closed doors that actively impede participa-\ntion of people of color and women (Ellis, 2001, p. 42). These\nand other factors suggest an urgent need to reform environ-\nments into ones that support effective faculty mentoring and\nreward the efforts of strong, efficacious mentors (Gasman\nWe have outlined some effective mentoring practices\nbased on the literature and our collective personal experi-\nences. One such effective model includes mentoring in criti-\ncal collective communities. Such a collective approach\ndraws on the combined strengths of the participating indi-\nviduals; mitigates the prevalent isolation of students and fac-\nulty of color, especially African American women; and can\nprovide some relief to the problem of limited access to men-\ntors. Such arrangements promote beneficial peer interac-\ntions, and address the need for an environment wherein the\ncultural foundations of students and junior faculty are inte-\ngrated in the mentoring process. All of these are identifiable\nas factors contributing to or detracting from the success of\nthe aforementioned populations (Ackelsberg et al., 2009;\nJohnson-Bailey et al., 2009; King & Chepyator-Thomson,\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAckelsberg, M., Hart, J., Miller, N.
