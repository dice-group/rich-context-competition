We eval-\nuated this association by applying group-based mixture models to data derived from the National Survey of the Jap-\nanese Elderly, which included 4,869 adults aged 60 or more years, with up to 7 repeated observations between\n1987 and 2006. Four distinct BMI trajectories were identified: \"low-normal weight, decreasing\" (baseline BMI = 18.7;\n23.8% of sample); \"mid-normal weight, decreasing\" (baseline BMI = 21.9; 44.6% of sample); \"high-normal weight,\ndecreasing\" (baseline BMI = 24.8; 26.5% of sample); and \"overweight, stable\" (baseline BMI = 28.7; 5.2% of sam-\nple). Survival analysis with an average follow-up of 13.8 years showed that trajectories of higher BMI were associ-\nated with lower mortality. In particular, relative to those with a mid-normal weight, decreasing BMI trajectory, those\nwith an overweight, stable BMI trajectory had the lowest mortality, and those with a low-normal, decreasing BMI\ntrajectory had the highest mortality. In sharp contrast with prior observations from Western populations, BMI\nchanges lie primarily within the normal-weight range, and virtually no older Japanese are obese. The association\nbetween BMI trajectories and mortality varies according to the distribution of BMI within the population.\nbody mass index; Japan; mortality; older adults; trajectories\nAbbreviations: ADL, activity of daily living; BMI, body mass index; CI, confidence interval.\nWeight change is known as an important predictor of mor-\ntality risk. Although several studies have generally concluded\nthat, in adulthood, weight loss is associated with an increased\nrisk of all-cause mortality relative to stable weight, findings\non the relationship between weight gain and mortality have\nbeen mixed (1\u00ad10). These observations apply to older popu-\nlations as well (1, 4, 11\u00ad15). Furthermore, in older adults,\nweight changes have been shown to predict mortality better\nthan a single weight assessment (15).\nAlthough prior studies of weight changes and mortality\nyield important insights, the classification of weight change\ncould be significantly improved in 2 respects. First, weight\nchanges in the past have been defined largely on the basis of\nbody mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)2) measured at\n2 points in time over a relatively short interval. Because body\nweight can fluctuate substantially over the adult life course\n(16\u00ad18), weight changes measured at multiple time points over\nan extended period of time (e.g., 5\u00ad10 or more years) may\nprovide additional important information. Second, prior re-\nsearch has commonly categorized trajectories of change in\nBMI by using assignment rules that are based on subjective\ncriteria (e.g., 5% gain or loss from baseline body weight). Al-\nthough such assignment rules are generally reasonable, they\nare limited because the existence of certain categories of weight\nchanges must be assumed a priori.Thus, the analysis cannot test\nempirically for their presence, which constitutes a fundamental\nshortcoming. In addition, ex-ante specified rules provide no\nbasis for calibrating the precision of individual classifications\nto the various groups that comprise these categories. Therefore,\nthe uncertaintyabout an individual's group membership cannot\nbe quantified in the form of probabilities (19).\nTo date, there have been only 2 studies exploring the rela-\ntionship between BMI trajectories and mortality, both of\nwhich were based on data from the Health and Retirement\nAmerican Journal of Epidemiology\n\u00a9 The Author 2015.

However, the extent to which their conclusions can be\ngeneralized to other populations remains to be evaluated.\nMany non-Western societies differ significantly from the\nUnites States in the distribution of body weight. For instance,\ninJapan,3.9%oftheadultpopulationareobese(BMI:30.0),\nalence of underweight (BMI: <18.5) is 8.2%, and the pre-\nspectively, obese and overweight, and 1.7% and 35.6% are\nunderweight and normal weight (23). These differences are\nconsistent in old-age groups (refer to detailed statistics in\nWeb Table 1, available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/). More-\nover, a World Health Organization Expert Consultation (24)\nconcluded that the current World Health Organization cutoff\npoints do not provide an adequate basis for taking action on\nrisks related to overweight and obesity in Asian populations.\nThis suggests the need to apply different thresholds for defin-\ning overweight and obesity in these populations. Therefore,\nunderstanding whether the trajectories of body weight changes\nin older Japanese and their relationships with mortality are\nsimilar or different from those observed in Western popula-\ntions can carry valuable clinical and public health implications.\nThe present study has 2 specific aims. First, we apply group-\nbased mixture models to identify distinct trajectories of BMI in\nJapanese adults, aged 60 years or more at baseline. Second, we\nexamine the relationship between the trajectories of BMI and\nall-cause mortality. Our goal is to determine whether the tra-\njectories of body weight changes in older Japanese and their\nrelationships with mortality are similar to or different from\nthose observed in Western populations.\nMETHODS\nStudy population\nData came from the National Survey of the Japanese El-\nderly, which is a 7-wave longitudinal data set that included\nof 3.42 observations per participant). This survey began with\nThe sample was subsequently supplemented in 1990 (wave 2;\nn = 2,000) (for detailed information on the number of partic-\nipants at each wave, refer to Web Table 2). Face-to-face in-\nterviews were used to collect data. Responses obtained from\nproxy interviews were excluded. Response rates for each wave\nof the survey ranged from 67% to 93%. This study was ap-\nproved by the Institutional Review Board of the Tokyo Metro-\npolitan Institute of Gerontologyand the Universityof Michigan.\nMortality and follow-up\nFollow-ups for all-cause mortality were conducted until\ndates of death were collected by reviewing residence certifi-\ncates with the permission of local municipalities where the\nparticipants lived. For people whose date of death (year,\nmonth, and day) could not be ascertained (n = 35), a date\nwas imputed as the midpoint between the respondent's\nlast interview and the next wave. If only month or day of\ndeath could not be obtained (n = 363), a date was imputed\nas the midpoint of the year or the month of death. Conse-\nriod. Those who had refused the interview survey were\ntreated as censored (6.0%; n = 291). A total follow-up pe-\nriod was 25 years (13.8 years of average follow-up per\nparticipant).\nMeasures\nHeight and weight were self-reported at each wave (waves\n1\u00ad7), and BMI was calculated from these self-reported values\naccording to accepted formula as specified above. Age, sex,\nmarital status, current working status, education, annual\nhousehold income, health behaviors, and health status at\nbaseline were incorporated as covariates in the present study.\nHealth behaviors included the number of cigarettes smoked\nper day, the number of drinking days per month, and fre-\nquency of exercise.\nHealth status was measured by chronic diseases, self-\nrated health, and functional status. The number of physician-\ndiagnosed chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease,\nstroke, lung disease, liver disease, and kidney disease, was\nreported by the respondents. Self-rated poor health was mea-\nsured by a 3-item composite with a score ranging from 3 to 15\n(Cronbach's  = 0.84); a high score indicates poor health. Fi-\nnally, functional status entailed a sum of difficulties with 6\nactivities of daily living (ADLs) (i.e., dressing, walking,\nbathing or showering, eating, getting in or out of bed, and\nusing the toilet) and 5 instrumental ADLs (i.e., grocery shop-\nping, phone calls, climbing stairs, walking a few blocks, and\ntraveling by bus or train). All items were scored by either a 4-\nor 5-point scale. With appropriate adjustment, scores for this\nhigh score reflects greater functional disability. The measure\nfor ADLs in 1987 (wave 1) consisted of only1 item (i.e., bath-\ning or showering), whereas ADLs were measured by 6 items\nmogenize the 1-item ADL measure collected in 1987 with\nthe 6-item ADLs measure taken after 1987, we imputed the\nvalues of the 6-item ADLs measure for those who had only\nview of the fact that the 1-item ADL measure is highly cor-\nrelated with the 6-item ADLs measure (r = 0.92).\nStatistical analysis\nWe used group-based mixture models with maximum like-\nlihood estimation to identify distinct trajectories of changes\nin BMI (25). As recommended, the best-fitting model (i.e.,\nthe number of distinct trajectories) was chosen on the basis\nof Bayesian Information Criterion scores and an examination\nof 95% confidence intervals (19). We estimated models with\n2\u00ad5 trajectories by assuming linear, quadratic, and cubic pat-\nterns of change in BMI over time, using the SAS PROC\nTRAJprogram(SASInstitute,Inc.,Cary,NorthCarolina).We\nselected the best-fitting model by comparing the Bayesian In-\nformation Criterion indices associated with various solutions\nand the average posterior probabilities of group membership,\nand by evaluating whether successive models identified addi-\ntional distinct groups as indicated by nonoverlapping confi-\ndence intervals.\nIn this study, the time from baseline was used as the time\nscalebecausedifferentbirthcohortswereobservedatdifferent\nages; thus, cohort and age effects were highly confounded.\nMoreover, the time-based approach seems to best capture our\nTable 1.

To control for possible effects of precipitated\nweight loss prior to death on baseline BMI, we undertook ad-\nditional analyses excluding people whose death occurred\nwithin a year from baseline. Furthermore, to rule out the con-\nfounding effects of smoking, physical activity, and chronic\ndiseases on BMI and mortality, we conducted parallel analy-\nses of selected subgroups: noncurrent smokers, physically ac-\ntive individuals, and those without a history of cardiovascular\ndisease, stroke, lung disease, liverdisease, and kidney disease.\nThe results were expressed as hazard ratios with 95% confi-\ndence intervals. The analyses were performed by using the\nSAS PROC PHREG program (SAS Institute, Inc.).\nInitial descriptive analysis of the individual variables in\nthis study indicated that, with the exception of household in-\ncome with 35.3% missing data, the proportion of cases with\nmissing data on the remaining items ranged from 0% to 8.6%.\nAlthough PROC TRAJ assumes a missing-at-random mecha-\nnism, this is not the case for the Cox regression analysis. With-\nout imputation, it may lead to a serious loss of cases in the Cox\nregression analysis. To minimize the potential bias associated\nwith item nonresponse, we used multiple imputation for miss-\ning data (26), by using an inclusive strategy with not only var-\niables included in our analytical models but also auxiliary\nvariables not included in our analysis (27). Examples of aux-\niliary variables included social support, depressive symptoms,\nand follow-up measures of the predictors in the Cox regression\nanalysis, which were measured at baseline. In particular, 3\ncomplete data sets were imputed with NORM freeware (avail-\nable from Springer International Publishing AG, Cham, Swit-\nzerkand), and analyses were run on each of these 3 data sets\nwith parameter estimates derived by averaging across 3 impu-\ntations and by adjusting for their variance. The imputation pro-\ncedure was performed for surviving participants temporally by\nremoving participants after death. Both group-based mixture\nmodels and the Cox proportional hazard model were con-\nducted by using the imputed data sets.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents the sample descriptive characteristics at\nFigure 1 illustrates the BMI trajectories derived from\ngroup-based mixture models, whereas Table 2 shows the in-\ntercept and linear slope of each trajectory.

Because the results based\non the imputed data and nonimputed data were quite similar,\nwe have chosen to present the results based on the imputed\ndata.\nTable 3 presents the baseline characteristics of the 4 trajec-\ntory subgroups. The subgroup following the \"low-normal\nweight, decreasing\" trajectory had the highest mean age among\nthe 4 subgroups; approximately 70% in the \"overweight, sta-\nble\" subgroup and roughly 50% in the \"mid-normal weight,\ndecreasing\" subgroup were female.\nTable 4 shows the mortality hazard ratios for each BMI tra-\njectory subgroup, with the \"mid-normal weight, decreasing\"\ntrajectory subgroup as reference.

In particular, we\nfound 4 distinct BMI trajectories over a period of 19 years\namong older Japanese. Three of them had a baseline BMI with-\nin a normal range (i.e., low-, mid-, and high-normal weight)\nthat decreased over time. The fourth trajectory started at a\nlevel of overweight and remained unchanged over time. Our\nresearch provides new evidence that the trajectories of BMI\nand their linkages with mortality differ between Western\nand Asian populations.\nThe findings are quite striking in view of earlier observa-\ntions on BMI trajectories in middle and old age based on US\nolder Americans, trajectories of overweight and obesity often\naccount for 70%\u00ad80% of the sample, whereas a little over 5%\nof older Japanese in our analysis were identified as following\na stable overweight trajectory. Furthermore, among older\nJapanese, BMI changes primarily lie within the normal-\n24% of older Japanese followed a trajectory of \"low-normal\nweight, decreasing\" that started with a BMI of 18.7 and de-\ncreased to 17.8 over 19 years. Therefore, older Japanese dif-\nfer from older Americans not only in terms of the weight\ndistribution at a single point in time but also in the patterns\nof weight changes over time. Of the 4 BMI trajectories iden-\ntified among older Japanese, those characterized by higher\nbody-weight levels were associated with lower mortality.\nThe \"low-normal weight, decreasing\" subgroup had the high-\nest mortality risk, followed by the \"mid-normal weight, de-\ncreasing,\" the \"high-normal weight, decreasing,\" and the\n\"overweight, stable\" subgroups. This is consistent with prior\nobservations showing that weight loss in underweight indi-\nviduals is associated with an increased mortality risk than in\nnormal-weight or overweight/obese individuals (1, 9, 14).\nDecreasing body weight is often accompanied by an accumu-\nlation of muscle or bone loss (31, 32). This might represent a\nreduced ability to maintain energy balance, which shares\nmany immunological and neuroendocrine features of disease-\nassociated wasting syndromes (33).\nOver the period of our observation, changes in BMI were\nrelatively small, and these trajectories were relatively parallel.\nIn contrast to the general population, older populations tend\nto have a reverse J-shaped or L-shaped association of BMI\nwith all-cause mortality (34\u00ad36), which was also found in\nJapanese studies (37\u00ad39). These studies report that under-\nweight is an important predictor of mortality, while overweight\nhas the lowest mortality risk in old age. This has been referred\nto as the \"obesity paradox\" (40). This might be due to energy\nand nutritional reserves, as malnutrition is known to be a pre-\ndictor of all-cause mortality (41, 42). Thin people with less\nenergy and nutritional reserves are less resistant to infection\n(43). In fact, thinness is associated with a higher risk of\nrespiratory disease than is normal weight among older Japa-\nnese (38). In addition, there is some evidence that stable over-\nweight is associated with a low risk of death (1, 8, 10). Extra\nbody weight may provide protection against nutritional and\nenergy deficiencies and the loss of muscle and bone.\nTherefore, it would be reasonable to conclude that the sub-\ngroup with low-normal but decreasing weight had the highest\nmortality risk, while the subgroup with stable overweight had\nthe lowest mortality risk among the 4 trajectory subgroups.\nThere have been only 2 US studies to date examining the link-\nages between BMI trajectories and mortality in old age (20,\n21), both of which suggested that those who were overweight\nbut stable had the highest survival rate. This is consistent with\nour findings from this Japanese population. More importantly,\naccording to our results, even a small or moderate weight loss\namong those with a normal BMI may have a deleterious effect\non health. Hence, both BMI at baseline and its changes over\ntime are important in predicting the risk of death. Accordingly,\nfor older Japanese, a greater clinical and public health empha-\nsis should be placed on preventing weight loss, rather than on\ncombating overweight and obesity.\nAmong noncurrent smokers in model 2b, the association\nbetween BMI trajectories and mortality became nonsignifi-\ncant. This suggests an effect modification of smoking on the\nassociation. Smoking is known to be associated with a lower\nBMI trajectory in old age (44) and to reduce life expectancy (45).\nOur findings revealed that the association between BMI trajec-\ntories and mortality existed among noncurrent smokers only.\nA major strength of this research lies in its longitudinal\ndata derived from a national probability sample of older Jap-\nanese over a 19-year period. Many previous studies used an a\npriori categorization of the levels and changes in BMI and ex-\namined its relationship with mortality. We applied a person-\ncentered approach (19), which provided a strong empirical\nsupport to identify distinct BMI trajectories in older Japanese\nand to assess differences in mortality risk between these tra-\njectories. Our research yields important new information re-\ngarding the trajectories of BMI among older Japanese and\nhow they are associated with mortality, and it suggests that\npriorities for weight control in old age may well differ be-\ntween Japan and the United States.\nThe present study has several limitations. First, BMI was\ncalculated from self-reported measures of height and weight.\nAs people tend to overreport their height and underreport\ntheir weight (46\u00ad48) and heavier people tend to underreport\ntheir weight more than thinner people (46), the BMI may have\nbeen underestimated, particularly among overweight individ-\nuals. This could bias the estimated pattern of BMI trajectories.\nMeanwhile, as there is a possibility that people underestimate\ntheir current weight due to the factors related to mortality\n(e.g., chronic disease progression), the findings of this study\nshould be carefully interpreted. Second, our approach to model\nchange in BMI by time since baseline in group-based mixture\nmodels fails to distinguish between age effects and period\neffects (49). Although we understand the pitfalls of this ap-\nproach, the alternative age-based approach fails to distinguish\nbetween age effects and cohort effects (49). We favored the\ntime-based approach because it seems to best capture our in-\nterest in describing distinct patterns of change in BMI over\ntime among Japanese older adults that could then be used\nBMI Trajectories and Mortality in Older Japanese 603\nto predict mortality. Moreover, in the mortality analysis, we\nadjusted for baseline age and entry wave. Third, we did not\ndistinguish between intentional and unintentional weight\nchanges. Several studies have reported that, for equivalent\namounts of weight loss, unintentional loss was associated\nwith a higher mortality risk compared with intentional loss\n(50\u00ad52). By differentiating between these 2 types of weight\nchange, we believe that a better understanding of the factors\nunderlying the association between BMI trajectories and\nmortality may emerge. Nonetheless, we adjusted for base-\nline health status that may partially account for unintentional\nweight loss. Fourth, there is the possibility that diseases other\nthan the 5 diseases we adjusted for in the analysis confound\nthe association between body weight and mortality. History\nof cancer is a possible confounding factor but was not in-\ncluded in the calculation of the health status variable because\nthis question was not included in wave 1. This was because,\nin the 1980s Japanese culture, physicians were often reluctant\nto inform a patient of a diagnosis of cancer (53). We under-\ntook a sensitivity analysis by running the same survival anal-\nyses, including an imputed variable of history of cancer in the\nmodel, and obtained results similar to those reported in this\nstudy.\nIn conclusion, this research provides new insights concern-\ning the complex dynamic linkages between BMI and mortality\nin old age in Japan. In contrast with prior observations made in\nWestern populations, our research identified a downward tra-\njectory at the border between normal weight and underweight\nsubgroups, which characterized a significant proportion of\nolder Japanese (i.e., the \"low-normal weight, decreasing\" sub-\ngroup). This trajectory was associated with the highest risk of\nmortality among the 4 trajectories identified in this study. At\nthe same time, we found a trajectory of stable overweight that\ncharacterized a small proportion of older Japanese who had the\nlowest risk of death, which is similar to the results described\nearlier in Western populations (20, 21). Our research suggests\nthat, in later life, a trajectory of low and declining BMI poses a\nsignificant risk for survival; this finding could inform clinical\nand public health approaches to body-weight management\naimed to improve the health and survival of older adults, par-\nticularly in Asian populations.\n"
