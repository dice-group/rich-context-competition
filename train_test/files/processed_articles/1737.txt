Design and Methods: The baseline survey of\ndirect care workers (N \u00bc 3,468) conducted as part of\nthe National Study of the Better Jobs Better Care\ndemonstration asked the following: ``What is the single\nmost important thing your employer could do to improve\nyour job as a direct care worker?'' We coded the open-\nended responses and grouped them into categories.\nWe then compared the percentages of workers recom-\nmending changes in these categories across settings\nand interpreted them in the context of previous\nconceptual frameworks. Results: Across settings,\nworkers called for more pay and better work relation-\nships including communication; supervision; and being\nappreciated, listened to, and treated with respect. The\nfraction of workers calling for these changes and\nadditional specific changes differed substantially across\nnursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and home\ncare agencies. Implications: To increase retention of\nfrontline workers, policy makers should design public\npolicies and management practices to increase pay and\nto improve work relationships. However, specific\nstrategies should differ across settings.\nKey Words: Workforce, Long-term care,\nSkilled nursing facility, Assisted living facility,\nHome care, Culture change.\nThe long-term care industry has difficulty recruiting\nand retaining direct care workers--the certified nursing\nassistants, home health aides, and personal care work-\ners who provide the bulk of long-term care. With the\nimpending growth in demand for these workers as the\npopulation ages, this difficulty is expected to increase.\nThe U.S. Department of Labor projects that by 2012,\nthe number of home health aide jobs will increase by\n48% and the number of nursing aide, orderly, and\nattendant jobs will increase by 24%, putting these\namong the occupations with the largest job growth\nMany believe that better management practices, im-\nplemented as part of a broader organizational ``culture\nchange,'' can improve the quality of the jobs, reduce\nturnover, and ultimately improve the quality of care pro-\nvided (Stone, Dawson, & Harahan, 2003). Yet among\nthe many options that exist, researchers do not know\nwhat changes would improve direct care workers' jobs.\nWe approached this question by analyzing direct\ncare workers' own statements about what would im-\nprove their jobs and assessing the implications for\nmanagement practice and public policy. Specifically,\nwe address two questions: (a) What do direct care\nworkers say is the most important thing that employers\ncould do to improve their jobs? and (b) Do workers'\nrecommendations vary across nursing facilities, assisted\nliving facilities, and home care agencies?\nBackground\nDirect care workers provide the bulk of long-term\ncare. Despite their importance, they often provide care\nunder stressful working conditions, do not have\nopportunities for career advancement, and are among\nThis research was supported by The Atlantic Philanthropies and The\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation as part of the National Study of\nthe Better Jobs Better Care Demonstration.

Given\nthe nature of direct care jobs, it is not surprising that\nlong-term care providers have difficulty recruiting and\nretaining direct care workers. High turnover can be\ncostly to consumers (Dawson & Surpin, 2001), workers\n(Mickus, Luz, & Hogan, 2004), and providers (Seavey,\n2004). High turnover also may lead to disruptions in\ncontinuity of care for residents and clients (Dawson &\nSurpin, 2001) and poor quality of care (Castle &\nA number of recent workforce initiatives have\nsought to improve the jobs of direct care workers in\nlong-term care (Harris-Kojetin, Lipson, Fielding,\ninitiatives was the Better Jobs Better Care (BJBC)\ndemonstration (BJBC, 2002). It was designed to test\ninnovative policies and management practices intended\nto improve the quality of direct care jobs and improve\nrecruitment and retention of direct care workers.\nIn response to a competitive request for proposals,\nthe demonstration selected nonprofit agencies leading\ncoalitions of stakeholders in five states--Iowa, North\nCarolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Vermont--to\nparticipate in a 3-year demonstration of a variety of\npolicy initiatives and management practice interven-\ntions. The five BJBC projects selected provider\norganizations (including nursing facilities, assisted\nliving facilities, home care agencies, and adult day\nservice providers) to implement changes in manage-\nment practices designed to improve direct care workers'\njobs. (For additional background on the demonstra-\ntion, see Kemper, Brannon, Barry, Stott, & Heier, this\nissue; Stone & Dawson, this issue.)\nAn evaluation of the demonstration analyzed the\neffects of the management practice interventions on\ndirect care worker turnover, job satisfaction, and other\nmeasures of job quality. Data were collected at baseline\nand at follow-up at the end of the project. Data sources\nincluded an information system that collected hiring\nand termination data and surveys of clinical managers,\nsupervisors, and direct care workers. This article\nanalyzes the responses to an open-ended question in\nthe baseline survey of direct care workers about what\nemployers could do to improve their jobs.\nPrevious Research\nPrevious research includes empirical studies of direct\ncare workers' reports about their jobs and theoretical\nframeworks developed to understand the relationship\nbetween management practices and worker outcomes.\nDirect Care Workers' Perspective\nThree published studies asked direct care workers\nopen-ended questions about their jobs. Bowers,\ncare workers in nursing facilities about what their job\nwas like and what led them to feel unappreciated. The\nauthors classified direct care workers' responses as\nprofessional minimizing (devaluing their skill), per-\nsonal minimizing (attacking their character), and\nprofessional and personal leveling (inability to distin-\nguish workers based on their skills and their characters,\nrespectively). Management practices identified as min-\nimizing were rotation of direct care workers off of their\nusual floors, use of pool staff, low wages, and poor\nrelationships with supervisors.\nEaton (1997) interviewed direct care workers in\ndepth as part of her research on the link between\nquality of jobs and quality of care in nursing facilities.\nWorkers in low-quality nursing facilities identified lack\nof recognition and respect as problems. They also felt\nthat their jobs entailed too little teamwork, inadequate\nsupplies, too much work, too many patients, and too\nmuch paperwork.\nAs part of a study on supervisor relationships in\nnursing facilities, McGilton, Hall, Pringle, O'Brien-\nPallas, and Krejci (2004) also interviewed direct care\nworkers. They identified personal and professional\nfactors that affected whether supervisors displayed\nsupportive behaviors. These factors included the\nsupervisor's attitude and personality, teamwork, mu-\ntual support, breadth of knowledge, ability to delegate,\nand willingness to share information.\nThree other studies were reported in four un-\npublished state reports. The Nursing Home Commu-\nnity Coalition of New York State (2003) used a\ncombination of focus groups and questionnaires to\nask direct care workers in nursing facilities what\nfactors contributed to poor working conditions. The\nworkers' most frequent responses were staff shortages,\nlack of teamwork among the staff, not being treated\nwith respect, not having trusting relationships with\nresidents and families, not having the tools to do the\njob, not having a good relationship with supervisors,\nand not being informed of changes before they are\nmade. The Pennsylvania Intra-Governmental Council\ngroups with 167 direct care workers in a variety of\nlong-term care settings. The factors direct care workers\nidentified as leading to turnover included staff short-\nages, difficulty of the job, lack of appreciation by the\norganization, low wages, and lack of training. Finally,\nMickus and colleagues (2004) reported on a mail survey\nof 1,100 current and former direct care workers in nurs-\ning facilities and home health agencies in Michigan.\nWorkers at both nursing facilities and home health\nagencies mentioned low pay, not feeling valued, and\npersonal health concerns as the top factors leading\nworkers to leave direct care work. In addition, nursing\nfacility workers were more likely to mention too many\npatients, the inability to provide quality care, and\nunsafe conditions, whereas home health workers were\nmore likely to cite not being able to work enough hours\nand dissatisfaction with their work schedules.\nThis study extends previous research in two respects\nby analyzing a large sample of direct care workers from\nfive states. First, to identify desired changes in manage-\nment practices, we focused on workers' assessments of\nwhat changes employers could make to improve direct\ncare jobs rather than on the problems in the jobs.\nSecond, we extend research beyond nursing facilities by\n18  \ncomparing responses of workers in nursing facilities,\nassisted living facilities, and home care agencies to\nidentify possible differences in desired management\npractices across settings.\nTheoretical Frameworks\nResearchers have developed numerous management\ntheories to explain what factors affect employee job\nsatisfaction and performance (see Kreitner & Kinicki,\n1998). Two of the most well known are those of\nHerzberg, Mausner, and Snyderman (1959) and\nHackman and Oldham (1980). Although used widely\nin research, these theories have two limitations for this\nanalysis: (a) They consider factors well beyond changes\nmanagement can make; and (b) they are designed to\napply across a wide range of skill levels and industries,\nnot specifically to long-term care. The long-term care\nindustry differs from many others in its dominant public\nfinancing, vulnerable frail or cognitively impaired\n``customers,'' and difficult-to-measure quality. How-\nmanagement and industrial relations theories to develop\nframeworks specifically for nursing facilities. Both\nframeworks focus on management change from the\norganization's perspective rather than the worker's\nperspective as this analysis does. Although Eaton and\nHunter conceptualized their frameworks quite differ-\nently, many of the specific factors they identified are\nthe same.\nresource management practices and their relation to\nquality of care. Based on the case studies, she identified\nhuman resource practices (e.g., staffing, wages and\nbenefits, hiring and selection, and training) and work\norganization (e.g., teams, work assignments, worker\ninput) as factors affecting quality of care.\nHunter (2000) analyzed the determinants of job\nquality using data from a survey of Massachusetts\nnursing facilities. His framework identified three\nfactors that define high-quality jobs: wages and\nbenefits, opportunities for advancement (e.g., training,\ntuition reimbursement, and formal promotion pro-\ngrams), and new forms of work organization (e.g.,\nteams and employee involvement).\nA limitation of both frameworks for this study is\ntheir specific focus on nursing facilities. Nursing\nfacilities, assisted living facilities, and home care\nproviders differ in ways that affect the nature of direct\ncare jobs. Understanding three fundamental differences\nis necessary to interpret differences across settings in\nworkers' recommendations for management changes.\nFirst, care provision in facilities differs from that in\nhomes. Compared with home care, in facility-based\ncare the facility is the center of responsibility for and\ncontrol of care, interaction with supervisors and\ncoworkers is frequent and in person, the work of one\naffects coworkers, workers care for multiple residents,\nand staffing levels affect all workers. Because home\ncare is provided one-on-one to specific clients in their\ngeographically dispersed homes, workers have greater\nautonomy; scheduling regular, full-time shifts is dif-\nficult; and responsibility for scheduling and clinical\nsupervision can be split between two supervisors.\nSecond, the acuity of persons receiving care affects\nthe intensity of direct care staffing and supervision\nneeded, and the importance of clinical skills and super-\nvision. Typically, the acuity of residents in nursing\nfacilities is greater than in assisted living. Although\nresident care needs vary widely across individuals\nreceiving home care, acuity is typically lower than in\nnursing facilities.\nFinally, government payment and regulation affect\nsettings in different ways. Most nursing facilities rely\nheavily on Medicaid reimbursements. Low Medicaid\nreimbursement rates constrain the financial resources of\nthese facilities compared with: (a) many assisted living\nfacilities, which typically rely more on private pay-\nments; and (b) home care, which relies on both Medi-\ncare and Medicaid. Nursing facilities also are more\nheavily regulated than other provider types, which can\nlead to more formal organizational structures, greater\ntraining requirements, and less flexibility to innovate.\nMethods\nUsing the baseline survey of direct care workers in\nBJBC, we coded responses to an open-ended question\nabout employer changes that would improve workers'\njobs and grouped these responses into categories. We\nthen compared the percentages of workers recommend-\ning changes in these categories across types of\nproviders.\nSample\nThe population of interest for the study was all\ndirect care workers at providers participating in BJBC.\nA direct care worker was defined as follows:\nAn individual who provides hands-on personal care\n(e.g., assistance with bathing, dressing, transferring\nand feeding) as a significant part of their job at\na nursing facility, home health agency, assisted\nliving organization, adult day center or other\npersonal care organization. Although activities\nmay sometimes overlap, we do not include licensed\npractical nurses or registered nurses in this defini-\ntion. Also excluded are workers who help with\ncleaning, meal preparation and chores, but do not\nprovide personal care. Typical job titles include\nnurse aide, home health aide, and personal care\nattendant. However, direct care workers are not\nlimited to these job titles (Kemper, Brannon, &\nWe identified workers from an information system\ndeveloped to provide turnover information to partici-\npating providers (Barry, Kemper, & Brannon, in press).\nThe information system tracks hiring, termination, and\nother information about direct care workers employed\nby participating providers. Upon enrollment in the\ndemonstration, each provider submitted a list of all\ncurrently employed direct care workers. Each provider\nupdated the information system at the end of each pay\nperiod with any changes that had occurred since the\nlast update.\nOnce a provider enrolled, surveys were sent to a list\nof all of its direct care workers, which was extracted\nfrom the information system. Because the list was of\ncurrent workers, the data do not reflect the perspectives\nof workers who quit or were fired. Because providers\nenrolled over time, baseline data collection extended\nA total of 3,468 direct care workers completed the\nsurvey. Because the number of workers in adult day\nservice providers (n \u00bc 54) was too small to analyze sep-\narately, we excluded them from the analysis, leaving a\nysis. Reflecting differences in the number of providers\nparticipating in BJBC, sample sizes varied by state,\nwith the largest being from North Carolina (n \u00bc 1,741),\nThe providers included skilled nursing facilities (n \u00bc\n53), assisted living facilities (n \u00bc 33), and home care\nagencies (n \u00bc 36). Because the study was based on\nproviders that volunteered to participate in BJBC, it is\nnot representative of all providers. For example, three\nfifths of BJBC providers were nonprofit organizations.\nAbout a third of the home care providers were\ncertified home health agencies, and the other two thirds\nwere home care providers that typically provided\nnonskilled care (sometimes in combination with skilled\ncare). Assisted living facilities as used here includes\na range of types of residences that generally provide\nmeals and personal care but not necessarily skilled care.\nHan, Sirrocco, and Remsburg (2003) referred to these\nas long-term care residential places. These facilities\nhave different names depending on the state (e.g.,\nassisted living facilities, personal care homes, adult care\nhomes, and residential care). The BJBC providers in\nthis category were diverse. They included, for example,\nassisted living residences that were part of continuing\ncare retirement communities paid for privately, and\nadult care homes paid for largely through a combina-\ntion of Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid.\nAs expected, the vast majority of direct care workers\nin our sample were high school educated women (see\nTable 1). Most other characteristics differed across\nsettings. The median hourly wage was highest in\nnursing facilities ($10.34) and lowest in home care\n($8.25). Health insurance benefits followed a similar\npattern: Nursing facilities had the highest proportion of\nworkers offered health insurance and the highest\nproportion enrolled, and home care agencies had the\nlowest proportions. Many workers in BJBC had long\ncareers in direct caregiving: The median direct care\nworker in nursing facilities had spent 7.0 years as\na direct care worker and 2.8 years at their current\nemployer, compared with 5.7 and 2.0 years in home\ncare, with assisted living falling in between. More than\ntwo fifths of the sample was older than age 45, with\nhome care having the oldest workers and nursing\nfacilities the youngest.\nThe overall response rate for the survey was 54%.\nResponse rates were higher among workers who had\nworked at the provider longer, in smaller organiza-\ntions, in Vermont and Oregon, and in home care\nagencies and adult day service providers. To adjust for\nthese differences, we reweighted the respondent sample\nso that the distribution of the sample matched the\npopulation distribution on these characteristics.\nDirect Care Worker Survey\nThe survey was an 8-page self-administered paper\nbooklet. It included questions about length of employ-\nment, job satisfaction, job rewards and problems,\nsupervision, perceptions of quality of care, job\nconfidence, training, intent to quit, and demographic\ncharacteristics. Personalized packets including a survey,\ninformed consent, a $2 bill, and a business reply\nenvelope for all direct care workers were sent to the\nprovider for distribution. The incentive was given up\nfront to everyone because of evidence that it increases\nTable 1. Characteristics of Direct Care Workers\nCharacteristic Nursing Facilities Assisted Living Home Care All n\nHealth insurance, %\nYears employed, Mdn (SE)\nNotes: Sample sizes differ slightly across characteristics because we excluded missing data from our analyses. The maximum percentage of cases\naIncludes Hispanic, African American, and Native American.\n20  \nresponse rates more than incentives paid later only to\nRespondents returned the surveys in the business\nreply envelopes. Responses were tracked using identi-\nfication numbers on each survey. To increase response\nrates, workers received a follow-up packet about\na month after the initial packets were distributed. To\nensure that the employer did not know who the\nnonrespondents were, everyone from the original list\nreceived a follow-up packet. For nonrespondents, the\nfollow-up mailing included another copy of the survey\nand reply envelope. Those who had already responded\nreceived a thank you letter and a copy of a BJBC\nnewsletter. The second administration increased the\nresponse rate by 10 to 15 percentage points.\nCoding and Analysis\nWe obtained direct care workers' recommendations\nfor improving their jobs from responses to the following\nopen-ended question: ``What is the single most impor-\ntant thing your employer could do to improve your job\nas a direct care worker?'' The advantage of open-ended\nsurvey questions is that they allow respondents to fully\nexpress their response, providing more in-depth in-\nformation than closed-ended questions (Bradburn,\nSudman, & Wansink, 2004). Although the analysis of\nrecommendations obtained by asking workers directly\nis a strength of this study, we should note that their\nrecommendations may not have recognized constraints\nmanagement faces or changes they are not familiar\nwith. In addition, by asking for the single most\nimportant change, the question did not allow for the\npossibility of indirect or interactive effects or give any\nweight to secondary recommendations.\nWe reviewed the text responses to the question and\nidentified themes based on recurring words (or\nsynonyms) in the responses. For example, we identified\na communication theme based on responses such as\n``better communication'' and ``keep communication\nopen,'' but we also included responses like ``keep us\ninformed of changes'' in that category (see Table 2).\nWe then developed written criteria for 16 categories\nTable 2.

Most workers\n(79%) gave a response that fell into a single category.\nWhen a respondent provided more than one recom-\nmendation, we coded the first one, recognizing that this\nmay not have been the most important in all cases.\nTo assess reliability a second investigator coded the\nresponses independently based on the written criteria.\nThe second coder agreed on 90% of the detailed\ncategories and 94% of the aggregate categories.\nWe estimated the weighted mean percentage of\nworkers making each type of recommendation and\ncompared the means across the three types of providers.\nWhen comparing settings, we tested the statistical\nsignificance of the difference for each pair of provider\ntypes using a t test with a Bonferroni correction for\nmultiple testing.\nResults\nDirect Care Workers' Recommendations for\nImproving Their Jobs\nNot all workers made a recommendation for\nimproving their jobs. This group had two subcatego-\nries: a smaller group whose responses indicated that\nthey were satisfied with their jobs, and a larger group\nthat did not respond to the question. Direct care\nworkers in home care were least likely to make\na recommendation: 37% of home care workers made\nno recommendation compared with 24% in assisted\nliving and 20% in nursing facilities (see Table 3).\nThose not making a recommendation presumably\neither did not take time to respond, were happy with\ntheir job, or were unable to identify a change that would\nimprove their jobs. As a group, those not making\na recommendation were more satisfied with their job\nthan those making a recommendation. For example, in\nnursing facilities, based on responses to a separate survey\nquestion about job satisfaction, 39% of workers who did\nnot make a recommendation said they were extremely\nsatisfied with their job compared with only 22% of those\nmaking recommendations (data not shown).\nIncreased Compensation.--Many workers called\nfor increased compensation, including more pay, better\nbenefits, or the opportunity to work more hours.\nWorkers in home care (39%) and assisted living\nfacilities (36%) were much more likely to say that\nincreasing compensation was the single most important\nthing that employers could do to improve their jobs\nthan workers in nursing facilities (23%). The differ-\nences were even more dramatic among workers who\nmade a recommendation: 63% of home care workers\nidentified compensation compared with 47% in assisted\nliving and 29% in nursing facilities (data not shown).\nIn all three settings, most workers who mentioned\nTable 3. Direct Care Worker Recommendations by Provider Type\nPercent Making Recommendation\nType of Recommendation Nursing Facilities Assisted Living Home Care All Number Recommending\nNotes: We performed a Bonferroni correction and used an adjusted p value of .0169 to determine significance at the .05 level.\naDifference from Assisted living facility is statistically significant at the .05 level.\nhDifference from Home care is statistically significant at the .05 level.\nnDifference from Nursing facility is statistically significant at the .05 level.\n22  \ncompensation called for increased pay; much smaller\npercentages identified improved fringe benefits or the\nopportunity to work more hours. Consistent with their\nlower percentage with employer-sponsored insurance,\nhome care workers stood out as more likely to call for\nbetter fringe benefits than workers in facilities. They also\nwere more likely to identify being able to work more\nhours as important. This reflects the difficulty of sched-\nuling consistent, full-time work given turnover among\nclients and the complexity of matching clients with\nworkers within a reasonable distance of their home.\nImproved Work Relationships.--The work relation-\nship category included a range of responses grouped\ninto six subcategories. The language used more often\nwas personalized and suggested greater intensity of\npersonal concern in three subcategories: listening (e.g.,\n``listen to what I say''), appreciation (e.g., ``care about\nus''), and respect (e.g., ``treat us with respect'').\nAlthough often not explicit, many of the responses\nappeared to refer to treatment by supervisors and may\nhave reflected the culture of the organization. The\nlanguage used in the other three subcategories--\nimproved communication, better supervision, and\nmore teamwork--tended to be less personalized.\nWork relationships appeared to be of greatest con-\ncern in nursing facilities and of least concern in home\ncare, with assisted living in between. In all, 24% of\nworkers in nursing facilities mentioned work relation-\nships compared with 19% in assisted living and 11% in\nhome care. The high percentage in nursing facilities is\nconsistent with the frequent interactions with peers and\nmore intensive supervision in this setting. Of the six\nsubcategories, direct care workers in nursing and\nassisted living facilities most often listed improving\nsupervision. The three subcategories about how work-\ners are treated (which, as indicated, at least partly reflect\nsupervisory behavior) also were more often mentioned\nin nursing facilities: 11% of direct care workers in\nnursing facilities called for appreciation, respect, or\nbeing listened to, compared with only 7% of workers in\nassisted living and 4% in home care. Although\nworkers in home care mentioned work relationships\nleast often overall, they called for improved communi-\ncation more often than other aspects of work relation-\nships. This is consistent with the greater difficulty of\ncommunicating with workers not on site.\nImproved Staffing.--Workers in nursing facilities\nidentified hiring more or better staff more often than\nany other major recommendation category and more\noften than workers in any other setting. In all, 25% of\nworkers in nursing facilities identified staffing com-\npared with 10% of workers in assisted living and\nalmost none in home care. That home care workers do\nnot identify increased staffing is not surprising given\nthat their own work is largely unaffected by the\naggregate staffing in the organization. The lower\npercentage in assisted living than nursing facilities\nmay reflect the lower acuity of assisted living residents\nor the higher level of staffing relative to care needs.\nImproved Management Systems.--This category\nincluded recommendations concerning the purchase or\nmaintenance of equipment, the availability of training\nand continuing education opportunities, the process of\nsetting employees' work schedules, and a variety of\nmiscellaneous changes in work processes. Improving\nmanagement systems was suggested by a minority of\ndirect care workers ranging from 8% in nursing\nfacilities to 12% in home care. Within the broad\ncategory, workers in home care and assisted living\ncalled for increased training more often than nursing\nfacility workers--likely due to regulatory requirements\nfor training in nursing facilities. Compared with\nworkers in facility-based settings, home care workers\nrecommended improved scheduling more often, reflect-\ning the greater difficulty of scheduling in home care.\nWorker Recommendations in the Context\nof Theoretical Frameworks\nIn their theoretical frameworks, Eaton (2000) and\nHunter (2000) identified many of the categories of\nmanagement changes that workers identified. Both\nidentified pay and benefits, worker input (which\ncorresponds to listening), and training. However, they\nalso identified changes that workers did not: organiza-\ntion in teams (both), work assignments (Eaton), formal\npromotion programs (Hunter), tuition reimbursement\n(Hunter), and selection (although a few workers iden-\ntified hiring better workers) and recruitment (Eaton).\nWorkers' failure to mention them is not surprising\nbecause workers are unlikely to have experienced such\npractices or, in the case of recruitment and selection,\nthey may not feel that this affects their own jobs.\nAt the same time, workers identified some changes\nnot identified in the two frameworks. Most important\nare the many dimensions of work relationships: respect,\nappreciation, listening, teamwork, communication, and\nsupervision. The frameworks also did not identify\nworking more hours (which home care workers called\nfor). This is not surprising given that Eaton and Hunter\ndeveloped the frameworks for nursing facilities.\nDiscussion\nTwo changes that direct care workers identified as\nthe single most important thing their employers could\ndo to improve their jobs were common across nursing\nfacilities, assisted living, and home care. Workers in all\nthree settings called for two changes: (a) more pay and\n(b) improved work relationships.\nIt is the differences across the three settings, however,\nthat stand out in what workers said. For example,\nalthough workers in all types of providers mentioned\nincreased pay and improved work relationships as\nimportant, the fraction of workers doing so varied\ngreatly across settings. Moreover, workers in different\nsettings differed with respect to the specific subcategories\nofrecommendationstheyemphasized.Asaconsequence,\nalthough some policies and management strategies for\nimproving jobs apply across the board, some different\nones will be needed depending on the setting.\nImplications for Management\nWe base our discussion on averages across providers,\nfocusing on recommendations made most often in each\nsetting, under the assumption that they are most\nimportant for managers in general. However, what is\nrelevant to a particular provider will differ depending\non the provider's particular circumstances. Because\nwhat workers say generally may not apply to specific\nproviders, a good place for managers to start in deciding\nhow to improve jobs is by asking their own workers.\nOur findings are also averages across workers.\nBecause what is most important varies across workers,\nno one type of management change will improve every\ndirect care worker's job. Thus, improving jobs is likely\nto require a multipronged strategy of management\npractice changes.\nNursing Facilities.--Increasing staffing stands out\nas a priority for management change in nursing\nfacilities--it was workers' most frequently mentioned\nchange. Another priority should be improving work\nrelationships--especially supervision and whether\nworkers are appreciated, listened to, and treated with\nrespect. Improving relationships through training in\ncommunication, supervision, and team building; peer\nmentoring; and greater involvement of direct care\nworkers in care management decisions are promising\nmanagement practices that were tested in BJBC.\nIncreasing pay appears to be the third most important\nchange that would improve workers' jobs.\nAssisted Living Facilities.--Increasing pay stands\nout as a change managers in assisted living should focus\non--a third of workers said increasing pay is the most\nimportant change employers could make. Managers\nshould also take steps to improve supervision, as well\nas other work relationships. Finally, providing more\ntraining and increasing staffing are additional changes\nworkers identified that management should consider.\nHome Care Agencies.--Because care is delivered\nlargely one-on-one in clients' homes, managers in home\ncare face quite different challenges than managers of\nfacility-based providers. Indeed, fewer factors that\naffect workers' jobs are under management's control.\nReflecting this in part, direct care workers in home care\nwere least likely to identify anything that employers\ncould do to improve their jobs. Increasing compensa-\ntion is by far the most important change that managers\ncan make, as identified by workers. In addition, an\nimportant minority of home care workers called for\nbetter fringe benefits. Managers should also respond to\nhome care workers' concerns about the number of\nhours they work, scheduling, and more training.\nImplications for Public Policy\nFor public policy makers, our findings have two\nrelated implications. First, government policies that\nincrease direct care workers' pay are important to\nimproving jobs. Low Medicaid reimbursement rates are\nlikely to lead to low pay and high turnover, especially\nin providers for whom Medicaid payments are a large\nshare of revenue.\nSecond, policies that increase pay are not the only\nones that can improve jobs. For example, government\nregulatory policies that lead to improved training of\ndirect care workers and their supervisors have potential\nfor improving jobs and reducing turnover. Pay-for-\nperformance policies that emphasize turnover and\nretention (e.g., those in Iowa and Minnesota; Kane,\nor other aspects of direct care workers' job quality in\ntheir performance criteria also may be effective.\nAnother policy option is to undertake initiatives for\nassisted living and home care similar to the Centers for\nMedicare & Medicaid Services' Nursing Home Quality\nImprovement Initiative (Kissam, et al., 2003) to offer\ntraining opportunities for workers in these settings. In\nshort, multiple policy options other than increasing\nworkers' pay could help improve jobs and ultimately\nreduce turnover.\nImplications for Research\nThis analysis has identified the management changes\nthat workers say would improve their jobs. However, it\nhas not provided evidence of the effectiveness of these\nchanges in improving retention or quality of care.\nManagers and policy makers need this evidence to\nunderstand whether the management changes have\nbenefits beyond improving jobs. Given the importance\nof work relationships to direct care workers, research\non management practices that improve work relations\nalso is needed. Research planned using the data gen-\nerated by BJBC will analyze the effects on supervision,\nturnover, and worker perceptions of quality of care of\nthe changes identified not only in Eaton's (2000) and\nHunter's (2000) frameworks, but also by direct care\nworkers themselves.\nFinally, our findings have an important implication\nfor researchers: Do not assume that findings from\nresearch on nursing facilities apply to other settings.\nSome findings from nursing facilities, where so-called\nculture change originated and where most of the\nresearch on improving direct care workers' jobs has\nbeen done, will apply to other types of providers, but\nnot all findings will. Looking only through the lens of\nskilled nursing facilities may distort researchers' ability\nto see what changes are needed in assisted living and\nespecially in home care.\nReferences\nBarry, T., Kemper, P., & Brannon, D.
