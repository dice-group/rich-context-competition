    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThe \"hygiene hypothesis\" has been suggested to explain the rising incidence of\nallergic disorders in developed countries. The postulated mechanism is that infec-\ntious and/or microbial agents stimulate the immune system toward Thl (allergy\nfighting) rather than Th2 (allergy promoting) response. This paper reviews the\nevidence related to early life infectious/microbial exposures and subsequent atopic\ndisorders and evaluates whether these data suggest a hormetic effect. Our review\nindicates an insufficient and contradictory association for bacterial/viral infections,\nwith protective effects being either absent or specific to certain infections and/or\npopulations. Chronic, heavy parasitic burdens appear to confer protection against\natopic disorders, but are associated with considerable pathology. Moreover, light\nparasitic burden may increase allergic responses (i.e., no \"low dose\" beneficial\neffect). In contrast, there is consistent evidence that general microbial exposures,\nparticularly gut commensals, may be protective against allergy development, which\nis consistent with a hormetic effect (i.e., potentially beneficial effects at low doses\nand detrimental effects at high levels). Conclusion: General microbial exposures in\nrelation to the \"hygiene hypothesis\" may represent a hormetic effect, although\nfurther research with more rigorous study methods (i.e., prospective designs and\nmeasurement of exposure timing, dose, route, etc.) are needed.\n",

Conversely, atopic individuals have a predisposition toward a Th2 response\nand production of cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-5, which promote IgE production\nand eosinophilia.

Accordingly, this\npaper reviews the evidence related to the \"hygiene hypothesis\" and compares the\nfindings with the concept of hormesis. This paper is not intended as a comprehen-\nsive or exhaustive review of the literature. Rather, it is.meant as a high-level overview\nof the evidence on this topic, with the hope ofstimulating discussion and awareness.\nOur review focuses on three types of exposures - bacterial/viral infectious illness,\ngeneral microbial exposures, and parasitism - and evaluates whether the evidence\nrelated to each of these exposures suggests a possible hormetic effect.\nFindings from studies of early life exposure to bacterial/viral infections and\nsubsequent risk of atopic disorders have produced variable results. For example, a\nstudy of Italian military cadets found that a history of exposure to food-borne and\noral-fecal infections (H. jJylori, Toxoplasma gondii, and hepatitis A), but not airborne\nviruses, was associated with reduced atopy and allergies (Matricardi et al. 1997,\n2000). Measles infection, an inducer of a Thl immune response, has been associ-\nated with a reduced risk of atopic disorders in some studies (Shaheen et al. 1996;\nA report from Japan suggests that children demonstrating a positive immune\nresponse to the bacille Calmette-Gue'rin (BCG) vaccine (another inducer of type 1\nimmune response) have less allergenic sensitization and fewer atopic diseases com-\npared with children having a negative response (Shirakawa et al. 1997).\nStudies having less specific information on type of viral infection have reported\nsimilar results. For example, Martinez et at. (1995) found that nonwheezinglower\nHygiene Hypothesis and Hormesis\nrespiratory tract infections (LRl) during the first 3 years oflife were associated with\nlower IgE levels and lower skin test reactivity compared with children with wheezing\nand/or absentLRl. A longitudinal study of 1314 German children by IlIi etat. (2001)\nfound that repeated viral infections other than lower respiratory tract infections\nearly in life may reduce risk ofsubsequent asthma development. Additionally, there\nis a relatively consistent association between smaller sibship size, (Strachan 1989;\natopic disorders. Interestingly, two studies reported a reduced level of IgE in cord\nblood of pregnancies having higher birth order, suggesting that the sibling effect\nmay originate in utero (Bergmann et al. 1999; Karmaus et al. 200 I). In COil trast to\nthe above studies, there is evidence that some respiratory viruses, particularly respi-\n2000). Additionally, several studies have found either similar or increased risk of\natopy and/or asthma associated with childhood infection with airborn viruses (Bodner\nAnother source of information about the role of childhood infections in the\ndevelopment ofatopic diseases is studies ofchildhood immunizations, antibiotic use\nand daycare attendance. With the exception of vaccines like the BeG, most vacci-\nnations given to children induce a Th2 response (Rook and Stanford 1998). Several\nstudies suggest that infant and childhood immunizations, particularly pertussis\nvaccine, may be associated with an increased risk of asthma (Kemp el at. 1997;\nFarooqi and Hopkin 1998). With regard to antibiotics use, several investigators have\nfound that antibiotic use in the first few years of life is associated with an increased\nrisk of developing atopic diseases, with risk increasing as number of antibiotic\ncourses taken increases (Farooqi and Hopkin 1998; von Mutius et at. 1999; Wickens\netal. 1999a). However, several studies have reported either weak or no evidence that\ninfant and childhood immunizations increase risk of atopic diseases (Henderson et\nantibiotic use to be a risk factor for asthma and allergic disorders only among\nchildren with parents having hay fever (Droste el at. 2000). Finally, results for\ndaycare attendance and subsequent asthma are mixed, with some studies reporting\na protective effect (Oddy et al. 1999) and others reporting either no association\n(Nystad et al. 1999; Kilpelainen et at. 2000) or an increased risk (Wickens (~t al.\nConclusion. The evidence to support a reduced risk of atopic disorders and early\nlife exposure to bacterial/viral infections is insufficient and contradictory. In gen-\neral, the effect is either absent or specific to certain infections and/or populations.\nMore importantly, there is no evidence that the response is a low-dose phenomenon\n- a key characteristic ofhormetic effects. As such, if a protective effect of bacterial/\nviral infections is real, this effect is more appropriately viewed as a beneficial\nresponse to a pathological process rather than a honnetic effect.\nBukowski and Lewis\nPARASITISM\nA\" infection and microbial exposure has decreased in Western society over time,\nso has parasitism. Prior to the 20th century, parasitism was quite common through-\nout the world, and it is still endemic to most regions of the developing world. Also,\nas with allergy, parasitism is associated with an alteration in the balance between the\nTh I and Th2 responses. These factors have caused some to wonder if the rise in\natopy has been fueled by the fall in parasitism (Yazdanbakhsh et at. 2001, 2002).\nThere is a fair body of evidence suggesting that parasitism may protect against\nallergic illness. Schistosomiasis and a variety of intestinal parasite infections have\nbeen associated with lower levels ofallergic reactivity (Lynch etat. 1998; Araujo etat.\nanthelmintic treatment has also been shown to induce a heightened allergic re-\nsponse (Lynch etat. 1993). However, there is also evidence against a protective effect\nfrom parasitism, with some studies finding no protective effect on allergy, or even\na worsening of allergic disease among parasitized individuals (Catapani et at. 1997;\nOne apparent inconsistency behind the hypothesis that parasitism protects against\nallergy is the fact that most parasites elicit a strong Th2 immune response in the host\n(Weiss 1998b). Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain this seemingly\nparadoxical finding. One possible mechanism is that the polyclonal IgE response\ninduced by parasitism competitively binds to mast cell receptors, inhibiting allergic\ndegranulation. A second proposed mechanism is that this polyclonal IgE expansion\nexhausts the immune response. However, the most promising mechanistic explana-\ntion is that the inflammatory response produced by chronic parasitism also induces\na down-regulation of the immune system (e.g., through interleukinlO production),\nas a means of protecting the host from runaway inflammation. This would explain\nwhy heavy parasitism seems to be protective for allergy/asthma, while lighter para-\nsite burdens are not. This also explains why anthelmentic treatment removes this\nprotective benefit. In essence, this mechanism suggests that parasitism does not\nprevent allergy development, only the inflammatory manifestations of allergic dis-\nConclusion: The best available evidence supporting a protective effect on allergy\nfrom parasite exposure suggests a dampening of the allergic response in those with\nheavy parasite burdens, which is due to an antiinflammatory mechanism. This is not\na low-dose phenomenon, given that heavy parasite burdens are needed. Further-\nmore, the pathology associated with heavy parasite loads probably outweighs any\nanti-allergy/asthma benefits. Therefore, such a process, if true, does not represent\nhormesis.\nHumans have evolved in an environment characterized by the presence of non-\npathogenic microbial exposures (Rook and Stanford 1998). Only in recent years\nHygiene Hypothesis and Hormesis\nhave these microbial agents been reduced or eliminated through the introduction\nof improved food handling and safety procedures, the use of antimicrobial soaps\nand agents, etc. There is increasing evidence and mechanistic rationale to suggest\nthat early life exposure to generally harmless environmental bacteria may confer\nprotection against development of atopy and asthma.\nEndotoxin\nEndotoxins are lipopolysaccharides that form a part of the outer structure of the\ncell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. Interestingly, endotoxin that is typically found\nin households is capable of inducing INF-y and IL-12 production (Le et at. 1986;\nD'Andrea et at. 1992). Martinez (2001) notes that the body's immune system has a\nsensitive mechanism to detect the presence of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which\nresults in the production of a set of cytokines and immune mediators (e.g., IFN-y)\nby antigen presenting cells. This process may prevent early allergic sensitization,\nthereby ultimately preventing the development of asthma or allergic conditions.\nThere is consistent epidemiologic evidence that children raised on farms have a\nreduced risk of developing atopic disorders compared with children raised in non-\nfarm environments (Braun-Fahrlander el at. 1999; Ernst and Cormier 2000; Riedler\nLeynaert et at. 2001; Riedler et at. 2001). The apparent protective effect of being\nraised on a farm is stronger for hay fever and atopic sensitization than for asthr!1a\n(Lewis 2000). Currently, it is unclear whether this association may be due to\nincreased microbial exposures resulting from contact with livestock (Riedler el at.\nor some other aspect of the traditional farming lifestyle.\nStudies have reported that dust samples collected from farming homes have\nsignificantly higher levels of endotoxin compared with non-fanning homes (von\nlower levels of endotoxin in dust samples collected in the homes of allergen-\nsensitized infants compared with nonsensitized infants. In this same study, blood\nT-eells collected from infants living in homes with higher endotoxin levels showed\nsignificantly increased IFN-y responses. Braun-Fahrlander et at. (2002) reported that\nendotoxin levels in the dust taken from a child's mattress were inversely related to\nthe occurrence of hay fever, atopic asthma, and atopic sensitization, but not with\nnonatopic wheeze. An inverse association was also reported between endotoxin\nlevels and the capacity of circulating leukocytes to produce inflammatory cytokines\nafter stimulation with LPS. These findings provide perhaps the strongest evidence\nfor an association between endotoxin exposure and decreased atopic illness (Braun-\nWhile the above data argue that endotoxin may protect against atopic disease,\nsome have pointed out conflicting observations that argue against this hypothesis.\nFor example, exposure to endotoxin in occupational or laboratory settings can\nproduce a number of adverse effects (e.g., fever, respiratory disease, etc.) (Douwes\nBukowski and Lewis\net at. 2002). However, when examined more closely, these observations are not\nincompatible with the hygiene hypothesis. Exposed workers (e.g., cotton and grain\nworkers) and subjects in controlled studies experience relatively high-level inhala-\ntion exposure to endotoxin, rather than the lower-level exposure to inhaled and\ningested endotoxin produced by contact with animals and soil in farm settings. Also,\nadult exposures occur well after the stimulatory time window suggested by the\nhygiene hypothesis. Elevated endotoxin levels in metropolitan homes have been\nassociated with exacerbation of existing asthma, but not asthma development (Liu\nIntestinal Flora\ntract were a major cause of illness requiring medical treatment in US children,\na pattern that still persists today in developing countries. The causes of these\nillnesses have largely been eliminated in developed countries through vaccina-\ntions, better food and water supplies, and increased use of antibiotics (Martinez\npathogenic bacteria) at mucosal surfaces, particularly in the gut, may \"edu-\ncate\" the immune system to interact safely with nonmicrobial antigens. There\nis some evidence to support this hypothesis, with several studies indicating\ncompositional differences in gut flora between allergic and nonallergic sub-\ndifferences in intestinal flora between allergic and nonallergic children in\nEstonia and Sweden, with allergic children having less lactobacilli and\nbifidobacteria and more aerobic microorganisms, compared with nonallergic\nchildren. Most impressive is a recent double-blind, randomized placebo-con-\ntrolled trial that showed prenatal administration of lactobacillus GG to moth-\ners of high-risk infants was effective in preventing early atopic disease\nOne piece of conflicting evidence is that high asthma prevalence in the US is\noften among urban children who live in environments that are typically thought of\nas being \"dirty\". However, this may reflect a difference in the definition of \"dirty\"\nbetween farm and urban environments (Matricardi and Bonini 2000a). Urban\nchildren often live in poorly ventilated homes exposed to cockroaches, vermin,\nhouse dust, and volatile chemicals. Farm children are exposed to \"dirt\" that is rich\nin organic material.\nConclusion: Considerable evidence supports a protective effect on atopy/asthma\nfrom early exposure to microbials, especially those found on farms (e.g., Gram-\nNegative bacteria and lactobacilli). These low-level beneficial exposures, which are\nharmful at high levels, suggest a hormetic process.\nHygiene Hypothesis and Honnesis\nThe evidence to support an association between early bacterial/viral infectious\nillness and decreased atopy/asthma is insufficient and contradictory. The evidence\nfor such a protective effect from parasitism is stronger, but neither line of evidence\nsuggests a low-level (i.e., hormetic) process. However, considerable evidence does\nsupport a protective effect from low-level exposure to general ambient microbials,\nsuggesting that this aspect ofthe hygiene hypothesis may be an example of hormesis.\nIt should be noted that while evidence supports this aspect of the hygiene hypoth-\nesis, the hypothesis still represents a theory that has not been proven. It must also\nbe recognized that asthma/allergy development is complex, with multiple other\nfactors (e.g., fetal development and genetic predisposition), as well as interactions\nof these factors with the environment, playing an important role (Berg 1996;\nThis hypothesis, if substantiated, suggests obvious personal or public health\ninterventions that might be useful to decrease the risk of childhood allergy/asthma\n(e.g., microbial supplementation or decreased emphasis on extensive household\ndisinfection). However, there are currently many unanswered questions regarding\nthe role that early microbial exposures play in the development of allergy and\nasthma. For example, it is unclear what type, duration, or magnitude of microbial\nexposure is most associated with a protective effect, although those organisms that\ninduce a strong Thl response are likely to be good candidates for study (Von\nHertzen 1998). Importantly, it is unclear what developmental periods constitute\ncritical \"exposure\" windows, whether exposures after a certain age (e.g., 3 to 5 years)\nhave an impact, and the role that these exposures play in initiating or maintaining\na Thl-type immune response. There is some evidence to suggest that exposures into\nadulthood may still be important, with several studies suggesting that immigrants\nmay take on the atopy profile of the local population over time (Kalyoncu and\nStalenheim 1992). Moreover, atopic disorders have been reported to go into remis-\nsion after infectious diseases occur among atopic individuals (Serafini 1997).\nOne controlled trial reported that microbial supplementation during pregnancy\nmay protect against allergy development in children (Kalliomaki et al. 200Ib).\nNational trials need to be performed to confirm these findings and demonstrate the\nsafety and efficacy of this approach as a possible prophylactic measure.\nFinally, most of the studies investigating the \"hygiene hypothesis\" have been\ncross-sectional and/or retrospective designs. In order to answer the questions above,\nlarger prospective studies will be needed. National efforts, such as the recently\nproposed longitudinal National Children's Study (U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2001) represent ideal\nsituations within which to evaluate and refine this hypothesis and to identify specific\nprophylactic exposures.\nBukowski and Lewis\nREFERENCES\nAbramson MJ and Walters EH. 2000.
