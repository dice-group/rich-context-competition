    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The United States invests a sizable amount of money on\ntreatments for mental health and substance abuse: $135 billion in 2005,\nor 1.07 percent of the gross domestic product. We provide treatment\npast trends and consider future possibilities. We find that the growth rate\nin spending on mental health medications--a major driver of mental\nhealth expenditures in prior years--declined dramatically. As a result,\nmental health and substance abuse spending grew at a slightly slower\nshrink as a share of all health spending. Of note, we also find that\nMedicaid's share of total spending on mental health grew from 17 percent\nthe full implementation of federal parity law, and such health reform-\nrelated actions as the planned expansion of Medicaid all have the\npotential to improve access to mental health and substance abuse\ntreatment and to alter spending patterns further. Our spending estimates\nprovide an important context for evaluating the effect of those policies.\nMental illness and substance\nabuse conditions--some-\ntimes collectively referred to\nas behavioral health disor-\nders--are extremely preva-\nlent. They significantly affect the productivity,\nmorbidity, and mortality of the US population.\nTo understand the size, nature, and value of the\nnation's investment in health, it is important to\nexamine spending on treatment of these behav-\nioral health conditions, who is paying for that\ntreatment, and which providers furnish\nthat care.\nCalculating spending on behavioral health\ntreatment is particularly important given recent\nmajor health policy changes. The Paul Wellstone\nand Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and\nAddiction Equity Act of 2008 and the Affordable\nCare Act of 2010 have tremendous potential to\nimprove access to behavioral health services and\nto alter past spending trends. Millions of people\nwho previously experienced limits or caps in\ntheir psychiatric and substance abuse health in-\nsurance benefits should gain better access to\nservices because of the Parity Act. Millions more\nuninsured people with mental health conditions\nand substance use disorders will gain insurance\ncoverage because of the Affordable Care Act.\nRecognizing the need for comprehensive, on-\ngoing, and consistent data to inform the field,\nthe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services\nAdministration (SAMHSA) has routinely devel-\noped estimates of spending on behavioral health\nfor more than ten years. We present the most\nrecent mental health and substance abuse treat-\nment spending estimates for the period 1986\u00ad\n2005.We also describe total spending on mental\nhealth and substance abuse treatment, as well as\nspending by payer, provider, and site of service.\nThe People-to-People Health\nFoundation, Inc.\nTami L.

The two methods were inte-\ngrated by summing spending for each provider\nand payer after accountingforduplication across\ndata sources.\nBehavioral disorders were defined using the\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Re-\nvision, Clinical Modification (IDC-9-CM). The\nspending estimates capture only the cost of pro-\nviding behavioral health treatment. Other non-\nmedical and nontreatment costs are excluded,\nsuch as the costs of lost productivity and somatic\nconditions that result from mental illness or sub-\nstance abuse--for example, physical complica-\ntions from excessive drinking.\nThe estimates developed here may differ from\nthose based on other data sources, such as the\nMedical ExpenditurePanelSurvey, conducted by\nthe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality\n(AHRQ). That survey covers only the noninsti-\ntutionalized population, and it also under-\nreports high-cost cases, emergency department\nvisits, and physician office visits.1\u00ad3\nA key strength of SAMHSA's effort is the use of\nconsistent and comprehensive methods to track\ntrends over almost twenty years.

The largest share of\nspending was 7.3 percent for the category \"other\n(non-Medicaid) state and local governments.\"\nSpending on substance abuse services during\nthe past three decades can be characterized by a\nperiod of boom and bust. The 1980s was a time of\nexpanding insurance benefits and broadened ac-\ncess to substance abuse treatment providers.8\u00ad10\nHowever, by the mid- to late-1980s, employers\nwere increasingly alarmed by spiraling health\ncare costs. Substance abuse treatment, in par-\nticular, was perceived as an example of inflated\nspending--a perception enhanced by the grow-\ning private treatment industry.11\nThe result was managed care restrictions on\nreimbursement for substance abuse treatment in\nhospitals. Restrictions included limitations on\nthe commonly used treatment paradigm of a\ntwenty-eight-day inpatient rehabilitation stay.\nspending fell 8.7 percent annually.

However, behavioral health\nspending must be evaluated not only in dollar\nterms but also in the context of the need for and\naccess to treatment.\nprevalence of psychiatric disorders remained\nconstant, while rates of psychiatric treatment\ngrew tremendously.12\u00ad15 For example, the per-\ncentage of severely mentally ill people receiving\ntreatment grew from 24 percent in the period\nand the percentage with any disorder receiving\ntreatment increased from 12 percent to\nMental Health And Substance Abuse Treatment And All Health Spending, Millions Of Nominal Dollars, By Payer, Selected\nSOURCES Authors' analysis of data from the following sources.

In particular, a large portion of the\nincrease in psychiatric treatment rates stems\nfrom more people using psychiatric medica-\ntions, which was stimulated in turn by the intro-\nduction of more effective psychiatric drugs with\nfewer side effects.12\nAmid the declining cost of psychiatric medica-\ntions because of the broader use of generics, the\ncost of increased access has also been declining.\nThe declining cost of psychiatric drugs may also\nsuggest that third-party payers revisit cost con-\ntrols on psychiatric medications, such as step\ntherapy and prior authorization, which have\nbeen shown in some studies to limit medication\nuse and increase medical care use and costs.16,17\nRecession And Policy Changes Although the\nestimates presented here end at 2005, they are\nstill relevant in the context of recent economic\nand policy changes--in particular, the recession,\nthe Parity Act, and the Affordable Care Act.\nThe Parity Act interim final regulations went\ninto effect April 2010, affecting all new health\nplans after July 2010. The law allows employers\nto request an exemption from the parity require-\nments for the next year if they can demonstrate\nthat the parity law resulted in a 2 percent in-\ncrease in total costs for medical, surgical, mental\nhealth, and substance use disorder treatment in\nthe first year after implementation (1 percent in\nsubsequent years).\nWe find that spending on behavioral health\ntreatment constituted 4.8 percent of private\nhealth insurance benefits in 2005 and grew by\ngrowth rate increase in behavioral spending of\nfour times that amount, or 28 percent, behav-\nioral health still would have raised total private\ninsurance expenditures by only 1 percent. Thus,\nthe estimates indicate that it is unlikely that most\nemployers will be able to seek a cost exemption\nfrom the Parity Act.\nThe recession has led many states to cut Medic-\naid reimbursement and services, at the same\ntime as it has caused a surge in Medicaid enroll-\nment.18 Our estimate that behavioral health\nspending accounts for 11.5 percent of overall\nMedicaid spending, paired with insurance prac-\ntices that are more likely to limit behavioral\nhealth than medical or surgical services, sug-\ngests that behavioral health may offer a tempting\ntarget for state spending cuts. Moreover, many\nservices needed by people with mental illnesses,\nsuch as supportive employment and case man-\nagement, are considered optional benefits under\nMedicaid.\nAlthough Medicaid programs are reducing\nreimbursement and services in response to the\nrecession, they arerestricted from cutting enroll-\nment since the enactment of the Affordable Care\nback on health care services funded solely\nthough general funds. Because substance abuse\nfinancing is more dependent on state general\nfunds than on Medicaid, addiction services\nmay be particularly vulnerable to recession-\ndriven cutbacks.\nAlthough not implemented until 2014, the\nMedicaid expansions under the Affordable Care\nAct may be of particular benefit to those with\naddictions and mental illnesses. Because mental\nillness and substance abuse are more prevalent\namong people with limited resources, and be-\ncause the conditions often lead to diminished\nincome, employment opportunities, and insur-\nance coverage, the most vulnerable and severely\nill--who are often adults who are childless or\nwho have nondependent children--typically\nhave the least access to needed services.19\nFew states offer Medicaid coverage to these\n\"childless\" adults, and that is likely to remain\nthe case until 2014, when the Affordable Care\nAct is fully phased in. As a result, childless adults\nwith addictions will continue to be excluded for a\nwhile from Medicaid coverage. What's more,\nmany people with addictions lost Medicaid cov-\nerage after 1996, when Congress acted to remove\nsubstance dependence as a qualifying disability\nfor Supplemental Security Income. Until that\ntime, qualification for Supplemental Security In-\ncome had generally opened the door for Medic-\naid eligibility for people with addictions.\nAnalyses of the 2008 National Survey on Drug\nUse and Health indicate that 4.9 million unin-\nsured people were classified as having serious\npsychological distress in the past year and that\n5.5 million were classified as having substance\ndependence or abuse disorders in the past year.\nThus, millions of people with mental illness and\nsubstance use disorders could benefit from im-\nproved access to insurance coverage.\nConclusion In summary, the past two decades\nhave been characterized by important shifts in\ntechnology and in the use and financing of\nbehavioral health treatment. The recent reces-\nsion as well as the full implementation of federal\nparity law and health reform have the potential\nto alterbehavioral health care dramatically in the\nfuture. The spending estimates in this article\nprovide an important context for evaluating\nthe effect of those policies. \nMental Health\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
