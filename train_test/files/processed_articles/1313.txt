Those that have found that binge eating dis-\norder occurs with equal or greater frequency for\nAfrican American and White women,1 while ano-\nrexia nervosa (AN) is rarely found among African\nAmerican women.2 These studies, however, often\nare limited to specific populations (e.g., college stu-\ndents, women) or regions of the country.3 To\naddress the limitations of previous research specifi-\ncally among Blacks, the current study comprehen-\nsively examined the prevalence, age of onset, per-\nsistence and gender differences in eating disorders\nin a nationally representative sample of African\nAmerican and Caribbean Black adults and adoles-\ncents.\nMethod\nParticipants\nA national probability sample of households was\ndrawn based on adult population estimates and power\ncalculations for detecting differences in the two adult\nsamples, using the African American sample as the pri-\nmary core sampling base for the study.

Details of the methodology used for\nthe National Survey of American Life (NSAL) have been\npreviously described,4 including details of the sample\ndesign, weighting, and variance estimation.5,6 The WMH\nComposite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-\nCIDI-WHO Organization 2004 modified),7 was used to\nmeasure eating disorders. This diagnostic interview\nschedule met the DSM-IV TR eating disorders criteria for\nAN and bulimia nervosa (BN).8 For the purposes of this\nreport the terms binge eating disorder with hierarchy\n(``BED'') and ``any binge eating'' also are used. BED is\ndefined as binge eating with no purging or AN. Any binge\neating is classified as a behavior rather than a syndrome.\nThese definitions are consistent with the National\nComorbidity Survey-Replication (NCS-R) guidelines.9\nThus, we examined two DSM-IV TR eating disorders (AN,\nBN), one proposed disorder (BED), and one entity that\npartially overlapped with one or more of the disorders\n(any binge eating).\nAnalytic procedures were used to properly adjust\nstandard errors, confidence intervals, and significance\ntests for the complex sample design of the NSAL. All\nanalyses were weighted to be nationally representative of\npopulations and subgroups of interest. Crosstabulations\nwere used to calculate the prevalence estimates of the\neating disorders by ethnicity and by gender. Cox propor-\ntional hazards regression was used to estimate the odds\nratios of developing the disorders for the ethnic and gen-\nder groups.10 Ages of onset of the eating disorders were\nascertained by respondents' retrospective reports. All\nanalyses were conducted using survey procedures of the\nSAS Version 9.1.3 software package.11 SAS uses the Tay-\nlor-series linearization technique for calculating the\ncomplex-design-based estimates of variance.\nResults\nPrevalence of Eating Disorders\nlifetime prevalence estimates were greatest for any\neating disorder, followed by BED, BN, and AN,\nrespectively. The 12-month prevalence estimates\nwere less than the corresponding lifetime esti-\nmates. No 12-month case of AN was found among\nCaribbean black adults, and there were no ethnic\ndifferences in lifetime or 12-month prevalence esti-\nmates for other eating disorders.

No\nethnic differences were found (Table 1).\nAge of Onset and Persistence\nAdults were most at risk of developing an eating\ndisorder between 12 and 30 years of age. AN had\nboth the lowest mean and median ages of onset\ncompared with other eating disorders; but only the\naverage age of onset for BED was significantly\nhigher than age of onset for AN (Table 2).\nThe average number of years that an eating dis-\norder lasted among adults was lowest for AN and\nhighest for BED. There were no differences in\nlength of persistence between AN and other eating\ndisorders (Table 2). The 12-month prevalence\namong adults with a lifetime history was lowest for\nAN and highest for BED (Tables 1 and 2).\nPrevalence of Eating Disorders by Gender\nAmong adults, women had higher lifetime preva-\nlence of any binge eating and 12-month prevalence\nof BN, and BED than men. Marginally significant\ngender differences were found for adults with life-\ntime prevalence of BN and any binge eating with\nwomen experiencing higher prevalence than men.\nNo significant gender differences were found\namong adolescents; however, it is notable that\nmore cases of boys than girls were reported with\n12-month prevalence for AN, BN, and any binge\neating.\nConclusion\nThis is the first study to examine the prevalence,\nage of onset, persistence and gender differences in\neating disorders in a nationally representative sam-\nple of African American and Caribbean Black adults\nand adolescents. Findings from this study are con-\nsistent with previous research that shows that AN is\nuncommon among African Americans. Although\nthe prevalence rates for AN were low (lifetime 5\n0.17% adults), our findings for African American\nadults were consistent with the low prevalence\n(0.6%) reported in the NCS-R.9 Further, the age of\nonset for AN was during mid adolescence (14.89)\nfor African American adults in the NSAL compared\nwith late adolescence (18.9) in the NCS-R,9 with no\ncases among African Americans occurring after age\n19 in the NSAL. Combined with no reports of AN\namong Caribbean Black adults, these findings sug-\ngests that African Americans may be more at risk\nfor AN than Caribbean Blacks, with a younger age\nof onset than the general US population. This\nyounger age of onset is cause for concern since\nresearch consistently indicates that AN is most\nlikely to begin in late adolescence.2 The emergence\nof AN in mid-adolescence in a population that\nclinicians are not accustomed to treating will result\nin Black youth going undiagnosed and untreated\nTABLE 2.

It is not clear from this\nstudy what may have protected Caribbean blacks\nfrom developing AN. Future research is needed to\nexamine this issue from a cultural perspective.\nBN was more common than AN in both ethnic\ngroups, with higher lifetime prevalence rates for\nBN (1.49% adults) than that reported by Striegel-\nMoore et al.,2 at 0.4% for Black women. The NSAL\ndata, however, are consistent with findings from\nthe NCS-R for adults overall (1.0%), and with regard\nin the NCS-R.9 Findings from the current study\nindicate that the rates of BN among Blacks may not\nbe as uncommon as once believed, with similar age\nof onset as most previous studies in this area.\nBecause it is often unanticipated among Blacks, it\ncan be easily under diagnosed. Reasons why Blacks\nare experiencing a higher prevalence in BN have\nbeen postulated to be associated with stress,\nincluding acculturated stress.12 That is, the more\nBlacks feel pressure to assimilate with the domi-\nnant culture in America, the greater their risk for\nbody image dissatisfaction and development of\nBN.12 Perhaps the positive body self perceptions\nthat once protected Blacks from eating disorders\nmay be beginning to erode.13\nConsistent with previous research,2,9 binge eat-\ning was the most prevalent eating disorder among\nBlacks in the NSAL. Males were significantly less\nlikely to develop binge eating than women, indicat-\ning that males may have developed protective\nmechanisms against this disordered behavior but\nmay have more issues around behaviors that\nemphasize slim athletic build.14 While most eating\ndisorders had an age of onset during adolescence,\nbinge eating had the highest age of onset (22.75),\nwhich is consistent with the NCS-R (25.4).9 This\nolder age of onset may reflect less of a concern for\nsmaller body size than concern with environmental\nstressors. It is plausible that exposure to economic\ndeprivation and other stressors may have had an\neffect on the desire to consume more food as a cop-\ning mechanism.15 Once poor dietary habits are\nformed they are difficult to change. Adults tend to\nbe less active and are involved in less physical\nactivities than their adolescent counterparts.\nPersistence of an eating disorder was lowest for\nAN and highest for binge eating. The persistence\nfor AN in the NSAL was approximately twice that in\nthe NCS-R while BN in the NCS-R was more than\n1.5 times that seen in the NSAL.9 These data sug-\ngest that while AN may be uncommon among\nBlacks, those that do experience AN have a longer\nbattle with the disorder. Conversely, Blacks in the\nNSAL experience shorter durations with BN, binge\neating, and BED than other ethnic and racial\ngroups that have been studied.9 This suggests that\nshort term duration for these disorders may be\nindicators for health care providers to prescreen\nBlacks for eating disorders and not to discount\nshort-term disordered eating behavior as nondiag-\nnostic.\nAs in previous research, adult women had higher\nprevalence of eating disorders than men in the\nNSAL. These findings are supported by results from\nthe NCS-R.9 We found no gender difference in eat-\ning disorders among the adolescents; however,\nmore boys than girls were affected by eating disor-\nders. Although our numbers are small, they do\npoint to a tendency for boys to exhibit eating disor-\ndered behaviors during adolescence. Other studies\npoint to weight restrictions for sports participation\n(i.e., football, boxing, wrestling, etc.) as one reason\nfor this trend.14 Our findings provide evidence that\nBlack boys may not be immune to eating disorders.\nThis is an area that future research should be rigor-\nously pursued.\nIn sum, although the prevalence of most eating\ndisorders among Blacks is uncommon, certain dis-\norders are more prevalent among specific ethnic\nsubgroups of Blacks (e.g., African Americans and\nAN), age of onset appears to be younger for AN,\nwhile persistence of the disorder may be longer for\nAN and shorter for BN and binge eating disorders.\nTaken as a whole, these findings suggest that cul-\ntural differences must be considered when diag-\nnosing eating disorders in Black populations. Clini-\ncians must be prepared to recognize and treat pop-\nulations that are often considered to be least likely\nto develop an eating disorder. This will require\ntraining to work with diverse cultural groups to\nensure that appropriate treatment is provided. Spe-\ncialists in adult and pediatric/adolescent health-\ncare should be educated to possible differences\nregarding prevalence, age of onset, persistence and\ngender differences in eating disorders to appropri-\nately assess, and diagnose eating disorders among\nsubgroups of Black people. The era, social climate,\nand subculture in which a person was raised may\nhave significant effects on their risk for developing\nan eating disorder.\nCulturally sensitive criteria need to be incorpo-\nrated into the DSM-V for eating disorders that con-\nsider subcultural, gender, and age variations. Rec-\nommendations for DSM-V should include the fol-\nlowing: earlier screening for AN among African\nAmericans as young as early to mid adolescence;\nonce diagnosed with AN, African Americans need\nlonger durations of follow-up and treatment.\nAlthough it is unclear why other eating disorders\namong Blacks such as BN or BED have a shorter du-\nration, earlier and more frequent screening may be\nnecessary to aid in capturing cases of these disorders.\nReferences\n1.
