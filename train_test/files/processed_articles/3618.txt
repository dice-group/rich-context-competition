    "abstract": "Abstract\nReciprocity, a core component of social capital, is rarely theorized or measured leaving the relationship between reciprocity\nand health ambiguous. Historically, reciprocity measures have not been used in the context they were designed causing\nmeasurement error. This multi-phased study was designed to develop and validate a reciprocity measure for formal and\ninformal groups within communities and congregations as part of a more comprehensive social capital measure. In-depth\ninterviews (n = 72), cognitive interviews (n = 40), and an expert review panel guided item development and selection for\ncontent validity. South Carolina residents (n = 500) completed the 10-item Reciprocity of Social Support (RSS) Scale during\n2008-2010. Construct validity was supported through an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) that confirmed a two-factor model\nfor the scale for community- and congregation-based groups. Cronbach's  values indicated items were highly correlated for\ncommunity groups and church groups. Psychometric analyses of the RSS Scale support convergent and divergent validity for\nthe community- and congregation-based groups. Mean RSS Scale scores were not statistically different between community-\nand congregation-based groups. This scale has proven psychometric properties for utilization in future research investigating\nreciprocity of social support in community- and congregation-based groups and will be useful to examine whether reciprocity\n(by context and type of group) is associated with physical and/or mental health.\n",

For the pur-\nposes of this article, reciprocity will be examined through the\nlens of cognitive social capital, that is, what people value or\nbelieve they or others in their network would do under cer-\ntain circumstances.\nReciprocity has long been of theoretical interest in the\nsocial sciences. In Alvin Goulder's (1960) seminal publica-\ntion, he provided a theoretical explanation of reciprocity and\nclarified the concept as patterns of returning or responding to\nbenefits received. He described reciprocity as \"moral\ncement\" that stabilizes social relationships by creating a\nsense of obligations to one another (Goulder, 1960). Harpham\n(2008) explained that reciprocity as a two-way behavioral\nrelationship: when someone has helped someone there is an\nexpectation that the favor will be returned when needed.\nStone (2001) emphasized reciprocity as a core construct of\nsocial capital because it is an indicator of the quality of social\nrelationships that impacts people's abilities to solve common\nproblems (Stewart-Weeks & Richardson, 1998).\nSocial Capital in Faith Groups and\nCommunity Groups\nSocial capital depends on context at individual and group\nlevels (Kawachi & Berkman, 2000). Tangible and intangible\nresources are a function of specific social connections\n(Cattell, 2001). Community participation, through formal\nand informal groups, is thought to produce more social capi-\ntal (Putnam, 2000) because it facilitates access to resources\n(Hurtado et al., 2011) and provides individuals with a sense\nthat they can solve their problems through collective action\nPutnam (2000) suggests that faith communities may be\nthe single most important source of social capital in the\nUnited States. Faith communities commonly contribute to\nsocial services and community cohesion through social capi-\ntal (Dinham, Furbey, & Lowndes, 2009). In the United\nStates, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam all have commit-\nments to peace, justice, honesty, service, personal responsi-\nbility, forgiveness, respect, and obligation to others that can\ncontribute to the development of trusting relationships\n(Furbey, Dinham, Farnell, Finneron, & Wilkinson, 2006).\nThus far, no studies have examined whether faith groups also\ncontribute to reciprocity in relationships.\nWald and Calhoun-Brown (2007) estimated that between\nthree fifths to three fourths of the American adult population\nAmericans reported attending church at least once a week or\nalmost every week (Newport, 2010). Church attendance lev-\nels varied across U.S. regions, with the highest levels in the\nFurthermore, according to the Corporation for National and\nCommunity Service (CNCS, 2006), U.S. adults have been\nmore likely to volunteer through religious organizations\ncompared with civic, educational, political, professional,\nhospital, or recreational organizations with proportions vol-\nolds to 45.5% among those 65 years and older. No other type\nof organization has comparable levels of involvement\n(CNCS, 2006). This high level of volunteerism helps account\nfor the role of faith communities in fostering social capital.\nMeasuring Reciprocity\nReciprocity is a core part of cognitive social capital (Abbott\nprocity of social support may impact health outcomes. For\ninstance, a study by Moskowitz, Morris, and Schmidt (2010)\nexamined reciprocity of social support in a low-income pop-\nulation and found a balanced proportion of giving and receiv-\ning may buffer the effect of stressors more than the absolute\namount of received support.\nHowever, in most social capital studies, scholars rarely or\ninadequately theorized or measured reciprocity (Abbott &\n2001), leaving the relationship between reciprocity and\nhealth ambiguous (Abbott & Freeth, 2008). This may be in\nlarge part because social capital constructs are multi-dimen-\nsional, not entirely distinct from one another, and the same\nquestions are often used to measure different constructs, par-\nticularly among the constructs of trust and reciprocity\n(Blaxter, 2004). The reciprocity measures that do exist are\noften used out of contexts for which they were designed\n(Abbott & Freeth, 2008). As a result, measures are often\nworded with underlying assumptions about relationships\n(e.g., \"friends\" and \"neighbor\"), which may not be meaning-\nterms are not further defined for the respondent. Common\nreciprocity measures that use the terms neighbors and friends\ninclude \"Have you assisted neighbors or friends? Have your\nneighbors or friends assisted you?\" (Ziersch, Baum,\nMacDougall, & Putland, 2005). In relation to the term\nfriends, respondents may have various meanings ranging\nfrom friends that receive greeting cards to those called on\nduring difficult times (Abbott, 2009). Therefore, inferences\nregarding the respondents'relationship to his or her \"friends\"\nremain unclear, and may have varied impacts on health\n(Abbott, 2009). Common reciprocity measures that use the\nterm neighbor or neighborhood include the ones mentioned\npreviously, as well as \"In my neighborhood, most people are\nwilling to help others\" (Pollack & von dem Knesebeck,\n2004). The term neighbors can also be confusing to respon-\ndents because respondents may define neighbor differently\n(e.g., a neighbor who lives on the respondents' street com-\npared with a neighbor who lives in the respondents' commu-\nnity). Such general terms (i.e., friends, neighbors, and\nneighborhoods) may be imprecise indicators of\nPope et al. 3\nparticularized social capital, that is social capital that occurs\nwithin specific groups of people; therefore, such general\nterms may not accurately depict the respondent's relation-\nship in a particular context. To address these contextual mea-\nsurement issues, Dudwick, Kuehnast, Nyhan Jones, and\nWoolcock (2006) recommend that field researchers have a\nthorough understanding of the context in which the measures\nare developed, so the measures for different groups are rele-\nvant and understandable to the local population being stud-\nied. For example, researchers may rely on local cultural or\nethnic idioms that more clearly convey the intended relation-\nship to the respondent.\nOther common measures for reciprocity solicit level of\nagreement with generalized statements such as \"Most people\ntry to be helpful\" in the General Social Survey (Kawachi et\nal., 1999) or \"People are helpful\" and \"People look after\nthemselves\" from the World Values Survey (Inglehart,\nBas\u00e1\u00f1ez, D\u00edez-Medrano, Halman, & Luijkx, 2004). Such\ngeneralized questions, though simple, do not capture the\ncomplexities of social relationships (Abbott, 2009) or the\nsocial capital literature presents measures that conflate reci-\nprocity and trust measures, even though they are two sepa-\nrate constructs. Letki and Evans (2005) use both in an effort\nto measure trust in a single scale. Newton (1997) advised that\nfailure to conceptualize separate dimensions of social capital\nwill confuse our understanding of how these dimensions\nempirically operate.\nFurthermore, many studies have examined social capital\nbased on outcomes (i.e., volunteerism and political participa-\ntion), but do not examine mechanisms of social capital\n(Calhoun-Brown, 2005), such as reciprocity among commu-\nnity members, including faith communities. During a broad-\nbased consultative workshop (Dinham & Shaw, 2012),\nreciprocity was identified as a valued aspect of faith com-\nmunities by congregation-based groups. Members of congre-\ngation-based groups said that reciprocity should be measured\nto demonstrate contributions for faith communities and to\nassess the level of support generated within faith communi-\nties. However, few quantitative measures capture reciprocity\nin the context of communities, and no measures exist to\nassess reciprocity in the context of faith communities\n(Dinham & Shaw, 2012). Thus, these lack of reciprocity\nmeasures leave the relationship of reciprocity and health\nunknown in particular contexts; therefore, it is necessary to\ndevelop and refine measures of reciprocity in specific com-\nmunity settings using qualitative data (Dudwick et al., 2006),\nwhich will help determine whether different types of groups\n(i.e., community-based groups and congregation-based\ngroups) differentially affect health outcomes (Morgan &\nThe purpose of this study was to develop and validate a\nmeasure of reciprocity for formal and informal groups within\nspecific contexts (community and congregation) to deter-\nmine whether levels of reciprocity differ by context. A scale\nthat measures reciprocity will allow future studies to exam-\nine whether reciprocity (by context and type of groups) is\nassociated with physical and/or mental health.\nMethod\nStudy Design\nA multiphase study was conducted using scale development\nmethods outlined by DeVellis (2003).

In Phase II,\nthe qualitative data from Phase I were used to generate items\nand response categories, which were subsequently reviewed\nby an expert panel for content validity. In Phase III, the items\nand response categories were evaluated using cognitive\ninterviews, which led to revisions of the items and response\ncategories, further assessing content validity. In Phase IV, a\nvariety of psychometric methods were utilized to evaluate\nreliability and validity of the scale, which included the\nassessments of construct validity (i.e., convergent and diver-\ngent validity). Mean comparisons were also performed for\ncommunity- and congregation-based groups. These methods\nand results for each study phase are described in subsequent\nsections.\nThe study protocol was approved by the University of\nSouth Carolina's Institutional Review Board. Written\ninformed consent was obtained for all participants in Phase I\nand Phase IV. Oral consent was obtained from participants in\nPhase III. The development of the RSS Scale was part of a\nstudy that developed a more comprehensive multi-dimen-\nsional measure of social capital for community- and congre-\ngation-based groups. Participants in Phase I and III received\nand participants in Phase IV received US$10 for their time in\nthe study (between 20 and 60 min). The limitation to\nChristians was solely for the qualitative portion of the survey\ndevelopment: the structure and language of the scale reflected\nthose of Christian faith because of the initial setting of pre-\nliminary work.\nStudy Setting\nThe setting for study phases was in South Carolina. In effort\nto include participants with varied racial, educational, and\nincome levels, participants were recruited from eight coun-\nties across the state.\n4 SAGE Open\nPhase I: Conceptual Framework and Qualitative\nMethods\nThe methods in which the reciprocity of social support items\nwas developed contributed to content validity. Phase I was\nguided by a conceptual framework (see Figure 1). Trust has\nbeen shown to be inversely associated with common mental\nillnesses (De Silva, McKenzie, Harpham, & Huttly, 2005).\nTherefore, it would not be surprising for people with mental\nillness to score low on individual social capital scales (i.e.,\ntrust and/or reciprocity scales; De Silva et al., 2005). As\nFigure 1 illustrates, high levels of trust often lead to formal\nand informal group participation, and high levels of social\nparticipation often result in increased trust between group\nmembers (Lindstr\u00f6m, 2004), although limitations of physical\nhealth may reduce social participation (Yong, 2012). The\nresearch team theorized that as members experience inter-\npersonal trust with group members, they may also experi-\nence reciprocity of social support and a sense of belonging to\nthe group that leads to future experiences of trust, reciprocity\nof social support, and a continued sense of belonging experi-\nenced between group members. Furthermore, individuals\nmay experience enhanced positive mental health outcomes\nand have downstream effects of protective and improved\nphysical health outcomes.\nFrom the theoretical framework, investigators developed\nan in-depth interview guide using open-ended questions to\nelucidate participants' values, perceptions, attitudes, and\nopinions regarding social capital constructs, including reci-\nprocity between group members (Krishna & Shrader, 1999).\nInterview items included (a) study participants' group par-\nticipation in the past year; (b) identification of the one group\nthat was most important to them; (c) for the identified group,\nparticipants commented on the other group members' inter-\nest in helping others (Krishna & Shrader, 1999), which\ninvestigated the cultural norm and values held about reci-\nprocity within the group (Stone, 2001); and (d) the benefits\nreceived from the connections within the groups, which\ninformed whether participation in social networks was due to\na norm of reciprocity (e.g., act out of obligation or for the\nInterpersonal Trust\nwith Group Members\nReciprocity of\nSocial Support\nEnhanced Positive Mental Health\nPositive Physical Health\n(Downstream Effect)\nSense of Belonging\nPositive Mental Health\nTrust with Others\nFormal & Informal\nGroup\nMobility Limitations\nFigure 1.

Participants from\nthat program were included in Phase I of the study because\ninvestigators thought there may be additional mechanisms\nrelated to social capital that resulted in broader health\nbenefits.\nPhase I inclusion criteria for participants were African\nAmerican and White adults (ages 50 and above) who were\nresidents of South Carolina. Phase I study groups were\ndefined by three levels of religious participation: (a) HSMS\nparticipants (n = 24), (b) regular attendees of religious ser-\nvices who were not HSMS participants (i.e., attended reli-\ngious services at least once a month; n = 24), and (c)\ninfrequent/non-attendees of religious services (i.e., did not\nattend religious services more than twice a year; n = 24),\neach level stratified by race--AfricanAmerican and White--\nfor a total of six study groups of n = 12 each. The HSMS\nparticipants were randomly selected to participate in the in-\ndepth interviews. Regular attendees of religious services and\ninfrequent/non-attendees of religious services were selected\nusing a snowball sampling method from eight counties in\nSouth Carolina.\nAll interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and\nresearchers provided hand-written notes for each interview.\nInterviews were coded using QSR NVIVO7 software (QSR\nInternational, Burlington, Massachusetts, United States).\nEach transcript was independently reviewed and analyzed\nby two researchers (H.C.P. and M.C.M.) using an open cod-\ning process (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). Themes were identi-\nfied across the six study groups based on supporting\ncomments from at least two participants. Coders met on a\nfrequent basis to discuss and compare the themes they iden-\ntified independently and discussed coding issues until agree-\nment was reached. The codebook contained a list of defined\ncodes.\nPhase I: Results\nSeventy-six percent (n = 55) of the participants were women.\nAll participants were 50 years or older (M = 66 years, SD =\n10.90). Table 2 highlights Phase I participant demographic\ncharacteristics. Thematic analysis identified the types of\ngroups to which participants belonged (i.e., community- and/\nor congregation-based groups); the most important groups in\nwhich they participated (i.e., community- and/or congregation-\nbased groups); their group's interest in helping others,\nwhether within and/or outside their group; and reported ben-\nefits of group participation, usually described in terms of the\nsocial support participants provided and/or received in their\ngroup. Comments reflected the types of social support expe-\nrienced: tangible, emotional, informational, positive social\ninteraction, and spiritual (Krause, 2002; Sherbourne &\nTable 2.

During the\nsecond study phase, investigators developed 63 items to\nmeasure reciprocity of social support. An expert review\npanel with relevant expertise in medicine, social work, social\ndeterminants of health, epidemiology, and health promotion,\nplayed an integral role by helping to guide the development\nof the questionnaire. The panel met twice a month for\napproximately 6 months to determine which questions to\ninclude in the social capital measures. Item inclusion was\nbased on items that were theoretically congruent with the\nreciprocal nature of social support provided and received in\na group setting, consistent with the literature or qualitative\nfindings, and structurally appropriate (i.e., concise, not dou-\nble barreled, without multiple negatives; DeVellis, 2003).\nPhase II: Item Selection\nThe reciprocity scale development was part of a larger proj-\nect to develop and test a comprehensive measure of social\ncapital for community groups. Therefore, to reduce partici-\npant burden in this study and in future studies, 10 items were\nselected from the item pool based on the relevance to the\nstudy population from the original 63 items. Five items were\nselected to measure the likelihood the participant would pro-\nvide social support to group members, and 5 items were\nselected to measure the likelihood the participant would\nreceive social support from group members.\nItems were informed primarily by the work of Sherbourne\nand Stewart (1991). The item on emotional support, that is,\npositive feeling from experience with group members was\nderived from participant comments about helping others or\nbeing helped during times of personal and emotional diffi-\nculties, producing the phrase following the stem \"to get\nthrough a difficult time emotionally.\" Positive social interac-\ntion, defined as the availability of sharing enjoyed activities,\nwas reflected in the item \"to do something enjoyable with.\"\nInformational support, offering or receiving advice, informa-\ntion, guidance, or feedback, was assessed by the item \"to\nshare (your/their) experiences and knowledge.\" Spiritual\nsupport (Krause, 2002), characterized as support in the realm\nof faith beliefs, was based on participant comments about\nfeeling supported on their faith journey, finding spiritual\nguidance, and most frequently providing and receiving\nprayers, which led to the item, \"to provide spiritual support,\nthat is, pray for (you/them).\" Sherbourne and Stewart (1991)\ndefine tangible support as provision of material aid and\nbehavioral assistance. Participants commented on assisting\nothers and/or being assisted usually during an illness, which\nled to the item \"to take a meal if (they/you) were sick.\"\nPhase III: Cognitive Interviews\nThe items and question formats for the social capital mea-\nsures, including the RSS Scale items, were examined using\ncognitive interviews (n = 40) to support content validity.\nCognitive interview participants' demographic characteris-\ntics were similar to participants who completed the survey in\nPhase IV (see Table 2). Participants were asked to discuss\ntheir reactions to the 10 reciprocity items to identify issues\nrelated to order, comprehension, wording, clarity, and\nresponse categories (Willis, 2005). Field researchers (HP and\nMM) and expert review panel iteratively reviewed field\nnotes and made subsequent changes to the scale based on\nparticipant feedback.\nPhase III: Results\nThe cognitive interviews led to modifications to the page for-\nmat, directions, item wording, and response categories. The\nsample size was expanded until no new instrumentation\nissues emerged; ultimately, cognitive interviews were used\nto examine nine versions of the RSS Scale. See Table 3 for\nthe final RSS Scale items.\nPhase IV: Procedures Used for Testing\nPsychometric Properties\nFollowing content validation from the in-depth interviews,\nexpert panel review of scale items, and cognitive interviews,\na variety of psychometric methods were utilized in Phase IV\nto evaluate reliability and validity of the RSS Scale, and sep-\narate analyses were run for the community- and congrega-\ntion-based groups.\nParticipants for Phase IV were a convenience sample of\n500 adults. Researchers (H.C.P. and M.C.M.) recruited\nPope et al. 7\nindividuals from various community settings (e.g., parks,\nworkplaces, laundromats, flea markets, convenience stores,\nrecreational centers, fund raising events, civic clubs, and\nchurches) to achieve a diverse sample that varied by age,\nrace, and education.\nPhase IV: Study Measures\nIn addition to the RSS Scale, other measures developed for\nthe larger project to assess social capital in community\ngroups were administered at the same time and included an\n11-item RCG Trust Scale and a 2-item RCG Sense of\nBelonging Scale, developed by the authors using the same\nrigorous procedures as the RSS Scale and will be reported in\nseparate manuscripts.\nRSS Scale. The 10-item scale assessed the social support pro-\nvided and received within each participant's community-\nand/or congregation-based group. The RSS Scale is displayed\nin Table 3. A Likert-type 5-item response scale was used for\nall items (1 = not at all to 5 = very likely), which was scored\nby taking mean scores of the responses for the 10 items.\nHigher scores indicated higher levels of reciprocity of social\nsupport in the group.\nRCG Trust Scale.An 11-item scale was developed to assess\ntrust in community- and/or congregation-based groups.

According to Hatcher (1994), the minimal number of\nsubjects for EFA should be greater than 100, or 5 times the\nnumber of variables being analyzed; therefore, the study\ngroups were an adequate sample size for the analysis.\nConvergent validity, a form of construct validity, was\ntested by Pearson correlation analyses between the RSS\nScale and the RCG Trust Scale in community- and congrega-\ntion-based groups.

It was hypothesized that the RSS Scale and the\nLSNS-6 assess related although distinct constructs; there-\nfore, it was predicted that there would be weak positive cor-\nrelations between the RSS Scale and the LSNS- 6.

When the items with low loadings were dropped (Items 4, 5, 9, and 10), the two-factor model was run again with the\nsix items that originally had high loadings (above .40).\nbTotal number of participants exceed n = 500 because each participant could report they belonged to community- or congregation-based groups, or both.\nEFA\nThe responses to the 10-item RSS Scale were subjected to an\nEFA using squared multiple correlations as prior communal-\nity estimates. The principle factor method was used to extract\nthe factors. A rotation was not possible. A scree test sug-\ngested two meaningful factors. The results of the EFA are\ndisplayed in Table 4. A factor loading 0.40 is considered\ndesirable in social science research (Costello & Osborne,\nEFA- and Community-Based Groups\nFor both types of groups, a two-factor model was used based\non the hypothesis that social support is provided and received\nby members of a group. For members of community-based\ngroups, Items 1, 2, and 3, all related to providing support to\nother group members, loaded strongly on the first factor (fac-\nrelated to support received from members of the community\ngroup. Items 4 and 9 (spiritual support) and 5 and 10 (tangi-\nble support, that is, take a meal if they were sick) evidenced\nlow-loadings (below 0.40) for both factors in the community\ngroup members. When the items with low loadings were\ndropped (Items 4, 5, 9, and 10), the two-factor model was run\nagain with the six items that originally had high loadings\n(above 0.40). Results indicated a model fit for a two-factor\nmodel. From the original items, Items 1, 2, and 3 loaded\nstrongly on the first factor, social support provided to\nmembers of a community group, now ranging from 0.68 to\n0.74, and Items 6, 7, and 8 loaded strongly on the second fac-\ntor, social support received from members of a community\nEFA- and Congregation-Based Groups\nFor congregation-based groups, a parallel two-factor model\nwas tested. Items 1 to 5 loaded strongly on the first factor\n(0.51-0.82), for social support provided to members of a con-\ngregation-based group. Items 6 to 10 loaded strongly on the\nmembers of a congregation-based group.\nConvergent Validity\nThe RSS Scale had a very strong positive association with\nthe RCG Trust Scale for community- (r = .71) and congrega-\nScale had a strong positive association with the RCG Sense\nof Belonging Scale for community- (r = .60) and congrega-\nconvergent validity was established based on analyses.\nDivergent Validity\nThe RSS Scale had a weak positive association with the\ndivergent validity.\nPope et al. 9\nInternal Reliability\nCronbach's  values were high and consistent within the\nRSS Scale for both study groups. The raw  coefficient for\nthe reciprocity scale was .92 for community-based groups\nand .93 for congregation-based groups, well above the\ncommunity-based groups, the raw  coefficient for the sub-\nscale social support provided was .87 and was .89 for the\nsubscale social support received. In congregation-based\ngroups, the raw  coefficient for the subscale social support\nprovided was .87 and was .91 for the subscale social support\nreceived. Removal of any items did not dramatically alter the\ninternal reliability of the scale. See Table 4 for the results of\nthe EFA using a two-factor model and Cronbach's  values if\nan item was removed for community-based groups and con-\ngregation-based groups.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first scale developed to mea-\nsure reciprocity of social support that is suitable for commu-\nnity- and congregation-based groups that has been created\nusing a rigorous scale development process. Results indi-\ncated that the scale performed very well on tests of reliability\nand validity--content validity and different forms of con-\nstruct validity, including convergent and divergent validity.\nNorms of reciprocity were explored in community- and\ncongregation-based groups using in-depth interviews.\nThrough cognitive interviews and an expert review panel,\nitems and response categories were assessed, strengthening\nthe scale's content validity (Knafl et al., 2007) and readabil-\nity, allowing the scale to be self-administered.\nThe RSS Scale performed as expected in validity tests.\nScree test findings suggested two meaningful factors. This\nprocedure helped inform the decision to use a two-factor\nmodel, which reinforced the research team's hypothesis of\nthe conceptual nature of reciprocity of social support, spe-\ncifically that social support is provided (Factor 1) and\nreceived (Factor 2). The EFA provided evidence that the\nitems capture reciprocity of social support as two-factor\nmodels for both group types. It was hypothesized that there\nwould be two factors of the reciprocity of social support--\nthe first, social support provided to group members (Items\n1-5), and the second, social support received from group\nmembers (Items 6-10). Results indicated that the norms for\nreciprocity of social support in community-based groups\ninclude providing and receiving emotional social support,\npositive social interaction, and informational social support,\nwhich has been found to have protective effects on mental\nhealth (Berkman & Glass, 2000; Gjerdingen, Froberg, &\nsocial support did not have adequate factor loadings in a two-\nfactor model for community-based groups; therefore, these\nitems (4, 5, 9, and 10) can be excluded when measuring reci-\nprocity of social support in community-based groups.\nHowever, the results of the EFA for norms of reciprocity\nin congregation-based groups included all 10 items.\nTherefore, the additive value of belonging to a congregation-\nbased group compared with a community-based group may\nstem from providing and receiving spiritual and tangible\nsocial support. For future studies, the full scale may be used\nto explain the buffering effects of congregation-based groups\non health outcomes compared with community-based\ngroups.\nAs hypothesized, tests of convergent validity supported\nvery strong positive correlations between the RSS Scale and\nthe RCG Trust Scale for the community- and congregation-\nand strong positive correlations for the RSS Scale and the\nRCG Sense of Belonging Scale for the community- and con-\nstudy groups). Tests of divergent validity of the RSS Scale\nand the LSNS-6 demonstrated a weak positive association\nThe Cronbach's  values obtained in this study indicated\nthat the items for community groups ( = .90-.91) and church\ngroups ( = .92-.93) were highly correlated.\nResults of this study provided evidence that community-\nand congregation-based groups contribute to reciprocal\nsocial support. Although results indicated that congregation-\nbased groups contribute to higher levels of reciprocity of\nsocial support, levels were not significantly higher than com-\nmunity-based groups and thus do not confirm a difference in\nreciprocity of social support for these groups. However, the\ndifferences in item loadings for four factor suggest there are\naspects of reciprocity that differ between the two types of\ngroups. Currently, there is a lack of literature comparing reci-\nprocity of social support in community- and congregation-\nbased groups, so there is no empirical literature with which\nresults can be compared. Further research is needed to\nexplore whether significant differences in levels of reciproc-\nity of social support exist within particular community- (e.g.,\nvolunteer groups) and congregation-based groups (e.g.,\nfaith-based support groups, prayer groups).\nAlthough reciprocity is a core construct of social capital\n(Stone, 2001), little is known about it, as it is very rarely\ntheorized, defined, or measured (Abbott & Freeth, 2008).\nPrevious studies suggest that reciprocity is an indicator of the\nquality of social relationships (Stone, 2001), results in tan-\ngible and intangible resources (Cattell, 2001), facilitates\naccess to resources (Hurtado et al., 2011), and impacts peo-\nple's abilities to solve common problems through collective\nZakus & Lysack, 1998). Therefore, a valid and reliable mea-\nsure of reciprocity is needed to determine if reciprocity of\nsocial support experienced in different types of groups (i.e.,\ncommunity-based groups and congregation-based groups)\ndifferentially affect health outcomes; Morgan & Swann,\nTo address this paucity, the RSS Scale will now allow for\nmore sophisticated social capital theories to be examined and\nwill assist in the advancement of understanding the relation-\nship between reciprocity of social support in community-\nand congregation-based groups and the associations of\nprotective health effects, particularly on mental health. If an\nassociation does exist, reciprocity of social support may be a\ntargeted strategy for the prevention and management of\nchronic illnesses or the maintenance of healthy behaviors.\nKawachi and Berkman (2001) found that protective\neffects of social ties on mental health are not uniform across\ngroups in society. Therefore, this measure may enable detec-\ntion of variation in social support reciprocity among com-\nmunity- and congregation-based groups by demographic\ncharacteristics (i.e., age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and\nsocioeconomic status).\nLimitations\nThe RSS Scale demonstrated reliability and validity in the\nsample in which it was developed; however, these findings\nshould be interpreted in light of several limitations. This\nstudy used a convenience sample. Participants' reciprocal\nbehaviors related to social support may not have been repre-\nsentative of the larger population. Importantly, religious\nhomogeneity of the qualitative work and validity sample\nlimits the generalizability of the scale's validity. The in-depth\ninterviews were conducted with individuals belonging to a\nChristian Protestant denomination and the validity sample\nincluded only individuals of Christian faith. This is an indi-\ncation where the scale is relevant for the Christian popula-\ntion, but may be less applicable in other faith traditions (e.g.,\nJudaism or Eastern religious traditions).\nIn addition, the in-depth interviews that guided item for-\nmation were performed in a population of adults aged 50 and\nabove; other aspects of reciprocity may not have been cap-\ntured that are relevant to younger age groups. Moreover,\nwomen were overrepresented in the in-depth interviews and\nduring administration of the instrument. However, reliability\nand validity testing indicated positive findings when admin-\nistered to the study sample that ranged from ages 18 to 94\nand to men, which indicates the scale is appropriate to use in\nvarious age groups and for men and women.\nFinally, this scale may not be appropriate to use outside\nthe Southern United States. The scales were developed in\ncommunities across South Carolina, which included high-\nincome and very-low-income areas; however, further psy-\nchometric testing is needed for the scales if used in varied\ngeographic and developing regions, so the items reflect the\nnorms of reciprocity specific to the contexts of interest. For\nexample, participants in this study did not identify self-\nesteem as an important dimension of social support, which\nrefers to others'communications indicating the person is val-\nued (e.g., letting the person know they are competent at\nsomething or have an admired personal quality; Cohen &\nWills, 1985). However, self-esteem has been found to be an\nimportant dimension of support among various populations\nin previous studies (Brookings & Bolton, 1988; Cohen &\nConclusion and Future Research\nThe RSS Scale for community- and congregation-based\ngroups was developed over a 2-year process, which included\nqualitative work for item development and validity and reli-\nability testing. To our knowledge, this scale is the first with\nproven psychometric properties that can be recommended\nfor utilization in future research investigating reciprocity of\nsocial support in community- and congregation-based\ngroups. An interesting finding from the study, as indicated by\nthe EFA, was that the norms of reciprocity of social support\nfor church groups include spiritual and tangible social sup-\nport. Future research should focus on understanding the\nadditive value of belonging to a congregation-based group\ncompared with other community-based groups, and whether\nthe additive value of a congregation-based group is associ-\nated with protective mental and physical health outcomes.\nFurthermore, our results showed small differences in mean\nRSS scores across different group settings (i.e., higher, but\nnot significantly different scores in congregation-based\ngroups compared with community-based groups). Further\nresearch is needed to investigate these differences and deter-\nmine the implications of reciprocity in specific group set-\ntings. Recommendations of future research include adapting\nthe scale for use in other faith communities and additional\ncultures, including developing countries and various ethnic\nand religious populations.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This arti-\ncle was supported by a grant from the John Templeton Foundation.\nReferences\nAbbott, S.
