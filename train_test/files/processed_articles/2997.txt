However, the\nfindings of cross-sectional, population-\nbased studies of BP and cognitive func-\ntion in the elderly have varied greatly.\nSome studies found higher rates of cog-\nnitive impairment associated with el-\nevated BP,5 others with low BP,6 and\nother studies found little or no associa-\ntion.7 These results mirror the conflict-\ning associations between BP and cardio-\nvascular disease mortality found in\nobservational studies of the elderly.8\nInterpretation of cross-sectional rela-\ntionships between BP and cognitive func-\ntion is problematic because dementia it-\nself may affect BP through its effects on\ndiet9 and weight loss.10 Studies of the re-\nlationships of midlife BP with late-life\ncognitive function assessed at a single\ntime point, in the Framingham11 and Ho-\nnolulu12 heart studies and in an Uppsala\nstudy,13 found higher proportions with\ncognitive impairment among those with\nelevated BP during midlife.

Subjects were aged 65 to 102 years at baseline in the EPESE\nand had mental status and memory assessed at baseline and 3 and 6 years.\nMain Outcome Measures Numbers of errors on the Short Portable Mental Status\nQuestionnaire and the East Boston Memory Test and rates of change in these num-\nbers of errors. Subjects had BP measured both at baseline in the EPESE and 9 years\nbefore, as part of the HDFP.\nResults In analyses adjusted for age, sex, and education, there was no strong linear\nassociation between BP and cognition. The associations found were fairly small in mag-\nnitude, and varied according to which test was used to measure cognition. There was\nlittle evidence for an effect of BP on change in cognitive function with either test, or\nfor an effect on level of function on the memory test. In analyses of level of mental\nstatus questionnaire performance, however, elevated systolic BP (160 mm Hg) 9 years\nbefore baseline was associated with a 14% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4%-25%)\nincrease in error rate, relative to the referent (130-139 mm Hg). Baseline systolic BP\nhad a U-shaped association with the number of errors; error rates were 9% higher\ncompared with the referent group among those with systolic BP lower than 130 mm\nevated systolic BP. Diastolic BP 9 years before baseline also had a U-shaped associa-\ntion with errors on the mental status questionnaire.\nConclusion The findings do not suggest a linear association of BP with cognitive\ndecline, but they are consistent with a more complex relationship between BP and cog-\nnition than previously appreciated.\nmeasurements 9 years before the begin-\nning of this study as part of the Hyper-\ntension Detection and Follow-up Pro-\ngram (HDFP). This allowed us to\nexamine the relationships of both ear-\nlier and concurrent BP measurements\nwith level of and change in cognitive\nfunction.\nMETHODS\nSubjects and Data Collection\ntional Institute on Aging's EPESE project,\na census identified 4497 noninstitution-\nalized residents, 65 years or older, of East\nterviewed in their homes, either in per-\nson or through a proxy. Blood pressure\nwas measured 3 times at intervals of 30\nseconds, while the subject was seated, ac-\ncording to the protocol of the HDFP.17\nThe interviewer also administered a 6-\nitem memory test (the East Boston\nMemory Test18 [EBMT]) and a 9-item ver-\nsion of the Pfeiffer Short Portable Men-\ntal Status Questionnaire19 (SPMSQ) (the\nquestion, \"What is the name of this\nplace?\" was omitted from these home in-\nterviews). The SPMSQ has been shown\nto be valid and reliable,18,19 and the sen-\nsitivity and positive predictive value of\nthe EBMT in detecting clinically diag-\nnosed cognitive impairment are at least\ncomparable to 2 other commonly used\nbrief cognitive tests.18,20 For this study,\nticipantswith baseline BP measures; 3586\ncompleted the EBMT.\nThe interviewer also collected infor-\nmation about other characteristics po-\ntentially related both to BP and cogni-\ntive function. Participants were asked\ntheir number of years of formal school-\ning, their present and past use of ciga-\nrettes and alcohol, and whether they had\na history of myocardial infarction or\nstroke. Angina was identified by the Rose\nquestionnaire.21 All medications used in\nthe past 2 weeks were identified by di-\nrect inspection.\nNine years before this baseline assess-\nment, 2068 of the study participants had\ntheir BP measured in their homes by the\nsame protocol, as part of the population-\nbased screening visit (completed by 89%\nof enumerated residents) for the HDFP\nclinical trial.17 Because the trial had an\nupper age limit, all of these participants\nwere 81 years or younger at the base-\nline EPESE evaluation. Within the age\npants had BP measurements taken 9 years\npreviously. We linked data from these\nindividuals to allow for evaluation of the\nrelationship of earlier BP measure-\nments with level and change in cogni-\ntive function from 9 to 15 years later.\nIn-home,follow-upinterviewsoccurred\n3 and 6 years after baseline and included\nthe same measures of cognitive function\ncohort members at the time of the 3-year\n2502 participants alive at the time of the\nAdditionally, 69 participants had miss-\ning data on their number of years of edu-\ncation. These individuals were excluded\nfrommultivariateanalysescontrollingfor\neducation. Hence, multivariate analyses\nof SPMSQ scores at all 3 times included\nparable analyses of memory scores in-\nmation about demographic characteris-\ntics of the population,22 quality control\nof BP measurements,23 and participation\nin assessment ofcognitivefunction24 has\nbeen published elsewhere.\nStatistical Methods\nThe outcomes of interest were the num-\nbers of errors in the SPMSQ and the\nEBMT, and changes in these numbers\nover time. For both analyses of baseline\nBP and BP measured 9 years earlier, we\ncalculated the systolic and diastolic lev-\nels of each subject as the averages of the\n3 measurements, respectively. In initial\ngraphical analyses we explored the re-\nlationships of systolic and diastolic BP,\nboth at baseline and 9 years earlier, with\nthe baseline numbers of errors on both\ntests, using the square roots of these num-\nbers to stabilize their variance. These\nanalyses used robust, local-weighted re-\ngression techniques25 to fit smooth curves\nwithout assumptions about the paramet-\nric form of the relationships between BP\nand numbers of errors. The graphs sug-\ngested that relationships between BP and\ncognitive function were nonlinear, with\nsome elevations in numbers of errors\namong those with low or high BP. In sub-\nsequent analyses, we classified partici-\npants into 5 groups based on their sys-\ntolic BP or 4 groups based on their\ndiastolic BP. Categories used were the\nsame as those in a previous analysis of\nBP and mortality in this population,8 ex-\ncept that those with diastolic BP be-\nin the present analysis. Because of the\npossible U-shaped relationships be-\ntween BP and cognitive function at base-\nline, the reference group for systolic BP\nand for diastolic BP, we chose the group\nTo control for potential confounding\nvariables and to simultaneously exam-\nine cognitive function scores at all 3\nevaluations, we fitted multivariate re-\ngression models with a dependent vari-\nable of either the number of errors on a\ncognitive test or the rate of change in the\nsquare root of this number over time.\nWhen the dependent variable was the\nnumber of errors on a cognitive test at\nbaseline, 3-year, or 6-year follow-up, we\nused a Poisson regression model to re-\nlate categories of BP to this number. Pa-\nrameters in this model are interpreted as\nthe logarithm of the relative number of\nerrors comparing individuals in 1 cat-\negory of BP with the referent category.\nAlso included in the model was a scale\nterm for overdispersion because errors\nwere not random among individuals.26\nWe accounted for the correlation be-\ntween the repeated measures of cogni-\ntive function in the same persons by us-\ning the generalized estimating equation\napproach described by Liang and Zeger.27\nWe fitted models using SAS statistical\nsoftware and made no assumptions about\nthe values of the intercorrelations be-\ntween repeated measures.28 Potentially\nconfounding variables included in all\nmodels were age (centered at 75 years),\nage squared, age cubed (all 3 of these\nvariables were significantly related to\nnumbers of errors), education (in years),\nsex, and the relative effects of evalua-\ntion time (3-year and 6-year follow-up\ncompared with baseline). To examine the\nrelationship of BP with change in cog-\nnitive function over time, we added in-\nteraction terms between BP categories\nand time of evaluation (scored as 0 for\nbaseline, 1 for the 3-year follow-up, and\n2 for the 6-year follow-up).\nTo examine rates of change in num-\nbers of errors on cognitive tests we first\nobtained a slope for each person, based\non a univariate linear regression, that\ndescribed the rate of change over time\nin the square root of the number of\nerrors. Because the distribution of\nslopes was skewed and because slopes\nwere strongly related to baseline scores\non cognitive tests, we used a normal\nscores transformation to adjust for\nregression to the mean and obtain a\nmeasure of change independent of\nbaseline score.29 We did this by first\nranking the individual slopes separately\nwithin each level of baseline score. We\nthen transformed these ranks to the\nvalue, or normal score, that corre-\nsponded to the percentile of a normal\ndistribution with mean 0 and variance\n1.30 These normal scores were then\nused as dependent variables in multiple\nlinear regression models that included\nthe same independent variables as the\nPoisson regression models except for\nthe indicators of evaluation time.\nWe repeated multivariate analyses\nwithin strata to examine potential modi-\nfication of relationships by comorbidity\nor use of antihypertensive medications;\nanother analysis included tobacco and al-\ncohol intake. One analysis of people with\ndiseases potentially affecting cognitive\nfunction was restricted to those who re-\nported at baseline a history of myocar-\ndial infarction or stroke, had angina ac-\ncording to the Rose questionnaire, or\nwere using digoxin, loop diuretics, or hy-\npoglycemic agents. Another analysis con-\nsidered only those with none of these\nconditions. We also performed 2 sepa-\nrate analyses stratified according to\nwhether participants were taking anti-\nhypertensive medications (1) at base-\nline, or (2) at the time of BP assessment\n9 years before baseline.\nBecause nonparticipation in cogni-\ntive assessments can be related to actual\ncognitive abilities,31 we also fitted sev-\neral models after multiple imputation32\nof missing scores on the SPMSQ, based\non several alternative assumptions about\nthe patterns of missing data. However,\nwe noted little change in the effects of\nBP on cognitive function. Thus, these al-\nternative analyses are not presented.\nFigure 1.

Low\ndiastolic BP was possibly associated with\nagreaternumberoferrors,althoughinthis\nanalysispotentiallyconfoundingvariables\nwere not accounted for.\nSeveral characteristics known to be re-\nlated to the risk of lower scores on cog-\nnitive tests differed in their distribu-\ntions across categories of BP. Participants\nwith elevated systolic BP tended to be\nolder and to have less education\n(TABLE 1). Conversely, those with low\ndiastolic BP were older and had less edu-\ncation than those with both intermedi-\nate and elevated levels of diastolic BP\n(TABLE 2). After adjustment for age and\nsex, the prevalence of several condi-\ntions that may modify the association be-\ntween BP and cognitive function also var-\nied across categories of BP at baseline. A\nhistory of myocardial infarction and use\nof digoxin and loop diuretics were more\ncommon among those with low systolic\nBP, whereas drug treatment for diabe-\ntes and a history of stroke were more\ncommon among those with elevated sys-\ntolic BP.

Blood pres-\nsure was measured both at the time cog-\nnitive testing was done and, for a major\nfraction of the cohort, 9 years previ-\nously. Both level of cognitive perfor-\nmance and change in performance over\ntime were examined, and 2 different brief\ntests of cognition were used. Overall,\nresults did not demonstrate a linear as-\nsociation between BP and cognition. The\nresults do, however, raise the possibil-\nity of more complex associations.\nTable 2.

There\nwas little evidence for an effect of BP on\nchange in cognitive function with ei-\nther test; only elevated systolic BP mea-\nsured 9 years previously predicted an in-\ncreasing number of SPMSQ errors in 1\nof the analyses of change. For analyses\nof BP and level of cognition, the results\nvaried according to which test was used,\nbut within each test were reasonably con-\nsistent. For SPMSQ performance, per-\nsons with elevations either in systolic or\ndiastolic BP, either at baseline or 9 years\nearlier, had consistent and statistically sig-\nnificant elevations in error rates com-\npared with those in the referent catego-\nries of BP. Specifically, those with systolic\nBP of 160 mm Hg or higher, either at\nbaseline or 9 years earlier, and those with\ndiastolic BP of 90 mm Hg or above at ei-\nther time committed between 7% and\n14% more errors on the SPMSQ, com-\npared with the referent groups with sys-\nmm Hg, respectively. Furthermore, there\nwas a suggestion of a U-shaped associa-\ntion between performance on this mea-\nsure and both systolic BP at baseline and\ndiastolic BP 9 years previously, because\npersons in the lowest BP category also\nmade more errors than those in the ref-\nerent category. In contrast to these re-\nsults for the SPMSQ, there was little as-\nsociation between BP at either time and\nlevel of performance on the EBMT.\nThe magnitude of the observed asso-\nciations between low and high levels of\nBP and increased error rates on the\nSPMSQ can be understood in the con-\ntext of the observed associations of age\nand education with performance on\nthis test. Both the effects of age and\neducation were highly significant\n(P.001). In the model fitted to the\nBP effects are summarized in Figure 3,\nthe predicted error rate in persons aged\n78 years, relative to the referent group\ngreater. Similarly, relative to partici-\npants with any given educational level,\nthose with 2 fewer years of education\nwere predicted to have a 15% greater\nerror rate. It is also worth noting that in\nthe entire population both age and\neducation had similarly strong effects\non error rates on the EBMT, which pro-\nvides a frame of reference for the small\nobserved effects of BP on this measure.\nPrevious studies have suggested an as-\nsociation between lower cognitive func-\ntion in late life and elevations in BP mea-\nsured some years earlier. In the Longi-\ntudinal Population Study of persons aged\n\u00a8teborg, Sweden, the 76 in-\ndividuals who were not demented on ex-\namination at age 85 years had signifi-\ncantly lower mean systolic and diastolic\nFigure 3.

The first 3 of these\nstudiesfoundlittleassociationbetweenBP\nmeasured at the time of cognitive assess-\nment and level of cognitive function. This\nis consistent with our finding of a sub-\nstantial elevation in errors on the SPMSQ\nassociatedwithelevatedsystolicBP9years\nbefore baseline but an apparent U-\nshaped relationship between systolic BP\nat baseline and errors.\nStrengths of the study include the large\npopulation, with multiple longitudinal\nmeasurements of BP and cognitive per-\nformance. Perhaps the greatest limitation\nis that measures of cognitive function are\nrestricted to 2 brief tests. These tests have\nbeen used in previous population stud-\nthatmoredetailedtestingofcognitivefunc-\ntion would have provided more defini-\ntive results. Other limitations include the\nabsence of BP measurements during the\n9 years between the HDFP screening and\nthe baseline EPESE evaluation, and the\npossibility that the HDFP experience led\nto more intensive treatment of BP in East\nBoston. With regard to the last point, a\ncomparison between East Boston and 2\nother EPESE populations found compa-\nrable baseline rates of use of antihyper-\ntensive drugs across sites, and slightly\nhigher mean systolic BP and prevalence of\nelevated systolic BP (160 mm Hg) in\nOur prior hypotheses were that higher\nBP would be linearly associated with de-\ncline in cognitive function over the 6-\nyear period of cognitive testing, and that\ndecline would be more strongly pre-\ndicted by BP measured 9 years previ-\nously. Overall, our results do not sup-\nport these hypotheses, but they do not\nunequivocally reject an association be-\ntween high BP and cognitive decline. It\nis noteworthy that neither set of BP mea-\nsurements predicted change in cogni-\ntive function on either test (except that\nsystolic BP 160 mm Hg predicted de-\ncline in performance on the SPMSQ). In-\ndividual change in cognitive test perfor-\nmance may be a more meaningful\noutcome than level of performance at a\nsingle point in time since education and\ncultural factors also influence test per-\nformance. Individual change in test per-\nformance, on the other hand, is likely to\nprovide an unbiased measure of cogni-\ntion.29 Whether our findings are due to\nchance alone or reflect a more complex\nrelationship between BP and cognition\nthan previously appreciated remains un-\ncertain. The relationship of BP to cogni-\ntive function continues to deserve de-\ntailed investigation because of the great\npublic health importance of decline in\ncognition in later life and the need to\nidentify potentially modifiable risk fac-\ntors for this decline.
