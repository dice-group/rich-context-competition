This crucial\nprocess is controlled by histone acetyltranferase (HATs)\nand histone deacetyltransferase (HDACs) that are\ntogether responsible for the critical balance of acetylation\nand deacetylation within the cell. In its epigenetic func-\ntion, HDAC activity triggers condensed chromatin archi-\ntecture that limits transcription by removing acetyl\ngroups from histones. However, HDAC scan also con-\ntribute to nonepigenetic regulation in that HDACs are\ncapable of deacetylating and centrally regulating the\nactivity of several transcription factors as well as of\nHDACs have emerged as promising targets for thera-\npeutic interventions in pathological conditions, including\nneurodegenerative disorders, and HDAC inhibitors have\nbeen shown to rescue or delay neuronal death\nZalewska et al., 2014).

In this study, we have used specific genetic depletion\nof both HDAC1 and HDAC2 (HDAC1/2) in RGCs\nin vivo to avoid misguiding off-target effects.

We decided\nto analyze HDAC1/2 double mutants, since HDAC1\nand HDAC2 can often compensate for each other\nsystem, two copies of the Thy1 promoter are used in\nopposite direction (back-to-back) to simultaneously\nexpress CreRT2 and (yellow fluorescent protein) YFP\nin the same cells. Using retinal immunohistochemistry\nin transgenic mice without tamoxifen injection, we\ndetected a strong YFP signal in the retinal ganglion cell\nlayer and weaker signals in some cells of the inner nuclear\nlayer. All RGCs, retrogradely labeled with FG, were YFP\npositive (Figure 1(b)) confirming previous observations\nusing Thy-1-YFP: Thy-1-CreERT2 (SLICK-H) mice\n(Young et al., 2008). Next, we assessed the efficiency of\nHDAC1/2 loss in tamoxifen-injected HDAC1/2-double\nmutants by immunochemistry. Both HDAC1 and\nHDAC2 were efficiently lost in YFP-positive cells of the\nganglion cell layer (Figure 1(c)), establishing the suitabil-\nity of this genetic model to eliminate HDAC1/2 expres-\nsion in RGCs.\nAblation of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in RGCs Promotes\nTheir Survival After Injury\nNext, we addressed the in vivo neuroprotection potential\ndue to specific HDAC1/2 depletion using optic nerve\naxotomy as injury model in our genetic HDAC1/2\nmutants (Figure 2(a)).

To address this\nissue, we analyzed retinal transcriptome profiles of\nHDAC1/2 mutants and control retinae, with or without\ninjury, by RNAseq. We decided to analyze retinas 2 days\npostinjury (2 dpi), prior to the onset of evident RGC\ndeath that starts around 5 dpi, to avoid major over-\nshadowing secondary effects due to massive cell death\nLebrun-Julien et al., 2009).

A comparison of those data with our data from\ninjured control retinae revealed, despite the use of slightly\ndifferent injury models, that nine of their ``top 10'' upre-\ngulated transcripts and five of their ``top 10'' downregu-\nlated transcripts overlap with our top 20 up- and\ndownregulated transcripts (Table 1). Next, we started\nwith a systematic analysis by comparing first intact unin-\njured retinae from HDAC1/2 mutants to controls\n(Figure 3(a) and (b)). This analysis revealed a global\ngene expression shift with 5,569 genes significantly\nin HDAC1/2 mutants (Figure 3(b)). A similar proportion\nof activated versus repressed genes has also been\nobserved in cells treated with HDAC inhibitors\nthese findings and based on additional comparative ana-\nlyses of the available four different data sets (controls,\nHDAC1/2 mutants, both intact and injured; Table 2;\nFigure 3(a) and (b)), we decided to focus our further\nevaluations on those genes that were most significantly\nregulated after injury in controls. We hypothesized that\nexpression changes in these genes have a high likelihood\nto regulate the ensuing neuronal cell death and survival.\nIn addition, comparing the level of regulation of these\ngenes with that observed between uninjured and injured\nHDAC1/2 mutants, in combination with a candidate\nselection approach, may allow us to filter out relevant\nregulators that are altered due to HDAC1/2 depletion\nand might be involved in the ensuing neuroprotection\neffect. Thus, we generated a heat map of the changes of\nthe top up- and downregulated genes using R software\n(Figure 3(c)). A similar regulation pattern appeared for\nchanges in controls and in the HDAC1/2 mutants.\nHowever, closer inspections, applying the criteria out-\nlined above, identified key components of the proapopto-\ntic JNK-p53 stress-activated pathway, including the JNK\ntarget c-Jun and two p53 targets, p21 and PUMA, to be\npotentially involved in the observed neuroprotection due\nto HDAC1/2 depletion (Figure 3(c) and (d)).\nComparable Activation of the JNK Pathway in\nControl and HDAC1/2-Ablated Retinae After Injury\nJNK is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase\nfamily (also known as the stress-activated protein kinases\nor SAPKs) that is activated in response to a variety of\ncellular stresses. Sustained activation contributes to cell\ndeath through different targets including c-Jun (Whitfield\nhave demonstrated that JNK signaling and its target\ntranscription factor c-Jun are activated in RGCs\nfollowing optic nerve injury. Furthermore, double defi-\nciency for Jnk2 and Jnk3 strongly protects mouse\nwe assessed the role of the JNK pathway in our model. At\nthe transcriptional level, RNA-seq analysis showed that\nthe JNK target c-Jun was increased in both HDAC1/2\nmutants and controls after injury, but the basal level and\nthe upregulation were lower in the mutant (Figures 3(c)\nand 4(a)). As expected, further analysis of the RNA-seq\ndata of injured control retinae revealed also upregulation\nof harakiri (Hrk), a regulator of cell death that belongs to\nthe family of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins that are\nmainly found in the nervous system tissue\nHowever, mutant injured retinae showed a comparable\nupregulation to controls, in line with a recent study con-\ncluding that Hrk is not the main effector for RGC death\nafter injury (Fernandes et al., 2013; Figures 3(c) and 4(a)).\np53 mRNA levels did not change after injury. However,\nthey were significantly lower in both intact and axoto-\nmized mutant retinas compared with controls\n(Figure 4(a)).\nNext, we examined the ability of HDAC1/2-ablated\nRGCs to activate the JNK pathway following injury.\nThus, we analyzed retinal homogenates of control and\nHDAC1/2 mutant mice after 2 dpi and 4 dpi. In both\nHDAC1/2 mutants and controls, the injury triggered\ncomparable activation by phosphorylation of JNK and\nits target c-Jun, sustained at 4 dpi in both cases\n(Figure 4(b)). Consistent with the observations at the\nmRNA level, the basal protein level of c-Jun was signifi-\ncantly lower in the intact mutant retinae but increased\nafter injury. Since Erk1/2, another mitogen-activated pro-\ntein kinase, is known to protect RGCs upon sustained\ntested also the ability of HDAC1/2-ablated RGCs to acti-\nvate this pathway. We observed similar activation of\nErk1/2 at 2 dpi and 4 dpi both in the mutant and control\nretinae (Figure 4(b)). Taken together, these data indicate\nthat HDAC1/2 mutants retain largely the ability to acti-\nvate the MAP kinase pathways.\nTranscription of PUMA and p21 Is Impaired in\nHDAC1/2-Ablated and Axotomized RGCs\nWe decided to follow-up on the observed lower p53 levels\nin HDAC1/2 mutants compared with controls\n(Figure 4(a)) since p53 is a major regulator of apoptosis\ntion factor in intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis signaling\npathways by initiating transcription of mRNAs that\nencodeproapoptotic proteins such as PUMA, Bax, Fas/\nCD95, PERP, and TRAIL, as well as cell cycle arrest\nBeckerman and Prives, 2010).

Inspection of the RNA-seq\ndata revealed a strong increase of two main p53 targets,\np21 and PUMA after injury in controls, but not in\nincluding Perp, Fas, and Trail showed no significant dif-\nferences (Figure 5(a)). We validated the RNA-seq data by\nqRT-PCR, including a second time point at 4 dpi\n(Figure 5(b)). Of interest, Fas mRNA levels were not\nchanged at 2 dpi, but increased both in HDAC1/2\nmutants and controls at 4 dpi (Figure 5(b)). To corrob-\norate the data at the protein level, we performed Western\nblot analysis of retina samples. As on the mRNA level,\nPUMA and p21were increased in controls at both time\npoints after injury, while there were no significant\nchanges in the HDAC1/2 mutants (Figure 5(c)). As\nexpected, Fas was upregulated in both HDAC1/2\nmutants and controls at 4 dpi and also significantly at\n2 dpi in controls with a trend in mutants (Figure 5(c)).\nSince we used whole retina extracts for these analyses,\ncontributions by other cell types may mask partially\nsignal differences. Thus, we analyzed PUMA expression\nin RGCs at the cellular level using immunohistochemis-\ntry. The injury induced a robust increase of PUMA in\nFG-labeled RGCs in controls at 4 dpi, whereas HDAC1/\n2-ablated RGCs showed no difference compared with\ncontrol intact retinae (Figure 5(d)). Collectively, these\ndata indicate that correct selective activation of p21 and\nthe proapoptotic target PUMA fails as an early response\nafter optic nerve injury in HDAC1/2 mutants, likely\nmediated by altered p53.\nIncreased Acetylation at K381 Reduces the\nProapoptotic Activity of p53 in Axotomized\nPosttranslational modifications of p53 are essential for its\nactivation and appropriate acetylation of p53 on key\nlysine residues of the C-terminal region is needed to\ninduce full transcription of its target genes (Gu and\nA recent in vitro study suggests that acetylation of p53\nlent of mouse K379) inhibits its ability to activate tran-\nscription of PUMA in cortical neurons (Brochier et al.,\n2013). Following a related rationale, we analyzed post-\ntranslational modifications of p53 in HDAC1/2-ablated\nRGCs compared with control at 2 dpi and 4 dpi. Even\nthough the amount of p53 mRNA was decreased in\nHDAC1/2 mutant retinae compared with controls, both\nwith and without injury (Figure 4(a) and (b)), we detected\nno significant changes at the protein level (Figure 6(a)).\nHowever, in control retinae at both time points analyzed\nafter injury, we found increased phosphorylation of p53\nat serine (S15), which is correlated with the ability of p53\nto trigger apoptosis (Olsson et al., 2007; Boehme and\nBlattner, 2009; Figure 6(a) and (b)). These data are con-\nsistent with findings in the rat model of axotomy (Wilson\nwith the observed parallel increase of PUMA expression\n(Figure 5(d)). HDAC1/2-ablated RGCs showed only\nsparse p53 phospho-S15 signals by immunohistochemis-\ntry and no detectable change by Western blot analysis\n(Figure 6(a) and (b)). Next, we analyzed the acetylation\npattern of p53 on the two key lysine residues, K381 and\nK379. No significant differences comparing HDAC1/2\nmutant and control retinae were detected on residue\nK379 with or without axotomy (Figure 6(a)). However,\nwe found that axotomy triggered significant deacetylation\nof K381 in control retinae, both at 2 dpi and 4 dpi.\nHDAC1/2 ablation in RGCs revealed a trend of\nincreased acetylation early after injury (2 dpi), in line\nwith impairment of p53 activation and transcription of\nits proapoptotic target PUMA. At 4 dpi, we discovered\nthat K381 acetylation was significantly reduced in\nHDAC1/2-ablated RGCs by a yet unknown mechanism.\nDiscussion\nThe present study explored the functions of HDACs\nduring neurodegeneration. More specifically, we investi-\ngated the role of HDAC1/2 in the regulation of adult\nRGC survival in vivo using specific and accurate genetic\ntools. Our study supports four major conclusions. First,\ncombined specific ablation of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in\nRGCs promotes neuroprotection following axonal\ninjury in vivo. Second, the JNK-p53-PUMA pathway is\nactivated following injury in axotomized mouse RGCs.\nIn HDAC1/2-ablated RGCs, p53 activation and the tran-\nscription of its proapoptotic target PUMA are signifi-\ncantly impaired. Third, this inability of HDAC1/2\nmutants to activate p53 correlates with the abnormal\ninhibition provides a specific target for the development\nof neuroprotective therapies.\nHDACs inhibitors have been shown to be neuropro-\ntective in different neurodegenerative models both in vivo\nand in vitro, but the exact mechanisms of action are still\npoorly understood (Chuang et al., 2009). Since HDACs\nact on a wide variety of substrates including histones,\ntranscription factors, and cytosolic proteins, it is of para-\nmount importance to evaluate their function in each spe-\ncific cell type prior to the elaboration of new therapeutic\nstrategies. Therefore, to unravel the molecular mechan-\nisms that underlie the neuroprotective potential of\nHDAC inhibition, we created conditional knockout\nLebrun-Julien and Suter 11\nFigure 5.

Scale bar: 250 mm.\nmice for HDAC1 and HDAC2 in RGCs (Young et al.,\n2008). Here, we show that efficient genetic ablation of\nboth HDAC1 and HDAC2 in vivo promotes RGC sur-\nvival following injury. These results are consistent with\nrecent studies using injection of the HDACs inhibitor ms-\n275, active against HDAC1 and 3, or trichostatin A, an\ninhibitor of Class I and II HDACs, in an optic nerve\ninjury model (Gaub et al., 2011; Chindasub et al.,\n2013). Taken together, those studies showed that an over-\nall increase in cellular acetylation enhances survival of\nRGCs but did not provide definitive answers on specifi-\ncity issues. Others, also using trichostatin A, concluded\nthat histone deacetylation mainly by HDAC3 plays an\nimportant role in the early gene silencing response of\napoptotic RGCs (Pelzel et al., 2010). Partially following\nthis rationale, we performed an RNA-seq analysis of our\nretina samples to investigate the early response following\naxonal injury in the control compared with the HDAC1/\n2-ablated retinae. Another group recently published the\nretinal transcriptome at 2 days after optic nerve crush\ninjury; pathway analysis revealed a cell death and sur-\nvival response early after injury (Yasuda et al., 2014).\nThis study showed that ER stress was the major response\ntriggered, followed by other pathway alterations includ-\ning RGCs marker downregulation and immune response\nactivation. Our RNA-seq analysis in the axotomy model\nrevealed similar changes, sharing most the top upregu-\nlated and downregulated targets in control retinae\n(Yasuda et al., 2014). On the other hand, the mutant\nintact retinae revealed that HDAC1/2 ablation per se\ninduced already major modifications of the transcription\nprofile. Interestingly, more genes were downregulated\nrather than upregulated, confirming that HDAC function\nis more complex than only inducting gene repression.\n-Tub\nInt Int\nInt\nInt\nFluorogold\nGCL\ni\np\nd\ni\np\nd\nt\nc\na\nt\nn\nI\nControl\nIntact\nControl\nn.s.\nIntact\n*\n* **\nIntact\n* ***\nn.s.\nIntact\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 6.

Scale bar: 250 mm.\nLebrun-Julien and Suter 13\nWe cannot rule out that this gene expression shift played\na role in the neuroprotection effect observed after injury.\nHowever, despite this global transcriptome difference, the\nmost significantly upregulated and downregulated genes\ntriggered by the injury shared a similar pattern in the\nmutant retinae compared with controls. Indeed, we\nfound that the stress-activated protein kinase JNK, and\nits targets are likely to play important roles in the answer\nfollowing injury. Our data corroborate previous observa-\ntions showing that JNK and c-Jun are highly activated in\ninjured RGCs, and that deletion of Jnk2 and Jnk3 pro-\nmotes RGC survival (Fernandes et al., 2012). Here, we\nconfirmed that JNK and its target c-Jun are activated in\naxotomized RGCs in both the HDAC1/2 mutant and\ncontrol retinae. In addition, the mRNA level of the proa-\npoptotic target Hrk was also upregulated confirming pre-\nvious observations in axotomized RGCs (Wakabayashi\net al., 2002). However, these targets could not explain\nthe neuroprotective phenotype observed in the HDAC1/\n2 mutants. In stressed cells, JNK signaling can stabilize\nand activate the proapoptotic transcription factor p53\ncontrols after injury, resulting in increases at both the\ntranscription and protein level of two of its targets, p21\nand PUMA. In the HDAC1/2 mutant retinae, neither\np53 nor its targets were activated, leading us to the con-\nclusion that p53 may be responsible for the neuroprotec-\ntion effect observed.\nThe transcription factor p53 regulates neuronal apop-\ntosis during nervous system development, as well as in\nneurodegenerative conditions (Miller et al., 2000;\nMorrison and Kinoshita, 2000). In the developing\nretina, p53 is abundantly expressed and eventually\ndownregulated during maturation (O'Connor et al.,\naxotomized rat RGCs die in a p53-dependent manner\nthrough activation of the proapoptotic targets PUMA\nand Fas. They showed that RGCs abundantly express\nASPP1 and ASPP2, the apoptosis-stimulating proteins\nof p53, and that selective knockdown of those targets\nleads to RGC survival after injury in rats. In addition,\nsiRNA against PUMA or Fas conferred neuroprotec-\ntion in that study. Consistent with these findings, our\ndata in mice also showed an increase in Fas and PUMA\nin control axotomized RGCs, but only the increase in\nPUMA was impaired in HDAC1/2 mutants. These data\ncorroborate the critical role played by PUMA in injury-\ninduced RGC loss (Wilson et al., 2013). Transcription of\nFas through p53 was not altered in the HDAC1/2\nmutant retinae, which probably contributed to death\nof RGCs. Further experiments may help to explain\nwhy transcription of Fas remained in HDAC1/2\nmutants, although posttranscriptional modifications of\np53 is well known to differentially activate Fas following\nDNA damages (Kobayashi et al., 1998). Of note in this\ncontext, Fas and p53 have been reported to signal apop-\ntosis independently, depending of the cell type\nOur data demonstrate that p53 activation is impaired\nin HDAC1/2-ablated retinae. Regulation of p53 function\nis exerted via a plethora of posttranslational modifica-\ntions such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and methyla-\none of the first nonhistone proteins that was shown to be\nacetylated by histone acetyltranferase, p53 acetylation on\nthe C-terminus is commonly recognised as a stabilizing\nand activating modification (Gu and Roeder, 1997;\nBoehme and Blattner, 2009). However, more recent stu-\ndies suggested that specific acetylation of p53 at different\nsites can trigger or inhibit transcription of different target\ngenes in different cell type (Knights et al., 2006; Brochier\nacetylation status in the HDAC1/2 mutants might\naccount for the inability to trigger PUMA and p21\nexpression, we examined p53 acetylation at K381 and\nK382. In cultured cortical neurons, specific acetylation\nition prevented transcription of PUMA and p21 and lead\nto neuronal survival (Brochier et al., 2013). The same\nstudy showed that acetylation on the same site can trigger\nthe opposite effect in cancer cells, leading the authors to\nconclude that specific acetylation of p53 in different cell\ntype can trigger different effects. We detected parallel\ndeacetylation at K381 and increase phosphorylation at\nS15 of p53 in axotomized RGCs in control mice, pointing\ntoward the necessity of deacetylation of this lysine residue\nfor proper p53 activation. In contrast, in the HDAC1/2\nmutants, K381 remained highly acetylated after injury\nand no significantly increased phosphorylation of p53\nwas observed in RGCs, suggesting that HDAC1/2 is\nlikely to play a role in the deacetylation/activation of\np53 at K381 in RCGs. Further studies will be required\nto determine the extent of direct connections between\ntemporal and spatial regulation of HDAC1/2 activity,\ndegree of p53 acetylation, PUMA expression, and RGC\nsurvival. Also, additional analysis of other acetylation\nsites might provide a better understanding of the p53\nactivation process in different neuronal populations\nin vivo, but other possibilities may also be raised. For\nexample, specific acetylation of p53 could intervene in\nthe recruitment of neuron-specific cofactors, which\ncould in turn modulate the affinity of p53 for specific\npromoters (Sims and Reinberg, 2008). Furthermore,\nsince lysine residues that can be subjected to acetylation\nare also targeted by methyl-transferases, with opposing\neffects on p53 function, it will be of interest to analyse the\nmethylation profile of p53. For example, methylation at\nK372 can enhance p53-dependent transcription (Chuikov\nrepression of transcriptional activity (Huang et al., 2006).\nIn summary, we have generated an efficient mouse\nmodel for conditional recombination in adult mouse\nRGCs. By contributing to the molecular understanding\nof how specific ablation of HDAC1/2 is able to promote\nadult RGC survival after injury in vivo, our study pro-\nvides new insight into how HDAC inhibition can play a\nneuroprotective function. Understanding how the bal-\nance of acetylation/deacetylation leads to neuroprotec-\ntion is essential for the development of therapeutic\nstrategies for neurodegenerative diseases. Our data sug-\ngest that targeting specific acetylation of p53 at K381\nrepresents a relevant target.\n"
