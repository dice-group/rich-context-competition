Differences in energy intakes between groups\nwere not significant. Women who were food insecure without hunger (FIWOH) and food insecure with hunger (FIWH)\nhad significantly fewer meals than food secure (FS) women. The energy contribution of each meal and the total energy\ncontributed from snacking were both significantly greater for FIWOH women than for FS women. The number of meals\nwas significantly lower whereas the daily number of snacking occasions and the total energy from snacking were\nsignificantly increased for FIWOH men relative to FS men. FIWOH men consumed snack foods that had significantly\nlower energy density than those consumed by FS men. Among men and women, the major sources of meal energy\nwere the grain group, the meat, poultry, and fish group, and the sugar, sweets, and beverages group whereas the\nmajor source of snacking energy was the sugar, sweets, and beverages group. Total energy intakes were not different\nfor FI individuals; however, their meal and snack behaviors were different. Focusing solely on total energy intake would\nmiss important consequences of food insecurity.\nIntroduction\nFindings from the Current Population Survey indicate that in\n2006 11% of households in the United States were food insecure\n(FI), defined as having \"limited or uncertain availability of nutri-\ntionally adequate and safe food or limited or uncertain ability to\nacquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways\" (1,2). Food\ninsecurity has been associated with obesity, heart disease, diabe-\ntes, high blood pressure, and food allergies (3\u00ad7).\nDespite this vulnerability, very little research attention has\nbeen given to the diet of FI individuals. Three studies found that\nadult women who experienced food insufficiency/\ninsecurity\nhad lower energy intakes than those who reported food suf-\nficiency/security whereas one study found no differences in\nenergyintake(8\u00ad11).Anotherstudythatincludedbothmenand\nwomen found no differences in energy intake between adults\nfrom food-insufficient and food-sufficient households (12).\nResearchers have found that the majority of women in all\nlevels of food sufficiency reported between two and seven eat-\ning occasions per day, and there were no significant differences\nin number of eating occasions per day or the amount of nutri-\nents obtained from snacks (11). Other researchers have found\na reduced meal frequency among low-income and/or food\nstamp participants (13,14). In fact, skipping meals \"because\nthere wasn't enough money\" is one construct used to measure\nfood insecurity (2). To our knowledge, evidence of reduced\nmeal frequency has not been documented in FI individuals\nwith dietary assessment techniques, such as a 24-h recall.\nBecause of the paucity of the literature on this issue, we\nundertookthisstudytofurthertheunderstandingofthedietary\nbehaviors of FI individuals. Differences in dietary behaviors\nmay provide insights regarding the previously reported associ-\nation between obesity and food insecurity. Using a 24-h recall,\nwe examined the association between food insecurity and total\ndaily energy and macronutrient intakes in American men and\nwomen. We estimated the number of daily snacks and meals\nconsumed by individuals in different food security categories.\nAlso, we calculated the energy contribution, energy density,\nand food group sources of those snacks and meals.\nWe hypothesized that daily total energy intakes would not\nbe different for FI or food secure (FS) individuals; however\nthere would be considerable differences regarding their meal\nand snack behaviors. We hypothesized that a reduction in meal\n1Department of Nutrition and Food Science, Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama, USA; 2Department of Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology, Auburn University,\nAuburn, Alabama, USA; 3Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, US Department of Agriculture, Washington, District of Columbia, USA.\nCorrespondence: Claire Zizza (Claire_Zizza@auburn.edu)\narticles\n \nfrequency among FI individuals would be offset by an increase\nin energy per meal. We also hypothesized that the energy from\nsnacking would be greater in FI than FS individuals.\nMethods And Procedures\nData sources\nNational Center for Health Statistics' (NCHS) National Health and\ninformation about people's consumption of foods and nutrients, as well\nas extensive health-related data, and information about Americans'\nis a complex, multistage probability sample of the civilian, noninstitu-\ntionalized population of the United States.\nFood security measures\nModule (FSSM), which has been shown to be a stable, robust, and reli-\nin four food security categories: FS, marginally FS (MFS), FI without\nhunger (FIWOH), and FI with hunger (FIWH). The time frame for\nthe FSSM is the last 12 months. Because we focused on adults for this\nanalysis, we used the ten-item adult measure to ensure that the same\nmeasure was used for every individual.\nDietary assessment\nlected through an interviewer-administered 24-h dietary recall method.\nResearch has shown that food intake data obtained from a 1-day dietary\nrecall are reliable measures of usual intakes of population groups (16).\nDetails regarding the specification of snack and meal occasions have\nbeen described elsewhere (17). Nutrient intakes obtained from the\nNHANES data set do not include nutrients from dietary supplements,\nmedications, or plain drinking water but do include nutrients from\nbeverages other than drinking water. The number of meal occasions\nand snacking occasions were calculated over the entire 24h for each\nindividual. The energy contributions per snack and per meal, and the\ntotal energy contributions of snacks and meals, were calculated. The\nrelative caloric contribution of food groups defined by US Department\nof Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies,\n1.0 (2004, Beltsville, MD: Agriculture Research Service, Food Surveys\nResearch Group) was also calculated.\nBecause of methodological differences in the treatment of beverages,\nit has been recommended that energy density values be calculated using\nsolely food items (18). Thus using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database\nfor Dietary Studies, 1.0 to beverages, we calculated the energy density\n(kcal/g) of food items (specific USDA food codes used are available from\nthe authors). The contributions from beverages were excluded only from\nthe energy density values. All other calculations included contribution\nfrom beverages.\nAnalytical sample\nThe analytical sample included adults who completed the adult-level\nFSSM. Individuals were screened into the FSSM using the USDA food\nadequacy indicator and/or income. We excluded women who were\npregnant and/or breastfeeding. Because researchers have reported\nassociations between food insecurity and obesity among adults, we\nolder individuals, many of whom have low energy intakes, we excluded\nrespondents >60 years of age (17). Because prior researchers have found\ndifferences among FI men and women, we stratified by gender (women\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)a\nCharacteristic\nWomen Men\nTotal\nFood\nsecure\nMarginally\nfood secure\nFood\ninsecure\nwithout\nhunger\nFood\ninsecure\nwith\nhunger\nFood\nsecure\nMarginally\nfood secure\nFood\ninsecure\nwithout\nhunger\nFood\ninsecure\nwith\nhunger\nPercent\nAgeb\nEthnicityb,c\nEducationb\nMean (s.e.m.)\nIncome\n Poverty income\n ratiod,e\naComparisons were made across levels of food security within gender.

Possible\nconfounders, including age, race-ethnicity, education, and income,\nwere included in our analysis. Age was categorized as 18 to 30 and\n>30 to 60 years. Three race/ethnicity categories were examined: non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic. Level of education\nwas defined as less than high school degree or more high school degree.\nHousehold income was defined as a ratio; each household's income was\ncompared with appropriate poverty thresholds. In all models, FS indi-\nviduals were the referent group.\nTo account for mobile examination center sample design and sampling\nweights, we used STATA (Version 8; STATA, College Station, TX) to\nestimate all descriptive and inferential statistics. To examine whether age,\nrace/ethnicity, and education were differentially distributed among the\nlevels of food security and thus possible confounders, we used 2-tests of\nindependence.

Among women, grain\nproducts were the next largest energy source and contrib-\nuted between 33% among MFS and FIWOH and 26% among\nFIWH. The dairy group was the third leading energy source\nfor women and contributed between 15% among FS and 9%\namong FIWOH.\nDiscussion\nOur results show that an increase in meal size and the energy\nobtained by snacking appears to compensate for a reduced meal\nfrequency among FI individuals. Our results provide a pos-\nsible mechanism in which FI individuals who skip meals may\nactually be able to consume sufficient or more than sufficient\namounts energy. The increase in snacking energy may to be\nattributed to an increase in snacking frequency among FIWOH\nmen. Although the energy per snacking occasion was not sig-\nnificantly different in FIWH women, the modest increase likely\nbecomes amplified when considering the frequency of snack-\ning. Other researchers have also shown that snacking is associ-\nated with higher total energy intake among adults (26\u00ad28).\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report where a 24-h recall\nwas used to demonstrate a reduced meal frequency among FI\nindividuals. Our findings provide validation that the responses\nto the FSSM questionnaire are reflected in the dietary behav-\niors observed in the 24-h recall. Other research has shown\nthat skipping meals is a food choice coping strategy (14).\nCompeting demands for individuals' time and energy, such as\nan increased need to work more than one job, may contribute\nto fewer meals.\nin energy intake were not observed among men or women.\nMFS women had significantly higher intakes of protein than\nFS women, whereas FIWH women had significantly higher\nintakes of total and saturated fat than FS women.\nThe adjusted means for meal and snack occasions and their\nenergy contributions are presented in Table 3. FIWOH and\nFIWH women had significantly fewer meals than FS women.\nMean energy contribution of each meal and the total energy\ncontributed from snacking were both significantly greater for\nFIWOH women than for FS women. Among FIWOH men,\nthe daily number of meals was significantly decreased whereas\nthe daily number of snacks and the total energy from snacking\nwere significantly higher than for FS. FIWOH men consumed\nsnack foods that had a significantly lower energy density than\nFS men.\nThe major sources of energy during meal occasions were sim-\nilar for all levels of food security and for both women and men.\nFor men and women, the grain group was the major source\nof energy during meal occasions (ranging from 30% among\nFIWH men to 34% among FIWH women), followed by meat,\npoultry, fish, egg, and mixtures (ranging from 22% among FS\nwomen to 27% among MFS men). The third largest energy\nsource was the sugars, sweets, and beverages group for men\nand women, ranging from 14% in MFS and FIWH women to\n21% in FIWH men (results regarding the caloric contribution\nof all food groups are available from the authors).\nFor men and women, the major source of energy from\nsnacking was the sugar, sweets, and beverages group. Among\nwomen, sugar, sweets, and beverages contributed between\n34% among FS and 39% among MFS.

Researchers found food\nstamp recipients who shopped for food infrequently consumed\nless energy over the food stamp cycle; however, this difference\nwas not extreme (34). In the same study, frequent shoppers\nwho received food stamps showed no significant differences\nin energy intakes. Two other studies that examined repeated\n24-h recalls found no significant differences in energy intakes\nOur results provide insights regarding the food stamps\u00ad\nobesity association (36,37). Food stamps may alleviate the most\nstringent deprivations; however, they do not increase the likeli-\nhood that a FI household will become completely FS (37). Our\nresults show that the dietary behaviors of women at every level\n(FIWH, FIWOH, and MFS) were different from FS women.\nThus food stamps may not allow recipients, particularly those\nin the most FI categories, to achieve the dietary behaviors of FS\nindividuals.\nOne important consideration is that the dietary intake data\nwe examined are self-reported, and self-reported information\nmay yield biased results (38\u00ad40). Underreporting has been\ninversely related to socioeconomic status and other evidence\nsuggests that overweight individuals underreport intakes\n(41\u00ad44). Another consideration is that the food security mea-\nsurements encompass the past 12 months while the dietary\ninformation encompasses one 24-h recall. When individuals\nare classified as FI in the past 12 months, one cannot be certain\nthat the episodes of hardship occurred during the 24-h period\nassessed by the dietary recall.\nThe results from this study demonstrate that skipping meals\ncan be associated with diets that are adequate and possibly more\nthan adequate in energy. We found an increase in meal size, and\nthe energy obtained by snacking appears to compensate for a\nreduced meal frequency. Thus focusing solely on total energy\nintake is likely to miss important consequences of food insecu-\nrity.Wethereforerecommendthatnutritioninterventionsaimed\nat FI audiences should also target meal and snack behaviors.\nSupplementary Material\nSupplementary material is linked to the online version of the paper at http://\nwww.nature.com/oby\n"
