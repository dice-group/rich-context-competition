We considered first whether the total\namount of support that couples exchange with all parents\nand the help that each parent receives (parent-adjusted\nhelp) varied by the number of living parents. We then in-\nvestigated whether the total amount of intergenerational\nsupport exchanged or the difference between a husband\nand wife in the amount of help given to and received from\nparents was associated with marital satisfaction of hus-\nbands and wives.\nSupport Exchanges between Middle-Aged Couples\nand Aging Parents\nMost empirical research on intergenerational support\nhas relied on the reports of a single person, usually a mid-\ndle-aged daughter, who discusses the help she gives to her\nparents or parents-in-law, and who may also give infor-\nmation about how much help other family members pro-\nvide [3, 4]. Given that much of the support middle-aged\npeople give to their parents occurs in the context of mar-\nried life, a different picture may emerge when considering\nthe help that each marital partner gives to and receives\nfrom his or her parents.\nThe number of living parents involved in exchanges\nwith a given couple may influence the amount of time\nand resources involved in these exchanges [5]. Although\nthis point has not previously been addressed when con-\nsidering the help that adult children provide their aging\nparents, there is literature that demonstrates a relation\nbetween the support parents give to young children and\nfamily size. In what is termed `resource depletion,' chil-\ndren in larger families receive less support from parents\nthan children in smaller families [6, 7]. In one of the few\nstudies of resource depletion focusing on adulthood,\ngrown children in larger families received fewer resourc-\nes from parents than grown children from smaller fami-\nlies [8]. These results suggest that family resources are\nfinite. An alternative perspective, resource expansion,\nsuggests that middle-aged adults are able to expand avail-\nable time and energy to meet increasing needs, whether\ndue to family size and/or specific life problems. This per-\nspective has also received some support in the literature\nGiven these conflicting theoretical stances, we consid-\nered two ways that the number of living parents may af-\nfect the amount of help a couple gives. First, we consid-\nered whether having more living parents might increase\nthe amount of demand on the couple as a whole. Specifi-\ncally, we posited that when there are more living parents,\nthe total support that a couple gives would be greater (hy-\npothesis 1). Second, since resources are finite, we expect-\ned that each parent would receive less support when a\ncouple has a greater total number of living parents. Thus,\nthe parent-adjusted support (total support divided by\nnumber of living parents) that parents receive from chil-\ndren would be lower when the couple has more living\nparents (hypothesis 2).\nPrior studies have also focused primarily on exchang-\nes of support that are transmitted in one direction (from\nadult children to frail aging parents). According to the\nsocial exchange theory [10], however, aged parents tend\nto reciprocate the exchanges of support they have with\ntheir grown children. Indeed, studies have shown that\nthat middle-aged offspring not only provided support to\ntheir aging parents, but also received various types of\nsupport from their parents [11\u00ad13]. As a result, just as a\ncouple may give more total support when they have a larg-\ner number of living parents, they may receive more total\nsupport when they have more living parents. Thus, we\nexpected that the total amount of support aging parents\nprovide to middle-aged couples will increase as a func-\ntion of number of living parents (hypothesis 3).\nSupport Exchanges with Parents and Their\nAssociation with the Middle-Aged Couples' Marital\nSatisfaction\nAccording to the family systems theory, conflicts be-\ntween husbands and wives often erupt as a result of a\nthird party in the family [14]. Both in popular culture and\nin research, parents-in-law are frequently identified as\nthe source of marital disputes among middle-aged cou-\nples [15]. The support that one member of a couple gives\nor receives from parents may be perceived as interference\nor overinvolvement, thus leading to increased tensions in\nthe marriage.\nMuch of the literature has been guided by a stress-bur-\nden model whereby increased support to parents would\naffect marital interactions and satisfaction. Although the\nstress-burden model has been helpful in highlighting\ncrucial aspects of support exchanges on marital satisfac-\ntion, its focus has been criticized as too narrow [16, 17].\nDownloaded by:\nReadCube\nLee/Zarit/Rovine/Birditt/Fingerman\nSome researchers believe that intergenerational support\ngiven to and received from aging parents can be viewed\nas a midlife developmental task that offers opportunity\nfor psychological growth and which helps them develop\na more mutual relationship with parents [18, 19]. This\nperspective suggests that providing and receiving sup-\nport are normative developmental tasks for married\nadults which do not necessarily have a negative impact on\ntheir marriage.\nEmpirical findings on the impact of providing support\nto aging parents on marital satisfaction are mixed. Some\nstudies have shown that caring for dependent parents has\nno significant effect on the marital satisfaction of adult\ncaregiver daughters [20]. Other studies have found a sig-\nnificant association between higher caregiving burden\nfor aging parents and greater stress that adult offspring\nfelt in their marriage [21, 22]. As these examples indicate,\nmost studies that have looked at this issue have focused\non caregiving situations, where one parent needed inten-\nsive help for disabilities. It is unclear whether normative\ntypes of support would have a similar negative associa-\ntion with middle-aged couples' marriages. However, giv-\nen the multiple roles and responsibilities of middle-aged\ncouples, the amount of support given to and received\nfrom aging parents could contribute to marital distress.\nPrior work on this issue has been limited by relying only\non one informant from the couple, usually a wife [23],\nwithout considering whether and how much assistance or\nsupport the other spouse gave to parents, or how the com-\nbination of support to each set of parents might be associ-\nated with marital satisfaction.\nIn the present study, we interviewed both the husband\nand wife about the support given to and received from\nparents and their marital satisfaction. Consistent with\nprior findings that more exchanges with parents lead\nto marital dissatisfaction, we hypothesized that couples\nproviding more help overall to parents would report low-\ner marital satisfaction (hypothesis 4). As previous work\nhas not addressed the implications of receiving support\nfrom parents and marital satisfaction, we examined that\nissue without a specific hypothesis (research question 1).\nIn addition to the effect of the total amount of support\nthat a couple gives to parents, we also considered if dis-\nparities between husband and wife in the amount of help\ngiven and received to parents could lead to lower marital\nsatisfaction. Some studies found that husbands and wives\noften compare each other's involvement in family work\nas a reference point [24]. Other studies found that per-\nceived unfairness in family work has an association with\nmarital dissatisfaction [25, 26]. In the same vein, dispari-\nties in each spouse's involvement with his or her own ag-\ning parents may also create resentment, jealousy or com-\npetition. We hypothesized that disparities in support ex-\nchanged with aging parents will be associated with lower\nmarital satisfaction (hypothesis 5a). Given that disparity\nwill have different implications for husbands and wives,\nwe also examined whether the effect of disparity differs\nfor husbands and wives (hypothesis 5b).\nMethods\nParticipants\nThe sample consists of married couples aged 40\u00ad60, who were\ndrawn from the larger sample of the Family Exchange Study. Par-\nticipants were recruited from the Philadelphia Primary Metro-\npolitan Statistical Area, encompassing five counties in southeast-\nern Pennsylvania and four counties in New Jersey [27], including\nurban, suburban and rural areas. Participants were identified in\na two-step process. First, a target participant was identified who\nwas between the ages of 40 and 60 and had at least one living par-\nent and at least one living child 18 years of age or older. Potential\nparticipants were contacted by telephone using a sampling meth-\nfrom Genesys Corporation and random digit dialing within re-\ngional area codes. An interviewer administered the screening in-\nstrument to determine if the household had an eligible target re-\nspondent. When an eligible person was identified, the interview-\ner invited him or her to participate in the study.\nTarget participants completed a telephone interview lasting\napproximately 1 h that addressed the support they exchanged and\ntheir relationships with their offspring and aging parents. Of the\nthis interview, target participants were asked if the research team\ncould contact children who were 18 years of age or older, their liv-\ning parents, and a spouse if the target was married and the couple\nwere the shared biological parents of the grown children.\ntime of the interview, and 287 (86%) of them agreed to let us con-\nbe interviewed. Table 1 presents demographic characteristics, in-\ncluding age, ethnicity, work status, education, number of chil-\ndren, self-rated health, parents' functioning (activities of daily liv-\ning) and living numbers of parents for the 197 dyads. As seen in\nparents required assistance with instrumental activities of daily\nliving, indicating that most parents of these couples were rela-\ntively independent.\nMeasures\nDependent Variables: Marital Satisfaction\nParticipants rated the overall quality of the relationship with\ntheir spouse on a 5-point scale from 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). This\nsingle item was adapted from an item used in the Americans'\nChanging Lives survey [28]. The item was reverse coded so that\nhigher scores represented greater marital satisfaction. The mean\nindicating high marital satisfaction.\nDownloaded by:\nReadCube\nMiddle-Aged Couples' Exchanges of\nSupport with Aging Parents\nIndependent Variables: Support Exchanges\nParticipants rated how often they provided six types of sup-\nport to each of their own living parents: emotional, practical as-\nsistance, socializing, advice, financial support and talking about\ndaily events. The first five items were derived from the Social Sup-\nport Resources Index [29]. The final item was added based on\npreliminary studies of intergenerational support [2]. Frequency of\nsupport for each item was scored on an 8-point scale that ranged\nfrom 1 (less than once a year or not at all) to 8 (daily). As in prior\nstudies [2, 30], we summed the six items to create a score for how\nmuch support participants gave to each living parent.\nWe then derived three other support scores. First, we summed\nthe amount of support the couple gave to and received from all\nliving parents. Given that the total amount of support couples\nprovided and received from aging parents was relevant to our hy-\npothesis as well as dyadic analysis, we considered the total amount\nof support instead of the support a husband and a wife provided\nor received from parents separately. This indicator represents, in\neffect, the total output and input of support to and from all par-\nents. Second, to test the resource depletion hypothesis, we divided\nthe total support the couple reported by the number of living par-\nents to obtain a score of parent-adjusted support (i.e. how much\nsupport each parent received on average). Third, to examine the\nrelation between the difference in amount of support given by a\nhusband and wife to their respective parents and marital satisfac-\ntion, we created a disparity score by subtracting the total amount\nof support that a husband gave to his parents from the total\namount of support that his wife gave to her parents. A positive\ndisparity score indicates a wife gives more support to her parents\ncompared to her husband, while a negative score indicates her\nhusband gives more help to his parents than she does to hers.\nIn addition, we asked if participants received support from\nparents in the same six areas. As with support given, we comput-\ned the total amount of support the couple received from parents,\nthe parent-adjusted support (how much support received on aver-\nage from each living parent) and the disparity of support received\nwithin the couple.\nData Reduction\nPrior to conducting analyses, exploratory factor analysis was\nused to establish subscales of social support. Separate factor anal-\nyses were conducted for husbands', wives', aging mothers' and fa-\nthers' social support. Items included the six types of support (i.e.\nemotional, practical, advice, financial support, talking about dai-\nly lives and socializing). The results indicated that the factors\nloaded on a single scale. This scale demonstrated satisfactory reli-\nControl Variables\nTo control for the possibility that giving and receiving support\nare due to demographic characteristics or mental and physical\nrobustness of aging parents and/or their adult children, we mea-\nsured a variety of demographic, health and individual difference\nvariables (e.g. proximity to parents, number of adult children, ed-\nucation). Age was controlled in each analysis to take into account\nthe possibility that older individuals give less and receive more.\nGeographic distance between the parties may influence the\namount of support and, then, marital relationship of middle-aged\ncouples [1]. Thus, distance to each parent was included as a covari-\nate. The measure of distance to parents was skewed, so we per-\nformed a log-linear transformation. Education and income were\nconsidered as covariates since individuals with higher education\nand income tend to exchange more support with aging parents\n[31]. Poor health status could lower the amount of support given\nand increase the amount received [16]. Thus, self-rated health was\nincluded as a covariate. Middle-aged adults provide greater total\namounts of assistance to children when they have a larger number\nof children [2]. As a proxy for the amount of support middle-aged\ncouples provide for children, the present analysis used number of\nchildren as a covariate.\nAnalysis Plan\nCovariates\nAs a first step, we estimated bivariate associations between\npotential covariates and amount of support provided and received\nfrom aging parents. Significant associations were found for par-\nticipant age and health; therefore, these variables were included\nin the analyses. Other potential covariates, including number of\nchildren, income, education and distance to parents' home were\nnot significantly associated with the total amount of support or\nparent-adjusted support. Since covariates that are not associated\nwith the dependent variable may generate spurious associations\nbetween variables [32], these nonsignificant variables were not\nincluded in subsequent analyses.\nOur first analyses considered support at the level of the couple.\nOne-way ANCOVAs (GLM) were used to examine if the total\namount of support and the parent-adjusted support the couple\nprovided and received from parents varied as a function of the\nnumber of living parents (hypotheses 1, 2 and 3).\nMultilevel Modeling\nWe next used multilevel models to examine the effects of total\nsupport given and disparities within couples in the amount of\nsupport they each exchanged with parents on individuals' marital\nsatisfaction nested within couples (hypotheses 4, 5a, 5b and re-\nsearch question 1). Separate models were computed for the sup-\nTable 1.

In order to account for the lack of in-\ndependence in the data, we computed multilevel models using the\nPROC MIXED procedure in SAS [33]. We estimated models that\nincluded a repeated effect that allowed errors within couples to be\ncorrelated. The models assumed that observations from a single\nrespondent would have a covariance structure of compound sym-\nmetry (all correlations between scores are assumed to be the\nsame). In these analyses, the couple is an upper level unit and each\nspouse is a lower level unit. Marital satisfaction served as a depen-\ndent variable. Each model included a fixed effect of the couple's\nsum (husband + wife) of support they collectively exchanged with\naging parents, and disparities in support exchange. We did this\nbecause we had an interest in testing whether the total output of\nthe couple might place strain on the marriage and/or if discrepan-\ncies in support had an effect on marital satisfaction. This ap-\nproach of including both a total and discrepancy score is gener-\nally recommended in dyadic analyses [34].\nCovariates included in the multilevel models were, as noted,\nparticipants' age, education, health and number of children. Low-\ner level variables included education and health of each respon-\ndent. Upper level control variables included income. Interaction\nterms were included to examine whether the effects of disparities\ndiffered for husbands and wives. Prior to computing the interac-\ntion terms, we grand mean-centered continuous variables (total\namount of support and disparity in support) and coded the di-\nchotomous variable gender as 0 and 1.\nResults\nThe results are presented in three sections. First, we\npresent two ANCOVA models examining whether the to-\ntal and parent-adjusted amount of support vary by the\nnumber of living parents. Next, we provide the multilev-\nel models examining whether the total amount of support\nand disparities in support exchanged by husbands and\nwives with their respective parents were related to marital\nsatisfaction.\nTotal Amount of Support and Parent-Adjusted\nSupport Provided to Parents by Couples\nThe total amount of all support for parents and the\nparent-adjusted support given to each living parent (i.e.\ntotal amount of all support/number of living parents), ad-\njusted for the covariates, are presented in table 2. Couples\nwith more living parents provided more support overall\ncomparisons revealed significant differences between\ncouples with 1, 2, 3 and 4 living parents. None of the co-\nvariates had a significant effect on the total amount of\nsupport provided to parents.\nThe number of living parents also had a significant\nmain effect on the parent-adjusted support couples gave,\ngave less support to each parent, compared to couples\nwith fewer living parents. Pairwise comparisons indicat-\ned significant differences in parent-adjusted support be-\ntween couples with 1 and 3 living parents, and between\ncouples with 2 and 3 living parents. None of the covari-\nates had significant effects on the total amount of support\nprovided to parents.\nTotal Amount of Support and Parent-Adjusted\nSupport Received from Parents\nWe next analyzed whether the total and parent-adjust-\ned support from aging parents to couples would change\nas a function of number of parents. Results are shown in\ntable 2. As expected, the total amount of support from\nparents to their middle-aged children increased with the\npartial = 0.66]. Pairwise comparison revealed significant\ndifferences between couples with 1 and 2 living parents\nand between those with 3 and 4 living parents. The num-\nTable 2.

The\ntotal amount of support for parents was not associated\nwith marital satisfaction for husbands or wives (hypoth-\nesis 4). Disparities in support for parents, however, had a\nsignificant effect on marital satisfaction (hypothesis 5a),\nand the interaction of gender and disparities was also sig-\nnificant (hypothesis 5b).\nFigure 1 presents how disparities in support provided\nto parents differs by gender. Disparity in support to par-\nents is plotted along the x-axis and husbands' and wives'\nmarital satisfaction along the y-axis. As indicated above,\na positive disparity score indicates a wife's higher involve-\nment with her parents compared to her husband, and a\nnegative disparity score indicates a husband's higher in-\nvolvement with his parents compared to his wife. As il-\nlustrated in figure 1, when the disparity is larger in a pos-\nitive direction (wives' involvement 1 husbands'), the\nmarital satisfaction of the husbands is higher and the\nwives' marital satisfaction is lower.

A larger dis-\ncrepancymightindicatethatonepersongivesalotofsup-\nport. To test this possibility, we ran separate regressions\nfor husbands and wives to examine if the total support\neach person gave or received was associated with marital\nsatisfaction. However, we found that the amount of sup-\nport given separately by husbands and wives, or the sup-\nport they received, was not associated with their marital\nsatisfaction.\nAlso, as shown in model 2 of table 3, the total amount\nof support received from parents was not associated with\nmarital satisfaction for both husbands and wives (re-\nsearch question 1). Disparities in support from parents,\nhowever, had a significant effect on marital satisfaction\n(hypothesis 5a). A gender ! disparities interaction was\nalso significant for support received (hypothesis 5b). The\ngender interaction indicates that whoever received more\nsupport from parents compared to one's spouse reported\nlower marital satisfaction. Among the covariates, self-rat-\ned health was significantly associated with marital satis-\nfaction for both husbands and wives in both models.\nDiscussion\nWe examined the amounts of support middle-aged\nadults exchanged with parents and the effects that the to-\ntal amount of support and disparities of support have on\nmarital satisfaction. In contrast to most prior work, we\nincluded reports from couples, rather than just relying on\none respondent in a marriage or reports drawn from\nwives and husbands not married to one another. We also\nlooked at support given to and received from parents.\nNumber of Parents as a Determining Factor for\nIntergenerational Support Exchange\nWe looked first at whether the number of living par-\nents was related to the total support given and received,\nand the parent-adjusted support each individual parent\nreceived. The results supported both the resource expan-\nsion [2] and the resource depletion hypothesis [7]. Con-\nsistent with the resource expansion hypothesis, with\nmore living parents, couples as a whole gave more total\nsupport to their aging parents. However, consistent with\nthe resource depletion hypothesis, when a couple had\nmore living parents, each parent received less support.\nThis situation may not be problematic for the dyad under\nordinary circumstances, such as observed in the current\nstudy, but middle-aged couples with more living parents\nmay be able to commit less time and fewer resources if the\nneeds of one parent were to increase due to health prob-\nlems or other adverse circumstances. Although not ex-\namined in this study, increases in needs of children may\nalso lead to reduced resources for other family members.\nThe results underscored the value of considering the\nwhole family when examining support exchanges, as well\nas the potential that couples may encounter competing\ndemands when they have more living parents.\nOur findings also demonstrated that there are fre-\nquent exchanges of various types of support between gen-\nerations. The mean pattern indicated that each of the six\ntypes of support was exchanged once a month, with most\nparticipants reporting more frequent exchanges in at\nleast some domains. These results expand on the finding\nby Fingerman et al. [2] from the same data set that shows\na similar pattern of exchanges between the middle gen-\neration and their grown children. In contrast to the con-\ntingency theory that posits the need for care or other spe-\ncial assistance drives intergenerational exchanges [35],\nour findings in a predominantly healthy sample of mid-\ndle-aged adults and their parents suggest that exchanging\nintergenerational support is part of the everyday fabric of\nfamily life. Factors such as previous patterns of exchange,\nfamily norms and affection may play critical roles in\nshaping these everyday exchanges, while contingency\nmay drive support in times of increased need.\nWe considered the possibility that two of the support\nitems, socializing and talking about daily lives, might\nrepresent a different type of support (companionship)\nthat would show a different pattern of exchange. We re-\nran our analyses without these two items and found re-\nsults that were identical to the pattern observed with the\nfull scale.\nRelation between the Total Amount of Support\nExchange and Disparities in Support Exchange on\nMarital Satisfaction\nIn contrast to caregiving studies where the amount of\nhelp given to a parent places strain on couples' marital\nsatisfaction [21], findings from this study showed no ef-\nfects of the total amount of everyday support given by the\ncouple. In part, this finding is due to the fact that middle-\naged adults typically gave support on an intermittent ba-\nsis, and the effects of giving may have been balanced by\nDownloaded by:\nReadCube\nMiddle-Aged Couples' Exchanges of\nSupport with Aging Parents\nreceiving support in return from their parents. As noted,\nmiddle-aged couples with more living parents also could\nhave adjusted their use of time and resources in providing\nsupport.\nOn the other hand, disparities in the amount of sup-\nport exchanged were associated with husbands' and\nwives' marital satisfaction. Whether it was the wife or\nhusband, whichever spouse gave more support to parents\nand received more from parents than the other spouse\nreported lower marital satisfaction. These results are con-\nsistent with prior evidence that married couples often\nmake comparisons between themselves regarding house\nwork and other family matters [24], and that perceived\nunfairness in family work was negatively associated with\nThe literature has emphasized the effects of involve-\nment with parents on wives' marital satisfaction [20], but\nwe found husbands to be affected in a similar way. It is\nalso noteworthy that husbands and wives who gave less\nsupport to their own parents compared to their spouse\nreported higher marital satisfaction. They did not appear\nresentful at their spouses' greater involvement with their\nparents. An alternative explanation of the findings is that\nspouses who are less satisfied with their marriage become\nmore involved in support exchanges with their aging par-\nents. In fact, studies have shown that unhappily married\ncouples tend to increase their contact with aging parents\nfor support and companionship [36, 37]. It may also be\nthat some husbands and wives had greater involvement\nwith parents from the outset of their own marriage, and\nthat the parents played a divisive role within the mar-\nriage. These findings, of course, could be better under-\nstood with longitudinal or prospective studies that inves-\ntigate the link between disparity in support and marital\nsatisfaction.\nIn sum, these results underscore the importance of ex-\namining both members of the couple when considering\nthe implication of exchanges of support between middle-\naged adults and their parents. Further, our analysis re-\nvealed that the disparity between spouses in the support\nexchangedwithagingparentsratherthanthetotalamount\nof support may have implications for their marriage.\nLimitations\nSeveral caveats should be considered in interpreting\nthe findings of this study. First, this sample came from a\nsingle part of the country, the Philadelphia Metropolitan\nStatistical Area. The sample is somewhat better educated\nthan middle-aged couples from a representative national\nsample, but it is similar in many other characteristics. We\nalso cannot rule out the possibility of selection bias in\nwhich spouses agreed to participate in the study.\nWhile we had detailed information on the support\nthat middle-aged children gave to their own parents, we\ndo not know how much they may also have been support-\ning or receiving support from their in-laws. Previous re-\nsearch suggests that intergenerational support is likely to\nbe influenced by consanguinity and long-term commit-\nments based on past reciprocities [38], but it is also known\nthat married daughters and, perhaps to a lesser extent,\nmarried sons are also involved in providing support for\ntheir parents-in-laws [39]. Information on the extent of\ninvolvement that husbands and wives have with their\nparents-in-law would make a more refined assessment of\nthe association between help given and received and cou-\nples' marital relationship.\nAnother limitation of this study is the measure of mar-\nital satisfaction. Although this 1-item marital satisfaction\nscale has been widely used in survey research, it does not\nhave clinical norms associated with it. Thus, although the\nfindings indicate significant association between dispar-\nity in support and marital satisfaction, we do not know if\nthe magnitude reflects small or large differences in mar-\nital satisfaction.\nFinally, because the research design was cross-section-\nal, we were not able to test dynamic and bidirectional\nrelationships among the variables. Longitudinal studies\ncould clarify whether the support given to and received\nfrom parents affects aspects of the couple's relationship\nor if relationship qualities may drive patterns of intergen-\nerational support.\nAcknowledgement\nThis study was supported by a grant from the National Insti-\nerational Transfers, Karen L.
